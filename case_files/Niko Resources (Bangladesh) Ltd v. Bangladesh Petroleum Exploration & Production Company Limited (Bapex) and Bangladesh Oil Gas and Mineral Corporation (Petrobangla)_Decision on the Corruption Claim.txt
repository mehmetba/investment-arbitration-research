INTRODUCTION

This is the fifth Decision by the Tribunals in these Arbitrations, not
counting the numerous procedural orders by which the Tribunals had to
decide complex procedural issues. The dense record thus generated is a
good indication of the complexity of this dispute and explains much of
the long duration of these Arbitrations. This complexity arises from a
number of factors, among which the fact that they concern two different
contracts concluded by the Claimant with different parties in Bangladesh
—a Joint Venture Agreement of 16 October 2003 between the Bangladesh
Petroleum Exploration & Production Company and Niko Resources
(Bangladesh) Ltd (the “JVA”) and a Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement of
27 December 2006 between Petrobangla and the two Joint Venture
Partners (the “GPSA”), jointly referred to as the Agreements - and
different claims, one for the payment of natural gas delivered in
Bangladesh (the “Payment Claim”) and the other for a declaration of
non-liability for damage caused by two blowouts of wells drilled in
Bangladesh (the “Compensation Declaration”). These claims were
brought as two distinct arbitration proceedings. Because of some
common features, identical tribunals were formed in the two arbitrations
and the proceedings were conducted together as agreed during the First
Session. While related, the disputes arising out of each of these contracts
nevertheless raise very different issues.

The part of the dispute which is decided in the present Decision concerns
a claim that the Respondents had raised previously in the proceedings
on jurisdiction and which they raise now again, although in a far broader
scope. They do so notwithstanding that the Tribunals had considered
and rejected that claim in its earlier version, that the Respondents had
affirmed the agreements which they now wish to have declared void ab
initio, and that the Tribunals had issued a clear finding that the
Respondents were liable for the payment of gas delivered and at a time
when the proceedings concerning the other Agreement were well
advanced. On 25 March 2016, the Respondents raised a claim that both
contracts had been obtained by corruption and that, consequently, no
claims of the Claimant could be entertained in international arbitration
and that all claims of the Claimant should be dismissed (the “Corruption
Claim”).

The Corruption Claim now being presented by the Respondents is
characterised by several features which distinguish this case from others
which have also involved allegations of corruption.

‘in order to gain some unjustified advantage. The much-quoted World

Duty Free case is a good example for such a straight forward case of
corruption: the investor acknowledged that he had delivered a briefcase
full of cash to the President of the country and thus obtained the desired
concession. In the present case, the Respondents argue that, during the
period when the two Agreements were negotiated and concluded, the
country was under the rule of a government which had established an
endemic system of corruption which required bribes from anyone wishing
to do business in the country. These payments, according to the
Respondents, were not made directly by Niko to the targeted civil
servants, but

   
   

This
explains why the inquiry which the Tribunals had to conduct in
addressing the Respondents’ case

As the Respondents explained during the proceedings on their
Corruption Claim, a vast investigation had been carried out in
cooperation between the Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission (the
“ACC”), the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (the “RCMP”) and the U.S.
Federal Bureau of Investigations (the “FBI”). The investigation also
concerned other companies and generated the vast amount of material
just mentioned on which the Respondents rely and which they disclosed
only gradually. Many of the payments identified in the course of the
investigation were represented graphically on the synthetic table below
which found itself in the center of argument and demonstrations at the
Hearing and often referred to as

This table represents only those payments of which the Joint
Investigation found traces.

In order to support the corruption
allegation, the Respondents provide additional evidence, seeking to link

3

some of the payments to public officials at various levels. The conclusions
which the Respondents invite the Tribunals to draw from this evidence is
based to a very large extent on inferences which, according to the
Respondents, justify the conclusion that corruption occurred.

The Tribunals have carefully examined this evidence and the conclusions

which the Respondents urge them to draw. In this process the Tribunals

‘conclusions. In many respects these explanations required substantial
correction which produce

  

 

These will be explored in the explanations
set out in the body of this Decision. At this stage, the Tribunals give the
following two examples:

First, the Respondents seek to create the impression that Niko had been
disqualified from the oil and gas market in Bangladesh and that it was
only through corruption that its proposal to develop marginal and
abandoned gas fields could be presented to the Government and the
Respondents. They asserted that

 

was
bribes’. The Respondents’ witness, Ms LaPrevotte, who, as an agent of
the FBI had a leading role in the Joint Investigation in Bangladesh, had
also investigated the case of corruption admitted by Siemens and other
companies; she asserted: “In many ways the Niko tender or bid was very
similar to Siemens. In both cases at the very onset both companies were
deemed unqualified and yet they were both still participating in the tender
process”. In the present proceedings it became apparent that the case of
Niko was quite different from that of Siemens and that Niko was in fact
not “unqualified” for the project it had proposed. Indeed, Mr Chowdhury,
who in 2002 was Acting Secretary at the Ministry of Power, Energy and
Mineral Resources, testified that the Respondents assured him that Niko
was sufficiently qualified for “the exploration of marginal gas fields”.

because it allowed Bangladesh to
recover gas from fields which “were not rehabilitated due to financial
constraints and technical limitations faced by Petrobangla and due to the
marginal nature of these fields and uneconomical investment’. Indeed,
Niko did recover gas from the Feni field which it sold to Petrobangla at a

4

10.

11.

12.

13.

price substantially below the price which Petrobangla paid to other
suppliers.!

Secondly, with respect to the central issues concerning the definition of
the contract area in the Chattak gas field and the use of the Swiss
Challenge as a form of competitive bidding, the divergence in the
positions of the Respondents and Niko was resolved by a reference to the
Law Ministry.

 
    

 

In their search for the true facts, the Tribunals have sought to establish
an accurate narrative supported by the evidence in the record. This has

Respondents. They have done so as part of their effort to judge fairly and
without any preconceptions.

 

Finally, it should be pointed out that in raising the Corruption Claim in

  
 
 

n particular they seek to avoid
payment for the gas delivered to Petrobangla at an advantageous price,
substantially below that which Petrobangla agreed to purchase other gas.

  

After the presentation of the procedural background and the relief
requested, the Tribunals set out below in some detail the factual
background as revealed in the course of their extensive analysis of the
evidence presented. They then examine the Respondents’ request for

1 1998 Petrobangla Comments, Exhibit R-267; see also below, Section 4.2.

5

reconsideration of the Tribunals’ Decision on Jurisdiction as well as the
legal issues presented by the Respondents’ Corruption Claim. Against
this background the Tribunals consider the evidence for corruption. As
the corruption allegation is directed not merely at the conclusion of each
of the two Agreements but against a number of prior actions, the
Tribunals have fully analysed that prior conduct in order to determine
whether they involved corruption and were caused by it. In particular
they have examined the specifically alleged Suspect Payments. This
analysis has led to their conclusion on the Corruption Claim.

2 THE ARBITRATIONS AND RELATED PROCEEDINGS

15.

17.

18.

19.

A detailed account of the procedural history in the two Arbitrations up to
the Tribunals’ Third Decision on the Payment Claim is set forth in the
Tribunals’ Decisions of 11 September 2014, 14 September 2015, and 16
May 2016. It need not be repeated here. The Tribunals at this stage
merely recapitulate those parts of the past proceedings which are relevant
for their present decision on the Corruption Claim brought by the
Respondents in their submissions of 25 March 2016, before summarising
the procedure since then.

A number of the procedural decisions which the Tribunals were required
to take during the present part of the proceedings had an impact on or
have some other relevance for the present Decision on the merits of the
Corruption Claim. They will therefore be presented in some detail so as
to assist in the understanding of the procedural context in which this
claim is decided.

The Parties remain unchanged from the Third Decision on the Payment
Claim:

The Respondents, who have initiated this Corruption Claim, are
Bangladesh Petroleum & Production Company, Limited (“BAPEX”) and
Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (“Petrobangla”).?

The Respondents are represented in these Arbitrations by Foley Hoag in
Washington, D.C. and by Messrs Md. Ruhul Amin, NDC (Chairman,
Petrobangla), Syed Ashfaquzzaman (Secretary, Petrobangla), and Mir Md.
Abdul Hannan (Managing Director, Bapex), Imtiaz U. Ahmad Asif, and
Moin Ghani in Dhaka.

The Claimant, the responding party in the Corruption Claim, is Niko
Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. (“Niko”), a company incorporated under the
laws of Barbados. Certain allegations raised during the proceedings on

2 Prior to the Decision on Jurisdiction, the People’s Republic of Bangladesh was also a Respondent in these
proceedings. The government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh is hereafter referenced as “GOB” or
“the Government”.

24.

the Corruption Claim also concern the parent company of the Claimant,
Niko Resources Ltd. (“Niko Canada”), which is incorporated in Canada,
although it is not itself a party to these proceedings.3 Niko Canada and
its subsidiaries are referred to collectively in this Decision as the “Niko
Group” or also as “Niko”.

The Claimant is represented in these Arbitrations by Dentons Europe in
Paris, Dentons Canada in Calgary, and Messrs Rokanuddin Mahmud and
Mustafizur Rahman Khan in Dhaka.

The Tribunals in these two cases, constituted on 20 December 2010, are
composed of Professor Jan Paulsson, Professor Campbell McLachlan QC
and Mr Michael E. Schneider, President of the Tribunals. 4

Corruption issues during the jurisdiction phase

During the proceedings on jurisdiction the Respondents had raised
among several other objections against the Tribunals’ jurisdictions an
objection based on corruption. In the Decision on Jurisdiction the
Tribunals addressed this objection, as it was then presented, in
considerable detail with respect to their jurisdiction. The decision did not
prejudice the question whether the JVA and the GSPA themselves were
procured by corruption. The facts considered in the Decision on
Jurisdiction, nevertheless, remain relevant for the Tribunals’ decision
now.

The Tribunals refer to the detailed account in the Decision on
Jurisdiction and summarise below the essential aspects that remain
relevant for the present Decision on the Corruption Claim.

The Decision on Jurisdiction considered in particular the following
matters:

(i) the conviction of Niko Canada in Canada on account of bribes made
to the Minister of Energy in 2005, consisting of a vehicle valued at
some CAD 190,000 and approximately CAD 50,000 CAD in non-
business related travel expenses;

3 The Claimant and its nationality were discussed in Section 5 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.
* The constitution of the Tribunals is detailed in Section 4.1 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

some limited information about the investigation initiated by the
ACC in 2007;

the proceedings brought by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers
Association (“BELA”) and others in the Supreme Court of
Bangladesh, High Court Division, in 2005 (“BELA Proceedings’);

anti-corruption proceedings alleged to have been initiated by the
ACC against Niko’s consultant, Mr Sharif; and

(v) | the actions of Mr Harb, a Canadian Senator also retained by Niko as
a consultant.
25. Having considered the evidence presented during the jurisdiction phase,

the Tribunals “concluded that the Claimant has committed the acts of
corruption which were sanctioned [by Canadian authorities] in the
Canadian conviction” concerning the vehicle and the travel expenses but
that there was “no reason to conclude that, [...] other acts of corruption
were committed by the Claimant or its group.”>

26. Concerning the effect of the acts of corruption committed by the Claimant
(i.e. the acts sanctioned by the Canadian conviction, which are discussed
in further detail below), the Tribunals noted

that the Canadian authorities declared that they were “unable to
prove that any influence was obtained as a result of providing the
benefits to the Minister”. No allegation to the contrary was made in
this arbitration. Bearing in mind the quoted finding of the Supreme
Court of Bangladesh concerning the absence of “fraudulent means” in
the making of the JVA, the Tribunal has no reason to believe that
corruption had any influence in the conclusion or the content of the
JVA or the GSPA.®

27. The Tribunals further stated that:

there is no link of causation between the established acts of corruption
and the conclusion of the agreements, and it is not alleged that there
is such a link. Instead, the Respondents argue that an attempt to

5 Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 428.
6 Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 429.

28.

29.

obtain a contract by bribery is sufficient to deny recourse to ICSID
arbitration to the party having made such an attempt.

More importantly, the Respondents have not sought to avoid the
agreements nor did they state that the Agreements were void ab
initio.”
Following an analysis of the arguments presented concerning the legal
impact of corruption on the Tribunals’ jurisdiction — including good faith,
the clean hands doctrine and international public policy — paragraph 485
of the Decision on Jurisdiction states that:

[ijn these circumstances, the Tribunal may not rely on the events
subject of the Canadian judgment as grounds for refusing to examine
the merits of a dispute which the parties to the agreements have
accepted to submit to ICSID arbitration. The Respondents’ objection
based on acts of corruption must be dismissed.

The Decision on Jurisdiction held inter alia that the Tribunals have
jurisdiction (i) under the JVA between the Claimant and BAPEX to decide
the Claimant’s request for a Compensation Declaration and (ii) the
Claimant’s claim against Petrobangla for payment under the GPSA.

2.2 The Proceedings related to the Payment Claim

30.

31.

Following the Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunals organised the
proceedings on the merits of the two Arbitrations, commencing with the
Claimant’s Payment Claim. The history of the proceedings on that claim
is recorded in the Tribunals’ decisions; for present purposes, it will suffice
to recall some salient features of relevance to the present Decision on the
Corruption Claim.

2.2.1 The Tribunals’ First and Second Decision on the Payment Claim

On 11 September 2014 the Tribunals issued their First Decision on the
Payment Claim holding that

1. Petrobangla owes Niko USD 25’°312’747 plus BDT 139’988’337
as per Niko’s invoices for gas delivered from November 2004 to April
2010;

7 Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 456-457.

10

32.

33.

2. Petrobangla must pay simple interest on Niko’s invoices at the
rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the US Dollar amounts and at 5% for
the amounts in BDT; interest is due on the amount of each invoice as
from 45 days after delivery of the invoice but not before 14 May 2007
and until it is placed at Niko’s unrestricted disposition;

3. The claim for compound interest on the amount awarded under
above item (1) and (2) is reserved;

4. The entitlement of BAPEX to payments under the GPSA is not
affected by the present decision;

5. The Parties are invited to seek an amicable settlement with
respect to the modalities for implementing the [11 September 2014]
decision and to report by no later than 30 September 2014;

6. Failing amicable settlement, any Party may seize the Tribunals
for recommendations on provisional measures or a final decision
concerning the outstanding amounts;

7. The decision on costs of the proceedings concerning the
Payment Claim is reserved.

Following this decision, the Parties reported that, further to the
Tribunals’ invitation, they conferred, but did not reach agreement. Upon
the Claimant’s request, the Tribunals then issued on 14 September 2015
the Decision on the Implementation of the Payment Claim (the “Second
Decision on the Payment Claim’).

In the Second Decision on the Payment Claim the Tribunals held that:

i) Petrobangla shall pay into an escrow account USD 25’312’747
and BDT 139’988’337, plus interest (a) in the amounts of USD
5’932’833 and BDT 49’849’961 and (b) as from 12 September 2014
at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and
at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually;

ii) The escrow account shall be opened by the Claimant at a
reputable, internationally operating bank according to standard
conditions in international banking practice and providing that funds
in the escrow account shall be released only (a) as instructed by the
present Arbitral Tribunals or (b) by joint instructions of Niko and
Petrobangla;

iii) | Petrobangla shall ensure that the USD amounts paid into the
Escrow Account are freely available to Niko without any restrictions

11

34.

35.

if and when payment to Niko is ordered by the present Arbitral
Tribunals;

iv) Until the amounts due as per above (i) have been fully paid to
Niko at its free disposition or otherwise released from the Escrow
Account, Petrobangla shall continue to pay interest on these amounts
at the rate of six month LIBOR + 2% for the U.S. Dollar amounts and
at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded annually. At the end of
each year, the Bank shall inform Petrobangla about any interest
earned on the Escrow Account during the course of the year.
Petrobangla may deduct the interest so earned from its interest
payments for the corresponding period. If the interest earned on the
amounts in the Escrow Account during a year exceeds the interest
due by Petrobangla, the exceeding amount shall remain in the account
without any credit to Petrobangla;

v) If any difficulties occur which prevent the operation of the
Escrow Account as intended by the present decision, any Party may
address itself the Tribunals for a ruling as required.

2.2.2 The Tribunals’ Third Decision on the Payment Claim and the
Respondents’ requests for reconsideration

 

Following unsuccessful efforts of the Parties to establish an escrow
account and an application by the Claimant for an order instructing the
Respondents to execute the documents for the escrow account,® the
Claimant requested on 15 December 2015, an award on the Payment
Claim ordering Petrobangla unconditionally to make payment to Niko of
the amounts the Tribunals found to be due and owed.

The Respondents commented on 6 January 2016, stating that, in their
view, “[t/here is no difficulty preventing operation of the Escrow Account’,
adding that “/t/he Respondents have not refused to sign the Escrow
Agreement. They simply seek the opportunity to do so in conditions that do
not create a risk of their officials being held in contempt of court.” They
confirmed Petrobangla’s undertaking that it “has committed to making
payment into the escrow account as soon as the injunction is modified or
lifted’; they indicated that the petition for lifting the injunction could be
“resolved within the next 3 (three) months’.

8 For further details see Third Decision on the Payment Claim, Section 3.2.

12

36.

37.

38.

39.

Before the three months were over, the Respondents filed their
Corruption Claim on 25 March 2016 (which forms the subject matter of
the present Decision, the procedure of which shall be described in further
detail below). On the same occasion, the Respondents also requested
that the Tribunals’ earlier decisions be vacated. They requested:

that the Tribunal vacate its Decision on the Payment Claim of 11
September 2014 as weil as its 14 September 2015 Decision on
Implementation of that prior decision, and enter an award dismissing
Niko’s claims.?

The Respondents submitted on 12 May 2016 information with respect to
an injunction by the High Court Division of the Supreme Court, ordering
the Respondents and the Government “not to give any kind of benefit’ to
the Claimant or to Niko Canada and “not to make any kind of payment”
to them. !°

Having heard the Parties on their respective applications, the Tribunals
issued on 16 May 2016 their Third Decision on the Payment Claim. In
that decision the Tribunals explained that they had considered
corruption allegations by the Respondents previously. If the new
allegations were better founded than the earlier ones and the Tribunals
would declare the Agreements void, the Claimant would not have a
payment claim but, as per the argument as then presented by the
Respondents, “a claim for the limited relief of restitution under sections 64
and 65 of the Bangladesh Contract Act’. The Tribunals concluded that
“there was no justification for deferring their Third Decision on the Payment
Claim or to suspend its effect until the Corruption Claim had been decided.
Petrobangla must pay the outstanding amounts forthwith” .'1

In the Third Decision on Payment Claim the Tribunals ordered:

fi) Petrobangla shall pay to Niko forthwith and free of any
restrictions USD 25’312’747 and BDT 139’988’337, plus interest (a)
in the amounts of USD 5’932’833 and BDT 49849961 and (b) as from
12 September 2014 at the rate of six month LIBOR +2% for the U.S.
Dollar amounts and at 5% for the amounts in BDT, compounded
annually;

44,

(ii) | This payment must be made immediately and is not subject to
any contrary orders from the Courts in Bangladesh;

(iii) In view of the difficulties which have occurred in the past with
respect to the payment of the amount owed to the Claimant, the
Tribunals remain seized of the matter until final settlement of this
payment.

In accordance with the directions given in the Third Decision on Payment
Claim, the Claimant by letter of 2 June 2016 identified the amount owed
to the Claimant by the Respondents pursuant to the Third Decision on
the Payment Claim.

On 27 June 2016, the Tribunals invited the Respondents to provide
information regarding the steps the Respondents had taken to make the
payment as ordered in the Third Decision on the Payment Claim. The
Respondents did not provide the requested information.

Instead, the Respondents requested, by their letter of 30 June 2016,
that the Tribunals reconsider the Third Decision on the Payment
Claim and suspend the Respondents’ obligation to pay until the
resolution of the Respondents’ Corruption Claim. They argued inter alia
that they had not fully briefed the issue of restitution for unjust
enrichment and, in any event, they denied that, in case the Tribunals
accepted the Corruption Claim, they would have to make any payment
for the gas delivered by the Claimant.

In Procedural Order No. 14 of 29 July 2016, which organised the
proceedings on the Corruption Claim, the Tribunals also invited the
Claimant to comment on the Respondents’ Request for Reconsideration.

The Claimant commented 8 August 2016 on the Respondents’ Request
for Reconsideration, asking that the Tribunals dismiss it. During the
Procedural Consultations held between the Tribunals and the Parties by
telephone on 10 August 2016, the Tribunals invited the Respondents to
comment on the Claimant’s 8 August 2016 letter. The Respondents did
so on 19 August 2016, reaffirming their request that the Tribunals
reconsider their Third Decision on the Payment Claim and suspend
Petrobangla’s payment obligation until the award. On the same day, the
Claimant opposed the Respondents’ request. On 17 October 2016, the

14

45.

46.

47.

Claimant asked that the Tribunals dismiss the Respondents’ request
entirely.

The Tribunals decided the Request for Reconsideration by Procedural
Order No 16 of 11 November 2016. Reserving the question whether
applications for reconsideration of decisions on the substance of a
dispute are admissible in ICSID proceedings, the Tribunals found that,
in any event, the Respondents’ request would have to be denied inter alia
because the mere possibility of annulment of the GPSA was not a
sufficient ground to reconsider the Tribunals’ decision ordering
immediate payment. The Tribunals also invited the Respondents to report
within one week on their compliance with the Third Decision on the
Payment Claim.

Subsequently, on 15 November 2016, the Claimant submitted a letter
providing the Respondents with the total amounts as of that date, and
the relevant bank account information. On 22 November 2016, the
Respondents informed the Tribunals that they had no further
information to report with regard to their compliance with the Third
Decision on the Payment Claim.

The Tribunals have not been informed that Petrobangla has made any
payment in compliance with the Decisions on the Payment Claim.

2.3 The Proceedings on the Compensation Declaration

48.

49.

Further to Procedural Order No 3, each of the Parties produced two
submissions on the merits of the Claimant’s request in connection with
the Compensation Declaration. Having noted that BAPEX requested the
dismissal of the Claimant’s request but did not produce any substantive
argument and evidence to rebut the Claimant’s position, the Tribunals
decided by Procedural Order No 7 of 17 October 2014 to appoint experts
in the technical fields relevant for their decision. The experts delivered
their reports and the Parties were invited to comment thereon.

The Respondents then changed counsel and on 9 July 2015 applied for

a modification of the procedure. By Procedural Order No 11, on 19 August
2015, the procedure was adapted in partial response to this application.

15

50.

51.

52.

53.

54.

A Hearing on Liability was held from 2 to 7 November 2015 in London,
with the appearance of witnesses of fact and experts addressing
questions of liability for the two blowouts.

The Parties produced Post-Hearing Submissions on liability on 22
January 2016. The procedure on damages had been fixed at the end of
the Hearing on Liability, with a Hearing on Damages scheduled for 29
August to 2 September 2016 in Paris. The Tribunals held a further
hearing with the Parties on 21 and 22 February 2016 regarding the
Compensation Declaration.

The Tribunal was engaged in the preparation of the decision on liability
when, on 25 March 2016, the Respondents raised the Corruption Claim.

The Parties were invited to comment on the implications of the Corruption
Claim on the pending proceedings on the Compensation Declaration.
Having considered these comments, the Tribunals issued Procedural
Order No 13 in which they announced their decision to examine, as a
matter of priority, whether the JVA and/or the GPSA were procured by
corruption and to suspend, with one exception, the proceedings on all
other issues.

Specifically, with respect to the Compensation Declaration, the Tribunals
considered that the principal bases for the declaration of non-liability
sought by the Claimant

. are the obligations of Niko as Operator under the JVA. Although
they seek compensation from Niko, the Respondents have so far not
explained the basis for Niko's liability in case of Avoidance of the JVA.
Since, in the hypothesis considered here, the JVA would be avoided,
claims for compensation by Niko must be determined by reference to
norms and standards of a different origin. The Parties' arguments in
the proceedings concerning the Compensation Declaration therefore
would have to be reconsidered in case of Avoidance of the JVA.

Consequently, before they can examine the Claimant's request for
non-liability and the Respondents’ request for compensation for the
losses resulting from the two blow-outs, the Tribunals must first
decide the Corruption Issue and the question whether Niko's liability
must be determined by reference to the norms and standards
prescribed by the JVA or by reference to those applicable in the
absence of the JVA.

16

55.

56.

The Corruption Claim being resolved by the present decision, the
Tribunals will henceforth resume the work on the Compensation
Declaration to complete the Decision on Liability for the blowouts.

The procedure for these further steps in the proceedings on the
Compensation Declaration will be the subject of a further procedural
order after consultation with the Parties.

2.4 The Corruption Claim and the proceedings relating to it

57.

58.

59.

The Corruption Claim was filed by BAPEX and Petrobangla separately in
parallel submissions on 25 March 2016. BAPEX made it a part of its
Memorial on Damages, with a voluminous bundle of evidence received by
the Tribunals on 5 April 2016. Petrobangla raised its Corruption Claim
in a separate letter, also of 25 March 2016, relying on BAPEX’s
presentation of facts and argument.

With respect to the Corruption Issue, BAPEX sought declarations that
the JVA was procured through corruption, that therefore the Claimant
was not entitled to pursue its claims through the international arbitration
system and, relying on the Bangladesh Contract Act, that the JVA was
voidable and that BAPEX avoided the agreement.!2 In its separate and
parallel letter of 25 March 2016, Petrobangla requested that, in view of
the facts and legal consequences presented by BAPEX, the Tribunals find
that “the GPSA was procured by corruption and is thus voidable”. It
informed the Tribunals of “its decision to rescind the GPSA”.

The Respondents modified their request for relief on 29 April 2016.
Relying, in addition to international law, on Article 102 of the
Constitution of Bangladesh, they presented their relief as follows:

The Respondents first ask that the Tribunalls] recognise that the JVA
and the GPSA are void under Bangladeshi law and without legal
effect. In the alternative, Respondents maintain their request to void
the agreements.

12 The complete text of the request for relief is reproduced below in Section 3.

17

60.

6l.

62.

63.

64.

From the moment of that submission onward, the Respondents pursued
the two claims jointly. The Tribunals refer to them as the “Corruption
Claim” and the corresponding dispute as the “Corruption Issue”.

2.4.1 Initial consultation of the Parties and decision on treating the
Corruption Claim as a matter of priority (Procedural Order No 13)

On 18 April 2016, the Tribunals invited the Claimant to comment on the
applications by the Respondents; and the Respondents to comment

. on the consequences of the avoidance of the JVA and the GPSA
with respect to, in particular, past performance, addressing:

with respect to the GPSA the question of payments which Petrobangla
may owe, in case of a rescission, for the gas received (explaining
whether Petrobangla considers owing no payment at all or payment
valued for instance at the price agreed in the GPSA or at its
commercial value, taking into account the price at which Petrobangla
purchases gas from other suppliers);

with respect to the JVA, whether any credit must be given to
investments made by Niko in performance of the agreement and how
such credit is to be valued.

The Parties presented these comments on 29 April 2016, including the
Respondents’ modified requests for relief.

The Claimant argued in its comments on 29 April 2016 that the
Corruption Issue now raised by the Respondents had been known for a
long time and had been considered by the Tribunals in their Decision on
Jurisdiction. This decision was final and binding and could not be
reopened. If, however, the Decision were reopened, BAPEX had not
offered any justification for doing so. In any event, Petrobangla’s request
to rescind the GPSA, “an agreement that had expired by its own terms
years ago”, was frivolous and should “summarily be rejected”.

On 10 May 2016 the Respondents communicated to the Tribunals several
requests concerning the evidence for their Corruption Claim: one of them
concerned the redacted version of an affidavit of Corporal Kevin Duggan
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) with respect to which they
sought assistance in obtaining an un-redacted or less redacted version
(the “Duggan Affidavit”, see below Section 2.4.6); another request

18

65.

66.

67.

concerned information “relating to the ACC and the Canadian
investigation and possibly the US investigation” which the law firm of
Gowlings Lafleur Henderson LLP, the Claimant’s previous counsel, had
mentioned during the jurisdictions phase (the Gowlings Information,
see below Sections Sections 2.4.2, 2.4.4 and 2.4.16); a third request had
already been made to the Claimant in a letter of 19 April 2016 (produced
as Annex C to the Respondents’ 10 May 2016 letter) and included
communications between 2001 and 2006 on various subjects and
between various persons as well as financial records “showing transfers
and/or payments of funds between 2001 and 2006” (the Documents
Request, see below Section 2.4.4). With respect to the last of these
requests, the Respondents informed the Tribunals that the Claimant had
refused to provide the requested documents; the Respondents expressed
confidence that no further evidence was required to justify the relief
requested, adding that “we do not at this time seek an order compelling
the production of documents by Niko”.

The Tribunals considered these submissions and, on 26 May 2016,
issued Procedural Order No. 13. They noted that their jurisdiction to
decide the Corruption Issue had not been contested and decided to
consider the Respondents’ claims in this respect and stated: “Mindful of
their responsibility for upholding international public policy, the Tribunals
will therefore examine the corruption charges that have been raised by the
Respondents.”

The Tribunals decided to examine the Corruption Claim with priority. As
explained above (Section 2.2.2), the Tribunals had determined in their
Third Decision on the Payment Claim of 16 May 2016 that, in the
circumstances and given the Respondents’ argument on the effect of
avoidance of the GPSA and the obligation of restitution under the
Bangladesh Contracts Act, the obligation of Petrobangla to make
payment for the gas delivered under the GPSA would not be affected. The
proceedings on all other issues were suspended, except for a request
for provisional measures that the Claimant had filed on 19 May 2016 in
relation to the Payment Claim.!8

As to the next steps, the Tribunals invited

13 See above Section 2.4.1.

19

(a) the Claimant to respond to the Respondents' letter of 10 May
2016 and the request concerning the Duggan Affidavit;

(b) the Claimant to provide a list of compliant documents in
response to the Respondents' Annex C attached to the 10 May 2016
letter, and an account of the negotiations for the two Agreements,
identifying inter alia the persons involved in the negotiations, both on
the side of Niko and on the side of Petrobangla, BAPEX and the
Government of Bangladesh;

(c) the Respondents to provide a list of documents, including
company records and reports about the negotiations, as well as an
account of the negotiations for the two Agreements, identifying inter
alia the persons involved in the negotiations, both on the side of Niko
and on the side of Petrobangla, BAPEX and the Government of
Bangladesh, and describing the role in which they were involved.

(ad) When identifying the persons involved in the negotiations, the
Parties are invited to provide their names and the addresses for
potential future witness notification purposes.

68. The Tribunals informed the Parties that they intended

...to hear as witnesses persons who were involved in the negotiation
and conclusion of the JVA and the GPSA, including those involved in
the Government approval of these Agreements. In light of the
communications from the Parties and on the basis of their own
examination of the available information, the Tribunals will in due
course decide whom they wish to hear. The Parties will also be given
the opportunity to identify the persons they wish to examine.

69. The Tribunals added that

[in their responses, the Parties may include suggestions regarding the
Tribunals’ further reception and examination of evidence, including
indications of other sources of possibly relevant information.

70. The Tribunals announced their intention to hold a telephone conference,
once the Parties’ communications had been received and gave
instructions concerning the Claimant’s request for provisional measures
and the Alam Proceedings before the High Court Division.14

2.4.2 Organising the procedure on the Corruption Claim (Procedural
Order No 14

Following the notification of Procedural Order No 13 of 26 May 2016, the
Respondents wrote on 7 June 2016, referring to the Gowlings Information
they had mentioned in their letter of 10 May 2016 and “suggestfing] that
the Claimant should also be asked to provide a list of documents relating
to corruption investigations that it, its affiliates and its counsel had and
did not produce during the jurisdiction phase”.

 

On 14 June 2016 the Respondents submitted their “Responses to
Procedural Order No 13” (R-RPO13) containing an account of the
negotiations of the JVA and GPSA, accompanied by further supporting
exhibits. They attached a list of the names and addresses of persons
involved in the negotiations, and a list of documents including records
and reports about the negotiations of the JVA and GPSA (Annex A and
B).

Following correspondence relating to the Payment Claim (see above
Section 2.2), the Tribunals on 29 July 2016 issued Procedural Order
No. 14 dealing with the various evidentiary issues that had arisen
concerning the Corruption Claim.

Procedural Order No 14 gave instructions concerning the gathering of
evidence (see below Section 2.4.4) and invited the Parties’ views on the
scope of the investigation to be conducted and a number of evidentiary
issues. It also indicated how the Tribunals intended to proceed further
upon receipt of the requested information. They decided the Respondents’
requests concerning the Duggan Affidavit and the Canadian
Investigations, as will be discussed separately below.

2.4.3 Scope and Nature of the Tribunals’ Examination, the Targeted
Period and the Procedural Time Table (Procedural Order No 15)

 

The Parties filed on 8 August 2016 their replies to the Tribunals’
invitation in Procedural Order No 14. They provided information
concerning the collection of documentary evidence and the persons
involved in the negotiations. They also commented on the scope of the
Tribunals’ examination and the Targeted Period.

21

77.

80.

The Respondents filed a Request for Reconsideration of certain
portions of Procedural Order No. 14 on 9 August 2016, concerning in
particular the Canadian Investigation and the Duggan Affidavit (see
below).

On 10 August 2016, the Tribunals held a Procedural Consultation with
the Parties by telephone to discuss the further organization of the
Corruption Claim procedure. In preparation of this consultation, the
Tribunals sent the Parties a “List of Issues” which the Tribunals had
identified. These issues were addressed during the consultation and
included the scope of the examination on the Corruption Claim, the
Targeted Period, various issues related to evidence, and the use of
information obtained or disclosed during these Arbitrations.

With respect to the procedural steps and the time table, the Parties
agreed on simultaneous document production, followed by a written
memorial in which the Respondents were to set out their allegations
concerning the procurement by corruption of the JVA and the GPSA,
accompanied by the relevant evidence. The Claimant was then to respond
in the form of a written memorial containing its case in defence, also
accompanied by evidence. The Respondents further requested a second
round of written submissions. The Tribunals prepared Summary
Minutes of this procedural consultation and sent them on 25 August
2016 to the Parties in draft form for comments; the finalised version was
distributed on 29 November 2016.

The Tribunals recorded the procedural steps as previously discussed with
the Parties in their Procedural Order No 15, which they submitted to the
Parties in a draft form. They discussed this draft in another Procedural
Conference by telephone on 1 September 2016.

Procedural Order No 15 was then issued on 7 October 2016. It fixed
the steps in the procedure and the procedural timetable as previously
discussed with the Parties and settled a number of issues concerning in
particular the scope of the Tribunals’ examination, including the Targeted
Period, the collection of evidence, the requested interventions of the
Tribunals with respect to the Canadian Investigation and the Duggan
Affidavit and the Respondents’ request for reconsideration related
thereto.

22

83.

In Procedural Order No 15, the Tribunals explained their view on the
Scope and Nature of the Examination of the Corruption Claim. They
noted the Claimant’s insistence on the adversarial nature of ICSID
arbitration proceedings, which require that a party state clearly the case
which the other party must meet and the decision which it requires the
arbitral tribunal to make. They also noted the Respondents’ comments,
insisting that the Tribunals’ decision concerning their exclusive
jurisdiction (see below Section 2.5.2) with respect to the Corruption Claim
entails an augmented responsibility of the Tribunals and the need for a
broad enquiry not necessarily confined to the arguments and evidence
which the Parties are prepared to submit to them. The Respondents had
recognised, nevertheless, that their position and an approach by which
the Tribunals seek “to get to the truth” were not incompatible with the
adversarial process.

In response to the Parties’ arguments and requests, as expressed in the
various written submissions and during the Procedural Consultations,
the Tribunals provided the following clarifications:

The Tribunals are not like a criminal court tasked with punishing acts
of corruption as such. Their mandate is that of resolving disputes
concerning the JVA and the GPSA and specifically the Respondents’
request seeking the avoidance of these two agreements on grounds of
corruption. 15

The Tribunals added:

For the reasons previously explained, the Tribunals have exclusive
jurisdiction to make these determinations. They are conscious of the
responsibility that flows for them from their exclusive jurisdiction and
from their general obligations as ICSID tribunals. This may lead them
to take their own initiatives in the evidentiary process in accordance
with the ICSID Arbitration Rules; but they must preserve and protect
the adversarial nature of ICSID proceedings, which requires that each
Party clearly state its case and identify the evidence on which it relies
so that the other Party has the opportunity to address this case.

The Respondents have affirmed that “BAPEX and Petrobangla now
have evidence to demonstrate that both the JVA and GPSA were
procured by corruption”. On the basis of this affirmation, the

15 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 3.

23

84.

85.

86.

Tribunals have decided to suspend the proceedings on the remaining
issues in these arbitrations and to give priority to the examination of
the Respondents’ Corruption Claim. In doing so, they may take their
own initiative in the evidentiary process on these issues; but in the
interest of a rational and efficient conduct of the proceedings and in
view of their adversarial nature, the Tribunals are of the view that
any requests by the Parties that the Tribunals take such initiatives
must be justified with particularity. In any event, the scope of the
evidentiary enquiry must be limited to the issue that has to be
decided, namely whether the two agreements were procured by
corruption. 16

Concerning the Targeted Period, the Claimant had questioned in its
submission of 8 August 2016 that this period should include the
negotiations for the GPSA; in their view there was no factual basis for
examining the period following the conclusion of the JVA. The
Respondents had argued that the conclusion of the GPSA was not a
necessity and that, irrespective of the price agreed in the GPSA,
Petrobangla granted an advantage to the Claimant by concluding the
GPSA. The Parties developed their positions further during the
Procedural Consultation on 10 August 2016, prior to the Tribunals’
resolution of the issue in Procedural Order No 15.

Having considered the Parties’ positions and argument, the Tribunals
explained as follows in that Order:

The Tribunals note that the principal focus of the corruption enquiry
pertains to the circumstances of the conclusion of the JVA and the
allegation that it was procured by acts of corruption attributable to
Niko. The Parties agree that the relevant period begins sometime in
2001 and continues until the conclusion of the JVA on 16 October
2003. The Tribunals moreover accept the Respondents’ observation to
the effect that this period should be extended to the time immediately
following signature of the JVA, in the event that evidence emerges of
payments triggered by it.

Thus the relevant period of time comprises the years 2001 to 2003 as
well as the period immediately following the conclusion of the JVA
until the end of the first quarter of 2004 (“Targeted Period”).17

Concerning the GPSA, the Tribunals explained that, in their view,

16 Procedural Order No 15, paragraphs 4-5.
17 Procedural Order No 15, paragraphs 7 and 8.

24

87.

88.

89.

... the conclusion of this agreement with Petrobangla was a necessity
once the Feni Field started to produce gas. The critical issue therefore
is, in the present understanding of the Tribunals, not the conclusion
of the GPSA in and of itself, but its terms.

Concerning these terms and the negotiations related to them, the
Tribunals stated:

Concerning the GPSA negotiation period (from May 2004 to the
conclusion of the GPSA on 27 December 2006), the Tribunals note
that, given their present state of understanding, the critical issue was
the price Niko would receive for the gas delivered. Niko had requested
a price of US$2.35/MCF. However, Petrobangla and _ the
representatives of the Government involved in the negotiations were
prepared to pay no more than US$1.75/MCF; they made no
concession and the price eventually agreed in the GPSA was
US$1.75/MCEF. As revealed by the Respondents in these arbitrations,
this price is substantially below that paid during the period from 2004
to 2015 to other suppliers of gas. The Respondents have not shown
any undue advantage procured to Niko through the GPSA. 18

The Tribunals thus decided not to include the time during which the the
GPSA was negotiated in the Targeted Period; they saw “no justification for
ordering document production for the period relating to the GPSA
negotiations”. They pointed out, however, that

... the Tribunals have not taken a final view in this respect, and the
Parties are not precluded from providing evidence and argument
relating to the GPSA negotiation period. In other words, the Tribunals
remain prepared to reconsider their position if they are shown that it
is justified.

Finally, the Tribunals fixed in Procedural Order No 15 the steps in the
procedure and the Procedural Timetable. They considered that the
allegations on which the Corruption Claim is based were raised by BAPEX
in its Memorial on Damages, dated 25 March 2016; such issues had been
raised already during the proceedings on jurisdiction and were further
discussed in exchanges following BAPEX’s Memorial on Damages. The
Tribunals, therefore, had envisaged that a single round of submissions
would be sufficient. Upon the Respondents’ request, however, the
Tribunals

18 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 10.

25

90.

91.

92.

... decided to adjust the draft Procedural Order and in particular the
proposed procedural timetable so as to afford the parties an
opportunity to comment further on the substance of the Corruption
Claim and the procedural options taken by the Tribunals. In
particular, they wish to afford the Respondents the opportunity to
develop their position on the Corruption Claim within the scope of the
enquiry defined by the Tribunals and to provide justification of their
request of enlarging this scope beyond the limits provisionally defined
in the present Procedural Order.!9

The timetable ordered provided for a Memorial on the Corruption Claim
by the Respondents, preceded by simultaneous document production
and indications on persons available for testimony at the Hearing and
followed by the Claimant’s Counter-Memorial. Prior to the second round
of written submissions (Respondents’ Reply and Claimant’s Rejoinder), a
Status Conference was scheduled. After the second exchange a Pre-
Hearing Conference was scheduled to take place in Paris, from 24 to 28
April, with 29 April 2017 in reserve. Post-Hearing Submissions were
reserved.?°

2.4.4 Issues concerning the collection of evidence (Procedural Orders

No 14 and 15)

In Procedural Order No 13 of 26 May 2016, the Tribunals invited the
Parties to produce to the Tribunals information and documents in
relation to the negotiation and conclusion of the JVA and the GSPA.

With their Response to Procedural Order No 13, the Respondents
submitted on 14 June 2016 lists of persons and documents related to the
negotiations of the JVA and the GPSA. They also suggested sources of
further evidence, and in particular:

(i) the Gowlings Information as mentioned in their letter of 7 June
2006;

(ii) investigations by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and
the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench that “handled the Niko corruption
matter in Canada” [the “Canadian Investigations”); and

19 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 6.

20 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 66.

26

93.

94.

95.

(iii) witnesses mentioned in the Charge Sheet of the Anti-Corruption
Commission (ACC).

The Claimant’s 14 June 2016 submission commented on the
Respondents’ requests of 14 May 2016. It provided an account of the
negotiations, explaining that these negotiations occurred well over a
decade ago and that Niko “ha/s/ very different personnel in management
today”; it announced that it was “continuing to work diligently to gather
and examine relevant correspondence” and sought clarification with
respect to the “document lists/production” sought by the Respondents
and the other procedural issues.?!

In Procedural Order No 14 of 29 July 2016, the Tribunals gave
directions on several issues, including the Canadian Investigations and
the Duggan Affidavit (see below Sections 2.4.5 and 2.4.6): With respect
to documentary evidence, the Tribunals accepted that the description
of documents given by the Respondents were relevant places to seek
evidence; they wished to proceed along the lines indicated in the
Respondents’ request. They noted the Claimant’s complaint about the
“grossly overbroad” scope of the Respondent’s request but concluded that
the searches which the Claimant was conducting were successful to some
extent. The Tribunals invited the Claimant in a first stage:

i To rovide information about the status of the research
P
concerning the documents requested by the Res, ondents];
g q Y sp

(ii) | To provide information about their system of payments in and
to Bangladesh so as to identify possible criteria for a more
focused search of relevant documentation;

(iii) To state its view concerning the “narrow parameters” that
should be applied in the context of the Tribunals’ examination
of the Corruption Claim;

(iv) To inform the Tribunals about its knowledge concerning the
Gowlings Information.

The Tribunals invited the Respondents to inform them “about the
respondent companies’ record-keeping practices and provide lists of
relevant documents” .??

27

96.

99.

With respect to the persons that had previously been named by the
Parties, the Tribunals invited the Parties

i) To identify the function of each of the named person during the
Y g
period relevant for the contract negotiations and specify the
period during which this function was occupied;

(ii) | To provide information about the role of the named person in
the negotiations of the GPSA and JVA and in the decision of
BAPEX and Petrobangla to enter into these agreements;

(iti) To identify the present function and domicile of each of these
persons and the manner in which they can be contacted.

Responding on 8 August 2016 to the directions in Procedural Order No
14, the Claimant explained that its identification and retrieval of relevant
files, while still ongoing, had advanced to the point that it was in a
position “to respond reasonably promptly to a suitably focused
documentary evidence request’. It provided explanations about its
Bangladesh Payment Systems, before and after the conclusion of the
JVA.

Concerning the documents to be produced by the Respondents, the
Claimant suggested that this production should also “include
communications and other records (both internal and with any
Government representative, entity or instrumentality) regarding the
negotiation of the Framework of Understanding (the “FOU”) and the
Marginal Fields Evaluation (the “MFE”).

In this response of 8 August 2016, the Claimant accepted that the
requested productions “encompass records in its possession relating to
payments (if any) made to or communications with (if any), the individuals
identified’ by the Respondents in their letter of 10 May 2016, with the
exception of Qasim Sharif. With respect to the latter, the Claimant
pointed out that he was the principal of the Claimant’s agents in
Bangladesh until the execution of the JVA and served thereafter until late
2005 as Niko’s president. It would be “neither reasonable nor
proportionate to require production of all correspondence with Mr. Sharif
during the Targeted Period’. The Claimant suggested that the enquiry be

23 Procedural Order No 14, section 2.2.

28

limited to payments to him or to Stratum and communications regarding
payments to or from the other individuals identified by the
Respondents.2+

100. With respect to the Gowlings Information, the Claimant stated that it was
aware that “an extensive review was undertaken by and under the
direction of Gowlings, in conjunction with other external advisors, in
connection with the RCMP’s investigation into alleged corruption”. It added
that “certain material was provided to Gowlings by the Canadian
authorities pursuant to standard Canadian criminal procedure disclosure
processes” and that this disclosure “was made subject to a strict
undertaking limiting the use or disclosure of that information to the defence
of the offences with which [Niko Canada] was charged”. It added that it
had “undertaken diligent and reasonable enquiries so as to be in a position
to respond to a proportionate and properly focused document production
request’.

101. Finally, the Claimant identified in its 8 August 2016 submission the
persons that could give evidence and specified their roles. It added the
names of three persons that had given evidence in the form of affidavits
in the BELA Proceedings, each concluding “under oath that the JVA was
valid and that none of the Government, Petrobangla or BAPEX was
involved in any fraud or misconduct in entering into the JVA”.

102. In its response to the Tribunals’ directions in Procedural Order No 14
concerning the collection of evidence, the Respondents explained in
their comments on 8 August 2016 the system of correspondence and
administrative records. They added that the ACC seized from both
Respondents the original correspondence and note sheet folders related
to Niko; “BAPEX and Petrobangla kept a copy of most, but not all, of the
seized correspondence”; and “some documents were lost or misplaced”
when BAPEX moved offices.

103. The Respondents prepared a list of “what appeared to be the most relevant
documents to provide an account of the negotiations of the JVA and GPSA”,
consisting of 33 items. They requested more specific guidance from the
Tribunals regarding the types of company records the Tribunals believe
might be relevant.

24 Claimant's letter of 8 August 2016, p. 3.

29

104.

106.

107.

Relying on the World Bank Module on Planning an Investigation of
Corruption, the Respondents described the acquisition and analysis of
financial information to “follow the money” as a “key aspect of a corruption
inquiry”. They requested.

... financial documents showing transfers or payments of funds to
Bangladesh, including from or on behalf of Niko to Mr Qasim Sharif,
Mr AKM Mosharraf Hossain, Mr Giasudding Al Mamun, and Mr Selim
Bhuiyan, among others. The study of financial information to track
payments that might have been used for corruption must be done by
specialized financial experts “including financial investigators and
experts in financial analysis, [and] forensic accountants [...]. Thus,
Respondents reserve their right to have a financial expert review all
financial information presented by Niko.?5

In these comments the Respondents went a step further and requested
that

... Niko be ordered to make its financial records available to an
independent financial expert for review. Respondents are prepared to
appoint an expert for this purpose and would, of course, agree to have
Niko appoint an expert as well. Respondents also believe it would be
useful for the Tribunals to appoint its [sic] own expert or experts.

With respect to witnesses the Respondents provided an updated list of
the persons involved in the negotiations of the JVA and GPSA (Annex B).
They added, however, that they had “doubts about the availability of the
persons named” and explained that they had “reached out to some of the
persons named to obtain the updated contact information, and many of
them have made it clear that they are unwilling or unable to appear before
the Tribunals to testify”.

Concerning possible witnesses on the side of Niko, the Respondents
mentioned “Edward Sampson, the Executive Chairman of Niko’s parent
company who worked closely with Mr Ohlson” who had died in 2004. They
added that at the end of 2013 Mr Sampson had retired from his role as
Chairman, CEO and President of Niko Canada, but remained one of the
largest individual shareholders. The Respondents requested that “the
Tribunals order Niko to provide contact information for Mr Sampson’.

25 Respondents’ letter of 8 August 2016, p. 4; the quoted passage refers to the World Bank, Module 4, RLA-
181.

30

108. The Respondents also explained that Mr Sharif had a large online
presence and his contact information in the United States was available
and that they could provide this contact information. They made the
following request:

If Niko is unable to produce [Mr Sharif] as a witness, Respondents
request that the Tribunals make a request under the laws of the
United States (28 USC 1782) for the district court where Mr Sharif
resides to order him to give his testimony in these proceedings.?°

and

[that] Mr Sharif be called as a witness, and if necessary use the law
of the United States (28 USC 1782) to compel his testimony.?”

109. Further evidence could be obtained according to the Respondents from
the files of the ACC. They asserted that

... the ACC is an independent entity and has been unwilling to share
information that it intends to use in pursuing the criminal charges in
Bangladesh. Petrobangla and BAPEX consider that this evidence is
essential to the Tribunals’ inquiry into the Corruption Issue. [...]
According to the Application for Production of Evidence submitted by
the writ petitioner [in the Alam Proceedings, see below Section 2.5] an
individual consultant to the ACC, Mr. Ferdous Khan, has “substantial
evidence of corruption in procurement of the Impugned Agreements”
in his possession. The evidence in Mr. Khan’s possession includes
shared evidence from the Bangladesh, United States, and Canadian
law enforcement investigations. Because this evidence is part of the
ACC investigation, without authorization from the ACC or a
Bangladeshi court order, such evidence is not available to
Respondents or these Tribunals. If the court orders it, then the
information should be released and be available for these Tribunals.

110. The Respondents complained that Niko opposed the request by the Writ
Petitioner and added that he had withdrawn the application requesting
to compel Mr Khan to produce evidence. The Respondents requested that
the Tribunals

Facilitate access to the evidence in Mr Ferdous Khan’s possession by
issuing a declaration that could be presented to the court hearing the

26 Respondents’ letter of 8 August 2016, p. 6.

114.

Writ Petition that the evidence should be produced and any order
compelling the production of evidence would not violate the Tribunals’
19 July Decision [the Decision on Exclusivity, see below Section 2.5].

In Procedural Order No 15 the Tribunals considered these requests in
light of the Parties’ written requests and the explanations provided during
the Procedural Consultations of 10 August and 1 September 2016.

With respect to the production of documents, some issues had been
resolved in the Procedural Consultations. Procedural Order No 15 had
left the timing of the production to be fixed, and the question of the
financial records also had to be decided.

The Tribunals noted the Claimant’s declaration that, prior to the
establishment of its branch in Bangladesh during the latter half of 2003,
all payments to Bangladesh were made to Stratum and that Stratum
reported on the use of the funds so received. The Claimant had offered to
produce the corresponding records as part of the document production.
The Respondents considered this as insufficient and requested the
appointment of financial experts, as explained above. The Tribunals took
the following position:

The Tribunals consider that the production of the records concerning
payments to Stratum are a useful start for the investigation; but they
accept the Respondents’ view that it cannot be excluded that
corruption payments took other routes, in particular through
companies of the Niko Group other than the Claimant..

The Tribunals examined how the Respondents’ justified concern could be
met “in the most effective and least disruptive manner’. They reached the
following conclusion:

During the September 2016 Procedural Consultation the Claimant
stated that it was prepared to produce complete records of all
payments to Bangladesh made by any of the companies of the Niko
Group. The Tribunals accept this production as a possibly sufficient
measure in the production of financial records; but they reserve the
right to consider the adequacy of this approach, once the production
has been made and the Respondents have had an opportunity of
commenting thereon. In particular, the Tribunals reserve the right to
order a statement of the auditor of the Niko Group, as it had been
announced in the draft of the present Procedural Order prior to the
September 2016 Procedural Consultation.

32

115.

116.

117.

In Procedural Order No 15, the Tribunals considered that the Niko Group
produced consolidated accounts for the fiscal years ending on 31 March
and concluded that any payment from a company of the Niko Group to
third parties in Bangladesh must be reflected in these consolidated
accounts. They advised the Claimant to make the necessary preparatory
arrangements so that the auditor may produce on short notice

. a statement identifying any payments during the fiscal years
ending 31 March 2001 to 31 March 2004 which the Niko Group made
to beneficiaries in Bangladesh, including Stratum, identifying each
beneficiary and the amounts received. In view of these directions, the
Tribunals see no need, at this stage, to make further directions
concerning the financial records of the Niko Group.

With respect to witnesses, the Tribunals noted the Claimant’s
confirmation that it would make available for testimony Mr Hornaday, Mr
Adolph, and Mr Goyal. It invited the Claimant to present witness
statements describing their testimony and to ensure their presence at the
Hearing. With respect to Mr Goyal, whom the Claimant had presented as
“head of finance”, the Tribunals ordered that his “... witness statement
shall include a description of the payments made to Bangladesh during the
Targeted Period’.

The Tribunals also gave the directions concerning other possible
witnesses. They

... orderfed] the Claimant to seek to obtain a Witness Statement from
Mr Sampson as well as his agreement to attend the Evidentiary
Hearing as a witness; if the Claimant is unable to do so, it shall
describe the steps it has taken to obtain the Witness Statement and
Mr Sampson’s appearance at the hearing;

. note[d] the Claimant’s statement that it has no control over Mr
Sharif, has no contact with him and did not know his whereabouts.
At the September 2016 Procedural Consultation, the Claimant
confirmed that Niko had no contact with Mr Sharif for many years.
The Respondents state that they were able to locate Mr Sharif in
Houston, Texas. The Respondents are invited to obtain a Witness
Statement from Mr Sharif and ensure his appearance at the
Evidentiary Hearing. The Tribunals note the Respondents’
explanations concerning the possible objections by reason of Mr
Sharif’s earlier role as agent and officer of companies of the Niko
Group. They instruct the Claimant to deliver to the Respondents no
later than 14 October 2016 a declaration in the name of all companies

of the Niko Group by which Mr Sharif had been engaged as agent or
officer, releasing him of all obligations which would prevent him to
provide the above described Witness Statement and to appear at the
Evidentiary Hearing. If the Respondents nevertheless are unable to
obtain from him a Witness Statement and to procure his presence at
the Evidentiary Hearing, they shall describe the steps they have
taken in this respect;

Concerning the affidavits from the BELA Proceedings, the Tribunals

. note/d] the affidavits of Mr Imaduddin, Mr Hossain and Mr Nurul
Islam, presented in the BELA proceedings and mentioned in the
Claimant’s first letter of 8 August 2016. These affidavits shall form
part of the record of the present arbitration; both Parties are invited to
contact these persons with the objective of ensuring their appearance
at the Evidentiary Hearing; if they are unable to do so, they shall
describe the steps taken;

The Tribunals also considered the witnesses on the Respondents’ side
and persons who had been included in their “Annex B”. The Tribunals

.. note/d] the list of possible witnesses attached to the Respondents’
letter of 8 August 2016 and the Respondents’ statement that they
reached out to some of these possible witnesses but that “many of
them made it clear that they are unwilling or unable to appear before
the Tribunal to testify”. At the August 2016 Procedural Consultation
the Respondents were unable to identify which persons had been
contacted and which of them declared their unwillingness or inability.
They were also unable to provide such information at the September
2016 Procedural Consultation. The Respondents are invited to
identify by Thursday 27 October 2016 the persons on their list whom
they have contacted and indicate those who are prepared to testify
before the Tribunals and to appear at the Evidentiary Hearing; this
identification shall indicate the subject matters including the time
period which the testimony is expected to cover. The Tribunals will
then inform the Respondents whom of the persons so identified they
require to present a Witness Statement and to appear at the
Evidentiary Hearing. The Respondents’ right to present Witness
Statements of other persons is reserved.

Finally, the Tribunals addressed the Respondents’ request concerning
the evidence of Mr Khan and which had been further discussed at the
August 2016 Procedural Consultation. They reached the following
conclusion:

34

121.

122.

123.

124.

The Tribunals understand the explanations provided by the Parties
about Mr Khan’s evidence in the sense that he does not have any
direct knowledge of the JVA and the GPSA nor of the alleged
corruption; but that he is said to have in his possession evidence on
such alleged corruption. There is no information about the evidence
which he is said to have, except that Professor Shamsul Alam, in his
application to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, asserted that Mr
Khan had in his possession “substantial evidence of corruption in
procurement of the Impugned Agreements”.

In these circumstances, the Tribunals see no reason to pursue this
allegation any further but leave it to the Parties to produce any
relevant evidence which Mr Khan may have.

2.4.5 Requested intervention with the Canadian authorities

In the proceedings on the Corruption Claim, the Respondents referred
repeatedly to the investigations conducted by the Canadian authorities
and requested the Tribunals to intervene with these authorities to gain
access to the evidence assembled in the course of these investigations.

A first request was made by the Respondents in their submission of 14
June 2016, proposing as source of information “the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police [RCMP] and the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench that
handled the Niko corruption matter in Canada’, and suggesting an
application “under the Canada and Alberta Evidence Acts to obtain
testimony of witnesses in Canada and documentation from the Canadian
proceedings and investigations”. The Respondents explained that

The RCMP undertook an investigation of a breadth and depth which
is not possible in the context of ICSID proceedings. According to
Corporal Duggan, the Niko investigation involved assistance of the
United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, the City of London
Police, the World Bank, and the United States Department of Justice,
eight completed Mutual Legal Requests, 16 Production Orders, and 20
people interviewed in six different countries.

These explanations relied as sole basis on a PowerPoint presentation by
Corporal Duggan, which the Respondents produced as Exhibit R-290.

The Tribunals considered the Respondents’ suggestion in their
Procedural Order No 14. They noted that Corporal Duggan’s presentation

35

identified as the bribe which these investigations revealed the two gifts
which were the grounds for the conviction in 2011. They also noted in
the Agreed Statement of Facts for that conviction, that “The Crown is
unable to prove that any influence was obtained as a result of providing
the benefits to the Minister.”?8 The Tribunals concluded:

It results from these documents that the Canadian investigations
have been completed and that they established the two bribes just
mentioned and the absence of proof for any influence being obtained
as a result of these bribes. This information is known to the Tribunals
and has been examined in detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction.

The Tribunals have no reason to believe that, by examining the
evidence gathered by the Canadian authorities, they would be able to
discover cases of bribes by Niko which had escaped the attention of
the Canadian authorities. The Tribunals therefore see no useful
purpose in requesting from the Canadian authorities information and
documents gathered in the course of the Canadian investigations.

The Tribunals will pursue their investigation of the Corruption Claim
by considering other evidence.

125. On9 August 2016, the Respondents filed a request for reconsideration
of the decision in Procedural Order No 14 regarding evidence from the
Canadian investigation. They requested that the Tribunals

... reconsider their decision not to request information and documents
gathered in the Canadian investigation

and

... obtain and review all evidence of corruption in the procurement of
the JVA and the GPSA, including the evidence gathered in the
Canadian investigation and explained in the Duggan Affidavit.?9

126. The Respondents announced in that reconsideration request that they
intended to produce an expert opinion of Mr Scott C. Hutchison, a
barrister and former Canadian Crown prosecutor (1989 to 2005), on the
“legal significance of a plea bargain (referred to as ‘resolution agreement’)
in Canada’; they did submit this opinion on 12 August 2016.

28 Agreed Statement of Facts, In the Court of Queen’s Bench of Alberta, 23 June 2011, Exhibit JD C-15,
paragraph 58.
29 Respondents’ Request for Reconsideration of 9 August 2016, paragraphs 16 and 27.

36

127. The Respondents argued that the conviction of Niko was the result of a
“resolution agreement” and that such an agreement does not allow the
conclusion that no other acts of corruption had been discovered. Relying
on Mr Hutchinson’s opinion they argued:

while the decision to proceed with a charge is a signal the
prosecutor believes that he or she can prove that the case beyond
reasonable doubt, the opposite is not true: a decision not to proceed
does not permit an inference that the Crown does not have a provable
case with respect to other changes, especially if that decision is part
of a resolution agreement. In the context of a resolution discussions,
the Crown may decide not to pursue charges that will present
significant legal and logistical challenges. °°

 

 

128. Mr Hutchinson himself stated that the charge against Niko “moved
forward in an atypical fashion” and that, in the circumstances, “it is not
possible to know whether or not there were other possible allegations that
the police and Crown ‘walked away from’ as quid pro quo within the
efficient resolution agreement presented to the Court’. He went on to
discuss the “many reasons why a prosecutor might, quite properly,
determine not to proceed with a charge or potential charge in the context of
resolution discussions’. He described the “overriding question [...] by
reference to whether, in view of all the circumstances (including any
charges to which the accused is prepared to plead guilty), it is in the public
interest to pursue the charges to verdict’. He then gave three concrete
examples, stating that the list is not exhaustive. These examples related
essentially to a balance between the charges to which the accused
pleaded guilty and the state resources needed to prosecute any remaining
allegations. When considering “marginal value” of prosecuting any
“remaining allegations”, the Crown will take account of “any increased
penalty or social labelling that might be achieved”. In other words, the
Crown

. may determine that allegations which are marginal or which will
present significant legal or logistical challenges to prove may be
withdrawn or not proceeded with as part of a broader resolution
agreement.3!

129. The Respondents also argued that different standards of proof applied to
Canadian prosecutors who must meet the standard of “beyond

37

132.

133.

reasonable doubt’, while in international arbitration the lower “balance
of probabilities” standard applied.

The Claimant responded on 19 August 2016 and opposed the request.
It argued that the probative value of evidence and the question whether
evidence should be produced is “exclusively for the Tribunals’
appreciation”. The Claimant rejected the Respondents’ “speculation as to
what was in the mind of the Crown in entering into the resolution
agreement with Niko Resources Ltd.” and denied that there is any
evidence in the record “that the Canadian authorities declined to address
other alleged incidents of corruption they felt could be substantiated”. The
Claimant argued that the Respondents have failed “to disclose the totality
of the information at their disposal regarding their corruption allegations”
and stated that the Respondents have “not identified what specific
information they believed the Canadian authorities might have that would
be relevant to their allegation of bribery relating to the JVA or GPSA”.

The Tribunals addressed the Request for Reconsideration in their
Procedural Order No 15. They examined whether there was any
justification to reconsider their conclusion in Procedural Order No 14
that there was no reason to believe that “by examining the evidence
gathered by the Canadian authorities, they would be able to discover cases
of bribes by Niko which had escaped the attention of the Canadian
authorities” or that these authorities “declined to address other alleged
incidents of corruption that they felt could be substantiated”.

The Tribunals first recalled that the evidence before them did not contain
any indication that the proceedings before the Canadian authorities were
concerned with any acts of corruption other than the two gifts to the
Minister. They noted that Niko Canada was not even charged in relation
to any other alleged incidents of corruption. They referred again to the
passages in the Agreed Statement of Facts that the Crown was “unable to
prove any influence obtained as a result of providing the benefits to the
Minister’ and, when fixing the sentence, had taken into account that Niko
had “never been convicted of a similar offence nor had it been sanctioned
by a regulatory body for a similar offence”.

Having noted Mr Hutchison’s observations about the impossibility to
know whether there were or were not any allegations about other acts of

corruption, the Tribunals nevertheless examined the scenario on which

38

the Respondents rely. The Tribunals sought to determine whether it is
likely that there might be evidence that the Canadian authorities did not
pursue and which could be of relevance for the Tribunals’ examination of
the Corruption Claim. The Tribunals explained:

The Respondents allege payments of large sums of money which
actually caused the conclusion of these two agreements. Quite
obviously, had such charges been established, they would have
justified a punishment significantly more severe than that which the
Alberta Court deemed adequate for the two gifts of a total value of
less than 200’000 Canadian Dollars and which the court found had
no effect on the conclusion of the agreements. The argument of the
Respondents thus amounts to saying that the Canadian authorities
may have disregarded the large payments by which Niko obtained
illegal advantages and, instead, based themselves merely on the two
gifts to the Minister which remained without effect on the award of
the GPSA. The assumption is difficult to accept, unless one were to
assume that the other acts of corruption were so uncertain and so
difficult to establish that it was not in the public interest to engage the
required resources to pursue them.

The Tribunals conclude that any other evidence gathered by the
Canadian authorities either does not concern corruption of the gravity
alleged by the Respondents or was so far from constituting conclusive
evidence that it would not have justified the devotion of substantial
public resources to pursue a prosecution. This conclusion is relevant
for the Tribunals’ decision, even if one considered possible differences
in the standard of proof,3? an issue that has not yet been decided by
the Tribunals.

134. The Tribunals also considered the feasibility of the process by which the
Respondents requested the Tribunals to address themselves to the
Canadian authorities. The Respondents suggested that the Tribunals
make a request under the Canada and Alberta Evidence Act “to obtain
testimony of witnesses in Canada and documentation from the Canadian
proceedings and investigations”. According to the Respondents, the
“Canadian courts grant such requests on the principles of international
comity if the evidence sought to be obtained is relevant, necessary, not
otherwise available, and identified with reasonable precision’.*> The
Claimant argued that the Respondents “grossly oversimplified” the
processes on which the Respondents relied. It pointed out that the

32 See Hutchison Opinion, pp. 6 and 7.
33 Respondents’ Responses to Procedural Order No 13, paragraph 42.

39

135.

136.

137.

138.

document to be requested would invite action by an “agent or
instrumentality of the Crown”. The requests therefore would bring into
play issues of immunity or prerogatives. The Claimant also listed a
number of other difficulties that the proposed process would have to face.

The Tribunals took no view on the feasibility of the process to obtain the
evidence from the Canadian authorities but noted

. that such a request would engage the Tribunals in proceedings
before domestic judicial authorities, an action which does not fall in
the ordinary activity of arbitral tribunals. [...]

The Tribunals noted the Respondents’ affirmation that “BAPEX and
Petrobangla now have evidence to demonstrate that both JVA and GPSA
were procured by corruption’ 3+ and continued:

While the Tribunals have the power to take their own initiative in the
evidentiary process on the Corruption Claim, they are of the view that,
before applying to other jurisdictions with applications concerning
proceedings that have been closed by these other jurisdiction|s], the
Tribunals must give priority to the evidence announced by the
Respondents and other sources available to the Tribunals. As they
are in no position to assess the reliability or indeed the very existence
of any relevant evidence of the type said to be in the hands of the
Canadian authorities, the Tribunals do not consider it justified to
intervene with these authorities in the manner called for by the
Respondents.

For these reasons the Tribunals denied in Procedural Order No 15 the
Respondents’ request concerning the intervention with the Canadian
authorities. The Tribunals did, however, reserve the right to reconsider
this decision once they had evaluated arguments and evidence produced
by the Parties in respect of the Corruption Claim.

2.4.6 The Duggan Affidavit

In its Memorial on Damages of 25 March 2016, BAPEX explained that its
counsel “recently obtained a redacted version of the affidavit of the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police (“RMCP’) official conducting the investigation of

34 R-MC, paragraph 60.

40

139.

140.

141.

142.

Niko’s activities, Corporal Kevin Paul Duggan’.*> The redacted version of
the affidavit was produced with this memorial as Exhibit R-213.

The Respondents produced correspondence between counsel in which
the Respondents requested the Claimant to cooperate with the
Respondents in an application to Justice Tilleman of the Court of the
Queen’s Bench in Alberta to remove some or all of the redactions.
According to advice which the Respondents said they received from
Canadian counsel, “the process to obtain an order from Justice Tilleman
will be significantly quicker if Niko cooperates and does not oppose the
removal of the redactions related to it’.3®

In response, the Claimant announced that it would address in the
arbitration the application that BAPEX had made and which the
Claimant had been invited to comment. In any event the Claimant
considered the Respondents’ application as “spurious, improper and an
abuse of the arbitration process” .37

The Respondents then requested on 10 May 2016 “an order from the
Tribunals to compel Niko’s cooperation to seek [a less redacted] version
from the Canadian courts”. In its response of 14 June 2016, the Claimant
objected to this application, denying any evidentiary value of the affidavit
which it described as a “recitation of second- or third-hand hearsay
concerning events of which the author had no personal knowledge”. The
Claimant also insisted on the prejudice which the use of the Duggan
Affidavit would cause to Niko “who will never have any opportunity to
cross-examine Corporal Duggan or the hearsay declarants whose
statements he references”.

The Tribunals dealt with the Respondents’ request in Procedural Order
No 14. They noted that there were no indications that the Claimant would
have an opportunity to question Corporal Duggan or the persons quoted
by him. They understood that the information contained in the affidavit
related to the Canadian investigation. For the reasons considered in the
context of their decision concerning this investigation, the Tribunals

Respondents on 10 May 2016.
37 Letter by the Claimant to the Respondents, dated 21 April 2016, produced in the Arbitration by the
Respondents on 10 May 2016.

41

concluded that it “cannot be expected to provide useful additional evidence
for acts of corruption allegedly committed by Niko in Bangladesh”.
Therefore, the Tribunals denied the Respondents’ request.

143. The Respondents applied on 9 August 2016 for reconsideration of the
Tribunals’ ruling concerning the Duggan Affidavit. Relying on the
explanations of Mr Hutchison, referred to above, the Respondents
explained that the Tribunals could make an application to a court under
the Canada and Alberta Evidence Act “to order the examination of?
Corporal Duggan and “command [his] attendance [...] for the purpose of
being examined’. Corporal Duggan thus would be available for cross-
examination and Niko’s due process concerns could be resolved. They
also argued that the Duggan Affidavit described several interviews in his
Affidavit relating to events beginning in 2002 that are entirely separate
from the 2005 acts for which Niko pleaded guilty.

144. The Claimant responded on 19 August 2016, contesting the probative
value of the Affidavit and arguing that the appearance for cross
examination of Corporal Duggan would not resolve the due process issue.

145. The Tribunals dealt with the Respondents’ Application for
Reconsideration in Procedural Order No 15. The Tribunals noted that, in
order to have Corporal Duggan appear, the Tribunals would have to
engage in proceedings with the Canadian Courts.

[BJut there is no indication that such proceedings could ensure his
appearance at the place of the hearing. It would seem that the hearing
would have to be moved to Canada or Corporal Duggan would have
to be heard in the absence of the Tribunals by letters rogatory or
similar proceedings.*8

146. Concerning the evidentiary value of the Affidavit, the Tribunals observed:

As far as can be seen from the redacted text, the “Affidavit” is not
direct evidence of the events which it describes but an account of
statements by others. Examining him as witness, therefore, does not
solve the serious concerns of due process if the Tribunals were to rely
on his testimony without having heard the authors of the declarations
on which Corporal Duggan relies.39

38 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 39.
39 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 38.

42

147. They noted that “Corporal Duggan’s ‘Affidavit’ is correctly described as
‘Information to Obtain a Production Order’ in an investigation of an offence
by “an official of the Government of Canada.”*°. The Tribunals considered
the explanations by Mr Hutchison in the opinion that the Respondents
had presented and concluded:

Such a document is presented in support of an application for a
production order or, as described in the relevant title of Mr Hutchison’s
opinion, “orders preauthorising investigative activities”. Their purpose
is to present to a judge with information on oath and in writing “that
there are reasonable grounds to believe that a federally created
offence had been committed and the production order would likely
result in evidence of that offence being produced”. Mr Hutchison
explains that the standard of “reasonable grounds to believe” is
“similar to the American concept of probable cause”. In other words,
what was required of Corporal Duggan, in Mr Hutchison’s opinion,
must be distinguished from the standard of proof required for a
conviction on criminal charges.*!

148. The Tribunals also considered the offence to which Corporal Duggan’s
Affidavit related:

...the offence identified in Corporal Duggan’s “Information to Obtain a
Production Order” is that of “an official of the Government of Canada”
(presumably a Senator), who used his office “to lobby on behalf of a
private company” (presumably Niko Resources Ltd.). There is no
evidence in the file to show that the production order requested by
Corporal Duggan was ultimately issued, as stated by Mr Hutchison.
If the order had been issued, it would, in the words of Mr Hutchison,
justify Corporal Duggan’s reasonably grounded belief that the
Senator did indeed commit the lobbying offence of which he was
suspected. While it may contain the description of actions by Niko
Resources Ltd. or the Claimant (assuming that the relevant redacted
passages concern them), the “Duggan Affidavit” does not concern an
offence of any of the Niko companies. For this reason, too, its
probative value is less than what the Respondents attribute to it.4?

149. The Tribunals concluded by denying the request for reconsideration.

2.4.7 Confidentiality Issues (Procedural Order No 17

On 8 August 2016, the Claimant raised concerns as to “the collateral use”
of documents from the arbitration in other proceedings, specifically in
Writ Petition No 5673 of 2016 brought by Professor Alam against Niko
and others before the High Court Division of the Supreme Court.*3 The
Claimant sought protective measures against the use of documents and
information from the present arbitration proceedings in these other
proceedings (the “Collateral Use”). The Claimant requested the Tribunals

... to impose protective measures relating to the use or disclosure of
documents or information exchanged in connection with the Tribunals’
examination of the Corruption Claim.

Complaints in this respect had been raised by the Claimant already in its
Request for Provisional Measures of 19 May 2016 by which it sought inter
alia a declaration that these Tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction over
specified questions, a request that the Tribunals addressed in their
Decision on Exclusivity of 19 July 2016.

The issues of Collateral Use and confidentiality, as they had been raised
in the Request for Provisional Measures and then in the application of 8
August 2016, were subject of several submissions by the Parties
concerning the modalities of a confidentiality regime and were discussed
by the Tribunals and the Parties during Procedural Consultations in
August and September 2016. Provisional directions were given by the
Tribunals in Procedural Order No 15 of 7 October 2016. The Tribunals
then established, by Procedural Order No 17 of 11 January 2017, the
confidentiality regime to be followed.

During the 1 September 2016 Procedural Consultation, the Parties
informed the Tribunals that they had reached “an agreement in principle
regarding restrictions concerning the access to the record of these
Arbitrations (section 9 of Draft Procedural Order No 15, ‘Collateral Use’).
The Parties indicated that they would file further information by 15
September 2016.”44

In Procedural Order No 15 of 7 October 2016 the Tribunals noted that no
such further information had been received and invited the Parties to

43 The proceedings are discussed below in Section 2.5.
44 Summary Minutes, paragraph 5.

44

“report forthwith on the progress achieved” concerning confidentiality
restrictions. The Tribunals ordered

[ujntil further notice, the Respondents’ Counsel are instructed not to
make any document produced by the Claimant available to any
person other than the legal team of their law firm.45

155. In November 2016 the Parties reached agreement on the terms of a
Confidentiality Undertaking which Mr Carl F. Jenkins of Duff & Phelps,
financial expert retained by the Respondents, executed on 9 November
2016 and pursuant to which Confidential Information was provided to
him. This Confidentiality Undertaking was produced by the Claimant as
Appendix A to its letter of 9 December 2016. The Claimant explained in
this letter:

Through successive drafts over the ensuing days [following 1
November 2016] the parties negotiated the content for a
confidentiality undertaking of the experts as the basis upon which the
Claimant’s financial information would be provided to the
Respondents’ experts for their review and potential use in the
arbitration. On 14 November Niko was provided with a copy of the
confidentiality undertaking that had been executed by Carl F. Jenkins
of Duff & Phelps on 9 November.

156. When the Respondents filed on 23 November 2016 their Memorial on
Corruption, they provided a version in which footnote 153 was redacted,
that is to say the only passage which used information identified as
confidential. The footnote referred to two supporting exhibits (R-374 and
R-375) also identified as confidential. As the Parties were unable to agree
on the manner to proceed with the confidential information and exhibits,
the Tribunals instructed the Parties as follows:

Until the confidentiality issue is agreed by the parties or decided by
the Tribunals, the confidential documents and all their content may
be made available to the Respondents’ counsel only.

157. On 9 December 2016 the Claimant provided further explanations about
the Parties’ attempt to reach agreement on the terms of the confidentiality
order and proposed a draft of Procedural Order No 17, setting out a
comprehensive confidentiality arrangement. The Respondents

45 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 69.

45

158.

159.

commented on 15 December and suggested amendments to the
Claimant’s draft.

On 11 January 2017, the Tribunals issued Procedural Order No 17
addressing the then pending confidentiality issues. Relying on the
proposals made by the Parties in their consultations, the Tribunals
adopted the following definition of the term “Confidential Information”
and “Derivative Materials”:

i. The Confidential Information of the Claimant (“Confidential
Information”) comprise all records and information of the Claimant
produced or provided by it, and its current or former employees,
agents or consultants, in relation to the Corruption Claims further to
Procedural Order No 15 of 7 October 2016 or any subsequent
Procedural Orders issued by the Tribunals, and shall include witness
statements of current or former employees, agents and consultants of
the Claimant, and such other information as agreed by the parties or
directed by the Tribunals, but shall not include such records and
information that:

a) are already in or come into the possession of the Respondents;
or

b) are or become part of the public domain other than through or
as a result of any act or omission on the part of the Respondents
or any of the persons that have Confidential Information with the
agreement of the Parties;

ii. Any records of any nature whatsoever, including without
limitation pleadings, memorials, witness statements, submissions of
the parties and transcripts of examinations of witnesses and the
parties' submissions, that incorporate or quote from the Confidential
Information (“Derivative Materials”) shall be treated as Confidential
Information.

The Tribunals considered the need for a confidentiality regime and
appropriate modalities. They noted that confidential documents from
these Arbitrations had found their way into the hands of a third person
and were used to support claims by unrelated persons in court
proceedings against the party having produced the documents. The
Tribunals found this undesirable and disruptive to the present
proceedings and noted that the Respondents themselves were prepared
to make commitments with the objective of preventing such leaks in the
future. As no solution other than that adopted by the Tribunals in

46

160.

161.

Procedural Order No 15 and quoted above had been agreed or proposed,
the Tribunals concluded that “protection by regulating access to
Confidential Information must be provided in some form”. The Tribunals
also noted that the Parties had been able to agree on a specific
Confidentiality Undertaking for the Respondents’ expert.

The Tribunals also noted that in their Memorial on Corruption the
Respondents relied only on two of the confidential documents produced
by the Claimant and referred to them only in a footnote. The Tribunals
concluded:

In these circumstances, it appears to the Tribunals that, at this stage
of the proceedings, the confidentiality issue, while remaining of
importance, has a rather narrow scope of practical application. The
Tribunals are conscious that a confidentiality regime which they might
order must strike a balance between the interest of the Claimant in
the protection of the Confidential Information produced in the
arbitration and the interest of the Respondents in making use of these
documents in an effective manner.

Given the difficulties which the Parties had in devising a general
confidentiality regime striking such a balance and the limited
practical scope which the issue has had until now, the Tribunals
concluded that this balance can be struck more effectively on a case
by case basis, considering the needs in specific situations as they
may arise and following the approach in the partial agreement
actually reached by the Parties.

The Tribunals concluded that a general confidentiality regime did not
appear necessary at that stage; but they reserved the possibility to
reconsider their position if the evolution of events so required. The
Tribunals concluded with the following order:

(i) It is confirmed and clarified that access to the Confidential
Information disclosed by the Claimant to the Respondents shall be
restricted to the lawyers and staff of Foley Hoag concerned with the
Corruption Claim.

(ii) This restriction applies also to Derivative Materials in which the
content of this Confidential Information is reported or reproduced.

(iii) An exception is provided for disclosure according to the agreed

Confidentiality Undertaking executed by Mr Jenkins of Duff & Phelps
on 9 November 2016.

47

(iv) Further written submissions filed in these proceedings containing
Confidential Information shall be submitted to the ICSID Secretariat
which will transmit the same to the Members of the Tribunals, to
counsel for the Claimant and to Foley Hoag.

(v) If the Respondents wish to make such Confidential Information
and Derivative Materials available to any other person, including
personnel of BAPEX and Petrobangla, they shall seek agreement with
the Claimant. Failing such agreement, the Respondents may apply to
the Tribunals, as described above.

162. On 29 January 2017 the Respondents wrote to the Tribunals, applying
for a reconsideration of Procedural Order No 17. They argued:

As a general matter, counsel for Respondents notes that this
Procedural Order, forbidding us from sharing information filed in the
arbitration with our client, prejudices our ability to present our claims
and violates principles of procedural fairness.

163. The Respondents argued that, when Professor Alam obtained material
from the Arbitrations, there was no confidentiality obligation in place and
they argued that there was a “growing consensus that transparency and
public access to pleadings should be the rule’. The Respondents
concluded:

Counsel for Respondents strongly believe that an order allowing all
relevant parties (the Parties to the arbitration, all counsel, and
witnesses) to view and use documents submitted to the Tribunals for
the purposes of this arbitration with the understanding that such
documents should be kept confidential and must not be shared with
others would be sufficient. There is no justification to leap to the
extraordinary measure of ordering that one Party to the arbitration is
prohibited from reviewing the pleadings, exhibits, and witness
statements while the other Party has full access to all the materials.

164. The matter was discussed during the Status Conference on 30 January
2017. At that occasion the Claimant explained that the disclosure of
documents during document production

. was made further to Procedural Order No 15, relying in particular

on paragraph 69. If Respondents wished to use the documents, such
use is subject to the procedure and restriction in this provision.*©

46 Summary Minutes of the Status Conference, paragraph 11.

165. The Claimant accepted, however, that its Counter-Memorial produced on
11 January 2017 and the witness statements and expert reports could
be released to the Respondents without redaction, except for the witness
statement of Mr Adolph which it wished to review before such release.
Concerning 14 documents identified as “confidential” in the Claimant’s
index of exhibits, the Claimant proposed the use of an electronic portal
which would allow designated persons in the Respondents’ organisation
to inspect the documents on a screen without being able to make copies.

166. At that occasion it was agreed that the Parties would follow up rapidly on
these proposals, including questions of jurisdiction in case of a breach of
the undertaking.

167. When the Tribunals considered the matter again in their Procedural
Order No 18, they noted that

Contrary to what had been envisaged at [the Status Conference], no
proposal for a modification of the arrangements concerning
confidential documents was proposed or agreed.

The Tribunals conclude that no change is required. The Tribunals’
instructions remain in force.*7

2.4.8 The Parties’ written submissions on the merits of the Corruption
Claim

168. Following the Procedural Timetable set in Procedural Order No 15, the

Parties filed the following written submissions on the merits of the
Corruption Claim:

2.4.9 The 30 January 2017 Status Conference

175. The Procedural Timetable set out in Procedural Order No 15 provided that
a status conference would be held between the first and the second
exchange of written submissions. The Tribunals explained the purpose
of this conference as follows:

As pointed out above, the Tribunals have reserved, in light of the
Respondents’ objections to certain of the Tribunals’ decisions on the
scope of the enquiry of the Corruption Claim, to reconsider their scope
decisions once they have received the Parties’ Memorials. For this
purpose and in order to examine the status of the case on the
Corruption Claim after the first round of written submissions, the
Tribunals wish to use some of the time initially reserved for the
Evidentiary Hearing. Therefore, the Tribunals have decided to hold a
Status Conference on 30, with possible extension to 31 January 2017
at which the Tribunals wish to consider with the Parties the case as
it presents itself in the light of the Parties argument and evidence. The
Parties are invited to reserve these two days for an in-person meeting
in Paris. Depending on their assessment of the issues as they emerge
from the first exchange of Memorials, the Tribunals reserve, however,
the possibility, in consultation with the Parties, to adopt other
modalities for this meeting, such as a video or telephone conference.
They will inform the Parties of the modalities envisaged within the
week following the receipt of the Claimant’s Counter-Memorial.*%

179.

When filing its Counter-Memorial on 11 January 2017, the Claimant took
the initiative and made proposals for the issues to be discussed at the
Status Conference, including the justification for hearing certain
witnesses. In the correspondence that followed, the agenda items for the
conference were considered. In view of the issues that had been identified,
the Tribunals and the Parties were of the opinion that an in-person
meeting was not necessary and agreed that the conference be held by
telephone on 30 January 2017.

Concerning the subjects to be discussed at the conference, the Tribunals
informed the Parties that they did not see the need for reconsidering the
scope of the enquiry of the proceedings on the Corruption Claim. The
Tribunals nevertheless invited the Parties to file a request for
reconsideration of the scope of the enquiry if they saw the need for it.

The Respondents presented their views on 17, 26 and 29 January 2017,
objecting to the agenda items proposed by the Claimant. They insisted on
extending the scope of the enquiry, seeking “to acquire additional evidence
confirming Niko’s corruption, including, wherever possible, facilitating
gathering of evidence from all available sources and in coordination with
domestic courts and investigators” (i.e. the Canadian investigation and
financial records between 2001 and 2006). They requested that the
Status Conference focus on these aspects.

At the 30 January 2017 Status Conference the principal agenda items
discussed were

e the weight to be given to statements by persons without direct
knowledge of the specific facts relating to these cases or those not
appearing at the April 2017 Hearing,

e the Respondents’ compliance with the Tribunal’s Decision of 19 July
2016,

e Petrobangla’s compliance with the Third Decision on the Payment
Claim,

e the scope of the Tribunals’ enquiry on the Corruption Claim,
including the Targeted Period,

e requests to the Canadian authorities and appointment of a forensic
expert,

e the treatment of confidential documents and protective measures,

52

180.

181.

182.

e organization of the Pre-Hearing Conference, and
e witness notification deadlines.

Several of these items form part of issues that continued to be considered
in subsequent procedural steps and shall be dealt with in their respective
context.

Summary Minutes were prepared and submitted in draft form to the
Parties. A final version of these Summary Minutes dated 4 February
2017, taking account of the Parties’ comments, was distributed to the
Parties.

2.4.10 The Respondents’ New Application for an Intervention by the
Tribunals before the Canadian Courts and Procedural Order No
18

In their letter of 26 January 2017, the Respondents had insisted again
that the Tribunal take initiatives with the Canadian authorities. They
wrote:

Specifically, Respondents maintain that the Tribunals should
reconsider, as envisaged in Procedural Order No. 15, seeking
evidence from the Canadian investigation and ordering Claimant to
open its financial records for the entire relevant period (2001-2006) to
review by an independent financial expert. Regarding the Canadian
investigation, Respondents were able to obtain a lot of evidence from
Mr. Khan, but there is a good deal of evidence that he could not
provide. For instance, we do not have 1) the video of the Qasim Sharif
interview for which there is a transcript in the record or the transcript
or video of a prior interview of him; 2) the transcript or video of an
interview of Selim Bhuiyan; 3) transcripts or videos of the numerous
other interviews conducted in the Niko investigation; or 4) other
evidence of corruption in obtaining the JVA and GPSA referenced by
Corporal Duggan in his affidavit. [...]

Therefore, Respondents request that these items be the main items for
discussion on the Status Conference agenda, as originally indicated
by the Tribunals.

The matter was indeed discussed extensively at the Status Conference.
On that occasion, as recorded in the Summary Minutes:

53

The Claimant stated that the Respondents have obtained extensive
evidence from the Canadian investigations and have even produced
in these arbitrations documents bearing the stamp of the RCMP. In
the Claimant’s view, there is no reason to believe that a request by
these Tribunals to the Canadian authorities would produce any
additional evidence which the Respondents could consider helpful for
their case. The Canadian investigation did not lead to any prosecution
other then what has been already considered by the Tribunals.

183. The Respondents were given the opportunity to provide the records of
their earlier enquiries they made with the RCMP and the response they
received. They were also invited to provide argument about the powers of
an ICSID Tribunal to make such enquiries with domestic authorities and
information about any precedent in ICSID arbitration.

184. The Respondents provided such explanations on 3 February 2017 and
requested the Tribunals to “issue a letter to the Alberta Court of Queen’s
Bench requesting the assistance of the Court in obtaining ... evidence”.

185. With their explanations, the Respondents provided correspondence
between a Canadian law firm and the Department of Justice of Canada.
This included a request for “the assistance of Corporal Duggan with
respect to potential testimony before ICSID” of 5 July 2016, and a reply
from the Department of Justice of 19 October 2016 stating that “the
RCMP is unable to accede to the request in these circumstances, and the
RCMP members are not in a position to voluntarily attend the arbitration” .*9

186. In their letter of 3 February 2017 the Respondents also described the
process which they requested the Tribunals to follow:

The process would be for the Tribunals to issue a letter to the Alberta
Court of Queen’s Bench requesting the assistance of the Court in
obtaining evidence. Respondents would then engage Canadian
counsel to make an application in the Court for an originating order
based on the letter. The RCMP would be named as respondent and
Niko Canada would be given notice and an opportunity to be heard.
Canadian counsel informs us that, if Niko and the RCMP do not
oppose the application, the process could be completed in a matter of

49 Annex A to the Respondents’ letter of 3 February 2017.

54

187.

188.

weeks. If there is opposition, the process could take many months, as
hearings would be necessary to decide upon the application.

The Respondents’ explanation continued by offering “to provide the
Tribunals with a draft of a letter to the Canadian Court...”.5° The Tribunals
invited the Respondents to provide such a draft which the Respondents
did on 10 February 2017.

In the draft, the Respondents proposed a request addressed to the
Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, on ICSID letterhead but signed by the
President of the Tribunals, requesting from that court an order “to compel
the testimony and production of documents from the RCMP and testimony
from Corporal Kevin Duggan of the RCMP ...”. The orders requested from
the Alberta Court were drafted as follows:

1) The RCMP will provide the Tribunals with the following
documents and video recordings obtained or created during the
course of the investigation of Niko and that are still in its possession:

a. Video of interview of Mr. Qasim Sharif on December 16, 2010
and video and transcript of interview of Mr. Qasim Sharif on
May 20, 2008;

b. Video and transcript of interview of Mr. Selim Bhuiyan;

c. Videos and/or transcripts of interviews of former Chief
Financial Officers mentioned at paragraph 25 of the Duggan
affidavit;

d. Video and/or transcript of March 12, 2009 interview of
former accounting employee mentioned at paragraph 93 of
the Duggan affidavit;

e. Video and/or transcript of December 11, 2009 interview of
former employee mentioned at paragraph 115 of the Duggan
affidavit; and

f. Transcripts or videos of other interviews conducted in the
Niko investigation and other evidence of corruption in
obtaining the JVA and GPSA referenced by Corporal Duggan
in his affidavit.

59 Letter of 3 February 2017, p. 5.

55

189.

190.

191.

192.

2) Corporal Duggan will be examined under oath before the ICSID
Tribunals and counsel for BAPEX and Petrobangla and then cross
examined by counsel for Niko in relation to his investigation of Niko
that led to its conviction on June 24, 2011.

3) The place, timing, and method of the requested production and
Corporal Duggan’s examination will be determined by the Tribunals
in consultation with the RCMP to be as convenient to Corporal Duggan
and the RCMP as possible.

The draft which the Respondents requested the Tribunals to address to
the Alberta Court also provided:

The Tribunals are willing to cooperate with Corporal Duggan and the
RCMP as much as possible to avoid any undue burden. Such
cooperation could include payment of the cost for Corporal Duggan’s
appearance or having him provide testimony by video link from
Calgary.

and

The Centre is willing, as able, to provide similar assistance to the
Courts of Canada when requested. The Centre, as reimbursed by the
parties, is willing to reimburse the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench for
any costs incurred in executing this request.

The Claimant responded to the Respondents’ letter on 15 February 2017,
arguing inter alia that “the [ICSID] Convention does not contemplate ICSID
Tribunals’ resort to national courts’. The Respondents commented on 28
February 2017.

The Tribunals addressed the Respondents’ request of 26 January 2017,
as amplified by the 3 February 2017 letter and in the draft letter to the
court of 10 February 2017 (collectively referred to as the Application) on
23 March 2017 in Procedural Order No 18. Other issues which were
also addressed in the order will be considered separately below.

The Tribunals considered the Parties’ conflicting views concerning the
powers of an ICSID Tribunal to make a request to the Alberta Court as in
the Respondents’ application. The Respondents relied on ICSID
Arbitration Rule 34.2 (b) and Article 43 of the Convention and quoted
Professor Gary Born on the availability of judicial assistance; but they
conceded that they “have not been able to find a reported case in which

56

an ICSID tribunal has sought such assistance”.5! The Claimant contested
the Respondents’ interpretation of Arbitration Rule 34.2 (b). Arguing that
the Convention is a stand-alone dispute settlement regime, the Claimant
concluded that “contrary to accepted practice in commercial arbitration,
resort to national courts for provisional measures in aid of arbitration is not
permissible unless the parties explicitly agree to it’.5?

193. The Tribunals considered the Parties’ argument and concluded:

There is no dispute between the Parties that, in commercial
arbitration, tribunals may seek assistance from national courts in the
manner described by Professor Born. Such intervention may be seen
as inherent in a tribunal’s function if and to the extent to which this
is necessary to a fair examination of the parties’ cases.

Nevertheless the Tribunals are mindful of the fact that the system of
arbitration created by the Contracting States to the ICSID
Convention was particularly designed to operate without the
involvement of national courts. Consent to arbitration under the
Convention is, unless otherwise stated, ‘deemed consent to such
arbitration to the exclusion of any other remedy’.>° The ability to seek
provisional measures from national courts in aid of arbitration, which
is a common feature of commercial arbitration, is excluded from ICSID
arbitration unless the parties have stipulated otherwise in their
instrument of consent.5+

Article 43 of the ICSID Convention, which deals with evidence,
specifically empowers an ICSID tribunal, under paragraph (a) to call
upon the parties to produce documents or other evidence. In this
regard the Convention lays the primary responsibility on the parties
to assist the Tribunal by bringing forward the evidence necessary to
the fair disposition of the dispute.

The Contracting States also permit the ICSID tribunal to visit the scene
“and conduct such inquiries there as it may deem appropriate.” It
contains no general power upon tribunals to compel the appearance
of witnesses. A proposal to include such a power was defeated
during the Convention’s framing.55 The Convention does not confer an
express power upon tribunals to seek the assistance of national

196.

courts in this regard and consequently creates no international
obligation on the part of Contracting States to render assistance to
an ICSID tribunal in evidence gathering.

For the purpose of this decision, the Tribunals are content to
assume, without finally deciding, that, despite the absence of such
an express power, an ICSID tribunal may, in an appropriate case
where it is satisfied that a request under Article 43(a) of the
Convention would be unavailing, be entitled to issue a request for
assistance in the collection of evidence to a national court or (in what
would likely be the more suitable step) to permit a party to pursue
such a request directly. Although no such power is expressly
included in the Convention and Rules, neither is it expressly
excluded. It might be said that such a request for assistance, when
issued under the control of the tribunal, supports its exclusive
jurisdiction and does not undermine it, since it submits no part of
that jurisdiction to the national court. Article 44 does confer upon
tribunals broad powers to decide any question of procedure not
covered by the Convention and the Rules.

Having assumed in favour of the Respondents that they had the power to
request the assistance of national courts, the Tribunals considered
whether the Respondents had made out a sufficient case to exercise it in
the present case.

The Tribunals considered prior requests by the Respondents for similar
interventions and the information which the Respondents provided for
the evidence in their possession and that which they requested. They
noted the close cooperation between the Canadian and Bangladeshi
authorities and the exchange of information between them and the
assistance from Mr Khan. Specifically, the Tribunals did not accept the
Respondents’ argument that the Respondents lacked access to the
evidence from the joint Bangladeshi/Canadian investigation. They noted
that the Respondents had not alleged that any of the items of evidence
they seek to obtain through the Alberta Court were not included in the
‘vast majority’ of the evidence gathered and exchanged in this
investigation.

Furthermore, the Tribunals considered the probative value of the
evidence which the Respondents sought through the Tribunals’
assistance. They noted the Claimant’s comments on the items of evidence
identified by the Respondents on 10 February 2017:

58

197.

198.

199.

... [the Respondents] are seeking further hearsay evidence together
with testimony of someone with no direct knowledge of the
circumstances from whom they seek to elicit opinions about the
hearsay evidence. Indeed, the Respondents now even go so far as to
submit in their 10 February letter that the Tribunals should hear from
Corporal Duggan because he heard the individuals interviewed and
can provide his views as to their credibility and the credibility of their
unsworn statements. To accede to such an approach would make a
mockery of the concepts of fairness and due process, and would
discredit the arbitral process.5®

In conclusion, the Tribunals noted:

By their letter of 10 May 2016, the Respondents expressed their belief
that no “further evidence is needed for the Tribunal to grant [their]
requests for relief”. Since then they have produced additional
documents and witness statements. They have described the very
broad investigation of Niko’s corruption conducted jointly by the
Bangladeshi, Canadian and U.S. authorities and provided evidence
gathered during the course of this investigation. They have failed to
demonstrate that the evidence for which they now request the
Tribunals’ assistance is not available to them and, if it were not
available to them, what steps they have taken to obtain it in
Bangladesh. In any event the limited probative value of the requested
evidence does not justify the intervention of the Tribunals in a complex
and most unusual procedure.

For these reasons, the Tribunals dismissed the Respondents’ Application
requesting the Tribunals to make the request to the Court in Alberta as
presented in the Respondents’ draft letter of 10 February 2017.

2.4.11 Other Pre-Hearing Evidentiary Issues addressed in Procedural

Order No 18 and the Pre-Hearing Conference on 10 April 2017

 

In its letter of 11 January 2017, the Claimant proposed as one of the
Agenda Items at the Status Conference issues concerning the Witness
Statements of Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte Griffith produced by the
Respondents:

The Tribunals’ weighting of hearsay statements and, in particular:

56 Letter of 15 February 2017, pp. 6-7.

59

200.

201.

202.

203.

a. Whether it will be useful for “witnesses” with no personal
knowledge of the facts they address, such as Mr. F. Khan and Ms.
LaPrevotte Griffith, to testify at the Evidentiary Hearing and for Niko
to prepare to cross-examine such “witnesses”;

b. Whether the Tribunals will assign any weight to statements by
persons who will not testify at the Evidentiary Hearing (e.g., Messrs.
Mamoon, Bhuiyan and others). This may inform the scope and content
of the Parties’ second round of submissions.

The Respondents objected to such restriction in the Tribunals’
consideration of the evidence. They insisted that the named persons be
heard, arguing that they are “entitled to marshal the evidence and make
arguments without a referee making calls mid-play”.57

At the Status Conference the Claimant clarified that it does not seek the
exclusion of the evidence in question; rather the Claimant argued that
no or very little weight should be given to any such evidence. According
to the Claimant, advance clarification of this aspect could be of
assistance to the Claimant when deciding whether to call Mr Khan and
Ms LaPrevotte Griffith to testify at the April 2017 Hearing, or otherwise
assist in the preparation of its forthcoming submission. The
Respondents announced during the Status Conference their intention of
calling Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte Griffith to appear for testimony at
the April 2017 Hearing.

The Tribunals considered the issue further in Procedural Order No 18.
They noted the Claimant’s objections concerning the hearsay nature of
much of the two witness statements. They pointed out, however, that
they are not bound by strict rules on the admissibility of evidence and
stated that the Claimant’s observations would be taken into
consideration at the assessment of the testimony.

The Tribunals concluded

The Tribunals admit the appearance of Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte
Griffith as witnesses. Following the procedure previously adopted
for other witnesses, witness statements are accepted as direct
testimony if the witnesses appear for examination when called upon
to testify.

60

204.

205.

206.

207.

In their letter of 26 January 2017 the Respondents requested that the
Targeted Period be extended beyond the time fixed in Procedural Order
No 15. The request was discussed at the Status Conference on 30
January 2017.

In support of their request the Respondents argued that, prior to the
BNP government, Niko laid the grounds for corruption and for making
payments with the objective of corruption. While confirming that the
corrupt system within the Government was limited to the period under
the BNP Government between 2001 and 2006, the Respondents stated
that the Sheikh Hasina Government was not corrupted but individual
actors may have been. The Respondents referred to Footnote 36 at p. 17
of their Memorial on the Corruption Claim. They continued to hold that
the FOU was tainted by corruption and requested that the Targeted
Period be extended to the time prior to the BNP Government. The
Respondents stated that, after the end of the BNP Government in early
2007,5§ no corrupt payments were received by the Government from
Niko.

The Claimant did not support the requested extension of the Targeted
Period. Concerning the reference to Footnote 36, the Claimant observed
that the official identified in Footnote 36 of the Memorial is an
Honourable Advisor to the Prime Minister on Energy, a position he has
held since 2009.59

The Tribunals considered the issue in Procedural Order No 18. They
repeated what they had pointed out on previous occasions; they are not
in the position of a criminal investigator or court charged with punishing
acts of corruption. Their mandate at this stage of these Arbitrations is
to determine whether the JVA and the GPSA were obtained by
corruption. Acts of corruption which were not causal for the conclusion
of the two agreements do not appear to be decisive for this determination.
The Tribunals concluded:

It is the Respondents’ case that BAPEX and Petrobangla themselves
were not corrupted but were instructed by corrupted members of the
Government to execute the JVA and the GPSA. No such corrupted

58 The Claimant disagreed with the Respondents’ timing of the end of the BNP coalition. They state that
BNP left office in October 2006 followed by a caretaker government.
59 Summary Minutes of the Status Conference, paragraph 10.1.

61

208.

209.

210.

Government instructions are alleged for the period prior to the BNP
government. The Tribunals, therefore, see no justification for
extending their examination beyond the Target Period, as defined in
Procedural Order No 15. They do not exclude, however, evidence
outside the Target Period and will consider it.

In the correspondence leading up to the Status Conference on 30
January 2017, the Respondents made an application concerning the
appointment of a financial expert by the Tribunals. In their letter of
26 January 2016, they wrote:

Specifically, Respondents maintain that the Tribunals should
reconsider, as envisaged in Procedural Order No 15, [...] ordering the
Claimant to open its financial records for the entire relevant period
(2001-2006) to review by an independent financial expert.

Further to the Tribunals’ directions in Procedural Order No 15, the
Claimant had produced financial records. The Respondents considered
these productions as insufficient. They produced with their letter of 23
November 2016 the opinion of Duff & Phelps, “a global financial firm
with expertise in complex valuation, disputes, compliance and regulatory
consulting, among other topics”. In this opinion, the firm stated:

The documents provided by Niko were unorganised, incomplete, and
do not meet the level of documentation needed to conduct a proper
corruption examination....©°

The matter was discussed at the 30 January 2017 Status Conference:
the Claimant stated that it did not see any justification why it should
commission such a forensic expert concerning its own records.
Concerning the Respondents’ complaint about the insufficiency of the
records on Niko’s payments which it produced, the Claimant asserted
that the Respondents did not argue that channels of payment other than
those indicated by the Claimant were used; rather they questioned the
Claimant’s explanations concerning the use of the funds transferred to
Bangladesh. The Respondents confirmed that, other than the note by the
Duff & Phelps, their experts had not produced any opinion on the
documents disclosed by the Claimant. The Respondents stated that the
Claimant had not provided the necessary information that experts would
need to conduct an analysis of possible corruption emanating from Niko’s
accounts.

69 Duff & Phelps Memo, 22 November 2016, pp. 2-3.

62

211.

212.

Following the Status Conference, the Respondents made an application
on 14 March 2017, specifying the documents that experts would need to
conduct an analysis of possible corruption emanating from Niko’s
accounts. They requested that the Tribunals order the production of the
following groups of documents:

(i) | complete records of all payments to Bangladesh, including to third
parties made by any of the companies of the Niko Group, pursuant
to the Claimant’s commitment which had been recorded in
Procedural Order No 15;

(ii) relying on the opinion of Duff & and Phelps, “complete records”
should include: “copies of checks, deposit slips, records of
electronic transfers, invoices to support payments, receipts, and
general legers to understand the payments between Niko,
Stratum, Mr Sharif, Mr Bhuiyan, Mr Mamoon and _ others,
including payments through intermediaries and foreign accounts;”

(iii) all reports by Mr Sharif or Stratum “on the use of the funds” received
from Niko;

(iv) correspondence and other documents, pertaining to payment
negotiations or received by Five Feathers for any service
provided.®!

The application was considered in Procedural Order No 18. The Tribunals
referred to the Witness Statements of Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte
Griffith, from which the Tribunals concluded that the joint investigation
included extensive examination of the financial transactions of the Niko
Group. They observed that the Respondents had access to this
investigation and noted that, by some of the evidence produced with
their submissions on the Corruption Issue, the Respondents had shown
that at least some of the evidence now requested from the Claimant was
in their possession. The Tribunals concluded:

In these circumstances, the Tribunals see no justification to order the
Claimant to produce documents of a type that had been made
available already by the Niko Group and others during the course of
the joint investigation and of which at least the “vast majority” is in

the possession of the Bangladesh authorities and available to the
Respondents. The request is denied.

In their letter of 14 March 2017, the Respondents also requested that the
Claimant produce “records in any format held by or available to Claimant
or its former counsel pertaining to the ACC, Canadian, or U.S.
investigations of Niko’s activities in Bangladesh”. The request concerning
these criminal investigations resumed an earlier request raised by the
Respondents on 10 May 2016 and discussed above in particular in
Section 2.4.1 in the context of the “Gowlings Information”. The request
had had been addressed by the Claimant already in its response of 8
August 2016.

In Procedural Order No 18, the Tribunals noted that the vast majority of
such records are located in Bangladesh and that some of those
documents had previously been produced by the Respondents in these
Arbitrations. The Tribunals further noted that the Respondents “had not
made any effort to identify with any specificity documents which are
relevant and material for the Tribunals’ decision and to which they do not
have access”. The Tribunals concluded that “/ijn these circumstances, the
Tribunals see no justification for ordering the Claimant to produce the
requested records”.

Finally, the Respondents presented in their letter of 14 March 2017
requests for “Relevant and material correspondence key to Niko’s
corrupt scheme in Bangladesh”. The requested documents were
described as follows:

(i) correspondence, including but not limited to email messages,
not®? sent to or by Respondents, and other documents
concerning

a. the possibility of, prospects for, or possible means of
convincing the relevant government entities to hear and
consider Niko’s proposals;

b. the possibility of, prospects for, or possible means of
securing a JVA without a competitive bid process (i.e.,
the Swiss Challenge process);

©2 The Tribunals presumed that the word “not” is an error.

64

216.

(ii)

(iii)

the possibility of, prospects for, or possible means of
including Chattak East in the JVA;

. Claimant’s contracts with Stratum, including preparatory

drafts;

. any opinion drafted by Claimant’s counsel, Moudud

Ahmed & Associates, in relation to Claimant’s alleged
investment;

Niko’s efforts to propose or support a proposal for the
Ministry of Energy to seek a legal opinion from the
Law Ministry at the time Moudud Ahmed was Law
Minister;

. the rationale behind Niko’s decision to hire Senator Harb;

h. Claimant’s contracts with Mr. Bhuiyan’s company,

Nationwide, including preparatory drafts, and anything
pertaining to the payment negotiated or received by Mr.
Bhuiyan or Nationwide for any service provided and any
discussion of Mr. Bhuiyan’s role in assisting Niko to
procure the JVA and GPSA.

As Claimant already consented to provide, all “records in its
possession relating to payments (if any) made to or
communications with” Barrister Moudud Ahmed, Mr. AKM
Mosharraf Hossain, Mr. Khandker Shahidul Islam, Mr. Selim
Bhuiyan, former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Tareq Rahman,
and Giasuddin Al Mamun; and

Communications, including but not limited to email messages,
regarding the negotiation and finalization of the FoU, the JVA,
or the GPSA, between any company in the Niko group or their
officers and/or agents and Mr. Qasim Sharif.°

In Procedural Order No 18, the Tribunals noted the very broad scope of
the request and pointed out that most of its items did not identify
documents with specificity but described subjects of enquiry. They
added, giving examples, that some of these subjects did not necessarily
imply corruption. They also pointed out that some of the requested
evidence would seem to be available in Bangladesh, irrespective of the
results of the joint investigation, while other subject areas identified in
the request must also have been considered by the Joint Investigation.

63 Numbering as per Procedural Order No 18, paragraph 116, FN 70

65

217.

218.

219.

220.

For these and other considerations set out in Procedural Order No 18,
the Tribunals concluded that they saw

. no justification to initiate now, one year after the Corruption Issue
had been raised by the Respondents, such measures which, at best,
would be duplicative of the joint investigation performed by
organisations of incomparably greater means of investigation.

The Tribunals noted, however, that the production of some of the
documents in the list, as pointed out by the Respondents, had previously
been ordered by the Tribunals. They therefore ordered

(i) the Claimant forthwith to comply with any order for the
production of documents made by the Tribunals that have not
yet been complied with;

(ii) the Respondents to produce within one week of receipt of
this P.O. and by reference to each of the document production
orders made by the Tribunals or accepted by the Claimant, a
list identifying documents that have been received and those
that remain outstanding;

(iii) the Claimant to produce within one week of the receipt of the
list as per the previous paragraph the documents so identified
as outstanding or, for those documents which it does not
produce, the reasons why this is so.

The Tribunals announced:

The Tribunals may draw adverse inferences if it appears to them that
the documents so produced by the Claimant are incomplete and
without convincing explanations for missing documents.

Following these directions, the Respondents produced on 31 March 2017
a list of categories of documents that Niko was said to have failed to
produce. On 7 April 2017, the Claimant responded to the various points
that had been raised in this respect by the Respondent and asserted that
it had “fully complied with all document production orders of the Tribunals
as well as Niko’s commitments to these Tribunals”.

2.4.12 The Pre-Hearing Conference of 10 April 2017 and Procedural
Order No 19

On 10 April 2017, the President of the Tribunals held a pre-hearing
conference with the Parties by telephone to discuss the organisation of
the Hearing on the Corruption Claim. Prior to this telephone conference,
the Parties were invited to propose any items that they wished to have
addressed during the telephone conference.

The following persons participated in the Pre-Hearing Conference: Mr
Michael E. Schneider, President of the Tribunals; Ms Frauke Nitschke,
Secretary of the Tribunals; Mr Barton Legum, Mr Gordon Tarnowsky, Mr
Anthony Cole, Ms Anne-Sophie Dufétre, Ms Marie-Héléne Ludwig and
Mr Brian Adolph for the Claimant; and Mr Derek C. Smith, Ms Erin
Argueta, Ms Melinda Kuritzky, Mr Oscar Norsworthy and Mr Moin Ghani
for the Respondents. The Parties confirmed that they had no objection to
the Pre-Hearing Organisational Meeting being conducted by the President
alone.

During the telephone conference the Parties agreed to a number of
matters concerning the organization of the Hearing. They were invited by
the President to confer following the conference on other questions of
hearing procedure in order to reach an agreement, including time
allocation, sequence of witness examination and _ confidentiality
procedures. The Parties’ agreed proposals in this regard, were
subsequently transmitted to the Tribunals on 13 April 2017, including a
tentative Hearing Agenda.

Summary Minutes of the 10 April 2017 Pre-Hearing Telephone
Conference were also sent to the Parties on 15 April 2017.

Further to the discussion with the Parties during the Pre-Hearing
Conference and the Parties’ subsequent communications, the Tribunal
issued on 15 April 2017 Procedural Order No 19, settling the Hearing
organisation, including Agenda and time allocation principles, witness
examination and confidentiality procedures.

Procedural Order No 19 also addressed issues relating to document
production.

67

228.

229.

230.

Further to the Tribunals’ directions in Procedural Order No 18, the
Respondents had produced on 31 March 2017 a chart identifying, by
reference to each of the production orders, the documents that they had
received and those which, in their opinion remained outstanding. In the
accompanying letter, the Respondents noted the Parties agreement to
produce “relevant documents” as recorded in Procedural Order No 15.
They commented that

Niko provided a small number of documents relevant to the
procurement of the JVA and GPSA, including Board Minutes and
select financial documents [...] However, Niko provided no internal
communications. In particular, Niko provided no record of
communications with Qasim Sharif related to the procurement of the
JVA and GPSDA, except one e-mail that was internally forwarded in
2008 regarding his statement to the Joint Task Force.

The Respondents recognise that prior to Procedural Order No 15 another
e-mail had been submitted (Exhibit C-98, an e-mail of 13 November 1998
with attachment). They insisted on the importance of Mr Sharif for the
JVA negotiations and quoted Mr Hornaday:

Qasim Sharif was undoubtedly Niko’s lead representative in the
negotiations with BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Ministry in relation to
the JVA”.® The most detailed record of the process of procuring the
JVA from Niko’s perspective is likely contained in Mr Sharif’s
communications with Robert Olson, Ed Sampson and others in Niko’s
management.

Pointing to the role of Mr Sharif in Niko’s payments to and in Bangladesh,
the Respondents added “his communications regarding the procurement of
the JVA and GPSA are highly likely to contain relevant and material
evidence related to the Corruption Claim”.

The Claimant responded on 7 April 2017, asserting that “Niko has fully
complied with all document production orders of the Tribunals as well as
Niko’s commitments to these Tribunals.” It addressed each of the
categories of missing documents alleged by the Respondents and
concluded by requesting that the “Tribunals should reject the assertions
made in the Respondents’ 31 March 2017 submission.”

The issue was addressed at the Pre-Hearing Conference:

Responding to the Claimant’s 7 April 2017 letter concerning document
production, the Respondents stated that they disagree with the
position expressed in the letter and continue the production
incomplete; but they do not consider further submissions on the topic
necessary. The Tribunals will examine the matter and will draw the
conclusions as they consider appropriate.

In Procedural Order No 19 the Tribunals noted the following position:

The Tribunals have taken note that the Respondents, having
considered the Claimant’s letter of 7 April 2’17, confirm their view that
the Claimant’s document production was incomplete but see no need
for further submissions on the topic. The Tribunals reserve their
position concerning the question whether the production was complete
and, if they consider it incomplete, reserve the conclusions that may
be drawn from it.

The Respondents then wrote on 17 April 2017 to insist that the
Claimant’s responses to the document production requests were
inadequate. Relying on Procedural Order No 18, where the Tribunals had
announced the possibility of adverse inferences, the Respondents
requested that the Tribunals “draw all appropriate adverse inferences”
and identified three issues where such inferences had to be drawn. The
Claimant objected to the request by its letter of 18 April 2017.

The Tribunals will consider the request below in Section 8.6.

Procedural Order No 19 also addressed the issue that had arisen with
respect to the Respondents’ correspondence with the FBI, forming
part of the United States Department of Justice.

On 6 April 2017 the Respondents had communicated to the Centre for
transmission to the Tribunals copy of a letter to Ms LaPrevotte,
authorising her to testify at the Hearing in the present Arbitrations. The
letter referred to an earlier letter, dated 10 November 2016, which the
FBI had addressed to the Respondents’ counsel, expressing the
authorisation for Ms LaPrevotte to provide written testimony and for that
testimony, dated 20 November 2016 and 15 February 2017. The letter
also specified the limitations in the scope of the authorised testimony and
referred to advice given by the Respondents’ counsel according to whom

69

237.

238.

239.

“in ICSID proceedings the oral testimony of a witness is limited to the scope
of the witness’ written testimony’.

When communicating on 7 April 2017 to the Tribunals its suggestions
for the agenda items of the Pre-Hearing Conference, the Claimant
included an item entitled the “Respondents’ Failure to Produce Documents
Placing in Context FBI Communications”. It explained that the
Respondents “repeatedly rely upon correspondence from the US
Department of Justice/FBI in these proceedings” and mentioned
specifically the letter transmitted on 6 April and Exhibits R-376 and R-
377, two letters from the FBI to the Respondents’ counsel dated 10
November 2016. One of these letters contained the authorization just
mentioned; the other accompanied documents which the FBI provided in
response to a request by the Respondents’ counsel for documents. The
Claimant explained that it had requested the Respondents on 21 March
2017 to produce their correspondence with the FBI but had received no
response. It requested the Tribunals

To order the Respondents to produce the communications with the
Department of Justice/FBI preceding Exhibits R-376, R-377 and the
3 April 2017 letter produced by the Respondents yesterday as well
as the materials referenced in Exhibit R-376.

At the Pre-Hearing Conference on 10 April 2017 the Claimant repeated
the request. The Respondents stated that there may be considerations of
privilege preventing counsel to make the requested disclosure. The
Respondents’ counsel undertook to verify the matter and revert by 14
April 2018.6

In Procedural Order No 19 the Tribunals gave the following instructions:
Further to the Claimant’s request, the Respondents are instructed

(i) To produce to the Claimant by Friday, 14 April 2017 the

documents they received from the FBI as mentioned in the letter of

10 November 2016;

(ii) to list by the same date their correspondence exchanged
with the FBI regarding Ms. LaPrevotte Griffith’s testimony.

exchange at the conference in their letter of 17 April 2017.

70

240.

241.

242.

If the Respondents are of the view that any such document or
correspondence is protected and may not be disclosed to the Claimant
and/or the Tribunals, they shall explain the grounds for such
protection and propose any protective measures which may make
production possible.

The Claimant may comment on the Respondents’ production and
accompanying explanations by Wednesday 19 April 2017.°7

The Respondents wrote to the Tribunals on 17 April, explaining that their
counsel had “consulted regarding privilege and then produced to Claimant
the communications from Foley Hoag to the FBI’. The Claimant produced
this correspondence as Exhibit C-236 with its letter of 18 April 2017.

In their letter of 17 April 2017 the Respondents also raised objections to
the “appropriateness of the timing or content of Claimant’s request for an
order of production of documents from the Tribunals”. With respect to the
request for the production of the documents received from the FBI, the
Respondents explained that they had not understood that a decision
concerning that production had been made and added:

Claimant’s late hour application for an order of production of
documents so close to the hearing is entirely inappropriate. This is a
constantly-shifting fishing expedition regarding Respondents’ efforts
to gather evidence (and not the evidence itself) in the hopes of finding
something to use as a last minute distraction at the hearing.

Respondents have nothing to hide and can provide these documents
to Claimant. However, considering Claimant’ s tactical manoeuvre,
Respondents request that the full Tribunals consider the
inappropriate timing of Claimant’ s request and order that Claimant
not make use of the documents during the hearing. If Niko has
comments on the documents, it may make them in a post-hearing brief
with an opportunity for Respondents to respond in writing.

The Claimant responded on 18 April 2017. It maintained that the
Respondents’ production did not fulfil the requirements of Procedural
Order No 19, pointing out that the accompanying attachments had not
been provided, notably the description of the arbitration attached to the
14 October 2016 e-mail. It also complained that the Respondents had not
produced the “materials they requested from the FBI’ and mentioned
specifically the “opening EC written by Agent LaPrevotte for the

67 Procedural Order No 19, paragraphs 18 and 18.

247.

Bangladesh Corruption ML/Forfeiture case” and “/ajll 302s related to
Salim Bhuiyan, Mosharraf Hossain, Fiver Feathers and Mohamed Khan’.
The Claimant pointed out that it made its request on 21 March 2017;
there was neither a “constantly-shifting fishing expedition” nor any
justification for preventing reference to the documents at the hearing,
once they had been produced.

The issue was then addressed at the Hearing.

Finally, Procedural Order No 19 addressed issues concerning the
treatment of confidential documents at the Hearing. During the Pre-
Hearing Conference the Parties had agreed “to confer on the arrangements
to be made at the hearing with respect to the use of confidential documents
produced by the Claimant’ .®®

The Parties did indeed agree on such arrangements. The Respondents
communicated their agreement by e-mail of 13 April 2017 and the
Tribunals recorded it in Procedural Order No 19. That order provided that
only Foley Hoag retains copies of any confidential documents, no portion
of the Hearing discussing confidential Niko documents need be held in
camera (in other words, party representatives may remain in the room
during discussion of confidential Niko documents). However, a separate
transcript with distribution limited to the Secretariat, Members of the
Tribunals and to Foley Hoag and Dentons will be prepared of such
discussions.

The Tribunals added: “Otherwise, the Tribunals’ instructions on
confidentiality as confirmed by Procedural Order No 18 remain in force.”

In their letter of 17 April 2017, the Respondents explained that by the
quoted agreement, they had not waived any rights with respect to the
decisions of the Tribunals on confidentiality. They added:

Respondents did not by this agreement waive any rights with respect
to the decisions of the Tribunals on confidentiality. Respondents and
Claimant have reached practical arrangements to allow the
proceedings to go forward. However, we maintain our position that
Respondents, their officers, and Boards of Directors should be
provided unfettered access to all materials presented in the course of

68 Summary Minutes, paragraph 4.

249.

these proceedings. This is a fundamental procedural right that must
not be abridged. Counsel for Respondents has withheld documents
marked by Claimant as confidential because I has been ordered to do
so by the Tribunals. This has limited the free exchange of information
between counsel and client.

2.4.13 The Hearing on the Merits of the Corruption Claim (24 to 29 April
2017)

 

A Hearing on the Corruption Claim was held from Monday 24 April 2017
through Saturday 29 April 2017 at the ICC Hearing Centre in Paris.

Besides the three Members of the Tribunals and the Secretary, the
following persons attended the Hearing:

For the Claimant:

e Mr Barton Legum, Mr. Gordon Tarnowsky, Mr Anthony Cole, Ms
Anne-Sophie Dufétre, Ms Marie-Héléne Ludwig, Mr David
Bocobza, and Mr Taylan Aygun of Dentons;

e Mr Mustafizur Rahman Khan of Rokanuddin Mahmud &
Associates;

e Mr Brian Adolph, Mr William Hornaday, and Mr Amit Goyal of
Niko Resources Ltd.; and

e Mr Christopher of Moyes of Moyes & Co.

For the Respondents:

e Mr Derek Smith, Ms Erin Argueta, Ms Diana Tsutieva, Ms
Melinda Kuritzky, Mr Joseph Klingler, Mr Oscar Norsworthy, and
Ms Angelica Villagran of Foley Hoag;

e Mr Moin Ghani; Mr Abul Mansur Md Faizullah and Mr Syed
Ashfaquzzaman of Petrobangla;

e Mr Mohammad Nowshad Islam of BAPEX;

e Mr Ferdous Ahmed Khan, Ms Debra LaPrevotte Griffith, Mr
Khairuzzaman Chowdhury, and Mr Maqbul-E-Elahi; and

73

250.

251.

252.

253.

e Mr Nazimuddin Chowdhury of the Energy and Mineral Resources
Division, Government of Bangladesh.

Mr Ferdous Ahmed Khan, Mr Khairuzzaman Chowdhury, Ms Debra
LaPrevotte Griffith, Mr Maqbul E. Elahi, Mr Brian Adolph, Mr William
Hornaday, and Mr Amit Goyal testified as fact witnesses, and Mr
Christopher Moyes testified as an expert witness. Mr Muhammad
Imaduddin and Md. Nural Islam, who had provided witness statements,
were not called to testify.

The Parties were given an opportunity to examine the experts and fact
witnesses, developed their arguments orally, and responded to questions
from the Tribunals. In the course of the Hearing the Parties introduced
additional documents. All of these are listed in the Summary Minutes of
the Hearing.

Before the start of the examination of Ms LaPrevotte Griffith, the
Tribunals recalled the 3 April 2017 letter from the FBI regarding her
testimony. They pointed out that the restrictions imposed by her
employer would be respected, but that such restrictions might have to be
considered in the assessment of her testimony. In that testimony, she
made a point of not naming certain persons who had otherwise been
identified on the record of these arbitrations.®

An audio recording was made of the Hearing and a transcript was
prepared by Ms Georgina Ford and Mr Ian Roberts of Briault Reporting
Services. The confidentiality arrangements envisioned by Procedural
Order No. 19 were applied in the following manner: no person was
required to leave the hearing room when a confidential document was
referenced; however, the transcript of the entire oral procedure was
treated as confidential material, and delivered only to Dentons and Foley
Hoag at the end of each hearing day. In accordance with the Parties’
agreement, the confidential transcript was later reviewed by the Parties
and a redacted version of the transcript prepared. This redacted version
was distributed to all representatives for the disputing Parties on file with
ICSID. Further to the Parties’ agreement, the audio recording of the
Hearing was provided to the Members of the Tribunals and counsel at
Dentons and Foley Hoag.

69 See Summary Minutes of the Hearing, paragraph 9.

74

254.

255.

256.

257.

With respect to the Respondents’ correspondence with the FBI, as it had
been addressed in Procedural Order No 19, the Respondents produced
documents from this correspondence to the Claimant during the first
hearing day. During the evening hours following Day 1 (24 April 2017),
the Claimant introduced from among these documents a 32-page exhibit
into the record (C-237, “Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of
Investigation”). It was decided that these documents could be referred to
during the hearing and commented on in the post-hearing submissions.

At the request of the Tribunals the Respondents produced a document
entitled “Table of Payments Referenced in R-320”, recorded as Exhibit
RH-14, representing of all payments by Niko or its agents/consultants
which, in the Respondents’ view, the Tribunals have to consider when
examining the corruption allegation. Exhibit R-320, frequently referred
during the Hearing as “spider web”, was presented in a marked version
by the Claimant as Exhibit CH-19. Other documents produced concerned
the area of the gas fields in the JVA, in particular the Chattak field,
including a maps of the area, marked to show the contours of that field
(Exhibit CH-18) and procurement regulations.

Summary Minutes of the Hearing were prepared by the Tribunals and
distributed to the Parties after the Hearing. The Parties agreed on
corrections and redactions to the confidential version of the transcript of
the Hearing on the Corruption Claim as confirmed by the Parties’ email
communications of 2, 6, 17 and 19 June 2017. A redacted version of the
transcript was prepared by the court reporter and distributed to the
Parties on 29 June 2017.

2.4.14 Post-Hearing developments (Procedural Orders Nos 20 and 21

At the end of the Hearing the Tribunals gave directions for the remainder
of the proceedings on the Corruption Claim. These directions were
confirmed and developed in Procedural Order No 20 of 17 May 2017. In
particular the Tribunals fixed the time for the Post-Hearing Submissions.
They invited the Parties to agree on a page limit. The Tribunals instructed
the Claimant to provide information and documents concerning the
Deloitte audit (see below Section 2.4.16).

75

258.

259.

260.

The Respondents were instructed to

3.1 produce any law and regulations that, in their opinion, required
that BAPEX and Petrobangla adopt a competitive process when
concluding the JVA and the GPSA with Niko, in addition to those
which the Respondents have produced already at the hearing (Exhibit
RH-16 “Procurement Manual”) and thereafter (Exhibits R-408
“Manual of Office Procedure” and R-409 “Public Procurement
Regulations 2003” of which the Tribunals confirm receipt);

3.2 identify the provisions in these laws and regulations which in
their opinion do require that this process be followed for the conclusion
of these two agreements;

3.3 identify any petroleum project (for exploration or for
marginal/ abandoned fields) other than the BAPEX/ Niko JVA, which
was awarded after the Second Round of PSC bidding (Exhibit R-212)
to companies not controlled directly or indirectly by the GOB,
indicating for each of these projects whether a competitive procedure
was applied and if so, specifying the modalities and the regulations
applied; and

3.4 identify any GPSA concluded by Petrobangla which was
concluded in a competitive procedure.

[oJ

4.1 produce the proposal from Petrobangla to the Minister, which in
the opinion of Mr Chowdhury must have been made after his
departure from the Ministry (Transcript Day 3, p. 153); and

4.2 clarify whether there is a 1996 regulation on the award of
exploration and production sharing contracts to which reference was
made at the hearing...

The Tribunals also decided that, except for the documents listed in
Procedural Order No 20 or requested by the Tribunals, there shall be no
further evidence produced in the proceedings on the Corruption Claim.
Subject to this exception, the evidentiary record for the proceedings
on the Corruption Claim was closed.

As the Tribunals had announced at the end of the Hearing, a list of
questions was attached to Procedural Order No 20 as Annex A, which
the Tribunals invited the Parties to address in their Post-Hearing

76

261.

262.

263.

264.

Submissions without thereby restricting the questions the Parties wished
to address in their Post-Hearing Submissions (see below Section 2.4.16).

In accordance with the Tribunals’ instructions during the Hearing, the
Respondents notified the Tribunal on 12 May 2017 that they had
undertaken a search for procurement regulations in force leading up to
the signing of the JVA and transmitted two documents which the
Respondents proposed to add to the record: a Manual of Office Procedure
(Purchase) (1978) (Exhibit R-408) and Public Procurement Regulations
(2003) (Exhibit R-409). In response to questions in Procedural Order No
20, the Respondents presented on 22 May 2017 further explanations
about requirements of a competitive process in Bangladesh, in particular
with respect to petroleum projects and produced documents which were
admitted in the record as Exhibits R-410, R-411 and R-412.7° They
explained that they were “unable to find any 1996 regulations on the
award of exploration and production sharing contracts”.

At the Hearing an issue had arisen concerning the correct identification
of Annex E to the January 2003 draft JVA (R-306). On 15 May 2017, the
Respondents submitted a document identified as this Annex E
(numbered Exhibit R-306a7!). The Claimant contested on 25 May 2017
that the document submitted by the Respondents was indeed Annex E to
the January 2003 draft JVA.

On 4 June 2017, the Tribunals issued Procedural Order No 21 which
addressed primarily further proceedings with respect to the Deloitte audit
(below Section 2.4.16). In addition, this procedural order recorded the
production of certain documents and noted the Parties’ agreement on the
word count of the Post-Hearing Submissions. The Deloitte audit issue
and the related claim for privilege was decided by Procedural Order No
22 (see below Section 2.4.16).

The Parties submitted their First Post-Hearing Submissions on 12 July
2017; the Respondents’ submission was replaced on 13 July 2017 by a
corrected version. The Parties had agreed on a limit of 46,000 words for
the first and 30,000 for the second round. Since their first submission
exceeded the agreed page number, the Respondents were ordered to

70 See Procedural Order No 21 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 14.
71 See Procedural Order No 20 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 5.

77

265.

266.

267.

268.

269.

submit a corrected version, respecting the agreed limit; they did so on 20
July 2017. Further to the agreed confidentiality arrangements the Parties
subsequently filed a redacted version of their First Post-Hearing Brief.

On 2 August 2017, the Parties filed confidential, unredacted versions of
their Second Post-Hearing Submissions in accordance with the
procedural calendar established in Procedural Order No. 20. The Parties
filed redacted versions of their Second Post-Hearing Submission, the
Respondents on 4 August and the Claimant on 8 August 2017.

Following these submissions, the Respondents made a further
application concerning the RCMP proceedings which the Tribunals
denied by their letter of 11 September 2017 (see below Section 2.4.17 and
Section 8.3).

A further issue was introduced in the examination of the Corruption
Claim by the Judgement of the High Court Division of the Supreme Court
in the Alam case, delivered orally on 24 August 2017 and in writing on
19 November 2017. The Respondents communicated this judgment to
the Tribunals on 21 November 2017. The Tribunals allowed submissions
concerning the Alam Judgment and its relevance for the Decision on
Corruption. These submissions were filed on 21 November, 11 and 21
December 2017. The Judgment will be discussed below in Sections 2.5
and 6.4.

Procedural Order Nos. 20, 21 and 22 were published on the ICISD
website, as is the case for all decisions of the Tribunals. As they contained
personal identifying information and potentially sensitive financial

2.4.15 The Tribunals’ Post-Hearing questions to the Parties

 

As Annex A to Procedural Order No 20, of 17 May 2017, the Tribunals
put a number of Questions to the Parties as follows:

Following the Hearing in Paris from 24 to 29 April 2017 the members
of the two Tribunals have deliberated and have identified a number
of issues which they invite the Parties to address in their Post-Hearing
Submissions. The list of these issues, which is set out below, is by

78

no means limitative and the Parties are free to address all issues
which they consider relevant for the Tribunals’ Decision on the
Corruption Claim. Where a Party specifically is invited to address an
issue, the other Parties are not precluded from addressing the same
issue.

Most of the issues identified in the present list, or certain aspects of
them, have been argued in the Parties’ prior submissions. The
Tribunals wish to hear the Parties’ explanations on these issues in
the light of the evidence and argument delivered at the April 2017
hearing. To the extent to which a Party wishes to maintain its earlier
position unchanged, it is invited to simply identify the relevant
passages in its earlier submissions, rather than repeating these in the
Post-Hearing Submission. The Parties are invited to identify with
precision the evidence on which they rely in support of their positions.

The questions in the present list appear at this stage of the Tribunals’
reflection to be of possible importance, but they prejudge nothing.

Save in relation to the additional evidentiary matters that were raised
at the hearing and are the subject of Procedural Order No 20, the
Parties are directed to address these questions solely from the
evidence on the arbitration record.

A. Corruption payments

1. The Tribunals understand the Respondents’ position to be that
BAPEX concluded the JVA because it was instructed to do so
by the Minister and that these instructions were procured by
corruption. Do the Respondents rely on any other governmental
acts which were required for the conclusion of the JVA and
which were allegedly procured by corruption?

2. The Claimant is invited to specify the total amount the Niko
Group spent on the procurement of the JVA, identifying
separately the payments made to each of its consultants (Five
Feathers, Mr Sharif/Stratum Development Corporation and,
directly or indirectly, Mr Bhuiyan/ Nationwide Co Ltd).

3. The Respondents have shown on their Exhibits R-320 (referred
to at the hearing as the “Spider web”) and RH-17 payments (a)
by Niko to the UBP accounts of Mr Sharif (6207285) and
Stratum (6262120); (b) outgoing from these accounts, and have
identified which of the latter they consider as suspect. The
Respondents are invited:

79

3.1 to identify for each of the suspect payments its ultimate
addressee, the chain of payments (in the alleged “layered
approach”) leading to him/her and the supporting
evidence.

Where some or all of the links in the chain to the alleged ultimate
addressee cannot be proven, but must be presumed in view of the
circumstances, the Respondents are invited:

3.2 to identify the specific circumstances and explain why
they justify the assumption that the payment, directly or
indirectly, was made to the ultimate addressee;

3.3 to specify the acts or omissions by which the recipient of
the payment was to assist Niko; and

3.4 to state whether Niko knew or ought to have known of
the suspect payments and their final addressee and to
identify the grounds on which such actual or presumed
knowledge must be accepted.

4. Specifically in relation to the payments that Respondents allege
were made by Mr Bhuiyan to Mr Mamoon and Minister
Hossain, and without restricting the generality of question 3,
the Respondents are invited to identify the evidence that they
rely upon as establishing that:

4.1 the payments were made;

4.2 they were derived from funds emanating from the
Claimant;

4.3 they provided funds or a benefit in kind to a State official;

4.4 were made for the purpose of inducing BAPEX to conclude
the JVA and Petrobangla to conclude the GPSA; and

4.5 the Claimant knew or ought to have known that the
payments were made for this purpose and on its behalf.

5. The Claimant is invited to specify which concrete services it
expected from Five Feathers and Mr Bhuiyan/ Nationwide Co
Ltd and under their respective contracts in consideration of the
payments that the Claimant agreed to make to those
consultants, and what services they actually provided,
identifying any documents on record which are evidence for
such services. It is also invited to state what information it had

80

about how the payments under its contracts with those
consultants were made; if not made directly, why the route of
payment used was adopted, and the use of the funds paid to
each of the consultants and when such knowledge was
obtained.

B. The Joint Venture Agreement

6.

The Respondents are invited to identify, on the basis of the
evidence that is on the record or will be produced by the
Respondents pursuant to Procedural Order No 20:

6.1 the precise provisions which, in their view, required BAPEX,
Petrobangla and/or the GOB to apply competitive
procedures for the selection of Niko as party to the JVA;

6.2 any other petroleum project (for exploration or for
marginal/ abandoned fields) after the Second Round of PSC
bidding (Exhibit R-212) which were awarded to companies
not controlled directly or indirectly by the GOB, indicating
for each of them whether a competitive procedure was
applied and if so specify the modalities and the regulations
applied; and

6.3 the commercial conditions of such other projects in
comparison with the Niko-BAPEX JV.

The Claimant is invited to explain the changes on which it relies
in order to justify why the Swiss Challenge method was
ultimately abandoned for the selection of Niko as party for the
JVA.

In this respect, the Parties are invited to explain whether, in
their view, there was a change in approach from the MoU to the
FoU and, if so, how this change and the circumstances leading
to it were documented. Did this change, if it occurred, imply
renunciation of the competitive procedure in the form of a Swiss
Challenge?

The Claimant relies on Niko’s letter to the Ministry, dated 5 April

2001 (Exhibit C-133), containing the passage “The ‘Swiss
Challenge’ method may be adopted for developing the gas

81

10.

11.

fields.”7? Do the words “may be adopted” mean that (a) the
choice of this method is optional, (b) the use of this method is
authorised or (c) something else?

The Parties are also invited to state their position on the
question whether, as argued by the Claimant, the terms of the
JVA, as actually concluded, were more favourable to BAPEX
than prior drafts of the JVA considered during the negotiations.

Both Parties are invited to explain as of when the Chattak area
was first treated as two distinct fields, one as
marginal/ abandoned field, the other as exploration target, and
how this was documented.

C. The GPSA

12.

13.

The Tribunals understand the Respondents’ principal argument
to be that the GPSA is derived from the JVA and that the gas
supplied under the GPSA came from the Feni field from which
the Claimant, jointly with BAPEX, was authorised to produce
under the JVA. As a result of the purported nullity of the JVA or
its avoidance, the GPSA also is void or has been avoided. The
Respondents are invited to identify the other acts of corruption
on which they rely as having caused the conclusion of the
GPSA.

With respect to these other acts, the Respondents are invited to
specify: what bribes were allegedly paid, when these
payments were made, to whom and how? What advantages
did Niko gain from the alleged bribes?

D. Other factual issue

14.

When did BAPEX and Petrobangla have, or should be deemed
to have had, knowledge of the facts now alleged in sufficient
detail and reliability to invoke the nullity of the agreements or
declare their avoidance?

72 This wording is quoted from the translation of the letter produced during the proceedings on Jurisdiction
and quoted in the Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 2); the translation in Exhibit C-133 is different (for
the complete text of the two translations see below Section 4.1; the difference in the translation and the
reference to Exhibit C-133 has given rise to some misunderstanding on the Claimant’s side (see C-PHB 1
(CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 149); the Respondents understood the translation issue (R-PHB 1
(CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 152 and Footnote 262).

82

E. Legal issues

15.

16.

17.

18.

Standard of proof in case of corruption allegations: when
determining the standard of proof for allegations that
agreements were procured by corruption, what allowance must
be made for (a) possible efforts of concealing the corruption
activity and resulting difficulties to prove corruption and
causation and (b) the gravity of any finding of corruption for the
persons concerned?

The relevant date of knowledge: What is the effect, as a matter
of the applicable law, of the date at which BAPEX and
Petrobangla had knowledge about corruption (see question 14)
upon the extent of the right (if any) of BAPEX to avoid the JVA
and Petrobangla to avoid the GPSA on 25 March 2016?

The case of a corrupt government: assuming the decision-
making bodies of a country are corrupt to the point that they
require corrupt payments for performing governmental acts,

17.1 do such payments qualify as corruption?

17.2 If they do so qualify, may the government subsequently
rely on the corrupt payments which it had required for
the purpose of avoiding the act and preserving the benefit
without having to make its corresponding performance?

17.3 Does it make a difference in these circumstances whether
the party having made the corrupt payments did or did
not receive an undue advantage from the corrupt
paymentP

17.4 Is there a relevant distinction to be made between the
corrupt government and its instrumentalities?

17.5 What is the situation when the composition of the
government changes and the corrupt structures are no
longer operating?

Payments to persons claiming to have the power to prevent the
desired governmental act: the Parties are invited to take
position on the question of how payments must be considered
which are addressed to persons who have no governmental
function and are not otherwise involved in the decision-making
process but who claim that they have the power to prevent the
transaction if no payment is made to them.

83

270.

271.

19. What is the evidentiary standard to be applied when
determining whether Niko “ought to have known” the ultimate
destination of its payments?

20. What are the rules in ICSID arbitration and under the law of
Bangladesh concerning the time limits for raising defences
based on corrupt payments?

21. If and to the extent that the agreements are voidable and were
effectively avoided by BAPEX on 25 March 2016,

21.1 does the avoidance have retroactive effect and, if so,
what is the fate of the performance received by the
Parties under the avoided agreements?

21.2 What remedies do the Tribunals have power to award
under the Arbitration Agreement and article 18 JVA?

21.3 What remedies, if any, is each Party entitled to as a
matter of law in that event?

2.4.16 The “Deloitte Audit” and the Claimant’s claim for privilege
Procedural Order No 22

During his oral examination at the April 2017 Hearing, Mr Hornaday
referred to an audit that Deloitte had conducted in the context of the
investigation involving the Claimant’s parent company, Niko Canada. Mr
Hornaday did not provide any detailed information about this audit nor
about the way in which the outcome of the audit had been reported to
Niko Canada and how Niko Canada had treated the same. However, Mr
Hornaday indicated that a PowerPoint presentation existed. Counsel for
the Claimant later confirmed its existence.

At the Hearing, the Respondents requested the production of the
PowerPoint slides and other documents related to the Deloitte audit. The
Claimant asserted privilege, arguing that the Deloitte audit had been
carried out at the request of Niko’s Canadian counsel. The Respondents
objected to the assertion of privilege in these circumstances. The
Claimant was given the opportunity to examine whether these documents
were indeed covered by privilege and to state its position by 8 May 2017.

84

272.

273.

In Procedural Order No 20 of 17 May 2017, the Tribunals ordered the
Claimant to

1.1 produce to the Tribunals and the Respondents a list of

(a) all documents which were produced by Deloitte as part of the
audit of the corruption issue, to which Mr Hornaday referred in his
oral testimony (the Deloitte Audit List) and

(b) documents derived from these documents, such as the
PowerPoint presentation mentioned by Mr Hornaday and the minutes
of Board Meetings at which the Deloitte report was discussed;

1.2 identify on the Deloitte Audit List those documents for which
Niko claims privilege, and state the reasons for the privilege claim
(submission on privilege); and

1.3 produce to the Tribunal and the Respondents those documents
for which no privilege is claimed.

In its response of 22 May 2017, the Claimant asserted privilege for the
documents concerning the Deloitte investigation. It explained that
Deloitte had been engaged by Gowlings (see above Section 2.4.1) in
support of the legal advice that these solicitors were providing to Niko
Canada. With this response the Claimant produced the letter by which
Gowlings engaged Deloitte73 (the Deloitte Engagement Letter, referred
to by the Claimant as the Deloitte Retainer Agreement), the Deloitte Audit
List, Niko Canada Board Meeting Minutes and Audit Committee Meeting
Minutes, partially redacted. Further documents were referenced in an
updated version of the Deloitte Audit List filed on 26 May 2017. The
Claimant explained:

The additional Deloitte generated material comprises further
interview notes/summaries as well as a general description of what
we understand to be voluminous internal working papers generated
by Deloitte pursuant to their engagement by Gowlings under the
Retainer Agreement dated 27 February 2009. It is our understanding
that such Deloitte internal working papers reside in different locations
within Deloitte’s record keeping systems and comprise working notes,
annotations and similar items generated by Deloitte team members
for the purpose of performing its mandate pursuant to its engagement
by Gowlings. As with the other Deloitte generated materials, solicitor-

278.

client privilege and litigation privilege is asserted in all such work
product as outlined in Niko’s submission of 22 May 2017.

The Respondents objected that the redactions made in the documents
produced by the Claimant did not identify which of the redactions were
made on the basis of an assertion of privilege. The Claimants produced
on 29 May 2017 new versions of these documents in which they had
marked the passages for which they claimed privilege.

The Respondents disputed that the Deloitte documents were covered by
solicitor-client privilege or litigation privilege and sought the production
of

any and all documents related to Deloitte’s investigation and report
and
deny|[ing] Claimant’s assertion of privilege over these documents. 74

The Respondents also argued that any privilege that may have attached
to the Deloitte documents was waived by Mr Hornaday’s testimony at the
April 2017 Hearing. The issue of waiver was discussed by the Parties in
their submissions of 5, 9 and 16 June 2017.

Having examined the possibility of appointing an expert familiar with the
Canadian law of privilege to inspect the documents for which the
Claimant asserted privilege and to advise on the question whether these
documents are indeed covered by privilege, the Tribunals decided to
refrain from doing so: the Parties had argued in depth the relevant rules
and principles of Canadian law and the Tribunals concluded that, on the
basis of those principles, in the light of the Parties’ submissions, the
Respondents’ request and the Claimants’ privilege assertion could be
decided without the Tribunals having to inspect the documents
concerned. In these circumstances, the Tribunals concluded that the
additional delay which would inevitably have been caused by the
appointment of such an expert and its work was unjustified.

The Tribunals issued their decision in Procedural Order No 22 on 27
July 2017.

282.

On the basis of the factual evidence before them, the Tribunals concluded
that in early 2009 (or thereabouts) Niko Canada became aware of an
“investigation of allegations of improper payments made by Niko
Resources Ltd. and/or its subsidiary in Bangladesh and other locations” .75
Niko Canada retained Gowlings who in turn engaged Deloitte to conduct
the enquiry. The questions which the Tribunals had to address, therefore,
were whether the documents and information produced in Deloitte’s
investigation were covered by one or the other privilege invoked by the
Claimant and, if they were, whether this privilege had been waived.

Concerning the question of the law applicable to the resolution of these
questions, the Tribunals noted that the Parties had argued the case by
reference to Canadian law; that the documents the Respondents sought
to be produced were generated by an investigative service provider in
Canada; that this was done at the initiative of a Canadian law firm; that
the firm in question had been retained by a Canadian company; that the
inquiry related to a Canadian investigation; and finally that the lawyer-
client relationship on which the Claimant relied was between a Canadian
law firm and its Canadian client. The Tribunals concluded that the
question whether and to what extent this relationship was covered by
legal privilege thus clearly is subject to Canadian law.

The Tribunals noted that in Canadian law the solicitor-client privilege
and litigation privilege were treated differently and examined separately
depending on whether, in the light of Canadian law, the documents were
protected by one or the other of these privileges.

With respect to the solicitor-client privilege, the Tribunals accepted
that Deloitte had acted as auxiliary to Gowlings in preparation for legal
advice to their client, Niko Canada and Niko Bangladesh. They concluded
that

... some and possibly many of the documents for which the Claimant
asserts privilege do indeed attract solicitor-client privilege or at least
may require redaction. The decision of their production requires
further information from the Claimant and an examination of the
documents themselves possibly by an independent expert.7©

283.

284.

285.

286.

287.

With respect to the notes on interviews conducted by Deloitte, the
Tribunals accepted the proposition that with respect to persons from the
Niko Group interviewed by Deloitte and conveying confidential
information in reliance on solicitor-client privilege, the notes were covered
by that privilege. But since the persons whose interviews were recorded
in the notes had not been identified to the Tribunals, the Tribunals
concluded

... the Tribunal cannot know which of these interviews are covered by
the solicitor-client privilege as part of the “internal investigation” and
which were conducted with outside persons with respect to whom no
solicitor-client privilege can be admitted.’”

In the circumstances described in their conclusions on solicitor-client
privilege, the Tribunals decided, before seeking assistance (in particular
in order to ensure that the documents were examined by an independent
expert), to reserve their position on this type of privilege and to turn to
the other type of privilege under Canadian law.

Litigation privilege under Canadian law is understood, in terms
expressed by the Claimant as applying

to communications and documents where the dominant purpose for
their creation was for use in connection with contemplated litigation. 7°

Or, as explained by the Respondents:

The principal issue in determining whether litigation privilege applies
to a particular document is whether the dominant purpose of the
communication or document was for litigation.79

The Tribunals considered in particular a passage from a decision of the
Alberta Court of Queens Bench in which that court quoted the Alberta
Court of Appeal in Mosely vs. Spray Lakes Sawmills (2008):

The key is, and has been since this Court adopted the dominant
purpose test in Nova, that statements and documents will only fall
within the protection of the litigation privilege where the dominant
purpose for their creation was, at the time they were made, for use in
contemplated or pending litigation. While a lawsuit need not have

290.

been initiated, and while a lawyer need not have been retained at the
time the statement or document was made, the party claiming
privilege must establish that at the time of creation the dominant
purpose was use in litigation... The test is a strict one. As has often
been stated, it is not enough that contemplated litigation is one of the
purposes. 8°

Having examined the evidence, in particular the Minutes of the Niko
Canada Board meetings and the instructions to Deloitte, the Tribunals
concluded that the internal investigation, since it was initiated by Niko’s
engagement of Gowlings and then continued by the engagement of
Deloitte, had as the dominant if not sole purpose the preparation of Niko’s
defence against court or other proceedings relating to the allegations of
corruption in Bangladesh. To that extent, the Tribunals held that the
investigations by Deloitte and the documents and information produced
by them are covered by the litigation privilege as protected by Canadian
law.8!

It was undisputed between the Parties that the litigation privilege, in
contrast to the solicitor-client privilege, is limited in time. The Tribunals
therefore examined whether the purpose of the investigation had come to
an end with the completion of the Canadian proceedings and the
conviction of Niko Canada in June of 2011. The Tribunals considered the
decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in Blank v. Canada (Department
of Justice) in which the issue had been discussed in depth. In that case
the Supreme Court had stated that “the duration and extent of the
litigation privilege are circumscribed by its underlying purpose, namely the
protection essential to the proper operation of the adversarial process” and
“the need for a protected area to facilitate investigation and preparation of
acase for trial by the adversarial advocate” .82

The Tribunals noted that when consulting Gowlings, the Niko Board of
Directors

 
 
 

 

 

IM The Deloitte audit was
intended to prepare Niko’s case in this matter. This is also the issue in

the present proceedings on the Respondents’ Corruption Claim. The fact
that the parties are different does not prevent the application of the
privilege: in the Blank decision, the Supreme Court accepted that the
“protected area” of litigation privilege may apply even if “the parties were
different and the specifics of each claim were different’.

The common ground between the present Arbitrations and the
investigation for which the Deloitte documents were produced is
evidenced also by the fact that the Respondents themselves rely in
support of their Corruption Claim heavily on the RCMP, ACC and FBI
investigation which formed the basis for the litigation against which Niko
Canada sought advice and defence from its solicitors.

The Tribunals concluded that the Claimant’s defence against the
Respondents’ Corruption Claim is so closely related to the Gowlings-
Deloitte investigation that the “protected area” of the litigation privilege of
the latter extends to the former. The Tribunals accepted that the
Claimant may assert litigation privilege against the Respondents’ request
for production of the Deloitte documents.®4

Finally, the Tribunals examined whether the Privilege had been waived
by the statements made by Mr Hornaday at the April 2017 Hearing. The
Tribunals found that the beneficiary of privilege attaching to the Deloitte
documents are Niko Canada and possibly also Niko; these companies did
not waive their privilege.

Nor did Mr Hornaday himself waive the privilege, whether expressly or by
relying on any of the documents. Indeed, he mentioned the documents
only when the Respondents’ counsel in cross-examination questioned
him about the existence of that type of an inquiry. He then did not reveal
any confidential information about the documents. According to his
testimony, he could not reveal confidential information about the Deloitte
documents since he had not seen them; their substantive content was
withheld from him and he was excluded from attending the oral report
presented in combination with the PowerPoint presentation. Niko had
thus demonstrated clearly its intention to preserve the privilege
protection of the documents, just as it had avoided disclosure to
outsiders.

84 Procedural Order No 22, paragraph 98.

90

295.

296.

297.

The Tribunals concluded that litigation privilege asserted by the Claimant
with respect to the Deloitte documents has not been waived.

In light of these considerations, the Tribunals decided in Procedural
Order No 22:

fi) The Claimant is entitled to invoke litigation privilege against the
production of the Deloitte Documents.

(ii) | In view of the decision under (i) the assertion of solicitor-client
privilege concerning these documents does not need to be resolved;

(iv) The Respondents’ request for production of the Deloitte
Documents is denied.

2.4.17 The Respondents’ further RCMP application

After the evidentiary record for the Corruption Claim had been closed by
Procedural Order No 20 of 17 May 2017, the Respondents wrote to the
Tribunals on 23 August 2017, communicating a letter which the Deputy
Commissioner, Federal Policing, of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
had addressed on 21 April 2017 to the Attorney General for Bangladesh
(the “RCMP letter”) in response to a request from the latter dated 26
March 2017. The RCMP letter described the request as follows:

In your letter, you ask that the RCMP meet with your designee, Mr.
Ferdous Khan, to discuss your request that the RCMP grant
permission for Corporal Kevin Paul Duggan to provide a written
statement and be available to be cross-examined in Paris, France
during the scheduled hearing (April 24-29, 2017), and to grant
permission for Corporal Duggan to use relevant evidence in
possession of the RCMP for his witness statement.

The letter next referred to the Tribunals’ Procedural Orders Nos 14 and 15
and concluded:

The Tribunal has indicated that it does not wish to hear from the
RCMP, either through documentary evidence or through live
witnesses. In light of these Procedural Orders and the position of the
ICSID, the RCMP will be unable to voluntarily participate in the
matters before the Tribunal.

91

The RCMP is impartial with regards to the matters before the ICSID.
If further involvement is required by either the Claimant (Niko) or
Respondents (Bapex and Petrobangla), the RCMP would need a
request from the Tribunal, which it would then consider before
determining how to proceed.

298. The RCMP letter concluded by stating: “/i/f you feel that this information
is relevant to the proceedings, or will assist in resolving this outstanding
matter, please feel free to provide a copy of this letter to the Tribunal.”

299. When they submitted this letter to the Tribunals on 23 August 2018, the
Respondents explained the circumstances in which they had received it:

Respondents were informed after the Hearing on the Corruption Claim
of the response from the RCMP to a direct request from the Attorney
General to obtain the additional evidence in possession of the RCMP
and the testimony of its officers. The RCMP denied the request of the
Attorney General based on the agency’s reading of Procedural Orders
Nos. 14 and 15, by which the RCMP understood that the Tribunals
did “not wish to hear from the RCMP, either through documentary
evidence or through live witnesses.” However, the RCMP indicated
that it would consider providing the testimony and evidence of
Corporal Duggan and another agent if the Tribunals so request. The
RCMP invited the Attorney General to submit its letter to the Tribunals
for consideration. In light of the timing of our receipt of this letter and
the Tribunals’ prior procedural orders, Respondents were hesitant to
raise again the issue of the RCMP’s evidence. However, because
Claimant has successfully asserted privilege for the evidence and
report it possesses from the Deloitte investigation at the same time
that it continues in its Post Hearing Briefs to contest the sufficiency of
the evidence in the record, Respondents feel it is necessary to bring
this letter to the Tribunals’ attention. The RCMP’s invitation opens the
possibility for the Tribunals to obtain the RCMP’s evidence directly,
without having to go through the Canadian Court procedures
previously described by Respondents.

300. The Respondents insisted on the importance of the evidence and
testimony of the officers of the RCMP involved in the investigation and
asserted:

Their testimony and evidence is not available to Respondents through
any other means. Accordingly, to the extent the Tribunals consider
giving any credence to Claimant’s arguments regarding the
sufficiency of the evidence, Respondents would request that they

92

301.

302.

2.5

303.

accept the RCMP’s offer and request the testimony of its agents and
the additional evidence in its possession.

Respondents have presented more than sufficient evidence to prove
that Niko established its investment and procured the JVA and GPSA
in bad faith, illegally, and by corruption. It should thus be
unnecessary for the Tribunals to reopen the evidentiary proceedings
on corruption. Nevertheless, in light of Claimant’s assertion of
privilege and its continued arguments challenging the sufficiency of
the evidence, Respondents feel compelled to bring this option for
gathering additional evidence to the Tribunals’ attention.

The Claimant responded on 25 August 2017, arguing that the
Respondents’ submission is “inadmissible on its face and therefore
requires no response”. It was, however, prepared to provide a response
upon the Tribunals’ direction.

The Tribunals considered the correspondence concerning the RCMP
letter and the Respondents’ conditional request. They saw no justification
for re-opening the evidentiary proceedings on the Corruption Claim for
steps as indicated in the Respondents’ letter of 23 August 2017, and
informed the Parties on 11 September 2017 that they would address the
matter in due course “when this may become necessary”. The reasons for
their decision are explained below in Section 8.3 in the context of the
evidence considered by the Tribunals.

The Alam Proceedings and Judgment (Writ Petition No 5673 of 2016),
the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures and the Tribunals’
Decision pertaining to the Exclusivity of the Tribunals’ Jurisdiction

As mentioned above, the Respondents modified the grounds for their
Corruption Claim under the law of Bangladesh and, on 29 April 2016,
introduced Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution as new foundation
for their claim in the Arbitrations. On 9 May 2016, Professor M. Samsul
Alam relied on the same Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution and
addressed to the Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, an
application which was registered as Writ Petition No 5673 of 2016.85
The petitioner was described in the Petition itself as “a reputed energy

Respondents to this Petition were (1) the Government of Bangladesh,
represented by the Secretary, Energy Division, Ministry of Energy, Power
and Mineral Resources, (2) Petrobangla, (3) BAPEX, (4) Niko and (5) Niko
Canada.

On 12 May 2016, the High Court Division issued a Rule Nisi, ordering
the respondents to the petition

... to show cause as to why the [JVA and the GPSA] should not be
declared to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect and thus
void ab initio; and also why the assets of respondents No 4 and No 5,
including shareholding interest in Tullow Bangladesh Limited
concerning Block-9 should not be attached and seized to provide
adequate compensation for the 2005 blowouts, and/or such other or
further order or orders be passed as this Court may deem fit and
proper.

The Court also ordered that, pending the proceedings on the Writ Petition

... the operation of the impugned JVA and the impugned GPSA be
stayed for 1 (one) month from date. The respondents no. 1 - 3 are
directed not to give any kind of benefit to the respondents no. 4 and
5 and not to make any kind of payments to the respondents no. 4 and
5 or any of their affiliates or subsidiaries, including payments made
in pursuance of the gas supplied from Block-9 which is 60% owned
by the respondent no. 5 during the period of stay.

The Respondents notified the Writ Petition and the Order of the High
Court Division of 12 May 2016 to the Tribunals.

On 19 May 2016, the Claimant addressed a Request for Provisional
Measures to the Tribunals, which was subsequently amended on 1 June
2016. The Claimant’s request, as amended, sought an order from the
Tribunals:

Declaring that these Tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction over the
questions of: (i) the validity of the JVA and GPSA as concerns Niko,
BAPEX and Petrobangla, and their successors, predecessors,
assignors and assignees; (ii) whether Niko is liable to BAPEX or any
of its successors, predecessors, assignors and assignees and if so,
what compensation is due; and (iii) any requests for interim or

94

309.

310.

311.

312.

313.

314.

provisional measures concerning any matter within the exclusive
jurisdiction of these Tribunals, including any injunction, stay of
payment, attachment or other relief.

Ordering BAPEX and Petrobangla to consent to the removal of the
interim injunction in Writ Petition No. 5673 before the Supreme Court
of Bangladesh, High Court Division, and to take all measures to
request and support the removal or discontinuance of such interim
injunction and dismissal of the Writ Petition.

The Respondents were invited to comment on the original and amended
versions of the Request and expressed their opposition to them on 1 June
2016 and 15 June 2016, respectively. Further submissions in connection
with the Claimant’s Request were made by the Respondents on 7 and 12
July 2016 and the Claimant on 11 and 13 July 2016.

On 23 June 2016, the Claimant provided an update regarding
developments the Claimant considered relevant to its request for
provisional measures and the Tribunals’ Third Decision on the Payment
Claim. The Claimant additionally requested that the Tribunals adjust the
timing of their decision on provisional measures and address
Petrobangla’s disrespect for the Third Decision on the Payment Claim.

On 27 June 2016, the Tribunals granted the Respondents’ request to
provide comments on the Claimant’s 23 June 2016 letter, inviting them
to do so by 30 June 2016. At the same time, the Respondents were invited
to inform the Tribunals regarding the steps that had been taken to make
payment as ordered in the Third Decision on the Payment Claim.

On 30 June 2016, the Respondents responded to the Claimant’s 27 June
2016 letter requesting, inter alia, reconsideration of the Tribunals’ Third
Decision on the Payment Claim.

By instructions of 14 July 2016 the Tribunals informed the parties that
the evidentiary record on the Claimant’s original and amended requests
for provisional measures was closed.

On 19 July 2016 the Tribunals dealt with the Claimant’s request of 19
May 2016 by a Decision Pertaining to the Exclusivity of Tribunals’
Jurisdiction (the “Decision on Exclusivity”) which recalled that the
Government of Bangladesh had delegated to Petrobangla and to BAPEX

95

the exercise of its rights and powers with respect to the JVA and the
GPSA, as recorded in the Preamble of the JVA and referred to in the
GPSA. While they found that they do not have jurisdiction ratione
personae over the Government, the Tribunals confirmed that they “have
exclusive jurisdiction to determine the issues that are validly brought
before them”. Concerning the relationship with the courts in Bangladesh,

[t]his finding does not affect the personal jurisdiction of the courts in
Bangladesh in other respects. These courts may well receive and
determine claims by persons over which the Tribunals do not have
jurisdiction and adjudicate such claims. In making their decision
involving other parties, the courts of Bangladesh, however, are bound
to conform to and implement the decisions rendered by these
Tribunals that are within the competence of these Tribunals. This
means, for instance, that it is for these Tribunals, and the Tribunals
alone, to decide whether the JVA and the GPSA were procured by
corruption, whether the blow-outs were caused by Niko’s breach of
the standards it had to observe under the JVA and the amount of the
damage caused by such a breach. When seized by a claim of a party
not subject to the jurisdiction of the Tribunals, a court in Bangladesh
may entertain that claim but it must conform its decision to those of
the Tribunals.

If it were otherwise, the international commitments of the State of
Bangladesh, bound by its adherence to the ICSID Convention and its
decision to delegate the Chattak and Feni investments to Petrobangla
and BAPEX, could be rendered ineffective by the simple expedient of
any third parties claiming to be affected in their rights by the actions
and occurrences over which the Tribunals have jurisdiction, bringing
claims before the courts of Bangladesh and having these courts
render decisions which conflict materially with the decisions of the
Tribunals operating under the ICSID Convention and thereby also
conflicting with Bangladesh’s obligations as a party to that
Convention. [...]

Such a conflicting position is indeed now taken by the Respondents
when they argue that a court in Bangladesh may order measures in
conflict with the decisions of the Tribunals, simply because the
application is made by a person not party to the Convention and the
Arbitrations. On the basis of this position the Respondents argue that,
for instance a payment ordered by these Tribunals under the ICSID
Convention could be prevented by the order of a court in Bangladesh
simply because the order is made at the request of a person not party
to these proceeding.

96

315.

316.

Accepting this position would subvert the international obligations
assumed by Bangladesh by virtue of its decision to become a party to
the ICSID Convention. The Tribunals are not prepared to give effect to
such a position. 8&

The Tribunals considered the substance of the relief requested by the
Claimant and the circumstances in which it was requested and granted
it in these terms:

1. Declare that the Tribunals have sole and exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction with respect to all matters which have validly been
brought before it, notably

The validity of the JVA and the GSPA, including all questions relating
to the avoidance of these agreements on grounds of corruption;

The liability of Niko under the JVA for the blow-outs that occurred in
the course of its activity in the Chattak field and the quantum of the
damage for which it may be responsible in case such liability were
found to exist;

The payment obligations of Petrobangla towards Niko under the GSPA
for gas delivered, the jurisdiction for injunctions seeking to prevent
such payments and to retract such injunctions;

2. Order BAPEX and Petrobangla

to intervene with all courts and other authorities in Bangladesh that
are or may be concerned with issues identified above under (1) to
bring to their attention the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunals in
respect of these issues and the international obligations of the State
of Bangladesh resulting therefrom under the ICSID Convention; and

to take all steps necessary to terminate any proceedings and orders
by the courts in Bangladesh which are in conflict with this order.

By letter of 25 July 2016, the Respondents noted their objection to the
Decision on Exclusivity, stating that they reserved all rights to post-
award remedies and recorded “that their compliance with the Tribunals’
order and obligations deriving thereunder is without prejudice to such
disagreement and Respondents’ substantive and procedural rights”. The
Tribunals noted these objections in Procedural Order No 14 and invited

the Respondents to inform the Tribunals about the manner in which they
had complied with the Decision.

On 8 August 2016, the Respondents responded in writing. With regard
to the Writ Petition, the Respondents stated that they were “preparing to
file an affidavit as soon as possible requesting the termination of
proceedings inconsistent with the order of the Tribunals, and in particular
the prohibition on payments to Niko”.

On 12 and 16 August 2016, the Claimant responded to the Respondents’
letter, arguing that neither Respondent had taken any steps in the Alam
Proceeding to give effect to the Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity.

On 16 August 2016, the Respondents notified the Tribunals that they
had filed on 14 August 2016 an Application in connection with the Writ
Petition informing the court of the Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity and
requesting it to issue an order vacating the order prohibiting payments
to Niko. A copy of this application was attached to the Respondents’
letter. In a letter of 19 August 2016, the Respondents disputed the
Claimant’s characterization of the Respondents’ actions in connection
with the Alam Proceedings and their compliance with the Decision on
Exclusivity.

The issue of compliance with the Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity
was addressed during the Procedural Consultation on 1 September 2016.
The Tribunals then informed the Parties on 29 September 2016 that they

... see as the first priority in the present stage of the proceedings the
decision on the Respondents’ Corruption Claim. At the present stage
and unless new developments require urgent action from them, they
do not see a need for further correspondence in continuation of the
Parties’ letters 12, 16 and 19 August 2016 relating to the compliance
with the Tribunals’ decision of 19 July 2016 pertaining to the
exclusivity of their jurisdiction.

The matter was again addressed at the Status Conference on 30 January

2017:

The Respondents referred to their submission of 14 August 2016 filed
with the court hearing the writ petition of Professor Alam, stating that
since then, they have been awaiting the court’s decision. The
Claimant asserted that no efforts have been made by the

98

322.

323.

324.

325.

Respondents to lift the injunctions. The Respondents objected to this
statement.87

Despite the Respondents’ submission to the High Court Division
concerning the Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity, that court continued
with its proceedings on the Alam Writ Petition. It held Hearings on 11
April 2017, and on several days during the months of July and August
2017.88

On 10 August 2017, the Claimant complained to the Tribunals that the
Government presented arguments supporting a finding of corruption and
judgment in favour of the petitioner and that the Government contested
the application of the exclusive jurisdiction of these Tribunals, as
recognized in the Decision on Exclusivity, to the Writ Petition
proceedings. The Claimant noted that the only step taken by Petrobangla
and BAPEX in the Alam Proceedings had been the application that the
Respondents had transmitted under cover of their letter of 16 August
2016 to these Tribunals. That application, so the Claimant maintained,
only half-heartedly requested vacation of the Court’s order staying
payments to Niko and its affiliates. The Court had taken no action on
that application, and the Respondents had done nothing to pursue the
application. The Claimant asserted that the conduct of Petrobangla and
BAPEX, and of the Government of Bangladesh, can be reconciled neither
with their obligations under Article 26 of the ICSID Convention nor with
the Tribunals’ order that Petrobangla and BAPEX “take all steps
necessary to terminate any proceedings and orders by the courts in
Bangladesh which are in conflict with” the Decision on Exclusivity. No
specific action was, however, requested from the Tribunals.

The Respondents responded on 16 August 2017, stating that the
Respondents “have no authority over the Government of Bangladesh and
cannot respond to accusations against the Government in these arbitration
proceedings”. The Respondents requested the Tribunal to ignore the
Claimant’s letter of 10 August 2017.

The High Court Division delivered its judgment orally on 24 August
2017 and the Respondents informed the Tribunals on the same day. The

Judgment, 24 August 2017, p.1.

99

326.

Respondents provided the following information about the proceedings
and the oral judgment:

As the Parties informed the Tribunals earlier this month, the Court
chose to hear the merits of the petition before deciding on
Respondents’ August 2016 application to vacate the stay on Niko’s
assets and conform its decision to these Tribunals’ Decision on
Exclusivity. The Court did not immediately decide Respondents’
application, and leading up to the Hearing on the Corruption Claim,
there was no further action regarding the rule the Court had issued in
May 2016 pursuant to the Writ Petition. Respondents believed it
would remain undecided pending the decision of these Tribunals. In
late March 2017, however, Claimant applied to the High Court to
discharge the rule based on res judicata because of the 2009 decision
in the case brought by the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers
Association (BELA). Following that application, the Court again took
up the matter and, as reported by Claimant, began hearing arguments
on the merits of the case in July. Respondents made no arguments on
the merits of the Writ Petition

Today the High Court, acting under Article 102 of the Constitution of
Bangladesh, announced its decision that, based on undisputed facts
of Niko’s corruption, the JVA and GPSA are void ab initio.

The Claimant added on 25 August the following further explanations:

On 24 August 2017, a panel of the High Court Division of the
Bangladesh Supreme Court announced in open court its decision to
grant the writ petition in full. The Court thus, without hearing a single
witness and based on a minimal evidentiary record, purported to
decide, among other issues, the questions that have been fully briefed
and submitted to these Tribunals for decision after a full evidentiary
hearing. As observed by the Respondents in their letter of 24 August,
the decision announced by the Court was to find the JVA and the
GPSA void ab initio The Court directed the Government to confiscate
all assets of Niko and one of its affiliates as compensation for the
2005 blowouts. It did so despite having also failed to hear any
evidence on Niko’s liability for those blowouts, any evidence as to any
damages allegedly suffered, or any evidence to justify seizing assets
of a separate company with no role in the blowouts or the procurement
of the JVA or GPSA. As noted in our letter of 10 August 2017 and
confirmed in their letter of 24 August, the Respondents took no
practical steps to oppose the writ petition and presented no argument
to the Court.

100

327. On 11 September 2017, the Tribunals confirmed that they had reviewed
the Parties’ communications of 10, 16, 24 and 25 August 2017
concerning the proceedings before the High Court Division of the
Supreme Court of Bangladesh. They noted that this correspondence did
not contain any specific request for action on the part of the Tribunals.
They announced that they would address these matters in due course
when this may become necessary.

328. The written version of the High Court Division’s Judgment in Writ Petition
5673 of 2016, containing the detailed reasons of the Court (the “Alam
Judgment”), was issued on 19 November 2017. As the Parties had
announced to the Tribunals following the oral delivery of the Judgment,
the Court declared the JVA and the GPSA “to be without lawful authority
and of no legal effect and thus void ab initio”. The assets of Niko and Niko
Canada, including their shareholding in interest in Tullow Bangladesh
Limited concerning Block-9 were attached.

329. The decision of the High Court Division was reached in proceedings
according to Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution, without taking
of any evidence and based solely on affidavits presented by the Parties
and on what the Court considered as “undisputed facts and evidence” .®9
On that basis the Court concluded that Niko “had set up a corrupt scheme
for obtaining benefits from the Government of Bangladesh and were able
to procure the [JVA and the GPSA] through corrupt and fraudulent
means” .9°

330. In the writ proceedings, the Government of Bangladesh entered an
“affidavit-in-opposition to the application for the discharge of the Rule but
did not contest the Rule”, i.e. the orders sought by the Petitioner. The
Government brought to the attention of the Court “important evidence
and documents and documents gathered through Mutual Legal Assistance
(“MLA”) arrangements between Bangladesh, Canada, and the United
States. [Petrobangla and BAPEX] did not file any affidavits in opposition
contesting the Rule.”9!

The Court took note of the Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity but sought
to distinguish the case before it by referring to the “judicial review
powers” it had under the Bangladesh Constitution.9?

The Tribunals examined the relevant factual assumptions of the Court,
its position concerning the Decision on Exclusivity, the interpretation of
Article 102 of the Constitution and other relevant matters relating to the
Alam Judgment. They address these issues below, in particular in
Section 6.4.

The Respondents communicated the written version of the Alam
Judgment on 21 November 2017 to the Tribunals. They asserted

The judgment of the Supreme Court is relevant to the Tribunals’
decision on the Corruption Claim because “/t/he validity, interpretation
and implementation of [the JVA and GPSA] shall be governed by the
laws of Bangladesh.”

[oJ

In determining the Corruption Claim, these Tribunals must apply the
laws of Bangladesh as articulated in the jurisprudence of the
Supreme Court and should give particular consideration to the
Supreme Court’s judgment in determining how the laws of
Bangladesh would be applied. Respondents are prepared to provide
a more detailed assessment of the significance of this judgment
should the Tribunals invite further input from the Parties on this
matter.

The Tribunals sought clarification about certain dates noted on the
Judgment and invited the Claimant to comment on the document,
allowing further comments from the Respondents.

In its submission of 11 December 2017, the Claimant described the
Judgement as “fundamentally illegitimate’. It asserted that the
Judgment:

. was issued by a court with no authority to resolve disputes of fact
or to hear more than summary evidence. The judgment’s
disingenuous assertions that disputed facts were undisputed and its
leaps of logic confirm its results-driven, partial approach. The
Respondents assert that the Writ Petition Judgment is persuasive

°2 Alam Judgment, paragraph 48.

authority. Review of the document leads to the conclusion that it is
neither persuasive nor an authority legitimately considered in this
forum.

In a further submission of 11 December 2017, the Respondents insisted
on the relevance of the Alam Judgment:

The judgment confirms prior Supreme Court jurisprudence relied on
by Respondents to show that the JVA and GPSA are void ab initio
under Bangladeshi law [and it] confirms that the acts admitted by
Niko were corruption under the laws of Bangladesh and Niko violated
these laws in the establishment of its investment.

The Parties developed their arguments in these and in subsequent
submissions filed on 21 December 2017. The Tribunals will consider the
arguments below, in particular in Section 6.4 of the present Decision.

Other relevant proceedings before the courts in Bangladesh and their
repercussions in the Arbitrations

2.6.1 The BELA Proceedings (Writ Petition 6911 of 2005)

On 12 September 2005 the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers
Association (BELA) and others, filed Writ Petition 6911 of 2005 before the
Supreme Court, High Court Division (the “BELA Petition”). Based on
Article 102 of the Constitution, the petition was directed against

(a) the Government of Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary,
Energy Division, Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources

(b) the Secretary, Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs,
(c) the Secretary, Ministry of Environment and Forest,

(d) Petrobangla,

(e) (BAPEX), and others, including

(f) Niko (Bangladesh).

The Petitioners challenged the legality of the JVA and sought a
declaration that the JVA was made without lawful authority and of no
legal effect, as having been “procured through flawed process effected and
induced by resorting to fraudulent process and forged document by [Nikof’;

103

340.

341.

342.

343.

the petition made other charges of the same type but did not mention
corruption.

In opposition to the petition, affidavits by Mr Mohammad Hossain, Mr
Muhammad Imaduddin and Md. Nural Islam were presented on behalf of
BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Government, providing an account of the
negotiations of the JVA and attesting that the JVA was valid and that
none of the Government, Petrobangla or BAPEX was involved in any fraud
or misconduct in entering into the JVA. In the Arbitrations, Mr
Imaduddin and Mr Islam presented witness statements, in which they
explained that they had not signed the affidavits and that the affidavits
did not represent their personal knowledge.%°

The High Court Division dismissed the petition in a Judgment that was
delivered orally on 16 and 17 November 2009 and in writing on 2 and 3
May 2010 (the “BELA Judgment”).°* The Judgment found that

... the JVA was not obtained by flawed process resorting to fraudulent
means. 9

To that extent the Petition was denied. The remainder of the Petition,
relating to the compensation for the blowouts, succeeded insofar as the
Court made the following order:

Niko is directed to pay the compensation money as per the decisions
to be taken in the money suit now pending in the Court of the Joint
District Judge or as per the mutual agreement among the parties. The
respondents are restrained by an order of injunction from making any
payment to [Niko]. This order of injunction shall remain in force till
disposal of the money suit or till amicable settlement amongst the
parties. 9°

on the Payment Claim.%8 These details need not be repeated here. Other
aspects of the proceedings are relevant, however:

In the BELA proceedings, the Government and both Respondents
opposed the Petition, “controverting all the material statements made in
the Writ Petition’.°° The Judgment summarises in some detail the
separate affidavits in opposition, filed by the Government and the
Respondents and their denials of the allegations of the Petitioner. The
Judgment records that they asserted having performed their “duties and
responsibilities in compliance with all the relevant laws and regulations of
Bangladesh including the Constitution”, upholding “the best interests of
the nation”, and that they were not “involved in any fraud or misconduct
in entering into execution of the Joint Venture in question” 10°

There is no indication in the Judgment or in the affidavits produced in
the course of the proceedings by the Respondents?!°! that any corruption
was involved in the conclusion of the JVA.

The BELA Petition was directed only against the JVA; at the time when it
was filed, the GPSA had not yet been concluded. By the time the
Judgment was issued, the GPSA had been concluded and the Judgment
makes some references to it. In particular it states that under the GPSA
Petrobangla pays US$1.75 per MCF while under identified other
contracts Petrobangla pays US$2.75 or even US$2.90. 102

The injunction against payments to Niko remained in place despite the
Tribunals’ decisions concerning the Payment Claim. When the Tribunals
issued their Decision on Exclusivity, the Respondents wrote on 8 August
2016 to inform the Tribunals that they “had already requested to have
the stay on payments to Niko lifted before the Tribunals’ 19 July decision”.
They explained that the request for review had remained without success:

The review petition is pending and under consideration of the
Personal Secretary to the Honorable Chief Justice (High Court Division
of the Supreme Court). However, there has been a difficulty in
retrieving the case file in order to reopen the matter. The Supreme

Court requires the original file to reopen the case to consider the
review petition, but it appears that the office of the court clerk is
unable to locate the file of the original case, which, at the end of
proceedings, was transferred to the records section on 25 April 2010.
Counsel for BAPEX and Petrobangla made a submission to the court
on 16 June 2016 seeking to have the court recover the file so that it
can address Respondents’ original petition, and, when this is
resolved, Respondents will make a submission informing the court of
the Tribunals’ decision on exclusive jurisdiction and reiterating the
request to terminate the stay.!°

348. The Claimant objected on 12 August 2016, addressing different
proceedings pending in Bangladesh, including the BELA Proceedings:

the BELA Injunction arguably still exists, and Petrobangla
continues to assert that it operates to prevent payment for gas
delivered from Feni field (and thus payment pursuant to the Third
Decision in the Payment Claim). All of these issues are within the
exclusive competence of the Tribunals. Neither Petrobangla nor
BAPEX have taken any steps in this proceeding to give effect to the
Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity. The only action referenced by the
Respondents in their 8 August letter is a 16 June 2016 inquiry by
Petrobangla’s counsel as to the whereabouts of the court file. This
predates the Decision on Exclusivity. Respondents have done nothing
to bring the Decision on Exclusivity to the attention of the court.

349. The Respondents protested on 19 August 2016 against this description
of their action. They argued that they had “done everything possible under
the procedures of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh to have that injunction
reviewed and reversed” but failed to succeed because the file could not
be found. They added that they would make a further submission with
the Court.

350. On 29 November 2016 the Tribunals invited the Respondents to report
on their action in this respect. The Respondents replied on 7 December
2016, confirming that

the court’s file in the BELA suit was transferred to a filing facility and

could not be located, which has prevented the court from addressing
the matter.

They added that despite a complaint with the Registrar of the court “the
file has not been traced and the court has not taken up the review petition”.
They added that Bangladeshi counsel for the Respondent will continue to
follow up on this matter. They announced that they would be able to
make further submissions with the court “when the Supreme Court is
addresses the petition for review and is in a position to consider such
further submission’.

Since then no further information has been provided about search for the
file and any action on the BELA injunction.

2.6.2 The Money Suit No 224 of 2008

In June 2008 both the Government of Bangladesh (represented by the
Secretary, Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources) and Petrobangla,
as Plaintiffs, filed before the District Judge in Dhaka, Money Suit No 224
of 2008 against (i) Niko Resources (Bangladesh), (ii) Brian J. Adolph, (iii)
Peter Mercier, (iv) GSM Inc. (v) George M. Lattimore, as Defendants. The
Plaintiffs sought Tk. 746,50,83,973/- as damages for the losses caused
by the two blowouts, plus 12% interest (the “Money Suit”). !°*

The Claimant relies on the proceedings it brought before the present
Tribunals, seeking the Compensation Declaration; it takes the position
that the claims in the Money Suit are in the exclusive jurisdiction of these
Tribunals (see above Section 2.3).

The proceedings in the Money Suit are still pending. These proceedings
and related requests for provisional measures have been discussed in the
First Decision on the Payment Claim. Following the Tribunals’ Decision
on Exclusivity, the Claimant raised the status of the Money suit on 12
August 2016:

Petrobangla is actively and vigorously pursuing in this forum claims
that fall within the Tribunals’ exclusive jurisdiction. The court is
currently hearing witness testimony from various officers and
representatives from Petrobangla, the Government of Bangladesh,
and BAPEX on the blowouts and the consequences of the blowouts at
Chattak. On 25 July 2016, Niko filed an application for adjournment

based on the Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity. Petrobangla did
nothing to support Niko’s application. Indeed, the Respondents make
no mention of actions taken in the Money Suit in their 8 August letter,
ignoring the Tribunals’ Decision and direction in Procedural Order No.
14. The court heard this application on 1 August 2016. By order dated
8 August 2016, the court rejected Niko’s application for adjournment.
It should be noted that on 24 May 2016 the High Court Division
directed the Money Suit court “to proceed to complete the trial of the
suit as expeditiously as possible preferably within 4 (four) months
from the date of receipt of this order.” The court has indicated that it
will set dates on biweekly intervals. Therefore, dates are being fixed
in quick succession and the next date for the suit has been fixed for
18 August 2016 for the continuation of examination of the plaintiffs’
witness. Thus, Respondents are pushing the Money Suit toward a
speedy resolution in conflict with and in contravention of the
Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity, while delaying these arbitrations,
in an effort to resolve the suit before the Tribunals finally resolve the
Compensation Declaration.

The Claimant corrected this statement on 12 August 2016, by stating
that Petrobangla actively opposed Niko’s application for adjournment.

The Respondents objected in their letter of 19 August 2016, asserting
that the continuation of the Money Suit did not interfere with the
exclusive jurisdiction of these Tribunals.

The latest information made available to the Tribunals about these
proceedings are references to the Money Suit contained in the written
version of the Alam Judgment of November 2017. The judgment mentions
information provided by counsel, stating that the case is “now
pending’ .105

2.6.3 Criminal Proceedings in Bangladesh

The Respondents explain that, as soon as the BNP Government left office,
the corruption during that period became the object of criminal
investigations. BAPEX stated in its Memorial on Damages that the
caretaker government, installed in Bangladesh on 12 January 2007,
“spearheaded a massive anti-graft campaign, resulting in the arrest of the

former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and others involved in the Niko
corruption’.

In Bangladesh these investigations were conducted by the ACC. The
investigations in Bangladesh were joined and supported by those of the
Canadian RCMP and the U.S. FBI.

Mr Khan testified that he and his company Octokhan were engaged in
2007 “to provide key strategic services to the [ACC)’.1°° From then on he
was actively involved in the investigations.

Ms LaPrevotte explained that in 2007 the interim caretaker Government
in Bangladesh requested the assistance of the United States to
investigate corruption in Bangladesh. The request for international
cooperation was forwarded to the Department of Justice where it was
assigned to Ms Linda Samuel, the then Deputy Chief of the Asset
Forfeiture and Money Laundering Section. The investigative aspect of the
request was assigned to Ms LaPrevotte at the FBI. In January 2008, Ms
Samuel and Ms LaPrevotte travelled to Bangladesh to meet with their
counterparts and began their investigation. !°7

The Canadian investigations were initiated in June 2005, alerted by the
news concerning a possible violation of the Corruption of Public Officials
Act by Niko in the context of the delivery of the vehicle to the State
Minister. 108

The three law enforcement agencies cooperated closely and produced the
vast amount of evidence that is described in further detail below in
Section 8.1. The investigations had different results in the three countries
of the Investigators.

In Bangladesh proceedings were commenced in 2008 in connection with
the JVA both against the Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and others and
against former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and others.

The ACC Charge Sheet against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has not
been produced. The description of the charges against former Prime

Minister Khaleda Zia in the Charge Sheet of 5 May 2008, on the other
hand, contains the following passage:

using deceitful means, disregarding the opinions of technical
experts of various levels from Petrobangla, BAPEX and Sylhet Gas
Field Limited and without following any act, policy or procedures, the
then Prime Minister (Sheikh Hasina) approved an illegal system called
“Procedure for Developing Terminal [sic] and Abandoned Gas Fields”
on 14-6-2001.109

Later the charge against Sheikh Hasina stated that she “approved the
‘Procedure for Development of Marginal and Abandoned Gas Fields’ in
which Chattak, Feni and Kamta gas fields were identified as marginal and
abandoned with instruction to finalise a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) for
extraction of gas by NIKO from those fields and place the JVA before the
Government for approval’.110

Comparing the case against Sheikh Hasina with that against Begum
Khaleda Zia, the High Court Division in an order of 5 November 2015
concluded that there was “no such allegation that the process of approving
the ‘procedure’ by her involved any unlawful financial or other
transaction”.111 The criminal proceedings against Sheikh Hasina were
quashed. 112

The charges against former Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia and
others were set out in the ACC Charge Sheet of 5 May 2008 just quoted.
This Charge Sheet concerned allegations of corruption in relation to the
conclusion of the JVA and included Begum Khaleda Zia, the former Law
Minister Barrister Moudud Ahmed, the former State Minister AKM
Mosharraf Hossain and others.!!5° The events described in this Charge

“accused persons”; towards the end of the text, a list of 11 persons is given, including Qasim Sharif. During

Sheet, relied on the “evidence of payments made to obtain the JVA |...]
discovered by the ACC investigation” .114

Proceedings against the Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Mr Sharif and others
were suspended in 2008. The suspension order has not been produced;
but BAPEX produced the Order by which, seven years later, on 5
November 2015, the High Court Division of the Supreme Court
discharged the suspension order and permitted the trial to go forward.!15
That Order distinguished the case of the petitioner Begum Khaleda Zia,
charged with involvement in the approval of the JVA “as an abettor in the
alleged offence”, from that of the former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina
and her approval of the Marginal Fields Procedure for which there was
no allegation that the process by her “involves any unlawful financial of
other transaction”. The court found that the difference was “the alleged
offence of giving and receiving bribe which is absent in the case of Sheikh
Hasina’ .116

No information was provided on any subsequent action taking place until
on 12 February 2018, when the Respondents wrote to the Tribunals
informing them, based on press reports, that “a hearing to indict Ms Zia,
Mr Rahman, Dr Siddiqui, former law minister Moudud Ahmed, former state
minister for energy AKM Mosharrraf Hossain, Niko’s former president
Qasim Sharif, and others for their use of corruption in the award of gas
exploration and exploitation rights to Niko has been set for 11 March 2018.”

On 9 November 2018 the Respondents wrote to the Tribunals informing
them that

the trials in Bangladesh of former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia and 10
others on charges of approving the procedure of concluding the JVA
with Niko by corrupt and illegal means, among others, began
yesterday, November 8, 2018. Former State Minister for Energy AKM
Mosharraf Hossain, former Law Minister Moudud Ahmed, former
Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Kamal Siddiqui, former President
of Niko Qasim Sharif, Selim Bhuiyan, and Giasuddin al Mamoon are
among the accused now standing trial.

2.7 Proceedings in Canada and the United States

374.

375.

376.

377.

In Canada, the investigations led to the conviction of Niko on the basis
of the Agreed Statement of Facts of 23 June 2011.!!7 The only charges
held against Niko were the delivery of the vehicle to the State Minister
and the non-business-related expenses of his trip to Canada in 2005.
Details have been described in the Decision on Jurisdiction and are
summarised below in Section 10.1. The Agreed Statement of Facts
records that “the Crown is unable to prove that any influence was obtained
as a result of providing the benefits to the Minister’.118 The question
whether the evidence gathered by the RCMP, as asserted by Mr Khan,
supported the conclusion that other cases of corruption occurred, will be
considered below in Section 8.1. The Tribunals note, however, that no
other alleged acts of corruption were held against Niko in Canada.

With respect to the investigation in the United States, Ms LaPrevotte
testified that the FBI investigated the corruption allegation because it
determined “a strong nexus to the U.S.” since Niko’s consultant and
President of Niko Bangladesh was a U.S. citizen. Ms LaPrevotte
participated actively in the Joint Investigation, dealing with the Niko case
and with several others. She described the results of her investigation in
her witness statements and at the Hearing.

Ms LaPrevotte expressed her conviction that “the F.B.I. had a strong case
to seize and forfeit the corruptly obtained assets of the U.S. citizen
employed by Niko”,'!9 i.e. Mr Sharif, the principal representative of Niko
during the negotiations for the JVA. She also asserted that “there was
never any question of a lack of evidence that Niko engaged in bribery”. 12°

Nevertheless, the United States Department of Justice determined in
August 2011 “that it will discontinue its inquiry into potential violations of

the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) by Niko Resources Ltd. (Niko)’.
The Department explained:

While we have determined that prosecution is not necessary at this
time in light of Niko’s guilty plea in Canada, this letter should not be
taken as an indication that we do not have concerns about Niko’s
compliance with FCPA.121

378. The Department strongly encouraged Niko to adopt and implement
policies and attached a “Corporate Compliance Program” to its letter. It
also pointed out that “the Department may decide to restart this inquiry at
any time”. The Tribunals have not been informed of any other action
taken in the United States against Mr Sharif of Niko in relation to the
project in Bangladesh.

3 THE RELIEF REQUESTED

379. In its submission of 25 March 2016, BAPEX requested the following
relief:

BAPEX requests that the Tribunal:

a. Declare that Niko procured the Joint Venture Agreement
between BAPEX and Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd of 16 October
2003 through corruption;

b. Declare that Claimant is not entitled to use the international
arbitration system to pursue claims related to the JVA;

c. Declare that the JVA is voidable, recognize BAPEX’s invocation
of its right to void the JVA, and treat the JVA as void;

d. Dismiss all of Claimant’s claims asserted in this arbitration;

e. Declare that BAPEX is entitled to compensation for all of its
losses arising from Niko’s corrupt procurement of the JVA, including
all losses resulting from the two blowouts that occurred at the Chattak
Field;

f. In the alternative, should the Tribunal determine that the JVA
is not voidable or voided, declare that Niko must compensate BAPEX
for the harms arising from Niko’s breaches of the JVA, including all
losses resulting from the two blowouts that occurred at the Chattak
Field;

g- Order Claimant to pay damages of $118 million for BAPEX’s
losses;

h. Should the Tribunal make a determination of the Government’s
losses, order Claimant to pay damages of $896 million for the
Government’s gas losses and- 215 -between US$ 8,461,463 and
$8,642,493 to cover the expenses of monitoring, surveying and
abatement and to hold this proceeding open until such time as a
complete survey and monitoring of the Tengratila area can be
conducted and BAPEX can provide the fullest possible accounting of
environmental and health related losses;

i. Order prejudgment and post-award interest on all sums
awarded;

114

380.

381.

382.

je Order Claimant to pay all the expenses and costs associated
with defending against these proceedings, including BAPEX’s
attorneys’ and expert witnesses’ fees and expenses, the fees and
expenses of ICSID and the members of the Tribunal, and the charges
for the use of hearing facilities;

k. Grant BAPEX any other remedy that the Tribunal considers
appropriate.

In a separate letter of the same date Petrobangla made the following
statements and requests:

[...] Petrobangla approves of and adopts BAPEX’s recitation of the
facts and legal consequences of Niko’s use of corruption and bribes to
obtain the JVA and the GPSA.

In light of those facts and legal consequences, Petrobangla requests
that the Tribunal find that the GPSA was procured by corruption and
is thus voidable. It further informs the Tribunal of it decision to rescind
the GPSA.

As a result, Niko’s claims based on the GPSA must be rejected. Niko
cannot found claims before this international tribunal on its own bad
acts. [...]

Accordingly, Petrobangla requests that the Tribunal vacate its
Decision on the Payment Claim of 11 September 2014 as well as its
14 September 2015 Decision on Implementation of that prior decision,
and enter an award dismissing Niko’s claims. Petrobangla further
requests that the Tribunal order Niko to bear all the costs of these
proceedings and reimburse Petrobangla for all of its legal fees and
expenses.

On 29 April 2016 the Respondents modified the relief they requested.

BAPEX modified its request in items (c) and (f), changing in particular the
request for a declaration that the JVA is voidable and avoided to a
declaration that the JVA is void and only in the alternative voidable. The
following modifications were made in these two respects:

c.) Declare that the JVA is void or, in the alternative, declare that
the JVA is voidable, recognize BAPEX’s invocation of its right to void
the JVA, and treat the JVA as void;

 

f) In the alternative, should the Tribunal determine that the JVA
is not voideble or voided and proceed to adjudicate _Niko’s claims,

115

383.

384.

385.

declare that Niko must compensate BAPEX for the harms-arisingfrom
amount it determines is owed by Niko for Niko’s breaches of the JVA,
including all losses resulting from the two blowouts that occurred at
the Chattak Field.

In their cover letter of 29 April 2016, the Respondents developed their
position and stated in their “Concluding Remarks”:

For the foregoing reasons, Respondents submit that Niko is not
entitled to any payment or credit for past performance. As a result of
Niko’s corruption, the Tribunal should reject all of Niko’s claims and
any attempt by Niko to have the Tribunal give it a benefit for its corrupt
acts. In addition, in accordance with the above, Respondents would
like to modify their requests to the Tribunal.

The new request was expressed as follows:

Respondents first ask that the Tribunal recognize that the JVA and
GPSA are void under Bangladeshi law and without legal effect. In the
alternative, Respondents maintain their request to void the
agreements.

These requests were modified again in paragraph 196 of the
Respondents’ Memorial on Corruption of 23 November 2016 as follows:

a) Declare that Niko used corruption in the establishment and
maintenance of the investment with respect to which it seeks to
use the ICSID Convention arbitration system;

b,

LL

Declare that, as a result of this use of corruption and other actions,
Niko established its investment (i) in violation of the international
law principle of good faith, (ii) in breach of the international public
policy against corruption and (iii) in violation of Bangladeshi law;

CG

eg

Declare that, as a result of a) and b) above, all of Niko’s claims in
these arbitrations must be dismissed;

d) Declare that bribery was used to influence the Government’s
approval of the Joint Venture Agreement between BAPEX and Niko
Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd of 16 October 2003 and the Gas
Purchase and Sale Agreement between Petrobangla and the Joint
Venture partners of 27 December 2006, that the Government’s
approval was not transparent, was mala fide, and was illegal
under Bangladeshi law, and that, as a result, these agreements
are without legal effect and void ab initio;

116

e) Declare that as a result of d) above, all of Niko’s claims based on
the JVA and GPSA and their performance must be dismissed; and

f) Dismiss all of Niko’s claims.

386. In their Reply on Corruption of 22 February 2017, the Respondents
expressed their request for relief as follows:

Niko systematically used corruption in the establishment and
maintenance of its investment in Bangladesh and in obtaining the
Government's approval of the JVA and GPSA. As a result, all of Niko's
claims must be dismissed.

For all of the foregoing reasons, Respondents request the Tribunals
find that they do not have jurisdiction. If the Tribunals exercise
jurisdiction, Respondents affirm the request for relief in paragraph
196 of the Memorial.

387. In the First Post-Hearing Brief of 20 July 2017 the Respondents
expressed their “Conclusions and Submissions” in the following terms:

Respondents affirm and incorporate by reference their prior requests
for relief in their Memorial and Reply on Corruption and request that
the Tribunals:

¢ Order Claimant to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration
and reimburse Respondents for all their legal and expert fees
and costs, plus interest from the time of the Award until
payment is made, in an amount and at a rate to be established
at the appropriate time.

In the alternative, if the Tribunals find that the Agreements are not
void ab initio but voidable, Respondents request that they:

e declare that the JVA and GPSA are void with retroactive effect
and that the parties cannot maintain any claims in these
arbitrations, or

e dismiss all of Claimant’s claims and award BAPEX damages
as claimed in its Memorial on Damages, and to the extent the
Tribunals find that either party might be entitled to payment
under the Agreements, in restitution or otherwise, conduct
further proceedings on the quantum of such payment.

388. In their Second Post-Hearing Brief of 2 August 2017, the Respondents
confirmed these earlier requests as follows:

117

389.

Based on the foregoing, Respondents request that the Tribunals
dismiss all of Claimant’s claims and order Claimant to pay all costs,
expenses, and fees of these proceedings. Respondents hereby affirm
and incorporate by reference their prior requests for relief in the
Memorial on Corruption, Reply on Corruption, and first Post-Hearing
Brief on Corruption.

The Claimant’s request for relief remained essentially unchanged
throughout the proceedings on the Corruption Claim and, in its Second
Post-Hearing Brief of 2 August 2017, took the form of the following
request:

Q

2

Dismiss the Respondents’ Corruption Claim;

b,

LL

Release their Decision on Liability in the Compensation
Declaration forthwith;

CG

eg

If necessary in light of that Decision on Liability, order the
damages phase to resume in the Compensation Declaration;

d) Fix a prompt schedule for costs statements in the Payment
Claim in order to place the Tribunals in a position to render a
final award in that case as soon as possible; and

e

2

Order such other and further relief as the Tribunals may deem
appropriate in the circumstances.

118

4 THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND

390.

The Corruption Claim is based on allegations of corruption in the course
of the negotiations of the JVA and the GPSA and their conclusion. The
history of these negotiations has been considered in previous decisions,
in particular the Decision on Jurisdiction and the Decisions on the
Payment Claim. The Tribunals present here an overview of the facts
relating to these negotiations as they emerged from the extensive
additional evidence produced at this stage of the proceedings. Certain
aspects of these negotiations are discussed in further detail in
subsequent sections, where they are particularly relevant.

4.1 The JVA and its negotiation history

391.

392.

393.

The history of the negotiations leading to the JVA has been described in
in particular in the Decision on Jurisdiction.!22. Since then the
Respondents’ argument has evolved substantially and large amounts of
additional evidence have been produced. The Tribunals therefore have
reconsidered this history in its entirety.

In 1997 Niko Canada made proposals for two projects in Bangladesh, one
in response to an invitation to bid by Petrobangla, the other on its own
initiative.

The first of these proposals was made in the context of the “Second Round
of PSC [Production Sharing Contract] Bids” for oil and gas fields (the
“1997 PSC bids’). In response to the invitation to bid for PSCs concerning
at least 12 blocks, some 15 bids were received from a number of
companies, including many of the major oil companies.!?° Niko Canada
bid for Blocks 9 and 10. Although Niko Canada’s bid was not accepted,
the procedure is relevant for the case, in particular because, when
discussing the qualification of Niko for the work under the JVA, the
Respondents rely on Niko Canada’s ranking in the evaluation of the PSC
bids, which overall was the lowest with respect to both blocks.

122 Decision on Jurisdiction, pp. 14-20.
128 These numbers of blocks and of bidders appear from a table attached to the Arthur Andersen letter of
28 September 1997 (in Exhibit R-212).

119

394. Despite the frequent reference that is made to the 1997 PSC bids, there
is very little evidence about the procedure. Indeed, the only documentary
evidence from this bidding process produced in the Arbitrations is a letter
from Arthur Andersen, London, dated 29 September 1997, together with
the list of codes for the bidders and a document entitled “Attachment 3 -
Preliminary Scorecard, Run Categorising Bids” containing evaluations for
Blocks 9 and 10. In the letter, Arthur Andersen, which was apparently
retained by Petrobangla as adviser in this bid round, describes some
aspects of the evaluation that had taken place by the time of the letter.
The letter concludes by looking forward “to receiving instructions that the
bid Negotiating Committee has been appointed in order that we may return
to Dhaka to commence the formulation of the negotiating strategy for each
block” .124

395. It is not clear when, if at all, Niko Canada was officially informed about
the result of its bid. A fax message by the Canadian Department of
Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade to the Coordinator, South Asia
Division, PSA, dated 11 May 1998,125 reports that the decision on Blocks
9 and 10 had been deferred. The score of Niko in this evaluation, the
criteria used, and the relevance for the conclusion of the JVA will be
discussed in further detail below in Section 9.1 when the qualifications
of Niko for the work in relation to marginal/abandoned fields will be
examined.

396. The other proposal made by Niko in 1997 concerned the Sylhet field (the
“1997 Sylhet Proposal”): Also in 1997 Niko Canada initiated another
project in Bangladesh, distinct from the 1997 PSC bid round. On 12 April
1997 Niko Canada made a preliminary proposal to the Minister of Energy
and Mining, which has not been produced in the Arbitrations but was
referred to in subsequent correspondence.!2© From the Agreement
between Niko Canada and Five Feathers, dated 15 August 1997,127 one
may conclude that this preliminary proposal concerned a joint venture
with Sylhet Gas Field Ltd. “for the development, production and marketing

126 The letter of Niko Canada of 1 February 1999, Exhibit R-269, mentions the letter of that date with a
preliminary proposal as the first contact of Niko with the Bangladesh authorities.

of hydrocarbons from the Beanibazar and Fechuganj Gas Fields located in
Sylhet, Bangladesh’.

On 4 September 1997, Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Limited, the
Claimant, was incorporated in Barbados. !28

After some further correspondence, !29 Niko Resources Ltd was invited to
make a presentation to the Ministry on 21 June 1998. This presentation
was followed by a letter of 28 June 1998 in which the proposal of Niko
Canada was further developed (the “Niko’s Proposal”).!°° The letter was
captioned: “Marginal and Non-Producing Gas Fields Development and
Production: Chattak, Fenchganj, Beanibazar and Kamta”. Niko Canada
explained the interest that Bangladesh should have in developing
marginal and non-producing gas fields and Niko Canada’s qualifications
to do so, including its recent success in developing marginal fields in
India. It proposed

... to form a joint venture with BAPEX and develop and produce the
gas resources from the subject non-producing marginal fields at its
sole risk and expense but under terms and conditions that
internationally prevail in the development of marginal fields and are
acceptable to Petrobangla. Niko is capable of operating at a
substantially reduced cost in comparison to the larger foreign
companies currently working in Bangladesh.'3!

Niko Canada proposed the following sequence for the conclusion of the
joint venture:

A. To our understanding since Niko is the first international
company to promote the development of the marginal fields, the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources may execute an MOU
with Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. A copy of the MOU is
attached for your consideration.

128 See Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 187.

129 The letter of Niko Canada, dated 1 February 1999, Exhibit R-269, mentions two letters to the Minister
and to the Secretary of the Ministry of Energy and Mining, dated 28 September 1997 and 27 May 1998;
these letters have not been produced in the Arbitrations.

400.

401.

402.

B. Upon execution of the MOU, the terms and conditions of the
contract are negotiated between Petrobangla and Niko and a
draft contract is prepared.

C. Petrobangla then makes a public announcement of the project
complete with the finalised terms and conditions...152

The June 1998 Proposal went on to describe in some detail a procedure,
referred to as “Swiss Challenge”, to the effect that any proposals received
further to the announcement as well as the one previously negotiated
with Niko would be evaluated. If Niko were not to receive the highest
mark, it would be given an opportunity to match the highest ranked
proposal. The Claimant described it as “in essence providing a right of first
refusal in favour of Niko”.133 The procedure will be discussed in further
detail below (see Section 9.5).

The June 1998 Proposal continued to explain that Niko Canada was
pursuing the possibility of financing of the project by the Canadian
International Development Agency (the “CIDA”). Attached to the letter
were (i) the draft of a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU), (ii) a
presentation by Niko Canada entitled “Niko Resources Ltd. Corporate
Profile May 1998” providing information on the history and other projects
of the company, in particular those in India and Nigeria, as well as
financial information, and (iii) a one page presentation of Five Feathers,
listing 25 “international reputed companies” which it represented.

Petrobangla’s 1998 Comments: !*4 Following the meeting and proposal,
Petrobangla prepared, at the request of the MENR, comments on the
proposal. These comments had as attachment the comments which
BAPEX had prepared at the request of Petrobangla. The Respondents
have produced Petrobangla’s comments but not the enclosed comments
from BAPEX. Petrobangla’s comments are not dated, but they refer to the
June 1998 Proposal as having been made “recently”; the Tribunal

assumes therefore that they date from the second half of 1998, but prior
to 13 November 1998.1!95

Petrobangla’s 1998 Comments were first produced in the Arbitrations by
the Respondents in their submission on Procedural Order No 13 of the
14 June 2016 (the “R-PO13”), in which the Respondents relied on the
1998 Comments and quoted from them to highlight the importance of the
Swiss Challenge process. 16 In later submissions, the Respondents raised
“doubts about the provenance of this document’.!37 The Respondents note
that the 1998 Comments, contrary to other internal Petrobangla and
Government documents, are in English and “include much of the same
language” as Niko’s proposal. They also point out that Mr Sharif, Vice
President of Niko Bangladesh, had obtained a copy of the document and
had transmitted it to Niko. 158

The Tribunals note that none of these doubts were expressed by the
Respondents when they first produced the 1998 Comments and relied on
them. The Respondents do not find it surprising that comments on a
proposal made in English are made in the same language, and observe
that the fact that Mr Sharif obtained a copy of the document does not
speak against its authenticity. The Tribunals see no reason to doubt that
the document reflects the considered joint opinion of BAPEX and
Petrobangla.

Petrobangla’s 1998 Comments provide a description of Niko’s proposal
and of the company profile, Niko’s financial position and experience. The
document contains observations on the desirability of developing
“marginal fields” in general and the identified fields in particular, stating
“the sooner these fields can be brought into production the better’. It points
out the advantages of Niko’s proposal, explaining that “Niko’s straight
and clear offer to take BAPEX into a joint venture (JV) is certainly attractive
- especially when a lot of IOC's have shunned this possibility”. Petrobangla
concludes:

There are no risks to Petrobangla even though marginal field
development can become risky and unprofitable if the operator is not
extra careful with costs. We have not much to lose, if anything, we

have rather much to gain if a proper MOU/contract is entered into
safeguarding our basic interests.

The 1998 Comments then recommend “that the Swiss Challenge process
be adopted as proposed by Niko in their offer to ensure transparency in the
award process” and discuss the advantages of this process. Comments
are made concerning the choice of the fields, and the following
observation as to the profitability of the project:

Due to the low costs of this gas the financial benefit gained by
Petrobangla for producing the marginal fields will be higher than gas
produced by the existing PSC contractors from the first bid round.

Following the 1998 Comments, the Board of Petrobangla seems to have
approved the project and to have passed a resolution to privatise the
marginal fields. In November 1998, Mr Sharif reported to Niko Canada
that

... the file is now with Secretary, MOEMR, who will present it to the
panel of 4 Secretaries called the High Level Committee of which he is
the convener. Upon approval of the High level committee, we will be
called to execute the MOU with the Govt. [...] It appears that the MOU
will be before Christmas but bear in mind that they are still in the
planning stage to start the negotiation on the blocks in Dec. After the
MOU the ball will be back in Petrobangla’s court to negotiate with us
and satisfy the requirements of the swiss challenge process before
signing the contract. Since we already have Petrobangla board
approval of our proposal the hardest part of the work is done. ...139

On 25 November 1998 CIDA informed Niko Canada that its request for a
“contribution under CIDA’s Industrial Cooperation Programme” had been
granted in the amount not exceeding 101,650 Canadian Dollars for a
“Viability Study - Revitalisation of gas fields - Bangladesh”.!4° Niko
Canada informed Petrobangla on 30 December 1998 of this approval,
specifying that the funding was for “the initiation of our work — the
engineering studies for this project’. It also requested a quick response
about the status of its proposal.!4!

At a high-level meeting on 26 January 1999 at the Ministry and attended
also by Petrobangla and BAPEX, the Niko project was discussed and it
was decided that a joint venture agreement between BAPEX and Niko
should be finalised, followed by a MoU; “Swiss Challenge Method might
be abided by’. '*2 The decision of the Government to proceed with the
Niko project was formally communicated by the Ministry to Petrobangla
in a letter of 25 May 1999, to which frequent reference has been made
and which is discussed in further detail below in Section 9.2.

In the meantime, Niko Canada had written to BAPEX on 1 February
1999, referring to the past correspondence with the Ministry and
Petrobangla. It had pointed out that “the cornerstone of our proposal is
the partnership we seek with BAPEX” and listed the principal benefits to
BAPEX of its proposal. It emphasised the importance of the “high risk
Chattak field where more than 80% of the gas reserves are expected in the
unexplored and un-drilled high risk side of the fault’. Niko also explained
the value of the CIDA financing and the risk of losing it, adding that it
was “keen to have your assistance as our proposed joint venture partner
in getting a feedback from Petrobangla and/or the MOEMR regarding
status of our application.” The letter concluded:

Our proposal for the subject project is based upon utilising the
transparent process of Swiss Challenge as the award process to
ensure a public solicitation and availing the best offer from qualified
parties. We seek your assistance in initiating this process in an
expeditious manner so that we don’t loose the CIDA grant and also
any subsequent CIDA support due top long delays.

BAPEX responded on 6 May 1999, inviting Niko to send its “authorized
representative to draft the Joint Venture Agreement as early as
possible” .143

It then turned out that BAPEX’s invitation of 6 May 1999 did not lead to
the conclusion of the envisaged Joint Venture. Mr Sampson, Executive
Chairman of Niko Canada recalled in his letter of 26 February 2003 that
events took a different course. In that letter he wrote:

. we have complied with all requirements on our part to execute the
Bapex-Niko JVA. In May 1999, we were invited by Bapex, upon

approval of and instructions from the Government of Bangladesh, to
finalise the Joint Venture Agreement, but instead after we arrived in
Dhaka, we were asked to do a feasibility study at our cost. Niko
relented ...144

Indeed, BAPEX and Niko did conclude a Joint Venture Agreement on 23
August 1999; but this agreement was not for the development of the fields
but a “Framework of Understanding”, providing for a Study of Chattak,
Feni and Kamta fields jointly by BAPEX and Niko, but at the sole expense
of Niko. The circumstances of this change in approach shall be discussed
below in Section 9.3.

From 1999, Mr Qasim Sharif and his company Stratum were retained as
consultants, acting as Niko Canada’s principal representatives in
Bangladesh. Mr Sharif and Stratum’s roles are discussed in further detail
below in Section 10.3.3.

The Framework of Understanding, also referred to as FOU or the Study
Agreement,'!45 was executed on 23 August 1999 by BAPEX and Niko.
Its full title is “Framework of Understanding for the Study for Development
and Production of Hydrocarbon from the Non-producing Marginal Gas
Fields of Chattak, Feni and Kamta”.

The FOU states:

Niko Resources agrees to form a Joint Venture with BAPEX” for the
purpose of study for the development and production of hydrocarbons
from the non-producing marginal gas fields ... utilizing all available
existing technical data, reports and information, and employing the
integration of multidisciplinary techniques such as regional and local
geology, geophysics, biostratigraphy, geochemistry, petrophysics,
reservoir and drilling engineering, economics and risk analysis.'46

The parties undertook to conduct what they described as a Technical
Program, carried out under the joint responsibility of BAPEX and Niko;!47
this program is defined as a study

. to provide for the estimation of recoverable reserves within the
structures in the Study Area and to attempt to predict the production
characteristics of proven and potential reservoirs in the Study Area. !48

An additional purpose of the FOU/Study Agreement is mentioned in
Article 4.03:

Upon completion of the Technical Program, the Joint Study Team shall
prepare a full development plan of the fields.

The agreement provides that BAPEX shall make available its “logs, drilling
reports and other information required during the drilling in the Study
Area” (BAPEX Information) !49 and certain other assistance; the promised
assistance includes obtaining permits, licenses, permissions etc. from
various government agencies

... for undertaking the Technical Study and for the development and
production of the fields are obtained in a timely manner.!°°

The FOU/Study Agreement also provides that each party would supply
one geologist and one geophysicist to perform work on the Technical
Program; additional specialised professionals were to be supplied by
Niko.!5! Article 5.01 provides:

The parties agree that NIKO, having the necessary expertise and
financial capabilities to undertake the activities related to the
development and production of the Gas Fields will be responsible
including all cost of the Technical Program and for the execution of the
work Program. Niko shall bear and pay the travel and living expenses
for four (4) BAPEX officials (one Geologist, one Geophysicist, one
Petroleum Engineer and one Process Facility Engineer) in Canada for
a period 4 — 6 weeks each to perform work on the technical program.

In Article 5.05, the parties agreed to endeavour to complete the Technical
Program in six weeks and then added an exclusivity provision:

During the negotiations period, BAPEX agrees that it will not directly
or indirectly:

a) encourage, entertain, solicit or engage in negotiations or
discussions with any party other than Niko with respect to this
project or

b) enter into any agreement or takes [sic] any action that by its
terms or effect could reasonable is [sic] expected to adversely
affect the ability of Niko to implement the project.

It must be noted, however, that the agreement does not define the
“negotiations period”.

As explained, the Study Agreement distinguishes between “BAPEX
information” and “Program information”. It contains a confidentiality
clause concerning the former in Articles 1.03 and 3.01 to 3.04. Program
Information is defined in Article 1.04 as “all information, except BAPEX
information, relating to the Technical Program, that is developed or
otherwise acquired by one or both Parties as a result of and during the
Technical Program”. With respect to this latter information, Article 7
contains inter alia the following provision:

Both Parties agree that Program Information shall be kept strictly
confidential and shall not be sold, traded, published, or otherwise
disclosed to anyone in any manner whatsoever, including by means
of photocopy of reproduction without the other party’s prior written
consent for a period of three (3) years after the program is completed,
except as provided in paragraph 7.02 and 7.03. If swiss challenge
process is adopted, this is not applicable.

This is the only reference in the agreement to the Swiss Challenge
procedure.

Article 9, entitled “Joint Venture Agreement” provides the following:

The parties agreed that on successful completion of the Technical
Program & on the basis of the acceptability of the result thereof the
parties would execute a Joint Venture Agreement.

Finally, elements procured under CIDA financing were to become the
property of BAPEX.

Clause 12.05 provided that the effectiveness of the FOU was “subject to
the approval of the appropriate authority” .152

152 FOU, Article 12.05.

The agreement has an “Exhibit A” to which Article 1.01 refers when
defining the contract term “The Area”. The Exhibit gives the “Coordinates
of the Ring Fencing of Chattak, Feni and Kamta Structures”, as well as
the area in square kilometres and the depth of the structures.

Pursuant to the Framework of Understanding, BAPEX and Niko jointly
evaluated the three identified fields.!5° Niko claims that it spent USD1.5
million on this work.!5¢ BAPEX and Niko prepared a report on this
evaluation, the Study provided by the FOU, and described it as the
Marginal Fields Evaluation (the “MFE”) dated February 2000. An
annex reported on the conclusion reached at a meeting of the technical
staff of both BAPEX and Niko on 8 November 1999 “to verify the
interpretation of seismic and well data over the Chattak, Feni and Kamta
fields and to establish common agreement for the recoverable reserves
remaining these fields”. The Study and this annex, together with some of
the Figures mentioned in the Study, form Annex B to the JVA.

The Study identified five contributors of various technical qualifications
from each company, including on Niko’s side Robert Ohlson, who as
President of Niko Canada had signed the June 1998 Proposal; and, on
BAPEX’s side, Mir Moinul Huq, Senior General Manager. The report is
signed by Syed Ahmed Haqqani, General Manager - BAPEX and Dr
Emmanuel O. Egbogah, P. Eng., Vice President International Production
— Niko.

The opening paragraph of the Study contains the following passage:

The technical staff of BAPEX and Niko Resources Ltd. both share a
common view of these three fields. Both partners agree with the
proposed recoverable reserves established in the three fields.

The Study provides a description of the geological setting of the “three
fields Chattak, Feni and Kamta”, followed by more detailed descriptions
concerning each of the fields. In the table showing the reserves, the three
fields are identified: Feni, Kamta and Chattak, without subdivision. The
same goes for the “Block Definition” which for each field identifies the

153 Marginal Fields Evaluation, Annex B to the JVA; the complete report has been produced as Exhibit R-

Coordinates the Area, and the Depth, treating the Chattak Gas Field as
a single unit.

433. With respect to Chattak, the Study does, however, contain separate
descriptions for the “Chattak West Field” and the “Chattak East Field”. It
speaks of the Chattak East exploration structure but provides that, in
case of success there, the well will be tied into the Chattak West
development plan.

434. The Study reported on a “technical program” held for four weeks in
Calgary in which four delegates from BAPEX participated. It concluded:

During this technical program BAPEX-Niko jointly reviewed and
concurred upon the following aspects of the study:

1) Based upon the current data, the remaining, recoverable, and
risked proven and probable gas reserves of the Chattak field
has been estimated at 268 BCF, the Feni field has been
estimated at 51 BCF, and Kamta field has been estimated at 5
BCF.

LY

It has been observed that there are significant gaps in the
existing data and additional data for Chattak and Feni are
essential to do effective reservoir characterisation of these
fields. These data can be obtained after drilling the first well in
each of these two fields.

[oJ

Based upon the result of the study as indicated in the currently
established reserves stated above, a joint venture contract may be
executed between BAPEX and Niko as stipulated in the study upon
approval of Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources.

435. While the study under the FOU was ongoing, Niko submitted to BAPEX
on 7 November 1999 the first draft for the JVA.!55 Two subsequent
drafts were presented in May and June 2000 but have not been

155 Draft JVA, 7 November 1999, Exhibit R-336. The draft is not dated but the Respondents identified the

meeting of 22 October 2000; Exhibit R-271, p. 1, paragraph 2; The Minutes of the Niko Board of Directors
meeting on 23 March 2000 state that the draft JVA was submitted to the Government in late November

in the Arbitrations is that of September 2000,'57 it was followed by the
drafts of 3 July 2001,!58 December 2001159 and 13 January 2003. 16°

436. BAPEX formed a committee for the negotiations with Niko (the BAPEX
JVA Committee) which examined the November 1999 draft JVA and
submitted its report on 27 March 2000.'!6! Negotiations for the JVA
between BAPEX and Niko started in March 2000.!©2 The BAPEX JVA
Committee issued a final report dated 23 May 2000 (the “BAPEX May
2000 Report”).'®° Neither the Minutes of the Committee (if there were
any) nor the March and May 2000 reports have been produced in the
Arbitrations. There is, however, reference to the BAPEX May 2000 Report
in a letter of Niko, which seems to indicate that in this report the Chattak
Gas field was “intact, that is including Chattak East, in the project”. Niko
asserted that it agreed to all terms and conditions of the BAPEX May
2000 report “and the draft JVA was prepared based upon this report’.
According to Niko, it was only one of the “numerous other changes to the
JVA” which BAPEX made “since this report’, by which “Bapex has taken
out the Chattak East portion of the Chattak Gas Field from the project’;
and this was the only one of the subsequent changes to which Niko did
not agree. 164

437. The BAPEX Board addressed issues of the JVA at a number of occasions
in 2000. The minutes of these meetings have not been produced; but the
Minutes of the 287'* Petrobangla Board meeting of 22 October 2000165

terms of the JVA were discussed at the BAPEX Board meetings on 8 June,
12 June and 21 August 2000.

The issues discussed concern various terms of the JVA, including Niko’s
obligation to provide the capital investment and operating costs and
contributions by BAPEX with existing machinery and assistance, the
Management Committee composition, tax questions and revenue
sharing, the immediate payment by Niko of one Core BDT and its
sponsoring of one “BAPEX officer every year to study a Post-Graduation
Degree in a Canadian University”. At one of the meetings it is specifically
emphasised that “we need to give particular attention to assess whether
the JVA proposed by the company is favourable to our interest’. 16°

Several of the meetings consider the sale of the gas produced and the
price for it. It is pointed out that the JVA terms “are not consistent with
the terms and conditions of PSC’ which may have an effect on the
purchase of the gas./©7 At one of the meetings it is said that “BAPEX will
purchase per MCF gas at a 1.75 USD rate during the Agreement tenure of
the Joint Venture and sell/market the gas as per the end users price
approved by the government time-to-time”. 168

The report on the 114t BAPEX Board meeting on 8 June 2000 contains
the following passage concerning the area of the Joint Venture:

ff Herein before, only Chatak, Feni and Kamta gas fields are
demarked as Non-producing Marginal Fields, however, in the working
paper, Chatak (East) has also been included in the proposal in
addition to those 3 fields. It was remarked that Chatak East area
should remain outside the JVA. Because Chatak (East) structure is a
different exploration target.!©

In these reports on the BAPEX Board meetings no mention is made of
competitive procedures or Swiss Challenge to be followed before the
conclusion of the JVA.

444,

At the last of these meetings the BAPEX Board decided to submit its
decisions concerning the JVA to the Petrobangla Board. That Board
considered the matter on 22 October 2000 at the 287*» meeting. The
Minutes of that meeting!”° start with a report describing the history of
the project and inter alia its economics:

1. Regard financing of the Joint Venture Agreement, BAPEX will
provide with assistance/ information to carry out the stated activities.
Besides, the machineries/tools of BAPEX will be used for the
development and exploration of gas from Chatak, Feni and Kamta
Gas Fields and BAPEX will get Rental/Charge for that service.
However, Niko will bear the expenses of purchasing or renting new
machineries/ tools, hiring foreign experts and anything purchased in
cash (local/ foreign), and BAPEX will have no Cash Involvement for
such expenses.

If the abandoned gas fields can enter into production with commercial
viability, it will help the economic progress of the nation.

In the section dealing with the “discussion”, the Minutes contain the
following passage:

19. The Board was informed that this entity has proposed to
unilaterally develop the Joint Venture-fields, hence this is not possible
to compare this entity with any other entities. The Board was further
informed that in Paragraph ‘C’ of the latter [recte: “letter”?] of the
Ministry date on 05/25/1999 in respect of development and
producing gas the proposal prepared by Niko & BAPEX if it is required
following the Swiss Challenging method by verifying and taking of
steps for implementation has been mentioned. The Board was further
informed that competitive terms have been adopted by calling for the
international tender following this method. The Board had mentioned
that following Swiss Challenge method is mandatory not optional.

The Minutes then record the Board’s decisions:

DECISIONS:

27. After a threadbare discussion, the Board, as per policy direction
of the Ministry, and in accordance with the recommendation of the
118 Meeting held on 08.21.2000 — in order to develop Chattak, Feni

and Kamta Non-producing Marginal gas fields following Swiss
Challenge method - approves sending the undertaken draft Joint
Venture Agreement between Niko and BAPEX to the Ministry for its
decision.

28. The PSC negotiation Committee of Petrobangla, meanwhile, will
examine and observe the prepared Joint Venture Agreement.

29. In respect of transferring of the ownership and the assets and
liabilities of Chattak, Feni and Kamta Gas Fields, Board has advised
the Managing Director of BAPEX to take necessary actions by
communicating with the Managing Directors of the concerned
companies.

Further to this decision Petrobangla must have transmitted the draft JVA
to the Ministry, since on 29 March 2001 the Ministry requested
Petrobangla “to take the necessary steps for finalising the JVA by following
the Swiss challenge method ...”.!71 The instructions were passed on by
Petrobangla to BAPEX on 11 April 2001, transmitting the letter of 29
March 2001 “for your kind acknowledgement and necessary steps to be
taken ...”172

During the first half of 2001 the Ministry prepared a Procedure for
Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields (the “Marginal Fields
Procedure”). During the time when this procedure was being prepared,
there was close interaction between the progress of the work on the
Marginal Fields Procedure and the finalisation of the JVA.

Thus, Niko’s letter to the Ministry of 5 April 2001 referred to the
“policy for the development of marginal/abandoned gas fields” which it
understood the Government was finalising. While welcoming this
initiative, Niko pointed out “that Niko Resources had proposed to develop
marginal and abandoned gas fields in Bangladesh in April 1997, through
a joint venture”. It continued by summarising the development of the
project, including the shift in approach in terms quoted above. The letter
then continued:

Based upon the Study Agreement and the Study Report, Bapex
appointed a Negotiation Committee to negotiate the JVA with Niko.
These negotiations were completed in June 2000 and the Bapex

Negotiations Committee submitted its report on the negotiations to
Bapex management. Niko was asked to conform to the requirements
of Bapex which Niko acceded to and a finalised draft JVA has been
under process in Bapex, Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy ever
since June 2000.

Although we have been advised that the Government approval
process would be complete any day, unfortunately as of today we
have not been advised of any signing date for our JVA even though
we were invited back in May 1999 to negotiate and execute this JVA.

We request you once again to expedite the Government formalities so
that we can execute the JVA and complete all related formalities
without further delay. Since we have already completed the
negotiations on the JVA based upon the Study Agreement, we request
that the implementation of the Niko-Bapex JVA receive retrospective
status and be kept outside the purview of any future policy. 173

Upon receipt of Niko’s letter, the Ministry wrote to Petrobangla on 16 April
2001: “before going for Swiss Challenge, as per instructions you are being
requested to formalize/finalize the JVA submitted by Petrobangla’.!74

The Ministry then wrote on 20 May 2001 to Petrobangla:

Subject: - Policy on Development and Production of Hydrocarbon

from the Marginal and Abandoned gas fields

A draft policy regarding the Development of Marginal and Abandoned
gas fields is sent herewith. In light of this policy it is requested as
directed to finalise and forward a Joint Venture Agreement on
Chattak, Kamta and Feni between BAPEX and Niko Resources for the
approval of ministry.1!75

Petrobangla forwarded the instructions to BAPEX on 27 May 2001.!76

Between 20 May and 14 June 2001 the draft “policy” must have been
revised, judging by the fact that the text attached to the Ministry’s letter
of 20 May 2001 differs in a number of important respects from that

approved by the Minister on 14 June 2001 and attached to the JVA: the
title is changed from “Policy on Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas
Fields” to “Procedures for Development ...”

The Ministry followed up on 10 June 2001 by a letter to Petrobangla, with
copy to BAPEX, “Regarding finalisation of Joint Venture Agreement ...”.
Referring to the Marginal Fields Procedure, which had been approved “by
the special committee for supervision of the Bid evaluation formed by the
chairmanship of Principal Secretary of Honourable Prime Minister now
awaiting the final approval of the Honourable Prime Minister’, it gave
directions in the following terms:

2. In this situation in light of the draft procedure for development
of Chatak, Kamta and Feni marginal and abandoned gas fields for
urgent finalisation of the Joint Venture Agreement between Bapex
and Niko Resource:

1) write a letter to Niko Resource mentioning specific date for
coming to Bangladesh and

2) After finalisation of the negotiation of Joint Venture Agreement
between Bapex and Niko Resource, send the JVA to this
ministry for approval of the government by 20/06/2001.!77

Petrobangla passed on these directions to BAPEX on the following day,
stating:

... For urgent finalizing of the JVA between BAPEX and Niko Ltd in
the light of the procedure mentioned in the draft procedure, it has been
stated to (i) send invitation letter to Niko mentioning specific date and
(2) upon completion of negotiation between BAPEX and Niko, the JVA
to be sent to Ministry for approval of Government by 20.06.2001. You
are requested to take urgent steps in this regard.178

BAPEX then wrote to Niko, informing it of the Marginal Fields Procedure.
It informed Niko of Petrobangla’s letter of 11 June 2001 “to conclude the
JVA and forward the same to the Ministry for necessary approval.” The
letter continued as follows:

177 Memorandum from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to the Chairman of Petrobangla,
10 June 2001, Exhibit C-135; also Exhibit JD C-7, p. 510; a different translation is attached to the follow-
up letter sent by BAPEX to Niko on 11 June 2001, as per Exhibit C-136.

Pursuant to the mentioned draft policy of the Government, the
proposed draft JVA needs to be _ reshaped/rearranged
accommodating right clauses as and where needed. Accordingly, we
invite one of your authorised representatives to a Joint meeting
between BAPEX and Niko to be held on 12% June 2001 at 10.00 A.M.
at BAPEX office, Dhaka, Bangladesh.!79

On the same day, 11 June 2001, Niko accepted the invitation and
confirms “that Mr Sharif is fully authorised to continue to represent Niko in
all upcoming negotiations to finalise the JVA”.

The finalisation of the Marginal Fields Procedure proceeded in parallel.
It was finalised at the Ministry and submitted by it to the Prime Minister
with a Briefing Note by the Prime Minister’s Secretary, dated 6 June
2001.!8° From a subsequent document it appears that the procedure was
approved by the Prime Minister on 14 June 2001.'°! The Procedure
has been attached to the JVA as Annex C, in the form of a “Final Draft
Procedure”; there is no indication that this version would have been any
different from that approved by the Prime Minister on 14 June 2001.

The Marginal Fields Procedure defines marginal gas fields and regulates
the procedures for awarding contracts for the development of
marginal/abandoned fields:

GOB/ Petrobangla may invite proposals for private investment for the
development of marginal/ gas fields. The offers received will be
evaluated on declared criteria and the best offer will be selected for
negotiation and finalisation of the contract.

The Procedure goes on to provide further details about the contracting
process, in provisions that differ from the May 2001 draft: in clause 4.3
a general clause concerning the negotiations for investment contracts is
added, referring to the Model Production Sharing Contract 1997 as a
guideline for negotiations, “as far as practicable”.

The Procedure then deals with “offers received prior to the adoption of
these procedures”. The May draft contained two provisions:

179 Letter from BAPEX to Niko, 11 June 2001, Exhibit C-136.

180 Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields, Project Concept Approved by Prime
Minister, 6 June 2001, Exhibit C-203, RfA II, Attachment I.

181 Exhibit JD C-7, p. 513; referring to the Procedure as “approved by the Ex-Prime Minister on 14-06-2001”.
Adoption of the Procedure in June 2001 also is mentioned in a Niko letter of 8 July 2002, Exhibit C-140.

137

460.

461.

462.

4.3 Unsolicited offers received prior to the adoption of this policy will
be appraised by a technical committee appointed by Petrobangla.
Such offers will be subject to Swiss Challenge before the contract is
finalized.

4.4 Offers received prior the adoption of these procedures will be
appraised ... (JVA) will be concluded between the selected investor
and Petrobangla/Compan(ies) and forwarded to Government for
approval. 182

In the final version, as attached to the JVA, paragraph 4.3 and the
reference to Swiss Challenge is removed and paragraph 4.4 is completed
to read as follows:

Offers received prior to the adoption of these procedures will be
appraised by a technical committee appointed by Petrobangla. After
appraisal a Joint Venture Agreement will be concluded between the
selected investor and Petrobangla/Compan(ies) and forwarded to the
Government. 183

Both the May 2001 draft and the final version contain a section on
“Determination of Marginal Gas Fields” which are almost identical. The
final Procedure, however, has an added “Explanatory Note” at its very
end:

For the purposes of these procedures, Chattak, Kamta and Feni gas
fields shall be deemed to have been declared marginal/abandoned
gas fields, and the negotiations/discussions concluded so far with
the approval by the Government in 1999, shall be deemed to have
been in compliance with the above procedures. 84

There is no evidence that the meeting on 12 June 2001, to which BAPEX
had invited Niko, actually took place. There is a reference to a letter from
Niko to BAPEX requesting that in the Joint Study the term “Exploration”
used in the context of the well to be drilled in the Chattak East area be
replaced by “Appraisal”; the letter has not been produced but is
mentioned in the Minutes of a meeting at the Ministry on 29 July 2002. 185

The attempts at completing the JVA continued at a meeting “to finalise
the Joint Venture Agreement between BAPEX Negotiation
Committee and Niko ...” held on 25 June 2001. The Minutes of this
meeting record the conflicting positions of Niko and the BAPEX
Committee concerning the question whether or not Chattak East should
be included in the JVA. The Tribunals will consider below more closely
the Parties’ positions as recorded in these Minutes. Here the conclusion
of the meeting must be mentioned: the BAPEX Committee insisted that
Chattak East had to be excluded from the JVA while “Niko is not prepared
to change the area as defined in the STUDY AGREEMENT”. The Minutes’
final paragraph reads:

BAPEX and Niko jointly agree that other than the issues under
discussion herein all other issues, terms and conditions in the
Negotiated Draft JVA June 2000 have been agreed to between BAPEX
and Niko subject to final approval from BAPEX management. !86

The draft of the JVA of June 2000, as mentioned in the above quotation
from the Minutes of the 25 June 2001 meeting, was also referred to on
subsequent occasions but has not been produced. The Claimant
explained that it searched for it but was unable to find it. The only draft
of the JVA produced in the Arbitrations is that of September 2000.

The Tribunals note that there is no reference to Swiss Challenge or other
competitive procedure in the Minutes of the 25 June 2001 meeting and
in the correspondence relating to the finalisation of the JVA in the context
of the Marginal Fields Procedure. This correspondence only related to the
urgent finalisation of the JVA. The only issue that seemed to be
outstanding at the end of June 2001 was the question of Chattak East.

Following the BAPEX/Niko meeting on 25 June another meeting took
place on 27 June 2001 at the Ministry. At this meeting, the Energy
Secretary is said to have instructed Niko to “consider the Chattak East
portion of the Chattak field separately from the Chattak West portion of the
Chattak Gas field”. In the days immediately thereafter, these instructions
seem to have resulted in significant progress; BAPEX considered the
possibility of extending the JVA to Chattak East and Niko was prepared

to accept for Chattak East fiscal terms different from those of Chattak
West. This possible solution, which anticipates that which eventually was
adopted in the JVA, does not seem to have been pursued further at that
time. 187

In July 2001 the Awami League administration of Sheikh Hasina left
power. The BNP-Jamaal e Islami Coalition Government under Khaleda
Zia took office in October 2001. 188

The are no records in the Arbitrations about any negotiations for the JVA
during the year that followed until 8 July 2002. Following a meeting at
Petrobangla on 7 July 2002'8°9, Niko wrote to BAPEX, with copy to
Petrobangla, concerning the “Definition of Chattak Gas Field and
inclusion of Chattak East in the Bapex-Niko JVA”.!9° In that letter, Niko
sets out again its arguments in support of its claim that Chattak East
must be included in the JVA area.

In correspondence that followed, Niko insisted on the inclusion of
Chattak East, relying on the prior definition of the Chattak Field and
declaring that without Chattak East the project would not be viable. In a
meeting of representatives of the Ministry Petrobangla and BAPEX on 29
July 2002 it was decided that only Chattak West could be included in the
JVA; BAPEX informed Niko of this decision on 8 August 2002, clarifying
that “there is no scope to include Chattak East in the proposed BAPEX-
NIKO Joint Venture”.19!

Niko wrote to the State Minister on 10 August 2002, presenting again its
arguments, supported by a legal opinion by Md Azizul Haq, Advocate,
Supreme Court, of the firm Moudud Ahmed and Associates. Niko also
offered “to treat Chattak East as an exploration area, as contended by
Bapex’ with fiscal terms applied by the Government to “exploration
areas”.192 The explanations were further developed in Niko’s letter of 15

187 For details see below Section 9.5.3.

188 As explained e.g. in C-CMC, paragraphs 120 and 123; see also the Respondents’ table of “Corruption
Chronology”.

189 Niko’s letter of 10 August 2002, Exhibit R-353, indicates that date; in its earlier letter of 8 July 2002,
Exhibit C-140, reference is made to the “meeting in Petrobangla today’.

September 2002, which again offered “better fiscal terms based upon
investment multiples for Chattak East’ .195

In correspondence and meetings, other aspects of the JVA were
considered, including the well head gas price, for which USD 1.75/MCF
were considered. The issues were considered at a meeting at the
Ministry on 16 September 2002 attended by representatives of BAPEX
and presumably also of Petrobangla.!9* At the meeting the requirement
of using the Swiss Challenge procedure was also discussed and
Petrobangla was requested to provide clarification about the question
whether this procedure was applicable.

These issues were discussed with Niko at a meeting on 23 November
2002, followed by a letter from Niko dated 25 November 2002 in which
Niko, inter alia, expressed concern about the well head price of USD
1.75/MCF. With respect to Chattak East, Niko wrote: “[w]e request that
Chattak East be included in this project. However, NIKO will accept the
final GOB decision in this regard.”195

BAPEX then prepared a revised draft of the JVA “following the
Government decision and the abovementioned proposal by Niko” and
submitted it to the BAPEX Board on 30 December 2002. The Board
decided to form a committee, convened by a General Manager of BAPEX
and including two General Managers from Petrobangla, and gave
directions for the procedure to be followed.1%°

The Committee submitted its report on 13 January 2003 and BAPEX
commented on the report by making a correction in the draft JVA and
recommended the acceptance of the modified draft JVA. It concluded:

This is to note that, the committee did not find any Article that goes
against the interests of BAPEX/Petrobangla/the Government. In this
circumstance, the draft JVA can be rearranged as per the
recommendations of the committee. 197

During this period the Ministry pointed out to Petrobangla that at the
meeting of 16 September 2002 it had requested that the proposed JVA
be sent to it by 8 October 2002; it sent several reminders complaining
that the proposed JVA had not been sent as requested. In a letter of 30
October 2002, the Ministry referred to the matters that had been raised
and agreed at the 16 September 2002 meeting and those subsequently
clarified. It requested Petrobangla “to send the JVA pursuant to the
direction to finalise the JVA upon consideration of the specific issues
contained in the said minutes”.198 The request seems to have remained
without effect: on 5 January 2003, the Ministry wrote again to
Petrobangla, referring to several reminders and concluded: “Request is
hereby made again to urgently send the said JVA”.199

This time BAPEX responded: on 30 January 2003 it provided a detailed
account to Petrobangla.2°° That letter concluded by a request to the
Ministry “to take further steps for the consideration by and approval of the
Ministry regarding decisions” as per the BAPEX Board decision of 18
January 2003.

Sometime in February 2003, Mr Edward Sampson, Executive Chairman
of Niko Canada, seems to have been received by the State Minister.2°!
Following this visit, Mr Sampson wrote again to the State Minister on
26 February 2003.2°? He set out the history of the project up to the
preparation of the JVA on the basis of the BAPEX May 2000 Report. His
letter continued by pointing out that Niko had accepted in the draft JVA
many changes requested by BAPEX so that agreement had been reached
except for the Chattak issue. He requested the State Minister’s
“intervention to keep the Chattak Field intact’ and stated that “after
waiting for five year’, Niko could not pursue this project any longer if it
was not implemented without any further delay.

Following this letter a “joint meeting between the Energy Ministry,
Petrobangla, Bapex and Niko” was held on 2 March 2003. At this
occasion Niko was given an opportunity “to present [its] views and
concerns regarding this project [...] This was the first time in almost two
years we had the opportunity to present our case in a joint meeting” 2°
before “senior representatives of BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Ministry” .?°*

In its follow-up letter of 3 March 2003,° Niko again set out its case,
insisting that the Chattak Field, historically and geologically, had always
been treated as a single field until it was for the first time excluded at the
BAPEX Board meeting on 21 August 2000. It attached to the letter a legal
opinion on the letter head of Moudud Ahmed and Associates, dated 27
February 2003 and signed by Md. Azizul Haq, Advocate, Supreme
Court.206

Referring to a letter of the Ministry of 4 March 2003 (which has not been
produced), BAPEX, wrote to Petrobangla a letter of 5 March 2003,2°7
setting out the conflicting positions of the Parties and concluded by the
recommendation to submit the difference to the Ministry of Law.

The opinion of the Law Ministry which then was obtained has not been
produced. Its content was set out in a letter from the Energy Ministry to
Petrobangla of 1 April 2003 with copy to BAPEX. 298 The opinion which
is further discussed below in Sections 9.5.5 and 9.7, concluded that the
Chattak area had been defined in Annex A of the FOU and that definition
had to be respected. The letter of the Energy Ministry then continued by
instructing Petrobangla to take the necessary action for finalising the
signature of the JVA.

Following this communication by the Ministry, a “BAPEX-Niko JVA
Committee’ was set up to prepare separate fiscal terms for Chattak East,

more favourable to BAPEX. To this effect the committee also prepared a
comparative economic analysis of the gas fields to which the JVA was to
apply and the terms of the PSC for Block 12 in the area of which the
Chattak Field was included.?°9

The further events are reported in the Minutes of the Petrobangla
Management Committee meeting of 22 July 2003.?!° The Minutes
speak of a “joint committee” formed of “officials from Petrobangla and
BAPEX to executive [sic] a draft of the Joint Venture Agreement’, possibly
the BAPEX-Niko JVA Committee discussed above. The committee to
which the Minutes refer

... submitted its reports to the Petrobangla Chairman on 03 June,
2003. To reevaluate the report, Petrobangla formed a two members
committee on 09 June, 2003.

5. When the two members committee submitted the report to the
concerned authority, Petrobangla instructed the committee to make
needful amendment/ correction to the JVA in light of the report and to
take necessary actions to place it before the BAPEX board. Having
made needful correction/amendment to the JVA in light of the
instructions, the draft JVA was produced and approved at the 164
meeting of BAPEX Board held on 26 June, 2003. Draft JVA approved
by BAPEX board was sent to the Ministry by Petrobangla on 03 July
2003.

A “legal vetting on the JVA accepted by BAPEX board and adopted by
BAPEX and Niko Resources (BD) Ltd’ was performed by a “Petrobangla
panel of Lawyers”. 21! The Petrobangla Management Committee dealt
with the determination of the gas price, pointing out the difference with
price determination under the PSC and addressed certain tax and related
issues as well as the registration of Niko in Barbados. It noted that there
was “no possibility of adverse effects and recommended the JVA for
approval.” It also pointed out:

There will be no benefit unless the Abandoned/ Marginal Gas Fields
are developed for production.

No JVA was signed till date in Bangladesh Gas sector.

485. The Minutes also contain the following summary of some critical issues
concerning the JVA:

20. Referring to an investigation by the board, it was informed that no
fund is required by BAPEX to run the said Joint Venture. Niko will
bear all the investment needed. Earning from the produced gas will
be distributed through Investment Multiple basis. The board stated
that there will be no cost recovery in the said JVA as for the case of
PSC.

486. The discussion at the Petrobangla Management Committee, as reported
in the Minutes, concluded as follows:

25. The board referred the draft JVA to the Ministry for Government
approval.

26. The board recommended the approval of Joint initiative between
BAPEX and Niko for the development and exploration of Gas from
Chattak and Feni Non-Producing Marginal/Abandoned gas fields.
The board also advised the director (PSC) to send the matter to the
concerned Ministry for need full Government approval.

487. At this stage, the question of Swiss Challenge procedure seems to have
arisen again. In August 2003, the Law Ministry seems to have prepared
an opinion concerning the question whether this procedure had to be
followed.?!2 Considering the Government’s decision of 25 May 1999 and
the “government approved FOU’, the opinion observes that according to
the decision “following Swiss Challenge Method or any other tender
method was not mandatory, that was optional’. It also referred to the
confidentiality clause in the FOU and opined that “discussion or
agreement with a third-party following Swiss Challenge method” would
create liability of the Government.

488. The Government approved the JVA. The Ministry notified this approval
to Petrobangla on 11 October 2003;?!° the letter referred to the

212 Attachment to the Ministry’s letter of 11 October 2003, Exhibit R-280; the version of this letter produced
as Exhibit JD SI-33 does not have this attachment.

Ministry’s notification of 1 April 2003, Petrobangla’s letter of 3 July 2003
and a summary presented to the Prime Minister on 18 March 2003. It
requested “to arrange final signature” of the JVA. Details shall be
discussed below in Section 9.8.

Two days later, on 13 October 2003, Petrobangla wrote to BAPEX?!4 and
BAPEX wrote to Niko, inviting it to sign the JVA in the following terms:

In accordance with the approval accorded by the Government of the
Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to sign the “JOINT VENTURE
AGREEMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF
PETROLEUM FROM THE MARGINAL/ABANDONED CHATTAK & FENI
GAS FIELDS” between Bangladesh Petroleum Exploration &
Production Company Ltd (BAPEX) and Niko Resources (Bangladesh)
Ltd, you are requested to send your Authorized representative with
due authorization to sign the said contract on 16 October, 2003 at
12.00 Noon to the Registered office of BAPEX, Dhaka, Bangladesh.?!5

The JVA was then executed on 16 October 2003. BAPEX informed
Petrobangla on 18 October 2003, reminding it of the required transfer of
the Chattak and Feni Gas Fields from SGFL and BDFCL to BAPEX.?!6

On 4 November 2003, Niko Canada informed Petrobangla that Mr Qasim
Sharif had been appointed with immediate effect President of Niko
Bangladesh, representing that company “in all matters under Scope of the
Joint Venture between BAPEX and Niko for the development of the
marginal/ abandoned Chattak and Feni Gas Fields”.?17

Niko commenced work on the development of the gas fields upon
conclusion of the JVA, starting with the Feni field. The first well which it
sought to develop in the Feni field was Feni-3. Niko tested water instead
of gas in 17 of a total of 19 zones?!9 It then appeared that during the
second semester 2004 gas production could commence.

Niko wrote to Petrobangla on 19 May 2004, with copy to the Ministry,
having as reference “Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement (GPSA) for the
Feni Gas Field”. The letter explained that a skid-mounted gas plant was
to arrive on 1 June and that Feni-3 would be put on production in July
2004. The letter continued:

We, therefore, would like to initiate discussions with the Government
of Bangladesh and Petrobangla to finalise the subject agreement so
that Feni-3 can be on production as soon as the gas plant is
commissioned.

We understand that pursuant to Article 7 of the “Procedure for
Development of Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Fields” as approved by the
Honorable Prime Minister, the gas price of the Investor shall be
negotiated between the Government, Petrobangla, and the Investor.
Moreover, Article 24.3 of the Bapex-Niko JV stipulates that the Buyer
of the gas from the Feni Gas Field shall be Petrobangla or its designee.

In view of the above, we request a meeting with the authorised
representatives of the GOB, Petrobangla, and Bapex to initiate the
process to execute the subject agreement so that Feni-3 well could be
on production at the earliest.22°

On 6 June 2004, Petrobangla asked that Niko submit a proposed GPSA
for the Feni Gas Field.22! In a letter to Petrobangla of 14 June 2004, the
Ministry instructed the urgent conclusion of a GPSA for the purchase of
gas from the Feni field “in order to meet the rising demand of gas in the
country” .222

In response to Petrobangla’s letter of 6 June Niko (Mr Sharif, President)
wrote to Petrobangla’s Director (PSC), attention Mr Raihanul Abedin, on
14 June 2004, announcing that Feni-3 was completed, that work on
Feni-4 was advancing and that the gas plant was expected to be in place
and commissioned by early August 2004. Niko’s letter was accompanied
by a draft GPSA.223

Petrobangla (Mr Abedin, Director PSC) responded on 3 July 2004,
announcing for 4 July 2004 a “Negotiation Meeting on draft? GPSA, and
requested Niko’s presence.

Shortly thereafter, further to a letter from the Ministry dated 15 July
2004,?24 a committee was formed “to negotiate for finalisation of gas
pricing of Ex. Feni gas field which is being developed by BAPEX-NIKO JVA”
(the “Gas Pricing Committee”). The committee was composed of

e Mr Ehsan-ul Fattah, Addl. Secretary, Petroleum & Mineral
Resources Division at the Ministry, in the function of Convener

e MrS.R. Osmani, Chairman of Petrobangla

e Mr Muktadir Ali, Director (Planning), Petrobangla

e Mr Qasim Sharif, President Niko

e Mr Peter Mercier, Vice President Niko, Bangladesh Operation

e Mr M.A. Based, Managing Director BAPEX.225

Mr Md. Raihanul Abedin, Director (PSC), was not included among the
members of the Committee, but he was listed as an observer at the first
of the two meetings of the Committee which took place under the
chairmanship of the Convener on 24 July and 4 August 2004.226 In
addition, the first meeting also was attended also by an observer from the
Ministry (Mrs Mahbubun Nahar, Senior Assistant Secretary) and from
BAPEX (Mr Syed Ahmed Haqqani, General Manager) and Petrobangla.227

The Minutes of these first two meetings record that, based on a
commercial and risk analysis, Niko requested a price of US$2.75/MCF.
The “GOB participants” stated that “in 2003 [Niko] offered the gas price
US$1.75 as the best offer’. At the end of the discussion “the Chair
offered Niko to agree Feni Gas Price at US$1.75/MCF, since Niko signed
the JVA considering this price”. Niko stated that it would respond later.??8

Niko answered the proposal on 7 August 2004 by a letter to the Convener.
It stated that pre-JVA discussion were superseded by the agreement itself
and in Annex D of the JVA “the 1.75/MCF price is used as an example of
calculating the investment multiple”. Niko insisted that the gas price that
it demanded was reasonable and justified and suggested consultations
on the economics of the Feni development.

In particular Niko pointed out that, in the relevant region, Petrobangla
was paying “approximately USD 2.9/MCF’:

Chittagong area is the natural market for the Feni Gas. In this area
Petrobangla is purchasing gas steadily from the Sangu Gas Field
operated by an IOC at approximately USD 2.9/MCF for the past seven
to eight years. Since the Feni Gas will supplement and compete with
the Sangu gas, we find your offer of USD 1.75 grossly unfair. Niko is
therefore unable to accept this unfair price.

A third meeting was held on 19 August 2004 at which the parties
developed their arguments for their respective price requests. The
positions did not change, as summarised by Niko in its letter of 19 August
2004.229

Gas delivery started on 2 November 2004, without any agreement
having been reached concerning the price and without a GPSA having
been executed by the concerned parties. On the day before, Petrobangla
(Mr Abedin) had written, however, to Niko (Mr Sharif), thanking Niko “for
the successful development of the Feni gas field” and undertaking “to buy
gas from BAPEX-Niko Joint Venture’s Feni marginal gas field”. The letter
added that “price of gas will be paid as per agreed and signed GPSA when
finalised”.

At the end of 2004, Niko started drilling in the Chattak Field the Chattak-
2 well. On 7 January 2005 a blowout occurred in this well (the first
blowout). Niko sought to extinguish the blowout by engaging a specialist
who drilled a relief well. The attempt failed and a second blowout ccurred
on 24 June 2005 (the second blowout). The blow outs were eventually
extinguished on 9 October 2005, when according to the Claimant the flow
of gas was halted.28° The circumstances of these blowouts and
corresponding liability will be examined in the Tribunals’ decision on
liability.

Concerning the sale of the gas from the Feni field, Niko wrote to to the
Chairman of Petrobangla on 14 February 2005, stating that the “trial
production period has ended. Our gas plants have been commissioned. We
now find ourselves in an extremely difficult position with our management
and board to justify and continue gas production from Feni without
finalisation of the price of our share of the gas”. Niko required an
immediate interim payment for the gas delivered from November 2004 to
January 2005 at the rate of US$2.35/MCF and finalisation of the gas
price within the next ten calendar days, failing which Niko said that it
reserved the right to suspend gas production from the Feni field.25!

Petrobangla responded the same day, announcing that it “would make a
lump sum interim payment against the gas supplied from November 2004
to January 2005” without prejudice to the rate to be agreed. It added a
request that Niko “supply maximum possible quantity of gas
immediately” .?52

Niko then addressed itself to the Ministry on 9 March 2004. The letter to
the Ministry has not been produced but is mentioned in a letter from
Petrobangla of 10 March 2005. In that letter Petrobangla announced that
it had “arranged a payment of US$2 million today for the time being to
you on a lump sum basis ...”?33 Niko confirmed its receipt as “lump sum
partial payment for Niko’s share of gas production for November, December
and January”.?5+

assert that gas continued flowing (B-MD, paragraph 143 et seq).

In the letter of 10 March 2005, Petrobangla also relied on Article 16.1(c)
of the JVA which identified as an event of default if “[a]ny of the party
indulges/commits any act which is contrary to the interests of
Bangladesh” and required Niko to withdraw the notice of suspension of
gas production “or else we would be constrained to take all necessary
steps under the JVA to up hold the interests of the country” .?85

A further meeting by the Gas Pricing Committee was held on 16 March
2005. No minutes of this meeting have been produced; but Niko
summarised the parties’ positions in a letter to the Ministry (to the
attention of the State Minister, A.K.M. Mosharraf Hossain) of 19 March
2005:

Up to the date of the meeting, our understanding of the seller’s and
the buyer’s positions was that Petrobangla is offering US$2.10 per
mscf for gas production at Feni and Niko was requesting a price of
US$ 2.35 per mscf for the gas.?36

According to Niko’s summary of the meeting, Niko repeated its arguments
in support of the requested price, referring to the costs for services and
materials in the oil exploration and production industry which “increased
dramatically since the signing of the [JVA] over the past year’ and to the
increase in energy prices world wide. It also stated that

The price Niko is proposing for supply of Feni gas production to the
Bangladesh market is understood to be the lowest gas price of any
PSC in Bangladesh.?37

At the meeting, “as a gesture of good will and in an attempt to move the
discussion to a conclusion, Niko proposed a final agreed price of US$2.30
per msfe...”.

Petrobangla was not in agreement with our proposed price and once
again re-stated that the maximum price that Petrobangla could pay for
the gas was US$2.10.

As no agreement was reached, Niko reverted to its previously requested
price of US$2.35 per mscf.

Given the failure to reach agreement, Niko requested at the meeting that
the Committee re-convene; but no dates could be found in the immediate
future. At the meeting the Chairman of Petrobangla “suggested that if the
Committee did not agree on a price that Niko/Bapex may have to directly
approach the Government of Bangladesh for a final decision”. Niko
therefore wrote to the Ministry on 19 March 2005, with copy to the
members of the Committee, in the following terms:

It was expressed by the Chairman of Petrobangla that the final result
of the Committee’s deliberations may be that we will not reach a
consensus on the price. He further opined that it is possible that the
Committee will have to conclude its deliberations with a report to the
Ministry that a price for the gas could not be agreed. Niko
acknowledged that this could be a possible outcome of the Committee
meetings, however it was requested by Niko that this conclusion be
arrived at as soon as possible so that other avenues for concluding
the price agreement could be pursued. Mr Osman [the Chairman of
Petrobangla] suggested that if the Committee did not agree on a price
that Niko/Bapex may have to directly approach the Government of
Bangladesh for a final decision.

[Niko confirmed its request for a meeting of the Committee within 4
days, failing which it would reduce gas production at Feni.]

We are therefore writing to you to request your assistance in ensuring
that the negotiations continue without delay so that a final agreement
can be reached and gas production continue for the benefit of all.?98

The reactions of the State Minister and of the Committee have not been
documented. From other evidence related to the gifts to the State
Minister the Tribunals have been informed that the State Minister
requested a Land Cruiser, purchased by Niko for the JVA, be delivered to
him; that vehicle was indeed delivered on 23 May 2005. The Minister
travelled to Canada and the United States in June 2005 at the expense
of Niko. The Minister’s receipt of this gift was publicised in the press in
Bangladesh and the Minister resigned on 18 June 2005.

The Committee met again on 5 June 2005 and then prepared its report
(the “June 2005 Report”); the report is undated but, according to Niko’s

238 Exhibit JD C-6, p. 480.

letter of 4 August 2005, was “executed” on 13 June 2005.289 Niko added
its “Comments and Explanations to the Feni Gas Pricing Committee
Report”, dated 13 June 2005.240

The Report presents again the positions of the parties and then
concludes:

Committee’s opinion:

Members representing GOB opine that the Feni gas price might be of
US$ 2.10/MCF pursuant to achieving comparability with PSC.

Members representing Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. did not come
to an agreement with such price. They opined that their price for Feni
gas is US$ 2.35/MCF.

Committee’s recommendation:

The Committee could not reach to a consensus in respect of pricing of
gas to be produced from Feni field. The matter, therefore, remains
unresolved.

The members representing Government side recommend that the
Niko’s share of gas from Feni field under the terms of JVA may be
purchased by Petrobangla at best at a price of US$2.10/MCF.?41

Niko followed up by a letter of 4 August 2005 to the Additional Secretary
in the Ministry, referring to the June report and requesting another
meeting “with a view to reach a consensus on the subject matter’ .24?

The composition of the Gas Pricing Committee was altered on 23 August
2005, Mr Ali being replaced by Mr Rahman (Director, Planning,
Petrobangla) and Mr Based being replaced by Mr Jamaluddin (Managing
Director, BAPEX); Mr Fatha continued to function as Convener and Mr
Osmani as Member.?*3 The Committee held its last meeting on 23
October 2005. The report of the Committee, signed on 25 October 2005

(the “October 2005 Report”),244 shows a change in the Committee’s
composition: the person appearing as the Director (Planning) of
Petrobangla now is Mr Shahido Rahman and Mr M. Jamaluddin appears
as the Managing Director of BAPEX. The Report repeats large parts of the
June 2005 report but differs in one important aspect: when presenting
the opinion of the “members representing GOB’, the report removed the
passage stating that “the Feni gas price might be of US$ 2.10/MCF
pursuant to achieving comparability with PSC’. That passage was replaced
by the words:

... the Feni gas price might be of US$ 1.75/MCF in consideration of
the issues stated above and at such price, Niko will achieve a positive
cashflow from the Feni field as per projection attached hereto
(Attachment 4).

The Minutes make no reference to the prior offer of a price of
US$2.10/MCF, as it had been recorded in the June 2005 Report. They
record the reasons given by the “members representing the GOB” in
support of the price at US$1.75/MCF, which corresponded largely to
those in the June 2005 Report; but the objective of “achieving
comparability with PSC” was removed and there is no explanation for the
return from US$ 2.10 to the original offer 1.75/MCF. Niko’s position
remained, as per the June 2005 Report, at US$2.35/MCF.

Consequently, the report presented the following conclusion:
Committee’s recommendation:

The Committee could not reach a consensus in respect of pricing of
gas to produce from Feni field. The matter, therefore, remained
unresolved.

The members representing Government side recommend that the
Niko’s share of gas from Feni field under the terms of JVA may be
purchased by Petrobangla at best at a price of US$1.75/MCF.245

Niko met the Convener on 25 October and wrote to him on 26 October
2005, providing comments which it requested to “be included as part of
the Minutes” of the 23 October 2005 meeting. It objected to the
“retrenchmet to the lower price of US$ 1.75” and attributed this change to

248 The copy of the report filed as Exhibit JD C-6, pp. 434-437, is not dated; but it is signed by the Chairman
of Petrobangla, its Director (Planning) and the Managing Director of BAPEX, all dated 25 October 2005.

one of the new Members of the Committee who “perhaps had not been
fully briefed on the past history of the negotiations”. Niko added: “if the
Committee could not reach a consensus on the matter of gas pricing that
the next stage should be to pursue an arbitrated settlement of the matter’.
Niko announced that it “will therefore suggest to the GOB this solution to
move forward on the matter” .2+6

In a letter to the Ministry (addressed to the Energy Advisor, Mahmudur
Rahman), also dated 25 October 2005, Niko referred to Article 18.3 of the
JVA and proposed that the gas price determination “be referred to a sole
expert to arbitrate ...”2*’ It explained that a “sole expert arbitrator would
be appropriate in this matter as the basis of the dispute is to establish gas
pricing and not legal issues or disputes” .?48

However, this proposal was not accepted. Petrobangla refused to submit
the difference about the gas price to arbitration or an expert, as per
Article 18.3 JVA and persisted in this position. On 5 March 2006, for
instance, Petrobangla wrote:

Failure to reach any unanimous price decision, cannot be
arbitrated/determined by any sole expert under the GPSA of any
kind, since GOB is not going to be a party to that. The truth of the
matter is price negotiation under the JVA is not to be done at the time
of GPSA negotiation neither it could be agreed that the GPSA
negotiation has been started at the time of Price Committee was made
because that had been started independently.?*9

As to the gas price itself, the position of Petrobangla, BAPEX and the
Government remained unchanged, despite numerous attempts by Niko
to reach a more favourable solution, permanently or as an interim
solution: Niko eventually accepted the price of US$1.75/MCF, as
Petrobangla had requested from the beginning of the negotiations.

For the remainder of these negotiations the Tribunals refer to the account
given in their Decision on Jurisdiction and simply mention the following
points of some relevance for the present state of the proceedings:

Petrobangla made two payments on account of US$2 million each,?5°
but no other payment for the gas delivered. For any further payments on
account, Petrobangla informed Niko: “you have to wait till such time the
gas price is finalised” .?5! Petrobangla also relied on the order of the High
Court Division of the Supreme Court in the BELA proceedings,
restraining inter alia Petrobangla from any payment to Niko.252 Niko
requested the Ministry?55 and Petrobangla?5+ for “full support” in the
efforts for having the orders stayed. This was to no avail.

As no agreement had been reached by 24 November 2005 on the gas price
and the GSPA, Niko advised Petrobangla in writing, as it had done ona
previous occasion, that as of 28 November 2005 it would suspend gas
production from the Feni Field pending “mutual resolution” of the gas
price, the agreement and execution of a GPSA and “settlement of arrears
for gas sold to date from the Feni Field.”?55 Petrobangla responded the
same day, requesting Niko to withdraw the notice and not to suspend
deliveries. Petrobangla’s letter concluded: “If you are still determined to
do so that will be seriously prejudicial to our national interest and we shall
be constrained to act accordingly.”?5© In the following correspondence,
Petrobangla and BAPEX continued to object to any reduction or
suspension of gas production and instead requested that Niko increase
production.257

No suspension of gas production seems to have taken place by 16
January 2006, when Niko announced that “due to problems with one of
the glycol dehydrators”, production had to be reduced.?5® On 26 February
2006, Niko again announced to Petrobangla, with copy to the Prime
Minister, the Ministry and others, that as from 27 February 2006 it

250 The first payment, made in February 2005, has been mentioned above; a second payment was made
before November 2005, as stated by Petrobangla in it letter of 24 November 2005 (Exhibit JD C-6, p.425)
and confirmed by Niko on 26 November 2005 (Exhibit JD C-6, p. 424).

planned to shut down all gas production from the Feni field “until further
notice” .259

This time, the production does indeed seem to have been reduced or shut
down. Indeed, on 28 February 2006, Petrobangla requested Niko “to
immediately restore gas production to an increased quantity from the field
and deliver the same pending negotiations of GPSA”.2©° In a letter to
Petrobangla of 2 March 2006, Niko clarified that the “suspension of gas
production is most definitely related to the finalisation of a GSPA”.?6!

This gave rise to further discussions with the Government’s Energy
Advisor, Petrobangla and BAPEX. Apparently encouraged at a meeting
with Petrobangla on 7 March 2006, Niko repeated on 8 March 2006 its
proposal of referring the gas price difference to an “Internationally
Reputed Arbitrator/Sole Expert’ and requested that a meeting of the Gas
Pricing Committee be convened urgently.2©? In the expectation of this
meeting, Niko decided to resume gas production. In the letter of 8 March
2006, it wrote:

we value the relationship we have with the Government of
Bangladesh and considering the national interest Niko Management
after having detail discussion with the Hon’ble Advisor for the Energy
& Mineral Resources Division decided to turn on the Gas Production
from Feni Gas Field as a gesture of our goodwill. We are here to do
business and we would like to move on with things and we feel that
convening this meeting would be the first step toward the right
direction to reach any early solution to this critical issue of gas price.

There is no indication that a new meeting of the Gas Pricing Committee
was held and that the renewed suggestion of the price determination by
a Sole Expert was followed-up.

While the difference about the gas price remained unresolved, Niko and
Petrobangla continued to negotiate the terms of a GPSA. These
negotiations were conducted separately from the meetings of the Gas
Pricing Committee and sometimes referred to as meetings of the GPSA
Negotiation Committee.26

Petrobangla had formally announced on 29 November 2005 that the
“purchase price of gas of the Feni Gas Field is fixed at US$1.75/MCF’.
Although, at the request of Petrobangla on 6 June 2004, Niko had sent a
first draft of the GPSA already on 14 June 2004,?6 Petrobangla invited
Niko in the letter of 29 November 2005 “to negotiate the terms of the
GPSA” ..265

Following this renewed invitation by Petrobangla, Niko requested that an
interim GPSA be concluded forthwith, submitted the draft of such an
interim GPSA and eventually accepted under such an interim agreement
payment at US$1.75/MCF.26 After some correspondence concerning its
terms, Niko sent on 22 January 2006, already initialled, what it
considered to be a “final version” reflecting requests for changes.” After
it had suspended gas production, it announced on 6 March 2006 that
“gas production at Feni Field cannot be resumed until an IGPSA has been
signed”.2©8 However, no such interim agreement was concluded.

Several versions of the draft GPSA as the final agreement were
considered. Mr Adolf mentioned a first draft that Niko had submitted in
2004, with which he was not familiar.269 A new draft seems to have been
used in 2005; a version of this draft was sent on 14 March 2006,279 which
again gave rise to discussions with BAPEX.271

According to testimony from Mr Adolf during the jurisdiction phase, Niko
then invited Petrobangla as follows: “why do you not provide us what is
your standard GPSA and we will work forward from there” .?7? Petrobangla
did indeed present a draft GPSA on 29 March 2006, which Niko returned
with suggested modifications on 2 April 2006.279

After further negotiations, a final text was agreed in a meeting on 6
April 2006, a text for initialling was sent by Petrobanla to Niko and
BAPEX on 19 April and Niko accepted US$1.75/MCF as the gas price,
proposing arbitration for the determination of the “Chattak blowout
compensation’ .274

The draft then was initialled on 31 July 2006, as confirmed in a
document signed by Mr Jahangir Kabir, Senior General Manager of
Petrobangla, Mr Jamludding, Managing Director of BAPEX and Mr Biran
Adolph, Vice President, Country Manager, Niko.

The Government approved the GPSA. On 20 December 2006 the Senior
Assistant Secretary at the Ministry (Mr Nurun Akter) wrote to the
Chairman of Petrobangla:

You are informed on the above subject and reference that the draft
Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) for the produced gas from the
Feni Gas Field as per agreement of Bapex with NAICO [sic] sent
through abovementioned memo under reference has been approved
by the government.

2. Under the circumstances the undersigned is directed to request you
to take necessary action in the due pursuance of the existing rules
and regulations on the above mentioned subject.?75

On the following day, 21 December 2006, Petrobangla (Md. Maqbul-E-
Elahi, Director (PSC)) wrote to Niko and BAPEX, informing them that the
Government of Bangladesh had “approved the _ initialled
(31.07.2006) Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement of Marginal Gas
Field Feni’.276

The GPSA was executed on 27 December 2006. It fixed a price of
US$1.75 per thousand cubic feet of gas for the period of the agreement.

In conclusion on the history of the GPSA negotiations, the Tribunals
note that it required over 2 % years from the time when Niko first
requested negotiations for an agreement on the gas price until execution
of the GPSA. Agreement was reached only when Niko had accepted the
gas price which the members of the Gas Pricing Committee “representing

the GOB” had requested from the outset, based on calculations made
during the JVA negotiations. These representatives insisted on this price,
even though in 2005 they considered that “achieving comparability with
PSC’ justified a price of US$2.10, a position that was later abandoned by
them.

This long period of negotiations may be attributed inter alia to differences
in the positions concerning the price to be paid for the gas. Insisting on
a price reflecting prices from other suppliers and cost developments, “the
members representing the Government side” in the Gas Pricing Committee
referred to a price mentioned in the context of the JVA, a position which
ultimately prevailed. Other difficulties were highlighted by Niko when,
following a meeting with the Advisor at the Ministry on 12 February 2006,
Niko recorded “confirmation of the delay in getting final approval from the
Prime Minister’s Office to allow us with our work” and “considerable
confusion amongst the Petrobangla representatives as to how to proceed
with the finalisation of the Agreement due to the fact that conflicting
instructions were received from your Division” .277

In view of the Respondents’ allegations in the Corruption Claim, the
Tribunals have sought to identify the principal protagonists in the
GPSA negotiations. The members of the Gas Pricing Committee have
been identified above.

As to the GPSA negotiations, it appears that, on the side of Petrobangla,
they were conducted by “Engr. Md Rahanul Abedin’, Director (PSC); he
signed the letters addressed to Niko and Niko addressed to his attention
its letters to Petrobangla. The Respondents explained that Mr Abedin
occupied the position of Director (PSC) from January 2003 to June
2006.278

On the side of Niko, the initial correspondence is signed by Mr Qasim
Sharif, President, who also is identified as Niko representative at the
initial meetings of the Gas Pricing Committee.279 Mr Brian Adolf
commenced his activity as Country Manager for Niko in January 2005.280

THE RESPONDENTS’ NEW OBJECTIONS TO THE TRIBUNALS’
JURISDICTION

When the Claimant brought the two Arbitrations, the Respondents
(which originally included the Government of Bangladesh) raised several
objections to the Tribunals’ jurisdiction, one of which was based on acts
of corruption committed by the Claimant. In their Decision on
Jurisdiction of 19 August 2013, the Tribunals dismissed the objections
which the Government, Petrobangla and BAPEX had raised against the
Tribunals’ jurisdiction and held that they had jurisdiction to decide the
claims brought by the Claimant against these two Respondents.

In the context of their Corruption Claim, the Respondents first confirmed
the Tribunals’ jurisdiction. In the Memorial on Damages, BAPEX wrote:

Only the arbitration clause survives. This Tribunal should exercise
jurisdiction to resolve the allegations of corruption and injury to
BAPEX resulting from Niko’s procurement of the JVA and its
operations that resulted from that corrupt procurement.?8!

This position was changed when the Respondents in their Reply on
Corruption “request[ed] the Tribunals find that they do not have
jurisdiction’ .282

For the Claimant the new objections are inadmissible and late; and they
are baseless. The Claimant quotes from the Methanex award:

There is little point in any arbitration tribunal making jurisdictional
decisions intended and understood to be final and binding on the
parties if, much later, a disappointed party can re-argue its
jurisdictional case and turn the arbitration into the equivalent of
Sisyphus’s torment or the film “Groundhog Day”.28

When examining the objection to jurisdiction now made by the
Respondents, the Tribunals noted that it is not presented as the
continuation of Sisyphus’ torment but as new and different objection.

5.1 The nature of the Respondents’ new objections

554.

555.

556.

557.

558.

In their original objection to jurisdiction based on acts of corruption, as
it was presented on 29 August 2011 and considered in the Decision on
Jurisdiction, the Respondents made it clear that they did

... not intend to argue that the [Agreements were] void or voidable by
reason of corruption or otherwise.28*+

In the Tribunals’ understanding, the Respondents’ denial of jurisdiction
then was made despite binding Agreements and binding arbitration
clauses. Rather the Respondents argued that, due to its alleged bad faith
when making the investment, the Claimant could not resort to the
international arbitration system and specifically not to ICSID arbitration.
According to this line of argument, “Petrobangla and BAPEX could invoke
the arbitration clauses but Niko could not’ .?85

When they made the above declaration concerning their intended
argument about the fate of the Agreements, the Respondents qualified it
by stating:

[The Respondents] would, of course, revisit this position if further
disclosure made it appropriate to do so.28®

This position was not changed by the Respondents until they brought the
Corruption Claim in BAPEX’s Memorial on Corruption of 25 March 2016.
The Respondents’ case, as presented now, is different from the previous
case insofar as the Respondents now also challenge the validity of the
Agreements. They do so on the basis of a much broader corruption
allegation and relying on large amounts of additional evidence.

In view of these circumstances, the Respondents argue that their new
challenge of the Tribunals’ jurisdiction is not one for reconsideration;
instead the “new evidence presented to the Tribunals raises new
jurisdictional barriers that the Tribunals must consider’. They argue:

284 Respondents’ letter to the Tribunals of 29 August 2011, quoted in the Decision on Jurisdiction,
paragraph 377.

285 Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 465.

28 Respondents’ letter to the Tribunals of 29 August 2011, quoted in the Decision on Jurisdiction,
paragraph 377.

562.

563.

Respondents do not seek reconsideration of the Tribunals’ Decision
on Jurisdiction. The new evidence presented to the Tribunals raises
new jurisdictional barriers that the Tribunals must consider. Under
these circumstances, the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rules
mandate that the Tribunals consider Respondents’ jurisdictional
objections on the basis of previously unavailable evidence. 787

During the course of the proceedings on the Corruption Claim, the
Respondents position concerning jurisdiction evolved.

In a first phase, the Respondents expressly accepted the Tribunals’
jurisdiction. In its Memorial on Damages of 25 March 2016, BAPEX
stated:

Only the arbitration clause survives. This Tribunal should exercise
jurisdiction to resolve the allegations of corruption and injury to
BAPEX resulting from Niko’s procurement of the JVA and its
operations that resulted from that corrupt procurement.?88

As part of the relief it sought from the Tribunals, BAPEX requested a
declaration that the JVA was voidable and voided by BAPEX; it also
sought compensation for its losses suffered from the corrupt
procurement of the JVA, including those resulting from the blowouts.

In a separate letter also dated 25 March 2016, Petrobangla declared that
it “approves and adopts BAPEX’s recitation of the facts and legal
consequences of Niko’s use of corruption and bribes to obtain the JVA and
the GPSA”. It stated that “Niko’s claims based on the GPSA must be
rejected” and requested that the Tribunals “vacate” their prior decision
on the Payment Claim.

In their Memorial on Corruption of 23 November 2016, the Respondents
invoked Article 102 of the Constitution and argued that the Agreements
were “void ab initio and without legal effect’.?®° It their request for relief,
the Respondents sought a number of declarations, including the
declaration that the Government’s approval of the Agreements “was

without legal effect and void ab initio”. They did not request formally a
decision on jurisdiction but seemed to leave the matter to the Tribunals:

Given the overwhelming evidence of corruption in Niko’s procurement
of the JVA and GPSA presented with this Memorial that was not
before the Tribunal at the time of the Decision on Jurisdiction, the
Tribunals may wish to exercise their authority under Article 41(2) of
the Rules to make a determination regarding their jurisdiction over
Niko’s claims in light of the evidence now before them.?9°

The Respondents’ formal request that “the Tribunals find that they do not
have jurisdiction” eventually was made in their Reply on Jurisdiction of
22 February 2017. The various declarations which the Respondents had
requested in the Memorial on Corruption were “affirmed” only “if the
Tribunals exercise jurisdiction’.

In their Post-Hearing Briefs the Respondents confirmed the earlier
requests for relief. They clarified the position by stating:

... the facts regarding corruption’s influence on the procurement of the
Agreements are of such weight that efficiency demands that the
Tribunals deny Niko’s claims as a matter of jurisdiction to give effect
to the international public policy against corruption.?9!

The jurisdictional objections which the Respondents present as the “new
jurisdictional barriers” take two forms: on the one hand, the Respondents
assert that the “Claimant cannot use the ICSID arbitration system to
protect an investment created in violation of the international law principle
of good faith, international public policy, or Bangladeshi law”.292 On the
other hand, the Respondents argue that the arbitration agreement is void
ab initio as part of an agreements which also never came into existence.293

The Tribunals have examined these lines of argument and the newly
produced evidence, assuming for the purpose of this examination that
they could not have been presented during the proceedings on
jurisdiction and that they therefore are admissible.

5.2 The availability of ICSID arbitration for the Claimant’s claims

568.

569.

In the proceedings on jurisdiction, the Respondents requested that the
Tribunals deny jurisdiction because ICSID arbitration was not available
for claimants having engaged in corruption and thus had violated
principles of good faith and international public policy. In their
submissions they submitted that “it would violate the principles of
international public policy to afford the Claimant access to ICSID”;?94 and

... jurisdiction must be denied because the Claimant has violated the
principles of good faith and international public policy.

This Tribunal is empowered to protect the integrity of the ICSID
dispute settlement mechanism by dismissing a claim which
represents a violation of fundamental principles of law.

and

... jurisdiction should be denied because the Claimant has violated
the principles of good faith and international public policy, in a
manner intimately linked to the alleged investment. The Tribunal is
empowered to protect the integrity of the ICSID dispute settlement
mechanism by dismissing a claim which represents a violation of
fundamental principles of law. The Claimant does not bring this claim
with clean hands. That is not affected by the question whether or not
its bribery achieved its admitted purpose.?9°

The Tribunals examined this line of argument at great length in the
Decision on Jurisdiction. They noted that jurisdiction in the present
cases is based not on the offer to arbitrate in a treaty but on two
Agreements; and that the validity of the Agreements and of the arbitration
clauses in them was not contested. The Tribunals stated:

. in the present case jurisdiction is not based on such a treaty but
on two agreements. The arbitration clause in these agreements is not
merely an offer subject to conditions which may or may not be
accepted. Rather it contains a firm agreement binding both parties to
submit their disputes to ICSID arbitration.

Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 473.

the Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 374 and 376.

570.

571.

572.

The question whether the investment was made in good faith or not
and, if not, what consequences would have to be drawn from it, are
matters which must be resolved in the agreed manner. In a
contractual dispute as the present one, alleged or established lack of
good faith in the investment does not justify the denial of jurisdiction
but must be considered as part of the merits of the dispute.?9©

The Respondents’ case during the proceedings on jurisdiction, relied on
the Claimant’s corrupt conduct that manifested itself in the the two
instances of corruption, sanctioned by the Canadian authorities. The
Respondents’ case now relies also on the Claimant’s corrupt conduct for
which the Respondents have vastly expanded the evidence by which they
seek to prove the Claimant’s corruption. The difference in the
Respondents’ case is one of quantity and, in the Respondents’ view,
persuasiveness of the corruption allegation and the supposed extent of
the corrupt activity.

The argument itself, however, has remained the same as that which the
Tribunals have considered in their Decision on Jurisdiction. Then as
now, the Respondents argue: “international law denies access to the ICSID
arbitration system to investors who made their alleged investment in bad
faith, or in violation of international public policy or local law” .?97 In effect
the Respondents seek a reconsideration of the Tribunals’ findings in the
Decision on Jurisdiction. Without making a determination that
reconsideration of the Decision on Jurisdiction is admissible, the
Tribunals have examined the developments of the Respondents’
argument and the support for it now presented. The Tribunals concluded
that these additional developments do not justify alteration of their
conclusion that, in cases based on contractual arbitration clauses,
allegations of bad faith and violations of international or domestic law
must be considered on the merits of the case.

When the Tribunals reached this conclusion in their Decision on
Jurisdiction, the legality of the two Agreements and the validity of the
arbitration clauses contained in them were not in issue. It was therefore
a predicate of the Decision that (i) the arbitration clause itself was not
procured by corruption and (ii) the agreement was not illegal. The
Tribunals now have examined whether these assumptions still apply.

575.

Concerning the first of these assumptions - the arbitration clause was
not procured by corruption - the Tribunals found in their Decision on
Jurisdiction that the arbitration clauses in the Agreements were
proposed by Petrobangla.?98 This has not been denied since then. Indeed,
the Claimant has presented further argument and evidence to support
the conclusion that the arbitration clauses were proposed by the
Respondents and were not affected by the alleged corruption:

From the beginning of the discussions concerning the JVA, the Parties
were in agreement that any dispute was to be referred to ICSID
arbitration.

[oJ

The record thus establishes that the Parties at all relevant points were
agreed that any disputes under the JVA and the GPSA should be
submitted to ICSID arbitration. Indeed, the record shows that it was
the Respondent that proposed to consent to ICSID arbitration, based
on their own models of the relevant agreements. The record further
contains not the slightest suggestion that the consent to ICSID
arbitration was affected by corruption.299

At the end of the proceedings on the Corruption Claim, the Claimant
noted among the matters “never disputed”:

The arbitration clauses in question were proposed by the
Respondents and accepted by Niko without debate. The Respondents
do not suggest that the arbitration agreements were in any respect
procured by corruption.3°°

The Tribunals confirm: the Respondents did not argue in the proceedings
on Jurisdiction that the arbitration clauses were procured by corruption.
They now argue that the additional evidence on which they rely proves
the “link of causation between the established acts of corruption and the
conclusion of the agreements”;3°! this is an issue which the Tribunals will
have to examine when they consider the merits of the Corruption Claim.
The Respondents do not, however, seek to demonstrate that the
arbitration clauses in these agreements were procured by corruption.

578.

In any event, the evidence before the Tribunals, then and now, does not
contain any indication of corruption in the proposal and acceptance of
the arbitration clauses. The Tribunals conclude that the corruption
allegations, even in the expanded form in which they are now raised
by the Respondents, do not affect the arbitration clauses; the issue
of the severability of these clauses from the Agreements in which they are
contained will be considered separately below.

Concerning the second assumption - the object and content of the
Agreements is not illegal - the Tribunals had considered separately
cases where the contract has corruption as it object, rather than having
been procured by corruption. The Tribunals referred to the controversy
about the question whether, in the case of such contracts, arbitrators
should deny jurisdiction, as was done most prominently in 1963 by
Judge Lagergren when he faced an admitted case of corruption in
Argentina, or whether the arbitrators should deny claims under contracts
for corruption on the merits of the dispute. The Decision on Jurisdiction
leaves the question open, because the Tribunals concluded:

In the present case, the agreements on which the claims are based
have as their object the development of marginal/abandoned gas
fields and the sale of gas from such fields. It has not been argued that
there is anything illegal about the object and the content of these
contracts. The Tribunal/s have] not been made aware of any such
illegality. The reasons which lead to the unenforceability of contracts
for corruption do not apply to the agreements considered in the
present case.3°2

> «

The Respondents now refer to the Tribunals’ “understanding that the
contract was not unlawful, and had not been avoided” and add: “/tjhat
understanding is no longer accurate”.°°3 The Respondents also state that
the “the object [of the Agreements] is unlawful’.3°* They state that the
“objects of the Agreements are not simply the exploitation of gas fields and
gas sale, rather, the implementation of an unlawful Government grant of
rights to Niko”.

304 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 263.

169

579.

580.

581.

The Claimant responded: “That is a novel theory, and a creative one.
However, nothing in the language of the JVA or GPSA suggests a grant of
governmental authority to Niko. Rather, the grant of rights was from the
Government and Petrobangla to BAPEX” .3°5

The Tribunals agree. The object of the Agreements is for BAPEX and Niko
to develop the gas fields under the JVA and for Niko to sell the Gas to
Petrobangla under the GPSA. These are lawful objects. The question
whether Niko was granted governmental authority and whether such
authority was lawfully granted is a question concerning the merits.
Contrary to the claim which was brought before Judge Lagergren, the
Tribunals in the present case do not have to decide a claim which, directly
or indirectly, seeks payment of the proceeds of corruption. Here Niko
requests payment for gas it has delivered and a declaration about liability
for the blowouts. The Tribunals still do not consider these claims or the
agreements under which they are made as illegal or “unlawful’; they still
do not “see why hearing and resolving these claims under the given
circumstances would affect the integrity of the ICSID system” .3°6

The Decision on Jurisdiction stated explicitly that “whether the
investment was made in good faith or not and, if not, what consequences
would have to be drawn from it [...] must be considered as part of the merits
of the dispute”.°°7 The Tribunals see no grounds for reconsidering this
conclusion. The Tribunals continue to be, as they were when issuing their
Decision on Jurisdiction:

mindful of the importance of the ICSID dispute settlement
mechanism and its integrity. In the Tribunal’s view, such integrity is
promoted, and not violated, by the adjudication of disputes submitted
to the Centre under a valid consent to arbitrate. Faced with a binding
arbitration agreement and subject to the specific requirements under
the ICSID Convention, considered elsewhere in this decision, the
Tribunal must address the substance of the dispute. In so doing, the
integrity of the system is protected by the resolution of the contentions

305 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 144.
206 Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 47; this is the passage to which the Respondents refer when in R-
MC, paragraph 149, Footnote 200, refer when stating that the Tribunals’ “understanding is no longer

made (including allegations of violation of public policy) rather than
by avoiding them.3°8

The Tribunals are intent on addressing in this phase of the Arbitrations
precisely this question: are the Respondents correct in seeking the denial
of the merits of Niko’s claims on grounds of corruption? Before doing so,
the Tribunals will consider the objection that they have no jurisdiction to
consider the Respondents’ new argument on the footing that the
Agreements were void ab initio.

5.3 Jurisdiction to decide whether the Agreements are void ab initio

583.

584.

585.

The Respondents now argue that because the Agreements are void the
arbitration clauses were void ab initio, in effect as though they never
existed. In the Respondents’ opinion, the “arbitration clauses are void ab
initio because the underlying Agreements are void ab initio” .3°9

This conclusion is based (i) on the premise that the scope of the
arbitration clauses cannot extend to the question whether the
Agreements existed,3!° and (ii) on the law of Bangladesh which in the
Respondents’ view governs the arbitration clauses and does not apply the
principle of severablility in cases where the underlying agreement is void
ab initio.

The arbitration clauses in the two Agreements in all relevant parts are
identical. The JVA regulates arbitration in Article 18; an identical text is
provided in Article 13 of the GPSA:

ARTICLE — 18 DISPUTES AND ARBITRATION

18.1 The Parties shall make their best efforts to settle amicably
through consultation any dispute arising in connection with the
performance or interpretation of any provision of this Agreement.

18.2 If any dispute mentioned in Article 18.1 has not been settled
through such consultation within ninety (90) days after the dispute
arises, either Party may, by notice to the other Party, propose that the

dispute be referred either for determination by a sole expert or to
arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

[Sole expert or Sole Arbitrator]

18.5 If the Parties faile to refer such dispute to a sole expert under
Article 18.3 or to a Sole Arbitrator under Article 18.4, within sixty (6)
days from giving of notice under Article 18.2, such dispute shall be
referred to the International Center for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (“ICSID”) and the Parties hereby consent to arbitration under
the Treaty establishing ICSID. If for any reason, ICSID fails or refuses
to take jurisdiction over such dispute, the dispute shall be finally
settled by International Chamber of Commerce.

[various issues concerning the arbitral procedure and related matters]

18.12 The right to arbitrate disputes under this agreement shall
survive the termination of this agreement.

The Respondents accept that the arbitration clauses are severable from
the underlying agreements and survive their “termination”; but in the
Respondents’ opinion, severability does not apply if the Agreements are
void ab initio:

The arbitration clauses agreed to by the Parties are clear: they are
separable from the underlying Agreements, but only where those
Agreements have come to end by “termination.” The underlying
Agreements have not come to end by “termination” because they
never existed, and Claimant’s case must therefore be dismissed for
that reason alone.31!

The Claimant denies that the arbitration clauses provide such a
restriction of their severability.312

The Tribunals note that the disputes to which ICSID arbitration
according to Article 18.5 applies are identified in Article 18.1 as “any
dispute arising in connection with the performance or interpretation of any
provision of this Agreement’. In the present case, Niko seeks a
determination of its liability under the JVA; this is an issue arising in
connection with the performance and the interpretation of the JVA. The
Tribunals’ jurisdiction does not disappear just because the Respondents

now argue the JVA is void ab initio. The same must be said about the
GPSA where Niko sought and was awarded payment.

Article 18.12 clarifies one aspect of severability, application of the
arbitration clause after termination of the Agreement. It does not say that
the Parties intended to limit severability to that aspect.

The argument now raised by the Respondents would mean that a party,
merely by alleging the Agreements were void ab initio, could prevent
arbitration on disputes which otherwise the Parties agreed to submit to
ICSID arbitration. The Tribunals do not believe that this is a tenable
interpretation of the Parties’ intention.

The Respondents also seek support for their argument in international
law and the law of Bangladesh. They assert that they “are not challenging
the well-established principle of severability” but argue that “under both
Bangladeshi and international law, the principle of severability does not
apply in one particular circumstance: where the underlying agreement is
void ab initio and therefore never existed as a matter of law”.318

The Parties disagree whether the validity of an ICSID arbitration clause
is governed by Article 25 (1) of the Convention or by the law chosen to
govern the contract, in the present case that of Bangladesh; and they
differ about the content of one and the other of these laws.

The Tribunals take as starting point that the “well-established principle
of severability” is accepted by both Parties. When the Respondents argue
that this principle does not apply in circumstances where the underlying
agreement is void ab initio, they refer to cases and statements where it is
established that the underlying agreement never existed. This is not the
situation here.

The issue here concerns the effect of a certain theory which the
Respondents have chosen. When they introduced the Corruption Claim,
they affirmed the validity of the arbitration clause. It was only when they
decided, without any substantial change of the alleged factual pattern,
that their defence should be considered by reference to a different
provision of the law of Bangladesh that their defence changed: they

sought no longer recognition by the Tribunals that they had avoided the
Agreements but introduced the new defence of asserting that the
Agreements were void ab initio.

The Tribunals have not seen any authority or argument from the
Respondents that would support the exclusion of the “well-established
principle of severability” simply on the basis of a respondent changing the
characterization of the factual pattern presented and relying on a
different legal theory. If such an exception were admitted, the principle
would be deprived of its essence and would be at the mercy of a party’s
changing lines of defence.

In any event, this line in the Respondents’ objection can be decided only
by an examination by the Tribunals’ of the validity of the Agreements.
Since it is an essential element of the Respondents’ position that,
according to the legal principles which they invoke, the arbitration
clauses are not severable from the underlying agreements, the Tribunals
must make a decision that affects both the agreements and the
arbitration clause in them. If the Tribunals agree with the Respondents,
they will have to decide that the Agreements are void ab initio - a decision
on the merits. If they do not and accept jurisdiction, this does not exclude
that, on the merits, the Tribunals find that the Agreements are void or
even void ab initio.

The Tribunals conclude that they must examine the argument and
evidence presented by the Respondents to support their defence
according to which the Agreements are void ab initio. They have the
jurisdiction to do so.

THE REQUEST FOR AVOIDANCE?!4 OF THE AGREEMENTS - THE
LEGAL GROUNDS INVOKED

In these Arbitrations, Niko claims under the two Agreements. The
Respondents deny these claims and, in their Corruption Claim, assert
that, as a result of corruption, both Agreements are void. The Tribunals
now examine the legal grounds invoked by the Respondents to justify this
assertion.

The Parties’ positions - an overview

The relief sought by the Respondents in their Corruption Claim changed
over time. In their requests of 25 March 2016, they sought a declaration
that the Agreements were “voidable” and declared that they exercised
their right to “void” or “rescind” the Agreements.

In their submissions of 29 April 2016, the Respondents relied on Article
102 of the Bangladesh Constitution and concluded that the Agreements
were void. The original request was preserved as an alternative: the
Respondents relied on Section 19 of the Contract Act and chose to
exercise their right to rescind the Agreements, adding that “Niko can only
make a claim for the limited relief of restitution under sections 64 and 65
of the Bangladeshi Contract Act’.

As from their Memorial on Corruption onward the Respondents sought
dismissal of Niko’s claims on the grounds that the Agreements are
“without legal effect and void ab initio”, based on Article 102 of the
Constitution. The Respondents asserted that avoidance of the
Agreements is the result of

e the use of bribery “to influence the Government’s approval’ of the
JVA and the GPSA and

e of the Government’s approval

314 The Tribunals use the term “avoidance” to cover both a finding that a voidable contract has become void
and that a contract was void ab initio.

175

602.

604.

e not being transparent,
e being mala fide and
e being illegal under Bangladeshi law.3!5

In the final form of their requests, the Respondents also argue that
international law prevents the Claimant from seeking relief in ICSID
arbitration and that “Niko’s claims must be dismissed on the merits
because the Agreements are void under Bangladeshi law” .3!© They deny
that the Contract Act is applicable; if it were applicable, the relevant
provision would not be Section 19 but Section 23.

The Claimant argues that the claim for avoidance must be considered
under Section 19 of the Contract Act; Article 102 of the Constitution and
Section 23 of the Contract Act, according to the Claimant, are not
applicable in the circumstances of the present case.

The Tribunals will consider in the present section the relevance and
applicability of the legal bases invoked by the Respondents. They will
commence by examining the question whether Article 102 of the
Constitution is applicable to the Respondents’ Corruption Claim and the
legal principles governing this application. They will then consider the
two cases in which the conclusion of the Agreements was the subject by
judgments in which the High Court Division of the Supreme Court
applied Article 102, the BELA Judgment of May 2010 and the Alam
Judgment of 24 August 2017.

6.2 Avoidance by reference to Article 102 of the Constitution

605.

The principal legal basis for the Respondents’ claim that the Agreements
are void is Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution. The relevant part
of this article reads as follows:

The High Court Division may, if satisfied that no other equally
efficacious remedy is provided by law-

a) on application of any person aggrieved, make an order-

315 Relief requested in R-MC, paragraph 196, and confirmed in all subsequent submissions (see above
Section 3).

(ii) | declaring that any act done or proceeding taken by a person
performing functions in connection with the affairs of the

Republic or of a local authority has been done or taken
without lawful authority and is of no legal effect; [...] 17

6.2.1 Is the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence with respect to Article 102
Writ Petitions applicable in the present Arbitrations?

The Parties agree that (i) Article 102 provides aggrieved persons with the
possibility to apply by Writ Petition to the Supreme Court but that these
Tribunals are not called upon to decide a Writ Petition under Article 102
of the Constitution, (ii) that Article 102 proceedings are available only if
“no other equally efficacious remedy is provided” and (iii) that no evidence
is taken in such proceedings apart from the presentation of affidavits;
judgments pursuant to this provision are based on uncontested facts.

The differences between the Parties here concern (i) the question whether
the validity of the Agreements must be determined by reference to the
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court on Article 102, to the exclusion of
the Contract Act and (ii) the substantive content of this jurisprudence.

The Respondents argue that “improper action” in the Government
approval process requires a finding that the agreements are void ab initio:

Since the process of obtaining Government approval was tainted by
corruption, fraud or other improper action, the approval is illegal and
the contract that resulted from it is void ab initio and without legal
effect.318

Due to the legal nature of the Governmental acts that are at issue here,
the Respondents argue that their case must be considered not under the
Contracts Act but under Article 102 of the Constitution:

... the Supreme Court specifically distinguishes situations where, like
here, the Government or Government entity acts pursuant to statutory

317 Constitution of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, Article 102(2)(a)(ii), 1972, CLA-77, quoted at R-MC,
paragraph 177, Footnote 259 and, more completely, C-CMC, paragraph 353.

612.

power or in its capacity as a sovereign from situations where the
Government functions as an ordinary buyer in the marketplace. In the
latter case, the Contract Act would apply; in the former, it does not.319

They argue that

Bangladesh Supreme Court jurisprudence provides that where, like
here, a government entity acts pursuant to statutory power or in
furtherance of a sovereign right, these matters of public law are
determinative.°2°

This leads the Respondents to introduce the concept of a “public contract’,
subject to rules different from those of the Contract Act:

The Contract Act does not fully govern the validity of a public contract
tainted by corruption.3?!

and as already quoted above

Bangladesh Supreme Court jurisprudence provides that where, like
here, a government entity acts pursuant to statutory power or in
furtherance of a sovereign right, these matters of public law are
determinative.°??

and

However, because BAPEX and Petrobangla are public entities and
Niko bribed Government officials, the agreements do not fall within
the category of voidable agreements under Section 19. Sections 15-19
of the Contract Act govern situations in which the “free consent of the
parties” was compromised. Niko’s bribes did more than compromise
Respondents’ free consent: they illegally procured the approval of the
Government and the grant of rights to public goods.

In response to the Claimant’s argument based on the limitations in the
scope of the Writ Petition jurisdiction under Article 102, the Respondents
state:

Respondents are not asking the Tribunals to assume writ jurisdiction
over them. While Niko is correct that Article 102(2) itself does not
“reflect an enactment of new substantive law,” the case law created

through its operation does create substantive law in Bangladesh
which the Tribunals must apply here. Bangladesh is a common law
jurisdiction and Bangladeshi Supreme Court pronouncements,
including those made in its exercises of Article 102 power, establish
binding legal norms, creating precedent to which all other courts and
tribunals applying Bangladeshi law are bound through the principle
of stare decisis. Indeed, international Tribunals have applied common
law, including writ jurisprudence, in other arbitral cases.524

Based on these considerations, the Respondents argue that

Article 102 jurisprudence constitutes Bangladeshi law governing the
validity of Agreements and must be applied by a tribunal asserting
exclusive jurisdiction over the validity of agreements under Articles
13.1 of the JVA and 15.1 GPSA.9?5

The Claimant denies that the jurisprudence from cases decided in
proceedings on Article 102 Writ Petitions apply to a dispute between
parties to a contract. It insists inter alia on the limited competence of the
court under Article 102 which provides “for a summary form of public
interest litigation of an act of a Bangladesh State organ” to which the State
of Bangladesh was a necessary party.°?° The Claimant argues that
because the right to exploit gas resources had been granted to BAPEX
prior to the conclusion of the JVA, that agreement does not amount to
the exercise of public functions; nor can this be said of the GPSA. The
Claimant also emphasises the limitations in the jurisdiction of the
Supreme Court: (i) relief under Article 102 being available only when
there are no “other equally efficacious remedies provided by the law’, (ii)
“a Writ court cannot and should not decide any disputed question of fact
which requires evidence to be taken for settlement” and (iii) petitions under
Article 102 must be presented in a timely manner.327

The Claimant concluded that the Respondents attempted “to create anew
cause of action, non-existent in Bangladesh law, applying principles
supposedly developed in jurisprudence under Article 102 to a claim that
could never be heard under that constitutional provision” .328

The Tribunals have taken note that the law of Bangladesh, through
Article 102, provides a remedy in cases where a Governmental act or
proceeding has been decided or carried out “without lawful authority” and
that such act can be declared as “of no legal effect’. The article does not
provide substantive rules determining when such acts or proceedings
lack “lawful authority’. When applying Article 102, the jurisprudence of
the Supreme Court has given relevant examples and provided guidance
in determining cases of lacking lawful authority.

The Respondents do not request the Tribunals to grant a Writ Petition
but invite the Tribunals to apply this jurisprudence of the Supreme Court
when determining acts and proceedings lacking lawful authority. By
reference to this jurisprudence the Respondents request the Tribunals to
declare the relevant governmental acts as being “without legal effect’.

In the present case, it is undisputed that both Agreements required
governmental approval and did indeed receive such approval.329 When
examining the validity of this approval by reference to the law of
Bangladesh, the Tribunals must consider the grounds on which under
that law such approval may be considered as “of no legal effect’. The
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court under Article 102 provides examples
and directives for such finding and the Tribunals must consider this
jurisprudence when examining the validity of the approvals and related
matters. The question whether the Agreements themselves must or may
be considered Governmental acts is not decisive for determining the
relevance of the Article 102 jurisprudence in these cases.

The Tribunals therefore agree with the Respondents that, when
considering the validity of governmental approval of the Agreements, they
must consider the precedents developed by the Supreme Court in the
application of Article 102 of the Constitution. The Respondents expressed
this position in the following terms in response to a question from the
Tribunals at the Hearing:59°

Tribunals must look first at the exercise of governmental authority
because if authorization to enter into a contract is granted improperly,

the contract is without legal effect and void ab initio, and the Contract
Act does not apply.*3!

This conclusion is aligned with another consideration put forward by the
Respondents. As mentioned above, the Respondents highlighted the
responsibility of the Tribunals resulting from their exclusive
jurisdiction.352

If the Tribunals cannot apply the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court,
then the exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunals cannot affect the
jurisdiction of the Supreme Court to hear the writ petitions pending
before it. Otherwise, the orders and decisions of the Tribunals would
nullify a fundamental area of Bangladesh law governing the validity
of improperly procured rights to public resources.333

The Tribunals conclude that, when applying the law of Bangladesh in
determining the validity of the Agreements and of the Government acts
and proceedings relating to the Agreements, they have regard to the
principles developed by the Supreme Court in applying Article 102.

6.2.2 The relevant cases

In their discussion of the Article 102 jurisprudence the Parties have
referred to a number of cases of which two are of particular importance.
Both of these cases were brought before the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court.

The first concerned the licensing of a TV channel. The case as it appeared
before the High Court Division and before the Appellate Division of the
Supreme Court is referred to under partly different names.

The High Court Division decided the case by Judgment of 27 March 2002
under the case name Chowdhury Mohmood Hossain v. Bangladesh and
others.334 The appeal against this Judgment was decided by the Appellate

333 R-RC, paragraph 333; the Respondents point out in a footnote to this passage that they “maintain their
position that the Supreme Court of Bangladesh retains its jurisdiction to hear writ petitions under Article 102
with respect to the JVA and the GPSA ...” R-RC, paragraph 333, Footnote 574.

Division of the Supreme Court on 1 July 2002, denominated as Ekushey
Television Ltd. & ano. v. Dr Chowdhuy Mahmood Hasan & ors; and
Citicorp International Linanee corp and anr v. Dr Chowdhury Mahmood
Hasan & ors; and Dr Chowdhuy Mahmood Hasan & ors v. Government of
Bangladesh & ors.335

The Tribunals will refer to the case as the Television case or by short
versions of the official denominations.

The licensing agreement was concluded by the Ministry of Information
and A.S. Mahmud, acting for Ekushey Television Limited (or ETV) to
which the license subsequently was assigned. The High Court Division
noted a number of irregularities in the process by which ETV was
selected. This included changes in the evaluation report by the technical
committee which first had rejected ETV and in a revised version ranked
it in top position; the Court found the “manner in which the report was
prepared and submitted was mala fide”. It also examined procedural
aspects of the signing of the license agreement and the references to the
Ministries involved. It concluded that the signing of the licensing
agreement “may be considered irregular to some extent but it cannot be
considered as invalid or void”.

This distinction between minor irregularities and acts performed mala
fide is reflected in the final conclusions of the Judgment:

...we finally hold that changing of the evaluation report is mala fide
and the manner in which it is done is not at all transparent and
acceptance of offer of ETV on the basis of this changed report and all
subsequent action taken on the basis of that report including signing
of the licensing agreement are also mala fide...

We have found that signing of the licensing agreement itself or its
subsequent transfer to ETV Ltd. was not unlawful but we have found
the process followed for selecting the ETV as most responsive was not
transparent and ultimately the acceptance of the proposal of ETV was
mala fide and all subsequent acts including granting of license were
also mala fide [...]

335 Ekushey Television Ltd. v. Chowdhury Mahmood Hasan, (2002) 54 DLR (AD) 130, RLA-30 (bis).

182

It is declared that the act of acceptance of the proposal of ETV as most
responsive and granting of license to ETV by respondent No. 1 was
done without any lawful authority and is of no legal effect.33®

628. On appeal, the Appellate Division made a number of pronouncements
which are relevant for the issues before these Tribunals.

629. The Appellate Division addressed the relationship between the law of
contract and Article 102. The respondents in that case had argued that
“once a contract is concluded, it can be challenged only if there is a breach
of terms and conditions and then again, not under Article 102 of the
Constitution”. The Court responded:

This line of argument is not acceptable to us, as the writ petition before
the High Court Division was not regarding breach of terms and
conditions of a contract. In this particular case the High Court Division
looked into the procedure adopted in giving license to ETV and on
doing so, it has exercised its jurisdiction under Article 102 which on
the facts of the case, in our view, is quite justifiable.33”

630. The Court also responded to an argument concerning the timing of the
application. One of the appellants had pointed out that

. on the basis of license issued by the Government the respondent
No. 8 has been operating for more than two years and rights of bona
fide third parties were subsisting including those of the petitioners as
foreign investors, in addition to those of international lenders, the
large number of employees and the growing audience of respondent
No 8 and the judgment in effect destroys those rights.338

631. The Appellate Division responded to this argument:

The rule in respect of the court’s power to inquire into delayed and old
claim is not a rule of law, but a practice and depends much on proper
exercise of discretion. Each case must depend on its fact such as how
the breach of fundamental right occurred, the nature of the injury and
lastly how the delay is caused. The test in such case is not physical

running of time but whether a parallel right has accrued and whether
the lapse of time can be attributed to latches and negligence.

But above all, while the circumstance justifying the conduct exists, the
illegality which is manifest, cannot be sustained on the sole ground
of latches. [...] Therefore, the petitioners claim that there was no delay
in approaching the court. The High Court Division has accepted the
explanation and we do not find any reason not to accept it.389

The second case concerned the Government approval of the construction
of container terminals in the Chittagong Port (the “Container Terminals
case”). The High Court decided by a Judgment of 26 November 2002,
denominated Engineer Mahmudul-ul Islam and others v. Government of
the Peoples Republic of Bangladesh and others.34° The Appellate Division
confirmed the judgment on 17 May 2003 in SSA Bangladesh Limited v.
Engineer Mahmud Ul-Islam and others.34!

The High Court Division considered the approval given by the
Government to the project of the container terminals under Article 102.
No contract had yet been concluded with the prospective investor. The
Respondents describe the case as “involving irregular government
approval’. The Court declared the approval “to be illegal, without lawful
authority and of no legal effect and accordingly all actions taken on the
basis of the impugned approval are declared to be illegal, without authority
and of no legal effect” 342

The Respondents rely on this decision, concluding that “the court
declared that ‘any misuse of power by any executive benefitting a private
party in dealing with any State property’ is ‘without lawful authority and
of no legal effect” .348

The Respondents also emphasise the Court’s statement that the declared
illegality of the approval and its effects extended to “all actions taken on
the basis of the impugned approval’ .344

On appeal the judgment was confirmed. Among the findings of the
Appellate Division particular mention should be made of the following
passage:

In the instant case though a contract has not yet been entered into as
yet but the process that has been adopted in the matter of approval
of the project being not fair, reasonable or according to the established
principles of Law or practice or procedure, we are of the view that the
impugned action is mala fide, arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable and
does not have the sanction of any Law or norms.345

6.2.3 The principles of the Article 102 jurisprudence relevant for the
present decision

When examining the Article 102 jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and
its relevance for the Tribunals’ decision, a distinction must be made
between (i) procedural conditions that must be observed by the Supreme
Court when applying Article 102 and (ii) the substantive principles
emerging from that jurisprudence with respect to determining acts and
proceedings that are “without legal authority” and thus must be declared
as “without legal effect.

Concerning procedural conditions for the exercise of Article 102
reviews, the Claimant has argued that Article 102 Writ Petitions are “a
summary form of public interest litigation” not available to disputes
between the parties to a contract and in the absence of the Government
as a party to the proceedings. These may be restrictions implied in the
type of action considered by Article 102, even though the Court itself
considers its jurisdiction broadly. In the Container Terminals case, the
High Court Division, relying on the decision in the Television case,
declared that it “does not suffer from any lack of jurisdiction under Article
102 of the Constitution to hear a person”; and that it was a “question of
exercise of discretion” for the High Court Division whether it will treat a
person as “aggrieved”, depending on “the facts and circumstances of each
case” .346

345 SSA Bangladesh Limited v. UL-Islam,RLA-161, paragraph 61.
346 Exhibit RLA-160, paragraph 30.

185

639.

640.

641.

642.

In any event, the Tribunals have explained that, in the present case, they
are considering the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court in a case in
which they have exclusive subject matter jurisdiction. They will therefore
consider this jurisprudence as part of Bangladeshi law, irrespective of the
question whether, under the procedural rules of that law, the Supreme
Court may exercise Article 102 jurisdiction in contractual cases.

Another restriction on the Supreme Court’s Article 102 jurisdiction is
expressly spelled out in the provision itself: the Supreme Court may
intervene only if it is “satisfied that no other equally efficacious remedy is
provided by law”. The Tribunals see in this restriction, too, a provision
that concerns the allocation of jurisdiction between different authorities
within Bangladesh. In the present case, however, there is no need nor
justification for such allocation. The Tribunals have exclusive jurisdiction
for determining the validity of the Agreements, including any issues
concerning the validity of their governmental approval.

It follows that there is no other “equally efficacious remedy” which would
prevent the Tribunals from examining the objections raised by the
Respondents against the validity of the approvals of the Agreements by
the Government.

Finally, the Tribunals have considered the procedural restrictions
concerning the evidence that may be considered by the Supreme Court
in proceedings according to Article 102. In Article 102 proceedings the
Supreme Court must make its findings on the basis of uncontested
evidence. The Supreme Court (Appellate Division) has been very clear in
this respect

However extraordinary its powers, a writ Court cannot and should
not decide any disputed question of fact which requires evidence to
be taken for settlement. The principle is well-settled and we have no
hesitation therefore in observing that all the findings. orders and
observations made by the High Court Division on the question of title
and possession of the disputed lands are wholly untenable and
uncalled for and the dispute can only be decided one way or the other
by a competent Civil Court upon taking evidence.347

No such restriction is imposed on the Tribunals in the present ICSID
proceedings. When examining the Respondents’ Corruption Claim in the
light of principles developed by the Supreme Court in Article 102 cases,
the Tribunals will therefore consider all evidence before them and, where
such evidence is contested, will make the necessary determinations.

As to the substantive principles emerging from the Supreme Court’s
jurisprudence on Article 102, the Tribunals have reached the following
conclusions from their examination of the cases and the Parties’
argument.

The examination under Article 102 concerns “any act done or proceeding
taken’, provided the act or proceedings are done or taken “by a person
performing functions in connection with affairs of the Republic’. The
examination concerns the regularity of governmental action and the
standards which this action must meet.

The Respondents assert that the Article 102 review applies not only to
government actions but also “actions of State entities”. This is not what
Article 102 says. The acts that may have to be considered are those of a
person “exercising governmental functions”. In the present case, the acts
in issue are the Government’s approval to the JVA and the GPSA and
possibly Governmental acts that preceded this approval and allowed the
negotiations to reach the state where approval could be given.

When applying Article 102, the Supreme Court considers not only the
approval itself but also the process leading to it. Indeed, Article 102 refers
to “any act done or proceeding taken”. Serious irregularities in the process
justify a declaration that the act or procedure is of no legal effect.

Article 102 concerns “acts done” and “proceedings taken” and requires an
examination whether they were done or taken “without lawful authority”.
It is the irregularity of the act or proceeding that is the basis for the
Court’s declaration. In other words, irregularities which have no effect on
the act or proceeding do not enter into consideration. Indeed, the
judgments on which the Parties rely all consider situations where the
irregularity in the process affected the Governmental approval.

With the exception of the Alam Judgment, which will be considered
below, the Parties have not presented any case where the Supreme Court

187

650.

651.

652.

decided that an approval obtained by corruption had to be considered as
given “without lawful authority’. The Respondents argue that “corruptly-
obtained Government authorisation” is an “unlawful exercise of
Government power’ which renders the grant of rights and the resulting
contracts “unlawful and without legal effect’.3+8 The Claimant has not
contested that governmental approval obtained by corruption would be
an act “without lawful authority”. The Tribunals see no reason why Article
102 should not apply to Government approvals obtained by corruption.

The Respondents go a step further and conclude from the cases
considered that

The Article 102 case law implements the public policy against
corruption in Bangladesh. As the Supreme Court stated, the public
interest is protected by nullifying corruptly procured rights, even ina
situation where a project is being implemented and would materially
benefit the people of Bangladesh.349

The Tribunals have examined the references on which the Respondents
rely. They did not find support for this affirmation. From these references
and other statements of the Supreme Court, it appears to the Tribunals
that the Court has not considered the question whether it must deprive
of legal effect governmental acts which gave rise to a project that
materially benefits the people of Bangladesh.

Governmental action, i.e. the approval and the process leading to it, is
distinct from the contract to which it relates. The Court made this clear
in the Television case as quoted above. The Court made it also clear,
however, that the consequences of a finding of “no legal effect”? concerns
not only the approval and the process leading to it but also “all actions
taken on the basis of the impugned approval [which] are declared to be
illegal, without lawful authority and of no effect’.35° As a result, contracts
that may otherwise be lawful and valid, if their approval by the
Government is without lawful authority, they are without legal effect just
as the approval itself.

The regularity of governmental action is presumed; the burden is on the
party asserting the contrary. The Supreme Court has stated this principle
in no uncertain terms:

It is to be presumed that all actons taken by the government officials
are in accordance with law and the public interest and if any action
of the government official is challenged, the challenger is required to
prove such allegations.35!

Finally, the Tribunals conclude in particular from the judgments in the
Television case that the time within which the relief under Article 102
must be requested is not fixed. Different criteria must be considered,
including the question whether the illegality is manifest. In the Television
case the High Court verified that there “was no delay in approaching the
court’. The Appellate Division has supported this approach.

The Tribunals now will consider whether and how these principles
derived from the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence were applied in the two
cases before the High Court Division relating to the JVA and the GPSA,
viz. the judgments in the BELA case and in the Alam case.

The BELA Judgment and its relevance

Prior to the Alam proceedings another petitioner, the Bangladesh
Environmental Lawyers Association (BELA) had brought, on 12
September 2005, a Writ Petition under Article 102 of the Constitution
before the High Court Division of the Supreme Court; it was recorded as
petition 6911 of 2005. The petition was decided by a Judgment delivered
orally on 16 and 17 November 2009, and in writing on 2 and 3 May 2010.

The BELA petitioner sought inter alia declarations that the JVA was made
without lawful authority and was of no legal effect and that was “procured
through flawed processes and resorting to fraudulent means and forged
documents by Niko”. In addition, the petitioners sought a number of other
declarations concerning the blowouts and the damage caused by them.

The ten respondents in these proceedings included the Government of
Bangladesh, represented by the Secretary, Energy Division, Ministry of

351 ULIslam v. Bangladesh, RLA-160, paragraph 18.

Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, Petrobangla, BAPEX and the two
Niko companies.

The proceedings concerning this petition have been described above in
Section 2.6.1. In the present context it is sufficient to mention the
following points:

The High Court Division received a number of affidavits, including
documents, but did not consider any other evidence. On this basis it
concluded:

From the above, we do find that the JVA was not obtained by flawed
process by resorting to fraudulent means.%5?

With respect to the blowouts it decided that the amount of the damage
had to be determined by “the Court below after taking proper evidence or
by mutual agreement amongst the parties involved” 353

In the Alam Judgment the High Court Division distinguished the BELA
case, holding that the causes of action in the two proceedings were
different, pointing out that in the BELA Judgment “did not look into the
issue of corruption and BELA did not produce any evidence of corruption
[...] without any evidence of corruption, it was not possible to reach the
conclusion that the JVA was executed in bad faith, through misuse of
power, or in an improper manner rendering the JVA illegal and without any
legal effect’ .354

The Tribunals note that, indeed, the allegations of “flawed processes” and
“fraudulent means” in the BELA case did not include the corruption
charges which the petitioner in the Alam case made. In the BELA
Judgment no findings were made with respect to corruption.

The absence of any corruption findings or even allegations in the BELA
proceedings deserves to be noted; as the Tribunals pointed out already
in the Decision on Jurisdiction, the BELA Judgment was issued on 2 and

352 BELA Judgment, CLA-143, p. 40.

3 May 2010, two years after the ACC Charge Sheet.355 By the time the
BELA Judgment was issued, the Zia Government had been replaced
following what the Respondents refer to as “violent political unrest and the
declaration of a state of emergency” and the arrival in January 2007 of a
new government which “spearheaded a massive anti-graft campaign’ 35°
Nevertheless, neither the Government nor the Respondents in the BELA
Proceedings raised any of the charges they raise in the present
proceedings.

Finally, the Tribunals point out that the BELA Judgment was issued on
2 and 3 May 2010, at a time when only RfA I had been received with the
Centre on 12 April 2010; RfA II was received by the Centre only on 23
May 2010. In other words, no ICSID Tribunal had been established; the
BELA Judgment did not intrude on the exclusive jurisdiction of these
Tribunals.

6.4 The Alam Judgment and its relevance for the Tribunals’ decision

666.

667.

The High Court Division of the Supreme Court delivered a second
judgment in a Writ Petition No 5673/2016 under Article 102 in relation
to the JVA and the GPSA. The proceedings had been brought by Professor
Alam on 9 May 2016, shortly after the Respondents had re-introduced in
these Arbitrations the corruption issue in the modified version of the
Corruption Claim. The High Court Division issued its Judgment on 24
August 2017, declaring, inter alia, that the JVA and the GPSA were
“without lawful authority and of no legal effect and thus void ab initio”.

The Respondents produced this judgment in the Arbitrations on 21
November 2017. The Parties commented on the procedure, the issue of
jurisdiction, and the tenor of the judgment, as well as its relevance for
the present proceedings. The Tribunals have described the case above in
Section 2.5. The discussion here concerns the admissibility and relevance
of this judgment and the legal principles applied for the present cases.

6.4.1 The admissibility of the production of the Alam Judgment in the
Arbitrations

The Judgment of the High Court Division was submitted after the Post-
Hearing Submissions had been filed, which marked the closure of the
proceedings concerning the Corruption Claim. The Tribunals must first
consider whether the Judgment may be admitted in these proceedings.

On the basis of the explanations provided by the Parties, the Tribunals
noted that the Judgment was issued in proceedings which had been
brought to the Tribunals’ attention previously and which were considered
in the Tribunals’ Decision on Exclusivity of 19 July 2016. The Judgment
directly relates to an important matter before the Tribunals, in particular
Article 102 of the Constitution as basis for the Respondents’ relief sought
by the Corruption Claim.

The Tribunals therefore consider the Alam Judgment of such importance
that they deem it proper to allow it on the record, even though the
evidentiary record had been closed. Consequently, the Parties had to be
given an opportunity to comment upon the Judgment. They have done
so in their submissions of 11 and 21 December 2017. The Tribunals are
satisfied that, for the purpose of the present decision, no further
submissions on the Judgment and its relevance for this decision are
required.

The Claimant also raised objections to the conduct of the Respondents in
the proceedings before the High Court Division. It argued that the
Respondents failed to comply with the Tribunals’ Decision on
Exclusivity.357

The Respondents deny that this was the case. They point out that they
“filed an application on 14 August 2016 informing the Court of the Decision
on Exclusivity and asking the Court to vacate the stay prohibiting payment
to Niko and conform its decisions to the decisions of the Tribunals” .358 The
Respondents state that “there never were ‘explicit directions’ to do more”
than that.359

677.

The Claimant stated that it stands ready to tender evidence from the
proceedings before the High Court Division but has refrained from doing
so since the evidentiary record was closed.

The Tribunals have noted that, when the Claimant raised before these
Tribunals its complaint about the Respondents’ alleged failure, the
Claimant did not request any specific sanction. It appears to the
Tribunals that the Decision on the Corruption Claim can be made
without deciding the question whether the Respondents failed to
defend the Tribunals’ exclusive jurisdiction as actively before the High
Court Division as the Tribunals’ decision required. The Tribunals
therefore do not make any finding at this stage, but reserve to revisit
the issue. In particular the Tribunals advise the Parties that the
Tribunals may adopt a different course if the issue arises again in the
appeal proceedings announced by the Claimant or in other proceedings
before judicial or other authorities in Bangladesh.

6.4.2 The Alam Judgment and the Tribunals’ exclusive jurisdiction

In their Decision on Exclusivity of 19 July 2016, the Tribunals confirmed
that they have “sole and exclusive subject matter jurisdiction with respect
to [...] the validity of the JVA and the GPSA, including all questions relating
to the avoidance of these agreements on grounds of corruption”.

The Respondents explain that the Decision on Exclusivity was brought to
the attention of the High Court Division. Indeed, the Judgment records
that Mr Rokanuddin Mahmud, appearing on behalf of Respondent No
4, brought the decision on exclusivity to the attention of the court3©° .
The High Court Division nevertheless addressed the request for
avoidance of the JVA and the GPSA on grounds of corruption and
rendered a decision on the merits, declaring the Agreements void ab initio.

When seeking to justify its decision on the merits in conflict with the
Decision on Exclusivity, the High Court Division identified three parts of
the decision it had to make: (i) and (ii) concerned the question whether
the JVA and the GPSA, respectively, should be declared void ab initio and
(iii) whether Niko’s assets should be attached and seized.

360 See paragraph 28, p. 28 of the document entitled “Reformatted clean copy of Judgment in Write Petition”
filed by the Respondents on 29 November 2017

It stated that

... ICSID does not have the power to carry out judicial review of
Bangladesh Government action as exercised by us under Article 102
of the Bangladesh Constitution. [...] The judicial review powers of the
Bangladesh Court also cannot be exercised by an ICSID tribunal since
ICSID tribunals have no powers to seize the proceeds of crime being
enjoyed by [Niko] in Bangladesh. ICSID tribunals may only issue a
pecuniary award but cannot punish corruption or declare invalid
unlawful exercise of executive powers. The proper forum for the
determination of issues such as unlawful exercise of executive
authority tainted by bribery and corruption of Bangladesh
Government officials is the Bangladesh Supreme Court applying
Bangladesh law under Article 102 of the Bangladesh Constitution.
ICSID tribunals may benefit from our finding and there does not need
to be any conflict since we are not infringing on the jurisdiction of the
ICSID tribunals.%¢!

This reasoning fails to distinguish between the different roles and
responsibilities of these Tribunals and the Supreme Court or other bodies
which may be concerned with issues over which the Tribunals have sole
and exclusive jurisdiction. The Tribunals do not assume the role of the
High Court Division and do not decide Writ Petitions under Article 102 of
the Constitution. In the Decision on Exclusivity the Tribunals made it
clear that the exclusivity of their substance matter jurisdiction

... does not affect the personal jurisdiction of the courts in Bangladesh
in other respects. These courts may well receive and determine claims
by persons over which the Tribunals do not have jurisdiction and
adjudicate such claims. In making their decision involving other
parties, the courts of Bangladesh, however, are bound to conform to
and implement the decisions rendered by these Tribunals that are
within the competence of these Tribunals. This means, for instance,
that it is for these Tribunals, and the Tribunals alone, to decide
whether the JVA and the GPSA were procured by corruption, [....]
When seized by a claim of a party not subject to the jurisdiction of the
Tribunals, a court in Bangladesh may entertain that claim but it must
conform in its decision to those of the Tribunals.36?

685.

The Tribunals have discussed these principles and their justification in
the Decision on Exclusivity and they see no justification for reconsidering
this decision. For clarification, they add the following.

When making their decision on the validity of the Agreements, the
Tribunals consider the law of Bangladesh, including any relevant
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court under Article 102, as has been
explained above in Section 6.2.1. Indeed, the Respondents have expressly
invited the Tribunals to consider their Corruption Claim and the effect of
corruption under that Article.

As the Tribunals have explained in the Decision on Exclusivity, the
exclusivity of their substance matter jurisdiction implies that the State of
Bangladesh, including its courts, is bound by the decisions of these
Tribunals. When the Supreme Court or any other court or authority in
Bangladesh is faced with the question of the validity of the Agreements,
it may not deviate from these Tribunals’ decision, whether the parties
concerned are those in the present Arbitrations or other parties.

Insofar as the Alam Judgment makes substantive findings that differ
from those by these Tribunals, in the present decision or elsewhere, such
findings are in violation of the Tribunals’ exclusive subject matter
jurisdiction and of the ICSID Convention. This applies also to any
subsequent action, based on such findings.

This conclusion does not prevent the Tribunals, when they apply the law
of Bangladesh, to consider the Alam Judgment as part of the
jurisprudence of the courts of Bangladesh. The Respondents have
insisted on the relevance of the principles applied by the High Court
Division in that Judgment and invited the Tribunals to “give particular
consideration to the Supreme Court’s judgment in determining how the
laws of Bangladesh would be applied” .3°

When considering the Alam Judgment in its relation to the jurisprudence
concerning Article 102, the Tribunals must, however, not overlook the
factual assumptions made by the High Court Division when it reached

363 Respondents’ letter of 21 November 2017, p. 4.

195

686.

687.

688.

its findings in law and the fact that the Judgment is subject to appeal
proceedings before the Appellate Division.36+

6.4.3 The asserted res judicata effect of the BELA Judgment

When commenting on the Alam Judgment, the Claimant referred to the
BELA Judgment and holding there of the High Court Division of the
Supreme Court that “the JVA was not obtained by flawed process by
resorting to fraudulent means”. The Claimant contrasted this holding with
the Alam Judgement and stated:

Despite this, the Court in the present writ petition justified ignoring
this prior proceeding by asserting that it arose from a different cause
of action and there is no uniformity of parties”. That finding is plainly
erroneous: the BELA Proceedings were conducted under Article 102
of the Constitution, examined precisely the same exercise(s) of
executive authority with respect to the JVA, included each of the
Government of Bangladesh, BAPEX and Petrobangla as parties, and
were both brought by Writ Petitioners acting in exactly the same
representative/ public interest capacity.°°

The Tribunals need not examine whether the BELA Judgment has res
judicata effect on High Court Division in the Alam case and whether in
the latter case the Court was precluded from examining the validity of
the Agreements again, this time under the aspect of corruption. The
question whether the Agreements are void or voidable is a matter which
the present Tribunals have to decide as determined in the Decision on
Exclusivity. In this determination the Tribunals take account of
principles of Bangladeshi law, in particular with respect to the
application of Article 102 of the Constitution. In the application of this
law to the facts of this case, however, they are bound neither by the Alam
nor the BELA Judgments.

The BELA Judgment nevertheless has some relevance insofar as, in that
case, the High Court examined the process by which the JVA was agreed
and approved by the Government. While the Tribunals are not bound by
the High Court’s conclusion, they noted with interest the Court’s
examination of the action of the Government from the perspective of
Article 102 and the results of this examination.

689.

690.

The BELA Judgment is of interest in the present case also, for another
reason mentioned above: there is no indication that, in the BELA
proceedings the Respondents and the Government made any reference to
the corruption charges, although by the time the Judgment was
announced orally on 16 and 17 November 2009, the Joint Investigation
of Niko’s alleged corruption had well advanced and the ACC had issued
on 5 May 2008 its Charge Sheet, which contained the essence of the
corruption allegations which the Petitioner in the Alam case invoked and
on which the High Court relied in its Judgment.

6.4.4 The factual assumptions in the Alam Judgment

The Writ Petition proceedings under Article 102, as stated by the
Claimant, “are purely summary procedures based on affidavit evidence
alone; for this reason, courts may not make determination based on
disputed issues of fact which would require weighing of evidence” .3° The
Court confirmed this rule in the Alam Judgment. It asserted that it did
not need to rely on disputed facts since its conclusions were supported
by admissions of Niko; and it listed the admissions on which it relied for
its decision:

[Niko (Bangladesh)] also submits that the allegations in the writ
petition are disputed questions of facts. We are of the view that we do
not need to rely on any disputed question of fact in this situation since,
in addition to admitting to making payments of bribes to the then State
Minister for Energy AKM Mosharaf Hossain for obtaining and
retaining business interests in Bangladesh for its subsidiaries, [Niko
(Bangladesh)] brazenly admits to making payments of over US$ 4
million to Mr. Qasim Sharif and US$ 500,000 to Mr. Salim Bhuiyan
for their services in making “payments to Government officials” and
for “arranging meetings with Government officials”.3°7

and
Regarding the submission of [Niko (Bangladesh)] that some of the

evidence cannot be relied upon because [Niko (Bangladesh)] has not
been allowed to cross-examine Mr. Giasudding al Mamoon, Mr. Salim

Bhuiyan, or Corporal Duggan, who all made statements adverse to
[Niko (Bangladesh)], we are of the view that it is not necessary for us
to rely on these statements since there are other undisputed facts and
evidence ...768

The Respondents summarised the manner in which the Court
established the facts on which it relied:

While the Court had evidence of disputed facts, it stated that it did
not need to decide the issues of fact Niko disputes. The facts Niko
admits suffice.3°?

The Claimant objected and asserted that, despite having

...no jurisdiction to determine disputed issues of fact [...], the Court
proceeded to make the applicable findings on the spurious basis that
the decision was based only on “undisputed facts”. However, this
assertion does not withstand scrutiny.3”°

The Tribunals have examined the Alam Judgment and noted that it is
replete with statements of fact that differ from the “admissions” by Niko.

A particularly striking example of the Court’s reliance on facts that are
far from being admitted or undisputed is the following statement:

The admitted payments made to agents and Government officials in
Bangladesh were clearly built into the prices of the contracts entered
into by [Niko Canada] through its subsidiaries. The eventual prices to
be paid by Bangladeshi consumers for the gas to be supplied by [Niko
Canada] were thus artificially inflated by these corrupt payments, to
take into account the fees paid to Niko’s on the ground agents and
Bangladeshi government officials.37!

In view of the evidence available, uncontested or not, this is a remarkable
and surprising finding. There is no evidence before these Tribunals to
show that the price agreed in the GPSA was “inflated” by corrupt
payments or at all. It has not even been alleged that the price at which
the gas was sold was inflated. The High Court Division does not mention
any evidence to support its assumption of inflated prices.

The evidence shows the contrary: It is undisputed that the price agreed
in the GPSA was lower than other prices which, at the same time,
Petrobangla agreed to pay other suppliers. Indeed, in the BELA Judgment
the same High Court noted that under the GPSA Petrobangla paid
US$1.75 per MCF while under identified other contracts Petrobangla
agreed to US$2.75 or even US$2.90.372

The Respondents themselves have explained that the gas price was
negotiated by Petrobangla, the sole purchaser, in full knowledge of prices
by other suppliers:

There are multiple suppliers and a single buyer, Petrobangla.
Petrobangla negotiates a price with each supplier based on field-
specific economic considerations and its relationship with that
particular company. The best indication of what “a reasonable person
in [Petrobangla’s] position would have paid for” the Feni gas is the
price negotiated between Petrobangla and the Feni joint venture
partners. Where parties have agreed in an arm’s-length transaction
on a price, that is the best measure of the market price for the good,
particularly where, as here, none of the conditions of the sale would
change between the negotiated price and the hypothetical price.373

During the negotiations for the GPSA, Niko repeatedly requested a price
higher than that offered by Petrobangla. It did not succeed. Eventually,
it had to accept the price on which Petrobangla insisted.

The price which Niko eventually had to accept for the Feni gas was
negotiated in the Gas Pricing Committee.374 There is no indication or even
allegation that this committee, or the representatives from the
Respondents and the Ministry represented in it, built into the price on
which they insisted an allowance for Niko’s “corrupt payments”.

The assumption in the Alam Judgment of “artificially inflated’ prices by
which Niko sought to recover its corrupt payments appears to the
Tribunals as a confirmation of what the Claimant described as a “results-
driven, partial approach”.

A similar observation can be made about another factual assumption,
which is frequently repeated in the Alam Judgment and forms one of the

372 BELA Judgment, CLA-143, p. 37.

374 For details see above, Section 4.2 and the Decision on Jurisdiction Section 3.3.

199

foundations of the finding of corruption: the Court relies on the existence
of a “corrupt scheme”, or “sophisticated corruption scheme”, characterising
Niko’s activity in Bangladesh.375 The existence and components of this
“scheme” is described by the Court in a variety of versions. One of these
versions reads as follows:

The scheme of corruption set up by [Niko] during 2003-2006 was for
the payment of hidden consultancy fees amounting to millions of
dollars received in Swiss bank accounts of companies incorporated in
offshore jurisdictions, for the layering of those clandestine payments
though [recte: through?] different companies in offshore places such
as Barbados and Cayman Islands, and for eventual payments of
illegal gratifications to politically influential people for their ability to
“obtain and arrange” meetings with Bangladeshi Government
officials, as was admittedly done by Mr. Salim Bhuiyan, or to “assist
in the execution” of the JVA by making payments to Bangladesh
Government officials to “expedite and secure” the performance of
official duties of Government officers, as was admittedly done by Mr.
Qasim Sharif. Under the laws of Bangladesh this set up of [Niko]
cannot be treated as anything other than a scheme for bribery and
corruption. This scheme has been unearthed by the international law
enforcing authorities in Canada, United States, and Bangladesh
acting in close co-operation for the purposes of fighting the global
menace of corruption.376

702. In another passage, the Court describes the conclusions which it draws
from Niko’s admissions, asserting that this conclusion is reached without
having to rely on “disputed questions of fact”:

Despite the many layers used to hide the payments and the
channeling of these payments through numerous offshore bank
accounts, the law enforcing agencies in Bangladesh, Canada, and the
United States must be commended for their united and effective work
in tracing the trail of the corrupt payments from Niko Canada
(respondent 5) through Barbados bank of respondent No. 4 [Niko
(Bangladesh)], then through Swiss bank account of Niko’s agent and
President Mr. Qasim Sharif to Mr. Sali Bhuyian, and finally to the
eventual recipients in Bangladesh.377

703. And another passage quoted above announcing “other undisputed facts

and evidence” continues as follows:

376 Alam Judgment, paragraph 47.
377 Alam Judgment, paragraph 49.

. such as bank records, contracts for payments to Government
officials, and the own admissions of respondent No 4 that establish
the entire chain of corrupt payments. Furthermore, we have noted the
admissions of respondents No. 4 and No. 5 regarding the payments
made in 2005 to State Minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain in order to
get the GPSA as well as in 2003 to Mr. Salim Bhuyian for arranging
meetings for procurement of the JVA. The undisputed facts and the
undisputed documentary evidence is adequate for us to reach the
inevitable conclusion that the JVA and GPSA were procured by
corruption, through the set up of a corrupt scheme during the period
2003 to 2006, thus rendering the JVA and GPSA without law
authority and of no legal effect, i.e. void ab initio.378

The question whether, as the Respondents assert, Niko had built a
“scheme of corruption” is hotly disputed in the Arbitrations. In preparation
and during the Hearing, in their subsequent deliberations and in drafting
this decision, the Tribunals have spent great efforts and much time in
examining the relevant allegations and supporting evidence. They will
discuss the matter in detail below. One thing, however, can be said firmly
and immediately: the existence of a “scheme of corruption” is neither
admitted by the Claimant nor can it be accepted as an “undisputed fact’.

In a similar line, the Court refers to a passage in the Agreed Statement of
Facts, according to which Niko Canada provided “improper benefits to [the
State Minister] in order to further the business objectives of Niko Canada
and its subsidiaries” .379 In the Canadian proceedings the Canadian Court
had fixed the sanction in a Sentencing Agreement, considering that “the
company has never been convicted of a similar offence nor has it been
sanctioned by regulatory body for a similar offence”; and it had already
taken steps “to reduce the likelihood of it committing a subsequent related
offence”.38° The Canadian Court had noted that the “Crown is unable to
prove that any influence was obtained as a result of providing the benefits
to the Minister’ .38! Nevertheless, the High Court Division relies on the first
of these statements and concludes:

The preponderance of evidence of corruption leads us to conclude that
the assets of [Niko Canada] and its subsidiaries in Bangladesh,

378 Alam Judgment, paragraph 50.

379 Agreed Statement of Facts, Exhibit R-215, paragraph 2. When referring to this passage, the Court uses
the word “bribes” for “improper benefits”; the passage is taken from paragraph 2 of the Statement which
sets out the allegation.

obtained through the corrupt scheme in place from 2003 to 2006, are
to be treated as tainted by corruption and proceeds of crime. As such
all the assets of the subsidiaries of [Niko Canadaj, including the
assets and rights under the JVA, assets and rights under the GPSA
and assets and shareholding interests in Block 9 PSC are attached
and seized. These assets of [Niko] are being seized as proceeds of
crime as well as to provide compensation to the victims of the 2005
blowouts. 35?

When justifying its conclusions, the Court refers to

. the evidence of the trail of the corrupt payments uncovered by
several international law enforcing agencies working together, and
the contracts entered into by Niko which manifestly aim to facilitate
corruption of Bangladesh public officials.

and

The consultancy contracts are clear evidence that a corrupt scheme
was set up by which regular payments were being made by [Niko
Canada] to Bangladesh officials and politically influential people for
the business benefits of its subsidiaries in Bangladesh. 38+

The Tribunals note that, based on inconclusive or contested evidence, the
Court not only declares a Governmental act for void ab initio, as the Court
has powers to do according to Article 102, but goes further and declares
all assets of Niko in Bangladesh as “proceeds of crime”.

The Court goes yet a step further and makes a determination concerning
the liability for and the damage caused by the blowouts, issues that are
pending before the present Tribunals and also before a court in
Bangladesh in the Money Suit. In the Alam Judgment, the Court asserts:

The eventual blowouts and the destruction of two gas fields have
caused damages of over US$ 1 billion. Unfortunately, respondents No.
4 and No. 5 are yet to pay for their crimes committed about 14 years
ago. 385

The High Court Division extends its findings about corruption and the
“corrupt scheme” to the award of a 60% share in the Block 9 PSC gas
contract to a Niko company, with respect to which no specific corruption

allegations had been made. The Court did not examine the process by
which this share was awarded the Niko company. It merely noted that in
the Arthur Andersen report of 1997 Niko Canada had been ranked least
qualified. It added that Niko Canada “ended up with obtaining” these
rights and concluded that “the preponderance of evidence of corruption
leads us to the conclusion that but for the corrupt scheme in place [Niko
CanadajJ could not have obtained its exploration rights in Bangladesh’ .386

The High Court Division sees its function as imposing a penalty on the
Niko companies, preventing the Niko companies from using the assets of
which it ordered the seizure “to fund further bribery and corruption”. The
Court finds a “culture of corruption within the companies”; and it asserts
that the Niko companies “orchestrate crimes and then disperse and
conceal the proceeds of their illicit activities the world over’ .387

In view of these and other inflammatory statements in the Judgment
without citation of evidence, the Tribunals conclude that the High Court
Division, in contradiction with the confirmed principle concerning
evidence in Article 102 writ petitions, relied on factual assumptions far
beyond uncontested facts admitted by Niko.

The Claimant pointed out that the High Court Division “ventured far
beyond its competence” by making determinations concerning criminal
offences.388 The Tribunals indeed noted that the Court, as just pointed
out, applied “a penalty”; and it determined “proceeds of crime” and
ordered their seizure with the objective “to strip [Niko] of any benefits
obtained through corruption’ .389 The High Court Division thus ordered the
confiscation of Niko’s assets in Bangladesh.°9° It decided that these
assets must be

... seized, confiscated, and returned back to the state of Bangladesh,
the ultimate victim of the corruption. The aims of the confiscation are
to recover the proceeds of crime, return the assets to the State, deny

criminals the use of ill gotten assets and deter and disrupt further
criminality. 39!

The people and the state would be able to obtaining [sic] at least some
financial benefit or compensation from the scourge of the crime of
corruption committed by [Niko]. Hardship and suffering has been
inflicted by [Niko] on the citizens such as the victims of the 2005
blowouts. The return of the assets to the State would also help to
reimburse the State for the human and financial resources expended
in fighting and pursuing the corrupt activities of [Niko].39?

When studying the Parties’ submissions and the jurisprudence
concerning Article 102, the Tribunals have found no indication that, in
addition to determining that a Governmental act was done or proceedings
were taken “without lawful authority”, the Court had powers under Article
102 as those which the High Court Division exercised in the Alam
Judgment.

It appears therefore to the Tribunals that, both with respect to the factual
findings and the relief granted, the Alam Judgement goes beyond the
scope of the powers under Article 102, as it had been understood by the
Supreme Court in previous cases. These circumstances may affect the
relevance of the Court’s findings for the issues before the Tribunals.

6.4.5 The legal findings of the Alam Judgment and their relevance for
the Tribunals’ decision

When discussing the relevance of the Alam Judgment, the Respondents
refer to the contract provisions according to which the “validity,
interpretation and implementation” 93 of the Agreements shall be governed
by the laws of Bangladesh. They rely on Article 111 of the Bangladesh
Constitution providing:

The law declared by the Appellate Division shall be binding on the
High Court Division and the law declared by either division of the
Supreme Court shall be binding on all courts subordinate to it.

sentence is partly obscured and reconstituted by hand).

392 Alam Judgment, paragraph 82.

393 Article 13.1 and 15.1 of the JVA and the GPSA, respectively.

204

716. According to the Respondents, the High Court Division reached in the
Alam Judgment “a number of holdings of law that are part of the content
of the laws of Bangladesh and directly relevant to the decision of the
Tribunals on the Corruption Claim” .39* They assert that “judgments of the
Supreme Court of Bangladesh create binding precedent establishing and
explaining Bangladeshi law” .395

717. The Claimant asserts that the “Respondents fostered proceedings in local
court that purported to address the same topics submitted for decision in
these Tribunals” and did so in violation of the Tribunals’ Decision on
Exclusivity and Article 26 of the ICSID Convention. It considers the
Judgment as “fundamentally illegitimate” and describes the Judgment as

... issued by a court with no authority to resolve disputes of fact or to
hear more than summary evidence. The judgment’s disingenuous
assertions that disputed facts were undisputed and its leaps of logic
confirm its results-driven, partial approach. The Respondents assert
that the Writ Petition Judgment is persuasive authority. Review of the
document leads to the conclusion that it is neither persuasive nor an
authority legitimately considered in this forum.39

718. The Tribunals recognise the authority of the Supreme Court in the
interpretation of the laws of Bangladesh and accept, as asserted by the
Respondents, that the judgments of this Court are “directly relevant to
the decision of the Tribunals on the Corruption Claim” .397 As shown above
in Section 6.2, the Tribunals have carefully analysed the relevant
jurisprudence of this court.

719. When considering the Alam Judgment the Tribunals must, however, take
account of the specific circumstances of this judgment as just reviewed:
the Judgment was rendered in violation of the Tribunals’ exclusive
jurisdiction; it is founded on a very distorted representation of
“undisputed” facts, relying on highly disputed allegations and even
assumptions that have not even been alleged and that, as shown above
are wrong; it assumes powers which seem to go beyond the scope of
Article 102 and beyond what the Supreme Court decided in other cases;
it uses disturbing and inflammatory language to characterise factual

assertions which are plainly contradicted by the record; and it is subject
to appeal.

The Tribunals noted that the Alam Judgment seems to differ from earlier
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court on at least three points:

First, in the Alam Judgment the High Court Division concluded that
Article 102 applies to Governmental decisions “tainted by” corruption.
The Court states:

If the exercise of Executive powers is tainted by extraneous factors
such as personal benefits or gratifications, or procured through fraud
and corruption, then such actions are ultra vires and liable to be
declared to be done without lawful authority and of no legal effect, i.e.
void ab initio. Any contract arising from the ultra vires exercise of
Government power is liable to be declared void ab initio.398

The Parties have not relied on any prior decision of the Supreme Court in
which corruption led to a declaration of avoidance in Article 102
proceedings; and the Tribunals have not seen any such decision. Prior
decisions of the Supreme Court, in particular the “mala fide” preparation
of the report in the Television case and deficiencies in the approval
process of the Container Terminals case indicate the type of irregularities
that are taken by the Court to fall within the scope of acts taken “without
legal authorities”. The Tribunals have concluded above in Section 6.2.3
that the extension of Article 102 case law to corruption is justified and in
line with the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court.

Second, when examining the question whether the exercise of
Governmental powers was “tainted by corruption”, the Court did not
consider merely the decision itself, but referred to a whole series of steps
prior to the final approval of the JVA, including the result of prior tender
proceedings for a contract different from the JVA, the decision on the
scope of the JVA, including Chattak East and the decision not to apply
competitive procedures in the form of Swiss Challenge. The Court also
relied, as discussed above, on a scheme of layered consultancy contracts.

While the factual assumptions on which this reasoning is based are
seriously flawed and in a number of respects seem to exceed the limits

398 Alam Judgment, paragraph 43.

206

725.

726.

727.

728.

729.

on the Supreme Court in Article 102 proceedings, what is of relevance
here is the legal principle of extending the examination beyond the sole
act of approval.

The Tribunals have noted that in prior decisions, in particular in the
Television and the Container Terminals cases, the Supreme Court
considered not just the final decision, granting the license or authorising
the contract; the Court also considered the process leading to this
decision. For instance, it considered the “process followed for selecting
the ETV as most responsive”399 and the “process that has been adopted in
the matter of approval of the project” .40°

The Tribunals conclude that the examination by the High Court Division
of steps prior to the Governmental approval of the JVA and the GSPA is
in line with the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court. When determining
whether acts or proceedings have been done or taken with lawful
authority, the examination need not be limited to the act itself; in the
opinion of the Tribunals the examination may be extended to the
preceding steps leading to the act.

The third point of legal principles which the Tribunals note concerns
causation. The High Court Division states

There is no need to show, as [Niko] argues that the bribes paid to State
Minister AKM Mosharaf Hossain actually influenced his decision to
act in favour of Niko.4°1

This assertion by the Court is based on the definition of bribery in section
161 of the Bangladesh Penal Code. The Court finds that, under that
provision, actual influence is not necessary.

The Claimant objects:

a Court acting under Article 102 of the Constitution has no
jurisdiction to make determinations regarding offences allegedly
committed by a private party under the Bangladesh Penal Code.4°?

734.

Indeed, decisions taken under Article 102 of the Constitution are not by
way of application of the Penal Code. The purpose of Article 102 is not
the punishment of a bribe giver but the regularity of the Governmental
act (see Section 6.2 above). What must be considered, therefore, is that
act and the process leading to it. If these are not influenced by corruption,
there is no basis for declaring, according to Article 102, that the act is
done “without lawful authority”.

Elsewhere in the Judgment, the High Court Division uses language which
is in contradiction with the statement quoted above and which does
indeed confirm that a link of causation must exist. For instance:

If the exercise of Executive powers is tainted by extraneous factors
such as personal benefits or gratifications, or procured through fraud
and corruption, then such actions are ultra vires and liable to be
declared to be done without lawful authority and of no legal effect, i.e.
void ab initio. 49%

The point was made in equally clear terms when the Court defined the
function of the process:

The point for adjudication in the instant writ petition is whether during
the period 2003 to 2006 the respondent No. 4 and No. 5 had set upa
corrupt scheme for obtaining benefits from the Government of
Bangladesh and was able to procure the Joint Venture Agreement
(JVA) and the Sale Agreement for the Sale of Gas from Feni Gas Field
(GPSA) through corrupt and fraudulent means.1°*

This is indeed the understanding of Article 102 that the Tribunals had
found when examining the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court. The
Governmental act considered is “procured through corrupt and fraudulent
means”; the act is “tainted” or otherwise affected by the extraneous
factors, as those given as examples.

This clearly requires causation. In the absence of any influence of such
extraneous factors, there is no basis for declaring the act as “without
lawful authority” according to the procedure under Article 102.

The remedies under the Contract Act

Both Parties also rely on the Contract Act;4° they differ however with
respect to the identification of the relevant sections.

6.5.1 The positions of the Parties

When they initiated the present Corruption Claim in BAPEX’s Memorial
on Damages, BAPEX argued that Niko should be prevented from
“accessing the international arbitration system” and that “public policy
requires that rights obtained by bribery be unenforceable” .*°® It continued
by stating:

In addition to the international condemnation of corruption,
Bangladeshi law, like English law, provides that agreements
obtained by bribery are voidable.4°”

BAPEX added:

On the facts of this case, the JVA is voidable according to the
Bangladeshi Contract Act because BAPEX’s consent was procured by
“coercion”, “fraud” and “misrepresentation”. Any of these alone is
sufficient to render the contract voidable. Courts in Bangladesh can
declare a contract void in circumstances like these.**

The text refers to Sections 15, 17 and 18 of the Contract Act, respectively,
for the definition of each of the three quoted terms and to Section 19 for
the conclusion that in the circumstances a contract is voidable. BAPEX
then concluded:

BAPEX therefore exercises its right to hold the JVA void and requests
that the Tribunal treat the JVA as voided as a result of Niko’s bribery
and dismiss all of Niko’s claims |[...] Voiding the agreements results in
there being no substantive provision to support Niko’s claims.*°9

On the same date, 25 March 2016, Petrobangla wrote to the Tribunals
referring to BAPEX Memorial on Damages and informed the Tribunals
that

405 The Contract Act has been produced as Exhibit CLA-4.
406 BMD, paragraphs 62, 63.

407 B-MD, paragraph 68.

408 B-MD, paragraph 69.

409 B-MD, paragraph 71.

209

739.

740.

741.

742.

743.

Petrobangla approves of and adopts BAPEX’s recitation of the facts
and legal consequences of Niko’s use of corruption and bribes to
obtain the JVA and the PSA.

In light of those facts and legal consequences, Petrobangla requests
that the Tribunal find that the GPSA was procured by corruption and
is thus voidable. It further informs the Tribunal of it decision to rescind
the GPSA.

In this original version of the Respondents’ claim there is no reference to
Article 102 of the Constitution.

In subsequent submissions, the Respondents seek a declaration that
the agreements were void ab initio based on Article 102 of the
Constitution, as discussed above. Alternatively, they rely on the Contract
Act, but no longer on Sections 15 to 19 of the Contract Act but on Section
23, which defines the circumstances in which an agreement is void.

The Claimant takes the position that the Contract Act is the correct
reference for determining whether an agreement is void or voidable. In
the Contract Act the relevant provision is Section 19 together with Section
15, providing that a contract is voidable if it was caused by “coercion”, a
term that, in the understanding of both Parties, includes corruption. It
denies the applicability of Section 23, since neither the “consideration”
nor the “object” of either Agreement is unlawful.

6.5.2 The relevant provisions

The Contract Act deals in Sections 15 to 19 with agreements “without free
consent’. Section 19 of the Contract Act reads as follows:

When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion, fraud or
misrepresentation, the agreement is a contract voidable at the option
of the party whose consent was so caused.

Coercion, fraud and misrepresentation are defined in Sections 15, 17 and
18, respectively. The Parties agree that the relevant definition is that of
coercion, defined in Section 15 which provides:

"Coercion" is the committing, or threatening to commit, any act
forbidden by the Penal Code or the unlawful detaining or threatening

210

to detain, any property, to the prejudice of any person whatever, with
the intention of causing any person to enter into an agreement.

744. Section 23 of the Contract Act,4!° on which the Respondents rely in
their later submissions, has the following wording:

The consideration or object of an agreement is lawful, unless- it is
forbidden by law; or

is of such a nature that, if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of
any law; or

is fraudulent; or

involves or implies injury to the person or property of another; or the
Court regards it as immoral, or opposed to public policy.

In each of these cases, the consideration or object of an agreement is
said to be unlawful. Every agreement of which the object or
consideration is unlawful is void.

745. The provisions of the Penal Code‘*!! on which the Parties rely*+!? are
Sections 161:

Whoever, being or expecting to be a public servant, accepts or
obtains, or agrees to accept, or attempts to obtain from any person,
for himself or for any other person any gratification whatever, other
than legal remuneration, as a motive or reward for doing or forbearing
to do any official act or for showing or for bearing to show, in the
exercise of his official functions, favour or disfavour to any person, or
for rendering or attempting to render any service or disservice to any
person, with the Government or Legislature, or with any public
servant, as such, shall be punished with imprisonment of either
description for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine,
or with both.

and Section 165 A

Whoever abets any offence punishable under section 161 or section
165 shall, whether the offence abetted is or is not committed in
consequence of the abetment, be punished with the punishment
provided for the offence.

6.5.3 Applicability of Section 23 Contract Act

746. In the Decision on Jurisdiction the Tribunals already considered the
legality of the two Agreements. They concluded:

In the present case, the agreements on which the claims are based
have as their object the development of marginal/abandoned gas
fields and the sale of gas from such fields. It has not been argued
that there is anything illegal about the object and the content of these
contracts. The Tribunal has not been made aware of any such
illegality. The reasons which lead to the unenforceability of contracts
for corruption do not apply to the agreements considered in the
present case.*13

747. The Respondents recognise that the “objects of the JVA and GPSA (the
exploitation of gas fields and the sale of gas) are, on the face of the
agreements, lawful.”*!4 They argue, however, that

the agreements are void under Section 23 because, due to an external
factor (Niko’s procurement of the authorization of the Ministry and the
Prime Minister’s office by illegal influence and bribery), they: 1)
amount to fraud perpetrated on the people of Bangladesh, 2) defeat
the provisions of the Penal Code prohibiting influence on and bribery
of public officials, among others, 3) injure the property of the people of
Bangladesh by unlawfully transferring the economic benefits of their
property to Niko, and 4) are opposed to Bangladeshi and international
public policy because they give effect to decisions of public officials
influenced by corruption.*!5

748. The Respondents argue that the “JVA and GPSA validate and implement
the illegal acts of Niko and the officials they bribed’ .*!© They seek to bring
this situation in the ambit of Section 23 by asserting that a contract
lawful on its face “will be void under Section 23 if the contract or its
enforcement is contrary to public policy”.*!7 In support of this assertion,

the Respondents refer to one of the examples given at Section 12 in the
published text of the Contract Act:

A, being agent for a landed proprietor, agrees for money, without the
knowledge of his principal, to obtain for B a lease of land belonging
to his principal. The agreement between A and B is void, as it implies
a fraud by concealment by A, on his principal.*'8

In the view of the Respondents, the example shows that an agreement
with an object and consideration entirely legal (the lease of the land and
the payment of money) is nevertheless void “due to an external factor (the
agent’s fraud on the land owner}’.*!9 The example was discussed at the
Hearing, as a result of which it became clear that the Respondents’
argument confuses two agreements: the valid lease agreement and the
agreement between A and B which had the object to defraud the landed
proprietor. 42°

In their First Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondents nevertheless continue
to argue that Niko’s conduct must be considered not under Section 19 of
the Contract Act but under Section 23. They argue:

Niko’s bribes did more than compromise Respondents’ free consent:
they illegally procured the approval of the Government and the grant
of rights to public goods [...] this contravenes Bangladesh public policy
and the case law of the Supreme Court [...] As the Supreme Court of
Bangladesh has declared, citing English law, ‘a public body [can]not
act incompatibly with the exercise of its powers or the discharge of its
duties’.4?1

Relying on the terms of Section 23 the Respondents argue that the
Agreements

... defeat a number of Bangladeshi laws, including the provisions
against bribery in the Penal Code, the Constitution, and the case law
dealing with grant of government largess, and the objects of the
Agreements are not simply the exploitation of gas fields and gas sale,

418 R-RC, paragraph 353, quoting example (g) to Section 23 of the Contract Act.

419 R-RC, 353; the Respondents describe as “external factor’ at paragraph 354 and Footnote 610, a number
of situations which they also invoke in the context of Article 102 of the Constitution and which have been
considered above.

rather, the implementation of an unlawful Government grant of rights
to Niko. Accordingly, the object is unlawful and opposed to public
policy.*??

The Claimant objected to the earlier justifications for the Respondents’
theory concerning Section 23. To the revised version of this theory
presented in Respondents’ First Post-Hearing Brief, the Claimant
responds by describing it as a “novel theory, and a creative one”, and
continued by asserting:

. nothing in the language of the JVA or GPSA suggests a grant of
governmental authority to Niko. Rather, the grant of rights was from
the Government and Petrobangla to BAPEX. Furthermore,
Bangladeshi law generally follows English law. As explained before,
English law treats a contract obtained by corruption as voidable,
while a contract whose object is illegal would be void.4?3

The Tribunals have noted that the Contract Act makes a clear distinction
between the object and consideration of a contract and the situations in
which the “free consent” of the agreement is affected. The examples given
in the Contract Act for cases of Section 23 clearly show that for cases
covered by Section 23 the determining factor is the “object or
consideration”, i.e. the purpose of the performance of the agreement.
Section 19 is concerned with the manner in which the agreement came
about. This distinction corresponds to that between contracts of
corruption and contracts obtained by corruption, as the Tribunals have
explained in the Decision on Jurisdiction.

The Tribunals have pointed out previously that there is nothing in the
JVA and the GPSA which is illegal.424 If the approval of the agreements
by the Government were caused by corruption, such a finding would
relate to the manner in which the Agreements were formed and not to
their terms. Indeed, the Respondents question how the Agreements came
about: with respect to the JVA the Respondents say that it should have
been awarded following the Swiss Challenge procedure; and Chattak East
should have been treated as an exploration target and treated according
to the PSC procedure. Had these procedures been used, and no
corruption occurred, there would be no issue with the performance of the
Agreements.

422 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 263.
423 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraphs 144 and 145.
424 See e.g. Decision on Jurisdiction, paragraph 438.

214

755.

756.

757.

758.

The Tribunals therefore see no basis for applying Section 23 of the
Contract Act when determining the legal consequences of the alleged
corruption. They find confirmation in this conclusion by the
Respondents’ own argument: when the Respondents first raised the
corruption issue, they did not argue that the Agreements were void. Even
after they had changed counsel and initiated the Corruption Claim in its
present form, the Respondents still argued that the Agreements were
voidable and declared avoidance. It was only in subsequent submissions
that they introduced the new theory, based on Article 102 of the
Constitution and, alternatively, Section 23 of the Contract Act.

For the reasons stated, the Tribunals are unable to follow the
Respondents in their change of the legal basis for their claim with respect
to the Contract Act. The Tribunals conclude that allegations of
corruption in the procurement of the JVA and the GPSA must be
considered under Sections 19 and 15 of the Contract Act and not
under Section 23.

6.5.4 Lobbyists and the “exercise of personal influence” (Section 163 of
the Penal Code

 

Section 19 of the Contract Act applies in cases where the consent to an
agreement is caused by “coercion, fraud or misrepresentation”. The Parties
agree that this includes consent caused by corruption.

The definition of “coercion” in Section 15 Contract Act includes “any act
forbidden by the Penal Code”. The Respondents include in such
forbidden acts not only Section 161 (accepting bribes) and 165 A
(abetting) of the Bangladesh Penal Code, but also Section 163.425 This
Section concerns specifically the “exercise of personal influence” and has
the marginal note: “Taking gratification for exercise of personal influence
with public servant’. It reads as follows:

Whoever accepts or obtains, or agrees to accept or attempts to obtain,
from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification
whatever, as a motive or reward for inducing, by the exercise of
personal influence, any public servant to do or to forbear to do any
official act, or in the exercise of the official functions of such public

425 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 149.

215

servant to show favour or disfavour to any person, or to render or
attempt to render any service or disservice to any person with the
Government or Legislature, or with any public servant, as such, shall
be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend
to one year, or with fine, or with both.426

759. When arguing that Section 163 of the Penal Code applies to lobbying
practices by consultants the Respondents refer to statements made by
the Claimant in its Rejoinder:

... Niko has now admitted that it engaged Mr. Bhuiyan to exercise
personal influence over State Minister AKM Mosharraf Hossain to gain
his favor and obtain the JVA. To avoid the consequences of admitting
to criminal conduct in violation of Section 163 of the Penal Code in
establishing its investment, Niko argues that “Respondents’
suggestion that the engagement of local consultants was illegal is
flatly contradicted by the widely prevailing practice” of using “local
consultants to perform logistical and lobbying services.” The
prevalence of criminal conduct does not make it lawful. Engaging
“consultants” to commit acts that violate the Penal Code is a crime.
Respondents have established, and Niko has not rebutted, that in
Bangladesh, as elsewhere, “consultants” are often used to commit
criminal acts of corruption. One of the consultants used by Niko, Mr.
Mamoon, was convicted of “corruption being backed by political
influence” for assisting Mr. Rahman “obtain [...] dirty money in the
name of [a] ‘consultation fee’” paid to Mr. Mamoon.*?7

760. The Respondents also referred to Section 163 in the context of their
challenge to the Tribunals’ jurisdiction on grounds that the Agreements
were obtained in violation of Bangladeshi law.428 The Tribunals have
dismissed this challenge; they nevertheless take account of these
arguments in the present context to the extent they also apply to the
discussion about the validity of the Agreements.

761. The Claimant denies that Section 163 of the Penal Code is applicable
here. In particular it denies that its consultants exercised “personal
influence” as it is punished by Section 163. It argues that

Lobbyists do not “inducfe]” by personal influence but simply

access to decision-makers in order to enable reasonable commercial
discourse and dialogue, but do not ‘exercise personal influence’ over
them. Rather they act in a professional capacity to represent and
defend their client’s interest, just as lawyers do.4?9

By this reference to the activity of lawyers, the Claimant seeks to
establish a link to the illustration which follows the text of Section 163:

Illustration

An advocate who receives a fee for arguing a case before a Judge; a
person who receives pay for arranging and correcting a memorial
addressed to Government, setting forth the services and claims of the
memorialist; a paid agent for a condemned criminal, who lays before
the Government statements tending to show that the condemnation
was unjust, - are not within this section, inasmuch as they do not
exercise or profess to exercise personal influence.*3°

The Claimant points out that the term “personal influence” is not defined
in the Penal Code and there are no cases in which it was applied. The
Claimant finds assistance in the Contract Act which uses the term
“undue influence”.*3! According to Section 14 of that act, consent is not
free when it is caused by “undue influence”. This term is defined in
Sections 16 of the Contract Act which provides:

A contract is said to be induced by ‘undue influence’ where the
relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the
parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that
position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other. 45?

Both Section 163 of the Penal Code and Sections 14 and 16 of the
Contract Act relate to interventions that affect the formation of the will
and resulting decisions; insofar they are comparable. The term
“influence” is, however, qualified by different expressions, the two
provisions relate to different circumstances and, in particular, they seek
to protect different values. The provision in the Contract Act protects a
person against being bound by a commitment in the absence of free
consent. Section 163 of the Penal Code seeks to protect the formation of
decision by public servants in the interest of public administration. The
Tribunals therefore find the reference to the term “undue influence” in the

Contract Act of limited value in their search of the correct understanding
of the term “personal influence” in Section 163.

The Parties have not provided any cases decided by courts in Bangladesh
applying Section 163 of the Penal Code. The Claimant has stated that
there is no reported case on Section 163.433 The Respondents refer to a
case; but that case relates to the Money Laundering Protirodh Ain
2002454 and not to Section 163. The latter provision is mentioned only in
passing as part of the argument of one of the appellants, distinguishing
it from the Ain 2002.435 Otherwise, the Respondents have not provided
any case in which Section 163 has been applied, nor have they provided
scholarly writing on the meaning of the term considered.

The Tribunals have found some assistance in the examples provided in
the Illustration to Section 163, published with the code and quoted
above. The three examples given in the illustration all concern situations
in which persons are paid for their efforts to influence a decision: the
advocate is paid for seeking to influence the judge; the memorial writer
is paid to influence the Government and the agent is paid for an effort to
influence the Government to decide that the condemned criminal is
innocent. The illustration makes it clear that payment for seeking to
influence in such circumstances is legal and is not subject to the
punishment under Section 163.

The illustration to Section 163 of the Penal Code gives examples for the
influence which is not an exercise of “personal influence”. It does not
provide guidance for understanding when and under what circumstances
the exercise of influence becomes “personal’ and punishable. The
Respondents nevertheless assert

. under Bangladeshi law, it is illegal even to pay someone, such as
an on-the-ground consultant, to exercise personal influence on a
public official, whether a bribe is paid or not.436

When making this assertion, the Respondents do not explain how the
exercise of influence by an advocate arguing a case before a judge

(admissible, according to the Illustration) should differ from the influence
of a lobbyist presenting to a public servant the advantages of desired
Governmental action.

In the absence of any other explanation, it appears to the Tribunals that
the difference must lie in the qualification “personal’. Section 163 applies
to the case where a person accepts a gratification for inducing a public
person to do or forbear an official act “by the exercise of personal
influence” as opposed to the presentation of facts and analyses which are
proper elements of the public person’s decision-making in the public
interest. The critical element, thus, is not the intention to influence the
public person as such but the use of personal connections
(characteristically deployed under a cloak of secrecy) in order to affect an
official act. In other words, Section 163 does not punish any case in
which a person is engaged to exercise influence on a public servant; the
act becomes criminal when it is the objective of the engagement to achieve
the result through “personal influence’.

The Respondents’ argument based on Section 163 thus is of no
assistance in the absence of any demonstration showing that the
influence exercised by lobbyists must be characterised as “personal
influence” and that the lobbyists are engaged to achieve the objective
through such personal influence.

The term “personal” generally is understood as relating to a particular
person, a_ specific individual. “Personal influence” may thus be
understood as referring to a relationship between the public servant and
the individual who seeks to exercise influence. Exercising personal
influence thus would mean seeking to influence the act of the public
servant, not by argument before the judge or presenting claims to the
Government in a memorial, but by relying on the personal relationship
between that individual and the public servant.

This understanding finds support in the Illustration to Section 164 of the
Penal Code. This provision concerns abetment of the offence of Section
163 by a public servant. In the example given, the wife of a public servant
is given a present in order to solicit from her husband a favour for a third
person. It is obviously the personal relationship of the wife with the public
servant which is the critical element in the example.

219

773.

774.

775.

776.

In the light of these considerations, the Tribunals conclude that it is the
reliance on a personal relationship of the person engaged to provide the
service with the public servant which is critical for the application of
Section 163. It is, thus, not any engagement of a lobbyist that falls under
the sanction of Section 163. The sanction applies only if the lobbyist is
engaged to induce the public servant, not by the strength of his or her
argument (as e.g. the advocate before the judge) but — to repeat -- by
relying on the personal relationship with the public servant.

This understanding of Section 163 reconciles this provision of the
Bangladeshi Penal Code with general international practice. As the
Claimant explained, lobbyists “act in a professional capacity to represent
and defend their client’s interests, just as lawyers do”.*37 It would be most
surprising if the legislator in Bangladesh had intended a general
“prohibition in Bangladeshi law against consultancy agreements with
private citizens to influence Government officials”, as alleged by the
Respondents. #38

Indeed, when Mr Chowdhury was asked about Mr Sharif coming to the
Ministry to “brief [him] further’ on the matter concerning the proposal
considered by BAPEX and Petrobangla, he said: “There was nothing
wrong. I found nothing wrong.”*°9 In other words, the most senior public
servant in the Ministry at the time found nothing wrong with Mr Sharif
briefing him on the Niko Proposal. As long as Mr Sharif did not use
“personal influence” to promote the Niko project, there was indeed
“nothing wrong’ and no conflict with Section 163 of the Penal Code, as
the Tribunals understand this provision.

The Tribunals conclude that Section 163 Penal Code does not prohibit
the engagement of lobbyists in general. The sanction applies only if the
lobbyist is engaged to promote the principal’s interests by relying on a
personal relationship with the public servant.

6.5.5 Causation in the application of Section 19 of the Contract Act

The Respondents do not discuss causation in the specific context of
Section 19 of the Contract Act. Indeed, they reproach the Claimant for its
“myopic application of the Contract Act, as opposed to Article 102 or
international law” and, in the context of the Contract Act, they refer to
Section 23.440

The Respondents do, however, discuss causation in the broader context
of their Corruption Claim. In particular, they object to the Claimant’s
argument that “proximate causation” is required:

... there is no requirement to prove proximate causation as part of a
corruption claim. Niko insists that corruption must be shown to be the
“immediate” cause of the signing of the Agreements.

While Respondents do not agree that proving causation is necessary,
even if it is, it is certainly not causation of the kind Claimant
advocates. At most what is required is a “link between the advantage
bestowed and the improper advantage obtained,” not immediate
causation. In noting the importance of a link, the Sistem tribunal
highlighted the absence of any suggestion of a “plausible explanation
[...] as to how the” alleged bribe “could be linked to any improper
advantage,” and therefore denied the corruption claim.44!

The Claimant insists that causation must be proven.*#? It asserts:

... the causal link between the alleged bribe and the signing of the
contracts is central to a finding of corruption. If no advantage is
obtained the causal link is absent.4*5

The Claimant continues by referring to the Spentex award, where the
arbitral tribunal insisted on the causal link, looking at international
instruments, specifically to the 1997 OECD Anti-Bribery Convention and
the 2003 UN Convention against Corruption. It concludes

In other words, the alleged bribe must be shown to have been made
with specific regard to the official acting (or refraining from acting) to
procure business advantage.**+

The Tribunals do not exclude that, under the laws of Bangladesh and
other countries, criminal sanctions for corruption may be applied in all
cases in which a bribe is paid to a public official, whether this bribe
produces the desired effect or not. The Tribunals, as pointed out
repeatedly, are not a criminal court. Here they consider the application
of Section 19 of the Contract Act, which, in its clear wording requires
causation:

When consent to an agreement is caused by coercion [including “any
act forbidden by the Penal Code”), fraud or misrepresentation, the
agreement is a contract voidable at the option of the party whose
consent was so caused.

The Respondents have asserted that causation need not be “proximate”;
but they have not argued that causation was required at all. They also
failed to show the basis for the distinction concerning “proximate cause”
in Bangladeshi law and how it would be applied in the context of Section
19 to corruption affecting the consent.

The Tribunals conclude that, when seeking to avoid the Agreements
under the Contract Act, the Respondents must show that the Agreements
were caused by corruption. The question whether there is a requirement
to show that the bribe also procured an undue benefit to the bribe giver
is an issue to be considered separately.

7 THE EVIDENCE - QUESTIONS OF PRINCIPLE

7.1 The burden of proof and how it can be shifted

784.

785.

The Respondents seek relief by reason of Niko’s alleged corruption. They
bear the burden of proof for the allegation and do not contest this. The
Parties differ with respect to the facts that have to be proven, a question
that has been considered in the preceding section. The issue here
concerns the question which party must prove the alleged facts.

The Respondents argue that they have established all facts necessary
for their claim and thus have met their burden of proof. In any event,
they argue that they have provided prima facie evidence sufficient to shift
the burden of proof to the Claimant. The Respondents assert:

... Respondents have discharged their burden of proof, under any
standard, to show the elements of each of its [sic] claims. Niko put on
no evidence to rebut the relevant facts, and its counsel, when asked
directly at the hearing, could not deny its use of consultants to
channel money to officials. [...] Niko can only prevail if it presents more
persuasive rebuttal evidence. It has not.

Further, on matters for which any doubt might remain, Niko’s burden
results from the rule that, when a party bearing the legal burden of
proof “adduces evidence that prima facie supports its allegation, the
[evidentiary] burden of proof may be shifted to the other [pjarty.” Niko
has not provided an adequate rebuttal of Respondents’ evidence that
prima facie shows Niko engaged in corrupt activities to establish its
investment and secure the JVA and GPSA. Niko’s “f[ailure] [...] to
throw sufficient doubt on the [...] factual premises [...]” upon which
Respondents corruption claim is based is fatal to its defense.445

and Rompetrol v. Romania, ICSID Case No ARB/10/3, 4 October 2013, RLA-157, paragraph 246. The
Respondents’ argument concerning the burden of proof and the shift of it is also developed in earlier
submissions, e.g. R-RC paragraph 62 et seg.; R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 78 et seq.

223

786.

787.

788.

The Claimant denies that the Respondents have proven the corruption
allegations and that there is any basis for shifting the burden of proof to
Niko to ‘disprove’ the corruption allegations.*#© The Claimant

... denies having made any payment to any government official and
the record shows no payment (or promise of payment) from Niko (or
anyone associated with Niko) to any government official. 44”

Concerning the shift of the burden of proof, the Claimant does not deny
the principle but asserts that “there is no automatic shifting of the burden
of proof’*48 and objects to the Respondents’ assertion that “certain classic
‘red flags’ of corruption can suffice to shift the burden onto the party
denying its existence”.4+9 The Claimant accepts that “the presence of red
flags indicates that a transaction merits particular scrutiny”.*5° It adds
that “red flags, by themselves, are not evidence of corruption” and quotes
from the Kim v. Uzbekistan Decision on Jurisdiction:

Respondent has not established that red flags can of themselves
substantiate the most basic requirements of the crime of bribe giving
[to government officials] as set forth in Article 211 [of the Uzbek
Criminal Code].451

In support of its position concerning the shifting of the burden of proof,
the Claimant refers to explanations in two cases. In Feldman v. Mexico,
the ICSID Tribunal stated:

[VJarious international tribunals, including the International Court of
Justice, have generally and consistently accepted and applied the
rule that the party who asserts a fact, whether the claimant or
respondent, is responsible for providing proof thereof. Also, it is a
generally accepted canon of evidence in civil law, common law and,
in fact, most jurisdictions, that the burden of proof rests upon the
party, whether complaining or defending, who asserts the affirmative
of a claim or defence. If that party adduces evidence sufficient to raise
a presumption that what is claimed is true, the burden then shifts to

224

the other party, who will fail unless it adduces sufficient evidence to
rebut the presumption.*52

789. The Claimant also quotes from Thunderbird v. Mexico:

The Tribunal shall apply the well-established principle that the party
alleging a violation of international law giving rise to international
responsibility has the burden of proving its assertion. If said Party
adduces evidence that prima facie supports its allegation, the burden
of proof may be shifted to the other Party, if the circumstances so

justify. 49

790. With respect to the principle, the Parties do not seem to disagree. Indeed,
the Respondents summarise the Claimant’s position as follows:

1. “the party alleging corruption must prove it;”

2. “a distinction exists between the legal burden of proof (which
never shifts) and the evidential burden of proof (which can shift from
one party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence);” and

3. if the party bearing the legal burden of proof “adduces evidence
that prima facie supports its allegation, the [evidentiary] burden of
proof may be shifted to the other Party.”45+

791. The Respondents conclude by stating their agreement with these
principles.*55 They disagree, however, on the evidentiary value of the red
flags presented by the Respondents. They present a list of red flags and
add:

The jurisprudence plainly indicates that such “red flags” are not to be
taken lightly, and tribunals have frequently ruled against claimants
after they failed to produce evidence sufficient to rebut a presumption
of illegality that arises from them.*°®

792. The Claimant disagrees with the asserted frequency about the decisions
on which the Respondents rely. It quotes a learned study:

ICSID tribunals ... have affirmed that the burden of proof may shift in
a variety of contexts, although no ICSID tribunal has yet done so in
the context of alleged corruption.*°”

793. Concerning the issue of “red flags”, the Respondents list among red flags
for corruption situations in which the “commission or fee seems
disproportionate in relation to the services to be rendered’.*5® They refer
to the Metal-Tech award, where the tribunal noted that the consultants
had been paid about US$4 million and enquired “What service was the
payment intended to remunerate? When was this service rendered?” 459
That tribunal did so in order to give the claimant “an opportunity to
substantiate the reality and legitimacy of the services for which payments
were made” .+60

794. The Respondents deny that in the present case, as in Metal-Tech, the
Claimant was able to provide the required substantiation. They assert
that “certain classic ‘red flags’ of corruption can suffice to shift the burden
onto the party denying its existence”.*°! They refer in particular to the
Spentex v. Uzbekistan award, referring to it as “the most recent award
addressing the issue of red flags [in which] an ICSID tribunal found that
the red flag of large payments to consultants was alone sufficient proof of
corruption” .462

795. The Claimant objects and argues that “there is no automatic shifting of
the burden of proof’ ,*® pointing out that the Spentex award has not been

published and its content is available only in a news report. The Claimant
qualifies the Respondents’ quotation by reference to a passage indicating
that the Spentex tribunal adopted a “nuanced approach capable of taking
into account all of the relevant circumstances in relation to the allegations
of corruption” and distinguishing the facts of the Spentex case from those
of the present case.*+6+

The Tribunals conclude that the difference between the Parties
concerning the burden of proof and the question whether it has been
shifted in the present case is not an issue of principle which can be
decided in the abstract. The Respondents assert that they have proven
corruption; but if the Tribunals are not persuaded by the evidence
produced, the Respondents rely on a number of circumstances (or red
flags) which in their opinion justify a presumption of corruption which
the Claimant must rebut in order to prevail.

The Tribunals must therefore examine whether (i) the circumstances on
which the Respondents rely as red flags are established and, if so, (ii)
what evidentiary conclusions should be drawn from them, taken
individually and collectively. In this process, the Tribunals will also have
to consider circumstances which point in the opposite direction.

This examination and its conclusions will be presented below in Section
8.

The standard of proof

The Claimant argues that the nature of corruption allegations requires
that a heightened standard be applied. The Respondents argue the
ordinary standard must apply and that this is the “preponderance of
evidence” 465

As part of the questions addressed to the Parties, the Tribunals had
asked:

15. Standard of proof in case of corruption allegations: when
determining the standard of proof for allegations that agreements

464 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 106 et seq.
465 See R-RC, paragraphs 74 et seq.

227

were procured by corruption, what allowance must be made for (a)
possible efforts of concealing the corruption activity and resulting
difficulties to prove corruption and causation and (b) the gravity of
any finding of corruption for the persons concerned?

801. The Claimant discussed a number of decisions and legal writings and
concluded:

...because corruption is a serious allegation which can attract drastic
legal consequences, these Tribunals must have a high degree of
confidence in the evidence put before them and its probative
weight. 167

802. The Respondents discussed these decisions and legal writings and
asserted that the “normal standard of proof’ is that of the “preponderance
of the evidence”. They concluded that there is no established rule
requiring a higher standard and “the consequences of a finding of
corruption are no greater than the consequences of many other findings in
international arbitration” .468 They added:

Respondents do not suggest they “need not” prove their case; they
maintain that the standard of proof is the preponderance of the
evidence. Yet, they do insist that the clandestine nature of corruption
and strong international public policy against it must animate the
Tribunals’ approach to fact-finding in this case and militate against
requiring a higher standard of proof.4°?

803. Having examined the Parties’ argument and the many learned
publications and arbitral decisions on which they rely, the Tribunals find
it difficult to identify an invariable rule on the standard of proof:

804. The Tribunals have pointed out repeatedly that they are not a criminal
court; their findings on corruption thus do not necessarily require
application of the exacting standards of proof that justify criminal
sanction. The civil sanctions which they may apply are nevertheless also
serious and likely to have far reaching effects for all concerned. They are
also aware of the difficulties of proving corruption in a case as the present
one:

406 See above, Section 2.4.15, Question 15.

467 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 208.

468 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 90 and R-,MC, paragraph 164.
469 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 94.

228

e where there is neither direct evidence of a corrupt payment nor
an uncontested admission;

e which has been the object of a vast investigation by authorities
in Bangladesh, Canada and the U.S. leading to allegations of
corruption,

e where the allegations are based on a number of indicia creating
a situation in which the prevalence of concordant circumstantial
evidence may possibly become, as the Tribunals stated at the
Hearing, “so dense that we say we must assume that, despite the
denial, we accept corruption to have occurred’ ;47°

e where the the evidence gathered in the joint international
investigation has led only to a limited criminal sanctions against
Niko and its representatives, a sanction which the Tribunals have
already considered in their Decision on Jurisdiction.

805. In this complex situation of facts and allegations, the Tribunals do not
find much assistance in terms such as “preponderance of evidence” and
“heightened standard of proof’.

806. In the end the question is whether the Tribunals are persuaded that the
JVA and GPSA were procured by corruption or not. The Tribunals share
the conclusion reached by Aloysius Llamzon in his comprehensive
monograph devoted to the legal doctrine and cases concerning corruption
in international investment arbitration, to which the Parties have
frequently referred:

the less formalistic sensibility of Rompetrol and Metal-Tech
towards the evidentiary rules to be applied to corruption issues is
helpful. Because corruption is a serious charge with serious
consequences attached, the degree of confidence a tribunal should
have in the evidence of that corruption must be high. However, this
does not mean that the standard of proof itself should necessarily be
higher, or that circumstantial evidence, inferences, or presumptions
and indicators of possible corruption (such as ‘red flags’) cannot come
to the aid of the fact-finder. Tribunals are given the freedom and

burden of choice, which they should not abdicate by rote reference to
an abstract ‘heightened’ standard of proof.47!

8 THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE IN THE ARBITRATIONS

807.

808.

809.

810.

One of the particular features of the Corruption Claim proceedings is the
broad scope and large volume of the evidence presented and said to be
relevant to the alleged corruption.

803. When the Respondents initiated their Corruption Claim on 25 March
2016, the Tribunals decided to examine this claim with priority and to
take an active role in the gathering of the evidence. Despite initiating this
Claim, the Respondents pointed out that:

ICSID tribunals are not well suited to this type of investigation. They
have no police force to conduct an investigation, no power to compel
testimony or document production from nonparties to the arbitration,
and limited ability to force a party suspected of corruption to fully
cooperate in the inquiry.*7?

However, as the proceedings advanced, it became apparent that the case
of Niko had been investigated in Bangladesh, Canada and the United
States by law enforcement agencies in those countries and in cooperation
under mutual legal assistance arrangements among them. The results of
these investigations were produced as evidence in the present
Arbitrations. Two of the lead investigators produced witness statements
and testified at the Hearing. The Tribunals thus were provided precisely
with the type of evidence and information which, in the words of the
Respondents, ICSID tribunals usually do not have.

When considering the corruption evidence before them, the Tribunals
therefore will commence by describing (i) the Joint Investigation, (ii) the
accounts given of it in the Arbitrations prior to the Corruption Claim and
during the proceedings on that Claim; and then (iii) the collection of
evidence from other sources during the proceedings on the Corruption
Claim Finally, they will (iv) examine whether there are any gaps in the
evidence available and (v) consider inferences and conclusions on the
available evidence.

The Joint Investigation through Mutual Legal Assistance (Canada,
Bangladesh and U.S.)

It appears from the evidence in these Arbitrations that Bangladesh to
some extent took an active role in the investigation of corruption in the
country first through the National Coordination Committee against
Grievous Offences (NCCAGO), then through the Anti-Corruption
Commission of Bangladesh (ACC), and finally also by the mechanism of
international cooperation. These efforts included investigation of Niko. In
this case the cooperation was initiated by Canada and conducted through
the use of mutual legal assistance under the United Nations Convention
Against Corruption (UNAC), as explained by the High Court Division to
which the Government of Bangladesh had provided evidence.

In these proceedings, the Government, represented by the Secretary,
Energy Division, Ministry of Energy, Power and Mineral Resources,

produced substantial evidence of corruption gathered by
Bangladesh through Mutual Legal Assistance (MLAs) requests
between the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) in Canada, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the United States, and the
Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC) in Bangladesh. The investigation
of the corruption of [Niko and Niko Canada] was initiated by the
Canadian Law enforcing authorities in 2005. The initial RCMP
investigation began in June 2005 after an official from Canada’s
Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade (DFAIT) alerted
RCMP to the possible violation of the Canadian Corruption of Foreign
Public Officials Act by [Niko and Niko Canada]. The RCMP started
investigation and had sent a letter of request to Bangladesh for
investigation and legal assistance. That investigation was joined by
the United States Department of Justice through the FBI, since one of
the prime actors in the corruption scheme, Mr. Qasim Sharif, was a
U.S. citizen and transferred a large part of proceeds of crime to the
United States. The ACC has charged several individuals in criminal
cases under the laws of Bangladesh for offences committed in
Bangladesh.‘473

As explained by the Court, the investigation began in June 2005 as a
direct consequence of the gift that Niko had made to the State Minister
and the news in the Bangladeshi press. On 15 June a Bangladeshi
newspaper, The Daily Star, published an article entitled “Niko gifts
minister luxurious car’. On 18 June another newspaper wrote that the

Minister had been summoned to the Prime Minister’s office in Dhaka
where he tendered his resignation. On 20 June the Canadian Department
of Foreign Affairs and International Trade alerted the RCMP to these news
stories.474 Mr Khan explained in his second witness statement:

The RCMP became involved because the Canadian High
Commissioner in Bangladesh at the time, Barbara Richardson, was
concerned about Niko’s activities, and sent a request to begin an
investigation. As a part of the investigation, Canada made a request
for mutual legal assistance to Bangladesh in 2006. My firm Octokhan
was formally engaged by the caretaker government in 2007 to provide
key strategic services to the Anti-Corruption Commission of
Bangladesh (“ACC”), initially through the National Coordination
Committee against Grievous Offences (“NCCAGO”) and then directly
to the ACC, the Office of the Attorney General for Bangladesh and
other agencies.475

The Respondents highlighted the importance of the Canadian
investigations led by Corporal Duggan.

According to Corporal Duggan, the Niko investigation involved
assistance of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation, City
of London Police, the World Bank, and the United States Department
of Justice, eight completed Mutual Legal Requests, 16 Production
Orders, and 20 people interviewed in six different countries.476

The Respondents produced a report in the form of a PowerPoint
presentation, in which Corporal Duggan accounted for the RCMP anti-
corruption activity.47”7 The presentation was entitled “Royal Canadian
Mounted Police, Foreign Bribery Investigation by Corporal Kevin Duggan”
and included a section on the Niko investigation under the heading
“Project Koin: Niko Resources Ltd”. The document shows the broad scope
of the investigation, recording assistance to the RCMP from Bangladesh,
Japan, Switzerland, Barbados, United States and the United Kingdom;
specific mention is made of

The authorities of the United States became involved in 2007 and, as she
explained in her first witness statement, Ms Debra LaPrevotte Griffith,
Supervisory Special Agent at the FBI, played an important role in the
investigation. She had “instituted the agency’s Kleptocracy Program” at
the FBI. She described as a particular achievement that she had “seized
more than $1 billion in corrupt proceeds” and that she was “recognized as
the F.BJ.’s expert in international money laundering and asset
recovery’ .*79 She described the initiation of the investigation as follows:

In 2007, the interim caretaker government in Bangladesh requested
the assistance of the Unites States to investigate corruption in
Bangladesh. The request for international cooperation was forwarded
to the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), where it was assigned to Linda
Samuel, the Deputy Chief of the Asset Forfeiture and Money
Laundering Section. The investigative aspect of the request was
assigned to me at the F.B.I. In January 2008, Linda Samuel and I
travelled to Bangladesh to meet with our foreign counterparts and
begin our investigations.*®°

Following her report on that first visit, “the F.B.I. agreed and we opened
an umbrella case to address Bangladesh corruption”. During the following

years until 2011, she travelled four or five times to Bangladesh and
“worked closely with the National Coordination Committee against
Grievous Offences (“NCCAGO”) and then the Anti-Corruption Commission
(“ACC”) on the corruption cases we investigated”.*®!

In the course of this investigation, the F.B.I was “informed of numerous
corruption investigations opened in Bangladesh” and addressed first the
“cases with a strong nexus to the U.S.”

Niko was one such case, because Niko used a U.S. citizen as one of
its so-called consultants in Bangladesh and eventually made him
President of its subsidiary in Bangladesh.*§?

As part of the FBI investigation in Bangladesh, Ms LaPrevotte described
in some detail the case concerning the Siemens contract for a nationwide
cell phone network in Bangladesh which was awarded to it at a value of
US$40 million. In that case, “Siemens pled guilty in the U.S. to paying
bribes and kickbacks” to secure the contract. The modus operandi which
Ms LaPrevotte observed in the Siemens case, as in other cases, consisted
in hiring “on the ground” consultants.*8>

With respect to her investigation of Niko, Ms LaPrevotte explained:

I continued to work closely with Bangladesh investigators until
December 2015. I obtained records from the U.S., Bangladesh,
Singapore, Switzerland and Canada. The F.B.I. investigated Niko
Resources in cooperation with the Bangladeshi ACC and the Royal
Canadian Mounted Police ("RCMP").484

She also explained that the FBI investigations against Niko began in
“early 2008”,*85 at a time when she was already aware of the investigation
in Canada. Her testimony continued by reporting on the FBI
investigations and the conclusions she had reached, as discussed further
below.

Mr Ferdous Ahmed Khan described the investigations in Bangladesh
and explained that the “Bangladeshi investigative teams were multi-
disciplinary groups made up of higher-level officials from different
departments [...] working in concert with the Governments of Canada and
the United States”.48© He played a key role in this investigation. Since
2007 he and his company Octokhan had been

... formally engaged to provide key strategic services to the Anti-
Corruption Commission of Bangladesh, initially through the National
Coordination Committee against Grievous Offences ((“NCCAGO’) and
then directly to the Anti-Corruption Commission, the Office of the
Attorney General for Bangladesh and other agencies. [He] was
appointed Special Assistant to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on
corruption matters in 2009 and [his] appointment was renewed in
2014.487

Concerning the internal allocation of responsibilities in Bangladesh, Mr
Khan testified that the Attorney General was formally responsible for
engagement in the international mutual cooperation:

The Office of the Attorney General for Bangladesh sent mutual legal
assistance requests to Canada and the US and the RCMP and the
United States DOJ came to Bangladesh to investigate Niko offences,
gather evidence of corruption and money laundering, and take
witness statements. The Attorney General sent formal letters to his
Canadian and US counterpart Central Authorities to share evidence
among the three governments and cooperate in the investigation of
Niko. #88

Concerning the gathering of the evidence by the “joint Canadian-US-
Bangladeshi investigation”, Mr Khan highlighted the close cooperation
between the authorities of the three countries. As a result, documents
used in Bangladesh bore the stamp of the RCMP even though they had
originated in Bangladesh. Mr Khan explained:

The vast majority of that evidence was gathered in Bangladesh in
joint efforts between Canadian and Bangladeshi officials. This
evidence was then given to the RCMP through the mutual legal
assistance process to be processed, indexed and scanned to create a

486 Khan Second Witness Statement, paragraph 9.

common source for the use of both countries and U.S. law enforcement
agencies. It was returned to Bangladesh through the mutual legal
assistance process and the RCMP stamp simply indicates that it has
been shared with the RCMP, not that it was originally provided by
Canada.*89

825. The written evidence and the testimony at the Hearing demonstrated the
close cooperation between the agencies in the three countries. There is
no indication that any relevant evidence supporting allegations of
corruption by Niko was withheld by one of them. To the contrary, Mr
Khan has testified that the RCMP was very supportive of making his
evidence available in the present Arbitrations by testifying at the Hearing:

I also discussed my participation in this arbitration and my intention
to provide the evidence to the Tribunals with my counterparts at the
RCMP and the Canadian Department of Justice. They had no
objections. To the contrary, they are very supportive of my efforts to
bring the details of Niko’s corrupt activities in Bangladesh to the
attention of an international tribunal considering the matter.49°

826. The Tribunals had quoted in some of the Procedural Orders the statement
by Mr Khan in his second witness statement about “/t/he vast majority of
that evidence” (see paragraph 824). In their letter of 23 August 2017 the
Respondents assert that this statement was taken out of context. They
wrote:

Mr. Khan’s statement was simply that most of the evidence provided
to Bangladesh by Canada pursuant to the Mutual Legal Assistance
request had been generated in Bangladesh. The witness’s words in
no way meant that there was not other highly significant evidence in
Canada_to_which_ Respondents and _Bangladesh_have_never_ had
access, as Respondents have consistently argued.

 

827. At the Hearing Mr Khan was clear about the extent of the cooperation
and free exchange between the agencies:

The task forces then gathered those evidence and the foreign law

enforcement agencies gathered those evidence. They were exchanged
between the countries and between us, that means Bangladesh

489 Khan Second Witness Statement, paragraph 10.
490 Khan Second Witness Statement, paragraph 11.

237

828.

829.

830.

shared with Canada, Bangladesh shared with US. US and Canada
exchanged with each other as well and we gave clearance for that.19!

There is no indication in that statement, nor elsewhere in Mr Khan’s
testimony, that the Canadian investigators withheld evidence, especially
interrogations of persons such as Mr Bhuiyan and Mr Sharif. Mr Khan
was clear in explaining in his witness statement that the evidence
gathered was understood as a joint effort; it was “processed, indexed and
scanned to create a common source for the use of both countries and the
U.S. law enforcement agencies” .492

The Tribunals conclude that Bangladesh had the full evidence that was
gathered in the course of the Joint Investigation, to the extent it was
relevant to the Niko corruption allegation. In view of this close
cooperation between the three law enforcement agencies, the Tribunals
have no reason to believe that the RCMP or the FBI withheld any
evidence relevant for Niko’s alleged corruption. Consequently, it is
now clear to the Tribunals that any interventions of the Tribunals in
Canada and the United States are not likely to produce evidence
beyond that which is available in Bangladesh and accessible to the
Respondents.

Mr Khan asserted that the evidence gathered by Investigators
demonstrated acts of corruption beyond the gift of the vehicle and the
travel expenses. He stated that the Investigators were convinced that Niko
procured the Agreements by corruption and that the RCMP officers were
“very disappointed when the Canadian prosecutors decided to accept a
plea bargain for the bribe to State Minister Hossain involving an expensive
car and payment for travel and leave the significant evidence of other
corruption on the table”.+93 The Tribunals noted, however, that Corporal
Duggan in the PowerPoint presentation of the Canadian corruption
investigations indicates no other case of corruption and mentions, with
respect to the outcome of the Niko case, only

As recorded above in Section 2.7, the investigation against Niko in the
United States was discontinued and the Department of Justice
determined that “prosecution is not necessary at this time in light of Niko’s
guilty plea in Canada”.

The Tribunals have nevertheless examined the evidence from the Joint
Investigation, as it was presented in the Arbitrations, in order to
determine whether it supported by other acts of corruption the
Respondents’ allegations that the Agreements were procured by
corruption; and they have extended their own investigation beyond the
evidence from the Joint Investigation.

The evidence from the Joint Investigation in the Arbitrations prior to
the Corruption Claim

The Respondents referred to the corruption investigations first in the
context of their objection to the Tribunals' jurisdiction in their Counter-
Memorial of 16 May 2011. In that submission, the Respondents explained
that the ACC had filed charges at “Tejgaon Police Station Case No. 20 of
2007 against government officials under the provisions of the Prevention of
Corruption Act 1947 and the Penal Code 1860, and there continues to be
a pending charge against one former Prime Minister’. Answering a
question from the Tribunals, the Respondents invited the Tribunals to
order the Claimant to disclose any relevant documents.

The Claimant responded that it had received requests for information
from the ACC and had been informed that the ACC was investigating
whether public officials of the Government of Bangladesh accepted bribes
in respect to investments in Bangladesh. The investigations also
concerned Mr Qasim Sharif who was “at one time an officer of Claimant’.
The Claimant added that according to its information “most, if not all, of
the charges were stayed. The Claimant understands that no further

239

835.

836.

837.

838.

proceedings have yet been taken on any charges that were not stayed, if
in fact any charges remain outstanding.” The Claimant declared that it
“was not told that it was a target of the investigation” .495

In response to a question from the Tribunals on 29 August 2011, the
Respondents referred to the Canadian conviction based on the two gifts
to the State Minister.49°

The Tribunals tried to obtain further information about this investigation
and discussed the matter at the Hearing on Jurisdiction on 13 and 14
October 2011. Mr Adolf and Mr Imam Hossain, witnesses presented by
the Claimant and the Respondents, respectively, stated that they were
aware of the ACC investigation. Mr Adolf stated that the ACC had
approached Niko, requesting access to its files, and that it was provided
such access. He added that he did not think that “there is any further
action taking place”. Mr Hossain stated that his knowledge was “the same
as Mr Adolf’, but added that “one investigation is going on by the ACC and
they have seized some files from Petrobangla”.497

Towards the end of the Hearing on Jurisdiction, the Claimant produced
some documents emanating from the ACC, in particular the “Charge
Sheet” dated 7 May 2008 and a document of 5 May 2008 reporting on
discussions relating to the negotiations of the JVA and alleged illegalities
committed in this context relating to the Charge Sheet.498 The Decision
on Jurisdiction recorded:

The Respondents’ counsel stated that they had been unaware of the
charge sheets prior to their delivery by the Claimant’s counsel
towards the end of the hearing; they could not provide any
information about the status of these investigations.

The Tribunals noted that, apart from the comments just described, “no
further evidence was provided about the investigation by the ACC” .*99

As the account in the preceding section shows, by the time of the Hearing
on Jurisdiction on 13 and 14 October 2011,

e the RCMP investigations had commenced in 2005;

* Canada had made a request to Bangladesh in 2006 for mutual

legal assistance;

« the NCCAGO/ACC investigation had commenced in 2007 and

possibly earlier;

e Mr Khan and his company had been engaged for assistance to

the ACC and in 2009 he was appointed Special Assistant to Prime
Minister Sheikh Hasina on corruption matters;

e the Office of the Bangladesh Attorney General had sent mutual

assistance requests to Canada and the U.S. and officials from
these countries had come to Bangladesh to investigate, inter alia,
the case of Niko;

e further to the request to the United States in 2007, Ms LaPrevotte

had travelled in January 2008 to Bangladesh to begin her
investigative work there;

e prior to May 2008, documents relating to the negotiations of the

JVA, the GPSA and the blowouts had been seized in the offices of
Petrobangla in the course of the ACC investigation;5©° they are
mentioned in the Charge Sheet of 5 May 2008.

During the proceedings on jurisdiction, the Government of Bangladesh
was still a party to the Arbitrations and, as such, responsible for the
submissions made and represented at the Hearing. The Tribunals find it
difficult to believe that the Attorney General, who was responsible for the
requests for legal assistance to Canada and the United States, would not
have been aware of the Joint Investigation and its results.

At the April 2017 Hearing, Mr Khan was questioned by the Respondents’
counsel:

... Mr Khan, can you please explain to the Tribunal how and when
you acquired the evidence you presented in this arbitration?

500 These seizures are mentioned in the Charge Sheet of 5 May 2008, Exhibit R-211.

241

MR KHAN: The evidence was collected after I was engaged from 2007
to around 2011. The package of evidence that came from Canada was
collected by me from Ottawa in September 2011.

The US evidence was in process. We have not received anything
formally from US on Niko case. We have received other evidence on
other cases but not Niko case. Canadian evidence, once it was
received in September after due process, I handed it over to Anti-
Corruption Commission, through the Attorney General's office in
December 2011.

MS TSUTIEVA: Thank you, Mr Khan. When did you share it with
Respondents’ counsel?

MR KHAN: The Respondents’ then counsel was Tawfique Nawaz and
Tawfique Nawaz I believe was handed over the evidence package by
me in the first half of March 2012, sir.

MS TSUTIEVA: Thank you, Mr Khan. Who authorised you to give him,
to give Mr Nawaz this evidence?

MR KHAN: It was the Attorney General for Bangladesh Mr Mahbubey
Alam authorised it.

MS TSUTIEVA: Why did you give it directly to Mr Tawfique Nawaz?

MR KHAN: It is in evidence and I was instructed by the Attorney
General to give it directly to Tawfique Nawaz.

MS TSUTIEVA: Mr Khan, do you know what he did with this evidence?
MR KHAN: No, I do not, sir.

MS TSUTIEVA: Mr Khan, why did you not disclose this in your
statement submitted in this arbitration?

MR KHAN: I did not see the importance of mentioning that in my
witness statement.

MS TSUTIEVA: When did you share this evidence with Respondents’
current counsel, Foley Hoag?

MR KHAN: I was contacted by Foley Hoag around June last year,
2016, and after that, the due process, then I handed it over to Foley
Hoag in September 2016.

MS TSUTIEVA: Mr Khan, can you tell us who authorised you to do so
at this time?

242

842.

843.

844.

MR KHAN: The Principal Secretary in the Prime Minister's Office
telephoned me asking me to assist Foley Hoag and then I asked him
to set up due process. Then subsequently Foley Hoag entered into an
arrangement with my firm Octokhan in their London office to receive
this evidence properly and then I handed it over to Foley Hoag.5°!

In this exchange Mr Khan testifies that the evidence was collected from
2007 to around 2011. The information about the date when he collected
the evidence from Canada must be seen in conjunction with his
testimony, elsewhere in his evidence, about the manner in which the
testimony was collected and delivered to Canada. In his second witness
Statement he explained that

the vast majority of that evidence was gathered in Bangladesh in joint
efforts between Canadian and Bangladeshi officials. This evidence
was then given to the RCMP through the mutual legal assistance
process to be processed, indexed and scanned to create a common
source for the use of both countries and U.S. law enforcement
agencies. It was returned to Bangladesh through the mutual legal
assistance process and the RCMP stamp simply indicates that it has
been shared with the RCMP, not that it was originally provided by
Canada. 5°?

The Tribunals conclude that the evidence which Mr Khan collected in
September 2011 from Ottawa had been gathered, in its vast majority, in
Bangladesh and had been delivered to Canada for processing “to create a
common source for the use of both countries and U.S. law enforcement
agencies”, as described by him. In other words, by the time of the Hearing
on Jurisdiction on 13 to 14 October 2011, a great preponderance of the
evidence had been gathered in Bangladesh, was available to the Attorney
General, and could have been produced by the Government in its defence
against jurisdiction in the present case

Mr Khan testified that during the first half of March 2012, he delivered
this evidence to the Respondents’ counsel in the present proceedings.
These Arbitrations continued; the Tribunals decided the objections to
their jurisdiction and then the Payment Claim, ordered Petrobangla to
pay for the gas delivered by the BAPEX/Niko Joint Venture, and
advanced in the proceedings on the Compensation Declaration. No claim
to avoid the Agreements on grounds of corruption was raised.

The Respondents explain that their failure to act on the evidence made
available to their prior counsel was due to the failure of that counsel who
was “fired for inadequate representation” .5°3 They do not explain how their
counsel’s supposed inadequacy for so long escaped their attention.

Mr Khan testified that the Attorney General instructed him to deliver the
evidence gathered in the Joint Investigation, after it had been processed
in Canada, to counsel of the Respondents, who -- at that time and until
the Government was released from these Arbitrations by the Decision on
Jurisdiction - was also the Government’s counsel. There is no
explanation why in the Arbitrations the Government did not make
available this evidence as it had been collected, before it delivered it to
Canada, or indeed thereafter.

Instead, the Respondents during the jurisdiction phase, which included
the Government of Bangladesh, made the following statement:

The Respondents do not intend to argue that the contract is void or
voidable, by reason of corruption or otherwise. They would, of course,

revisit this position if further disclosure made it appropriate to do
so, 504

In other words, by August 2011, the Government, Petrobangla and
BAPEX did not consider that the evidence then available justified the
conclusion that the Agreements were void or voidable on grounds of
corruption.

The Respondents’ use of the Joint Investigation in the proceedings
on the Corruption Claim

When it introduced the Corruption Claim in its Memorial on Damages of
25 March 2016, BAPEX asserted that it relied on “new evidence of
corruption recently obtained by BAPEX [which] fundamentally change the
nature of these proceedings”.°°5 Petrobangla approved the presentation of
BAPEX in a separate letter of the same date.

853.

The evidence which BAPEX presented to justify the newly introduced
Corruption Claim does not appear to have been the same as that collected
in the Joint Investigation which Mr Khan, on instructions of the Attorney
General, had delivered to the Respondents’ counsel in March 2012.
BAPEX did not even mention the Joint Investigation. It explained that the
“evidence of payments made to obtain the JVA was discovered by the ACC
investigation” and asserted that a judgment “late last year” lifted a stay
on the criminal proceedings against ex-Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. The
judgment in question had been rendered by the High Court Division of
the Supreme Court in proceedings under Article 102 of the Constitution,
initiated in 2008, and had been rendered orally on 18 June 2015 and in
writing on S November 2015.506

With the start of the trial, according to the explanations in the BAPEX
Memorial, the ACC provided the Respondents “with some of the evidence
it recently submitted to the Bangladesh court’.5°7 In that Memorial, BAPEX
relied essentially on the “new information from Corporal Duggan’s
affidavit, as corroborated by the ACC charge sheet and the recent Order of
the Supreme Court’.5°8 Without mentioning the legal assistance between
Canada and Bangladesh, BAPEX asserted that it “would be even more
difficult and costly for the Canadian Government to gather evidence in
Bangladesh ...”5°9

As to the investigations in Bangladesh, BAPEX insisted on the
independence of the ACC which had made it impossible to access
information from its inquiries. BAPEX went so far as to write:

The Government has no control over the activities of the ACC and, for
obvious reasons, the ACC has no obligation to share information with
the Government, much less a company like BAPEX or Petrobangla.5!9

On the strength of this curious affirmation, BAPEX continued to describe
the difficulty it had encountered in seeking evidence and information
with respect to the alleged corruption:

506 Begum Khaleda Zia v. Anit-Corruption Commission and ors., Writ Petition No. 4982 of 2008 (High Ct.
Div.), Order Lifting Stay of Proceedings, 5 November 2015, Exhibit R-230; see also above Section 2.6.3.

510 B-MD, paragraph 41.

854.

855.

856.

Other than the court orders available, BAPEX/Petrobangla have had
no information on the content of the ACC investigation or what
evidence was being gathered. BAPEX and Petrobangla have
requested documentation from the ACC on the Niko corruption case,
and now that the trial has restarted, the ACC has provided them with
some of the evidence that it recently submitted to the Bangladesh
court. Only this week has BAPEX received the information from the
ACC to be able to share it with the Tribunal. The full record, however,
is still not public and is not yet available to BAPEX.*!!

Elsewhere in the Memorial on Damages BAPEX wrote:

BAPEX did not have access to the information from the ACC
investigation and did not have Corporal Duggan’s affidavit. It had to
wait for the investigation and criminal proceedings underway in
Bangladesh to progress to a stage where the evidence would become
available. When that proceeding started back up last year, BAPEX
sought to gather the evidence needed for this Tribunal to determine
that the agreements were procured by corruption and are therefore
voidable.>!?

In their response to the Tribunals’ enquiry about information and
evidence concerning the negotiation and conclusion of the two
Agreements (Procedural Order No 13), the Respondents repeated that
they “do not have access to all the information uncovered in investigations
of Niko by the Anti-Corruption Commission (“ACC”), the Royal Canadian
Mounted Police (“RCMP”), and others”.518

During the weeks that followed the introduction of their Corruption
Claim, the Respondents requested evidence from the Claimant and
sought to engage the Tribunals in interventions with the Canadian
authorities and in the court proceedings in Bangladesh in order to obtain,
through Mr Khan, evidence collected by the ACC.5!4 As explained above,
on 8 August 2016 the Respondents made an application to the Tribunals
requesting them to “issue a declaration that could be presented to the
court” which was dealing with the Alam Writ Petition. They asserted that
this intervention by the Tribunals was necessary, “/bjecause this evidence

is part of the ACC investigation, without authorization from the ACC or a
Bangladeshi court order, such evidence is not available to Respondents or
these Tribunals. ”>15

In its Memorial on Damages, BAPEX asserted that the Respondents “have
requested documentation from the ACC on the Niko corruption case”5!© but
did not provide any details on these requests. Since the Attorney General,
already in 2011, had given instruction to deliver the evidence from the
Joint Investigation to the Respondents, it is difficult to understand why
the delivery of that evidence should be refused subsequently.

The Respondents made repeated requests by which they sought to engage
the Tribunals in interventions before the Canadian authorities. They did
so before and also after they had presented, essentially through the
witness statements of Mr Ferdous Ahmed Khan and Ms Debra LaPrevotte
Griffith, detailed explanations about the joint Canadian/ Bangladeshi/
U.S. investigation. These explanations made it clear that the evidence
gathered in this Joint Investigation was shared between the participating
organisations.

The sharing was systematic to the point that, as explained by Mr Khan,
it “was processed, indexed and scanned to create a common source for the
use of both countries [Bangladesh and Canadaj and U.S. law enforcement
agencies”. The Tribunals, therefore, find it difficult to understand the
insistence with which the Respondents have sought to engage the
Tribunals in interventions in Canada to obtain evidence that had been
shared with the authorities in Bangladesh.

Mr Khan’s testimony at the Hearing, as quoted above, also seems to
indicate that, prior to the initiative of their new counsel in June 2016,
the Respondents made no effort to obtain the evidence from the Joint
Investigation available in Bangladesh. As Mr Khan explained, the newly
instructed counsel contacted him in June 2016. It was only then, on
instructions of the Principal Secretary in the Prime Minister’s Office, that
Mr Khan delivered the evidence to the Respondents’ counsel in
September 2016.

866.

In these circumstances, the Tribunals must conclude that the
Respondents and the Government which controls them previously had
no serious interest or intention in these Tribunals’ examining the case of
the alleged corruption by Niko.

The Tribunals also note that, once the evidence from the Joint
Investigation had been delivered to them by Mr Khan, the Respondents
continued their procedural applications seeking to engage the Tribunals
in searches and interventions with little if any prospect of additional
relevant evidence.

In an application of 26 January 2017, amplified on 3 February 2017, the
Respondents requested, once again, an intervention in Canada, this time
by an application to the Alberta Court of Queen’s Bench, with an
engagement of reciprocity by ICSID, for the appearance of Corporal
Duggan and the production of videos and transcripts of interviews
presumably made by investigating officers of persons not available for
questioning by opposing counsel and the Tribunals. The application was
discussed extensively at the Status Conference on 30 January 2017 (see
Sections 2.4.9 and 2.4.10).

The Respondents also followed a different approach in a new attempt to
obtain evidence concerning the Joint Investigation by a request on 14
March 2017, seeking (under the heading “Documents from the criminal
investigations”, production of

JrJecords in any format held by or available to Claimant or its former
counsel pertaining to the ACC, Canadian, or U.S. investigations of
Niko’s activities in Bangladesh.

Both applications were denied in Procedural Order No 18.517

The Respondents’ attempts continued even after the April 2017 Hearing
and the closure of the evidence on the Corruption Claim. As explained
above in Section 2.4.17, the Respondents made another attempt on 23
August 2017 to seek the Tribunals’ intervention with the Canadian
authorities to hear Corporal Duggan. In their letter of that date, the
Respondents brought “to the Tribunals’ attention a letter from the RCMP
regarding evidence from the Canadian investigation”. The Respondents

517 See above Section 2.4.11.

248

867.

868.

produced a letter by which the Deputy Commissioner, Federal Policing,
RCMP, responded on 21 April 2017 to a request of the Attorney General
of Bangladesh, dated 26 March 2017. The Attorney General’s request
seems to have concerned permission for Corporal Duggan to appear for
cross-examination at the Tribunals’ hearing in Paris of 24 to 29 April
2017. The Respondents did not produce the request of the Attorney
General; but the RCMP concluded from it that the Tribunals “indicated
that [they do] not wish to hear from the RCMP, either through documentary
evidence or through live witnesses”. The RCMP concluded that, in these
circumstances, “the RCMP will be unable to voluntarily participate in the
matters before the Tribunal/s/’. The RCMP added that “if further
involvement is required by either the Claimant (Niko) or Respondents
(Bapex and Petrobangla), the RCMP would need a request from the
Tribunals, which it would then consider before determining how to
proceed’.

In their letter of 23 August 2017 the Respondents asserted

...there can be no doubt that the RCMP and its officers hold significant
evidence that is relevant and material to the question of Niko’s corrupt
procurement of the JVA and the GPSA |...] Their testimony and
evidence is not available to the Respondents through any other
means. Accordingly, to the extent the Tribunals consider giving any
credence to Claimant’s arguments regarding the sufficiency of the
evidence, Respondents would request that they accept the RCMP’s
offer and request the testimony of the agents and the additional
evidence in its possession.

Respondents have presented more than sufficient evidence to prove
that Niko established its investment and procured the JVA and GPSA
in bad faith, illegally, and by corruption. It should thus be
unnecessary for the Tribunals to reopen the evidentiary proceedings
on corruption. Nevertheless, in light of Claimant’s assertion of
privilege and its continued arguments challenging the sufficiency of
the evidence, Respondents feel compelled to bring this option for
gathering additional evidence to the Tribunals’ attention.

In the absence of a specific request for action, the Tribunals informed the
Parties on 11 September 2017 that they would address the matter in due
course as necessary. The Tribunals have accepted to hear the testimony
of Ms LaPrevotte and Mr Khan, two of the investigators. They did not
refuse to hear Corporal Duggan, contrary to what the RCMP was made to
believe. The Respondents failed to bring the correspondence about

249

869.

Corporal Duggan’s testimony to the attention of the Tribunals at the
Hearing or at any time before the closing of the evidentiary record; the
Tribunals did not see a justification for re-opening of the evidence.

As to the documentary evidence held by the RCMP to which the
Respondents made reference in their 23 August 2017 letter, the
Tribunals have pointed above to the very close cooperation between three
agencies investigating corruption the Niko case. The Respondents have
not shown any evidence nor even argued that the RCMP refused a request
from the Bangladeshi authorities to share evidence gathered in the Niko
investigation. The RCMP letter of 14 April 2017 does not indicate the
contrary.

8.4 Collection of evidence in the course of the proceedings

870.

871.

When the Tribunals decided to address the Respondents’ Corruption
Claim with priority, they considered possible approaches for examining
the corruption charges as effectively as possible with the means at the
disposal of an ICSID arbitral tribunal (see Section 2.4). As a first step,
they sought to gather information and documents related to the
negotiation and conclusion of the Agreements. They issued Procedural
Order No 13, inviting the Parties

e to provide a detailed account of the negotiations, and

e to identify persons who could testify about the negotiation and
conclusion of the two Agreements and possible corruption
influence in this process (the Tribunals informed the Parties of
their intention to hear as witnesses “persons who were involved
in the negotiations and conclusion of the JVA and the GPSA,
including those involved in the Government approval of these
Agreements’).

The Parties did indeed provide, on 14 June 2016 and on other occasions,
accounts of the negotiation and conclusion of the Agreements referring
also to the detailed account the Tribunals had given in the Decision on
Jurisdiction. Further information and evidence was provided with
subsequent submissions, both with respect to witnesses and
documentary evidence.

876.

8.4.1 Potential Witness Testimony

The Parties also provided lists of persons engaged in the negotiations.

The Claimant explained, in its letter of 14 June 2016, that Mr Robert
Ohlson, the former President and CEO of Niko Canada, who had both
day-to-day control and overall responsibility for negotiations relating to
the JVA, died in 2004. “PJrior to the JVA being signed Niko acted in
Bangladesh purely through a local agent, Mr Qasim Sharif who
subsequently served as President of Niko until 2005”. The Claimant
explained that it had no association with him “for many years, and Niko
has no recent contact with him”. It mentioned also Mr William Hornaday,
Mr Brian Adolf and Mr Amit Goyal who had “significant involvement’ in
the negotiations and/or execution of the GPSA. The Claimant indicated
names of persons involved in the GPSA negotiations.

The Respondents provided in Annex B to their Responses to Procedural
Order No 13 of 14 June 2016 a list of persons involved, on the side of
Petrobangla and BAPEX, in the negotiations of the GPSA.

In view of the information and documentation provided by the Parties in
response to Procedural Order No 13, the Tribunals sought further
clarifications by Procedural Order No 14, in particular with respect to the
functions of potential witnesses and their role in the negotiations as well
as information on the manner in which they could be contacted. In
response, the Parties updated the information on 8 August 2016.

The Claimant, in its letter of 8 August 2016, provided further information
about the three employees previously identified and confirmed that they
were available for testifying before the Tribunals. It also referred to three
persons who had provided sworn affidavits in the BELA Proceedings
on behalf of BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Government, viz. Muhammad
Imaduddin, Managing Director of BAPEX, MD. Nurul Islam, Deputy
Secretary, Energy Ministry and Mohammad Hossain, Secretary of
Petrobangla. The Claimant explained that they had provided an account
of the negotiations of the JVA, attesting that “the JVA was valid and that
none of the Government, Petrobangla or BAPEX was involved in any fraud
or misconduct in entering into the JVA”. The Claimant suggested that they
“may have information that could also assist the Tribunals”.

251

877. The Respondents provided, also on 8 August 2016, an updated version
of Annex B, containing additional details about the persons listed, their
role in the negotiations, and their current position and address (the
Respondents’ Updated List). In the accompanying letter, however, the
Respondents added this:

Respondents would like to inform the Tribunals that they have doubts
about the availability of the persons named. BAPEX and Petrobangla
have reached out to some of the persons named to obtain the updated
contact information, and many of them have made it clear that they
are unwilling or unable to appear before the Tribunals to testify.5!8

878. The Respondents commented on the Claimant’s statements about
persons involved on its side. They mentioned Edward Sampson,
describing him as “the Executive Chairman of Niko’s parent company who
worked closely with Mr Ohlson when it was entering Bangladesh”. They
added that Mr Sampson had retired from his role as Chairman, CEO and
President of Niko Canada at the end of 2013 but remained one of the
largest individual shareholders. As to Mr Sharif, the Respondents stated
that

Mr Sharif has a large online presence and his contact information in
the United States is available. If Niko is unable to provide it in today’s
submission, Respondents can provide contact information for Mr
Sharif. If Niko is unable to produce him as a witness, Respondents
request that the Tribunals make a request under the laws of the
United States (28 USC 1782) for the district court where Mr. Sharif
resides to order him to give his testimony in these proceedings.*°!9

879. The Tribunals addressed these issues concerning witness testimony in
the August and September 2016 Procedural Consultations and in
Procedural Order No 15, in which the Tribunals instructed the Claimant
to provide Witness Statements from Mr Hornaday, Mr Adolph and Mr
Goyal and to ensure their presence at the April 2017 Hearing. With
respect to Mr Sampson and Mr Sharif, the Tribunals:

order the Claimant to seek to obtain a Witness Statement from Mr

Sampson as well as his agreement to attend the Evidentiary Hearing
as a witness; if the Claimant is unable to do so, it shall describe the

518 Respondents’ letter of 8 August 2016, p. 5.
519 Respondents’ letter of 8 August 2016, p. 6.

252

880.

881.

steps it has taken to obtain the Witness Statement and Mr Sampson’s
appearance at the hearing;

note the Claimant’s statement that it has no control over Mr Sharif,
has no contact with him and did not know his whereabouts. At the
September 2016 Procedural Consultation, the Claimant confirmed
that Niko had no contact with Mr Sharif for many years. The
Respondents state that they were able to locate Mr Sharif in Houston,
Texas. The Respondents are invited to obtain a Witness Statement
from Mr Sharif and ensure his appearance at the Evidentiary Hearing.
The Tribunals note the Respondents’ explanations concerning the
possible objections by reason of Mr Sharif’s earlier role as agent and
officer of companies of the Niko Group. They instruct the Claimant to
deliver to the Respondents no later than 14 October 2016 a
declaration in the name of all companies of the Niko Group by which
Mr Sharif had been engaged as agent or officer, releasing him of all
obligations which would prevent him to provide the above described
Witness Statement and to appear at the Evidentiary Hearing. If the
Respondents nevertheless are unable to obtain from him a Witness
Statement and to procure his presence at the Evidentiary Hearing,
they shall describe the steps they have taken in this respect.°?°

The Tribunals also decided that the three affidavits in the BELA
Proceedings should be part of the record and invited both Parties to
contact the affiants with the objective of ensuring their appearance at the
April 2017 Hearing. Concerning the persons on the list of persons
presented as Annex B, the Tribunals noted that at the August and
September Procedural Consultations the Respondents surprisingly
declared that they were unable to identify the persons whom they had
contacted and which of them were unwilling or unable to testify. The
Respondents were invited to identify “the persons on their list whom they
have contacted and indicate those who are prepared to testify before the
Tribunals and to appear at the April 2017 Hearing, indicating subject
matter and time period which the testimony is expected to cover’. The
Tribunals reserved the decision as to who of these persons they required
to present a witness statement and to appear at the April 2017 Hearing.

On 27 October 2016, the Respondents provided the requested
information on the potential witnesses on their side:

Counsel for Respondents has been able to speak with a number of
the individuals from the list of persons who had some involvement in

520 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 53 (i)-(ii).

253

the negotiations of the JVA and the GPSA provided to the Tribunals
on 8 August 2016. We note that list did not contain complete
information on the current employment status of all the persons listed.
Respondents confirm that all Petrobangla or BAPEX employees on the
list have retired or resigned from service except for Mr. A K M Anwarul
Islam, who is still in service at BAPEX.

We have spoken to the following individuals and can provide the
following information about their knowledge of relevant events:

Major (Rtd.) M. Muqtadir Ali — Major Ali was Managing Director of
BAPEX for six months in 1998-1999 and again from April 2000 to
August 2001. He could be available to testify, but he was not involved
during some of the key period of negotiation of the JVA. [The Updated
List also stated that “he was involved in all the correspondence made
with regards to the JVA during his term as MD, Bapex and was
involved in the JVA negotiations”).

Mr. Magbul-E-Elahi - Mr. Elahi was Managing Director of BAPEX
from August 2001 through July 2003. He is available to testify and
knows about the negotiation of the JVA during the two years before it
was approved.

Mr. A K M Anwarul Islam - Mr. Islam was involved in negotiation
of the JVA as a financial analyst. He could be available to testify, but
has indicated that he only has knowledge of the negotiations
regarding the investment multiple and has no knowledge of other
aspects of the negotiations.

Mr. Rahman Murshed - Mr. Murshed was at Petrobangla when the
GPSA was negotiated. He states that he does not recollect any details
of the negotiations.

Mr. Ataul Haque - Mr. Haque was at Petrobangla when the GPSA
was negotiated, until August 2006. He states that he took notes for
the meeting minutes, but he does not recall any details and was not
part of the decision-making process.

Mr. M. Nazrul Islam - Mr. Islam was Director of Finance at
Petrobangla for six months in 2006 before he retired. He attended the
meeting during which the GPSA was approved, but was not involved
in negotiating the GPSA and did not review the GPSA outside of that
meeting.

Based on the information gathered in these conversations, we will

provide a witness statement from Mr. Maqbul-E-Elahi. We do not
believe that any of the others have sufficient recollection or knowledge

254

882.

of negotiations of the JVA and GPSA to merit calling them to testify
before the Tribunals. As our understanding of events grows through
review of the documents and these interviews, we think it would be
best to focus on a shorter list of key people, as many people on the
original list had only peripheral roles. We have therefore identified a
short list of persons that appear to be key people, noted in the
attached chart with information about efforts to contact them.°?!

The chart attached to the letter, entitled “Key Persons involved in the
Negotiations of the JVA & GPSA” provided information about six persons.
One of them was Mr Magqbul-E-Elahi, mentioned above. Another, Engr.
M.A. Based, MD BAPEX from 8 November 2003 to 9 June 2005, was
deceased. For two others availability was marked as “unknown — ongoing
efforts to contact”: Engr. Atiqur Raman (interim), MD BAPEX from 9 July
2003 to 8 November 2003, and Mr Mohammad Mosharraf Hossain
Bhuiyan, Chairman, Petrobangla from 14 December 2005 to 9 January
2007. The remaining two persons seemed of particular importance for the
Tribunals’ examination:

Mr Jahingir Kabir held key positions in Petrobangla throughout
the Targeted Period and at the time when both Agreements were
concluded. He was identified as “GM (PCD)” in Petrobangla from
27 January 1999 until 25 February 2004 and thereafter Sr. GM
(PCD) from 26 February 2004 to 12 November 2006. The
Respondents also indicated that he was Convener of the JVA
Review Committee.

Mr Raihanul Abedin held key positions in Petrobangla during
critical periods. He was identified as Senior General Manager
(Planning) in Petrobangla from 1 March to 31 July 2001, the
period during which the Procedure, including the provision
specific to Niko’s JVA, was adopted; and as Director (PSC) from
28 January 2003 to 30 June 2006, the period during which the
JVA was finalised until shortly before the conclusion of the GPSA;
during the time between these two assignments in Petrobangla,
Mr Abedin held the position of Managing Director at RPGCL,
apparently another subsidiary of Petrobangla. The Respondents
described his involvement in the negotiations of the two
agreements as “/i/nvolved in finalisation of the JVA and GPSA and
communicated with legal advisor of Petrobangla, BPAEX and Niko

521 Respondents’ letter of 27 October 2016, pp. 1-2.

255

during his tenure as Director (PSC)”. The allegation of bribes paid
to him in the context of the GPSA negotiations is discussed below
in Section 11.8.2.

883. The Respondents informed the Tribunals that both of these important
potential witnesses were not available and explained: “fujnwilling; refused
to attend video conference and to be a witness” .5?2

884. There were a number of persons identified in the Respondents’ Updated
List of 8 August 2016 about whom the Respondents did not provide
further information, even though, judging from that List, they appeared
as potentially important sources of information; these included:

e Ms Mahbubun NAHAR Senior Assistant Secretary Ministry, who,
according to the Updated List, “issued a letter dated 11.10.2003
instructing Petrobangla to sign final JVA in accordance with the
summary proposal approved by the Hon’ble Prime Minister (R-280)”
and the letter dated 14 June 2004 “instructing Petrobangla to take
necessary measure on emergency basis to sing GPSA with Niko for
purchasing gas produced from Feni gas filed within 20.6.2004 and
after doing so inform the EMRD accordingly” (R.282); the Updated List
indicated that she had “retired as Additional Secretary”;

e Mr Kamal SIDDIQI, Principal Secretary, Prime Minister’s office;
according to the Updated List he was “accused in the Niko Graft Case
in connection with the approval of the JVA; played role in getting
Prime Minister’s approval for finalising JVA by suppressing
information”; the List indicated his address and specified that he was
“retired from service”;

e Mr C.M. Yusouf HOSSAIN, Senior Assistant Secretary Ministry,
presently Joint Secretary & Director (Finance) Petrobangla; the
Updated List states that he was “accused by ACC in the Niko Graft
Case in connection with the approval of JVA; responsible for referring
the matter of Swiss Challenge system to the Law Minister and
suppressing information”;

e Mr Shafiur Rahman, Company Secretary BAPEX, signed the FOU;

the Updated List adds “later General Manager, Petrobangla. Retired
from service”;

522 Respondents’ letter of 27 October 2016, p. 3.

256

885.

886.

887.

888.

e Mr Rahman MURSHED, identified as Member of the Bangladesh
Energy Regulatory Commission, “involved in finalising the GPSA”
(Updated List of Persons).

The Tribunals also noted that some persons who were engaged in critical
activities relevant for the negotiations of the Agreements were not
mentioned in any of the Lists, in particular

e Mr Mizanur RAHMAN, Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry, who
signed letters of 25 May 1999 (the Government’s acceptance to
proceed with the Niko Project, R-270), and 12 August 1999 (directing
that a Study be conducted and giving approval to complete the FOU,
Exhibit JD C-7, p. 502), 19 and 29 March 2001 (R-337 and R-274,
instructing completion of the JVA).

¢ Mr Shafiqur RAHMAN, Senior Assistant Secretary, Ministry in 2003
(see Exhibit C-153); signed the letter of 1 April 2003, which reported
on the Opinion of the Law Ministry (C-153 and R-307);

Concerning the persons who had provided affidavits in the BELA
Proceedings, the Respondents produced with their Memorial on
Corruption of 27 November 2016, witness statements of two of them (Md
Imaduddin and Mr Nurul Islam) in which they declared that the
affidavits had been prepared without their knowledge and had not been
signed by them; Md Imaduddin and Mr Islam stated that they had no
knowledge of the matters contained in their affidavit and that the content
did not represent their personal knowledge.522 The Respondents
explained that “efforts to contact Mr Hossain, the other affiant in the BELA
Proceedings, and other Petrobangla officials are ongoing” .5?4

The Claimant explained that on 17 November 2016 it had written to all
three of the affiants, but received no response to its letters.525

As explained above in Section 2, the Respondents also produced a
witness statement by Mr Elahi.

523 Imaduddin Witness Statement, paragraph 6 ans Islam Witness Statement, paragraph 7.
524 R-MC, paragraph 18.
525 C-CMC, paragraph 22.

257

889.

890.

891.

892.

Generally with respect to the availability of witnesses the Respondents
explained:

We note that issues related to Niko’s corruption and the officials
affected by it are very delicate in Bangladesh. Those accused of
corruption are powerful and are reputed to use threats, intimidation,
and violence. It is not easy for anyone in Bangladesh to make these
accusations and retired officials are understandably reluctant to get
involved in this matter, with the significant risks doing so could entail
for them and their families.°?¢

With their Memorial on Corruption of 23 November 2016, the
Respondents also produced witness statements of Mr Ferdous Ahmed
Khan and Ms Debra LaPrevotte Griffith describing the Joint
Investigation. The Respondent declared that both persons were available
for examination at the April 2017 Hearing, scheduled for 24 to 28 April
2017 (with 29 April in reserve). In its letter of 11 January 2017, the
Claimant raised the question “/wjhether it will be useful for ‘witnesses’
with no personal knowledge of the facts they address, such as Mr. F. Khan
and Ms. LaPrevotte Griffith, to testify at the April 2017 Hearing and for
Niko to prepare to cross-examine such ‘witnesses”. The Respondents
replied on 17 January 2017, insisting that these persons be heard,
arguing that they are “entitled to marshal the evidence and make
arguments without a referee making calls mid-play”.

On the occasion of the Status Conference on 30 January 2017, the
Claimant clarified that it did not seek the exclusion of the evidence in
question; rather the Claimant argued that no or very little weight should
be given to it. According to the Claimant, advance clarification of this
aspect could be of assistance to the Claimant when deciding whether to
call Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte Griffith to testify at the April 2017
Hearing, or otherwise assist in the preparation of its forthcoming
submission. The Respondents announced during the Status Conference
their intention of calling Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte Griffith to appear
for testimony at the April 2017 Hearing.

In Procedural Order No 18 of 23 March 2017 the Tribunals took the
following position:

526 R-MC, paragraph 18.

258

893.

894.

Concerning the witness statements of these two persons, the
Tribunals noted that their testimony concerns aspects of the joint
investigations of the Niko corruption allegations. The statements
include assessment of the evidence gathered about corruption in
Bangladesh in general and against Niko specifically. The testimony
of these two persons is similar to that of Corporal Duggan, except that,
according to the Respondents, no legal assistance intervention by the
Tribunals with the Court in Alberta is required.

The Tribunals are aware of the Claimant’s objections concerning the
hearsay nature of much of the two witness statements. The Tribunals
note that they are not bound by strict rules on the admissibility of
evidence. The Tribunals will take the Claimant’s observations into
consideration when it comes to the assessment of the testimony.

The Tribunals admit the appearance of Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte
Griffith as witnesses. Following the procedure previously adopted for
other witnesses, witness statements are accepted as direct testimony
if the witnesses appear for examination when called upon to
testify.5?7

Concerning Mr Sharif, the Claimant wrote to him on 14 October 2016,
further to the instructions of the Tribunals in Procedural Order No 15,
confirming that Niko

is not asserting (and will not in the future assert) that you are subject
to any ongoing duty of confidentiality arising either by virtue of your
prior employment relationship with [Niko], or by virtue of consulting
and/or management services you performed on behalf of Stratum
Developments Ltd for [Niko], which would prevent you from providing
a witness statement and/or testifying as a witness in connection with
the ICSID Arbitration Proceedings.5?8

The Respondents, referring to the Tribunals instructions in Procedural
Order No 15, explained that

counsel for Respondents contacted him and met with him. Mr Sharif
is charged with corruption-related crimes in two separate cases in
Bangladesh and said that he is not willing to provide a witness
statement or appear at the Hearing unless granted immunity by the
Government of Bangladesh.°?9

The Claimant responded to the Tribunals’ instruction concerning Mr Ed
Sampson, explaining that its counsel “reached out to [him to inquire of his
willingness to participate as a witness. Mr Sampson expressed his
unwillingness to participate as a witness and emphasised the staleness of
these matters and his retirement status” 59°

As stated in Section 2.4.13, Mr Adolph, Mr Hornaday and Mr Goyal, on
the Claimant’s side and Mr Chowdhury, Mr Elahi, Ms LaPrevotte and Mr
Khan, on the Respondents’ side, appeared at the April 2017 Hearing and
testified.

8.4.2 Documentary Evidence

Concerning the search for documentary evidence, the Parties assured
the Tribunals that they were making efforts of retrieval but described
difficulties they were facing for a variety of reasons, largely resulting from
the time that had elapsed since the relevant events.

In their first response to Procedural Order No 13, the Parties indicated
that their search for documents was still ongoing. In that response and
on other occasions, the Parties again referred to the difficulties they had
in retrieving relevant evidence.

The Claimant explained

Niko has confronted several challenges in its efforts fully to satisfy
the Tribunals’ invitation. First, the documents in issue concern a
period a decade or more ago. Niko’s arbitration counsel has not
previously had occasion to collect or review documents potentially
relevant to the Tribunals’ inquiry. Documents on the subject of the
Tribunals’ inquiry were collected under the direction of other counsel
for Niko years ago. It has taken some time to make arrangements for
the undersigned counsel to obtain access to these documents. Second,
the key individuals involved in the JVA negotiations are either dead
or have had no contact with Niko for many years.>3!

581 Claimant's letter of 14 June 2016, p. 5

260

900. The Claimant also highlighted another change affecting its ability to
provide information and evidence:

Much has changed since 2003. The lapse of time has implications not
only on Niko’s ability to marshal evidence concerning the facts but
also on the affected stakeholders.

No director or officer of Niko Canada today was in such a role in 2003,
with the sole exception of Mr. William Hornaday. Mr. Hornaday was
an officer of Niko Canada in 2003 but had limited involvement in
Bangladesh until after the JVA was executed.Mr. Robert Ohlson, the
President and Managing Director and owner of more than 10% of Niko
Canada’s shares in 2003, died in 2004.582

901. The Claimant added that “Niko is a very different company today than it
was in 2003”, emphasising the substantial drop in the price of its shares
and the different stance of the principal stakeholders, now “the
company’s creditors” 533

902. The Respondents, when describing their efforts to respond to the
Tribunals’ request for information and documents, wrote:

The ACC seized the original correspondence and note sheet folders
from both BAPEX and Petrobangla related to Niko, as well as other
documents. BAPEX and Petrobangla kept a copy of most, but not all,
of the seized correspondence. BAPEX no longer has any note sheets.
In addition, BAPEX moved into new offices after the relevant time
period.534

903. Shortly after having filed the Corruption Claim, on 19 April 2016 the
Respondents addressed to the Claimant requests for the production of
documents, and on 18 April 2016 the first request concerning the
“affidavit” of Corporal Duggan. The request for documents concerned

... the following specific categories of documents:

1. Communications dated between 2001-2003 _ regarding
negotiation and signing of the JVA, and dated from 2004-2006
regarding negotiation and finalization of the GPSA, between Niko
Resources Ltd, its affiliates, its officers or its agents and the following
recipients:

Financial records (including, but not limited to wire transfer receipts,
cancelled checks, and bank records) showing transfers and/or
payments of funds between 2001 and 2006 from or on behalf of Niko
Resources Ltd, its affiliates, its officers or its agents to any entity or
person in Bangladesh (including affiliates, employees and agents of
Niko Resource Ltd) or to any of the persons named in items 1-3 above.

Claimant had responded on 21 and 29 April 2016, denying the request,
and the Respondents transmitted the exchange to the Tribunals on 10
May 2016.

By Procedural Order No 13, the Tribunals invited

e the Claimant to respond to the Respondents’ request concerning
the affidavit of Corporal Duggan, an issue that has been dealt
with in Procedural Order No15, as described above in Section
2.4.5,

e the Respondents to provide a list of documents, including
company records and reports about the negotiations,

e the Claimant to provide a list of compliant documents in response
to the Respondents’ request for documents, which included
correspondence within the Niko group and with others during the
period 2001 to 2006, as well as financial records.

262

906.

909.

The Respondents submitted a detailed reply to the Tribunals’ request (R-
RPO13), accompanied by a large number of documents. The Tribunals
noted, however, that, with very few exceptions, these documents did not
include any company records of BAPEX and Petrobangla. By Procedural
Order No 14, they invited the Respondents to inform them “about the
respondent companies’ record-keeping practices and provide lists of the
relevant documents”. The Respondents provided this information,
produced some of the records, and explained reasons for missing
documents, as quoted above.

Concerning the Respondents’ request for document production, the
Claimant objected by letter of 14 June 2016 that the requests were
“overbroad and unfocused” and requested that the “parameters for the
compilation of a document list”? be narrowed. In Procedural Order No 14
the Tribunals recognised that the documents requested by the
Respondents were “relevant places to seek evidence”; but they accepted
that the request was “overbroad”.

In a letter of 8 August 2016, the Claimant wrote:

Niko has identified and retrieved files from its archives relating to the
negotiation of the JVA. In addition, via counsel, it has also retrieved
records collected by its external advisors in connection with the RCMP
investigation and related proceedings. While the review of those
records is still on-going, Niko considers that it is now in a position to
respond reasonably promptly to a suitably focused documentary
evidence request as submitted below.>35

In that letter, the Claimant also provided explanations concerning the
system of its payments to Bangladesh and outlined what it considered
appropriate limitations to the Scope of the Examination. It questioned
the extension of the Targeted Period to the conclusion of the GPSA,
stating that “addressing the 2001-2003 period will permit the present
phase of the proceedings to be conducted in the focused and expeditious
manner suggested by Procedural Order No. 13”. The letter continued by
stating:

595 Claimant's letter of 8 August 2016, p. 1.

263

910.

911.

Niko proposes that the production encompass records in its
possession relating to payments (if any) made to or communications
with (if any), the individuals identified above**° during the Targeted

Period, with the exception of Qasim Sharif.

With regard to Qasim Sharif, it must be borne in mind that he was the
principal of Stratum, Niko’s agent in Bangladesh until execution of the
JVA, and served thereafter as Niko’s President (until late 2005). As
such, in Niko’s respectful submission, it is neither reasonable nor
proportionate to require production of all correspondence with Mr.
Sharif during the Targeted Period. Instead, Niko respectfully suggests
the enquiry in relation to Mr. Sharif be limited to the following
parameters:

Payments to Mr. Sharif or to Stratum during the Targeted
Period; and

* Communications with Mr. Sharif or Stratum regarding
payments to or from the individuals identified at b. to g. above.

It is respectfully submitted that any enquiry beyond this would,
taking account of the Respondents’ request as well as the allegations
particularized in BAPEX’s Memorial on Damages, amount to nothing
more than a fishing expedition.597

During the Procedural Consultation that followed on 10 August 2016, the
Claimant

..explained that hard copy files had been assembled by it. In
addition, records had been collected by the Claimant’s previous
counsel, including financial records. These were now available and,
to the extent to which they concerned the Niko case, could be
produced. The Claimant also stated that it is prepared to present
minutes of board meetings and other internal documents to the extent
to which they concern the negotiations of the JVA and the GPSA.538

Concerning Financial Records, the Claimant provided in its letter of 8
August 2016 explanations concerning its “Bangladesh Payment Systems”

and the limitations, as set out in the passages quoted above.

912. During the September 2016 Procedural Consultation, the Claimant
explained that it had been incorporated in 1997 and that its branch in

596 The identified individuals were those listed in the Respondents’ request of 19 April 2016.

915.

Bangladesh was established in the latter half of 2003. Prior to
incorporation, payments to Bangladesh were made to Stratum, and
Stratum reported on the use of the funds so received. The Claimant
declared that it was prepared to produce the corresponding records as
part of the document production, subject to limitations concerning the
scope of the examination.

The Respondents objected to limiting the production of financial records
to those concerning Stratum, arguing that corruption payments may
have been made through other channels. They indicated that they were
prepared to appoint a financial expert and would agree to Niko
appointing one as well. They further believed it would be useful for the
Tribunals to appoint one or several experts to examine the relevant
financial information. In their letter of 8 August 2016, the Respondents
wrote:

The study of financial information to track payments that might have
been used for corruption must be done by specialized financial
experts, “including financial investigators and experts in financial
analysis, [and] forensic accountants [...].” Thus, Respondents reserve
their right to have a financial expert review all financial information
presented by Niko.

[oJ

We therefore request that Niko be ordered to make its financial
records available to an independent financial expert for review.
Respondents are prepared to appoint an expert for this purpose and
would, of course, agree to have Niko appoint an expert as well.
Respondents also believe it would be useful for the Tribunals to
appoint its own expert or experts.°39

The Claimant objected to this request.

The Tribunals considered the conflicting views of the Parties and gave
the following directions in Procedural Order No 15:

The Tribunals consider that the production of the records concerning
payments to Stratum are a useful start for the investigation; but they
accept the Respondents’ view that it cannot be excluded that
corruption payments took other routes, in particular through
companies of the Niko Group other than the Claimant. The Tribunals

599 Respondents’ letter of 8 August 2016, pp. 4-5.

265

916.

917.

have examined how this justified consideration can be taken into
account in the most effective and least disruptive manner.

During the September 2016 Procedural Consultation the Claimant
stated that it was prepared to produce complete records of all
payments to Bangladesh made by any of the companies of the Niko
Group. The Tribunals accept this production as a possibly sufficient
measure in the production of financial records; but they reserve the
right to consider the adequacy of this approach, once the production
has been made and the Respondents have had an opportunity of
commenting thereon. In particular, the Tribunals reserve the right to
order a statement of the auditor of the Niko Group, as it had been
announced in the draft of the present Procedural Order prior to the
September 2016 Procedural Consultation.

When envisaging the order for Niko to produce the said audited
statement, the Tribunals had considered that the Niko Group
produces consolidated accounts for the fiscal years ending on 31
March. The Tribunals concluded that any payment from a company of
the Niko Group to third parties in Bangladesh must be reflected in
these consolidated accounts. According to the accounts posted on the
Niko website, these consolidated accounts are audited by KPMG. The
Tribunals invite the Claimant to make the necessary preparatory
arrangements with the auditor of the Niko Group so that, if the
Tribunals decide that an audit report is required, the auditor may
produce on short notice a statement identifying any payments during
the fiscal years ending 31 March 2001 to 31 March 2004 which the
Niko Group made to beneficiaries in Bangladesh, possibly including
Stratum, identifying each beneficiary and the amounts received. In
view of these directions, the Tribunals see no need, at this stage, to
make further directions concerning the financial records of the Niko
Group.54°

The Tribunals also instructed that Mr Goyal’s Witness Statement “shall
include a description of the payments made to Bangladesh during the
Targeted Period’ .*41

In response to this order, the Claimant uploaded the document
production of Niko on the Secure Transfer Site of the Respondents’
counsel and informed them thereof on 14 October 2016. The Claimant
explained that the production was in compliance with the commitment

540 Procedural Order No 15, paragraphs 47 - 49.
541 Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 7/(i).

266

recorded by the Tribunals, as quoted above. With respect to payments in
Bangladesh, the Claimant added:

... given that Niko had commenced petroleum operations in late 2003
and 2004 there are a significant number of transactions as reflected
in the relevant bank statements. Considering the issues, we have
applied a materiality threshold of approximately $5’000 (converted
Taka amounts in the statements) for the production of supporting
documentation: that is, Niko has produced the available back up
documentation for each individual transaction that was in excess of
that threshold. If you have any concerns in this regard we are
prepared to discuss the application of reasonable materiality limits to
the production.>4?

Further to instructions of the Tribunals in Procedural Order No 18, the
Respondents, in a letter of 31 March 2017, acknowledged receipt of the
following financial documents:

73 “financials” documents dated 2001-2004, consisting of many one-
page bank statements and wire transfer requests, as well as limited
financial statements and vendor invoices.5*?

The Respondents declared this production to be “insufficient to provide a
basis for assessing whether Niko’s financial records contain evidence of
corruption”; they did not use the documents produced by Niko in the
preparation of their Memorial on Corruption of 23 November 2016.54 In
a separate letter of the same date, the Respondents developed their
objections and produced the opinion of Duff & Phelps, “a global financial
firm with expertise in complex valuation, disputes, compliance, and
regulatory consulting, among other topics”. In this opinion, the firm stated:

The documents provided by Niko were unorganized, incomplete, and
do not meet the level of documentation needed to conduct a proper
corruption examination.... 545

In the correspondence leading up to the Status Conference on 30
January 2017, the Respondents made an application concerning the

542 Letter to the Respondents’ counsel of 14 October 2016.

543 Table attached to the Respondents’ letter of 31 March 2017, response to item 4.

appointment of a financial expert by the Tribunals. In their letter of 26
January 2017 they wrote:

Specifically, Respondents maintain that the Tribunals should
reconsider, as envisaged in Procedural Order No. 15, [...] ordering
Claimant to open its financial records for the entire relevant period
(2001-2006) to review by an independent financial expert.5*©

The Claimant observed that the Respondents had produced extensive
financial records of third parties but not tendered any report from a
forensic expert. The Claimant added that it did not see any justification
why it should commission such a forensic expert concerning its own
records. Concerning the Respondents’ complaint about the insufficiency
of the records on Niko’s payments which it produced, the Claimant
asserted that the Respondents did not argue that channels of payment
other than those indicated by the Claimant were used; rather they
questioned the Claimant’s explanations concerning the use of the funds
transferred to Bangladesh.

The Respondents confirmed that, other than the note by Duff & Phelps,
their experts had not produced any opinion on the documents disclosed
by the Claimant. They maintained their position that the Claimant had
not provided the information that would be necessary for experts to
conduct an analysis of possible corruption emanating from Niko’s
accounts. 547

On the same occasion, the Respondents made an application on 14
March 2017, requesting that the Tribunals order the production of the
following groups of documents:

i “Documents from the criminal investigation”, specifically records
g' P' Ly
“pertaining to the ACC, Canadian or U.S. investigations of Niko’s
activities in Bangladesh’;

(ii) various financial records;

(iii) documents the production of which had been requested and, in
part ordered previously but were not produced or produced only
incompletely by the Claimant;

547 Summary Minutes of the Status Conference, 30 January 2017, paragraph 10.3.

268

924.

925.

926.

(iv) a new list of correspondence and other documents concerning a
number of subjects, described as “key to Niko’s corrupt scheme in
Bangladesh’.

This request and the Tribunals’ decision in response in Procedural Order
No 18 were referred to above in Section 2.4.11. The decisions can be
summarised as follows:

With respect to the request concerning the criminal investigation and the
Joint Investigation, the Tribunals held:

The Tribunals note that the vast majority of these records or copies
therof are in Bangladesh. Important documents from this record have
been produced by the Respondents in these arbitrations. The
Respondents have not made any efforts to identify with any
specificity documents which are relevant and material for the
Tribunals’ decisions and to which they do not have access.

In these circumstances, the Tribunals see no justification for ordering
the Claimant to produce the requested records.°48

Concerning financial records, the Tribunals considered the evidence
from the witness statements of Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte Griffith,
testifying that the Joint Investigation included extensive examination of
the financial transactions of the Niko Group. They concluded in
Procedural Order No 18:

On the basis of the evidence and considerations set out above, the
Tribunals have concluded that the Respondents have shown access
to the results of this investigation or, at least, have failed to
demonstrate that they made diligent efforts to gain such access. They
have indeed shown by some of the evidence produced with their
submissions on the Corruption Issue that at least some of the evidence
now requested from the Claimant was in their possession.

In these circumstances, the Tribunals see no justification to order the
Claimant to produce documents of a type that had been made
available already by the Niko Group and others during the course of
the joint investigation and of which at least the “vast majority” is in
the possession of the Bangladesh authorities and available to the
Respondents.*49

269

927.

928.

With respect to the Respondents’ request concerning allegedly
incomplete compliance with requests and orders for document
production, the Tribunals organised in Procedural Order No 18 an
exchange to determine with specificity the allegedly incomplete
productions. In the course of this exchange the Respondents presented a
list on 31 March 2017 of documents which the Claimant had produced
directly to the Respondents on 14 October 2016. The list identified the
documents produced by the Claimant as follows:

e 10 documents related to Niko’s retainer with Moudud Ahmed,
payments and legal opinions from his law firm between 2000 and
2003;

e 11 NRBL Board Minutes from 2000 to 2003;
e 11 NRL Board Minutes from 2001 to 2004;

° 73 “financials” documents dated2001-2004, consisting of many
one-page bank statements and wire transfer requests, as well as
limited financial statements and vendor invoices

¢ S IDEAS reports dated 2002 to 2004;
¢ 13 “agreement? documents dated between 1998 and 2005; and

e 14 “correspondence” documents dated between 1998 and 2008.

The Respondents described the 73 financial documents in this list in the
following terms:

The 73 documents include 22 wire transfers between Niko entities
and between Niko and Stratum or Qasim Sharif. They also include
just four expense reports, one which mentions $1,090 spent on gifts
to Petrobangla and Ministry officials on a trip to Texas, but without
attaching receipts or further information. The 73 documents include
one email from Qasim Sharif (regarding the $2.93 million to be paid
in October 2003) and one journal voucher. It is unclear how these
particular 73 documents were selected, but they are clearly not all the
responsive financial documents, as indicated by Duff & Phelps. “The
documents provided by Niko to date, including Niko’s financial
statements, bank statements, wire transfer requests and limited
vendor invoices could not be used on their own to trace ‘all payments
to Bangladesh made by any of the companies of the Niko Group.”
Memo from Duff & Phelps to Foley Hoag (22 Nov. 2016), p. 2. For
example, “[eJvery bank statement should be accompanied by copies

270

929.

930.

931.

of cancelled checks, at the very least. We would also expect to see
copies of all invoices used to generate checks and wire transfer
requests, of which there were hundreds listed in the statements
provided.” 55°

The Claimant replied on 7 April 2017. Referring to the undertakings set
out in its letter of 8 August 2016, the Claimant asserted that it had fully
complied with the agreement and had

... disclosed all documents it was able to identify as falling within the
above description that are in its possession or control. This included,
but was not limited to: complete bank records for the Targeted Period;
the pertinent data from IDEAs accounting software respecting the
Targeted Period, as well as underlying transactional support (such as
invoices, vouchers and cheques where available) for any payments
over US$5,000 dollars. With respect to the US$5,000 threshold, as
Niko pointed out in its letter of 9 December 2016...°°!

The matter was discussed at the Pre-Hearing Conference on 10 April
2017 and the conclusion recorded in the Summary Minutes. The
Tribunals then addressed the issue in Procedural Order No 19 of 15 April
2017:

The Tribunals have taken note that the Respondents, having
considered the Claimant’s letter of 7 April 2017, confirm their view
that the Claimant’s document production was incomplete but see no
need for further submissions on the topic. The Tribunals reserve their
position concerning the question whether the production was complete
and, if they consider it incomplete, reserve the conclusions that may
be drawn from it.552

Concerning the new list of correspondence and other documents
requested by the Respondents on 14 March 2017, reproduced above in
Section 2.4.11, the Tribunals noted that the requests had a “very broad
scope”; some failed to identify documents with specificity but instead
described subjects of enquiry, yet others were of doubtful relevance — or
seemed to be available in Bangladesh. Having considered the Parties’
submissions and the evidence produced about the joint investigation, the
Tribunals concluded that the subject areas identified by the

550 Table attached to the Respondents’ letter of 31 March 2017, Footnote x.
551 Claimant's letter of 7 April 2017, pp. 4-5.
582 Procedural Order No 19, paragraph 20.

271

Respondents’ list of the new production request must also have been
considered by the Joint Investigation. They saw

. no justification to initiate now, one year after the Corruption Issue
had been raised by the Respondents, such measures which, at best,
would be duplicative of the joint investigation performed by
organisations of incomparably greater means of investigation.5°4

8.5 Are there gaps in the evidence available?

932.

933.

934.

As explained above, the Tribunals sought from early on in the
proceedings to identify persons who could testify about the negotiations
and conclusion of the two Agreements and possible corruption influence
in the process. In the course of the efforts in this direction, key persons
were indeed identified, both on the side of Niko and on the side of the
Respondents and the Government.

As it turned out, most of these key persons were not available to testify.
As a substitute for testimony before the Tribunals, the Respondents
presented records of interrogations of some of these persons, in some
cases together with a video recording of the interrogation. They also
presented two of the principal investigators, Ms LaPrevotte and Mr Khan
and two documents from the third, Corporal Duggan, providing
information about what they, or members of their team had heard from
some of the key persons.

The Tribunals mention here the following records:

(i) Concerning Mr Qasim Sharif:

e Interrogation by Corporal Duggan and Corporal Schoepp on 16
December 2010 (Exhibit R-333);

« Redacted copy of an interrogation by the FBI on 15 May 2008 of
an unidentified person, presumably Mr Sharif and his wife
(Exhibit R-327).

(ii) Concerning Mr Gias Uddin Al-Mamoon:

553 Procedural Order No 18, paragraph 121.

272

935.

936.

e Interrogation by Corporal Duggan and Corporal Schoepp on 1
and 2 November 2008 (Exhibits R-316 and R-352), also audio
recording.

(iii) Concerning Mr Selim Bhuiyan:

e Form of Recording confessions of statement under section 164 of
the Code of Criminal Procedure before Metropolitan Magistrate,
dated 15 January 2008 (Exhibit R-324);

« “Information Revealed Regarding Corruption in the Energy Sector
(Niko/ Chevron) — in Selim Bhuiyan interview”, undated (Exhibit R-
317);

°« “Withdrawal of confessionary under section 164 given against my
will on 15.01.2008” dated 8 June 2008, (Exhibit C-120 and C-
215).

e Prayer for withdrawal of Special Case No. 16 of 2008, dated 19
April 2009, (Exhibit C-217)

(iv) Concerning Mr Syed Rezwamul Kabir:

e “Interview” by Corporal Duggan, Sergean Kriwokon and Flight
Lieutenant Khan of the ACC, video and transcript, 23 October
2008 (Exhibit R-368).

(v) Concerning Md Shafikul Islam:

« “Witness deposition as per Section 164 of the Cr.P.C.”, dated 12
March 2008 (Exhibit R-302).

The testimony thus recorded has not been tested in adversarial
proceedings before the present Tribunals nor, as far as these Tribunals
are aware, before any court. The testimony is the result of interrogations,
in most of the cases, by persons whose task it is to discover corruption
and, as in relating to the work of Ms LaPrevotte, is also the basis for asset
recovery. In order to provide reliable evidence, the persons must appear
as witnesses in adversarial proceedings and representatives of the person
or entity against which the testimony is intended to be used must have
an opportunity to question them.

Video recordings of such interrogations, transcripts of such recordings,

and testimony by the interrogating officers may provide interesting
information. This is why the Tribunals have admitted the testimony of Mr

273

937.

Khan and Ms LaPrevotte; they would not have objected if the
Respondents, directly or through the Bangladesh Attorney General,
would have brought Corporal Duggan to testify before them. The
Tribunals also considered the transcripts of such interviews as the
Respondents produced. Such recordings, transcripts and testimony by
the interrogating officer are no substitute, however, for testimony in
adversarial proceedings which respect the principles of due process.
Bearing in mind these limitations in their probative value, the Tribunals
have nevertheless considered these records.

The Respondents asserted that there are records of other relevant
interrogations in the possession of the Canadian authorities to which
they have no access. In their application of 10 February 2017 they sought
to obtain through the Tribunals’ intervention from the Alberta Court of
Queen’s Bench the following order:

1) The RCMP will provide the Tribunals with the following
documents and video recordings obtained or created during the
course of the investigation of Niko and that are still in its
possession:

a. Video of interview of Mr. Qasim Sharif on December 16,
2010 and video and transcript of interview of Mr. Qasim
Sharif on May 20, 2008;

b. Video and transcript of interview of Mr. Selim Bhuiyan;

c. Videos and/or transcripts of interviews of former Chief
Financial Officers mentioned at paragraph 25 of the
Duggan affidavit;

d. Video and/or transcript of March 12, 2009 interview of
former accounting employee mentioned at paragraph 93
of the Duggan affidavit;

e. Video and/or transcript of December 11, 2009 interview
of former employee mentioned at paragraph 115 of the
Duggan affidavit; and

f. Transcripts or videos of other interviews conducted in the
Niko investigation and other evidence of corruption in
obtaining the JVA and GPSA referenced by Corporal
Duggan in his affidavit.

274

938.

939.

940.

2) Corporal Duggan will be examined under oath before the ICSID
Tribunals and counsel for BAPEX and Petrobangla and then
cross examined by counsel for Niko in relation to his
investigation of Niko that led to its conviction on June 24,
2011.554

The Respondents repeated a similar request in their letter of 23 August
2017. They asserted that the material under item 1 in the quoted passage
“is not available in Bangladesh and not available to Respondents from any
source”.

Considering the testimony of Mr Khan about the extent of the cooperation
between the three agencies, the Tribunals concluded that Bangladesh
had the full evidence that was gathered in the course of the Joint
Investigation (see above Section 8.1). The Tribunals therefore have
serious difficulties to believe that the material from the persons included
in the Respondents’ request above was unavailable to the Respondents.
Concerning the evidence which the Respondents sought in Canada, it is
difficult to believe that it was not shared by the RCMP with the ACC. It is
simply not credible, for instance, that the RCMP provided the ACC with
the transcript of Mr Sharif’s interrogation of 16 December 2010 (which
the Respondents obtained and produced in the Arbitrations as Exhibit R-
333, see above); but would refuse to deliver to the ACC the transcript of
the same Mr Sharif of 20 May 2008. Similarly, the Respondents had
access to some of the video recordings and, as listed above, produced
them in the Arbitrations; they provide no explanations why the RCMP
should refuse to deliver such recordings of other interrogations.

In any event, assuming there would have been evidence in Canada not
included in the “common source”, the Respondents have not shown any
attempt to obtain such evidence. They informed the Tribunals in August
2017, long after the Hearing, that, before the Hearing, the Bangladesh
Attorney General had written to the RCMP on 26 March 2017. They have
not produced this letter but it appears from the response to it that the
Attorney General did not seek any evidence but rather authorisation for
Corporal Duggan to appear before these Tribunals at the Hearing in Paris.
The terms of the Attorney General’s letter caused the RCMP to assume
that the Tribunals did “not wish to hear from the RCMP’. There is nowhere

554 Respondents’ Letter of 10 February 2017

943.

any indication that the Attorney General or the Respondents sought any
relevant evidence which had not yet been shared with Bangladesh.

Moreover, there is no indication that the RCMP would have refused a
request for such relevant documents; quite to the contrary, judging from
the testimony of Mr Khan, the RCMP was quite supportive:

I also discussed my participation in this arbitration and my intention
to provide the evidence to the Tribunals with my counterparts at the
RCMP and the Canadian Department of Justice. They had no
objections. To the contrary, they are very supportive of my efforts to
bring the details of Niko’s corrupt activities in Bangladesh to the
attention of an international tribunal considering the matter.555

The Respondents also assert that “the Respondents did not have, and
were not entitled to, the information from the ACC’s criminal
investigation”.55© In support of this assertion, the Respondents wrote:
“The ACC is an independent investigative arm of the Government and does
not share information that it intends to use in pursuing criminal charges in
Bangladesh” .557 Although “Petrobangla and BAPEX were aware that there
was evidence in the ACC proceedings that would demonstrate Niko’s
corruption, it did not have access to that information due to its confidential
nature” 558

This, too, is not plausible. As explained by Mr Khan, the mutual legal aid
cooperation was initiated by the Attorney General;559 the Canadian
evidence was “handed [...] over to the Anti-Corruption Agency, through the
Attorney-General’s office”;5©° the decisions on the international sharing of
the evidence collected was taken by the Attorney General;5®! and it was
the Attorney General who authorised Mr Khan to make the ACC evidence
available for the Arbitrations.5°2 The Government was party to these
Arbitrations. Had the Government wished to rely on the evidence
gathered by the Joint Investigation, this evidence could have been
available in these proceedings. If it was not, this must have been because

the Respondents withheld it or did not make adequate efforts to obtain
it.

The Tribunals, therefore, do not accept that any evidence collected
in the Niko investigations, in Bangladesh, Canada or the U.S., was
unavailable to the Respondents.

This being said, the Tribunals noted some surprising gaps in the
evidence produced in these Arbitrations. As shown above and as will
be seen from the discussion of the facts below, these gaps concerned
documents that appear of critical importance for understanding the
circumstances under which the Agreements were concluded.

The gaps in the evidence also relate to persons directly concerned by the
allegations of corruption, but whose testimony has not been provided in
any form. This concerns in particular:

e Mr Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury: The Respondents assert that Mr
Sharif, through his uncle in Australia, paid bribes to Mr T.E.
Chowdhury.5& The Respondents rely on Ms _ LaPrevotte’s
interrogation of both Mr Sharif and Mr Chowdhur’y brother; but
they did not produce Mr Chowdhury himself, even though he is,
according the Claimant’s repeated and uncontested assertion,
currently the most senior official in the Energy Ministry; nor did
the Respondents produce a written statement from Mr T.E.
Chowdhury.

e The Respondents accuse Barrister Moudud Ahmed, Law
Minister in 2003, of irregularities when his Ministry issued the
legal opinions, decisive for the adoption of the JVA. Mr Ahmed is
included as one of the accused in the ACC Charge Sheet and
must have been interrogated in Bangladesh; the Respondents did
not produce any trace of a statement by him.

e The Respondents accuse Mr AKM Mosharraf Hossain, the State
Minister, to have taken bribes from Mr Bhuiyan for the approval
of the JVA; they produce the record of Mr Bhuiyan’s Confession,
but no statement from Mr Hossain, even though Mr Hossain is
one of the accused on the ACC Charge Sheet.

563 See below Section 11.2.

277

947.

948.

949.

e The Respondents accuse Begum Khaleda Zia of having taken
bribes through Mr Mamoon for the approval of the JVA; the
Respondents have produced transcripts of interrogations of Mr
Mamoon, but no record of any statements on the subject from
Begum Khaleda Zia.

e The Respondents accuse Mr Sharif to have bribed Mr Raihanul
Abedin and thereby procured the GPSA; they describe him as “an
important figure in the JVA and the GPSA approval process”.564
The Respondents produce transcripts of the persons alleging to
have delivered the money to Mr Abedin; they informed the
Tribuals that Mr Abedin is unwilling to appear as witness; but
they produce no record of his interrogation, which one would
expect to have taken place if he had taken bribes that are said to
have caused the corrupt procurement of the GPSA.

Some of the unavailable evidence may have been included in the evidence
collected by the Joint Investigation; the information provided to the
Tribunals does not allow a determination in this respect. The Tribunals
have, however, examined what conclusions have to be drawn from these
gaps in the evidence.

Inferences and Conclusion on the available evidence

The Claimant and the Respondents alike expressed surprise, and each
complained about the absence of certain evidence to which, in their
opinion, their opponent must have had access. They invited the Tribunals
to draw conclusions from this absence.

When the issue of document production was addressed once again, the
Tribunals, in Procedural Order No 18 of 23 March 2017, instructed
compliance with previous production orders and gave other related
directions. The Tribunals added:

The Tribunals may draw adverse inferences if it appears to them that
the documents so produced by the Claimant are incomplete and
without convincing explanations for missing documents.5°

952.

953.

At the end of the exchange that followed Procedural Order No 19, and the
exchange described above in Section 8.4.2, the Respondents made a
request for the Tribunals to draw adverse inferences from what they
considered the Claimant’s incomplete compliance with the Tribunals
document production orders. In their letter of 17 April 2017, the
Respondents insisted that the Claimant’s responses to the document
production requests were inadequate and requested “that the Tribunals
draw all appropriate adverse inferences against Claimant’. They
described three specific cases justifying such inferences.

The first of these inferences was said to follow from the assumption that
“there was regular email correspondence with Qasim Sharif and that
Claimant retained it and can search it for relevant documents to produce”.
The Respondents referred to the importance of Mr Sharif’s role as Niko’s
primary agent in negotiating the JVA and the GPSA until the end of 2005
and

the fact that the evidence clearly indicates that he executed the
corrupt transactions with Mr. Mamoon, Mr. Bhuiyan, and the State
Minister and paid the bribes on Niko’ s behalf. It is not credible for
Claimant to insist that it has no other relevant communications. If
such communications were exculpatory, Claimant would have put
them in the record. Since it has refused to produce them, Respondents
request that the Tribunals infer that the communications with Qasim
Sharif demonstrate that Niko corruptly obtained the JVA and the
GPSA.

The second request for adverse inferences focussed on the payments
made by Niko to Mr Sharif. The Respondents asserted that:

inferences can be drawn from Niko’s failure to provide accounting for
the millions it paid to procure the JVA. Accordingly, Respondents
request that the Tribunals infer from Niko’ s failure to present these
records that, as demonstrated by Respondents’ evidence, Mr. Sharif
used these funds to pay bribes to acquire the JVA and GPSA.

The third inference concerned the relations with Mr Bhuiyan with respect
to whom the Claimant had produced a letter in assistance for a visa
application. The Respondents argued:

It is not believable that Mr. Bhuiyan had a $1 million agreement to

coordinate Niko’ s meetings with the Government and there were no
other communications either with or about Selim Bhuiyan.

279

Respondents, therefore, ask the Tribunals to infer from Claimant’s
failure to produce further documents that the agreement with Selim
Bhuiyan was to pay bribes to the State Minister of Energy and the
Prime Minister’s office.

954. The Claimant responded on 18 April 2017. It complained about an
alleged failure of the Respondents to comply with an instruction in
Procedural Order No 19 and produce the documents they had received
from the FBI; that issue was resolved at the Hearing when the
Respondents delivered to the Claimant on Day 1 a set of documents of
which the Claimant produced one in the record, Document C-237.

955. Concerning the inferences which the Respondents had requested the
Tribunals to draw, the Claimant referred to Arbitration Rule 34 (2) and
34 (3). The relevant parts of these provisions read as follows:

(2) The Tribunal may, if it deems it necessary at any stage of the
proceeding:

(a) call upon the parties to produce documents, witnesses
and experts [...]

(3) | The parties shall cooperate with the Tribunal in the production
of the evidence and in the other measures provided for in
paragraph (2). The Tribunal shall take formal note of the failure
of a party to comply with its obligations under this paragraph
and of any reasons given for such failure.

956. Relying on this provision, the Claimant argued:

“formal note” can be taken, and an adverse inference drawn, only if
the Tribunal first calls upon a Party to produce evidence and the Party
fails to cooperate with the Tribunal in producing that evidence.

For the reasons set out in Niko’s letter of 7 April 2017 on this topic,
Niko has fully complied with all orders of the Tribunals for the
production of evidence. The failure to cooperate with the Tribunals
required by Rule 34(3) has in no respect been established as to Niko.

[oJ

For the avoidance of doubt, Niko denies the assertions made by the
Respondents concerning the documents in its possession and those
which have been produced. Even putting aside the procedural bar
noted above to the adverse inferences the Respondents seek, the

280

957.

958.

959.

960.

inferences asserted in no way follow from the record here. This will
be a matter for argument at the hearing.

At the Hearing, the Claimant confirmed its assertion that it had produced
all relevant documents available to it:

Niko searched for all of that and Iam confident in terms of what was
available that anything that touched on those matters has been made,
that was within Niko’s records, has been produced.°°®

The Tribunals have considered that inferences as requested require that
(i) a party was called upon to produce documents; that (ii) it failed to do
so and (iii) the Tribunals take note of such failure and the reasons given
for it.

In the present case, the Tribunals repeatedly have called upon both
Parties to produce relevant documents, as summarised in Sections 2.4
and above in this section. The documents actually produced by both
Parties are incomplete in various respects. When discussing the many
factual issues that arise in the context of the Corruption Claim, this will
become quite clear. It can be said here that it is indeed surprising that
there are no or only very few records of communications in the
circumstances on which the Respondents’ three requests are based — just
as it is surprising that the Respondents failed to produce a number of
documents relevant to the case, e.g. the legal opinions of the Law Ministry
which, as will be seen below, are of critical importance to the outcome of
the case or records about interrogations of the persons accused of having
taken bribes.

The Claimant provided explanations for the apparent gaps in the
documents produced, including the passage of time since the events to
which such documents, if they existed, would relate. The Claimant
declared that, with one exception, no other responsive documents are
available. When contesting these declarations, the Respondents rely on
assumptions and not on concrete evidence. The Tribunals are unable to
accept on the basis of these assumptions that the Claimant’s declaration
is incorrect; and all the less so because on the Respondents’ side there
are quite a number of instances where documents that must have existed
were not produced with the explanation that they could not be found.

596 Tr, Day 1, p. 335 (Tarnowsky).

281

961.

962.

963.

The exception just mentioned is the case of the Deloitte Audit, where the
Claimant did not deny the existence and availability of some documents;
but relied on privilege. The Tribunals held in Procedural Order No 22 that
this reliance was justified. The Claimant’s refusal to produce the Deloitte
Audit therefore cannot be held against it.

Assuming that the Tribunals had reached the conclusion that requested
documents were available to the Claimant but not produced, the
Tribunals would have had to consider the evidence that is available to
determine whether the conclusion which, according to the Respondents,
should be drawn from the absence of the document are justified. The
Tribunals set out below their extensive analysis of the facts. In this
analysis, the Tribunals consider the evidence available, including the
gaps in this evidence. At this stage, however, it must be said that the
sweeping conclusions which the Respondents invited the Tribunals to
draw from the unavailable evidence are not justified.

In conclusion, the Tribunals point out again that any gaps in the evidence
that remained at the end of the proceedings are attributable primarily to
the Respondents who insisted through repeated procedural initiatives on
involving the Tribunals in the search for evidence which must be
available in Bangladesh. The Tribunals have not drawn from these
disruptive initiatives inferences adverse to the Respondents. They will
decide the Corruption Claim on the basis of the evidence that was
brought before them.

9 THE GOVERNMENTAL ACTS ALLEGEDLY PROCURED BY
CORRUPTION

964. A central part of the Respondents’ case is the allegation that it was on
instruction of the State Minister that BAPEX entered into the JVA on
terms requested by Niko and that these instructions were the result of
Niko’s bribes to the State Minister. The Tribunals therefore invited the
Respondents’ clarification by the following question in Annex A to
Procedural Order No 20 of 17 May 2017:

The Tribunals understand the Respondents’ position to be that
BAPEX concluded the JVA because it was instructed to do so by the
Minister and that these instructions were procured by corruption. Do
the Respondents rely on any other governmental acts which were
required for the conclusion of the JVA and which were allegedly
procured by corruption?

965. In their First Post-Hearing Submission, the Respondents stated that they
also relied on such other governmental acts. They replied to the
Tribunals’ question as follows:

The answer is yes, there are other governmental acts procured by
corruption for both Agreements. Most notably, Niko needed the
approval of the Prime Minister’s Office, which it procured by
corruption. Corrupt approval from the State Minister or Prime Minister
Khaleda Zia are each individually sufficient to establish Respondents’
claims that the Agreements are void ab initio and that Niko procured
its investment in bad faith and in violation of domestic law and
international public policy. Nevertheless, the other corrupt acts are
additional evidence of Niko’s bad faith and corrupt procurement of the
Agreements. Niko, by paying to influence Government decision-
making, moved “from not being in the race [ ] to get a PSC, to getting
the JVA without competitive bidding” and then obtained the GPSA
after causing two blowouts and bribing the State Minister.5°7

567 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 3 (internal citations omitted).

283

966.

967.

968.

969.

In a footnote, the Respondents added that the “broad term ‘corruption
covers much more than direct payment to the highest government
official’ .5°8

Given this position, the Tribunals’ inquiry will also be a broad one. The
Tribunals will first examine the Governmental acts described by the
Respondents as facilitating the conclusion of the JVA and the GPSA and
the regularity of the process leading to it, including the question whether
the Government’s “approval was not transparent, was mala fide and was
illegal under Bangladeshi law’ .5°° They will then have to identify the
various forms which Niko’s alleged corruption took in obtaining these
Governmental acts and, finally examine specific payments which the
Respondents declare to be suspect.

In their First Post-Hearing Submission the Respondents identify a
number of relevant Government acts and the related corrupt acts. The
Government acts so identified were:

e Approval of Niko’s proposal to be considered as a candidate to
develop marginal fields,

e The Framework of Understanding (FOU),
e The Marginal Fields Procedure,

e The State Minister’s grant of access to Niko, efforts and
instructions to Petrobangla to finalise the JVA covering Chattak
East and to avoid Swiss Challenge and approval of the JVA,

e The Prime Minister’s approval of JVA,

e Finalisation and execution of GPSA.57°

The Parties disagree as to the characterisation of these acts, their
relevance for the eventual conclusion of the Agreements, and the
advantages obtained by Niko through them. The Tribunals will now
examine these issues in respect to each of these acts.

Niko’s Marginal Fields Project and its qualification for having its
proposal considered

A central part of the Respondents’ case is that, when seeking to procure
the JVA and the GPSA, Niko “did not have the technical and financial
capacity to obtain these rights through legitimate procedures”.57! The
Respondents argue that Niko used corrupt means to achieve its
acceptance by the Government, Petrobangla and BAPEX as a competent
partner for the development of marginal/abandoned fields: “the only way
Niko could enter into the oil and gas market in Bangladesh” was “the
promise and payment of bribes” .572

The lack of qualification and even disqualification is frequently asserted
by the Respondents and its witnesses and by authorities in Bangladesh.
Thus, the Respondents state that Niko Canada was “financially and
technically unqualified’,573 “deemed unqualified’;57* or even
“disqualified’.575 Ms LaPrevotte was even more categorical:

. when I went to Bangladesh and I was informed and started my
investigation the first thing I learned is that Arthur Andersen had
deemed Niko unqualified to explore gas in Bangladesh.°76

The basis on which the lack of qualification is asserted is the evaluation
of the bids of Niko Canada for lots 9 and 10 in the 2"4 bid round for PSC
in Bangladesh.5’77 Thus the Respondents state:

It is notable that Niko was not qualified to obtain rights through the
normal PSC procedure in Bangladesh, but through its deal with Five
Feathers and Qasim Sharif, opened up a market for itself to do
“marginal field” development.578

577 Occasionally, reference is also made to the blowouts in 2005; whether the blowouts are indeed a sign of
Niko’s lack of qualification remains to be seen. In any event, they cannot have been a consideration during
the negotiations for the JVA. Indeed, in its June 1998 letter, Niko points out that it “has never had a blow
out in any of the wells it has operated in India or elsewhere.” Letter from Niko to Ministry of Power, Energy
and Mineral Resources, 28 June 1998, Exhibit C-123, p. 2.

578 R-RC, paragraph 108.

973.

976.

Elsewhere the Respondents state:

This movement from not even being in the running in May 1998 to
having the Government agree to deem fields “marginal” and pursue
the company’s proposed project confirms that there was more at play
than simply Niko’s qualification to develop marginal fields.579

The Claimant contests the relevance of the PSC bid evaluation process
and its results. It points out that this was “a fundamentally different
process” relating to twelve large new oil and gas blocks which is “clearly
not a reasonable comparator for Niko’s novel proposal’ for the
development of existing marginal fields, which Petrobangla had itself
explicitly recognised as “a specialty that requires certain unique
companies and their unique ability to control cost’.58° The Claimant also
contests the relevance of the scoring process applied in the evaluation of
the PSC bid58! and concluded:

. it is entirely misleading for the Respondents to use the PSC bid
evaluation results to cast aspersions on Niko’s qualifications,
particularly to undertake a marginal field development project.582

The Tribunals have examined the available evidence concerning Niko’s
ranking in the PSC evaluation in order to determine its relevance for
the assessment of Niko’s qualification for the development and operation
of marginal and abandoned fields.

The evaluation of the PSC bids was addressed in an exchange at the
Hearing between the Claimant’s counsel and Mr Elahi, who was the only
witness who could testify to this issue. He did not participate in this
particular bid evaluation, but had experience with similar, but less
complicated, evaluations.°83 In his witness statement he explained that

579 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 30; for the description of “not even being in the running in May
1998”, the Respondents rely on the message from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade of 11 May 1998, Exhibit C-195.

583 He explained at the Hearing that in 2008 he was involved in another PSC bid process and that then:
“We made it more simpler, during 2008 I did it and evaluation criteria was very simple” (Tr. Day 4
(CONFIDENTIAL), pp. 94 to 95).

he was Managing Director of BAPEX from 5 August 2001 to 9 July 2003.
He then stated:

I learned that Niko had participated in the bid round in late 1990s for
the exploration and development of Block 9, an exploration target, but
Niko was disqualified from the bid process because it was found to
be unqualified for such a project, especially compared with other
international companies bidding for the same fields.58+

At the Hearing he was questioned about the PSC evaluation,5®>5 as
documented in the Arthur Andersen letter of 29 September 1997.586

Concerning the criteria for the evaluation, the letter mentions a
document entitled “Evaluation Criteria for the Assessment of Bids”
(ECAB) that had been sent to the bidders in May 1997. Arthur Andersen
explain that this had not been appreciated by them in their initial
assessment and led them to revise their earlier “thinking and the contents
of the original suggested Scorecard’. Arthur Andersen continued to
explain that, in addition to the ECAB and items relevant for the
evaluation defined in the Letter of Invitation (the “LOI”), its experts were
provided at their return to Bangladesh in September 1997 by the
Chairman of Bangladesh with “a revised Scorecard weighing which had
been developed by the ‘Bid Evaluation Committee”. The review of these
three documents produced a “Description of Suggested Methodology for
Ranking Bids” and a “Scorecard weighing grid” which were attached to
the letter. These have not been produced in the Arbitrations.

The basic criteria for Arthur Andersen’s evaluation of Niko’s bid can
nevertheless be understood from an attachment to their letter: this
attachment shows the score cards for Blocks 9 and 10 which provide the
ranking of the bidders by reference to a number of criteria and their
weighting, the highest weights being given to “Work Commitment’ (45%),
“Financial & Technical’ (15 %), “Cost recovery” (15%) and Petrobangla
share (15%). In Block 9 the highest bidder (Tullow Oil Plc) scored of 80.5
points, while Niko Canada was ranked lowest with 42.9 points. For Block
10, the highest ranked bidder (Shell/Cairn) was rated 91.4 points, while
Nico Canada again ranked lowest with 45.9 points.

984.

In order to determine the relevance and significance of these criteria and
rankings, one should look at the manner in which each of the criteria is
assessed.

The criterion “Work Programme”, which presumably corresponds to “Work
Commitment’ ,587 weighted at 45%, was valued by reference to the number
of wells and their depth (as proposed by the bidder) and the seismic tests.
The Tribunals understand that this criterion measures the investment
which each of the bidders was prepared to make in the development of
the field. They do not see that it includes any assessment of the technical
qualification of the bidder.

“Financial and technical capability” are grouped together and jointly
weighted at 15%. Financial capability is assessed by reference to cashflow
and debt service. Technical capability is assessed simply by the number
of countries, presumably those in which the company is active. While
these criteria may be of some interest in the comparative evaluation of
the bidders, they say little if anything about the qualification for the
development of marginal and abandoned fields. The same must be said
about the other criteria: cost recovery and Petrobangla share.

The Tribunals conclude that the ranking of Niko in the PSC has little if
any relevance with respect to its qualification for the different project it
proposed to the Government of Bangladesh and the Respondents.

As to the relevance of the PSC evaluation for the development of
marginal and abandoned fields, the Respondents have expressed
various views. On some occasions, they stated that there was scant
difference between the two types of activities;585 elsewhere, they said that
developing marginal and abandoned fields could be more complicated
than exploring and developing an unexplored area.58?

587 The values from the Table “Work Programme” are entered in the Score Card in the column “Work
Commitment”.

989.

The Claimant emphasised the difference between the two types of
projects.59° In its June 1998 Proposal, Niko explained that they concern
different stages in the exploitation of gas fields:

... an oil or gas field is considered marginal when producing the field
in the conventional manner becomes uneconomical and impractical
from the existing operator’s view point.

It continued by stating that the criteria for considering a field marginal
varied according to the circumstances and the priorities of the existing
operator:

In the USA the major oil companies routinely sell out producing fields
to small independents when they become marginal and uneconomical
for the majors to operate.

Internationally the prevailing conditions such as availability of cost
effective services, logistic problems and associated costs, political
risks, local expertise, project implementation time frame, market
conditions and market proximity among other issues determine to
great extent if the field is marginal or prospective.5?!

Fields that have become marginal and uneconomic for the large
producers moreover require different technologies in their development
and operation.592

Niko’s project for marginal fields development also differed from the PSC
bids in the manner in which it was presented. In the case of the PSC bids,
Petrobangla prepared the project, identified the fields to be offered for the
bid round, and elaborated the bidding procedure and contract
conditions. It did so with the assistance of an international specialist,
Arthur Andersen, which as described above assisted Petrobangla in the
elaboration of the methodology for ranking bids and evaluating them.

In the case of Niko’s proposal, it was Niko Canada that had taken the
initiative, identified potential fields, and presented the technology for
exploiting abandoned gas fields which Bangladesh had neither the

intention nor the means of bringing back on stream. Niko thus proposed
to develop at its own cost and risk resources which the Government of
Bangladesh had considered uneconomical to develop but which, in view
of the need for gas in Bangladesh, were important to develop. Mr
Chowdhury testified that, to his knowledge, the contract proposed JVA
with Niko was not “a typical Government contract’ and there was “no
precedent for this contract’ 59

990. Finally, the Tribunals have examined how the Respondents themselves
assessed Niko’s proposal and its qualifications at the time. When
Niko proposed the project, the Respondents took a view of it and of Niko’s
qualification which is quite different from their statements in the
Arbitrations. This is demonstrated for instance in Petrobangla’s 1998
Comments, which it prepared after having received BAPEX’s comments
on the June 1998 Proposal. Petrobangla described the project as follows:

A.2. The Government of Bangladesh has several marginal gas fields
that are presently non-producing such as Chatak, Kamta, Begumganj,
and Feni. Among these Chatak, Kamta & Feni fields were produced
for long periods and were shut-in due to excessive water production
and pressure reduction depletion problems. These fields were not
rehabilitated due to financial constraints and technical limitations
faced by Petrobangla and due to the marginal nature of these fields
and uneconomical investment. In addition the available limited
financial and technical resources of Petrobangla were better utilised
in the exploration, development and production of the more
prospective fields such as Saldanadi, Bakhrabad and Kailashtilla.

A.3. However, the requirement of gas in Bangladesh has continued
to increase, and as the larger fields such as Bakhrabad mature, the
need to rehabilitate the marginal fields should be considered
seriously. These marginal fields still have some salvageable
infrastructure and produc/ible] [ill.] quantum of gas, which will be lost
if they are not rehabilitated with priority. In addition the cost for
drilling and construction services will continue to increase with time
making the rehabilitation of the marginal fields more and more cost
prohibitive and risky.59*

Petrobangla went further, pointing out the advantages of following the
approach to the project proposed by Niko and the attendant benefits to
Bangladesh, Petrobangla and BAPEX, including the following:

C.3. Niko’s straight and clear offer to take BAPEX into a joint venture
(JV) is certainly attractive - especially when a lot of IOC's have
shunned this possibility. Such a JV would surely enhance BAPEX's
reputation and expertise and would also give them an insight into
international operations.

In the Conclusion/Recommendations Petrobangla’s 1998 Comments
contain the following passage:

D.1_ Niko’s ideas are quite novel and a first offer for us ~ containing
some attractive proposals like job creation - expertise growth, extra
production, etc. It should therefore be given due consideration. There
are no risks to Petrobangla even though marginal field development
can become risky and unprofitable if the operator is not extra careful
with costs. We have not much to lose, if anything. we have rather
much to gain if a proper MOU/contract is entered into safeguarding
our basic interests.

The document then recommends “that the Swiss Challenge process be
adopted as proposed by Niko in their offer to ensure transparency in the
award process” and discusses the advantages of this process. Comments
are made concerning the choice of the fields, and the following
observation as to the profitability of the project:

Due to the low costs of this gas the financial benefit gained by
Petrobangla for producing the marginal fields will be higher than gas
produced by the existing PSC contractors from the first bid round.

This assessment differs sharply from the arguments of the Respondents
in the Arbitrations.

The Respondents have expressed the view that these comments by
Petrobangla and BAPEX are “suspect” on a number of grounds®?5 and
have suggested that the Comments in the Minutes of the October 2000
of the Petrobangla Board “are a more accurate depiction of Petrobangla’s
knowledge and view of Niko’s proposal ...”59©

Petrobangla’s 1998 Comments were first produced in the Arbitrations by
the Respondents in their submission Responses to Procedural Odder No
13 of 14 June 2016. In this submission, the Respondents relied on the
Comments and quoted from them to highlight the importance of the
Swiss Challenge process.°97 In later submissions, the Respondents raised
“doubts about the provenance of this document’.598 The Respondents note
that the Comments, contrary to other internal Petrobangla and
Government documents, are in English and “include much of the same
language” as Niko’s proposal. They also point out that Mr Sharif had
obtained a copy of the document and had transmitted it to Niko.599

The Tribunals note that none of these doubts were expressed by the
Respondents when they first produced the Comments and relied on them.
They do not find it surprising that comments on a proposal made in
English are made in the same language. The fact that Mr Sharif obtained
a copy of the document does not speak against its authenticity. The
Tribunals see no reason to doubt that the document reflects the
considered joint opinion of BAPEX and Petrobangla.

The Tribunals add that the Comments were the result of a process of
analysis, instructed by the Ministry and carried out first by BAPEX in a
separate document and then by Petrobangla. To assume that these
Comments were the result of corruption would imply that all contributors
to it, whether on the side of BAPEX or Petrobangla, were corrupted. There
is no indication and not even an allegation that this was actually the case.

Concerning the Respondents’ reference to the Minutes of the October
2000 Petrobangla Board meeting, the Tribunals note that the passages
quoted by the Respondents are taken from the discussion at the
meeting.®°° The Board concluded that it was advisable to proceed with
the Joint Venture Agreement, and sent the draft agreement to the
Ministry for its decision.©°! The record shows that beginning in 1998,
with the approval of Petrobangla and the Ministry, BAPEX negotiated the
terms of the JVA and did not question the qualification of Niko for
performing the work required under the JVA.

1000. Against this background it is important to compare the testimony of the
Respondents’ witnesses in their written witness statements with the
testimony at the Hearing.

1001. Mr Chowdhury’s witness statement affirmed this with respect to what he
had been told by BAPEX and Petrobangla in what seems to have been
early 2002:602

... | was briefed by BAPEX and Petrobangla on Niko’s proposal, and
I became directly involved in the consideration of the project and the
Ministry’s decision on whether it should be approved. I was
concerned when they told me that Niko had been excluded from the
prior bid round for production sharing contracts to develop oil and gas
fields based on its lack of technical capabilities. I understood that
developing marginal and abandoned fields can be more complicated
than exploring and developing an unexplored area. Niko was arguing
it had been successful at one filed in India, but I did not think that
was a sufficient basis to conclude that they should be granted rights
in Bangladesh. I thought it was very important to carefully scrutinise
Niko’s proposal. [...] There were two very important points [ ...] First,
the companies believed it was essential for Niko’s proposal to be
subject to a competitive bidding process. [...] Such bidding was even
more essential with regard to Niko because it had been eliminated in
prior competitive bidding based on its lack of technical and financial
capacity. We needed to make sure we had the most competent and
financially sound company developing our resources.®°3

1002. At the Hearing, the testimony changed: rather than causing concern, the
explanations Mr Chowdhury received were reassuring:

When Petrobangla and BAPEX assured me that Niko has the
competence to explore or conduct this exploration in marginal gas
fields, I did not question their technical findings.

... they told me that Niko was not found technically qualified in the
production sharing contract offers, but they assured me that what

602 Mr Chowdhury does not give a precise indication with respect to time; but he explains that in February
2002 he was posted to the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources as Acting Secretary of Energy
and Mineral Resources Division and that almost as soon as he had been posted to this position, Mr Sharif
came to visit him and that not long after that visit the above quoted statements were made to him
(Chowdhury Witness Statement, paragraphs 2, 6 and 7).

603 Chowdhury Witness Statement, paragraph 7.

293

technical qualification Niko has, that is sufficient for the exploration of
the marginal gas fields and possibly that their Indian success was
one of the primary basis that they considered them technically fit.©°4

1003. It should be recalled that in his witness statement, Mr Chowdhury had
testified, as quoted above, that, in his understanding, “developing
marginal and abandoned fields can be more complicated than exploring
and developing an unexplored area”.©°> At the Hearing Mr Chowdhury
confirmed that this was different from the work done under production
sharing contracts. Mr Chowdhury added that from discussions with
BAPEX and Petrobangla he understood the following:

So to extract gas from those marginal fields may be difficult than
exploring from the virgin fields. But later, they made me understand
that smaller companies may be found more efficient to explore those
and more commercially viable.©°©

1004. The Tribunals conclude that Niko’s June 1998 Proposal was welcomed
by the Respondents as an economically interesting contribution to
the supply of gas in Bangladesh. From the evidence produced, the
Tribunals are of the view that the low ranking in the PSC bid does not
justify any conclusions about Niko’s qualification for the work under the
proposed JVA and the Respondents had no serious concerns about this
qualification. The evidence does not support the Respondents’
assertion quoted above according to which “the only way Niko could
enter into the oil and gas market in Bangladesh” was “the promise
and payment of bribes”.

1005. The Respondents argue that corruption occurred by

- Sharfuddin Ahmed’s efforts to earn US$1 million success fee,
including spending $100,000 on ‘incidentals’ to get the FoU approved.

- Mr. Sharif’s payments to lower level officials at Ministry of Energy

- Mr. Sharif’s payments of US$54,000 to the brother of the then-
Secretary of Energy.®°”

Suspect Payments (see Sections 10.3.2, 11.2 and 11.3).

9.2 The Government’s decision to proceed with the Niko project

1007. On 26 January 1999 a high-level meeting was held at the “Ministry of
Electricity, Fueling and Minerals”, chaired by the Secretary of the
Department and attended, inter alia, by four Deputy Secretaries and a
Senior Assistant Secretary, the Chairman and two Directors of
Petrobangla, and the Managing Director and General Manager of BAPEX.
Niko’s proposal was presented and discussed. The representative of
Petrobangla pointed out that it was “not possible to develop [marginal and
non-producing fields] by the conventional method” and that “ijf the
salvageable gas is not recovered soon it will not be possible
collected/ drawn by cost-effective method”. The Minutes record that, after
“details discussion’, the following decision was taken:

4) At the preliminary stage as per proposal of Niko Resource the
gas fields of Chatak, Kamta and Feni considering as marginal gas
filed [sic] development might be developed and produced the gas.

5) Before signing the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)
between BAPEX & Niko the joint venture agreement shall have to be
finalized. In this respect the Managing Director of BAPEX may discuss
with Niko.

6) In respect of development and producing gas from these gas
fields the Swiss Challenge Method might be abided by.®°8

1008. The Respondents generally refer to a letter of 25 May 1999 as the
expression of the Government’s decision to proceed with the Niko
project.®°9 There is, however, no explanation about the form in which this
decision was taken or by whom. In particular, there is no explanation
about the steps, if any, that were taken between the decision at the
meeting chaired by the Ministry on 26 January 1999 and the letter of 25
May 1999.

1009. In the letter of 25 May 1999 the Ministry informed Petrobangla of the

Government’s decision on the “Implementation of proposal of Niko
Resources for Marginal Gas Fields Development and Production”. The
letter responds to a letter from Petrobangla of 31 December 1998 which
has not been produced.

1010. The Ministry’s letter reads as follows:

Regarding the subject matter above, it is being informed that the
Government has taken the following decision after examining the
proposal of NIKO Resources for Marginal Gas Field Development and
Production:

a) On the basis of the proposal of Niko Resources, the gas fields at
Chatak, Kamta and Feni may be developed and produced under the
concept of “Marginal Gas Field Development” under joint collaboration
of Niko and BAPEX.

b) Joint Venture Agreement between BAPEX and Niko will have to
be finalised before signing of the Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) with Niko Resources.

o) Thereafter, steps may be taken to implement the proposal
prepared by Niko and BAPEX, after evaluation by using the Swiss
Challenge method, if necessary.

2. You are requested by order of the appropriate authority to take
necessary action in order to implement that proposal.®!°

1011. This letter was already produced during the Jurisdiction phase of these

proceedings, but with a different translation:

On the above referenced matter it is notified that after examining the
proposal of Niko Resources on Marginal Gas Field Development,
Government has made the following decisions:

e The gas fields Chattok [sic], Kamta and Feni may be developed
in the “Marginal Gas Field Development’ system as per the
proposal of Niko Resource.

« A Joint Venture Agreement must be executed between Bapex
and Niko before a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) is

610 Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy, and mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 25 May 1999, Exhibit R-

270.

296

signed with Niko. The Managing Director of Bapex can conduct
discussions with Niko regarding this.

*¢ The ‘Swiss Challenge’ method may be adopted for developing
the said gas fields.

You are requested to take necessary next steps for implementation of
the proposal.®!!

1012. Although Niko’s June 1998 Proposal is not expressly mentioned, there is
no doubt that it is this proposal to which both the BAPEX letter and the
Government’s decision refer. In any event, the Government’s decision
clearly specifies the essential elements of the proposal in the
communication to Petrobangla. These elements include the development
of the “gas fields at Chatak, Kamta and Feni [...] under the concept of
‘Marginal Gas Field Development”, a joint venture between Niko and
BAPEX and “using the Swiss Challenge method, if necessary”.

1013. The letter does not specify when and how this decision by the
Government was taken and whether any steps subsequent to the above-
mentioned high-level meeting on 26 January 1999 had been taken. It is,
however, possible that the Government’s decision had been taken earlier,
since in a letter of 6 May 1999 BAPEX communicated to Niko that a
decision to form a joint venture between Niko and BAPEX had been made.

1014. In a letter to BAPEX of 1 February 1999, referring to the past
correspondence with the Ministry and Petrobangla, Niko Canada had
stated that it was “keen to have your assistance as our proposed joint
venture partner in getting a feedback from Petrobangla and/or the MOEMR
regarding status of our application.” BAPEX responded on 6 May 1999:

1. With reference to the above letter, this is to inform you that it
has been decided in principle to formulate a Joint Venture Agreement
between BAPEX and Niko Resources LTD for the development of
Marginal & Non-producing Gas-Field that is Chattak, Kamta and Feni.

2. In view of the above you are requested to send your authorised

possible.

3. Please note that this letter is issued WITHOUT ANY PREJUDICE
and any obligation on the part of BAPEX.®!?

The Tribunals conclude that, during the period between 26 January and
25 May 1999, possibly before 6 May 1999, the Government decided to
proceed with the Niko project. According to the Respondents, the terms
of this decision are expressed in the Ministry’s letter to Petrobangla of 25
May 1999. There is no indication that the Government’s decision as
recorded in that letter was communicated to Niko in terms other than
those of the letter of 6 May 1999.

The Framework of Understanding (FOU) or the Study Contract

Following BAPEX invitation of 6 May 1999, the Executive Chairman of
Niko Canada travelled to Dhaka. The meetings that then took place did
not lead to the conclusion of a MOU or the JVA in the form envisaged by
the Government’s decision. Instead a different approach was adopted.

This modified approach took the form of the Framework of Understanding
(FOU) providing for a study performed jointly by Niko and BAPEX at the
cost of Niko; this agreement is sometimes also referred to as the “Study
Contract”.

The change in approach is documented in the FOU and in a letter of 12
August 1999 from the Ministry to Petrobangla with copy to BAPEX,
approving the FOU.°®!5 The letter refers to a letter from Petrobangla of 30
June 1999, which has not been produced, and identifies as its subject
“Regarding the Approval of the Proposal of Niko Resources on Marginal Gas
Field Development and Production”. The text of the letter reads as follows:

In light of the above subject and reference it is to inform that before
signing the MOU regarding Marginal Gas Field Development between

BAPEX and Niko Resources, technical evaluation of the Non-
Producing Marginal gas fields is required to complete the joint study.

02. In this respect approval is given as directed to complete the
Framework of Understanding.

The circumstances that brought about the change in approach are not
documented by contemporaneous evidence; in particular, the
Respondents have not produced any minutes of meetings of their
respective boards or committees nor any correspondence between them
explaining the reasons for the change.

There is, however, subsequent correspondence that sheds some light on
the change:

e In their opinion of 1 November 2000, Po state

that on 30 June 1999 “Petrobangla proposed a joint study to be
undertaken by BAPEX and NIKO in the relevant gas fields for technical
evaluation which was approved by MEMR’.°!4

e Ina letter of 5 April 2001 to the Secretary at the Ministry, Mr Ohlson
on behalf of Niko explained:

During these preliminary discussions between Bapex and Niko it
appeared that the modality and the basis of how the JVA would be
structured was not very clear to every one. Therefore Bapex proposed
that instead of formulating a JVA agreement, a joint technical study
should first be concluded to form the basis for a JVA.®15

e On 26 February 2003, Mr Sampson on behalf of Niko wrote to the
State Minister:

In May, 1999, we were invited by Bapex, upon approval of and [sic]
instructions from the Government of Bangladesh, to finalize the Joint
Venture Agreement, but instead after we arrived in Dhaka, we were
asked to do a feasibility study at our cost. Niko relented ...°16

These explanations have not been contradicted by the Respondents and
no evidence to the contrary has been presented. The Tribunals conclude
that the change in approach was introduced at the request of the
Respondents and to their advantage.

The FOU is the first agreement executed between Niko and one of the
Respondents. It reflects an approach that differs from that originally
proposed by Niko. No information has been provided about the reasons
and objectives which led the Respondents to this change in approach.
Nor is there any information available about the question whether and to
what extent the Government and the Respondents, by requiring the
execution of the Study Contract, had changed their mind about the
approach to the implementation of the Niko Proposal. In other words,
prior statements of the Government and the Respondents as well as
Niko’s proposal itself must be considered with caution. They are relevant
for determining the Parties’ obligations only to the extent that they are
relevant to this first agreement and the approach which the Parties
adopted in it.

The content of the FOU has been described above in Section 4.1. The
critical terms, relevant for the present decision, are the rights and
obligations the FOU created for the further implementation of the Project
and the procedure to be followed once the Study had been completed.

The general objective of the FOU is, as indicated in its title, “the
Development & Production of Hydrocarbons from the Non-Producing
Marginal Gas Fields of Chattak, Feni and Kamta’; the feature addressed
specifically in the agreement is the Study for this development and
production.

The FOU defines the “Area” to which the agreement applies by reference
to Exhibit A to the FOU which sets out the “Coordinates of the Ring
Fencing of Chattak, Feni and Kamta Structures”, showing coordinates,
area (in square kilometres) and depth (in meters). The Parties disagree as
to whether the development and production was intended to apply to the
fields so defined by the coordinates or whether, within these fields, only
that part was intended which would qualify as “non-producing marginal
gas field’. The issue will be considered below in Section 9.5.

The FOU also provides that “on successful completion of the Technical
Program & on the basis of the acceptability of the result thereof the parties
would execute a Joint Venture Agreement’. The Parties disagree whether
this clause gave Niko a right to the conclusion of a joint venture for the
development and production of the fields provided only that the results

300

1027.

1028.

1029.

of the technical programme were acceptable, or whether in any event the
Swiss Challenge method had to be applied before a Joint Venture
Agreement between BAPEX and Niko could be concluded. The
Respondents rely primarily on Article 7.01 which qualifies the
confidentiality obligations by adding “if swiss challenge process is
adopted, this is not applicable”; Claimant argues that the provision does
not prescribe a Swiss Challenge process but simply determines the effect
of the confidentiality obligations in case the process is applied.

The FOU contains the clear provision that, upon agreement on the terms
of the JVA, the Parties shall “execute” the JVA. In other words, if
agreement on these terms is reached, the JVA will be executed. The
question whether the FOU defines the Chattak Field as including Chattak
East, and confirms an agreement to resort to the Swiss Challenge method
prior to signature, will be discussed below in Sections 9.5 and 9.6.

The Respondents also argue that the FOU still required Government
approval.®!” They rely on Article 12.5, which states: “/t/he effectiveness of
the contract will be subject to the approval of the appropriate authority”.
The Claimant relies on the reference to the “approval accorded by the
government in 1999”, as contained in the Marginal Fields Procedure; they
assert that this expression clearly refers to the FOU.®!8 The Respondents
reply that “Niko has not shown that the Government ever issued a specific
approval of the FOU’.°19

The Claimant points out that “the totality of the record [...] demonstrates
that no agreement of any substance gets executed by BAPEX without the
prior approval of Petrobangla and the Government’.°?° The Tribunals
would indeed find it most surprising that the FOU was concluded,
followed by the Marginal Fields Procedure and mentioned in subsequent
meetings®?! and correspondence without there having been the “approval
of the appropriate authority”, as required by its Clause 15.05.

1032.

Indeed, the letter which the Ministry addressed to Petrobangla on 12
August 1999 expressly states: “ijn this respect approval is given as
directed to complete the Framework of Understanding.”©2? In the meetings
where the FOU was referred to it was not contested that approval had
been given. For instance, the Minutes of the 333 Petrobangla
Management Committee Meeting held on 22 July 2003 expressly
confirmed that, by the letter of 12 August, the Ministry had approved the
execution of the FOU:

In response to the proposal the ministry approved the execution of the
Framework of Understanding (FOU) between BAPEX and Niko vide
letter No. Resou: 22/97/290 of 12 August 1999. As per the approval,
a Framework of Understanding (FOU) was signed between BAPEX
and Niko for evaluation of Chattak, Feni and Kamta gas fields.®3

Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunals conclude that the FOU was
duly concluded without any formal defect.

The Respondents argue, however, that the FOU was also procured by
corruption. In support of this allegation, they list the same acts as those
in relation to Niko’s qualifications for the proposed project; the Tribunals
will address these allegations below.

9.4 The Marginal Fields Procedure

1033.

1034.

The Procedure for the Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields
(the “Marginal Fields Procedure” or simply the “Procedure”) was
adopted in June 2001. A copy is attached to the JVA as Annex C. The
Procedure appears to be the first regulation in Bangladesh of the
development of this type of gas fields.

In its Clause 4.4, the Procedure deals expressly with the processing of
“offers received prior to the adoption of these procedures”. For these cases
it requires “appraisal by a technical committee appointed by Petrobangla”,
and “after appraisal” the conclusion of a joint venture agreement with a
Petrobangla company, “forwarded to the Government for approval’.

623 Extracts from the Agenda of 333" Petrobangla’s Managing Committee Meeting, 22 July 2003, Exhibit
C-11, paragraph 1.

302

1035. Clause 10 of the Procedure, entitled “Explanatory Note”, concerns
specifically the Chattak, Kamta and Feni gas fields. It states that these
fields “shall be deemed to have been declared marginal/ abandoned gas
fields’. The clause brings the “negotiations/discussions conducted so far
with the approval accorded by the government in 1999” in line with the
newly adopted Procedure and declares that these negotiations and
discussions “shall be deemed to have been in compliance with the above
procedure”.

1036. The Respondents argue: “/tjo proceed with the JVA, the Government
needed a system for identifying marginal/ abandoned fields.” They quote
Mr Elahi’s testimony: “/fofnce you declare some field as marginal or
abandoned you can invite the foreign companies or any private company
to develop it [...]”.©24 They disagree that the reference in clause 10 extends
to Chattak East, arguing that the Procedure “does not define which
structures were to be included in the JVA - it did not include Chattak
East’.©25 Elsewhere the Respondents argue that the Procedure “excluded
Chattak East from its purview”, ®?© relying on what, according to clause
1.2 of the Procedure, “may be termed marginal/ abandoned’.

1037. In the Claimant’s view, the Procedure established that the Chattak,
Kamta, and Feni_ fields were properly characterised as
marginal/abandoned, and that this concerned the entire field, including
both Chattak West and Chattak East.°?? The Claimant also sees in the
Procedure confirmation that the Swiss Challenge procedure was not
applicable: “any lingering notion that Swiss Challenge was necessary prior
to approving the JVA was put to rest by the passing of the Marginal Field
Procedure in 2001.”628

1038. The Procedure was adopted by the Awami League Government of Sheikh
Hasina and there is no allegation of any irregularity in its adoption. The
Respondents, nevertheless, include the Procedure among the
Government acts procured by corruption. They associate the corruption
allegation for the Procedure with the two acts which have just been
discussed; it shall therefore be dealt with below in the same context.

9.5 The Chattak Field and the inclusion of Chattak East

1039. The principal “roadblock” in the negotiations of the JVA were the
definition of the contract area with respect to the Chattak Field (the
“Chattak issue”) and the question whether Swiss Challenge was
required. The former of these two issues appears to have been by far the
more contentious one.

1040. With respect to the Chattak issue, the differences between the Parties
during the negotiations and in the Arbitrations concerned two matters:
(i) whether the Chattak Field must be considered a single entity, and as
such characterised as “marginal/ abandoned’; or as two blocks, of which
Chattak West was marginal/abandoned and Chattak East was a virgin
field considered as an “exploration target’; and (ii) whether it had been
validly agreed in the FOU and confirmed in the Marginal Fields Procedure
that the JVA would cover the entire Chattak Field.

1041. From the evidence in the record, the Tribunals conclude that the dispute
was close to being resolved by early July 2001; it was then finally resolved
in March 2003, when BAPEX proposed to submit the issue to the Law
Ministry and that Ministry opined that the Chattak Field had to be
understood according to the coordinates in Exhibit A to the FOU. Asa
result of this opinion, BAPEX was instructed to conclude the JVA for a
contract area including Chattak West and Chattak East. The
Respondents assert that in order to break the “impasse” in the JVA
negotiations due to the Chattak issue the Claimant used corruption®29
and that “Niko was only able to get [Chattak East] included [in the JVA] by
making its deals to pay Mr Mamoon, State Minister Mosharraf Hossain,
and Mr Bhuiyan’” .©30

9.5.1 The identification of the Chattak Gas Field until the completion of
MFE

1042. In the initial correspondence reference is made to the Chattak Gas Field,
without a distinction between West and East. Niko’s proposal of June
1998 refers to the “Marginal and Non-Producing Gas Fields Development

630 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 178.

and Production: Chattak’; and the Ministry’s letter of 25 May 1999,
expressing the Government’s decision to proceed with Niko’s project,
refers simply to the “gas fields at Chattak, Kamta and Feni...”.

1043. The historic situation of the field was notably described in the Marginal
Fields Evaluation, dated February 2000, that is to say the study
produced further to the FOU, where it is pointed out that the Chattak
field was discovered in 1959 and produced until 1985 when Petrobangla
shut it down due to “increased water production”. Some further details
are provided in Niko’s letter of 3 March 2003,63! which points out that
the Chattak Gas Field is situated within the area of the PSC for Block 12
but does not form part of it and is defined as an excluded area.®°? This is
uncontested.

1044. It is also uncontested that the Eastern part of the Chattak field is
separated from the Western part by a fault and that it had not been
explored. The Eastern part, nevertheless, was not considered as a
separate gas field. Niko made this quite clear to BAPEX in its letter of 1
February 1999 when it referred to

... the high risk Chattak field where more than 80% of the gas reserves
are expected in the unexplored and un-drilled high risk side of
fault.633

1045. BAPEX responded on 6 May 1999, expressly referred to this letter and
expressed no reservation concerning the “unexplored and un-drilled’ side
of the field:

With reference to your [1 February 1999] letter, this is to inform you
that it has been decided in principle to formulate a Joint Venture
Agreement between BAPEX and NIKO RESOURECES LTD for the
development of Marginal & Non producing Gas Field that is Chatak,
Kamta and Feni.®3+

The Ministry, too, made no distinction between East and West Chattak.
For instance, in its letter of 25 May 1999 to Petrobangla and BAPEX, as
quoted above, it wrote:

On the basis of the proposal of Niko Resources, the gas fields at
Chatak, Kamta, and Feni may be developed and produced under the
concept of “Marginal Gas Field Development” under joint collaboration
of Niko and BAPEX.®5

The JVA negotiations that followed this letter and the role of the Chattak
issue in them have been summarised above in Section 4.1. The following
details are added for a better understanding how the “impasse” arose and
how it was overcome.

On 23 August 1999, the FOU was concluded between BAPEX and Niko.
The FOU refers to Chattak without distinguishing between East and
West. It defines the “Area” by reference to a map (which has not been
produced) and a table showing the coordinates of the three fields. This
table forms “Exhibit A” to the FOU and is attached to the JVA, as
produced in the Arbitrations. It is entitled “Coordinates of the ring fencing
of Chattak, Feni and Kamta Structures”. The coordinates for the “Chattak
Gas Field” include the entire Chattak Field without distinction between
East and West.

The study which BAPEX and Niko agreed to perform as provided for in
the FOU, described as the Marginal Fields Evaluation,®°° was completed
in February 2000. The Study provides a description of the geological
setting of the “three fields Chattak, Feni and Kamta’, followed by more
detailed descriptions concerning each of the fields. In the table showing
the reserves, the three fields are identified: Feni, Kamta and Chattak,
without subdivision. The Introduction provides a table showing the “Block
Definition” which for each field identifies the Coordinates of the Area, and
the Depth.

With reference to Block 12, the table presents the “Gas Field Structure”
of the Chattak Gas Field showing exactly the same coordinates as those
in the FOU.

1055.

In subsequent chapters the Study treats separately the Chattak West
Field and the Chattak East Field but considers joint development of both
fields. In particular it states that the

Chattak East exploration structure will be drilled and tied in to the
Chattak West plant facilities following successful development of the
Chattak West Field.

These explanations conclude:

Given success at the Chattak East exploration target the well will be
tied into the Chattak West development plan.

In the conclusions on the technical program the Study identifies the
“remaining, recoverable and risked proven and probable gas reserves” for
the three fields. For Chattak a single value is given with 268 BCF, a value
much above that of Feni (51 BCF) and Kamta (5 BCF). The “established
reserves” thus recorded for Chattak and Feni were to serve as the basis
for the joint venture between BAPEX and Niko:

Based upon the result of the study as indicated in the currently
established reserves stated above, a joint venture contract may be
executed between BAPEX and Niko as stipulated in the study upon
approval of Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources.

The Tribunals conclude that, according to the Study, the JVA was
intended to relate to the “currently established reserves” also of Chattak,
i.e. the 268 BCF for the entire field.

9.5.2 The Chattak Field in the negotiations until the end of the Awami
League Government

The first draft JVA (7 November 1999)®37 deals with the Contract Area in
Article 3 and Annex A. Article 3 reads as follows:

The Contract Area, as of the Effective Date of this Contract, comprises
the Chattak, Feni and Kamta Gas Fields jointly and the areas
immediately surrounding these fields in the event the reservoirs
should extend beyond the currently accepted boundaries.

637 Draft JVA, 7 November 1999, Exhibit R-336; the Respondents describe this draft as “the earliest draft’;
R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 175.

307

1056.

1057.

1058.

Annex A confirms that the “/cjontract Area consists of Chattak, Feni and
Kamta gas fields jointly”. It provides for the identification of the surface
area and for a “Map CF Bangladesh Well Fields”; but no values have been
entered in this Annex.

The Respondents argue that this draft did not include Chattak East.®8
The Claimant disagrees and points to a number of features in this draft
that support its position, including the use of the term “Chattak field”
without the qualification of “West’.®39

Following the receipt of Niko’s JVA proposal of 7 November 1999, BAPEX
formed a committee to examine the proposal. The BAPEX committee
produced a report on 27 March 2000 which was presented to the BAPEX
Board on 28 March 2000 and a second report on 23 May 2000. These
reports have not been produced in the Arbitrations; but it appears from
subsequent correspondence that in these reports the Chattak Gas field
was “intact, that is including Chattak East, in the project’. This
correspondence indicates that it was only afterwards that “Bapex has
taken out the Chattak East portion of the Chattak Gas Field from the
project” 640

The Claimant refers to two drafts of the JVA submitted during this period,
one in May or June 2000, the other in September 2000. While it was
unable to find the former draft, the September 2000 draft has been
produced by the Claimant.®*! According to the Claimant, that draft
“clearly incorporates the same coordinates for the Chattak field as used in
the FOU, hence reflecting the inclusion of both the east and west portions
of the Chattak field” .©42

The Tribunals noted that in Article 1.17 of the September 2000 draft
“Contract Area” is defined as “the areas specified in Article 3.1 hereof and
delineated on the map with coordinates set out in Annex ‘A”; Article 3.1 of
the draft refers to the Chattak field without distinction in a manner
similar to the wording of the November 1999 draft; but the version of the
draft produced by the Claimant does not include an Annex A.

638 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), 179, identifying the draft produced as Exhibit R-336.

639 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), 26 and 27.

640 See above in Section 4.1 and letter from Niko to Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources, 26
February 2003, Exhibit C-149.

641 Draft JVA, September 2000, Exhibit C-130.

642 C-CMC, paragraph 93.

308

1061. The reference to the FOU coordinates in the draft JVA is not as clear as
the Claimant asserts. Since, as described above, the Chattak Field had
been defined by the coordinates in Annex A of the FOU, one would expect
that coordinates of a reduced area would indicate clearly that what is
meant is not the Chattak Field but only Chattak West.

1062. The Minutes of the 114t BAPEX Board meeting of 8 June 2000 support
this assumption. They refer to an earlier “working paper’ which included
Chattak East in the scope of the JVA:

only Chatak, Feni and Kamta gas fields are demarked as
Nonproducing Marginal Field, however, in the working paper, Chattak
(East) has also been included in the proposal in addition to those 3
gas fields. It was remarked that Chatak East area should remain
outside the JVA. Because, Chatak (East) structure is a different
exploration target.°*

1063. The position was confirmed at the 118 BAPEX Board meeting of 21
August 2000, when the Board considered the Joint Venture negotiations
and determined:

The purpose of this Joint Venture is to transform previously
Abandoned Chatak, Feni and Kamta Non-Producing Marginal Gas
Fields to commercially viable gas producing fields. West Block of
Chatak Gas Field, Feni Gas Field and Kamta Gas Field have been
demarked in order to operate the joint venture activities, and since
Chatak East Block is considered a different exploration Lead, it is not
included in the Chatak Gas Field in the proposed activities.®++

1064. The evidence thus suggests that it was only after the joint Niko/ BAPEX
study had been issued in February 2000, that BAPEX and Petrobangla
changed their position and decided that Chattak East should not be
included in the JVA.

1065. The conclusion is confirmed by Mr Chowdhury who wrote in his witness
statement: “BAPEX and Petrobangla had decided after the joint study in
February of 2000 that Chattak East was not part of the abandoned
Chattak West field to include in the JVA”.645

The Respondents assert that

In October of 2000, the Petrobangla Board issued a Decision agreeing
with BAPEX, noting that Chattak East was a different exploration
target and would therefore not be included as part of the “Chattak
Field” identified as a marginal gas field.°*®

In support of this assertion the Respondents rely on an extract from the
Petrobangla Board of Directors meeting of 22 October 2000. This extract
reproduces the decisions of the BAPEX Board of 8 June and 21 August
2000, containing the quoted passages concerning the limitation of the
contract area to West Chattak; but the decision of the Petrobangla Board
itself does not make the distinction between West and East Chattak. In
the decision of the Petrobangla Board there is merely reference to the
development of the “Chattak, Feniand Kamta Non-producing Marginal gas
fields” .©47

The Petrobangla Board decided to send the draft JVA “to the Ministry for
its decision”; it also decided that “PSC negotiation Committee of
Petrobangla, meanwhile, will examine and observe the prepared Joint
Venture Agreement’.

The Petrobangla PSC Negotiation Committee produced its Observations
on 26 November 2000.°8 From these Observations it appears that it had
before it the September 2000 draft.°*9 With respect to Chattak, the
Observations refer to the BAPEX Board decisions and state that the:

BAPEX Board categorically excluded Chattak East from the purview
of the JVA, but the same has not been reflected in the JVA. Rather,
the JVA remains vague in defining the Contract Area.

The area of each field should be defined specifically in sq. km with
coordinates and a location map both in the text and annexure.®5°

The Claimant asserts that it was only at the meeting of 25 June 2001
that Niko appeared to have “the first official indication that BAPEX
intended to try to exclude Chattak East from the JVA”.°*! The above quoted
passages all are from documents internal to the Bangladeshi side of the
project; there does not seem to have been an official communication of
the position concerning Chattak East. The Respondents rightly point
out,®52 however, that on 1 November 2000, the law firm Lee, Khan &
Associates prepared an opinion for Niko on the proposed JVA in which it
addressed the issue of the JVA “land area’ and argued that the JVA
should include “the whole of Chattak”.®°3 This suggests that the Claimant
may already have been informed about the change in BAPEX’ position
before the meeting of 25 June 2001. Indeed, in its letter of 3 March 2003,
Niko explained that it was after the 118t BAPEX Board meeting on 21
August 2000 that it became aware “that the definition of Chattak Gas Field
had been changed to include only Chattak West’ .°54

The Marginal Fields Procedure, as approved by the then Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina on 14 June 2001 and attached to the executed JVA,
identifies marginal gas fields and mandates Petrobangla to declare
certain gas fields as “marginal/ abandoned’. It provides for the processing
of such fields and other aspects of their exploitation. At the end, the
procedure contains an Explanatory Note with the following text:

For the purposes of these proceedings, Chattak, Kamta and Feni gas
fields shall be deemed to have been declared marginal/abandoned
gas fields, and the negotiations/discussions conducted so far with
the approval accorded by the government in 1999, shall be deemed
to have been in compliance with the above procedures.

Despite this confirmation of approval, the differences between BAPEX
and Niko about the contract area continued. At a meeting of BAPEX and
Niko on 25 June 2001, the Parties’ positions with respect to the contract
area remained unresolved. The Minutes of this meeting record the
positions of the parties with respect to the difference that had arisen as
a result of the change in the position by BAPEX, which then also was
adopted by Petrobangla and the Ministry. These Minutes present the
Parties’ reasoning in a form that was repeated with some variations

311

during the following period until March 2003. The Tribunals therefore
reproduce large extracts of these Minutes here:

1. Niko's clear and firm understanding is that Chattak Gas Field
means the whole of the Chattak Gas Field within the ring fenced area
as recorded and declared by Petrobangla in various Petrobangla legal
documents such as the PSC concluded for block 12. More so the area
within the ring fenced boundary for the Chattak, Kamta and Feni Gas
Fields is clearly established in the Framework of Understanding
for the Study for Development and Production of Hydrocarbon
from the Nonproducing Marginal Gas Fields of Chattak, Feni
and Kamta (Study Agreement) with coordinates, depth and area
defined in Exhibit-A therein.

Niko further stated that the Clause 10.06 of the above Study
Agreement clearly prevents any party from changing this definition of
the Chattak Gas Field. In addition clause 9.01 explicitly states that
upon successful completion of the Study Agreement a JVA shall be
executed therefore it was well understood at the time of executing this
Study Agreement that the area and all relevant terms and conditions
of the Study Agreement must be consistent with the JVA.®5

1073. Niko also relies on Article 10 of the Marginal Fields Procedure which it
understands in the sense that Chattak, Kamta and Feni Gas Fields are
declared Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields and that previously agreed
issues are in compliance with the Procedure without room for
renegotiations; hence the definition of these fields “cannot be changed
now from what it is recorded in the Study Agreement’.

1074. This is followed by the understanding of the BAPEX committee’s view:

A. BAPEX committee while deliberating on the above contention of
Niko stated that inclusion of Chattak East within the scope of the Joint
Study Agreement was because of the nature of the agreement.
Normally when a gas field is studied the relevant data coverning the
entire structure is required for a meaningful analysis.

B. BAPEX committee stated that a total gas of 318 BCF which
includes 268 BCF gas from Feni was considered for the cash flow
analysis. Chattak East reserve was excluded from the cash flow
calculation. If the gas reserve of Chattak East is to be included in this
JVA than a fresh calculation of the financial analysis followed by

Development of the Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields of Chhatak, Kamta and Feni, 25 June 2001, Exhibit
R-11, emphasis in the original.

312

negotiation between the parties is required. The above reserve figures
are risked figures.

[oJ

D. The JVA is for Marginal gas fields. This means Gas fields
already discovered and produced for a period of time. Chattak East
is an exploration target and hence can not be termed as a marginal
field.

E. It is understood by BAPEX from the deliberations of the meeting
conducted at the Energy Ministry chaired by the Energy Secretary on
June 24, 2001 that involvement of BGFCL and SGFL in the JVA will
be required. Decisions from these two companies are required by
BAPEX to proceed further to conclude the proposed JVA.

1075. Niko then records that the terms and conditions to which it agreed were
based on the coordinates of the Study Agreement. If Chattak East is
excluded from the JVA these terms and conditions are not applicable. It
adds:

Niko agrees that only 318 BCF of risked proven plus probable reserve
was considered for economic evaluation. But out of this reserve only
155 BCF is proven recoverable from Chattak West and Feni. Therefore
the balance 164 BCF has to be proven either from Chattak West,
Chattak East or Feni. It is already known from the Study that Kamta
in the near future will not contribute any reserve. There fore if Chattak
East is excluded from the project then Niko cannot make this project
viable due to excessive risk.

1076. The Minutes concluded by recording the Parties’ agreement on all other
issues:

all other issues, terms and conditions in the Negotiated Draft JVA
June 2000 has been agreed to between BAPEX and Niko subject to
final approval from BAPEX management®6

9.5.3 The attempted compromise at the end of the Awami League period

1077. The meeting seems to have been followed by a meeting at the Ministry on
27 June 2001. Reference is made to this meeting in Niko’s letter to BAPEX
of 28 June 2001, with copy to the Energy Secretary. In that letter Niko
repeats and develops its arguments and proposes amendments to the
draft JVA, proposing “a more attractive fiscal regime for Chattak East in
consideration that it is required to be treated as a separate exploratory
target even though it is riskier than Chattak West’.°57 Niko explained the
risk factors, as they resulted from the MFE, and stated that without
Chattak East and a possible discovery of gas there the project would not
be viable. It added that “in light of the directive provided in the meeting on
June 27, 2001, at the Energy Ministry, we understand that Chattak East
and Chattak West will be treated separately in the JVA”. In an Exhibit A
to the Letter, Niko proposed some changes in the draft JVA, reflecting
such separate treatment, in particular a “cash flow distribution” in which
the share of BAPEX is higher for Chattak East then for the other fields.

1078. The Respondents produced in the Arbitrations a new draft JVA, dated 3
July 2001,°5§ without a transmission sheet or other indication as to the
origin and the addressee of the document. This draft had a new version
of Article 3 Contract Area:

The Contract Area, as of the Effective Date of this Contract comprises
the Chattak (West) Gas Field and Feni Gas Field. The Chattak East
field would only be included under the scope of this JVA after through
economic analysis and feasibility study by NIKO and may be included
in the JVA under separate Investment Multiple upon receipt of
requisite approval from Petrobangla and the Government.

1079. The Respondents produced this draft with their Memorial on Corruption
and relied on it in support of the assertion that Niko “added Chattak East
to the draft JVA” in July 2001.°59 The Claimant objected, asserting that
it had not identified any such draft in its records and that the draft does
not reflect the amendments proposed by Niko in its letter of 28 June
2001.°°° Without discussing this objection, the Respondents repeated in

their First Post-Hearing Brief the assertion that the July 2001 draft was
prepared by Niko.©!

1080. The Tribunals have considered the conflicting views expressed by the
Parties. There is no record identifying the origin of the 3 July 2001 draft.
The Tribunals noted that in the Whereas clauses of the draft the
definition of the “Area” in the Study Agreement is limited specifically to
“Chattak West’, followed by the statement that “Chattak East was
included in the [FOU and the Joint Study Report] for better understanding
of the structure”, a position at odds with that taken by Niko.

1081. The Tribunals also note that at the meeting of 27 June 2001 the Energy
Secretary seems to have instructed Niko and BAPEX to “consider the
Chattak East portion of the Chattak Gas Field separately from the Chattak
West portion of the Chattak Gas Field” .°©2

1082. Niko responded to these Energy Secretary’s instructions on 28 June 2001
by insisting that it was “essential for Niko that Chattak East is included in
the JVA for the project viability”; it added that the definition of the Chattak
Gas Field had been “clearly established in the Study Agreement’. Niko
accepted, however, the instructions by treating Chattak West and
Chattak East separately in the JVA, with separate fiscal terms.°3 The
passage from the 3 July 2001 draft appears as clearly diverging from this
position.

1083. No response from BAPEX has been produced. The Tribunals note,
however, that BAPEX had taken the position in the 25 June 2001 meeting
that Chattak East must be excluded; but if it would be included “then a
fresh calculation of the financial analysis followed by negotiations between
the parties is required”. This position is very close to that expressed in
Article 3 of the 3 July 2001 draft.

1084. The Tribunals conclude that the 3 July 2001 draft JVA and specifically
the version of Article 3 Contract Area in this draft represents the position
of BAPEX, responding to the instructions of the Energy Secretary at the
meeting on 27 June 2001.

1085. The Claimant asserted that by June 2001 “a JVA including the whole of
the Chattak field and not simply Chattak West was, in the view of the
Ministry and the Prime Minister, on the verge of being awarded to Niko”;
and that “the record plainly contradicts the central pillar of the
Respondents’ theory that Niko could not convince the Awami League
Government to include Chattak East and only made headway on Chattak
East under the BNP Government of Khaleda Zia and through alleged
corruption” .©64

1086. The Respondents object and assert that “there is nothing on the record to
support this”;°°5 they refer to positions expressed by BAPEX and
Petrobangla in 2000 and 2001 and maintain that “the parties did not
agree on Chattak East before the government transition in 2001” .°6¢

1087. The Tribunals conclude that by the beginning of July 2001, presumably
as a result of the instructions of the Energy Secretary, the positions of
the parties had evolved and came close to overcoming the “impasse”: both
accepted that Chattak East could be included in the JVA provided
separate fiscal conditions for that area were agreed. While there is no
indication that, at that time, an attempt was made to agree on these
separate conditions and thus settle the only remaining difference, the
positions reached at that time are quite close to those which were
finally adopted in the JVA as executed.

9.5.4 The Chattak issue in the negotiations during the BNP period until
March 2003

1088. When the negotiations resumed in July 2002, the positions of the parties
again appeared irreconcilable. Following a meeting on 7 July 2002, Niko
wrote to BAPEX on 8 July 2002, with copy to Petrobangla, concerning the
“Definition of Chattak Gas Field and inclusion of Chattak East in the
Bapex-Niko JVA”.°°7 In that letter, Niko set out again its arguments in
support of its claim that Chattak East must be included in the JVA area.
The letter concluded with the following paragraph:

664 Tr. Day 1, p. 275, ll. 20-24, p. 275, 1. 25 - p. 276, ll. 1-5.

1090.

We request that in order to make this project viable, Chattak East be
included in the JVA, to mitigate the reserve risk that we face in
Chattak West. As you are aware that out of the 268 BCF in Chattak
West, 115 BCF is high risk probable reserve. Therefore, the JVA will
not be bankable when we approach the market to raise financing for
this project without Chattak East and consequently we will not be
able to properly embark on the work program. We are prepared to
discuss revised fiscal terms for Chattak East to conduct this
project. 68

Following the Niko/Petrobangla/BAPEX meeting on 7 July 2002, Niko
wrote to the State Minister on 30 July 2002. Petrobangla and BAPEX
had pointed out to Niko “that the Chattak East portion of the Chattak Gas
Field will be excluded from the JVA”. Niko addressed itself to the State
Minister because, in its opinion, such a decision “would be technically
and legally incorrect and shall be in gross contradiction to the norms of the
Petroleum Industry practices and will also be in gross contradiction to the
norms set by the Government of Bangladesh’. It explained that “each and
every Gas Field owned by GOB is described in a consistent manner’; the
Chattak Gas Field was also described by GOB “in the same manner’. Niko
added that in the Chattak East structure there are exploration as well as
appraisal targets, just as in other gas fields which were treated as
“development/appraisal areas” and excluded from the relevant PSC
blocks. In conclusion, Niko requested the State Minister “to take urgent
action and prevent changing the definition of Chattak Gas Field as has
been advised to us recently”.

A day before this letter a meeting at the Ministry on 29 July 2002 had
taken place, apparently attended also by Petrobangla and BAPEX.®9 The
Minutes of the meeting record the discussion in which various arguments
were articulated as to why Chattak East should be treated separately
from Chattak West. The Minutes concluded by recording the following
decisions:

(iii) Chattak Gas Field means Chattak West. As no gas was
discovered in Chattak East geographical structure, there is no scope
to include this geographical structure under the Abandoned Gas Field.

(iv) | The proposal for executing a Joint Venture (JVA) that Niko has
made to BAPEX regarding the restart of production of gas from
Chattak Abandoned Gas field (Chattak West) shall apply only for the
said (Chattak West) gas field. It will not be wise to merge the proposal
for drilling the exploration/production wells at Chattak East
geographical structure and to produce gas therefrom under this
JVA,®70

1091. Petrobangla transmitted the decisions taken on 29 July 2002 to BAPEX
on 7 August 2002. The transmittal letter emphasised that the JVA should
“only be applicable for Chattak West’ and concluded “/aj/s per decision
adopted in this meeting being ordered regarding JVA I do hereby request
you for taking the subsequent step to BAPEX with NIKO” .°7!

1092. BAPEX then wrote to Niko in a letter dated 8 August 2002,°72
responding to the letter of 8 July 2002: “there is no scope to include
Chattak East in the proposed BAPEX-NIKO Joint Venture under the present
scope of Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Field’.

1093. Following this letter Niko wrote to the State Minister on 10 August
2002, mentioning specifically that letter and the Minutes of the 7 July
2002 meeting at Petrobangla. Niko repeated some of its arguments why
Chattak East should be included in the JVA area. Referring to the
argument of BAPEX and Petrobangla according to which Chattak East is
an exploration area Niko added:

Niko is prepared to treat Chattak East as an exploratory area, as
contended by Bapex, and include it in the JVA with the requisite fiscal
terms that are consistent with the fiscal terms GOB has in place for
exploration areas.

The letter concluded with the following offer:

In conclusion we would be thankful if you could consider allowing
Niko to have a comprehensive JVA for the Chattak Gas Field with both
Chattak East and Chattak West. There has not been drilling
conducted in Chattak East in the last 43 years ever since the Chattak

Gas Field was discovered. We are prepared to provide better fiscal
terms for Chattak East provided the JVA includes Chattak East.°73

Niko attached to this letter a legal opinion, dated 10 August 2002 by
Md Azizul Haq, Advocate, Supreme Court, of the firm Moudud Ahmed
and Associates, arguing that “the definition of Chattak Gas Field” should
not be changed and expressing Niko’s belief that “Bangladesh government
will honour the terms and conditions as agreed to and signed in the Bapex
and Niko FOU agreement and the Bapex — Niko Study Report wherein the
definition of Chattak Gas Field is clearly and unambiguously stated” .©7+

Following this letter from Niko and a letter by BAPEX dated 20 August
2002 (which has not been produced), Niko wrote again to the State
Minister on 15 September 2002.°’5 It listed what was in its views the
principal reasons for having Chattak East treated as part of the Chattak
Gas Field and added:

However, the most significant problem with the decision to exclude
Chattak East from the JVA is that it is not commercially viable to
embark on the development of Chattak Gas Field with Chattak West
only. This established fact has been acknowledged by Bapex.°7©

The letter repeated that no drilling had been conducted in Chattak East
for more than 43 years, which it gave as the primary reason that Chattak
East is a “very high risk venture”. The letter concluded by repeating the
offer of better fiscal terms:

We are prepared to provide better fiscal terms based upon investment
multiples for Chattak East even though there is significant risk in
drilling the first well in Chattak East.

This correspondence was followed by another meeting at the Ministry
on 16 September 2002 at which “decisions were taken after detailed
discussion on the matters on which BAPEX-Niko agreed as well as for
those on which the parties did not agree and the matters where it was

mentioned in the said letter that government decisions should be sought
for’.©77 The Minutes deal with a number of issues such as responsibility
for funding and the Investment Multiple, the well head price for the gas,
the transfer of the ownership of the gas fields from the then owners to
BAPEX, and the drilling of an exploratory well at Chattak East.

On 23 November 2002 a meeting apparently took place between BAPEX
and Niko to implement the decisions from the 16 September 2002
meeting. The result of the meeting later was summarised by BAPEX in a
letter for 30 January 2003:

It was apparent from the discussion, and agreed between BAPEX and
NIKO, that there was apprehension of complexities arising with
regards to the Well Head Price, T&D Margin, Corporate Tax, PDF
Margin and Exploration Margin. To avoid these complexities Niko
offered a new proposal by their letter dated 25/11/2002 with a view
to finalise the JV which is mentioned below.®78

Niko’s letter of 25 November 2002 has not been produced in the
Arbitrations but essential elements are reproduced in a subsequent letter
from BAPEX: Niko expressed concern about the “modality of gas sales of
the Joint Venture, ie. Well Head gas price at USD 1.75/MCF and the
deduction of T & D Margin and various other GOB/ Petrobangla levies from
the gas sales proceeds of JV’. In order to deal with this concern, Niko
proposed a different approach, in line with the Marginal Fields Procedure
and an amended Article 24 of the JVA. It also made some other requests,
including the following:

We request that the Chattak East be included in this project. However,
NIKO will accept the final GOB decision in this regard.°79

BAPEX then prepared a revised draft of the JVA “following the
Government decision and the abovementioned proposal by Niko” and
submitted it to the BAPEX Board on 30 December 2002. The Board
decided to form a committee, convened by a General Manager of BAPEX
and including two General Managers from Petrobangla, and gave
directions for the procedure to be followed.®°

1101. The Committee submitted its report on 13 January 2003 and BAPEX
commented on the report by making a correction in the draft JVA and
recommended the acceptance of the modified draft JVA. It concluded:

This is to note that, the committee did not find any Article that goes
against the interests of BAPEX/Petrobangla/the Government. In this
circumstance, the draft JVA can be rearranged as per the
recommendations of the committee.°8!

1102. On 30 January 2003 BAPEX provided a detailed account to
Petrobangla.®82 That letter concluded by a request to the Ministry “to take
further steps for the consideration by and approval of the Ministry
regarding decisions” as per the BAPEX Board decision of 18 January
2003.

1103. Niko then addressed itself to the State Minister requesting his
intervention. In February 2003 Mr Sampson met the State Minister and
on 26 February wrote to him, summarising the history of the project up
to the preparation of the JVA on the basis of the BAPEX May 2000 report.
The letter continued:

Since this report, Bapex has made numerous other changes to the JVA
which Niko has also agreed to except one issue. Bapex has taken
out the Chattak East portion of the Chattak Gas Field from the project.
This change makes the project financially unviable for Niko to pursue.
We understand that Bapex has also written to the Energy Ministry
that this project is not viable with Chattak East alone.

We request your intervention in keeping the Chattak Gas Field intact,
that is including Chattak East, in the project. Our request to you is in
compliance with and as per provisions of the Bapex-Niko “FOU
AGREEMENT”, Bapex-Niko “STUDY REPORT”, “BAPEX
NEGOTIATION COMMITTEE REPORT DATED MAY 23, 2000”, and
most of all the “PROEDURE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
MARGINAL/ABANDONED GAS FIEDS” approved by the Hon. Prime
Minister of Bangladesh. Excluding Chhatak East from this project
would contravene all of the above mentioned documents and Niko will
not be able to implement this project.

As Ihad appealed to you that after waiting for five years, Niko’s board
will not allow me to hold up our resources and pursue this project any

further when we close our fiscal year at March end this year. I humbly
request your intervention to resolve the pending issues and implement
this project without any further delay.®*3

1104. Following this letter a “Joint meeting between the Energy Ministry,
Petrobangla, Bapex and Niko” was held on 2 March 2003. At this
occasion Niko was given an opportunity “to present [its] views and
concerns regarding this project [...] This was the first time in almost two
years we had the opportunity to present our case in a joint meeting” ,°8*
before “senior representatives of BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Ministry” .©85

1105. There are on record no minutes of this meeting. Niko summarised the
positions presented at the meeting as follows:

We understand from the discussions that took place in the referred
meeting that Petrobangla/ Bapex primarily view Chattak Gas Field as
two different fields or entities. Chattak West is Chattak Gas Field
being Abandoned. On the other hand, they view Chattak East is not
Chattak Gas Field and not abandoned.

[...] we view Chattak Gas Field as one gas field consisting of Chattak
West and Chattak East. |...] we did not see or hear of any legal or
regulatory document, other than the decision provided by the
erstwhile secretary in-charge, Mr. Khairuzzaman, which forms the
basis of Petrobangla/Bapex’s contention that Chattak East is
required to be excluded.®8©

1106. In its follow-up letter of 3 March 2003,°°” Niko again set out its case,
insisting that the Chattak Field, historically and geologically, had always
been treated as a single field until it was for the first time excluded at the
BAPEX Board meeting on 21 August 2000. In the view of Niko, this
exclusion was contrary to the PSC Block 12, the FOU, the Report, the
Marginal Fields Procedure and the BAPEX Negotiations Report of 23 May
2000. Niko also sought to demonstrate that treating Chattak East as
Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Field was not contrary to the definition of such
fields by the Government in the Marginal Fields Procedure. In the letter
Niko presented the following representation of the Chattak Field, showing
the four fault blocks, Chattak West and Chattak East:

Fault Block 3

 

Figure 1 - Chattak Gas Field

Based on this figure, Niko sought to demonstrate that the “four Chattak
fault blocks comprise one ‘field’: the ‘Chattak Field”. Niko attached to the
letter a legal opinion on the letter head of Moudud Ahmed and Associates,
dated 27 February 2003 and signed by Md. Azizul Haq, Advocate,
Supreme Court.®8

Referring to a letter of the Ministry of 4 March 2003 (which has not been
produced), BAPEX, wrote to Petrobangla a letter of 5 March 2003,°°9
signed by Mr Maqbul-E-Elahi, Managing Director. The letter described
the position of BAPEX and Petrobangla, relying on the joint survey (the
Report) and the identification of “two distinct entities ie. Chattak (West)
and Chattak (East) field’, and the reference to Chattak East as an
“exploration Target’. The letter gave a summary of the negotiations for the
JVA and noted that in its letter of 8 July 2002, “Niko would provide
entirely different fiscal terms for Chattak (East) if Chattak (East) is included

in the proposed JVA”. Having set out the conflicting positions of the
Parties, the letter concluded with the recommendation to submit the
difference to the Ministry of Law:

Therefore, it is clearly apparent that, in respect of describing the
perimeter of Chattak East as a Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Filed, there
are conflicting views between BAPEX/Petrobangla/Ministry and
NIKO.

Under such circumstances, in order to reach a final determination of
the definition of Marginal/Abandoned Gas Field and what the
boundary will be, the Government may, if it deems necessary, seek
the advice of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary
Affairs.©°

9.5.5 The opinion of the Law Ministry on Chattak and the decisions
following it

1109. The Ministry must have followed this recommendation from BAPEX: On
1 April 2003, the Ministry wrote to Petrobangla with copy to BAPEX,®!
informing them that the Law Ministry’s opinion had been sought and
communicating the substance of the opinion so obtained. In its opening
paragraph, the letter refers to a memorandum by Petrobangla No 46.01.-
163 (part-1)/11 of 5 March 2003 and states that “to resolve the dispute
between BAPEX and Niko regarding Chattak Gas Field’ the opinion of the
Law Ministry was sought.

1110. The Tribunals note with regret that neither the memorandum nor the
opinion itself nor any other document relating to this request for the
opinion has been produced. The content of the Law Ministry’s opinion,
however, is reproduced in a letter of the Energy Ministry, dated 1 April
2003, in the following terms:

(a) To determine the Marginal/Abandoned Gas field there is a
clear guideline in Article 3 [of] the Procedure for Development of
Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields. To determine whether the Gas
Fields under Frame Work of Understanding are

proceedings.

324

Marginal/Abandoned, the above mentioned procedure should be
followed.

(b) But, to determine whether Chattak (East) is included in Chattak
Gas Field or not, Exhibit A of Frame Work of Understanding, executed
within the parties, may be referred to. The coordinates, volume and
depth and of Kamta, Feni and Chattak Gas Fields are clearly
mentioned in Exhibit A. The FOU (Frame Work of Understanding) was
executed between NIKO Resources (Bangladesh) and Bangladesh
Petroleum Exploration Limited (BAPEX). Since the specific description
of Chattak Gas Field is mentioned in Exhibit A so the described area
will be considered as Chattak Gas Field.°°?

1111. The letter of the Energy Ministry then continues by instructing
Petrobangla as to the conclusions to be drawn from this opinion:

In light of the above situation, and as per the kind consent of the
Honorable Prime Minister, regarding the above mentioned matter, this
is to inform that Petrobangla may take necessary action to finalise the
signature of Joint Venture Agreement between BAPEX and NIKO
Resources in the light of under mentioned provisions.

1112. The letter then defines the Chattak Gas Field by reference to Exhibit A of
the FOU and sets out the coordinates as identified in that Exhibit. The
letter concludes by the following instructions:

(b) To achieve the target of finalisation of the Joint Venture
Agreement, Petrobangla is hereby requested to send the draft Joint
Venture Agreement to this Division following all the term and
conditions and Rules and Regulations as approved by the Hon’ble Ex-
Prime Minister on 14.06.2001 in ‘THE PROCEDURE FOR
DEVELOPMENT OF MERGINAL [sic]/ABANDONED GAS FIELDS’.

1113. The letter is signed by Md Safikur Rahman, Senior Assistant Secretary at
the Ministry.

9.5.6 The final stage of the negotiations: separate fiscal terms for
Chattak East

Following this communication by the Ministry, a “BAPEX-Niko JVA
Committee” was set up. Md Mokbul-E-Elahi was its Convener. The JVA
Committee examined and elaborated changes to be made to the JVA in
light of the inclusion of Chattak East. In a letter of 24 April 2003,°°
the convener of this committee reported to Petrobangla the work of the
committee and its consultations. He explained that discussions had
taken place in which Niko was represented by Mr Nuruzzaman Babul as
“local advisor of Niko”, since Mr Qasim Sharif, Vice President of Niko, had
been out of the country.©4

In particular, he wrote:

The committee prepared a Comparative Economic Analysis of each of
the gas fields i.e. Chattak (West), Chattak (East) and Feni under the
JVA with the PSC Moulvibazar Gas Field i.e. Block-12 operated by the
IOC which is enclosed herewith (Enclosure 4). On the basis of the
analysis, the committee prepared the proposal of investment multiple
of Chattak (West), Chattak (East) and Feni Gas Fields; in other words,
they proposed the allocation of shares between BAPEX and Niko in
many options.

Therefore, we request your review of the Comparative Economic
Analysis and approval to send the letter to Niko.

The Committee had prepared a letter to Niko “asking for their opinion on
the decision of the committee” and submitted it to Petrobangla for
approval.

The time fixed for the completion of the Committee’s work was extended
with Petrobangla’s instruction of “[pj/reserving the financial viz overall
interest of BAPEX”®°5 and a second time with a final time limit “in view of
finalizing the JVA discussing with Niko you are specially requested to
perform the required steps within 22-05-2003 AD”.°6

1118. The results of this work were further examined in June 2003 by the
Petrobangla Committee. Petrobangla then prepared amendments of the
draft JVA and the revised draft was submitted for approval to the BAPEX
Board. After that approval by the BAPEX Board, the draft was sent on 3
July 2003 by Petrobangla to the Ministry.

1119. This revised version, providing separate fiscal conditions for Chattak
West and Chattak East and approved by BAPEX and Petrobangla, was
then approved by the Ministry, as shall be discussed below, and
executed on 16 October 2003.

9.5.7 The Tribunals’ considerations and conclusions

1120. From their examination of the evidence before them, the Tribunals
conclude that, until after the completion of the MFE, the Chattak gas
field was treated as a single entity, even though it was known that
several faults divided it. Between late May and early June 2000 BAPEX
decided to treat Chattak East differently from Chattak West and
remove it from the contract area of the JVA; it argued that Chattak East
was an “exploration” area and as such could not be treated as
“marginal/abandoned’. This position was then also adopted by
Petrobangla and the Ministry.

1121. In their discussions about the Chattak issue, the Respondents insist that
Chattak West and Chattak East must be considered separately; the
concept of “marginal/abandoned” field applied only to Chattak West,
while Chattak East had to be treated as an exploration target.

1122. That was the position that BAPEX had taken, for instance in the meeting
of 25 June 2001 discussed above:

The JVA is for Marginal gas fields. This means Gas fields already
discovered and produced for a period of time. Chattak East is an
exploration target and hence can not be termed as a marginal field.©”

°97 Minutes of the Meeting to Finalized the JVA, 25 June 2001, Exhibit R-11.

327

1123. Mr Chowdhury explained the positions in his Witness Statement. He
confirmed that it was “after the joint study in February 2000” that BAPEX
and Petrobangla “decided [...] that Chattak East was not part of the
abandoned Chattak West field to include in the JVA”.©°8 When the matter
was raised for his review at the Ministry, he “studied it carefully” and, at
the meeting of 29 July 2002 he reached the same conclusion as the
Chairman of Petrobangla and the Managing Director of BAPEX. He
defended this position at later occasions as well.

1124. At the hearing Mr Chowdhury explained the position that he had taken
also at the meeting of 16 September 2002:

Chattak East and West are divided by faults and they are not
considered one gas field.®°°

1125. He conceded then, however, that this was not his own opinion but was
based on the technical advice from Petrobangla and BAPEX. He accepted
that advice, having seen that the MFE assumed separate treatment for
Chattak West and Chattak East. He said that other studies adopted the
same position, but had not seen these other studies.70°

1126. Niko objected to the removal of Chattak East from the area of the JVA,
contesting the split of what it considered a single field and relying, among
other arguments, on the terms of the FOU and the Marginal Fields
Procedure. While also presenting some geological arguments and
insisting that the project would not be viable if Chattak were limited to
the Western part, the Claimant defended its position primarily on the
contractual level, arguing that the “Chattak Field’ was from the outset of
negotiations specifically defined to include both the East and West
portions:

“Chattak Field” was from the outset of negotiations specifically
defined to include both the East and West portions, and that carving
out Chattak East from the JVA would have defied both industry
practice and practical reality.7°!

1127. The Claimant also argued that, with respect to the definition of
marginal/abandoned fields for the purpose of Bangladeshi law, the

1131.

Marginal Fields Procedure is decisive; and that Procedure accepts that
the Chattak Field is deemed to be a marginal/abandoned field, without
the East/West distinction:

. in the case of Chattak and Feni specifically, the Marginal Field
Procedure passed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in 2001 was the
applicable “norms and procedures” and had already explicitly
deemed any applicable procedural requirements to have been
complied with.7°2

Concerning international standards for defining marginal/abandoned
gas fields, the Claimant relied on the explanations of Mr. Moyes to the
effect, as summarised by the Claimant, that “the inclusion of the entirety
of the Chattak Field was wholly consistent with international industry
practice and expectations” .7°3

The difference between the Parties about the contract area was resolved
by the Law Ministry’s opinion. Based on the definition in the FOU, in
particular the coordinates set out in its Annex A, the Law Ministry
concluded that the JVA had to apply to the Chattak Gas Field as defined
in this annex.

The opinion led to a compromise solution which had already been
envisaged at the end of the Awami League Government: that the JVA
applied to the undivided Chattak Field but with separate fiscal terms for
its Western and Eastern parts, the latter taking into account terms that
had been applied with respect to operations in the surrounding PSC
exploration areas.

The Respondents now heavily criticise the Law Ministry’s opinion, which
they describe as “facially irrational’ 74 or as the result of “unreasonable
analysis”.7°5 The Tribunals will examine in further detail in Section 9.6
the circumstances of the Law Ministry’s opinions and their alleged
irregularity. At this stage, the Tribunals consider the criticism raised by
the Respondents concerning the substance of the opinion on the Chattak
issue.

1132. Contrasting their views with respect to this concept with that attributed
to the State Minister, the Respondents assert that the State Minister

. endorsed Niko’s contrived argument that the FoU obligated the
Government to grant Niko rights to an exploration prospect that could
in no way be considered a marginal or abandoned field.7°°

1133. The Tribunals have considered the provision in the FOU according to
which, upon the successful completion of the Study and the acceptability
of the result, “the parties would execute a Joint Venture Agreement’. The
Respondents are correct in saying that this provision was no guarantee
for Niko with respect to the conclusion of the JVA. Indeed, the conditions
within this provision must be met and the parties must agree on the
terms. The Tribunals are however of the view that the scope for the
negotiations, and in particular the area to which they will apply, were
defined by the scope of the FOU.

1134. The Tribunals also note that the Marginal Fields Procedure, in its Clause
10, envisaged that the Chattak, Feni and Kamta gas fields “shall be
deemed to have been declared marginal/abandoned gas fields”. Since
BAPEX and Petrobangla had by then argued that the Chattak field had
to be split, the fact that this provision nevertheless makes no such
distinction, in the eyes of the Tribunals is clear recognition that the
Awami League Government, by adopting the Marginal Fields Procedure
with its Clause 10, had decided that Chattak East would not be removed
from the Chattak Field.

1135. The Tribunals therefore conclude that it was reasonable for the Law
Ministry to conclude that the Parties had agreed in the FOU that future
contract area of the JVA was the Chattak Field in the coordinates of
Exhibit A to the FOU. In view of this conclusion concerning the agreement
between the Parties, there is no need to resolve geological differences that
might otherwise be relevant with respect to the definition of
marginal/abandoned fields.

1136. In conclusion on the Chattak issue, the Tribunals note that in the BELA
Judgment of May 2010 the High Court Division of the Bangladesh
Supreme Court also examined the issue. This judgment, like the opinion
of the Law Ministry, relies on the coordinates in the FOU which it found

706 R-MC, paragraph 87.

330

1137.

9.6

1138.

1139.

“approved by the highest authority”. The Court concluded that this
definition of the contract area was binding for the JVA and explained:

The coordinations [sic] of Chattak Gas field were defined in FOU. In
fact, according to the terms of FOU exclusion of Chattak (East) from
JVA and adoption of Swiss Challenge would be illegal as it would
breach the terms and conditions of FOU. With respect to “Chattak
(East) Explanatory Prospect” [Niko] reiterates that it falls within the
coordinates of Chattak gas field as defined in the FOU. The JVA was
executed pursuant to the terms and conditions of the FOU. The
inclusion of Chattak (East) in the JVA is can not be said malafide as
the FOU was approved by the highest authority.7°7

In other words, far from considering the Law Ministry’s opinion of March
2003 “irrational or “contrived”, the High Court Division adopted it in
substance. Based on their own analysis and considering the Judgment
of the High Court Division, the Tribunals have found no reason to
impugn the Law Ministry’s opinion; nor do they find any irregularity
in the inclusion of Chattak East in the area of the JVA.

Competition and the Swiss Challenge Procedure

With respect to the question whether the conclusion of the JVA with Niko
required prior submission of the contract to competition under the
procurement rules applicable to such projects in Bangladesh and
specifically to the method of Swiss Challenge, the Respondents assert
that Niko successfully avoided through corruption that these
requirements were applied to the award of the JVA. The Claimant denies
that the requirements were applicable in the circumstances of the
conclusion of the JVA, or that there was corruption in the decision to
award the JVA without competitive procedures.

9.6.1 The Swiss Challenge procedure defined

In its June 1998 Proposal, Niko described the procedure which later was
referred to as the Swiss Challenge:

Niko will support and follow the procedural requirement the
Government of Bangladesh will require to privatise the marginal, non-
producing fields. However, in order to ensure transparency, Niko

707 BELA Judgment, Exhibit CLA-143, pp. 36 - 37.

331

proposes the following modality for finalising the proposed joint
venture contract with BAPEX and putting the subject non-producing
marginal fields on production:

A. To our understanding since Niko is the first international
company to promote the development of the marginal fields, the
Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources may execute an MOU
with Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. A copy of the MOU is
attached for your consideration.

B. Upon execution of the MOU, the terms and conditions of the
contract are negotiated between Petrobangla and Niko and a
draft contract is prepared.

C. Petrobangla then makes a public announcement of the project
complete with the finalized terms and conditions. In this public
announcement Petrobangla also invites other competent parties
to submit offers in two separate packages titled "Technical
Proposal" and "Commercial Proposal". Petrobangla opens and
reviews all technical proposals first and then the commercial
proposals of only the technically qualified parties are opened
for evaluation.

D. All technically qualified proposals are reviewed, marked and
normalised including the one negotiated with Niko.

E. If Niko remains the only qualified party or receives the highest
mark then the contract negotiated with Niko is executed. If any
other party is in the leading position, then Niko is asked to
match that offer. If Niko agrees to match the leading offer, then
the contract is executed with Niko. If Niko is unable to match
the best offer then the contract is executed with the technically
qualified and commercially successful party.7°8

1140. It is uncontested that this proposal, although it does not mention the
term Swiss Challenge, describes the procedure to which the Parties refer
by this term. Referring to this proposal, Niko wrote on 1 February 1999
to BAPEX: “ojur proposal for the subject project is based upon utilizing the
transparent process of Swiss Challenge...”7°° Petrobangla’s 1998
Comments, evaluating the June 1998 Proposal, state the “Niko has

R-265.
709 Letter from Niko to BAPEX, 1 February 1999, Exhibit R-269.

332

proposed that the process of Swiss Challenge be adopted in finalising the
contract.”710

1141. There is on the record no other detailed description of the Swiss
Challenge procedure. The Tribunals take this quoted description as the
Parties’ joint understanding of the Swiss Challenge procedure.

1142. Considering this description of Swiss Challenge, the following elements
must be taken as characteristic:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

The Government or its designated entity concludes a preliminary
agreement with a contractor (who can be described as the
preselected contractor) about the procedure to be adopted for the
award of the future contract. This preliminary agreement, in Niko’s
proposal described as “MoU”, is concluded before the element of
competition is introduced in the procedure.

The terms and conditions of the future contract (the JVA) are
negotiated with the preselected contractor and a draft contract is
prepared.

Competition is introduced by a public announcement by
Petrobangla on the basis of this draft JVA, as the product of the
negotiations with the preselected contractor.

The companies responding to this announcement must submit a
technical and a commercial proposal. On the basis of the technical
proposal, Petrobangla determines the technically qualified
companies. Niko’s proposal is included in the “technically qualified
proposals” without further review.

If there are, in addition to that of Niko, other technically qualified
proposals, the commercial proposals are “reviewed, marked and
normalised”.

If Niko’s proposal is the only one technically qualified or none of the
other qualified proposals are ranked above that of Niko, the JVA is
awarded to Niko.

Development and Production”, undated, Exhibit R-267, paragraph B.3.5.

333

(vii) Ifthere are proposals ranked higher than that of Niko, Niko will be
given the opportunity to match the highest-ranking offer.

1143. The Respondents clearly understood that the application as proposed by
Niko required that, as a first step, an MOU be concluded, as a basis for
the subsequent JVA negotiations. In its observations on the Niko
Proposal, Petrobangla wrote:

Niko has proposed that the process of Swiss Challenge be adopted in
finalising the contract. The first step in Swiss Challenge is the signing
of an MOU between MOEMR and Niko to initiate negotiations by both
parties in good faith for this project.7!!

1144. The Tribunals conclude that, according to the Swiss Challenge process,
as understood by the Parties, Niko was in any event treated as technically
qualified. If proposals by other companies were ranked higher than that
of Niko, Niko would be given an opportunity to match the highest-ranking
proposal. In this process, Niko would be assured the preferential
treatment in a MOU, concluded before the negotiations for the JVA are
started and competition would be introduced only once a negotiated draft
of the JVA has been completed.

9.6.2 The Parties’ positions

1145. The Respondents argue that granting rights as those conferred on Niko
in the JVA had to be subject to competitive procedures and specifically
through the process described as Swiss Challenge. The JVA was
concluded with Niko in the absence of a Swiss Challenge or any other
competitive procedure, an advantage that Niko obtained by corruption.
They state:

Niko’s corruption prevented competitive bidding, thereby depriving the
people of Bangladesh of a more competent operator for the fields.7!?

and:

The fact is that Niko’s corruption allowed it to procure the contracts
without BAPEX and the Government having the opportunity to seek

711 Petrobangla 1998 Comments, Exhibit R-267, paragraph B 3.5.
712 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 24.

334

more favourable terms and bids from other companies, all of whom
would have been far more qualified according to Arthur Andersen.7!3

1146. The Respondents argue that competition in the award of contracts
generally and Swiss Challenge in particular was a requirement for the
lawful conclusion of the JVA. They state:

Swiss Challenge was what Niko offered to get in the door to negotiate
the JVA and then evaded through corruption. As Respondents and
two of its [sic] witnesses have explained, competition is a cornerstone
of Bangladeshi public administration, as corroborated by all other oil
and gas tenders and multiple procurement manuals.7!+

1147. The Respondents deny that the FOU changed the requirement for
competition in the award of the JVA; and, if it had done so, they argue
that it would not have been binding.

1148. The Claimant denies that there was an obligation or a practice in
Bangladesh to award contracts as the JVA in competitive procedure.7!5
It accepts that its initial proposal and specifically the June 1998 Proposal
offered the use of the Swiss Challenge procedure, even though the MOU,
attached to the proposal letter, did not make any reference to it.71© The
Claimant argues, however, that the initially proposed approach was
fundamentally changed with the adoption of the FOU:

... the FOU was a fundamentally different document than the MOU,
and established a fundamentally different process to advance the
JVA.717

1149. According to the Claimant, BAPEX concluded, with the approval of the
Ministry and Petrobangla, the FOU which entitled Niko, upon successful
completion of the Study, to enter into the JVA:

Most critically, the FOU explicitly provided that the Parties would
execute a JVA upon satisfactory completion of the study. This was not

qualified by reference to Swiss Challenge or any other bid
procedure. 718

In addition, the Claimant relies on other provisions in the FOU to
demonstrate “the firm nature of the commitment to proceeding with a JVA”,
in particular clauses 4.03 and 5.02.7!9 The Claimant also relies on the
Marginal Fields Procedure72° and argues that it assured a special status
for Niko and the two fields to which the JVA granted rights. Apart from
the legal arguments, the Claimant invokes “clear and present practical
challenges to implementing” the Swiss Challenge procedure in the present
case.

9.6.3 The Tribunals’ questions and the principal issues to be addressed

The Tribunals have invited the Parties to respond to a number of
questions related to the application of competitive procedures in general
and of the Swiss Challenge procedure in particular. In Question 6, as
quoted above in Section 2.4, the Tribunal invited argument and evidence
concerning relevant competitive procedures and information on the
procedures applied in practice to the award of petroleum projects and the
commercial conditions of such projects. They also invited explanations
concerning certain aspects of the negotiations of the JVA and the role
which the reference to the Swiss Challenge procedure played in it.

Considering the Parties’ arguments and evidence, including their replies
to the Tribunals’ questions, the Tribunals understand that their analysis
must distinguish between

(i) a general requirement for competition or for the Swiss Challenge
under the applicable rules and regulations for public procurement
in Bangladesh; and

(ii) a specific agreement between the Government/ Petrobangla/
BAPEX and Niko to apply this procedure.

9.6.4 The requirements under the Bangladesh procurement regulations

Concerning the “normal competitive procedures’, the Respondents
explained:

The laws and regulations at the time required competition for
government procurement and_ service contracts. The public
procurement regulations on the record indicate that competition was
required ...721

In support of this assertion, the Respondents rely on the Public
Procurement Regulation of September 2003722 and an undated
Procurement Manual.’23 They also assert:

... grant of any rights to develop gas fields, whether for exploration,
marginal/ abandoned fields, or known discoveries, is done through an
open and competitive process in Bangladesh.7?4

The support for this assertion is found, in the Respondents’ view, in the
1978 Manual of Office Procedure (Purchase) (1978), providing under the
heading “General Principles of entering into contracts”:

As far as possible, contract should be placed only after tenders have
been openly invited.725

In response to the Tribunals’ question, the Respondents provided the
following explanation:

The laws and regulations at the time required competition for
government procurement and_ service contracts. The public
procurement regulations on the record indicate that competition was
required:

° “The salient features of the Regulations are that they have been
prepared in line with international standard introducing
improved modern procurement principles and practices that will

promote fairness and competition in the procurement process,

ensure equitable treatment to all parties.”

« ‘T]he Government of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh

goods, works or services in the public sector/.]”

« “Procurement should normally be carried out through one-stage
bidding” and for complex works, “a two-stage bidding/two-
envelope bidding procedure may be adopted.”7?6

1157. The first two quotations in this passage of the Respondents’ First Post-
Hearing Brief are from the Public Procurement Regulations (Sept.
2003),727 and the third quotation from the undated Procurement
Manual.728

1158. The Respondents also rely on what they describe as the confirmation of
a “general principle” described in Mr Chowdhury’s testimony at the
Hearing and quoted by the Respondents as follows:

“every purchase or procurement of services must have competitive,
comparative bidding”.’29

1159. Concerning the practice with respect to petroleum contracts, the
Respondents assert that

Bangladesh has never before or after the JVA awarded rights to
exploit petroleum resources without public competitive bidding. 7°°

1160. The Respondents cite three cases to support this statement:

First, in 2008, “[iJn order to sign PSCs, Petrobangla [...] floated
international tenders” for bidding. Seven international companies bid
for 15 blocks. The selected companies and Petrobangla ratified drafts
subject to approval by the competent authorities, the State Minister of
Energy and the Prime Minister.

A similar process was followed in 2012. The Government invited
bidders with a newspaper announcement. Again, a committee was
formed to review the bids and report to the Petrobangla Chairman.

338

Two companies were selected for PSCs and approval of the Ministry
of Energy was sought before executing the PSCs.

In 2016, there was a slightly different competitive process. After
StatOil showed interest in signing a contract, the Government invited
expressions of interest (EOI) from competitors, providing that StatOil
would not participate in the EOI, but would be invited to “participatfe]
in the legally accepted procedures” that followed, i.e., in the request
for proposal (RFP). After evaluating the EOI, the Government chose
three companies, including StatOil, to submit competitive
proposals. 731

1161. The Claimant denies that, under the law or practice in Bangladesh, there
was any requirement to follow a competitive process for the conclusion of
the JVA:

... there was never any legal or procedural requirement to proceed
with a Swiss Challenge process prior to executing the JVA, or indeed
to proceed with any other form of competitive bidding. The
Respondents have repeatedly asserted that a requirement existed to
complete a competitive bidding process before executing the JVA, but
despite being given every opportunity to identify such a requirement
with specificity, the Respondents and their witnesses have failed to
identify anything that supports such a notion, whether as a matter of
law or policy. 73?

1162. The Claimant contests the Respondents’ assertion that “Bangladesh has
never before or after the JVA awarded rights to exploit petroleum resources
without public competitive bidding’. It refers to 2010 legislation
specifically dispensing with any tendering requirements in the power and
energy sectors: the Speedy Supply of Power and Energy (Special Provision)
(Amendment) Act. It asserts that under the provisions of this act,
contracts have been awarded “including gas well drilling contracts to
Gazprom’ .733

1163. As to the 2003 Public Procurement Regulation, on which the
Respondents rely, the Claimant points out that it was dated September
2003 and “came into effect at some later point following publication in the
Official Gazette”, possibly March 2004.794 They add: “/tjhe fact that these

1167.

Regulations were only being introduced in September 2003 supports the
notion that, prior to that time, there were no such requirements in effect’.

In any event, the Claimant questions the applicability of the 2003
Procurement Regulation to a licence/concession agreement such as the
JVA, under which Niko was the party making the applicable financial
commitment. It relies on the definition of “procurement” in the regulation:

“procurement” means the purchasing, hiring or obtaining of goods,
works and services by any contractual means. 735

The Claimant concludes that “the JVA is plainly not a ‘procurement’
contract within the meaning of the 2003 Regulations” .736

In addition to the FOU, the Claimant relies on the Marginal Fields
Procedure of June 2001, in particular Article 10 and Article 4.2 and 4.4,
as well as the Briefing Note which the Ministry of Energy issued on 6
June 2001 to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, four days before the policy
was approved.737 The Claimant argues:

Put simply, under Article 10 of the Marginal Field Procedure, the
Chattak/Feni JVA was explicitly deemed to have complied with all
aspects of the Marginal Field Procedure. The Marginal Field Procedure
included proposal evaluation and approval procedures at Articles 4.2
and 4.4 and, under the terms of Article 10, these were deemed to have
been complied with for the purposes of the Chattak, Feni and Kamta
fields. Further, Article 4.4 is that which would apply to the JVA,
absent Article 10, and it does not contemplate a Swiss Challenge or
other bid procedure for marginal field development JVAs. 78

The Tribunals have examined the bases for the Respondents’ assertion
that the conclusion of the JVA had to be subject to competitive
procedures. In this examination, the Tribunals have noted that the
regulations on which the Respondents rely do indeed confirm, as a matter
of principle, the desirability of applying competitive procedures. The
Respondents have, however, not quoted a single provision that requires
competitive procedures in all cases.

738 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 140.

340

1168. In their examination, the Tribunals also have considered that the JVA
and the circumstances of its conclusion are different from ordinary
procurement contracts that are regulated by the provisions on which the
Respondents rely.

e The JVA is not a contract by which BAPEX acquires goods, works
or services against payment of a price, as they are regulated for
instance by the 1978 Manual of Office Procedure (Purchase), in
the undated Procurement Manual and in the 2003 Public
Procurement Regulation. Indeed, the Respondents have not
argued that any of these texts apply directly to the award of the
JVA.

e Moreover, the conclusion of the JVA was not the result of an
initiative of the Respondents or the Government which could have
been expressed in the form of an invitation to tender or a request
for proposals. It was initiated by an unsolicited proposal from
Niko for the development of a resource which, at the time, the
Government and the Respondents had not planned to develop.
The Government received a proposal which it could accept or not
- a situation quite different from that addressed in the
procurement regulations. There was indeed no precedent for the
JVA, as Mr Chowdhury testified.799

e In addition, the terms and conditions of the JVA were negotiated
over a very long period and, as shown above in Section 4.1, were
examined at length by several working groups of BAPEX and
Petrobangla.

1169. In view of these particularities, it is not apparent to the Tribunals that
the conclusion of the JVA must be governed by principles of ordinary
procurement. The protection of the public interest in the use of the State’s
resources may require that other methods be considered.

1170. Indeed, when Niko made its proposal in June 1998, the Respondents and
the Government did not envisage applying any of the procedures provided
by the procurement regulations or otherwise practiced in Bangladesh. In
other words, there is no indication that, by proposing Swiss Challenge,

739 Tr. Day 3 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 65, ll. 12-23.

341

Niko sought to replace a competitive procedure that would otherwise have
been applied.

1171. Following receipt of the June 1998 Proposal, the Respondents also
proceeded with a thorough analysis of Niko’s proposals and the terms of
the JVA, as they evolved over time. These examinations were first
performed upon receipt of the June 1998 Proposal separately by BAPEX
and by Petrobangla and presented in Petrobangla’s 1998 Comments,
discussed above. Several other examinations were conducted during the
following years, in particular by the committees formed at various stages
of the negotiations of which some were referred to above in Section 4.1.
The intensity of these examinations also found its reflection in the
number of drafts of the JVA, as they were prepared over the years by one
or the other side to that proposed agreement. In other words, the
Government and the Respondents carefully analysed the JVA’s terms and
conditions, as one would expect in the absence of competitive procedures.

1172. In their explanations on the competition requirement, the Respondents
refer, as quoted above, to the practice in Bangladesh specifically with
respect to the “award of rights to exploit petroleum resources”. The
Claimant has cast doubt in the consistency of this practice as asserted
by the Respondents.74° The Tribunals note that indeed the examples
provided by the Respondents concerned the award of PSCs where the
Government or Petrobangla had identified the areas to be awarded. Even
if these examples showed a consistent practice, this would not exclude
that, in the special circumstances prevailing with respect to the JVA, a
different approach could be adopted. Indeed, when the Petrobangla Board
of Directors discussed the Niko 1998 Proposal at its meeting on 22
October 2000 and compared it to the conditions of PSCs, the “Board was
informed that this entity [i.e. Niko] has proposed to unilaterally develop the
Joint Venture-fields, hence this is not possible to compare this entity with
any other entities”.74!

1173. In any event, the procedure for awarding contracts for the development
and exploitation of marginal/abandoned gas fields was first regulated by
the Government (under Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina) in June 2001. The

Procedure to this effect emphasises that “a set of procedural guidelines is
deemed necessary” ,’*? thus indicating that, prior to this procedure, the
matter was not, or not adequately, regulated.743

The Procedure defines the process by which marginal gas fields are
identified and determines the procedure for awarding contracts for
private investment in such fields. It distinguishes between (a)
investments for which the Government or Petrobangla invites proposals
and negotiates a contract with the best proposal and (b) contracts for
offers received prior to the adoption of the Procedure.

With respect to the former, a competitive procedure is prescribed in the
following terms:

4.2. _GOB/Petrobangla may invite proposals for private investment
for the development of marginal/abandoned gas fields. The offers
received will be evaluated on declared criteria and the best offer will
be selected for negotiation and finalisation of the contract.

4.3 Model Production Sharing Contract 1997 as it relates only to
gas and its associated products and as may be modified from time to
time by the Government shall be used as far as practicable as
guidelines for negotiation. However, established norms and
procedures will be taken into consideration while finalising the
contract between the parties.

This procedure leaves no room for the Swiss Challenge, where the terms
of the contract are negotiated first with a single bidder and proposals are
invited by reference to the terms so negotiated.

The Procedure for Marginal Fields continues in Clause 4 by addressing a
different situation:

4.4 Offers received prior to the adoption of these procedures will be
appraised by a technical committee appointed by Petrobangla. After
appraisal a Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) will be concluded between

742 Procedure for Development of Marginal /Abandoned Gas Fields, Annex C to JVA, Exhibit R-7, clause 1.2.
743 The High Court Division of the Supreme Court reached a similar conclusion on the basis of the
evidence before it when it issued the order of 5 November 2015 on Writ Petition 4982 of 2008. “It further
appears from the charge sheet that [prior to the Marginal Fields Procedure of 2001] there was no policy or
guideline to conclude the JVA with foreign company in respect of exploration and extraction of gas and oil in
Bangladesh. Even no model JVA was framed yet.” (Exhibit R-230, page 37).

the selected investor and Petrobangla/Company(ies) and forwarded
to the Government for approval.

An earlier draft contained, beside this provision, another clause dealing
with such prior as follows:

Unsolicited offers received prior to the adoption of this policy will be
appraised by a technical committee appointed by Petrobangla. Such
offers will be subject to Swiss Challenge before the contract is
finalised.744

This reference to Swiss Challenge in the earlier draft of the Procedure
seems in line with correspondence from the Ministry to Petrobangla on
19 and 29 March and 16 April 2001,745 passed on to BAPEX on 11 April
2001. In the Ministry’s letters Petrobangla is instructed to finalise the
JVA “based on Swiss Challenge method” and “by following the swiss
challenge method after completion of necessary negotiations’, respectively.

The provision in the earlier draft of the Procedure which required the
application of the Swiss Challenge method did not find its way into the
final version of the Procedure. The provision retained would have
regulated offers received prior to June 2001, at the time of the adoption
of the Marginal Fields Procedure, and thus covers Niko’s June 1998
Proposal. It requires appraisal by a technical committee and the
conclusion of a Joint Venture Agreement which must be approved by the
Government. This process is implemented without any competitive
procedure — Swiss Challenge or otherwise. In other words, the public
interest is ensured by the appraisal of a technical committee appointed
by Petrobangla and with Government approval.

The Respondents comment on this provision thus:

Nothing in this language suggests that the conclusion of a contract
would be appropriate absent competition or government approval.

R-274, and Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 16 April 2001,

And, in any event, the draft Procedure explicitly stated that the
Government’s interpretation (requiring competition) would prevail.746

1182. The statement refers to Clause 9 of the Procedure:

In case of any ambiguity with regard to interpretation of any provision
of these procedures, the GOB interpretation shall be final.747

1183. The Tribunals see no ambiguity in Clause 4.4. That clause requires
Government approval and does not require competition. The conclusion
of a contract “absent government approval’ is not “appropriate”; but there
is no basis for asserting that the conclusion of a contract “absent
competition” is inappropriate. What is “inappropriate” is the assertion by
the Respondents that the Government may declare that Clause 4.4
required interpretation and, based on Clause 9, interpret it as “requiring
competition”.

1184. Itis clear to the Tribunals from the wording of Clause 4.4 of the Marginal
Fields Procedure that it was sufficient that the terms of the Agreement
were appraised in the manner prescribed and approved by the
Government; there was no requirement of a competitive procedure for the
conclusion of the JVA in the present case.

1185. The conclusion is confirmed by the fact that an earlier draft of the
Procedure provided for the use of the Swiss Challenge procedure and this
requirement was removed in the final version. The Tribunals also note
that, once the draft Procedure was approved by the special committee for
supervision of the Bid evaluation, chaired by the Principal Secretary of
the Prime Minister, and shortly before its approval by the Prime Minister,
the Ministry instructed “urgent finalisation” of the JVA. It announced to
Petrobangla on 10 June 2001 the advanced state of the Procedure,
communicated a copy of it and gave the following instructions:

In this situation in light of the draft procedure for development of
Chatak, Kamta and Feni marginal and abandoned gas fields for
urgent finalisation of the Joint Venture Agreement between Bapex
and Niko Resource:

(1) write a letter to Niko Resource mentioning specific date for
coming to Bangladesh and

(2) after finalization of the negotiations of Joint Venture Agreement
between Bapex and Niko Resource, send the JVA to this
ministry for approval of the government by 20/06/2001.748

On the same day, these instructions were passed on by Petrobangla to
BAPEX and on 11 June 2001 BAPEX wrote to Niko, attaching the
Petrobangla letter and stating:

Pursuant to the mentioned draft policy of the Government, the
proposed draft JVA needs to be _ reshaped/rearranged
accommodating right clauses as and where needed. Accordingly, we
invite one of your authorised representative to a Joint meeting
between BAPEX and NIKO to be held on 12‘ June 2001 at 10.00 A.M.
at BAPEX office, Dhaka, Bangladesh.749

In none of the three letters was there any mention of Swiss Challenge or
any other competitive procedure to be applied before this “urgent
finalisation” of the JVA. By that time at the latest, the Government and
the Respondents evidently considered that Swiss Challenge was not or
no longer required.

In the Tribunals’ view the procedure by which the JVA was concluded
thus was in compliance with the Marginal Fields Procedure. The
Respondents have not shown the violation of any other procurement
regulation in Bangladesh.

This conclusion leaves as only other possible basis for requiring the
application of the Swiss Challenge an agreement between Niko and the
Government or the Respondents.

9.6.5 The alleged agreement to follow the Swiss Challenge procedure

In addition to their assertion that competitive procedures were required
for the award of the JVA, the Respondents also argue that the use of the
Swiss Challenge procedure had been agreed by the Parties and thus had

1193.

become a binding requirement. The Claimant denies that such a
requirement had been agreed and, in any event, the FOU provided for the
conclusion of the JVA upon the completion of the Study without the
additional step of a Swiss Challenge.

When the Respondents discuss their allegation about an agreement on
the Swiss Challenge procedure they often do so together with the
argument on the general requirement of competitive procedures, which
has been discussed above. This combination of the two lines of
arguments can be seen for instance when the Respondents rely on Niko’s
June 1998 Proposal and the offer to apply Swiss Challenge contained in
this proposal. They explained in their First Post-Hearing Breif that

The Government accepted Niko’s proposal to use Swiss Challenge
instead of the normal competitive procedures for petroleum rights, and
Respondents considered competition through Swiss Challenge as
“mandatory”.75°

The position now taken by the Respondents is that the Government’s
acceptance of Niko’s proposal was expressed when on 25 May 1999 the
Ministry “directed Petrobangla to ‘take necessary action in order to
implement [Niko’s] proposal” .75!

When asserting that they considered Swiss Challenge as “mandatory”,
the Respondents make reference to the Minutes of a meeting of the
Petrobangla Board of Directors on 22 October 2000. The relevant passage
in these Minutes reads as follows:

The Board was further informed that Paragraph ‘C’ of the latter [sic]
of the Ministry dated on 05/25/1999 in respect of development and
producing gas the proposal prepared by Niko & BAPEX if it is required
following the Swiss Challenging method by verifying and taking of
steps for implementation has been mentioned. The Board was further
informed that competitive terms have been adopted by calling for the
international tender following this method. The Board has mentioned

Board of Directors Meeting of 22 October 2000, Exhibit R-271.

Petrobangla, 25 May 1999, Exhibit R-270; in the following paragraph, the Respondents refer to these
directions, stating that “the Government accepted Niko’s offer’.

347

1194.

1195.

1196.

that for following Swiss Challenge method is mandatory not
optional.752

The Respondents are of the view that the requirement of Swiss Challenge
so established was not removed by the FOU but confirmed. They refer to
Article 7.01 FOU which provides for strict confidentiality of the
Programme Information, i.e. the information developed or acquired in the
context of the Study. At the end of this provision one finds the following
sentence: “if swiss challenge process is adopted, this is not applicable”.
The Respondents argue:

Crucially, unlike the MoU, the FoU expressly refers to the “swiss
challenge process”. While this reference appears in the section on
confidentiality, logic dictates that given this reference, one cannot
infer an implicit exclusion of Swiss Challenge.7>

The Claimant recognises that its June 1998 Proposal included the
proposed use of the Swiss Challenge Procedure. It insists, however, that
the MoU, attached to the Proposal, was never executed and that there
was no agreement to use the Swiss Challenge Procedure:

Certainly, the MOU that was proposed by Niko was presented in the
context of Niko’s then extant proposal. That specific proposal was not
pursued. To the contrary, the FOU was the Respondents’ (and the
Government of Bangladesh’s) proposal, not Niko’s. Had they wanted
to make provision for the inclusion of a Swiss Challenge (or other
competitive process), and had Niko been willing to agree to such in
the context of the FOU approach, doing so would have been simple to
achieve with clarity. Indeed, if the inclusion of such a process was so
fundamental as the Respondents now aver, one would expect it would
certainly have been made explicit.75+

In the Claimant’s view, the FOU provided for an award of the JVA without
competitive procedures, as it

1200.

. explicitly provided that the parties would execute a JVA upon
satisfactory completion of the study. This was not qualified by
reference to Swiss Challenge or any other bid procedure.7>>

The Claimant also relies on specific provisions in the FOU, including
Articles 4.03, 5.02 and 9.01. It explains that Article 5.5 FOU, providing
for exclusivity during the “negotiation period”, “rendered the application of
a Swiss Challenge process, at least as far as Niko is concerned, entirely
unworkable”.7°© In the Claimant’s view, the “negotiation period”
contemplated in the FOU “would end upon the execution of the JVA”.757
In this context, the Claimant also relies on the testimony of Mr Elahi who
“considered the study information could not be given to potential bidders
in the Swiss Challenge process, unless Niko first consented (which is
difficult to imagine)...”7>°

With respect to the reference to Swiss Challenge in Article 7.01, the
Claimant states that

... at best, the conditional nature of the reference to Swiss Challenge
suggests nothing more than that Swiss Challenge process might be
adopted in the future, although the circumstances in which that might
occur are nowhere defined in the FOU. This also contradicts the
Respondents’ assertion that Swiss Challenge process was
mandatory.7°9

The Claimant also points out that the reference to Swiss Challenge in the
FOU was made in the context of the provision on the “confidentiality of
the Program Information, not the process of arriving at an executed JVA”.
If there were a conflict between the “indirect contingent reference to Swiss
Challenge in Article 7.01” and the “very explicit commitment under Article
9.01 to execute a JVA with Niko upon successful completion of the study’,
the latter must prevail.7©°

More generally, the Claimant asserts that “a legal analysis of the terms of
the FOU and Marginal Fields Policy supports the position that a Swiss

Challenge process was not intended’. In support of this assertion, the
Claimant relies on:

. two independent legal opinions from different Bangladesh law
firms on the issue, each confirming that, on the basis of the terms of
the FOU and/or the provisions of the Marginal Field Policy, a Swiss
Challenge Process was either precluded or at least not required to be
undertaking in relation to the Chattak and Feni fields.7°!

1201. The Claimant insists that the issue of Swiss Challenge never was a
“sticking point” in the negotiations.’°? It asserts: “... [T/here is virtually no
indication of the issue of Swiss Challenge being a sticking point in the JVA
negotiations. Certainly, there is not a record similar to the Chattak East
issue of Niko pressing the issue with BAPEX, Petrobangla or the
Government.”763

1202. The Tribunals start their analysis by observing that Niko clearly included
in its June 1998 Proposal the use of a procedure which came to be
described thereafter as Swiss Challenge. While the draft MoU attached to
the proposal did not contain any reference to the Swiss Challenge method
but simply made reference to “internationally accepted terms and
conditions prevalent in agreements for the development of non producing,
marginal oil and gas fields’, this procedure was included in the proposal
and described it in some detail, as set out above.

1203. Niko confirmed this proposal in its letter of 1 February 2000:

Our proposal for the subject project is based upon utilising the
transparent process of Swiss Challenge as the award process to
ensure a public solicitation and availing the best offer from qualified
parties.76+

1204. There is evidence to show that, at that time, Niko did indeed plan on the
Swiss Challenge method being actually applied. When Mr Sharif reported
on 13 November 1999 to Niko Canada the status of the project and the
steps that remained to be taken, he wrote:

761 C-RC, paragraph 49.

762 C-RC, paragraph 4; C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 141.

1208.

After the MOU the ball will be back in petrobangla’s court to negotiate
with us and satisfy the requirements of the swiss challenge process
before signing the contract.7°5

The evidence also shows that the proposed use of the Swiss Challenge
procedure was considered by the Respondents and the Government. The
document dated 3 May 1999, concerning a meeting of the Ministry and
Petrobangla on 26 January 1999, records the discussion about Niko’s
proposal, leading to a positive conclusion, envisaging a joint venture
agreement between BAPEX and Niko. The decisions in this respect
conclude by a reference to the Swiss Challenge procedure:

In respect of development and producing gas from these gas fields
thle] Swiss Challenge Method might be abided by.7°°

The decision is formally notified to Petrobangla by a letter of the Ministry,
dated 25 May 1999. This letter is frequently referred to as the expression
of the Government’s decision to respond favourably to Niko’s June 1998
Proposal, instructing BAPEX to proceed with negotiations for the JVA.
The full text of the 25 May 1999 letter, in the two translations produced
in the Arbitrations, has been quoted above in Section 4.1. For the
discussion here, the Tribunals quote again the relevant part which
provides for the finalisation of the JVA before signing the MoU and then
states:

(c) Thereafter, steps may be taken to implement the proposal
prepared by Niko and BAPEX, after evaluation by using the Swiss
Challenge method, if necessary.7&”

In the Respondents’ earlier translation, this paragraph read as follows:

The ‘Swiss Challenge’ method may be adopted for developing the said
gas fields.7°8

The Tribunals note that neither of these versions states that the use of
the Swiss Challenge procedure is ordered. Both of them refer to this
procedure as a possibility: “may be adopted” or “might be abided by”. The

version that states “if necessary” provides no indication about the criteria
for determining when the use of Swiss Challenge would be necessary. The
report on the discussion preceding the text of the decision of 26 January
1999 does not contain any reference to Swiss Challenge and does not
provide an indication why the decision that followed this discussion
states that “the Swiss Challenge Method might be abided by”.7°9 The
Respondents have not provided any explanations in this respect.

The Tribunals conclude that, when it decided to accept Niko’s proposal
by initiating JVA negotiations, the Government did not take a firm
decision to the effect that Swiss Challenge had to be used. There is no
indication that in the context of this decision of 25 May 1999, the Swiss
Challenge procedure was considered as “mandatory” by the
Government.77°

Both the record of the 26 January 1999 meeting and the letter of 25 May
1999 are documents internal to the Ministry and Petrobangla. There is
no indication that they were intended to be communicated to Niko or that
they were formally communicated to Niko as acceptance of the June 1998
Proposal.

In this context it is of interest to consider the letter by which BAPEX
communicated to Niko the decision to enter into negotiations for a joint
venture agreement with it. BAPEX did so by its letter of 6 May 1999,77!
responding to Niko’s letter of 1 February 1999. In that letter, as pointed
out above, Niko had repeated its offer to base the project “upon utilising
the transparent process of Swiss Challenge as the award process to ensure
a public solicitation and availing the best offer from qualified parties” .77?

When BAPEX, in its response of 6 May 1999, announced the decision in
principle “to formulate a Joint Venture Agreement’ between BAPEX and
Niko, it specified that it was writing “with reference to” Niko’s 1 February

769 Minutes of the Meeting of the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources of 26 January 1999,
Exhibit C-124.

770 The ACC seems to have reached a similar conclusion by stating in the 5 May 2008 Charge Sheet that
“the provisio of Swiss Challenge system |...] was proposed to be adopted preventing tendering system and
the condition of ‘if needed’ was used to pave the way for refraining from adopting the Swiss challenge
system later” (Exhibit R-211).

1999 letter. One might consider that such a reference could imply the
acceptance of the Swiss Challenge method that Niko had proposed.
BAPEX does, however, not make any reference to Swiss Challenge, nor
does it state that it is prepared to execute the proposed MOU. It goes a
step further and clearly states at the end of the letter that it was “issued
WITHOUT ANY PREJUDICE and any obligation on the part of BAPEX”.77

1213. To recall, the use of the Swiss Challenge method, as understood in the
present case, implies that Niko is granted a privileged position in the
competition process: its technical qualification is accepted (while possible
other bidders will be examined for their qualification); and Niko is granted
a right of first refusal, the possibility to match competing bids. In other
words, it is not enough for the Respondents and the Government to say
they want to apply the Swiss Challenge method. A commitment to this
effect also requires that Niko’s technical qualification and its right of first
refusal are accepted. An invitation to negotiations for a joint venture
agreement without prejudice and without any commitment by BAPEX is
not an acceptance of the proposed use of Swiss Challenge.

1214. The Tribunals conclude that by May 1999 the Government had not taken
a firm decision on a requirement of Swiss Challenge and BAPEX had
refused to make any commitments. In other words, by that time, there
was no agreement between Niko and the Respondents on the use of
Swiss Challenge.

1215. The negotiations to which BAPEX invited Niko in May 1999 did indeed
lead to an agreement; but that agreement was not the MOU as Niko had
proposed it. Instead, the Respondents proposed a different approach and
the FOU was concluded. This agreement clearly states in its Article 9.01
that “on successful completion of the Technical Program & on the basis of
the acceptability of the result thereof the parties would execute a Joint
Venture Agreement.” The provision speaks not of negotiations of a Joint
Venture Agreement but of its execution. No mention is made in this
provision of any other procedures required before this execution.

1216. The Tribunals have considered the Respondents’ reliance on Article 7.1:

“if swiss challenge process is adopted, this is not applicable”. In the
Tribunals’ view the provision reserves the possibility of applying the Swiss

773 Letter from BAPEX to Niko, 6 May 1999, Exhibit C-125.

1218.

1220.

Challenge procedure. In other words, this procedure may be applied, but
not necessarily. The Respondents are correct when they write that “one
cannot infer [from this provision] an implicit exclusion of Swiss
Challenge” .774 Equally, one cannot infer from this provision a requirement
of the Swiss Challenge Procedure. The provision contains neither a
commitment, nor a confirmation of a prior commitment, to apply this
procedure. Consequently, it cannot be invoked as a basis for requiring
that, before a Joint Venture Agreement is executed according to Article
9.01, the negotiated agreement be submitted to the Swiss Challenge
procedure.

In the Tribunals’ analysis the evidence shows that there was no
agreement with the Government or the Respondents which required
the use of the Swiss Challenge prior to the conclusion of the JVA
with Niko.

9.6.6 The alleged insistence of the Respondents on the application of

Swiss Challenge

The Tribunals have concluded that Swiss Challenge was not required for
the Niko project under the procurement law of Bangladesh and that this
was recognised by the Marginal Fields Procedure; they have also
concluded that the FOU provided for the execution of the JVA and that
there was no contractual commitment to the effect that, upon completion
of the JVA negotiations, the final draft be subject to Swiss Challenge.

The Respondents argue that they insisted on the application of the
Swiss Challenge method and that Niko was aware of this condition. They
deny the Claimant’s assertion that the requirement of Swiss Challenge
was never a “sticking point”.775

According to the Respondents, the Government and the Respondents
continued to insist on the application of the Swiss Challenge procedure.
The Respondents rely on the passage from the Minutes of the 22 October
2000 meeting of the Petrobangla Board of Directors quoted above and on
the correspondence from the Ministry in March and April 2001

774 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 126.
775 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 144.

354

The Government maintained its position on Swiss Challenge through
the end of the Awami League administration, as reflected by two
Ministry letters sent in March and April of 2001, as well as a
handwritten note by the Minister himself, to “Plfease] write to
[Petrobangla] to formalize/finalize the JVA before putting it to Swiss
Challenge.”776

1221. The following passages are relevant:

()

(ii)

A letter dated 29 March 2001 from the Ministry (signed Md
Mizanur Rahman, Senior Assistant Secretary) to the Chairman of
Petrobangla:

... you are requested to take necessary steps for finalizing the JVA by
following the swiss challenge method after completion of necessary
negotiation in light of in accordance with the guidelines prepared in
light of the feasibility study completed for development and possible
increase of production of Chattak, Kamta and Feni Non-producing
marginal/ abandoned gas fields by Canadian entity Niko resources
Limited.777

A letter dated 16 April 2001 from the Ministry (also signed by Md
Mizanur Rahman, Senior Assistant Secretary) to the Chairman of
Petrobangla:

... attention is being drawn to letter dated 5 April 2001 from Niko 2001
from Niko Resources (Bangladesh) (copy enclosed). Regarding this
matter, before going for a Swiss Challenge, as per instructions you
are being requested to formalize/finalize the JVA submitted by
Petrobangla.778

1222. The handwritten note quoted by the Respondents can be found on Niko’s

1223.

letter of 5 April 2001 in the version produced by the Respondents. The
Respondents assert that this note is “by the Minister himself’ but do not
indicate on what basis this assertion is made.

For their assertion that Niko knew of the importance of their insistence
on the application of the Swiss Challenge method and resisted it, the

Respondents rely on Mr Chowdhury’s witness statement where he
asserted that “Niko was now insisting that the Swiss Challenge procedure
should not be applied to them because they argued that the FoU and the
procedure for the development of marginal gas fields somehow prohibited
it’.779 He confirmed at the Hearing that “after that, Niko was insisting that
Swiss Challenge was not necessary in that case”.78°

In the Respondents’ view, the legal opinions of 1 November 2000 and of
27 February 2003 which the Claimant presented to the Government78!
and which both address the Swiss Challenge issue, are also evidence that
Niko considered this issue as one of serious concern.782

The Respondents conclude:

Clearly, Niko knew the Government intended to apply Swiss
Challenge. That intention was overcome only after the BNP
administration came to power; after the new Acting Secretary of the
Energy and Mineral Resources Division was removed for refusing to
accede to the State Minister’s demand that he request an opinion from
the Law Minister; and after that Law Minister issued a legal opinion
which, from the available record, was facially irrational. By that time,
according to Qasim Sharif, the parties had been fighting over both
Chattak East and Swiss Challenge “for years [...], for three four
years, "783

The Claimant states that by July 2001, at the end of the Sheikh Hasina’s
Awami League Government, “there was no reference to a Swiss Challenge
process being applied” .78+

More generally, the Claimant asserts that the issue of Swiss Challenge
did not arise in its discussions with the Respondents:

Significantly, there is no indication from the contemporaneous
correspondence that BAPEX and Petrobangla were taking the position
that a Swiss Challenge process was applicable, let alone mandatory,

1231.

nor is there any indication of Niko insisting on its non-application. This
is consistent with the evidence of Bill Hornaday, who recalls that at
this time the inclusion of Chattak East was the issue under debate.7®5

After the Hearing, the Claimant confirmed this position as quoted above,
arguing that, contrary to the controversial issue of Chattak East, the
application Swiss Challenge was no serious issue:

... there is virtually no indication of the issue of Swiss Challenge being
a sticking point in JVA negotiations. Certainly, there is not a record
similar to the Chattak East issue of Niko pressing the issue with
BAPEX, Petrobangla or the Government.78®

As to the evidence on which the Respondents rely in order to show that
the Swiss Challenge issue was alive during this period, the Claimant
argues that it reveals no more than

... internal discussions between BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Ministry
of Energy as to whether the Swiss Challenge process was required
[...] there is virtually no reference to Swiss Challenge being discussed
with Niko in negotiations after 2001, let alone any suggestion that
Niko was vehemently opposed to it.787

Addressing Mr Chowdhury’s assertion about Niko’s insistent objection to
the application of Swiss Challenge, the Claimant points out that, at the
Hearing,

... Mr. Chowdhury conceded during his testimony that he had no
personal knowledge of Niko having sought to avoid a Swiss Challenge
process, despite having implied that in his Witness Statement.788

The Tribunals are of the view that the internal documents reflecting the
Respondents’ view about the requirement of applying the Swiss Challenge
method are not sufficient to establish an understanding between the
Parties that this method must be applied. As explained above, the Swiss
Challenge method is not simply a procedure by which the Respondents
invite offers from interested companies. It implies a commitment from the
Respondents to afford to Niko a preferential position insofar as its
technical qualification is accepted and the assurance that it will be given
the option to match any offer from other companies that are more

favourable to the Respondents. The fact that BAPEX, in its letter of 6 May
1999, clearly stated that it proposed discussions “WITHOUT ANY
PREJUDICE and any obligation on the part of BAPEX” makes it quite clear
that no agreement on the use of Swiss Challenge had been concluded at
that stage; and, as explained, there is no evidence that such an
agreement was concluded later.

1232. Nevertheless, the positions which the Government and the Respondents
took during negotiations about the JVA is not without relevance for the
question whether this agreement was procured by corruption. The
Tribunal therefore will examine whether the position about the Swiss
Challenge method was held consistently and how it was eventually
overcome.

1233. While conducting this examination, the Tribunals noted that both the 22
October 2000 meeting and the correspondence of March and April 2001
took place before the adoption of the Marginal Fields Procedure by the
Sheikh Hasina’s Awami League Government. Neither can therefore be
taken as evidence of the position taken by the Government and the
Respondents during the period thereafter.

1234. The Tribunals also observe, however, that over a year after this adoption,
the issue of Swiss Challenge was indeed revived during the time of the
BNP Government. This occurred during the meeting on 16 September
2002 which, according to the Minutes of the meeting, was presided by
the “Secretary of Energy and Mineral Resources”, presumably Mr
Chowdhury, as “Acting Secretary of Energy”, and attended by the
Chairman of Petrobangla and the Managing Director of BAPEX.789

1235. Mr Chowdhury explained in his Witness Statement that he “believed that
the JVA could not be awarded without competition and Petrobangla and
BAPEX agreed”.7°° At the Hearing, he confirmed “we all agreed [...] that
we should go for Swiss Challenge”; and he added that he had asked
Petrobangla “to come up with a formal proposal because Petrobangla [...]
never submitted a concrete proposal to the Ministry about this matter’.79!
In his witness statement he had explained:

We determined that the best way to proceed would be to have
Petrobangla prepare a proposal on the application of Swiss Challenge
to the consideration of the Ministry. I knew that Petrobangla would
conclude that the Swiss Challenge process should be followed.79?

But the Minutes of the 16 September 2002 meeting create a different
impression. They do not reflect a unanimous conclusion, as Mr
Chowdhury asserted. Instead they reflect doubts about the correct
approach. The Minutes show that the discussion referred to the original
decision of the Government of 25 May 1999 and compared it to the terms
of the FOU and the Marginal Fields Procedure. The discussion concluded
that the issue required further examination. The Minutes record:

It needs to be examined whether the Swiss Challenge Method is
applicable for BAPEX-Niko JVA as per the FOU signed by Niko with
BAPEX on 23-08-1999 and the Procedure for Development of
Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Fields issued by the Government in 2001
as well as in accordance with the letter dated 25-05-1999 sent from
this department to Petrobangla.79%

The Minutes do indeed record that Petrobangla should make a “proposal’;
but, according to the Minutes, this proposal was not simply the formal
confirmation of a foregone conclusion as implied by Mr Chowdhury’s
statement. Petrobangla was invited to resolve the doubts that had been
voiced during the meeting. The following decision was taken:

Petrobangla will submit specific proposal concerning whether, as per
the FOU signed by Niko with BAPEX on 23-08-1999 and the
Procedure for Development of Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Fields issued
by the Government in 2001, Swiss Challenge Method is applicable for
the BAPEX-Niko JVA.7%4

Whether doubts about the correct position prevailed at the meeting, as
the Minutes suggest, or the participants were unanimous, as asserted by
Mr Choudhury, one point seems clear: the situation required
clarification. Even in Mr Chowdhury’s explanation, the participants felt
the need to clarify the position and they decided, according to him, to
obtain a “proposal” from Petrobangla of which they knew already the
conclusion. The Minutes however show that the clarification which Mr

Chowdhury sought to obtain by this “proposal’ concerned the question
whether, in view of the FOU and the Marginal Fields Procedure, Swiss
Challenge was required or not.

Mr Chowdhury left the Ministry in “late September” 2002;795 the record
does not show that, by that time or at any time thereafter, Petrobangla
did indeed prepare the “specific proposal’ as provided at the 16
September 2002 meeting. The next document on record concerning this
issue is a letter from BAPEX dated 9 October 2002 which provides
comments on the Minutes of the 16 September 2002 meeting. BAPEX
expresses its opinion as follows:

The decision regarding the acceptance of the Swiss Challenge
procedure resides in the Ministry’s [letter of 25 May 1999]. With the
exception of this, as per the comments given in the explanation note
of section 10 of Procedure for development of Marginal/ Abandoned
gas fields with the other subjects, there is no option of excluding the
Swiss Challenge because the due proposal by Niko is an unsolicited
offer. The given decision [sic] can be amended in the minutes as “To
follow the Swiss Challenge procedure will be reasonable to make the
proposed JV transparent. ”796

It does not seem clear what the exception resulting from the comments
to the Procedure is meant to say. The proposed addition in the Minutes,
however, is clear: Swiss Challenge is not mandatory but “will be
reasonable” for reasons of transparency.

Petrobangla passed these observations from BAPEX on to the Ministry on
the following day, 10 October 2002, seeking “specific guidance” from the
Ministry:

Regarding the acceptance of the Swiss Challenge Procedure, as per
the decision referred in section 3.19 of the minutes on following the
Swiss Challenge Procedure, the appropriate authority can take
necessary steps as per link no — EFMR/AR - 4/NIKO Reso: -
22/97/204 dated: 05-25-1999 of the ministry.797

This communication simply makes reference to the Government’s letter
of 25 May 1999 but does not address the FOU and the Marginal Fields

Procedure, as Petrobangla had been instructed to do. In other words,
Petrobangla was not here coming to grips with the uncertainty that had
prevailed at the 16 September 2002 meeting and passed the unresolved
question on to the Ministry.

There is no indication that Petrobangla or the Ministry ever issued the
“proposal’ that had to be submitted according to the Minutes of the 16
September 2002 meeting in order to clarify whether, in view of the FOU
and the Marginal Fields Procedure, Swiss Challenge was still applicable.

When the Ministry wrote to Petrobangla on 30 October 2002, complaining
that it still had not received the draft BAPEX/Niko JVA, it referred to the
decisions of the 16 September meeting; but it made no mention of Swiss
Challenge. 798

The evidence on record shows that thereafter the internal consultations
and the negotiations with Niko concentrated on a number of technical
and commercial issues, including the question of Chattak East. A letter
from BAPEX to Petrobangla, dated 30 January 2003, reported on the
progress of the negotiations and the report of a committee composed of
representatives of BAPEX and Petrobangla who had examined the latest
draft of the JVA and decisions of the BAPEX company board. The last
item on the list of decisions states:

Petrobangla may be served with a letter for taking proper steps in
regard to taking measures for appointing contractors based on Swiss
Challenge method before signing the final JVA in light of the
Government decision dated 16/09/2002.799

There is no indication that Petrobangla was indeed served with such a
letter. Indeed, while the other technical and commercial issues raised in
the 30 January 2003 letter were dealt with in subsequent negotiations,
the Swiss Challenge issue seems to have had no follow-up. There is no
indication that Petrobangla did indeed take any steps to initiate the Swiss
Challenge procedure; there is not even a confirmation by Petrobangla that

it intended to take the steps necessary for proceeding with the Swiss
Challenge method.

1247. The uncertainty that had been raised at the 16 September 2002 meeting
was addressed in a the legal opinion dated 27 February 2003 signed by
Md Azizul Haq of Mudud Ahmed and Associates®°° and submitted by Niko
with its letter to the State Minister of 3 March 2003.8°! The opinion deals
with the inclusion of Chattak East in the area of the JVA and then with
the requirement of Swiss Challenge. Relying on the FOU and the Marginal
Fields Procedure, the opinion concludes that “there is no legal ground for
Bapex, Petrobangla or GOB to conduct Swiss Challenge or any other form
of bidding for this project’ .8°2

1248. Following this opinion, there is no further reference to Swiss Challenge
in the documents on record: In the letter by which it presented the
opinion to the Government Niko discussed the Joint meeting with the
Ministry, Petrobangla and BAPEX. It argued its position concerning
Chattak East but made no reference to Swiss Challenge or other
competitive procedures.8°° On 5S March 2003, BAPEX wrote to
Petrobangla, commenting on Niko’s presentation at the meeting and in
the letter. It noted “conflicting views between
BAPEX/Petrobangla/ Ministry and NIKO” with respect to the Chattak field
and recommended that the Government seek the advice of the Law
Ministry. BAPEX did not mention Swiss Challenge and made no reference
to the views expressed on that subject in the legal opinion present by
Niko, nor did it refer to the views expressed in its letter of 30 January
2003.804

1249. As discussed above in the context of the Chattak issue, an opinion was
requested from the Law Ministry and provided in terms reported in a
letter of 1 April 2003 from the Ministry to Petrobangla with copy to

BAPEX.®° Following the information about the Law Ministry’s opinion on
Chattak, the letter states that “Petrobangla may take necessary action to
finalise the matter of signing of Joint Venture Agreement ...”; in
alternative translation the passage speaks of “necessary action to finalise
the signature of the Joint Venture Agreement ...”.8°© No reservation of the

Swiss Challenge issue is made.

1250. The record about the communications between the different entities on
the Bangladeshi side and their internal decisions produced in the
Arbitrations does not seem to be complete. The evidence produced shows
details about the negotiations for the completion of the JVA and in
particular its fiscal terms but no reference to the Swiss Challenge issue
since the 30 January 2003 letter of BAPEX. At the meeting of the
Petrobangla Managing Committee of 22 July 2003, for instance, a
detailed account of the latest issues in the JVA negotiations and their
resolution is provided and the remaining steps are identified. Again there
is no mention of any requirement for further steps of competition nor of
a Swiss Challenge procedure still outstanding. 897

1251. The Claimant also pointed out that there were “clear and present
practical challenges to implementing” the Swiss Challenge Process.8°8
There is no indication that these were considered at the time and that
any preparations for applying Swiss Challenge had been made on the
part of the Respondents. As Petrobangla had noted in its 1998
Comments, applying Swiss Challenge starts by the conclusion of an MOU
“to initiate negotiations by both parties in good faith for this project’ .8°9 No
such MOU had been concluded and, as pointed out above, the record
shows no evidence that any engagement had been taken by the
Respondents that Niko’s preferential position would be assured. In the
view of Mr Chowdhury the situation of Niko remained uncertain, even
with respect to the question whether Niko had the right of first refusal:

805 Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 1 April 2003, Exhibit C-
153 and, with a different translation, R-307.

806 Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 1 April 2003, Exhibits C-
153 and R-307.

809 Exhibit R-267, paragraph B 3.5.

363

1252.

1253.

1254.

That was likely, but since the terms of the Swiss Challenge were not
finalised - I cannot say for certain, but it is likely that Niko has to get
the option of right of refusal.®!°

Since Mr Chowdhury left his function in the Ministry in September 2002,
this statement must be understood as relating to the situation by that
time. There no explanation about any subsequent steps taken to “finalise”
the terms of the Swiss Challenge procedure. One must conclude that
these terms were never finalised.

Moreover, applying the Swiss Challenge process requires procedures to
be followed. In particular, potential competitors are invited to make
proposals which, as underlined by Mr Chowdhury, consist in a
commercial and a technical offer.8!1 Mr Chowdhury explained that, in his
understanding, the draft JVA negotiated with Niko would be made
available to potential bidders: “they will provide the JVA to all the offerors,
so that they consider and they come up with a better proposal than
Niko” .8!2 In order to allow such other offerors to make their proposal on
the same basis as Niko, they would have to be provided with the same
information. Mr Chowdhury explained that the information gathered by
the joint Niko/BAPEX Study at the expense of Niko would have to be
“made available to those who participate in the Swiss Challenge”. He did
not think that this would be free of charge but he did not know what the
conditions would have been, as these conditions had not been discussed
to his knowledge.8!8

Applying Swiss Challenge also requires that the proposals, once they
have been received, are evaluated and ranked by reference to criteria that
have to be determined in advance. If there are offers that meet the
technical requirements they will have to be examined with respect to the
commercial conditions. If the commercial conditions of any of the bidders
that are found technically qualified are better than those of Niko, Niko
will have the right to match them, assuming that had been clarified in
the “finalised” Swiss Challenge procedure.

1255. Concerning the implementation of this process, Mr Elahi stated in his
witness statement that, during his time as Managing Director of BAPEX
(5S August 2001 to 9 July 2003),8!4

There were competing companies, such as Unocal, that would have
been interested in exploring the Chattak field, particularly Chattak
East, and it was our intention to given them the opportunity to
compete with Niko for this work. This was even more important after
BAPEX and Petrobangla were ordered to include Chattak East in the
JVA because this was an exploration target/prospect that should
have been put up for bid in a bid round for PSC under the standard
procedure in Bangladesh used for petroleum exploration.®15

1256. At the Hearing, Mr Elahi clarified that “Unocal came to me twice”.8!© He
did not identify the persons who contacted him but simply stated that
they were “Unocal professionals”. He recognised, however, that, according
to the Marginal Fields Procedure, Unocal was barred from pursuing
marginal field development, adding “that is why they could not pursue
vigorously because there was a bar’. He summarised his explanations:

So it was basically the Unocal professionals, they came to me and
they have shown their interest, but I could not proceed with them
because there was a bar in the procedure for the development of the
marginal gas fields I was dealing with, and for exploration area it was
not within my purview. It was the purview within the Petrobangla and
I told them please go to Petrobangla and talk to them and settle over
there.817

1257. Mr Elahi explained that he “did not maintain a record” and he did not
know what happened at Petrogangla where he sent the Unical
professionals to discuss matters of a PSC for Chattak East. As to
marginal and abandoned fields, “no other company came”, Mr Elahi did
not remember any other company having shown interest.

817 Tr. Day 4 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 267.

1258. There is indeed no indication that any eligible company showed interest

in the fields to which the JVA applied; nor is there any indication that
the Respondents or the Government had sought to identify any potential
candidates. Indeed, Mr Chowdhury explained that no companies had
been identified to him; but there was the expectation “if they invite, they
might get better offers’.®!8 When Mr Elahi left in July 2003, no potential
bidders thus had been identified. He explained that applying the Swiss
Challenge process would have meant to “put it in the newspaper’ and that
“internationally there could be a number of companies for this. There are
many small companies [...] There are hundreds of companies”.®!9

1259. If there had been any companies that showed interest in response to the

newspaper adds, they would have had to be given the same information
that had been available to Niko during the work on the Study. Contrary
to Mr Chowdury, Mr Elahi was of the opinion that “it would not have been
prudent” to give to the bidders the Study prepared by Niko and BAPEX.820
According to Mr Elahi the interested bidders would do the “same
exercise”.82! As summarised by the Respondents’ counsel, Mr Elahi was
of the opinion that the “other companies would have the exact same
opportunity to do the exact same thing before putting in their bids”.822
Through this exercise, which took Niko some six months, the bidders
would seek to achieve the same degree of knowledge which Niko had
reached through the Study under the FOU at its own expense,825
enabling them to submit bids which then would have to be evaluated.

1260. None of these points had been addressed, let alone settled in June 2001,

The situation had not changed in 2002 when Mr Chowdhury was at the
Ministry, and it had not changed in 2003 when the JVA was finalised.
There is no indication that throughout the JVA negotiations until their
very end, the issues that had to be addressed for the implementation of
a Swiss Challenge process had been considered and no allowance was

made for the time required after the completion of the JVA negotiations
for these steps.

The Tribunals conclude that, at the latest since the time of the
Marginal Fields Procedure of the Awami League Government, the
application of the Swiss Challenge procedure was no longer a serious
concern of the Respondents. The question concerning the effect of the
MOU and the Marginal Fields Procedure, raised at the 16 September
2002 meeting, was not resolved by a “proposal’. In practice, the conduct
of the Respondents, as it results from the evidence on record, suggests
that they did not count on the application of Swiss Challenge.
Although finalisation or even signature of the JVA had been instructed,
no action was taken to prepare the implementation of the Swiss
Challenge process, nor was there any indication that the time necessary
for this implementation was allowed or even considered. The letter of
BAPEX of 30 January 2003 proposing that Petrobangla take steps to this
effect remained without effect.

In these circumstances there is also no basis for assuming that any
company would have shown interest in the project and would have
been prepared to engage in time and costs for making the evaluation
necessary for submitting a technical and commercial bid. For the same
reason there is no basis for assuming that there would have been any
bids more favourable than the terms that the Respondents had
negotiated with Niko.

The Swiss Challenge issue was eventually resolved by a second opinion
of the Law Ministry.825 In the Arbitrations this second opinion was
presented as attachment to the letter of the Ministry to Petrobangla and
BAPEX, dated 11 October 2003. The signatures on this opinion show
various dates, between 21 and 29 August 2003.

No information has been provided about the circumstances in which this
second opinion was prepared, such as the source of the proposal that

such an opinion be prepared, or the reasons were given for it..

Mr Chowdhury wrote in his Witness Statement:

825 Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 11 October 2003, Exhibit
R-280; for details see below Section 9.7.

367

When the [State] Minister saw that I would not give in to his efforts to
get me to approve the Niko project on Niko’s terms, he began to insist
that I submit the matter to the Law Ministry for a legal opinion on the
interpretation of the FoU.826

1266. From the Witness Statement it appears that the request concerned only
the Chattak issue.827 At the Hearing Mr Chowdhury’s explanations about
this request also extended to the issue of Swiss Challenge.828 At the
Hearing he also clarified that the request was made “in the July/August
2002 time-frame” .829 Mr Chowdhury was replaced at the Ministry towards
the end of September 2002.

1267. The explanations of Mr Chowdhury concerning a request in July/August
2002 cannot cast light on what happened a year later with respect to this
issue, this all the less so since the evidence shows that the request that
prompted the opinion about the Chattak issue was suggested by BAPEX
and not by the State Minister. Moreover, if the opinion was sought on
request of the State Minister, the question remains why in April 2003
only the Chattak issue was submitted to the Law Ministry and not both
issues.

1268. The opinion resolved the question that had been raised at the 16
September 2002 meeting. Any doubts that may have remained about the
requirement of the Swiss Challenge method were removed. The
application of the Swiss Challenge method was not required.

1269. The opinion was attached to the letter by which the Ministry gave
instruction to conclude the JVA, thus demonstrating that the decisive
step resolving any remaining difference concerning the requirement of
applying the Swiss Challenge method was the opinion of the Law Ministry
in August 2003, concluding that the Swiss Challenge method was not
mandatory and that, in any event, it had been excluded by the FOU.

9.6.7 Conclusions on the requirement to apply Swiss Challenge method

The transaction for which the JVA was concluded is not a case of
“procurement”, providing goods or services for which the Government or
a public entity has identified the need and the general terms at which
they are to be provided. Instead it grants rights in response to resources
which, at the time of the proposal the Government had not considered as
a valuable resource that could be subject of exploitation. Niko proposed
to unlock these resources, providing gas to the local market and revenue
to BAPEX without any financial contribution by the Government,
Petrobangla or BAPEX.

The Procurement Regulations in Bangladesh did not make any provision
for such a process. While the Respondents now argue that competitive
procedures should have been implemented for the conclusion of the JVA,
they do not indicate any specific procedures required for this particular
type of transaction, apart from the Swiss Challenge method. The
Tribunals concluded that there is no applicable provision in the
procurement law of Bangladesh that required competition for a contract
like the JVA.

Nor is the Swiss Challenge method provided for anywhere in the
procurement law of Bangladesh. Such a procedure was unknown in
Bangladesh before it was mentioned in Niko’s proposal of 28 June 1998.
The Tribunals conclude that there was no legal requirement to use this
method. Contrary to the Respondents’ assertions, Swiss Challenge was
not “mandatory” or otherwise required.

Niko had offered the use of Swiss Challenge in its proposal to the Ministry
of 28 June 1998 and confirmed this offer in its letter to Petrobangla of 1
February 1999. This offer was not accepted by the Ministry, nor by
Petrobangla or BAPEX. Instead, when BAPEX invited Niko for JVA
negotiations on 6 May 1999, it specified that this was done without
prejudice and without “any obligation on the part of BAPEX”. On 25 May
1999 the Ministry informed Petrobangla of its decision to proceed with
the project. It referred to the Swiss Challenge method, but qualified the
reference by the words “if necessary”, thus reserving the decision whether
the additional time and complications of this procedure were justified.

1274.

1275.

1276.

1277.

1278.

1279.

At no time did any of the Bangladeshi parties make any commitments
concerning the acceptance of Niko’s technical qualifications and its right
to match better offers which are essential elements of the Swiss Challenge
method, as understood by the Parties in the present case. The Tribunals
conclude that there was no agreement on the use of Swiss Challenge.

The approach which Niko had described in its proposal of 28 June 1998
was modified at the request of the Bangladeshi parties. Instead of
concluding an MoU, as Niko had proposed, Niko was required to perform,
jointly with BAPEX but at its expense, a study on the identified areas and
concluded with BAPEX the FOU of 23 August 1999. In the FOU, with the
approval of the Government, BAPEX agreed to conclude the JVA without
any requirement for Swiss Challenge or other competitive procedure.

The Marginal Fields Procedure of June 2001 made it clear that the Swiss
Challenge method was not required, whether as part of Bangladesh
procurement law or per agreement to that effect.

Under the BNP Government the question of a Swiss Challenge
requirement was raised at a meeting on 16 September 2002, in light of
the FOU and the Marginal Fields Procedure. At that meeting Petrobangla
was instructed to prepare a “proposal” concerning these issues. No such
proposal was produced in the Arbitrations. The issue was not, on the
evidence before the Tribunals, pursued in the final negotiations for the
JVA. The issues that had to be dealt with in order to implement a Swiss
Challenge Procedure were never addressed and no preparation for such
implementation were made even at a time when the completion and
execution of the JVA was imminent.

Possible doubts concerning the requirement of Swiss Challenge were
removed by the second legal opinion of the Law Ministry in late August
2003 which determined that the Swiss Challenge procedure was not
applicable.

The Tribunals conclude that there was no requirement to apply the Swiss

Challenge method before concluding the JVA. In their opinion, the
conclusion of the JVA without such application does not constitute

370

any irregularity. The High Court Division of the Supreme Court
reached the same conclusion in the BELA Judgement.®°°

9.7 The Opinions of the Law Ministry

1280. In the resolution of the two controversial issues which held up the
conclusion of the JVA, the opinions of the Law Ministry played a decisive
role: it was following the opinion concerning Chattak East that the
Respondents accepted that the JVA extend to the entire Chattak Field,
and the opinion concerning the Swiss Challenge method was provided
before the JVA was eventually executed.

9.7.1 The Parties’ position

1281. The Respondents argue that “the impropriety of the Law Minister’s
opinion [...] is sufficient to render any decision made on the basis of that
opinion without legal effect.”851

1282. The Respondents criticise the opinion on a number of grounds, partly
contradictory, that require some preliminary clarifications:

(i) The Respondents speak of one opinion, asserting that the opinion
“was apparently given orally in March and then in writing in August
2003” .852 The record shows that the Ministry prepared two opinions,
one concerning Chattak East, the other Swiss Challenge. The first
opinion has not been produced but is summarised in the Ministry’s
letter of 1 April 2003;895 the other opinion, signed at different dates
at the end of August 2003, was attached to the Ministry’s letter of
11 October 2003.88+

The Respondents assert that they “made every effort to locate the
opinion of the Law Minister, but it cannot be found’.835 They see in
their inability to find the opinion a reflection of “the irregularity of
the process”, while the Claimant considers this claimed inability as
surprising and unbelievable.8°© The Respondents rely only on the
description of the “content of the opinion” in the Ministry’s letter of
11 October 2003.837 As shown above, the August 2003 opinion,
including its signature page, have been found and were produced in
the Arbitrations as attachment to the 11 October 2003 letter.838

The Respondents speak of an “opinion of the Law Minister’®°° or even
of “Mr Ahmed’s opinion’,84° while the documentary evidence
systematically speaks not of opinions of the Minister but of the Law
Ministry. The April 2003 summary of the first opinion states that
“the Ministry of Law has expressed its opinion” and the August 2003
opinion itself is signed by several high level members of the Ministry.
The assertion that one of the signatures is that of the Minister
himself is contested.

At the Hearing, the Respondents stated clearly:

There is no claim made by the Respondents about this opinion having
been obtained as a result of corruption. The only thing that the
Respondents have advanced with respect to this opinion is that it was
obtained when the Minister had a conflict of interest.84!

Yet in their Second Post-Hearing Submission the Respondents assert
that the “Law Minister’s opinion was tainted by corruption’®4? and
“Corruption is the only explanation for the Law Minister’s disregard of the
considered views of other officials and his unreasonable and extreme
position favoring Niko” .843

which will be considered below in Section 10, the Respondents’ criticism

of the Law Ministry’s opinions concern the alleged conflict of interest of
the Minister and the content of the opinions. The Claimant’s positions on
these issues will be presented in the relevant sections below.

Given the contradictory information about the Law Ministry’s opinions,
the Tribunal will first examine the available evidence about the origin and
content of these opinions.

9.7.2 The evidence about the Law Ministry’s opinions

As explained above, it appears clearly from the evidence that there were
two opinions provided by the Law Ministry, the first presented some time
in March 2003 concerning Chattak East, the second issued in August
2003 concerning Swiss Challenge.

The first opinion has not been produced. Although the Respondents
assert that they have not been able to find the opinion, they compare it
with those which Niko submitted to the Ministry. They do not state on
what basis these comparisons are made. Since there is on record no other
documentary evidence about the content of the first opinion but the
Ministry’s letter of 1 April 2003,844 the Tribunals conclude that the
comparison can only be based on the summary in this letter.

Following Niko’s joint presentation, summarised in Niko’s letter of 3
March 2003,845 and Petrobangla’s memorandum of 5 March 2003,846
BAPEX, in its letter to Petrobangla of 5 March 2003, took note “that there
are conflicting views between BAPEX/Petrobangla/Ministry and NIKO”
and concluded:

In such circumstances, in order to reach a final determination of the
definition of the Marginal/Abandoned Gas Field and what the
boundary will be, the Government may, if it deems necessary, seek
the advice of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary
Affairs.847

The Tribunals conclude that the first opinion was requested some time
after S March 2003 and produced towards the end of March 2003.

The Respondents also assert that Mr Shahidul Islam, Mr Chowdhury’s
replacement as Acting Secretary in the Ministry, “promptly” after Mr
Chowdhury’s transfer at the end of September 2002848 “requested an
opinion from the Law Minister’.8*9 There is no evidence of such a request
by Mr Islam,85° nor for an opinion from the “Law Minister’ in response.
The letter of 1 April 2003 is signed by “Shafiqur Rahman, Senior Assistant
Secretary” and there is no mention of Mr Islam. If Mr Islam did make a
request, as alleged by the Respondents, there is no trace of it — direct or
by reference — in the record.

The suggestion of BAPEX was implemented and the advice of the Law
Ministry was sought. There is no indication that Petrobangla and the
Ministry did not support the suggestion. The Tribunals conclude that the
opinion of the Law Ministry was sought upon suggestion of BAPEX
with the support of Petrobangla and the Ministry.

The letter of 1 April 2003 states the opinion was sought “to resolve the
dispute between BAPEX and Niko regarding Chattak Gas Field’. There is
no mention of any other dispute in that letter. In particular, there is no
reference to Swiss Challenge. The Tribunals conclude that the first
opinion concerned only the Chattak issue.

The second opinion has not been produced either. The Respondents
assert that this opinion is equally inaccessible to them.8°! The
Respondents have, however, produced an extract of it, including the
signature page.

This extract has been produced together with a letter from the Ministry
to Petrobangla, with copy to BAPEX, dated 11 October 2003. The letter

848 Mr Chowdhury left his position in the Ministry in late September 2002 by which time, as he testified, he
had been replaced (Chowdhury Witness Statement, paragraph 16).

849 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 169 and Footnote 287.

850 The Respondents refer to p. 1 of the ACC Charge Sheet, Exhibit R-211, which does indeed name Mr
Islam among the accused persons, but makes no mention of the alleged request.

itself has been produced in three translations, with slight variations.852
It communicates “the approved direction” of the Prime Minister.

The letter contains two references to an opinion of the Law Ministry. The
first reference states that “in light of the opinion by the Ministry of Law,
Justice and Parliamentary Affairs the Chattak Gas Field will be considered
as per Exhibit A” of the FOU. In the circumstances, the Tribunals
conclude that the opinion referred to is the first opinion of March 2003.

The letter gives directions for the signing of the JVA, following the “entire
terms & conditions and the related rules” of the Marginal Fields Procedure.
It concludes with a sentence which, in one of the translations, reads as
follows:

On the above mentioned subject matter the opinion (Photocopy) of the
Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs provided on 25-
08-2003 AD has been sent for taking required steps.°3

All three translations mention two enclosures: two pages and a copy of
the JVA. The Tribunals conclude that a copy of the Law Ministry’s opinion
was joined to this letter, together with a copy of the JVA to be executed.
Of the three exhibits producing this letter, however, only Exhibit R-280
is produced with an enclosure.854

This enclosure in Exhibit R-280 consists of two pages of text followed by
a number of signatures.

The document does not seem to be the complete opinion; it has no
heading and the page and paragraph numbers seem out of sequence. The
extract of the opinion that has been produced deals with the Swiss
Challenge issue. It recites the history of the negotiations, referring
specifically to the Government’s decision of 25 May 1999 and to the FOU.
The document states that, according to the 25 May 1999 decision,
“following Swiss Challenge Method or any other tender method was not
mandatory, that was optional. In that decision, the mention of the phrase

‘if necessary’ would indicate that.” Referring to Article 5.05 FOU, the
opinion declares that Swiss Challenge would constitute a breach of that
obligation, entailing claims for damages.

1300. The signatures following the text are arranged in two blocks. The first
block consists of signatures and stamps of five persons identified as high-
ranking persons from the Ministry of Justice, with different dates
between 13 and 29 August 2003. The second block, under the heading
“attested”, consists of the signatures of four other persons. Two of these
signatories are identified by titles from the Ministry of Energy; two others
as “Honourable Minister’, without stating which Ministry. The last date
on the page is 25 August 2003.

1301. The signature page, in the Bengali original, appears as follows:

1303. The signature block of the second opinion, as presented above, shows
clearly that the opinion is presented under the responsibility of five senior
officials of the Law Ministry, in the position of Secretary, Deputy
Secretary, Joint Secretary, Assistant Secretary, and an Additional
Secretary. The Law Minister is not among them. If the Law Minister is
one of the two “Honorable Ministers” at the bottom of the page, his
signature appears in a separate block under “Attested” in a place distinct
from the senior officials in the block under the opinion.

1304. The Respondents assert that “it is clear that Moudud Ahmed was involved
in the Ministry legal opinion — his signature appears on the August 2003

extract’.855 They explain the assertion in a footnote: “/wjhere the English
translation indicates a signature of an Honourable Minister on the bottom
right corner, Moudud Ahmed’s signature appears in the original’ 856

The Claimant points out that there is no evidence for this. The Law
Minister is not identified as such, even though one might assume that
one of the two “Honourable Ministers” is the Law Minister. The Claimant
adds that “none of the signatures on the Bangla version matches the
signature of Moudud Ahmed.”857 Furthermore, even if there were such
evidence, the signature of the Honourable Ministers is at a location
distinct from the senior officials first identified. In any event, the
identification of these five senior officials clearly shows that it is an
opinion of the Law Ministry and not one of the Law Minister personally.
As the Claimant states, “the mere presence of his signature certainly
would not reveal what input, if any, Moudud Ahmed himself had on the
preparation and substance of the opinion”.

No such signature page has been produced for the first opinion regarding
the Chattak issue. The letter summarising the first opinion states,
however, that it was the “Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary
Affairs” that was requested and it was the “Ministry of Law” that
“expressed its opinion’. There is no indication that it was the Minister
personally who expressed the opinion. A comparison of the letter
summarizing the former with the second opinion suggests that the first
opinion was issued in the same manner, i.e. by senior members of the
Law Ministry and not by the Minister himself.

The Tribunals conclude that it is inaccurate for the Respondents
systematically to speak of the “opinion of the Law Minister’, “Mr Ahmed’s
opinion’®5§ or “Barrister Moudud Ahmed’s Legal Opinion as Minister’ .859
The evidence on record shows that it is the opinion of the Ministry.

The alleged conflict of interest

1308. With respect to the Respondents’ argument concerning the Law
Minister’s alleged conflict of interest, the following facts result from the
record:

(i)

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

In the year 2000, ie. during the time of the Awami League
Government, Niko had engaged Moudud Ahmed and Associates,
providing retainer. The retainer arrangement was terminated at the
end of 2000 and Mr Ahmed personally wrote to Mr Sharif of Niko on
10 December 2000 submitting a bill for the retainer (US$6,000 for
the time from June to December 2000) and another for additional
work, totalling US$8,250.869 With respect to a payment of US$6,000
made by Niko in 2000, which the Respondents questioned as
unexplained,8°! the Claimant produced the bill for the first six
months of the retainer in 2000.8°2

The two bills were paid in January 2002,° after a new bill for these
services had been sent by the Moudud Ahmed law firm on 9 January
2002.864

Following the meeting between Petrobangla, BAPEX and Niko on 7
July 2002, after Mr Ahmed had been appointed Law Minister, Niko
again engaged the law firm Moudud Ahmed and Associates which
delivered a legal opinion on the Chattak issue, dated 10 August
2002. Niko submitted this opinion to the State Minister with its
letter of the same date.8®5

The law firm Moudud Ahmed and Associates prepared a second
opinion, dated 27 February 2002, concerning both the Chattak and

the Swiss Challenge issues.86° The opinion was submitted to the
State Minister with Niko’s letter of 3 March 2003.87

(v) Both legal opinions of the law firm Moudud Ahmed and Associates
are signed by “Md. Azizul Hag, Advocate, Supreme Court’. On 3
March 2003, Md Haq confirmed receipt of payment for “legal opinion
in my personal capacity” .8°8

Discussing the first legal opinion of the Law Ministry, the Respondents
asserted

The Law Minister’s opinion essentially repeats the opinions that Niko
obtained from his private law firm and submitted to the Ministry of
Energy to support Niko’s position. At the very least, Moudud Ahmed
had a conflict of interest.8°

In support of their argument, the Respondents described the law of
Bangladesh with respect to conflicts of interest in the situation of the Law
Minister. They stated that the relevant provisions

... [PJrohibit Barrister Ahmed from exercising Ministerial functions in
a matter in which he had a prior pecuniary and professional interest,
but he was also duty-bound, as a legal practitioner, to refrain from
participating in any Government business involving Claimant.87°

Applied to the situation of the present case, the Respondents argued

Barrister Ahmed’s conduct was in complete disregard of these ethical
regulations and standards. First, he manifestly failed to disclose the
prior professional relationship between Niko and his law firm or the
fact that his law firm (and he personally) was bound to benefit from
any favorable advice issued by the Law Ministry. Second, as an
advocate, Barrister Ahmed failed to recuse himself from Government
business involving Claimant, and avoid “conflicting interests”.87!

The Claimant responded by pointing out, inter alia,
a) First, while the Law Minister at the time was indeed Moudud

Ahmed, he had obviously left private practice when taking office.
There is no evidence whatsoever that he had any input into the

opinions issued by the particular barrister at his former firm, which
had simply continued to use its established name.

b) Second, there is no evidence in the record that the opinion of the
Law Ministry was in fact proffered by Moudud Ahmed himself or that
he even had any involvement in it; while the identity of the lawyer(s)
within the Ministry responsible for the opinion is not known to Niko, it
is entirely possible, if not probable, that it was prepared by staff
counsel within the Ministry rather than the Law Minister.87?

The Respondents challenged the contention that Mr Ahmed “cut ties with
his associates practicing at the firm under his name, especially when they
were advising his former client and were paid, while he was Minister, a
significant outstanding sum due by Niko for his earlier work for Niko” 87
The Respondents also point to what they described as the “many oddities
surrounding the Legal Opinion”.874 The Claimant sought to rebut the
Respondents’ points.875

The Tribunals have examined this exchange and concluded that the
Respondents’ arguments and the alleged oddities, to the extent to which
they are supported by the evidence, do not justify the alleged conflict of
interest: The Tribunals see no basis for the Respondents’ assertion that
the Law Minister failed to disclose the link of his law firm to Niko.

Even if the Law Minister had not cut his ties with the law firm bearing
his name, the link of this firm with Niko was fully transparent, since Niko
submitted the two opinions it had obtained in the form showing the
letterhead of that law firm. The Ministry and the Respondents thus could
clearly see that Niko had obtained two legal opinions from the firm.
BAPEX nevertheless suggested that the controversy concerning Chattak
East be submitted to the Law Ministry.

The Respondents’ statement that “Barrister Ahmed failed to recuse
himself from Government business involving Claimant, and avoid
‘conflicting interests”, is an assertion without any evidentiary basis. The
Respondents have not provided any evidence nor even explanations
about the circumstances in which the Law Ministry’s opinions were
produced. There is therefore strictly no basis for the assertion that the

875 C-RC, paragraphs 58-76.

1317.

1319.

Law Minister failed to “recuse himself’. The Respondents seek to cover
this lacking evidence by consistently speaking of opinions by the “Law
Minister’ where the evidence only shows references to the opinions of the
Law Ministry.

The Tribunals see no basis for assuming that the opinions presented
by the Law Ministry were affected by irregularity with respect to
professional ethics obligation or rules of transparency applying to Mr
Ahmed’s function as Minister or by a conflict of interest on the side of
the Law Minister.

9.7.4 The reasoning of the Law Ministry’s opinions and their similarity
with those obtained by Niko

The Respondents also criticise the content of the Law Ministry’s
opinions. They characterise these opinions as “facially irrational’ ,87©
“grounded on fundamentally unsound reasoning’®’? “unreasonable”’78
and “with threadbare, unreasonable analysis’.879 In addition, the
Respondents state:

In addition to its dubious provenance, the reasoning of the Law
Minister’s opinion raises serious doubts as to its legitimacy as an
objective legal opinion by an independent Law Minister. Like Niko, the
Law Minister’s opinion relied on Article 5.05 of the FoU to reject the
Swiss Challenge process. This contradicts the very decision of the
former Prime Minister it purported to interpret, which accepts Niko’s
proposal including the Swiss Challenge process.®®°

As mentioned above, the Respondents’ criticism also stresses that the
Law Ministry’s opinions repeat those which Niko had submitted. With
respect to the March 2003 opinion concerning Chattak East, the
Respondents say that it “essentially repeats the opinions that Niko
obtained from [the Law Minister’s] private law firm and submitted to the
Ministry of Energy to support Niko’s position” 88!

880 R-MC, paragraph 94.

881 R-MC, paragraph 91.

382

1320. The consistency of the opinions that Niko had obtained from the Moudud
Ahmed law firm with the opinion by the Law Ministry is taken by the
Respondents as a major argument against the Law Ministry’s opinion:

... the fact that the Law Ministry’s opinion was consistent with the
position taken by the Minister’s law firm completely blurred the line
between public and private interests, thereby violating the
Constitution, the applicable laws of Bangladesh, and the Professional
Conduct Canons applicable to Barrister Ahmed personally.882

1321. Finally, the Respondents criticise the Law Ministry’s opinions for having
“adopted Niko’s positions contrary to the views of BAPEX and Petrobangla
(and the Ministry of Energy before bribes were paid)” 883

1322. The Claimant rejects the proposition that the consistency between the
opinions should give rise to any suspicion:

Such a proposition is patently meritless, particularly in circumstances
where Niko’s position was plainly meritorious, and where Niko had
clearly and convincingly argued its position in multiple written
communications. In contrast to Niko’s robust approach, BAPEX (and
Petrobangla) had utterly failed to provide any substantive basis in
support of its position.®54

1323. The Tribunals see no merit in the Respondents’ criticism based on the
similarity between the Law Ministry’s opinions and those that the
Claimant had presented. As long as the Ministry’s opinions defend
reasonable positions there should be no grounds for concern or criticism.

1324. It was at the suggestion of BAPEX that the issue of Chattak East was
submitted to the Law Ministry. The opinion of that Ministry should be
controlling when the regularity of the adoption of the JVA is considered.
Whether the view adopted by the Law Ministry differs from that which
the Respondents or the Claimant defend in the Arbitrations or took at the
time, as a matter of principle, is not decisive for the regularity of the
process. It is only if the opinions of the Law Ministry turned out to be
“facially irrational’, as the Respondents argue, that there would be
grounds for concern.

In their examination of the opinions of the Law Ministry, the Tribunals
could not rely on the opinions themselves, since the opinions have not
been produced, as the Respondents assert that they cannot find them.
When forming a view on the reasonableness of the Law Ministry’s
opinions, the Tribunals must therefore have regard to the evidence about
these opinions made available: the summary of the first opinion provided
in the Ministry’s letter of 1 April 2003885 and the extract of the second
opinion attached to the Ministry’s letter of 11 October 2003.88©

9.7.4.1 The First Opinion

With respect to the first opinion, dealing with the Chattak East issue,
the Ministry’s letter of 1 April 2003 refers to the Marginal Fields
Procedure and the manner in which, in that procedure,
Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields are identified. It contrasts this
procedure with the Annex A of the FOU:

But to determine whether Chattak (East) is included in the Chattak
Gas Field or not, attention to be drawn to the Exhibit A of the
Framework of Understanding. The co-ordinates, area and depth of
Kamta, Feni and Chattak gas fields have been specifically mentioned
in the Exhibit A. FOU (Frame Work of understanding) was completed
between Niko Resources (Bangladesh) and Bangladesh Petroleum
Exploration Company Ltd. (BAPEX). As there is specific description of
Chattak Gas Field in Exhibit A, therefore the explained area will be
considered as Chattak Gas Field.887

On this basis, the Ministry sets out the coordinates of the Chattak Gas
Field as in Annex A to the FOU.

In their examination of the Chattak East issue, the Tribunals have
considered the reference to Annex A as a relevant and valid criterion for
determining the contract area. There are indeed good reasons to accept
that the FOU, as the first agreement concluded with respect to the Niko
project, sets out the area to which the envisaged cooperation between
BAPEX and Niko would apply. The Tribunals have presented above their

analysis of this question; they see no grounds to view the Law Ministry’s
opinion, as reported in the Ministry’s letter, as irrational or otherwise
indefensible.

9.7.4.2 The Second Opinion

The second opinion of the Law Ministry, as far as can be seen from the
attachment to the Ministry’s letter of 11 October 2003, deals with two
issues:

(a) Vetting the JVA; and

(b) Provide a legal opinion whether, in light of the FOU, Swiss
Challenge Method or any tendering method has to be followed to
develop the proposed four Marginal Gas Fields and to produce gas
from them.

The opinion starts by presenting the principal steps leading to the JVA,
viz. Niko’s proposal of 28 June 1998, the Government’s decision of 25
May 1999, the Framework of Understanding of 23 August 1998 and the
Marginal Field Procedure of 14 June 2001. It explains that “based on”
this procedure, a JVA was prepared, the Prime Minister directed its
finalisation on 18 March 2003, and the Board of Petrobangla approved it
on 22 July 2003. Thereupon the “Ministry of Administration [sic] has
requested to vet the draft JVA”.

With respect to the issue of vetting the JVA, the opinion states that the
draft JVA was examined and corrections were “penciled” in the draft.
“Upon making those amendments, there is no legal bar to finalize the
JVA” 888

Concerning the Swiss Challenge method, the opinion sets out the
background to the issue:

Decision (c) of the government’s Memorandum dated May 25, 1999
has a reference to adopting the Swiss Challenge Method for the
proposed four Marginal Gas Fields. On the other hand, Article 5.05 of
the government-approved FOU says that, BAPEX cannot negotiate

888 Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 11 October 2003, Exhibit
R-280, paragraph 376/20.

385

with any third party in order to develop the proposed Marginal Gas
Fields and to produce gas from them. Since the government’s decision
(c) dated May 25, 1999 and the government-approved FOU dated
August 23, 1999 are contradictory, the Ministry of Administration
hence seeks the opinion of this Ministry that, for the proposed
Marginal Gas Fields, whether, in light of the FOU, it is required to
follow Swiss Challenge Method or any tendering method.®®°

1333. After referring to the 25 May 1999 decision and Article 5.05 of the FOU,

the conclusion is presented as follows:

Swiss Challenge method cannot be followed in the proposed Marginal
Gas Fields, because reviewing the decision (c) dated May 25, 1999
reveals that following Swiss Challenge Method or any other tender
method was not mandatory, that was optional. In that decision, the
mention of the phrase “if necessary" would indicate that. As per
Article 5.05 of the government-approved FOU dated August 23, 1999,
tender or discussion with any third party was barred, meaning that
by that Article the Government has legally discarded the (c) decision
taken on May 25, 1999. Therefore, if the Government enters into any
discussion or agreement with a third-party following Swiss Challenge
method or any such method, the Government will be held liable for
breaching the agreement, henceforth, will have to pay huge
compensation, which is unacceptable.

1334. The Claimant concludes that the State Minister was “entirely justified” in

1335.

seeking an opinion from the Law Ministry and that “the Law Ministry had
clear and substantial ground to conclude that the JVA could, and even
should, be executed without a Swiss Challenge process being followed.”
The Claimant concludes:

There is absolutely nothing that invites an inference of corruption in
either case. On the contrary, the circumstances suggest only the
exercise of good judgment by both the State Minister and the Ministry
of Law.89°

The Respondents object to the reasoning of the Law Ministry’s opinion,
and in particular to the reliance on Article 5.05 FOU.

In addition to its dubious provenance, the reasoning of the Law
Minister’s opinion raises serious doubts as to its legitimacy as an
objective legal opinion by an independent Law Minister. Like Niko, the

889 Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 11 October 2003, Exhibit
R-280, paragraph 374/18.
890 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 148.

386

Law Minister’s opinion relied on Article 5.05 of the FoU to reject the
Swiss Challenge process. This contradicts the very decision of the
former Prime Minister it purported to interpret, which accepts Niko’s
proposal including the Swiss Challenge process.®?!

1336. The criticism is unjustified: the opinion interprets the decision of 25 May
1999. Relying on the qualification “if necessary’, the opinion concludes
that according to the decision Swiss Challenge is not mandatory but
optional. The Tribunals consider this interpretation reasonable.

1337. Elsewhere in their submissions, the Respondents assert that the “sole
provision the Law Minister cited on Swiss Challenge was apparently
Article 5.5 of the FoU”.892 The above quotation shows that this is not
correct; as just seen, the opinion also considered the decision of 25 May
1999.

1338. By Article 5.05 of the FOU BAPEX granted exclusivity to Niko “during the
negotiation period’. The Respondents argue that the exclusivity applied
only during the negotiations but not thereafter and that the invitation of
other offers according to the Swiss Challenge procedure was fully
consistent with this Article.8°° The Claimant relies on Article 9.01 of the
FOU, which provides that “on successful completion of the Technical
Program & on the basis of the acceptability of the result thereof the parties
would execute a Joint Venture Agreement’. It concludes: “/cjlearly, the
‘negotiation period’ contemplated by the FOU would end upon the
execution of the JVA”.8%

1339. The Tribunals note that the FOU provides for a “negotiation period” and
for the execution of the JVA. It does not call for a phase following the
negotiations and prior to the conclusion of the JVA, as would be required
if the Swiss Challenge method were applicable. As discussed above,
Article 7.01 of the FOU, the only reference to the Swiss Challenge method
in the FOU, does not prescribe that method; it simply indicates what shall
happen with the confidentiality obligation in case that method were
applied. The Tribunals conclude that it is reasonable to assume that the
“negotiation period”, as understood in Article 5.05, makes no allowance
for Swiss Challenge. Once agreement on the terms of the JVA were

reached, as this was the case in August 2003, Article 5.05 of FOU would
apply and it would not be admissible for BAPEX to “encourage, entertain,
solicit or engage in negotiations or discussion with any party other then
Niko with respect to this project” or to conclude a conflicting agreement.895

With respect to the second opinion, too, the Tribunals therefore see no
grounds to view the Law Ministry’s opinion, as reported in the Ministry’s
letter, as irrational or otherwise indefensible.

As to the Respondents’ criticism that the Law Ministry’s opinions
resemble the arguments developed in the opinions that Niko had
presented but did not discuss specifically the views of the Respondents,
the Tribunals note that the Respondents have not provided any
information about the materials that were provided to the Law Ministry
when it was requested to provide its opinions.

The suggestion of BAPEX to consult the Law Minister was made in its
letter of 5 March 2003,89© which made express reference to the legal
opinion which Niko had presented at the meeting of 2 March 2003. One
may assume that this opinion was communicated to the Law Ministry
when the opinion on the Chattak issue was requested. It is therefore not
surprising that the arguments in that opinion were considered and
reflected in the Law Ministry’s opinion on that subject.

In the absence of the actual text of the second opinion and surrounding
material, it cannot be said whether the Law Ministry took into account
other arguments, including those of BAPEX and Petrobangla. The
Respondents’ failure or inability to disclose documents or information on
this issue in the Arbitrations is disappointing given that such materials
should have existed in official files; in the end their allegations concerning
the arguments considered by the Law Ministry are simply unsupported
by the evidence on record.

9.8 Government Approval for the JVA

1344.

The Respondents allege that (i) the final terms of the JVA and specifically
the inclusion of Chattak East and the omission of Swiss Challenge were

the result of interventions from the State Minister and the Prime Minister
and (ii) the “proper procedures” were not followed for the approval of the
JVA897 by the Government was not properly followed; they rely on
“repeated instances of mala fides and impropriety in the decision-making
process” .898 The Respondents rely on irregularities in the governmental
decision-making process as a basis for seeking application of the
Supreme Court’s jurisprudence developed under Article 102 of the
Constitution.899

The Claimant denies these allegations. It asserts that there is no evidence
to suggest that there was any deviation form the appropriate internal
approval procedure; it finds corroboration in the fact that the usual
approval process was followed and in the absence of any
“contemporaneous query or complaint [...] that the usual governmental
approval procedure had been jettisoned in relation to the JVA”.9°°

9.8.1 The requirements of the approval process

It is undisputed that “Government approval’ was required for the
execution of the JVA. This requirement was expressed in the Marginal
Fields Procedure and was consistently confirmed in internal documents
of BAPEX and Petrobangla. The MFE states that “a joint venture contract
may be executed between BAPEX and Niko as stipulated in the study upon
approval of Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy and Mineral
Resources” .9°!

The Respondents assert that “normal procedures for approving the JVA
were not followed”. They have, however, provided little information about
the process that had to be followed with respect to this approval.

Prior to the Hearing, the Respondents argued that, during the BNP reign,
the approval process was “perverted”. Relying on the testimony of Mr
Khan and Ms LaPrevotte, the Respondents described the “extent of the

perversion of the Government’s approval process”, referring to the
“widespread corruption in the granting of licenses and public contracts” .9°2
They insisted that “the Government approval for the JVA and GPSA was
tainted by improper, and indeed illegal acts of the Government officials
approving them’;°° but they did not describe in any detail the approval
process that had to be followed.

1349. At the Hearing, Mr Chowdhury, in response to questions from the

Tribunals, explained what he understood the normal procedure to have
been during his time at the Ministry.9°* From his testimony, the
Tribunals understand that the approval is given on the basis of a proposal
which must originate from Petrobangla: “proposal is initiated by
Petrobangla and goes to the [State] Minister through the secretary.”9°> Mr
Chowdhury clarified: “/wJithout a proposal submitted to the Minister by the
secretary there was no scope for the [State] Minister to approve it.”9°°

1350. According to the procedure described by Mr Chowdhury, the Minister

then submits the proposal to a “Cabinet committee on financial matters
[which] is set up by the Prime Minister’ and makes a recommendation to
the Prime Minister.9°7 “This Cabinet committee is normally called the
purchase committee.”9°8 The convener of the committee is the Finance
Minister; other ministers are those for Industry, Commerce and some
others depending on the subject matter.9°° The proposal then is
submitted to the Prime Minister with the recommendation of the
Committee, even if the recommendation is negative.9!°

1351. Mr Chowdhury explained that his brief experience at the Ministry, from

February to September 2002, consisted of two or three contracts for the
procurement of petroleum which he submitted to the Cabinet
Committee.9!! Concerning the Niko project, he assumed, since “they have

got this deal approved they have got the approval of the Prime Minister”
and it passed the Committee;?!2 but he does not know since he “was not
involved then.”913

1352. The steps described by Mr Chowdhury, thus are as follows:

e A proposal by Petrobangla to the Ministry;

e Transmission of the proposal by the Ministry to the Cabinet (or
Procurement) Committee convened by the Ministry of Finance;

e Recommendation by the Ministry; and

e Approval by the Prime Minister.

1353. No other evidence has been provided about the approval process. Mr
Chowdhury explained that this was the process normally followed during
his presence at the Ministry. He did not state that this process was
prescribed by any rule; and he could not testify to the process followed
after his departure.

1354. The Respondents refer to the description by Mr Chowdhury as the
“normal procedures in Bangladesh”; but they provide no further support
to show that the procedure was required generally in Bangladesh for
Government approval and was applied in the approvals of contracts other
than the procurement contracts which Mr Chowdhury witnessed.

1355. The Tribunals conclude from Mr Chowdhury’s testimony and the
Respondents’ endorsement of his description of the “normal process” that
the Government approval process was not generally “perverted”
during the BNP reign; a normal process for Government approval did
function. In order to prevail with their corruption allegation, the
Respondents would have to establish that the approval process was
“perverted” in the particular case of Niko, and that the approval of the
JVA was procured by corruption.

1356. The Tribunals thus need to examine the steps that led to the Government
approval and determine whether, in the specific case of the JVA, the

1359.

1360.

Government approval process was vitiated in any manner and, in Section
10 below, whether the approval was procured by corruption.

9.8.2 The steps actually taken in relation to the Government approval

When asserting that proper procedures were not followed for the approval
of the JVA, the Respondents relied on Mr Chowdhury’s description of the
“normal procedures” to assert that these procedures were not followed.
When discussing the procedures followed for obtaining Government
approval, the Respondents stress their allegations of corruption. These
will be considered in other parts of this Decision. The issue considered
here concern the approval process itself and the alleged irregularities in
it.

The Tribunals have examined the steps leading to the Government
approval of the JVA, in order to determine whether the alleged
irregularities have been established.

During the time between the submission of Niko’s first proposal in 1997
or 1998 and the final execution of the JVA, Government authorities
intervened at various occasions. Starting with the Government’s decision
in 1999 to enter into negotiations with Niko, the Government continued
to be involved in the process that led to the finalisation of the JVA. This
involvement and the acts of Government approval that occurred through
it have been discussed above. The steps that must be considered now are
those surrounding the finalisation of the JVA.

Following the correspondence with Niko and internal meetings of BAPEX
and Petrobangla in the second half of 2002 and following instructions
from the meeting of 16 September 2002, BAPEX and Niko met on 23
November 2002. BAPEX reported on the meeting:

It was apparent from the discussions, and agreed between BAPEX
and NIKO, that there was apprehension of complexities arising with
regards to the Well Head Price, T&D Margin, Corporate Tax, PDF
Margin and Exploration Margin. To avoid these complexities Niko

392

offered a new proposal by their letter dated 25/11/2002 with a view
to finalize the JV which is mentioned below. 9!4

1361. In that follow-up letter of 25 November 2002, Niko addressed a number
of questions remaining open. With respect to Chattak East, Niko
confirmed its position but added that it “will accept the final GOB
decision in this regard.”915

1362. Thereafter, BAPEX prepared a draft JVA, “seconded by Niko”. This draft
was submitted to the BAPEX Board which decided on 30 December 2002
to form a committee “to minutely check out whether the terms and
conditions contained in the JVA presented before the Board are consistent
with the decisions taken in the joint meetings of BAPEX, Petrobangla and
the Ministry.”°'© Various tasks for the committee were identified,
including these:

a) The committee will send letters through Petrobangla for
reconsidering the decision from the Ministry on the points where
the presented JVA contradicts the Government decisions already
issued.

b) The committee will send appropriate recommendations to the
Ministry through Petrobangla for receiving proper decisions on the
specified matters where there is no decision from the Ministry.

CG

eg

The committee will send the draft JVA to the Ministry through
Petrobangla on amendment of the same after receiving decisions
from the Ministry regarding the matters contained in “a” and
“p,?917

1363. This committee presented its report on 13 January 2003. It made a
number of recommendations and concluded:

. the committee did not find any Article that goes against the
interests of BAPEX/Petrobangla/the Government. In __ this

circumstance, the draft JVA can be rearranged as per the
recommendations of the committee. 918

The report was considered and approved by the BAPEX Board on 10
January 2003 with a number of decisions or issues for determination by
Petrobangla or the Ministry, including the contract area, the marketing
of the JV gas and the wellhead price, the investment multiple, tax issues
and Swiss Challenge.9!9

In its letter of 30 January 2003, BAPEX requested Petrobangla to take
“proper steps for the consideration by and approval of the Ministry
regarding decisions” of the BAPEX Board of 10 January 2003.92°

Following a decision of the BAPEX Board of 20 February 2003,
Petrobangla sent to the Ministry a draft JVA, which did not include
Chattak East.9?!

On 2 March 2003 a joint meeting of the Ministry, Petrobangla, BAPEX
and Niko was held at which Niko insisted on the inclusion of Chattak
East.922 In the follow-up letter of 3 March 2003 to the State Minister, Niko
confirmed and developed its position in this respect.92

In his letter of 5 March 2003 to Petrobangla, Mr Elahi, the Managing
Director of BAPEX, recognised the “conflicting views” and, as discussed
above, suggested that the matter be submitted to the Law Ministry which
resolve the issue.92+

On 18 March 2003 a summary of the project was prepared and submitted
for approval by the Prime Minister. The summary, presumably prepared
by the Ministry, has not been produced; nor has the approval by the
Prime Minister. The summary is mentioned in the Ministry’s letter of 11
October 2003925 and the approval is reported in the Ministry’s letter of 1
April 2003.

1370. On that basis, the Ministry invited Petrobangla to finalise the JVA,
“following all the terms and conditions and Rules and Regulations as
approved by the Hon’ble Ex-Prime Minister on 14.06.2001” in the Marginal
Fields Procedure.

1371. Following this communication by the Ministry, a “BAPEX-Niko JVA
Committee” was set up.96 Mr Elahi, Managing Director of BAPEX, was its
Convener. The committee examined and elaborated changes to be made
to the JVA in light of the inclusion of Chattak East.

1372. Mr Elahi reported to Petrobangla in a letter of 24 April 2003 explaining
inter alia:

The committee prepared a Comparative Economic Analysis of each of
the gas fields i.e. Chattak (West), Chattak (East) and Feni under the
JVA with the PSC Moulvibazar Gas Field i.e. Block-12 operated by
the IOC which is enclosed herewith (Enclosure 4). On the basis of the
analysis, the committee prepared the proposal of investment multiple
of Chattak (West), Chattak (East) and Feni Gas Fields; in other words,
they proposed the allocation of shares between BAPEX and Niko in
many options.

Therefore, we request your review of the Comparative Economic
Analysis and approval to send the letter to Niko.9?”

1373. The committee submitted its report to Petrobangla on 3 June 2003 and
anew committee was formed by Petrobangla to evaluate it. This work led
to further changes in the JVA draft which was then submitted to the
BAPEX Board. The draft approved by the BAPEX Board was sent to the
Ministry by Petrobangla on 3 July 2003.928

1374. The Ministry then gave instructions on 21 July 2003:

(a) To get immediate legal vetting on the JVA accepted by BAPEX
board and adopted by BAPEX and Niko Resources(BD) Ltd.. This is to
be done by Petrobangla panel of Lawyers.

(b) To get approval on the JVA by Petrobangla Governing/ Managing
Committee.°?9

1375. The “legal vetting’ was performed by Barrister Azhrul Hoque from “Legal
Remedy” and was submitted to the Petrobangla Management
Committee. 99°

1376. The Ministry also sought further clarification from Petrobangla, including
the question whether the Investment Multiple was “beneficial to BAPEX
and Bangladesh” and whether “there are any other sectors where such
initiative has been implemented”. The Minutes of the 22 July 2003
Petrobangla Management Board meeting record the reply:

There will be no benefit unless the Abandoned/ Marginal Gas Fields
are developed for production.

No JVA was signed till date in Bangladesh Gas sector.93!

1377. The Minutes deal in particular with the determination of the gas price,
point out the difference with price determination under the PSC and
address certain tax and related issues as well as the registration of Niko
in Barbados.

1378. The Minutes then provide replies to certain questions:
Justification of the Proposal discussed:

Feni Gas fields under the said agreement it could meet the growing
demand for gas.

The Minutes also record that it was pointed out again that

. no fund is required by BAPEX to run the said Joint Venture. Niko
will bear all the investment needed. Earning from the produced gas
will be distributed through Investment Multiple basis ...993

The Petrobangla Management Committee considered further issues,
including comparisons with the terms of PSCs, noting that “there will be
no cost recovery in the said JVA as for the case of PSC’. The discussion
concluded as follows:

25. The board referred the draft JVA to the Ministry for Government
approval.

26. The board recommended the approval of Joint initiative between
BAPEX and Niko for the development and exploration of Gas from
Chattak and Feni Non-Producing Marginal/Abandoned gas fields.
The board also advised the director (PSC) to send the matter to the

Petrobangla sent a letter to the Ministry on 24 July 2003, “directing the
next steps required”. This letter has not been produced, even though it
formed Attachment 6 to the Ministry’s Summary for the Prime Minister,
produced as Exhibit R-281.

In August 2003, the Law Ministry delivered the second opinion, dealing
with Swiss Challenge, as discussed above.

1383. In addition to the opinions from the Law Ministry, the “Finance Division”
(presumably the Ministry of Finance) and the National Revenue Board
also prepared opinions on the JVA. These opinions, forming Attachments
7 and 9 to the Ministry’s Summary (Exhibit R-280), have not been
produced. The August opinion of the Law Ministry is attached to the
Summary as Attachment 8, but not produced with this document.

1384. The Summary to the Prime Minister concluded:

07. In this circumstance, the BAPEX-Niko ratified JVA needs to be
presented before the Honorable Prime Minister for her final signature
after making necessary amendments to the ratified JVA as per the
opinion/recommendations given by the Ministry of Finance, and
Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs.

08. The proposal of the aforementioned paragraph 7 has been
presented before the Honorable Prime Minister for her kind
consideration and approval.935

1385. The Prime Minister’s approval has not been produced. Petrobangla was
informed of the approval by the Ministry on 11 October 2003 in the
following terms, under the reference to the Ministry’s notification of 1
April 2003 and Petrobangla’s letter of 3 July 2003:

Following the Honorable Prime Minister’s kind approval to the
summary presented to her on 03-18-2003, it is requested to arrange

final signature of the mentioned JVA.

2. The direction approved by Honorable Prime Minister is as
follows:

a) In light of the opinion by the Ministry of Law, Justice, and
Parliamentary Affairs, Chatak Gas Field will be considered as per
Exhibit-A of the Frame Work of Understanding.

and
b) Petrobangla shall be directed to finalise the draft Joint Venture
Agreement in accordance with all terms and relevant conditions

stated in the Procedure for Development of Marginal/ Abandoned Gas
Fields approved by former Honorable Prime Minister on 06-14-2001;

the draft JVA between BAPEX and Niko Resources was presented
before the Honorable Prime Minister and she signed it on 06-14-2001.

3. The opinion of the Ministry of Law, Justice, and Parliamentary
Affairs on the mentioned subject has been sent for taking necessary
steps.936

1386. The Ministry’s letter of instruction was copied to BAPEX which informed
Niko on 13 October 2003 as follows:

In accordance with the approval accorded by the Government of the
Peoples Republic of Bangladesh to sign the [JVA] you are requested
to send your Authorized representative with due authorization to sign
the said contract on 16 October, 2003 at 12.00 Noon to the
Registered office of BAPEX, Dhaka, Bangladesh.°37

1387. JVA was then signed on 16 October 2003, as recorded on the agreement
itself.

9.8.3 The Tribunals’ assessment of the regularity of the JVA’s approval

 

 

1388. It is uncontested that the approvals were indeed given. The Respondents
state that “the evidence shows that the State Minister personally and
informally obtained the Prime Minister’s approval.” The Parties disagree,
however, as to whether the approval occurred in a proper manner.

1389. The Respondents argue that the “proper procedures” were not followed for
the approval of the JVA; they assert that “Niko’s corrupt deals with Mr
Mamoon and Nationwide meant that normal procedures for approving the
JVA were not followed’.°%8 They rely on the description which Mr
Chowdhury had given at the Hearing about the procedure that was
normally followed for Government approval.989

936 Letter from Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources to Petrobangla, 11 October 2003, Exhibit
R-280 (emphasis in the original). The last paragraph reads in the translation of Exhibit JD SI-33: “On the
above-mentioned subject matter the opinion (Photocopy) of the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary
Affairs provided on 25-08-2003 AD has been sent for taking required steps.”

The Claimant concludes from this testimony:

... Mr. Chowdhury revealed in his testimony, the decision to approve
the JVA was ultimately made by the Prime Minister, and only after a
Cabinet Committee had convened and authorized the matter for
presentation to her. Fundamentally, the evidence indicates that the
decision to approve the JVA was therefore not in the State Minister’s
control in any event ...940

The Respondents object that there “is no record of any such Cabinet
Committee meeting, because it never happened”;?*! and they point out
that Mr Chowdhury had left his position at the Ministry more than a year
before the JVA was concluded, and thus could not say whether this
procedure was followed in the case of the JVA.942 Indeed, Mr Chowdhury
explained that he did not know whether the procedure was followed in
the case of the JVA, adding “because I was not involved then” .943

The Claimant also contests the Respondents’ assertion that the
appropriate internal approval procedure was not followed and states:
“there is no evidence to suggest there was in fact a deviation in the case of
the JVA”.944

The Tribunals have considered first that, according to Mr Chowdhury’s
testimony, there must first be a proposal from Petrobangla to the
Ministry; without such a proposal, “there was no scope for the Minister
to approve it’ .945

The Respondents assert that no such proposal existed; they go further
and identify as one of the deviations in the actual approval process that
Niko obtained the approval “outside the normal procedures and avoided
the normal chain of needing approval from the public servants between it
and the Minister”.°46

While Mr Chowdhury was at the Ministry, no proposal for approval from
Petrobangla had reached the Ministry; he assumed that, after his
departure, the Secretary at the Ministry received a proposal from
Petrobangla.947

At the Hearing, counsel for the Respondents explained that they had not
seen such a proposal. The Respondents informed the Tribunals
subsequently that they “investigated and, to [counsel’s] knowledge, such
a proposal does not exist’.948

The account given above about the events following Mr Chowdhury’s
departure from the Ministry and the evidence on which it relied show,
however, that BAPEX and Petrobangla played the leading role in the
negotiations with Niko and that there were several proposals to the
Ministry. There was indeed an exchange between BAPEX, through
Petrobangla, and the Ministry about the terms of the JVA, as they evolved
over time. The record shows that there were proposals submitted to the
Ministry following the BAPEX Board decision of 20 February 2003 anda
“Petrobangla Memorandum’ dated 5 March 2003.99 Following the receipt
of the opinion of the Law Ministry, the Energy Ministry directed that a
JVA be prepared and a committee was formed by Petrobangla and
BAPEX. After revisions of the draft JVA by the “BAPEX-Niko JVA
Committee” and the Petrobangla evaluation committee, a new draft was
submitted to the Ministry on 3 July 2003. The Ministry commented and
requested further clarifications which were addressed at a meeting of the
Petrobangla Management Board on 22 July 2003, following which a new
draft JVA was sent to the Ministry “for Government approval’.

The Tribunals conclude that there were several proposals submitted to
the Ministry. These proposals reflected the positions adopted by BAPEX
and Petrobangla and their views as they were developed in committees of
BAPEX and Petrobangla, before and after the Law Ministry’s opinion on
the Chattak issue. The JVA draft developed after this opinion in this
process adapted the terms and conditions to reflect the inclusion of
Chattak East and provided a revenue sharing ratio more favourable for
BAPEX in relation to Chattak East. In the course of this process, BAPEX

also conducted a “Comparative Economic Analysis”, comparing the
financial conditions of the JVA with those of a gas field operated by an
“JOC” (International Oil Company). On the basis of this analysis, the
BAPEX committee prepared the Investment Multiple for the Niko JVA.

1399. The Ministry requested additional “legal vetting’ by the “Petrobangla
panel of Lawyers” and requested that the revised draft JVA prepared in
the BAPEX-Niko negotiations be approved by the Petrobangla Board. It
also sought clarification that this draft was “beneficial to BAPEX and
Bangladesh”.

1400. The evidence of these proposals and exchanges shows that this phase of
the approval process, contrary to the Respondents assertion, was not
“driven from above”;9°° rather it was conducted in a cooperative and
responsible manner, in which BAPEX and Petrobangla as well as the
Ministry sought to ensure the most advantageous conditions for BAPEX
and Bangladesh. The Tribunals have found no sign of impropriety in the
process.

1401. In a second phase of the process described by Mr Chowdhury the
proposal would be submitted to the Cabinet/Procurement Committee.
As the Respondents point out, there is no evidence of a submission to
such a committee. The Claimant asserts that “the usual approval process
was followed” and finds support in the Summary to Prime Minister which
reports on the prior consultation not only with the Law Ministry but also
with “the Finance Division and the National Revenue Board’.

1402. The Tribunals note that other governmental bodies were consulted on the
proposal, specifically the Ministry of Finance, the National Revenue
Board and the Law Ministry. The “necessary amendments” were made in
the draft JVA before it was submitted to the Prime Minister.95? Apart from
Mr Chowdhury’s explanations about what occurred during his very
limited practice during a short period at the Ministry, concerning “two or
three contracts for petroleum procurement’ ,9°* no evidence was provided
about the choice of the governmental authorities that were consulted on

proposals; nor is there any evidence on procedural requirements with
respect to such consultations.

1403. In the present case, the terms and conditions of the JVA were elaborated
over a long period of time in cooperation of BAPEX, Petrobangla and the
competent Ministry; the issues that required further vetting were legal
and financial. The Law Ministry, as well as the Ministry of Finance and
the National Revenue Board, appear as inherently appropriate entities for
prior consultation in the approval process.

1404. In the absence of any evidence that other consultations were required
under the law and that other mandatory practices were applicable to
governmental approvals, the Tribunals see no irregularity in the choice
of the entities that were consulted by the Ministry prior to the submission
of the JVA for approval to the Prime Minister and the method in which
this was done.

1405. The third phase in the procedure described by Mr Chowdhury consisted
in a recommendation by the Ministry. Mr Chowdhury had explained
that the approval had to be given by the Prime Minister “on the
recommendation of the Ministry”.°5+ Following Mr Chowdhury’s oral
testimony about the procedure the following exchange took place:

THE PRESIDENT: So the Niko contract you are saying was not
approved by the Minister of Energy but by the Prime Minister?

MR CHOWDHURY: Yes, on the recommendation of the Ministry, the
Prime Minister approves it.

THE PRESIDENT: So the recommendation for the Niko contract was
given by the Minister to the Prime Minister?

MR CHOWDHURY: Yes, it is the process.9°>

1406. Mr Chowdhury clarified that this was “the process” but, since he had left
the Ministry by the time of the approval, he could not know whether this
process was actually followed in the case of the JVA.

955 Tr. Day 3 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 141, Il. 7-16.

403

1407. The evidence on record shows that there must have been two
recommendations by the Minister:

¢ The first of these recommendations is dated 18 March 2003. It is
the one to which the Respondents seem to refer as “summary”
when they write: the “Prime Minister approved a summary in
March 2003, before a final draft had even been prepared and
before Swiss Challenge was discarded”.?°° It is mentioned in the
11 October 2003 letter of the Ministries and identified by the date
of 18 March 2003. It has not been produced in the Arbitrations;

e The second recommendation is dated 7 September 2003 and has
been produced as Exhibit R-281.

1408. Concerning the first of these documents, the letter of 11 October 2003
speaks of a “summary” presented to the Prime Minister on 18 March
2003. Judging from the second text, also entitled “summary”, one may
presume that it was indeed a recommendation on the basis of which the
Prime Minister could express her approval.

1409. The content of this first recommendation is not known. Since it was dated
some two weeks after BAPEX had suggested that the Chattak issue be
submitted to the Law Ministry for an opinion, one may presume that the
recommendation made reference to the request for such an opinion; one
might also expect that the Minister would not recommend approval of the
JVA before he had received this opinion. Indeed, in the letter of 1 April
2003, which announces the approval by the Prime Minister, this
announcement is made after the content of the Law Ministry’s opinion is
described and introduced by the words “in accordance with the above
circumstances”. It would seem therefore likely that the recommendation
of 18 March 2003 contained information about the resolution of the
Chattak issue as per the Law Ministry’s opinion.

1410. The Respondents assert that the summary approved by the Prime
Minister in March 2003 was issued “before Swiss Challenge was
discussed’. Since the issue that was referred to the Law Ministry at that
time apparently concerned only the Chattak issue, this assertion by the
Respondents seems reasonable.

1416.

The Tribunals have examined whether the absence of a discussion of the
Swiss Challenge issue must be seen as an irregularity in the Minister’s
first recommendation. The Tribunals have explained in Section 9.6 that
it appears from the evidence produced that in 2002 it was uncertain
whether, following the MOU and the Marginal Fields Procedure, Swiss
Challenge was required; they noted that this uncertainty had not been
resolved by 2003 and that the application of the process was not actively
pursued. The absence of discussion of the Swiss Challenge method thus
does not seem surprising and cannot be taken as an irregularity.

The second recommendation, dated 7 September 2003, has not given rise
to any criticism in these Arbitrations. The Tribunals see no irregularity
in it.

The final phase in the process described by Mr Chowdhury is the
approval by the Prime Minister. According to Mr Chowdhury, this is
the decisive step: “on the recommendation of the Ministry, the Prime
Minister approves it.”957

The Respondents state that “the evidence shows that the State Minister
personally and informally obtained the Prime Minister’s approval’.95® The
evidence on which they rely is the sentence in the 11 October 2003 letter
of the Ministry to Petrobangla: “Following the Honorable Prime Minister’s
kind approval to the summary presented to her on 03-18-2003, it is
requested to arrange final signature of the mentioned JVA”.

The quoted passage does not provide any indication about the manner in
which the approval was obtained. In any event, there has been no
indication of a regulation that requires a specific form in which the Prime
Minister’s approval is obtained, nor is there any evidence that the, in the
present case, any requirements of form were violated.

Since the approval by the Prime Minister is uncontested and the
allegations concerning the form in which this has been done have not
been shown to violate any prescribed form, the Tribunals cannot see any
irregularity in the Prime Minister’s approval.

957 Tr. Day 3 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 141, ll. 20-12.

October 2003 (Exhibit R-280)..

405

1417. The Tribunals conclude that the JVA as executed had been approved by
BAPEX and Petrobangla and was submitted by Petrobangla to the
Ministry. Following consultation of other Governmental authorities and
corrections in the JVA in response to their comments, the draft JVA was
submitted to the Prime Minister with the State Minister’s
recommendation of 7 September 2003. On 11 October 2003, the Ministry
gave direction to execute the JVA “approved by Honorable Prime Minister’.

1418. In light of these facts and considerations there is no basis for
considering the approval process as “perverted” or tainted by
irregularities.

9.8.4 The alleged interventions by the State Minister and the Prime
Minister

 

1419. As mentioned above, the Respondents also alleged that the State Minister
and the Prime Minister intervened in the preparation of the JVA and
influenced the terms of this agreement in favour of Niko. In this context
they wrote:

The corrupted State Minister and the Prime Minister’s office reversed
the consistent positions of the Government, Petrobangla, and BAPEX
that the JVA would be subject to the Swiss Challenge process and
could not include Chattak East, and the Ministry ordered Petrobangla
and BAPEX to enter into the JVA on Niko’s terms. 959

1420. There is no evidence on record about any such order by the Ministry or
by the State Minister to the Respondents; the assertion concerning the
reversal of the Government’s and the Respondents’ consistent position is
contrary to the evidence on record.

1421. Mr Chowdhury stated in his witness statement that the State Minister
tried to convince him to approve Niko’s project and he refused to do so.96°
Mr Chowdhury does not state that someone else in the Ministry gave such
an order; he provided testimony that his replacement Mr Islam “sent the
request for a legal opinion to the Law Ministry”,°°! a point that has been
discussed above. If there was a request by the State Minister to adopt the

959 R-MC, paragraph 7.
960 Chowdhury Witness Statement, paragraph 11.
961 Chowdhury Witness Statement, paragraph 15.

406

Niko project at Niko’s terms, it remained without effect given the events
described above.

1422. Concerning the consistent position of BAPEX, Petrobangla and the
Government, allegedly reversed by the State Minister and the Prime
Minister, it is clear from the evidence that the position concerning the
Chattak field was indeed consistently held until 5 March 2003;9° but the
evidence shows that it was reversed as a result of the Law Ministry’s
opinion. The terms for the Chattak field were not concluded at “Niko’s
terms”. They were renegotiated following the Law Ministry’s opinion on
the contract area and in consideration inter alia of a Comparative
Economic Analysis of Niko’s conditions compared to a contract with an
IOC. The renegotiated terms were more favourable to BAPEX.

1423. The situation is no different with respect to the Swiss Challenge issue.
There is no evidence that the State Minister or the Prime Minister
intervened with the objective of excluding the recourse to this method.
Based on the evidence before these Tribunals, doubts about the
requirement of Swiss Challenge that remained in 2003 were dispelled by
an opinion by the Law Ministry.

9.8.5 Conclusions on the Government approval for the JVA

1424. The Tribunals have considered the Respondents’ request for a declaration
“that the Government’s approval [of the Agreements] was not transparent,
was mala fide, and was illegal under Bangladeshi law”9®? and the
allegation that this approval was obtained by “repeated instances of mala
fides and impropriety in the decision-making process” and _ their
conclusion that any of these acts

invalidates the Government’s decision to approve and direct
Respondents to enter into the Agreements. Together, they
overwhelmingly meet the criteria for holding the Agreements void ab
initio under Bangladeshi law.%*

964 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraphs 145 and 146.

407

1425. They have also considered the conclusion of the Claimant according to
which:

Fundamentally, the evidence indicates that the decision to approve
the JVA was therefore not in the State Minister’s control in any event;
but even if it was, there is no evidence of any improper conduct on his
part, 965

1426. The Tribunals have examined the evidence and concluded that the
approvals and the negotiations leading to them were conducted by
BAPEX and Petrobangla in a thorough manner in the interest of
BAPEX and Bangladesh. The evidence about the role of the Ministry in
that process does not show any intervention with the objective of
promoting the interests of Niko. Instead it supported the efforts of
BAPEX and Petrobangla and instructed them to ensure that the
allocations under the JVA were “beneficial to BAPEX and Bangladesh’.

1427. When concluding that the JVA was not affected by any irregularities, the
Tribunals found additional support in the conclusions reached by the
decision of May 2010 by the Bangladesh Supreme Court, High Court
Division in the BELA case. The court concluded:

We have seen that exhaustive discussions took place at the several
meetings of the Board of Petrobangla and Bapex before JVA was
approved and signed. We have seen also that JVA was approved by
the highest authority also.

[...]
From the above, we do find that the JVA was not obtained by flawed

process by resorting to fraudulent means. 9°

1428. In that case, decided after the end of the BNP rule, the new Government,
represented by the Ministry, and the Respondents in the present
Arbitrations, appeared as party. They had every opportunity to
demonstrate any irregularities in the approval procedure. The Court
nevertheless arrived at the conclusions just quoted.

1429. True enough, the Respondents insist that the Court did not and could
not have considered the allegations of corruption. The Tribunals, for their

65 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 178.
966 BELA Judgment, CLA-143, pp. 30 and 40, emphasis added.

408

part, have considered these allegations in depth and now turn to the
allegations of specific corrupting payments.

409

10 THE FACETS OF THE ALLEGED CORRUPTION

1430. The conduct alleged by the Respondents in support of the Corruption
Claim, as pointed out above, does not consist in a single act. Instead the
Respondents and their witnesses, in particular the Investigators, present
a complex picture of corruption with different facets. These facets range
from concrete acts of bribery, sanctioned by the conviction in Canada, to
the allegation of a corrupt scheme or “corrupt apparatus”’9°’ through
which Niko is said to have channelled bribes and procured the
Agreements. For instance, when the Tribunals first invited the
Respondents to produce evidence for corruption in the negotiation and
conclusion of the JVA and the GSPA, the Respondents explained:

This is not about a single payment to get the desired agreements.
Rather, Niko offered to pay, paid, and exerted influence on different
people to wrongfully obtain rights to develop Bangladesh’s resources.
The developments that led to the conclusion of the Joint Venture
Agreement (“JVA”) and Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement (“GPSA”)
took place over a period of years, and there is not direct evidence of
corruption in every communication and interaction. But it is clear from
the evidence now in the record that Niko, either directly or through
affiliates, agents, and third parties, offered and paid bribes to the
Government officials ultimately responsible for the approval of the
JVA and their approval was obtained by that corruption. 968

According to the Respondents,

From the time Niko first stepped foot in Bangladesh in 1997 through
the end of 2006, it used a network of so-called “consultants” to
promise and pay bribes to avoid an open and transparent bidding
process, obtain influence, and ultimately acquire government
approval for the JVA and the GPSA.%9

1431. The Tribunals have examined the different facets of the corruption, as
alleged by the Respondents, considering the Parties’ submissions and the
evidence adduced in support thereof.

10.1 Corruption “in kind” - the Canadian conviction (Toyota Landcruiser
and travel expenses)

1432. The facts leading to the conviction of Niko Canada in the Queen’s Bench
Court of Alberta were recorded in the Agreed Statement of Facts on which
the conviction is based. They have been described in these Arbitrations,
first in the Decision on Jurisdiction and now in this Decision on the
Corruption Claim.

1433. The State Minister, who had to approve the GPSA and played a role in
the action following the blowouts, was given an expensive motor vehicle
(a Toyota Landcruiser) and the “non-business related portion of [his] travel
and expenses” were paid by Niko Canada.97° The Agreed Statement of
Facts records:

Niko Canada made these payments in order to persuade the
Bangladeshi Energy Minister to exercise his influence to ensure that
Niko was able to secure a gas purchase and sales agreement
acceptable to Niko, as well as to ensure the company was dealt with
fairly in relation to claims for compensation for the blowouts, which
represented potentially very large amounts of money.97!

1434. The bribes took place in May and June 2005; the Minister resigned on 18
June 2005; the GPSA was signed on 27 December 2006 at a price
substantially below that requested by Niko. The RCMP was alerted by the
DFAIT on 20 June 2005 and commenced its investigation which
concluded with a conviction on 23 June 2011 on the basis of an Agreed
Statement of Facts.

1435. This sequence of events shows clearly that the bribes to the State Minister
in May and June 2005 had no influence on the approval of the GPSA
some one and a half years later by the State Minister’s successor. When
determining the fine that Niko Canada had to pay as part of its conviction
in Canada, the Court pointed out that the “Crown is unable to prove that
any influence was obtained as a result of providing the benefits to the
Minister” .972

The Tribunals concluded in their Decision on Jurisdiction that the acts
leading to the conviction in Canada do not justify treating the Agreements
as procured by corruption.

The Respondents nevertheless rely on these acts in support of their case.
They do so by arguing that, under the law of Bangladesh, corruption
payments are punishable even if they do not succeed in bringing about
the desired result. The Tribunals have discussed this issue above in
Section 6, concluding that causation is a requirement both for treating
as void a Governmental act under Article 102 of the Constitution and for
avoiding a contract under the Contract Act.

The Respondents also rely on the acts on which the Canadian conviction
is based as a sign of Niko’s inclination to corruption. Quoting Ms
LaPrevotte, they argue that “the guilty plea in Canada supports the idea
that Niko had a disposition to pay bribes to get a favorable outcome”;?73
and they rely on these acts to defend the Alam Judgment of the High
Court Division in its conclusion that “the Government approval process
was tainted by a corrupt scheme and thus ultra vires.”974

The Tribunals will now examine whether the acts on which the Canadian
conviction was based provide a foundation for the far broader allegation
according to which Niko had established a broad corruption scheme or
“apparatus” in Bangladesh. This requires first a closer look at the
circumstances in which the acts were performed and then the
comparison of these circumstances with the general scheme alleged by
the Respondents.

The principal detailed account of the gift of a Toyota Landcruiser to the
State Minister, apart from newspaper articles, is the Agreed Statement of
Facts. The events recorded there are as follows:

The vehicle had been purchased for the use by BAPEX pursuant to the
JVA; the purchase was apparently requested by BAPEX.975 The Agreed
Statement of Facts records:

973 R-RC, paragraph 138, quoting LaPrevotte Second Witness Statement, paragraph 15.

°74 Respondents’ letter of 21 December 2018, p.7.

978 The Agreed Statement of Facts records that the request had been made “pursuant to the terms of the
JVA” and thus can only have been made by Niko’s JV-partner, BAPEX to which the vehicle was registered.
The statement of Mr Sharif confirms that the request was made by BAPEX (see below paragraph 1445).

412

Niko Bangladesh had originally been requested to purchase the Land
Cruiser pursuant to the terms of the JVA which allowed for assets to
be purchased by the Operator (Niko Bangladesh) for use by the JVA
partner (BAPEX). The vehicle was registered to BAPEX in
Bangladesh.97©

1442. The amount of the purchase price corresponds to some US$153,500,977
which was intended to be a Joint Venture expense. The Agreed Statement
of Facts continues the account of the events as follows:

The vehicle was registered to BAPEX in Bangladesh.

The Land Cruiser was not given to BAPEX. BAPEX instructed Niko
Bangladesh to deliver the vehicle to the Minister. As a result,
arrangements were made such that the SUV [Sport Utility Vehicle]
would be sent directly to the Energy Minister, AKM Mosharraf
Hossain. Qasim Sharif said that he himself advised Mr. Sampson of
the delivery. Mr Sampson denied that he was ever told that the SUV
was being delivered to the Minister.

Nevertheless, the re-direction of the vehicle from BAPEX to the
Minister operated as follows. On May 5, 2005, Mohamad Khan,
Personal Secretary to Energy Minister Hossain, wrote a letter to the
Chairman of Petrobangla requesting the vehicle be turned over for use
by Energy Minister Hossain.

On May 9, 2005, a letter signed by the Managing Director of BAPEX
was sent to Niko Bangladesh requesting the vehicle with all
documents and accessories be handed over to the Administration
Division of BAPEX. On the same day, a letter was sent from the
Administration Division of BAPEX to the General Manager (Services)
at Petrobangla advising that the vehicle is being sent for use by
Energy Minister Hossain. In addition during this time there were a
series of discussions within Niko Bangladesh trying to determine the
appropriate method of recording the vehicle in order to allow the
company to claim cost recovery of the vehicle expense under the JVA.
Three prior vehicles had been obtained under the JVA and in this case

the vehicle was dealt with differently due to the fact that it was to be
registered to BAPEX.978

The vehicle was then “delivered to the home of Energy Minister Hossain in
Dhaka, Bangladesh”, in the presence of “Qasim Sharif and Sayed Kabir,
both representing Niko Bangladesh’.979 On 20 June 2005, after the
Minister had resigned, “BAPEX took the vehicle back from the Ministry.”98°

While this account is taken from a statement of facts agreed by Niko, it
is the culmination of the investigation conducted since 2005 by the RCMP
and made before a court that must have had the RCMP records before it.
The Tribunals have no reason to doubt that the account reflects correctly
the recorded events.

In his interview with the RCMP, Mr Sharif provided some additional
details. In particular, Mr Sharif confirmed that the Toyota Landcruiser
was ordered at the request of BAPEX under the JVA. When the vehicle
was delivered, the State Minister requisitioned it and Mr Sharif delivered
it to the Minister:

The car came. We immediately registered it to BAPEX. Before the car
came he, BAPEX MD told me I think the minister's going to requisition
this car. Because any car that belongs to in any under any minister
he send official requisition for that car for ministry use or for his use.
[...] So when the car, the day the car came BAPEX MD was there. I
was there. And we actually delivered the car to the minister's
driver.9*1

The Tribunals conclude that the gift of the Toyota Landcruiser to the
State Minister was not a clandestine operation, hidden behind layers of
“consultancy” contracts. It was carried out directly and openly by Niko,
with the active involvement of both Respondents, BAPEX and
Petrobangla. In the end it benefitted BAPEX, which received the vehicle
after the resignation of the Minister. If the gift of the Toyota Landcruiser

is the sign of Niko’s “disposition to pay bribes’, this sign was known to
the Respondents since May 2005; and the Respondents had their share
in it.

The circumstances in which the gift was made to the State Minister is
relevant also for a different reason: the modus operandi in this incident
is quite different from that which characterised, according to the
Respondents, the operations of Niko in Bangladesh.%8? In this case, Niko
did not operate “through affiliates, agents, and third parties”,
using “a network of so-called ‘consultants’ to promise and pay bribes”, but
openly with the support of its Joint Venture partner BAPEX and the
knowledge of Petrobangla and indeed their active involvement. The
modus operandi in this instance thus is no confirmation of that described
by the Respondents and the Investigators; it may even be said to
contradict it.

To be clear, these considerations do not diminish, in the eyes of the
Tribunals, the seriousness of the attempted corruption of the State
Minister committed by Niko when it made the gift of the Toyota
Landcruiser and the travel expenses. They do, however, raise doubts
about the Respondents’ allegations concerning Niko’s “network” of
corruption based on these acts.

10.2 Corruption in a state of Kleptocracy

1449.

The Respondents and their experts have described the BNP Government
under Prime Minister Khaleda Zia as “a kleptocratic regime”,98° rife with
corruption. They asserted that the decisions of the Government were
effectively controlled by a “powerhouse” run by her sons, Tarique and
Arafat (Koko) Rahman, with a network of friends and associates.
“Respondents have described corruption of the State Minister of Energy
and the Prime Minister’s son running a parallel government’ .°84+ In their

982 The difference is highlighted by the Respondents themselves, e.g. at R-MC, paragraph 3: “Unlike the
$190,000 CAD Toyota Landcruiser Niko gave to the State Minister to buy his favor in procuring the GPSA,
Niko’s other bribes to procure the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA) and GPSA were hidden in layers of
‘consulting agreements’ concluded with individuals who paid bribes on Niko’s behalf, often using cash and
other financial transactions designed to hide the ultimate recipient of the payments.”

984 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 66.

Memorial on Corruption, the Respondents present the “extent of
perversion of the Government’s approval process”:

The testimony of Mr. Khan and FBI Agent LaPrevotte, as well as
contemporaneous reporting from the United States Embassy in
Dhaka, demonstrate that from October 2001 to January 2007, the
Prime Minister’s office, under the effective control of the sons of the
Prime Minister and their associates, together with the various
ministries of the Government, engaged in widespread corruption in
the granting of licenses and public contracts. Many contracts were
granted to companies, not based on merit and the promotion of the
interests of the people of Bangladesh, but based on the payment of
“consultancy fees” that were channelled to the people in power
through their associates. Niko promised and paid bribes to Giasuddin
al Mamoon, the very powerful associate of the son of the Prime
Minister, Tarique Rahman, in order to obtain the Government’s
approval of the JVA and GPSA. Niko also paid bribes to the State
Minister in the line of authority for the approval of its contracts and at
least one Petrobangla official.9°5

1450. Elsewhere in the same submission, the Respondents write and quote Mr
Ferdous Khan, one of their experts:

There was systematic corruption in Bangladesh at the time Niko
procured its contracts, and, according to an expert who was closely
involved in all of the investigations of corruption during this period, it
would not have been possible for Niko to obtain the JVA or the GPSA
without participating in that corruption.

Five of the six years from 2001 to 2006, when Niko worked to procure
and eventually procured the JVA and GPSA, Bangladesh was placed
at the bottom of Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions
Index and was near the bottom in the sixth year.

The Prime Minister’s sons, and especially her eldest son, Tarique
Rahman, held tremendous power in her Government. According to
one commentator: “Tarique’s office at that time [2001-2006] located in
a building called Hawa Bhavan in Dhaka was the real power center

985 R-MC, paragraphs 185; the report from the United States Embassy in Dhaka, referred to in this passage
is an extract from a classified message sent by the United States Ambassador, undated but subsequent to
11 September 2008 (the date of departure of Tarique Rahman from Bangladesh) mentioned in the report.
The report, produced as Exhibit R-343 from Wikileaks, describes the situation in Bangladesh and
specifically the actions of Tarique Rahman, mentioning some of the bribery cases uncovered, including
Siemens and Harbin, but not Niko.

of the government. His mother Khaleda Zia, the prime minister, could
do little else but agree to his demands.”

Mr. Ferdous Khan, a chartered accountant engaged to assist the
Government of Bangladesh’s corruption investigation, explains:

investigations uncovered that the decisions of the Prime Minister’s
office on government contracts and concessions were controlled by
Tarique and Koko among others; and favorable decisions could be
obtained by promising and paying money to close friends and
business associates of theirs cynically referred to as “consultancy
fees”. These “consultants” would then channel this bribe money to
Tarique and Koko and others, and who would in turn get the Prime
Minister’s office to approve the contracts.

The primary consultant linked to Tarique was his secondary school
friend and business associate Md. Gias Uddin al Mamoon. Mamoon’s
brother, Member of Parliament Hafiz Ibrahim, also collected bribes for
Tarique and Koko. Tarique and Mamoon set up their headquarters in
arented house, known as Hawa Bhaban, which became infamous as
a center of government power and corruption in Bangladesh from
2001 to January 2007.986

1451. The Respondents make a point of linking the general system of corruption
so described to Niko’s attempts to obtain the JVA and the GPSA:

... the evidence is clear that, from October 2001 to January 2007, the
individuals controlling the decisions of the Prime Minister’s office and
various Ministers of the BNP Government were engaged in
widespread corruption in the granting of licenses and public
contracts. In this environment, Niko thrived, promising and paying
bribes to Mr. Mamoon, who was connected to the son of the Prime
Minister, Tarique Rahman, and to the State Minister for Energy, in
order to obtain the Government’s approval of the JVA and GPSA. Niko
also paid smaller bribes to lower level officials.987

1452. The Respondents rely on this characterisation of the BNP Government as
a “red flag’. Referring to some cases and legal writings, the Respondents
argue that

... the standard of proof can be met by an unrebutted presentation of
prima facie evidence of corruption. This is because it is an
“established” rule of international law that “in case a party ‘adduces

986 R-MC, paragraph 46-49; footnotes omitted; the quotation is from Khan Witness Statement, paragraph
20-21.
987 R-RC, paragraph 344.

1453.

1454.

1455.

1456.

some evidence which prima facie supports his allegation, the burden
of proof shifts to his opponent’.” Indeed, certain classic “red flags” of
corruption can suffice to shift the burden onto the party denying its
existence.988

Quoting a publication of the International Chamber of Commerce, the
Respondents assert that one such red flag is raised when “/t/he operation
takes place in a country known for corrupt payments” .°89 The Respondents
consider that one may accept “that the general prevalence of corruption in
acountry is not independently sufficient proof of corruption in a particular
case”. They are, however, of the view that “the evidence of corruption in
Bangladesh at the relevant time and Niko’s agreement with a key corrupt
player is very relevant to determining the likelihood of corruption in this
case”.990

Indeed, as will be seen below when Niko’s proven or alleged relations with
certain players in Bangladesh are discussed, the Respondents seek to
establish dealings of Niko with certain players related to the “power
house” as evidence for corruption, or at least as prima facie evidence
which the Claimant would have to rebut. It is alleged that by such a
demonstration the Respondents could, in the absence of such rebuttal,
dispense with having to prove that certain payments were used for
corrupting a Government official.

It is not the role of these Tribunals to pass judgment on the Government
of Bangladesh during a certain period and the general corruption
allegations made by the Respondents and their experts. Without making
a determination in this respect, the Tribunals nevertheless take account
of these allegations and the supporting material presented by the
Respondents.

This does not relieve the Tribunals of their duty to examine concretely,
and carefully, whether acts of corruption occurred in the procurement of
the Agreements. This is all the more necessary as the testimony at the
April 2017 Hearing provided indications that the corruption in the
Government in general and the Ministry of Energy specifically may not

have been as generalised as the Respondents and the two Investigators
stated in their testimony.

1457. The Claimant has pointed out that this evidence that came out at the
Hearing paints a significantly different picture.99!

1458. To the extent that the Respondents’ theory relies on the general allegation
that an all-encompassing kleptocracy existed under the BNP
Government, the evidence of the Respondents’ own witnesses did not
support the assertion that the Energy Ministry was rife with influence
peddling, much less that it was subject to the control of Mr. Mamoon. As
noted above, Mr. Chowdhury, who had served as Joint Secretary in the
Energy Ministry during the BNP Administration, testified that he saw no
signs of corruption or attempted corruption in connection with any other
Energy project.99?

1459. At the Hearing, Mr Chowdhury was questioned by the Tribunals about
his experience with corruption. In his witness statement he had
explained his experience as Acting Secretary in the Ministry of Energy
from February to September 2002.993 The State Minister

... tried very hard to convince me to approve Niko’s project, but I was
convinced that BAPEX and Petrobangla were correct that Chattak
East could not be included and that a competitive bidding process had
to be followed. The State Minister was known for his unscrupulous
character, and I was not persuaded by him.?4

1460. At the Hearing the Tribunals sought to understand more generally the
state of corruption which Mr Chowdhury experienced. During his time at
the Energy Ministry, “there were three or four procurements of
petroleum”?°5 by public tenders that were “worth million or dollars” ;99° but
Mr Chowdhury was not aware of “any other attempts to secure contracts
through corrupt means”.997 He did not experience any other case of
corruption.

During the prior tenure of Prime Minister Khalida Zia, Mr Chowdhury
had been appointed by her to the Prime Minister’s Department where he
served as Director General998 and, after his service at the Energy
Ministry, he was transferred to the Food Ministry as Acting Secretary.999
He did not experience corruption in these positions either. Before being
posted to the Ministry of Energy, he held positions in the Election
Commission and the Ministry of Finance.!°°° Summing up, he was
questioned by the Tribunals:

Is my understanding of your evidence correct that, in your experience
in this period, the only corrupt contract you encountered or in an
attempt to procure, a corrupt contract that you encountered was the
Niko contract?

MR CHOWDHURY: Yes.

Questioned about Mr Khan’s description of the organised system of
corruption, referred to as “Kleptocracy”, Mr Chowdhury stated that “it
was widely known at that time that the Prime Minister’s eldest son,
through his friend Giasuddin Mamoon, they were intervening in different
contracts and making money out of it’.!°°! But he did not relate any
concrete example. Questioned about the acts of the State Minister whom
he had qualified as “unscrupulous”, Mr Chowdhury, qualified:

Before. It all occurred before he became minister.

Considering the evidence of Mr Chowdhury, who had direct inside
experience in senior positions in the Government, it appears that the
system of corruption may not have been as pervasive as the Respondents
and the Investigators now present it.

The Claimant also points out that, contrary to other cases mentioned by
the Investigators, such as the Harbin case, “there is no evidence of a
payment directly or indirectly benefitting Mr. Rahman in this case, despite
the Respondents having access to an extensive set of banking records for
those individuals’ °°

1465. The Tribunals conclude that, taking at face value the Respondents’
assertions that during the time of the BNP government there was
widespread corruption, such broad-brush aspersions on an entire State
cannot replace the evidence that is required to establish guilt in
individual cases.

10.3 The use of consultants and “layering”

1466. A major pillar in the Respondents’ demonstration of Niko’s alleged
corrupt procurement of the Agreements rests on the agreements which
Niko concluded with companies or persons referred to as “consultants”.
Referring to a modus operandi the Respondents observed when
examining the conduct of some other companies, specifically Siemens,
when bidding for a project in Bangladesh, the Respondents and the
Investigators perceive Niko’s consultants as engaged for the sole purpose
of channelling corrupt payments to the relevant decision makers. Ms
LaPrevotte explained it thus:

Based on my investigation, I believe that Niko Resources hired
consultants and set up companies for the express purpose of paying
bribes to politically influential people and their family members to
obtain a number of favourable rulings and the ultimate awarding of
the gas exploration rights in Bangladesh. 1993

1467. Mr Khan summarised the position:

...actual corruption also occurred when Niko retained the services of
Stratum through Qasim Sharif.1004

1468. For the Respondents the engagement of consultants is evidence of
corruption. The Respondents go even further and speak of a “prohibition
in Bangladeshi law against using consultancy agreements with private
citizens to influence Government officials” 1005

1003 LaPrevotte First Witness Statement, paragraph 43.
1004 Tr. Day 2 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 168, Il. 12-14.
1005 R-RC, paragraph 306.

421

1469. The Claimant disputes this contention:

... the record clearly demonstrates that Niko’s engagement of Stratum,
Nationwide and Five Feathers was undertaken openly and for
entirely legitimate purposes, and was in accordance with well-
established practice in the international oil and gas industry. '0°°

1470. The Tribunals will consider first the use of consultants by Niko in general
and then examine specifically the agreements with each of the
consultants engaged by Niko.

10.3.1 Niko’s use of consultants

1471. The Respondents describe the modus operandi which the Investigators
found in the practice of Siemens and other companies, seeking contracts
in Bangladesh. They assert that Niko followed the same modus operandi
and conclude that the use of consultants by Niko was a sign that Niko
used corruption. The Respondents argue:

Siemens plead guilty to corruption and using the same “consultants”
structure as Niko in Bangladesh during the same time period. 1°07

1472. Ms LaPrevotte asserted:

During my time investigating corruption in Bangladesh, I saw a
familiar modus operandi for obtaining contracts by bribery. Bribes
were paid to government officials through ‘on the ground” consultants
who then funnelled the money to government officials and their adult
children. Front-men, like Giasuddin al Mamoon and his brother Hafiz
Ibrahim serve as intermediaries to channel money from companies to
the sons of people in power, like Tarique Rahman and other adult
children of government ministers who then exercise political influence
to ensure contracts are awarded to the paying company. Companies
seeking contracts in Bangladesh hire these intermediaries as
“consultants” even though they often have no expertise in the relevant
field (such as telecommunications, hydropower, or oil and gas) and
use them as the conduits for bribes because of their well-known
connections to family members of public officials. While conducting my
investigations in Bangladesh, I investigated several allegations of

1006 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 16.
1007 R-MC, paragraph 71.

422

1473.

1474.

1475.

1476.

bribes paid to the sons of ministers to influence the awarding of
contracts, 1008

In her investigation of the Niko case, Ms LaPrevotte “saw many parallels”
with the Siemens case, and “the hiring of ‘on the ground’ consultants to
influence actions (the modus operandi in Bangladesh at the time)’ was
among those which she specifically highlighted. 1009

On the basis of these assertions, the Respondents argue:

...Niko’s use of consultants to carry out its corruption began when it
entered the country and hired Sharfuddin Ahmed in 1997 and Qasim
Sharif in 1998. Qasim Sharif and his company, Stratum
Developments Ltd., were the center of Niko’s corrupt transactions in
Bangladesh after the relationship with Sharfuddin Ahmed soured. 1°10

From the time Niko first stepped foot in Bangladesh in 1997 through
the end of 2006, it used a network of so-called “consultants” to
promise and pay bribes to avoid an open and transparent bidding
process, obtain influence, and ultimately acquire government
approval for the JVA and the GPSA.10!!

In addition, the Respondents make a more broad-brush argument, based
on Section 163 of the Penal Code and assert that consultancy agreements
as such are illegal. They assert:

Independently of Niko’s bribes, as described above, Claimant’s
written agreements with Five Feathers, Qasim Sharif, and
Nationwide and its verbal agreement with Mr. Mamoon are patently
illegal agreements under Section 163 of the Penal Code of
Bangladesh. Niko’s consultants were guilty of this crime and Niko
was equally guilty of abetting this crime.'0!2

The Claimant objects against the assimilation of Niko’s consultants with
the modus operandi in the cases referred to by the Respondents:

... the Respondents rely upon the “similar fact” theory asserted by
their witnesses Ferdous Khan and Debra LaPrevotte Griffith that

1008 LaPrevotte First Witness Statement, paragraph 14.
1009 LaPrevotte First Witness Statement, paragraph 19.
1010 R-MC, paragraph 65.

1011 R-MC, paragraph 184.

1012 R-RC, paragraph 304.

423

Niko’s alleged “layering” scheme was virtually identical to the scheme
deployed in several reported corruption cases, most notably by
Siemens in connection with a_ telecommunications tender in
Bangladesh during the BNP-Jamaat e Eslami Government.

Yet an examination of the evidentiary record in these proceedings
reveals that the circumstances surrounding Niko’s use of consultants
was nothing like the situation in the Siemens case, or indeed any of
the other cases referred to by the Respondents. Instead, the record
clearly demonstrates that Niko’s engagement of Stratum, Nationwide
and Five Feathers was undertaken openly and for entirely legitimate
purposes, and was in accordance with well-established practice in
the international oil and gas industry.'°!3

1477. The Tribunals conclude that in order to form an opinion on the
justification of Niko’s consultancy agreements, and on the question
whether these agreements can be taken as evidence for corruption, they
must consider the circumstances under which the agreements were
concluded and the objectives they were to serve. The Respondents seem
to recognise that the circumstances must be examined with care when
they discuss the “red flags” of corruption, which are warning signals and
possible clues but not evidence. They argue that

...certain classic “red flags” of corruption can suffice to shift the

burden onto the party denying its existence. Such red flags include
circumstances in which:

[oJ

* aconsultant’s or third party intermediary’s “commission or fee
seems disproportionate in relation to the services to be
rendered”;

e¢ ‘fti/he only qualification the [t]hird party brings to the venture is
influence over public officials”; ...1°14

1478. Ms LaPrevotte makes a similar observation:
The existence of a so-called "consultancy agreement" that provides for

payment for obtaining a government contract is a huge red flag for
bribery. 1915

1013 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraphs 15 and 16.
1014 R-MC, paragraph 165.
1015 LaPrevotte First Witness Statement, paragraph 17.

424

1479. When considering the justification of the consultancy agreements
concluded by Niko, the Tribunals have first of all considered that, when
it made its proposal to the Government of Bangladesh in April 1997 and
June 1998, Niko was not simply responding to an invitation to tender for
the sale of equipment but presented an unusual proposal. At the time,
the Respondents and the Government did not have any plans to exploit
the gas resources in marginal/abandoned gas fields. As the Respondents
and the Investigators repeatedly have pointed out, the very concept of
marginal/abandoned gas fields was not known in Bangladesh. 1016

1480. Niko’s first task was therefore to demonstrate to the Respondents and the
Government that this new concept was worth pursuing. Since this was a
new project developed by Niko, it would seem only logical that Niko
needed to establish credibility in some form in the eyes of relevant
officials in the proper exercise of their functions. In these circumstances,
a person or company familiar with the organisational structures and
administrative procedures in the country would seem to be essential to
ensure the fullest comprehension and consideration of the project in the
local context and through effective presentation to the competent
authorities.

1481. Furthermore, Niko had no prior engagement in Bangladesh. Before
agreeing to the conditions of an investment in the country, careful
examination of the local conditions would seem essential.

1482. The Claimant presented Mr Christopher P. Moyes as expert. Mr Moyes
has had many years of experience in the oil and gas industry, including
in senior management position in in Gaffney, Cline & Associates, which
he describes as a “leading global petroleum advisory firm’, and since 1983
in his own group of companies. He provides “advisory services to clients
for investment in acquisition, valuation, and financing of oil and gas
projects” and states that he has “provided a wide range of consulting
services to a variety of oil and gas clients, including national oil companies,
super-majors, and small international start-ups,” adding that, in the
preparation of his report, he has drawn from his experience in “direct
negotiations of Host Government Instruments and other oil and gas

1016 E.g. R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 30.

425

agreements in various phases including in the countries of Ecuador, the
Philippines, Columbia, Bangladesh and Mozambique”.'°!7

1483. In his Expert Report of 10 January 2017, Mr Moyes describes the
difficulties in the process of negotiating for Host Government Instruments
from the perspective of (a) a new country entry for the investor and (b) in
particular in what he describes as “underdeveloped jurisdictions”. He
contrasts the “relatively organised laws and regulations in developed
countries with this latter category of countries.” He states:

In contrast, in many undeveloped jurisdictions the process of winning
a Host Government Instrument, even in a bid process, may be a long,
tortuous, uncertain, and opaque multi-year process. This uncertainty
may carry over after the bid process, with the selected bidder, or
possibly the top three bidders, being invited to enter into protracted
negotiations to finalize the Host Government Instrument terms.1018

1484. Mr Moyes provides an example from Bangladesh bidding practice:

... based on my experience, I am aware that the Bangladesh 2008
Bid Round for 28 blocks was announced February 2008, with bids to
be submitted May 2008. The two Production Sharing Contracts (PSCs)
ultimately concluded were signed with ConocoPhillips in June 2011,
over 3 years after the bids were submitted. 1°19

1485. Mr Moyes opines on the practice of in-country advisors:

In undeveloped jurisdictions, the use of in-country advisors with
extensive local knowledge, who are integrated into the society and
business community, advising on the logistics and negotiation of
investment agreements including Host Government Instruments was,
in the period 1997 — 2003 (and remains), common for small and
midsize companies, even more so when the opportunity is a new
country entry for the investor. Even some major oil and gas
companies would retain in-country advisors in similar situations. !°°

1486. The Respondents have rightly pointed out that Mr Moyes “had no
understanding of the facts of this case and was testifying based on

assumption.” 1021 Indeed, at the Hearing the Tribunals could establish
that some of the statements in Mr Moyes’ Expert Report were
assumptions. 1022 The Tribunals conclude that they cannot rely on Mr
Moyes’ opinion concerning the justification or reasonableness of the
particular terms and conduct agreed between Niko and its consultants
in this case. This does not, however, exclude that opinions based on his
broad international experience in international oil and gas projects be
given some weight.

1487. Indeed, the opinion Mr Moyes has expressed about the desirability and
necessity for an investor in the situation of Niko to have an in-country
representative, in the form of a consultant or otherwise, appears sensible
to the Tribunals.

1488. In these circumstances the Tribunals conclude that, especially in the
initial phase of the project development and the negotiations, the
engagement of consultants by Niko was not unusual in the oil and gas
industry. In the initial phase it may even have been insufficient, as one
may have to conclude from a document on which the Respondents relied
in a different context: In May 1999 the Senior Commercial Officer of the
DFAIT, based in Dhaka, wrote to the Canadian Coordinator South Asia
Division reported on the status of Niko’s bids and then concluded:

From these two indications we would suggest that (a) There may still
be scope for Niko at least in Block 9 & 10, but (b) In order to explore
this Niko needs to be much more active on the ground here, both in
terms of senior executives from Calgary and through an effective local
partner/agent which can deal with the government and other
IOCs. 1028

1489. A similar view had been expressed by the Energy Minister!°24 himself in
late 1997. On 24 December 1997, DFAIT wrote to Mr Ohlson:

The High Commissioner met the Energy Minister and mentioned
NIKO's interest, but the impression that Minister gave was that NIKO

should have more exposure and presence here during the initial
stages. 1025

The quotation concerns the period of the Awami League Government, and
the Energy Minister referred to is not the State Minister who requested
that the Toyota Landcruiser be delivered to him.

The service of local consultants, as used by Niko in the circumstances,
consisted in advice and assistance to the principal in the organisation of
its investment. One may also expect from such consultants, that they
provide assistance in advising the principal how to approach relevant
decision makers with information and proposals — a service for which an
effective consultant must be well versed in the decision-making practices
of the Government. Where necessary, direct contacts with the competent
authorities may also be part of the consultant’s activity, if the principal
itself is not available. As Mr Chowdhury explained: “/iJf Niko had any
issues, they may come to the Ministry”. While he added that “normally, we
do not entertain that’, he also stated that “there is nothing wrong, I found
nothing wrong” with the consultant coming to the Ministry. 1°26

Such assistance in itself is not a ground for reproach, provided, of course,
that legalities are scrupulously observed and interventions are not
obtained or accompanied by bribes or other improper forms of influence.

Such assistance is a legitimate activity which also embassies consider as
part of their task. For instance, interventions of the Canadian Head of
Mission in Bangladesh have been described as follows:

As Head of Mission, David Sproule made representations on behalf of
Canadian companies many times at all of his postings. Indeed it was
not unusual for the Canadian Mission to intervene on behalf of
Canadian companies. The Mission would assist in identifying who
would be the decision maker in the case and provide knowledge in
terms of the issues involved, perhaps introducing a member of the
company "to relevant government players" who had authority in the
award of such contract. It did not include any suggestion of payment
of bribes.1027

1494. The conclusion from this evidence and these considerations is that it was
reasonable for Niko to engage one or, possibly several, consultants.
The engagement of consultants in itself is no evidence that bribery was
intended or committed. At the same time, the conclusion that, in the
circumstances, Niko’s recourse to consultants was justified, does not
exclude that through these consultants acts of bribery were committed.
The Tribunals therefore must examine, one by one, the consultancy
agreements concluded by Niko in order to determine whether their
engagement aimed at the performance of corruption or, when procuring
the JVA and the GPSA, the consultants committed acts of corruption.

1495. When proceeding with this examination, it must be borne in mind that
the modus operandi on which the Respondents and the Investigators rely
consists in the system described in the previous section. The
Respondents’ claim of corrupt practices by Niko consist essentially of
assertions that Niko was part of the corrupt system in which bribes were
channelled to and through Tarique Rahman and his entourage and thus,
directly or indirectly, corrupted the decision makers in the Government.

1496. According to the Respondents, this alleged corrupt system as described
by themselves and the various Investigators was set up only once the
BNP Government with Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia at its head
came to power; she was sworn in on 10 October 2001.!9?8 Niko’s
systematic corruption, as described by the Respondents, thus can have
started only in late 2001 or 2002. This is indeed what the Respondents
have asserted in one of their submissions:

The behind the scenes corrupt activities to influence the negotiations
and approval of the JVA began in 2002. 1929

1497. Itis true that the Respondents do not exclude that incidents of corruption
occurred during the government of Sheikh Hasina who left office in July
2001.1080 Such instances, however, did not in the Respondents’
submission implicate that Government; they contend that during the
years 1997 to 2001 the subsequent network of corruption did not exist -
or at least was not connected to the power of the government then in

1028 R-RPO13, paragraph 14.
1029 R-RPO13, paragraph 20.

place. Indeed, the criminal proceedings against Sheik Hasina that had
been initiated with respect to the Niko case during her period in power
were quashed while those against Khalida Zia continue. 19!

1498. It is therefore inconsistent for the Respondents to assert, as quoted
above:

From the time Niko first stepped foot in Bangladesh in 1997 through
the end of 2006, it used a network of so-called “consultants” to
promise and pay bribes ...”.1032

or

Niko’s use of consultants to carry out its corruption began when it
entered the country and hired Sharfuddin Ahmed in 1997 and Qasim
Sharif in 1998.1033

1499. Ifthere was any systematic corruption by Niko, it could, according to the
Respondents’ own argument, have started only in 2002. Similarly, the
Tribunals find Ms LaPrevotte’s assertion that Niko’s consultants were “all
well familialy and politically connected with the BNP Government’ to be
unsupported, and must be rejected. 1954

1500. Based on the Respondents’ submissions, the Respondents’ allegations of
Niko’s systematic corruption therefore, if they are correct, do not apply
to the initial period of Niko’s entry into Bangladesh and the negotiations
of the JVA until late 2001.

1501. In order to leave no stone unturned, the Tribunals will nevertheless
examine the allegations of the Respondents in their entirety, starting with
the first steps of Niko towards participation in the development of gas
reserves in Bangladesh.

10.3.2 Five Feathers and Sharfuddin Ahmed

1502. On 15 August 1997 Niko Canada, acting by its President, Robert N.
Ohlson, concluded an Agreement with Five Feathers, referred to as the
“Representative” and acting by Sharfuddin Ahmed, Chief Executive. !035
The agreement starts by pointing out

That Niko has proposed a Joint Venture Contract (hereinafter referred
to as the “Contract”), with Sylhet Gas ‘Field Ltd. through the ministry
of Energy & Mineral Resources, Government of Peoples Republic of
Bangladesh for the development, production and marketing of
hydrocarbon from the Beanibazar and Fenchuganj Gas Fields located
in Sylhet, Bangladesh, at the sole risk and expense of Niko under the
terms and conditions as stipulated in Annexure “A”.

1503. This proposal for a Joint Venture contract with Sylhet Gas Field Ltd. has
not been produced. From subsequent correspondence on records of these
Arbitrations one may conclude, however, that it was made on 12 April
1997 and was “a preliminary proposal’ to that which Niko made on 28
June 1998 and which eventually led to the JVA.196 It is not known,
however, how closely the April 1997 preliminary proposal resembled that
of June 1998. The two proposals differed at least insofar as, in the June
1998 Proposal, the number of fields was extended by two additional
fields, Chattak and Kamta.

1504. The services of the Representatives in the Five Feathers agreement are
described as follows:

... Niko requires the active assistance of Five Feathers to secure and
execute the Contract as mentioned above: (hereinafter referred to as
the “Services”) without having to engage in a competitive bidding
exercise.

... both parties agree to work diligently and professionally to secure
and execute the Contract and that Five Feathers will work exclusively
with Niko and will under no circumstance represent any other
corporation, individual or entity, to explore, produce, develop or
market hydrocarbon from the Beanibazar and Fenchuganj Gas
Fields. 1037

1037 Agreement between Niko Resources Ltd. and Five Feathers, Exhibit R-329.

431

1505. The following compensation is provided for the Representative:

... inconsideration of Services to be rendered by Five Feathers to Niko,
Niko will compensate Five Feathers as follows:

(a) US$25,000 (Twenty five Thousand) payable immediately upon
signing this agreement.

(b) US$1 00,0001938 (One Million) payable on the same calendar day
of signing the Contract.

(c) A running commission of 1.5% (with a deductible of US$25,000) of
the total capital expenditure of the field development work in the

Beanibazar & Fenchuganj Gas Fields as described in Annexure
“A”, 1039

1506. With respect to its duration, the Agreement provides:

This agreement will remain valid for a period of one year to allow
execution of the Contract and will remain valid for so long as Niko
operates the Beanibazar & Fenchuganj Gas Fields.

1507. The Claimant asserts that its “relationship with Five Feathers and
Sharfuddin Ahmed had ceased by 2000, well before the start of the
Targeted Period”!°4° and that it has no evidence that any services were
performed after 2000.14! This is not contradicted.

1508. Five Feathers seem to have been involved in the presentation of the June
1998 Proposal. A sheet presenting Five Feathers is attached to that the
proposal:

We cover the whole gamut of the oilfield services and equipments
supply and represent the following International reputed
Companies. 1042

1509. This is followed on the sheet by a list of 24 companies from Europe and
the U.S.

1038 Sic; the correct number, nevertheless, seems to have been 1,000,000.

The engagement of Five Feathers was thus disclosed to the addressee of
this proposal, i.e. the Ministry, as well as all to those who received a copy
of the proposal. The engagement must have been disclosed also to others.
For instance, the Senior Commercial Officer at the Canadian High
Commission in Dhaka, in his message reporting to Mr Ohlson on latest
developments about the PSC bidding round, seems not only to have
understood Five Feathers to be the local contact of Niko in Bangladesh,
but indeed sought to contact him:

I have tried several times to contact Mr. Sharfuddin of Five Feathers
but to no avail. 1043

In February 2000, Niko recognised that Five Feathers had been “actively
supporting” its efforts, possibly in relation to the FOU, as the invoice of
26 August 1999 seems to indicate; but otherwise, there is little known in
these Arbitrations about the activity of Five Feathers for Niko. The
Claimant explains this by pointing out that “it was not anticipated that
Niko would be required to address matters occurring wholly outside the
Targeted Period” .1044

With respect to payments to Five Feathers, Niko made the initial payment
of US$25,000. The balance gave rise to disputes which merit attention.

After the conclusion of the FOU on 23 August 1999, Five Feathers
addressed an invoice to Niko on 26 August 1999, claiming payment of
US$111,683 in consideration of “concluding signing of Agreement dated
23-08-99 between BAPEX and NIKO on Framework of Understanding for
the study of Development & Production of Hydrocarbon from the
Nonproducing Marginal Gas Fields of Chattak, Feni and Kamta”.'°45 In a
letter of 14 February 2000, Niko recognised that Five Feathers was
“actively supporting our efforts up until our dispute arose some time on the
first week of November, 19991946 and agreed to settle the claim for
compensation by an immediate payment of US$35,000, an amount which

was actually paid. The balance of US$76,683 was reserved for payment
upon conclusion of the BAPEX/Niko JVA.

After the JVA had been executed on 16 October 2003, Five Feathers
claimed payment of the balance. Since it does not seem to have
succeeded, it retained a lawyer who claimed the amount in a letter of 5
February 2004.!947 The Claimant asserts that it is “not aware of any
payment being made by Stratum or Niko in response to this demand” .1048
This is uncontested!°49 and the Tribunals have not seen any evidence for
a payment of the claimed amount of US$76,683 or any other payment
apart from those of US$25,000 and US$35,000, mentioned above.

The Tribunals conclude, based on the evidence on record, that the total
amount paid to Five Feathers is US$60,000.

In the eyes of the Respondents, the Five Feathers agreement is part of
Niko’s scheme of corruption. They describe this agreement as fitting “the
mold of a classic arrangement to use a consultant as a conduit for
bribery”’,'°5° where bribes were “hidden in layers of ‘consulting
agreements” .1051

When considering this allegation, it should first of all be pointed out that
the engagement of Five Feathers was fully transparent: as just
mentioned, the company was presented by Niko together with its June
1998 Proposal and its appointment was known also to others.

Apart from the general assimilation of consultancy contracts with “a
method to facilitate bribery”, as described by Ms LaPrevotte,!°5? the
Respondents provide as support for this characterisation of the Five
Feathers agreement (i) the allegation of a deceitful contradiction between
the promise of a competitive process in the form of Swiss Challenge and

the engagement of Five Feathers to avoid “a competitive bidding exercise”
and (ii) an “astronomical” compensation. 1°53

1519. The Claimant has denied these allegations.!°54 The Tribunals have
examined them closely and examined them against the evidence relied
upon by the Respondents.

1520. The first of the Respondents’ allegations presents Niko’s proposal as an
attempt to avoid competitive procedures for which Niko was not
qualified. The allegation consists in saying that, having failed in the PSC
bid, Niko sought to obtain rights to petroleum rights in Bangladesh by
introducing the hitherto unknown concept of abandoned and marginal
fields, thus avoiding competitive procedures while, at the same time,
promising competition through Swiss Challenge:

Niko knew from the earlier bid round for production-sharing contracts
that it would not be able to stand up to competition from any
minimally qualified internationally company. 105

1521. According to the Respondents, Niko’s corrupt practices

... began in 1997, when it was found financially and technically
unqualified to participate in the legally-sanctioned bid rounds for oil
and gas contracts. Niko set out to obtain rights outside the normal
competitive bidding process. It sought rights by introducing the
concept of abandoned and marginal fields.10>©

1522. The Five Feathers consultancy, according to the Respondents, was
intended to avoid competition which Niko nevertheless promised:

... at the same time as it was making the offer to the Government with
a commitment to an open and transparent bidding process, Niko—
using a contract that had all the earmarks of a contract for
corruption—hired a “consultant” to “secure and execute” the JVA
“without having to engage in a competitive bidding exercise.”1957

1523. Ina similar line of argument, the alleged contradiction is taken as a sign
that the Five Feathers agreement was a “vehicle for the payment of bribes”:

1053 R-MC, paragraphs 35 and 36.

1054 E.g. C-CMC, paragraphs 223 - 226 and C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraphs 103-112.
1055 R-MC, paragraph 35.

1056 R-MC, paragraph 4.

1057 R-MC, paragraph 35, emphasis in the original.

435

But Niko was anything but transparent. Just prior to sending this
letter to the Ministry, Niko had entered into the first of many
consultancy agreements for the sole purpose of helping it procure “a
Joint Venture Contract [...] through the Ministry of Energy & Mineral
Resources |...] without having to engage in a competitive bidding
exercise.” The consultant would receive one million dollars on the day
such a contract was signed and a lucrative running commission. The
contract has the earmarks of a thinly-veiled vehicle for the payment
of bribes. And, in light of all the evidence in this case, it clearly was
just that. It also shows that Niko’s first approach to the Government
with respect to its investment was made in bad faith. Niko’s behavior
only got worse thereafter. 1958

1524. The assertion is maintained throughout the proceedings on the
Corruption Claim. In their last submission, the Respondents refer to the
quoted passage as one of the examples establishing Niko’s bad faith:

Hiring a consultant for a success fee of $1 million to obtain a JVA
“without having to engage in a competitive bidding exercise,” at the
same time that it convinced the Government to consider its project
based on promising a Swiss Challenge process “in order to ensure
transparency. "1059

1525. The Respondents go even further and take the Five Feathers agreement
as a sign of conspiracy:

Entering into an agreement with Five Feathers for “active assistance
[...] to secure and execute the [Joint Venture] Contract [...] without
having to engage in competitive bidding” constitutes conspiracy to
cause, and the aiding and abetting of, public servants’ violations of
Section 161 and Section 165, as well as the aiding and abetting Five
Feathers’ violation of Sections 162 and 163.1060

1526. Mr Khan made the same allegation. As mentioned before, he testified
about the agreement with Five Feathers and his understanding that they
were asked to bribe.

THE PRESIDENT: On what basis do you say that they were asked to
bribe?

MR KHAN: He was given an engagement letter, as a consultancy
agreement, as agent, on a success fee basis that he would procure a
contract from them on a non-competitive tender basis whilst the
formal arrangement from Niko as an offer to Petrobangla and BAPEX
was that they will do a tender and a Swiss Challenge.1°!

The Respondents’ allegation is in conflict with the evidence on record on
at least two accounts.

First, there is no evidence on the record and it is highly unlikely that, in
August 1997, when Niko concluded the agreement with Five Feathers, it
had any feedback from the PSC bidding round. The only evidence on
record about the evaluation process is the letter of Arthur Andersen of 29
September 1997 with the attached extracts from the evaluation.

The relevance of this evaluation for the present project has been
discussed above in Section 9.1; it appears that the criteria on which
Niko’s ranking was to be made do not indicate its lack of qualification for
the project at hand.!0©2 What matters now is that, in August 1997, when
the Five Feathers agreement was concluded, the PSC bid evaluation was
still ongoing. It is not plausible for the Respondents and the Investigators
to assert that Niko knew at that time how its PSC bid had been evaluated
and therefore set about devising a substitute method for obtaining
petroleum rights in Bangladesh.

In any event there is no evidence to show at what time the evaluation was
completed and when it was communicated to Niko. The Respondents
assert that in “May of 1998, Niko was notified that the Ministry and
Negotiation Committee considered its PSC bid offer ‘weak’ and its balance
sheet ‘not healthy’, such that Niko was ‘not in the race, let alone one of the
serious contenders” .1°3 This statement misrepresents the evidence. The
support on which the Respondents rely is not a notification by
Petrobangla or any other authority in Bangladesh about the results of the
PSC bid. It is an internal message of the Canadian foreign service, from
the DFAIT High Commission in Dhaka to the Coordinator South Asia
Division in Ottawa.!°6+ There is no information in the file as to the time

when this information related to the qualification was communicated to
Niko, nor as to whether and, if so, when Niko was notified of the outcome
of the PSC bid.

The DFAIT message of May 1998 does indeed contain the passage quoted
above, reflecting the low rating of Niko. It does, however, also state that
the Government of Bangladesh seemed to have deferred the decision on
Block 9 and 10, for which Niko had submitted its bids; and it states that
“there may still be scope for Niko, at least in Block 9 & 10”.1065

The Tribunals conclude that there is no basis to assume that Niko made
its proposal for the marginal/abandoned fields as a result of its failure to
succeed in the PSC bid. Indeed, it appears that, from the start, Niko
pursued two tracks, the PSC bid and the marginal/abandoned fields,
both of which had been initiated by the time when the Five Feathers
agreement was concluded — the Sylhet proposal on 12 April 1997 and the
PSC bid probably in early 1997, 1066

The Five Feathers agreement, however, deals with one of these tracks
only. The agreement did not apply to the PSC bid, to which competitive
procedures applied. This bid was not even mentioned in the Five Feathers
agreement. In other words, Five Feathers was not expected to represent
Niko in the PSC bid, following competitive procedures.

The Respondents and the Investigators also assert that there is a
contradiction between the offer of Swiss Challenge and the terms of
the Five Feathers consultancy agreement. The assertion conflates two
dates. The agreement was concluded not “at the same time” or “shortly
before” the Swiss Challenge proposal, as the Respondents affirm. As the
Claimant points out, the two events are almost a year apart.!°67 The
consultancy agreement was concluded on 15 August 1997, while the
Swiss Challenge proposal was made almost a year later, on 28 June
1998. The Respondents do not explain how Niko “conspired” in August
1997 to avoid the need to pursue a proposal which it had not made and
was not obliged to make.

1096 Neither the bid itself nor any other record attesting the submission of the bid has been produced in the
Arbitrations.

1535.

1536.

1537.

1538.

Moreover, the consultancy agreement specifies the “terms and conditions”
of the contract which the Representative is to promote. These terms and
conditions were annexed to the Five Feather agreement. Although this
annexure has not been produced, there is no evidence nor allegation that
the terms and conditions annexed to the Five Feathers contract made
any reference to Swiss Challenge. It is indeed not very plausible that the
Representative would be required and accepted to promote a project that
contradicts the proposal which the Principal made to the potential client.
Indeed, such a contradiction would have deprived the Representative of
his entitlement to obtain the remuneration.

In any event, as the Claimant pointed out, it is not very plausible for the
Respondents to argue that Niko engaged Five Feathers in August 1997
with the objective of avoiding by corruption the recourse to competition
by Swiss Challenge which they then proposed a year later.

If Niko, at the time of entering into the 1997 Agreement, was intending
to circumvent a Swiss Challenge process by bribery as the
Respondents’ allege, why would it later propose a Swiss Challenge
process at all, much less as part of its initial proposal?!068

As seen above, the proposal of Swiss Challenge and the engagement of a
consultant to avoid competitive bidding was almost a year apart.
Therefore, the Respondents’ presentation of the Five Feathers agreement
and its objectives is misleading: the alleged deceitful contradiction
between the proposal of competitive Swiss Challenge and “at the same
time” the engagement of a consultant to avoid competitive bidding
exercise is the result of the Respondents’ conflation of two dates almost
a year apart and has no evidentiary basis in the record of these
Arbitrations.

It also must be pointed out that, as shown above, an internal message of
13 November 1999 provides an indication that, prior to the FOU, Niko
planned on complying with the Swiss Challenge procedure. !°©9 Indeed, in
its letter of 1 February 2000 Niko confirmed its proposal of having Swiss
Challenge applied. 107°

The second basis on which the Respondents rely in presenting the Five
Feathers agreement as part of Niko’s scheme of corruption concerns the
amount of the agreed compensation. Apart from the US$25,000 upon
conclusion of the agreement, Five Feathers was promised US$1 million
upon conclusion of the joint venture agreement and 1.5% commission on
the total capital expenditures that would be made for field development
work, if the joint venture contract would be awarded. The services
required for this compensation are “active assistance of Five Feathers to
secure and execute the Contract’.

When examining whether such compensation is reasonable, one must
consider not only the value for Niko of the expected contract with Sylhet
Gas Fields but also that Niko had no “on the ground” base in Bangladesh,
and was proposing a project for a type of work which was unknown at
the time in Bangladesh. Five Feathers and Mr Ahmed were engaged as
Niko’s only representatives of Niko in Bangladesh. Mr Sharif was given
power of attorney only in April 1998 and Stratum was engaged even later.
Five Feathers was to provide its support for an up-front payment of only
US$25,000 and had to work on an exclusive basis. If the efforts failed, no
other remuneration was due. If the efforts would not succeed, Five
Feathers would not receive any other compensation.

In these circumstances, the Tribunals cannot see the agreed
compensation as “disproportionate to the services” to be provided. The
Respondents’ characterisation of that consultancy agreement as “thinly-
veiled vehicle for the payment of bribes”, in the Tribunals’ view is not
justified.

Finally, it should be pointed out that Five Feathers or Mr Ahmad do not
seem to have made any corrupt payment. Mr Khan, when questioned
about corruption by Mr Ahmed, was quite clear:

THE PRESIDENT: Mr Ahmed came after the JV was signed and said,
“IT want my money”.

MR KHAN: Correct.

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, he also said, “I did not bribe anybody”.

440

MR KHAN: He told us that he did not bribe anybody but he asked
them when the contract was signed, so he still wanted his success

fee.

THE PRESIDENT: Yes, because -- he wanted his success fee because
the success was achieved and do you have any indication that Mr
Ahmed bribed anybody?

MR KHAN: No, I did not.

[oJ

THE PRESIDENT: Mr Khan, if the JVA was procured by corruption, it
was not Mr Ahmed —

MR KHAN: No, it is not.
THE PRESIDENT: It was somebody else?
MR KHAN: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: So the contract with Mr Ahmed is no proof for the
corruption. We must -- if you want to show that the JVA was obtained
by corruption you have to look at somebody else because Mr Ahmed
said, “I did not pay the corruption”. Weill?

MR KHAN: Yes.
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.10°7!

1543. From the evidence before the Tribunals, the Tribunals conclude that
there is no evidence that Mr Ahmed or his company bribed anybody
on Niko’s behalf, nor did he make a commitment to pay bribes. There
is no evidence in the record that the consultancy agreement required
them to make such commitments nor is there any evidence that Niko
itself had made such a commitment or planned to do so, intending to
use Five Feathers as a “conduit”.

1544. Against this background and in view of this evidence, it is quite surprising
that Ms LaPrevotte, after having explained that Niko hired “at least three
‘on the ground’ consultants” of which the first was Five Feathers, asserts,
without distinction between the three consultants:

1071 Tr. Day 2 (CONFIDENTIAL), pp. 146-148.

441

My investigation provided probable cause to believe that money was
paid by Niko to these consultants who then made sure that money
was provided to those people with the power to influence a
determination that the fields were only marginal fields and to
influence the approval of the Joint Venture Agreement (JVA).1°72

1545. At the end of their examination of the first of these consultancy contracts,
the Tribunals have seen no evidence in these Arbitrations that would
justify Ms LaPrevotte’s asserted belief. It is uncontested that Five
Feathers was paid only US$60,000 and there is not even an allegation
that any part of this money was provided to anybody else. With respect
to the first consultant, Ms LaPrevotte’s belief is unfounded. Her testimony
might well have benefitted from deeper critical analysis of the evidence
provided.

1546. In conclusion: the evidence on the record in these Arbitrations does not
support the assertions made by the Respondents and the Investigators
about the Five Feathers agreement as evidence for corruption, for
intended corruption, for conspiracy, or for bad faith on the side of Niko.

10.3.3 Stratum Development Limited and Qasim Sharif

1547. Mr Qasim Sharif and his company Stratum Development Ltd (Stratum)
were the second consultants retained by Niko. They were Niko’s principal
representatives in Bangladesh. In the words of the Claimant, during the
time from Niko’s submission of the June 1998 Proposal until the
execution of the JVA, “Qasim Sharif, through Stratum, was Niko’s sole
permanent presence in Bangladesh and the cornerstone of its
activities” 1073

10.3.3.1 Niko’s agreements with Mr Sharif and his company Stratum

1548. From the record in these Arbitrations, the Tribunals understand the
history of the Sharif/Stratum involvement with Niko and the principal
agreements concluded in respect of Mr Sharif’s activity to be as follows.

Mr Sharif explained that in 1997 he was assisting Niko informally.1074
The Claimant states that Mr Sharif and Mr Ohlson knew each other from.
projects they had worked on together in the South Asia region and that
Mr Sharif introduced the idea of marginal field development in
Bangladesh to Mr Ohlson and Niko. 1075

Mr Robert Ohlson then appointed Mr Sharif, by a Special Power of
Attorney dated 8 April 1998, as “True and Lawful Attorney” for Niko
Canada and Niko Bangladesh, to act on his behalf

. In negotiating and carrying out the terms of any oil and gas
transaction within the Country of Bangladesh and to sign any
documentation relating to any acquisition on the Company’s
behalf. 1076

Following the submission of the June 1998 Proposal, Niko entered into
several agreements with Mr Sharif’s company Stratum.

A Carried Interest Agreement, providing for a 10% interest in the net
profits of Niko, if any, earned from production from a minimum 51% Niko
interest in the Kamta, Chattak and Feni gas fields as may be acquired
from BAPEX.!°77 The agreement is dated 7 July 1999. The Minutes of
the 23 March 2000 Niko Board meeting, however, note that “The Carried
Interest Agreement was in its final draft form which contained only minor
changes to the draft provided previously.” 1°78 In any event the conditions
under which such interest would have been earned by Stratum were
never met and no payment was ever made under this agreement.1!079

A Consultancy Agreement, dated 27 July 1999, under which Stratum
was required to provide specified services: these included assistance to
Niko in a broad range of fields, negotiating and furnishing of information
to BAPEX and the Government on behalf of Niko.!°8° The cost of any

employees or agents of Stratum assisting it in performing the services
would be borne by Stratum.

The fee due to Stratum was expressed as a percentage of the net share of
established proven reserves in Niko’s interest in the gas fields covered by
the future JVA and amounted to US$0.03 per mcf. The agreement
contained a detailed provision concerning the determination of this
share. As a “minimum initial consulting fee”, US$4 million were payable
upon execution of the JVA; “/ajll monies paid under the Management
Services Contract’ would be deducted from that amount. The agreement
had been concluded for one year, but was renewed several times. 108!

A Management Services Contract (the “Management Agreement”), 082
dated 1 October 1999, under which Stratum agreed to provide, on an as
requested basis,

the necessary Services to Niko Bangladesh to enable Niko
Bangladesh to satisfy its obligations in respect of the Project,
including, without limitation, technical, professional, legal,
accounting, administrative, marketing and advisory services.

These services were then defined in a detailed manner. The defined
services included providing technical and engineering advice, preparing
and coordinating plans and studies, procurement services, and
recruitment of highly-skilled technical or professional employees. The
agreement permitted Stratum to engage third parties to assist it
performing the stipulated services, the cost of such third-party services
was to be borne by Stratum.

The Management Agreement provided for a one-off up-front payment of
US$50,000 to cover start-up costs. Stratum’s compensation consisted in
a monthly fee of US$40,000 which had to cover “all costs and expenses
of Stratum including but not limited to personnel, overhead, rent, materials

and supplies, vehicles, transportation, taxes, third party charges and
insurance”. Effective 1 April 2001 the fee was reduced to US$20,000. 1°83

Subsequently Mr Sharif was appointed by Niko to the post of its Vice
President South Asia. !°8+ This position was confirmed in a document of
25 June 2003, in which Mr Ohlson, acting for Niko Bangladesh and for
Niko Canada certified that Stratum was an “affiliate” of Niko and that the
two companies were

. pursuing the development: Chhatak and Feni gas fields in
Bangladesh. Mr Qasim Sharif, Vice President South Asia of Niko
Resources (Bangladesh) Limited is also the Managing Director of
Stratum Developments Limited.

We expect to start operations in Bangladesh before the end of this
year. All costs and revenue of Stratum attributable to the Chhatak
and Feni Gas Fields will be from Niko. Mr. Qasim Sharif will continue
to be the head of our business unit in Bangladesh when operations
start. 1085

On 1 September 2003 Niko Canada confirmed to Mr Sharif his
appointment as the President of Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. and
specified the terms, including a monthly salary of US$16,666.67 and
other benefits valued at US$4,166.67.

When the JVA was about to be concluded, a new Management Services
Contact, dated 1 October 2003, was concluded by Niko with Stratum,
providing for a fee of US$20,000.1°86 An amendment, dated 1 November
2005, increased this retainer fee to US$30,000.1°87 This agreement was
similar to the earlier one. It contained, however, the following provision
concerning the fee:

... This fee shall cover Stratum’s fee in addition to all costs and
expenses made or incurred by Stratum related to the provision of the
Services such as payments made to expedite or secure the
performance by a foreign public official of any act of a routine nature

that is part of the foreign public official’s duties or functions, such as

(b) In addition to the foregoing fees Stratum shall invoice Niko
Bangladesh for, and Niko Bangladesh shall reimburse Stratum for,
all out of pocket expenses made or incurred by Stratum in relation to
the provision of the Services such as the costs of travel, boarding and
lodging, etc. In the event Stratum anticipates such expenses will
exceed US$5.000 in a Calendar Quarter-, Stratum shall obtain the
approval of Niko Bangladesh prior to incurring such expenses.

1561. According to the Claimant, Mr Sharif’s / Stratum’s work entailed acting
as president of Niko and overseeing its operations in Bangladesh until
November 2005. 1088

1562. The Minutes of the 23 March 2000 Niko Board meeting, Exhibit C-129
(CONFIDENTIAL) state:

The meeting was informed that the Company had executed the
Management Services contract and Consultancy Agreement with
Stratum Developments Ltd.

1563. The Minutes of the 23 March 2000 Niko Board meeting provide:

Upon securing the fields, the Company would make a payment of
US$4M to the agent. 1089

1564. The funding for the Stratum activity was provided by Niko Canada
through Niko. For instance, the Minutes of the 23 March 2000 Niko
Board meeting record, for the period from March to December 1999:

It was noted that during the nine months ended 31st December, 1999,
the Company received funds in the amount of $264,764 by way of a
loan from Niko Resources (Cayman) Ltd.

Capital expenditure of $248,885 was incurred during the period. The
majority of the funds expended ($175,187) were in relation to the
management services contract with Stratum. The remainder of the
funds were expended in the contract negotiations and technical work

involved in preparing a field development plan and in drafting the joint
venture agreement between the Company and the Bangladesh
Petroleum Exploration Co. Ltd. (“BAPEX”).1090

The Respondents argue that

... based on the record, the conclusion stands that Qasim Sharif, first
as agent, then as Vice President and President of Niko, received vast
sums of money from Niko and used that money to pay bribes for
Government approval of Niko’s project on Niko’s terms. Claimant
failed to show that its payments to Stratum and Qasim Sharif were
legitimate. 1091

Similarly, Ms LaPrevotte asserted that Mr Sharif “was also hired to

facilitate bribes payments’ . 1092

The principal allegations on which the Respondents rely for their
assertion concerning the Sharif/Stratum consultancy are:

¢ The fictitious nature of Stratum as a “dummy corporation’;

¢ Stratum being set up as a case of “layering” and “to further a
corrupt scheme”;

e The terms of the agreements, in particular the amount of the
compensation and its legitimacy; and

e The alleged absence of evidence for any work done by
Sharif/Stratum, in particular the absence of reports.

The Tribunals will consider these allegations seriatim.

10.3.3.2 The role of Stratum as a “dummy corporation” and as evidence
of Niko’s alleged scheme of corruption

The Respondents assert “that Stratum was set up to further a corrupt
scheme”.1093 The Respondents rely on answers given to an FBI enquiry

by the Zurich lawyer who had assisted in the creation of Stratum as a
Jersey company.!°94 In spring 1999 a person identified as “P’,
presumably Mr Sharif, contacted this lawyer upon recommendation of
Union Bancaire Privée (UBP). The lawyer explained that he was hired to
advise on setting up “an offshore company that would enter into contracts
[...] with the Canadian firm NICO Resources” .!°95 He described Stratum as
a “dummy corporation” which did not have offices, not even in Jersey. 109°
Ms LaPrevotte concluded that “Stratum Development was owned and
used by [Mr Sharif] to further his activities in Bangladesh” .1°97 She testified
that Mr Sharif, however, provided “false statements” to the FBI, 1° telling
that he was the Managing Director and there were other investors and
“that is not my company”.1°99

1569. The Respondents conclude that “/iJinvestigations revealed that Mr. Sharif
created Stratum solely to make a contract with Niko and move money”.!10°
Relying on the assertions of the Investigators, the Respondents also argue
that Stratum was used to distance Niko from corrupt payments. With
reference to Mr Khan, the Respondents state:

Mr. Khan explained that Niko used Stratum to distance itself from
payments by paying its consultant, not in the ordinary course of
business, but by having Mr. Sharif and his wife pay what Niko owed
under consultancy contracts personally to individuals, such as Mr.
Bhuiyan. Special Agent LaPrevotte further explained that: “In my
investigation the only role that Stratum Development played was
layering, distancing, the plausible deniability of the payment to
individuals. ”!101

1570. Ms LaPrevotte also stated:

Based on my experience and knowledge of money laundering and
corruption, it is clear to me that payments made from the Stratum

Development account for work being conducted on behalf of Niko was
done with the intent to distance Niko from the bribes being paid to
officials and their family members in Bangladesh. !10?

1571. The Claimant argues that it is “a well-established business practice for
people to utilize a corporate vehicle for the conduct of their business
(including in the consulting field) whether incorporated offshore (often for
tax reasons) or locally”. It also states

... there was clearly never any attempt to conceal the fact that Qasim
Sharif was [Stratum’s] principal, nor is there any suggestion that any
Bangladesh government official ever had any beneficial interest in
Stratum. 1103

1572. The Claimant also asserts that Mr Sharif “continues to this day to be
operating in the international oil and gas business under the Stratum name
(as Stratum Energy)”. It refers to the Stratum Energy’s website and the
“international oil and gas projects undertaken” by the company. It adds
that

It is difficult to fathom anyone choosing to carry on with a particular
corporate name, and advertising their prior association with Niko if,
as the Respondents want one to believe, Mr Sharif set Stratum up as
adummy corporation with the purpose and intent to further a corrupt
scheme in Bangladesh. 1104

1573. The Tribunals note that it is uncontested that Mr Sharif created
Stratum. The controversy about the reasons why he did so, in the opinion
of the Tribunals, is not decisive here. Mr Sharif may have set up Stratum
for tax reasons, as the Claimant mentions as a possible reason; he may
have intended to “distance” himself from payments made to him or by
him; but there is no evidence that Stratum was created by or at the
instructions of Niko or that Stratum and its accounts were used, as
stated by Ms LaPrevotte, “with the intent to distance Niko” from the alleged
bribes. The statement of Ms LaPrevotte to this effect simply relies on her
“experience and knowledge of money laundering and corruption” and no
evidence is provided for the alleged intent. 1105

1576.

Ms LaPrevotte’s statement also is in contradiction with the Respondents’
assertions, when they say that “Niko used Stratum” by “having Mr. Sharif
and his wife pay what Niko owed under consultancy contracts personally
to individuals”.!1°6 It is also in contradiction with Mr Khan’s testimony.
He explained “Niko appointed Stratum through Qasim Sharif’, referred to
Stratum as an off-shore company and described what he found out about
the payment flows. He concluded:

What we discovered was the money was being paid to the individuals
personally, so Five Feathers was not getting paid, Sharfuddin Ahmed
personal account paid for, even though there was a contract. It is
Qasim Sharif and Noreen Sharif writing out checks to Sharfuddin
Ahmed.1107

When Mr Khan observed that payments were made to the individuals
personally and not to the off-shore companies and that the individuals
then made the payments, it is not plausible to assert that the off-shore
companies were created to distance Niko or the individuals from the
alleged corrupt payments.

Similarly, Mr LaPrevotte considered that the incorporation of a company
in an off-shore jurisdiction is a “major factor” in assuming the pursuit of
“illegitimate purposes” by the company or individual. At the Hearing she
had the following exchange with the Claimant’s counsel:

MR COLE: .... are you suggesting that the only reason a company
would incorporate in an off-shore or an individual would incorporate
a company in an off-shore jurisdiction is for illegitimate purposes?

MS LAPREVOTTE: No, I am not. I am saying that it has been my
understanding in my investigations that frequently when a company
incorporates in the Channel Islands, Jersey, Isle of Man, Guernsey, it
was because they have incredible secrecy laws and ...

MR COLE: So if a company incorporates in one of those jurisdictions
you can make an assumption that they are doing so for an illegitimate
purpose and that may be rebutted but do you start from the
proposition that you will assume it is for illegitimate purposes until
proven otherwise?

1106 R-PHB1(CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 34.
1107 Tr. Day 2 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 117, Il. 12-17.

450

MS LAPREVOTTE: No, I do not start from that proposition. It is just one
factor I considered while investigating.

MR COLE: But you said it was a major factor here for you.
MS LAPREVOTTE: It was a factor.
MR COLE: A major factor you said, I think.

MS LAPREVOTTE: Well, yes, in totality of circumstances? It was a
major factor. 1108

1577. The Tribunals have considered this exchange and concluded that they
need not determine whether and to what extent the creation of an off-
shore company is “a factor” or a “major factor’ in assuming illegality. In
the present case the off-shore company was created by Mr Sharif and not
by Niko. If this creation is a factor in assuming an illegal purpose, such
a purpose would be attributable to Mr Sharif, not to Niko.

1578. In conclusion, in the Tribunals’ view, the record shows that Stratum was
set up by Mr Sharif for his work for Niko and for his own reasons. The
Tribunals find no evidence to show that Stratum was set up for the
purposes of Niko’s alleged scheme of corruption. The fact that the
agreements for the provision of Mr Sharif’s services to Niko and for his
remuneration by Niko were concluded not with him personally but with
his company Stratum, in the opinion of the Tribunals, does not support
the allegation of a corrupt intention by Niko.

10.3.3.3 The engagement of Sharif/ Stratum as a “layer” in Niko’s
alleged corrupt scheme

1579. The Tribunals consider that the discussion about Stratum as a “dummy
corporation” distracts from the relevant issue that must be considered
here: are the agreements concluded by Niko with Mr Sharif’s company
evidence of “layering’, as suggested by the Respondents and the
Investigators, and does the conclusion of these agreement support the
allegation of Niko’s intention to create a corrupt scheme? If that is not
the case, the Tribunals will then have to consider whether, in fact, Niko
used its cooperation with Mr Sharif and his company for procuring by
corruption the JVA and the GPSA.

1108 Tr. Day 3 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 196, 1. 17 to p.197, 1. 19.

451

1580. In the Claimant’s view, Mr Sharif and his company were, until the
commencement of operational activities following the conclusion of the
JVA, “Niko’s sole permanent presence in Bangladesh and the cornerstone
of its activities’.11°9 As mentioned above, the Respondents and the
Investigators deem the engagement of consultants to be evidence for
corruption.

1581. The Respondents assimilate the engagement of Niko’s consultants with
a “modus operand?’ described by the Investigators:

As Mr. Khan and Special Agent LaPrevotte explain in their statements,
the U.S., Canadian, and Bangladeshi investigations of corruption in
Bangladesh found several companies using the same methods:
“hiring of so-called consultants to funnel money to the sons of the
Prime Minister and the minister with authority to approve or deny
their contract proposals.”

The evidence shows that Niko used this system to illegally seek its
own advantage by paying bribes to obtain the JVA and GPSA and left
its own perverse influence on Bangladeshi society.!11°

1582. The engagement of Sharif/Stratum by Niko, in the view of the
Respondents, is part of the same modus operandi:

... Niko’s use of consultants to carry out its corruption began when it
entered the country and hired Sharfudding Ahmed in 1997 and
Qasim Sharif in 1998. Qasim Sharif and his company, Stratum
Developments Ltd., were the center of Niko’s corrupt transactions in
Bangladesh after the relationship with Sharfudding Ahmed
soured, 1111

1583. Mr Khan described the layering system he had observed with other
companies and then concluded that Sharif/Stratum were used by Niko
as such a layer:

During the BNP’s reign between 2001 and January 2007, the most
substantial evidence of Niko’s bribe payments that we uncovered
followed the same pattern as those paid by Siemens, China Harbour,
Harbin and other companies. Niko used arrangements with
“consultants” to pay bribes to government officials and their family

1109 C-CMC, paragraph 193.
1110 R-MC, paragraphs 57 and 58.
1111 R-MC, paragraph 65.

452

members. The evidence demonstrated that Niko entered into the type
of layered “consultancy” arrangement often used by corrupt
companies to attempt to distance the company and its home-office
from the corruption.

The first layer of Niko’s arrangement were contracts with Qasim
Sharif and his company Stratum. Niko contracted with Qasim Sharif
to pay him what was by Bangladeshi standards an astronomical
success fee of a minimum of $4,000,000 if he was able to procure the
Chattak/Feni project for them.!112

1584. The Claimant objects to the Respondents’ attempt to categorise “Qasim

Sharif and Stratum as a mere conduit for bribes to officials”. They state

Throughout the more than five year period commencing with Niko’s
submission of the July 1998 Proposal and ending with the execution
of the JVA, Qasim Sharif, through Stratum, was Niko’s sole
permanent presence in Bangladesh and the cornerstone of its
activities. Subsequently, just prior to the execution of the JVA, Qasim
Sharif became Niko’s President until his departure from the company
in late 2005.1113

1585. The Tribunals have concluded that, in the circumstances of Niko in

1586.

Bangladesh, the engagement of consultants is not evidence in itself that
bribery was intended or committed. One of the questions that does have
to be examined is whether the consultants that Niko did engage were
qualified for the task to justify the agreed compensation for their services
or, as the Respondents argue, were engaged merely as a conduit for
passing bribes from Niko to officials without Niko appearing.

Concerning Sharif/Stratum, the Respondents contest the qualifications
of Stratum as a separate entity, a “dummy corporation”, as just discussed;
but do not discuss the qualifications of Mr Sharif.

1587. According to the Claimant, Mr Sharif had been

. employed as a senior oil and gas executive for one of the world’s
largest oilfield service companies, BJ Services. Mr. Sharif had held

positions with BJ Services as a Country Manager in several
jurisdictions in the South Asia Region, including India.!114

The Claimant explains that Mr Sharif, a dual Bangladesh and U.S.
citizen!!1!5 (born in Bangladesh, relocated in the U.S. in 1979),1116 was at
the origin of the “concept of pursuing marginal field development in
Bangladesh, with the knowledge he undoubtedly had of Bangladesh and
potential marginal fields”.'!!17 Immediately prior to working for Niko he
had spent years as a Country Manager for a leading international oil and
gas services company across various jurisdictions, including in South
Asia.!!18 In the Agreed Statement of Facts the expected role of Mr Sharif
is described as follows:

Although Qasim Sharif is an American citizen, he is also a
Bangladeshi and it was expected that his background would be such
that he would have had the expertise to navigate the often complex
relationship of business and government officials which existed in
Bangladesh at the time. In 2005 Bangladesh was tied as the most
corrupt country in the world in which to do business according to
Transparency International.!119

It is not seriously contested that Mr Sharif was highly qualified for
assisting Niko in the promotion of its project in Bangladesh. Reference to
his qualifications has been made above.

The modus operandi described by Ms LaPrevotte included the use of
consultants with “no expertise in the relevant fields’.!12° In cross
examination she clarified her position, recognising the qualifications of
Mr Sharif:

MR COLE: You are implying here that these consultants did not
provide any legitimate services, correct?

MS LAPREVOTTE: I am saying that none of them were -- with the
possible exception of [Mr Sharif], had any background in oil
exploration. One was an insurance agent and a travel agent and one
of them now runs a soccer club. They had no expertise that would

have assisted Niko but they were all well familially and politically
connected with the BNP Government.

MR COLE: In your statement you do not qualify that. You do not offer
or concede the expertise of [Mr Sharif], do you?

MS LAPREVOTTE: I do not believe I do.

MR COLE: Do you accept that he provided substantial legitimate
services to Niko?

MS LAPREVOTTE: I think that he was qualified to be an agent for
Niko. He had extreme expertise in the oil industry.!!21

1591. Ms LaPrevotte also stated that, contrary to what she had observed in the
case of Siemens, Mr Sharif provided legitimate services to Niko and was
entitled to compensation:

MS LAPREVOTTE: I would say he provided some legitimate service,
yes.

MR COLE: But that is a difference between Siemens and Niko.

MS LAPREVOTTE: Yes.

[...]
MS LAPREVOTTE: Yes, he is entitled to compensation. 1122

1592. Mr Khan explained that the layering system of corruption, on which the
Respondents rely, was part of the corruption prevailing during “BNP’s
reign between 2001 and January 2007.”!123 The agreements of Niko with
Sharif/Stratum were concluded in 1999, over two years before the
installation of the BNP government. It is therefore not plausible for the
Respondents and the Investigators to associate these agreements with
corrupt schemes said to have been set up during the BNP government’s
tenure.

1593. Apart from this asserted analogy, the Respondents produce no evidence
that the Sharif/Stratum agreements were concluded for purposes of
layering. The Respondents imply that Mr Sharif understood that his

mandate was to pay bribes to officials. They describe the special Power of
Attorney granted to Mr Sharif in April 1998 and then state:

Qasim Sharif understood his mandate. As he told the Canadian
investigators, “there was money |...] that [was] suppose/d] to go to
officials or that went to officials. ”!12+

The attribution of these words to Mr Sharif is incorrect. In support of
their statement, the Respondents refer to the transcript of Mr Sharif’s
questioning by the RCMP. The text of this transcript shows that the
quoted words are not those of Mr Sharif but of Corporal Duggan.
Moreover, Corporal Duggan does not summarise what he heard from Mr
Sharif but what he heard when talking to “several people who were
involved in the process that led to getting the JVA”, mentioning Sharfuddin
Ahmed, Salim [Bhuiyan] and Mamoon. The discussion then proceeds:

DUGGAN: Urn, now each of these people say that there was money....
SHARIF: ....uh-huh....

DUGGAN: ....that's suppose to go to officials or that went to officials.
SHARIF: Uh-huh

DUGGAN: And if you kind, we're trying to figure out ah, where that
came, where the idea came from and how it was carried out and.

SHARIF: So let's talk about MAMOON.!125

In the view of the Tribunals, this exchange does not offer evidence for Mr
Sharif’s understanding of his mandate and does not support the
Respondents’ assertion that the Sharif/Stratum agreements were
concluded as part of a layering scheme through which Niko intended to
pay bribes by distancing itself from its corruption.

The Tribunals conclude that Niko’s engagement of Sharif/Stratum had
a good reason and legitimate purposes. There is no evidence to justify
the Respondents’ allegation that its objective was illicit layering in
pursuance of a corrupt scheme.

This conclusion does not exclude the possibility that the terms of the
agreements and in particular the remuneration provided by Niko were
out of proportion with the services to be provided under the agreements
and/or that the agreements were used later, during the BNP reign, for
corrupt payments by Niko through Sharif/Stratum. The Tribunals will
now examine the evidence in this respect.

10.3.3.4 The terms of the Sharif/Stratum engagement as red flags for
corruption

As mentioned, the Tribunals’ acceptance that Niko’s engagement of
Sharif/Stratum was not a case of layering, in the sense used by the
Respondents and the Investigators, does not exclude that corruption was
carried out through this relationship. The Tribunals have found that the
Sharif/Stratum engagement was for a legitimate purpose and that Mr
Sharif’s qualifications justified remuneration. That leaves open the
question whether the remuneration was out of proportion with the
services that he was expected to provide.

The Respondents assert that Mr Sharif received “vast sums of money from
Niko” and that the Claimant “failed to show that its payments to Stratum
and Qasim Sharif were legitimate”.'12© The Respondents consider the
amounts agreed and paid as exorbitant, and in particular describe the
payment of US$4 million due on conclusion of the JVA as a “stratospheric
success fee” .1127

The Tribunals will therefore examine whether the amounts which Niko
agreed to pay to Sharif/Stratum are such that they give rise to doubt
about the legitimacy of the services expected in return. To be clear, it
is not the purpose of such an examination to determine the consultant’s
adequate remuneration; the examination merely has to determine
whether there is such a discrepancy between the remuneration and the
services to be rendered which suggests that at least part of the amounts
paid are intended for corrupt payments.

10.3.3.5 Compensation compared to services - as agreed

1601. Based on the record, the agreed payments are known as follows and
were indicated above in the summary of the agreements:

e A payment for start-up costs of US$50,000;

e A monthly Management Fee of US$40,000, reduced to
US$20,000 as of 1 April 2001, and again increased to US$30,000
as of 1 November 2005;

e A share in Niko’s interest in the proven net share of established
proven reserves, but a minimum of US$4 million upon conclusion
of the JVA, from which amount any Management Fees actually
paid had to be deducted; and

e A profit share, as described above, pursuant to the Carried
Interest Agreement.

1602. The services for which this remuneration was provided were defined in
the Consultancy Agreement, which required Stratum to

(1) assist the Company in conducting research and due diligence in
relation to the JVA; in gathering general and technical data and
information; in facilitating all meetings in relation to the execution of
the JVA; and in assisting the Company in negotiating and executing
the JVA;

(2) act on behalf of the Company, as requested, with respect to
negotiating and furnishing information to BAPEX and the Government
of Bangladesh as required by BAPEX and the Government of
Bangladesh to facilitate the approval process in relation to the JVA;

(3) pay, on behalf of the Company, any good faith deposit required to
be paid on account of the execution of the JVA, from monies made
available to the Consultant by the Company; and

(4) provide such information as could be reasonably required to assist
the Company in financing and structuring of the execution of the
JVA. 1128

1603. The quoted description of the expected services has a broad scope and
may well have required extensive work and costs born by Stratum. These

services go beyond advice and information which consultants often agree
to provide. They include an active role in representing Niko in its relations
with BAPEX and the Government.

It must also be borne in mind that the payments were not only the fee for
these services; according to the Management Agreement, they also
covered “all costs and expenses of Stratum including but not limited to
personnel, overhead, rent, material and supplies, vehicles, transportation,
taxes third party charges and insurance”.!!29 The agreements with
Stratum also provided that the consultant could retain third parties to
assist in performing the services; but that had to be done “without
charging any additional fees therefor” .113°

When considering the value of the agreed services the costs of any
alternatives must be borne in mind. As the above quoted observation
from the Senior Commercial Officer of the DFAIT show, the arrangement
with Fife Feathers does not seem to have provided adequate local support.
On 11 May 1998 he wrote

... Niko needs to be much more active on the ground here, both in
terms of senior executives from Calgary and through an effective local
partner/agent which can deal with the government and other
IOCs.1131

When assessing the value of the Sharif/Stratum services from the
perspective of Niko, one would have to consider the budget that would
have been necessary for a Canadian company having no experience in
Bangladesh to establish its own presence in order to pursue the project.
The costs of sending personnel (with expatriation benefits) and setting up
a local office for a period of years might well have been in the same order
as the amount Niko agreed to pay to Mr Sharif, or even more — without
counting the opportunity cost of losing the service of those personnel and
with no assurance of success.

Moreover, the explanations provided by the Claimant and Mr Sharif
indicate that Mr Sharif played an important role in the development of
the concept and the project. He was therefore well placed in introducing

to the relevant authorities in Bangladesh the idea of developing
marginal/abandoned gas fields, as Niko had done with success in India.
As a recognised oil and gas specialist, familiar with the industry and with
Bangladesh, the Tribunals consider that it was more than plausible that
he had credibility with these authorities in the presentation of the project.

1608. The Respondents qualify the amounts due to Sharif/Stratum as “huge
sums of money” and add:

That monthly payment was around 10 times the annual salary of a
BAPEX or Petrobangla official at the time. In fact, that monthly
payment was more than four times the annual salary of the Prime
Minister of Bangladesh in 2015. This provided Qasim Sharif with
huge sums of cash to be used to obtain the JVA. Considering that
Niko paid Mr. Sharif’s home and office rent and Niko had no
operations whatsoever in Bangladesh at this time, it is hard to see
what use would be made of this money other than to pay bribes.1152

1609. The Claimant corrected this statement by pointing out that, according to
an express provision of the Management Agreement, the agreed fee had
to cover all costs of Stratum.!133

1610. The Claimant also questioned the relevance of a comparison with salaries
in Bangladesh. The Respondents then compared the Sharif/Stratum
compensation with the salaries of oil and gas workers at an international
level, stating:

In 2010, more than a decade after the original Stratum agreement,
the average annual salary for permanently staffed foreign laborers in
the oil and gas industry in India was $77,800, and worldwide, oil
and gas workers with “20+” years of experience in “Business
development” earned average salaries of $126,600.1134

1611. The Respondents also questioned that Mr Sharif, before he left his prior
employment, “was accustomed” to compensation on the level of that
offered by Niko. In support, the Respondents present a document stating
that Mr Sharif of BJ Services Company Middle East was assessed for the

1132 R-MC, paragraph 66.

year 2000-2001 on a declared income of Taka 458,640 (according to the
Respondents corresponding to US$1,200).1135

1612. The Claimant discussed the various examples which the Respondents
presented for comparison with the payments agreed with
Sharif/Stratum. With respect to the Bangladesh tax return, it states that
the document is of questionable value on a number of counts and cannot
be taken as reflecting the full income of Mr Sharif. The Claimant points
out that Mr Sharif had a residence in Texas and had his last employment
with BJ Services in India, implying that he would have been paying taxes
on what he earned in India.!!36

1613. On this subject Mr Adolph testified:

Based on my substantial personal experience as an expatriate
Country Manager, including from around the same time period in
which Mr. Sharif was performing an apparently similar function for
BJ Services, the suggestion that Qasim Sharif was paid a total of
$1,200 per month by BJ Services as an expatriate Country Manager
is, to put it politely, completely at odds with the reality of the
international oil and gas business. 1137

1614. Similarly, the Claimant contested the comparison with data from the
2010 Oil & Gas Global Salary Guide, questioning the choice of categories
and applications. !138 It referred to the testimony of Mr Adolph:

In my personal industry experience, an expatriate working for a
substantial North American Company as a Country Manager would
expect to receive a remuneration package of a minimum of USD
$250,000, but in many cases it would be at least double that,
depending of the size of the company and the jurisdiction in which it
was headquartered. To illustrate, after several years of growth, from
2009 onwards Niko Canada’s Country Manager in India was
receiving a remuneration package worth well over USD $500,000. On
the other end, when I started as Country Manager with Niko in
Bangladesh, I estimate that my total remuneration package was

worth somewhere in the region of USD $250,000 to $300,000. I would
also note that as Country Manager for Bangladesh, my role was
technically subordinate to Qasim Sharif, who was President of Niko
at the time.1139

1615. In a more general manner, the Claimant distinguishes the payments
agreed in the present case from those in the Spentex case by pointing out
that in that case the claimant had failed to disclose the existence of
consulting contracts and failed to produce documents despite repeated
requests. In contrast, Niko not only disclosed the consultancy
agreements and complied with the Tribunals’ production orders. It also
had published contemporaneously in its 2004 annual information form,
available to the public, details of its material payments to consultants.
The Claimant also pointed to the lack of qualifications of the consultants
and the absence of evidence of services provided by the Spentex
consultants. !140

1616. The Claimant also asserts that the agreed compensation was “in line with
industry practice”. In support, the Claimant refers in particular to the
expert report of Mr Moyes and his explanations at the Hearing. In that
report, Mr Moyes states the “services provided by Mr Sharif, through
Stratum, were significantly greater than a typical in-country advisor and
went on for a significantly greater period than is typical’.!!41 With respect
to the services actually provided by Mr Sharif, he relies entirely on
assumptions which he had not verified.!!42 The verification of these
assumptions will be addressed by the Tribunals below. If one accepts,
however, the description of the services as a correct representation, Mr
Moyes explanations are a useful contribution. He states:

His central role as Niko’s sole presence in Bangladesh and
management of all of its activities in Bangladesh, including the direct
conduct of extensive substantive and regular communications (written
and oral), technical presentations, and negotiations with numerous
representatives of BAPEX, Petrobangla and the government, are
functions that exceed the general role of a typical in-country
advisor. 1143

p. 74); also in cross examination (p. 76).

1143 Moyes Expert Report, paragraph 51 (b).

462

1617. The Respondents and the Investigators have not contested this
statement, nor the observation that this broad scope of services reflects
the general and valuable role of an in-country executive and advisor. Mr
Moyes also points out another aspect of Mr Sharif’s contribution:

Additionally, the fact the pursuit of marginal field development in
Bangladesh was a concept developed by him and provided to Niko
must also be considered in understanding his remuneration package.
It is common practice in the industry for those who develop a play,
concept or project to obtain a carried interest of some nature (often in
addition to other remuneration), in particular where they then play a
material role in carrying out the project. The remuneration package of
Stratum is entirely consistent with industry practices and norms.!144

1618. Here again, Mr Moyes cannot provide any evidence about Mr Sharif’s role
in the development of the project; what he describes as “the fact” is, on
his side, a mere assumption. The Claimant has referred to this role and
Mr Sharif has described it in his interview by the RCMP;!145 it has not
been questioned in the Arbitrations. The Tribunals have no reason to
doubt that Mr Sharif did in fact play an important role in the development
of the project. The explanations of Mr Moyes concerning industry practice
appear plausible. In Bangladesh the idea of marginal/abandoned gas
fields was new and Mr Sharif had pointed this out to Niko. He could
explain to the relevant authorities in Bangladesh that Niko was in a
position to develop them. Those parts of the Sharif/Stratum
remuneration which provide for a share in future profits can be taken as
a confirmation that Mr Sharif was not simply a consultant but made
contributions which could justify that he be granted an interest in the
success of the project.

1619. When considering this compensation, the monthly Management Fee
must be seen in the context of the overall compensation package, the
elements of which have been presented above. The central parts of this
package are two provisions granting Stratum a share in the results of the
project: the Carried Interest Agreement and the Consultancy Fee under
the Consultancy Contract. With respect to the latter a Minimum Initial
Consulting Fee of US$4 million was to be paid upon the conclusion of the

1144 Moyes Expert Report, paragraph 51 (b).
1145 Exhibit R-333; see also Mr Sharif’s statement to the ACC, attached to e-mail chain from Brian Adolph,
15 March 2008, Exhibit C-176, p. 9.

1622.

JVA; but “all monies paid under the Management Services Contract” would
be deducted from it.1!46 The monthly Management Fee can thus be seen
as an advance on this initial consulting fee, except that, if no JVA was
concluded, the monthly fees were lost for Niko. The Consultancy Fee itself
consisted of a share in the project, expressed as US$0.03 per mcf of
Niko’s “net share of established proven reserves based on an independent
engineering report ...” Annual payments for increases in Niko’s net share
in the proven reserves were also foreseen.!!47

Such a fee arrangement is quite different from those described by the
Respondents and the Investigators as typical for the corruption in
Bangladesh. The Tribunals must consider its specificity when examining
whether the fees are out of proportion with the services to be provided.
This requires that the share granted to Sharif/Stratum be considered and
the US$4 million of the initial consultancy fee and not simply the
amounts payable as monthly Management Fees.

The Claimant discusses the “proportionality of Stratum’s fees [...] in the
context of the potential value of the project’ and concludes that this value
“was orders of magnitude larger than the Stratum fees”. In support of this
assertion, the Claimant takes the “remaining, recoverable, and risked and
probable gas reserves of the Chattak and Feni fields, as assessed in the
Marginal Fields Evaluation at 319 BCF, and quantifies this volume at three
possible prices for the gas (US$1.75/mef, $2.25mcf and 2.70mcf), leading
to a total revenue estimates of US$558.25 million, US$717.75 million and
US$ 861.3 million, respectively. Niko’s share in this revenue would be
between 50% and 80%, depending on the applicable investment
multiple.” 1148

The Respondents have not contested this calculation. Indeed, they have
quantified the loss to the Chattak field alone from the blowouts by

1146 Consultancy Agreement between Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. And Stratum Developments Limited,
1999, 2000, 2002, 2003, Exhibit R-315, Clause 6. The Respondents mischaracterize this provision by
asserting that the payment of US$4 million was in addition to the monthly fee payments (R-RC, paragraph
134: “And the monthly payment was not all: the Stratum agreements included additional promised payments
in terms of a success fee of at least $4 million or more based on $.03 per MCF of Niko’s share of proven
reserves’).

amounts of similar magnitude.!!49 They have, however, not addressed the
valuation of the Sharif/Stratum services by reference to the value of the
project. Apart from characterising the initial consultancy fee as high,
“stratospheric” or by similar terms as excessive, the Respondents have
not presented any other calculation that would place the agreed fees in
proportion to the value of the services provided by Sharif/Stratum; nor
have the Investigators.

Without verifying in detail the Claimant’s calculation of Niko’s potential
revenue from the project, the Tribunals consider it a useful approach to
an examination of proportionality. In the absence of any contrary or
alternative demonstration, they find the Claimant’s conclusion in this
respect as plausible. They have nevertheless examined attentively and in
detail the Respondents’ arguments and demonstrations relating to the
monthly Management Fee.

Concerning the comparison of this monthly fee with the compensation
which Mr Sharif received at his previous employment and which he gave
up for his work for Niko, the Tribunals do not find it reasonable to assume
that this compensation was US$1,200, but rather part of a package
reflecting work in more than one country. They did not find the
Respondents’ assertion in this respect as very helpful and accept Mr
Adolph’s observation as quoted above. Similarly, the comparative
amounts of compensation for different oil and gas workers do not appear
as relating to activities that are comparable to that of Mr Sharif in the
given circumstance.

The Tribunals have considered the testimony of Ms _ LaPrevotte
concerning Mr Sharif’s remuneration. They noted that she considered Mr
Sharif as “qualified to be an agent for Niko” and that he had “extreme
expertise in the oil industry”.!15° She nevertheless found his remuneration
“high” 1151 but did not make any sustained attempt to determine with
particularity whether the remuneration was disproportionate to the
services he agreed to provide. Instead she considered the consultants
globally:

Report.

I was looking at how much were the Niko consultants paid and you
can pull out [Mr Sharif] but I looked at all of the Niko consultants and
Ican tell you by looking at the next consultant, Selim Bhuiyan, he was
paid $10,000 a month. He is a Bangladeshi in Bangladesh where
the Minister's salary was $6,000 per year at the same time Mr
Bhuiyan was being paid $10,000 per month and so I did not pick and
choose whose salaries I looked at. I looked at the totality of the
payments to the Niko consultants and found them high.1152

1626. In other words, when assessing the legitimacy of Niko’s agreements with
consultants, Ms LaPrevotte amalgamated the engagement in 1998/1999
of Niko’s principal in-country representative and the subsequent
engagement of an additional consultant. The agreements providing for
the engagement and for the compensation of Mr Bhuiyan were concluded
in 2003, after the BNP Government had come to power in late 2001. It is
questionable to assess the legitimacy of Niko’s engagement of its principal
representative in 1998/1999 in a sort of global assessment without
distinguishing between the different consultants - amalgamating it with
those of a different consultant engaged in 2003, in circumstances which,
in the Respondents’ own explanations, had fundamentally changed by
the arrival of a Government of which Ms LaPrevotte herself described the
corrupt character, calling it a Kleptocracy.!153

1627. Similar amalgamations are made by Mr Khan and the Respondents
themselves who systematically refer to the Bhuiyan/Nationwide
agreements and the surrounding circumstances. The Tribunals are of the
view that the agreements which Niko concluded in 1998/1999 with
Sharif/Stratum for its principal in-country representative must be clearly
distinguished from those concluded some five years later with Mr
Bhuiyan and Nationwide. The Tribunals do not consider it admissible to
impute corruptive intent to Niko in 1998/1999 by reference to much later
acts in very different circumstances. The Respondents’ amalgamation of
the Sharif/Stratum agreements and the Bhuiyan/Nationwide
agreements is all the less admissible as the Respondents have
emphasised the difference in the political situation during the Awami
League and the BNP government. The Respondents have insisted heavily
on the system of corruption under the BNP government. One may not
assess the legitimacy of earlier agreements as if Niko had anticipated the
installation of this system more than two years later.

1628. For this reason, the Tribunals consider it important that the
Sharif/Stratum agreements of 1998/1999 be examined separately from
those concluded by Niko in later years during the BNP regime.

1629. In view of these considerations, Ms LaPrevotte’s examination,
amalgamating Niko’s agreements, and other similar arguments by the
Respondents and Mr Khan, are not helpful to the Tribunals for
determining whether the agreed Sharif/Stratum compensation is
disproportionate to the services they agreed to provide.

1630. The Tribunals are not persuaded that the compensation agreed in
1999 by Niko in the _ Sharif/Stratum agreements was
disproportionate to the services to be provided and thus must serve
as a red flag for corruption.

10.3.3.6 Compensation compared to services - actual

1631. The Tribunals have verified whether their conclusion concerning the
proportionality of services and compensation warrant revision in light of
the services actually provided and the payments made as compensation.
This required an examination whether the services actually provided were
indeed as important as the description in the agreements indicates and
the payments actually made were in line with these agreements.

1632. Concerning the payments actually made by Niko to Sharif/Stratum, it
is uncontested that in October 2003, Niko paid Stratum US$2.93
million.!154 The Annual Information Form of Niko Canada, filed with the
applicable Canadian securities regulator,!155 states the following:

In October, 2003, Niko paid Stratum, under the terms of the consulting
arrangement, an advance on the above fee of US$2.93 million, being

US$4.0 million less the aggregate amount of the monthly fees paid by
Niko to Stratum since its retainer in 1999,1156

The Respondents agreed that the attribution of the October 2003
payment occured as described. They noted the payment made by Niko on
21 October 2003 and explained that this “$2.93 million was the remaining
portion of the promised $4 million ‘Consultancy Fee’ to Stratum”.1157

The Respondents however present a different calculation by reference to
the payments made from Niko’s account to Stratum, as shown in Ms
LaPrevotte’s table (the “Spider Web”). They assert that “Niko paid almost
US$5 million to Stratum and Qasim Sharif’.1158 The amount is explained
as follows:

In the Payments Chart, Respondents show that Niko paid more than
US$ 4.9 million into the UBP bank accounts of Stratum and Qasim
Sharif between October 1999 and 10 February 2006.!159

The difference between the US$4.9 million and the US$4 million
pursuant to the Consultancy Agreement is due largely to the fact that the
Respondents’ calculation includes payments following the conclusion of
the JVA, between November 2003 and February 2006 and, during the
period before, some payments which seem to be additional to the monthly
Management Fee. A precise reconciliation of the amounts has not been
provided; but, for the present exercise, the Tribunals take it that US$4
million were paid by Niko for the work until the conclusion of the JVA
and that the balance quoted by the Respondents (“more than US$ 4.9
million” or “almost US$5 million”) include services provided thereafter.

As will be discussed in the following section, Mr Sharif also applied part
of the compensation he received upon completion of the JVA to the
payment of Mr Bhuiyan and his company Nationwide, who were engaged
by Niko but treated as subcontractors to Sharif/Stratum.

1637. The Tribunals see no indication that the payments actually received by
Sharif/Stratum from Niko for achieving the JVA exceeded the amounts
agreed in 1999.

1638. Concerning the services actually provided by Sharif/Stratum, the
Claimant asserts that the “evidence clearly establishes that the fees paid
to Stratum under the Consultancy and Management Services Agreement
were proportionate having regard to the amount and value of the work
expected of and duly performed by Stratum”.!!6° Concerning these
services, the Claimant states:

... the evidentiary record is replete with examples of the extensive
work Mr. Sharif/ Stratum performed in relation to the JVA. This work
included attending virtually all meetings with the Respondents and
the Government of Bangladesh, as well as conducting substantial
written correspondence (including of a technical nature), and
engaging with the Canadian High Commission in Bangladesh. In
essence, the record establishes that Stratum performed two roles for
Niko in connection with the procurement of the JVA: first, the role of
“in-country manager” — i.e. as the primary or sole in-country day-to-
day point of contact for the government (including Petrobangla and
BAPEX), and for all other third parties in connection with the project;
and second, the role of “in-country advisor” — i.e. providing lobbying
and government relations advisory services and related logistical
support, such as the facilitation of meetings with key government
representatives. 1161

1639. Mr Sharif explained in the RCMP interrogation the division of
responsibilities between him and Mr Hornaday:

SHARIF: Well Bill HORNADAY was in charge basically he was
operationally, operationally so when we got started with this Bob
made it very clear to me that Qasim you will handle all the permits
and making sure that, that you know we can get to work. [...] So it
was very clear you know that, that Bill would run the operations and
I would do the liaising with the government making sure that all the
finer issues in the country were, were not ah, you know we have
certain regulations you have to follow you have to get all the permits
and all those things, there were environmental issues, there’s you
know. 1162

469

SHARIF: _ A lot of issues, you know that was my area.
DUGGAN: So you brought the Bangladeshi expertise essentially?
SHARIF:  Yes.1163

1640. The Respondents refer to the Claimant’s quotations from the Stratum
agreements and the description of certain activities, such as “evaluations
and advice on exploration, development and production of petroleum,”
“prepare studies, survey, and other programs for transportation and
marketing,” “provide, by secondment or otherwise, individuals to assist in
the conduct of operations,” and “maintain accounting records.” They
assert that “Stratum did none of this legitimate work” .!164

1641. In particular, the Respondents insist on the absence of evidence for the
alleged activities of Sharif/Stratum:

Niko has provided, for example, no communications between Stratum
and Niko discussing legitimate work: no progress reports, meeting
minutes, budgets, or any indication of a normal business relationship
with Niko. Indeed, either Mr. Sharif almost never communicated with
Niko, or Niko considered such communications unhelpful to its case.
Notably, there is no record of any discussion of the deal with Mr.
Bhuiyan. The only communication Niko provided is a suspicious 1998
e-mail from Mr. Sharif, then Niko’s agent, forwarding comments that
should only have been exchanged between Petrobangla and the
Ministry.1165

1642. With respect to the Claimant’s assertion that Mr Sharif’s 2002 bank
statements “reflect multiple payments associated with the ordinary
expenses of maintaining an office and fulfilling Stratum’s role’, the
Respondents reply:

Niko mentions payments for travel, internet service, security, phone,
insurance, and a golf tournament totalling about US$ 2000, and
provides no evidence they had to do with Stratum’s work for Niko.

1168 Sharif Transcript, Exhibit R-333, p. 12, ll. 432-436.
1164 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 10.
1165 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 11.

470

These payments could be Mr. Sharif’s personal expenses, as there is
no indication that Stratum even had an office in 2002.1166

1643. When contesting the legitimacy of the US$4 million payment to Mr Sharif,
the Respondents point out that “Niko’s witnesses claim no knowledge of
what he might have done to earn so much” .1167

1644. The Tribunals note that Mr Hornaday joined Niko Canada in 2001 as Vice
President, International Operations. His main responsibilities during the
period up to the signing of the JVA were primarily in connection with
Niko’s operations in India. He added, however, that he was made aware
of key developments in Bangladesh and made “occasional visits there from
2001 to 2004”.1168 Mr Adolph explained that he had not been involved in
any negotiations relating to the JVA and “indeed had no involvement in
matters relating to Bangladesh until [he] was appointed as Country
Manager at the end of 2004”.1169

1645. The Tribunals also note that, when the production of documentary
evidence was considered in the Arbitrations, the emphasis with respect
to Niko was on payments made by Niko and Niko Canada in Bangladesh.
The Tribunals therefore gave special instructions in Procedural Order No
15 concerning Financial Records.

1646. The evidence which the Respondents had requested since May 2016, with
respect to the production of which the Tribunals gave directions in
Procedural Order No 15 and at other occasions, was however much
broader and included “communications dated between 2001-2003
regarding negotiations and signing of the JVA, and dated from 2004-2006
regarding negotiation and finalisation of the GPSA, between Niko
Resources Ltd. its affiliates, its officers or its agents” and several persons
including in particular Mr Sharif.!!7° While the Tribunals shared the
Claimant’s view that the Respondents document production requests
were “overbroad”, they nevertheless recognised the relevance of the
directions sought by this request and made clear in Procedural Order No
14 that they wished to “proceed along the lines indicated in the

Respondents’ request’. In any event, it was in the Claimant’s interest to
provide evidence for the legitimacy of the activity of Sharif/Stratum,
including for instance any relevant reports which Mr Sharif may have
produced.

Examining the documentary evidence produced, the Tribunals note that,
since 2000, almost all correspondence in Bangladesh is signed by Mr
Sharif and the correspondence to Niko is addressed to him. Where there
are records of meetings, they also show Mr Sharif’s attendance,
occasionally together with Mr Hornaday.!!71 A rare exception seems to
have been the meeting on 22 April 2003 where Mr Sharif could not attend
(“due to pre-occupation”) and Niko was represented by Mr Gazi
Nuruzzaman Babul.!172

The Tribunals also note the message of Mr Sharif of 13 November 1998,
in which the reports on the progress of the project and communicates
Petrobangla’s comments on it.!!73 This report reflects communications
and the gathering of information on actions of BAPEX, Petrobangla and
the Ministry as well as on developments of other petroleum projects in
Bangladesh; and it provides advice for further action and planning. This
information and advice no doubt required substantial work on the side
of Mr Sharif, and significant interventions which replaced costly trips of
executives from Canada or elsewhere.

There is, however, in the record no similar report for subsequent work by
Mr Sharif. In his RCMP interrogation Mr Sharif explained that “most of
[his] discussions were with Bob [Ohlsonj’ and “on some occasions with Ed
[Sampson] and not so much but ah, and it was Bob’s role to talk to
everybody’; after 2004, communications were with Ed Sampson. Mr
Sharif also explained that communications with the head office were
“mostly on the phone with Ed some emails”.1174

The Tribunals find it surprising that there should be no written traces
about these communications, no reports on Mr Sharif’s activity on the
progress of the JVA negotiations and other events relevant to Niko’s

1171 See e.g, Minutes of the Meeting to Finalize the JVA between BAPEX Negotiating Committee and Niko

project and activity, as this had been provided in the message of 13
November 1998. This is yet another example of the gaps in this otherwise
voluminous record - surprising gaps in the evidence produced by both
sides in these Arbitrations, as were noted at repeated occasions by the
Tribunals.

1651. The evidence that was produced, however, does show, in relation with the
Respondents and the Government, the sustained presence of Mr Sharif
as Niko’s in-country representative, not only in a formal manner but also
to address in detail the complex issues of substance which arose in the
negotiations. The Tribunals see as examples the Minutes of the 25 June
2001 meeting,!!75 mentioned already, the letter to BAPEX of 8 July
2002,!!76 the letters to the State Minister of 30 July,!!77 10 August!!78
and 15 September 2002!!79 and the letter to the State Minister of 3 March
2003.!189 Indeed even Mr Chowdhury testified that Mr Sharif contacted
him during his brief tenure at the Ministry.!!8! As will be discussed in
the following section, Mr Sharif also assumed the payment out of the
US$4 million compensation of Mr Bhuiyan and his company, Nationwide.

1652. In view of the evidence relating to Mr Sharif’s activity in Bangladesh and
his compensation, the Tribunals are not persuaded that the services
actually provided by Sharif/Stratum were substantially different from
those for which compensation had been agreed and disproportionate to
the compensation he actually received.

1653. Generally on the allegation of the Sharif/Stratum contracts as a case of
“layering”, the Tribunals found the engagement of Mr Sharif and his
company Stratum as a reasonable business decision, quite remote
from the modus operandi which the Respondents and the Investigators
described under that label.

10.3.4 Nationwide, Salim Bhuiyan and Giasuddin Al-Mamoon

 

1654. The third consultant engaged by Niko was Nationwide Company Limited,
a Bangladeshi company represented by Mr Salim Bhuiyan. The
Respondents allege that Niko also engaged Mr Giasudding Al-Mamoon
and through him Mr Tarique Rahman, one of the sons of former Prime
Minister Zia. According to the Respondents, corrupt payments were
channelled through these channels to the State Minister and to the Prime
Minister. The Claimant accepts that it engaged Nationwide and Mr
Bhuiyan in June/July 2003 and states that it does not know of any other
contracts nor of any corrupt payments through them.

such agreement has been produced in the Arbitrations.

1189 C-CMC, paragraph 229.

... nearly 2002, Niko contacted Giasuddin al Mamoon and promised
to pay substantial “consultancy fees” in exchange for approval of the
JVA. Niko’s efforts and bribes were successful: it got the access it
wanted to the new Government, all outstanding issues were resolved
in its favor, and it was awarded the JVA without a competitive tender
in October 2003. 1199

Mr. Sharif admitted that he hired Giasuddin al Mamoon as a “super
lobbyist” to get the JVA and GPSA concluded. !19!

... In 2002, Mr Sharif made a deal with Giasudding al Mamoon....!19?

Mr Sharif [...] made the deal with Mr Mamoon to get the BNP
Government’s support ...1193

1666. The Respondents rely on Mr Khan’s statement:

[When interviewed by investigators, Mamoon confirmed that Qasim
Sharif sought him out to assist Niko to obtain the JVA and GPSA at a
time when the approval of the JVA was being withheld. 1194

1667. According to the Respondents, Niko concluded three agreements with Mr
Bhuiyan, in November 2002 and June and July 2003 and an “unwritten
agreement with Mr Mamoon in early 2002”.1195

1668. The Respondents summarise their position on the role of Mr Mamoon in
their Second Post-Hearing Submission:

In sum, Qasim Sharif made a “consultancy” agreement with Mr.
Mamoon, providing a retainer payment and $1,000,000 for the
execution of the JVA. Mr. Mamoon later put him in contact with Mr.
Bhuiyan, the State Minister intervened on Niko’s behalf, the JVA was
concluded with Chattak East, competition was avoided, and the first
$500,000 was paid and shared between Mr. Bhuiyan, Mr. Mamoon,
and the State Minister.1196

1669. The Claimant asserts that it has no knowledge about any involvement
of Mr Mamoon in connection with the JVA:

1192 R-MC, paragraph 74.

1195 R-RC, paragraph 9.

1196 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 25.

477

As Niko clearly stated in its First Post-Hearing Brief, Niko has no
knowledge of any discussions between Stratum/Qasim Sharif and
Giasuddin Al Mamoon in connection with the JVA. Similarly, while
Niko was fully aware of the engagement of Nationwide and the terms
of its remuneration, it has no knowledge of any purported
remuneration-sharing agreement between Nationwide/Mr. Bhuiyan
and Mr. Mamoon. In this regard, Niko again emphasizes that the only
“evidence” that such an agreement existed comes from unreliable
hearsay statements that cannot be properly explored or tested in
these proceedings. 1197

1670. The Respondents’ assertions concerning the role of Mr Mamoon rely (i)
on the transcripts of the explanations he provided when interrogated by
the RCMP on 1 and 2 November 2008!!%8 and (ii) on the transcript of Mr
Sharif’s interrogation.!!99 The involvement of Mr Mamoon is mentioned
also in Mr Bhuiyan’s subsequently withdrawn Confession!2°° and in the
report about his interrogation. !2°! For reasons of simplicity the Tribunals
refers to these three persons, Mr Sharif, Mr Mamoon, and Mr Bhuiyan,
as “witnesses”, while not forgetting the procedural reservations which
have been raised against them being treated as such.

1671. Mr Mamoon’s explanations are summarised by the Respondents as
follows:

Mr. Mamoon admitted in a videotaped interview with Canadian law
enforcement officers that Niko’s agent, Qasim Sharif, approached him
in early 2002 to enter into an arrangement and that they agreed that
Niko would pay him a monthly retainer of thousands of dollars and a
success fee of one million dollars to procure the JVA and GPSA for
Niko. He further admits that he then set out to obtain the approval of
Niko’s agreements, with the assistance of State Minister Mosharraf
Hossain. 1202

Mr. Mamoon told the RCMP that he entered into a “sub-agent
agreement” with Mr. Sharif to help Niko in 2002. Under the terms of
the agreement (which Niko has not disclosed), Mr. Mamoon was
promised a million dollars and a monthly retainer of $5,000 -
$10,000. After some months, seeing that it was going to be more
complicated than originally anticipated to get the JVA on the terms
Niko wanted, Mr. Mamoon directed Mr. Sharif to sign the Nationwide
agreement with Selim Bhuiyan. 1203

The Tribunals have verified the transcript of Mr Mamoon’s interrogation.
The transcript is difficult to understand. 12+ As the comparison with the
video tape!2°5 shows, this is due to a large extent to the evident difficulties
of Mr Mamoon to express himself in English. The Tribunals conclude
nevertheless that the summaries presented by the Respondents in the
above quotations reflect essential aspects of the transcript with respect
to Mr Mamoon’s and Mr Bhuiyan’s agreements with Niko as described by
Mr Mamoon. They remain, however, to be completed on a number of
points.

Considering the transcripts of the Mamoon interrogation in comparison
with the Sharif transcripts and the withdrawn Confession of Mr Bhuiyan,
the following picture emerges:

All three “witnesses” confirm that, prior to the agreement with Mr
Bhuiyan through Nationwide, Mr Sharif had been in contact with Mr
Mamoon and had made an agreement with him. The Mamoon transcript
is the most detailed in describing this relationship.

10.3.4.3 The explanations in the Mamoon Transcript

Mr Mamoon explains that, during the first quarter of 2002, a friend
brought him into contact with Mr Sharif.!2°6 When Mr Sharif presented

they don’t invest any, not a single penny”.'2°7 “If they’re getting gas, so
they'll share with our government, our government they don’t have invest
any single penny”. 1208

1676. Mr Mamoon was prepared to support the project with the State Minister
whom he knew well. !209

1677. Mr Mamoon first said that he made an agreement with Mr Sharif. He then
explained that, on his side the agreement was signed by Manzurul Islam,
whom he had known since 1993 or 1994.!210 The person also is referred
to as Moudoud Islam;!?!! Mr Mamoon clarified “Moudoud Islam on behalf
of me, Moudoud Islam signed agreement’. 1212

1678. Mr Mamoon first identified the other party to the agreement as Mr Sharif:
“Qasim Sharif and Manzurul Islam they are signing one agreement’.'218
When one of the interrogators asserted “you knew he was acting on behalf
of Niko. Right, did he tell you he was acting on behalf of Niko?”, Mr
Mamoon responded: “Yeah. Imean... um... see Vice-President or President
of Niko ...” and added “you know, he presented his Visiting Card”.!?14 Later
in the interrogation, Mr Mamoon stated: “that time me and my friend,
Moudoud Islam we’re, we’re the agent of Niko Resources Bangladesh
Limited” .1215

1679. The agreement between Mr Sharif and Mr Mamoon provided for a lump
sum which Mr Mamoon remembers as one million US Dollar and a
monthly retainer for two or three years.!2!6 Elsewhere reference is to

three or four years of a retainer and “I think five thousand UD dollar or ten
thousand I don’t know, I forget ...”.12!7 He did not specify when the
payment of this retainer would start.

Following this agreement Mr Mamoon went to the State Minister, Mr
Mosharraf Hossain. In the RCMP transcript the meeting is described as
follows:

So, this is good proposal. So I, I propose it to ah, Mosharraf.

[oJ

Moshahrraf, he after go through this ah, proposal you ah, ah, he was
also convinced yes, this is good project.!218

Later in the RCMP interrogation, Mr Mamoon developed the presentation:

So I went to Mosharraf because I, I know him very, very well and he’
Ss anice chap. And dynamic. So I went to Mosharraf then explain him
that this is a business proposal. If you help me then we can do this
business. Then af, after heard the proposal then he told yes, this is a
nice proposal. So you can try I can, Ican help you my ‘in legal process,
what, what do you need? After then ah, then ah, we told Qasim
SHARIF to ah, submit a proposal or something. Then I think Qasim
SHARIF submit the proposal.!219

The Respondents explain that, following the submission of the project to
the State Minister, “there was resistance form the former Finance Minister
and others stating ‘we need to do tender or something’, and the State
Minister told him it was difficult for the government to implement Niko’s
project, Mr Mamoon brought in Selim Bhuiyan ...” 1220

As he explained in the RCMP interrogation, Mr Mamoon waited for several
months but had no feedback and no progress was made on Niko’s project.
The State Minister’s assurance that he could “help” remained without
effect. Mr Mamoon noted that there was opposition to the project which

the State Minister could not overcome; he could “not do this thing’;122!
“no this project can not be happen”.!222 Mr Mamoon concluded that Mr
Mosharraf Hossain “tried but he failed”. 1225

Mr Mamoon does not have clear explanations about the reasons for this
failure. He was firm in declaring to the RCMP that the reason for the
failure was not a question of money:

KABIR:'224 Was there any problem with the negotiations or for the ...
MAMOON. ... no...

KABIR: ... money that means?

MAMOON: No, nothing, nothing. 1225

From the State Minister’s explanations Mr Mamoon seemed to conclude
that the State Minister’s inability to advance the project was due to
opposition in the administration. During the course of the interrogation,
Mr Mamoon gave a number of explanations pointing in this direction:

...I heard that time ah, some parties committee people, are, our ex ah,
Finance Minister they told no, we need ah, for this we are, we need
to do tender or something. !226

... bureaucratic people who were involved in ah, say Petrobangla
Ministry or ...1227

When he was questioned more specifically who had the influence “for
getting through the project’, the stated that it was the Ministry of Mr
Mosharraf Hossain; but before he could approve the case had to be vetted
by the purchase committee. He explained:

MAMOON.: ... eight or nine, senior minister they represent the.....

DUGGAN: Umn, he's got to be able to get that through and the Prime
minister heads that committee?

MAMOON: No. That committee headed by ah, our Finance Minister.
DUGGAN: She's not the senior member of the committee?

MAMOON: No, Finance Minister, our Finance Minister in Bangladesh
(indiscernible) Finance Minister he always chair the ah, purchase
committee meeting.

DUGGAN: So it's the Finance and the Law Minister has to approve the
contract legally, right vett [sic] it?

MAMOON: Ah, yes.
DUGGAN: Okay. !?28

When he understood that the State Minister would not succeed to get
“the project through”, Mr Mamoon lost interest: “then I silent”. 1229

So after two three months when I ah, when I get this feed back from
Mosharraf, then I think no, no, this, this can not be happen. So if I ah,
my give time to this project, time will be wasted. So then I totally
silent, 1230

and
I quit from this project ... not quit but was I was totally silent.'?31

Several months later, Mr Sharif and Mr Bhuiyan came to Mr Mamoon to
ask him whether he was still interested and, if he was not interested,
whether Mr Bhuiyan could take over the assignment. Mr Mamoon agreed
to let Mr Bhuiyan proceed with the project but requested that he receive
a share of the success fee:

And after three or four month, Salim BHULYAN come to my office and
when he approach me, that if you are not interested then give it to me.
I can try. That time I told him yes you can try this but ah, if, if it can
happen, so can you give me something? !8?

1689. Later in the interrogation Mr Mamoon added some further detail:

1690.

1691.

I, [know Salim BHUIYAN from ah, 19, ah, 90. So Salim, then I, Iknow
Mr. Qasim SHARIF, Salim BHUJYAN told me the yeah, this project
belongs to you and your friend Manzurul . So you are not doing
anything ah, and ah, Manzurul tried to do this project, but ah, he, he
don't have that much time because he's an established businessman.
So ah, Iknow Salim BHUIYAN people know that Salim BHUIYAN their
background is project business. They do lot of project. So, if, if you ah,
if you ah, clear me then ah, I want to, I want to do this project. If your
give me the clearance. So I think ah, yes, because I, I'm not doing
anything. So if he, he can do this business there is no wrong with me.
So I just ah, ask Salim BHUIYAN in front of Qasim SHARIF, dah, if, if
you make through this business so I, I, I explain Salim BHUIYAN ah,
I think this, this with me and Manzurul, Qasim SHARIF committed
this, this so...

[oJ

. if you can do this business so can you give us something. So he
told me yes, of course why not. Then chapter is closed. Salim
BHUIYAN got clearance and he make his own way. !233

According to Mr Mamoon’s statements provided during the RCMP
investigation. Mr Sharif and Mr Bhuiyan then made a new agreement:

Then Qasim SHARIF and Salim BHUIYAN, they made it another
agreement. I don't know, what is the terms condition and what thing
with that, that agreement. So they make a agreement and Salim
BHUIYAN start work. 1234

Based on the information in the record of these Arbitrations, Mr Mamoon
said that the scope of work in the new agreement was the same as for the
one he had concluded: “job is same previous work”; but he did not know
the financial conditions: “this is his secret he never discloses to me”.1235

10.3.4.4 — Mr Sharif’s explanations

1692. The explanation which Mr Sharif gave in the RCMP interrogation
corresponds in some respects with that of Mr Mamoon. Mr Sharif stated
that he first went to Mr Mamoon. He did not know Mr Bhuiyan until Mr
Mamoon introduced him and told Mr Sharif “he’s our guy so you will do
the contract with him”;!23¢ and he elaborated:

... Mamoon said, “Salim is the, is the point man.”

[oJ

Is the point man so please organize the agreement with him. So we’d
organise the agreement with Salim. And after the project happened
we paid him.1237

1693. According to the transcript of his RCMP interrogation, Mr Sharif
explained the reasons why he first went to Mr Mamoon, but he did not
give any details of the agreement concluded with Mr Mamoon.

1694. Mr Sharif also provided some confirmation as to by whom the decisions
concerning the Niko project were made, in particular the importance of
what he called the “bureaucrats”, as distinct from the “political people”.
Mr Sharif described the opposition from Petrobangla and BAPEX,
specifically with respect to Chattak East: “so that puts the people in the
ministry in a difficult situation because they cannot make that decision,
they cannot say”.!?58 he identified Dr Kamal Siddique, the Principal
Secretary at the Prime Minister’s office, as a person of decisive influence
and explained that the break-through was brought about by the opinion
of the Law Ministry.!239 The influence of the State Minister on the
“bureaucracy”, according to Mr Sharif, “was probably zero” .1240

10.3.4.5 | Explanations in Mr Bhuiyan’s Confession

1695. Mr Bhuiyan stated in what is referred to here as his Confession!24!
that, when he first met Mr Sharif at Mr Mamoon’s office “sometime in
2002”, Mr Sharif told him that “he has had an understanding with Mr
Mamoon on the matter’.1242 Mr Bhuiyan’s reaction, according to the
Confession, was that he could provide useful assistance with
subcontracts for the construction of pipelines, gas stations and other
work that would be required, once the JVA had been concluded. He made
a proposal to this effect and “/ojn the basis of [this] proposal Mr Qasim
asked [him] to cooperate with Niko to get the work’ .1243

1696. In his Confession, Mr Bhuiyan explained that Mr Mamoon would “help to
get various Government approvals at different stages” for the JVA and the
GPSAs for Feni and Chattak. Upon successful completion “Niko will give
Mr Mamoon six (6) crore Taka and 240 thousand US Dollar at three
stages”,!244 the Taka amount in two equal instalments, one at the
completion of the JVA, the other after signing of the Chattak GPSA; the
US Dollar amount would be paid in 24 monthly instalments of
US$10,000, starting with the Feni GPSA.

1697. Mr Bhuiyan stated that he “agreed to assist’; but he does not mention
any new contract, whether the contracts of June and July 2003 that are
on the record or the November 2002 contracts mentioned in them. From
this Confession it appears that there was just one “understanding”
between Mr Sharif and Mr Mamoon and Mr Bhuiyan provided assistance
in the performance of this “understanding”.

1698. With respect to the performance of this understanding, Mr Bhuiyan’s
Confession states that, one week after he had agreed to assist Mr
Mamoon in the work for Niko,

. Mr Mamoon and I went to the ex-Energy State Minister Mr.
Mosharraf’s House, and Mr. Mamoon explained full subject to State
minister and sought help from him. Ex-State Minister after listening
assured his help to his best abilities. Thereafter I used to contact Mr.

1241 For details see below Section 11.5.1.

1242 Bhuiyan Confession, Exhibit R-324, p. 5.
1243 Bhuiyan Confession, Exhibit R-324, p. 5.
1244 Bhuiyan Confession, Exhibit R-324, p. 5.

486

Mosharraf regularly on this subject and he used to say that the work
is in process. Mr. Mamoon also used to keep in touch with him
regularly, and follow up with him. 1245

After the JVA was concluded,

. as per promise from Niko, they deposited 3 crore Taka in my
account at Standard Chartered Bank in Gulshan branch at different
times. At different times in various amounts Mr. Quashem Sharif
deposited total of 3 crore Taka in my account. From that money I gave
Mr. Mamoon 80 lac Taka by one pay order and at different times in
different sums paid by cash cheque 1 crore Taka. I gave Mr. Mamoon
total 180 lac Taka. From the money deposited in my account, I paid
the Ex-State Minister Mr. Mosharraf, at different times in different
amounts, total 60 lac in cash. The balance of 60 lac Taka I kept for
my work. It is worth mentioning here that Mr. Mamoon had said to me
that he is keeping the majority portion of the taka because Tarique
Rahman is also with him.1246

1699. At an exchange rate of 60 lakh to a US Dollar, the US$500,000 received
by Mr Bhuiyan correspond to the 3 crore mentioned in his Confession.
At that rate, the allocation corresponded to US$300,000 to Mr Mamoon
and US$100,000 to the State Minister and to Mr Bhuiyan.

1700. The Tribunals note that all three statements coincide in as much as Mr
Sharif, as Vice President of Niko, first contacted Mr Mamoon in 2002 and
made an agreement (or “understanding’) with him in terms that were very
similar if not identical with those of the Bhuiyan/Nationwide agreements
of June/July 2003 (and presumably also those of their predecessors in
November 2002) and that, upon conclusion of the JVA, payments as per
these agreements were made. It also appears from the accounts of the
three “witnesses” that it was Mr Mamoon who not only determined the
remuneration but also the scope of the work. In view of the close
resemblance in the records of the statements of all three witnesses, the
Tribunals accept, despite the reservations against these records taken
individually, that Mr Mamoon was indeed engaged by Mr Sharif, acting
for Niko, to support Niko’s project.

1701. The differences concern the questions as to who actually signed the
Mamoon agreement with Niko and the degree of involvement of Mr

1245 Bhuiyan Confession, Exhibit R-324, p. 6.
1246 Bhuiyan Confession, Exhibit R-324, p. 6.

487

Mamoon after the time when Mr Bhuiyan agreed “to assist’. These
questions do not appear essential for the resolution of the issues before
the Tribunals.

1702. There is one point, however, where the explanations in the Mamoon
Transcript find a confirmation by other evidence: this point concerns the
reasons for the entry of Mr Bhuiyan into the relationship, assisting or
replacing Mr Mamoon; these reasons are addressed only in the Mamoon
Transcript. Mr Mamoon explained that, after he had brought the project
to the State Minister and had received the assurance of his support, no
progress was made. After some time, the State Minister informed him
that he faced objections against the project as it was pursued by Niko
and he was unable to overcome these objections. In that situation Mr
Mamoon did not wish to waste his time with a project with only limited
chances of success.

1703. This explanation finds support in the Respondents’ version of the
circumstances of the State Minister’s intervention. They write that in July
2002, “Ministry officials held [a meeting] with BAPEX and Petrobangla
officials at which they confirmed that Chattak East could not be considered
marginal/abandoned and could not be included in the JVA”. They
continue: “Niko and those promised bribes from Niko interjected
themselves to reverse the consistent position of the Ministry, BAPEX, and
Petrobangla’.!?+7 The Respondents then refer to a letter which Niko had
written to the State Minister on 10 August 2002, attaching a legal opinion
by a lawyer from Moudoud and Associates, the firm of the Law
Minister, !248 and conclude as follows:

The State Minister, already aware of Niko’s deal with Mr. Mamoon,
wrote a note on the letter before passing it on for further action:

This matter is hanging |...] indecision for a time. This is unfortunate.
A very simple matter [has] been made complicated. The main issue is
an ‘FOU’ has already been [...] which is more or less binding. It isa
question of implementation. Why BAPEX has to give approval —

1247 R-MC, paragraph 86.
1248 Letter from Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. to Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources, 10
August 2002, Exhibit R-353.

488

1704.

1705.

Ministry should give the approval. A legal advise to this is also
enclosed. Please take immediate action as per FOU.

Thus, the State Minister, after Niko agreed to bribe Mr. Mamoon,
unquestioningly accepted the self-serving “legal” opinion interpreting
the FoU that Niko had obtained from the Law Minister’s private law
firm.1249

Despite this opinion from a barrister of the Law Minister’s private law
firm and the written support of the State Minister, Petrobangla and
BAPEX did not change their position and Niko’s objection to the exclusion
of Chattak East was disregarded. In other words, as Mr Mamoon had
stated in the RCMP interrogation, the State Minister’s intervention
remained without effect. Niko had to wait more than another year before
the JVA was concluded.

Taking the information from the documents available in these
Arbitrations as a start, the following sequence of the Mamoon/Bhuiyan
agreements would seem the most probable:

e Agreement with Mr Mamoon some time after the first quarter of
2002, concluded according to Mr Mamoon by Mr Islam on his
behalf probably with Niko;

1250

 

aragraphs 86-87.

 

489

1706.

1707.

1708.

1709.

Concerning the payments actually made to Mr Mamoon following the
conclusion of the JVA, the Respondents assert that Mr Mamoon was paid
“a total of approximately US$308,000”.1253 In support, the Respondents
rely on a statement in the ACC Charge Sheet, asserting that from the
money received from Mr Sharif, Mr Bhuiyan paid to Mr Mamoon

Taka 80 lakh by a single pay order and Taka 1 crore by several cash
cheques on several dates to Mr Mamun totalling Taka 1 crore 80 lakh
and Taka 60 lakh to the then Minister of State AKM Mosharraf
Hossain in cash on several occasions. }?5+

That statement appears to be taken from the above quoted passage of Mr
Bhuiyan’s confession. At least there is no other basis for this allocation
in the record and the ACC Charge Sheet does not refer to any evidence.

The Claimant pointed out at the Hearing that the only payment by Mr
Bhuiyan to Mr Mamoon that is supported by documentary evidence is a
payment for one crore eight lakh. This amount is evidenced by a pay order
of 7 January 2004;1255 but this pay order is not for 80 lakh, as stated in
Mr Bhuiyan’s confession and the ACC Charge Sheet, but for 1 crore 8
lakh, corresponding at the rate of 60:1 to US$180,000; the Respondents
indicate the amount of US$184,000, likely reflecting nothing more than
a different exchange rate. Elsewhere the Respondents also refer to a “pay
order for the amount Mr Bhuiyan confessed to transferring to Mr Mamoon
(about US$300,000)”; but the support on which the Respondents rely is
an order to Mr Bhuiyan and only for 20 lakh (corresponding to some
US$33,333).

At the Hearing the Claimant presented an extract from the Mamoon
interrogation, where one of the interrogators asserted that 1 crore 80 lakh
were paid to Mr Mamoon and Mr Mamoon corrected him stating that he
received only one crore eight lakh.125© In response, the Respondents did
not refer to the “different sums paid by cash cheque”, mentioned in Mr
Bhuiyan’s confession but referred to another passage in Mr Mamoon’s

1283 B-MD, paragraph 35.
1284 ACC Charge Sheet for Niko Graft Case, Exhibit R-211, p. 20, quoted at B-MD, paragraph 35, Footnote

interrogation in which he had mentioned a loan from Mr Bhuiyan which
he did not have to pay back. 1257

1710. Thus, the Tribunals have seen no evidence for the payment of the alleged
balance “several cash cheques on several dates” in a total 72 lakh
(US$120,000). When the Respondents assert in the Table of Outgoing
Payments!258 that their “evidence also shows that Mr. Bhuiyan paid an
additional amount to Mr. Mamoon (totalling about US$300,000)’, it must
be clarified that only US$180,000 find support by evidence on the
record.

10.3.4.6 Mr Mamoon as channel for Niko’s bribes and as agent of the
Prime Minister

1711. The Respondents describe Mr Mamoon and his role with respect to
Niko’s alleged bribes in different ways. They see in him (i) as a channel
for Niko’s corrupt payments to the State Minister and to the Prime
Minister, acting in the same way as Mr Bhuiyan and his company
Nationwide; they also see him (ii) as an agent of the Prime Minister and
her office and they refer to him as “super lobbyist’.

1712. In the first of these roles, that as channel for bribes, the Respondents
attribute to him the same function as that of Mr Bhuiyan:

. Niko sought Mr. Mamoon’s and Mr. Bhuiyan’s assistance to
channel bribes to the State Minister and the Prime Minister’s son to
overcome the long-standing, legitimate positions of Respondents and
Ministry public servants. !259

1713. In another function, the Respondents describe Mr Mamoon as “agent of
the Prime Minister’s office”.'2©° They do so presumably because of his
close relation to the Prime Minister’s son, Tarique Rahman. Describing
Mr Mamoon as agent of the Prime Minister’s office, in the Respondents’
view, seems to justify their assertion that payments to him were bribery:
“bribing an agent of the Prime Minister’s office (Giasuddin al Mamoon)”.'?61

1717.

Finally, the Respondents quoted Mr Sharif who described Mr Mamoon as
a “super lobbyist”:

P [presumably Mr Bhuiyan] worked with an individual named
MAMOON, who was known as a "super lobbyist" in regards to his
activities with the Bangladesh government. 1262

The Respondents assert that “Mr Sharif admitted that he hired Giasuddin
al Mamoon as a ‘super lobbyist’ to get the JVA and the GPSA
concluded”. 1263

While the Claimant, as quoted above, denies having any knowledge
about discussions or agreements between Sharif/Stratum and Mr
Mamoon, it points out that Mr Mamoon is not a government official; 126+
and it does not accept that the record in the Arbitrations justify the
conclusion that Mr Mamoon’s “involuement necessarily entailed the
involvement of Tarique Rahman, which in turn (based on the false
comparison to the Siemens case) inevitably infers corrupt influence in the
project”. 1265

The Tribunals have examined the evidence concerning the involvement
of Mr Mamoon and note that in the RCMP interrogation, Mr Sharif
explained in some detail the reasons why he engaged Mr Mamoon as
consultant. He emphasised the importance of being associated with Mr
Mamoon during the implementation of the project, “the support we
could get from MAMOON you know when we were actually running the
operations”.!26© Mr Sharif was asked about “the nature of MAMOON’s
power’ and he explained:

...my understanding I can tell you about my understanding. That he
and Tarique single handily was responsible for the overwhelming
majority for the strategies they took during the election for BNP to win
so many seats in the parliament. This was my understanding. And
this was in the rumors and media and all the top AWAMI people or

BNP people that I met that's what they said. So when I went to see
MAMOON it was my understanding that just his name because
MAMOON would not led his name to anybody. He would not do just
any project you know. I'm sure he was after high dollar projects ours
was not a high dollar project. But ours was I think sexy enough that
it had been talked about and there was a lot of media ...1267

1718. Mr Sharif elaborated on this aspect:

The primary purpose of doing the agreement with MAMOON was to
give us protection in Bangladesh. Is that, so that we have somebody
politically so strong so overwhelming that ah we will not get killed you
know once we go to our, once we are in operation you know because
we need to the local politicians in Feni and Chattak we need them out
of our way. You know we don't want our barges stopped, we don't
you know we need a political cover. 1268

In addition Mr Sharif explained:

SHARIF: _ ... You know just not even for him just for his name, so
that we could have his name and if we needed any help with the
police any regulators with this, with that you know just prevent bad
things from happening to us. That was the whole idea.

DUGGAN: Okay, it was insurance type thing....

SHARIF: _ ....yeah, basically, you know I mean.

SCHOEPP: I, I believe your expression during the last interview was

you couldn't, you couldn't even get a cup of tea somewhere at the
minister's office unless you had some sort of...

SHARIF: _....yeah....

SCHOEP. _... connection ...

SHARIF: _ ... I mean you, yeah you be you know ah, if I called the
secretary to see me you know it the call won't get past the his
assistant.

DUGGAN: Okay.

1267 Sharif Transcript, Exhibit R-333, p. 66.
1268 Sharif Transcript, Exhibit R-333, pp 34-35.

493

SHARIF: If MAMOON assistant, MAMOON does not have to call it,
MAMOON's assistant calls the secretary's office I can see him in half
an hour probably. !269

1719. Prompted by Corporal Duggan, one of the interrogators, Mr Sharif also
highlighted the usefulness of Mr Mamoon’s support. Corporal Duggan
explained that, although the Canadian investigators “had the law on
[their] side”, they faced many “bureaucratic impediments” by “small
people”, “blocking you just for the sake of blocking you”:

DUGGAN: ... we still had great difficulty in getting things done
because there, there was many bureaucratic impediments.

SHARIF: Yeah.

DUGGAN: Where we had, I hate to use the term but small people.
SHARIF: Yeah.

DUGGAN: Um, blocking you just for the sake of blocking you.
SHARIF: Yes, absolutely...

DUGGAN: I think it's ah....

SHARIF: _ ....absolutely.

DUGGAN: Ah... '...

SHARIF: Absolutely, so when you have a guy like MAMOON on
board you know you can just forget about those guys. You know and
if MAMOON calls the secretary then you go see him.1!27°

1720. Mr Sharif developed the point by an example concerning the
transportation of materials to Niko’s work sites:

... having a guy like MAMOON as our agent gave us a lot of protection
from all this little guys. Especially the problem is this you go work in
Feni and the council chairman says no, no ah, this road there won't
be any trucks going in to this site, you know. No, you know we're done
we cannot work, nobody will dare to drive, you cannot find a transport
company that will drive in there you know. But he will never say that

1269 Sharif Transcript, Exhibit R-333, pp. 38-39.
1270 Sharif Transcript, Exhibit R-333, p. 65.

494

if he knows MAMOON is our, is our agent they will never get in our
way. 1271

1721. Mr Sharif added an example for such administrative interventions and
the costs they caused to a project; and he concluded:

So these are the sort of things that, that was foremost in my mind
drilling a well in Bangladesh has its challenges but it's nothing
compared to the logistical challenges. !?72

1722. Finally, the references must be mentioned which Mr Sharif made to the
relationship of Mr Mamoon to Tarique Rahman, the son of the Prime
Minister who had a leading role in the BNP. He stated that, jointly with
Mr Rahman, Mr Mamoon “single handily was responsible for the
overwhelming majority” !273 of the BNP in the 2001 elections and decided
“who will be the State Ministers in different ministries” 127+

1723. Mr Mamoon emphasised the importance of his relationship with Mr
Rahman. He attributed fifty percent of his success, power and influence
to Mr Rahman and fifty percent to his own competence as a business
man; at least this is what the Tribunals understood from the following
passage, which also gives an idea of the difficulties in understanding the
transcript of Mr Mamoon’s interrogation:

My power is say, my power is fifty percent, I'm the friend of Tarique
RAHMAN. I'm fifty, because of, I'm the friend of Tarique RAHMAN. And

I'm starting my career in 1986. I have now a days, I have almost ten
to twelve industry. And money ...1275

Similar statement about Tarique Rahman are repeated at different
occasions during the interrogation; at some stage Mr Mamoon
summarised it:

... obviously I’m a, number one I’m a business man, number two I’m
ah, attached with power.1276

For the reasons explained, the Tribunals take these statements with
caution, as they are untested by examination of their authors at a
hearing. The Tribunals see no indication in them that would support the
Respondents’ descriptions of Mr Mamoon in the first of the roles
attributed to him: assuming that Mr Mamoon’s statement about the basis
of his influence is correct and he did indeed derive this influence to fifty
percent from his association with Mr Rahman, does not make him an
“agent of the Prime Minister’s office”. It does not justify the assertion that
payment to him, in itself, must be taken as an act of corruption. The
transcript of Mr Mamoon’s RCMP interrogation makes it clear that Mr
Mamoon considered his transaction with Mr Sharif and Niko as his own
business, not as the business of Mr Rahman or the Prime Minister and
her office. Explanations by Mr Khan that such agency role may have
occurred in other circumstances, such as the Siemens case, if they were
established, are not evidence for accepting that Mr Mamoon took this role
in the Niko case.

The Tribunals also do not accept the Respondents’ second
characterisation of Mr Mamoon’s role; they do not believe that Mr
Mamoon can be considered simply as a “layer” or conduit by which Niko
passed money to Government officials, in the modus operandi described
by the Investigators for the Siemens case. Whatever else he may have
been, in the Tribunals’ estimation, Mr Mamoon plainly operated
independently from Niko.

The description given by Mr Sharif suggests that the role of Mr Mamoon
and the agreement with him had two other purposes. One of them is what
Corporal Duggan, in the quotation above, described as “insurance”, i.e
discouraging vexatious interference in the operation of the project. The

plausibility of this explanation of Mr Mamoon’s role has not been
addressed by the Respondents. In any event, it would become effective
only after the conclusion of the JVA and is unrelated to the agreement on
the GPSA. It need not be considered in the present context.

1728. The other role, which in the view of the Tribunals seems to have motivated
Mr Sharif in engaging Mr Mamoon, corresponds to the third of the three
roles which the Respondents attributed to him: according to the
statements by Mr Sharif quoted above, Mr Mamoon was engaged as a
lobbyist, or “super-lobbyist” and expected to provide access to relevant
people in the Government and support for Niko’s efforts to obtain the JVA
and the GPSA.

10.3.4.7 Mr Mamoon as Lobbyist, engaged to exercise influence

1729. The Claimant discusses lobbying and support services in the context of
the Bhuiyan/Nationwide agreements. It expected from Mr Bhuiyan

... to deliver the one aspect of Stratum’s mandate that it had been
struggling to perform effectively: specifically, providing lobbying and
logistical support in relation to engagement with the government,
especially in the face of the intransigent reversal of positions of
BAPEX and other public servants, as reflected predominantly in the
positions taken by Mr. Elahi as described below.'277

1730. Referring in particular to the testimony of Mr Chowdhury and Mr Elahi
and the positions taken by them and others towards Niko’s project, the
Claimant explains:

The record also shows that, at the time Nationwide in particular was
retained, there was a compelling reason for the retention of an
effective lobbying and government relations consultant in order to try
to break a deadlock created by misguided and ill-informed obstinacy
on the part of the officials with whom Niko was dealing. Indeed, the
testimony of Mr. Chowdhury and Mr. Elahi provided telling insight
into the obstinacy that Niko faced at the time.1278

1731.

1732.

1733.

1734.

1735.

These observations can be applied also to the engagement of Mr Mamoon
whose services were retained prior to Niko’s agreements with Mr
Bhuiyan.

The Claimant argues that the engagement of consultants to provide such
lobbying services “was indeed common practice in the oil and gas industry
in Bangladesh, including by the major and super-major oil companies who
participated in the 1998 PSC bid rounds”.!279 The Claimant also refers to
testimony by Ms LaPrevotte who “freely acknowledged that lobbying was
a large industry in the U.S., and that she understood that common lobbying
activities included facilitating meetings or phone calls with Government
decision-makers, and attempting to persuade such decision-makers of the
merits of a particular course of action”. 128°

The Claimant concludes that the engagement of Nationwide for such
lobbying activity was thus “for entirely legitimate purposes”.'?°! In the
circumstances, the Claimant’s conclusion can be taken as representing
their view also with respect to the engagement of Mr Mamoon who,
according the Tribunals’ view, preceded Mr Bhuiyan and Nationwide.

The Respondents argue that, as lobbyists or otherwise, Mr Bhuiyan and
Mr Mamoon engaged in illegal activities, paying bribes and “exerting
personal influence”:

The so-called “effective lobbying and government relations” efforts
undertaken by Niko’s agents comprised of distributing Niko’s money
and exerting personal influence to induce the Government to override
honest public servants and give Niko benefits to which it was not
entitled. Niko admits it paid Mr. Bhuiyan to get the Government to
take the extreme position it did. Neither Niko’s methods nor the
interpretations it obtained from the Law Minister withstand
scrutiny. 1282

The Tribunals have examined in Section 6.5.4 the Respondents’
argument concerning the law of Bangladesh, as expressed in Section 163
of the Penal Code, sanctioning “any gratifications whatever, as motive or
reward for inducing, by the exercise of personal influence, any public

servant to do or to forbear to do any official act, or in the exercise of the
official functions of such public servant to show favour or disfavour to any
person’. They concluded that this provision did not prohibit contracts for
lobbying in general, as argued by the Respondents, but only the exercise
of “personal influence”, in the sense of bringing to bear special personal
relations in order to induce a public servant to perform the desired action.

1736. To apply this provision to the situation before these Tribunals, one would
have to examine whether (i) the relationship between Mr Mamoon and
the State Minister could be characterised as “personal’, in the sense used
in Section 163 of the Penal Act and (ii) that Mr Mamoon was paid (or
promised payment) by Mr Sharif or Niko to rely on that relationship in
order to influence the action of the State Minister with respect to the JVA.

1737. In the Tribunals’ understanding of the crime under Section 163 of the
Penal Code is correct, there are reasons to assume that the relationship
between Mr Mamoon and the State Minister could be characterised as
“personal’. It does not seem that family ties exist between the two; but
according to the transcript of Mr Sharif’s interrogation, “MAMOON
decided who will be the different State Ministers”. 183 If such were indeed
his position, one may presume that Mr Mamoon’s personal relationship
with the State Minister gave him a strong basis for inducing the State
Minister to act in a certain manner, thus exercising “personal influence”.

1738. At the RCMP interrogation, this relationship was also the subject of an
exchange between Mr Sharif and Corporal Duggan. When asked by the
interrogators whether the money given to Mr Mamoon would go to the
State Minister, Mr Sharif responded:

. why would he? First of all there has to be need for him to give to
Mosharraf [the State Minister]. It's usually the other way around.
Mosharraf is suppose to raise money you know to give to MAMOON
that's why he, he placed all this seven or eight State Ministers in the
Ministries. They're supposed to raise money give it to the political
party. You know.

DUGGAN: Okay.

SHARIF: Or give it to MAMOON give to political party because these
are the top guys in the political party you know. So it was not evena

1283 Sharif Transcript, Exhibit R-333, p. 33; see also p. 66, as quoted above.

499

consideration that MAMOON would pay Mosharraf. You know why
would MAMOON pay Mosharraf? I mean for what, he, he appointed
him, you know.

DUGGAN: He controls him?

SHARIF: He controls him, its, it's not the other way around you
know. What would Mosharraf do for us? Mosharraf told me very
clearly from very beginning you know that the, that he that you know
MAMOON is his major benefactor and he didn’t have to say it. It was
just so implied ...1284

1739. The Tribunals are mindful about the concern that reliance on this and
other transcripts raise. The statement of Mr Sharif has not been tested
at a hearing and, in any event, it is second hand, reporting what Mr
Mamoon told him. It does, however, reflect the understanding of Mr
Sharif when he decided to engage Mr Mamoon for the promotion of Niko’s
project. These observations correspond to the manner in which the
Investigators have described the political network in Bangladesh during
the BNP period. Assuming, with this precaution, that Mr Mamoon did
indeed consider himself the “benefactor” of the State Minister, it may well
be justified to treat this relationship as “personal” in the sense of Section
163.

1740. The next question to be examined is thus whether Mr Mamoon was
engaged to “exercise” this personal relationship and whether he did
exercise it. In other words, was Mr Mamoon engaged to obtain the
intervention of the State Minister by relying on his position as his
benefactor? In the Tribunals’ understanding of Section 163 of the Penal
Code, it is not the existence of a personal relationship which makes this
section applicable, but the exercise of the potential for influence resulting
by this relationship and the engagement to induce the public servant “by
the exercise of personal influence”.

1741. None of the persons involved in the engagement of Mr Mamoon as Niko’s
lobbyist have appeared before the Tribunals; and there is no

documentary evidence on this engagement and its objectives.

1742. There is, however, evidence on the manner in which Niko considered the
issues for which it engaged support. As shown in Section 8 above, there

was consensus among all concerned that the Niko project was in the
interest of the Respondents and Bangladesh; so were the conditions
negotiated by the Respondents with Niko. What held up the finalisation
of the JVA was the Chattak East issue and possibly the Swiss Challenge
question. Niko had expressed its views in this respect openly both in
correspondence and in meetings; the view was shared by the Law
Ministry and the Tribunals found it not unreasonable.

Niko’s position, thus, was of a nature that could very well be defended on
a rational basis, as Niko did in correspondence, without there being a
need to make it prevail through the exercise of “personal influence”. The
explanations given by the Claimant, as quoted above, are not implausible.

There is indeed reference in the Mamoon transcript to the joint
understanding of Mr Mamoon and the State Minister that the Niko project
was a good project which was in the interest of the country: “So he had a
very good proposal |...] Bangladesh government, they don’t invest any, not
a single penny”.'285 After having examined the proposal, the State
Minister “was also convinced yes, this is a good project’.!28© This would
seem to indicate that the State Minister supported the Niko project not
because of Mr Mamoon’s exercise of personal influence but as a result of
his own assessment of the value of the project and its interest for the
country.

This being said, the explanations contained in Mr Mamoon’s RCMP
transcript concerning his discussion with the State Minister about the
Niko project also contain other indications. In the relevant passages there
is mention of a “business proposal’ and Mr Mamoon’s request for help;
these passages might indicate that Mr Mamoon appealed to a personal
relationship with the State Minister and the resulting duties.

In the end, it may well have been a combination of the two, the personal
relationship between Mr Mamoon and the State Minister and the
conviction that the project was in the interest of the country.

The Tribunals can leave the question unresolved whether the
intervention of Mr Mamoon with the State Minister and the fee he

1285 Mamoon Transcript, 1 November 2008, Exhibit R-316, p. 45.
1286 Mamoon Transcript, 1 November 2008, Exhibit R-316, p. 45.

501

requested for this intervention was an exercise of personal influence or
not. The Tribunals do not have to decide the question whether Mr
Mamoon must be condemned for violation of Section 163 of the Penal
Code. The Tribunals’ issue is whether the Agreements were procured by
illegal means.

1748. It is clear from the transcript of Mr Mamoon’s RCMP interrogation that
Mr Mamoon’s intervention with the State Minister remained without
effect on the approval of the JVA. As explained above,!287 the State
Minister’s support of the project met with the opposition from the
“bureaucrats”. The objections from BAPEX, Petrobangla and others were
not overcome.

1749. Mr Mamoon’s explanations are confirmed by the evidence about the
course of events: the agreement with Mr Mamoon was concluded
presumably during the first half of 2002 and his intervention with the
State Minister must have occurred around that time. It took over a year
until, in October 2003, the JVA was concluded. The sequence of events
has been described above in Section 9. The obstacle was not the State
Minister, but BAPEX and Petrobangla; the breakthrough was not due to
Mr Mamoon’s intervention with the State Minister but came about when
BAPEX suggested that matter be submitted to the Law Ministry and by
the opinions which the Law Ministry then delivered.

1750. In conclusion, there are good reasons to believe that the agreement of Mr
Sharif for Niko with Mr Mamoon was for ordinary lobbying services; but
even if the exercise of personal influence of Mr Mamoon with the State
Minister was the objective or one of the objectives, this agreement did
not procure the JVA.

10.3.4.8 The Bhuiyan/ Nationwide agreements as “layering”

1751. Much of what has been said above about the agreement with Mr Mamoon
also applies to the agreements with Mr Bhuiyan and his company
Nationwide. Indeed, as explained above, Mr Mamoon stated that he
passed on to Mr Bhuiyan the agreement that he (or Mr Islam for him) had

1287 Section 10.3.4.2.

502

concluded with Mr Sharif. The Respondents quote the transcript of the
RCMP interrogation:

... Mamoon said, ‘Salim is [...] the point man so please organize the
agreement with him. So we’d organize the agreement with Salim. And
after the project happened we paid him. 288

1752. The RCMP transcript records further explanations by Mr Sharif about the
transfer of the assignment and the arrangements for the signature of the
new agreements:

[...] the main agreement was signed by Bob [Ohlson] by Niko and then
the secondary agreement Salim did not want Stratum to sign any
agreement. He wanted Niko on the hook, he said we need [...] to make
sure that we have a foreign company [...[ the main company that holds
the license here |...] we want an agreement with Niko and that’s how
it was done. So I talked to Bob, Bob signed the agreement [...] the
agreements are structured between Niko and Stratum such that
Stratum has to pay their, has to pay their fee [...] once Stratum get
paid by Niko ...1?89

1753. Although it thus appears that the Mamoon agreement was passed on to
Mr Bhuiyan, there are some important differences between the situation
of the Mamoon agreement and that concerning Bhuiyan/ Nationwide:
there is written evidence for the second set of agreements with
Nationwide, i.e. those concluded in June/July 2003; the terms of this
second set thus are known. Moreover, the first phase of the
Bhuiyan/Nationwide agreements, the one concerning the JVA, was
completed and the agreed fees were paid by Mr Sharif out of the funds
which Niko paid to him at this occasion.

1754. As in the case of the agreement with Mr Mamoon, the Respondents see
in the agreements concluded by Niko and Mr Sharif with Mr Bhuiyan and
his company Nationwide a clear example of “layering”. In their view,
Bhuiyan/Nationwide served as conduit for Niko’s corrupt payments,
following the modus operandi which the Investigators had seen with
Siemens and other foreign companies. The Respondents’ assertions to
the effect that Mr Mamoon helped channel bribes to the State Minister
and Prime Minister’s son to overcome the opposition against the JVA, as
quoted above, apply equally to Bhuiyan/ Nationwide.

1288 Sharif Transcript, Exhibit R-333, p. 36, quoted at R-MC, paragraph 84.
1289 Sharif Transcript, R-333, p. 37.

503

1755. The Respondents and the Investigators argue that the agreement with Mr
Bhuiyan and his company Nationwide reflects an attempt by Niko to
distance itself from its corrupt payments.

The Niko agent [Mr Sharif] informed the F.B.I. that he was working
with an individual in Bangladesh named Selim Bhuiyan. The Niko
agent told the F.B.I. that he had hired Nationwide, a company owned
by Bhuiyan, as a consultant for Niko to assist with obtaining contracts
in Bangladesh. The Niko agent stated that he paid Nationwide for the
work it was doing for Niko from the Stratum Development bank
account in Switzerland. Based on my experience and knowledge of
money laundering and corruption, it is clear to me that payments
made from the Stratum Development account for work being
conducted on behalf of Niko was done with the intent to distance Niko
from the bribes being paid to officials and their family members in
Bangladesh. The accounts opened for Niko Resources Bangladesh
and for the Niko agent and for Stratum Development were open at a
Caribbean bank and a Swiss bank, and thus transactions were not
conducted from accounts in Canada or Bangladesh. This could be
seen as evidence of an attempt to hide, disguise or conceal the origin
and nature of the payments. 129°

1756. The Claimant disputes this characterisation of Mr Bhuiyan’s role by
noting the need and legitimacy of lobbying services. The arguments
concerning the issues of principle have been addressed above in Section
6.5.4 when considering the case of Mr Mamoon. With respect to Mr
Bhuiyan, the controversy concerns specifically the services which he was
engaged to provide and which in fact he did provide.

1757. The Respondents and the Investigators describe Mr Bhuiyan as “a
consultant with no operational function” and assert:

... Claimant provided no evidence of legitimate services Mr. Bhuiyan
provided to earn US$500,000 or why Mr. Bhuiyan paid Mr. Mamoon
if not as a bribe to be shared with Tarique Rahman, or why Mr. Sharif
originally approached Mr. Mamoon for a subagent agreement to help
Niko other than to pay him to obtain the approval of the Ministry and
the Prime Minister’s office.!29!

1290 LaPrevotte First Witness Statement, paragraph 38.
1291 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 111.

504

1758. The Respondents refer to the Claimant’s assertions about Mr Bhuiyan’s
services and contrast these assertions with the testimony of the
Claimant’s witnesses at the Hearing. They quote from the Claimant’s
Counter-Memorial:

The specific nature of services to be provided under the Nationwide
Consultancy Agreement were described as providing marketing and
logistical support to Niko in securing the JVA and the GPSAs. It also
specifically provided that:

a. Nationwide would “provide all necessary liaison with
Bapex, Petrobangla, Ministry of Energy & Mineral
Resources, and the various relevant GOB agencies”.

b. Regular meetings between the parties’ key personnel would
take place a minimum of twice a month. ...

... Mr. Ohlson also advised Mr. Bhuiyan that Niko would be expecting
him to meet with Niko regularly, and he requested that Mr. Bhuiyan
apply for a long-term visa....

The record thus demonstrates that Nationwide indeed provided the
services stipulated in the Nationwide Consultancy Agreement, and
also that it would be providing and did provide such services following
execution of the JVA. Nationwide was, as such, clearly not a mere
conduit for bribes, as the Respondents allege....

Moreover, the evidence indicates that Nationwide, through Mr.
Bhuiyan in particular, was still actively trying to assist Niko in
obtaining a GPSA almost two years after the JVA was signed.!29?

1759. The Respondents then contrast these assertions with the testimony of Mr
Adolph and Mr Hornaday at the Hearing. Mr Adolph said he was “not
sure” about assistance by Mr Bhuiyan in obtaining the GPSA and in
setting up meetings; he did not recall Mr Bhuiyan being mentioned in
any of the correspondence; and did not know anything about what Mr
Bhuiyan did and about the payments to him, whether promised or made.
Mr Hornaday met Mr Bhuiyan only twice: the first time when he travelled
with the State Minister to Calgary in June 2005; and the second time
some years later “in a hotel. It was just social’. He was not aware of the

arrangements with Mr Bhuiyan and what he did with the money that
Stratum paid him. !298

After the Hearing, the Tribunals invited the Claimant, in one of the
questions in Annex A attached to Procedural Order No 20, to “specify
which concrete services it expected from [...] Mr Bhuiyan/ Nationwide Co
Ltd and under their respective contracts in consideration of the payments
that the Claimant agreed to make to those consultants, and what services
they actually provided, identifying any documents on record which are
evidence for such services” 1294

The Claimant responded by arguing:

. the evidentiary record emerging from the hearing provides strong
evidence that Nationwide performed legitimate and valuable services
in connection with the JVA, and was appropriately remunerated at a
level that was in line with industry practice. !?95

 

 

1296

The Claimant also refers to the non-compete clause in the Nationwide
Consultancy Agreement and Mr Moyes’ explanations concerning the
usefulness of local consultants.

The Tribunals are not impressed by the description in the Nationwide
Consultancy Agreement; the question they must address is whether these
were truly the services he was expected to deliver.

Mr Moyes had stated in his opinion that Mr Bhuiyan was a “well-
established and respected member of the Bangladesh community ...”.1297
Questioned by the Tribunals, he had to accept that he did not know Mr
Bhuiyan and the statement was an assumption.!29§ His statements
concerning the usefulness of lobbying services in general and specifically
in Bangladesh have been considered above. The Tribunals agree with Mr
Moyes’ statements in principle; but their task is to determine whether in
reality such were indeed the services for which Mr Bhuiyan was engaged,
and not for making payments to Government officials as alleged by the
Respondents.

The Claimant asserts that the services for which Nationwide was retained
were legitimate and were in fact performed. With respect to testimony by
witnesses from the Claimant’s organisation, the Claimant points to the
evidentiary difficulties which have been discussed above. !299 It points to
the testimony of Mr Adolph about a meeting with the State Minister in
2005, attended by Mr Bhuiyan as part of the Niko delegation; !5°° and to
the testimony of Mr Hornaday, about his meeting with Mr Bhuiyan during
his visit to Calgary in 2005. 180!

The activities of Mr Bhuiyan were confirmed by one of the Respondents’
witnesses, Mr Chowdhury. In his witness statement he stated:

An associate of the Minister, Mr. Selim Bhuiyan, was very frequently
in the Ministry. It was well-known that he was the Minister's money
man. He came to my office one day and tried to impress upon me his
connection with my State Minister. I did not appreciate his gesture
and did not continue the conversation. He was very often in the
Minister's office when I went in to discuss business and on one
occasion I had to insist firmly with the Minister that it was
inappropriate to discuss government matters in the presence of Mr.
Bhuiyan. 1302

At the Hearing, Mr Chowdhury confirmed that “Mr Bhuiyan was
frequently in the Ministry”; '3°3 and:

I visited the Minister’s office a number of times, and on most of the
occasions, I found him sitting beside the Minister. 19°4

Mr Chowdhury does however not know what Mr Bhuiyan was discussing
with the State Minister: “They did not discuss in my presence
anything.” !5°5 Mr Chowdhury also testified that Mr Bhuiyan approached
his colleagues at the Ministry, the Joint Secretary and Mr Chowdhury’s
Assistant Secretary. When asked whether Mr Bhuiyan ever talked to him,
Mr Chowdhury replied “He could not get a chance”. 1306

The Claimant also refers to Mr Chowdhury’s testimony concerning the
role of Mr Bhuiyan. When asked whether Mr Bhuiyan “was acting as an
agent for Niko with the Minister to get this process done”, he answered
“Yes”, and explained that he was told by his “colleagues in the
Ministry’ .19°7

These statements find confirmation in Mr Bhuiyan’s Confession. There
he states that after the visit to the State Minister’s house:

I used to contact with Mr Mosharraf regularly on this subject and he
used to say that the work is in progress. 1308

As a confirmation of the testimony of a witness who appeared before
them, the Tribunals consider this statement to be of interest, despite the
limitations on the evidentiary weight of this Confession that have been
discussed elsewhere in this Decision.

The Tribunals conclude from the evidence before them that at least some
of the services which Nationwide agreed to perform under the
Consultancy Agreement were not a mere facade for a “consultant”
serving as conduit for bribes. They were a lobbying activity which was
actually performed. Insofar as it consisted in ordinary lobbying services,

the activity was legitimate and cannot be taken as layering in the sense
described in the Siemens case.

1774. This conclusion does not affect the question whether, as part of the
activity for which Mr Bhuiyan was engaged, he was expected to pay bribes
and did so in fact; this question will be examined in the following section.

1775. Nor does this conclusion deal with the Respondents’ assertion that Niko
“engaged Mr Bhuiyan to exercise personal influence over State Minister
AKM Mosharraf Hossain to gain his favour and obtain the JVA”.13°9 They
also argue that Niko agreed “to paying Selim Bhuiyan to use his personal
influence to obtain favorable treatment from the State Minister, including
Government approval of the Agreements’.'5!0 Later in the same
submission, the Respondents speak of Mr Bhuiyan’s “personal influence
over the State Minister’.1311

1776. The Tribunals have examined the Respondents’ statements concerning
the alleged “personal influence” of Mr Bhuiyan over the State Minister.
When asserting that Mr Bhuiyan was paid to use “personal influence”,
the Respondents do not explain what this personal influence was. At
some stage they state that Mr Bhuiyan “was a travel company owner
making hidden deals with his friend, the State Minister, in
Bangladesh” ..'312

1777. The Respondents have not explained the personal relationship on which
they base the assertion that Mr Bhuiyan was engaged to exercise
personal influence on the State Minister. Ms LaPrevotte provided some
information about Mr Bhuiyan’s background and position. She stated:

Selim Bhuiyan, is a businessman in Dhaka, who, at the time was the
President of an upscale social club in Bangladesh called the Dhaka
Club. His position as the President of this club put him in contact with
all of the social elite of Dhaka. Selim Bhuiyan was an old family friend
of the Energy Minister Hossain. Hossain introduced Bhuiyan to
Mamoon and as Mamoon was a close friend of Tarique Rahman,
Bhuiyan enjoyed access to the inner circle of the BNP-led government.

1310 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 117; similarly at paragraph 150.
1311 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 150.

1312 R-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 33.

509

Mamoon was often at the Dhaka Club and Mamoon and Bhuiyan
would play golf together.1313

1778. There has been no allegation that Mr Bhuiyan played a political role like
that attributed to Mr Tarique Rahman and to Mr Mamoon and that, on
this basis, he could exercise personal influence on the State Minister. The
Respondents have not explained how social relations as those described
by Ms LaPrevotte, or the family friendship mentioned in Mr Bhuiyan’s
Confession, must be considered of a nature that would make the activity
of Mr Bhuiyan no longer that of a lobbyist but one who exercised personal
influence.

1779. Mr Bhuiyan’s interventions may have helped Niko to get access to the
State Minister and an occasion to present its case to him.!3!4 The
clearance of the road to the JVA, however, was not made by the State
Minister. There is no indication that the position of the
“bureaucrats” was modified in any way by the State Minister. As
explained above, it was BAPEX which proposed to submit the matter to
the Law Ministry and the opinion provided by that Ministry which
changed the “bureaucrats” position and brought about the finalisation of
the JVA. As to the GPSA, the State Minister had no role in its adoption,
since he had resigned long before it was agreed and executed.

1780. Concerning the reasonableness of the compensation agreed with
Bhuiyan/Nationwide and paid to them, the Respondents deny that Mr
Bhuiyan provided any legitimate services and thus maintain that no
compensation was justified.

1781. The Claimant argues that

...the record establishes that the remuneration paid to Nationwide
was in line with industry practice, and commensurate with the level
of risk in accepting a purely success-based fee (which was amply
demonstrated by the subsequent failure to obtain a GPSA so as to
unlock the second tranche of compensation). 1315

1313 LaPrevotte First Witness Statement, paragraph 35.
1314 The issue is discussed in C-CMC, paragraph 236 and R-RC, paragraph 146.
1315 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 102.

510

1782. When examining the compensation agreed with Bhuiyan/ Nationwide, the
Tribunals have considered that the initial consultancy fee of
Stratum/Sharif was in substance US$4 million,!316 payable at the
conclusion of the JVA. As stated above in the context of the discussion
about the compensation of Sharif/Stratum, the Claimant saw in Mr
Bhuiyan’s engagement the expectation that he could “deliver the one
aspect of Stratum’s mandate that it had been struggling to perform
effectively: specifically, providing lobbying and logistical support in relation
to engagement with the government’.!317 Mr Sharif decided that out of the
overall amount of US$4 million at the conclusion of the JVA, he would
pay US$500,000 to Bhuiyan/Nationwide. From this perspective, the
amount agreed and paid to Bhuiyan/Nationwide does not appear as
necessarily excessive. In itself it is not a sign of layering. Again, this
conclusion does not exclude that some of this amount was used as bribe,
a question that will be examined next below.

1783. The Tribunals conclude that Mr Bhuiyan was engaged by Mr Sharif to
assist him in the contacts with the Respondents and the Government
with the objective of obtaining the JVA and the GPSA; and Mr Bhuiyan
did indeed provide such assistance, intervening in particular with the
Minister and his staff. In the view of the Tribunals, such services are
legitimate. They are different from those which the Respondents and
the Investigators have observed with other companies and described as
“layering”.

1784. This conclusion does not exclude that, when engaging Mr Bhuiyan, Mr
Sharif also expected him to make illegitimate payments to the Minister
and that such payments were indeed made. The Tribunals, here as with
respect to the other consultants, must therefore examine whether such
payments were in fact made and caused BAPEX and Petrobangla to enter
into the JVA and the GPSA.

10.3.4.9 | Conclusion on “layering”

1785. The Tribunals have carefully examined the Respondents’ assertion that
the conclusion of Niko’s consultancy agreements, in themselves, were
evidence for bad faith and corruption and that, from the time Niko

1316 The possible increases based on future production did not become effective.
1317 C-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 102; see above Section 10.3.4.7.

entered Bangladesh, it set up a network of consultants to promise and
pay bribes and that these consultancy agreements were concluded to
channel bribes to Government officials.

The Tribunals have found no evidence to support the alleged set up of a
network of consultants for corruption. The evidence shows that it was
not unreasonable in the circumstances for Niko to engage consultants to
provide assistance in the negotiations for the Agreements. There are in
sum no evidentiary grounds, nor any warranted inferences, for
concluding that any of the four consultants, Sharfudding Ahmed (Four
Feathers), Qasim Sharif (Stratum), Giasudding Al Mamoon and Salim
Bhuiyan (Nationwide), was engaged for illegitimate purposes.

The Tribunals are not persuaded that any of them was engaged for
the purpose of “layering” in the sense of passing bribes from Niko to
public officials. The Respondents’ argument in this respect, apparently
inspired by the Investigators’ experience with other companies and their
modus operandi, is not supported by the evidence in the record in these
Arbitrations. The Tribunals have not seen persuasive evidence that,
with the possible exception of Mr Mamoon, any of the consultants was
engaged to exercise “personal influence” in the sense of Section 163
of the Bangladesh Penal Code or did in fact exercise such illegal influence.

The evidence before them does not lead the Tribunals to conclude that,
by concluding the consultancy agreements, Niko acted unfairly or
obtained the Agreements by corruption or by committing other breaches
of international or Bangladeshi law.

This does not exclude that the consultants so engaged, in the
performance of their tasks, did pay bribes to Government officials and
thereby procured the Agreements. Therefore, the true question which
must be examined is whether the consultants actually engaged in
corruption and whether it was such corruption that procured the
conclusion of the Agreements. This requires that the Tribunals examine
specifically the payments which the Respondents present as suspect to
determine whether it has been established that they have actually been
made and whether they procured the conclusion of the Agreements.

11 SPECIFIC SUSPECT PAYMENTS

1790.

1791.

1792.

The identification of Suspect Payments and the Tribunals’ questions
relating to them

In their submissions and at the Hearing, the Respondents and the
Investigators referred to a number of payments which, in their view, were
intended, directly or indirectly, to corrupt decision makers with the
objective of procuring the JVA and the GPSA (the “Suspect Payments’).
Payments made by Niko Canada to Bangladesh were identified on a chart
prepared by the Investigators and produced as Exhibit R-320. Mr Khan
explained:

MR KHAN: We make, the investigators -- particularly at FBI, RCMP,
and I -- together sat down in Washington with all our evidence
package and we tried to draw out a map up to certain level in 2008,
and there is a chart exist. I presume Debra [LaPrevotte] will introduce
that to you. 1318

The chart was discussed extensively at the Hearing, frequently referred
to as the “Spider Web”. Marked versions were produced in the course of
this discussion.!3!9 The chart shows the payments made by Niko Canada
to Niko Bangladesh and from there to two accounts at UBP, one the
account of Mr Sharif, the other that of Stratum. The records assembled
in the course of the Joint Investigation were said to show that, from these
two accounts, a large number of payments was made to various
beneficiaries. Some of these payments are simply transfers from one
account of Mr Sharif to another. Other entries on the chart identify third
party addressees other than civil servants. The Claimant, having
described the activities of Mr Sharif as consultant for Niko, states with
respect to these payments:

As one would expect given this background, |...] the local bank
statements of Mr. Sharif reflect multiple payments associated with the
ordinary expenses of maintaining an office and fulfilling Stratum’s
role. 1320

A third group of payments identified by the Investigators is asserted to
consist of conduits for payments to a Government official. This latter

group of payments is referred to as Suspect Payments. These payments
are also understood to include payments for which there are no banking
or other records but which the Respondents assert were indeed made and
had corrupt purposes.

1793. In their Memorial on Corruption, the Respondents specifically focused
on the amount of US$2.93 million, which Niko paid to Sharif/Stratum in
October 2003 upon the completion of the JVA. Of this amount, as
discussed above, US$500,000 were paid to Bhuiyan/Nationwide. The
Respondents provided the following account for the remining US$2.43
million, stating that the Stratum UBP account

...shows outgoing payments to Mr. Sharif ($73,000 and $280,000),
Mr. Sharif’s counsel who formed Stratum ($319,000), Mr. Sharif’s wife
($413,000), a Houston auto importer ($69,000), Mr. Sharif’s company
with his brother ($200,000), and to individuals Mr. Sharif claims not
to know—Jabbar Abdul Majid ($57,000), Fazle Akber Siddique
($20,000), and Jamal Ahmed Shamsi ($180,000 to “DBTCO Americas
New York”). It is impossible to know how much of this movement was
done to distance Niko from the ultimate destination of the money.
These types of movements, or “layering”, are often used to make the
payments to officials untraceable. '5?!

1794. At the Hearing the Respondents also produced

(ij) Atable showing the payments referenced in the chart of Exhibit R-
320, both incoming and outgoing to and from the two UBP
accounts. !522 The table contained the note that “/pjayments beyond
the accounts shown, many of which could be in cash, would not be
reflected here”.

(ii) A table showing Payments Reflected in Financial Records; in this
table the Respondents highlighted those payments which they
considered as bribes or Suspicious Payments. !323 All payments are
recorded in US Dollars, the Taka payments being converted at the
rate of 52 Taka to the Dollar.

514

1795. The questions which the Tribunals addressed to the Parties after the
Hearing included the following ones for the Respondents concerning
specifically Suspect Payments:

3. The Respondents have shown on their Exhibits R-320 (referred
to at the hearing as the “Spider web”) and RH-17 payments (a) by
Niko to the UBP accounts of Mr Sharif (6207285) and Stratum
(6262120); (b) outgoing from these accounts, and have identified
which of the latter they consider as suspect. The Respondents are
invited:

3.1 to identify for each of the suspect payments its ultimate
addressee, the chain of payments (in the alleged “layered approach”)
leading to him/her and the supporting evidence.

1796. The Tribunals addressed a number of specific questions to the
Respondents concerning the payments by Mr Bhuiyan:

4. Specifically in relation to the payments that Respondents allege
were made by Mr Bhuiyan to Mr Mamoon and Minister Hossain, and
without restricting the generality of question 3, the Respondents are
invited to identify the evidence that they rely upon as establishing
that:

4.1. the payments were made;
4.2. they were derived from funds emanating from the Claimant;
4.3. they provided funds or a benefit in kind to a State official;

4.4. were made for the purpose of inducing BAPEX to conclude the
JVA and Petrobangla to conclude the GPSA; and

4.5. the Claimant knew or ought to have known that the payments
were made for this purpose and on its behalf.

1797. The Respondents dealt with the questions of the Tribunals at length in
their Post-Hearing Briefs, developing the argument they had presented in
the previous submissions. At one stage, they summarised their position:

In sum, the evidence shows that Niko paid almost US$ 5 million to
Stratum and Qasim Sharif, at least half a million of that went to Mr.
Bhuiyan (and then on to Mr. Mamoon and the State Minister), and
hundreds of thousands of dollars were distributed to others who were
either connected to decision makers (like Jahangir Chowdhury and
Babul Gazi) or could influence decisions (like Raihanul Abedin and

515

officials at the Law Ministry and Ministry of Energy). And much of
the almost $5 million is untraceable, and Claimant provided no
explanation, much less evidence, of its purpose.152+

1798. The statement was followed by a chart!?5 showing these payments:

 

1799. The Respondents also provided, at pp. 29 to 32 of their First Post-Hearing
Brief, a table of Suspect Payments in which further particular
information about the payments shown in the chart and some other
payments are provided.

1800. The Tribunals will examine the Respondents’ explanations concerning
these Suspect Payments to determine whether they were indeed made,
and, if made, were corrupt payments or must otherwise be taken as
support for the Respondents’ allegation of corruption, justifying the

Respondents’ assertion that the Agreements were procured by
corruption.

Some of the payments in the chart and the table are payments to Niko’s
consultants which the Respondents describe as “layering of
payments/ concealing bribe payments”.!5?© The Tribunals have discussed
above in Section 10 the Respondents’ argument concerning “layering”.
They were not persuaded that any of Niko’s consultants were engaged for
the purpose of “layering” in the sense used by the Respondents.

The Tribunals reserved, however, their position concerning the question
whether the consultants engaged by Niko used some of the funds paid by
Niko to make corrupt payments. This point will be addressed in the
present section, in light of the Tribunals’ conclusions concerning
Government Acts and the Related Corrupt Act(s) identified by the
Respondents at pp. 2 and 3 of their First Post-Hearing Brief and
discussed above in Section 9.

Before describing the Tribunals’ examination of specific allegedly corrupt
payments, it should be pointed out that this is the Respondents’

. main allegation of corruption: that Niko obtained Government
approval for the JVA and GPSA by bribing an agent of the Prime
Minister’s office (Giasuddin al Mamoon) and the State Minister for
Energy (Mosharraf Hossain).'327

The Respondents’ corruption allegations focus on what they described as
the corrupt regime of the Government during the BNP reign; a focus
which is also shared by the Investigators. The Respondents wrote:

Thus, under the new BNP Government, Niko used corruption for two
purposes: 1) to get the new Government to hear and consider its
proposal, and 2) to obtain what it wanted with regard to Chattak East
and avoid competition with other companies through the Swiss
Challenge process. 1528

With respect to the period of the Awami League Government, the
Respondents’ allegations focus more on what they describe as “layering”
and as Niko’s “network of so-called ‘consultants’ to promise and pay
bribes.” 1529 These allegations of layering have been examined above and
were found unsupported by the evidence. The allegations of specific
corrupt payments which shall be considered at present must be seen
against the background and the Tribunals’ findings in the above sections
of this decision.

Payments to Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury through his brother Jahangir

The Respondents allege that during the period from December 1999 to
November 2000 Mr Sharif made nine payments of US$6,000, a total of
US$54,000 to Jahangir Elahi Chowdhury. 1330

Mr Jahangir E. Chowdhury is Mr Sharif’s uncle and the brother of the
then-Secretary of Energy, 1/93! Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury. !382

The Respondents assert that the payments were intended for the
Secretary of Energy and describe the assistance which Niko drew from it
as:

Support for Niko’s unilateral proposal to develop marginal fields and
the FoU. 1333

and
... to push Niko’s proposal through;!334

The Respondents assert that this alleged payment “constitutes conspiracy
to cause, and the aiding and abetting of, violations of Sections 162, 163
and 165 of the Penal Code” .1335

Elsewhere, the Respondents include the Marginal Fields Procedure in the
Governmental Acts related to the alleged payments to Mr Tawfiq Elahi
Chowdhury. !336

In support of their allegations, the Respondents rely on the Joint
Investigation and specifically the conclusions of Ms LaPrevotte. They
explain:

These payments are on Agent LaPrevotte’s spider web, Flow Chart of
Payments from Niko Resources Limited (R-320). The payments are
outside the targeted period so they are not in the UBP statements of
Qasim Sharif’s account on the record (2001-2006), but they are in the
additional pages provided to Claimant.!337

Mr Sharif’s payments on these documents are directed to Mr Jahangir
Elahi Chowdhury, the uncle of Mr Sharif and the brother of the Secretary
of Energy. In order to establish the link to the Secretary, the Respondents
rely on the analysis of Ms LaPrevotte. In R-PHB1, they quote from her
witness statement:

The nine payments are important because I had [Mr Sharif]
interviewed by FBI in Texas and I had Mr Chowdhury's brother in
Australia interviewed and when interviewed they gave two different
answers. So we asked [Mr Sharif], ‘You sent nine $6,000 payments
to Mr Jahangir Chowdhury. What was the purpose behind these
payments?’ When asked he is like, ‘Oh, my mother, he would lend
money to my mother and I had to pay him back |...]. However, I sent
a lead to Australia asking the Australian Federal Police to interview
Mr Jahangir Chowdhury. When he was interviewed regarding those
same payments he is like, ‘Oh, I am a contractor for Stratum
Development and those payments were reimbursements to me for the
work that I did as a contractor to Stratum Development and for my
travel expenses’. [...] So one of the two -- either or both are providing
false statements during their interviews. That added to the
preponderance of evidence that indicated that $54,000 given to the
brother at the Ministry of Energy was likely bribe payments in
compensation for his favourable consideration. ”!938

1817.

In response, the Claimant first points out that there is no direct evidence
for the payments themselves. All that was produced is a “working table”
from a team member at the Bangladesh ACC and/or a “flowchart” drafted
at a meeting of the investigating agencies; for the Claimant this is merely
hearsay. 1339

The Claimant also points out that the Respondents have failed to show
that the payments had a purpose of corruption. If the Ultimate Addressee
of the payments, as alleged by the Respondents, was

... Tawfique Elahi Chowdhury, a former Secretary within the Energy
Ministry then, as noted in Niko’s Rejoinder, it is critical to note that
Tawfique Elahi Chowdhury is currently the most senior official with
the Energy Ministry sitting as the Honourable Advisor to the Prime
Minister. 1340

The Claimant also notes “that the Respondents failed to make [Mr
Tawfique Elahi Chowdhury] available as witness in these proceedings
(notwithstanding the presence of other officials from the Ministry at the
hearing)” .1341

More generally, the Claimant asserts that there is

no coherent case set out in the Respondents’ pleadings as to the
allegedly corrupt nature of the alleged payments to Jahagir Elahi
Chowdhury, much less is there any credible evidence to establish that
such alleged payments had anything to do with Niko or its
procurement of the JVA.1342

The Tribunals note that the Respondents have previously disputed that
any bribes were received by senior officials during the Awami League
Administration, an assertion which had led the Tribunals to fix the start
of the Targeted Period in 2001. At the hearing, the Respondents shifted
their approach. While accepting that they cannot prove that the FOU was
obtained by corruption, they made a global allegation, saying that all

explanations provided by two persons on 10 April and 15 May 2008, elsewhere identified as Mr Sharif and
his mother; practically all names in this document are redacted.

favourable treatment of Niko was obtained “by promises and payment of
bribes”:

THE PRESIDENT: Is it your case that FoU also was obtained by
bribery?

MS ARGUETA: It is our case that there are indications of that, that
there are suspicious payments, that Niko was involving agents from
very early on and making those payments to lay the groundwork that
eventually made it possible for them to get the JVA.

THE PRESIDENT: No, sorry, you have to tell us what we should
conclude from these suspicious payments. Is it your case that the FoU
was obtained by bribery?

MS ARGUETA: We cannot prove that the FoU was obtained by bribery.
It seems to be tainted by bribery. My case is that all of the favourable
treatment of Niko from this early date and through 2006 was obtained
by promises and payment of bribes. 1343

In their post-hearing submissions, the Respondents rely on the payments
to Mr Jahangir Elahi Chowdhury as Suspect Payments. The Tribunals
therefore have pursued their examination of this contention.

The Tribunals have noted the Claimant’s observation that, apart from the
entries in the Investigators’ tables, there is no evidence that the payments
were actually made. Assuming that the payments were indeed made to
Mr Jahangir Elahi Chowdhury, the Respondents assert that they were
intended for his brother Tawfiq, the then Secretary of Energy. The
Claimant has repeatedly asserted that Mr Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury
continues to be employed in Government, occupying a high position, and
this has not been denied by the Respondents. Neither Mr LaPrevotte, nor
the ACC or Mr Khan, nor the Respondents nor anyone at the Ministry
seem to have questioned Mr Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury about the alleged
payments to him through his brother; at least no information about such
questioning has been provided to the Tribunals.

Instead of directly enquiring with Mr Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury about the
alleged payments, the Respondents rely on Ms LaPrevotte’s indirect
approach and provide hearsay twice removed from direct evidence. As
shown in the above quotation on which the Respondents rely, Ms

1343 Tr. Day 1 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 76, I. 18 to p. 77, 1. 4.

521

LaPrevotte testifies not on what she heard from the alleged payor and
from the alleged payment recipient but on two interviews not conducted
by herself but rather by two unnamed persons. From what she heard
from these anonymous interviewers, Ms LaPrevotte understood that the
two persons gave conflicting answers about the purpose of the payments.
She concludes that “the preponderance of evidence” indicated that the
payments were a bribe.

1821. In the absence of any attempt to clarify the matter directly or
explanations why such an attempt was unsuccessful or unavailable to
the Investigators and the Respondents, the Tribunals consider reliance
on such an indirect approach to be insufficient.

1822. Assuming the Respondents had established that the payments were
intended for and actually made to Mr Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury, the
Respondents would have to establish that they were related to the Niko
project and procured the FOU, as alleged.

1823. In this respect, too, the Respondents rely on Ms LaPrevotte. In her first
witness statement she referred to the payments to the brother of Mr
Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury and observed:

These payments coincided with actions taken on behalf of Niko
Resources to approve, among other things, the Framework of
Understanding for the study for development and production of
hydrocarbon from the non-producing marginal gas fields of Chattak,
Feni and Kamta. There was probable cause to believe that these
payments were bribe/kickback payments in exchange for favorable
rulings for Niko.1344

1824. At the hearing, Ms LaPrevotte developed her view on the “probable cause”.
She presented her assumption that “in many ways the Niko tender or bid
was very similar to Siemens” !345 and explained:

Initially both companies to do a certain project within country were
deemed unqualified. So at that point I am just saying that was a
similarity I found in the two cases that I was investigating.

Then Niko takes a proposal to the State Energy Secretary, Mr
Chowdhury. From there, the similarities were that we saw on the

1344 LaPrevotte Witness Statement, paragraph 26.
1345 Tr. Day 3 (CONFIDENTIAL), pp. 166 to 169.

522

ground consultants hired, some who had experience in the field, some
who had no experience in gas oil exploration and in the one I am
comparing it to, Siemens, they hired three on the ground consultants
who had no background in telecoms.

Then as I continued to investigate the Niko investigation I found out
that Mr Chowdhury was providing influence. He was participating in
meetings over which he was working on the framework of
understanding.

There was a meeting in January 1999 over which Mr Chowdhury was
participating. There was a meeting in May 1999 over which Mr
Chowdhury was officiating. There was -- the FoU was signed I believe
in August 1999 and then my investigation showed that beginning in
November 1999 [Mr Sharif] starting making nine $6,000 payments
into a bank account in Singapore belonging to the brother of the
official. 1346

1825. Ms LaPrevotte also stated

Yes. In other words, Mr Chowdhury exerted influence at the January
'99, May '99 meetings where the framework of understanding was
being discussed and developed and was we think directly
responsible or one of the participants in that the FoU was approved
the August '99. Then in December his brother starts receiving nine
payments. 1347

1826. The Tribunals note first of all that these explanations are inconsistent
with the facts as the Tribunals have ascertained from the record and
explained above. The Niko project differs substantially from the Siemens
case, as it has been described in these Arbitrations; so do the Niko
consultants compared to the Siemens consultants, as described by the
Respondents and the Investigators.

1827. There is no evidence that the FOU was discussed at the meetings in
January and May 1999 to which Ms LaPrevotte refers. Indeed, as late as
25 May 1999, the letter in which the Ministry informs Petrobangla that it
may proceed with the Niko Proposal stated that a JVA must be executed
before a MOU may be signed. There is no indication of a shift from the
MOU approach to the requirement of an FOU and the Study.

As explained above in Section 9.2, the shift occurred only in May 1999.
The Niko representatives accepted BAPEX’s invitation and arrived in
Dhaka to sign the MOU; but BAPEX did not want to sign the MOU and
requested Niko instead first to conduct the Joint Study and only
thereafter to conclude the JVA.

In these circumstances it is difficult for the Tribunals to accept that Niko
would pay US$54,000 for being required, before proceeding with the
project, to conduct a technical study the costs of which it quantified in
the order of US$1.5 million.

The Tribunals conclude that the evidence produced does not justify
assuming that Niko paid US$54,000 to Mr Tawfiq Elahi Chowdhury
indirectly through his brother; in any event, even if such a payment had
been made, it did not procure the conclusion of the FOU by Niko.

Payments to lower level officials at the Ministry of Energy

In their “broad overview of government acts necessary for the conclusion
of the Agreements that were procured by corruption”, the Respondents
include

Mr Sharif’s payments to lower level officials at Ministry of Energy.

They relate these “corrupt acts” to the “Approval of Niko’s proposal to be
considered to develop marginal fields, FOU, and draft Procedure for
Development of Marginal/ Abandoned Gas Fields” .1348

The Claimant responds:

The allegation is hopelessly vague, and does not identify the amount
of the payments alleged to have been made, the date of such
payments, the recipients of such payment, or the alleged act induced
or procured from such recipients. 1349

1348 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 2, first box.
1349 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 17.

1834. The Respondents provide more detail elsewhere in their Post-Hearing
Brief. In particular, they state:

At the FOU stage, payments to lower level officials gave Niko access
to information about marginal fields, government policies, and its
proposal’s movement through the system, and provided Niko the
opportunity to promote itself as pre-qualified to negotiate the JVA.135°

1835. In support of their allegation about Mr Sharif’s payment to lower level
officials at the Ministry, the Respondents present a long extract from the
“deposition” of Mr Shafikul Islam, the former accountant of Mr Sharif:

Shafikul Islam helped Mr. Sharif with all his accounts. He told the
ACC: “Mr Qasim used to visit the country and then I used to visit
BAPEX, Petrobangla, and the Ministry to deliver Niko’s letters on his
behalf. Mr. Aslam of the Energy and Mineral Resources Division
would arrange the pass for me to enter the Secretariat. From before
my employment, Mr. Aslam was paid 5 thousand or sometimes 10
thousand takas per month. These payments were made several times
after my joining as well. [...] At the end of 2003, during the Eid period,
Mr Sayed Kabir in consultation with Qasim Sharif paid Taka three
and half lac to different staff and officers of the Ministry, BAPEX, and
Petrobangla. At that time Mr. Aslam was paid Taka 1 (one) lac. [...]
Around 2002 Mr. Sayed Kabir [...] started to communicate with Mr.
Qasim Sharif and used to take Mr. Sharif to BAPEX, Petrobangla,
Energy Ministry, Prime Minister’s Office etc. on behalf of the Canadian
High Commission. Mr. Sayed Kabir introduced Mr. Sharif to various
people at various places regarding the Niko agreement and advised
him to give cash and valuable gifts to various individuals.
Accordingly, Mr. Qasim Sharif [...] gave cash and gifts to those
individuals. ... [R-392]!35!

1836. The Claimant had already responded to some of Mr Islam’s allegations in
a previous submission: relying on the accounting records disclosed by
the Claimant in these Arbitrations, the Claimant asserts that

in November 2003, at the time of the Eid period, four representatives
of BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Ministry of Energy, all of whom
attended the Second Joint Management Committee (JMC) Meeting in
Calgary, Canada, were paid in cash by Qasim Sharif on behalf of
Niko for their per diem allotment (of US$170 per day) for

1350 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 58, last bullet.
1351 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 29.

525

transportation and lodging expenses in connection with attending the
JMC meeting.

1837. The Claimant produced vouchers and allowances for the period form 20
November to 7 December 2003. 1352

1838. More generally, the Claimant questions the reliability of Mr Islam’s
“deposition”, pointing to the circumstances of his interrogation and the
impossibility of testing his declarations, which the Claimant describes as
“hearsay” .1353

1839. The Tribunals note first of all that Mr Islam’s statements could not be
tested in the Arbitrations. Even if one discounts the Claimant’s
explanations about the pressure exercised on Mr Islam, his statements
must therefore be considered with caution. The Tribunals also note that
some of the payments mentioned in the transcript of what is described
as Mr Islam’s “deposition” have been explained by the Claimant without
being contradicted by the Respondents; they cannot be characterised as
bribes.

1840. The other group of payments with respect to which Mr Islam provides
specific statements concerns the “pass for [Mr Islam] to enter the
Secretariat’. The Tribunals cannot see how these payments could have
influenced the persons in the Ministry in charge of considering Niko’s
proposal.

1841. As to the Respondents’ allegation that Mr Sharif made payments which
“gave Niko access to information about marginal fields, government
policies, and its proposal’s movement through the system’,!°54 this
statement is not only vague and unsupported by reliable evidence, but it
also concerns information to which Niko must have had access as part of
the cooperation with BAPEX under the FOU or, more generally, in the
course of the JVA negotiations.

1842. In any event, the Niko project and the terms of the JVA were subject to a
broad process of analysis and were examined over many years and
considered in various committees by many high-ranking officials in the

1352 C-RC, paragraph 148 with reference to Niko Vouchers and Allowances, Exhibit C-208 (CONFIDENTIAL).

Ministry, in Petrobangla and in BAPEX. The Tribunals do not consider
that the mostly unidentified “low level officials” in the Ministry
made any effective contribution to the conclusion of the JVA.
Payment to any of them, if it were proven, has not been shown to
have procured that Agreement.

11.4.1 The evolution of the Respondents’ position

In their submissions before the Hearing, the criticism raised by the
Respondents against the Law Minister and the Law Ministry focused
primarily on the relationship of the Law Minister’s (former) law firm with
Niko and the conflict of interest in that context. In their Reply on
Corruption the Respondents also raised a corruption allegation to the
effect that

There is also evidence that Niko gave Mr. Noren Das, the Senior
Assistant Secretary at the Law Ministry a laptop worth about
$1,200. 1355

and

Niko also bribed the Senior Assistant Secretary at the Law Ministry
with an expensive laptop worth more than five times the average
monthly salary of government officers at the time.135°

At the hearing, the Respondents then clarified that the Law Ministry’s
opinion was not obtained by corruption:

There is no claim made by the Respondents about this opinion having
been obtained as a result of corruption. The only thing that the
Respondents have advanced with respect to this opinion is that it was
obtained when the Minister had a conflict of interest.1357

In their Post-Hearing submissions, the Respondents, nevertheless, make
allegations of corruption. The Respondents identify as bribes the gift of a
laptop to an official at the Law Ministry and the relations between Niko

and the law firm of the Minister, before and during the time he held the
office as Law Minister.

On the chart at p. 34 of the Respondents’ First Post-Hearing Brief, the
Respondents identify as corrupt payments: “unknown amount & Laptop”
to “Ministry of Energy and Law Ministry”. It appears from the table at p.
29 that the laptop relates to the Law Ministry: “Niko [...] presented the
Law Ministry officer, Mr Noren Das, with a laptop worth BDT 75
thousand’ .1358 Reference is made to the statement of Mr Shafikul Islam
of 12 March 2018. 1359

The Respondents also assert that

payment to the Law Minister’s law firm contributed to the Law
Minister adopting Niko’s views on Chattak East and Swiss Challenge
with no analysis and no consideration of norms and procedures
requiring competitive bidding;!3®°

In their Second Post-Hearing Submission the Respondents assert that
“(tlhe Law Minister’s opinion was tainted by corruption’!:6! and
“[cJorruption is the only explanation for the Law Minister’s disregard of the
considered views of other officials and his unreasonable and extreme
position favouring Niko” . 1362

The alleged acts of corruption consist in the gift of the laptop and the
engagement of the Moudoud Ahmed law firm.

After ending its engagement with Moudud Ahmed’s law firm in 2000
and failing to pay outstanding invoices for over a year, suddenly
rehiring his law firm and paying his outstanding fees when he was
appointed Law Minister and then procuring a legal opinion from the
Law Minister’s firm that the Government was prohibited from
subjecting Niko’s proposed JVA to competitive bidding. !5®

acts in contravention of the Bangladesh Penal Code, the Prevention of
Corruption Act, and the 2002 Anti-Money Laundering Act:

[oJ

Bribing various other Government officials [...] as well as the purchase
of a laptop for the Law Ministry. This constitutes conspiracy to cause,
and the aiding and abetting of violations of Sections 161 and 165 by
the various Government officials and violations of Sections 162 and
163 by Mr. Sharif.

Engaging the private law firm of Law Minister Moudud Ahmed, and
seeking to influence him by, inter alia, paying a long-overdue balance
constitutes conspiracy to cause, and the aiding and abetting of
violations of Sections 161 and 165 by the Law Minister. It is also
aiding and abetting Sections 162 and 163 violations by the Law
Minister’s law firm and partners as it relates to their exercise of
influence over him.136+

The Tribunals have examined the conflict of interest aspect of these
allegations above in Section 9.7.3. They pointed out the systematic
confusion of the Respondents between the Law Ministry and the Minister
and saw no basis for assuming that the Ministry’s opinions were affected
by irregularity with respect to professional ethics obligations or by a
conflict of interest. The Tribunals now examine the Respondents’ bribery
allegations, treating separately the laptop allegedly provided to Mr Das
and Niko engaging and paying the Minister’s law firm.

11.4.2 The laptop to Mr Das

Mr Naren Das was Deputy Secretary at the Ministry of Law. The
Respondents’ assertion concerning the gift of a laptop to him relies on a
statement by Mr Shafikul Islam. His “deposition” on 12 March 2008 in
the ACC investigation states that “the then Commercial Executive of Niko,
Mr. Masudur Rahman, presented the Law Ministry officer, Mr. Noren Das,
with a laptop worth BDT 75 thousand”. 1365

As pointed out above, the Respondents view this gift as a “bribe”.

The Claimant pointed out that the matter had been investigated by the
ACC. The Claimant produced correspondence with the ACC concerning
the purchase of a laptop at the price of BDT 75,000, invoiced at 11
December 2003. 1366 The Claimant points out that the case of Mr Das and
the laptop is dealt with in the ACC Charge Sheet. The ACC determined
that there was no evidence of a link with the conclusion of the JVA and
treated the matter as a “contravention of service rules”:

It is noticed in this case that the Deputy Secretary of the Ministry of
Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Mr Naren Das received a
laptop [...] from Mr Quashem Sharif who was Vice-President of the
beneficiary Company (Niko Resources Ltd). Although no evidence was
obtained to indicate that their influence has worked behind the
conclusion of the said JVA, accepting laptop [...] as gift is considered
to be in contravention of service rules. !967

The Claimant disputes that the gift of the laptop was somehow corrupt.
It points out that it took place in December 2003. It denies any
connection between the gift to Mr Das and the conclusion of the JVA in
October 2003. 1368

The Tribunals note that the conclusion of the ACC with respect to Mr
Das suggest that the gift of the laptop was not considered by them as a
case of bribery.

In any event, there is no indication that Mr Das was involved in any
manner in the opinions of the Law Ministry or that the gift was related to
these opinions. The Tribunals see no reason to doubt the conclusion of
the ACC when it saw no evidence for a link between the laptop and the
conclusion of the JVA.

The Tribunals conclude that there is no basis for assuming that the
delivery of the laptop to Mr Das constitutes a “conspiracy” or that it
justifies doubts as to the regularity of the opinions of the Law
Ministry and had any impact on the conclusion of the JVA.

11.4.3 Niko engaging and paying the Law Minister’s (former) law firm

 

The Respondents’ criticism concerning relations between Niko and the
law firm of Moudud Ahmed and Associates is summarised in the
Respondents’ First Post-Hearing Brief:

Niko’s use of and payment to the then-Law Minister’s law firm for
arguments in support of Niko’s position on Chattak East and Swiss
Challenge, which Niko delivered to the State Minister, who then
sought he opinion of the Law Ministry. !5°9

The Claimant responded:

Niko’s use of the Law Minister’s former firm was a pre-existing
solicitor-client relationship conducted in a wholly transparent
manner, and there is no evidence of any financial benefit passing to
the Law Minister, or even any involvement on the Law Minister’s part
in the legal opinions rendered to the Government by the Law Ministry
(which legal opinions have not been disclosed or put into the record
by the Respondents in any event).197°

The Claimant refers to earlier explanations where it asserted that “Niko
had absolutely no input into the decision of the Government to seek an
opinion from the Law Ministry”; it pointed out that the suggestion to seek
such an opinion emanated from BAPEX.!37! It added that “Niko made no
secret of its use of a barrister from Moudud Ahmed and Associates; indeed,
it disclosed and explicitly relied on those opinions in its dealings with
BAPEX, Petrobangla and the Ministry” .1372

The Respondents also refer to two payments by Niko to the Moudud
Ahmed and Associates law firm in 2002, one for US$6,000 the other for
US$8,250, after Mr Ahmed had become Minister. !373

The Claimant explains that the first payment was the retainer for the
second semester in the year 2000; the allegation concerning this matter
was not pursued later in the Arbitrations.

The Claimant further explain that the second payment concerned an
invoice from December 2000. As its payment had been delayed, “Mr Azizul
Haq of Moudud Ahmed & Co followed up with Niko in January 2002 to
obtain payment of the overdue account. Following this reminder of the
outstanding account, Niko promptly paid the full amount on or around 14
January 2002”.1374

The Respondents rely on this second payment and assert that Niko
“suddenly rehirfed] and pay[ed] his outstanding fees”.!575 On this basis
they argue that Niko “seeking to influence him by, inter alia, paying a long-
overdue balance constitutes conspiracy”.1376

More generally the Respondents argue that

payment to the Law Minister’s law firm contributed to the Law
Minister adopting Niko’s views on Chattak East and Swiss Challenge
with no analysis and no consideration of norms and procedures
requiring competitive bidding;!37”

The Tribunals have examined as far as they could the circumstances of
the payment of what seems to have been an overdue invoice. They note
that this payment was made immediately upon a reminder from the law
firm. The Tribunals find it difficult to see a “conspiracy” in such a
payment upon a reminder of an overdue invoice. If by that time Mr Ahmad
was still following the affairs of his (former) law firm, which has not been
established or even alleged by the Respondents, he may have been
pleased that this outstanding invoice of US$8,250 was paid. From there
to treating this payment of the outstanding invoice as a conspiracy to
exercise influence over the Law Minister requires a leap of imagination
for which the Tribunals see no basis in the record. This all the less since
in January 2002, when the invoice was paid, there was no suggestion of
submitting the controversial issues to the Law Ministry.

Concerning the legal opinion which Niko obtained from the Moudud
Ahmad and Associates law firm in August 2002 and February 2003 (see
above Section 9.7.3), the Respondents’ argument does not appear clear.

1374 C-RC, paragraph 71, referring to Letter from Moudud Ahmed and Associates to Qasim Sharif, 9 January
2002, Exhibit R-399 (CONFIDENTIAL) and Letter from Moudud Ahmed and Associates to Qasim Sharif, 9

1873.

The firm had been engaged with a retainer for the entire year 2000,
during the rule of the Awami League Government, in which Mr Ahmad
was not a Minister. Niko engaged the law firm again for two legal opinions
on the two critical issues for its project. It did so openly and produced
these opinions to the Minister who forwarded them to Petrobangla and
BAPEX.

The Respondents assert that payment to the Law Minister’s law firm
[presumably for the opinions] contributed to the Law Minister adopting
Niko’s views. The opinions were prepared in August 2002 and in
February 2003, before the Law Ministry (not the Law Minister) was
consulted about the Chattak issue in March 2003. If the opinions
presented by Niko contributed to the formation of the opinion of the Law
Ministry, this was not Niko’s doing.

Indeed, as explained above, the Chattak issue was referred to the Law
Ministry not at the suggestion of Niko nor upon “pressure from the State
Minister’ but at the suggestion of BAPEX, with the support of Petrobangla
and the Energy Ministry (see above Section 9.7.2).

This suggestion was made shortly after Niko had submitted the opinion
which the Mouodud Ahmed and Associates law firm had prepared for it.
In other words, in March 2003, when the matter was referred to the Law
Ministry, at the suggestion of BAPEX and with the agreement of
Petrobangla, the Respondents knew that the Moudud Ahmed and
Associates law firm had been engaged by Niko. There is no trace of any
evidence that this had caused any hesitations or concern to the
Respondents.

The Tribunals, indeed see no irregularity or ground for concern in
Niko’s payments to Moudud Ahmed and Associates law firm in
connection with the JVA and in the use by Niko of the legal opinions
prepared by this firm.

It is significant for the Respondents’ Corruption Claim brought in these
Arbitrations that the relationship between the Moudud Ahmed and
Associates law firm and Niko, which was no cause for concern of the
Respondents at the time, now is relied upon to accuse Niko of criminal
offenses and conspiracy and as a major ground for seeking the avoidance
of the JVA.

Payments to the State Minister

In their overview of the “government acts necessary for the conclusion of
the Agreements that were procured by corruption”, the Respondents
identify the

State Minister’s grant of access to Niko, efforts and instructions to
Petrobangla to finalise the JVA with Chattak East and to avoid Swiss
Challenge and approval of the JVA.

As the corresponding corrupt act the Respondents identify

Niko’s promise to pay (and eventual payment to) the State Minister
through deals with Mr Mamoon and Mr Bhuiyan.

They also mention the opinions which Niko obtained from the “then-Law
Minister’s law firm’ which “Niko delivered to the State Minister who then
sought the opinion of the Law Minister” .1378

In the chart at p. 34 of the Respondents’ First Post-Hearing Brief, the
Respondents show a payment from Mr Sharif to Mr Bhuiyan in the
amount of US$500,000 and from Mr Bhuiyan to the State Minister of
Energy in the amount of US$100,000; the State Minister is identified as
“Ultimate Recipient’.

The Respondents go on to identify acts related to the JVA that were
procured by Niko’s allegedly corrupt payments, and include in that list
the following:

the promise of payments to the State Minister (which were eventually
made) caused him to give his approval to the JVA and seek the Prime
Minister’s approval without doing Swiss Challenge and take up Niko’s
cause and push Petrobangla and BAPEX to accept Niko’s terms
(including Chattak East), to seek legal opinions from Niko’s former
lawyer, the Law Minister, that would go against the views of BAPEX
and Petrobangla;!879

1879.

1880.

1881.

1882.

The Claimant’s direct response to the Respondents’ identification of
government acts procured by corruption is that:

There is no credible evidence of such promise or payment to the State
Minister and the allegation depends purely on an alleged “confession”
that has no evidentiary weight. 138°

The payment in issue here amounts, as shown in the chart, to some
US$100,000, which Mr Bhuiyan is said to have paid to the State Minister
after the conclusion of the JVA in BDT “at different times in different
amounts” in a total of 60 lakh.

The Parties have repeatedly and thoroughly debated these payments and
their circumstances in their submissions. Their differences relate
essentially to (i) the value that can be attributed to the Bhuiyan
Confession and, related thereto, (ii) the question whether a promise of
payment was made to the State Minister, (iii) whether the payments were
actually made and were in relation to the JVA and (iv) whether the
payments, if promised and made, procured the governmental acts, as
alleged by the Respondents. The Tribunals will examine these issues in
turn in the following section.

11.5.1 The Bhuiyan Confession and its retraction

A central role in the Respondents’ case is played by a document entitled
“Sworn Statement” by Mr Bhuiyan, dated 15 January 2008 and recording
what is described as his confession. The Tribunals refer to this document
as the Bhuiyan Confession, without thereby expressing an opinion on the
nature of the document and the circumstances in which the statements
recorded in it were obtained. Given its importance for the Respondents’
case, the Tribunals start by quoting this statement in full. The document
records that the statement was made before a Magistrate and describes
the circumstances under which the statement was made, including Mr
Bhuiyan’s prior arrest and the explanations given by the Magistrate. It
then records the Sworn Statement:

Ex Energy Minister A.K. M. Mosharraf is our family friend for a long
time. I studied with his brother-in-law Mr. Irfan at the same time at
Dhaka University. Icame to know Mr. Mosharraf through him. In 2001

1380 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), p. 18.

535

after becoming State Minister, Mr. Mosharraf introduced me to Mr.
Gias Uddin Al Mamoon telling me that he is a special friend of Tarique
Rahman. I have been associated with Dhaka Club for a long time.

Mr. Mamoon was also a member of Dhaka Club and he used to play
golf with me.

Sometime in 2002 Mr. Mamun asked me to go to his office during mid
day. When I reached there I saw someone already present in his
office. Mr. Mamun introduced me to him telling that he is Quashem
Sharif; Vice President of NIKO, Bangladesh. Mr. Quashem said NIKO
was trying to enter into agreements with Bangladesh Government,
with BAPEX to explore gas from three gas fields. Mr. Quashem said
that he has had an understanding with Mr. Mamoon on the matter. I
then proposed to Mr. Quashem that if NIKO gets the work for gas
exploration, then they can give some sub contract to our organization
such as Gas Pipe Line, Gas Station etc. On the basis of my proposal
Mr. Quashem asked me to cooperate with NIKO to get the work. Then
he explained the understanding with Mr. Mamoon on the works and
they are as follows:

1) Assistance for completion of one Joint Venture Agreement (JVA)
for Kamta, Chatok, Feni- Gasfields and help to get various
Government approvals at different stages Mr. Mamun will help NIKO.

2) After commercial production of Feni gasfield Mr. Mamoon will
help NIKO to get approval for gas purchase and sales agreement
(GPSA)

3) After commercial production of Chatok gasfield Mr. Mamoon will
help NIKO to get approval for GPSA.

Mr. Mamoon and Mr. Quashem requested me to help and assist them
to make above things successful. Mr. Quashem Sharif said if we are
successful in completing above things then we will be commercially in
profit. He said that if above work is completely successful NIKO will
give Mr. Mamun six (6) crore Taka and 240 thousand US Dollar at
three stages.

Three crore Taka after completion of Joint Venture agreement; just
after signing of GPSA for Feni Gasfield 10 thousand US Dollar per
month for 24 months totaling 240 thousand US Dollar, and after
commercial exploration of Chatok Gasfield and signing of GPSA 3
(three) crore Taka. On the above proposal, as a businessman on
commercial point of view I agreed to assist. After one week of this
event, Mr. Mamoon and I went to the ex-Energy State Minister Mr.
Mosharraf’s House, and Mr. Mamun explained full subject to State

536

minister and sought help from him. Ex-State Minister after listening
assured his help to his best abilities. Thereafter I used to contact with
Mr. Mosharraf regularly on this subject and he used to say that the
work is in the process. Mr. Mamoon also used to keep in touch with
him regularly, and follow up with him. In 2003, the Joint Venture
Agreement was signed after long negotiation, and after negotiation
between BAPEX and NIKO. After that as per promise from NIKO, they
deposited 3 crore Taka in my account at Standard Chartered Bank in
Gulshan branch at different times. At different times in various
amounts Mr. Quashem Sharif deposited total of 3 crore Taka in my
account. From that money I gave Mr. Mamoon 80 lac Taka by one pay
order and at different times in different sums paid by cash cheque 1
crore Taka. I gave Mr. Mamun total 180 lac Taka. From the money
deposited in my account, I paid the Ex-State Minister Mr.
Mosharraf, at different times in different amounts, total 60 lac
in cash. The balance of 60 lac Taka I kept for my work. It is worth
mentioning here that Mr. Mammon had said to me that he is keeping
the majority portion of the taka because Tarique Rahman is also with
him. 1381

with the State Minister which relate to the Canadian conviction, his
Confession states:

In June 2005, Mr. Mosharraf resigned from the Ministership. Up to
then GPSA for Feni Gasfield and GPSA for Chatok Gasfield was not
signed and commercial exploration of Chatok Gasfield was not
commenced. So, NIKO refused to give the rest of the promised amount
of 240,000 US Dollars and 3 (three) crore Taka. Meaning, they did not
give more than 3 crore Taka.

All the above mentioned transactions were done as per direction and
management of Mr. Mamoon. As a businessman for business reasons
in the hope of getting business, I was involved with the above
business. In this case, I had no other involvement other than
business. This is my sworn statement. 1382

The Tribunals have highlighted in this statement the passage about the
payment to the State Minister which is particularly relevant here.

In June 2008, Mr Bhuiyan wrote a letter to the court, referenced as
“Withdrawal of confessionary statement under Section 164 given against

1381 Bhuiyan Statement, 15 January 2008, Exhibit R-324, pp. 3-6 (emphasis added).
1382 Bhuiyan Statement, 15 January 2008, Exhibit R-324, p. 7

my will on 15.01.2008”. The letter describes the circumstances of Mr
Bhuiyan’s arrest and of his declaration before the Magistrate. He
explained that he was promised release from arrest if he made a
statement that had been drafted for him and continued

. I was taken before the magistrate in a fully devastated and
mentally imbalanced condition following the torture at the
Cantonment police station. In the office of the honorable magistrate, I
could see the same typed statement on the table of the honorable
magistrate that I was given earlier to memorise. Then, I recited the
false and concocted memorised statement to save my life, but later it
was found that they breached their promise by making the prayer in
handwriting on the prayer for record of statement under Section 164
dated 15.01.2008 for sending me to jail custody and accordingly I
was sent to jail.

Immediately after giving this forced false self-confessionary
statement, I expressed my desire to withdraw this statement.
Members of the joint forces team subsequently met and threatened
me in different manners in the jail and the hospital during my
treatment for a total three days. They threatened me saying they
would sue members of my family. For this reason, I could not
withdraw earlier.

Today, I hereby withdraw the false confessionary statement obtained
by force on 15.01.2008 before this honorable Court.'383

11.5.2 The credibility of Mr Bhuiyan’s confession

1886. The Claimant discusses in detail the circumstances of Mr Bhuiyan’s
interrogation, his prior arrest, and his allegations of torture. It refers to
the circumstances recited in Mr Bhuiyan’s retraction and presents
another letter which Mr Bhuiyan wrote on 19 April 2009 to the Deputy
Commissioner, District of Dhaka, repeating the charges of torture. 1984+
The Claimant also recites the incident of one of Niko’s local employees
who “was also seized by the Bangladesh authorities and subjected to
torture, in an effort to procure a ‘confession’ of corruption from him’. And it
quotes from reports by Human Rights Watch and the U.S. State
Department “of unlawful detention and torture by the Joint Task Forces in
Bangladesh during the same period”. 1385

The Claimant concludes:

As Mr. Bhuiyan did not testify in these proceedings, the Tribunals
have no means to weigh the relative credibility of the conflicting
(hearsay) accounts in his “confession” and his retraction. That said,
in Niko’s respectful submission, the Tribunal has more reason to
discount the “confession” based on the significant evidence of torture
and unlawful detention surrounding its preparation. !38°

The Respondents refer to another document, presented as “Bangladeshi
Investigators’ Notes on Selim Bhuiyan Interview”.!387 The author of the
notes is not identified and the surrounding circumstances of the
interview are not revealed. In any event, with respect to the payment by
Mr Bhuiyan to the State Minister its recital is practically identical to the
Confession.

The Respondents rely on the testimony of Ms LaPrevotte as confirmation
of Mr Bhuiyan’s confession:

FBI Special Agent LaPrevotte and two U.S. Department of Justice
attorneys interviewed Mr. Bhuyian and he told them the same
information as relayed in his confession voluntarily and with no
duress; Special Agent LaPrevotte determined that the statements of
Mr. Mamoon and others as well as the movement of money confirm
Mr. Bhuyian’s confession. 1588

In her second witness statement, Ms LaPrevotte did indeed explain that
in September 2008 she and an attorney of the U.S. Department of Justice
interviewed Mr Bhuiyan in Bangladesh, at a time when he was not
detained. She informed him that the interview was voluntary and he
could leave at any time. She added:

In our interview, Bhuiyan confirmed that he received approximately
$500,000 USD from Niko and from those funds paid Mamoon (who he
believed would share with people close to Prime Minister Khaleda Zia,
and her son Tarique Rahman) and State Minister Mosharraf. The
information Mr. Bhuiyan provided to us in that interview was
consistent with the statement he gave before a Bangladeshi judge, fit

with what we were told in other interviews, and was supported by
the financial transactions. !389

The Claimant questions the reliability of this evidence of Ms LaPrevotte,
in particular by reference to her testimony at the hearing. It describes the
statements as hearsay and points out that, when declaring that Mr
Bhuiyan’s statement were “exactly similar” to those of his confession, Ms
LaPrevotte was working solely from her memory. She testified that notes
had been taken of her interview, but the notes could not be found. The
Claimant points out, “these were the only interview notes that the FBI had
been unable to find” .139°

The Claimant also points out that, at the hearing, Ms LaPrevotte on two
occasions described the points on which the confession coincided with
Mr Bhuiyan’s explanations in the interview;!°9! this description
mentioned a number of aspects of the confession but “notably, she did
not assert at any point during the account she gave in her testimony that
Mr Bhuiyan had admitted to her that he had made any payments to
Mosharraf Hossein ...”199?

Finally, the Claimant points out that during the FBI interview “officers
from the Bangladesh Joint Task Force” were present. In his retraction Mr
Bhuiyan had identified officers from the Joint Task Force as having
detained and tortured him. 1993

Ms LaPrevotte accepted at the Hearing that “a confession procured after
five days of interrogation in the face of a subsequent claim of torture [was]
worthy of further investigation”, and that she “did do a full
investigation” .139+ The Tribunals find it therefore all the more regrettable
that the record of the interview of Mr Bhuiyan she conducted is
unavailable.

When at the Hearing she gave the account of the points on which the
Bhuiyan Confession in her view coincided with what Mr Bhuiyan told her
in the interview, the payment to the State Minister was not mentioned. It

is true that she was not asked specifically about this point; nevertheless,
the fact that she did not mention this critically important matter as part
of the account she volunteered is not without significance. The account
that Ms LaPrevotte gave in her oral testimony is rather carefully confined
to facts that the Tribunals have already found to be correct, that is to
say:

e Mr Bhuiyan shared his profits with Mr Mamoon;1!995

e Mr Bhuiyan was working with the Niko agent (Mr Sharif) and Mr
Mamoon; 1396

e “[Hje was paid to try to get favourable treatment for Niko and he
took them to Minister Hossain’s office.” 1897

These are the matters that Ms LaPrevotte deposes were stated in Mr
Bhuiyan’s statement and were Validated by additional evidence.’!598 They
do not include the claim made in her witness statement that Mr Bhuyian
made a payment to Mr Mosharraf Hossein, the State Minister.

Finally, the Tribunals note that the Respondents have not produced any
records of the interrogations of the State Minister. Mr Mosharraf Hossein
is among the persons listed in the ACC Charge Sheet and he must have
been interrogated. The Respondents have produced “Bangladeshi
Investigators’ Notes on Selim Bhuiyan Interview”; they have not produced
a similar document of the alleged recipient of the payments mentioned in
Mr Bhuiyan’s confession.

The Tribunals have found that the allegations about the corrupt
apparatus through a network of consultants set up by Niko since it
entered Bangladesh were unsupported by the evidence; they also found
that none of the specifically alleged corrupt payments supported the
claim of a corrupt procurement of the JVA. The statement in the Bhuiyan
Confession about the payment to the State Minister thus remains as a
central piece of the Respondents’ Corruption Claim.

In the Confession, the relevant statement consists in a single sentence,
declaring that Mr Bhuiyan used the money received from Mr Sharif to
make several payments to the State Minister. Neither the Parties nor the
Tribunals had the possibility in these Arbitrations to seek clarification
about the circumstances of these alleged payments. The Confession
states that several payments in a total of 60 lac were made, in amounts
and at times unspecified. There is no information about the relation of
these payments with other financial transactions which, according to Mr
Chowdhury, Mr Bhuiyan carried out for Mr Hossain. 1399

The Claimant points out that the Confession was not written in Mr
Bhuiyan’s hand but, as stated in his retraction, he had been presented
with a pre-prepared statement by the Joint Task Force officers and
instructed to memorise it.!400

The Claimant points to the testimony of Mr Chowdhury who “saw no
other instances of corrupt activity or even attempted corrupt activity within
the Energy Ministry under Mosharraf Hossain during his tenure”.!401
Indeed, at the Hearing, Mr Chowdhury asserted that Mr Hossain’s alleged
corrupt activity occurred “Before. It all occurred before he became
Minister.” 1402

There is no indication in the Bhuiyan Confession or elsewhere that Niko
and/or Mr Sharif engaged Mr Bhuiyan to make any payments to the State
Minister; and there is no indication that Mr Bhuiyan made any promises
to the State Minister. The account in the Bhuiyan Confession about the
initial meeting with the State Minister about the Niko project and about
other contacts prior to the conclusion of the JVA make no mention of any
promises nor of a “deal” as alleged by the Respondents.

For all these reasons, the Tribunals have serious doubts about the
reliability of the Bhuiyan Confession. Despite these concerns and
doubts the Tribunals have considered the Bhuiyan Confession and

1389 Mr Chowdhury said that it was well known that Mr Bhuiyan “was the Minister’s money man”; Witness
Statement, paragraph 12.

examined the consequences for JVA if the statement about this payment
were true.

11.5.3 Causation

For the reasons already explained above, it is, for the purposes of the
Tribunals’ task in these Arbitrations in any event necessary to consider
whether, on the assumption for this purpose, that a payment was made
to the State Minister, it caused the conclusion of the JVA.

The Tribunals have examined the steps that led to the conclusion of the
JVA. They noted that the Niko project was supported by BAPEX and
Petrobangla, essential aspects were agreed in the FOU and the regulatory
basis laid in the Marginal Fields Procedure in June 2001. The obstacle
that remained at the time when the State Minister came into power and
the agreements with Mr Bhuiyan were concluded was the Chattak issue,
and, if it had remained a serious concern, !4°3 possibly the requirement
of applying the Swiss Challenge method.

It may be that the State Minister made attempts to overcome these
obstacles. Mr Chowdhury testified in this sense. If the State Minister did
so, he was not successful. Indeed, BAPEX and Petrobangla remained firm
on Chattak East and possibly also on the requirement of Swiss Challenge
until the joint meeting in March 2003. By that time the solution came
from the Law Ministry. The Respondents present this as a principal
corrupt act.

Niko’s use of and payment to the then-Law Minister’s law firm for
arguments in support of Niko’s position on Chattak East and Swiss
Challenge, which Niko delivered to the State Minister, who then
sought the opinion of the Law Minister. 140+

This is inaccurate or at least misleading. The recourse to the Law
Ministry, as shown above, came at the suggestion of BAPEX. Both the
Chattak issue and the Swiss Challenge issue were resolved by the
opinions of the Law Ministry; and the consequenct adaptation of the
contract terms was achieved in negotiations between BAPEX and
Petrobangla with Niko (and in terms favourable to the former). The terms

1908.

of the JVA, including their adaptation during the final negotiations after
the resolution of the Chattak issue, were determined by BAPEX and Niko,
not by the State Minister. The proposal to conclude the JVA submitted to
the Prime Minister came from Petrobangla. Passing this proposal on, with
a summary of preparatory steps, was a formality which cannot be taken
as causal for the conclusion of the JVA.

In light of these circumstances the Tribunals are unable to accept the
Respondents’ allegation in relation to payments to the State Minister. The
Tribunals conclude that the JVA was not procured by corrupt
payments to the State Minister.

11.6 Tarique Rahman and the Prime Minister

1909.

1910.

1911.

In the chart at p. 34 of the Respondents’ First Post-Hearing Brief, the
Respondents show a payment from Mr Sharif to Mr Bhuiyan in the
amount of US$500,000 and one from Mr Bhuiyan to Mr Giasuddin Al
Mamoon in the amount of US$300,000. In addition, the chart shows a
payment in an unspecified amount directly from Mr Sharif to Mr
Mamoon. Mr Tarique Rahman appears with a link between Mr Mamoon
and him, identified as “shared”. Both Mr Mamoon and Mr Rahman are
marked as “Ultimate Recipient’. No link is shown on the chart to the Prime
Minister.

The Respondents’ table showing the government acts procured by
corruption identifies the “Prime Minister’s approval of the JVA” as being
procured by

Niko’s deal with Mr Mamoon, the friend and business partner of
Tarique Rahman, when the two were collecting “consultancy fees” in
exchange for favorable treatment from the Prime Minister’s office.14°5

Later in their First Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondents identify this act,
related to the JVA, as being procured by Niko’s corrupt payments in the
following terms:

payments and the promise of additional payment to Mr. Mamoon
caused him to tell Tarique Rahman and others that the project should
go forward, causing the Prime Minister’s Office to “approve” the JVA

1405 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 4.

1912.

1913.

1914.

before the final draft was agreed and the need for Swiss Challenge
had been overcome, outside the normal procedures described by Mr.
Chowdhury; 1406

The Claimant contests the allegation. It points out:

In short, the Respondents have failed to prove any material
involvement of Giasuddin Al-Mamoon in connection with the JVA. But
even if they had proven such involvement, it would not have advanced
their case, because there is no evidence that he engaged Tarique
Rahman in relation to Niko’s affairs, much less that Mr. Rahman in
turn exercised improper influence over any government official to
secure approval of the JVA.1407

The Tribunals note that the Respondents indeed did not offer any direct
evidence for a payment by or on behalf of Niko to Mr Rahman, or to the
Prime Minister. The Respondents rely on explanations concerning the
central role of Mr Rahman in the political system of Bangladesh at the
time and on close relations of Mr Mamoon with Tarique Rahman and
their business cooperation. The Respondents conclude that any payment
to Mr Mamoon would have to be shared by him with Mr Rahman.

The Respondents cite statements about Mr Rahman’s role and
importance, like that of Ms LaPrevotte:

Front-men, like Giasuddin al Mamoon |...] serve as intermediaries to
channel money from companies to the sons of people in power, like
Tarique Rahman and other adult children of government ministers
who then exercise political influence to ensure contracts are awarded
to the paying company. Companies seeking contracts in Bangladesh
hire these intermediaries as “consultants” even though they often
have no expertise in the relevant field (such as telecommunications,
hydropower, or oil and gas) and use them as the conduits for bribes
because of their well-known connections to family members of public
officials. 1408

1407 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 46.
1408 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 46, quoting from LaPrevotte First Witness Statement, paragraph

14.

545

1915. The Respondents assert that Mr Mamoon and Tarique Rahman “were the
power base in Khaleda Zia’s administration” 1409 and state:

... any business during that political regime required permission from
the Prime Minister's Secretariat, and it was not possible to get
approval without the involvement of Mamoon or a family member or
family friends of the then Prime Minister.141°

1916. As evidence that payments to Mr Mamoon were shared with Mr Rahman,
the Respondents rely on the explanations of Mr Khan and insist on the
close relations between the two. They refer to the statement recorded in
the transcript of his RCMP interrogation where Mr Mamoon attributed
the importance of his role in business to his connection with Mr Rahman:

I’m the friend of Tarique RAHMAN |...], he in good position in party [...]
So obviously because Tarique RAHMAN is a powerful law so I’m his
best friend. |...] My power is say, my power is fifty percent, [...] I’m
fifty, because of, I’m the friend of Tarique RAHMAN. '*11

1917. The Respondents also write:

Niko approached and paid Mr. Mamoon, understanding such money
would reach Tarique Rahman. As Mr. Khan explained, investigators
found that Mr. Mamoon “was sharing” all the bribes he received with

Tarique Rahman; he was “the banker front for Tarique Rahman.”!412

1918. The link from Mr Rahman to the Prime Minister is assumed on the basis
of the family ties and of Mr Rahman’s overall powerful position. Thus, the
Respondents assert:

That money reached the Minister with authority to approve Niko’s
contracts and, through Mr. Mamoon, certainly reached the son of the
Prime Minister, who held the power to withhold or grant the Prime
Minister’s approval for Niko’s agreements. !413

1919. The Respondents quote in particular Mr Khan’s testimony at the hearing:

1409 R-MC, paragraph 72.

1410 R-MC, paragraph 124, quoting from Bhuiyan Statement, Exhibit R-317, page 10.

316, pp. 27 and 56.

the emphasis is added by the Respondents.

1413 R-MC, paragraph 145.

546

Mamoon is the front man. He is saying here, clearly, My power is 50
per cent Tarique Rahman. |...]’ Naturally, if two persons have been in
business together, one goes in politics, their businesses continue, the
other one is collecting money in this form who does not have any
expertise other than exercising influence. He gets paid, influence gets
exercised. Contract gets done. Payment gets made. 414

1920. The Claimant deny that these conclusions are supported by the evidence
before these Tribunals. It disputes the reliability of Mr Bhuiyan’s
statement of Mr Mamoon sharing with Mr Rahman the payments
received; and the Claimant points out the strong denials by Mr Mamoon
himself. The Claimant argues:

The Respondents have, largely by using repetition as a substitute for
evidence, sought to make Mr. Mamoon synonymous with Tarique
Rahman, the son of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia. Yet, as detailed at
paragraph 100 of Niko’s Post-Hearing Brief, one of the very few
aspects that is clear from the Giasuddin Al-Mamoon interrogation
transcripts is that he repeatedly confirmed that Tarique Rahman had
no involvement whatsoever with Niko or the JVA.1415

1921. The Claimant adds:

... [DJespite the Respondents’ heavy reliance on the garbled and
frequently incomprehensible RCMP interrogation record of Mr.
Mamoon, one of the few aspects of that record that is clear is Mr.
Mamoon’s absolute denial of any involvement of Tarique Rahman in
relation to Niko. As Niko cited in its Opening Statement at the hearing,
the transcript of Mr. Mamoon’s interrogation by the RCMP and others
reveals he was frequently prompted by the interviewers to admit that
Mr. Rahman was involved in the Niko matter, but he unequivocally
and repeatedly rejected the notion:

VOICE: you tell us freely and friendly that ah, for getting through the
project of this Niko yes, is there any influence of Mr. Tarique RAMAN
the Prime minister or not with you and Mr. Qasim SHARIF? Or Salim
BHUIYANP

MAMOON: No, hundred percent, you can take guarantee from me.
From my views and my know, there is no influence for, for this project
Niko project.1416

547

1922. When considering these arguments, the Tribunals refer to Section
10.3.4.5 above where they examined the evidence about the payments
actually made to Mr Mamoon. They noted the Respondents’ assertion
that “a total of approximately US$308,000” was paid to him by Mr
Bhuiyan.!417 As a result of their examination, the Tribunals concluded
that only US$180,000 find support by evidence on the record. They have
seen no evidence for the payment of the alleged balance of “several cash
cheques on several dates” in a total 72 lakh (US$120,000).

1923. Concerning the payments from Mr Bhuiyan to Mr Mamoon, the
Tribunals also examined their relations in respect to this project. The
Tribunals noted in particular that Mr Mamoon had been contacted first
by Mr Sharif. It was Mr Mamoon who then passed the project on to Mr
Bhuiyan and expected some return in case Mr Bhuiyan was successful.
In these circumstances, it appears plausible that Mr Bhuiyan made the
payments to Mr Mamoon in relation to the Niko project.

1924. Concerning the relations between Mr Mamoon with Mr Rahman, the
Tribunals noted in the transcript of Mr Mamoon’s RCMP interrogation
the explanations of his good relations with Tarique Rahman. The
Tribunals also noted, however, the strong terms in which Mr Mamoon
contested that Mr Rahman had a share in the Niko project. In addition
to the passage quoted above, one of the other passages of the transcript
reads as follows:

SCHOEPP: Okay, would any of that amount have gone, um was that,
we're you still in partnership with Tarique RAHMAN.

MAMOON: Sorry.

SCHOEPP: Ah, would, would fifty percent of that gone on to Tarique
just because you guys were in business together before and would
share the commissions like that?

MAMOON: No. '418

1925. The Tribunals are aware that the transcript of the RCMP interrogation of
Mr Mamoon, as the other transcripts, are of limited evidentiary value,
since they have not been tested by witness examination in these
proceedings. Mr Mamoon’s just-quoted statement concerns the specific

1417 B-MD, paragraph 35.

relations of the Niko project and thus has some weight. Mr Khan and Ms
LaPrevotte make statements about the practice they have observed in
general. They assume that Niko and its project is of the same kind as the
modus operandi they have observed in the Siemens and similar cases: an
assumption which is not correct. They do not assert any specific
knowledge about the Mamoon/Rahman relationship in the present case.
The assertions of Mr Khan and Ms LaPrevotte concerning the
Mamoon/Rahman relationship, thus, are speculation.

The passage in the so-called Bhuiyan Confession where he states that Mr
Mamoon told him he had to share his part with Tarique Rahman is of
doubtful value, not only because of the dubious nature of this
Confession, discussed above, but also because the supposed information
conveyed are not the words of Mr Bhuiyan but a statement which
someone else had made.

The Tribunals have discussed above the interrogation of Mr Bhuiyan by
Ms LaPrevotte and another FBI agent at which notes were taken which
disappeared thereafter. When she identified at the Hearing the points on
which she considered that the statement during this interrogation
coincided with his confession, she did not mention, as observed above,
the payment to the State Minister; nor did she mention that Mr Bhuiyan
knew or even understood that Mr Mamoon might pass funds on to
Tarique Rahman, or indeed that Mr Rahman had any role at all in
connection with the JVA.

In view of these considerations, the Tribunals conclude on the basis of
the evidence before them that Mr Mamoon received some US$180,000
which he considered as his share in the Niko project, due to him on
conclusion of the JVA. There is no evidence that this amount was
shared with Tarique Rahman and that Tarique Rahman had a role in
the decisions concerning the conclusion of the JVA.

The allegations about any bribes to the Prime Minister are based solely
on the role that is attributed to Tarique Rahman. There is no independent
evidence or even argument concerning corrupt payments to the Prime
Minister in the context of the Niko project.

Since the Tribunals have concluded that there is no evidence that Tarique
Rahman was involved in the Niko project and even less that he received

549

a share of the payments made to Mr Mamoon in relation to the Niko
project, the Tribunals also conclude that the Respondents’ assertion
about payments to the Prime Minister in relation to her approval of
the JVA is unsupported by the evidence available to these Tribunals.

In their First Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondents identify payments of
some US$22,000 from Mr Sharif to Babul Gazi a “BNP politician”.1419 They
identify payments “totaling 1,310,744 taka (~$22,000) in 2002-2005” 1420
as the Suspect Payments; the related “supporting
evidence/ circumstances” provides the following quotations:

Mr. Islam, Mr. Sharif’s accountant, told the ACC: “From his personal
account Mr. Sharif gave Gazi Babul a private car, a mobile phone set,
a Bangkok-bound ticket for his medical treatment, and monthly
payments of BDT 50 thousand from April 2004 to December 2005. I
think Gazi Babul helped Mr. Qasim Sharif on the Niko contract.” [R-
392]

Mr. Elahi testified that Babul Gazi “used to come with the Niko team
and he was introduced to me as a political leader and assigned by
the PM office to expedite the process of the joint venture.”1421

The Respondents also include among Niko’s corrupt acts the following
item:

Paying Babul Gazi, a former Parliament member and influential BNP
politician, to act on Niko’s behalf.1422

To specify the alleged bribe, the Respondents add: “Qasim Sharif paid
Babul Gazi more than US$17,000 between February 2004 and August
2005”, and they quote part of the same passage from the statement of Mr
Islam. The advantage which the Respondents see as result of these
payments is described as

Support of influential BNP politician.

Mr. Elahi explained that Babul Gazi “used to come with the Niko team
and he was introduced to me as a political leader and assigned by
the PM office to expedite the process of the joint venture.” Mr. Sharif’s
accountant: “I think Gazi Babul helped Mr. Qasim Sharif on the Niko
contract.” (R-392).1423

The Respondents’ allegations concerning the payments to Mr Gazi have
evolved. The charge concerning Mr Gazi was first made in the
Respondents’ Memorial on Corruption, where they alleged that Mr Sharif
“paid Tk. 19,200 every month from October 2002 through December 2004,
and Tk. 250,000 on 14 February 2004 to Babul Gazi, a member of
Parliament and a good friend of Kamal Siddiqui’ .42+

The Claimant asserted in its Counter-Memorial that the Respondents
“have not identified a single trace of payment to a government official’ .1425
Thereupon the Respondents wrote in their Reply:

... Niko ignores payments to Gazi Nuruzzaman Babul (“Babul Gazi”),
a member of parliament from the BNP. According to Mr. Sharif’s
accountant, “Mr Sharif gave Babul Gazi a private car, a mobile phone
set, a Bangkok bound air ticket for his medical treatment, and paid
BDT 50 thousand per month from April 2004 to December 2005. I
think Babul Gazi helped Mr. Qasim Sharif on the Niko deal.”
Correspondence submitted by Claimant notes that Babul Gazi
attended meetings with BAPEX officials regarding the JVA on behalf
of Niko in Mr. Sharif’s stead.!426

In Annex A to their Reply on Corruption, the Respondents included the
following “criminal act’: “[ajrrangement with Babul Gazi by which the
Parliament member received payment from Niko and acted on its behalf in
meetings” and identify as the purpose of this act “Procuring the JVA and
the GPSA” .1427

The Claimant have countered by pointing out the circumstances of Mr
Islam’s interrogation and addressing specifically the Respondents’

description of Mr Babul Gazi as “a member of parliament for the BNP’. It
stated:

The record shows that Mr. Babul was indeed a member of
Bangladesh’s 6th Parliament, which existed for a period totalling 12
days, in 1996. He was not a member of parliament during the
Targeted Period or any period remotely close to it. There is no basis
for suggesting that payment for services provided by Mr. Babul
constituted payment to a government official. 1428

1938. In support for this statement, the Claimant produced documents from

the Bangladeshi Parliament. The statement of Mr Babul Gazi’s tenure as
member of Parliament and the timing of this tenure has not been
contested.

1939. Thereafter, the Respondents presented him as “former member of

1940.

Parliament and influential BNP politician”.!429 The Claimant responded to
the Respondents’ statement in their First Post-Hearing Brief, by pointing

Babul Gazi was not a government official in late 2002 — in fact, his
tenure as a government official lasted a grand total of 12 days in
1996. He did, however, apparently perform some work for Stratum,
which serves as an explanation as to why payments were being made
to him (to the extent that such an explanation is even necessary). !49°

With respect to Mr Babul Gazi’s work for Stratum, the Claimant states
that he attended meetings and relies on the following passages:

The committee examined and elaborated changes to be made to the
JVA in light of the inclusion of Chattak East. In a letter of 24 April
2003.1431

Mr Elahi reported to Petrobangla the work of the committee and its
consultations. He explained that discussions had taken place in
which Niko was represented by Mr Nuruzzaman Babul as advisor of
Niko, since Mr Qasem Sharif, Vice President of Niko, had been out of
the country. 1482

It is undisputed that Mr Babul Gazi was not a member of Parliament
since 1996 and it is not alleged that he occupied any other governmental
function during the time since Niko first arrived in Bangladesh. It also is
undisputed that Mr Babul Gazi performed work for Niko.

The Tribunals conclude that the payments made to Mr Babul Gazi
cannot be described as bribes. The amount indicated as monthly
payments to him appear as modest and do not give rise to the suspicion
that they were intended to include bribes for others. The payments do
not affect the validity of the JVA.

Corruption in the procurement of the GPSA

The Respondents argue that the GPSA is void ab initio both because it
was obtained by corruption directly and because it is the tainted fruit of
the corruptly-obtained JVA. 1483

The second of these arguments has become moot since the Tribunals
have found that the JVA has not been procured by corruption.

11.8.1 The alleged acts of corruption

Concerning the first argument, according to which the GPSA was
obtained by corruption directly, the Respondents list the following
corrupt acts:

- Niko’s outstanding promise of US$ 500,000 to Mr. Bhuiyan, Mr.
Mamoon, and the State Minister for the GPSAs

- Niko’s gift of a car to the State Minister
- Mr. Sharif’s continued payments to Babul Gazi

- Niko’s continued payments to Stratum, even after Qasim Sharif

left
- Niko’s payments to Petrobangla Director (PSCs)

1433 R-PHB1 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 70.

553

- Niko’s hiring of Canadian Senator Mac Harb to influence
Bangladeshi officials in efforts to get the GPSA.1484+

1946. These points are developed in a table at pp. 46 and 47 of the Respondents’
First Post-Hearing Brief where the following alleged “corrupt acts” are
presented:

e Agreement with Messrs Bhuiyan and Mamoon to get
Government approval of the GPSA (R374)

e¢ Paying Babul Gazi, a former Parliament member and influential
BNP politician, to act on Niko’s behalf

e Purchase of a CAD 190,000 vehicle for the State Minister (R215)
« Payment for the State Minister’s international trip (R-215)

« Paying a Canadian Senator to act in his personal capacity to
visit Bangladesh officials and influence them on behalf of Niko

* Payment to Raihanul Abedin, Petrobangla Director (PSC) (R-
392).

11.8.2 Payment to Mr Raihanul Abedin, Director (PSC) Petrobangla

1947. The Respondents assert that Mr Sharif made two cash payments of
US$8,000 each to Mr Raihanul Abedin in 2005; according to Mr Syed
Rezwamul Kabir these occurred probably after the second blow-out. The
Respondents’ assertion is based on statements by Mr Kabir in a RCMP
interrogation and by Mr Shafikul Islam in an interrogation under Section
164 of the Code of Civil Procedure. !435

1948. Concerning the role of Mr Abedin, the Respondents explain:

Raihanul Abedin, the recipient of the bribes, was an important figure
in the JVA and the GPSA approval process. He was at Petrobangla
since 2001 and served as Director (PSC) from January 2003 until
June 2006. During that time, he communicated with BAPEX and Niko,
and Petrobangla’s legal advisor. For example, he wrote on 8 April

2003 directing BAPEX to finalize the JVA with Niko. He wrote again
on 19 April rejecting UNOCAL’s claim that its rights could be affected
by the JVA and insisting that the JVA should be finalized “as soon as
possible.” Mr. Abedin was also involved in the final approval of the
GPSA. 1436

1949. The Respondents include the alleged payments to Mr Abedin in the list

1950.

1951.

of acts allegedly in contravention of the Bangladeshi Penal Code, the
Prevention of Corruption Act and the 2002 Anti-Money Laundering Act;
the Respondents mention:

Bribing various other Government officials, including Raihanul
Abedin, through Mr. Sharif [...]. This constitutes conspiracy to cause,
and the aiding and abetting of violations of Sections 161 and 165 by
the various Government officials and violations of Sections 162 and
163 by Mr. Sharif.1487

Mr Islam stated:

Around mid-February 2004, after withdrawing BDT 5 lac from Mr
Qasim Sharif’s bank account, Sayed Kabir and I visited the then
Petrobangla Director (PSC) Raihanul Abedin at his Baridhara
Residence and gave him the cash. Around June 2004, after
withdrawing another BDT 5 lac from Mr. Qasim Sharif’s bank
account, Syed Kabir and I went to Mr. Raihanul’s office at
Petrobangla. There Mr. Raihanul gave My. Sayed BDT 150,000 cash.
Later Mr. Sayed and I went to a bank situated at the ground floor of
Rajuk building and deposited BDT 650,000 to Mr. Raihanul’s
bank. 1438

Mr Kabir describes the delivery of the envelope containing the two
payments to Mr Abedin. The Respondents summarise: “/ajs directed by
Mr. Sharif, he delivered cash to Mr. Abedin, once at his house and once at
another location. Mr Kabir states that each payment was for Tk. 300,000-
500,000 (approximately $5,000-8,000)”.1439

1436 R-MC, paragraph 133. The Respondents identify International Finance Corporation, Environmental,
Health, and Safety Guidelines: Onshore Oil and Gas Development, Exhibit R-70 and E&P Forum/UNEP
Industry, Environmental Management in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, Exhibit R-71,
respectively, as the reference for the two letters.

1952. The Claimant raises concerns about the reliability of the statements
both of Mr Kabir and Mr Islam, on grounds of the circumstances in which
the statements were obtained. It also points out that “there is no means
for either Niko or the Tribunals to further explore the substance of the
Shafique Islam ‘statement’ nor to test its authenticity, veracity and
reliability’;'44° and it makes a similar observation concerning the
statement of Mr Kabir.

1953. As to the substance of the statements, the Claimant points out the
difference between the two statements, as concerns the date of
transaction. It also observes that:

... there is no evidence of Mr. Abedin having any role in the approval
of the JVA or the GPSA. Third, there is nothing to suggest the
transaction has anything to do with Niko. Fourth, as with the
purported “statement” of Shafique Islam, Mr. Kabir appears to refer
to the purported payments as having related to a land transaction in
Rajuk. As with the alleged Islam “statement”, Mr. Kabir provides no
further information as to the purported nature or purpose of the
transaction, let alone identifying any corrupt purpose relating to the
business of Niko. 1441

1954. The Claimant also argues:

. Niko was unable to secure a GPSA until several years after
execution of the JVA, and at a very disadvantageous price, wholly
undermines the notion that there was a corrupt fee sharing
arrangement in place with the State Minister ...!442

1955. The Tribunals have examined the history of the GPSA negotiations from
May 2004 until its execution on 27 December 2006, as it emerges from
the evidence on record. They described it in great detail in the Decision
on Jurisdiction,!*43 and presented above essential steps in the GPSA
negotiations, as they are relevant for the present Decision on the
Corruption Claim. The examination of these negotiations shows that,
further to a letter from the Ministry, dated 15 July 2004, a Gas Pricing
Committee was formed “to negotiate for finalisation of gas pricing of Ex.

Feni gas field which is being developed by BAPEX-NIKO”. Mr Abedin was
not a member of this Committee.!444 The documents on record show,
however, that he played an important role in the GPSA negotiations,
being the person with whom Niko exchanged its Petrobangla
correspondence until the time when the draft had been initialled.1445

The only basis for the alleged corruption of Mr Abedin are the statements
of Mr Kabir and Mr Islam. As the Claimant has pointed out, these
statements are of doubtful value. Neither Mr Kabir nor Mr Islam appeared
before the Tribunals and there was no other opportunity for the Claimant
and the Tribunals to test the veracity of their statement. The text of the
statements does not indicate that the alleged payments were related to
the GPSA or even to Niko. Indeed, according to Mr Islam, the first
payment was made “mid-February 2004’;!446 but it was only on 19 May
2004 that the work in the Feni field had reached a stage that Niko
announced possible gas production to Petrobangla and proposed to
initiate discussions for the GPSA.!447 The link of a payment in February
2004 to the GPSA negotiations is thus unclear. It is even less clear why
Niko would have made payments to Mr Abedin before at a time when his
role in the future gas pricing negotiations does not seem to have been
determined and Petrobangla and the Ministry had not even formed the
committee for these negotiations.

In any event, there is no indication that the alleged payments, if they were
made and if they were intended to promote Niko’s interests in the GPSA
negotiations, had any such effect. Quite to the contrary. As the
examination of the GPSA negotiations in Section 4.2 above has shown,
Niko had to conclude the GPSA at a price far below that which it wished
to obtain. Niko had requested a price of US$2.75/MCF and, during the
negotiations, was prepared to reduce the price to US$2.35/MCF.
Petrobangla and the Government had offered US$1.75/MCF. Although
they were prepared, at some time during the negotiations, to increase the
price to US$2.10/MCF, they reverted to their original position and in the
end insisted on the price initially offered. Despite much objection, Niko
had to accept this price.

1958. The correspondence with Mr Abedin, as produced in these Arbitrations,
shows that he steadfastly defended the position of Petrobangla, in
particular with respect to the price and with respect to the delivery
requirement against Niko’s requests and against its threats of
suspending gas production. As revealed by the Respondents in these
Arbitrations, this price is substantially below that paid during the period
from 2004 to 2015 to other suppliers of gas.!*48 If there had been any
payments to Mr Abedin, the Respondents have not shown that they had
any effect on his position in the negotiations and on the terms of the
GPSA.

1959. The Tribunals see no basis for assuming that the GPSA and its terms
were procured through corruption of Mr Abedin.

11.8.3 Other alleged corrupt acts in the procurement of the GPSA

1960. In addition to the payments allegedly made to Mr Abedin, the
Respondents allege a number of other “corrupt acts” by Niko in relation
to the GPSA, as they were listed above. The Claimant points out that
these acts are outside of the Targeted Period and refers to “clear and
established facts militating against any notion that the GPSA was procured
by any of the alleged acts set out in the Respondents’ chart’ .1449

1961. The Claimant points out that

... the GPSA was signed on 27 December 2006 under a new caretaker
government. The BNP Government under Khaleda Zia left office in
October 2006 and State Minister Hossein had been out of office since
June 2005. In short, neither the allegedly corrupt actors nor the
broader alleged kleptocratic regime was in power when the GPSA was
signed. 1450

1962. As to the specific allegedly corrupt acts, the first on the list in the
Respondents’ First Post-Hearing Brief, are the Bhuiyan/Mamoon
agreements. The Respondents describe the alleged “bribe” as follows:

1448 See Procedural Order No 15, paragraph 10.
1449 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 50.
1450 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 51 (internal citations omitted).

558

Mr. Sharif paid first $500,000 to Mr. Bhuiyan following the JVA,
which he shared with Mr. Mamoon and the State Minister. The
promise of the additional $500,000 was pending conclusion of the
GPSAs, and Mr. Bhuiyan was to start receiving $10,000/month once
the Feni GPSA was signed. (R-375).1451

1963. The Claimant accepts that payments continued to be made to Nationwide
after the conclusion of the JVA and “Nationwide continued its mandate
following execution of the JVA, assisting Niko in its efforts to get a Feni
GPSA’.1452 The Claimant also explains with respect to “the promise of
future payment [under the Nationwide/Bhuiyan agreement...] that the
GPSA was never executed within the time frame that would have triggered
the further remuneration and the Respondents point to no evidence that
any such payments were made upon the execution of the GPSA.”1453 It
concludes that there is “no evidence of any advantage accruing to Niko in
relation to the GPSA.” 1454

1964. The Tribunals note that, despite the pending promise of the additional
US$500,000, the GPSA was not concluded in the agreed limited period
and there is no allegation that the amount was ever paid. They see no
corrupt payment in this respect.

1965. The second item on the list of corrupt acts are the payments to Mr Babul
Gazi. These payments have been discussed above in the context of the
JVA. The Tribunals determined that these payments cannot be
considered as bribes. This determination applies also with respect to the
GPSA. In any event, the Respondents failed to make any specific
allegation as to the manner in which payments to Mr Gazi contributed to
the procurement of the GPSA and its terms.

1966. The Respondents then refer to the Toyota Landcruiser for the State
Minister and his travel expenses, that have been subject to the
Canadian conviction. The Tribunals have considered these acts in their
Decision on Jurisdiction and noted that they did not procure the GPSA.
The examination of the GPSA negotiations, as presented above, confirmed
this conclusion and the Tribunals see no need to modify it.

1453 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 53.
1454 C-PHB2 (CONFIDENTIAL), paragraph 54.

559

1967. Finally, the Respondents refer to the visit of the Canadian Senator Harb
in Bangladesh. The Respondents assert that the senator met with the
Minister of Foreign Affairs in Bangladesh. They conclude that, through
this visit and the intervention in Bangladesh, Niko gained the advantage
of being able indirectly to “influence senior Government officials, including
the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Finance, to get the GPSA
for Niko”. 1455

1968. The Tribunals see no illegal act in the visit of Senator Harb in Bangladesh.
There is, moreover, no evidence that it had any impact on the conclusion

of the GPSA and its terms.

1969. The Tribunals conclude that the GPSA was not procured by corruption.

entire Chattak field, and (ii) the question whether,

Concerning the issue of the Chattak Field, th

even though there
were several faults in the field with the potential to create separate
reservoirs of hydrocarbons. The Western part had been exploited but not
the Eastern part where already an earlier study had proposed to drill an
exploration well. In the first agreement concluded with Niko, the FOU
with BAPEX, the complete Chattak field was identified by its coordinates.

Once the results of the Marginal Fields Evaluation of February 2000 were
known, the Respondents decided that the Chattak field should be split
into a Western part which could be characterised as
“marginal/ abandoned gas field” and Chattak East that had to be treated
as a “separate unexplored geological structure”. They took the position
that Chattak East had to be excluded from the JVA although, until after

the MFE had been made available, Chattak East had never been treated
as an exploration target distinct from Chattak West.

Although the Marginal Fields Procedure, adopted by the Awami League
Government in June 2001, referred to the Chattak Field without
distinction between the Eastern and the Western part, the Respondents
continued to insist that only the Western part could be treated as
“marginal/ abandoned’ and that the Eastern part had to be excluded from
the JVA.

Following a suggestion from BAPEX, the difference was submitted to the
Law Ministry which concluded that the delimitation of the Chattak Field,
defined by the coordinates annexed to the FOU, was binding. In the
circumstances and after a detailed review, the Tribunals find that this
conclusion is reasonable and does not justify the criticism which the
Respondents direct against the Law Ministry’s determination.

When the Law Ministry had determined that Chattak East should be
included in the JVA, BAPEX and Petrobangla negotiated with Niko
improved financial terms for BAPEX, which moreover treated Chattak
East more favourable to BAPEX than the Chattak West and Feni fields..
The Tribunals see in this additional negotiation and the improved terms
for BAPEX a further indication that the concerns of Petrobangla and
BAPEX were taken into account, even though the direct application of the
Law Ministry’s opinion would not have required this to be done.

With respect to

the Tribunals have noted, based on the evidence available in these
Arbitrations, that a proposal for marginal gas field development, as that
made by Niko, is not a transaction that was foreseen in the Bangladesh
procurement regulations and for which a competitive selection process
was required at the time. The Marginal Fields Procedure, adopted in June
2001, for the first time, addressed the case of unsolicited proposals; with
respect to offers received prior to the adoption of the Procedure, it
prescribed appraisal by a technical committee appointed by Petrobanlga
and the conclusion of a JVA without any requirement for competition.

It was in fact Niko that had initially proposed the application of the Swiss
Challenge procedure. While the Ministry, in May 1998, in directions
addressed to Petrobangla, had stated that Swiss Challenge may be
applied, “if necessary”, the Ministry never explicitly agreed with Niko on
this procedure; in particular, it never committed formally to the privileged
position for Niko which the application of that method would have
required; nor did the Respondents make any preparations for inviting
competitors to whom information available to Niko would have had to be
made available.

In any event, the original approach proposed by Niko was not followed
and, instead of concluding the MOU, the Ministry and the Respondents
required that, before a JVA could be negotiated, a feasibility study of the
Chattak, Feni and Kamta fields had to be conducted jointly by BAPEX
and Niko, of which Niko had to bear the full costs. Niko agreed to perform
this study. It did so in the FOU, which provided for the execution of the
JVA upon the satisfactory completion of the study.

When the issue was submitted to it, the Law Ministry concluded that the
FOU required the execution of the JVA without further competition and
Swiss Challenge. The Tribunals have concluded that, in the
circumstances, this conclusion was reasonable. They noted that, when
negotiating the JVA, the Respondents appointed special committees that
scrutinised the terms of the JVA and assured that these terms were
acceptable to Petrobangla and BAPEX. In this process they also referred
to the terms of a PSC that had been awarded in international competitive
bidding.

i=}

examination of the record shows that Niko took the risk of an investment
in which BAPEX would share the revenue without having to make any
financial contribution, and the gas price to be paid to Niko was well below
that which Petrobangla had agreed with other suppliers of gas.

Concerning the two opinions by the Law Ministry, which resolved the

‘Swiss Challenge, the evidence on record suggests that they were not

submitted by the Law Minister personally, as the Respondents assert,
but by the Ministry, signed by several senior officials of the Law Ministry.
In the Tribunals’ view, there is evidence neither for a conflict of interest
on the side of the Minister nor for corruption in the preparation of these
two opinions by the Ministry.

The Tribunals further note that the GPSA was
manifestly favourable to Petrobangla, which received the gas at a price
far below the price it paid to other suppliers.

In sum, the Respondents’ Corruption Claim is unfounded. If it had been

upheld as presented by the Respondents with insufficient evidence, it
would give them the unjust advantage of obtaining the gas delivered by
the Niko/BAPEX Joint venture without having to pay anything for it (as
indeed is the situation the Claimant finds itself in many years after
having delivered significant quantities of gas for which it received nothing
but two payments on account, covering only a fraction of what the
