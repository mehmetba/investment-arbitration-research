L INTRODUCTION

1. This arbitration was commenced by a Request for Arbitration dated May 18, 2011 (the
“Request”), in accordance with the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Between
States and Nationals of Other States, dated March 18, 1965 (the “ICSID Convention”), and the
Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
and the Government of Turkmenistan for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, which
entered into force on February 9, 1995 (the “BIT’). The Secretary-General of ICSID registered

the Claimant’s Request on July 20, 2011.

2. The Claimant is Garanti Koza LLP, a limited liability partnership established in the United
Kingdom (the “Claimant” or “Garanti Koza’”).!_ The Claimant is partly owned by Garanti Koza
Insaat (“GKT”), a Turkish company, and the Claimant’s executives working on the project that is

the subject of this arbitration were Turkish nationals.”
3. The Respondent is Turkmenistan (the “Respondent” or “Turkmenistan”).

4. The claims asserted in this arbitration arise out of the interactions between the Claimant
and the Respondent in connection with (a) a contract dated March 18, 2008 between Garanti Koza
and Turkmenistan’s State Concern “Turkmenavtoyollary” (“TAY”) for the planning and
construction of 28 highway bridges in Turkmenistan, and (b) a Presidential Decree awarding the
Claimant the construction project provided for in that contract for the lump sum price of USD 100

million.*

5. The Claimant asserts that it made an investment in Turkmenistan in connection with its
contract with TAY and the execution of its obligations under it, and that Turkmenistan
expropriated that investment and otherwise breached its obligations under the BIT.* As a result,
the Claimant argues that it is entitled to an award declaring that Turkmenistan has breached the

BIT in multiple respects and awarding it compensation for the breaches.°

6. The Respondent argues (a) that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear the
Claimant’s claims, (b) that in any event those claims are inadmissible, (c) that the acts complained
of cannot be attributed to Turkmenistan, (d) that none of the Claimant’s substantive claims has

merit, and (e) that the damages requested are unsupported and overstated.®

Il. THE TRIBUNAL
7. On September 26, 2011, the Claimant appointed Mr. George Constantine Lambrou, a

Greek national, as an arbitrator in this case.

8. On October 18, 2011, the Respondent appointed Professor Laurence Boisson de
Chazournes, a French and Swiss national, as an arbitrator in this case.

9. On April 10, 2012, Mr. John M. Townsend, a national of the United States, was appointed
as the President of the Tribunal by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council.

10. Mr. Marco Tulio Montafiés-Rumayor, Legal Counsel to ICSID, acted as Secretary to the

Tribunal. Mr. Jan Dunin-Wasowicz served for a time as Assistant to the President.

Il. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. First Session
12. After postponements made at the request of the Parties, the First Session of the Tribunal
with the Parties was held in Washington, D.C. on October 19, 2012. Procedural Order No. 1, dated

December 21, 2012, records the agreements reached and directions given during that session.

13. At the First Session, the Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted and

that neither Party had any objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.”

14. Also at the First Session, the Parties agreed, without prejudice to the Respondent’s
objections to jurisdiction, that this proceeding would be conducted in accordance with the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Rules”) in force as of April 10, 2006, at
the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.c.8
B. Confidentiality

15. On November 2, 2012, the Respondent applied to the Tribunal for a confidentiality order.
The Claimant opposed that application on November 16, 2012. The Tribunal ruled in Procedural
Order No. 2, dated December 21, 2012, that no confidentiality order in the terms applied for was
required or justified on the facts as then shown. The Tribunal directed in Procedural Order No. 2,
in accordance with Article 3.13 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Arbitration, that any document produced by one Party to the other, not already in the public
domain, should be kept confidential by the Party receiving it and should be used only in connection

with this arbitration.

Cc The Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent
16. At the First Session on October 19, 2012, it was agreed pursuant to ICSID Rule 41(4) that
the Respondent’s first objection to jurisdiction (the “Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of
Consent”) would be considered as a preliminary matter on an accelerated schedule, while the
Respondent’s second objection to jurisdiction (that most of the claims brought by the Claimant are
contractual in nature) would be considered together with the merits of the dispute, if the Tribunal

were to reach the merits.

17. Following full written submissions concerning the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of
Consent, a hearing was held at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C. on March 11, 2013, to

hear argument on that objection to jurisdiction.

18. On July 3, 2013, the Tribunal issued its Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack
of Consent. A copy of that decision, which is incorporated into and forms a part of this Award, is
appended to this Award as Appendix A. By a majority, the Tribunal found that the Respondent

had consented to jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules.

19. Professor Boisson de Chazournes wrote a Dissenting Opinion, which is appended to this
Award as Appendix B.

D. Proceedings on the Merits and Additional Objections to Jurisdiction
20. On July 17, 2013, the Tribunal held a telephone conference with the Parties to discuss the
merits phase of this proceeding. Procedural Order No. 3, dated July 19, 2013, records the results
of that conference, including a schedule for submissions on the merits and on the Respondent’s
additional objections to jurisdiction. Procedural Order No. 3 set the date for the hearing on the

merits and on the Respondent’s additional objections to jurisdiction as November 17-21, 2014.

21. The Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits was submitted, in accordance with the schedule
established by Procedural Order No. 3, on September 24, 2013. At the same time, the Claimant

submitted the First Witness Statement of Mr. Mustafa Buyuksandalyaci.

22. On the application of the Respondent, the date for delivery of its counter-memorial on the
merits and memorial on jurisdiction, set at January 24, 2014 by Procedural Order No. 3, was
extended to February 10,2014 in Procedural Order No. 4, dated January 22, 2014, and was further
extended to February 28, 2014 in Procedural Order No. 5, dated February 10, 2014. Both
Procedural Order No. 4 and Procedural Order No. 5 adjusted other dates to reflect these extensions,
but preserved the November 17-21, 2014 dates for the hearing on the merits and on the additional

objections to jurisdiction.

23. The Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on Jurisdiction was
submitted on February 28, 2014. At the same time, the Respondent submitted the First Witness
Statement of Ashr Alalyk-Ogly Sarybayev, the First Witness Statement of Gochmurat
Allamuradov, the first Witness Statement of Murat Ashirovich Nepesov, the First Expert Report
(on delay) of Anthony J, Morgan of PwC, and the Expert Report (on valuation) of Irina Novikova

and Mark Hannye of PwC.

24. In the course of exchanging documents, a controversy emerged concerning documents
located at the factory and site office established by Garanti Koza in Turkmenistan and later
attached and sealed by the Government of Turkmenistan. On April 21, 2014, the Secretary
forwarded to the Tribunal Redfern Schedules in which each Party argued its position with respect
to those documents. In Procedural Order No. 6, dated April 29, 2014, the Tribunal encouraged the
Parties to confer promptly with a view (a) to agreeing on a set of instructions pursuant to which an

officer of the Respondent would be authorized to conduct a visit to the site to collect documents;

and (b) to agreeing ona timetable for collection and distribution of such documents that would be

consistent with the timetable established by Procedural Order No. 5.°

25. The Parties eventually reported to the Tribunal that they had attempted to reach agreement
as directed in Procedural Order No. 6, but had been unable to do so. Each of the Parties
consequently submitted proposed instructions to the Tribunal on May 9, 2014, and submitted
comments on the instructions proposed by the adverse Party on May 15, 2014. In Procedural Order
No. 7, dated May 20, 2014, the Tribunal issued directions for dealing with the documents at the

Claimant’s factory and site in Turkmenistan.

26. After the documents in Turkmenistan were collected pursuant to the Tribunal’s
instructions, the Parties reported to the Tribunal that a further revision of the timetable would be
needed. Accordingly, after consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.
8 on July 18, 2014, revising the timetable and re-scheduling the hearing on the merits and on the

Respondent’s additional objections to jurisdiction to take place on June 8-12, 2015.

27. The Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Reply Memorial on the
Merits on October 13, 2014. At the same time, the Claimant submitted the Second Witness
Statement of Mustafa Buyuksandalyaci, the Expert Report (on valuation) of Richard Boulton, and

the Expert Report (on delay) of Amit Garg.

28. The Respondent submitted its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction on
April 10, 2015. At the same time, the Respondent submitted the Second Witness Statement of
Murat Nepesov, the Second Witness Statement of Gochmurat Allamuradov, the Second Witness

Statement of Ashyr Sarybayev, the Witness Statement of Toylymyrat Mammetdurdyev, the

° Procedural Order No. 6, { 8.

Witness Statement of Irina Balakley, the Expert Report (on valuation) of Mr. Sirshar Qureshi of

PwC, and the Second Expert Report (on delay) of Mr. Morgan of PwC.

29. In accordance with the revised schedule established by Procedural Order No. 10, dated
March 16, 2015,!° a pre-hearing telephone conference was held between the Tribunal and the
Parties on May 5, 2015. The agreements reached and directions given during that conference were
recorded in Procedural Order No. 11, dated May 15, 2015.
E. Hearing on the Merits and Additional Objections to Jurisdiction

30. The hearing on the merits and on the Respondent’s additional objections to jurisdiction was
held at the World Bank’s offices in Washington, D.C. on June 8 through 12,2015 (the “Hearing”).

33. Each expert witness first made a presentation to the Tribunal, and then was cross examined

then the damages experts, the Tribunal examined the two experts in each field together, giving
each an opportunity to comment on the testimony of the other, and providing counsel for each
Party an opportunity to follow up on the Tribunal’s questions.
F. Post-Hearing Proceedings

34. Toward the end of the Hearing, the Parties and the Tribunal conferred and agreed that there
would be no closing arguments at that time. Rather, the Parties agreed to submit post-hearing
briefs simultaneously, after receiving from the Tribunal a list of questions that the Tribunal asked
the Parties to address in their post-hearing submissions (“Post-Hearing Briefs” or “PHBs”).
Procedural Order No. 12, dated July 2, 2015, set the date for delivery of these submissions at

September 10, 2015, and scheduled a final hearing for oral argument for December 14, 2015.

35. On July 30, 2015, the Tribunal provided a list of questions to the Parties (“Tribunal’s
Questions”). After receiving the Tribunal’s Questions, the Parties requested, and the Tribunal
approved, an extension of time to make their post-hearing submissions until October 9, 2015. That

date was subsequently extended at the joint request of the Parties to October 14, 2015.

36. Following the Hearing, the Parties conferred and agreed upon a number of corrections to
the transcript of the Hearing and to the translations of both questions and answers. Each of the
Parties then addressed correspondence to the Tribunal concerning the points of disagreement.
After the Tribunal considered that correspondence, the Secretary issued the following direction to

the Parties:

The Tribunal has received: (1) the Respondent’s Errata Sheet on the Points
of Difference Between Respondent and Claimant, together with the
Claimant’s Comments on the same; and (2) the Respondent’s Corrections
to the Turkish, Russian, and Turkmen Translations of Questions Posed in
English, together with the Claimant’s Comments on those.

All of the corrections proposed by the Respondent and accepted by the
Claimant are accepted by the Tribunal.

The Tribunal reserves decision on the points of disagreement until such
time as it concludes that any question of substance turns on the parties’
differing understandings. In this connection, the Tribunal invites the
parties to draw the Tribunal’s attention, in their post-hearing submissions,
to any disagreement about transcription or translation that could affect a
significant point at issue in this arbitration.

37. The Parties submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs simultaneously on October 14, 2015. No
issues concerning the translation at the Hearing were raised in either brief.

38. On December 14, 2015, as provided in Procedural Order No. 12, the Tribunal held a
hearing in Washington, D.C. to hear closing arguments from the Parties (“Hearing on Closing”)
39. On January 8, 2016, the Claimant submitted to the Tribunal comments on new exhibits,
numbered R-98 through R-105, introduced by the Respondent at the Hearing on Closing on
December 14, 2015. On February 5, 2016, the Respondent sent the Tribunal its response to the
Claimant’s comments on those exhibits.

40. On January 22, 2016, also as provided in Procedural Order No. 12, the Parties submitted
their respective applications concerning costs. On February 5 and 6, 2016, each Party submitted
its comments on the other Party’s costs application.

41. On March 23, 2016, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to bring to the Tribunal’s

attention a recent award in an ICSID arbitration entitled J¢kale Insaat Limited Sirketi v.

Turkmenistan (ICSID Case No. ARB/10/24) (the “igkale Award”), and to request leave to add that

award to the record in this case.

42. Earlier, on September 24, 2014, the Claimant had brought to the Tribunal’s attention a
recently reported but unpublished award rendered on August 12, 2014, in an ICSID arbitration
entitled Adem Dogan v. Turkmenistan (ICSID Case No. ARB/09/9) (the “Adem Dogan Award”)
and had asked the Tribunal to require the Respondent to provide a copy of that award The Tribunal
had declined to order the Adem Dogan Award produced, explaining in Procedural Order No. 9
that a decision “in a proceeding brought pursuant to a different bi-lateral investment treaty, by a
different claimant, engaged in a different industry, concerning the actions of the Respondent during
a different time period” was not likely to “be of material assistance to [the] consideration of
whether the Respondent’s conduct towards this Claimant was or was not consistent with its

obligations under the BIT between Turkmenistan and the United Kingdom.”!!

43. In Procedural Order No. 13, dated 13 April 2016, the Tribunal gave the Respondent a
choice with regard to the ickale Award based on its reasoning with respect to the Adem Dogan
Award:

The Respondent is requested to advise the Tribunal by 25 April 2016
whether it will voluntarily submit a copy of the Adem Dogan Award. If it
agrees to do so, then both the Adem Dogan Award and the igkale Award
will be added to the legal authorities submitted by the parties in this
arbitration. If the Respondent does not agree to submit a copy of the
Adem Dogan Award by that date, then its application to submit the ickale
Award will be denied. !*

The Respondent declined to produce the Adem Dogan Award, so the i¢kale Award was not

admitted.

Iv. FACTUAL BACKGROUND OF THE DISPUTE

A. Turkmenistan’s Highway Bridge Project
45. On May 21, 2007, the President of Turkmenistan issued Presidential Decree No. 8626.
That decree directed the then Ministry of Automobile Transportation and Highways to renew
certain roads, as well as to build new ones, as part of the “National Plan for Developing

Turkmenistan Economically, Politically, and Culturally” (the “National Plan’).!3

46. On August 26, 2007, the Ministry of Automobile Transportation and Highways was
liquidated by a further Presidential Decree (No. PP-4834) and was replaced by two entities, the
Ministry of Road Transport and the State Concern “Turkmenavtoyollary.”!+ The latter entity,
referred to by the initials TAY, was established on September 10, 2007, to be “responsible for the
design, renovation, and construction of the highways connecting the major administrative cities of
Turkmenistan.”!> Presidential Decree No. 8941 provides that the implementation of the decree

creating TAY was to be supervised by the Vice Chairman of the Cabinet of Ministers. '©

47. One part of the National Plan was to be the improvement of the highway between the cities
of Mary and Turkmenabad, in order to “enhance Turkmenistan’s role as a significant Euro-Asian

transport corridor.”!7 That highway is “located on the European route E60 which links the cities

48. In the fall of 2007, TAY conducted a tender process for the construction of 119 highway
bridges. Most of the new bridges were to be double spans carrying two lanes in each direction, to
replace existing single-span bridges carrying one lane of traffic in each direction. The tender

ultimately resulted in the award of three different contracts. 7°

49. Mr. Buyuksandalyaci, the General Manager of Garanti Koza, testified that Garanti Koza

was established as an English limited liability partnership in April 2007, “for the purpose of

undertaking the construction project in dispute in this arbitration, in Turkmenistan.”?! As of May
2007, Garanti Koza had three partners: Garanti Koza Insaat Sanayi ve Ticaret S.A. (“GKT”), a
major Turkish construction company, which owned 45% of the partnership; IP Consult
(International) Limited, which also owned 45%; and Mr. Fuat Turgut Demiroglu, who owned

10%.?? Garanti Koza submitted a bid in response to TAY’s tender.??

50. In an award announced on December 11, 2007, Garanti Koza was awarded a contract to
build 28 of the 119 bridges, all of which were along the Mary-Turkmenabad highway.”+ At the
same time, the Turkish company Net Yapi was awarded a contract to build 90 bridges, and the

Ukrainian company Altcom was awarded a contract to build a single, 1.6 kilometer bridge.?5

51. Garanti Koza’s initial bid for the 28-bridge project was USD 105.11 million, including
VAT. It subsequently revised its bid to an even USD 100 million, including VAT, and TAY
accepted that bid.?°

52. The Parties disagree as to why the 119-bridge project was divided into separate projects.
Mr. Buyuksandalyaci states that it was because the “Turkmen Government did not have the
capacity to complete the necessary prerequisites for such a big project at once.”?7 Mr. Sarybayev,
who was the Chairman of TAY from 2007 until 2012, takes issue with that statement, and states

that, “In fact, Garanti Koza had originally submitted a tender for the 118 bridges.” During post-

tender negotiations, he said, “the Turkish company Net Yapi submitted a revised bid with a lower

B. The Presidential Decree
53. The award of the contract to Garanti Koza was approved by the President of Turkmenistan
in Decree No. 9429 (the “Decree”).2? The Decree, in its entirety, reads as follows in translation:

55. Mr. Sarybayev describes how negotiations between Garanti Koza and TAY led to
agreement on a reduction in price from USD 105.11 million to USD 100 million on January 26,
2008, and how the USD 100 million price agreed upon is reflected in the Decree, which is dated
the following day, January 27, 2008.34 The contract recites that “This Contract is concluded on
the basis of Decree of the President Of Turkmenistan No. 9429 dated on 27th of January, 2008.35
After the Decree was signed, Mr. Sarybayev says, “we negotiated those terms of the Contract that
had not already been negotiated.”*°
Cc The Contract Between TAY and Garanti Koza
56. The contract between TAY and Garanti Koza (the “Contract”) is captioned “CONTRACT

No. 01/2008” and is dated March 18, 2008.°7 Mr. Buyuksandalyaci and Mr. Sarybayev agree that

they signed the Contract on that date.3*

57. The Contract is written in two languages, Russian and English, which appear side-by-side
in two columns.*? The two parties to the Contract are TAY, identified as “Owner,” and Garanti
Koza, identified as “Contractor.”4° “Owner” is further defined in the Contract as “State Concern

‘Turkmenavtoyollary’ acting on behalf of Turkmenistan Government [...].’”*!

58. The Contract consists of (a) the Contract proper, consisting of three pages containing six
paragraphs, (b) the Contract Conditions, consisting of a further 22 pages containing 21 articles, (c)

Agreement No. 1, dated May 1, 2008, and Additional Agreement No. 2, dated June 27, 2008.43

59. The Contract obligates Garanti Koza to design and build “28 highway bridges and
overpasses on the reconstructed highway of the 1‘ technical category ‘Mary-Turkmenabad’ in the
timeframe and in a way as set forth in the Contract Conditions.”44 The Contract Conditions
require, among other provisions, that the Contractor comply with Turkmenistan law:

Contractor shall follow all the applicable Laws that are in effect on the territory of
Turkmenistan. Owner shall assist Contractor in understanding Turkmenistan laws and
regulations.45

60. According to Article 21 of the Contract Conditions, controversies or arguments between
Owner and Contractor are to be submitted to “Arachy Kaziyet of Turkmenistan,” an institution
referred to by the Parties as the “Arbitration Court’ of Turkmenistan, by which is meant the
commercial court.4° The same article further specifies that, “if the parties are not satisfied with
verdict of Arachy Kaziyet of Turkmenistan, parties have a right to turn to Arbitrage tribunal in

Hague (Netherlands).”’47

6l. The Contract imposes a deadline. The Contract Conditions require the Contractor to begin
works and complete them in accordance with Schedule A-5 of the contract.48 They further provide
that “All the construction works of bridges and overpasses shall be completed in the month of

October of 2008 according to” the Decree.*® In other words, the Contractor is required to complete

the process of designing and building the 28 bridges in seven and a half months. The Contractor
is required to “report to Owner in written form if there is a possibility that design or progress of

works on structure construction slows down or interrupts.”5°

62. The terms of payment established by the Contract are central to the Claimant’s claim. The
Contract states that the “Total Contract Price” is one hundred million U.S. dollars.*! It further
describes the “stated price” as “a lump sum final turn key price,” and goes on to say that “variations
and additions ... shall not affect Total Contract Price and Terms of Payment.”>? The “Total
Contract Price” of USD 100 million is further divided, however, into the “Contract Price,” the
amount actually to be paid to the Contractor, which was USD 86,956,521.74, and the Value Added
Tax associated with that amount, which was USD 13,043,478.26.53 Most of the operative

provisions of the Contract relate to the Contract Price, not the Total Contract Price.

63. The Contract Conditions provide for progress payments to “be made as the work progresses
and after presentation of monthly Progress Payment Certificate according to Schedule B-2 and
confirmed by” TAY.54 They further provide that “Monthly Progress payments to Contractor by
Owner shall be based on percentage progress amounts,” which amounts “shall be taken into

consideration as percentage progress criteria as per Schedule B-2.”95

64. Schedule B-2 to the Contract is captioned “Terms of Payment.” Both the Contract
Conditions and Schedule B-2 provide for an advance payment of 20% of the “Contract Price”

(which, as noted above, was USD 86,956,521.74, excluding VAT), which equaled USD

17,391,304.35. The Contract requires that the advance be paid against an “Advance Payment
Guarantee,” and for further payments to be made against certificates from the contractor that a
specified percentage of the work has been completed.>°

65. Schedule B-2 provides that:

100% of the price of the listed works mentioned in Schedule B-Iwill be paid (taking in
account 20% for reimbursement of Advance Payment) proportionally for each bridge to
the actually done Construction Works for each month.5”

Schedule B-1 contains a breakdown of the Contract Price among the 28 bridges and, for each
bridge, the percentage allocated to each stage of completion. The Contract specifies the form of
the Monthly Progress Certificate to be prepared by the Contractor and provided to the Owner.
That form, Exhibit B-3, requires the Contractor to calculate the percentage of actual progress on

each bridge in submitting each invoice.>*

66. Schedule B-2 specifically links the bank guarantee to the progress payments to be made to
Garanti Koza:

The amount of the Advance Payment Guarantee shall be diminished proportionally and in
the amount of 20% for each payment item, in accordance with all and each of the payment
items, listed above, to the CONTRACTOR under the Contract with respect to [sic] with
respect to the progress of Works.59

67. Schedule B-2 further provides that, after the advance payment, against specified
documentation:
e 5.72% of the “Total Contract Price” will be paid for Mobilization Works;

e 5.72% of the “Total Contract Price” will be paid for Design and Ground Survey Works;

e 100% of the prices listed in Schedule B-1 will be paid for each bridge “to the actually

done Construction Works for each month.”6°
Schedule B-2 also provides for a 5% retention to be paid following completion of the project.®!

68. Schedule B-1 lists each of the 28 bridges, specifies a “Total Price” for each bridge, and
then assigns a percentage to each stage of construction. For example, the total price assigned to
bridge number 62, the first one listed on Schedule B-1, is USD 7,765,217.48. Schedule B-1
specifies that 0.32% of that price will be paid for “Excavation works,” 0.42% for “Filling and
compaction works,” 6.62% for “Pile works,” etc.©2 The sum of the Total Price given in Schedule
B-1 for all 28 bridges is the Contract Price of USD 86,956,521.75, not the Total Contract Price of

USD 100 million.

69. The provisions of Schedules B-1 and B-2 summarized in the two preceding paragraphs are
difficult to reconcile. “Total Contract Price,” the term used in Schedule B-2, is defined as USD
100 million.°? The bridge-by-bridge percentages in Schedule B-1 that are referenced in Schedule
B-2, including the 5.72% for Mobilization Works and the 5.72% for Design and Ground Survey,

are applied to figures that add up to the “Contract Price” of USD 86,956,521.75.

70. The Contract provides that it comes into effect upon payment to the contractor of the
Advance Payment of USD 17,391,304.00 “against Bank Guarantee Letter.”°+ The Contract

Conditions expand on this provision as follows:

Owner pays Contractor an advance payment in amount of 20% of the total Contract price
excluding VAT which is 17.391.304,00 (seventeen million three hundred ninety-one
thousands three hundred and four) US Dollars against the Bank Guarantee on advance
payment given by a first class European bank in order to reimburse of Advance Payment,

acceptable by the Owner’s Bank. Due to time frames imposed by exchange conversion
procedures Contractor is advised by Owner to submit this Bank Guarantee latest by 20th
day of the month, after which payment of the advance amount shall be made available for
Contractor on the fifth (5) day of the next month.

71. The Contract goes on to specify that:

Advance Payment Guarantee shall be automatically and proportionally reduced by 20% of
100 percent (100%) of the commercial value of executed works upon submission of
Progress Payment Certificate signed by the Parties and presented by Contractor.°°

72. Reading the payment terms of the Contract together, they provide for payment by TAY to
the Contractor of a 20% advance (presumably calculated on the Contract Price, since the amount
specified as the Advance Payment equals 20% of the Contract Price, not the Total Contract Price)
against an Advance Payment Guarantee. The 80% balance of the Contract Price, minus a 5%
retention, is then to be paid in instalments corresponding to the percentage of the work completed
on each bridge and documented by the contractor, and the bank guarantee is to be reduced in
proportion to each payment. There is no mention in the Contract of any requirement to document
Garanti Koza’s costs or profit margins as a condition of payment of any invoice, nor is there any
specification of how long the bank guarantee was to remain in effect.
D. Garanti Koza’s Initial Mobilization

73. Garanti Koza states that it “commenced work in preparation for the project before the
signature of the Contract, as a gesture of good faith and based on the approval given by the
Turkmen President.”©7 Immediately after the signature of the Contract on March 18, 2008,
“Garanti Koza started mobilisation work,” including construction of a precast factory in Mary,

entry into a know-how agreement with GKI, installation of a concrete plant and a weigh scale,

import of equipment from Turkey and elsewhere, and construction of a dormitory for workers and

an office in Ashgabat.°*

74. Mr. Buyuksandalyaci explained that “Mobilisation included the following steps:

* building a 6,000 square meter movable pre-cast factory near the city of Mary. Garanti Koza
concluded a contract with Garanti Koza Insaat for the construction of the factory. The
factory was used to manufacture the beams and piles to build the bridges. The factory used
an advanced steamcuring process which allowed Garanti Koza to manufacture piles and
beams of stronger quality and more quickly, by improving the drying system;

= installing a concrete plant, with a computerised mixing system;

= installing a weight scale for trucks;

= importing equipment, which included two cranes able to lift 120 tons each, a high- quality
cast imported from Germany, excavators, bulldozers, generators, trucks, concrete mixers

and pile drivers; and

* construction ofa dormitory and facilities for workers, and the establishment of an office in
Ashgabat.”©

75. The Know-How Contract (dated March 24, 2008) that Garanti Koza entered into with GKI

was the subject of some controversy.”°

The Claimant states that the know-how in question was
“advanced technology to produce pre-stressed beams and piles.””! The Respondent points out that
there is no mention of any need to acquire know-how in the Contract, or in Garanti Koza’s business
plan or its financial statements, and that Garanti Koza’s possession of the know-how needed to
produce beams and piles was implicit in its bid to TAY.7? It adds that the Know-How Contract
itself does not specify what the know-how consists of; indeed, the Respondent says, the Know-

How Contract appears to have been downloaded from a model on the internet.7?_ The Respondent

argues that the know-how contract was simply a pretense for transferring USD 12 million, two-

thirds of the Advance Payment, to GKI, and that this transfer was the root cause of Garanti Koza’s

constant complaint that it was short of cash.74

76. ‘When questioned at the hearing as to whether either of them had seen any documentation
of the value of the know-how that was the subject of the Know-How Contract between Garanti
Koza and GKI, both the Claimant’s and the Respondent’s experts answered “I haven’t.”7> Nor
was there any evidence that the know-how was unique or proprietary. When Mr. Buyuksandal yaci
was asked at the Hearing whether Net Yapi, Garanti Koza’s competitor which was building other
bridges in Turkmenistan, was using the same technology as Garanti Koza, Mr. Buyuksandal yaci

responded “Yes, of course, they were using the same technology.”7°

77. Although Garanti Koza maintains that it commenced offsite preparations, it did not
commence on-site construction immediately after the Contract was signed. The Claimant blames
this delay on TAY, which it says “handed over a number of sites with delay and failed completely
to hand over four of the 28 sites.”7”7 The Respondent takes issue with that assertion, and argues
that:

19 of 28 sites were accepted by a contractorby April 12, 2008, 25 days after the Contract
was signed and at least five months before Garanti Koza was in a position to begin bridge
construction by drilling piles into the ground. It was notin a position to begin construction
not because of any act of TAY but because it did not producea single pile needed to begin
bridge production until July 2008 and did not bring a pile-driving machine to the
construction site until September 2008.78

78. The Claimant also claims to have been delayed in commencing construction of the bridges

by TAY’s failures to provide technical information and to remove the existing bridges and to clear

“there was no delay in the handover of technical data or bridge sites caused by TAY.”8°
E. The Bank Guarantee and the Advance Payment

79. On April 8, 2008, three weeks after signing the Contract, Garanti Koza says that it sent
TAY a bank guarantee in the amount of USD 17,391,304, corresponding to 20% of the Contract
Price (not including VAT) of USD 86,956,521.75.8! Mr. Buyuksandalyaci explained that “We
had to give a guarantee in order to get the Advance Payment.”8? The Claimant argues, however,
that “Turkmenistan, including Turkmen Highways and the Central Bank, required amendments to
the bank guarantee, which it had no entitlement to do under the Contract, which resulted in a delay
of several weeks in its issuance.”8? The Claimant asserts that it “had no choice but to comply,”
and sent a revised bank guarantee on April 26, 2008, “which in turned delayed the payment of the
Advance Payment.”84 The Claimant asserts that the Central Bank delayed approval of the
guarantee until May 31, 2008, which in turn delayed the payment of the Advance Payment until

July 7, 2008, because of the timing restrictions related to exchange conversion procedures.*5

80. The Respondent counters that “Claimant’s assertion that the proposed Bank Guarantee was
sent to TAY on April 8, 2008 is simply untrue.”8° The Respondent argues that the documents

“show that Garanti Koza did not submit its proposed Bank Guarantee to the Central Bank of

Turkmenistan before April 30, 2008, 43 days after the Contract was signed.87_ The Respondent’s

version of the chronology is as follows:

April 26, 2008: Claimant sent its proposed Bank Guarantee to TAY;

April 30, 2008: Raiffeisen Bank, the issuer of the Bank Guarantee, sent a proposed Bank
Guarantee to the Central Bank of Turkmenistan, i.e., “the Owner’s Bank,”

May 12, 2008: The Central Bank of Turkmenistan sent its comments on the proposed Bank
Guarantee;

May 16, 2008: Raiffeisen Bank sent Amendment No. | to the proposed Bank Guarantee;

May 26, 2008: Raiffeisen Bank sent Amendment No. 2 to the proposed Bank Guarantee;

July 7, 2008: The Advance Payment was made to Claimant.®*
81. The Respondent makes the point that the “Advance Payment was in effect a loan to be used
to fund legitimate Project expenses.”®° It points out that Turkmen law requires a contractor to
furnish a bank guarantee to secure an advance payment.°? The Respondent further stresses that
the making of the Advance Payment was conditioned by the Contract “upon the delivery by
Claimant of a ‘Bank Guarantee on advance payment given by a first class European bank in order
to reimburse the Advance payment acceptable by the Owner’s bank.’”?! The “Owner’s bank” was
the Central Bank of Turkmenistan.°? Any delay, the Respondent argues, was attributable to the

Claimant’s failure to provide a compliant guarantee.°>

82. Because of currency exchange controls, TAY’s bank had to receive the documentation

supporting a payment by the 20th of any month in order for payment to be made by the Sth day of

the following month.°4 Because the final amendment to the bank guarantee was sent after the 20th
of May, payment could not be made in June. The advance payment of USD 17,391,304 was made

to Garanti Koza on July 7, 2008.9>

83. The Advance Payment of 20% of the value of the Contract was roughly equal to the 21%
percentage of the “construction by length” (that is, the percentage of the total length of all the
bridges contracted for) which the Claimant’s expert testified that the Claimant had completed by
the time it stopped work.°® Considerable attention was therefore devoted during the Hearing to
what happened to the Advance Payment. The Claimant states that “Half of the Advance Payment
Garanti Koza received was blocked as acash guarantee by Raiffeisen Bank [the bank that provided
the bank guarantee] and the rest was used for mobilisation work.”°7 Mr. Buyuksandalyaci testified
that all of the money was “used in relation to the job that needed to be done for the 28 bridges.”°8
The Claimant explained further:

The Advance Payment was used to finance the Project, for mobilisation at the outset and,
after February 2009, when the second half was released, to pay its debts and finance further
works until June 2009 (including, without limitation, paying for design works, procurement
of equipment and materials, salaries of employees — over 600 of themat the pick [sic] of
the Project).°?

 

84. The Respondent has a very different view. It contends that GKI siphoned away the
Advance Payment to meet its own cash needs, leaving Garanti Koza with insufficient cash
resources to devote to the project in Turkmenistan:

As the bank statement shows, by July 31, 2008, ic. 20 days after the Advance Payment
was received, the balance of Garanti Koza’s bank account was only USD 3,818.20. Thus,
nearly all of the USD 17.4 million in Advance Payment funds was entirely gone. Over

USD 7nillion went to the Turkish parent, Garanti Koza Insaat, within the first 4 days after
the Advance Payment was received. !

85. The Respondent thus argues that GKI’s demands were the reason for the “cash squeeze”
that the Claimant complained about. It states that “the amount of money Claimant received from
TAY was always more than the amount of works Claimant performed.” This is confirmed, the
Respondent argues, by the Claimant’s offer, at the time the bank guarantee expired, to “simply
apply the outstanding amount of the Advance Payment to its progress certificates.” !0!
E The Initial Invoices and the Smeta Problem

86. On April 30, 2008, six weeks after signature of the Contract, Garanti Koza sent TAY its
first invoice for a progress payment, covering work on design, exploration, and mobilization. !°?
Following the Contract provisions and templates governing progress payments, the invoice sought

payment from TAY of a percentage of the Contract Price.

87. Schedule B-1 of the Contract specified that 5.72% of the price agreed for each of the 28
bridges would be attributed to “mobilization works,” and that another 5.72% would be attributable
to design and ground survey.!° In its April 30, 2008 invoice, Garanti Koza applied for the full
5.72% of the price of each bridge for “mobilization works,” and for 1.89% (out of the allocated
5.72%) of the price of each bridge for “design and ground survey.” The invoice thus claimed, in
total, 7.61% of the price of each bridge and of the total Contract Price, for a total of USD

6,615,304.33.

88. TAY rejected Garanti Koza’s payment application, not because the work had not been

done, and not because the application did not comply with the Contract, but rather because the

application was not prepared in accordance with “CMETA,” which is pronounced and also
sometimes spelled “Smeta.”!°4 Mr. Buyuksandalyaci explained:
In April 2008, Garanti Koza submitted its first progress payment certificate in keeping with
the lump sum pricing provided for in the Presidential Decree and the Contract. To my
surprise, this was rejected by Turkmenavtoyollary. I was told by the Control Department
of Turkmenavtoyollary that the Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank would not
approve payment claims unless they were submitted using detailed cost itemisation pricing
based on what is known as “CMETA” (also spelled “SMETA”), instead of lump sum
pricing. !°5

Mr. Sarybayev of TAY confirmed at the Hearing that Garanti Koza’s payment application was

rejected “because there was no SMETA.”!96

89. The Tribunal heard extensive testimony about Smeta in the course of this arbitration. The
Parties are in broad agreement about what Smeta is, but whether and how Smeta was applicable to
the Contract was vigorously disputed. In broad terms, Smeta is a method, developed under the
Soviet Union and still in use in some former Soviet republics, for predicting the cost of engineering
and construction work and then for assessing the value of such work as it is done. Mr.
Buyuksandalyaci gave the following explanation of his understanding of what Smeta means:

CMETA is a Russian standard unit pricing structure under which the work is valued by
applying fixed prices or rates to the quantities of work done (for instance labour and
material), as well as overheads and the profit margin. This is commonly referred to in the
construction industry as a “schedule of rates”. The prices or rates to be applied to each unit
of each item of work are fixed by the Turkmen Ministry of Construction and State
Commodity and Raw Material Exchange. In other words, they are fixed unilaterally by
Turkmenistan, without reference to the particular contract or the work involved on a
particular project.!07

90. The term Smeta is used in Turkmenistan to describe both a contractor’s forecast of the
expected costs of materials and labor for a project, and also to describe the process by which a

contractor certifies on an invoice what part of the forecast work has been done and what part of

the forecast costs have been incurred, so that he can be paid for that work. Mr. Nepesov, the Acting
Head of the Central Office of State Expert Review, a subdivision of Turkmenistan’s Ministry of
Construction, described how Smeta works in Turkmenistan: !9%

Submission of a detailed project smeta is required of all local and foreign contractors
performing government contracts in Turkmenistan. The contractor initially prepares and
obtains approval from the State Expert Review of its detailed smeta, a detailed cost
breakdown of the materials and labor that it plans to use, before the contract’s signing ora
few months after. The owner of the project monitors the contractor’s expenses by checking
the contractor's subsequent progress payment certificates against its approved smeta. The
purpose of this reporting mechanism is to ensure that the contractor's forecasted costs and
expenses are reasonable in light of the work to be performed and that the contractor does
not exceed its budget. The smeta system allows incremental payments to the contractor
based on the percentages of its completed works .!°%

91. Thus the Smeta system, as described by Mr. Nepesov, provides a method of holding a
contractor to his cost estimate for a project by requiring the contractor to certify how much of a
detailed forecast of the work to be performed and expenses to be incurred have been completed or

expended in order to get paid. Mr. Buyuksandalyaci described it at the Hearing as “a progress

payment system, based on unit prices.”!!°

92. The difficulty with Smeta, from Garanti Koza’s point of view, was that Garanti Koza had
contracted for payment based on the percentages completed of a lump sum price, rather than
payment in accordance with Smeta. As Mr. Buyuksandalyaci put it:

The imposition of CMETA by Turkmenistan was totally contrary to the
Presidential Decree and the Contract, which did not mention CMETA or
any schedule or rates pricing. Rather, the Presidential Decree and the
Contract provided for a fixed lump sum price payable by progress
payments based on percentage of work completed. This is significantly
different from CMETA. Under the lump sum pricing, Garanti Koza was
assured of progress payments based on the percentage of work completed
at the time of each progress claim.!!!

94.

We know very well how to work with this SMETA [...]. We wanted to
work on a percentage-based progress system, and that was our condition
with respect to signing a contract. But unfortunately this was not
respected. !!?

The Respondent disagrees that the Contract was inconsistent with the Smeta requirement:

On the contrary, lump sum contracts are standard practice for construction projects in
Turkmenistan, yet the smeta requirements are also the standard practice, as all contractors
know.

(el

The fact is that smeta must be prepared for all construction contracts in Turkmenistan and
this requirement does indeed coexist with, and is applied every day to,lump sum contracts.
Claimant’s reference to Article 10.3 of the Contract, which refers to payments based on the
percentage of work performed, does not conflict with the smeta system. Progress payment
certificates based on smetas are prepared based on the percentage of works completed by
contractors. Indeed, Form 2, the certificate of works actually performed that is part of every
progress payment certificate, includes an indication of the percentage of works.!!3

Mr. Nepesov explained his view of how the Contract between TAY and Garanti Koza

required the use of Smeta:

95.

112
113
14
15

 

If you were to read the Contract thoroughly, it says “based on reports of work performed.”
A report on work performed implies Form 2, that is how it is known in my country, which
is essentially a list of work performed, the unit measurement—the unit of measurement
and the price. And that is all in the Contract. I do not remember which schedule to the
Contract.

Perhaps Schedule Number B-2 [...].

The Contractors fill out Form 2, which is a Progress Payment Certificates [sic] and provides
to the Owner, the Owner compares it to the Projects, to the SMETA, and in accordance
with the SMETA determines the amount that is to be paid.!!*

Mr. Sarybayev, speaking for the “Owner,” agreed:

Form 2 is the monthly work performed by the Contractor. Well, it shows how much they
have done and there is a special form for that. They make the calculation, and derive the
amount which shows how much has been done within the month. Based on Form 2, then
Form 3 is prepared. We take the final amount from Form 2 and enter it into Form 3, which
has its own rules of completion.!!5

96. The difficulty arose principally because the Smeta reporting system requires a contractor
to certify how much he has paid for each item of material or work for which he is submitting an
invoice. Such a system could be expected to work reasonably well with a cost-plus contract, in
which the owner and the contractor have agreed that the contractor will do the work for his cost
plus a fixed margin or percentage. Even with a cost-plus contract, however, the Smeta system
applied in Turkmenistan limits the profit margin that may be claimed on any item of work to 6%,
plus an additional 8% that may be claimed on account of administrative expenses.'!® It thus
effectively limits a contractor who reports his costs truthfully to a 14% profit margin (including

overhead), regardless of what the owner may have agreed to pay.

97. It is also more difficult and time consuming to submit invoices that conform to Smeta than
invoices calculated simply from the percentage of completion of a task to which the parties have
assigned an agreed value. Mr. Nepesov testified that the preparation and submission of a Smeta
can take from three to six months, depending on the complexity and size of the project.''7 Ms.
Balakley, an engineer-economist who worked for Garanti Koza for a few months in 2008, testified
that Smetas are normally prepared by a “smeta specialist,” whose duties would normally include
the following:

i) preparation of smeta documentation and progress payment certificates; ii) checking the
volumes of completed construction works against approved project and smeta
documentation, as well as the construction norms and regulations; iii) recording of the
completed construction works and providing assistance in drafting of the reporting
documentation regarding progress of work as per the schedule; iv) participation in
discussions and meetings regarding the changes in project decisions arising in the course
of construction works; v) examination of reasons for delays and poor quality of
construction works; and vi) revision of smeta documentation in light of changes in volumes
of works within the range of project price; etc.!!8

98. The Smeta system is administered in Turkmenistan by the State Expert Review.!!9 Mr.
Nepesov, who was in charge of the State Expert Review, explained in his first witness statement
that “neither the State Expert Review, nor any other agency has the task of verifying whether the
contractor actually pays the prices listed in its foreign currency smeta for its cost items.”!2°
Contractors “who are experienced in Turkmenistan,” he suggests, deal with this artificial limit on

profit margin by the way they report costs, because “there is no control mechanism in place in

Turkmenistan.”!?!

As Mr. Nepesov explained:

Anexpense listed on a contractor's invoice may reflect a higher cost than what a contractor
actually paid for a certain material. For example, a subsidiary of the contractor may
purchase 10 tons of construction steel for 5,000 USD and re-sell it to the contractor for
6,000 USD. The contractor may then report the steel’s cost as 6,000 USD to the owner of
the project. The State Expert Review’s only task is to check that 6,000 USD is within the
price range provided in its price indexes, not the check whether the actual cost of this item
to the contractor was 6,000 USD.

In this example, the contractor would then add 6% to 6,000 USD and be entitled to a
payment of 6,360 USD for an actual cost of 5,000 USD. Therefore, in reality, no contractor
is limited to a 6% profit margin. !2?

99. Mr. Nepesov explained that a contractor would normally prepare a “less-detailed SMETA”
shortly after the signing of a contract, providing “some general breakdown on costs and the
budget.”!?3 The Expert Review Board would then review that Smeta, and approve it on the
condition that the contractor would submit a detailed Smeta within three to six months.'24 He
testified that:

In accordance with Turkmen legislation or legislation of any country,no construction can
be done without a project document, without project documentation. And a component,
an essential component of project documentation would be SMETA. Everybody has to
have a SMETA.!25

He added: “The function of the State Review Board is the review of project documentation.”!26

100. The Respondent argues that “smeta does not serve the purpose of changing the contract
price, it serves the purpose of justifying and then monitoring it. The Presidential Decree allocated
the maximum total amount of USD100 million including VAT and USD87 million excluding VAT
for Garanti Koza’s Project based on the price initially negotiated and agreed between Garanti Koza
and TAY. Garanti Koza had to simply prepare a breakdown of that total amount of the contract
price, in order to obtain payment based on the volumes of work it had actually carried out as per

its smeta.”!27

101. At the Hearing, the Tribunal questioned Mr. Nepesov about his explanation of how Smeta
can require a contractor to use fixed prices and fixed percentages and still be consistent with an
agreement to pay a lump sum price, in instalments, for a project:

PRESIDENT TOWNSEND: Mr. Nepesov, [...] I'm going to ask you to assume that a
Government Ministry of Turkmenistan wants a structure built. It doesn’t matter what kind
of structure, but wants a structure built, and negotiates a contract with a foreign contractor
to build that structure for a fixed price of USD 10 million. [...] Let’s assume that that fixed
price is to be paid at the completion of the Project. And let’s assume that the Contractor
tells the Ministry in the negotiations, that the Contractor tells the Ministry very directly,
“We expect to make a 25 percent profit on this Project,” and let’s assume the Ministry says,
“That's okay. We're going to pay you USD 10 million.’ And let’s assume that the
Contractor builds the Project and says, “Here it is. Please pay us our USD 10 million.”

Do I understand it correctly--here I'm going to ask you to explain whether I have
understood or misunderstood how the law works in Turkmenistan. Do I understand it
correctly that the Ministry cannot pay the Contractor the USD 10 million unless the
Contractor presents a SMETA which represents that its profit is only 6 percent? Have I
understood that correctly?

THE WITNESS: No. I don't think so. [...] But if you announce at the [start] it’s going to
be 20 or 25 percent, I don’t think they would give you that profit margin anywhere.

PRESIDENT TOWNSEND: Assume they do. Assume that the Ministry agrees to pay the
10 million knowing that I expect a profit margin of 25 percent, and I succeed and I build
the Project, and it only costs me 7 1/2 million todo it. As I understand what you're telling
me, I cannot get paid unless I submit what amounts to false data to the Government. Have
T understood that correctly?

THE WITNESS: No, it’s not quite so, not quite so. Everything is verified. Well, of course,
Tcan buy-I can buy some products with discounts. Of course we cannot verify the factual,
the actual price. It’s very difficult. It’s very challenging to verify the actual price.

PRESIDENT TOWNSEND: Okay. You can’t verify it, but you're telling me that I have to
falsify it in order to get paid. Do I understand that correctly?

THE WITNESS: Well, I’m having difficulty answering this, Mr. Chairman.

PRESIDENT TOWNSEND: Well, are youhaving difficulty because you find the answer
awkward or because you don’t understand the question?

THE WITNESS: The former most likely. !?*
102. The Contract, as the Claimant argues vigorously, contains no direct reference to Smeta.!29
Indeed, Mr. Nepesov testified that the form of certificate for payment provided for in the Contract
was not the form required by the Ministry of Finance of Turkmenistan.'7° When Garanti Koza’s
April 30, 2008 application for payment was rejected for failure to comply with Smeta, Mr.
Buyuksandalyaci testified that he “objected to this change of pricing,” but that he only did so
“verbally in my conversations with the Vice-President and the Chairman of Turkmenavtoyollary,”
because he “knew that a formal letter stating that Turkmenavtoyollary and the Ministry of
Construction were in breach of the Presidential Decree and the Contract would damage the

working relationship and would be counterproductive.” His objections, he said, were unavailing. '3!

103. Turkmenistan argues that the Contract is governed by Turkmen law, and that Smeta is
required by Turkmen law, so there was no need to refer specifically to Smeta in the Contract. !52
The Respondent argues that Smeta “is a mandatory reporting mechanism that applies to all
construction projects in Turkmenistan regardless of whether the corresponding contract is of a

lump sum or any other nature. In order to start receiving payments for its performed works, Garanti

Koza had no choice but to prepare its smeta, it knew so, and yet failed to do so.”!33 Mr. Nepesov
testified that:

[T]he word “SMETA” does not have to be said as such. It is implied. There is a law.
There is alegal rule that must be complied with. You do not have to havea direct reference
toa SMETA in the payments — in the terms of payment or any other section of a contract.
It is implied. 134

Mr. Buyuksandalyaci observed at the Hearing that “seven Ministries approved this Contract. [...]
So couldn’t at least one of these Ministries say that our Contract is against the rules, laws of

Turkmenistan? None of them made such a comment.”!?>

104. Although it claims that it was “coerced” by Turkmenistan to do so, Garanti Koza revised
its first invoice to comply with Smeta.!%° This took some time, so that the “Smeta’” version of the
invoice originally issued on April 30, 2008 was not issued by Garanti Koza to TAY until

November 1, 2008. That invoice was paid by TAY on December 17, 2008.!37

105. In addition to delaying its invoicing process, Garanti Koza asserts that the requirement that
it use Smeta forced it to reduce the amounts invoiced in the above certificates of payment by about
30%, for a total of USD 4,408,056.!38 The Respondent disputes that the use of Smeta has any
effect on the price paid for a project.!3? However, Mr. Nepesov effectively conceded that there is
arelationship between the use of Smeta and the prices that can be charged, when he testified at the
Hearing that “before a customer or an owner pays USD 10 for an amount of work that can
effectively be done for USD 2, that particular effort as provided for in the SMETA should be

subject to review. And, once the SMETA is subject to review, if there is an amount of work in it

that’s listed that is to be paid for USD 10; whereas, it can be effectively done for USD 2, that
particular SMETA will not pass the review.”!4°

G. Performance Delays
106. Both the Contract and the Presidential Decree called for Garanti Koza to complete its work
in October of 2008.!4! Work at the bridge sites had been planned to commence on May 1, 2008,
but work actually began on July 25, 2008.!4? As will emerge below, Garanti Koza never completed
all of the work, and significant portions of it had not been completed by October 2008. The Parties

agree on those facts, but disagree strenuously about the reasons for them.

107. Garanti Koza attributes the project delays principally to delays on the part of TAY in
making the payments to Garanti Koza called for under the Contract. As explained in the preceding
sections, there were initially two elements to the payment delays. First, disagreement concerning
the bank guarantee that the Contract required Garanti Koza to provide continued through April
and May of 2008, with the result that TAY’s Advance Payment to Garanti Koza was not made
until July 7, 2008.'43 Second, disagreements concerning whether Garanti Koza’s progress
payment invoices were required to comply with Smeta delayed payment of Garanti Koza’s first
progress payment invoice, which was initially submitted on April 30, 2008, was revised to comply
with Smeta and re-submitted on November 1, 2008, and was paid on December 17, 2008. The
Respondent counters that the Advance Payment would have been paid in April if the Claimant had

had an acceptable bank guarantee in place at the time of the signing of the Contract, and that the

108. Garanti Koza asserts that, notwithstanding these payment delays, it started work
immediately after the signature of the Contract. Specifically, it hired workers and built a dormitory
and other facilities for them, built a moveable precast factory in the town of Mary to produce
beams and piles to build the bridges, entered into a know-how agreement with GKI, installed a
concrete plant and a weight scale, imported heavy equipment and machinery, purchased cement,
sand, and stone, and submitted bridge designs to TAY and the Ministry of Construction for

approval. !45

109. The Claimant asserts that the Respondent further delayed the project by delaying or failing
to hand over to the Claimant the sites on which the bridges were to be built,!4° by failing to
demolish existing bridges that needed to be removed before new bridges could be built,!47 and
failing to provide geological, topographical, and other technical information called for by the

Contract. !48

110. The Respondent, for its part, denies that there was any delay in the handover of bridge sites
or technical data to the Claimant.!49 A letter from TAY to Garanti Koza dated July 24, 2008,
complaining about the delay in performance, states that:

At present time, the initial data and technical specifications in relation to all bridges, and
the act of [land] allocation in relation to 19 bridges have been officially provided by the
owner in order to perform the design works for the construction of the aforesaid bridges.

However, Garanti Koza LLP falls behind the schedule [. . .].!°°

111. The Respondent asserts that “Claimant was late at each stage of the project, in particular,

with starting work on the actual bridges.”!*!

For months, the Respondent argues, “Claimant did
nothing but construct a pile and beam production facility that seemed three to four times larger
than the needs of Claimant’s project.”!>? That decision, the Respondent argues, “is one of the

examples of its gross mismanagement of this project.”!53

112. TAY’s impatience with the lack of progress was so great that its chairman and other
officers met with Turkey’s ambassador to Turkmenistan and other officials on August 8, 2008, to
express their concern. The minutes of that meeting reflect TAY’s statement to the ambassador
that “no bridge construction works were carried out or accepted as of this day.”!>4 The minutes
also record that: “At the meeting the Ambassador of Turkey to Turkmenistan had a conversation
with M. Buyuksandalyaci over the cell phone with the General Director of Garanti Koza LLP and
asked him when he would return to Turkmenistan.”!5° Mr. Sarybayev argues that the fact that Mr.
Buyuksandalyaci was “out of the country for nearly two months” during the summer of 2008,
returning only in September before leaving Turkmenistan for good at the end of the year, is

evidence that “Garanti Koza did not care about completing the project on time.”!56

113. Another factor that delayed progress was that at least three of the bridges that Garanti Koza
was supposed to build — bridges 63, 68, and 88 — required steel beams that were not available in
Turkmenistan and that could not be produced in Garanti Koza’s factory there. Neither of the delay

experts put forward by the Parties could say at the Hearing where these beams were to have come

from.'57 The Respondent argues that Garanti Koza “had not taken any steps to source the beams
necessary to construct these bridges, much less to actually construct the bridges.”!5* The
Claimant’s response to the Tribunal’s written question asking where the Claimant would have
obtained these beams was that “Garanti Koza was to procure them in Kazakhstan [...] and transport

159

them by railway to Turkmenistan. Garanti Koza says that it had initiated the procurement

process when it had to leave Turkmenistan,!°° but that is effectively an admission that it was a long

way from having procured those beams when it stopped work.

114. The Claimant attributes part of the delay in starting work to the transportation difficulties
that delayed delivery of the piling rig that was required to drive the piles on which most of the
bridges were designed to rest.!°! It had been agreed in the Contract that the bridges were to be

built. on piles.!°? Driving piles required a specialized machine that could not be procured in

Turkmenistan, and that Garanti Koza arranged to obtain from Turkey. !°*

115. The machine was shipped from Turkey to Turkmenistan via Georgia, where it was delayed
in transit by the outbreak of hostilities between Georgia and Russia in the summer of 2008.!°+ The
pile-driving rig finally cleared customs in Turkmenistan on September 19, 2008, and piling work

commenced on September 24, 2008.!°5 The Respondent asserts that Garanti Koza was “late in

ordering, transporting, and making operational its piling rig,” and that this “delay alone would

have made the completion of the project, even with some reasonable delay, impossible.”!®°

116. OnDecember 18, 2008, Garanti Koza advised TAY that it had completed one-half of 15
bridges, numbers 72 to 86.'°7 The bridge project contemplated building pairs of bridges at each
of the 28 sites, each carrying two lanes of traffic, so that, upon completion of the project, there
would be two lanes operating in one direction on one of the bridges and two lanes operating in the
other direction on the twin of that bridge. The completion of half of 15 bridges meant that one
two-lane bridge was open at each of 15 sites, each carrying one lane of traffic in each direction.
Garanti Koza informed TAY, however, that it had ceased piling work on December 4, 2008,
asserting that it had been prevented from progressing further by late demolition of pre-existing

structures, delayed provision of technical information, and delayed hand-overs of bridge sites. !®8

117. Mr. Sarybayev testified that: “Towards the end of 2008, once we realized that Garanti
Koza was not going to make it by the completion date stipulated in the Contract, we agreed to
extend the project deadline until November 2009. In order for this extension to become valid, we
needed to conclude a relevant additional agreement to the Contract and register it with the same
agencies that registered the initial version of the Contract. Despite all our attempts, Garanti Koza

failed to sign it.”!°

118. | Mr. Buyuksandalyaci takes issue with Mr. Sarybayev’s statement that the deadline was not
extended. He testified that “The project deadline was extended until November 1, 2009 further to

a Turkemenistan Presidential Decree which extended completion deadlines for several projects,

including this one, by one year. I was informed of this Turkmenistan Presidential Decree by

Turkmenavtoyollary.”!7°

Mr. Buyuksandalyaci gave no document reference for this statement,
but the Claimant submitted a letter from TAY to Garanti Koza dated November 12, 2009, that
stated:

According to the proposal of the competent authority of Turkmenistan, period of
construction works actually prolonged till the November 2009, but unfortunately this
period have been breached by you. !7!

Another letter from TAY to Garanti Koza, dated December 31, 2009, stated:

Upon the proposal made by the competent authorities of Turkmenistan, the date of
commissioning was actually moved to November 1, 2009, but even this date was not
observed by “Garanti Koza LLP”.!72

Those letters would seem to document that the deadline was in fact extended to November 1, 2009.

119. The Respondent argues that the “Claimant seems to have dropped its argument that the
completion date was extended to November 1, 2009 by consent of the relevant Turkmen
authority,” and that “Garanti Koza did not accept the offer to extend the completion date of the
Project because it was not in its interest.”!73 Mr. Buyuksandalyaci, for his part, attributes the
failure to agree to an amendment to the Contract extending the deadline to TAY’s insistence on
“wholly unacceptable” wording attributing the delays to Garanti Koza.!74
H. Payment of the First Three Invoices

120. Garanti Koza’s first Smeta-compliant invoice was paid by TAY on December 17, 2008.
Both the second and the third Smeta-compliant invoices were paid on January 29, 2009. Garanti

Koza issued five subsequent certificates of payment drafted to comply with Smeta between

L Expiration of the Bank Guarantee
122. Garanti Koza’s fourth certificate of payment, dated January 5, 2009, was not paid by TAY.
The reason for non-payment was not that it was not compliant with Smeta, nor that the work
certified had not been performed, but rather because the bank guarantee provided by Garanti Koza
to TAY expired on February 2, 2009 and was not renewed.!77_ As of February 2, 2009, the
Respondent asserts, the “Claimant had only amortized about 16.9% of the Advance Payment and

still owed close to USD15 million to TAY by its own calculations.”!78

123. As explained above (Section IV.E), Garanti Koza had provided the bank guarantee in May
2008 to secure repayment of the advance of USD 17,391,304 paid by TAY to Garanti Koza in July
2008.!7° The Contract provided for 20% of each progress payment made by TAY to Garanti Koza
to be reduced by 20%, which was allocated to repayment of the advance payment.!8° Thus, until
the advance payment was fully repaid, the bank guarantee provided assurance to TAY that Garanti
Koza would not simply pocket the advance and disappear. As shown in the table in paragraph
121, only USD 2,479,347 of the advance payment of USD 17,391,304 had been earned at the time

the bank guarantee expired.

124. When the bank guarantee was originally provided to TAY, in May 2008, Garanti Koza was
supposed to complete its work under the Contract by the end of October 2008. If Garanti Koza had
done so, it would have been of no consequence that the guarantee expired in February 2009.
However, when February 2009 arrived with the work only partially completed, Garanti Koza and

TAY took radically different positions. TAY’s position, as explained by Mr. Sarybayev, was that

17 Tr. June 9, 2015, p. 421; Sarybayev WS-1, {J 41-43; Exh. AS-40.

44

it would exert itself (as it did) to pay Garanti Koza’s second and third invoices by the end of
January, because it knew that it would be unable to pay invoices after the bank guarantee expired
on February 2.'8! Garanti Koza’s position was that it was “under no contractual or other obligation
to renew the Guarantee,”!’? and that TAY’s obligation to pay its invoices was not conditioned on

the bank guarantee remaining in effect.!*?

125. Mr. Sarybayev conceded at the Hearing that the Contract does not, in so many words,
require that the bank guarantee remain in effect in order for progress payments to be made.!*4 The
Respondent nevertheless takes the position that the structure of the Contract, by providing for a
deduction of 20% from each progress payment until the advance was repaid, effectively
demonstrates that the parties understood that the guarantee would have to remain in effect for the
life of the project — which was in any event expected by both parties to be shorter than the life of

the guarantee. !8>

126. The Claimant gives three reasons why it did not renew the bank guarantee. First, it says
that it was under no obligation to do so. Second, it says that “it was reasonable for Garanti Koza
to opt not to renew in light of its deteriorating relationship with Turkmenistan.” And third, it says

that it “offered Turkmenistan alternatives to the renewal of the Bank Guarantee, such as giving the

factory and equipment as collateral.””!*°

127. In the event, the Claimant says, “Turkmenistan was inflexible. It rejected all alternatives,

did not propose any other alternatives and tried to coerce Garanti Koza to renew the Bank

Guarantee by refusing to pay for the works done up to the end of March 2009 and approved by it
under Certificates No. 4 to 8.”!87 The Respondent agrees that it insisted that Garanti Koza had to
have a valid bank guarantee in place in order to receive progress payments. The Respondent
observes that it would have been imprudent to proceed otherwise with “a paper company with no
real equity, with no employees and with no activity or transactions conducted by it.”!88
J. Non-Payment of Five Additional Approved Invoices

128. The upshot after the expiration of the bank guarantee was that the Claimant’s progress
payment invoices after the first three remained unpaid, even though five more progress payments
(represented by invoices 4 through 8) were approved by TAY (see table at paragraph 121).
According to Mr. Sarybayev, it was not TAY that was unwilling to pay the approved progress
payments, but rather the Central Bank. Mr. Sarybayev testified:

THE WITNESS: The Bank Guarantee in Turkmenistan and under current legislation is

required for the period of construction for the entire period. When the Bank Guarantee

expires, up to that, the Bank does not conduct any operations. The Advance Payment is

then depreciated by the end of the Project, and it will be zero, so the bank ~ or by the time
of the expiration, it should be zero. So the Bank Guarantee is then null and void.

ARBITRATOR LAMBROU: Was any attempt made by Turkmenautoyollari to make
further payments after expiration of the Bank Guarantee?

THE WITNESS: Yes, there was an attempt. We tried to pay them, based on the Progress
Payment Certificates, based on promises from Mr. Buyuksandalyaci. I personally tried to

convince the Bank that we should go ahead and make the payment, but they would not go
ahead and make the payment. !8?

129. Nevertheless, the Claimant remained in possession of the Advance Payment, which had
been only partially amortized. Twenty percent of the first three progress payments (USD
2,479,347) had been applied to reduce the amount of the Advance Payment,!°° but that left USD

14,911,957 of the Advance Payment (USD 17,391,304 - 2,479,347 = USD 14,911,957) in Garanti

Koza’s hands. Since the approved but unpaid progress payments (invoices 4 through 8) added up
only to USD 3,899,179, Garanti Koza was still well ahead as of the date of the last approved
invoice, April 28, 2009.!9!
K. Suspension of Work

130. By the end of March 2009, according to Mr. Garg, the Claimant’s delay expert, the
Claimant “had completed 21 bridges in one direction, was progressing Bridge No. 71 in both
directions and could start work on Bridge No. 89.”!92 Around that time, however, the same expert
stated that “the progress of the works started to slow down eventually coming to a standstill.
Production of piles effectively stopped at the end of March 2009, with production 63%

complete.”!93

131. After April 2009, some additional work on the bridges was achieved, but progress
gradually came to a halt. As Mr. Garg explained:
From April 2009 onwards, the Claimant continued to work on Bridge No. 71, and by 31
May 2009 had also progressed works on the second halves of Bridges No. 72, 73, 74, and
75. The Claimant had also substantially completed piling works for one half of Bridge No.
89 by this date. As of this date, the Claimant had completed approximately 29% of the
construction by length of all the bridges excluding Bridge No. 63 & No. 88.!%
The Respondent asserts that Garanti Koza had effectively abandoned the project by May of

2009.!9° It is clear from the evidence that work had effectively ceased by the middle of 2009.

132. Overall, the Claimant claims to have “completed the construction of 21 bridges one-way”,
which TAY has subsequently opened to traffic, and also claims to have completed both directions

on one of the large bridges, Number 71.!°© Mr. Garg estimates that: “Based on the total length of

all bridges [not excluding Bridges Nos. 63 and 88], the Claimant had completed approximately

21% of the construction by length.”!97

133. The Claimant also asserts that “Turkmenistan had no complaints about the quality of
Garanti Koza’s work.”!98

L. Post-Suspension Invoices
134. In the eight days between August 5 and August 13, 2009, Garanti Koza issued five
additional invoices, totaling USD 10,236,855 (excluding VAT and after subtracting 20% for the

Advance Payment), as follows:

These invoices were neither approved nor paid by TAY.!99

135. By August 13, 2009, by the Claimant’s calculation, TAY owed the Claimant a total

(excluding VAT) of USD 13,953,486. At the same time, the Claimant continued to hold an

unapplied balance of the Advance Payment that it calculates as USD 11,423,586. The net that the

Claimant believes it is owed for work done as of August 2009 is thus USD 2,529,900.70°

136. The Respondent’s view of the same facts as of the end of 2009 appears in a letter dated
December 31, 2009, from TAY to Garanti Koza. In that letter, TAY takes the position that Garanti
Koza had by that date performed 18.74% of the work called for by the Contract, corresponding to
a value of USD 18,750,301.04. Out of that amount, TAY said, USD 9,917,387.48 was paid to
Garanti Koza, and USD 3,259,182.78 was deducted for the Advance Payment. That left, TAY
said, an unpaid balance owed to Garanti Koza but held in the Central Bank of Turkmenistan of
USD 3,119,343.69 and an unsettled balance of the Advance Payment paid to but not earned by
Garanti Koza of USD 14,132,121.22.2°!
M. Withdrawal of Garanti Koza from Turkmenistan

137. The Claimant asserts that, beginning in the fall of 2009, “Turkmenistan embarked on a
more intensive harassment campaign against Garanti Koza.”?°? First, the Claimant says, TAY
“threatened to terminate the Contract.”2°3 Indeed, on November 12,2009, TAY sent Garanti Koza
a letter complaining that Garanti Koza had not “executed your obligations” and stating that:

Taking into consideration all of the cases, Company “Garanti Koza LLP” over a long
period of time do not accept any steps on improvement of the existing situation and there
is no any guarantee on continuation of construction works and execution of Contract,
therefore State Concern "Turkmenavtoyollary” is obliged to use Article 11 “Legal assets
and authorities” and Article 17 “Cancellation of the Contact”.2

138. Then, the Claimant says, the Turkmen tax administration conducted a tax inspection and
announced it would fine Garanti Koza for tax infractions.2°5 The Respondent states, however,
that:
[T]he Turkmen tax authorities did not take further steps to recover Garanti Koza’s tax
indebtedness and fines, revealed during the December 2009 Tax Audit. The amount of
approximately USD1.3 million comprising of the unpaid taxes and the accumulated

penalties revealed by the Tax Audit in December 2009 still remains unrecovered as of
today.20

139. The end of Garanti Koza’s activities in Turkmenistan came early the following year. As

narrated by Mr. Buyuksandalyaci:

 

In the first week of February 2010, I was informed by one of Garanti Koza’s employees in
T istan that a i ives of Ti . the
Ministry of Construction and Turkmenistan’s Supreme Supervision Agency came to
Garanti_ Koza’s factory in Mary, accompanied by police and military forces. This
committee told our remaining employees on site not to touch anything or take anything
with them. The committee conducted an inventory and valuation of the equipment and
material at the factory. It requested that one of our employees on site sign the inventory
and valuation. A copy of the committee’s minutes, dated February 4, 2010, containing the
inventory and valuation, was provided to one of our employees. After completing the
inventory, the committee asked our employees to leave the site of the factory and took it
over. We arranged for our remaining Turkish employees to fly back to Turkey the next
day.207

 

140. The Respondent denies that its actions at Garanti Koza’s factory on February 4, 2010
amounted to a seizure of Garanti Koza’s assets. The Respondent describes the incident as an
“inventory of assets” that was conducted as part of an “inspection carried out by the Supreme
Control Chamber of Turkmenistan.”2°8 That inspection had nothing to do with the tax dispute, the
Respondent says, but “was a consequence of Garanti Koza’s failure to perform its obligations

under the Contract.”?0?

N. Events After Withdrawal
141. Shortly after the factory visit and the subsequent departure from the country of Garanti
Koza’s remaining personnel, TAY “exercised its Article 17 right to unilaterally terminate the
Contract” on February 22, 2010.7!° According to the Respondent, the termination took effect on

March 24, 2010, 30 days after the notice was given.!!

142. On the same day that it sent its notice of termination, February 22, 2010, TAY asked the
Prosecutor General of Turkmenistan to commence a lawsuit against Garanti Koza in the
“Arbitration Court” of Turkmenistan.?!?_ The next day, on February 23, 2010, the Arbitration Court
entered an order attaching Garanti Koza’s assets “as a provisional measure granting TAY security
for amounts owing to it by Garanti Koza.”?!3 Those assets were valued “by the Forensic Experts

of the Ministry of Internal Affairs” at USD 11,610,881,7!4 a valuation that the Claimant challenges

as inaccurate.?!>

143. The Arbitration Court wound up the case swiftly. In a decision dated March 12, 2010, the
Arbitration Court awarded TAY a “delay penalty” of USD 3 million, amounting to 3% of the value
of the Contract, and a judgment for USD 10,999,830.26, which the Respondent describes as “the
unutilized advance payment,” excluding the amounts owed by TAY to Garanti Koza, plus “state

duties.”?!© The Court further permitted TAY to enforce its judgment against the proceeds from

sales of Garanti Koza’s assets, although the Respondent states that TAY has so far “elected not to

seek the enforcement of the Decision of the Arbitration Court.”?!7

144. The Respondent states that the Arbitrazh Procedural Code does not require the presence or
consent of the defendant when attaching its assets as security for a claim. According to the
Respondent, the Arbitrazh Procedural Code stipulates that courts will consider an application for
security within five days, without informing the respondent and other participants of the case. The
Respondent also stresses that the Arbitrazh and Civil Procedural Codes also do not require any
notification relating to enforcement of the decision. Thus, Respondent says, Garanti Koza was not
notified of the rulings and orders concerning attachment of its assets as a security measure for
TAY’s claim until the Decision of the Arbitrazh Court dated March 12, 2010, was communicated

to Garanti Koza by letter of the Arbitrazh Court No. 196/1- 33 dated March 15, 2010.?!8

145. The Respondent also states that Garanti Koza’s production facility was never transferred
to Net Yapi or to any other party and the facility remains untouched since Garanti Koza abandoned
the Project in May-June 2009. The facility does remain under an attachment order, but TAY has
not sought enforcement of the order, first because it was still hopeful that Garanti Koza would
return to complete the Project, and later because TAY chose to wait for the determination of the
claims in this ICSID Arbitration.?!9 The Respondent contends that the Claimant has never alleged
that Garanti Koza’s production facility was transferred to Net Yapi, and that did not in fact occur.
At the Hearing, Counsel for the Claimant questioned Mr. Sarybayev as to why the Supreme

Control Chamber recommended that the construction works, not the production facility, be handed

over to Net Yapi.22° There was no mention of the production facility being transferred to anyone
in the Minutes of Inventory created as part of an inspection carried out by the Supreme Control
Chamber on February 4, 2010.2?! Nevertheless, Mr. Sarybayev testified at the Hearing:

THE WITNESS: For 28 bridges, if we gave the Contract overto Net Yapi, then at theend
of the Project, they would give the production base; thatis, they — or production facilities
to the balance sheet of Turkmen Highways.

ARBITRATOR LAMBROU: Is that the production facility which was originally built by
Garanti Koza?

THE WITNESS: Yes.???
146. Mr. Buyuksandalyaci describes the delay penalty as a “punitive sanction,” characterizing
TAY’s approach to delays as “outrageous,” because “[TAY] caused the delays and by its own
admission, the completion date had been extended by Turkmen authorities until November 1,
2009.”223 He also states that the Arbitration Court summoned Garanti Koza on February 23, 2010,
to attend a trial commencing on February 26, 2010, which it “was not possible for Garanti Koza
to attend on such short notice.” He adds that “no Turkmen lawyer would represent Garanti Koza
against the Government,” and that Garanti Koza did not receive any information on the outcome
of the court proceedings.??4 The Claimant argues that it would have been both futile and dangerous

for Garanti Koza to appear at the court.?25

147. It was only on January 3, 2011, Mr. Buyuksandalyaci says, that TAY sent a letter to Garanti
Koza’s London office informing Garanti Koza of the termination of the Contract.??° That letter,

the Claimant asserts, claimed that it was Garanti Koza, rather than TAY, which had unilaterally

Vv. APPLICABLE LAW

148. It is common ground that the law applicable to the present dispute is contained in the BIT
and the ICSID Convention. Where these treaties are silent ona relevant issue, such issue is subject
to customary international law, unless the treaties refer to municipal law or the parties agree to do

so.

149. In interpreting the BIT and other treaty language, the applicable rules of interpretation are
found in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). The
Tribunal cites to the decisions of other tribunals in other investment treaty cases where such
decisions help to explain a point, to clarify a concept of international law, or to illustrate how
similar issues have been resolved in other cases, but the Tribunal is not in any way bound by such

decisions.??°

150. The interpretation of the Contract is governed by the law of Turkmenistan.?°°

VI. THE JURISDICTION OF THE TRIBUNAL

151. As described in Part III.C above, the Respondent agreed at the First Session with the
Tribunal to divide its objections to jurisdiction into two parts. The first part, the Respondent’ s
Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent, was raised as a preliminary matter and was

considered in the Tribunals Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent, dated

were raised in the context of the proceeding on the merits.

153. The Respondent argues that the Claimant bears the burden of proof, by the preponderance
of evidence, that this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the present dispute pursuant to the instruments
under which it has brought its claims. Thus, even though it is Turkmenistan that raises the
objections to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, the Respondent argues that the burden of proof still
lies with the Claimant to demonstrate that the jurisdictional requirements of both Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention and Article 8 of the BIT are satisfied.?3!
1. The Respondent denies that the Claimant made an investment

154. The Respondent asserts that, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over the present dispute,
the dispute must arise out of an “investment” within the meanings of both Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Article 1(a) of the BIT. The Respondent considers that this so-called “double
keyhole” test has been applied by numerous ICSID tribunals and requires this Tribunal to
determine, in order to decide whether the Tribunal has the competence to consider the merits of
the claim: (a) whether the dispute arises out of an investment within the meaning of the
Convention; and, if so, (b) whether the dispute relates to an investment as defined in the Parties’
consent to ICSID arbitration in the BIT, and specifically in the pertinent definitions contained in

Article 1 of the BIT.?3?

155. The Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed at each step and that the Claimant does
not have an “investment” within the meaning of either Article 25 of the ICSID Convention or of
Article 1(a) of the BIT. Accordingly, the Respondent asserts, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over
the present case.

a. The Respondent denies that the Claimant had an investment
under the ICSID Convention

156. The Respondent stresses that, when evaluating its competence to entertain a dispute
submitted to it, an arbitral tribunal sitting pursuant to the ICSID Convention must first discern
whether the case as presented falls within the jurisdictional requirements set out in the
Convention.?33 Article 25 of the ICSID Convention defines the Centre’s jurisdiction as follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of an
investment, between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.

157. The Respondent argues that, although the term “investment” was left undefined by the
drafters of the ICSID Convention, the drafting history leaves no doubt that “it was always clear
that ordinary commercial transactions would not be covered by the Centre’s jurisdiction no matter
how far-reaching the parties’ consent might be.”?34 Referring in particular to the award in Alpha
v. Ukraine?*> and the annulment committee’s decision in Malaysian Salvors v. Malaysia,?*° the
Respondent underlines that several arbitral tribunals have also indicated that ICSID jurisdiction

does not extend to mere commercial agreements.

158. The Respondent emphasizes that some ICSID tribunals have identified a number of
objective criteria that should each be met before a transaction can be considered an investment.
The Respondent considers that these objective criteria form a test — the Salini test — that has become
a widely accepted method to determine whether a claimant’s activities gave rise to a protected
investment under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.237 These objective factors are: (a) the
investor’s participation in the risks of the project; (b) a substantial contribution, (c) a certain

duration; and (d) a contribution to the host State’s economic development.?**

159. According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s activities do not satisfy any of these four
conditions and are at best a simple commercial transaction falling outside the scope of ICSID
jurisdiction. For purposes of argument, the Respondent assumes that the Claimant contends that
the assets that it claims constitute an investment under the BIT also constitute an investment under
the ICSID Convention. Those are i) claims to money under the Contract; ii) movable property in
the form of a factory and equipment; and iii) know-how.?3? However, the Respondent contends
that none of these alleged assets passes the Salini test and none could possibly be considered an
investment under the ICSID Convention. Therefore, the Respondent argues, it is clear that the
Claimant’s activities in Turkmenistan did not give rise to an investment within the meaning of the

ICSID Convention.

160. — First, referring to scholarly commentary and various arbitral awards such as those in Romak

v. Uzbekistan?4? and in Italy v. Cuba?*!, the Respondent explains that the Claimant’s alleged

investment was not characterized by any element of risk. According to the Respondent,
“Construction contracts in which the entrepreneur’s revenues do not depend on the profitability of
the delivered project are not characterized by investment risk.”?4? The Respondent argues that
there are two categories of international construction contracts: (i) “free-standing international
civil engineering contracts,” such as the contract at issue in the present case; and (ii) contracts
which are part of a “network of activities with an entrepreneurial purpose,” such as concession or
build-operate-transfer (“BOT”) contracts. Citing various commentators,?4? the Respondent asserts
that free-standing construction contracts are not affected by investment risk, because the
entrepreneur’s compensation is not a function of the financial results of the delivered project. As

such, they are best analyzed as contracts of sale, not investments.?44

161. The Respondent concludes that, in the present case, the Contract was a free-standing
construction contract which lacked investment risk. It was not part of an economic venture in
which the Claimant would derive all or part of its revenues from the operation of the delivered
works. The Claimant’s compensation under the Contract did not depend upon the commercial
success or failure of the bridges it was to construct. Indeed these are not toll bridges and are not
and were never intended to be acommercial venture. Rather, the bridges were effectively a product
purchased by a party, TAY in this case, that bought bridges from a supplier of that product, Garanti
Koza. Thus, Respondent says, the Contract is best analyzed as a sales contract: The Claimant sold

materials, designs, and construction services in exchange for a fixed price to be paid by TAY.745

162. Second, the Respondent contends that the Claimant cannot point to any contribution it
made that could possibly give rise to an investment. Rather, the Claimant’s activities amounted to
nothing more than an allocation of resources needed to perform its obligations under the Contract.
In the Respondent’s view, the allocation of resources required for the performance of contractual
obligations does not amount to an actual contribution to the host State. Furthermore, the
Respondent stresses that the Claimant’s receipt of an Advance Payment shows that it did not make
acontribution.?4© Referring to scholars?47 and to arbitral jurisprudence,*#8 the Respondent argues
that the structure of the Claimant’s compensation under the Contract, which consisted of an

Advance Payment and progress payments, shows that the contribution element is absent.

163. As to movable property, the Respondent argues that this property was equipment employed
by Garanti Koza to perform its obligations under the Contract, nothing more, and thus constitutes
part of the resources mobilized by Garanti Koza to perform (or not perform) its obligations under
the Contract. The equipment, which according to the Respondent does not even appear to have
been owned by the Claimant, was brought into Turkmenistan for purposes of performing the
project and with the intent of being repatriated at the end of the project.?4? Therefore, in the

Respondent’s view, it cannot be considered a contribution giving rise to an investment.

164. Similarly, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s contention that it acquired know-how

required “to operate the precast plant” only further serves to undermine its claim of investment.

The sole purpose of the Contract was the design and construction of bridges and overpasses. To
the extent any know-how was required to construct the bridges and operate the plant and thus to
perform the Contract, payment for it was included in the price of the Contract. Moreover, under
the express terms of the Contract, the Claimant was required to remove the plant at the end of the
Contract. According to the Respondent, no transfer of know-how was contemplated under the
Contract or any other agreement between the Claimant and TAY, much less between the Claimant
and the Respondent. Thus, the Respondent asserts that TAY was no more a purchaser or a recipient
of know-how than anyone who buys a product from a producer is a purchaser of know-how for
the manufacture of that product. In sum, the Respondent concludes that the contention that the
Claimant had to acquire the know-how to do the exact thing which it was hired to do cannot in any

way be construed as a contribution giving rise to an investment under the Convention.?5°

165. Third, referring to Salini v. Morocco, the Respondent argues that the minimum duration of
an investment must be “from 2 to 5 years”.25!_ The Respondent argues that, in the present case, it
is clear that the duration of the purported investment fell well under the acceptable range. In fact,
the construction period provided for in the Contract was less than one year. Thus, the period in
which Garanti Koza contractually committed to build and deliver the bridges did not satisfy the
duration element. Even taking into account the warranty period in the Contract, the duration of the
project remained under two years. Given this short duration, the Respondent asserts that it is clear

that the Contract does not satisfy the minimum duration condition necessary to be considered an

252

investment.

166. Fourth, and finally, the Respondent argues that various tribunals*>? have found a
contribution to the host State’s development to be a condition for finding an “investment.” The
Respondent contends that the Claimant did not actually complete any of the bridges and instead
left most in a half-finished or completely unfinished state and did not even start five of them.?54
The Claimant thus not only failed to deliver the benefits contemplated under the Contract, in the
Respondent’s view, but it also disrupted the flow of traffic on one of Turkmenistan’s major
arteries. According to the Respondent, “it is thus the height of irony for Claimant to argue that it
should be credited with satisfying the requirement of contributing to Turkmenistan’s development

on this dismal record.”?55

167. For these reasons, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant’s activities under the
Contract do not qualify as an “investment” for purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.
Even if they did, however, the Respondent argues that jurisdiction would still be lacking, since the
Claimant’s activities under the Contract do not qualify as “investments” under the UK-
Turkmenistan BIT.

b. The Respondent denies that the Claimant had an investment
within the meaning of the UK-Turkmenistan BIT

168. Inthe Respondent’s view, the term “investment” as used in Article 1(a) of the BIT must be

interpreted according to its ordinary meaning, in its context and in light of its object and purpose.?>°

The Respondent points to the Preamble of the BIT, which states that its purpose is “to create

favourable conditions for greater investment by nationals and companies of one Contracting Party

into the territory of the other Contracting Party” with the objective of increasing prosperity in both
Contracting Parties, ie. the United Kingdom and Turkmenistan. The requirement that a qualifying
investment in Turkmenistan (ie. “one Contracting Party”) be “of” or “by” anational of the United

Kingdom (ie. “the other Contracting Party”) is repeated throughout the BIT.?57

169. Thus, the Respondent argues that, in order for jurisdiction to exist under the BIT, it is
necessary for the Claimant to prove that there is an “investment” by a “national or company” of
the UK. This, the Respondent argues, in turn requires evidence establishing that the claimed
investment was actually made by the investors claiming protection under the BIT. The Respondent
argues (a) that there was no investment within the meaning of the BIT in this case, and (b) even if

one could find that such an investment existed, that investment was not made by Garanti Koza.

170. The Respondent considers that there has been no investment within the meaning of the
BIT, because, as concluded by various arbitral tribunals, in particular in KT Asia v. Kazakhstan>**,
Romak v. Uzbekistan°? and Italy v. Cuba?®°, an investment must entail a contribution, duration,
and risk. These conditions are identical to the first three conditions set out in the Salini test. The
Respondent argues that the Claimant’s contentions that it made an investment under the treaty via
(a) claims to money under the Contract; (b) movable property in the form of a factory and
equipment; and (c) know-how, have no merit and fall far short of meeting the requisite conditions

of contribution, duration, and risk.

171. Moreover, the Respondent argues that, even if the Claimant could somehow show that its
activities amounted to an investment, such investment cannot be considered an investment “of”
Garanti Koza, the Claimant in this case.?°! In the Respondent’s view, the BIT relates only to
investments by nationals or companies of Contracting Parties. Thus, in order to establish that it has
made an investment, the Claimant would need to show not only that an investment was made, but
it would also have to show that it, ie. Garanti Koza, was the entity who actively made that
investment. The Respondent points out that this necessity has been analyzed at length in several
recent cases, and in particular, in Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania?®?, KT Asia v.
Kazakhstan?® and Caratube v. Kazakhstan.?®* It asserts that, in the present case, it is clear (a) that
in order to fall within the consent to arbitration contained in the BIT the purported investment must
have been made by the claimant-investor, and (b) that no such investment was made by the

Claimant.

172. The Respondent bases its contention that the UK-Turkmenistan BIT requires an active
investment by an investor on the dispute resolution clause of the BIT in Article 8(1). That
provision reads:

Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this Agreement in
relation to an investment of the former which have not been amicably settled
shall, after a period of four [months] from written notification of a claim, be
submitted to international arbitration if the national or company concerned so
wishes. 265

63

173. The Respondent argues that it is clear from the text of the BIT that it requires an active link
between the purported investor and the purported investment. Where, as in the present case, that
link is missing and the purported investor did not play and could not have played an active role in
the alleged investment, the Respondent asserts, the BIT does not apply, the Contracting Parties
have not consented to arbitration to cover a dispute arising from such an alleged investment, and

there is therefore no jurisdiction.?%°

174. The Respondent also argues that, if any investment was made in this case, it was not made
by Garanti Koza, the only Claimant.?°? According to the Respondent, Garanti Koza undertook no
actions and made no investments of its own accord; rather, the bid was submitted and the tender
was won entirely on the basis of the reputation and track record of Garanti Koza insaat (GKD), its
Turkish parent company. It was representatives of GKI, the Respondent argues, who found out
about the opportunity, visited Turkmenistan to gather information on the tender, and ultimately
submitted the bid. They presented themselves not as representatives of Garanti Koza, an unknown
English company, but rather as representatives of GKI, an experienced and well-known Turkish

construction company.

175. The Respondent further argues that, other than the Contract itself and the “curious” know-
how agreement, no records or evidence of the existence of employees, assets, or contracts of
Garanti Koza have been submitted by the Claimant or can be seen from its limited public filings
in the UK. The name of the Claimant’s only witness, Mr. Buyuksandalyaci, appears nowhere in
the public filings of Garanti Koza. Mr. Buyuksandalyaci signed the Contract and its amendments,

not in his alleged capacity as the General Manager of Garanti Koza, but rather as its “authorized

64

representative.” The Respondent considers that Claimant has presented no evidence that Garanti
Koza ever hired or paid any employees. Rather, it argues, most, if not all, of Garanti Koza’s

purported personnel were paid by and understood themselves to be working for GKI.

176. The Respondent asserts that no one at Garanti Koza had decision-making power for the
company. Rather all decisions for Garanti Koza were taken by the board of directors of GKI.
According to the Respondent, “In fact, from the documents available it appears that Garanti Koza
is a passive, paper, company and nothing more. The numbers listed on its letterhead are Turkish,
not British. The website address listed on its website is the Turkish website of Garanti Koza insaat.
The physical address, while it is British, curiously happens to be the same as that of the company’s

accountants.”

177. For these reasons, the Respondent argues that Garanti Koza did not actively make an
investment within the meaning of the BIT or of the ICSID Convention. Failure to make an
investment within the meaning of either treaty, in the Respondent’s view, requires that the
Claimant’s claims be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.?°8

2. The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s claims allege a breach of
contract rather than a treaty violation

178. The Respondent’s second principal objection to jurisdiction is that the fundamental
character of the claims asserted in this arbitration is that of a contractual dispute between Garanti
Koza and TAY, not a violation by Turkmenistan of its obligations under the BIT.2®° In the words
of the Respondent, “the litany of complaints asserted by Claimant — alleged failures to handover
sites and information; alleged payment delays; alleged changes to payment terms, wrongful
termination of contract due to delays, attachment of assets to satisfy amounts owed — all of these
268 C-Mem. {{ 241-249; Rej. 273-274.

are classic by-products of construction projects gone wrong, where each side blames the other for

the failure to complete and deliver the final product contemplated by the parties.”?7°

179. The Respondent contends that the proper forum for determination of these contractual
disputes is the Arbitrazh Court of Turkmenistan, which is the forum designated for disputes arising
out of the Contract. In disregard of this contractual commitment, the Respondent argues, Garanti
Koza brought an ICSID arbitration against Turkmenistan, despite the fact that the State is not a
party to the Contract at issue in this case.?7! The Respondent asserts that the BIT does not afford
jurisdiction over contractual claims. No matter how the Claimant tries to “dress up” its claims with
allegations of State action, the Respondent argues, the essential basis of the claims is obviously

contractual, 772

180. The Respondent argues that the dispute resolution clause of the BIT limits claims to
disputes arising from the BIT, and does not extend to “purely contract” matters. Tribunals have
jurisdiction only over treaty claims, the Respondent continues, and cannot entertain purely

contractual claims which do not amount to claims for violations of the BIT.?”3 Referring to several

arbitral precedents,”+ and to the Concurring Opinion of Professor Abi-Saab in TSA Spectnum,2?7>

the Respondent contends that this rule is consistent with the generally accepted principle that

present proceedings, the alleged treaty breaches “necessarily pass by or posit a contract violation

as a fundamental element of or premise of its cause of action.”277

181. The Respondent argues that the Umbrella Clause in the BIT does not transform generic
contract claims into treaty claims.?’® Contractual claims remain contract claims, the Respondent
argues, regardless of the presence of an umbrella clause in the underlying BIT.27? The Respondent
points to numerous tribunals that have expressed concern about the negative consequences that
would follow from giving umbrella clauses the power to transform a dispute in the manner the
Claimant suggests and which for that reason have declined to follow the authorities upon which

the Claimant relies. 76°

182. Indeed, the Respondent argues, without a determination that the Contract was breached by
Turkmenistan, Garanti Koza cannot make out a prima facie showing of a treaty claim?*! It

follows, the Respondent argues, that the Claimant can advance no viable treaty claim, because

each of its claims necessarily posits that the alleged conduct was in violation of the Contract.?8?

183. The Respondent also argues that, where the basis of a claim is contractual, a tribunal must

honor a forum selection clause in a contract. Thus, even if the dispute resolution clause of a BIT

grants jurisdiction over contract-based claims, forum-selection clauses (and other provisions) of
individual agreements remain enforceable. According to the Respondent, “A different solution
would run roughshod over the clear text of the contract reflecting the will of the parties, in total
disregard of the principles of party autonomy and pacta sunt servanda. It would render ‘inutile’ or
without effect the contractual stipulation on the choice of forum, giving to a jurisdictional clause
in a BIT the effect of superseding all choice of forum contractual stipulations between parties to a
dispute, once one of them invokes the jurisdictional clause of the BIT.”28>
B. The Claimant’s Responses to the Additional Jurisdictional Objections
184. In its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction and Reply Memorial on the Merits, the Claimant
responds to the two jurisdictional objections raised by the Respondent in conjunction with the
merits: (1) that the Claimant did not make an investment in Turkmenistan within the meaning of
the ICSID Convention and the BIT; and (2) that the Claimant’s claims are contractual, not claims
arising under the treaty.?®4 Garanti Koza asserts that it made an investment within the meaning of
both Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, that its claims arise under the BIT, and
that the Tribunal, therefore, has jurisdiction over the present dispute.
1. The Claimant affirms that it made an investment

185. Garanti Koza asserts that Turkmenistan’s approach — which examines separately against
the elements of the so-called Salini test each component of the Claimant’s claims, namely (i)
claims to money under the Contract, (iil) movable property and (iii) know-how, to conclude that
none of the Claimant’s activities in Turkmenistan qualify as “investment” under the ICSID

Convention — is incorrect.

186. The Claimant cites prior cases?8> to show that investment treaty tribunals have adopted a
holistic approach to determine the existence of an investment under the ICSID Convention. The
various components of which investments are typically comprised must be viewed collectively.
The Claimant concludes that “the Tribunal therefore need not reach a determination on whether
each of the components of Garanti Koza’s investment would constitute a stand-alone investment.
Garanti Koza’s investment in Turkmenistan, when viewed holistically, clearly qualifies as an

“investment.

a. The Claimant affirms that it had an investment under the
ICSID Convention

i. The Salini test should not apply
187. The Claimant questions whether the Salini test should be applied, even in the ICSID
context, to determine if an operation qualifies as an “investment” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID

Convention.

188. The Claimant relies on the award in Inmaris v. Ukraine to assert that a subjective approach
to the definition of “investment” under Article 25(1) of the Convention, with reference to the
definition in the BIT, is more consistent with the fact that the drafters of the ICSID Convention
intentionally left the term “investment” undefined in Article 25(1) than a more restrictive definition

through the imposition of criteria, and is, therefore, preferable.?87

ii. Alternatively, the Salini test is satisfied
189. The Claimant nevertheless argues in the alternative that, if the Tribunal opts to apply the
Salini test, it should follow the ICSID cases that view the test as a set of flexible and liberal
characteristics, as opposed to imposing jurisdictional conditions all of which have to be met for an
asset to qualify as an investment. The Claimant asserts that, in any event, its investment fulfils the

criteria of the Salini test.

190. As a starting point, the Claimant submits that ICSID tribunals have consistently accepted
that construction contracts and related operations qualify as “investments” under Article 25(1) of
the Convention, meeting the Salini test where required. The Claimant further states that
Turkmenistan has not provided any example ofan investment treaty decision to the opposite effect,
and there is to the Claimant’s knowledge no such case. Garanti Koza refers to Pantechniki v.
Albania as an example of ICSID tribunals’ approach to the application of the Salini test and the
definition of investment and to the most recent (2009) edition of Christoph Schreuer’s treatise to
support the above. The Claimant, therefore, considers that Turkmenistan’s submission, that

Garanti Koza’s investment is a mere contract for the sale of goods and services, is misplaced.

191. The Claimant further argues that the alleged components of the Salini test, ie. (a) the
investor’s participation in the risks of the project, (b) a substantial contribution, (c) a certain

duration, and (d) a contribution to the host State’s economic development, are all met in this case.

70

192. Risk. Garanti Koza relies on case law,?8° independent reports on the investment climate in
Turkmenistan,”®° and academic commentaries?®° to support its position that, in the present case,a
tisk existed and it was multifold. The risk included the poor business environment in Turkmenistan
and the fact that, because the lump sum price was fixed, Garanti Koza bore the risk of variations
in the works, the risk of a potential increase in the cost of labour and raw material, and the risk of
any accident or damage to property during the performance of the work. The fact that
Turkmenistan had paid an Advance Payment does not, according to the Claimant, impact the

existence ofa risk, as noted by the tribunal in Saipem v. Bangladesh.

193. Contribution. The Claimant submits that it is disputed whether the “contribution” criterion
should be included in the Salini test.2°! Garanti Koza repeats that investment treaty tribunals
assessing whether construction contracts met the “contribution” criterion have all answered the
question positively. By way of examples in support of this submission, the Claimant refers to Salini
v. Morocco, Jan de Nul v. Egypt, Bayindir v. Pakistan, and Saipem v. Bangladesh. The Claimant
points out that, in the latter case, the tribunal stressed that the contribution can be in kind and in

industry, not only in money, while the origin of the funds is irrelevant.

194. Garanti Koza submits that it made contributions similar to the ones identified in the case
law, namely contributions in money, kind and industry. These included building a production

factory, providing the necessary equipment and personnel, providing the necessary know-how

relating to the factory, purchasing raw material, paying the workforce, and providing a bank

guarantee to Turkmenistan.

195. The Claimant argues that, in any event, Garanti Koza’s investment involved the
construction of bridges and overpasses ona Turkmen highway and was part of the implementation
of the National Plan launched by the Turkmen government for the renovation of Turkmen
infrastructure. Tribunals deciding cases relating to infrastructure projects, such as Salini v.
Morocco and Bayindir v. Pakistan, have been prompt to regard such investments as contributing

to the host state’s development.

196. Duration. Garanti Koza submits that Turkmenistan’s approach is flawed in that it treats
the criterion of duration as a jurisdictional one. Even if that criterion was not met, it would not be
decisive, as all the other criteria are met. The Claimant calculates the Project’s duration, including
warranty period, at about two years and seven months. The duration criterion is therefore, to the
extent required, met in this case. The Claimant supports the basis of its calculation of the duration
of the Project on the findings in Bayindir v. Pakistan and Saipem v. Bangladesh.

b. The Claimant affirms that it had an investment within the
meaning of the BIT

i. Garanti Koza made the investment
197. In response to the Respondent’s contention that the Claimant’s investment does not qualify
as an investment under the BIT, because the investment was not made by Garanti Koza itself, but
by its parent company, GKI, Garanti Koza responds, first, by distinguishing this dispute from those
in Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania, KT Asia v. Kazakhstan, and Caratube v. Kazakhstan, on

which Turkmenistan relies to argue that “an investment must be actively invested by the claimant

72

in order to fall within the ambit of the treaty and consequently within the jurisdiction of the

tribunal, "292

198.

a.

Garanti Koza asserts that Turkmenistan’s argument should be rejected because:
The Standard Chartered Bank Award (which, the Claimant submits, has limited
authoritative value) focused its analysis on the wording of the applicable BIT.
That wording is different from that in the UK-Turkmenistan BIT. The latter
refers to an investment “of,” as opposed to an investment “made,” by the investor.
The “investment made” wording was at the core of the tribunal's reasoning in

Standard Chartered, so the reasoning in that case is not transposable to this one.

. The facts are distinct: Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania involved an indirect

investment in Tanzania by a UK company, through several layers of subsidiaries.
Garanti Koza instead made a direct investment in Turkmenistan.

Unlike the situation presented in the Standard Chartered case, Garanti Koza took
all the steps in the life of the investment and was an active, as opposed to a passive

investor.

. The paragraphs of KT Asia v. Kazakhstan and Caratube v. Kazakhstan relied on by

Turkmenistan refer to the application of the Salini test and the existence of an

investment and are, therefore, irrelevant to the ownership of the investment.

Second, Garanti Koza argues that it was Garanti Koza, and not GKI, that made the

investment in Turkmenistan. The facts relied upon by the Claimant are:?93

292

293

a.

None of Turkmenistan’s three fact witnesses argued that GKI, as opposed to

Garanti Koza, was the investor.

Reply { 166.
Reply { 168.

73

. The Contract was entered into between Turkmenistan and Garanti Koza and was

approved by more than nine Turkmen Government Authorities.

The Presidential Decree names Garanti Koza and not GKI.

. Turkmenistan registered the Project under the name of Garanti Koza, not GKI.
All the equipment was either owned or leased by Garanti Koza, showing that
Garanti Koza was an active investor.

Garanti Koza, not GKI, opened a branch and a bank account in Turkmenistan for
the purposes of the Project.

Turkmenistan’s Central Bank paid the amounts due under Garanti Koza’s
Certificates of Payment to a bank account in the name of Garanti Koza, not GKI.
The location of the bank account in Turkey is irrelevant; Turkmenistan took no
issue with this arrangement at the time and even signed Amendment No.1 to the
Contract to agree that payment should be made to that bank account.

Turkmen Tax Authorities audited Garanti Koza’s accounts and never alleged that
Garanti Koza was not the actual investor in Turkmenistan.

The court proceedings commenced by the Turkmen prosecutor at the request of
Turkmen Highways and the resulting decisions were all against Garanti Koza, not
GKL

Garanti Koza, not GKI, entered into contracts with subcontractors, such as Net
Yapi and Turkmencement.

Unpaid creditors of Garanti Koza (which itself was not being paid by

Turkmenistan) commenced suits against Garanti Koza, not GKI, before Turkmen

74

courts, as seen in the documents relating to these proceedings produced by
Turkmenistan.

1 Unpaid employees commenced suits against Garanti Koza, not GKI, before
Turkmen courts, showing that Garanti Koza was their employer.

m. Turkmenistan’s submission that “it also appears that no one in Garanti Koza had
decision making power for the company” is incorrect. Garanti Koza is a limited
liability company, consisting of three partners; Garanti Koza Insaat, which owns
45%, IP (International) Consult Ltd., which also owned 45% until it was replaced
by one of its affiliates (Eurasia Motors), and Mr. Turgut, who owns 10%.
Important decisions, such as entering into the Contract, the Factory Agreement
and the Know-How Agreement, were made after discussion and with the
agreement of all three partners.

n. The Know-How Agreement provided for the know-how needed and used for the
Project, which included advanced technology not available at that time in
Turkmenistan. The Know-How Agreement was approved by all three partners of
Garanti Koza. It is severe for Turkmenistan, the Claimant argues, “to basically
accuse Garanti Koza of fraud and to state that ’the only other explanation for this
curious contract [i.e. the Know-How Agreement] is that it is a mechanism to

divert funds to Garanti Koza Insaat.

199. Third, in response to Turkmenistan’s submissions on Garanti Koza’s public financial
statements on file in the UK, the Claimant states that its accountant in the UK had, perhaps

inaccurately, advised Garanti Koza that there was no need to file full information about the

75

company’s employees, assets, or contracts. Those financial statements are in any event immaterial,

in light of the above facts.?°*

200. Finally, Garanti Koza asserts that arbitral tribunals have consistently accepted that
investments made by special-purpose vehicles qualify for protection under investment treaties, in
the absence of language to the contrary in the treaty. The BIT does not contain any language
excluding investments by special-purpose vehicles from its scope. To read such language into the
text of the treaty would be contrary to Article 31 of the VCLT.?9°

ii. Garanti Koza’s investment within the meaning of the
BIT

201. The Claimant asserts that the application of the Salini test to the definition of “investment”
under the BIT has been rejected by the majority of arbitral tribunals and is irreconcilable with
Article 31 of the VCLT.2°© The Claimant argues that investment treaty tribunals, such as the
tribunal in Bayindir v. Pakistan, have generally concluded that construction contracts constitute

investments under the applicable BITs.

202. In line with that case law, Garanti Koza submits that it has made an investment, falling
within the definition of “investment” in Article 1 of the BIT. Garanti Koza’s activities in
Turkmenistan involve: (a) the Contract, Le. “claims to money orto any performance under contract
having a financial value;”?9” (b) a factory, which, since it is prefabricated and can be disassembled,

is “movable” property;?°8 (c) equipment, also “movable” property;?9° and (d) the Know-How

Contract, ie. “technical processes and know-how; all of which constitute “assets” falling
within the non-exhaustive list of assets qualifying as an “investment” in Article 1(a) of the BIT.

2. The Claimant denies that its claims allege a breach of contract rather
than a treaty violation

203. The Claimant asserts that Turkmenistan errs in arguing that Garanti Koza’s claims are
“purely contractual.”?°! Garanti Koza’s causes of action arise out of provisions of the BIT and not

of the Contract.

204. According to the Claimant, the case law relied upon by Turkmenistan does not support its
argument. In each of SGS v. Pakistan, El Paso v. Argentina, Pan American v. Argentina, Hamester
v. Ghana, Abaclat v. Argentina and Malicorp v. Egypt, the tribunals found that they had jurisdiction
to consider treaty claims where the dispute arose, at least in part, out of an underlying contract.
The existence of an underlying Contract, as part of the factual matrix, thus does not preclude the
Tribunals jurisdiction. To establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, Garanti Koza argues, it need only
make out a prima facie case that the claims stated fall within the purview of the substantive
protections of the BIT. The Claimant further relies on Salini v. Morocco and Azurix v. Argentina

in support of this position.

205. Garanti Koza further submits that there is no basis for Turkmenistan to seek to introduce a
new condition for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction — that the “treaty claim must be “self-standing.”
Such an additional condition appears to have no basis other than the Concurring Opinion of

Arbitrator Abi-Saab in TSA v. Argentina; it lacks any other support in the abundant case law.

3. The Claimant affirms that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over Garanti
Koza’s umbrella clause claim

206. The Claimant takes issue with the Respondent’s argument that an umbrella clause “does
not transform generic contract claims into treaty claims” and that the Tribunal therefore has no
jurisdiction over the Claimant’s umbrella clause claim. The Claimant asserts that the majority of
tribunals and commentators have accepted the “elevating” effect of umbrella clauses, applying
their ordinary meaning in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT.

a. Turkmenistan’s reading is inconsistent with the origins of the
umbrella clause

207. Garanti Koza asserts that the origins of the umbrella clause make it clear that its effect is
precisely what Turkmenistan claims it is not: to elevate contractual breaches into treaty
breaches.*°? The Claimant relies on analyses on the origins of the umbrella clause by A.C. Sinclair,
J. Wong, E. Gaillard, the Shawcross Draft Convention on Investments Abroad, and the OECD
Draft Convention on the Protection of Foreign Property.

b. Turkmenistan’s contention is contrary to arbitral

jurisprudence

208. Garanti Koza submits that, contrary to Turkmenistan’s argument that an umbrella clause
“does not transform generic contract claims into treaty claims,” the vast majority of arbitral
tribunals have ruled that the effect of an umbrella clause is precisely to elevate contractual claims

into treaty claims.

209. The SGS v. Pakistan award under the Switzerland-Pakistan BIT, on which Turkmenistan
relies, has been widely and heavily criticised, including by the Swiss Government and the tribunals
in SGS v. Philippines and Eureko v. Poland.*% Similarly, the few other decisions relied upon by

304 Reply 4 239-243.

78

Turkmenistan, ie. Joy Mining v. Egypt, El Paso, Pan American Energy v. Argentina, and Toto v.
Lebanon, depend upon a restrictive interpretation of the umbrella clause.*°° Such a restrictive
interpretation has been rejected by most tribunals, including those in Noble Ventures v. Romania,

LG&E v. Argentina, SGS v. Paraguay, and EDF v. Argentina.>®

210. The Claimant submits that the correct approach is to apply a plain-and-ordinary- meaning
interpretation to the BIT that gives effect to the umbrella clause. The plain language of the umbrella
clause does not differentiate between undertakings of acommercial nature and those of a sovereign
nature. “Any obligation” means just that, and a different reading would require serious justification
to be consistent with the VCLT. In any event, the distinction between “commercial” and
“sovereign” obligations and breaches is irrelevant in this case, as Turkmenistan breached its
obligations through sovereign, not commercial actions.37

c Authoritative commentators have rejected the restrictive
interpretation of umbrella clauses urged by Turkmenistan

211. The Claimant lists a number of analyses by authoritative commentators that, it argues,
confirm its submission that an umbrella clause elevates contractual breaches to treaty claims and,
therefore, that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to determine the Claimant’s claims under the umbrella
clause of the BIT.3°8 It quotes Stanimir Alexandrov’s statement that: “the very purpose and the
effect of an umbrella clause in an investment treaty is to transform breaches of obligations the
State has undertaken with respect to the foreign investor and its investment, including contractual

obligations, into treaty breaches.”309

4, The Claimant affirms that Turkmenistan is a party to the Contract
212. Turkmenistan argues it is not a party to the Contract and that, “if a foreign investor’s
contract is not with the central government of the State, then the conduct complained of must meet
the traditional tests for internationally wrongful acts in order to incur international
responsibility.”3!° Garanti Koza argues that Turkmenistan’s position is irreconcilable with Article
1.1(a) of the Contract Conditions. That article provides that: “Owner means State Concern
‘Turkmenavtoyollary’ acting on behalf of Turkmenistan Government and includes its own

representatives and successors.”?!!

213. In any event, (i) the Claimant argues that its claims are for breaches of BIT provisions, so
that whether or not Turkmenistan was a party to the Contract is not determinative of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction, and (ii) the Claimant’s claims relate to a multitude of instances of misconduct by

various organs of Turkmenistan and are not limited to breaches of the Contract by TAY.?!?

214. The Claimant disagrees with Turkmenistan’s submission that Turkmen Highways was
acting as a private party in a purely commercial capacity. The Claimant advances the following
arguments to rebut that conclusion.*!?

a. The Contract implemented, in part, the National Plan of Turkmenistan and a
Presidential Decree for the renovation of Turkmenistan’s infrastructure.

b. In Turkmenistan, the Contract and the Project were considered to create an
“administrative law relation” and not to be of a commercial nature. This appears from
the law relied upon and the procedure followed by Turkmenistan before the general

prosecutor and the Turkmen courts. The procedure Turkmenistan followed for the

termination of the Contract, through the involvement of the Supreme Control Chamber
(which deals with public funds), indicates that neither Turkmen Highways nor
Turkmenistan was acting as a private party in a purely commercial relationship.

c. The Contract was approved by several Turkmen Government Authorities, while the
Presidential Decree lists over ten governmental bodies involved in the performance of
the Contract.

d. The Presidential Decree states that the Project is to be financed from the State budget.
The few invoices of Garanti Koza that were paid were paid by the Central Bank of
Turkmenistan.

e. Mr. Nepesoy, called by Turkmenistan as a fact witness, referred in his First Witness

Statement to “public law works” and “governmental contracts.”
215. The Claimant argues that the test for resolving asovereign—or—-commercial question, where
provisions of a treaty are breached, is whether the Host State reasonably acted as an ordinary
contracting party or went beyond that.3!4 The Claimant submits that Turkmenistan went beyond
acting as an ordinary contracting party, with the most indicative example of such conduct being

the imposition of the Smeta.

216. In response to Turkmenistan’s further objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the basis
of the forum selection clause in the Contract, the Claimant argues that the forum selection clause
in the Contract is not an exclusive one. The Claimant asserts that case law?!> supports its position
that, even if the forum selection clause in the Contract were exclusive, a cause of action under a
treaty is not subject to an exclusive jurisdiction clause in an underlying contract, regardless of
whether the treaty claims relate to contractual issues. Garanti Koza argues that the authorities cited

by Turkmenistan deal with purely contractual disputes and are thus irrelevant to claims under a

BIT. The jurisdiction of the Tribunal is not affected, the Claimant argues, by the forum selection

clause in the Contract.7!¢

217. For these reasons, the Claimant asserts, the Tribunal should conclude that the Claimant
actively made an investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, and that
its claims arise under the BIT and are not purely contractual. Garanti Koza therefore invites the
Tribunal to reject both of the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and to confirm its jurisdiction
to hear this arbitration.
Cc The Tribunal’s Analysis Concerning Jurisdiction
218. For the reasons stated below, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s additional objections
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
1. The Claimant is an investor

219. The BIT contains no definition of “investor.” Rather, its substantive provisions provide
various protections to “investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.’”3!7
The meaning of “investments” will be considered in the next section of this Award; we focus first

on “companies.”

220. Article 1(d) of the BIT defines “companies” to mean: “in respect of the United Kingdom:
corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in any part
of the United Kingdom [...].” The Claimant, Garanti Koza LLP, was registered as a limited
liability partnership with the Registrar of Companies for England and Wales on April 24, 2007,
with a registered address at 45 Welbeck Street, London W1G 8DZ, U.K.3!8 The Respondent has

not argued that a limited liability partnership is not a corporation, firm, or association within the

316 Reply 4 269-274.
317 BIT Art. 2(2); see also BIT Arts.3, 4, 5.
318 R92.

82

meaning of Article 1(d) of the BIT. The Claimant is accordingly a “company” of the United

Kingdom within the meaning of that article.

221. The Respondent argues that, while Garanti Koza may have been an English company, it
served merely as a facade for its Turkish parent GKI, which was the entity that actually provided
personnel and material for the project in Turkmenistan and which would not qualify as a company
of the United Kingdom. This argument finds some support in the Claimant’s own papers, which
charge, for example, that the investment climate in Turkmenistan “has proved to be particularly
unwelcoming, especially for investors of Turkish origin,” !° and that it “has become particularly

hostile for Turkish investors.32°

222. However, the BIT requires only that Garanti Koza be incorporated somewhere in the
United Kingdom in order to bring its investments within the protection of the treaty. The BIT
contains no denial-of-benefits clause that would require that a U.K. investor have actual operations
in the U.K. And the weight of the evidence shows that Turkmenistan knew and accepted that it

was dealing with an English company.

223. To begin with, the Contract identifies TAY’s counterparty as “‘Garanti Koza LLP’
Company (England).”3?!_ The Presidential Decree authorizing TAY to enter into the Contract
similarly refers to the winner of the bid as “‘Garanti Koza LLP’ company (UK)” and refers to its
UK nationality in three places.3?? Turkmenistan’s Ministry of Economy and Development entered

‘Garanti Koza LLP’ company (UK).”323 Contracts with subcontractors were entered into by
Garanti Koza, not GKI.74 The Central Bank of Turkmenistan made payments under the Contract
to an account in the name of Garanti Koza.325 The tax authorities of Turkmenistan audited the
accounts of Garanti Koza, not GKI.32° And court judgments in proceedings commenced by unpaid

employees were entered against Garanti Koza, not GKI.*77

224. GKI may well have seconded personnel to Garanti Koza and provided the construction
expertise needed to build the bridges called for by the Contract, but that was not concealed from
TAY or anyone else in Turkmenistan. Indeed, Garanti Koza emphasized GKI’s experience and
expertise in bidding for the project. Garanti Koza’s marketing brochure described GKI’s history
since 1948, beginning with “Established in Ankara as Garanti Insaat Ltd., as a subsidiary of Garanti
Bankasi.”328 Among the prior projects listed in that brochure was “Mary-Uchi Highway Bridges,
Turkmenistan,” which must have been a project familiar to the Respondent. In addition, while
GK is often referred to by the Respondent as Garanti Koza’s “parent,” GKI appears to have owned

only 45% of Garanti Koza.3?9

225. The Tribunal concludes that: (a) Garanti Koza, as a U.K. company, meets the nationality
requirement of the BIT; and (b) Garanti Koza is the investor whose claim to have made an

investment in Turkmenistan (out of which the present dispute arises) is to be tested.

2. The Claimant made an investment in Turkmenistan
226. The Claimant brings this proceeding under Article 8 of the BIT, which permits an investor
of one Contracting Party (in this case, the United Kingdom) to refer to arbitration a dispute with
the other Contracting Party (in this case, Turkmenistan) “concerning an obligation of the latter

under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former.”33°

227. We therefore turn to whether the Claimant made an investment in Turkmenistan. That
inquiry will take us, first, to whether Claimant made an investment as that term is defined in Article
1 of the BIT. Second, it will take us to whether the Claimant’s claim arises out of an investment
as that term is used in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The Respondent argues that the
Claimant can meet neither standard; the Claimant argues that it meets both. The Claimant, it is
well established, “has the burden of demonstrating that its claims fall within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.”33!
a. The Claimant made an “investment” under the BIT

228. Article 1(a) of the BIT defines “investment” to mean “every kind of asset,” and provides a
list, which is stated to be not exclusive, to illustrate what is included in that term. That list includes
the following types of assets, all of which, the Claimant argues, are descriptive of some aspect of
its investment in Turkmenistan:

e “Moveable and immoveable property and any other property rights such as

mortgages, liens, or pledges;”

e “Claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial

value;” and
330 BIT Art. 8(1). See Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent, Appendix A.
331 RL-88, Bayindir v. Pakistan, 192.

85

e “Intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes, and know-

how.”332

229. Unlike some treaties, the BIT does not specify any particular relationship between the
claimant and the investment necessary for the treaty to apply and for jurisdiction to attach.
Following VCLT Article 31, the Tribunal therefore considers the “ordinary meaning” of the treaty

terms, in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT.

230. Although the Respondent argues that, to meet the definition in the BIT, an investment must
have been “actively made” by the claimant, that argument finds no support in the ordinary meaning
of the words used in Article 1 of the BIT. Rather, the Respondent attempts to tie this requirement
to the wording of Article 8 of the BIT, and specifically to its requirement that disputes submitted
to arbitration must concern “an obligation of the [state party] under this Agreement in relation to

an investment of the [claimant].”344

231. The Respondent’s attempt to read into the language of the BIT a condition that an
investment have been “actively made” by the Claimant appears to have been imported from the
award in Standard Chartered Bank v. Tanzania.*** In that decision, the tribunal concluded, from
what appears to this Tribunal to have been a somewhat strained reading of the words “of,” “by,”
and “made” in the U.K.-Tanzania BIT, that “the text of the BIT reveals that the treaty protects
investments ‘made’ by an investor in some active way, rather than simple passive ownership.”
Nothing in the reasoning of that award leads this Tribunal to read into the BIT before us a

requirement that an investment must have been “actively made.”

332 BIT Art. I(a).
333 BIT Art. 8(1).
334 RL-112.

86

232. In any event, Garanti Koza’s investment appears to this Tribunal to have been “actively
made” as that term was used in Standard Chartered Bank, in that it was not merely held by a
passive investor. While we understand the Respondent’s claim that Garanti Koza was merely the
fagade behind which GKI contracted with Turkmenistan, we have already rejected that
characterization of the facts before us. Garanti Koza used personnel, experience, and technology
provided by GKI, but it appears to this Tribunal that Garanti Koza negotiated a contract to build
bridges for TAY in Turkmenistan, put resources into the country, and actually built a number of

bridges.

233. Garanti Koza’s performance came to an end before it completed its assignment, and
Garanti Koza is open to criticism for how long even that performance took, but it is clear from the
record before this Tribunal that Garanti Koza engaged in the actual building of highway bridges
in the territory of one of the Contracting Parties to the BIT. The tribunal in Bayindir v. Pakistan

observed that “The construction of a highway is more than construction in the traditional sense;”

it “implies substantial resources during significant periods of time’” and “‘clearly qualifies as an
investment.’”>3° The same is true of the construction of bridges. Garanti Koza’s performance may

have fallen short, but it was not a mere passive investor.

234. Garanti Koza made an investment of equipment and material resources — moveable
property — while carrying out in Turkmenistan at least a portion of the obligations it undertook to
perform under a contract having a financial value - USD 100 million in gross value. For what it
is worth, Garanti Koza devoted activity to making that investment, for as long as its efforts
continued, and it left behind a number of bridges that are being used by the Respondent today.

87

The Tribunal therefore concludes that Garanti Koza made an investment in Turkmenistan within
the meaning of Article 1 of the BIT.

b. The claims arise out of an investment as required by Article 25
of the ICSID Convention

235. Since this arbitration was brought at ICSID under the ICSID Rules,?3° the Claimant also
has the obligation to show that the present dispute arises “directly out of” its investment, as

required by Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

236. It is notorious that the drafters of the ICSID Convention chose not to include a definition
of the term “investment” in the text of the Convention.>37 That term was examined by the tribunal
in Fedax v. Venezuela, the first ICSID case in which jurisdiction was objected to on the grounds
that the asset held by the claimant (in that case, six promissory notes) did not qualify as an
investment. The Fedax tribunal found that the Convention “provided a broad framework for the

definition of investment,” and contemplated a “very broad meaning” for that term.>78

237. In that context, the Fedax tribunal examined and listed the “basic features of an
investment,” 35° but it did not hold that all, or indeed any, of these features must be present in every
case. Indeed, the Fedax tribunal had little difficulty in concluding that the promissory notes at

issue in that case (which hardly manifested all the features on the list) qualified as “investments”

336 See Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent, Appendix A to this Award, {{] 96-97.

337 Antonio R. Parra, THE HISTORY OF ICSID (Oxford 2012), pp. 80-81, 276-277. Mr. Parra says that
Aaron Broches, the General Counsel of the World Bank who was the driving force behind the ICSID Convention
and who became the first Secretary General of ICSID, once observed that, “while it might be difficult to define
‘investment,’ an investment was in fact readily recognizable.” The History of ICSID, n. 110. See also RL-108, Fedax

for purposes of the ICSID Convention, observing that the notes were intended for international

circulation, and, when endorsed to a foreign holder, constituted an investment.*4°

238. A number of later decisions in investment treaty arbitrations, following the lead of the
decision in Salini v. Morocco, treated the Fedax list of features that may characterize an
investment, as the Respondent asks us to do in this case, as a test that a particular claimant’s asset
must pass to be recognized as an investment within the reach of the ICSID Convention.*4! This is

commonly referred to, including by both the Claimant and the Respondent, as the Salini test.>4?

239. No such test seems to this Tribunal to be called for in this case. Certainly, the term
“investment” as used in the ICSID Convention must have some meaning, even if the Convention
itself does not define it. But, as the tribunal in Enron v. Argentina explained, “As the ICSID
Convention did not attempt to define ‘investment,’ this task was left largely to the parties to
bilateral investment treaties or other expressions of consent.” As the ad hoc annulment committee
observed in Malaysia Historical Salvors:

It is those bilateral and multilateral treaties which today are the engine of ICSID’s effective
jurisdiction. To ignore or depreciate the importance of the jurisdiction they bestow upon
ICSID, and rather to i i ofthe term “i
as found in Article 25(1) of the Convention, risks crippling the institution.*49

 

240. “It would go too far,” the tribunal in SGS v. Paraguay suggested, “to suggest that any
definition of investment agreed by states in a BIT [...] must constitute an ‘investment’ for purposes

of Article 25(1).’344 Rather, that tribunal sensibly adopted the approach of the tribunal in BIVAC,

by defining the relevant question as whether “the definition [of investment] in the BIT exceed[s]

what is permissible under the Convention.”345

241. The Generation Ukraine tribunal observed that, while the ICSID Convention did not define
“investment,” it permits Contracting Parties to agree on a definition in a separate legal instrument,
such as the BIT.*4° This Tribunal has determined that Garanti Koza had an investment in
Turkmenistan within the meaning of the term “investment” as defined in the BIT. Neither the
nature of the Claimant’s investment itself nor the definition of “investment” in the BIT “exceed[s]
what is permissible under the Convention’”?47 or is “absurd or patently incompatible with [the]
object and purpose” of the ICSID Convention.*48 Garanti Koza’s investment is accordingly readily

recognizable as an investment permissible under the Convention.

242. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimant’s burden of showing that its investment
that is the subject of this arbitration falls within the meaning of “investment” as used in the ICSID
Convention as well as in the BIT is satisfied by the Tribunal’s conclusion that the Claimant’s
investment comes within the definition of “investment” in the BIT and that nothing about that
definition or the Claimant’s investment itself exceeds what is permissible under the ICSID

Convention or is incompatible with its purpose. Article 8 of the BIT (as interpreted in the

90

Tribunal’s Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent)*4° therefore entitles the
Claimant to demand arbitration of a dispute arising directly out of its investment before an ICSID
tribunal.
3. The claims arise under the BIT

243. The Respondent’s final objection to jurisdiction is that the Respondent believes that the
Claimant’s claims arise under the Contract, rather than under the BIT, and that its claims are
therefore subject to the clause in the Contract requiring disputes to be submitted to the Arbitration
Court of Turkmenistan. This objection is effectively a challenge to the sufficiency of the

Claimant’s “umbrella clause” claim under the obligations provision of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

244. If, indeed, the Claimant’s claims amounted merely to claims for breach of contract, the
Tribunal would agree with the Respondent that such claims would be beyond the jurisdiction of
an ICSID tribunal and also that they would be subject to the forum-selection clause in the Contract.
Tf, on the other hand, as the Claimant argues, the Claimant’s claims are for breaches of the BIT
arising out of the Claimant’s investment in Turkmenistan, this Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear
them. The Bayindir tribunal observed that “the fact that a State may be exercising a contractual
right or remedy does not of itself exclude the possibility of a treaty breach.”35° Rather, that tribunal
explained, “treaty claims are juridically distinct from claims for breach of contract, even where
they arise out of the same facts,” and “when the investor has a right under both the contract and

the treaty, it has a self-standing right to pursue the remedy accorded by the treaty.”35!

can give rise to different claims grounded on differing legal orders: the municipal and the international legal orders.”
RL-118, SGS v. Pakistan,{ 147.

91

245. The fact that the Contract provides for resolution of disputes arising under the Contract in
the Arbitration Court of Turkmenistan does not deprive this Tribunal of jurisdiction over claims
pleaded and arising under the BIT. As the ad hoc committee in Vivendi I observed: “A state cannot
rely on an exclusive jurisdiction clause in a contract to avoid the characterisation of its conduct as
internationally unlawful under a treaty.”?>? The tribunal in SGS v. Paraguay explained that “this

tule applies with equal force in the context of an umbrella clause.”353

246. The answer to this objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is that the Claimant has
asserted multiple claims under the BIT. In addition to its umbrella clause claim, the Claimant also
asserts claims for direct and indirect expropriation, for denial of fair and equitable treatment, for
unreasonable and discriminatory measures, and for denial of full protection and security.
‘Whatever merit each of those claims may have, each is stated as a claim arising under the BIT, not
under the Contract. This Tribunal has no jurisdiction to adjudicate whatever contract claims the

Claimant may have, and will not attempt to do so.

247. All that is required to confer on this Tribunal jurisdiction to consider the Claimant’s treaty
claims is for one of the Claimant’s claims to arise under the BIT. The Tribunal finds that the
Claimant’s claims for direct and indirect expropriation, for denial of fair and equitable treatment,
for unreasonable and discriminatory measures, and for denial of full protection and security all
concern “obligation[s] of [the Respondent] under [the BIT] in relation to an investment of the
[Claimant].”354 The Tribunal also finds that the Claimant has asserted an umbrella clause claim

that is pleaded as a breach of the obligation imposed on the Respondent by the BIT to “observe

any obligation it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of
the other Contracting Party.”35° These claims are sufficient to invoke the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal. The Respondent’s additional objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction are overruled, and

the Tribunal now turns to the merits of the claims asserted.

VII. OVERVIEW OF THE CLAIMS AND DEFENSES OF THE PARTIES

A. The Claimant’s Claims
248. The Claimant submits that the law to be applied to the dispute is the BIT, as supplemented
by international law. The basis of this argument is Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which
directs the Tribunal to look first at any rules of law agreed by the parties in order to determine the
governing law in an ICSID arbitration. That agreed choice of law, according to the Claimant, is

the BIT.+5¢

249. The Claimant asserts that Turkmenistan violated its obligations under the BIT in five
respects. First, it claims that Turkmenistan unlawfully expropriated the Claimant’s investment.
Second, it claims that the Respondent failed to treat the Claimant’s investment fairly and equitably.
Third, it claims that Turkmenistan violated its duty to observe the obligations into which it entered
with regard to the Claimant’s investment. Fourth, it claims that Turkmenistan’s unreasonable,
unjustified, and arbitrary measures impaired the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, and
disposal of the Claimant’s investment. And fifth, it claims that the Respondent violated its

obligation to provide full protection and security to the Claimant’s investment.

250. The Claimant seeks compensation for losses it claims to have suffered as a result of

Turkmenistan’s violations of its obligations to the Claimant under the BIT in relation to the

355 BIT Art. 2(2).

93

Claimant’s investments in Turkmenistan.3>7 Specifically, it seeks lost profits, compound interest,
costs, and a declaration from the Tribunal that no refund of the Advance Payment is due to
Turkmenistan.

1. The unlawful expropriation claims
251. The Claimant’s expropriation claim relies on Article 5(1) of the BIT, which reads as
follows: 358

Investments of nationals or companies of either Contracting Party shall not be nationalised,
expropriated or subjected to measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other
Contracting Party except for a public purpose related to the internal needs of that Party on
a non-discriminatory basis and against prompt, adequate and effective compensation. Such
compensation shall amount to the genuine value of the investment expropriated

before th ation orbefore the i ation became public
knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall include interest ata normal commercial rate until
the date of payment, shall be made without delay, be effectively realisable and be freely
transferable.

252. The Claimant relies on Article 5 with respect to both its claim of direct expropriation and
its claim of indirect expropriation. Indirect expropriation, Claimant says, is described by the
provision of Article 5 dealing with “measures having effect equivalent to nationalization or
expropriation.”359 The alleged expropriation (direct and indirect) was unlawful, according to the
Claimant, because Article 5 prohibits any measure of expropriation that is: (a) not for a public
purpose related to the internal needs of Turkmenistan, (b) not non-discriminatory, and (c) not
paid for by prompt, adequate, and effective compensation representing the genuine value of the
expropriated investment.°° The Claimant asserts that the Respondent’s expropriation was not for
a public purpose, and was not compensated. It further asserts that the expropriation was contrary
to a specific commitment in the form of the Presidential Decree and the Contract. °°!

a. The direct expropriation claim
253. The Claimant claims that Turkmenistan directly expropriated its investment when it
“seized” the Claimant’s factory and terminated the Contract in February 2010. It refers to Yves
Fortier’s definition of direct expropriation as “the compulsory transfer of title to property to the

State or a third party, or the outright seizure of property by the State.”3*

254. Claimant claims direct expropriation of its contractual rights, which it argues that

international law and investment treaty tribunals have consistently recognized may be

expropriated. It relies for this point on the awards in Vivendi v Argentina, *° Starrett Housing,*°+

Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Iran,°° Wena v. Egypt,7° and Eureko v. Poland.*6”

255. The Claimant bases its claim of direct expropriation principally on three events attributed
to the Respondent:

a. The “seizure” of the Claimant’s factory, sale of its equipment,*°8 and the expulsion
of its employees from the factory site on February 4, 2010, by a committee
comprising representatives of Turkmen Highways, the Ministry of Construction,
the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Turkmen Intelligence Agency, a

prosecutor/district attorney and other government personnel.36?

b. The termination of the Contract by a letter from TAY dated February 22, 2010,
thereby causing the alienation of the Claimant’s contractual rights.*7°

c. The wrongful judgments of the Turkmen courts obtained by the public prosecutor

in March and May 2010 at the request of TAY.37!

b. The indirect expropriation claim
256. The Claimant claims that Turkmenistan indirectly expropriated the Claimant’s investment
by “creeping” expropriation. Such indirect expropriation is, according to the Claimant, widely
understood as interference with an investment that “substantially deprives the investor of the use
or enjoyment of its investment, even if the legal and beneficial title of the asset remains with the

investor.”>77

The test, according to the Claimant, is the effect of the measures on the investor’s
property — whether the effect of the State’s measure is to deprive the investor “in whole or in

significant part, of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of property.”373

257. Specifically, the Claimant claims that indirect expropriation occurred when Turkmenistan
deprived the Claimant of the use, enjoyment, and economic benefits of its investment without
paying fair compensation.*”* This creeping expropriation is described as a “series of acts and
omissions starting in the spring of 2008 which made it increasingly difficult for Garanti Koza to

continue work on the Project, ultimately depriving Garanti Koza of its entire investment.”375

258. In this regard, the Claimant makes specific reference to the following acts. Even if each of
these acts might not individually be an act of expropriation, taken together, the Claimant argues,
they result in a creeping expropriation.>7°

a. The Respondent’s repudiation of the Project’s lump sum pricing and the imposition

of itemized cost pricing;

b. The Respondent’s failure to pay sums due to Garanti Koza;

c. The Respondent’s wrongful imposition of a delay penalty;*’’ and

d. Turkmenistan’s failure to notify the Claimant of the measures taken.

ce The indirect MFN/due process expropriation claim

259. The Claimant also seeks to use Article 3 of the BIT, the MFN clause,*”* to import into the
BIT elements of the expropriation provisions of two other treaties: Article 5 of the France —

Turkmenistan BIT and Article 6 of the United Arab Emirates —Turkmenistan BIT.379

260. The Claimant argues that Article 5 of the BIT, read together, through the MFN clause, with
Article 5 of the France -Turkmenistan BIT and Article 6 of the UAE -Turkmenistan BIT, imposes
additional conditions to lawful expropriation: (1) that the expropriation not be contrary to a

specific commitment, and (2) that it be in accordance with due process of law.

261. The Claimant submits that Turkmenistan, by imposing a delay penalty in excess of USD 2

million without involving Garanti Koza in the process, breached both of these conditions.

262. The Claimant accepts that, if the Tribunal finds that the Respondent breached Article 5 of
the BIT, the Tribunal need not examine or determine the Claimant’s alternative MMFN-based
grounds, 380

2. The FET claim
263. The Claimant asserts that Turkmenistan failed to treat the Claimant’s investment fairly and
equitably in accordance with Article 2(2) of the BIT, which requires that “Investments of nationals
or companies of each Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable

treatment.”38!

264. The BIT does not define “fair and equitable” treatment (“FET”), so the Claimant invites
the Tribunal to determine “whether in all the circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and
equitable or unfair and inequitable.”38? The Claimant notes that the Vienna Convention requires
that the FET provision of Article 2(2) of the BIT be interpreted in good faith, in accordance with
ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their context, and in light of the object and purpose of

the treaty.383

265. The object and purpose of the BIT, in the Claimant’s submission, may be inferred from the
preamble. The preamble of the BIT refers to the parties’ intent “to create favourable conditions

267.

The Claimant asserts that Turkmenistan violated the FET standard by:

a.

Frustrating Garanti Koza’s legitimate expectations by changing the price it would
receive for the project and thus the return on its investment, which was the most
critical element underlying its decision to invest. This was a result of the change
from a lump sum price of USD 100 million set out in the Contract and the
Presidential Decree, to be paid in percentage instalments as work was completed,
to a different pricing and invoicing mechanism using a Smeta-based system
requiring costs to be itemized. The Claimant’s legitimate expectations were further
frustrated by Turkmenistan’s failure to make monthly progress payments. Such
actions constituted inconsistent conduct by Turkmenistan and resulted in a lack of
stability of the legal framework for the investment.

Actively doing harm to the investment and failing to cooperate. The fines for delay
and termination of the Contract were disproportionate to any delay, and in any event
an extension of the completion date was mandated under the Contract and ordered
by the Turkmen President.

Turkmenistan coerced Garanti Koza into applying a pricing and invoicing regime
different from the lump sum pricing set out in the Presidential Decree and the
Contract and pressured Garanti Koza to continue work while not making payments

which were owed.

. Turkmenistan harassed Garanti Koza by: (i) imposing a delay penalty and

terminating the Contract in May 2009 and February 2010; (ii) applying to the Chief
Prosecutor to start proceedings against Garanti Koza in February 2010; (iii) seizing

Garanti Koza’s factory in February 2010; (iv) acts by the Chief Prosecutor

100

endorsing Turkmen Highways’ February 22, 2010 application and filing suit with
the Turkmen courts within a day of that application; and (v) the imposition of a fine

in February 2010 by the tax administration.3%

268. The Claimant asserts that its investment was not treated with transparency. Garanti Koza
did not receive any information about or notice of (a) the seizure of the factory other than the
February 4, 2010 minutes, (b) the status and outcome of the proceedings by the tax administration
or the Chief Prosecutor’s action before the Turkmen courts, (c) the sale of part of its equipment by
Turkmenistan, (d) Smeta being mandatory under Turkmen law, during the parties’ negotiations
leading to the Contract, and (e) the court proceedings in Turkmenistan brought by employees and

subcontractors against Garanti Koza.3%4

269. The Claimant asserts that Turkmenistan’s pricing policy in construction contracts was
arbitrary, in that it was “without concern for what is fair or right.”39° The Claimant further asserts
that Turkmenistan did not act in good faith for all of the reasons above,39® and because of the

manner in which it terminated the Contract.397

270. Finally, the Claimant argues that, even if each of the acts described in this section may not
individually have resulted in a breach of the fair and equitable treatment provision in the BIT, all

of these acts taken together do result in such a breach.*°°

3. The umbrella clause
271. The Claimant claims that Turkmenistan breached the so called “umbrella clause” found at
Article 2(2) of the BIT, which provides that: “Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation
it may have entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party.” The Claimant says that Turkmenistan’s obligations include obligations under
the Contract between Claimant and TAY.39° In support of its contention that TAY entered into
the Contract on behalf of Turkmenistan, the Claimant makes reference to, among other things, the
statement in Article 1.2(a) of the Contract that the Contract is entered into by TAY on behalf of

the Government of Turkmenistan.4°°

272. The effect of the umbrella clause, according to the Claimant, is to elevate breaches of
contracts with the government into treaty breaches.4°! Failures to carry out the obligations
undertaken in the Presidential Decree also constitute breaches of the Umbrella Clause,4°?
according to the Claimant, irrespective of whether the Decree was a unilateral undertaking.*°> The

Decree made specific commitments directed at a specific investor.

273. The Claimant claims Turkmenistan breached the Umbrella Clause in six ways:
a. First, Turkmenistan failed to pay the Claimant the price of construction works under the
Presidential Decree and the Contract in the specified timeframe and manner,*% by:
i. Imposing Smeta in breach of (a) Paragraph 2 of the Presidential Decree; (b) Article
4 of the Contract; (c) Article 10 of the Contract Conditions; and (d) Schedule B-2

(Terms of Payment) of the Contract.

ii. Failing on or after January 29, 2009, to make monthly payments, in breach of (a)
Article 10 of the Contract; and (b) Schedule B-2 of the Contract.

b. Second, the delay penalty violated Article 7(4) of the Contract, which requires
Turkmenistan to extend the completion date in case it “fails to make payments and fulfil its
financial responsibilities... or allows delays in providing land, maps and diagrams.™®°
The delay penalty was also contrary to the agreed extension of completion until November
1, 2009.

c. Third, termination of the Contract by Turkmenistan was contrary to Article 17.1 of the
Contract, because (i) having repudiated the core provisions on price, the Respondent cannot
be allowed to invoke Article 17.1; and (ii) contrary to Article 17.1, Turkmenistan has not
paid Garanti Koza “for the amount of completed works including executed work, imported
material and equipment and concluded purchases, demobilization of Contractor and
repatriation of employees.” 49°

d. Fourth, Turkmenistan violated Article 3.7 of the Contract by not handing over the sites
promptly. Article 3.7 requires Turkmenistan to “acquire and provide legal and physical
handing over of the Site to the Contractor.’”407

e. Fifth, the Claimant claims that Turkmenistan violated paragraph 6 of the Presidential
Decree, which required various ministries to “ensure the removal of various bridges.” It
also violated Schedule A-3 (14) of the Contract, in which TAY undertook the obligation to
arrange with various ministries and departments to demolish existing bridges and clear the

sites of debris.48

f. Sixth, Article 3.7 of the Contract states that the “Owner shall provide all necessary
technical information and data for designing and construction of bridges from local
authorities of Turkmenistan.” Schedule A-3(2) of the Contract required that final
topographical plans about the sites be provided. The Claimant claims breach of these
provisions. 40°

4, Unreasonable and discriminatory measures and MEN clause
274. Article 2(2) of the BIT provides that “Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair
by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or

disposal of investments in its territory of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party.”

275. The Claimant claims that Turkmenistan breached Article 2(2) and Article 3 (MFN Clause)
of the BIT by: (a) imposing Smeta*! and the delay penalty, (b) terminating the Contract,*!! (c)
actions by the tax authorities, and (d) seizure of Garanti Koza’s factory and equipment.+!? These

actions, the Claimant says, were unreasonable, unjustified and arbitrary.

276. Further, the Claimant claims that Turkmenistan’s acts and omissions separately and
cumulatively violated Article 2(3) of the United Arab Emirates-Turkmenistan BIT and Article 4
(1) of the Switzerland—Turkmenistan BIT (both imported by the MFN Clause), both of which
provisions obligate the Respondent not to impair by unreasonable or arbitrary measure the

management maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments.*!?

5. Full protection and security

277. The Claimant also claims that Article 2(2) of the BIT imposes on Turkmenistan an
obligation to provide full protection and security, meaning both physical and legal security, to the
investments of UK investors. It claims that, by failing to treat the investment fairly and equitably,
creating an unstable legal environment, subjecting the investment to “harassment,” and permitting
the expropriation of the investment, it failed in that obligation.4!4 The Claimant does not accept
that such protection is limited to protection from actions by third parties, as argued by
Turkmenistan.

B. The Respondent’s Responses

278. In its Counter-memorial,*!> its Rejoinder,*!® and its Post-Hearing Brief, +!7 the Respondent
asks the Tribunal: (a) to the extent that the Tribunal proceeds to examine the merits of the case, to
dismiss the Claimant’s claims in their entirety; and (b) to the extent that the Tribunal proceeds to
examine the issue of quantum, to find that no compensation is due to the Claimant. The
Respondent also asks the Tribunal to order the Claimant to pay the totality of the costs relating to

this Arbitration.

279. The Respondent argues that any investment arbitration tribunal is charged with more than
figuring out whether the rights of an investor have been violated. The Respondent submits that
such tribunals are also charged with protecting the rights of states that sign BITs, particularly from

the kind of abuse that Turkmenistan has, in its view, suffered in recent years at the hands of Turkish

claimants. The Respondent asks that the Tribunal make a finding that Turkmenistan has not
violated the BIT, even if it finds that it has no jurisdiction over the dispute.+!*

1. Issues of State responsibility and attribution
280. The Respondent asserts that Turkmenistan is not a party to the Contract upon which all of
the Claimant’s claims are based. It denies the Claimant’s statements suggesting that Turkmenistan

had obligations under the Contract.

281. The Respondent also points to a lack of consistency in the presentation of the Claimant’s
claims which shows that the Claimant itself is not clear about whether the actions in dispute are
attributable to Turkmenistan. In some instances ‘Turkmenistan’ and ‘Turkmen Highways’ are used
interchangeably in the Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits. For example:
e The statement “Turkmenistan’s Failure to Hand over Sites” is followed by “Under the
Contract Turkmen Highways was required to hand over the sites” and “Turkmen

Highways failed to comply with its obligation.”

“Turkmenistan’s Failure to Demolish Existing Bridges” is followed by “fundamental
obligation of Turkmen Highways under the Presidential Decree and the Contract was to
remove the existing bridges and clear debris.”

e The Claimant argues that, “given Turkmenistan’s misconduct towards Garanti Koza and
its growing hostility towards Turkish investors more broadly, Garanti Koza had every
expectation that if it issued a letter of guarantee again, Turkmen Highways would

immediately call on the guarantee.”4!9

418 Closing Tr. December 14, 2015 pp. 1597-1598.
419 Mem. { 279.

106

The Respondent thus argues that, while the Claimant refrains from alleging that the Respondent
is a party to the Contract, the Claimant’s case in fact rests on the assumption that the Respondent
is somehow answerable for the contractual obligations of Garanti Koza’s contracting partner,

TAY.

282. The Respondent considers that international law differentiates between a State’s
responsibility for violations of contractual undertakings given to foreign nationals by the State
itself and a State’s responsibility for interference with contractual undertakings to which it is not
a party. The Respondent argues that this distinction is widely recognized in the literature on
international responsibility relating to contracts, which generally concludes that, if a foreign
investor’s contract is not with the central government of the State, the conduct complained of must
meet the traditional tests for internationally wrongful acts in order to incur international

responsibility.42°

283. The Respondent contends that the Contract in dispute is not with the central government
of Turkmenistan. Rather, it is with a State-owned entity acting in its commercial capacity and
within Turkmenistan’s internal legal order, rather than within the international legal order.4?!
Accordingly, the Respondent argues, a breach of the Contract concluded by Turkmen Highways

cannot per se give rise to the responsibility of the Turkmen State under international law.*??

284. The Respondent argues that, if the true nature of Garanti Koza’s claims is that its

contractual partner failed to honor its obligations under the Contract, then no question of the State’s

international responsibility arises and the proper forum for obtaining redress is the Arbitrazh Court
of Turkmenistan. If, however, Garanti Koza’s complaint is that Turkmenistan, or some organ or
agency or the Turkmen government, unjustly or improperly annulled, modified, or otherwise
interfered with the Contract, then, the Respondent argues, alleging breach of contract is neither a
sufficient nor proper basis for complaint. Rather, the question is whether the State’s conduct
violates its obligations under the BIT in such a way as to give rise to the State’s international

responsibility.47>

285. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant has failed to establish that the acts and omissions
of which it complains were taken in the exercise of sovereign power, referring to the International
Law Commission’s Articles on State Responsibility (‘ILC Draft Articles on State
Responsibility”), specifically Article 8.424 The Respondent argues that the Claimant has not shown
direct intervention by the Turkmen State or even any substantial “advice” to TAY with regard to
TAY’s decisions to make contractual payments, apply penalties, or terminate the Contract. The
Respondent argues that accepting the Claimant’s version of events would require the Tribunal to
believe that every late payment, every delay penalty, every action by the regulatory authorities was
choreographed to torment the Claimant, notwithstanding that the State’s only interest was in the
timely completion of the bridge project, and further to believe that the Claimant’s failure to
complete the works resulted, not from its own failings, but from acts and omissions attributable to

the Respondent State as a Sovereign.*?>

286. In order to attribute responsibility to Turkmenistan, the Respondent argues that Garanti
Koza must establish that the conduct of TAY was unjustified under the terms of the Contract and

424 C-Mem. { 290; Rej. 301.

applicable law, that such conduct was attributable to the Respondent State, and that the State’s
conduct violated its obligations under the BIT or constituted internationally wrongful acts under
international law. The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden to
make such a showing.*?6
2. Issues of applicable law

287. The Respondent contends that the proper approach to identifying the applicable rules of
law, pursuant to Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention rests upon the principle that different issues
can arise in the context of a single investment dispute and that a tribunal has the power to apply
different rules of law to those different issues depending upon their proper characterization 47
According to the Respondent, this interpretation is confirmed by both scholarly commentary*?®

and arbitral precedent.4?9

288. In the Respondent’s view, if an issue in dispute relates to the existence or scope of a
contractual obligation, or a party’s performance under a contract, that issue has to be determined

by the law governing the contract. In the present dispute, the Contract contains an express choice

of law clause, providing that “This Contract obeys the acting legislation of Turkmenistan.”4°

Therefore, the Respondent considers that the Law of Turkmenistan should be applied to determine

the nature and scope of parties’ rights, obligations, and performance under the Contract.43! Since
the Claimant asserts a variety of alleged violations of its rights under the Contract, for the Tribunal
to assess whether there is a breach of the BIT, it must first establish, with reference to and in
accordance with Turkmen law, whether the rights claimed by the Claimant existed under the
Contract, and if so, their scope and content.432. In particular, the Respondent argues, the Tribunal
must answer the following questions under Turkmen law:433

e Was the Claimant actually entitled to a particular payment?

e Had the Claimant fulfilled its corresponding contractual obligations?

e Was the imposition of a delay penalty appropriate in the circumstances?

e Were there valid grounds for contract termination and were the procedures for termination

properly carried out?
3. Issues of liability

289. The Respondent argues that, even if the Tribunal determines that it has jurisdiction (which
the Respondent denies) and even if the Tribunal decides to consider that TAY’s acts are
attributable to Turkmenistan (which the Respondent also denies), the Tribunal should nevertheless

find that all of the Claimant’s claims are meritless.43+

290. According to the Respondent, it is universally understood that the party who has the burden
of proof is the party alleging the affirmative of an issue, consistent with the established principle:
actori incumbit probatio. Thus, the party who submits a claim has the burden of proving the facts

it alleges in support of its claim. The ultimate burden of proof never shifts from one party to the

431 Rsp. PHB {{ 35.

34 C-Mem. {[ 311-312.

110

other, the Respondent argues, but rests throughout the case with the party asserting claims and can
only be discharged once the Tribunal has found that such party has proved its claims.475 In other
words, the Claimant has to prove the factual basis of each of its claims and the Tribunal should
decide, in consideration of the evidence presented by both Parties, whether the Claimant has
discharged its burden of proof.43° The Respondent submits that the evidence clearly shows that
the Claimant has failed to meet its burden in this case.
a. The umbrella clause

291. The Respondent asserts that the Claimant cannot circumvent its own contractual
obligations via the umbrella clause; that the Claimant has not identified any commitment owed to
it within the meaning of the umbrella clause and therefore Claimant’s claims do not fall within the
meaning of the umbrella clause; and that in any case neither Turkmenistan nor TAY breached any

obligation owed to Garanti Koza.

292. First, the Respondent argues that Garanti Koza’s umbrella clause argument fails on its
premise, because an umbrella clause such as the one in the UK-Turkmenistan BIT does not
internationalize simple contract claims and does not elevate such claims to treaty status. The
Respondent asserts that an umbrella clause cannot transform ordinary contract claims into treaty
claims. For example, in the EDF case relied upon by the Claimant, the Respondent states that the

tribunal did not find that an umbrella clause elevates all contract claims into treaty claims; rather,

435 Rej. [ 314. The Respondent explains that, by contrast, the burden of producing evidence, a separate and

distinct concept, refers to the obligation of each party to produce evidence in support of its arguments as a case
progresses. The burden of producing evidence may shift back and forth between the parties according to the nature
and strength of the evidence produced by each party in support of the arguments it submits. However, the fact that the
burden of producing evidence may shift does not affect the fact that the burden of proof remains on the party asserting
the claims.

436 Rej. 317.

111

the tribunal found that only a serious repudiation of a concession agreement could give rise to a

treaty violation.437

293. The Respondent argues that a State is not necessarily liable under an umbrella clause for
breaches of a contract between an investor and a state entity even if the alleged breaches are of
such magnitude as to fall under the umbrella clause. Each of the claims must, in the Respondent’s
submission, pass by the Contract if it is to succeed, and Garanti Koza has made no showing that
TAY, much less Turkmenistan, violated the Contract, much less that it did so to such “magnitude”
as to give rise to a Treaty claim. Rather, the Respondent urges, TAY’s actions vis-a-vis the
Contract were those that any party to a contract would have taken in the face of material breaches
and non-performance of a contractual counter-party. Without a determination that the Contract
was wrongfully terminated, Garanti Koza cannot make out a prima facie showing of a Treaty

claim.38

294. The Respondent contends further that, even if the Tribunal were to find that the umbrella
clause internationalizes the Contract, it must then find that the parties have a mutual obligation to
observe their obligations under the Contract. In other words, the Tribunal cannot allow Garanti
Koza to use the umbrella clause to attempt to enforce part of the Contract while ignoring those

parts that it holds in disfavor, namely the dispute resolution provisions of the Contract.

295. Second, the Respondent argues that, in order for an obligation to come within the umbrella
clause, the host State must have entered into some commitment with specific reference to an
investment, and that commitment must create some entitlement on the part of the investor to some

specific performance by the State. The consensual element is vital, and derives from the language

47° CMem. 317.
48 CMem. {ff 318-319.

112

“entered into,” which is present in many umbrella clauses, including Article 2(2) of the BIT. The
Respondent quotes the ad hoc Annulment Committee in the CMS v. Argentina case: “In speaking
of ‘any obligations it may have entered into with regard to investments’, it seems clear that [the
umbrella clause] is concerned with consensual obligations arising independently from the BIT
itself. ... Further, they must be specific obligations concerning the investment. They do not cover
general requirements imposed by the law of the host State.”43? The Respondent argues that
unilateral legislative or executive acts lack this consensual characteristic, and therefore do not

create the type of obligation that is encompassed by an umbrella clause.44°

296. The Claimant’s argument that Presidential Decree No. 9429 specifically represents such a
commitment demonstrates, in the Respondent’s view, a fundamental misunderstanding of the
nature of that decree. Presidential Decree No. 9429 did not create a specific obligation towards the
Claimant, the Respondent argues, but rather permitted TAY to enter into a contract with the
Claimant, and set out the main provisions of the contract, including the total contract price and
completion date of the project. It did not modify, much less set those terms.4+! Orders and decrees
issued by the President are not intended to amend or revoke the Constitution and laws of
Turkmenistan, the Respondent asserts, but rather are a method of implementing those laws.
Furthermore, The Law on Normative Legal Acts explicitly provides that decrees of a distinctive
and organizational nature issued by the President for purposes of resolving specific ongoing

matters, such as Presidential Decree No. 9429, do not constitute normative legal acts.44?

442 GMem. { 327.

297. Further, the Respondent explains that the Presidential Decree did not, as the Claimant
contends, predetermine the contract price, but rather allocated a maximum budget from public
funds, in the amount equal to the total value of the Contract as agreed by the parties to the Contract.
Indeed the tender documents provided to Garanti Koza specifically state that no agreement is

reached until the Contract is signed.

298. The Respondent argues, citing Mr. Sarybayev’s testimony, that the Claimant
misunderstands the Presidential Decree’s connection to the contract price. Mr. Buyuksandalyaci,
in paragraph 20 of his Witness Statement, reverses (according to the Respondent) the
chronological sequence of the negotiation of the principal contract terms and the issuance of a
Presidential Decree. Contrary to Mr. Buyuksandalyaci’s statement, Mr. Sarybayev testified that “a
Presidential Decree follows the process of the negotiation of the principal terms of a contract
between acontractor and a governmental entity, such as the contract price and the completion date,
rather than precede it.”443_ The Respondent concludes that the Decree does not create any specific
obligations owed by Turkmenistan to Garanti Koza, and therefore that Garanti Koza cannot base

an umbrella clause claim on the Decree.

299. Third, the Respondent considers that the Claimant cannot use the Umbrella Clause to
circumvent its contractual obligations. The Respondent argues that the legal effect of this clause
is not, as Garanti Koza wishes the Tribunal to believe, on the one hand to elevate all claims under
the Contract to Treaty claims, and on the other hand to provide a means for it to escape its
obligations under the Contract and specifically its obligation to adhere to the forum selection
clause.444 Commenting on the SGS v. Philippines case,*45 the Respondent emphasizes that,

although the tribunal in that case did find that the umbrella clause could have the effect of bringing
some contract claims under the treaty, it also found that the purpose of the umbrella clause is to
“help secure the rule of law in relation to investment protection,” and held that, even if SGS’
contract claims could be stated as treaty claims via the umbrella clause, they could not be
considered by a treaty tribunal, because doing so would violate the binding forum-selection clause

in the contract.44¢

300. The Respondent argues that, although the Claimant claims that Turkmenistan breached a
number of obligations to the Claimant, all of these claims arise from the Contract, to which
Turkmenistan is not a party. TAY is the counter-party to the Contract. The Respondent accordingly
analyzes whether TAY breached any obligation it owed to Garanti Koza, and concludes that TAY

did not.

301. The Respondent asserts that Garanti Koza was paid in full for the work it actually
performed. Progress Payment Certificates 1-3 were paid, and subsequent invoices were not paid
because Garanti Koza failed to renew the bank guarantee. The Respondent takes issue with Garanti
Koza’s complaint that the first three payments were delayed because TAY was unable to make
payments without Garanti Koza’s smeta documentation being in place. This was not, the
Respondent argues, a breach on the part of TAY, but rather a result of Garanti Koza’s failure to
have its Smeta documentation in place before submitting its Progress Payment Certificates, and
thus a failure by Garanti Koza to meet its own obligations under the Contract and the laws of

Turkmenistan. 447

302. The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s contention that the requirement that Garanti
Koza prepare and submit Smeta documentation somehow changed the terms of the Contract is
wrong.*48 First, the Respondent argues that Mr. Nepesov and Mr. Sarybayev explained that the
submission of Smeta documentation was required by the Contract and by the law for all projects
financed from the State budget; it was not a requirement imposed after the execution of the
Contract.449 Second, Smeta is an accounting mechanism put in place to ensure that the price paid
for materials and other inputs used in public contracts bears some relationship to reality. The
Respondent considers that “an honest contractor, who performs the work it contracted to do, should

have no problem earning the total value of a contract.”45°

303. The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s complaint that TAY (and by extension
Turkmenistan) breached an obligation by enforcing the delay penalty provision of the Contract.
The Respondent’s view is that the Claimant was woefully delinquent in completing its obligations
under the Contract, and that TAY exercised its right to impose a delay penalty under the exact
circumstances that the delay penalty clause in the Contract was intended to cover. The Respondent
argues that it was the Claimant that breached its Contract obligations, and that the Claimant’s claim
of a breach by TAY represents “a failed effort to shift the focus away from its own failure to meet

its own contractual obligations” and “its own inability and apparent unwillingness to perform.”4>!

304. The Respondent denies that TAY’s termination of the Contract was wrongful. Rather, the
Respondent says, TAY had every right to terminate the Contract, and it exercised that right after

careful consideration and after providing Garanti Koza ample time and opportunity to perform.

Mr. Sarybayev testified that “at some point, [TAY] realized that Garanti Koza’s performance was
so inadequate that, left on its own, it was not going to be able to complete its project for years after
the October 2008 deadline.”45? Under such circumstances, the Respondent argues, TAY’s exercise
of its contractual right to terminate cannot be seen as a breach of an obligation owed by TAY to
Garanti Koza; rather it was the predictable result of Garanti Koza’s breach of the obligations it
owed to TAY, its dismal performance, and its abandonment of the project.+53
b. The claims of expropriation

305. The Respondent contends that the exact nature of the Claimant’s expropriation claim is
unclear, but that it appears to arise (a) from measures taken by TAY to encourage the Claimant to
perform its obligations under the Contract, (b) from the termination of the Contract, and (c) from
the attachment of equipment that followed the Claimant’s failure to meet its contractual

obligations. 454

306. The Respondent further argues that, although the Claimant asserts that know-how was
expropriated from it, the Claimant never defines what know-how was taken, nor does it explain
how any such taking could have occurred when there were no trade secrets and no know-how was

transferred to TAY, much less taken by Turkmenistan.455

307. The Respondent also argues that the Claimant has not made it clear upon which Treaty
provision the Claimant bases its claim of expropriation. To the extent that the Claimant relies on
the Treaty’s MFN clause, the Respondent describes the Claimant’s expropriation claims as “a

Frankenstein-like concoction created from expropriation clauses in at least three different

117

treaties.”45° While the Respondent concedes that an MEN clause may allow a claimant to import
an obligation from one treaty to another, it argues that the claimant must pick one standard from
one treaty and cannot, as Garanti Koza attempts to do, meld its favorite bits and pieces from various

treaties into one, in effect creating an obligation which the State never consented to in any treaty.

308. Such an effort to use Article 3 of the BIT to piece together an entirely new obligation from
multiple treaties is, the Respondent argues, improper. First, the Respondent asserts, while the
Claimant has the burden of identifying treatment that is more favorable, its Memorial contains
quotations from multiple treaties between Turkmenistan and other states without ever identifying
which of those treaties it considers to be more favorable or why they should be considered more
favorable.4°7_ The Respondent suggests that the Claimant is attempting to create a “sui generis
mechanism” of treaty rights for itself, which does not “correspond to any real situation under any

treaty,” and that Article 3 of the BIT cannot be read to permit such an “absurd result.’”45*

309. The Respondent contends that a claim of expropriation requires that the claimant prove
that a state actor has engaged in behavior that is not available to an ordinary private party to a
contract. The Respondent quotes the award in Vanessa Ventures, which stated that “it is necessary
that the conduct of the State should go beyond that which an ordinary contracting party could
adopt” for there to be an expropriation. In the words of the Respondent, “The breach of a contract,

much less the exercise of legitimate termination rights under a contract by a state actor, does not

amount to expropriation as a matter of international law. A state cannot be deemed to have

expropriated an investor’s property simply by exercising its own rights under an agreement.”4>?

310. Turning to the Claimant’s specific claims of expropriation, the Respondent takes issue,
first, with the Claimant’s contention that it should have been exempt from complying with the
Smeta requirements which are applicable to every other contractor in Turkmenistan, because doing
so deprived it of the value of its rights under the Contract. The Respondent insists that Smeta is a
reporting procedure that does not affect the value of the Contract, not, as the Claimant would have
it, amechanism by which TAY attempted to cheat the Claimant out of progress payments. Smeta,
the Respondent says, is nothing more than documentation required by all contractors that must be
submitted prior to their submission of invoices in order to receive progress payments.4°° As
indicated by Mr. Sarybayev, “I have not heard of any project that did not require submission of
Smeta, as it is used as a reporting mechanism for all construction projects financed from public
funds.”46! The Respondent argues that Garanti Koza is no different from any other contractor and
had a legal and contractual obligation to submit a detailed project Smeta in order to receive
payment.

311. The Respondent claims that, had Garanti Koza performed its obligations in a timely way
and had it prepared its Smeta before submitting its Project Payment Certificate No. 1, it would
have received payment within 45 days, as provided in the Contract. When the Claimant did prepare
its Smeta, its Progress Payment Certificates were paid in atimely manner. The Respondent argues

that Garanti Koza received payment for Progress Payment Certificate No. 1 in December 2008,

459 CMem. { 377.
460 CMem. { 384.

461 Sarybayev WS-1, 28.

119

not because of any state action, but because of Garanti Koza’s delay in complying with its
obligations. This demonstrates, the Respondent says, that no finding of expropriation can be based

on TAY’s refusal to make progress payments until the Smeta was in place.

312. Second, the Respondent asserts that TAY’s imposition of a delay penalty was proper.
‘When Garanti Koza’s performance fell woefully behind, the Respondent says, TAY had no choice
but to exercise its contractual right to impose delay penalties. Since the Contract provided a clear
right to do so, the Respondent argues, the imposition of the delay penalties cannot amount to an
expropriation.46? Moreover, the Respondent disputes that the imposition of the delay penalty can

be considered an act of the State.46

313. Third, the Respondent disputes that Turkmenistan expropriated the Claimant’s rights under
the Contract when TAY exercised its termination rights. Article 17 of the Contract, which was
negotiated and signed by Garanti Koza, provides the Owner (TAY) with a unilateral right of
termination. When Garanti Koza abandoned the project and refused to complete the project despite
the pleas of TAY that it do so, the Respondent argues, TAY had no choice but to exercise its
termination rights. The Respondent asserts that TAY acted as any rational commercial party toa
contract would have done when faced with a counter-party who refuses to perform its contractual

obligations; its action was certainly not state action.

314. The Respondent applies the same reasoning to the Claimant’s contention that the
attachment of the factory and equipment used by Garanti Koza on leased land in Turkmenistan
amounted to an expropriation. The Respondent argues that the factory and equipment were
462 Article 8.1 of the Contract (R-18) provides: “In case if the Contractor does not ensure the completion of the
facility’s construction within the time period stipulated by Article 7 of the present terms of the Contract, the
Contractor pays the Owner a compensatory fee for the established omission (penalty for failure to comply with the

Contract) for each day of delay from the date of project completion.”
493 CMem. { 390.

120

attached by the court on the basis of a petition from TAY, after the Claimant’s refusal to pay the
delay penalty it owed to TAY. In the words of the Respondent, “The attachment did not take place
as a result of some political vendetta or secret conspiracy as Claimant insinuates. Rather, TAY
acting as any debtor is allowed to do under Turkmen law, and as creditors around the world are
allowed to do, petitioned the court to attach the assets it assumed belonged to Garanti Koza in an

effort to satisfy the amounts owed to it.”464

315. The Respondent submits that there are no grounds to find expropriation in this case.
However, if TAY’s actions could be construed as an expropriation attributable to Turkmenistan,
the Respondent submits that the expropriation must also be found to have been lawful, because it
was undertaken for a public purpose against adequate compensation. The Respondent reasons that
the Contract at issue in this case concerned the re-construction of 28 bridges and overpasses on
one of the most major highway arteries in Turkmenistan; Garanti Koza’s failure to fulfill its
obligations disrupted the flow of traffic and led to greatly increased road danger.*®> Thus, the
Respondent says, after Garanti Koza failed to extend the Contract, left Turkmenistan and
abandoned the project, TAY had no choice but to terminate the Contract.
c The claim of denial of fair and equitable treatment

316. The Respondent argues that the current and prevailing view is that the threshold for
violating the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard is ahigh one, and that a State’s conduct
must indeed be grievous to attract the reprobation of international law. The Respondent considers
that the Claimant bases its FET claim on the same set of alleged harms upon which it bases its

other claims: delayed progress payments arising from the Claimant’s failure to submit the proper

464 Mem. { 401.
465 C-Mem. {{f{ 405-406.

121

documentation required for TAY to make those payments, in particular Smeta documentation;
TAY’s imposition of a delay penalty; the attachment of Garanti Koza’s assets in Turkmenistan;
tax proceedings arising from Garanti Koza’s failure to file and pay its taxes; the termination of the
Contract by TAY as a result of Garanti Koza’s nonperformance and finally, Garanti Koza’s
allegation that TAY was an uncooperative partner.4°° The Respondent contends that these claims
can be divided into two categories: (1) those that have no basis in fact; and (2) those for which the
Claimant has misconstrued the facts and misapplied the law in its effort to contend that

Turkmenistan breached its FET obligations.

317. With regard to Garanti Koza’s claim that Turkmenistan’s actions breached legitimate
expectations of Garanti Koza, the Respondent notes, first, that this case arises out of a contract
between Garanti Koza and TAY, so that the Claimant’s legitimate expectations must be limited to
what that contract provided. In the words of the Respondent, “A contractor can have no legitimate
expectation that it will be paid before complying with the terms of payment. Nor can a contractor
have a legitimate expectation that the counter-party to the contract will not exercise its contractual
right to impose a delay penalty when the contractor fails to perform its obligations and to
subsequently exercise its contractual termination rights when the contractor abandons the

project.”467

For the same reasons, the Respondent argues, the conduct of TAY and Turkmenistan
in enforcing, respectively, the Contract and the law, cannot be considered to be disproportionate

or in bad faith. The Respondent also urges that, in evaluating the Claimant’s claim, the Tribunal

should take into account the Claimant’s multiple material breaches of the Contract.4°*

496 CMem. 434.
497 CMem. { 440.
468 Rsp. PHB {{ 129-132.

122

318. Next, the Respondent argues that, even if a duty of transparency is considered part of the
FET obligation (which it denies), such an obligation could be breached only by conduct that is
grossly unfair and that involves acomplete lack of candor. According to the Respondent, the record
of this case is replete with evidence of TAY’s candor: letters from TAY to Garanti Koza entreating
it to perform its obligations under the Contract, outlining the deficiencies of Garanti Koza’s
performance, and informing it of the consequences of non-performance -- the delay penalty and
termination. The Respondent asserts that the parties were in near constant communication until

Mr. Buyuksandalyaci left Turkmenistan and refused to communicate further with TAY.*°?

319. The Respondent concludes that “it is clear that when one considers the context of this case,
a Contract in which the Contractor failed to perform its obligations and abandoned the project
owing significant sums to the project owner and the respective actions of the parties combined
with the fact that there is no action even complained of that was taken with puissance publique,
one must conclude that Turkmenistan did not violate its FET obligation.”
d. The claim of arbitrary and unreasonable treatment

320. The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s claim that it was subjected to arbitrary and
unreasonable treatment again attempts to use the Treaty’s MFN clause to manufacture an
obligation to which Turkmenistan never agreed in any treaty. Indeed, the Respondent says that the
Claimant again fails to cite to any single treaty standard upon which it relies, but instead seems to

apply three separate standards.47°

321. The Respondent points out that Smeta is neither a pricing mechanism nor arbitrary. In its

view, it is all the more difficult to understand this allegation when the contract price was the price

499 Mem. 443.
470 Mem. 447.

123

the Claimant agreed to itself, and the Claimant is not even able to articulate or quantify how the
payments it received were in any way different from what it would have been entitled to under any

other calculation.

322. Likewise, the Respondent asserts that the imposition of the delay penalty and the
termination of the Contract by TAY were rational responses taken by a commercial party to a
contract in the face of nonperformance by the counter-party to that contract, and cannot be
construed as arbitrary or unreasonable state action. The attachment of assets for unpaid debts and
the imposition of tax penalties for unpaid taxes are also rational responses and cannot be

considered arbitrary.

323. Finally, the Respondent stresses that TAY did not arbitrarily deny Garanti Koza an
extension; rather, it recognized that the project was significantly delayed and explored the option
of an extension in hopes of motivating Garanti Koza to actually perform its obligations with the
minimum possible delay. The fact that TAY could not continue to make progress payments in the
absence of a valid bank guarantee, while Garanti Koza kept the balance of the Advance Payment,
is entirely reasonable in the Respondent’s view, given Garanti Koza’s track record of
nonperformance and the legal and contractual requirement that such a bank guarantee be in place.
e. The obligation of full security and protection
324. According to the Respondent, full protection and security is an obligation of conduct rather
than one of result, and requires only that a State exercise due diligence in affording protection to
foreign investments. It does not subject States to strict liability for any loss suffered by a claimant,

and it certainly does not indemnify investors for their own negligence, poor performance,

124

misconduct or bad luck. In the Respondent’s view, the essential question is whether the State

exercised due diligence to the extent “reasonable under the circumstances.”47!

325. The Respondent argues that, to prevail on a claim of denial of full security and protection,
aclaimant must do more than simply allege that it was harmed by an “unstable legal environment,”
and the Claimant has not done so. For the Respondent, it is clear that the Claimant has not met its

burden to show that Turkmenistan breached its FPS obligation.47?

VIII. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS CONCERNING THE MERITS

326. As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal notes that both Parties have advanced general
allegations about the other or others similarly situated. The Claimant has made broad allegations
that Turkmenistan presents an unfavorable, indeed hostile, investment environment for Turkish
investors.47 And the Respondent has made similarly broad allegations about the behavior of
Turkish companies working in Turkmenistan.474 Neither side established the relevance of these
allegations to this dispute or to any claimed breach of the BIT or advanced convincing evidence
to support them. The Tribunal has accordingly given no weight to these allegations in arriving at

its conclusions, and sees no need to address them in this award.

327. All of the substantive claims asserted by the Claimant, and all of the defenses raised by the
Respondent, involve the same sequence of events in Turkmenistan between the beginning of 2008
and the end of 2010. Each act by the Respondent about which the Claimant complains is alleged

to violate multiple provisions of the BIT. Since all of those claims find their way by one route or

125

another to the Contract between Garanti Koza and TAY, the Tribunal will commence its analysis
with the Claimant’s umbrella clause claim.

A. The Claim that the Respondent Failed to Observe Its Obligations
328. Article 2(2) of the BIT requires each Contracting Party to “observe any obligation it may
have entered into with regard to investments of nationals or companies of the other Contracting
Party.” Such treaty provisions are commonly referred to as “umbrella clauses,” because they bring
contractual and other commitments under the protective umbrella of a bi-lateral investment

treaty.47>

329. There has been some debate among tribunals in investment arbitrations, described in
scholarly detail by the tribunal in Eureko v. Poland,*7® about the meaning of umbrella clauses and
the extent to which they may elevate breaches of a contract to which a State (or an organ or
territorial division ofa state) is a party to breaches ofa treaty. As explained by the Eureko tribunal,
applying the direction of VCLT Article 31.1 to interpret atreaty “in good faith in accordance with
the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its

object and purpose:”

 

The plain meaning -- the “ordinary meaning” -- of a provision prescribing that a State “shall
observe any obligations it may have entered into” with regard to certain foreign
investments is not obscure. The phrase, “shall observe” is imperative and categorical.
“Any” obligations is capacious; it means not only obligations of a certain type, but “any”
- that is to say,all - obligations entered into with regard to investments of investors of the
other Contracting Party.477

330. There is nevertheless some tension built into the broad sweep of the umbrella clause in the

BIT. At one extreme, as the Respondent argues, a breach of a purely commercial contract should

a7 CL-48, Eureko v. Poland, 246.

126

not become an international wrong within the reach of an investment treaty simply because one
party to the contract could be considered an organ of the state. A failure by a government agency
to pay for a box of pencils delivered pursuant to an agreement to provide office supplies, for
example, would not come within the reach of Article 2(2), because it would have nothing to do
with an investment. But an act of an organ of a state that results in the breach of a contractual
obligation relating to an investment of a national or company of the other state party to the BIT
does seem to this Tribunal to come within the reach of that article, especially where the immediate
cause of the breach is an action by an organ of the state other than the agency that is the party to
the agreement. This is the situation presented by the facts of this case.
1. The applicable law

331. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that different issues of law can arise from the
same set of facts and that the Tribunal has the power to apply different rules of law to different
issues.478 To the extent that the question presented to the Tribunal is whether a particular
obligation was created by the Contract between Garanti Koza and TAY, the Tribunal applies
Turkmen law (to the best of its ability) to determine the existence and dimensions of the obligation,
because the parties to the Contract agreed that the Contract would be governed by Turkmen law.479
As the tribunal in Emmis International Holding v. Hungary explained:

In order to determine whether an investor/claimant holds property or assets capable of
constituting an investment it is necessary in the first place to refer to host State law. Public
international law does not create property rights. Rather, it accords certain protections to
property rights created according to municipal law.480

478 Mem. { 298.

479 R-18, Contract Conditions, Art. 2.2. In the original, bi-lingual version of the Contract, this article reads (in
English): “This Contract obeys the acting Legislation of Turkmenistan.” In the Respondent’s translation prepared
for this arbitration (also part of R-I8), the same provision reads: “This contract is governed by current legislation of
Turkmenistan.”

127

The Tribunal notes in this connection, however, that neither Party identified any instance in which
the interpretation of any provision of the Contract other than the Contract’s silence with regard to

Smeta turned on any peculiarity of Turkmen law.

332. At the same time, whether a particular action by Turkmenistan or one of its state organs
constituted or caused a failure “to observe any obligation [Turkmenistan] may have entered into
with regard to investments”48! of Garanti Koza is a question of international law that arises under
the BIT. As the ad hoc committee in Vivendi v. Argentina put it, “whether there has been a breach
of the BIT and whether there has been a breach of contract are different questions.”48? Whether
an obligation created by the BIT has been breached falls to be decided by the Tribunal as a matter
of international law.
2. Turkmenistan’s obligations to the Claimant

333. The Contract between Garanti Koza and TAY called for Garanti Koza to build 28 pairs of
highway bridges in Turkmenistan. Garanti Koza succeeded in building one-half of each of what
would have been 21 pairs of those bridges, and had commenced work on two more when its work
came to a halt.483 Performing the work up to that point, as the Tribunal has already determined in
its ruling on jurisdiction,‘8+ required an investment in Turkmenistan on the part of Garanti Koza.

It also involved obligations undertaken by Turkmenistan.

334. The award of the Contract to Garanti Koza was approved by the President of Turkmenistan
in a presidential decree, Decree No. 9429 (the “Decree”), devoted entirely to that subject.485 That

Decree refers to and authorizes nine other organs of the State in addition to TAY to take steps to

481 BIT Art. 2(2).

implement the Contract and the Decree: The Cabinet of Ministers, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance, the Central Bank, the Ministry of Energy and Industry, the Ministry of Water Resources,
the State Commodity and Raw Material Exchange, the Ministry of Construction, and the Customs

Service.48°

335. The connection between the Contract and the Government of Turkmenistan appears on the
face of the Contract. TAY is identified in the Contract as “Owner.’”487 “Owner” is in turn defined
as “State Concern ‘Turkmenavtoyollary’ acting on behalf of Turkmenistan Government.’”4°8 The
Contract also provides that it “is concluded on the basis of Decree of the President of Turkmenistan
No. 9429,” and that it comes into effect after its registration with the Turkmen Ministry of
Economy and Development.‘®° These provisions of the Contract confirm that the acts of TAY in
furtherance of the Contract were attributable to Turkmenistan. Road and bridge construction is in
any event a core function of government. An entity empowered by a State to exercise elements of

governmental authority is for that purpose acting as an organ of the State.49°

336. The Contract spells out a number of obligations undertaken by TAY. Principal among

them is the obligation to pay Garanti Koza for its work, in two ways.

a. First, TAY agreed to provide Garanti Koza an advance payment of 20% of the
“Contract Price” (USD 86,956,521.74, excluding VAT), which equaled USD
17,391,304.35, subject to the provision by Garanti Koza ofa bank guarantee of that

amount, and subject to Garanti Koza’s agreement to reduce each progress payment

129

invoice by 20% until the advance payment was fully earned at the completion of

the work.

Second, TAY agreed to make progress payments against certificates from Garanti
Koza that a specified percentage of the work had been completed.49! Such progress
payments were to be for the percentage of the Contract Price corresponding to the
percentage of the work completed, minus the portion already paid for by the

advance payment.

337. Garanti Koza claims breaches of both of these obligations:

a.

As to the bank guarantee, Garanti Koza claims that TAY (and, according to Garanti
Koza, also Turkmenistan) breached its obligations under the Contract, first by
delaying approval of the guarantee, and then also by refusing to continue to make

progress payments after the guarantee expired.

As to the progress payments, Garanti Koza claims that Turkmenistan’s insistence
that Garanti Koza’s invoices for progress payments conform to Smeta caused TAY
to breach its obligations to pay for the project on a fixed price basis, with each
progress payment based proportionally on the percentage of the work performed. 49?

3. Turkmenistan’s alleged breaches of its obligations

338. The Tribunal disagrees with Garanti Koza as to the first alleged breach, and finds no breach

by Turkmenistan of its obligations under the BIT with regard to TAY’s undertakings with respect

to the advance payment and the bank guarantee. But the Tribunal agrees with Garanti Koza that

Turkmenistan breached its obligations under the BIT with regard to the second item, when multiple

491 C021, 6 and Schedule B-2, I] B.1, C.4.
492 C021, Schedule B-2, {C. 3.

130

agencies of the State insisted that Garanti Koza’s progress payment invoices to TAY must conform
to Smeta.
a. The Advance Payment and the bank guarantee

339. Taking the bank guarantee first, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that Garanti
Koza’s obligation to provide the bank guarantee was the reciprocal of TAY’s obligation to provide
the advance payment.49? TAY undertook to advance 20% of the lump sum amount agreed upon
before it had been earned, providing Garanti Koza with the cash needed to finance the initial stages
of the project. The bank guarantee protected TAY against the risk that Garanti Koza would simply
pocket the advance payment and then not do the work. If the guarantee had been provided
immediately after the signing, the advance would have been paid in April or May rather than in
July, and the work might well have been started that much earlier. If the work had been started

earlier, it might have been completed before the guarantee expired.

340. As it was, as described above, the bank guarantee was not accepted by the Central Bank
until May 26, 2008, and the advance payment was consequently not made until July 7, 2008.494
The bank guarantee expired on February 2, 2009, after which no further progress payments were
made.*95  Garanti Koza was at that point still in possession, by its own calculation, of USD

11,423,586 of the Advance Payment that had not yet been applied to any invoice.49°

341. The delay in paying the Advance Payment was attributable to the delay in providing the

bank guarantee. It was Garanti Koza’s obligation under the Contract to provide a “Bank Guarantee

493 ‘The Contract provided that “The amount of the Advance Payment Guarantee shall be diminished
proportionally and in the amount of 20% for each payment item, in accordance with all and each of the payment
items, listed above, to the CONTRACTOR under the Contract with respect to the progress of Works.” C-021,
Schedule B-2, p. 2.

495 See paragraphs 122-127 above.

496 See paragraphs 135-136, above.

for the return of the advance payment issued by a first class European bank and acceptable by the
Owner’s bank.’4°7 Had the bank guarantee that Garanti Koza initially provided in April 2008 been
accepted, the Advance Payment would not have been delayed. Nothing in the evidence put before
the Tribunal suggests that the Central Bank of Turkmenistan (the “Owner’s Bank’) was

unreasonable in its demands concerning the bank guarantee.

342. Had all gone according to plan, the expiration of the bank guarantee would have caused no
disruption, because the project would have been complete by the time it expired. The work was
not complete at that point, however. Indeed, after receiving Garanti Koza’s letter of December 18,
2008 informing TAY that Garanti Koza had ceased piling work, TAY would have had a reasonable
basis to be concerned that it would be imprudent to continue to make progress payments with no

bank guarantee in place.

343. TAY was directed by the Central Bank to stop paying Garanti Koza’s progress payment
invoices after the expiration of the guarantee on February 2, 2009. The effects of this cessation of
payments could have been remedied if Garanti Koza had made arrangements with Raiffeisen Bank
to extend the bank guarantee for the balance of the advanced payment, or had provided an
acceptable replacement guarantee from another bank covering the amount of the Advance Payment
which remained. The weight of the evidence suggests that the Central Bank would have permitted
TAY to resume payment of Garanti Koza’s invoices, especially the five that were approved but

not paid between January 5 and April 28, 2009, if a bank guarantee had been in place.

344. Garanti Koza does not argue that it would have been impossible for it to renew the bank

guarantee, but rather argues that it was under no contractual obligation to do so and that “it was

497 R-18, Contract Conditions, Art. 10.3(1).

132

reasonable for Garanti Koza to opt not to renew in light of its deteriorating relationship with
Turkmenistan.”498 That argument itself supports the inference that Garanti Koza made a deliberate

decision not to renew or replace the bank guarantee.

345. It is a question of contract law that this Tribunal need not decide whether the suspension
of payments after the expiration of the bank guarantee was or was not a breach by TAY of any of
its obligations to Garanti Koza under the contract. It is sufficient for this Tribunal to find, as it
does, that any loss suffered by Garanti Koza in connection with the insistence by the Central Bank
and TAY that Garanti Koza keep the bank guarantee in place as a condition of continuing to receive
progress payments was avoidable. Garanti Koza made a commercial decision not to extend or
replace the bank guarantee to cover the balance of the Advance Payment that it held. Given the
unexpected circumstance in which both parties found themselves, that decision was the primary
cause of any losses it suffered. Since Garanti Koza’s commercial decision was the primary cause
of its own loss, the Tribunal declines to award compensation for the cessation of payments after

the expiration of the bank guarantee.

b. The insistence on Smeta
346. The Tribunal finds, however, that Turkmenistan failed to observe its obligations to Garanti
Koza with regard to TAY’s obligation to make progress payments to Garanti Koza against invoices
prepared in the manner specified in the Contract. This failure deprived Garanti Koza of the benefit
of its bargain with TAY, and also contributed significantly to the delay of the project. The various
manifestations of this failure to observe the contractual provisions for progress payments all

involved the insistence by multiple organs of the Government of Turkmenistan that progress

498 Reply 113; see C-103, C-104.

133

payment invoices be prepared in accordance with Smeta, rather than in accordance with the express
terms of the Contract. The result was to deprive the Claimant of a substantial portion of the value

of its investment in Turkmenistan.

347. The Tribunal does not base this finding on a conclusion that TAY intentionally breached
its contract with Garanti Koza with respect to the form of the invoices. Indeed, the Tribunal’s
impression is that TAY would have been willing to pay Garanti Koza’s first invoice in the form in
which it was initially presented on April 30, 2008. Rather, it appears to the Tribunal that TAY
was prevented from making payments as provided by the Contract by the combined efforts of
Turkmenistan’s Central Office of State Expert Review, its Ministry of Finance, and its Central

Bank.*°° These three entities are indisputably state organs of Turkmenistan.

348. The insistence of these government agencies on the use of Smeta represented a refusal on
their part, and a consequent failure on the part of Turkmenistan, to respect the contractual
obligations undertaken to Garanti Koza by TAY “on behalf of Turkmenistan Government”5
concerning the terms of payment. As detailed above, the Contract called for Garanti Koza to do
the work required ona lump-sum basis.°°! Twenty percent of the lump sum was to have been, and
indeed was, paid in advance as the Advance Payment, secured by the bank guarantee. The Contract
clearly provided for the remainder to be paid in instalments, each instalment corresponding to the
percentage of the work done at the time of each progress payment, minus 20% of each progress

payment until the Advance Payment was amortized. Specifically:

499 See Buyuksandalyaci WS-1, {45 (‘“I was told by the Control Department of Turkmenavtoyollary that the

Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank would not approve payment claims unless they were submitted using
detailed cost itemisation pricing based on what is known as “CMETA” (also spelled “SMETA”), instead of lump
sum pricing.”)

500-021, Contract Conditions { 1.1(a).

501 See paragraph 62, above.

134

349.

a. The Contract Conditions provide that “Monthly Progress payments to Contractor
by Owner shall be based on percentage progress amounts,” and further provides
that those amounts “shall be taken into consideration as percentage progress criteria

as per Schedule B-2.”50?

b. Schedule B-2 then provides that:

“100% of the price of the listed works mentioned in Schedule B-Iwill be paid (taking into
account 20% for reimbursement of Advance Payment) proportionally for each bridge to
the actually done Construction Works for each month.” 503

c. And the Contract provisions relating to the Advance Payment required that further
payments were to be made against certificates from the contractor that a specified

percentage of the work has been completed. >°+

The insistence on the use of Smeta was a departure from these express terms of the

Contract, and Garanti Koza was prejudiced by that departure in three ways.

502
503
504

505

506

a. First, as Ms. Balakley’s testimony made clear, complying with Smeta is a

burdensome and time-consuming process.>

b. Second, the insistence on compliance with Smeta contributed significantly to the
delay of the project: Garanti Koza’s first Smeta-compliant invoice was not
submitted until November 1, 2008, six months after the submission of Garanti

Koza’s original, Contract-compliant invoice on April 30, 2008.5°°

135

c. Third, and most troubling to the Tribunal, the evidence at the Hearing made it
abundantly clear that Garanti Koza could not both comply with Smeta and submit
accurate invoices for the full Contract Price that TAY had agreed to pay. This is
because Smeta requires that an invoice amount be built up from cost figures, plus a
fixed profit margin. The only way to make invoices add up to an amount equal to
an agreed lump-sum price that provided a higher margin would be, at a minimum,

to manipulate the cost figures.>°7

350. Garanti Koza presented convincing evidence at the Hearing that, from its point of view,
the Contract provisions for payment on a lump sum basis were an important, indeed perhaps the
most important, condition of the Contract. Both the lump sum price and the corresponding
provisions for progress payments calculated as a percentage of that lump sum were unquestionably
terms of the Contract that TAY agreed to. And both the Contract itself and the agreed lump-sum
value of the Contract were specifically approved in a Presidential Decree signed by

Turkmenistan’s President.5°°

351. The Respondent insists that the Contract is governed by Turkmen law, and that Smeta is
required by Turkmen law, so that Garanti Koza should have known that compliance with Smeta

would be required. The Tribunal is not convinced by this argument, for three reasons:

a. First, Mr. Buyuksandalyaci testified that he understood that Smeta is normally
required in Turkmenistan, and that it was precisely to avoid the Smeta system that

Garanti Koza bargained for, and understood that TAY had agreed to, a lump sum

507 See paragraphs 96-101, above.
508 The Decree is quoted in full at paragraph 53, above.

136

price, with progress payments tied to the percentage of work completed rather than

the costs of goods and labor.>°?

b. Second, the evidence advanced by the Respondent that Turkmen law requires the

use of Smeta in all cases was neither clear nor convincing.>!°

c. Third, and most important to this Tribunal, a tribunal constituted under international
law should not undertake to require compliance by a contractor with a provision of
national law (assuming that the national law in fact contains such a provision) that
would effectively require a contractor to be less than completely honest as a

condition of compliance with that provision.>!!

352. The insistence on the use of Smeta represented a failure or refusal by multiple organs of
Turkmenistan’s government to observe the obligations undertaken by TAY in the Contract with
respect to how Garanti Koza would be paid. The Tribunal has already found that the Contract
relates to an investment by the Claimant in Turkmenistan. The obligations in the Contract were
undertaken by TAY, which not only is an agency of Turkmenistan, but which, according to the
Contract, was “acting on behalf and under instructions of the Government of Turkmenistan” when
it signed the Contract,>!? and which stated in the Contract that the Contract was concluded “on the
basis of the Presidential Decree of Turkmenistan No. 9429 dated January 27, 2008.”>!? It is not
necessary to find TAY to be an organ of the State in order to conclude that the obligations it
undertook in the Contract were obligations entered into on behalf of Turkmenistan with regard to

Garanti Koza’s investment in Turkmenistan within the meaning of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

509 Tr. June 9, 2015, pp. 440-442.

510 See paragraphs 103, 302, 310 above.

137

353. The Turkmenistan government agencies responsible for insisting, in disregard of the
obligations undertaken by TAY in the Contract, that Garanti Koza submit invoices in accordance
with Smeta clearly were organs of the State. The Office of State Expert Review is a subdivision
of Turkmenistan’s Ministry of Construction.5!4 The Ministry of Finance is itself a government

ministry. And Turkmenistan’s Central Bank is equally obviously an organ of the State.>!>

354. The Tribunal accordingly concludes that TAY’s undertaking to Garanti Koza to pay
progress payment invoices based on the percentage completed of the lump-sum price of the
Contract was an obligation entered into by TAY on behalf of Turkmenistan with regard to an
investment in Turkmenistan of a UK company. The Tribunal further concludes that the
Government of Turkmenistan, acting through its Office of State Expert Review, Ministry of
Finance, and Central Bank, failed to observe and caused TAY to breach that obligation, in violation
of Article 2(2) of the BIT.

4, The causal relationship between Turkmenistan’s breach and the
Claimant’s injury

355. We now turn to what consequences followed from this breach on the part of Turkmenistan
of its obligations under the BIT. The most obvious consequence of this breach was that Garanti
Koza’s first invoice was not accepted until November 1, 2008, rather than shortly after April 30,
2008. This had the effect of delaying the payment of Garanti Koza’s progress payment invoices

by about six months.

356. However, it is not at all clear that the insistence on Smeta delayed the entire project by six
months. If Garanti Koza had been more prompt in providing an acceptable bank guarantee, the

Advance Payment would have been made earlier than July 2008, and Garanti Koza would have

514 Nepesov WS-l, (2. See paragraph 98, above.
515 See paragraph 8, above.

138

had adequate funding from the time the Advance Payment was made. Thus, while the insistence

on Smeta caused some delay to the project, that delay was in significant part concurrent with delays

attributable to Garanti Koza, including the delay in obtaining the bank guarantee.

357. Other factors also caused delay to the project. These included:

a.

Garanti Koza’ slow start in commencing construction. *!® Garanti Koza blames the
slow start on Turkmenistan’s failures to hand over the sites on which the bridges
were to be built, TAY’s failures to provide technical information, and the failure to
clear debris from the sites. However, the Tribunal does not find Garanti Koza’s
efforts to blame the slow commencement of construction on these alleged failures
on the part of TAY or other agents of Turkmenistan to be supported by the evidence

in the record.

. The delayed arrival of the pile driving machine, which did not arrive in

Turkmenistan until September 2008.5!’ Garanti Koza blames the delayed arrival
of this equipment on military hostilities that slowed the machine’s transit through
Georgia, while the Respondent counters that the machine would have arrived earlier
if Garanti Koza had ordered it earlier.5!8 This delay was certainly not the fault of
Turkmenistan. The Tribunal concludes from the evidence before it that military
hostilities complicated the delivery of the piling rig, but that the delay might have
been shorter, had Garanti Koza commenced the process of getting the machine to

Turkmenistan earlier.

516 See paragraphs 106-113, above.
517 See paragraphs 114-115, above.
518 See paragraph 115, above.

139

c. The delay in procuring the steel beams needed for the three longer bridges.5!9

358. Both sides agree that some sort of agreement was reached to extend the project deadline
from October 2008 to November 2009, although they disagree as to when and how that was done
and whether that agreement was ever reduced to writing.52° As of the beginning of December
2008, work was progressing, payments were being made, and Garanti Koza advised TAY that it
had completed half of its bridges.5?!_ After Garanti Koza — for unexplained reasons — suspended
piling on December 4, work slowed dramatically in the winter of 2009, and then finally stopped
by the summer.>?? No satisfactory explanation for the loss of momentum after early December
was advanced by either side. Since it was Garanti Koza’s obligation to complete the project,
however, and the Tribunal finds Garanti Koza’s efforts to blame the delays (other than those caused
by the insistence on Smeta) on Turkmenistan unconvincing, a significant portion of the

responsibility for not completing the project must rest with Garanti Koza.

359. The Tribunal therefore concludes that Turkmenistan’s breach of its obligations under
Article 2 of the BIT by its insistence on Smeta, although a contributing factor, was by no means
the only cause of the failure of Garanti Koza’s project in Turkmenistan. We will return to assessing

the various causes of that failure in considering the Claimant’s claim for damages.

B. The Claims of Expropriation
360. The Claimant advances two claims under Article 5(1) of the BIT, one for direct
expropriation and one for indirect or “creeping” expropriation. The claim of direct expropriation

alleges that TAY’s termination of the Contract, the seizure of the Claimant’s factory in

519 See paragraph 113, above.
520 See paragraphs 117-119, above.
521 See paragraph 116, above.
522 See paragraphs 130-131, above.

140

Turkmenistan, and the judgment of the Turkmen court all amounted to takings of the Claimant’ s
investment without compensation.5?? The claim of indirect expropriation focuses on the
cumulative effect of the repudiation of the lump sum payment obligation and the insistence on
Smeta, on the refusal of TAY to pay Garanti Koza’s invoices after the first three, and on the

imposition of the delay penalty.>7+

361. All of these claims involve the same series of events. It appears to the Tribunal, based on
the testimony and evidence introduced in this arbitration and summarized in Part IV of this Award,

that the chain of causation linking these events can be summarized as follows:

a. The actions of the Turkmen courts and the seizure of the Claimant’s factory resulted

from the termination of the Contract.

b. The termination of the Contract resulted from Garanti Koza’s failure to complete

the work called for by the Contract.

c. Garanti Koza failed to complete the work called for by the Contract because (i) its
work on the project had fallen behind schedule; and (ii) Garanti Koza stopped work

and abandoned the project.
d. Garanti Koza’s work fell behind schedule for at least four reasons:
i. First, because Garanti Koza got a late start in commencing work;

ii. Second, because of the delay in bringing the pile driving rig to

Turkmenistan;

iii. Third, because of the delay in sourcing the steel beams; and

523 See paragraphs 253-255 above.
524 See paragraphs 256-258 above.

141

iv. Fourth, because Turkmenistan’s insistence on the use of Smeta in the

progress payment invoices had delayed submission of those invoices.

e. Garanti Koza eventually stopped work and abandoned the project because TAY

stopped paying Garanti Koza’s progress payment invoices.

f. TAY stopped paying the progress payment invoices because the bank guarantee

had expired.

362. With this chain of causation in mind, we look first at the claim of direct expropriation and
then at the claim of indirect expropriation.

1. The direct expropriation claim
363. Garanti Koza focuses its claim of direct expropriation on two acts. First, it alleges that, on
February 4, 2010:

[A] committee comprising representatives of Turkmen Highways, the Ministry of
Construction, the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Turkmen intelligence Agency, a
prosecutor/district attorney, as well as otherGovernment personnel, seized Garanti Koza’s
factory and all the equipment, machinery and material it contained. This committee
expelled Garanti Koza’s remaining employees from the factory site.525

Second, it alleges that, by letter of February 22, 2010, TAY “unilaterally and wrongfully

terminated the Contract.”5?¢

364. The evidence submitted to the Tribunal does not support a claim for direct expropriation.
The evidence does indeed show that Garanti Koza’s factory and equipment remaining in
Turkmenistan after it abandoned its work on TAY’s project in mid-2009 were seized by the

Turkmen courts in 2010, but the evidence also supports the Respondent’s argument that the actions

525 Mem. { 151.
526 Mem. ¥ 151.

142

of those courts followed as a matter of normal legal process under Turkmen law from Garanti

Koza’s default under the Contract.5?7

365. A seizure of property by a court as the result of normal domestic legal process does not
amount to an expropriation under international law unless there was an element of serious and
fundamental impropriety about the legal process. Actions by state courts to enforce contract rights,
including rights to terminate a contract, have generally not been held by investment arbitration
tribunals to amount to expropriation, regardless of whether the state or an instrument of the state
is the contract party enforcing its rights. The Jmpregilo tribunal observed that, when a state entity
terminates a contract, the decisive factor is “whether the reasons given for the termination
constituted a legally valid ground for termination according to the provisions of the [...]
Contract.”5?8 Or as the tribunal in Middle East Cement put it, “normally a seizure and auction
ordered by the national courts do not qualify as a taking’ unless “they are not taken ‘under due

process of law.’”529

366. The series of events that led to the proceedings in the Turkmen courts and the attachment
and seizure of Garanti Koza’s property followed the causal sequence outlined in paragraph 361
above. In the view of the Tribunal, the termination of the Contract and the subsequent actions by
the Turkmen courts were largely either the result of choices made by Garanti Koza, including the
decision not to seek an extension or renewal of the bank guarantee, or were caused by

circumstances within its control. The actions of the Turkmen courts in enforcing TAY’s rights

under the contract thus appear to the Tribunal to have met the test articulated in Impregilo, which

appears to this Tribunal to be the correct test.

367. To the extent that the insistence by agencies of Turkmenistan on the use of Smeta
contributed to the delays that afflicted the bridge project and to the ultimate failure of Garanti Koza
to complete the project and the consequent termination of the Contract, those actions have already
been found by the Tribunal to have breached Turkmenistan’s obligations under Article 2 of the
BIT. The Tribunal concludes that those actions were too remote from the takings alleged to have
amounted to a direct expropriation to consider them breaches of Article 5 of the BIT. Even if they
were considered to have contributed to a breach of Article 5, any compensation for such a breach

would merely duplicate the compensation due for the breach of Article 2.

368. The Claimant alleges that the process followed by the Turkmen authorities was harassing

and unfair, pointing to the following sequence of events:

a. In December 2009, the Turkmen tax administration conducted a tax inspection of
Garanti Koza and announced on December 21, 2009, that it was imposing a fine of
approximately USD 1 million for tax violations related to VAT. Garanti Koza
states that it does not understand the reasons for this assessment and suspects that
it was a use by Turkmenistan of “its tax and court apparatus to harass foreign

investors.”°30

b. On December 31, 2009, TAY asked Garanti Koza to return the unapplied balance

of the Advance Payment, USD 14,132,121.22.53!

530 Mem. $91; Buyuksandalyaci WS-1, ff 71-72.
331 Mem. { 92; C-90.

144

In early February 2010, Garanti Koza says that representatives of TAY, the
Ministry of Construction, the Supreme Supervision Agency, accompanied by
police and military forces, came to Garanti Koza’s factory in Mary, conducted an
inventory, and instructed Garanti Koza’s employees to leave the office.5>?_ Given
that “Garanti Koza arranged for its Turkish employees to fly back to Turkey the
next day,”°?3 and the allegation that, as a result of this visit, the factory and its
contents have been held by Turkmenistan since February 4, 2010,>*+ the Tribunal
finds it difficult to understand why Garanti Koza claims to have “fittle information”
about this event.535 In any event, little information about it was provided to the

Tribunal.
On February 8, 2010, the Turkmenistan tax administration issued a notice of fines

and penalties on Garanti Koza.>*°

On February 9, 2010, TAY asserted aclaim against Garanti Koza for USD 3 million
for the delay in the completion of the works, based on the original completion

deadline of October 2008.°*”

On February 20, 2010, TAY wrote to the Chief Prosecutor to ask that he bring suit

against Garanti Koza to terminate the Contract.5?8

On February 22, 2010, TAY unilaterally terminated the Contract.53?

h. The same day, the Chief Prosecutor filed an application with the “Arbitration court
of the Supreme Court of Turkmenistan” to obtain termination of the Contract. That
court summoned Garanti Koza on February 23 to appear before it on February 26,
2010. Garanti Koza states that it did not appear on that date, because it would have

been “futile — and dangerous.”*4°

369. Garanti Koza does not allege that it has actually paid any of the tax or delay assessments
referred to in the preceding paragraphs. Rather, the assessments appear to be put forward in an
attempt to show that the conduct of the Turkmen authorities was improper and that it deprived
Garanti Koza of procedural fairness. Garanti Koza does not allege, and in any event has not
introduced evidence to demonstrate, that the proceedings described represented a departure from
normal legal process in Turkmenistan. Whether or not these measures were wrongful thus seems
to turn on which party was or was not in breach of the Contract, which has already been addressed
in connection with Article 2 of the BIT.
2. The indirect expropriation claim

370. Garanti Koza’s claim of creeping expropriation is basically the same claim as the direct
expropriation claim and fails for the same reason. While the direct expropriation claim focuses on
the seizure of Garanti Koza’s assets after TAY’s imposition of the delay penalty and the
termination of the Contract, the indirect expropriation claim is described as a “series of acts and
omissions starting in the spring of 2008 which made it increasingly difficult for Garanti Koza to

continue work on the Project, ultimately depriving Garanti Koza of its entire investment.”>4!

540 Mem. {f 102-104.
sal Mem. ¥ 132.

146

371. The “series of acts and omissions” alleged by the Claimant to support its claim of indirect
expropriation are the same acts and omissions alleged to support its claim of direct expropriation.
With the exception of the insistence by Turkmenistan on the use of Smeta (which the Tribunal has
already addressed), those acts and omissions were either acts of Garanti Koza itself or followed as
a consequence of actions taken or choices made by Garanti Koza. None of them, in the view of
the Tribunal, amounted to a breach of Article 5 of the BIT.
3. The Claimant’s attempt to import the expropriation clause of other
treaties via the MEN clause

372. In addition to relying on Article 5 of the BIT, Garanti Koza seeks to rely on Article 5 of
the France-Turkmenistan BIT and Article 6 of the United Arab Emirates-Turkmenistan BIT, both
of which it seeks to import through the most-favored-nation (“MFN”) clause contained in Article
3 of the United Kingdom-Turkmenistan BIT. Article 3(1) of the BIT provides that neither
Contracting Party shall, in its territory, subject investments of nationals and companies of the other
Contracting Party to treatment less favorable than that which it affords to investments of nationals
or companies of any third state. Article 3(2) provides the same protection to nationals and
companies of each Contracting Party as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment,

or disposal of their investments.

373. According to Garanti Koza, Article 5 of the France-Turkmenistan BIT contains one
additional condition not found in Article 5 of the BIT that would make a direct or an indirect
expropriation unlawful: Under the France-Turkmenistan BIT, an expropriation must not be

contrary to a specific commitment of the host state.54?

542 Mem. { 126.

147

374. Similarly, according to Garanti Koza, Article 6 of the United Arab Emirates-Turkmenistan
requires that an expropriation “(d) does not violate any specific provision or contractual stability
or expropriation contained in an investment agreement between the natural and juridical persons
concerned and the party making the expropriation,” and also requires that an expropriation be

“accomplished under due procedures of law.”543

375. Garanti Koza’s MEN claim presents two significant difficulties:

a. First, Garanti Koza appears to seek to mix provisions of different treaties to create
a custom-made treaty provision that does not appear in any treaty entered into by

the Respondent.

b. Second, Garanti Koza has not demonstrated that the treatment that it or its
investment would have been accorded under either the France-Turkmenistan BIT
or the United Arab Emirates-Turkmenistan BIT would in fact have been more
favorable to it than the treatment resulting from the application of the UK-

Turkmenistan BIT.

376. Aside from these obstacles, the Tribunal concludes that neither the provisions of the
France-Turkmenistan BIT nor the provisions of the United Arab Emirates-Turkmenistan BIT
would benefit Garanti Koza if either or both were imported by operation of the MEN clause in the
BIT. Even if the Tribunal had found that an expropriation had taken place, a finding with respect
to whether the expropriation had been contrary to a commitment of Turkmenistan would simply
duplicate the findings the Tribunal has already made in connection with the application of the

umbrella clause of the BIT. Similarly, a finding that the expropriation had been made without due

543 Mem. { 126.

148

process would duplicate the findings made in the next section of this Award concerning the claim

of denial of fair and equitable treatment.

377. In addition, the importation of those clauses from the France-Turkmenistan BIT or the
United Arab Emirates-Turkmenistan BIT by way of the MFN clause, even if Article 3(1) of the
BIT could be read to produce such a result, would not change the Tribunal’s conclusion that the

Claimant has failed to show that an expropriation took place at all.

378. The Tribunal accordingly declines to apply the MEN provision of the BIT to make the
expropriation provisions of the France-Turkmenistan BIT or the United Arab Enmirates-
Turkmenistan BIT available to Garanti Koza.
Cc The Claim of Denial of Fair and Equitable Treatment

379. Article 2(2) of the BIT requires that “Investments of nationals or companies of each
Contracting Party shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment.” The BIT, like most
BITs, does not attempt to define the concept of fair and equitable treatment, and tribunals
appointed to decide disputes arising under BITs have struggled to formulate a definition. The
tribunal in Mondev spoke for many when it observed that a “judgment of what is fair and equitable

cannot be reached in the abstract; it must depend on the facts of the particular case.”>4+

380. It is easier to find agreement about what the function of the fair and equitable treatment
standard is than about its content. Unlike the concepts of national treatment and most-favored-
nation protection, which call for comparison to the treatment provided to investors of other

nationalities, the standard of fair and equitable treatment “is an absolute standard that provides a

fixed reference point.”>4> It “helps to ensure that there is at least a minimum level of protection,

derived from fairness and equity, for the investor concerned.”>4°

381. In evaluating whether the actions of a state’s courts and other agencies have breached the
standard of fair and equitable treatment, tribunals have focused on such questions as “whether the
shock or surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified concerns as
to the judicial propriety of the outcome;’*47 whether there has been “a willful disregard of due
process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of judicial propriety;>*8 and
whether there has been “inconsistency of action between two arms of the same government vis-d-
vis the same investor,” that is, has the government acted coherently and applied its policies
consistently.>4°
1. Turkmenistan’s actions before work was suspended

382. The Tribunal concludes that Turkmenistan’s insistence that Garanti Koza’s progress
payment invoices conform to Smeta was a breach of Turkmenistan’s obligation to treat Garanti
Koza’s investment in Turkmenistan fairly and equitably. The inconsistency of behavior between
one agency of the Turkmenistan Government, which had agreed to a system of payment based on
the percentage of work completed, and other arms of the same Government that insisted that

payment could only be made against invoices built up from costs, plus a limited profit margin, as

required to conform to Smeta, would alone have been sufficient to call into question whether the

Claimant had been treated fairly and equitably.

383. More important to this Tribunal, however, Turkmenistan’s insistence on Smeta invoicing
effectively forced Garanti Koza to choose between submitting accurate invoices, and consequently
accepting less compensation than it had bargained for, or manipulating its invoices in order to
receive the full compensation that TAY had agreed to pay. The Tribunal considers that using
governmental power to put an investor in such a situation is so fundamentally unfair as to amount

by itself to a denial of fair and equitable treatment.

384. The Tribunal has nevertheless already found that this same behavior represented a failure
by Turkmenistan to observe the obligations to Garanti Koza undertaken by TAY in the Contract
in breach of the umbrella clause of the BIT. The same conduct of the Respondent has thus been
found to have breached Article 2(2) in two different respects. This finding increases the confidence
of the Tribunal that Turkmenistan has indeed breached its obligations to Garanti Koza under the
BIT, but — as will be seen in the section of this Award dealing with relief and compensation — does
not mean that Garanti Koza is entitled to more than one recovery for the same injury.
2. The actions of Turkmenistan’s courts after work was suspended

385. Garanti Koza’s complaint that Turkmenistan’s behavior after termination of the Contract
breached its duty to treat U.K. investors fairly and equitably essentially duplicates its claims of
direct and indirect expropriation, and fails for the same reason. The Tribunal has already found
that Turkmenistan’s insistence that progress payment invoices be prepared in accordance with
Smeta breached its obligations under the BIT, but it has also found that breach to have been only
acontributing cause to the failure of Garanti Koza’s project. Ultimately, that project failed because

Garanti Koza stopped work. Garanti Koza stopped work because it stopped receiving payment.

151

And Garanti Koza stopped receiving payment, not because of Turkmenistan’s insistence that

invoices be prepared in accordance with Smeta, but because the bank guarantee had expired.

386. Garanti Koza complains about the tax assessments made by the Turkmenistan authorities
in December 2009, but it does not claim to have paid any of those assessments, and it has not
demonstrated that any consequence followed from them. The Tribunal thus has no basis for
concluding that those assessments were or were not breaches of Turkmenistan’s duty to treat
Garanti Koza’s investment fairly and equitably. Since the Claimant bears the burden of
demonstrating a breach of the BIT, the Tribunal declines to base any finding of a breach on the

acts of the tax authorities.

387. The actions of the other Turkmenistan authorities in and following February 2010 have
been discussed in connection with the claim of expropriation. With the possible exception of the
USD 3 million penalty for late performance, Garanti Koza has failed to show that any of these
actions departed from normal procedures under Turkmenistan law, or that Turkmenistan law in
this respect represents such a fundamental departure from international norms as to put

Turkmenistan in breach of its obligation of fair and equitable treatment.

388. The Tribunal is troubled by the award of the USD 3 million delay penalty in March 2010.
Garanti Koza complains that the penalty was improperly calculated from November 1, 2008, even
though the completion date had been extended to November 1, 2009.°5° Mr. Buyuksandalyaci
asserts that notice of the court proceedings at which the penalty was imposed was too short to
permit Garanti Koza to defend itself, and in any event that no Turkmenistan lawyer would

represent Garanti Koza against the Government.55!

550 Mem. 4 179; see paragraphs 117-119, above.
551 Buyuksandalyaci WS-1, 9{ 78-79.

152

389. Garanti Koza does not allege that it ever paid the USD 3 million delay penalty, so there has
been no showing that it has actually been injured by its imposition. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is
finds several elements of the procedure by which the delay penalty was imposed troubling. These
are: (a) the calculation of the penalty from October 2008 rather than November 2009; (b) the
absence of Garanti Koza from the court proceedings; and (c) the speed with which those
proceedings were conducted. The Respondent denies that the deadline for completion of the
project was extended,>*? but the Tribunal finds the correspondence from TAY, quoted at paragraph
118 above, was sufficient to allow Garanti Koza to believe that the deadline had been extended,
and the Respondent does not deny that the delay penalty was based in part on the original

completion date of October 2008.5°?

390. Despite these concerns, the fact remains that Garanti Koza has not paid the USD 3 million
delay penalty, so the Tribunal declines to find any breach of the BIT in connection with the
assessment of that penalty. However, the Tribunal will decline to credit the Respondent with any
part of the unpaid delay penalty in calculating the compensation due to Garanti Koza as a result of
Turkmenistan’s breach of its duty to respect the obligations undertaken to Garanti Koza and its
breach of its duty to accord Garanti Koza fair and equitable treatment in connection with the
insistence on Smeta.
D. The Claim of Denial of Full Protection and Security

391. Article 2(2) of the BIT provides that investments of each Contracting Party shall enjoy full
protection and security in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Tribunals in investment

treaty arbitrations have divided over whether such an obligation should be read simply to require

552 Rej. { 160.
553 CMem. { 134.

153

host governments to take responsibility for the physical security of investments protected by the
BIT, or should be read more broadly to encompass protection against harassment falling short of

physical harm or seizure.5>4

392. This Tribunal does not need to attempt to resolve the varying approaches to this standard.
First, Garanti Koza’s claims concerning the acts of Turkmenistan alleged to have breached this
obligation, to which it devotes a single paragraph in its Memorial on the Merits, are the same acts
already considered in connection with its umbrella clause, expropriation, and FET claims.*>

Second, the Claimant does not refer to this claim in its Post-Hearing Brief, confirming that the

Claimant itself must consider the claim duplicative of its other claimed breaches of the BIT.

393. For largely the same reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s effort to use the MFN
clause of the BIT to import the obligations of Turkmenistan under Article 2(3) of the United Arab
Emirates-Turkmenistan BIT and Article 4(1) of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT. The
Claimant argues that those provisions obligate the Respondent not to impair by unreasonable or
arbitrary measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investments. 55°
So does the BIT. The Claimant fails to explain how the obligations of Turkmenistan under the
United Arab Emirates—Turkmenistan BIT and the Switzerland—Turkmenistan BIT would provide
more favorable treatment to the Claimant or its investment than the parallel obligations of the BIT

under which this claim is brought.

394. The Tribunal considers that this claim adds nothing to the other claims already considered,

and accordingly rejects it.

554 Compare CL-70, Saluka v. Czech Republic, { 484 (“to protect more specifically the physical integrity of an
investment”) with CL-44, Vivendi v. Argentina — Award, | 7.4.15-17 (an investment “could be subject to harassment
without being physically harmed or seized”).

154

E. The Claim that the Management, Maintenance, Use, Enjoyment, or Disposal
of the Claimant’s Investment Was Subjected to Unreasonable or
Discriminatory Measures

395. Article 2(2) of the BIT provides that neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by

unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or

disposal of investments in its territory of companies of the other Contracting Party.

396. Garanti Koza asserts that Turkmenistan breached this obligation by (a) “imposing a
different pricing method” than Garanti Koza had been led to expect when the Contract was
negotiated, thus coercing it into accepting a change to its bargain, (b) imposing the delay penalty,

and (c) terminating the Contract.>57

397. The Tribunal has already found that the actions of Turkmenistan in insisting that progress
payment invoices conform to Smeta breached Turkmenistan’s obligations under the umbrella
clause and represented a denial of fair and equitable treatment. It has also already addressed the
imposition of the delay penalty and concluded that, because Garanti Koza has not paid that penalty,
no action on the Tribunal’s part is required other than to decline to give it any effect in its
calculations. Garanti Koza’s allegations that these same actions subjected its management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, and disposal of its investment to unreasonable measures adds

nothing to the breaches of the BIT already found by the Tribunal.

398. The termination of the Contract, the Tribunal has also already found, resulted from a
sequence of events precipitated primarily by Garanti Koza’s cessation of work after its decision

not to renew its bank guarantee led to the cessation of progress payments. The Tribunal does not

597 Mem. 4 206-208.

155

find the termination to have been an unreasonable measure, and Garanti Koza presented no

evidence to support the allegation that it was discriminatory.

399. This claim of a breach of Article 2(2) of the BIT thus adds nothing to Garanti Koza’s case
and is accordingly rejected as either unsubstantiated or duplicative of the other claims considered.
FE. Summary of Findings as to Liability
400. For the reasons explained in Section VIII.A of this Award, the Tribunal finds that
Turkmenistan’s insistence on the use of Smeta in submitting progress payment invoices breached
its obligations under Article 2(2) of the BIT to observe the obligations entered into with Garanti
Koza by TAY with respect to the method of payment under the Contract. For the reasons explained
in Section VIII.C, the Tribunal also finds that the same insistence on the use of Smeta breached
Turkmenistan’s obligation under Article 2(2) of the BIT to provide fair and equitable treatment to

the Claimant’s investments in Turkmenistan.

401. For the reasons also explained in Section VIII.C, the Tribunal finds the process by which
the USD 3 million delay penalty was imposed on Garanti Koza in March 2010 to be troubling, but
also concludes that, because that penalty was not paid, no action on the part of the Tribunal is
required with regard to that penalty other than to give it no effect in making the Tribunal’s

calculations.

402. As explained in the remaining portions of Part VIII of this Award, the Tribunal rejects all
of the Claimant’s other allegations of breaches of the BIT, and finds that Turkmenistan’s conduct
with regard to the Claimant and its investments did not amount to expropriation (direct or indirect),
or deny the Claimant fair and equitable treatment except as stated immediately above, or deny the
Claimant full protection and security, or subject the management, use, enjoyment, or disposal of

the Claimant’s investments to unreasonable or discriminatory measures.

156

IX. RELIEF AND COMPENSATION

403. The Tribunal has found, as explained in detail above, that Turkmenistan breached its
obligations under Article 2(2) of the BIT by requiring Garanti Koza to submit progress payment
invoices that conformed to Smeta, in disregard of the obligations undertaken to Garanti Koza by
TAY in the Contract and in breach of Turkmenistan’s duty to accord Garanti Koza’s investment
fair and equitable treatment. The Tribunal turns now to the appropriate relief and compensation

following from those breaches.

A. Damages Sought by Garanti Koza
404. Garanti Koza seeks USD 46.1 million in damages in this arbitration. Although the figures
have evolved over the course of the proceeding, the claim presented to the Tribunal during closing

argument sought the following amounts:

Loss of Profits : USD 14.0 million
Loss of Factory: USD 8.9 million
Loss of Equipment: USD 10.3 million
Loss of Know-how: USD 12.0 million
Total: USD 46.1 million558

B. Turkmenistan’s Damages Calculation
405. The Respondent’s figures also evolved over the course of the proceeding, an evolution
complicated by the substitution of one expert on quantum for another between the Respondent’s

first and second submissions.5>? By the time of closing argument, the Respondent’s position was

558 Garanti Koza’s Closing Presentation, slide 102.
559 See Closing Tr. December 14, 2015, pp. 1349-1351.

157

that Garanti Koza had been overpaid for its work on the project, and indeed owed Turkmenistan

USD 13.6 million, on the following calculation:

Overpayment under Contract (USD 9.3 million)

Delay penalty: (USD 3 million)

Tax penalty: (USD 1.3 million)
Total: (USD 13.6 million)560

Cc The Tribunal’s Calculation of Compensation
406. The Tribunal does not feel that it is necessary for it to review all of the arguments advanced
by each Party concerning the quantum of injury that each claims to have suffered or the relief
appropriate for each breach of the BIT. It suffices for purposes of this award to explain the
conclusions it has reached concerning the claims, and the particular figures, put forward by each
side during closing argument. We start with the figures put forward by the Respondent.
1. Turkmenistan’s claimed tax penalty
407. The Respondent does not seek any monetary recovery in this proceeding other than its
costs. Rather, it asks that the case should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, or, if jurisdiction

is sustained, that all claims should be dismissed on the merits.56!

408. Nevertheless, the Respondent asks the Tribunal to take into account, in its calculations, the
tax penalty imposed on Garanti Koza by the tax authorities of Turkmenistan.5°? The Tribunal
declines to do so. The Respondent made no effort to prove in this proceeding that tax payments
were due from Garanti Koza, and the Tribunal declines to enforce an assessment for which no

basis has been shown.

561 Rsp. PHB {{ 205.

562 Respondent’s Closing Presentation, slide 10.

158

2. Turkmenistan’s claimed delay penalty
409. The Tribunal similarly declines to give any weight in its calculations to the delay penalty
of USD 3 million assessed by the courts of Turkmenistan against Garanti Koza. First, as explained
above, the Tribunal is troubled by the assessment of a delay penalty based on the original target
completion date of October 2008, rather than the extended target completion date of November 1,
2009, and by the summary nature of the proceedings in which the penalty was imposed and the

very short notice given to Garanti Koza of those proceedings.

410. In addition, the delay penalty suffers from the same lack of foundation as the tax penalty.
Indeed, the Respondent concedes that “the statement of claim for USD 3,000,000 is not in the
record” in this proceeding.*°* The Respondent’s attempt to assess that penalty in this proceeding,
to the extent of offsetting it against Garanti Koza’s claims, thus also fails for lack of any proof of

any proper basis for the penalty.

411. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it should decline to recognize the delay
penalty in making its calculations. Since Garanti Koza does not claim to have actually paid the
penalty, no further relief on this account is indicated.

3. Turkmenistan’s claimed overpayment
412.  Turkmenistan’s claim that Garanti Koza was overpaid for its work under the Contract will
be considered below in connection with Garanti Koza’s claim that it was not paid enough for that
work.

4, Garanti Koza’s claim for loss of know-how
413. The Tribunal propounded a series of written questions to the parties after the Hearing on

the merits and prior to the hearing for closing argument. The Tribunals’ Question No. 24 was

563 Rsp. PHB { 141.

159

“Where in the record is the evidence of the value of the know-how or other intellectual property

licensed by Garanti Koza?’>°4

414.  Turkmenistan’s response to Question 24 was direct: it said that “There is no credible
evidence in the record to support Claimant’s allegation that it acquired ‘know-how’ for use in the
project valued at USD 12 million, from its Turkish parent company.”°°> In addition, the
Respondent argues, “To the extent that any ‘know-how’ was required to construct the concrete
beams and piles for the bridges, or to operate the factory to produce them, the cost of that know-

how was already reflected in the Contract price.”>°°

415. Garanti Koza did not organize its Post-Hearing Brief to correspond to the Tribunal’s
Questions. The only response to Question 24 that the Tribunal was able to identify consisted of
the discussion of the know-how claim at paragraphs 212-217 of the Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief.
That discussion acknowledges that the USD 12 million valuation placed on the know-how by Mr.
Boulton, the Claimant’s quantum expert, was based only on the contract entered into between
Garanti Koza and its parent.5°7 That contract neither specifies what the know-how is nor the

method used to value it.>°

416. Indeed, in adopting that valuation, Mr. Boulton acknowledged that he was unable to
describe the know-how or to identify anything confidential or proprietary about it.56 Mr. Boulton

nevertheless insisted that the know-how must have had value, even if Garanti Koza’s competitors

565 Rsp. PHB {{ 100.

567 Indeed, in his report, Mr. Boulton simply states that he was “instructed that the full USD 12 million is due
to GKI in respect of the know-how.” Boulton ER, { 6.7.4.

160

might have similar or equivalent know-how,>7° as Mr. Buyuksandalyaci had conceded that they

did.57!

417. The Tribunal finds no credible basis in the record for assigning any value to this know-

how and therefore assigns no value to it.

418. Having rejected the Claimant’s expropriation claims, the Tribunal also finds no legal basis

for awarding any relief with respect to the know-how.

419. These conclusions make it unnecessary for the Tribunal to rule on the Respondent’s request
that the Tribunal draw a negative inference from the Claimant’s alleged failure to produce
documents to support the arms-length nature of the know-how contract or the value of the know-
how.>7?
5. Garanti Koza’s claim for loss of factory and equipment

420. Garanti Koza claims USD 10.3 million for the loss of equipment taken by or lost to
Turkmenistan.°7? Much of this equipment was leased by Garanti Koza from GKI.574 At the
Hearing, Mr. Boulton put a value on Garanti Koza’s factory equipment of USD 2.2 million after
depreciation.°7> Mr. Boulton adds USD 1.8 million for the value of the “cast,” the steel and wood

framework into which concrete was poured to fabricate piles and beams.

421. Mr. Qureshi, the Respondent’s quantum expert, put a value of zero on Garanti Koza’s

equipment, because he felt that the evidence of value relied on by Mr. Boulton was insufficiently

supported.>7° He also notes that paragraph 4.14 of the Contract provides that, after completion of
the project, Garanti Koza was to remove the plant and all other structures. Mr. Qureshi accepted

a value of USD 1.5 million for the cast.577

422. In addition, Garanti Koza claims USD 8.9 million for the loss of its factory in

Turkmenistan.

423. The Tribunal rejects these claims for loss of factory and equipment. Garanti Koza has not
established that its loss of the factory and equipment resulted from any breach of the BIT by
Turkmenistan. For the reasons explained above, the Tribunal has rejected Garanti Koza’s claims
for direct and indirect expropriation of the factory and equipment as well as its other claims of

breach related to these assets.

424. The Tribunal finds no causal connection between the two claims accepted by the Tribunal
— the Claimant’s umbrella clause claim and its FET claim — and the loss of the factory and
equipment. The claims for the loss of the factory and equipment thus fail for lack of a causal
connection to any breach of the BIT by Turkmenistan.
6. The competing claims for loss of profit and overpayment

425. Garanti Koza claims USD 14 million in lost profits that it would have received under the
Contract but for Turkmenistan’s breaches of the BIT. Turkmenistan, while denying any breaches,
asserts that Garanti Koza was overpaid by USD 9.3 million for the work it actually performed. We
therefore commence with an inquiry into whether the compensation already paid to Garanti Koza
by TAY fell short of or exceeded what was due to Garanti Koza for the work that had been

completed before it abandoned the project.

576 Qureshi Hearing Presentation, slide 18.
877 Qureshi Hearing Presentation, slide 18.

162

426. It is common ground that Garanti Koza received two sorts of payments from TAY, an
Advance Payment and three progress payments, in the following amounts:

Advance Payment: USD 17,391,304
Progress payments, after

deducting 20% for

reimbursement of Advance: USD 9,917,387

Total received: USD 27,308,691578

427. The parties disagree about the amount of work actually completed by Garanti Koza. The
Claimant claims to have completed 34.31% of the USD 86,956,522 value of the project by the
time work stopped in June 2009.579 The Respondent disputes that figure, and asserts that only

20.7% of the project was completed.**°

428. The Tribunal would have great difficulty resolving the disagreement between the Parties
and their respective experts concerning the retrospective evaluations of the percentage of work
completed. Instead of attempting to do so, the Tribunal turns to the contemporaneous evidence on
the subject, consisting of Garanti Koza’s 13 progress payment certificates submitted to TAY.58!
The Tribunal is well aware that, of those 13 certificates and the accompanying invoices, only the
first three were paid by TAY, and only those first three and the next five were approved, while the
last five were submitted after work had ceased and were not approved by TAY.°*? Nevertheless,
these invoices seem to the Tribunal to be the only available contemporaneous evidence of the work

actually performed by Garanti Koza.

578 See Boulton ER, { 4.1.4; Respondent’s Closing Presentation, slide 7.

579 Claimant’s Closing Presentation slide 79.
580 Respondent's Closing Presentation, slide 7.
581 Mem. § 228.

582 See above at paragraphs 120, 133.

163

429. The 13 invoices submitted by Garanti Koza to TAY collectively claim that the value of the
work performed by Garanti Koza was USD 29,838,591. Subtracting from that figure the USD
27,308,691 actually paid by TAY to Garanti Koza (the sum of the Advance Payment and the
amounts paid on the first three invoices) leaves a difference of USD 2,529,900.583 That difference
represents the amount of work that Garanti Koza documented (albeit partially after the fact) having

performed and for which it has not been paid.

430. That amount, USD 2,529,900, added to the unapplied portion of the Advance Payment
already in the possession of Garanti Koza, seems to the Tribunal to be the appropriate amount of
compensation to award Garanti Koza for Turkmenistan’s failure to observe the obligations
undertaken to Garanti Koza with respect to the calculation of progress payments by insisting on
the use of Smeta and its parallel breach of its duty to accord fair and equitable treatment to Garanti
Koza’s investment in Turkmenistan. By disregarding the USD 3 million delay penalty, the same
calculation takes into account the Tribunal’s concerns about the process by which that penalty was

imposed.

431. This USD 2,529,900 is considerably less than the amount — USD 4,408,056 — by which
Garanti Koza claims that it had to reduce the amounts of its invoices to TAY because of the

requirement that it use Smeta.>*4

But the insistence on Smeta, while it was a substantial
contributing cause, was not the sole cause of Garanti Koza’s inability to complete the bridge

project and the termination of the Contract, and the Tribunal declines to award a greater amount

of compensation for this breach.

583 Mem. 230; Cl. PHB 87.
584 Mem. { 74.

164

432. Garanti Koza also seeks an award of the lost profits it expected to earn on the Contract if
it had taken the project to completion. The Tribunal declines to make any such award. As
explained in more detail above, Garanti Koza appears to the Tribunal to have brought the failure
of the project largely on itself, by its slow start, the pile driving rig and steel beam delays, and
most important, its decision not to seek an extension of the bank guarantee. There is already a
substantial element of profit built into Garanti Koza’s calculation of the value of the work
completed, and that seems to the Tribunal sufficient compensation for the specific breaches of the

BIT found by the Tribunal.

433. The Tribunal accordingly directs Turkmenistan to pay compensation to Garanti Koza for
its breaches of Article 2 of the BIT in the amount of USD 2,529,900.

D. Interest
434. Turkmenistan should pay interest on the USD 2,529,900 awarded in the previous section
from August 13, 2009, the date of the last invoice submitted by Garanti Koza to TAY, until the

date of payment.

435. Such interest shall be paid at the rate of two percent (2%) per year. The Contract provides
for payment of interest on any sum due under the Contract at 0.1% per day, “but not to exceed 3%
in total.”585 The interest awarded in this Award is not interest on any sum due under the Contract,
but the Tribunal nevertheless considers paragraph 11.2 of the Contract Conditions to be indicative
of an understanding between the Parties concerning the maximum rate of interest to be paid on
sums owed by one to the other. The Tribunal is also conscious that current market interest rates,
such as the U.S. dollar one-year LIBOR rate, have ranged roughly between 0.7% and 2% since

2009. The Tribunal adopts the upper end of that range, 2%, as the appropriate rate for this Award.

585 C021, Contract Conditions {| 11.2.

165

The Tribunal considers 2% to be both a fair rate for the period and also within the understanding

of the Parties concerning interest rates as expressed in the Contract.

436. Since paragraph 11.2 of the Contract Conditions provides for simple interest, the Tribunal
denies the Claimant’s request that the interest awarded be compounded twice a year.
E. The Declarations Requested

437. In addition to compensation, Garanti Koza asks the Tribunal to make three declarations :58°

a. adeclaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the ICSID Convention and

within the competence of this Tribunal;

b. a declaration that Turkmenistan has breached the United Kingdom-Turkmenistan
BIT, and specifically (1) its obligation under Article 5 not to unlawfully expropriate
Garanti Koza’s investment; (2) its obligation under Article 2(2) of the BIT to treat
Garanti Koza’s investment fairly and equitably; (3) its obligation under Article 2(2)
of the BIT to observe any obligation it entered into with regard to Garanti Koza’s
investment; (4) its obligation under Article 2(2) not to impair the management, use,
enjoyment, and disposal of Garanti Koza’s investment; and (5) its obligation under
Article 2(2) to provide Garanti Koza’s investment with full protection and security;

and

c. a declaration that Garanti Koza has properly offset the balance of the Advance
Payment against the gross amount owing, with the result that none of the Advance

Payment is due to Turkmenistan.

586 Cl, PHB 4.220.

166

438. The Tribunal grants the first request, and declares that this dispute is within the jurisdiction

of the ICSID Convention and within the competence of this Tribunal.

439. The Tribunal grants the second request in part, and declares that Turkmenistan has
breached the BIT, and specifically: (1) its obligation under Article 2(2) of the BIT to observe any
obligation it entered into with regard to Garanti Koza’s investment; and (2) its obligation under
Article 2(2) of the BIT to treat Garanti Koza’s investment fairly and equitably. The Tribunal does
not find that Turkmenistan has breached the BIT in the other respects claimed by the Claimant and

thus declines to make the additional declarations requested.

440. In response to the third request, the Tribunal declares that the award of compensation made
by the Tribunal applies the balance of the Advance Payment held by Garanti Koza to the work

completed, with the result that no refund of the Advance Payment is due to TAY by Garanti Koza.

441. The Respondent asks the Tribunal to make a finding that it has not violated its obligations

under the BIT.587 In view of the Tribunal’s findings to the contrary, that request is denied.

XxX. COSTS

442. Each Party has asked for an award of its costs in this arbitration. 588

A. The Claimant’s Costs Application
443. Inits Costs Submission dated January 22,2016, Garanti Koza asked for the following items

of costs:

587 Closing Tr. December 14, 2015, pp. 1597-1598.
588 Cl, PHB 4{ 220; Rsp. PHB 205.

167

a. Fees paid to ICSID on account of registration fees, administration, and the fees and

expenses of the arbitrators: USD 725,000.

b. Costs of legal representation, consisting of:

i. Fixed fee of King & Spalding;

ii. Success premium of King & Spalding;

iii. Fixed fee of the GUR law firm;

iv. Success premium of the GUR law firm;

c. Travel, accommodation, and other expenses;

d. Witness and expert costs; and

e. Miscellaneous expenses.
B. The Respondent’s Costs Application
444. In its costs submission dated January 22, 2016, Turkmenistan asks for the following items

of costs:

a. Fees paid to ICSID on account of administration and the fees and expenses of the

arbitrators, which now amount to USD 700,000;

b. Costs of legal representation, consisting of the fees of Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt

& Mosle LLP and of Gurel Yoruker Law Offices; and

c. Expert fees and expenses.

168

Cc The Respondent’s Objection to Claimant’s Costs Application

445. By letter dated February 5, 2016, the Respondent objected to that portion of the Claimant’ s
costs application that asked for a “success premium” for the Claimant’s law firms in addition to

the fees already paid to those firms.

446. The Claimant’s costs submission itemizes, but does not explain, certain “success
premiums” that the Claimant appears to have agreed to pay the law firms representing it in this
arbitration. Some of these success fees are stated to be fixed amounts, and some are expressed in

terms of a percentage of any recovery at specified levels of recovery.

447. The Respondent submits that no “success premium” should be included in any award of
costs. The Respondent argues that such premiums are not “expenses incurred by the parties in
connection with the proceedings” within the meaning of the ICSID Convention.58? Respondent
cites and quotes Professor Hanotiau to the effect that success fees “are not properly defense

costs.”59°

448. In view of the Tribunal’s decision on costs, below, the Tribunal need not address this
disagreement concerning success fees.

D. The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs
449. Garanti Koza is the prevailing party in this arbitration, in that the Tribunal requires
Turkmenistan to make a payment to Garanti Koza as compensation for breaches on the part of
Turkmenistan of certain obligations under the BIT, specifically the obligations to observe the
obligations entered into with Garanti Koza with regard to its investment in Turkmenistan and to
provide that investment fair and equitable treatment.
589 See ICSID Convention Art. 61(2).

INTERNATIONAL ARBITRATION 213 (Dossier of the ICC Institute of World Business Law 2006), p. 219.

169

450. Garanti Koza did not, however, prevail on all of its claims. Garanti Koza did prevail on
the objection to jurisdiction for lack of consent, in ruling on which the Tribunal reserved the
question of costs until the end of the arbitration proceeding, and on the jurisdictional issues
considered in this award. However, the Tribunal rejected Garanti Koza’s claims of expropriation
(direct and indirect), its claim that Turkmenistan subjected it to unreasonable and discriminatory
measures, and its claim that Turkmenistan failed to provide its investment with full protection and
security. Moreover, Garanti Koza is awarded only about five percent of the compensation it
sought. The Tribunal considers it appropriate to take the degree to which Garanti Koza prevailed
into consideration, along with the fact that it prevailed, in ruling on the Parties’ competing

applications for costs.

451. In accordance with Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Rule 47(1)(j), the
Tribunal rules that the Respondent should pay one-half of the costs paid to ICSID by Garanti Koza

in this arbitration, but that each Party should bear its own costs of legal representation.

452. The Respondent is therefore directed to pay Garanti Koza USD 362,500 in reimburse me nt
of one-half of the payments made by Garanti Koza to ICSID on account of registration fees,
administration, and the fees and expenses of the arbitrators. Garanti Koza’s application for
reimbursement of its legal fees and expenses is denied. Each party should bear its own costs of

legal representation.

I. BACKGROUND
A. The Dispute
1. The Claimant, Garanti Koza LLP (“Garanti Koza” or the “Claimant’’), a limited
liability company incorporated in the United Kingdom, submitted a Request for Arbitration (the
“Request”) dated May 18, 2011 to the Secretary-General of the International Centre for the
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on May 19, 2011. In that Request,
Garanti Koza demanded institution of arbitration proceedings against Turkmenistan
(“Turkmenistan” or the “Respondent’”) under the terms of a bi-lateral investment treaty (a “BIT’’)
entitled Agreement between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the Government of Turkmenistan for the Promotion and Protection of
Investments which entered into force on February 9, 1995 (the “U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT” or
“U.K. BIT” or “the BIT”). Garanti Koza supplemented its Request by letters dated July 4, 11, 13
and 19, 2011. The Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Claimant’s Request on July 20,
2011.
2. According to the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration:

The present dispute arises out of the investments on the 28 highway

bridges and overpasses in Turkmenistan. A contract regarding the

investments in Turkmenistan numbered 01/2008 and dated 18.03.2008 for

the lump sum price of USD 100.000.000 (“Contract”) was entered into by

and between State Concern Turkmenautoyollari as the owner and Garanti

Koza LLP as the contractor for the execution of the projection,

construction, and installation works of 28 highway bridges and
overpasses.

kK

(1) In breach of its obligations, by using the state power, the Respondent
has avoided to make the payments it has undertook to pay, tried to change
the contract regarding the investment which is established as a lump sum
price contract into unit price contract, made requests which contradict with
its rights and obligations, tried to change the terms and conditions of the
Contract to the favor of the Respondent and tried to prevent the

continuation of the works in various ways, thus did not fulfill its
obligations.

(2) Garanti Koza LLP suffered losses and damages as a consequence of
the Respondent’s intention to confiscate the assets and investments of
Garanti Koza LLP by not performing its related obligations and attempt to
undermine the investment.

3. The Respondent summarizes the dispute between the parties in somewhat
different terms:

On March 18, 2008, Garanti Koza LLP, a U.K.-registered entity controlled
by the Turkish company Garanti Koza Insaat Sanayi ve Tikaret A.S., and
Turkmenavtoyollary, the highway authority, concluded a construction
contract for the design and construction of 28 highway bridges and
overpasses on the Mary-Turkmenabad highway in Turkmenistan (the
“Contract’”). In 2009, Garanti Koza LLP suspended all the works under
the Contract with Turkmenavtoyollary. The parties to the Contract
exchanged their views on the dispute related to the performance of the
Contract by correspondence and in person, but this did not result in a
resolution of the dispute. On February 22, 2010, Turkmenavtoyollary
invoked termination of the Contract under Article 17 of the Contract
Conditions, in view of the Contractor’s failure to complete the work on
time and failure to resume works for a prolonged period of time.”

B. The Tribunal
4. The Arbitral Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Articles 37(2)(b) and 38
of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of
Other States (“ICSID Convention’):
e The Claimant appointed Mr. George Constantine Lambrou of Athens, Greece as an
arbitrator on September 26, 2011. Mr. Lambrou accepted his appointment on October 7,

2011.

' Request for Arbitration, p. 3.

Respondent’s Memorial, 13.

e The Respondent appointed Professor Laurence Boisson de Chazournes of Geneva,
Switzerland as an arbitrator on October 18, 2011. Prof. Boisson de Chazournes accepted
her appointment on October 26, 2011.

e The Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council appointed Mr. John M. Townsend of
Washington, D.C., U.S.A., as President of the Tribunal on April 10, 2012. Mr. Townsend
accepted his appointment on April 13, 2012.

Mr. Marco Tulio Montafiés-Rumayor, Legal Counsel to ICSID, was appointed to act as Secretary
to the Tribunal.

5. The Tribunal was formally constituted on April 13, 2012. The members of the
Tribunal submitted their signed declarations in accordance with Rule 6(2) of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Rules”) and copies of those declarations were
distributed to the parties by the Secretary.>

6. After postponements made at the request of the parties, a first session of the
Tribunal with the parties was held in Washington, D.C. on October 19, 2012 (the “First
Session”). At the First Session, the parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly constituted
and that neither party had any objection to the appointment of any member of the Tribunal.*

Cc. Objections to Jurisdiction

7. In response to a request for comments on a proposed agenda for the First Session,
the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the “Respondent has objections to jurisdiction that are
separate and distinct from the merits and warrant bifurcation.”> In response to a request from the

Tribunal for a more specific description of its objections to jurisdiction, the Respondent sent a

3 Procedural Order No. 1, 2.1, 2.2.
4 Procedural Order No. 1, 2.1.

letter to the Tribunal on September 5, 2012 specifying two grounds upon which it objected to
jurisdiction:

Respondent hereby informs the Tribunal that it intends to assert
jurisdictional objections on the following grounds: (i) Turkmenistan did
not consent to ICSID jurisdiction under the Agreement between the United
Kingdom and Turkmenistan for the Protection and Promotion of
Investments (“U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT’) and (ii) most of the claims
brought by Claimant are contractual in nature and therefore not within the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal.

First, the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to decide the merits of
this dispute due to the lack of Turkmenistan’s consent to ICSID arbitration
under Article 8 of the UK-Turkmenistan BIT. The BIT specifically
requires that in order for a dispute to be submitted to ICSID, an agreement
to ICSID arbitration between the investor and the BIT’s Contracting Party
must exist. Respondent respectfully submits that in the absence of
Turkmenistan’s consent to submit this dispute to ICSID, this Tribunal
does not have jurisdiction over the claims brought by Claimant.

Claimant has attempted to import into the UK-Turkmenistan BIT
an alleged consent by Turkmenistan to ICSID arbitration contained in
another BIT. Claimant’s reliance on Article 3 of the UK-Turkmenistan
BIT to bypass the essential requirement of the State’s consent to ICSID
arbitration is to no avail. That consent cannot be imported from a different
BIT when Turkmenistan manifestly did not give such consent in the basic
BIT. As is clear from the wording of Article 8 of the UK Turkmenistan
BIT, the Contracting Parties expressly agreed that there could be no ICSID
arbitration of a dispute in the absence of a specific agreement between the
investor and the Contracting Party to submit the dispute to ICSID.

 

Secondly, it is clear that most of Claimant’s claims are contractual
in nature. They arise under the Contract concluded between Garanti Koza
LLP and Turkmenavtoyollary, by which the Claimant agreed to resolve
disputes “of any kind” pursuant to the dispute-resolution mechanism of
Article 21 of the Contract Conditions. The dispute-resolution mechanism
agreed to by the Claimant provided for the jurisdiction of the Arbitration
Court of Turkmenistan, with a possibility of subsequent submission of the
dispute to an arbitral tribunal in The Hague. The Claimant has invoked the
mechanism under the BIT in order to avoid the dispute resolution
mechanism provided for in the Contract, as Turkmenistan will show.°

Letter from Counsel for the Respondent to the Tribunal, September 5, 2012 (emphasis in original).

8. At the First Session on October 19, 2012, the parties agreed, without prejudice to
the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction, that this proceeding would be conducted in
accordance with the ICSID Arbitration Rules in force as of April 10, 2006, at the seat of the
Centre in Washington, D.C.’

9. Also at the First Session, it was agreed pursuant to ICSID Rule 41(4) that the
Respondent’s first objection to jurisdiction (that Turkmenistan did not consent to ICSID
jurisdiction) would be considered as a preliminary matter on an accelerated schedule, while the
Respondent’s second objection to jurisdiction (that most of the claims brought by the Claimant
are contractual in nature) would be considered together with the merits of the dispute, if the
Tribunal were to reach the merits. Pursuant to the schedule established at the First Session and
incorporated into Procedural Order No. 1,° the Respondent submitted its Memorial on the
Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent (“Respondent’s Memorial”) on November 30,
2012. The Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of
Consent (“Claimant’s Counter-Memorial”) on January 11, 2013. And the Respondent submitted
its Reply on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent (“Respondent’s Reply”) on
February 22, 2013. The Claimant waived its right to submit a rejoinder in the interest of

compressing the schedule.®

Respondent’s Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent under advisement.

10 That transcript is cited in this Decision as “Hearing Tr. _.”

12. This Decision on the Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent (the
“Decision”) sets forth an analysis of the issues presented by the Respondent’s first objection to
jurisdiction and the reasons for which a majority of the members of the Tribunal ultimately
rejects that objection and concludes that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this dispute.
Professor Boisson de Chazournes disagrees with the analysis set forth in this Decision and with
the conclusions reached by the majority, for reasons explained in her Dissenting Opinion (the

“Dissenting Opinion”).

Il. ANALYSIS

A. The Objection to Jurisdiction for Lack of Consent

13. The parties’ respective positions as to whether Turkmenistan has consented to
participate in an arbitration conducted under the ICSID Rules (“ICSID Arbitration”) for the
purpose of resolving the claims advanced against it by the Claimant may be summarized very
simply at the outset. The arguments advanced by each party in support of its position are more
complex, and will be considered in the body of this Decision.

14. The Respondent’s first objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, which is the

1

only one to be addressed in this Decision,! may be stated in the most summary form as

follows:
e Turkmenistan has not consented or agreed, in the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT or otherwise,

to participate with this Claimant in an ICSID Arbitration.

'| The Respondent's second objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal was expressly reserved. Respondent’s

Memorial, {{[1, 72.

12 See Respondent’s Memorial, {{{6-7-

e Rather, the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT contains Turkmenistan’s consent only to participate
in international arbitration under the Rules (“UNCITRAL Rules’) of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (“UNCITRAL” and “UNCITRAL Arbitration”),
unless Turkmenistan agrees with a claimant to refer a specific claim to ICSID
Arbitration, which it has not done in this case.!?

e Turkmenistan’s consent to submit this dispute to ICSID Arbitration may not be created
by operation of the most favored nation (“MFN”’) clause of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

e This ICSID Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims.

15. The Claimant’s argument that this Tribunal does have jurisdiction may be stated

in equally summary form as follows: 4

e The MEN clause of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT assures the Claimant of treatment no less
favorable than Turkmenistan accords to nationals or companies of any third State.

e Turkmenistan has consented, in its BITs with Switzerland, France, Turkey, and India, and
in the Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”), to either ICSID Arbitration or UNCITRAL
Arbitration, at the election of the investor, with nationals or companies of those States.

e A treaty that consents to ICSID Arbitration is more favorable to an investor than one that
does not, or, alternatively, a treaty that provides a choice between UNCITRAL
Arbitration and ICSID Arbitration is more favorable to an investor than one that does not.

e Therefore, Turkmenistan’s consent to ICSID Arbitration is established by operation of

the MEN clause of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

The U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT provides for the application of the UNCITRAL Rules “as then in force.” BIT, Art.
8(2). The current UNCITRAL Rules came into effect on August 15, 2010, after the date of the Claimant’s
notification of the dispute to Turkmenistan, but before the date of the Request for Arbitration.

See Claimant’s Counter-Memorial, (2-3.

B. The U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT

16. The starting point for deciding whether this ICSID Tribunal has jurisdiction to
hear the dispute between the Claimant and the Respondent is the text of the BIT under which the
claim is brought. As the tribunal in Daimler v. Argentina explained:

BITs constitute an exercise of sovereignty by which States strike a delicate
balance among their various internal policy considerations. For this
reason, the Tribunal must take care not to allow any presuppositions
concerning the types of international law mechanisms (including dispute
resolution clauses) that may best protect and promote investment to carry
it beyond the bounds of the framework agreed upon by the contracting
state parties. It is for States to decide how best to protect and promote
investment. The texts of the treaties they conclude are the definitive guide
as to how they have chosen to do so.!5

17. Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT deals with “Settlement of Disputes
between an Investor and a Host State.” It provides:

qd) Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party
and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter
under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which
have not been amicably settled shall, after a period of four [months] from
written notification of a claim, be submitted to international arbitration if
the national or company concerned so wishes.'®

(2) Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration, the
national or company and the Contracting Party concerned in the dispute
may agree to refer the dispute either to:

(a) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(having regard to the provisions, where applicable, of the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between

Daimler Financial Services AG v. Argentine Republic, \CSID Case No. ARB/05/1, Award of August 22, 2012
(hereinafter “Daimler v. Argentina”) 164.
The bracketed word “[months]” does not appear in the text of Article 8(1) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT
published by the United Kingdom in its Treaty Series No. 47 (2003), which was submitted by the Claimant
(with its Request for Arbitration) and also by the Respondent (with its Memorial on Jurisdiction) as Exhibits C-
4, and R-4, respectively, and used by both parties. The Tribunal has supplied the word, because the text makes
no e without it and it appears to have been inadvertently omitted. The context in which Article 8(1) appears
also supports that reading, because of the appearance of the phrase “four months” in the final sentence of
Article 8(2). The signature page of the BIT states that it was done in the English and Russian languages, with a
text in the Turkmen language to be certified in due course, and that the English text would prevail in case of
divergence. No other version of the BIT was submitted by either party.

 

 

States and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at
Washington DC on 18 March 1965 and the Additional Facility for
the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding
Proceedings); or

(b) the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of
Commerce; or

(c) an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal to be
appointed by a special agreement or established under the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law.

Tf after a period of four months from written notification of the claim there
is no agreement to one of the above alternative procedures, the dispute
shall at the request in writing of the national or company concerned be
submitted to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations

19. Article 3 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT deals with “National Treatment and
Most-favoured-nation Provisions” and provides:

qd) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments
or returns of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to
treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or
returns of its own nationals or companies or to investments or returns of
nationals or companies of any third State.

(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment
less favourable than that which it accords to its own nationals or
companies or to nationals or companies of any third State.

(3) For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment

provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions
of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement.

20. It is common ground between the parties that the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT,
including Articles 3 and 8 of the BIT, is to be interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“Vienna Convention”). !® That is, the U.K.-

Turkmenistan BIT is to “be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to

be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”!”

Supplementary means of interpretation are to be resorted to only as permitted by Article 32 of
the Vienna Convention.
Cc. The Requirement of State Consent to Arbitration

21. “TQ]uestions concerning the consent of the parties to jurisdiction, in the context of

v2

a BIT arbitration, are generally governed by international law. ° Few propositions are as well

established in international law as that “a State may not be compelled to submit its disputes to

21

arbitration without its consent. The tribunal in Teinver v. Argentina called it a “fundamental

192:

requirement” that ‘‘a State Party consent to jurisdiction. > It is equally accepted that a State’s

consent is not to be presumed, but must be established by an express declaration or by actions
that demonstrate consent.”
22. Some arbitration tribunals have followed Plama v. Bulgaria in grafting onto the

requirement that the State must consent to arbitration the corollary that the State’s consent must

be “clear and unambiguous.” This Tribunal finds no basis in the Vienna Convention for
imposing such a standard onto the interpretation of the terms of a treaty.?° Rather, this Tribunal
agrees with the tribunal in Suez and Interagua v. Argentina “that dispute resolution provisions

are subject to interpretation like any other provisions of a treaty, neither more restrictive nor

more liberal.””°

23. Judge Higgins explained in the Oil Platforms Case:

It is clear from the jurisprudence of the Permanent Court and of the
International Court that there is no rule that requires a restrictive
interpretation of compromissory clauses... The Court has no judicial
policy of being either liberal or strict in deciding the scope of
compromissory clauses; they are judicial decisions like any other.7”

The same point was made by the tribunal in National Grid v. Argentina:

As regards the intention of the parties, the approach of the Vienna
Convention and the ICJ is that “what matters is the intention of the parties
as expressed in the text, which is the best guide to the more recent
common intention of the parties.” The convention does not establish a
different rule of interpretation for different clauses. The same rule of

interpretation applies to all provisions of a treaty, be they dispute
resolution clauses or MEN clauses. **

The tribunal in Austrian Airlines v. Slovakia agreed:

[T]he Tribunal does not consider that provisions that embody a State’s
consent to arbitration must be strictly interpreted. This view, which was
adopted by the tribunals in Plama v. Bulgaria, Telenor v. Hungary,
Bershader v. Russia and Wintershall v. Argentina, is not an accurate
reflection of international law on this matter.”

D. Has Turkmenistan Consented to Arbitration?

24. We confront in this case the question whether Turkmenistan has consented to
participate in ICSID Arbitration with the Claimant. Under the ICSID Convention, to which
specific reference is made in Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, a consent to ICSID
Arbitration must be expressed in writing:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State * * * and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute
consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given
their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*”

But neither the ICSID Convention nor any other authority of which this Tribunal is aware
requires that the State’s consent to arbitration be expressed in a particular form or in a single
article, or even in a single instrument or treaty.*!

25. In examining the text and structure of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, the majority of

the Tribunal approaches the question of whether Turkmenistan has consented to participate in

ICSID Arbitration in two steps, corresponding to the organization of the relevant article of the
U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, Article 8. Because Article 8(1) deals with Turkmenistan’s consent to
participate in international arbitration with U.K. investors and the conditions attached to that
consent, and Article 8(2) deals with the arbitration systems that may be used if the conditions of
Article 8(1) are met, we look first at whether Turkmenistan has consented to participate in
international arbitration at all, and second at whether it has agreed to ICSID Arbitration.

26. The answer to whether Turkmenistan has consented to participate in any kind of
arbitration with a U.K. claimant such as Garanti Koza may be found in Article 8(1) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT. Article 8(1) provides:

Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this
Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which have not been
amicably settled shall, after a period of four [months] from written
notification of a claim, be submitted to international arbitration if the
national or company concerned so wishes. 2

27. In Article 8(1), Turkmenistan consents to participate in international arbitration to
resolve disputes with U.K. investors, subject only to three conditions, all of which are met in this
case:

a. The first condition is that the investor “so wishes.” It is uncontested that the investor in
this case wishes to submit its claim to international arbitration.

b. The second condition is that the dispute shall not have been settled within four months of
written notification of the claim. It is also uncontested that the Claimant’s claim was not
settled within four months of written notification of the claim to Turkmenistan.

c. The third condition is that the dispute must concern an obligation of Turkmenistan under

the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. The Respondent has advised the Tribunal that it will argue,

°2U,K.-TURKMENISTAN BIT Art. 8(1) (emphasis added).

if this arbitration reaches the merits, that most of the Claimant’s claims are contractual in

nature, and therefore do not arise under the BIT.** For purposes of determining whether

we have jurisdiction to hear the claims, however, we accept (for this purpose only) the

Claimant’s pleading that its claims arise under the BIT, because the question of whether

the Claimant has actually stated a claim under the BIT has been reserved for the merits

phase of the proceeding. M

28. Article 8(1) provides that a claim that meets the three conditions specified in that
article “shall... be submitted to international arbitration.”*° The use of the auxiliary verb “shall”
makes that statement mandatory. As the tribunal in Wintershall v. Argentina put it, “[t]he use of
the word ‘shall’ [...] is itself indicative of an ‘obligation’ — not simply a choice or option. The
word ‘shall’ in treaty terminology means that what is provided for is legally binding.”*°

29. Article 8(1) thus appears to a majority of the Tribunal to establish unequivocally
Turkmenistan’s consent to submit disputes with U.K. investors to international arbitration. That
consent satisfies the fundamental condition that the State must have consented to participate in
arbitration before it may be required to do so. What Professor Stern calls the ratione voluntatis
is thus established with regard to Turkmenistan’s participation in international arbitration with a
U.K. investor.*” Turkmenistan has consented to arbitrate disputes with U.K. investors arising out
of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

30. Article 8(1) does not, however, tell us whether Turkmenistan has agreed to

participate in ICSID Arbitration with a U.K. investor, because Article 8(1) contains no

information about what kind of international arbitration Turkmenistan has consented to engage
in. As the particular BIT before us is structured, the State Parties’ consent to participate in
international arbitration is expressed in the first section of Article 8, while the type of arbitration
to which a dispute may be referred is dealt with in the second section of Article 8. To find what
kind of arbitration an investor may avail itself of, we must look at Article 8(2).
E. What Kind of Arbitration?

31. While the Dissenting Opinion finds that “[c]onsent to arbitration is specifically
dealt with in Article 8(2) when a foreign investor envisages having recourse to a specific

arbitration venue,”?®

in addition to Article 8(1), we find in Article 8(2) only a menu of options
concerning the arbitration process, and a default selection. Consent, as explained in the
preceding section, is granted in Article 8(1) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. Article 8(2) begins
“Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration,” indicating that Article 8(2) only
comes into play after the determination has been made, under the provisions of Article 8(1), to
refer the dispute to arbitration.

32. Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT (quoted in full in paragraph 17, above)
addresses specifically the kinds of arbitration available to a U.K. investor who wishes to take
advantage of the offer of international arbitration made by Turkmenistan in Article 8(1). It does
so in two steps. The first part of Article 8(2) identifies three types of arbitration to which an
investor with a claim and Turkmenistan together “may agree to refer the dispute” (emphasis
added). These are:

(a) ICSID Arbitration;

(b) Arbitration under the auspices of the Court of Arbitration of the International

Chamber of Commerce (“ICC Arbitration”); or

Dissenting Opinion 422.

(c) UNCITRAL Arbitration.

33. The second part of Article 8(2) provides that, if “there is no agreement to one of
the above alternative procedures” after four months, “the dispute shall at the request in writing of
the [investor] be submitted to arbitration under” the UNCITRAL Rules.”

34. The Respondent argues that Article 8(2) is modeled on the “alternative” version
of Article 8 of the 1991 U.K. Model BIT, which was in effect when the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT
was signed in 1995.*° The “preferred” version of Article 8 in the U.K. Model BIT, in contrast,
provided that “[e]ach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre for
the Settlement of Investment Disputes” any legal dispute with an investor of the other party.*!
The Respondent argues that the selection of the alternative version, rather than the preferred
version, reflects a choice by the parties to the BIT not to agree to ICSID Arbitration.”

35. The Claimant counters that the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT does not exclude ICSID
Arbitration, either in the text of Article 8 or in the exclusions from the scope of the MFN clause
listed in Article 7. Indeed, the Claimant argues, Article 8 identifies ICSID Arbitration as one
possible alternative that may under certain conditions be available to investors.“*

36. If the Tribunal found Article 8(2) to be ambiguous or obscure, Article 32 of the
Vienna Convention would permit us to consider supplementary means of interpretation, and the
model BIT from which the parties evidently derived the text of Article 8(2) would be among the

“circumstances of [the] conclusion” of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT that could be considered in

U.K.-TURKMENISTAN BIT Art. 8(2) (emphasis added).

interpreting that article.* But the Tribunal finds no ambiguity in Article 8(2). The ordinary
meaning of the words of that article is that Turkmenistan expressed in the BIT its willingness to
consider three possible kinds of arbitration whenever it was notified by a U.K. investor of a
claim under the BIT -- ICSID Arbitration, ICC Arbitration, and UNCITRAL Arbitration. Article
8(2) is equally clear that the fall-back option, failing a case-specific agreement to use one of the
first two kinds of arbitration, is UNCITRAL Arbitration. Vattel’s First Maxim (“It is not
allowable to interpret what has no need of interpretation”) counsels that we accept that these
words mean what they say.*©

37. The ordinary meaning of Article 8 is thus that Turkmenistan consented in Article
8(1) to submit disputes with a U.K. investor arising under the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT to
international arbitration. However, unless Turkmenistan reaches an agreement with such an
investor to submit a particular dispute to either ICSID or ICC arbitration, Article 8(2) restricts

7

the investor to submitting the dispute to UNCITRAL arbitration.*” On the latter point, the

majority agrees with the Dissenting Opinion, although we reach that conclusion by a different
route.
38. Within the four corners of Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, therefore, the

majority of the Tribunal finds that Turkmenistan has consented to international arbitration with

VIENNA CONVENTION Art. 32.

Emer Vattel, The Law of Nations (1758; Liberty Fund edition 2008) §263. Of course, Article 32 of the Vienna
Convention would allow the model BIT to be used for the purpose of confirming the ordinary meaning of these
words.

The tribunal in Biwater reached a similar conclusion interpreting a similarly-phrased treaty provision. Biwater
Gauff (Tanzania) Ltd. v. United Republic of Tanzania, ICSID Case No. ARB/05/22, Award of July 24, 2008
(hereinafter “Biwater v. Tanzania”) 1331. The Biwater tribunal relied in part on the statement of Dolzer &
Stevens that:

 

 

required

U.K. investors, but not to ICSID Arbitration. Turkmenistan has simply expressed its willingness
to consider ICSID arbitration as one of three options, and only on a case by case basis. The
Respondent states that the Claimant “never obtained or even sought Turkmenistan’s agreement

748 and the Claimant

to refer [this] dispute to ICSID arbitration, as required under Article 8(2),
does not take issue with that statement.”

39. Nevertheless, Article 8 may not be interpreted in isolation from the other
provisions of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, because the BIT must be read as a whole. The
Claimant rests its argument that this ICSID Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear this arbitration
squarely on the proposition that Turkmenistan has consented to ICSID Arbitration of disputes
with investors of third states, specifically investors of Switzerland, France, Turkey, and India in
Turkmenistan’s BITs with those states, and in the ECT, to which Turkmenistan is a party. » The
Claimant argues that it is entitled “to import the more favourable dispute resolution provisions”
of those treaties into the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT by operation of the MEN clause in Article 3 of
the BIT, because Turkmenistan’s consent to ICSID Arbitration with Swiss, French, Turkish, and
Indian investors, and in the ECT, provides more favorable treatment to those investors and to
claimants under the ECT than Article 8 provides to U.K. investors.°! We therefore turn to

Article 3 of the BIT and whether it may be used for that purpose.

Respondent’s Memorial, 4.

The Respondent also notes that the Claimant sent a letter to ICSID, after the ICSID Secretariat raised questions
about the request for arbitration and before the Secretariat had registered that request, in which the Claimant
asked the Secretary General “to ask the Respondent Turkmenistan to confirm its consent to the arbitration
proceedings to be held before ICSID.” Respondent’s Memorial, 129.

F. The Most Favored Nation Clause
1. MEN Clauses and Arbitration Provisions

40. This Tribunal is well aware that, in embarking on the consideration of whether the
MEN clause of a BIT may be used to vary the terms of the investor-state arbitration article of the
same BIT, we are venturing into a fiercely contested no-man’s land in international law. The
issues of textual interpretation, legal theory, and public policy that this question presents have
been ably and exhaustively explored by more than twenty tribunals, and have been expounded in
decisions and dissents authored by some of the most eminent authorities on international law and
investment arbitration.

Al. By this Tribunal’s count, there is a fairly even split between the number of

tribunals that have applied the MFN clause of a BIT to vary its dispute resolution provisions,”

54

and the number that have declined to do so.°” We recognize that decisions of other arbitral

tribunals, interpreting other BITs, have no binding authority on this Tribunal. But we have found
the analysis in many of these awards helpful in framing the question before us, and indeed both
parties have relied on these decisions in making their arguments. And the fact that so many
arbitrators with such a collective wealth of experience in international law and investment
arbitration have been unable to reach a consensus on the subject certainly counsels caution in
approaching it.>
42. Fortunately, perhaps, the present case does not require this Tribunal to take a

position on the policy issues implicated in deciding whether an MEN clause ought to be applied
to the investor-state arbitration article of a BIT. As Dolzer and Schreuer have observed, “much
will depend on the wording of the particular MFN clause.”*° In the BIT before us, we find the
answer to whether the MFN clause (Article 3) should be applied to the investor-state arbitration
article (Article 8) in the specific language of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. That
article reads:

(3) For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment

provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions

of Articles 1 to 11 of this Agreement.””
Article 8 of the BIT, of course, is among “the provisions of Articles 1 to 11” to which Article
3(3) states that the MEN provisions of Articles 3(1) and 3(2) shall apply. As noted above (28),
the use of the word “shall” makes that statement mandatory.

43. Both parties agree that Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT has its origin in

the 1991 U.K. Model BIT.* Both parties also agree that, of the more than twenty tribunals to

have considered the effect of an MEN clause on the investor-state arbitration article of a BIT,
this Tribunal is the first to be called upon to interpret an MFN clause containing the language of
Article 3(3).?

44. The language of the U.K. Model BIT adopted in Article 3(3) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT has not escaped previous attention, however. It has been held up for
comparison by arbitrators faced with different wording in other BITs as an example of how State
parties to a BIT could make it clear that the MFN clause applies to the investor-state arbitration
provision, if they chose to do so. For example, the Plama v. Bulgaria tribunal stated:

Rather, the intention to incorporate dispute settlement provisions must be
clearly and unambiguously expressed. This is, for example, the case with
the U.K. Model BIT, which provides in its Article 3(3):

For avoidance of doubt, it is confirmed that the treatment

provided for in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to

the provisions of Articles I to 11 of this Agreement.
Articles 8 and 9 of the U.K. Model BIT provide for dispute settlement.
The drafters of the U.K. Model BIT rightly noted that there could be doubt
and expressly neutralized that doubt.”

45. Professor Stern, in her thorough exposition of “why, in principle, an MFN clause
cannot import, in part or in toto, a dispute settlement mechanism from a third party BIT into the
BIT which is the basic treaty applicable to the dispute,” explicitly carved out of her discussion
treaties with the language found in Article 3(3) of the U.K. Model BIT:

Naturally, an important caveat has to be presented here. The

interpretation of the MFN clause is only necessary when the intention of
the parties concerning its applicability or inapplicability to the dispute

settlement mechanism is not expressly stated or clearly ascertained. It is
quite evident that if there is an MEN clause expressly including the dispute
settlement procedures or expressly excluding them, there is no need for an
interpretation.

There are indeed cases where the parties expressly state that the MFN
clause applies to the dispute settlement mechanism. This has been done,
for example, by the drafters of the U.K. Model BIT, who have provided in
Article 3(3) that “for avoidance of doubt” MEN treatment shall apply to
certain specified provisions of the BIT including the dispute settlement
provision.°!

46. The Respondent points out that neither the Plama v. Bulgaria tribunal, nor
Professor Stern in the dissent discussed above, was called upon to consider the implications of
the parties to a BIT having selected the alternative version of Article 8 of the U.K. Model BIT in
preference to the preferred version of that article. The selection of the alternative version,
rather than the preferred version, is indeed suggestive of a reluctance to agree in advance to
ICSID Arbitration. But as we have already stated, we do not find the meaning of Article 8 of the
U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT to be uncertain, and the choice of one version of Article 8 in preference
to another does not appear to us to provide any sound basis for failing to apply Article 3(3).

2. Does an MEN Clause Create Rights?

47. The Respondent argues that rights which do not exist under the basic treaty
cannot be created by operation of an MFN clause, but that MFN clauses are rather designed only
to improve the implementation of rights already granted under the basic treaty through “the
importation of more favourable conditions of exercise of such rights.”

48. The Claimant argues that the use of an MFN clause to establish the State’s

consent to ICSID Arbitration is simply a particular example of using an MFN clause to import

Respondent’s Reply, (21.

into a treaty a right that the treaty does not otherwise provide. The Claimant quotes Professor

Schreuer to this effect:
The argument that the MFN clause is inapplicable in cases where the basic
treaty limits or refrains from granting consent, since the parties’ intention
in that respect is clear, is not convincing. An MFN clause is not a rule of
interpretation that comes into play only where the wording of the basic
treaty leaves room for doubt. It is intended to endow its beneficiary with
rights that are additional to the rights contained in the basic treaty. The
meaning of an MFN clause is that whoever is entitled to rely on it be
granted rights accruing from a third party treaty even if these rights clearly
go beyond the basic treaty.

49. The majority of the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to try to resolve whether rights
may be created by an MFN clause, although Professor Schreuer is persuasive and other tribunals
have had no difficulty in extending rights via an MFN. clause.™ First, to the extent that access to
international arbitration may be considered a “right” of a complaining investor, such access is
already accorded to U.K. investors under Article 8(1) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, so there is
no need to resort to the MEN clause to create it. Second, the MFN clause of the particular BIT
before us frames the question in terms of “treatment,” not of “rights.” We are therefore
concerned only with whether Turkmenistan has accorded to investors of third states, or their
investments, treatment more favorable than it accords to U.K. investors or their investments.

3. General vs. Specific Language
50. The Respondent argues that the MFN clause of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT

should not be applied to Article 8, because the “general” language of Article 3(3) to the effect

that paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article 3 “shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11” should

give way to the more “specific” language of Article 8 about the availability only of UNCITRAL
Arbitration unless there is a case-specific agreement to a different form of arbitration.”

51. That the MFN clause is broadly worded, while the dispute resolution clause is by
comparison specific, does not appear to the majority of this Tribunal to bar the application of one
to the other. It is in the nature of MFN clauses to be general, because such clauses are intended
to apply to a variety of provisions of numerous treaties that may be more or less favorable to the
person or entity protected by the MFN clause than the corresponding clause of the base treaty.
Indeed, Article 3(3) states that the MFN clauses of the BIT are to be applied to eleven articles of
that treaty, each of which might be compared with similar provisions in other BITs entered into
by the U.K. or Turkmenistan, some of which did not exist at the time the U.K. -Turkmenistan
BIT was entered into. As the UNCTAD paper on Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment observes,
“t]he treatment refers to all measures applying specifically to foreign investors (investment-
specific measures) or to measures of general application that regulate the economic and business
activity of the investor and his investment throughout the duration of the investment.”® In the
words of the Siemens v. Argentina tribunal, “In fact, the purpose of the MFN clause is to
eliminate the effect of specially negotiated provisions unless they have been excepted.”

4, Effet Utile
52. Nor is the majority of the Tribunal convinced by the Respondent’s argument that

application of the MEN clause to the dispute resolution provision of the BIT would deprive the

Siemens v. Argentina (106. See RosInvestCo v. Russia {131 (“While indeed the application of the MFN clause:
of Article 3 widens the scope of Article 8 and thus is in conflict to its limitation, this is a normal result of the

latter of effet utile.” This would occur, the Respondent argues, because, when the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT was signed in 1995, the U.K. was already a party to other treaties that
provided for ICSID Arbitration. If the MFN clause can be used as the Claimant seeks to use it,
the Respondent argues, Article 8(2) would have been a nullity from inception, because the MFN
clause could always have displaced its provisions in favor of a clause from a treaty providing for
ICSID Arbitration.”

53. The Claimant responds that no Turkmenistan BIT had entered into force in 1995
other than the China-Turkmenistan BIT, which did not provide for ICSID Arbitration.” The
China BIT was Turkmenistan’s first to enter into force, and the U.K. BIT was Turkmenistan’s
second, according to UNCTAD’s list of BITs to which Turkmenistan is a party.” There was
thus no more favorable Turkmenistan treaty in force at the time the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT
became effective. The Respondent argues that some U.K. treaties that provided for ICSID
Arbitration did precede the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT: The U.K.-Barbados BIT entered into effect
in 1993, the U.K.-Peru BIT in 1994, the U.K.-Belarus BIT in 1994. The existence of those
treaties may have made the effect of Article 3(3) on the United Kingdom uncertain, but it had no
effect on the impact of that article on Turkmenistan. The Claimant also points out that, in any
event, an investor always has the right to avail itself of Article 8(2) if it is content with
UNCITRAL Atbitration.”*

54. In this connection, it seems significant to the majority of the Tribunal that it is in

the nature of an MFN clause to be used to displace a treaty provision deemed less favorable in

favor of another clause, from another treaty, deemed more favorable. The MEN clause itself
would be deprived of effet utile if it could never be used to override another provision of the
treaty. Certainly, the principle of ejusdem generis restricts the application of an MFN clause to
the displacement of clauses dealing with the same subject matter in other treaties of the same
nature.”° But that principle is not offended by the use of an MEN clause to displace a provision
from the dispute resolution article of one bilateral investment treaty with a corresponding

provision from the dispute resolution article of another bilateral investment treaty signed by the

same State.
5. Contemporaneity
55. The Respondent argues that the principle of “contemporaneity” prevents

application of the MEN clause to the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT.” That principle,
the Respondent argues, requires the Tribunal to look at the situation of the State parties at the
time the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT was executed, in 1995, and to determine whether the State
parties could have contemplated “even the possibility of importing consent via an MEN clause
from another treaty.””* Prior to the Maffezini v. Spain decision in 2000, the Respondent argues,
such an idea was “utterly unheard of.”

56. The Claimant responds that, where the words of a treaty are not ambiguous, there
is no occasion under the Vienna Convention to look beyond the terms of the treaty to discern the

intentions of the parties. To the extent that contemporaneity is relevant, the Claimant adds, the

Bahrain-Turkmenistan BIT, signed in 2011, contains an MFN clause that applies broadly to the

dispute resolution provision, *° so there is no reason to believe that Maffezini v. Spain and the
intervening decisions following Maffezini v. Spain had any effect on Turkmenistan’s treaty
practice.*!

57. The majority of the Tribunal concludes that the principle of contemporaneity does
not bar the application of Article 3 to Article 8. The best indication of the intentions of the State
parties to the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT is the text of the treaty they signed. Article 3(3) provides
unequivocally that Article 3 “shall apply” to Article 8. Whatever the authors of the text may
have foreseen, their intentions, as expressed in the text of the treaty, seem to this Tribunal to be
clear.*?

6. Interpretation of Article 3(3)

58. The wording of Article 3(3) indisputably presents some interpretive difficulties.
For example, Article 7 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, headed “Exceptions,” carves out of the
MEN treatment provided by the BIT the benefits that may be provided by any existing or future

83 Yet Article 7 is one of the articles included in

customs union or taxation treaty or legislation.
“Articles 1 to 11,” to which the MEN clause is made applicable by Article 3(3). It would be
challenging to apply a guarantee of most favored nation treatment to an article enumerating the
exceptions to most favored nation treatment, but fortunately this Tribunal is not called upon to do
so. While recognizing the difficulty of applying Article 3 to all of the first eleven articles of the
BIT, we are confronted in this case only with how to apply it to Article 8.

59. Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT states that the treatment provided for

in Articles 3(1) and 3(2) shall apply to a range of articles that includes Article 8. The treatment

specifically excepted, [MFN] treatment provided for in
is Agreement.”

 

 

provided for in Articles 3(1) and 3(2) includes most favored nation treatment. As noted above
({ 28), the words “shall apply” appear to the majority of this Tribunal to be intended to require
the application of the one to the other, not merely to permit it. These terms of the BIT, like all
terms of a treaty, are to be given effect.

60. The Dissenting Opinion reads into the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT two conditions
that neither side has advanced and that the majority of the Tribunal is unable to find in the text of
the treaty. First, the Dissenting Opinion would require Articles 3 and 8 of the BIT to be applied
in a particular sequence. As the Dissenting Opinion sees it, “to give effect to the MFN clause
contained in Article 3(3), the foreign investor must first be in a dispute settlement relationship
with the host state.”** Under this reasoning, an investor’s right to MFN treatment under Article
3 does not come into being until the investor has commenced an arbitration proceeding under
Article 8. It necessarily follows, if that is the case, that an investor cannot commence an ICSID
Arbitration or an ICC Arbitration unless the state has specifically agreed to do so. The second
condition that the Dissenting Opinion reads into the BIT follows logically from the first: “[i]n
that sense, the application of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT is subordinated or
conditioned to the prior application of Article 8(2) [8

6l. The majority of the Tribunal finds no basis in the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT for
conditioning the rights enjoyed by an investor under the BIT on the temporal sequence in which
the investor asserts those rights. A U.K. investor with an investment in Turkmenistan enjoys
rights under the BIT simply by virtue of having made that investment.*° No action on the
investor’s part other than the making of the investment is required to vest the investor with those

rights. And the protection of the MEN clause applies to such an investor from the moment that

§ Dissenting Opinion {40 (emphasis in original).

Id. 941.

the host State accords more favorable treatment to an investor from a third state. As the
International Law Commission puts it:
The right of the beneficiary State, for itself or for the benefit of persons or
things in a determined relationship with it, to most-favoured-nation
treatment under a most-favoured-nation clause * * * arises at the moment
when the relevant treatment is extended by the granting State to a third
state or to persons or things in the same relationship with that third State.*”
Dolzer and Schreuer explain:
“The [MEN] clause may not have any practical significance if the state
concerned fails to grant any relevant benefit to a third party. However, as
soon as the state does confer a relevant benefit, it is automatically
extended to the state that benefits from the MEN clause.”**

62. The protection of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT includes the access to international
arbitration to which the sovereign parties consented in Article 8(1), and also the right to
treatment no less favorable than that accorded to nationals of third countries provided by Article
3. Nothing in the text of the treaty requires an investor to commence an arbitration before
claiming its rights under the MEN clause, or subordinates the MEN clause to the investor-state
arbitration provision. To the contrary, the BIT provides that the MFN clause “shall apply” to the
investor-state arbitration article. The majority of the Tribunal therefore concludes that nothing in
the BIT prevents an investor from simultaneously invoking the right to international arbitration

provided by the BIT and invoking the MFN clause to obtain the benefit of a more favorable

arbitration process provided by another treaty to nationals or companies of a third country.

63. All of the words of a treaty are to be interpreted together, in good faith and in the
context of the object and purpose of the treaty.*” The object and purpose of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT, as expressed in its preamble, is “to create favourable conditions for greater

investment.””°

Assuring a prospective investor that neither he nor his investment will be
subjected to treatment less favorable than the treatment accorded to investors from third
countries and their investments, insofar as the process available to resolve any disputes with the
host country that may arise under the BIT is concerned, certainly seems to create a favorable
condition for investment by the investor so protected. The RosInvestCo v. Russsia tribunal
explained that “the submission to arbitration forms a highly relevant part of the corresponding
protection for the investor by granting him, in case of interference with his ‘use’ and
‘enjoyment,’ procedural options of obvious and great significance.””! As the Hochtief v.
Argentina tribunal observed, “the right to enforcement is an essential component of [the]
property rights.”°?

64. The majority of this Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the ordinary meaning of
the words of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, read in light of the object and purpose
of the BIT, requires that the MFN clause be applied to Article 8, the investor-state arbitration
provision. We turn next to what consequences follow from so applying those terms, or, as the

Respondent phrases it, “how Article 8 and Article 3 work together.”*

G. Application of the MFN Clause to the Arbitration Article

65. Article 3 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT contains two most-favored-nation
protections, one applicable to nationals or companies of the other contracting party, and one
applicable to the investments of such nationals or companies:

e Article 3(1) of the BIT contains Turkmenistan’s undertaking not to “subject investments
or returns of nationals or companies of the [U.K.] to treatment less favourable than that
which it accords * * * to investments or returns of nationals or companies of any third
state;” and

e Article 3(2) of the BIT contains Turkmenistan’s undertaking not to “subject nationals or
companies of the [U.K.], as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of their investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords * * *
to nationals or companies of any third state.”

66. The Claimant invokes the protection of both Article 3(1) and Article 3(2).°4
While the Claimant asks the Tribunal to apply those MEN clauses to give it the benefit of the
dispute resolution clauses of Turkmenistan’s BITs with Switzerland, France, Turkey, and India,
and the ECT, the Claimant focuses on the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT. 95 Following the
Claimant’s example, the Tribunal will therefore focus on the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT as

containing the provisions that the Claimant deems more favorable. °® Our resolution of the issue

See Claimant's Counter-Memorial, 59. The Switzerland, France, and Turkey BITs with Turkmenistan all

Claimant seeks to rely upon them, are substantially identical. Compare Accord entre le Conseil federal suisse et

before us on the basis of the provisions of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT makes examination
of the other treaties relied upon by the Claimant unnecessary.

67. The discussion in the preceding section of this Decision explains the conclusion
of the majority of the Tribunal that Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT requires the
Tribunal to apply Articles 3(1) and 3(2) of the BIT to Article 8. Two questions nevertheless
remain:

e First, is there something different about the selection of a particular system of arbitration
and the rules that accompany it, as opposed to the interposition of a condition, such as a
waiting period, that permits the application of an MEN clause to the latter, but not to the
former?

e And, second, do the provisions of Article 8 of the BIT provide “less favourable”
treatment to U.K. investors (as regards their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment
or disposal of their investments), or to their investments, than the corresponding articles
of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT provide to Swiss investors, or their investments?

1. May Consent to ICSID Arbitration Be Provided Via an MFN Clause?

68. The provision of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT on which the Claimant relies
is Article 8 of that treaty, which provides:

1. For the purpose of solving disputes with respect to investments
between a Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, consultations will take place between the parties
concerned.

2. If these consultations do not result in a solution within six months

from the date of request for consultations, the investor may submit
the dispute for settlement to:

(Footnote continued from previous page)
(entry into force: March 13, 1997), Exhibit CL-25. Turkmenistan’s BIT with India and the ECT contain more

complex provisions.

(a) the International Centre for Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) provided for by the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of other States, opened for signature at
Washington, on March 18, 1965; or

b) an ad hoc-arbitral tribunal which, unless otherwise agreed
upon by the parties to the dispute, shall be established
under the arbitration rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

3. Each Contracting Party hereby consents to the submission of an
investment dispute to conciliation or international arbitration.”

69. Specifically, the Claimant seeks to apply the MEN provisions of Articles 3(1) and
3(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT to give it the benefit of what it considers to be the more
favorable treatment accorded by Turkmenistan to Swiss investors in Article 8(2) of the
Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT, insofar as a Swiss investor may choose to submit a dispute that
cannot be resolved within six months of consultations with Turkmenistan either to ICSID
Arbitration or to UNCITRAL Arbitration. As the Dissenting Opinion puts it, “because of the
MEN provision contained in Article 3 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT and its application to

dispute settlement issues, a foreign investor of British nationality can invoke more favourable

dispute settlement provisions embodied in other BITs concluded by Turkmenistan.”

reads: “(1) Afin de trouver une solution aux différends relatifs a des investissements entre une Partie

Dissenting Opinion 438.

 
  

70. The Respondent argues that, while an MFN clause may possibly be used to
overcome a qualifying condition, such as a waiting period, in the dispute resolution clause of a
BIT, as was the case in Maffezini v. Spain, it may not be used to “import” the State’s “consent to
a different arbitration system” from one treaty into another.” The Respondent cites statements
from both Maffezini v. Spain and Plama v. Bulgaria to this effect:

[I]f the agreement provides for a particular arbitration forum, such as
ICSID, for example, this option cannot be changed by invoking the [MFN]
clause in order to refer the dispute to a different system of arbitration . . .
because these very specific provisions reflect the precise will of the
contracting parties. 00

It is also not evident that when parties have agreed in a particular BIT on a
specific dispute resolution mechanism, . . . their agreement to most
favored nation treatment means that they intended that, by operation of the
MEN clause, their specific agreement on such a dispute settlement
mechanism could be replaced by a totally different dispute resolution
mechanism (ICSID arbitration). It is one thing to add to the treatment
provided in one treaty more favorable treatment provided elsewhere. It is
quite another thing to replace a procedure specifically negotiated by
parties with an entirely different mechanism. tol

71. Indeed, the Respondent argues that, because no investor has previously tried to
use an MFN clause for that purpose, this Tribunal would be the first tribunal to do so if we were
to agree with the Claimant.'

72. The Claimant takes issue with the proposition that no tribunal has ever used an
MEN clause to import consent to ICSID Arbitration from one instrument to another by pointing

3

out that this is effectively what the tribunal did in C.S.O.B. v. Slovakia.’ In that case, The

Czech and Slovak Republics, prior to their separation, had signed a BIT that gave an investor of

one State the right to elect ICSID Arbitration of a dispute with the other State, but the Slovak
Republic argued that the BIT had never entered into force as between the State parties. !°* The
tribunal found that “the uncertainties relating to the entry into force of the BIT prevent that
instrument from providing a sound basis upon which to found the parties’ consent to ICSID

jurisdiction.” 105

However, the parties to the C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia arbitration had signed a
“Consolidation Agreement” which made reference to the BIT, and the tribunal found that:
In the absence of a separate dispute resolution provision, the reference to
the BIT satisfies the requirement that international arbitration, as specified
in its Article 8, is the agreed dispute resolution mechanism. 106
73. While the facts of C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia are unique, the majority of this Tribunal is
inclined to agree with the Claimant that importation of a provision for ICSID Arbitration from
one treaty to another by operation of the MEN clause of a treaty should not be considered
conceptually more difficult than the incorporation by reference into a contract of a provision for
ICSID Arbitration from a treaty that has not entered into force. In either case, the consent to
ICSID Arbitration is written in one instrument and imported into another by virtue of a provision
in the latter instrument to which the State has agreed. The State has expressed its consent to
ICSID Arbitration, in writing, in one instrument, and has agreed in a second instrument to look,
under certain conditions, to the terms of the first instrument. Whether looking to the terms of the
first instrument is accomplished by means of an incorporation by reference or an MFN clause
does not appear to be a material distinction.
74. The Dissenting Opinion finds C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia inapposite, because the
agreement containing the reference to the draft BIT in C.S.O.B. v. Slovakia was signed by both

parties to the arbitration, thus supplying a separate agreement to ICSID arbitration (by virtue of

104 C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia 4.
5 1d. 443.
16 1d. 454.

the incorporation by reference) between the host state and the claimant. We would agree with
this distinction, if the purpose of looking to the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT was to supply the
missing case-specific consent to submit this particular dispute to ICSID Arbitration required by
Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. But the MFN provision of the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT effectively replaces Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT with Article 8(2) of the
Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT, which requires no such case-specific consent. In the U.K. BIT,
the sovereign parties agreed that their respective investors would have the benefits of more
favorable provisions of other provisions in other treaties, and specified in Article 3(3) that the
investor-state provisions of the BIT were included within the ambit of this protection. Once the
requirements of Article 8(2) of the U.K. BIT are displaced by those of Article 8(2) of the
Switzerland BIT, it is sufficient that the investor have complied with the requirements of that
provision of the Switzerland BIT.

75. In any event, the essential consent of the State -- the consent to resolve disputes
with U.K. investors by means of international arbitration -- does not in this case need to be
imported by operation of the MEN clause, because that consent is contained in Article 8(1) of the
BIT. The consent of Switzerland and Turkmenistan to submit disputes between each of them
and investors of the other to international arbitration is similarly contained in a separate
paragraph of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT, Article 8(3) of that treaty. There is no need for
the Claimant to seek to import that consent into the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, because Article
8(1) of the U.K. BIT already achieves the same result.

76. The only provision of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT to which the Claimant
needs the MEN clause to apply is the provision of Article 8(2) of the Switzerland BIT that
provides a Swiss investor a choice between ICSID Arbitration and UNCITRAL Arbitration,

which the Claimant argues to be more favorable than the corresponding provision of Article 8(2)

of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, which restricts a U.K. investor to UNCITRAL Arbitration. Such
an application to Article 8(2) is consistent with the International Law Commission’s observation
that the beneficiary of an MFN clause not only has “an ‘either/or’ choice, but might also be in a
position to opt for the cumulative enjoyment of all, some, or parts of the various treatments
concerned.”!°”

77. The Respondent argues that Article 8(2) requires a specific agreement between
the Claimant and Turkmenistan to submit a dispute to ICSID Arbitration. Article 3, the
Respondent argues, is an agreement between Turkmenistan and the United Kingdom, and cannot

satisfy the requirement of an agreement between the Claimant and Turkmenistan. '°*

But, as
noted above, the effect of the MFN clause is not to satisfy the requirements of Article 8(2), but to
replace those requirements with a more favorable provision from another treaty, in this case
Article 8(2) of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT, which does not require a separate agreement
between the Claimant and Turkmenistan in order to commence an ICSID Arbitration. We adopt
the observation of the Renta 4 v. Russia tribunal that:

It is not convincing for a State to argue in general terms that it accepted a

particular “system of arbitration” with respect to nationals of one country

but did not so consent with respect to nationals of another. The extension

of commitments is in the very nature of MFN clauses.!”

78. The Dissenting Opinion asserts that “[i]t would involve a forum shopping

attitude,” “running against the fundamental principles of international adjudication,” to bypass
the consent requirement. !!° But the consent requirement is not bypassed by this interpretation:

Turkmenistan consented to international arbitration in Article 8(1) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan

BIT, and the State Parties to the BIT opened the door to a search by a U.K. investor for more

favorable terms in treaties entered into by Turkmenistan with other states by choosing to make
the MEN clause of the BIT applicable to the investor-state arbitration provisions. It is the State
Parties to the BIT, not the present Tribunal, that decided that the MFN clause should apply to the
investor-state arbitration article. As Professor Schreuer explains in the passage quoted above
(paragraph 48), the rights provided by MFN clauses are additional to the rights provided in the
basic BIT.'"!

79. The majority of the Tribunal concludes that, where Turkmenistan: (a) has
expressly consented in the basic U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT to submit investment disputes with
U.K. investors to international arbitration, (b) has provided in the same BIT that U.K. investors
and their investments will not be subjected to treatment less favorable than that accorded to
investors of other States or their investments, (c) has expressly provided that the MFN treatment
so accorded “shall apply” to the dispute resolution provision of the BIT, and (d) has provided
investors of third States, specifically Switzerland, with an unrestricted choice between ICSID
Arbitration and UNCITRAL Arbitration, there is no reason why Turkmenistan’s consent to
ICSID Arbitration in its BIT with Switzerland may not be relied upon by a U.K. investor, if the
provision for ICSID Arbitration or an unrestricted choice between ICSID Arbitration and
UNCITRAL Arbitration provides treatment more favorable to the investor than the treatment
provided by the base treaty.

2. Does the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT Provide Less Favorable Treatment than
the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT?

80. ‘We turn next to whether the treatment accorded by Turkmenistan to Swiss
investors and their investments is more favorable than the treatment accorded to U.K. investors

and their investments by the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT insofar as the type of arbitration made

"1 ©. Schreuer et al., The ICSID Convention — A Commentary, p. 248.

available is concerned. The Claimant describes “whether the treatment [the Claimant] seek[s] to
incorporate is more favorable than the treatment in the basic treaty” as “the only legitimate
question” that this Tribunal has to answer. m2

81. The dispute resolution provisions of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT differ in two
principal respects from those of the BIT between Turkmenistan and Switzerland:

e The U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT requires a waiting period of four months, while the

Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT requires a waiting period of six months.

e The U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT permits an investor making a claim to commence an
arbitration only under the UNCITRAL Rules, unless Turkmenistan agrees on a case-by-

case basis to ICSID or ICC arbitration, while the Switzerland BIT provides an investor a

free choice between ICSID Arbitration and UNCITRAL Arbitration.

82. Neither party has argued that the difference between the four-month waiting
period under the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT and the six-month waiting period under the
Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT has any significance. In any event, more than six months elapsed
between the Claimant’s Notification of its claim to Turkmenistan on June 25, 2010 and the filing
of its Request for Arbitration on May 19, 2011, so the Claimant has satisfied the waiting
requirement under either treaty.

83. The Claimant argues that Article 8 of the Switzerland-Turkmenistan BIT contains
“more favourable dispute resolution provisions than that found in” the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT,!? for two reasons:

(a) a treaty that provides the State’s consent to ICSID Arbitration is more favorable to an

investor than one that does not; M4

"2" Hearing Tr. 111.
"3" Claimant's Counter-Memorial, (58.

40

(b) and, in any event, a treaty that provides an investor the choice between ICSID

Arbitration and UNCITRAL Arbitration is more favorable to an investor than one that

provides no choice. |'°

84. The Respondent argues that, to prevail, the Claimant must establish that ICSID
Arbitration is objectively more favorable than UNCITRAL Arbitration, not merely that the
Claimant prefers it. "6 The Respondent also argues that no arbitral tribunal has ever reached the
conclusion urged by the Claimant. i

85. The Claimant disputes that there is any basis in international law for the

8

“objective” standard advocated by the Respondent.'! Rather, the Claimant argues that the

Tribunal should defer to the Claimant’s view that ICSID Arbitration is more favorable than
UNCITRAL Arbitration, because “we know what is best for us, especially if the tribunal thinks

that objectively it may be more difficult to assess whether one treatment is more favorable than

another.”!!°

86. Even if the Tribunal adopts an “objective” standard, the Claimant argues, it
should find that ICSID Arbitration is more favorable to investors than UNCITRAL Arbitration,
because (a) ICSID Arbitration is institutional arbitration, (b) ICSID is specialized in investor-
State disputes, (c) ICSID Arbitration is insulated from interference by courts at the seat of the

arbitration, (d) a decision in favor of jurisdiction may not be challenged until after the final

‘6 The Respondent relies on the UNCTAD MEN Paper and Daimler v. Argentina for the proposition that the
determination of whether one treaty provision is more or less favorable than another must derive “from an
objective appreciation of the text of the treaty,” and not “from the subjective perceptions of individual
claimants.” Hearing Tr. 70-71, quoting Daimler v. Argentina 9245-246. See Respondent's Memorial, 165;

award, (e) local courts are not involved in enforcement or review of ICSID awards, and (f) there

is no uncertainty about the seat of arbitration, as there is in UNCITRAL Arbitration. !7°

87. The Respondent, in arguing that ICSID Arbitration is not objectively more
favorable than UNCITRAL Arbitration, points to the risk of annulment of awards in ICSID

Arbitration and to the availability of the New York Convention to enforce UNCITRAL

1

awards.” Principally, however, the Respondent relies on studies by commentators who have

reviewed the features of each system and have concluded that neither system is inherently better
than the other. |?”

88. The UNCTAD MEN Paper defines the appropriate standard for applying an MFN
clause differently from the formulation put forward by either party, but in terms that this
Tribunal finds pertinent. “The MFN Treatment provision,” the UNCTAD MEN Paper states, “is
a relative standard, which means that it implies a comparative test.” MFN treatment, that paper
continues, “requires a comparison as well as the finding of more favourable treatment granted to
investors of a given nationality as opposed to the investors covered by the basic treaty.” But a

finding of an alleged breach “calls not only for the finding of an objective difference in treatment

120 Hearing Tr. 115-116.

21 Respondent's Reply, 76-81; Hearing Tr. 73. The Respondent informed the Tribunal that, of five currently
pending cases against Turkmenistan brought under BITs that provide the claimant with a choice between ICSID
Arbitration and UNCITRAL Arbitration, three were brought at ICSID and two under the UNCITRAL Rules.
Hearing Tr. 169. These figures would appear to weigh against describing either system as inherently and
objectively more favorable to an investor than the other.

between two foreign investors, but also for a competitive disadvantage directly stemming from
this difference in the treatment.”!”3

89. The Tribunal finds itself in agreement with the Respondent that ICSID Arbitration
cannot be described as objectively more favorable to investors than UNCITRAL Arbitration.
Each system has its advantages and disadvantages, as the comparisons made by both parties
illustrate. ICSID does indeed offer the advantages of administration by experienced
professionals on behalf of a specialized institution. It also offers the considerable advantage of
freedom from interference by courts at the seat of the arbitration, the perils of which are
illustrated by the recent decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia Circuit in The Republic of Argentina v. BG Group ple.'* But at least one learned
commentator has applauded the role of national courts “in annulment proceedings where indeed
they have come to provide, with few exceptions, a guarantee of stability and legal certainty not
always found in some recent decisions of ICSID annulment committees.”!?° ICSID Arbitration
has also been criticized for the overuse by unsuccessful parties of the annulment procedure
provided by Chapter VII of the ICSID Rules,'° and some parties favor the greater flexibility
offered by the UNCITRAL Rules.

more favorable to an investor than UNCITRAL Arbitration for all purposes, the Claimant’s

principal argument is that it is more favorable to have a choice between the two than not to have
achoice.'”” This argument finds support in the decisions of other tribunals.

91. In Impregilo v. Argentina, for example, the tribunal concluded, in the context of a
choice between resorting to domestic courts and international arbitration, that “a system that
gives a choice is more favorable to the investor than a system that gives no choice.”!8 The
Hochtief v. Argentina tribunal agreed: “whatever the substantive merits of litigation and of
arbitration, it is always more favourable to have the choice as to which to employ than it is not to
have that choice.”'” Similarly, the tribunal in Renta 4 v. Russia, while ultimately declining to
apply the MFN clause of the particular BIT before it to the arbitration clause, because of the
specific language of that treaty, stated that, “[h]aving options may be thought to be more
‘favoured’ for MFN purposes than not having them.”'° And in the specific context of a choice
between ICSID Arbitration and ad hoc arbitration (such as UNCITRAL Arbitration), the Plama
v. Bulgaria tribunal stated that, “[t]he Tribunal is inclined to agree with the Claimant that in this
particular case, a choice is better than no choice.” 7!

92. The Respondent characterizes the “choice” argument as bootstrapping, reasoning
that if one system is not objectively more favorable than the other, having a choice between the
systems cannot be more favorable than accepting the system selected in the base treaty.' As

noted above, the Tribunal agrees that neither ICSID Arbitration nor UNCITRAL Arbitration may

be described as objectively more favorable than the other. At the same time, however, those two
systems of arbitration are indisputably different from each other. 183

93. Article 3(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT contains Turkmenistan’s undertaking
not to subject U.K. companies, as regards their management, use, enjoyment, and disposal of
their investments in the territory of Turkmenistan, “to treatment less favourable” than it accords
to companies of any third state. Article 3(3) of the BIT explicitly makes that undertaking
applicable to the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT set forth in Article 8.

94. Where BIT “A” provides an investor with the option of selecting, as between two
different systems of arbitration, the one that appears to that investor most favorable to the
presentation of the particular claim that investor wishes to pursue with regard to an investment
protected by the BIT, and BIT “B” restricts investors covered by that treaty to bringing a claim
under only one of those systems of arbitration unless the State concerned agrees to the use of
another system for the particular dispute, it appears to the majority of this Tribunal that investors
under BIT “A” have been accorded more favorable treatment, as regards their management, use,
enjoyment, and disposal of their investments, than investors under BIT “B.” Indeed, depending
on the circumstances, investors making a claim under BIT “B” may be said to be at a competitive
disadvantage compared to investors claiming under BIT “A.”

95. Turkmenistan accords to Swiss investors a choice between bringing a claim under
Turkmenistan’s BIT with Switzerland in an ICSID Arbitration and bringing such a claim in an
UNCITRAL Abbitration. The tribunal in National Grid v. Argentina found that Argentina’s
agreement in its BIT with the United States that investors could resort to arbitration without first

resorting to the Argentine courts was an aspect of its “treatment” of investors subject to the MFN

clause of the Argentina-U.K. BIT.'™ The restriction imposed by Turkmenistan on U.K.
investors, insofar as the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT limits them to bringing claims under the BIT
only in an UNCITRAL Arbitration, is similarly a form of treatment, and is less favorable than
the treatment accorded by Turkmenistan to Swiss investors.

96. The Claimant, as a U.K. investor, is thus entitled by the MFN provisions of
Article 3 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT to avail itself of the more favorable treatment accorded
by Turkmenistan to investors of Switzerland under Turkmenistan’s BIT with that country, and
specifically to avail itself of the provision of that BIT in which Turkmenistan agrees to resolve
disputes with Swiss investors in an ICSID Arbitration or an UNCITRAL Apbitration, at the
election of the investor. The Claimant here has availed itself of that more favorable treatment by
commencing an ICSID Arbitration. In light of this finding, it is not necessary to consider
Turkmenistan’s BITs with France, Turkey, and India, nor the ECT.

97. The majority of the Tribunal therefore finds, without prejudice to the
Respondent’s second objection to jurisdiction (which it reserves for the next stage of this

proceeding), that it has jurisdiction, as an ICSID tribunal, to hear the Claimant’s claims.

Conclusion 31

Dissenting Opinion

Introduction

1. From the outset, I would like to point out that the present Dissenting Opinion does not
have the objective of dealing with the effect of most-favoured-nation (hereinafter
“MEN”) clauses on investment arbitration provisions of bilateral investment treaties
(‘BITs”), and more specifically their effect on dispute settlement provisions. The
applicable treaty in casu — the 1995 Agreement between the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of Turkmenistan for
the Promotion and Protection of Investments (hereinafter, the “U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT”)

— deals explicitly with this issue.

2. My Dissenting Opinion deals with the Respondent’s first objection to jurisdiction in the
present case, i.e. the objection for lack of consent. Throughout the jurisdictional phase
and during exchanges with my esteemed colleagues, I have always kept in mind the need
to preserve the exact balance of rights and obligations negotiated in the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT. Such a concern stems from the desire to ensure that the rights and

legal interests of both disputing parties are unaltered. !

3. Thave reflected at length on whether it is possible to support the decision of the majority
(hereinafter “the Decision”). However, the importance of the issues as I see them is such
that I have felt impelled to dissent, in particular from the finding of my colleagues that
the Tribunal “has jurisdiction, as an ICSID tribunal, to hear the Claimant’s claims”.? I
cannot agree with the reasoning and arguments on which this finding is based. The

reasons for my dissent are set forth below.

4. The objective of my Dissenting Opinion is to determine the conditions for resorting to

' Recently, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) recalled the necessity and importance not to “alter the limits of a
[court]’s judicial function”, see Frontier Dispute (Burkina Faso/Niger), Judgment of 16 April 2013, para. 46,
available at www.icj-cij.org.

? The Decision, para. 97.

ICSID arbitration under Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, and whether or not
consent to ICSID arbitration can be established via the MEN clause contained in Article
3(3) of the same BIT. There is no doubt that these are the two provisions at stake at the
present stage of the proceedings and that form the real legal dispute between the parties.
A tribunal has a duty “to isolate the real issue in the case”.>

5. It is crucial to stress from the outset a fundamental legal safeguard governing the issue of
consent before international courts and tribunals, in general, and ICSID tribunals in
particular: consent to jurisdiction in international adjudication must always be
established. First, this is a necessary prerequisite to the exercise of the international
judicial function. The principle of compétence de la compétence as defined under general
international law, and under Article 41 of the ICSID Convention, empowers an arbitral
tribunal or any other international court to determine proprio motu the extent and limits
of its jurisdiction. At the same time, the principle of compétence de la compétence
requires an arbitral tribunal or any other international court to establish the extent and
limits of its jurisdiction objectively, i.e., on the basis of the title of jurisdiction that is

conferred to the said tribunal, and not to go beyond it.

6. The trust and confidence in third-party adjudication is dependent on the respect by
international courts and tribunals of the limits to the jurisdiction conferred upon them.
Tribunals should not create a de facto system of compulsory jurisdiction, which in the
present stage of positive international law remains the exception. The international legal
order still rests largely on a system of facultative jurisdiction, and because of that
essential characteristic, a tribunal should never attempt to impose its jurisdiction and
adjudicate the merits of a dispute when the parties have not consented to its jurisdiction.
The ICSID arbitration system is not an exception to that approach. BITs were never
concluded by sovereign states with the idea that a third-party adjudicator would then

empower himself or herself with the authority to embark on ‘consent shopping’.

> Nuclear Tests (Australia v. France), Judgment, I.C.J. Reports 1974, p. 262, para. 29: “[...] it is the Court’s duty to
isolate the real issue in the case and to identify the object of the claim. It has never been contested that the Court is
entitled to interpret the submissions of the parties, and in fact is bound to do so; this is one of the attributes of its
judicial functions”.

7. The MEN clause regardless of its formulation in a BIT does not vest such authority in a
tribunal. The interpretation of MFN clauses is mutatis mutandis subject to the principle of
consent’ as enshrined both in general international law as well as in treaty law (the ICSID
Convention in the context of the present dispute). It would create a dangerous precedent
to formulate new approaches that go against these fundamental rules and principles of

international adjudication.>

8. Despite the repetitive use of the verb “import” by both the Claimant and the Respondent,
the Tribunal should not be misled and consider that the question in the present arbitration
is whether consent can be imported from one treaty to another treaty. I consider that the
real question that the Tribunal should address first and foremost is whether consent to
ICSID arbitration is or is not established under the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. Indeed, such
consent exists or does not exist, and cannot be based on presumptions. Lack of consent
cannot be remedied by the so-called ‘import’ of consent. As indicated by the International
Court of Justice (ICJ), the jurisdiction of international courts and tribunals, including
ICSID tribunals, “is based on the consent of the parties and is confined to the extent
accepted by them”.° Well-established principles governing the interpretation of titles of
jurisdiction as formulated by the ICJ should guide the interpretation of dispute settlement

provisions under the ICSID Convention and BITs. 7

4 See, e.g., Suez, Sociedad General de Aguas de Barcelona S.A., and Interagua Servicios Integrales de Agua S.A. v.
Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/17, Decision on Jurisdiction of 16 May 2006, para 59: “the Tribunal
finds no reason for interpreting the most-favored-nation treatment clause any differently from any other clause in the
Argentina-Spain BIT” (hereinafter “/nteragua v. Argentina”).

> See, e.g., Ch. De Visscher, Theory and Reality in Public International Law, Princeton, New Jersey, 1968, pp. 395-
396: “The judge is not asked to penetrate the intimate designs of the contracting parties; he is expected to discover
by the means at his disposal that part of their intentions that external signs reveal. Now the words freely chosen by
the parties are par excellence or at least primarily the instrument of this externalization. This, in turn, is a security
factor. The security that the treaty affords the contracting parties is measured by its capacity to withstand pressures
that might be brought to promote changes. Of this fundamental contractual guarantee the text, the common work of
the parties, is the essential instrument [...] What the Court does not allow is that in the course of interpretation the
text should be prematurely eclipsed by a teleological scrutiny that might distort its meaning. Such precipitate
reasoning may result in sacrificing respect for the text to subjective considerations."

(Djibouti v. France), 1.C.J. Reports 2008, p. 204, para. 62.

T It is well recognized that the drafters of the ICSID Convention heavily relied on the Statute and Rules of the ICJ
when negotiating the ICSID Convention. See, e.g., G. Kaufmann-Kohler, “Foreword” in A. R. Parra, The History of
ICSID, Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2012, p. viii. See also, A. R. Parra, ibid., pp. 51-53.

 

9. The present Dissenting Opinion will avoid repeating the positions of the Respondent and
the Claimant that have been already presented exhaustively in their respective written
submissions and during the hearing. I will first describe briefly the approach to
interpretation that should guide the Tribunal in light of the customary rules of treaty
interpretation as codified in Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (1969) (hereinafter, the *VCLT’)$ (I). Second, I will interpret Article 8 of the
U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT (II). At that level, the aim will be to analyze the relationship
between Article 8(1) and Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT as well as to
demonstrate that the real issue in the present dispute is whether consent can be
established under Article 8(2) rather than on Article 8(1), as the majority has incorrectly
tried to put it. Afterwards, I will focus on the ordinary meaning of Article 3(3) under the
customary rules of treaty interpretation (III). Subsequently, I will briefly deal with the
formal requirement(s) governing consent under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention,
which are essential for the proper functioning of ICSID and other arbitral mechanisms
(IV). Finally, assuming that the MFN clause of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT finds application in the present dispute, I will enquire whether the MFN clause

permits the Tribunal to find jurisdiction on the basis of another BIT (or other BITs) to

§ Article 31 (“General rule of interpretation”) reads as follows:

“1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the
treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its
preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connection with the conclusion of
the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connection with the conclusion of the treaty and
accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its
provisions
(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding
its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.”

Article 32 (“Supplementary means of interpretation’) state
“Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and
the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to
determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31:

(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”

 

 

which Turkmenistan is a party, if consent to ICSID jurisdiction is not given or established

under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT (V).

I. Which guidance is offered by the customary rules of treaty interpretation as codified in

the VCLT?

10. Under the customary rules of treaty interpretation, the Tribunal should essentially be
guided by the general rule of interpretation contained in Article 31 of the VCLT when
interpreting the scope of consent under Article 8 and the meaning of Article 3(3) of the
U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.° The stated general rule of interpretation can be summarized as
follows: the text must always be taken as the starting point.'° As such, no doctrine of
restrictive or extensive interpretation of the text of the treaty should prevail.'!

Interpretation of the text should be based on an “ex ante neutral approach”. R

11. As explained by an arbitral tribunal constituted under the auspices of the Permanent
Court of Arbitration (PCA), the rule of interpretation under Article 31 of the VCLT
“should be viewed as forming an integral whole, the constituent elements of which
cannot be separated”. '° The same tribunal also explained that “all the elements of the
general rule of interpretation provide the basis for establishing the common will and
intention of the parties by objective and rational means”.'* But most importantly, the

tribunal, following the practice of the ICJ in that respect, emphasized the following point:

[T]he “text of the treaty” is a notion distinct from, and broader than, the
notion of “terms”. Relying on the text does not mean relying solely, or

mainly, on the ordinary meaning of the terms. Such a solution would
effectively ignore the references to good faith, the context, and the object and
purpose of the treaty. The ordinary meaning of the terms is even itself
determined as a function of the context, object and purpose of the treaty.
Lastly, as paragraph 2 of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention provides, the
text of the treaty (including the preamble and annexes) is itself part of the
context for the purposes of interpretation.'*

12. It appears from the above quoted paragraph that the interpretation of the ordinary terms
of a provision such as Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT must take into account the
whole text of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT and not be limited to the terms embodied in
Article 8. The same logic applies to the interpretation of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT. The interpretation of the terms of Article 3(3) must take into account
the whole text of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT and, thus, be read in light of Article 8 of the
U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. It is not possible under customary rules of treaty interpretation,
as reflected in Article 31 of the VCLT, to isolate the interpretation of Article 8 from the
interpretation of Article 3(3) or vice versa.'° The proper interpretation must give meaning
and effect to both provisions, and not be an interpretation that would exclude one
provision and render it meaningless while conferring a broad meaning and effect on the
other provision.'” The “terms” of Article 3 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, and in
particular of Article 3(3), do not have a legal existence of their own that would compel
this Tribunal to ignore the context of the BIT and its object and purpose. As a result, the

“terms” of Article 3(3) cannot be used to completely override another provision of the

'5 Td. at para. 63.

'© The fact that both parties have not advanced this approach to interpretation is no reason not to apply it, since it is a
normal approach to treaty interpretation that the Tribunal can and should apply. Moreover, the legal maxim jura
novit curia applies. As stressed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in the Fisheries jurisdiction cases, for
instance, “[...] an international judicial organ, is deemed to take judicial notice of international law and is therefore
required [...] to consider on its own initiative all rules of international law which may be relevant to the settlement
of the dispute” (see Fisheries Jurisdiction (Federal Republic of Germany v. Iceland), Merits, Judgment, 1.C.J.
Reports 1974, p. 181, para. 18).

13. As a general rule, if after an examination of the terms of Article 8 and/or of Article 3(3),
their meaning remains ambiguous or obscure, or leads to a result which is manifestly
absurd or unreasonable, recourse can be had to supplementary means of treaty
interpretation (Article 32 of the VCLT) such as the preparatory work or the
circumstances of the conclusion of the BIT.'* The supplementary means can also be
referred to in order to confirm the interpretation of the ordinary meaning of the texts of
Article 8 and/or of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT under Article 31 of the
VCLT." In the context of the present Dissenting Opinion, supplementary means of treaty
interpretation will be referred to in order to confirm, in particular, the interpretation of the

ordinary meaning of the text of Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

II. Interpretation of Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT in light of the customary rules
of treaty interpretation

A. Relationship between Article 8(1) and Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT
14. Article 8(1) is inseparable of Article 8(2). Article 8(1) reads as follows:

Disputes between a national or company of one Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter under this
Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which have not been
amicably settled shall, after a period of four [months] from written
notification of a claim, be submitted to international arbitration if the
national or company concerned so wishes.

18 « [J the first duty of a tribunal which is called upon to interpret and apply the provisions of a treaty, is to

endeavour to give effect to them in their natural and ordinary meaning in the context in which they occur. If the
relevant words in their natural and ordinary meaning make sense in their context, that is an end of the matter. If, on
the other hand, the words in their natural and ordinary meaning are ambiguous or lead to an unreasonable result,
then and then only, must the Court, by resort to other methods of interpretation, seek to ascertain what the parties
really did mean when they used these words”, see Competence of the General Assembly for the Admission of a State

Article 8(2) of the BIT reads as follows:

Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration, the national or
company and the Contracting Party concerned in the dispute may agree to
refer the dispute either to:

(a) the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
(having regard to the provisions, where applicable, of the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of other
States, opened for signature at Washington DC on 18 March 1965 and the
Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and
Fact-Finding Proceedings); or

(b) the Court of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce; or

(c) an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal to be appointed
by a special agreement or established under the Arbitration Rules of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.

If after a period of four months from written notification of the claim there is
no agreement to one of the above alternative procedures, the dispute shall at
the request in writing of the national or company concerned be submitted to
arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law as then in force. The parties to the dispute may
agree in writing to modify these Rules.

The majority has persisted in considering that Article 8(1) deals with “Turkmenistan’s
consent to participate in international arbitration with U.K. investors and the conditions

attached to that consent” ”°

, and that Article 8(2) deals with “the arbitration systems that
may be used if the conditions of Article 8(1) are met”.?! Contrary to the interpretation of
the majority, Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT does not divide the question of
consent to participate in ICSID Arbitration into two parts. Elementary rules of treaty
interpretation invite to interpret Article 8 as a whole and not as composed of segmented
and fragmented provisions as the majority has chosen to do. The whole mechanism of
Article 8 relates to consent to international arbitration. Article 8(1) does not invite the
Tribunal to look first at whether the host state has consented to participate in international
arbitration at all (under Article 8(1)), and second, at whether it has agreed to ICSID

arbitration (under Article 8(2)). Such an approach is not grounded in a proper application

°° The Decision, para. 25.

Td.

20.

of the customary rules of treaty interpretation because it would deprive Article 8(1) of its

real function and make Article 8(2) redundant.

Article 8(1) formulates the rule according to which if, after a period of four months, no
amicable settlement can be reached between the foreign investor and the host state, the
former can submit the dispute to international arbitration. The majority considers that

consent is granted in Article 8(1).2

The legal purpose of Article 8(1) is to fix pre-conditions or what is commonly referred to
as ‘conditions precedent’ to international arbitration, i.e., negotiations during four
months. There lies the ratio legis of Article 8(1). It is meant to govern the pre-conditions
of consent to arbitration under Article 8 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. In other words,
Article 8(1) contains, subject to the condition of four months of negotiations, consent in
principle to international arbitration, and such consent in principle must still be read in
light of the further specific conditions governing consent to arbitration by virtue of

Article 8(2).

Articles 8(1) and 8(2) are two sides of the same coin. The coin — Article 8 — encompasses
the provisions governing consent to international arbitration under the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT. One side of the coin — Article 8(1) — shows the general pre-
condition(s) under which a foreign investor can initiate international arbitration against
the host state; the other side — Article 8(2) — fixes the strict conditions under which the
foreign investor can pursue one specific venue of international arbitration (e.g., ICSID

arbitration) rather than another (e.g. UNCITRAL arbitration).

I find it difficult to subscribe to the point of view of the majority according to which
“Article 8(2) [is] only a menu of options concerning the arbitration process, and a default
selection’. As Article 8(1), Article 8(2) also embodies consent to international
arbitration. Chronologically and logically, Article 8(2) becomes mandatorily applicable

after it is proved (or has been proven that) that the requirement of negotiations during

2 Td.at para. 31.

3 Id.

21.

Td.

four months has been fulfilled under Article 8(1). This is where the analysis of Article
8(1) should stop and where the analysis under Article 8(2) should start. The majority has
chosen to focus on Article 8(1) in order to justify its approach and to find jurisdiction in
the present case. With all due respect for my colleagues, I believe that the Decision has
used Article 8(1) as a means to achieve an end that it could not easily achieve by
acknowledging that consent to arbitration is contained in Article 8(2). The focus should
have been on Article 8(2), which is the true subject-matter of the dispute at this
jurisdictional phase. The objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal that was raised by
the Respondent is an objection for lack of consent under Article 8(2). Nothing less,
nothing more. The remainder of my opinion will thus only deal with Article 8(2). I will
now analyze the position of the majority according to which Article 8(2) does not

encompass consent to arbitration.

. The ordinary meaning of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT

The majority states in its Decision that because Article 8(2) begins with “Where the
dispute is referred to international arbitration,” this indicates that “Article 8(2) only
comes into play after the determination has been made, under the provisions of Article
8(1), to refer the dispute to arbitration”.* The position of the majority shows a
misperception of the ordinary meaning of the terms contained in Article 8(2). The phrase
“Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration,” does not imply at all that
Article 8(2) does not deal with consent to arbitration. The said phrase relates specifically
to the initiation of international arbitration under the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT and simply
confirms that under Article 8(2) — like in many other BITs — it is the foreign investor that
initiates investment arbitration. In this respect, there is a cause-and-effect relationship
between the last part of Article 8(1) (“disputes shall [...] be submitted to international
arbitration if the national or company concerned so wishes’) and the beginning of Article
8(2) (“Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration”). In other words, if the
foreign investor ‘wishes’, he can choose (to initiate) international arbitration to settle his

dispute with the host state. However — and this is where I strongly disagree with the

22.

23.

majority — the power of initiation (or choice to have recourse to investment arbitration) is
not tantamount to consent to arbitration. The initiation of investment arbitration by the
foreign investor in a specific arbitration forum is still conditioned to the consent from the
host state under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. That is why Article 8(2),
next to the preceding paragraph of that article, also covers without any doubt, consent to

international arbitration.

The wording of Article 8(2) is clear and confirms that consent to arbitration is
specifically dealt with in Article 8(2) when a foreign investor envisages having recourse
to a specific arbitration venue. Article 8(2) states that “the national or company and the
Contracting Party concerned in the dispute may agree to refer the dispute either to the
International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes [...] or the Court of
Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce or an international arbitrator or ad
hoc arbitration tribunal to be appointed by a special agreement or established under the
Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law”
(emphasis added). The phrase “may agree to refer the dispute” demonstrates that Article
8(2) governs consent to arbitration when it comes to specific venues of arbitration. A
similar wording can be found in Article 36(1) of the Statute of the International Court of
Justice (ICJ). Article 36(1) provides that “The jurisdiction of the Court comprises all
cases which the parties refer to if’. This provision is found in the part of the Statute
dealing with the jurisdiction of the ICJ, i.e. the part governing ways of consenting to the
jurisdiction of the Court. Why would a provision which affords the parties the possibility
to agree to refer the dispute to the ICJ be considered a provision dealing with consent to
jurisdiction while, on the other hand, a provision affording the possibility to agree to refer
disputes to arbitration under the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, would not be qualified as

relating to consent to arbitration?

Let us have a closer look at the mechanism of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.
Article 8(2) offers, three options to settle a dispute between a foreign investor and a host
state arising out of the said BIT. The dispute can be settled under ICSID arbitration

(option 1), ICC arbitration (option 2) or UNCITRAL arbitration (option 3).

24.

25.

26.

However, for one of these options to be used by a foreign investor both the foreign
investor and the host state must have previously agreed to refer the dispute to one of
those three fora. The conditions for such previous agreement will vary depending upon
which of the dispute settlement procedures is selected. Article 8(2) clearly states that in
order to refer the dispute to international arbitration, “the national or company and the
Contracting Party” concerned by the investment dispute “may agree” to settle the dispute
under one of the above-identified options (italics added). Therefore, ICSID arbitration
under the ordinary meaning of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT can only be

used by the foreign investor if it has mutually agreed with the respondent state to do so.

It cannot be assumed that ‘and’ means ‘or’ in the context of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT. Nothing suggests that the Tribunal should depart from the ordinary
meaning of the word ‘and’ which means ‘together with’ or ‘along with’ — i.e., the foreign
investor ‘together with’ the state concerned. Moreover, the expression ‘may agree’
implies that the foreign investor is not granted with “an immediate right to resort to
ICSID arbitration””> under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. Assent of both the
foreign investor and the host state concerned is necessary for ICSID arbitration to be
triggered. A similar wording (“as may be mutually agreed by the parties”) in the context
of a national investment legislation has been interpreted as meaning that a “subsequent
agreement between the parties is required””® for ICSID arbitration to be initiated by a

foreign investor.

This reading of Article 8(2) is confirmed by the fact that Article 8(2) itself provides that,
“if after a period of four months from written notification of the claim there is no
agreement” (italics added) to use one of the three options “the dispute shall at the request
in writing of the national or company concerned be submitted to arbitration” (italics
added) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Such wording clearly indicates that a
mutual agreement is needed for ICSID arbitration to be initiated by the foreign investor.

When an agreement cannot be reached between the foreign investor and the state

2008, para. 331 (hereinafter “Biwater v. Tanzania”).

concerned, only arbitration under UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules can be used by the

foreign investor, not ICSID arbitration or ICC arbitration. The verb ‘shall’ illustrates

that rationale. It shows that the only type of arbitration for which a subsequent or mutual
agreement between the foreign investor and the state concerned is not needed under

Article 8(2) — after four months of notification of the claim — is UNCITRAL ad hoc

arbitration. Article 8(2) is clear in its literal meaning and its intended effect.7”

27. If the language of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT were not to be interpreted
in the light of its ordinary meaning, there would be a risk of depriving the final part of
Article 8(2) (“if after a period of four months ... under the Arbitration Rules of the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law”) of its effet utile (ut res magis
valeat quam pereat). This principle of effectiveness must be taken into account when
interpreting a BIT or specific provision(s) of a BIT under Article 31 of the VCLT. Not
only has the ICJ acknowledged that “the principle of effectiveness [...] has an important
role in the law of treaties”, but also some arbitral tribunals have recognized that “[i]t is
a cardinal rule of the interpretation of treaties that each and every operative clause of a
treaty is to be interpreted as meaningful rather than meaningless”.””

28. As indicated above (see para. 13 of the present Opinion), the ordinary meaning of Article
8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT can be confirmed by taking into account the
circumstances of the conclusion of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. This method of treaty
interpretation is based on Article 32 of the VCLT, which also reflects customary

international law.

The U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT was negotiated and concluded following the adoption of the
1991 U.K. Model BIT.” The said Model BIT set forth two approaches to Article 8. One
approach called the ‘preferred’ version of Article 8 contained a direct consent to ICSID
arbitration without the need of a prior agreement between the foreign investor and the
host state (“Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit to the International Centre
for the Settlement of Investment Disputes...”). The other approach, named the
‘alternative’ version, required a subsequent agreement by the parties to submit their
dispute to ICSID. Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT embodies the ‘alternative’
version. If a different interpretation were adopted, this would obviously change the nature
of the intent of Turkmenistan and the U.K. It would also go against the ordinary meaning
of Article 8(2) as it appears from the text of the provision itself as well as the

circumstances of the conclusion of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

The circumstances of the adoption of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT confirm the intent of
the Parties and the ordinary meaning to be given to Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT in light of its context and object and purpose. Both U.K. and Turkmenistan have
made the choice to opt for the ‘alternative’ version and that choice has to be given full
effect by the Tribunal in the present case. Putting aside their choice (i.e., for the
‘alternative version’) would be tantamount to imposing on them an approach other than
the one they negotiated and agreed to be bound by. However, restrictions to the
sovereignty of states cannot be presumed — even through the application of an MFN
clause.*! When states consent to the jurisdiction of an international court or tribunal, such
as ICSID tribunals, they agree to restrict their sovereignty in a specific context. This is
one of the very raisons d’étre of international adjudication: the acceptance by states to

relinquish part of their sovereignty and submit to the judgment of third-party

* See Ex. R-7, 1991 U.K. Model BIT, International Investment Instruments: A Compendium, UNCTAD/DTCI/30

(Vol. IID).

3! See Daimler v. Argentina, Award of 22 August 2012, para. 168: “all international treaties — whether bilateral,
plurilateral or multilateral — are essentially expressions of the contracting states’ consent to be bound by particular
legal norms. They encapsulate voluntarily accepted restraints upon the universally recognized principle of state
sovereignty. Consent is therefore the cornerstone of all international treaty commitments, at least insofar as those
commitments exceed the minimum requirements of customary international law. The primacy of the principle of
consent runs through all types of treaty commitments entered into by states. There is no distinction between
substantive treatment provisions, MFN clauses, dispute resolution clauses, or otherwise. All are equally valid and
equally binding to the full extent of the contracting State parties’ consent” (emphasis added).

31.

32.

33.

adjudicators. Therefore, consent to ICSID arbitration in a case such as this cannot be
construed, when in reality a state has not consented to ICSID arbitration, but has instead
opted for the approach of the ‘alternative’ U.K. model of BITs which excludes ICSID

arbitration unless consented to by both parties.

The tribunal in Daimler v. Argentina has particularly insisted on the aforementioned

aspects and its cautious approach deserves to be quoted here:

[...] as international treaties, BITs constitute an exercise of sovereignty by
which States strike a delicate balance among their various internal policy
considerations. For this reason, the Tribunal must take care not to allow any
presuppositions concerning the types of international law mechanisms
(including dispute resolution clauses) that may best protect and promote
investment to carry it beyond the bounds of the framework agreed upon by
the contracting state parties. It is for States to decide how best to protect and
promote investment. The texts of the treaties they conclude are the definitive
guide as to how they have chosen to do so.”

Thus, the choice of the ‘alternative’ model should govern the understanding and

interpretation of the scope of application of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

The U.K. would not have adopted two models of BITs if it had considered that the two
models would lead to the same result. Moreover, the U.K.’s BIT treaty practice is quite
varied with respect to its dispute settlement commitments. This stresses the importance of

the choices made by the negotiators in each specific case.

The disputes which have been brought in the context of BITs concluded by the U.K. with
other countries always followed the arbitration procedures as foreseen in the concerned
BITs. A most recent example is Oxus Gold v. Uzbekistan. The dispute arose out of the
U.K.-Uzbekistan BIT which also encompasses the ‘alternative’ version of the U.K.
Model BIT. The Claimant accordingly brought the dispute under the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, as there was no agreement between the two parties to bring the dispute

to another forum, such as ICSID.*

Having thus clarified aspects of the interpretation of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT under Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT, the present opinion turns to

establishing the ordinary meaning of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

Ill. The ordinary meaning of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT in light of the
customary rules of treaty interpretation

35.

36.

37.

Article 3 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT reads as follows:

Article 3

National Treatment and Most-favoured-nation Provisions
(1) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject investments or
returns of nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party to treatment
less favourable than that which it accords to investments or returns of its own
nationals or companies or to investments or returns of nationals or companies
of any third State.
(2) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Party, as regards their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investments, to treatment
less favourable than that which it accords to its own nationals or companies
or to nationals or companies of any third State.
(3) For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment provided for
in paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to
11 of this Agreement.

Article 3 encompasses the national treatment obligation and the most-favoured nation
(MEN) principle. As such, Article 3 reflects a common substantive standard that is found
in the vast majority of BITs. What differentiates Article 3 from many provisions of BITs
dealing with the national treatment obligation and the MEN principle is that it addresses
specifically and explicitly the scope of its application within the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.
Indeed, Article 3(3) of the said BIT specifies:

For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment provided for in

paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11

of this Agreement. (italics added)
During the last decade, much controversy has arisen with respect to MFN provisions
contained in BITs. One of the major aspects of this controversy before investment arbitral
tribunals is whether MEN provisions apply to dispute settlement provisions of BITs. The

U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT clearly prevents such a controversy from arising before an

16

38.

39.

arbitral tribunal that has jurisdiction to deal with disputes under the said BIT. Indeed, the
wording of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT shows that the MEN principle
applies to dispute settlement provisions of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, thus including

Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

It is not within the ambit of the present dissenting opinion to give a detailed analysis of
MEN provisions and their meaning under general international law. It is sufficient to
recall that the function of an MFN provision is to guarantee balanced and coherent treaty
relations between the members of the international community. More specifically, what
an MEN provision allows in the context of BITs is the following: to extend treatment of
foreign investors that is more favourable under a BIT to treatment of foreign investors
that is less favourable under other BITs. Therefore, because of the MFN provision
contained in Article 3 of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT and its application to dispute
settlement issues, a foreign investor of British nationality can invoke more favourable
dispute settlement provisions embodied in other BITs concluded by Turkmenistan. Since
Article 3(3) is part of a whole, i.e., the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, it is necessary to read
and interpret its terms in light of the other provisions of the BIT (the context of the BIT)

and, especially, Article 8(2).

The issue in the present dispute is the relationship between Article 3(3) and Article 8(2)
of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. As previously explained, the interpretation of the
ordinary meaning of Article 3(3) cannot be isolated from the mechanism set forth in
Article 8(2) (see paragraph 12 above). This approach was also adopted by the tribunal in
Austrian Airlines v. Slovakia. Indeed, when dealing with the MEN clause contained in
Article 3(1) of the Austria-Slovakia BIT, the tribunal found that it “must therefore look to
the context of Article 3(1) as well as to the other elements relevant for its interpretation.
Starting with the context, Article 3(1) must be viewed for present purposes in
combination with Article 3(2) as well as with the treaty provision that deal with dispute
settlement, i.e. Articles 8 and 4(4) and 4(5y.4 The tribunal even went further and

specified that “[w]hat the Tribunal must examine is whether the Treaty provides for

exceptions to the application of the MFN clause, and more specifically, whether the
provisions governing access to arbitration under the Treaty are to be regarded as a
limitation to the scope of the MFN clause”.*> In my view, there is, thus, no doubt that the
relationship between Article 3(3) and Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT is one

that should have been dealt with by the majority in the present instance.

Relationship between Article 3(3) and Article 8(2). To give effect to the MFN clause
contained in Article 3(3), the foreign investor must first be in a dispute settlement
relationship with the host state. A problem of treatment can only arise when the foreign
investor is treated in a certain way while entertaining a specific relationship with the host
state. If there is no relationship between the host state and the foreign investor, the
question of more or less favourable treatment is not at stake and thus, the MEN principle
does not apply. The so-called ‘choice’ that supposedly derives from an MEN provision
and which has been extensively used by the majority to justify its approach in casu, does
not come into play if a problem of treatment cannot be identified under the U.K.-

Turkmenistan BIT.

In other words, the so-called ‘right’ to a more favourable treatment under Article 3(3) of
the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT can only be exercised if the foreign investor and the host
state are subject to a dispute settlement relationship under one of the dispute settlement
options that are provided in Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. In that sense, the
application of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT is subordinated or conditioned

to the prior application of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

As indicated above (see para. 23), Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT offers three
options to settle a dispute between a foreign investor and a state arising out of the said
BIT. The dispute can be settled under the ICSID Convention (option 1), or by the ICC
Court of Arbitration (option 2), or else under UNCITRAL arbitration (option 3). For the
Claimant to benefit from more favourable treatment under other BITs concluded by
Turkmenistan, one of these options of dispute settlement must first be deemed applicable.

For an option to be deemed applicable, prior and strict compliance with the conditions

* Austrian Airlines v. Slovakia, UNCITRAL Case, Award of 9 October 2009, para. 131.

prescribed by Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT is necessary.

43. Option 1 — ICSID arbitration — is only deemed applicable under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT if the foreign investor has mutually agreed with the respondent state to
have recourse to ICSID arbitration. As long as such a mutual agreement is not
established, an issue of treatment — and even less of MFN — does not arise under Option 1
(ICSID arbitration). The MEN principle can, thus, only apply with respect to ICSID
arbitration if there is a mutual agreement between the foreign investor and the host state
to settle the investment dispute through ICSID arbitration. If such a mutual agreement is
established, then Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT applies and a claimant in a
dispute may be in a position to invoke more favourable ICSID arbitration provisions
contained in other BITs concluded by Turkmenistan. In the absence of a mutual
agreement to ICSID arbitration, a claimant will not be in a position to invoke more
favourable treatment under Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT with respect to

ICSID arbitration under other BITs concluded by Turkmenistan. *°

44, Here, there is simply no issue of treatment under ICSID arbitration that arises, since
ICSID arbitration is deemed inexistent in the absence of a mutual agreement. This is the
reasonable ordinary meaning that can be given to Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT under customary rules of treaty interpretation. This gives effet utile to the wording of
both Article 3(3) and Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.”” In this context,
attention can be given to the approach of the Tza Yap Shum v. Peru tribunal, which went
in the direction of both conferring full effet utile to the wording of a dispute settlement

clause in a BIT and reading treaties as a whole (rather than as mere assemblage of

*° Tt might be argued, and indeed is argued by Claimant, that in the present case "treatment" is established at least at
the minimum level of the UNCITRAL rules without consent of Turkmenistan. On the basis of that "treatment",
Claimant could seek the ICSID level of treatment — assuming that, for the sake of argument, it is more favourable
than UNCITRAL treatment. As I have demonstrated above, this cannot be achieved within the framework of the
U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, as it would circumvent the precondition of mutual consent for ICSID arbitration. As to the
argument that this could be based on another BIT in which Turkmenistan would have consented to ICSID arbitration
without the need for mutual agreement, this question is dealt with in detail in Chapter V below.

57 As explained by the International Court of Justice (ICJ): “The principle of interpretation expressed in the maxim:
Ut res magis valeat quam pereat, often referred to as the rule of effectiveness, cannot justify the Court in attributing
to the provisions for the settlement of disputes [...] a meaning which would be contrary to their letter and spirit”; see

separate provisions).**

45. Let us now turn to the formal requirement(s) that govern consent under Article 25(1) of

the ICSID Convention.

IV. The formal requirement(s) governing consent under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention

46. Consent is a necessary prerequisite for ICSID arbitration.” It is the “cornerstone” of

ICSID jurisdiction. Without consent, no ICSID arbitration can take place.

47. Article 25 of the ICSID Convention requires that the parties to the dispute “consent in
writing” to submit that dispute to the Centre. Under Article 25, consent in writing is thus
necessary, but the text does not give any further indication about either the manner or
timing of such consent or the way in which it must be interpreted. There is no
requirement that such consent be contained in a single article of a treaty or in a single
treaty.“° Consent to ICSID arbitration can be identified in a treaty, in a national
investment law or in a contract. Nevertheless, an idea of implicit consent is not
admissible in the ICSID system. Whatever the instrument in which consent to ICSID

arbitration is embodied, consent must be given in writing.

48. The ICSID Convention is crystal-clear. Consent is a prerequisite and if it is not

established, no jurisdiction can be exercised by an ICSID tribunal. There is no need to

vl

embark on a discussion whether consent must be “clear and unambiguous,” or whether

dispute settlement provisions or so-called compromissory clauses must be interpreted in a

restrictive or liberal manner.” Indeed, as stressed by Judge Rosalyn Higgins, “[i]t is clear
from the jurisprudence of the Permanent Court and of the International Court that there is
no rule that requires a restrictive interpretation of compromissory clauses,” and there is

no doubt that the ICJ “has no judicial policy of being either liberal or strict in deciding

the scope of compromissory clauses; they are judicial decisions like any other”.

49. Nevertheless — and I consider that this is what should have guided the majority in the
present dispute — the ICJ has been constant and strict in recalling that its jurisdiction “is
based on the consent of States under the conditions expressed [in the relevant treaties]”
(emphasis added).* The same rationale applies to the jurisdiction of ICSID tribunals
under the ICSID Convention. The ICJ has also been consistent in recalling that the
consent allowing for the Court to assume jurisdiction “must be certain”. The same
principle applies for consent to ICSID arbitration. Lastly, the ICJ has consistently
emphasized that “whatever the basis of consent, the attitude of the respondent State must
be capable of being regarded as ‘an unequivocal indication’ of the desire of that State to
accept the Court’s jurisdiction in a ‘voluntary and indisputable’ manner” (emphasis
added).“° Once again, the same rationale applies to consent to ICSID arbitration. These
are the parameters that the Tribunal in the present case should take into account. The

tribunal in National Grid v. Argentina did not go in a different direction when it stated

that “what matters is the intention of the parties as expressed in the text?”

No international court or tribunal, including ICSID tribunals, has challenged or contested
those fundamental characteristics of consent to jurisdiction. The RosInvest v. Russia
award — which remains a unique case with respect to the interpretation and application of
the MEN clause — did not go as far as saying that consent to arbitration under a specific
forum could be imported from one BIT to another BIT when consent to that specific

arbitration forum under the latter had not been established. “*

In casu, it is clear that no mutual agreement in writing was reached between Garanti
Koza and Turkmenistan to submit the dispute to ICSID arbitration. As explained above,
no consent to ICSID arbitration can be found under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT. Since consent to ICSID arbitration cannot be identified, Article 3.3 on
MEN treatment is not applicable.” The fact that Article 8(1) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT refers to “international arbitration” cannot be invoked to circumvent Article 8(2). It
also cannot be invoked to deduce a so-called ‘choice’ of the foreign investor under
Article 3(3) to circumvent Article 8(2) and to decide which international arbitration

procedure would be more favourable.

However, and in light of the arguments presented by the Claimant (as accepted by the
majority), let us assume that the MFN clause contained in Article 3(3) of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT is applicable. It remains to be determined whether consent to ICSID
arbitration could allegedly be established in the present case through the operation of the
MEN clause, despite the absence of consent under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT. In other words, the issue is whether consent to ICSID arbitration can be established
from an MFN clause read together with an ICSID arbitration clause contained in another
treaty, that neither finds direct application in the present case nor has been precisely

identified by the Claimant in its request for arbitration.

V. Would the MFN clause of Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT permit the
Tribunal to find jurisdiction on the basis of another BIT regardless of the absence of
consent to ICSID arbitration under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT?

53.

54.

55.

56.

Both the Respondent and the Claimant cited several authorities to support their arguments
against or in favour of finding consent to ICSID arbitration through the MFN clause

embodied in Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

Article 3(3), in its relevant part, reads as follows:

For the avoidance of doubt it is confirmed that the treatment provided for in

paragraphs (1) and (2) above shall apply to the provisions of Articles 1 to 11

of this Agreement.
Article 8 of the BIT is the investor-state dispute resolution provision. As it falls within
Articles 1 to 11 of the BIT, it is thus covered by the MEN clause of Article 3. However,
does it provide a foreign investor with a right to ‘import’ from other Turkmenistan
investment treaties a “more favourable treatment” with respect to dispute resolution,

including the arbitration forum?

From the Claimant’s standpoint, consent to ICSID arbitration can be provided by an
MEN clause read together with the dispute resolution clause of another investment treaty
concluded by the host state. This is a novel approach. Indeed, the Claimant is not
suggesting that the MEN clause contained in Article 3(3) of the U.K Turkmenistan BIT
would allow for less stringent conditions for recourse to international arbitration in a
specific forum. What the Claimant is suggesting is that the said MFN clause authorizes a
foreign investor to import consent to ICSID arbitration from any other treaty to which
Turkmenistan has consented to ICSID arbitration. More than raising issues of
interpretation, this argument relates to the very foundations of the system of ICSID
arbitration. In other words, can an MEN clause serve as a basis to establish consent to
ICSID arbitration when such consent was not given in the treaty embodying the said

MEN clause?

At the outset, one could question the admissibility per se of the claim. The Claimant has

23

57.

58.

59.

made no real ‘offer to arbitrate’ under ICSID™ and, thus, no ‘meeting of the minds’ about
arbitration under ICSID between the foreign investor and the host state under ICSID was

even possible.

Neither the interpretation of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT nor investment law practice can
lead one to think that the MEN clause contained in Article 3(3) of the U.K-Turkmenistan
BIT allows the Tribunal to endorse a reasoning according to which it is possible for an
MEN clause to incorporate by reference an agreement to arbitrate from another treaty if it

was not prima facie the intention of the Parties to the BIT.

The Claimant refers, inter alia, to the dissenting opinion of Brigitte Stern in Impregilo v.
Argentina in support of its argument. If this opinion is examined in its entirety, it will
show that the dissenting opinion does not state what the Claimant believes it states. The
Claimant makes reference to the following passages of the dissenting opinion:

Naturally, an important caveat has to be presented here. The interpretation of
the MPN clause is only necessary when the intention of the parties
concerning its applicability or inapplicability to the dispute settlement
mechanism is not expressly stated or clearly ascertained. It is quite evident
that if there is an MFN clause expressly including the dispute settlement
procedures or expressly excluding them, there is no need for an
interpretation.

There are indeed cases where the parties expressly state that the MFN clause
applies to the dispute settlement mechanism. This has been done, for
example, by the drafters of the U.K. Model BIT, who have provided in
Article 3(3) that “for avoidance of doubt MFN treatment shall apply to
certain specified provisions of the BIT including the dispute settlement
provision”.*!

However, in Brigitte Stern’s dissenting opinion, the main contention was that the MFN
could not apply to the conditions of access to dispute settlement (as the condition ratione

voluntatis could not be modified). The question of the extension of the scope of a right

was not discussed. Brigitte Stern emphasized that if the conditions surrounding the

*° Tt is important to stress that the Claimant asked the Tribunal to apply more favourable dispute resolution clauses
of Turkmenistan’s BITs with Switzerland, France, Turkey, and India, and the ECT. However, the Claimant did not
specify which BIT had to be applied in the present instance and, most of all, did not even mention those BITs in its
request of arbitration.

consent as required in the basic treaty were not met, no right to arbitration exists and
therefore no right can be modified by the MEN clause, and in particular the scope of the
right to arbitrate. On the question of whether or not the MEN clause applies to dispute
settlement provisions in a BIT, Brigitte Stern stated clearly:

[It] cannot change the conditions ratione personae, ratione materiae, and
ratione temporis [...] it must be equally true that an MFN clause cannot
change the condition ratione voluntatis, which is a qualifying condition for
the enjoyment of the jurisdictional rights open for the protection of
substantial rights.

L.]

In other words, before a provision relating to the dispute settlement
mechanism can be imported into the basic treaty, the right to international
arbitration — here ICSID arbitration — has to be capable of coming into
existence for the foreign investor under the basic treaty, in other words the
existence of this right is conditioned on the fulfillment of all the necessary
conditions for such jurisdiction, the conditions ratione personae, ratione
materiae, and ratione temporis as well as a supplementary condition relating
to the scope of the State’s consent to such jurisdiction, the condition ratione
voluntatis.

L.]

As long as the qualifying conditions expressed by the State in order to give
its consent are not fulfilled, there is no consent, in other words no access of
the foreign investor to the jurisdictional treatment granted by ICSID
arbitration. An MEN clause cannot enlarge the scope of the basic treaty’s
right to international arbitration, it cannot be used to grant access to
international arbitration when this is not possible under the conditions
provided for in the basic treaty.

The same concerns were already addressed by the Maffezini v. Spain tribunal. The
reasoning of the Mafezzini v. Spain tribunal is worth noting as the tribunal acted in
assuming that the MFN provision should find application with respect to dispute
settlement, i.e., as if the concerned treaty contained a provision similar to Article 3(3) of
the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT. The tribunal stressed that “there are some important limits

that ought to be kept in mind”?

when dealing with an MEN clause. As stated by the same
tribunal, one of those limits is that an MFN clause cannot provide for a particular
arbitration forum (e.g., ICSID), if this option was not foreseen, or not initially permitted

without the prior fulfillment of conditions in the treaty incorporating the said MFN

clause.™ In other words, the Maffezini v. Spain tribunal concluded that one system of
arbitration cannot be replaced by another. Noting the potential disruption of the
international arbitral system, the Maffezini v. Spain tribunal held:

[Third,] if the agreement provides for a particular arbitration forum, such as

ICSID, for example, this option cannot be changed by invoking the clause, in

order to refer the dispute to a different system of arbitration.”
In paraphrasing the Maffezini v. Spain decision, it could be said that if the agreement
provides for a particular arbitration forum, such as UNCITRAL, this option cannot be
changed by invoking the clause in order to refer the dispute to a different system of

arbitration, such as ICSID.

In line with what the Maffezini v. Spain tribunal held, no investment award or decision
has since then decided that an MEN provision would allow the import of consent to
ICSID arbitration from another treaty. This possibility cannot even be deduced from the
RosInvest v. Russia award. The role of the MFN clause is not to substitute for a lack of
consent, but to ensure that the consent given is implemented in the most favourable
manner to the individual investor entitled to protection, as compared to the treatment
given to other such individuals in treaties with third countries.°° The National Grid v.
Argentina tribunal correctly noted that an MFN clause is not a basis for creating consent

to ICSID arbitration when none exists.””

In conclusion, the MFN clause embodied in Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT
cannot bypass the requirement of consent to ICSID arbitration. This is undeniable. If the
requirement of consent to ICSID arbitration, as stipulated in Article 8 of the U.K.-
Turkmenistan BIT, as well as in the ICSID Convention itself, could easily be put aside
because of the interplay of MFN clauses, there would be a threat to the entire system of
investor-state arbitration. BITs providing for ICSID jurisdiction should abide by the

ICSID Convention. Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT stresses this point when it

provides for the need to “having regard to the provisions, where applicable of the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of

other States [...]”.

Granting Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT such extensive effect as to allow for
consent to ICSID through incorporation by reference in the frame of a treaty that does not
allow this, would have the effect of “replac[ing] a procedure specifically negotiated by

758 or “system of arbitration”.©° It would

parties with an entirely different mechanism’
involve a forum-shopping attitude that bypasses the consent requirement of the
Respondent while running against the fundamental principles of international

adjudication.

The literal and ordinary meaning of Article 8(2) has to be given full effect to determine
whether or not consent to ICSID arbitration exists. Any other interpretation would lead to
an artificial construction. Under Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, consent to
ICSID arbitration can only derive from a mutual agreement between the foreign investor
and the host state. If there is no such mutual agreement, then there is no consent to ICSID
arbitration. No attempt to establish consent to ICSID arbitration under an MEN clause is
possible, since it will have the perverse effect of replacing actual non-consent by virtual
consent. That would go against the fundamental pillars of the law of treaties (principle of

consent, pacta sunt servanda, etc.) as well as against the pillars of the ICSID system.

The Claimant contends that “there is no obstacle of ‘form’ preventing a tribunal from
finding that Turkmenistan has consented to arbitration through an MEN clause, provided
the text of the clause allows for the incorporation by reference of an arbitration
agreement”. Rather than mere obstacle(s) of form, there are ‘procedural’ and
‘substantive’ impediments that would definitely preclude the Tribunal from granting to
Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT an effect that it does not and was never

supposed to produce in the context of the said BIT. The ejusdem generis rule — which is

considered a general principle of international law®! — dictates such a cautious attitude.

66. As explained by the International Law Commission (ILC) in its Commentary on the Draft
Articles on MFN Clauses:

No writer would deny the validity of the ejusdem generis rule which, for the
purposes of the most-favoured-nation clause, derives from its very nature. It
is generally admitted that a clause conferring most-favoured-nation rights in
respect of a certain matter, or class of matter, can attract the rights conferred
by other treaties (or unilateral acts) only in regard to the same matter or class
of matter. The effect of the most-favoured-nation process is, by means of the
provisions of one treaty, to attract those of another. Unless this process is
strictly confined to cases where there is a substantial identity between the
subject-matter of the two sets of clauses concerned, the result in a number of
cases may be to impose upon the granting State obligations it never
contemplated. Thus the rule follows clearly from the general principles of
treaty interpretation. States cannot be regarded as being bound beyond the
obligations they have undertaken.”

67. The subject-matter of Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT sets forth non-consent
to ICSID arbitration if there is no specific agreement between the parties. The subject-
matter of the dispute settlement clauses embodied in other BITs concluded by
Turkmenistan and allegedly — albeit without relying specifically on one of them —
invoked by the Claimant provides for consent to ICSID arbitration. In accordance with
the ejusdem generis rule, the MFN clause under Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan
BIT cannot be interpreted as allowing to “attract rights [to ICSID arbitration] conferred
by other treaties” (i.e., the automatic right to resort to ICSID arbitration) when the

clause”” (italics added). See The Most-Favoured-Nation-Clause, Report of the International Law Com: ion (26
April-3 June and 4 July-12 August 2011), General Assembly Official Records, Sixty-third session, A/66/10, p. 287,

is exactly to deny such rights to ICSID arbitration in the absence of mutual agreement.

68. The absence of a mutual agreement to ICSID arbitration is the main impediment for this
Tribunal to exercise its jurisdiction. It is this absence of a mutual agreement that prevents
the ‘import’ of ICSID arbitration into a treaty that does not provide for ICSID arbitration.
In this context, there is a need to address the misleading parallel that the Claimant —
followed in this regard by the majority in the present instance — has attempted to draw
between this dispute and C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia. According to the Claimant, incorporation
by reference of an ICSID arbitration provision from one treaty to another by operation of
an MEN clause is similar to incorporation into a contract by reference to an ICSID

arbitration provision contained in a treaty that has not entered into force.

69. In contrast to what the majority claims, C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia is neither about the
applicability of an MEN provision to the dispute settlement provisions of a BIT nor about
the possibility to ‘import’ consent to ICSID arbitration or to ‘create’ consent to ICSID
arbitration when such consent is not established. The C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia decision
confirms that, without consent to ICSID arbitration, no jurisdiction can be exercised by
an ICSID tribunal. In C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia, the tribunal found that there was consent to
ICSID arbitration,” because the so-called ‘Consolidation Agreement” concluded
between the Claimant and the Slovak Republic made explicit reference to the BIT
concluded between the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic, which in turn embodied
consent to ICSID arbitration. Thus, both the foreign investor and the host state agreed (by

virtue of the ‘Consolidation Agreement’) that disputes would be submitted to ICSID

See also a similar point of view in the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company case, where the Court, dealing with an issue of
MEN, stated: “In order that the United Kingdom may enjoy the benefit of any treaty concluded by Iran with a third
party by virtue of a most-favoured-nation clause contained in a treaty concluded by the United Kingdom with Iran,
the United Kingdom must be in a position to invoke the latter treaty. The treaty containing the most favoured-nation
clause is the basic treaty upon which the U.K. must rely. It is this treaty which establishes the juridical link between
the United Kingdom and a third-party treaty and confers upon that State the rights enjoyed by the third party. A third
party treaty, independent of and isolated from the basic treaty, cannot produce any legal effect as between the United
Kingdom and Iran: it is res inter alios acta”, Anglo-Iranian Oil Co. case (jurisdiction), Judgment of July 22nd,
1952: L.C.J. Reports 1952, p. 109.

regardless of the ratification or entry into force of the BIT.” To put it simply, there was a
mutual agreement between the foreign investor and the host state to have recourse to
ICSID arbitration. Such mutual agreement is exactly what is lacking in the present case.
There is no mutual agreement between the Claimant and Turkmenistan to have recourse

to ICSID arbitration as required by Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT.

The C.S.O.B. v. Slovakia decision cannot be used to justify the ‘importation’ of consent
to ICSID arbitration in a BIT that only provides for such consent under very specific
conditions. Had there not been a mutual agreement to have recourse to ICSID arbitration
(i.e., the absence of an investment contract explicitly incorporating the BIT between the
Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic), the C.S.O.B. v. Slovakia tribunal would have
found that it had no jurisdiction.* This is the approach that should have been retained by
the majority in the present case. An MFN clause in a BIT — even written in the same
terms as Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT — does not constitute consent to
ICSID arbitration and does not imply incorporation of consent to ICSID arbitration by
reference. An investment agreement or contract such as the ‘Consolidation Agreement’ in
C.S.0.B. v. Slovakia is a proper means of establishing consent to ICSID arbitration. An
MEN clause is not; it has neither the object and purpose nor the function of establishing
jurisdiction. To use by analogy the language of the C.S.O.B. v. Slovakia tribunal, an MFN

169

clause is not a “form of acceptance through which “ICSID jurisdiction can be

satisfied”.”°

Conclusions

71. In light of the aforementioned points, I conclude as follows:

i) Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT does not provide for ICSID arbitration
in the absence of a mutual agreement between the foreign investor and the host

state;

ii) There is no mutual agreement in writing between this Claimant and Turkmenistan
to resort to ICSID arbitration. As such, the requirement of consent in writing

under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention is not met;

iii) The MEN clause under Article 3(3) does not apply with respect to ICSID
arbitration when the conditions to have recourse to ICSID arbitration under
Article 8(2) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT are not fulfilled. As a matter of fact,
Article 8(2) explicitly states that the requirements of the ICSID Convention have
to be fulfilled;

iv) Without mutual agreement between the Claimant and the Respondent, only
UNCITRAL ad hoc arbitration is available to the Claimant under Article 8(2) of
the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT, and not ICSID arbitration;

v) The MEN clause contained in Article 3(3) of the U.K.-Turkmenistan BIT cannot
be interpreted as allowing the ‘import’ of consent to ICSID arbitration to a treaty

regime that does not contain such consent;

vi) No tribunal has concluded that an MEN clause could be used to ‘import’ consent

to ICSID arbitration or to international arbitration;71

7 Not even the RosInvest v. Russia tribunal. See, Rosinvest v. Russia, Arbitration under Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce, Award on Jurisdiction of October 2007.

31

vii)  Arbitral tribunals have exercised great caution when alluding to the possibility of
importing consent through an MFN clause.?2 The commentaries dealing with

U.K. Model BITs has never envisaged the plausibility of this scenario.73

In the light of the above, I do not reach the question of how the MFN clause should be

applied because in my view, it is not even applicable in the present case.
