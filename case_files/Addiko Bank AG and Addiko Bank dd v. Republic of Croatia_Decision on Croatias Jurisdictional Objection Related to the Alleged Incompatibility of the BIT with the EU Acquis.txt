INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’’) on the basis of the Agreement between the
Republic of Austria and the Republic of Croatia for the Promotion and Protection of
Investments, which entered into force on 1 November 1999 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”) and
the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of

Other States, dated 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimants are Addiko Bank AG, a company organized under the laws of the Republic
of Austria, and Addiko Bank d.d., a company organized under the laws of the Republic of

Croatia (together, ““Addiko” or the “Claimants”).

The Respondent is the Republic of Croatia (“‘Croatia” or the “Respondent”.

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute concerns Addiko’s issuance of loans denominated in Swiss francs to Croatian
consumers and businesses, and legislation enacted in the Republic of Croatia to convert the
denomination of those loans into Euros. The present ruling, however, concerns Croatia’s
assertion that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction pursuant to Article 11(2) of the BIT, which
states that “[t]he Contracting Parties are not bound by the present Agreement insofar as it
is incompatible with the legal acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given

time.”

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 21 December 2018, the European Commission (the “Commission”) filed with the
ICSID Secretariat its Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party, dated

20 December 2018 (the “Commission’s Application”).

Also on 21 December 2018, Croatia submitted its Preliminary Objection to Jurisdiction,
and Request to Suspend the Proceedings on the Merits (“Croatia’s Request” or “Resp.

Request”), including the following documents:

e Consolidated Index of Supporting Documentation filed with Croatia’s pleadings as at

21 December 2018;
e Exhibits R-0001 through R-0005; and
e Legal Authorities RLM-0001 through RLM-0032.

On 24 December 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their observations on the
Commission’s Application using a simultaneous filing procedure on 11 January 2019,
which is also the day on which the procedural calendar at Annex B of Procedural Order

No. 1 called for Addiko to submit its Response to Croatia’s Request.

Prior to the filing of these submissions, Croatia sought leave from the Tribunal on 31
December 2018 to submit into the record of this proceeding, in support of its Request, the
Decision on Bifurcation in Raiffeisen Bank AG and Raiffeisenbank d.d. v. Republic of
Croatia (ICSID Case No. ARB/17/34) (“Raiffeisen”). On 3 January 2019, Addiko
indicated that it had no objection to Croatia’s submission of the Decision on Bifurcation in
Raiffeisen. On 4 January 2019, the Tribunal granted Croatia’s request, and Croatia
submitted it as RLM-0033.

On 11 January 2019, Addiko filed both its Observations on the Commission’s Application
(“Addiko’s Observations”) and its Response to Croatia’s Request (the “Response’’).
Croatia also filed its Observations on the Commission’s Application (“Croatia’s

Observations’”’).

Following these submissions, on 17 January 2019, Croatia submitted a letter to the Tribunal
regarding seeking leave to submit three additional documents in support of Croatia’s
Request: (i) the declaration by 22 Member States of the European Union (“EU”) on the

legal consequences of the Judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union

(“CJEU”) in the Achmea case (“Achmea”);! (ii) the declaration by five EU Member States
on the legal consequences of Achmea; and (iii) the declaration by Hungary on the legal
consequences of Achmea (collectively, the “Declarations”). The next day, on 18 January
2019, Addiko indicated that it had no objection to the introduction of the Declarations into
the record. On 21 January 2019, the Tribunal granted on consent leave to submit the
Declarations, and Croatia submitted them into the record the following day as RLM-41

through RLM-43.

12. Also on 21 January 2019, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2 in which it, inter
alia, granted the Commission leave to make a written submission as a non-disputing party;
declined Croatia’s Request to suspend the proceedings on the merits; and determined to
accelerate consideration of Croatia’s preliminary objection related to the compatibility of
the BIT with the acquis under Article 11(2) (the “accelerated issue”). In Procedural Order
No. 2, the Tribunal also granted Addiko’s request for production of “documents reflecting
the occurrence of status of any State-to-State ‘dialogue’ that may have taken place under
Article 11(3) of the BIT,”? a request that Addiko made during the briefing on Croatia’s
Request. In granting the request for production, the Tribunal invited Addiko to indicate by
28 January 2019 “any other disclosure that it contends would be material to the discrete

legal issue accelerated for resolution.”

13. Consequently, on 28 January 2019, Addiko made additional requests for production. First,
Addiko requested that Croatia “produce documents created, sent or received by Croatia
regarding the status of the BIT or the compatibility of the BIT with the acquis regardless
of whether these documents expressly refer to Article 11(3) of the BIT.” Second, Addiko
requested that Croatia “produce documents created, sent or received by Croatia, including
documents sent to or received from the European Commission, regarding the
Commission’s application for leave to intervene as a non-disputing party in [this]
arbitration and/or [the declarations].” Third, given Croatia’s reliance on the Declarations,

Addiko requested their travaux préparatoires.

' Case C-284/16, Slowakische Republik v. Achmea B.V., Judgment (6 March 2018), RLM-12.
? Article 11(3) of the BIT provides that “[i]n case of uncertainties concerning the effects of paragraph 2 of this Article
the Contracting Parties will enter a dialogue.”

On 4 February 2019, the Commission submitted its Amicus Curiae Brief (the “Commission

Submission’).

Also on 4 February 2019, Croatia submitted its opposition to Addiko’s requests for
production of 28 January 2019, on the ground that they were overbroad and neither material
nor relevant to the accelerated issue. Croatia contended that Addiko’s purported
justification for the additional requests for production—that the Commission’s intervention
and the Declarations are the result of political expedience and pressure—was without merit
and in any event concerned an inquiry into the actions of the Commission and the Member
States of the European Union and not those of Croatia, as the Respondent in this
proceeding. To this latter point, Croatia noted that an inquiry into inter-State exchanges

may raise confidentiality issues.

Croatia also requested an extension of time until 25 February 2019 to produce documents,
given that the Parties had agreed to, and the Tribunal had accepted, a one-week extension

of the deadline for first round submissions on the accelerated issue.

On 5 February 2019, the Tribunal, having received confirmation of both Parties’
availability, confirmed that a hearing on the accelerated issue would be held in Washington,

D.C. on 20 August and 21 August 2019.

On 13 February 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, denying Addiko’s
additional requests for production and granting Croatia’s request for an extension of time

until 25 February 2019 to produce documents.

On 29 March 2019, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Croatia submitted its
Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction (“Resp. Mem.”), including the following

documents:

e Legal Opinion of Professor Paul Craig (Hon QC), dated 29 March 2019 (“Craig
Opinion”);

e Index of the Legal Authorities to Professor Paul Craig’s Expert Opinion, with Legal
Authorities PC-0001 through PC-0060;

29 March 2019);

Exhibits R-0032 through R-0038; and

Legal Authorities RLM-0001 through RLM-0165.

Also on 29 March 2019, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Addiko submitted its
Submission on Croatia’s Preliminary Objections to Jurisdiction (“Cl. Mem.”), including

the following documents:

Legal Opinion of Sir Francis Jacobs KCMG, QC (“Jacobs Opinion’), with Exhibits FJ-
0001 through FJ-0033;

Consolidated Index of Supporting Documentation Filed with Addiko’s Pleadings (as at
29 March 2019);

Exhibits C-0222 through C-0226; and

Legal Authorities CLM-0145 through CLM-0184.

On 7 June 2019, Addiko filed their Reply Submission on Croatia’s Preliminary Objections

to Jurisdiction (“Cl. Reply”), including the following documents:

Supplemental Legal Opinion by Sir Francis Jacobs KCMG, QC (‘Jacobs Supp.
Opinion’), with Exhibits FJ-0034 through FJ-0045; and

Legal Authorities CLM-0185 through CLM-0197.

On the same date, Croatia filed its Reply to Addiko’s Submission on its Preliminary

Objections to Jurisdiction (“Resp. Reply”), including the following documents:

Second Expert Opinion of Professor Paul Craig (Hon QC) (“Craig Supp. Opinion”),
with an Index of Legal Authorities to Professor Paul Craig’s Second Expert Opinion

and Legal Authorities PC-0061 through PC-0066;

e Exhibits R-0039 through R-0041; and

e Legal Authorities RLM-0166 through RLM-0176.

23. On 30 July 2019, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the Parties

by telephone conference.

24. On 2 August 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5° concerning the

organization of the hearing on the accelerated issue.

25. A hearing on the accelerated issue was held in Washington D.C. from 20 August 2019 to

21 August 2019 (the “Hearing”). The following persons were present at the Hearing:

27. On 26 August 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 74 confirming the schedule

for post-hearing submissions on the accelerated issue.

28. The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 18 October 2019 (Cl. PHB1” and
“Resp. PHB1,” respectively), and simultaneous reply post-hearing briefs on 22 November

2019 (“Cl. PHB2” and “Resp. PHB2,” respectively).
29. On 20 December 2019, each Party filed a submission on costs.

30. On 1 May 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15,° which addressed inter alia
the production into the record of this proceeding of a recent decision in another ICSID
arbitration against Croatia under the Austria-Croatia BIT (the “UniCredit 2020
Decision”).° The record had long included an earlier decision in that case (the “UniCredit
2018 Decision”),’ and in light of the Parties’ prior advice that the UniCredit 2018 Decision
was the subject of a pending reconsideration request, the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No.
5 had ordered Croatia to produce a copy of the reconsideration decision when it became
available.® In Procedural Order No. 15, the Tribunal directed Croatia to produce in this

case only a redacted version of the UniCredit 2020 Decision, to address certain stated

ues unrelated to the accelerated issue.

concerns about confidentiality.? At the same time, the Tribunal advised that it already was
“well on its way to producing” the instant decision, and was “not waiting for access” to the

UniCredit 2020 Decision to complete its work. '°

On 29 May 2020, the Tribunal noted with disappointment that it had not yet received the
redacted version of the UniCredit 2020 Decision, despite the passage of four weeks from
Procedural Order No. 15, but reiterated that it would not defer issuing this ruling (which it
was almost ready to issue) to await that authority. Later that day, Croatia submitted the

redacted UniCredit 2020 Decision, which has now been added to the record of this case.!!

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The summary below is intended to frame the issues presented by the Parties, not to be an
exhaustive summary of all their assertions or all authorities they invoke in support. The
absence of reference to particular assertions or authorities should not be taken as an
indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters. The Tribunal has carefully

considered all arguments submitted to it in connection with the accelerated issue.

PRINCIPLES REGARDING THE DETERMINATION OF JURISDICTION
(dd) Burden of Proof
The Parties have set out their positions on the threshold issue of who bears the burden of
proving the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.
a. Croatia’s Position

Croatia asserts that it is “accepted international practice” that Addiko bears the onus to
establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention.'? This

is particularly so, Croatia says, as the Contracting Parties to the BIT made an offer to

° Procedural Order No. 15, 17.

© Procedural Order No. 15, { 13.

"! UniCredit 2020 Decision, RLM-271.
2 Resp. Mem. 5.

arbitrate only a limited category of claims regarding investments that meet specific

conditions."

35. Specifically, Croatia asserts that Addiko has failed to prove that the conditions for the
“Application of the Agreement” enshrined in Article 11 of the BIT are fulfilled. According
to Croatia, Article 11(2) of the BIT subordinates the BIT to the EU acquis in force at any
given time, yet Addiko has failed to explain how its claims and the arbitration clause at

Article 9 of the BIT are compatible with the EU acquis.'4

36. Croatia also states that Addiko has not established the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under
consented under the BIT to submit the Addiko’s claims to the Centre. The essential
requirement of written consent under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention has thus not been

satisfied. !5

b. Addiko’s Position

37. Addiko considers that neither party bears the burden of establishing the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.'!° Addiko points to jurisprudence from the International Court of Justice
(ICJ’) and ICSID to illustrate that while each Party bears the burden of proving the facts
on which it relies, the existence of jurisdiction is a “legal determination reserved for the
Tribunal” based on the facts presented and the parties’ legal arguments.'’ This approach
is consistent, Addiko says, “with the principle that the Tribunal is entitled to determine the
extent of its own jurisdiction and with other principles of international law such as iura

novit curia.”'® Quoting the ICJ, Addiko states that “[t]here is no burden of proof to be

 

discharged in the matter of jurisdiction.” !?

38. In the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal asked “[w]hether Article 11(2) of
the BIT anticipates that the issue of alleged incompatibility with the EU acquis should be
decided de novo by an arbitral tribunal otherwise empaneled pursuant to Article 9 of the
BIT, or alternatively envisions some form of deference on this issue to the views of the EU

292
courts?”

a. Croatia’s Position

39. Croatia asserts that Article 11(2) “not only envisions but mandates deference to the CJEU’s
binding interpretations of EU law.”?! The deference reflected in Article 11(2) is
“particularly relevant if the CJEU has specifically adjudicated the question before the
Tribunal.”?? Because (in Croatia’s view) the CJEU’s Achmea Judgment “removed any
uncertainty about the incompatibility of arbitration clauses in intra-7EU BITS” with the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (the “TFEU”), and “conclusively
determined that Article 9 of the BIT is incompatible with—at the very least—Articles 267
and 344 of the TFEU,” the Tribunal “cannot in good faith adopt a different
interpretation,” and “it would be ultra vires for this Tribunal ... to overrule or fail to

apply the CJEU’s determinative finding ....”*4

b. Addiko’s Position

40. For Addiko, the Tribunal is “not only permitted, but indeed required, to determine the
extent of its jurisdiction de novo,” and “owes no deference under international law to the
views of the CJEU or the European Commission.”® Article 41(1) of the ICSID

Convention, which provides that “[t]he Tribunal shall be the judge of its own competence,”

makes this plain.” In its view, “Article 11(2) does not, and cannot, displace the basic
principle of international adjudication that an international court or tribunal is always the
judge of its own jurisdiction.”?” Addiko thus rejects any suggestion that Article 11(2)
“somehow created a carve-out from the Tribunal’s acknowledged competence-
competence.”?® Nor does Achmea override the Tribunal’s mandate to examine and
establish its own jurisdiction de novo. In Addiko’s view, Achmea does not reach the issues
in this case, nor even purport to engage in the public international law analysis of
compatibility required by the BIT; in any event, Achmea is “plainly not binding on this

Tribunal.”

(3) Date of Determination of Jurisdiction

In Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal also asked, “As of what date does Article 11(2) of
the BIT anticipate that the issue of alleged incompatibility with the EU acquis be assessed,
including inter alia, (i) the date of Croatia’s accession, (ii) the date of the investor’s request
for arbitration or ICSID registration of such a request, or (iii) the date of a tribunal’s

decision?”*° The Parties’ respective answers to this question follow.

a. Croatia’s Position

For Croatia, “incompatibility should be assessed as at the date the claim is filed.” Relying
on ICSID Institution Rule 6(2) that states that a proceeding is instituted as of the date of its

registration, the relevant date for this proceeding is 27 September 2017.*!

However, for Croatia, the date as of which incompatibility is assessed must be
distinguished from the question of when the BIT became incompatible with the EU acquis.
According to Croatia, it is obvious that “in making its case on jurisdiction before a tribunal,

a claimant cannot rely on the registration of its claim as proof that an agreement to arbitrate

was established upon registration.”*? Croatia states that the BIT has been incompatible with
the EU acquis from the moment that it acceded to the TFEU on 1 July 2013, and thus when
the case was registered on 27 September 2017, the BIT already was incompatible with the

EU acquis.

b. Addiko’s Position

Addiko responds that the BIT’s compatibility with the EU acquis is to be assessed as of
the date of ICSID’s registration of the request for arbitration. It reasons that the
international law “critical date” doctrine, applied by both the ICJ and investment tribunals
(including those constituted under the ICSID Convention), calls for determination of
jurisdiction as on the date of institution of proceedings, such that any subsequent lapse or
withdrawal of the jurisdictional instrument has no effect on the jurisdiction of the forum.**
Addiko’s position, as stated in the hearing, is that it obtained a “vested right [...] to arbitrate
under this Agreement, after consent ha[d] actually been perfected at the critical date.”*>
Since ICSID Institution Rule 6(2) states that a proceeding is instituted on the date of
registration of the request, and the Parties agree that registration occurred on 27 September
2017, the arbitration agreement between Addiko and Croatia cannot be vitiated on any
grounds which arose after that “critical date.” In Addiko’s view, this would apply to
Croatia’s arguments about incompatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis under either
Achmea or the Declarations, since each of those were issued after registration of Addiko’s

request for arbitration.*°

(4) Status of Croatia’s Consent to Arbitration
a. Croatia’s Position

Croatia argues that consent is irrevocable only to the extent that it is actually given. Croatia
reasons that since Article 11(2) relieves the Contracting Parties from BIT obligations
incompatible with the EU acquis in force, and the BIT was incompatible as of Croatia’s
accession to the EU Treaties in July 2013, then Article 9 of the BIT was not binding on
Croatia from that date forward. Accordingly, Croatia argues that there was no “irrevocable”

offer to arbitrate that Addiko could have validly accepted by initiating this arbitration.*’

This is so even in the absence of Achmea, according to Croatia, because the Tribunal still
would have had to determine compatibility with the EU acquis pursuant to Article 11(2),
and the underlying TFEU provisions were already in place even absent the CJEU’s
eventual interpretation of them in Achmea. However, now that Achmea has rendered, and
given that EU Member States are bound by the CJEU’s interpretation of the TFEU, this
Tribunal can benefit from that interpretation in the specific context of intra-EU bilateral

investment treaties.**

b. Addiko’s Position

Addiko argues that Article 9(2)(a) of the BIT*? irrevocably binds the Contracting Parties
to maintain their offer to arbitrate with investors such as Addiko, with the consequence that
Croatia’s consent to arbitration is not subject to subsequent events.*° Addiko also relies on
the UniCredit 2018 Decision for this proposition, where the tribunal stated “the language
... does not admit the operation either explicitly or implicitly of any subsequent events ...
the language of Article 9 negates certain further potential conditions, including the

requirement that there by a specific arbitration agreement between the parties or any prior

* Article 9(2)(a) of the BIT provides in relevant part that “[iJn case of arbitration, each Contracting Party, by this
Agreement irrevocably consents in advance, even in the absence of an individual arbitral agreement between the
Contracting Party and the investor, to submit any such dispute to this Centre.”

4° Cl. Mem. {ff 100-101, 103; Cl. Reply 15. Addiko also relies on the preparatory works on the ICSID Convention
where Aron Broches emphasized principles of irrevocability of consent. C. H. Schreuer et al., The ICSID Convention:
A Commentary, 2nd ed. 2009, at p. 230, CLM-183.

exhaustion of remedies.”*! Addiko also points to Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention,
which prevents States from withdrawing their consent unilaterally after investors have

t."? Addiko therefore concludes that since Croatia consented to

given their own consent
arbitration on the date of the BIT, and Addiko consented to arbitration on the date of
institution of proceedings, a subsequent event cannot abrogate the irrevocable consent of

the parties to this arbitration.**

48. For Addiko, this is unaffected by Article 11(2) of the BIT which, Addiko argues, calls for
compatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis to be assessed based on the state of the
acquis in force at the “legally relevant” point in time, which for jurisdictional issues would
be the date as determined by the critical date doctrine. Addiko also argues that Article
11(2) of the BIT must be interpreted in light of both the principle of effectiveness,*> and
the BIT’s object and purpose of promotion and protection of investments,“ as safeguarding
a tribunal’s jurisdiction by freezing the acquis to that in force at the time proceedings are
instituted.*” In its view, the phrase “at any given time” in Article 11(2) of the BIT could
not have been intended to allow State parties to escape responsibility based on
developments in the acquis postdating the institution of proceedings. Addiko stresses that
the principle of good faith should govern the analysis of these issues as they relate to

Croatia’s consent to arbitration.“*

IMPACT OF ARTICLE 11(2) OF THE BIT
(wD Croatia’s Position

It is Croatia’s position that the ordinary meaning of Article 11(2) of the BIT is clear and
should be interpreted in light of this meaning pursuant to Article 30 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”).*? For Croatia, there can be no doubt that
the article unequivocally refers to the EU acquis in force at any given time. Thus, Croatia

is not “bound” by the BIT insofar as it is incompatible with the EU acquis.

According to Croatia, the meaning of Article 11(2) is further supported by the context and
purpose of the provision to resolve any conflicts between the BIT and the Contracting
Parties’ obligations under the acquis.*° Indeed, Croatia submits that Article 11(2) was
included in the BIT to resolve precisely the conflict of norms now faced by this Tribunal,
and to ensure that the Contracting Parties to the BIT would comply “at any given time”
with their international legal obligations pursuant to EU Treaties.*! Croatia also argues that
Addiko cannot have more rights under the BIT than those to which the Republic of Austria

agreed.>*

For Croatia, it is uncontroverted that States can determine the priority of treaties in force
between them, and no rule of public international law restricts them from so regulating the
priority of norms in force between them. Both the Contracting Parties to this BIT and all
Contracting Parties to EU treaties are unanimous in their agreement that EU Treaties

prevail over treaties such as this BIT.**

Croatia adds that if the Tribunal does not consider Article 11(2) to be dispositive, the same

result (that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction) in any event should result from the default

conflicts rule set out in Article 30 of the VCLT, regarding the application of successive

treaties relating to the same subject matter.**

Finally, Croatia warns that ICSID case law (such as Caratube v. Kazakhstan) confirms that
any award rendered by a tribunal exercising jurisdiction beyond the consent of the parties

would be subject to annulment.>>

(2) Addiko’s Position

Addiko disagrees with Croatia about the impact of Article 11(2) on the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. For Addiko, Article 11(2) of the BIT has no impact on the established position
under international law that a tribunal is always the judge of its own competence; as a
result, the Tribunal has the power to interpret the instrument of consent, and must
determine the issue of “incompatibility” based on international law principles, not based

on the pronouncements of EU States or institutions.*°

In response to Croatia’s alternative argument on the application of VCLT conflict rules,
Addiko notes that investment treaty tribunals consistently have found that intra-EU BITs
and EU Treaties do not have the same subject matter. Accordingly, neither VCLT Article
30 nor VCLT Article 59 (regarding the termination or suspension of the operation of a
treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty) have any application. By their terms, both
Article 30 and Article 59 apply only when successive treaties address the same subject-

matter.

Addiko criticizes Croatia for attempting to circumvent these VCLT provisions by seeking
to elevate Article 11(2) of the BIT into a special clause that negates any need to resort to
these default interpretive rules in the first place.*” In Addiko’s view, Article 11(2) requires
the same test of compatibility as these VCLT provisions, since it is inherent in the notion

of “incompatibility” (expressed in Article 11(2) of the BIT) that treaties must have the

same subject matter in order even possibly to be incompatible. Because the BIT and the
EU Treaties do not have the same subject matter, Addiko argues that this disposes of the
question under either Article 11(2) or the VCLT, without even needing to reach the second

element of alleged “incompatibility.”°*

COMPATIBILITY ANALYSIS UNDER ARTICLE 11(2) OF THE BIT

Having argued the relevance of Article 11(2) to the jurisdictional analysis, the Parties turn
to the issue of compatibility. Croatia’s premise, which forms the basis for this accelerated
issue, is that Article 11(2) allegedly vitiates the Tribunal’s jurisdiction due to the
incompatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis. Croatia argues that both the BIT’s
arbitration clause (Article 9) and its substantive treatment standards are incompatible with
the acquis.*? Addiko argues that there is no incompatibility with respect to either the BIT’s

procedural or substantive provisions.

However, prior to addressing these issues, the Parties address both the standard of
“incompatibility” and the weight to be given to decisions of other arbitral tribunals,
constituted under bilateral investment treaties as well as the Energy Charter Treaty

(“ECT”), which have examined the compatibility of intra-EU investment arbitration.

() Standard of Compatibility
a. Croatia’s Position

On the “standard of compatibility,” Croatia argues that by Addiko’s own submission,
incompatibility arises when complying with one treaty leads to the infringement of another.
Using this “strict” definition of incompatibility, Croatia argues that if Article 11(2) of the
BIT is not given effect, and this Tribunal upholds jurisdiction, both Croatia and Austria

would be in breach of their obligations under the EU Treaties.°!

b. Addiko’s Position

Addiko argues that “compatibility” has an ordinary meaning which calls for same analysis
conducted by numerous other arbitral tribunals which have considered this issue under
Article 59 of the VCLT. Under this analysis, as explained below through the lens of prior

case law, the BIT is not incompatible with EU law.

(2) Import of Other Arbitrations with Similar Issues

Croatia contends that the numerous other arbitral decisions Addiko cites, as upholding
jurisdiction in intra-EU disputes and finding no incompatibility between various
investment treaties and the EU acquis, must be disregarded. In Croatia’s view, the prior
cases are either (a) inapposite to the analysis under Article 11(2) of the BIT, which is
unique, or (b) were wrongly decided, in the case of UniCredit which examined Article
11(2) of the same BIT.© Addiko contends by contrast that the analysis of prior tribunals is

instructive.

a. Croatia’s Position

First, Croatia argues in general terms why this Tribunal must not rely on the decisions of
prior tribunals. Second, Croatia discusses and rebuts the post-Achmea cases on which
Addiko relies, and discusses extensively the UniCredit 2018 Decision rendered under the

same BIT as at issue here

(i) General Objections to other Arbitral Case Law

First, Croatia notes that unlike prior arbitrations involving intra-EU BITs, with the
exception of the UniCredit case,® this Tribunal need not undertake an extensive public
international law analysis of compatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis. Instead,

the ordinary, and “clearly drafted,” Article 11(2) of the BIT must be interpreted in

compliance with Article 31(1) of the VCLT which sets out general rules of interpretation
for treaties.©° Therefore, Croatia argues that any analysis by other tribunals considering
treaties with no specific conflict clause such as Article 11(2) of the BIT are irrelevant. For
this reason, Croatia argues that Addiko’s reliance on such case law obfuscates the matter

before this Tribunal.°”

Second, Croatia argues that Addiko’s position that Article 11(2) of the BIT and Article 30
of the VCLT both call for the application of the “same subject-matter” test is incorrect.
Rather, Article 30 of the VCLT does not rightly apply in this context, as it is to be employed
only in the absence of an express conflict clause such as Article 11(2) of the BIT and even
if Article 30 of the VCLT did apply, the notion that it imposes a predicate “same subject

matter” test is based on an “erroneous interpretation.”

Third, Croatia argues that Addiko’s reliance on arbitral jurisprudence to support a
restrictive interpretation of both the EU acquis and the Achmea Judgment exposes the risk
sought to be avoided by both Article 11(2) of the BIT and the EU acquis. Croatia reasons
that any reliance on prior cases leads (i) to rendering of awards incompatible with
respondent-EU Member States’ international legal obligations under the EU Treaties, and
(ii) to the creation of authority to override the CJEU’s binding interpretations of the EU
Treaties. Croatia cautions that these issues pose a double risk to the autonomy of the EU

legal order envisaged by Achmea and recognized by the Declarations.”

(ti) Case-specific Objections to other Arbitral Case Law

Croatia argues that Addiko misrepresents the arbitral case law it invokes as purportedly
supportive of the proposition that intra-EU bilateral investment treaties are “fully

compatible” with the EU acquis. For Croatia, on closer examination of the case law, it

becomes evident that the findings of these cases are “fragmented,” in that there is no

consensus or uniformity among the tribunals, which in fact have found different ways to

reject jurisdictional objections such as Croatia’s.”°

67. Croatia focuses on those awards, seven in number, which were rendered after Achmea. Of
these, Croatia notes that only three were under intra-EU bilateral investment treaties,

whereas the rest were under the ECT.”!

68. With respect to Antin v. Spain, Croatia argues that the tribunal there was concerned with
an objection that it had no jurisdiction rationae personae, and in fact refrained from
addressing the compatibility issue. The tribunal stated that this was an issue to be sorted

out by the EU and the EU Member States parties to the ECT.”

69. As for Greentech Energy Systems v. Spain, Croatia argues that the tribunal in that case held
that both EU law and Achmea were irrelevant for its decision, and therefore did not address

the compatibility issue either.

70. Croatia observes that in Marfin v. Cyprus, the tribunal had decided it would address
compatibility only if it found that the that the Cyprus-Greece Bilateral Investment Treaty
and the EU Treaties concerned the same subject-matter. Since the tribunal found no such
“same subject-matter,” it did not further examine incompatibility issues between the treaty

and EU law.”

In Vattenfall v. Germany, Croatia says the tribunal did not even touch on the compatibility
issue. because it held that EU law did not apply to the ECT provision at issue. That case,

according to Croatia, was “highly specific to the ECT.””°

As for UP and C.D Holding v. Hungary, Croatia argues that the tribunal there merely held
that it did not consider a detailed discussion of Achmea to be relevant because the case
differed “in determinative aspects” from Achmea, particularly insofar as Achmea did not
mention ICSID arbitration. Thus, the tribunal avoided addressing the incompatibility

issue.7°

In Eskosol v. Italy, Croatia submits that the tribunal abstained from ruling on the
compatibility issue and instead rejected jurisdictional objections on the basis of the ECT’s
applicable law provision and the “same subject-matter” requirement of Article 30 of the
VCLT. Croatia notes that, as to Achmea, the tribunal held that it was inapplicable as it did

not refer to multilateral treaties such as the ECT.”
Finally, as to the UniCredit 2018 Decision, Croatia makes extensive arguments.”*

First, Croatia argues that despite its having raised objections of incompatibility between
the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, the tribunal in UniCredit never once
referred to these Articles in rejecting Croatia’s jurisdictional objections.”? Croatia
emphasizes that the EU acquis cannot be reduced to Achmea and, instead, Article 11(2) of
the BIT calls for comprehensive analysis of the EU Treaties in their entirety.*° This is
especially so, Croatia says, because nothing in public international law precludes States

from establishing a hierarchy among treaties.*!

76. Second, Croatia states that the tribunal in UniCredit wrongly rejected application of the
principle of ex tunc effect of CJEU decisions. Croatia argues that instead of considering
the phrase “at any given time” in Article 11(2) of the BIT as meaning the EU acquis in
force at the legally relevant time, the phrase calls for the commonplace diplomatic
understanding of the EU acquis to mean the entire body of obligations under the EU

Treaties. **

77. Third, Croatia argues that the UniCredit 2018 Decision unduly relied on the principle of
“legitimate expectations” to excuse any ex tunc application of Achmea. For Croatia, this
approach is unsupported in the EU acquis and the case law.*° Croatia further notes that
neither the claimant in that case nor its legal expert provided a basis for the use of this
principle.** Croatia also emphasizes that the only case that the tribunal relied on, ironically

also a CJEU decision, also rejected application of the principle of legitimate expectations.*>

78. Fourth, Croatia argues that the principle of legitimate expectations is not a part of general
public international law. While there may be a basis for the application of legitimate
expectations to a merits analysis under the principle of “fair and equitable treatment,” that
principle was not applicable in UniCredit where the tribunal was concerned with access to
dispute resolution, not merits issues. *° In addition, Croatia argues that any application of
the principle of legitimate expectations would be fickle, since at the time that arbitration
was registered, doubt already had been cast on the compatibility of intra-EU bilateral

investment treaties with the EU acquis.*”

79. Fifth, Croatia argues that the UniCredit tribunal inexplicably rejected the relevance of EU
law despite clear reference to it in Article 11(2) of the BIT. 88 This, Croatia argues, was

also the case in the tribunal’s incorrect finding that the lack of an express mention of Article

9 in Article 11(2) of the BIT implies an ambiguity in the compatibility analysis with respect
to the BIT’s arbitration provision.® Croatia also questions the tribunal’s decision to use
the alleged “object and purpose” of the treaty to override the clear terms of Article 11(2)
of the BIT, thereby violating Article 31(1) of the VCLT.”

80. Sixth, and finally, Croatia argues that the tribunal erred in holding that a finding of
incompatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis would obviate the sunset provision in
Article 12 of the BIT. Croatia argues that such an understanding is unsupported in the
VCLT, which contemplates the possibility of one treaty suspending another. At any rate,
Croatia argues that Article 70 of the VCLT allows parties to agree on alternate methods for

terminating a treaty, which has happened here by way of the Declarations.”!

b. Addiko’s Position

81. Addiko relies on numerous arbitral decisions regarding the compatibility issue and urges
this Tribunal to follow suit. In this regard, Addiko argues that the arbitral case law

establishes compatibility between the BIT and Article 267 and 344 of the TFEU.

82. First, Addiko argues that there is no reason to depart from the 23 decisions declining

preliminary objections that intra-EU BITs allegedly are incompatible with the EU acquis.”

For Addiko, no matter Croatia’s position on this case law, it cannot be contested that these
tribunals confirmed “full compatibility” of intra-EU treaties with EU law under

fundamental principles of international law.”

83. It is Addiko’s position that the persuasive effect of these numerous cases is unimpacted by
Article 11(2) of the BIT, since the analysis called for by Article 11(2) of the BIT is identical
to the “same subject-matter” standard applied by other tribunals under Articles 30(3) and

59 of the VCLT.*

84. Addiko also agrees with tribunals that have found there could be no incompatibility
because the BIT and the EU Treaties do not address the same subject matter. Addiko adds
that, even if the BIT and the EU acquis were considered to have the same subject-matter,
the earlier of the two only could be rendered inapplicable (by VCLT Article 30(3)) or
terminated (by VCLT Article 59) if the two treaties were found to be incompatible.
Incompatibility in this context calls for a situation where compliance with one treaty

necessarily leads to a breach of the other.

85. Second, Addiko relies on prior arbitral rulings to argue that there is no incompatibility
between the arbitration provision in the BIT and Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.*
Addiko states that these provisions of the TFEU do not create a “jurisdiction monopoly”

for the CJEU which prevents other tribunals from applying EU law.*° Finally, Addiko

D. EU DECLARATIONS

86. Member States of the European Union adopted three declarations®® (together, the

“Declarations”) on the consequences and enforcement of the CJEU judgment in Achmea.
87. The Declarations state:

[A]ll investor-State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral
investment treaties concluded between Member States are contrary
to [European] Union law and thus inapplicable.”

88. Croatia argues that the Declarations unequivocally demonstrate that “all 28 EU Member
States agree that the Achmea Judgment precludes all arbitration clauses in intra-EU
BITs,”!™ a conclusion premised on the incompatibility between all intra-EU BITs and the
EU acquis.'°! Consequently, the instant BIT, and especially its Article 9, is incompatible
with the EU acquis. Croatia further submits that the Declarations are themselves a
component part of the EU acquis and consequently are authoritative and binding on this

Tribunal.'”

() The Declarations’ Effect on Compatibility Between Article 9 of the BIT and
the Acquis

a. Croatia’s Position

In the first place, Croatia relies on the wording of the Declarations to argue that since “all”
investor-State arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs have been deemed incompatible with
the TFEU (and hence the EU acquis), Article 9 of the BIT is itself incompatible with the
EU acquis,'™ and accordingly, the incompatibility foreseen in Article 11(2) of the BIT is
fulfilled.

Croatia also says that the Declarations confirm its interpretation of Achmea, namely that
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU preclude investor-State arbitration clauses in intra-EU
BITs. Croatia places specific emphasis on the unanimity among the EU Member States in
this regard.'°° Noting Addiko’s view that the Member States were not unanimous on the
compatibility issue, Croatia cautions that this was only with regard to compatibility of the

ECT with the acquis, not with respect to intra-EU BITs.'°°

Next, Croatia posits that incompatibility as established in the Declarations is effective from
the date of Croatia’s accession to the EU Treaties and its membership in the EU, i.e., 1 July
2013. For this, Croatia relies on the allegedly “unequivocal” statement in the Declarations

that no valid offer of arbitration could be extended by Member States of the EU.!°”

Croatia says this finding is confirmed in the decision of the German Federal Supreme
Court, the Bundesgerichtshof, which set aside the award in Achmea. This decision is
deemed by Croatia to be prima facie evidence of incompatibility between the BIT at issue
in Achmea (a BIT between the Netherlands and Slovakia) and the EU acquis. Croatia
highlights that the Bundesgerichtshof set aside the award on this ground despite the CJEU’s
judgment regarding incompatibility having been rendered after the claim was filed,

indicating that incompatibility was understood to run from the date of accession of the

relevant Member State to the EU, and not simply from the date of the CJEU’s judgment.
On this basis, Croatia concludes that the Declarations confirm that the BIT was
incompatible with the EU acquis from the date of Croatia’s accession to the EU, i.e., 1 July

2013. 198

Last, Croatia calls on the text common to all Declarations that the Member States undertook
to “inform investment arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences of the Achmea ...
in all pending intra-EU investment arbitration proceedings” to argue the particular

relevance of the Declarations in the present proceeding. !°

b. Addiko’s Position

Addiko does not speak to the impact that any of the Declarations have on the compatibility
between the BIT and the EU acquis. Instead, Addiko argues that this Tribunal must pay no
heed to the Declarations as they are irrelevant to its analysis of its jurisdiction under Article

9 of the BIT. Therefore, Addiko confines its arguments to those summarized below. 110

(2) Whether the Declarations Are Binding on this Tribunal
a. Croatia’s Position

Croatia argues that the Declarations are authoritative, binding this Tribunal to follow their

interpretation of the BIT and the TFEU.!!!

First, Croatia relies on the Eur-Lex Glossary !!” to demonstrate that the definition of the
“EU acquis” includes “declarations and resolutions adopted by the [European] Union.”
Accordingly, Croatia argues that this Tribunal is bound by the Declarations, as Article

11(2) mandates this Tribunal to apply the EU acquis.'"3

98. Although Addiko argues that the EU Member States, even collectively, are “not an
institution of the EU” for purposes of the definition of the EU acquis, Croatia disagrees
because the Member States who signed the declarations acted within the powers of the EU
and the Council of the EU (an EU institution), whose declarations are part of the EU acquis.
To substantiate this argument, Croatia underscores that the Declarations were signed by
the Member States in Brussels through their respective ambassadors to the EU or an

equivalent EU body.!!4

99. Second, Croatia draws the Tribunal’s attention to Article 11(3) of the BIT, also relied on
by Addiko. Croatia argues that since Article 11(3) of the BIT calls for the Contracting
Parties of the BIT to enter into a dialogue regarding any uncertainty about the effects of
Article 11(2) of the BIT, the Declarations reflect the common position of both Austria and

Croatia on the effect of incompatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis.''°

100. Third, Croatia argues that the Declarations evidence the organization of mutual treaty
obligations of both Austria and Croatia — i.e., “[European] Union law takes precedence
over bilateral investment treaties concluded between Member States.” This, Croatia argues,
is within their sovereign rights, with which this Tribunal cannot interfere. Croatia observes
in this regard that a hierarchy between EU law and the BIT is not novel.!'® Instead, it is
present in both Article 4(3) of the TFEU!" and in the EU “Declaration on Primacy,”!!®
which must be treated as an authoritative and binding interpretation of the Treaty of Lisbon
under VCLT Article 31(2)(a). In other words, Croatia argues that the Declarations’
subordination of the BIT to the EU acquis is well supported, and therefore authoritative for

this Tribunal to follow.'!®

101. Fourth, Croatia argues that the Declarations are a “subsequent agreement between the
parties (Croatia and Austria) regarding the interpretation of the treaty (BIT) of the
application of its provisions” under VCLT Article 31(3)(a), which sets out general rules of
treaty interpretation. Accordingly, Croatia argues, the Declarations are binding on this

Tribunal. Croatia further argues, relying on scholarship, !”°

that the interpretation afforded
by the Declarations is both prospective and retrospective, leading to the conclusion that

this Tribunal is bound by the supremacy of EU law established by the Declarations. !?!

102. Croatia characterizes as hyper-formalistic and manifestly absurd Addiko’s argument that
the failure of any mention of the BIT in the Declarations deprives them of any significance
for the purposes of VCLT Article 31(3)(a).!?? Rather, for Croatia, the Declarations are a
subsequent agreement between the parties to the BIT, as both Austria and Croatia declared
(in concurrence with all Member States of the EU) that “all” of their intra-EU BITs are

incompatible with the EU acquis. !73

103. Addressing Addiko’s argument concerning the critical date doctrine, Croatia argues that
Addiko’s reading of the doctrine is inapposite, as the ICJ calls for inclusion of acts by a
party to the dispute that are the “normal continuation of prior acts,” and are not undertaken
to improve that party’s position in an ongoing dispute.'*4 Croatia argues that the

Declarations are a normal continuation of diplomatic relations between Member States.

104. With respect to Addiko’s reliance on a decision of a Singaporean Court regarding the

admissibility of post-critical date evidence, Croatia argues that Addiko reads the judgment

selectively, ignoring the principle that post-critical date evidence is relevant if it confirms

the position established by pre-critical date evidence. !75

105. With regard to Addiko’s reference to Austria’s prior statements about the BIT, Croatia
highlights that it had informed Austria of the incompatibility between the BIT and the EU
acquis by a note verbale even before it acceded to the EU Treaties. '*° In response to this,
Austria deferred the resolution of this issue to the EU.'?” Accordingly, the Declarations
cannot be rightly described as a change in Croatia’s position on the compatibility between
the BIT and the EU acquis, but rather as confirmation of the position it had held along.
Instead, Croatia argues that it was Austria which changed its position on the compatibility

of intra-EU BITs with the EU Treaties. 8

106. Moreover, even accepting arguendo Addiko’s argument on a bar on evidence after the so-
called critical date, Croatia argues that the very presence of Article 11(2) of the BIT clearly
indicates that both Croatia and Austria contemplated prior to the critical date the issue of

compatibility between the BIT and the EU Treaties.'°

107. Fifth, and finally, Croatia argues that any award this Tribunal renders after confirming its
jurisdiction would be unenforceable. For this, Croatia relies on the text of the Declarations,
read in conjunction with Article 9(3) of the BIT.'*° In its view, the Declarations establish
that an award by a tribunal recognizing jurisdiction under an intra-EU BIT would be in
violation of the EU acquis, and Article 9(3) of the BIT establishes that an award would be
unenforceable if it is beyond the limits of the national law of the Contracting States. On

this basis, Croatia claims that any award rendered in violation of the EU acquis would be

unenforceable since the national law of the enforcing Contracting State would call for that
State’s obligations under the EU Treaties to prevail over contradictory obligations. To
confirm this argument, Croatia relies on decisions from German and Swedish Courts
refusing to enforce awards on the grounds of incompatibility of intra-EU BITs with the EU

acquis.'3!

b. Addiko’s Position

Addiko argues that the Declarations are political and of no relevance for this Tribunal’s
inquiry into EU law or international law.!*? Addiko adds that they are also irrelevant given
their silence on the compatibility of EU law with ICSID arbitration. '** Addiko makes four

points regarding the declarations.

First, Addiko relies on its argument, discussed above, that the critical date for determining
this Tribunal’s jurisdiction is the date of institution of proceedings, which predates the

Declarations. 4

Second, Addiko argues that the Declarations do not form part of the EU acquis,'*> and are
thus irrelevant to application of Article 11(2) of the BIT. Addiko reasons that by the EU’s
own definition, also relied on by Croatia, the EU acquis comprises only those declarations
that are “adopted by the Union.”!*° Addiko says that the Declarations were issued in the
name of Member States of the European Union and not in the name of the EU, which has
its own distinct legal personality. Accordingly, Addiko argues (relying in part on the Jacobs
Opinion with respect to past practice) that since the Declarations are “expressly issued in
the name of the relevant member States, acting as such...[they are] (therefore) not an act

of the EU at all and not part of the EU acquis.” '*” Nor does Croatia’s own expert consider

the Declarations to be part of the EU acquis, instead choosing to refer to them as a “political

manifestation of the Member States’ obligations” within the EU legal order.'**

Addiko goes on to argue that the Declarations are not an interpretation of EU law, since
the power to interpret is exclusive to the CJEU.'*? Nor can Member States alter or even

confirm a judgment of the CJEU.'*°

Third, Addiko argues that since the EU Member States have no authority to interpret EU
law, the Declarations are not (contrary to Croatia’s contention) an authoritative
interpretation of the relationship between the TFEU and the BIT.'4! Addiko argues that
Declarations do not constitute “a subsequent agreement regarding the interpretation” of
Article 11(2) of the BIT, because they merely adopt the Member States’ position on the
legal consequence of Achmea, with no reference to the BIT whatsoever. Addiko argues
that this very principle was followed by the tribunal in Eskosol to hold that Declarations
were not an interpretation of the ECT. 12 Therefore, Addiko argues, the Declarations have

no significance under Article 31(3)(a) of the VCLT. '#

Fourth, Addiko says that since the Declarations were issued after the critical date, they
have no interpretive use and are irrelevant to this Tribunal’s analysis of its jurisdiction
under Article 9 of the BIT. Addiko’s reasoning relies on the decision of the Singapore
Court of Appeals in Sanum v. Laos'** under the China-Laos BIT. There, the Singaporean
Court rejected as irrelevant under VCLT Articles 31(3)(a)-(b) two notes verbales between
China and Laos because they post-dated the critical date of jurisdiction. The Singaporean

Court held:

The critical date doctrine ... acts as a time constraint in the context
of determining the relevance or weight of evidence in cases
concerning issues of public international law. In short, the doctrine
or principle renders evidence, which comes into being after the
critical date and is self-serving and intended by the party putting it

forward to improve its position in the arbitration, as being of little,

if any weight ... This suggests that if post-critical date evidence is

sought to be adduced, it should be consistent with and a continuation

of what the pre-existing position establishes. Its function is to

corroborate and explain. To the extent that it contradicts what has

been established by the pre-existing position to give the party

seeking to rely on it an evidential advantage in its case, it should not

be admitted. '*°
Applying the reasoning of the Singaporean Court, Addiko argues that since the critical date
for determining this Tribunal’s jurisdiction is 27 September 2017, the Declarations are not
irrelevant to prove a joint understanding between Croatia and Austria as to the alleged

incompatibility of the BIT with the EU acquis.'“°

114. By contrast, Addiko argues that the evidence pre-dating the critical date of 27 September
2017 points to Croatia’s and Austria’s understanding that the BIT and the EU acquis were
compatible. For example, Addiko relies on the failure of the Treaty of Accession to address
the status of intra-EU BITs as evidence that at the time of Croatia’s accession to the EU,
Austria and Croatia understood that compatibility existed between the BIT and the EU

acquis.'47

115. Addiko also relies on a meeting between the Austrian and Croatian government on 14
February 2018, during which Austria (i) “reiterated its previously expressed position that
it considers BITs valid and that it does not deem them incompatible with EU law,” (ii)
contended that incompatibility would have to be determined by the CJEU, (iii) remarked
that “incompatibility should have effect as of the time when it is established, that is without

e Addiko concludes on the basis of this evidence that at no time relevant for this
Tribunal’s determination of its jurisdiction was there an agreement between Austria
and Croatia that the BIT was incompatible with the EU acquis. Accordingly,
Addiko says that even if the Declarations arguendo were capable in principle of
having significance under VCLT Article 31(3)(a), they are irrelevant to this

Tribunal’s determination of its jurisdiction under Article 9 of the BIT.“

E. ACHMEA

116. The CJEU in Achmea considered a reference by the Bundesgerichtshof regarding Article
8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovak BIT, regarding the following question:

Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a provision in a bilateral
investment protection agreement between Member States of the European Union
(a so-called intra-EU BIT) under which an investor of a Contracting State, in the
event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may bring
proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal where the investment
protection agreement was concluded before one of the Contracting States acceded
to the European Union but the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until after
that date?!°°

117. The CJEU ruled on the question with the following text serving as its dispositif:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the
Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal protection of investments between the
Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under
which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute
concerning investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the
latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State
has undertaken to accept.!*!

118. Both Parties agree that this dispositif forms part of the EU acquis. They disagree, however,
on the impact of Achmea on the jurisdictional question before this Tribunal. Croatia argues

that (1) Achmea confirms the incompatibility of Article 9 of the BIT with the EU acquis,

effective from the date of Croatia’s accession to the EU Treaties, and (2) Achmea is binding

on this Tribunal. !*?

Addiko by contrast (1) questions the correctness of the decision and
(2) argues that Achmea is irrelevant to this Tribunal’s decision on its jurisdiction, on the
multiple grounds of being neither binding nor persuasive, inapplicable to ICSID

arbitrations, and temporally inapplicable. !**

(wD Correctness of Achmea
a. Croatia’s Position

In response to Addiko’s argument that Achmea was wrongly decided, Croatia contends that
is neither for Addiko nor this Tribunal to determine the soundness of the judgment. Instead,
since CJEU judgments are binding on the EU Member States, and form part of the legal
acquis which in turn are prioritized in Article 11(2) of the BIT,'™ this Tribunal is bound

by the Achmea precedent.

b. Addiko’s Position

Addiko critiques the outcome of Achmea as wrong in its conclusion, and unpersuasive
because it does not comport with the well-reasoned analysis of various investment law

decisions and of the CJEU’s own Advocate General. !°°

In particular, Addiko submits that Achmea did not offer any persuasive reasons for
distinguishing intra-EU investment treaty arbitrations from intra-EU commercial
arbitrations, extra-EU investment arbitrations and proceedings before courts of non-EU

Member States, in all of which a question of EU law may arise.!°°

Addiko also aligns itself with Advocate General Wathelet’s opinion in Achmea that (1) the
CJEU has jurisdiction only over Member States and does not provide for a dispute

settlement method between private parties and Member States, and (2) nothing in Article

'52 Resp, Mem. Section ILC.

267 of the TFEU prohibits the submission of a dispute to a court or tribunal to which that

provision does not apply. !7

Addiko further relies on the Jacobs Opinion to argue that Achmea likely does not follow a
number of fundamental principles of EU law, including deference to established

international law principles such as legal certainty and proportionality.'**

Addiko notes that these arguments are further supported by the fact that other arbitral
tribunals have come to the same conclusion regarding the shortcomings of the Achmea

Judgment.

(2) Force of Achmea in These Proceedings
a. Croatia’s Position

Croatia argues that this Tribunal is bound by the CJEU’s decision in Achmea and must
therefore defer, while determining its jurisdiction under Article 9 of the BIT, to the CJEU’s
finding on the incompatibility with the EU acquis of arbitration clauses in intra-EU

investment agreements. Croatia makes four points to advance this position.

First, Croatia submits that the EU Treaties are ‘treaties’ for the purposes of public
international law.'*? Croatia then refers to provisions of the EU Treaties to demonstrate
that the CJEU has been designated to resolve questions relating to their interpretation. '°°

Croatia argues that as a matter of public international law, the CJEU is established as the

127. Croatia argues that even if there was doubt as to the status of the EU Treaties, those doubts
are resolved by the express terms of Article 11(2) of the BIT which mandates the

application of EU acquis as a matter of treaty law.'

128. Second, Croatia argues that decisions of the CJEU form a part of the EU acquis, relying
on multiple sources. '™ In addition, Croatia notes that Addiko itself relies on substantially
the same source as Croatia for the definition of “EU acquis.” to state that it is “the entire
body of rights and obligations that are binding on the EU Member States. It includes. ..case
law of the CJEU. It covers, in other words, all laws and regulations and other rules that are
considered internally binding as a matter of EU law.”!® Croatia therefore argues that
Addiko contradicts its own definition of the “EU acquis,” by characterizing Achmea as
“neither persuasive nor binding.”'® Croatia also points out that Addiko’s own expert
agrees that Achmea is an authoritative statement of EU law and forms part of the EU

acquis.'°7

129. Third, Croatia claims that since the CJEU’s interpretation of the EU Treaties establishes
their international legal effects, other courts and tribunals cannot in good faith (as required
by Article 31 of the VCLT) apply an interpretation of the EU acquis that contradicts the

interpretation of the CJEU.'®

Fourth, Croatia cites the decision of the Dutch government to terminate all of its intra7EU
BITs, despite initially having argued against the position eventually adopted by Achmea.
Croatia claims that this decision, along with the Declarations, reflects the serious
consequences! of Member States refusing to comply with the EU acquis. Accordingly,
Croatia warns that any decision of this Tribunal that conflicts with Achmea would result in
both Croatia and Austria infringing their EU Treaty obligations, a result that was sought to

be avoided by Article 11(2) of the BIT.

For these reasons, Croatia argues that this Tribunal must accept the incompatibility
between Article 9 of the BIT and the EU acquis which has been definitively established by
the CJEU in Achmea.'”

b. Addiko’s Position

It is Addiko’s position that this Tribunal owes no deference to the position of the CJEU or

the European Commission. '7!

Addiko first argues that while the CJEU has a mandate to interpret EU law, and in doing
so applies principles specific to EU law developed in its own jurisprudence, the CJEU has

no mandate to make authoritative findings on the state of public international law.!”

For this reason, Addiko emphasizes that this Tribunal must make an independent
determination of its jurisdiction, including what comprises “incompatibility” for purposes
of Article 11(2) of the BIT. There is nothing in the EU Treaties stating that CJEU
judgments are determinative for international tribunals in proceedings governed neither by
the EU or its institutions. Therefore, Addiko argues that this Tribunal is permitted to

interpret the BIT in the manner called for by Article 31 of the VCLT.

'69 Croatia also relies on provisions of the EU Treaties: Articles 258-260 of the TFEU.

135. Addiko also points out that for the most part, Achmea is silent on the specific issues raised

by Croatia’s jurisdictional objections. !74

(3) Applicability of Achmea to ICSID Arbitrations
a. Croatia’s Position

136. Croatia makes the following arguments relating to the applicability of Achmea to ICSID

arbitrations.

137. First, Croatia argues that the dispositif of Achmea contemplates that all arbitration clauses
in intra-EU BITs are incompatible with the EU acquis. In light of this, Croatia argues that
this Tribunal must examine, not whether ICSID arbitrations were expressly included within
the scope of the decision (as Addiko frames the question), but rather whether the decision
expressly carves out ICSID arbitrations. Croatia argues that this lens is evident!” from the
general references in Achmea to arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs, without
distinguishing specifically between cases heard under the UNCITRAL Rules versus the
ICSID Rules.!”°

138. According to Croatia, the CJEU’s primary concern in Achmea was the effect of intra-EU
arbitration clauses on the autonomy of the EU legal order and on the mutual trust and
cooperation among EU Member States. Croatia observes that these concerns arise in

ICSID arbitrations as well.!77

139. Croatia also submits that Achmea is applicable to ICSID arbitration given the possibility
that an ICSID tribunal “may” have to apply or interpret the EU acquis. In this particular
case, it submits that this follows from the second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID
Convention, since the BIT does not contain an applicable law clause; this Tribunal
accordingly would have to apply Croatian law, which derives in various respects from EU

law. Croatia further submits that Article 11(2) of the BIT likewise requires the Tribunal to

interpret or apply EU law, given that the accelerated jurisdictional issue turns directly on

an assessment of the compatibility of the BIT with the EU acquis.'”8

Second, and in response to Addiko’s argument that the absence of any mention of ICSID
arbitration in Achmea restricts its scope, Croatia argues that it is impracticable for the CIEU
to list all possible fora where a dispute could be brought under an intra-EU investment
agreement. Instead, Croatia argues, this Tribunal must pay heed to the general principle

outlined in Achmea and apply it to the BIT.!”

Third, and finally, Croatia argues that Addiko’s reliance on UP and C.D Holding and
UniCredit to argue that Achmea does not apply to ICSID arbitrations is ill-conceived.
Croatia critiques both decisions, also noting that the UniCredit decision was under

reconsideration by the tribunal that issued it.'®?

As to UP and C.D Holding, Croatia argues that the tribunal there preoccupied itself with
the question of whether Hungary was still a party to the ICSID Convention, even though
that question had no bearing on the validity of Hungary’s consent to arbitrate. In other
words, the tribunal confused the instrument of consent (the intra-EU investment agreement
at issue) with obligations under the ICSID Convention. Croatia argues that the tribunal in

UniCredit repeated the error in UP and C.D Holding.'*!

Instead, Croatia submits, the ICSID Convention is irrelevant for interpretation of Croatia’s
consent, since Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention comes into play only after it is
established that the parties have consented to ICSID arbitration in another instrument. In
other words, the effect of Achmea on the ICSID Convention cannot be considered before
it is determined that the ICSID Convention indeed applies. '*? Croatia adds that any reliance
by Addiko on its expert, Sir Francis Jacobs, for the purposes of addressing the ICSID

Convention is misplaced, because the subject falls outside the scope of his expertise. '**

b. Addiko’s Position

Addiko argues that, contrary to Croatia’s broad reading of Achmea as extending to ICSID
arbitrations, Achmea is silent regarding its applicability to ICSID arbitrations. Accordingly,
Addiko argues that by virtue of its silence, Achmea does not extend to ICSID arbitrations,
and therefore does not result in any incompatibility between Article 9(2) of the BIT and

the EU acquis. '*4

First, Addiko says that since Achmea interprets provisions of the EU Treaties as precluding

“international agreements concluded between Member States, such_as Article 8 of the

 

[Netherlands-Slovakia BIT],” the ruling must be read as confined to intra-EU BITs which
are similar in all material respects to the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.'* This also responds

to Croatia’s argument that Achmea was not limited in its applicability. !*°

Second, Addiko argues that given its poor reasoning even from the perspective of internal
EU law, Achmea must be adopted narrowly to avoid negative effects of the judgment from
being multiplied, becoming difficult to correct and undermining the coherence and
credibility of EU law. Addiko says this is especially true because of the lack of engagement

of Achmea with General Advocate Wathelet’s arguments. '*”

Third, Addiko argues that Achmea overstated the policy consideration of ensuring a
uniform interpretation of EU law, when the CJEU in fact exercises only a very limited
control over EU law. Addiko attributes this to the limited number of cases involving EU
law that are referred to the CJEU. Accordingly, Addiko argues that Achmea’s preclusion

of investment arbitration is disproportionate. !**

Fourth, Addiko cites the 29 January 2019 Opinion of Advocate General Bot, prepared at
Belgium’s request, regarding the compatibility with EU law of the Comprehensive

Economic and Trade Agreement between Canada and the EU and its Member States

(“CETA”).'®° Addiko argues that given the pains to which Advocate General Bot had to
go to distinguish Achmea from the CETA, Achmea must be interpreted narrowly by this
Tribunal.!% This, along with the lack of persuasive value of Achmea, is also clear from

Advocate General Bot’s opinion that the CETA is compatible with EU law.'?!

Fifth, Addiko argues that there are compelling grounds on which Achmea is
distinguishable from the issues presented in this proceeding. The Netherlands-Slovakia
BIT at issue in Achmea called for arbitration under the UNCITRAL Rules, while this
arbitration is conducted under the multilateral ICSID Convention, with the result that
Croatia is required to comply not only with its obligations under the BIT but also with its
undertakings under the ICSID Convention. Addiko argues further that since the ICSID
Convention has non-EU Member States as parties, Croatia’s participation in arbitration
proceedings such as this one is a matter not only between EU Member States, but rather
one of interest to all ICSID Convention parties. Since this obligation of respondent States
would be affected by extending Achmea to ICSID arbitrations, Addiko argues that Achmea
ought to be read narrowly as not extending to intra-EU BITs providing for ICSID
arbitration.!°? Addiko adds that since the CJEU did not consider these material differences
between ICSID and UNCITRAL arbitrations, indeed not mentioning ICSID at all, Achmea

cannot be assumed to apply to ICSID arbitrations. '°
(4) Retroactive Application of Achmea
a. Croatia’s Submissions

Croatia argues that since the CJEU merely interprets provisions of the EU Treaties, the

interpretation in Achmea applies from the date on which the underlying EU Treaty

provisions it interprets came into force.'** In other words, Achmea has an ab initio or ex
tunc effect.'°> Croatia cites to decisions of the CJEU, the Craig Opinion, and other
decisions and scholarship for this proposition.'°° Accordingly, Croatia argues that since the
principle of ab initio effect is a universally applied principle (not limited to the EU acquis),
the incompatibility between intra-EU BITs and the EU acquis established by Achmea
applies from the date the EU Treaties came into force as between the Contracting States to

the BIT, which is the date of Croatia’s EU accession (1 July 2013).

151. Croatia argues that an interpretation of a treaty provision is inherently retroactive. For
Croatia, if an interpretation cannot be read into the original document retroactively, that

interpretation would not apply to the litigants before it. Croatia therefore disagrees that

Achmea is exceptional and prospective only in its effect.'°”

152. Croatia emphasizes that the ab initio or ex tunc effect of the CJEU’s interpretation of EU
Treaties is a principle of the EU acquis, integrated into the BIT via Article 11(2). This,
Croatia argues, is accepted by Addiko in light of its definition of the “EU acquis,” which
includes “principles” of EU law such as the ex tunc effect of the CJEU’s interpretations. !°*
Therefore, without the CJEU itself having imposed a temporal limitation on the effect of
its decision in Achmea, that decision is effective from the effective date of the EU Treaties

it interprets. !°°

b. Addiko’s Position

First, Addiko argues that Achmea does not apply ex tunc even under EU law. Addiko
reasons that the principle of ex tunc effect of CJEU decisions was developed to protect
private parties found to have been harmed by Member States conduct, and to prevent
Member States from deriving an advantage from their own past failure to adhere to their
EU Treaty obligations. By contrast, Addiko says, the effect of extending Achmea back in
time would be the opposite, namely to deprive private parties of the protections that BITs
afforded them up to the date of the Achmea decision.° Therefore, consistent with the
concerns in EU law, the Achmea decision should be interpreted as not affecting intra-7EU

arbitration cases that already had commenced prior to the date when it was rendered.

Second, Addiko submits that Achmea need not be taken into consideration as it became
part of the EU acquis, if at all, after the initiation of this arbitration. Addiko argues Achmea
does not form part of the “EU acquis in force” on the date these proceedings were
instituted, within the meaning of Article 11(2) of the BIT, because there is no indication in
the BIT that Article 11(2) was to have retroactive effect.?°! Addiko adds that EU law (such
as the principle of ex tunc effect of CJEU decisions) cannot override or circumvent the
critical date doctrine for jurisdictional purposes under international law. 7°? Addiko

underscores that the UniCredit tribunal reached this same conclusion.7°

Addiko therefore concludes that the CJEU’s finding of incompatibility, if at all applicable
as a part of the EU acquis, came into existence as of 6 March 2018, prior to which time
there was no determination by the CJEU of such incompatibility. In fact, every other forum
concerned with the question until then had ruled that there was no incompatibility between
the EU acquis and arbitration clauses in intra-7EU BITs.?°4 The fact that Achmea B.V., the

losing party in Achmea, did not make a request to the CJEU for non-retroactivity (as may

be relevant in EU law under the “First Occasion Rule”) should not affect the outcome of

the international law question of compatibility in this case.7°

Third, Addiko argues that the ex tunc principle of EU law is not mandatory in any event,
and must instead be balanced against other principles of EU law such as legal certainty,
proportionality and the protection of fundamental rights, to which the “First Occasion
Rule” must give way.?°° Addiko says that legal certainty requires that individuals be able
to unequivocally ascertain their rights at a given point in time, especially where financial
consequences are involved. Addiko describes the principle of proportionality as calling for
legal measures to pursue a legitimate aim and to be limited to what is necessary to achieve
that aim. Finally, Addiko submits that the principle of protection of fundamental rights
calls for non-interference with fundamental rights unless there is legal basis and need for

retroactivity either to serve a general interest or to protect the rights of others.

Addiko also argues that the fact that Achmea was both radical and detrimental to claimants,
while favorable to Member States, provides a further reason to refuse the ex tunc
application of the decision. Addiko says that this is particularly the case for investors who
brought proceedings before Achmea under the reasonable belief that the BIT was valid and

enforceable.7””

THE BIT’s COMPATIBILITY WITH EU’S NON-DISCRIMINATION PRINCIPLES
Croatia argues that the BIT is incompatible with the non-discrimination principle that it
deems to be part of the EU acquis. Addiko disagrees.

a. Croatia’s Position

Croatia draws this Tribunal’s attention to Articles 18, 49 and 63 of the TFEU which

establish the principle of non-discrimination between EU Member States. Croatia explains

Cl. Mem. { 146, relying on Jacobs Opinion ] 49, 54(1), 54(3).

that these provisions prohibit EU Member States from discriminating between individuals

of different Member States of the grounds of their nationality.7°°

160. According to Croatia, the BIT is incompatible with the principle of non-discrimination
since it grants rights only on a bilateral basis, an point that it contends was confirmed by
the CJEU in Achmea. ?® Croatia argues that the BIT constitutes indirect discrimination in
violation of the TFEU, as it makes the exercise of fundamental freedoms under the EU

Treaties less attractive for nationals from Member States that are not party to the BIT.?!°

161. Specifically, Croatia argues that BIT perpetrates discriminatory treatment both
substantively (through its Article 2(1) requiring fair and equitable treatment, Article 3(1)
requiring national treatment, and Article 4 protecting against expropriation) and

Croatia disagrees with Addiko’s argument that the BIT is compatible with non-
discrimination obligations under the EU Treaties since it does not require the Contracting
States to treat investors from non-Contracting States differently. In Croatia’s view, this
argument is unavailing, as the BIT provides indisputable advantages for Austrian and
Croatian investors that are unavailable to investors from other Member States.?!* Croatia
adds that, at any rate, Article 11(2) of the BIT calls upon this Tribunal to test discrimination
as interpreted by the CJEU, which contradicts Addiko’s proposed definition of

discrimination.?'5

As to Addiko’s argument that the BIT is akin to intra-EU taxation treaties which are
permitted by the EU acquis, Croatia relies on its legal expert’s opinion to state that double
taxation treaties cannot be equated to bilateral investment treaties since Member States

have expressly retained competence over direct taxation in Article 65(1)(a) of the TFEU.?!°

b. Addiko’s Position

In response to Croatia’s argument that the BIT is incompatible with Articles 18, 49 and 63
of the TFEU because it confers protections bilaterally on the basis of investors’ nationality
in violation of the principle of non-discrimination, Addiko points to the findings of at least
two dozen arbitral tribunals regarding compatibility of the BIT and the EU acquis.?'”
Addiko adds that neither Croatia nor its legal expert offer any basis to distinguish this case
from the prior ones, especially because neither Achmea nor the Declarations even address
the issue of compatibility between the EU acquis and substantive protections in intra-EU

bilateral investment treaties.7!*

166. In submitting that there is no incompatibility between the arbitration provision at Article 9
of the BIT and the general discrimination provision at Article 18 of the TFEU, Addiko
relies on its legal expert’s opinion that the BIT does not require Croatia to provide less
favorable treatment to non-Austrian investors, just to ensure that Austrian investors would
not be treated less favorably than the others.?!? Addiko contends that this argument is
supported by the CJEU’s own case law.”° Addiko also recalls General Wathelet’s opinion
in Achmea that intra-EU investment treaties, like double taxation treaties, are not
discriminatory simply because they afford treatment on a bilateral basis.*! This is so,
according to Addiko, because investors who enjoy protection under a treaty occupy a
different position from those who do not, since the treaty is likely to have been a factor in
their decision to make their investment in the first place.” This reasoning, Addiko states,
has been followed by tribunals in Binder and EAI Bank.’

the BIT and the TFEU.?* Addiko notes that Croatia disregards multiple arbitral decisions

protections in intra-EU bilateral investment treaties and the TFEU.7?>

substantive protections requires the Contracting States to treat investors from other EU

Members less favorably than others. Addiko argues that treaties dealing with the same

fact that a treaty existed between two EU Member States meant that an investor not from one of those EU Member

subject matter can be cumulatively applied, and since the TFEU contains no substantive

equivalent to the protections confirmed by the BIT, the two are not incompatible.””°

THE BIT’s COMPATIBILITY WITH GATS OBLIGATIONS

Croatia contends that the BIT conflicts with obligations under the World Trade
Organization (“WTO”) General Agreement on Trade in Services (“GATS”) and as such
with the EU acquis. Addiko disputes the GATS’ place in the EU acquis and argues that the

BIT does not violate it in any event.

a. Croatia’s Position

Croatia makes a three-fold argument. First, it argues that the GATS forms part of the EU
acquis, requiring an assessment of the BIT’s compatibility with the GATs for purposes of
Article 11(2) of the BIT. Second, Croatia argues that the BIT breaches Croatia and
Austria’s obligations under Article II(1) of the GATS. Third, and finally, Croatia argues
that nothing in public international law restricts the application of the GATS to investment

treaties.

First, Croatia argues that agreements concluded by the EU are binding on its Member
States, and accordingly, form an integral part of the EU acquis.””’ Since the EU is a party
to the GATS, the GATS and other WTO agreements (by virtue of EU’s membership to the
WTO) are part of the EU acquis, and any failure by a Member State to implement these
international agreements constitutes a violation of obligations under EU law by that
Member State. Accordingly, an incompatibility between the BIT and the GATS would give
rise to an incompatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis.??° Moreover, although

agreements, Croatia argues that CJEU review is irrelevant to the substantive question of

whether the BIT is compatible with the acquis.”°

172. Second, Croatia notes that Article II(1) of the GATS imposes upon the Member States an

obligation requiring “that investment incentives or restrictions be applied equally to all

230

foreign sources of inward service industry-related investments, which is equivalent to

a most-favored nation (“MFN”) requirement. In Croatia’s view, the BIT is a trade measure
that is covered by the GATS. Since the BIT by definition is a bilateral treaty, it necessarily
does not accord MEN treatment to all WTO members. For this reason, the BIT is
incompatible with the GATS, and thus with the acquis.?*! Croatia rejects Addiko’s point
that relations among EU Member States are considered domestic and unregulated by
GATS, relying on scholarship to explain that by virtue of being an individual member of
the WTO, Croatia and each EU Member State had the obligation of non-discrimination.?*
Accordingly, Croatia’s obligation under the GATs to render no less favorable treatment

extends to other EU Member States as well.**

173. Third, Croatia argues that as multiple WTO Member States have expressly exempted
bilateral investment treaties from the scope of their MFN obligations under the GATS, it
is clear that investment treaties such as the BIT otherwise fall within the scope of Article

II of the GATS.?** Croatia argues that since neither Austria nor Croatia so excluded

investment treaties from Article II of the GATS, Article II applies to their investment

treaties, thereby creating an incompatibility between the BIT and the GATS.”*>

b. Addiko’s Position

174. | Addiko presents five arguments why this Tribunal need not take into consideration the

GATS which, at any rate, should be considered as compatible with the EU acquis.

175. First, Addiko argues that although the EU acquis may include a few international
agreements concluded by the EU, that is not the case for the GATS (or any other WTO
agreement). Addiko relies on the CJEU’s consistent jurisprudence?” that the flexibility?”
the WTO agreements offer for conduct among WTO Member States makes them “in
principle” not among the rules under which the CJEU must review the legality of measures
adopted by the Community institution. Croatia argues that, in fact, the CJEU (at the request
of the European Commission and Council) has found WTO Agreements to be persuasive
but not binding upon the EU. Addiko therefore argues that the GATS is not a part of the

EU acquis.?**

176. Second, Addiko argues that even if the GATS was considered to be part of the EU acquis,
it does not generate obligations for the EU towards investors in Austria. Addiko argues that
the WTO Agreements impose upon the EU the duty to refrain from discriminating against
foreign goods and services in favor of domestic goods and services. Accordingly, Addiko
argues, the EU’s obligation under the GATS is to accord MEN treatment to services and
supplies from outside the EU, not to those from EU Member States such as Croatia or
Austria. Therefore, the GATS is not incompatible with the BIT since they do not overlap

in their scope. While the GATS caters to obligations towards service and service providers

236 Case C-149/96 Portugal v. Council, 41, CLM-154.

237 Addiko notes that since the WTO allows for compensation in lieu of withdrawal of measures, resolution of a dispute
through mutual amicable settlement, etc., the WTO affords significant flexibility to its Members and does not
determine appropriate legal means of ensuring good faith compliance with its Agreements. Cl. Mem. { 177. For this,

from non-EU WTO Member States, the BIT merely applies to service and service providers

from its Contracting Parties.”°°

Third, Addiko argues that nothing in the BIT calls on Croatia or Austria to provide a certain
level of treatment to investors not from the other Contracting Party. Instead, Addiko argues,
each Contracting Party remains open under the BIT to accord identical or no less favorable
treatment to all other States. Accordingly, in its view, the BIT does not violate the GATS
MEN obligation.“

Fourth, Addiko rejects Croatia’ s argument that the exclusion by some States of investment
agreements from Article II of the GATS indicates incompatibility between such
agreements and the GATS. In its view, the fact that many prominent WTO Member States
have not excluded investment agreements from the application of Article II of the GATS
indicates that those WTO Member States do not believe that there is any such
incompatibility.**! Addiko notes that when pressed at the hearing, Croatia admitted that its
argument about the GATS would mean that unless expressly exempted through the

procedure provided by the GATs, “no BIT would be valid under this argument.”?4?

Fifth, Addiko argues that by Croatia’s own argument, bilateral investment treaties are not
“measures” within the meaning of Article II of the GATS. At any rate, Addiko argues that,
assuming investment treaties are “measures” for purposes of Article II of the GATS,
Croatia’s argument that by their very nature such treaties violate the GATS MEN obligation
would cause seismic ramifications for the over 3,000 bilateral investment treaties?
between WTO Member States. For these reasons, Addiko argues that Croatia’s arguments

must be approached with caution."“4

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION’S POSITION

The Commission’s Submission is focused on the legal consequences of the CJEU’s
Achmea Judgment. The Commission argues that the judgment is an authoritative
interpretation of EU law, binding upon EU Member States, investors established in those
States and intra-EU arbitral tribunals as a part of international law applicable to the dispute.
Accordingly, the Commission argues that the offers by Croatia and Austria to investors
from the other State to arbitrate investment disputes were invalid since Croatia’s accession
to the EU on 1 July 2013. The Commission accordingly considers that the Tribunal lacks

ge te . 2
jurisdiction over this case.74*

COMPETENCE OF THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL TO RULE ON ITS JURISDICTION

The Commission cites the ICJ for the proposition that an international court or tribunal
“must ... always be satisfied that it has jurisdiction, and must if necessary go into that
matter proprio motu.”**6 In its view, “[t]he competence to decide on such claims
necessarily presupposes the possibility to analyse possible obstacles to the validity of the
offer to arbitrate, and the existence and validity of consent to arbitrate.”*4” Accordingly,
this Tribunal must assess whether the offer of arbitration made by Croatia was applicable

when Addiko filed its request for arbitration.

CONFLICT BETWEEN ARTICLE 9 OF THE AUSTRIA-CROATIA BIT AND EU LAW

The Commission argues that there is a conflict between Article 9(2) of the BIT and the EU
law because (i) the Tribunal may have to apply and interpret the EU law, (ii) there is no
valid offer to arbitrate, and (iii) the sunset clause in the BIT are either not triggered or are

inapplicable.

(wD The Tribunal May Have to Apply and Interpret EU Law

The Commission argues that the scope of Achmea disallows the application and

interpretation of the EU law by any tribunal established under any intra-EU BIT. That is

 

247 Commission Submission { 22.

53

because these tribunals are not part of EU judicial system, cannot be regarded as courts of
Member States and cannot make a reference to the CJEU for a preliminary ruling. The
application and interpretation of EU law by these tribunals thus contradicts the principle of
mutual trust among Member States and the preservation of the nature and autonomy of the
EU law, which moreover was confirmed by the German Federal Supreme Court. In this
case, the Commission argues, the applicable law of the BIT includes Croatian law, which
comprises EU law, and for this reason a tribunal established under Article 9 of the BIT
would have to interpret and apply EU law just as would the arbitral tribunal proceeding

under the BIT at issue in Achmea.*"*

(2) Lack of Valid Offer for Arbitration Since 1 July 2013

184. The Commission contends that the conflict between Article 9 of the BIT and the EU law
has existed since the date of Croatia’s accession to the EU, | July 2013. The Commission
argues that Achmea applies ex tunc, i.e., from the very outset of Croatia’s accession. The
CJEU has the authority to limited the ex tunc application of its rulings, but it did not do so
in Achmea. Thus, since consent to arbitrate under the BIT was lacking ab initio, since 1
July 2013, there was no valid offer to arbitrate outstanding at the time Addiko filed its
request for arbitration. The Commission supports this argument by relying on the
Bundesgerichtshof s final decision in Achmea and the Svea Court of Appeal’s suspension

of the enforcement of two intra-EU investment arbitration awards seated in Stockholm.””

(3) Sunset Clauses Are Not Triggered and Inapplicable

185. The Commission submits that the sunset clause in Article 12(3) of the BIT regulates only
the legal consequences of unilateral termination of the BIT. Here, however, the BIT was
terminated by the plurilateral Treaty of Accession of Croatia to the EU, which is not
addressed by Article 12(3) of the BIT. In the alternative, the Commission stresses that
Achmea precludes the offer for arbitration, which itself renders the sunset clause

incompatible with and precluded by the EU law.?°°

THE AUSTRIA-CROATIA BIT HAS BEEN TERMINATED

The Commission invites the Tribunal to find it lacks jurisdiction because the BIT has been
terminated.*>! The Commission contends that (i) the requirements of VCLT Article 59 for
implied termination of the BIT are fulfilled, (ii) the BIT and the EU law have the “same
subject matter” for purposes of Article 59, (iii) there is no need to follow the formal
requirements of VCLT Articles 65-68 for termination of the BIT, and (iv) Croatia and
Austria confirmed the lack of valid consent to arbitration by a declaration consistent with

VCLT Article 31.?°?

(wD The Conditions for Both Alternatives of VCLT Article 59(1) Are Fulfilled

The Commission argues that the investments listed in Article 1 of the BIT fall within the
ambit of application of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by the EU law, namely the
TFEU. Importantly, EU law provides for a complete set of legal remedies and effective
judicial protection in the case of violations of investors* rights. Contrary to the decision in
Eastern Sugar, the Commission considers that the protection of fundamental freedoms
includes the post-establishment phase of the investment. The Commission also relies on
CJEU decisions that EU law takes precedence over agreements concluded between
Member States, to argue that such precedence also applies to treaties that originally were
not between Member States but became such upon the latter’s State’s accession to the EU.
With regard to this case, the Commission argues that Croatia and Austria both were well
aware of the rule of primacy of the EU law as of Croatia’s accession on 1 July 2013, and
therefore their intention when signing the Treaty of Accession was for the protection of
intra-EU investments to be governed henceforth only by EU law. This is especially evident
under this BIT, the Commission says, given its inclusion of Article 11(2). Thus, the

Commission argues, the BIT has been impliedly terminated since 1 July 2013.77

Alternatively, the Commission considers that all substantive provisions of the BIT are
incompatible with the EU law because they implement a parallel system overlapping with

Single Market rules, preventing a full application of the EU law. The overlap occurs when

 

283 Commission Submission {ff 26-28.

55

189.

190.

intra-EU investment agreements form the basis for an award of unlawful State aid or when
they confer rights only in respect of investors from one of two Member States, conflicting
with the principle of non-discrimination on the ground of nationality. For these reasons,
the Commission argues, the BIT in its entirety is incompatible with EU law, fulfilling the
condition under Article 59(1)(b) of the VCLT. In this regard the Commission mentions that
Article 59 of the VCLT also can support partial termination of an international

agreement.?**

(2) The Question of “Same Subject Matter”

The Commission states that arbitral tribunals have previously considered the requirement
that two treaties relate to the same subject matter as an additional condition for VCLT
Article 59, rather than as a condition that is automatically met whenever other conditions
of Article 59 are fulfilled. However, such decisions in its view are superficial and at odds
with Article 59’s drafting history. In this regard, citing the VCLT’s travaux préparatoires,
the Commission argues that Article 59(1) does not require that two treaties be related to
the same subject matter, but only that they lay down rules for the same issue. Thus, since
any investment made by an investor from one Member State in another falls within the
scope of application of the fundamental freedoms of the EU law, both the BIT and the EU

law govern the same issue.?>>

(3) There Is No Need to Follow the Formal Steps for Termination in VCLT
Articles 65-68

The Commission argues that, contrary to rulings of other arbitral tribunals, the travaux

préparatoires of the VCLT makes it clear that implied termination under VCLT Article 59

does not require the formal steps for termination under VCLT Articles 65-68 to be
256

followe

191.

192.

193.

(4) Croatia and Austria Have Confirmed the Lack of Valid Consent to
Arbitration in a Declaration Pursuant to VCLT Article 31(2)(b) and 31(3)(a)
The Commission argues that a Declaration?’ dated 15 January 2019 issued by Croatia and
Austria together with other EU Member States confirms that (i) Achmea precludes Article
9(2) of the BIT, (ii) the effects of Achmea are ex tunc as of 1 July 2013, (iii) the conflict
between Article 9(2) of the BIT is governed by the conflict rule of primacy of the EU law,
and (iv) the application of VCLT Article 30 leads to the same outcome. According to the
Commission, this Declaration serves as a clarification by both Croatia and Austria that the
object and purpose of the Treaty of Accession, within the meaning of VCLT Article 31(1),

was to impliedly terminate the BIT altogether, or at least terminate its Article 9.7

IN THE ALTERNATIVE: EU LAW PREVAILS OVER ARTICLE 9(2) OF THE BIT

The Commission argues that in the event the Tribunal disagrees with its submission under
VCLT Article 59, under all possible conflict of law rules applicable, the conflict between
Article 9(2) of the BIT and the EU law must be resolved in favor of EU law.?°?

(wD Law Applicable to the Decision on Jurisdiction

Replying on the Bundesgerichtshof s final decision on Achmea and decisions in JSW v.
Czech Republic and Zhinvali v. Georgia, the Commission argues that the general principle
of primacy of EU law is part of the Croatian legal order and of international law applicable
between Croatia and Austria. Thus, EU law governs the jurisdiction of this Tribunal and
takes precedence over Article 9(2) of the BIT. The Commission acknowledges an
alternative view, supported by practice of the PCIJ and in academic writing and reflected
by the decision in CSOB v. Slovakia, to the effect that the question of whether the parties
have effectively expressed their consent to arbitral jurisdiction is governed by international
law. However, it contends that this view is not applicable in this case, which presents the

inverse scenario of that in CSOB v. Slovakia. Thus, the Commission considers that to assess

the validity of the arbitration agreement, the law of the host State should be applied. Even
if international law regulates the issue of consent, it contends that the outcome will be the

same: EU law should be applied when assessing jurisdiction.?©

(2) Primacy of EU Law as a Special Conflict Rule Codified in Declaration 17 of
the Lisbon Treaty and Article 11(2) of the BIT
In the Commission’s view, the applicable conflict rule is that of the primacy of EU law vis-
a-vis other international agreements concluded between Member States, including pre-
accession international treaties. For this argument, the Commission relies on Costa/ENEL,
the Declaration 17 annexed to the Final Act of the Intergovernmental Conference adopting
the Treaty of Lisbon, and Article 11(2) of the BIT. Also, based on decisions of the CJEU,
and the ICSID award in Electrabel v. Hungary, the Commission considers that in the case
of pre-accession international treaties the precedence of EU law takes effect as of the date

- . 9
of accession.”°!

(3) In the Alternative: The VCLT’s Conflict Rules Lead to the Conclusion that
EU Law Prevails over Article 9(2) of the BIT
The Commission argues that application of VCLT Article 30(3) also would result in EU
law prevailing over Article 9(2) of the BIT. The reason is that in contrast to Eastern Sugar,
and according to the VCLT’s travaux préparatoires and the decision in PL Holding, Article
30(3) does not impose two separate conditions requiring the “same subject matter” and a
“conflict” between treaties; instead, there is only a single requirement of conflict. In the
context of this argument, the Commission contends that the Tribunal ought to consider the
interpretation given by the Contracting Parties themselves to their successive obligations,
namely through their Declaration of 15 January 2019, stressing that cross-border
investment in the EU is governed by the complete framework of EU law. Thus, the
Commission concludes that under VCLT Article 30(3), the arbitration clause and the sunset
clause in the BIT are incompatible with the Treaty of Lisbon and the Treaty of

(4) No Legitimate Expectations and No Protection by VCLT Article 70

Finally, relying on the Bundesgerichtshof’s final decision in the Achmea case, the
Commission argues that Addiko cannot invoke the doctrine of legitimate expectations. The
Commission also argues that the Eastern Sugar tribunal misapplied VCLT Article 70,
interpreting it contrary to the International Law Commission’s (“ILC”) observation that
Article 70 was not concerned with the rights of individuals but solely with those of

States.?6

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTORY PRINCIPLES

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, to which both Austria and Croatia are Contracting
States, provides that jurisdiction “shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly out of
an investment, between [Croatia] and a national of [Austria], which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.” The question for this Decision is
whether Croatia has consented to submit to ICSID arbitration the particular dispute at issue,
namely a claim by an Austrian investor alleging violation of certain substantive standards
of the Austria-Croatia BIT. There is no question that the other party to this dispute, Addiko,
has consented to any valid offer of consent that Croatia may have made, by initiating this
arbitration consistent with the ICSID Rules. At the same time, it is trite law that an investor
may not bind a State beyond the limits of the State’s own predicate offer of consent, and
States are free to limit the circumstances of their advance consent to ICSID arbitration.7°

Where they have done so, tribunals must respect the clear limits of the requisite consent.

The starting point for determining the validity and reach of Croatia’s consent is the BIT

itself, which must be interpreted according to the principles set forth in VCLT Articles 31

n ff 57-58.

264 ICSID Convention, Article 25(1).

265 See, e.g., C. Schreuer, et al., The ICSID Convention: A Commentary (Cambridge University Press, 2d ed. 2009),
4514, RLM-126 (“Where ICSID’s jurisdiction is based on an offer made by one party, subsequently accepted by the
other, the parties’ consent exists only to the extent that offer and acceptance coincide.... It is evident that the investor’s
acceptance may not validly go beyond the limits of the host State’s offer.”).

and 32. In conducting such an analysis, the Tribunal bears in mind several propositions.
First, under VCLT Article 31, the provisions of the BIT are to be interpreted and applied
in accordance with the “ordinary meaning” of their terms, in the “context” in which they
occur and in light of the Treaty’s “object and purpose.”©° While the Contracting Parties’
use of unambiguous terms should be taken as reflecting their clear intent, context and
purpose must also be considered. The relevant “context” for construing any given passage
in a treaty includes the words and sentences found in close proximity to that passage,
including definitional terms, as well as other provisions of the same treaty which help
illuminate its object and purpose.”°’ In accordance with VCLT Article 31(3), a tribunal
construing the terms of the Austria-Croatia BIT should also take into account (inter alia)
“Ta]ny subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty
or the application of its provisions,” as well as “[a]ny subsequent practice in the application
of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation” and

“(any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.7°

199. In accordance with Article 32 of the VCLT, “[rJecourse may be had to supplementary
means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances
of its conclusion,” only “to confirm the meaning” resulting from the textual approach
required by Article 31, or in the event the textual approach leaves a meaning “ambiguous
or obscure” or would lead to a result that is “manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”” The
ICJ has explained that even in these circumstances, “a decisive reason” (such as

unmistakable evidence of the State Parties’ intentions from such supplementary materials)

would be required “[t]o warrant an interpretation other than that which ensues from the

natural meanings of the words” of a provision.””

In applying these VCLT principles to interpret a treaty text, no burden of proof applies as
between the parties to a particular dispute. The Tribunal must satisfy itself of the correct
meaning of the treaty, and this correct reading will not shift based on traditional notions of
burden of proof, which exist primarily to define the duty placed on a party to demonstrate
or refute a disputed fact.?”! The fact that the treaty interpretation exercise in this case is
necessary to determine the Tribunal’s jurisdiction further underscores the point, since — as
the ICJ has stated — “the establishment or otherwise of jurisdiction is not a matter for the
parties but for the [Tribunal] itself,” which must determine from all the points advanced by
the Parties “whether an intention on the part of the Parties exists to confer jurisdiction upon
it.”?” The Tribunal turns below to interpretation of the particular BIT provisions that are

most central to the accelerated jurisdictional issue here.

INTERPRETATION OF KEY BIT PROVISIONS

Articles 9 and 11 of the BIT contain the provisions which are critical for interpreting the
scope and limits to Croatia’s consent, and these two Articles must be read in the context of
each other, pursuant to VCLT Article 31(1). Beginning with Article 9, entitled “Settlement
of Investment Disputes,” the BIT refers to a class of disputes, described in Article 9(1) as
“Ta]ny dispute arising out of investment, between a Contracting Party and an investor of
the other Contracting Party.” In accordance with Article 9(2), if such a dispute cannot be
settled amicably within three months of notification by the investor, then upon the request
of either the investor or the host State, “the dispute shall ... be subject to the following
procedures” (emphasis added). The word “shall” connotes a mandatory requirement,
subject only to such conditions or exceptions as may also be specified in the BIT. Article

9(2) then provides a choice between two dispute resolution procedures, namely ICSID

by the present Agreement ...”) (emphasis added).

arbitration (addressed in Article 9(2)(a)) or UNCITRAL Rules arbitration (addressed in
Article 9(2)(b)).

Importantly, for either path, the BIT expressly states that “[i]n the case of arbitration, each
Contracting Party, by this Agreement irrevocably consents in advance, even in the absence
of an individual arbitral agreement between the Contracting Party and the investor, to
submit such dispute” for resolution by the applicable tribunal.?”? This statement of
“irrevocabl[e] consent[] in advance” contains two important elements. First, irrevocability
means what it says: the States may not resile from the consent so granted. Second, and
equally important, what is irrevocable is the “consent[] in advance,” namely the offer of
consent to qualified investors of the other State. Under the plain language of Articles
9(2)(a) and 9(2)(b), Austria’s and Croatia’s mutual pledge of irrevocability does not attach
only after a particular investor accepts an offer of arbitration for a particular dispute, in the
fashion in which (for example) Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention operates (i.e.,
“Tw]hen the parties [plural] have given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally”). Rather, the irrevocability addressed in Articles 9(2)(a) and 9(2)(b) of the
BIT relates to the Contracting States’ advance offer itself. The ordinary meaning of the
phrase “irrevocably consents in advance” thus means that neither Austria nor Croatia may
withdraw its standing advance offer of ICSID or UNCITRAL arbitration, made for the
benefit of qualified investors of the other State, so long as the BIT itself (or at least Article

9, which contains this stipulation) remains in full force and effect.

Article 9 must however be read in the context of Article 11 of the BIT, which is entitled
“Application of the Agreement.” The “Agreement” at issue in Article 11 is the BIT itself,

ie., “[t]he present Agreement” between Austria and Croatia,?”4

not the subsequent
agreement that may come into mutual force with a particular investor by consequence of
its acceptance of the “irrevocabl[e] consent[] in advance” that each Contracting State
offered in Article 9. Since Article 11 relates to “Application” of the BIT itself, the terms of

Article 11 operate as a gateway to all other provisions of the BIT, including both those

IT Articles 9(2)(a) and 9(2)(b).
IT Articles 11(1) (“The present Agreement shall apply to...”) and 11(2) (“The Contracting Parties are not bound

addressing the Contracting Parties’ substantive obligations (Articles 2-8) and those
addressing their procedural obligations (Articles 9-10). As a result, an investor can invoke
the substantive and procedural protections of these other Articles only if the circumstances

exist for “Application of the Agreement,” as specified in Article 11 of the BIT.2”>

204. The critical provision for this dispute is Article 11(2), which provides that “[t]he
Contracting Parties are not bound by the present Agreement insofar as it is incompatible
with the legal acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.” The Tribunal
agrees with Croatia that this is an unusual provision, not present in other investment treaties
that tribunals have analyzed for purposes of jurisdictional objections in intra-EU
investment disputes (except for the UniCredit case, which concerned the same BIT as
here).?”° Article 11(2) therefore requires special attention, beginning with a careful VCLT

analysis of its terms.

205. The first terms of note are included in the phrase, “the Contracting Parties are not bound
by the present Agreement insofar as ...” (emphasis added). Structurally, this sentence has
two parts, with the first part (“are not bound by’’) identifying the consequence of a stated
circumstance, and the second part defining the nature of the circumstance that would
trigger such consequence (“insofar as ...”). Starting with the former, the consequence is
not that the BIT ceases to be in force as such; Article 11(2) does not provide for the express
or implied termination of the treaty or any of its provisions. Rather, the consequence of the
circumstance arising is that the Contracting Parties are excused from (“not bound by”)
particular obligations that they otherwise undertook in the BIT. The phrase “insofar as”
demonstrates, according to its ordinary meaning, that the Contracting Parties will be so
excused only if and to the extent compelled by the applicable circumstance (i.e., “insofar
as,” but no farther than). Otherwise stated, Article 11(2) is not necessarily an all-or-nothing

proviso regarding applicability of the BIT, such that either all of the BIT’s provisions apply

(describing treaty provisions entitled “Scope of the Agreement” as having the “very function” of delineating the
treaty’s reach, and thus functioning “as a gateway” before investors can invoke the protections of the treaty’s other
provisions).

207.

or none of them do. It is entirely possible, consistent with the phrase “insofar as,” that the
Contracting Parties could be held “not bound by” a particular provision of the BIT as to
which the stated circumstance applies, while remaining bound by other provisions of the

BIT as to which there is no Article 11(2) cause for concern.

This is an important distinction in the context of the next relevant term in Article 11(2),
which concerns “incompatibfility]” with another body of law (“the legal acquis of the [EU]
in force at any given time”). The Tribunal accepts Croatia’s point that State Parties can
agree on any hierarchy among their mutual obligations that they wish,””’ but in the case of
Article 11(2), they have not said that the EU acquis occupy the entire field of their
obligations inter se, such that there is no possible room for BIT provisions to apply in
parallel. Rather, they have agreed to excuse each other from BIT obligations only “insofar
as” (and no farther than) an incompatibility exists. The question for the Tribunal is whether
a particular incompatibility arises here, and if so, in what manner and to what extent. One
hypothesis could involve a per se incompatibility, under which the very notion of an intra-
EU BIT (or at least one in which disputes are to be resolved by arbitration) is by definition
incompatible with the acquis. Another hypothesis could involve a more nuanced approach
to incompatibility, in which only the manner in which particular provisions of the BIT are
invoked in the context of a particular dispute might render them potentially incompatible
with the acquis. (A third hypothesis, of course, is no incompatibility at all.) The Tribunal
returns to these distinctions further below, in the context of the Parties’ particular
arguments about incompatibility. The point here is simply to note that as a matter of
ordinary meaning, Article 11(2)’s use of the phrase “insofar as” requires a Tribunal to
consider not only whether an incompatibility in fact exists, but if so, to what extent, since
the Contracting Parties will be excused from their BIT obligations only to that applicable

extent.

The next relevant phrase in Article 11(2) is “incompatible with,” used in the context of
describing another body of law. The word “incompatible” is not defined in the BIT, but the

notion of incompatibility has a recognized meaning in public international law, in the

27 See Tr. Day 1, pp. 24:7-11, 25:8-12.

64

context of resolving alleged conflicts between two different sets of international
obligations. The same word is used inter alia in Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT, and given
that both Austria and Croatia have ratified the VCLT, the Tribunal considers that they
should be viewed as intending to incorporate a consistent meaning for purposes of Article

11(2).

208. Fortunately, there is no dispute between the Parties as to what the term “incompatibility”
means for purposes of international law. Both Parties accept that obligations in two treaties
are incompatible if compliance with one obligation places a State into non-compliance with
the other obligation.?”* This definition of incompatibility necessarily requires a finding that
the obligations of two separate treaties cannot be cumulatively applied, as perhaps imposing
parallel or additional obligations but not flatly inconsistent ones. Rather, under public
international law, incompatibility arises only when the act of complying with one
obligation brings a State into non-compliance with another. In that sense, a relationship of
“incompatibility” between treaty provisions is fundamentally distinct from a relationship

of complementarity.?”

209. Because Article 11(2) of the BIT contains its own rule about the relationship between the

BIT and the EU acquis, there is no need to resort to Article 30 of the VCLT with respect

218 See, e.g., Resp. Mem. { 32 (defining incompatibility as a circumstance where two obligations “cannot be complied
with simultaneously,” in the sense that “a State party to both treaties cannot comply with one of them without
breaching the other”); Cl. Mem. {{ 45 (defining incompatibility as “a situation where a State, by complying with an
obligation under one treaty, necessarily breaches an obligation under another treaty”); Resp. PHB1 {| 50 (noting
Parties’ agreement on the test for incompatibility); Cl. PHB1 J 15, 17-18 (same); Resp. PHB2 { 4 (same). Both
Parties cite to a 2006 report by an International Law Commission Study Group, entitled “Fragmentation of
International Law: Difficulties Arising from the Diversification and Expansion of International Law,” U.N. Doc.
A/CN/4/L.682, 13 April 2006, { 24, CLM-180 (the “ILC Fragmentation Report”) (“conflict exists if it is possible for
a party to two treaties to comply with one rule only by thereby failing to comply with another rule. This is the basic
situation of incompatibility. An obligation may be fulfilled only by thereby failing to fulfill another obligation.”).

 

 

279 An example of complementarity (by contrast with incompatibility) exists in Article 8(1) of the BIT, which addresses
the situation in which an investor may be entitled to greater protection under another treaty than provided under the
BIT. Article 8(1) provides that “[i]f the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or international obligations
existing at present or established thereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement,
contain a rule, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a
treatment more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rule shall to the extent that it is more
favourable prevail over the present Agreement.” This confirms that investors remain entitled to the benefits of
whichever treaty provides greater protections, with the effect that the BIT may only ratchet up (and may never ratchet
down) the protections each State grants to investors of the other.

 

65

210.

to that issue, because (as the Parties seem to agree), the VCLT’s rules about the relationship
between successive treaties are residual ones, which are meant to be invoked only where
there is no lex specialis rule already agreed. Article 11(2) however operates as a lex
specialis rule for this purpose, so Article 30 of the VCLT does not govern the issue at

hand.?8?

The Tribunal does not accept Addiko’s invitation to conclude that Article 11(2) of the BIT
nonetheless requires an examination of whether two sets of treaties have the “same subject
matter.” For Addiko, the concept of “incompatibility” in Article 11(2) of the BIT “requires
as a... logical prerequisite” that the two sets of treaties have the “same subject matter,” or
else they could never have incompatible provisions.”*! Addiko therefore suggests that the
Tribunal need not even assess putative incompatibility between the BIT and the EU acquis,
unless it first finds them to have the same overall subject matter.”*? But this would collapse
the Article 11(2) inquiry into the same type of analysis as under VCLT Article 30, when
Article 11(2) does not so provide. Unlike VCLT Article 30, which explicitly imposes a
“same subject matter” test as part of determining the relationship between successive
treaties, Article 11(2) of the BIT conditions non-applicability of its terms only on the issue
of “incompatibility,” without imposing a threshold “subject matter” test or in any other
way cross-referencing VCLT Article 30 or its additional terms. In these circumstances, the
Tribunal cannot sidestep the central question Article 11(2) poses, by reverting to a separate
inquiry that VCLT Article 30 requires but Article 11(2) of the BIT does not. The Tribunal
instead focuses squarely on the issue of incompatibility, without reaching the hypothetical
question of whether there ever could be a situation in which specific provisions of two
treaties are incompatible even though the treaties in general, taken at a macro-level, may

address different subject matters.

the same subject-matter. As investment tribunals have uniformly held, however, intra-EU BITS and EU law do not
have the same subject-matter. As a matter of principle, there can therefore be no incompatibility between them”).

66

211.

212.

The next logical step in construing Article 11(2) is to determine the specific body of law
on which the provision conditions application of BIT terms, based on a threshold
requirement of no incompatibility. Article 11(2) refers to the “legal acquis of the European
Union (EU) in force at any given time.” The first part of this phrase, referencing to the EU
“legal acquis,” is not terribly controversial, as it has an accepted meaning under EU law.
The Parties both accept that the acquis communautaire of the EU includes, inter alia, (a)
the content, principles and political objectives of the EU Treaties (notably the Treaty on
European Union (“TEU”) and the TFEU); (b) legislation adopted by the EU in application
of the EU Treaties; (c) the case law of the CJEU; (d) declarations and resolutions adopted
by the EU; and (e) international agreements concluded by the EU that are binding on it and
on its Member States.*? The Parties and their legal experts also agree that the acquis
includes opinions rendered to the CJEU by its Advocates General, to the extent not
subsequently rejected by the CJEU or otherwise incompatible with primary elements of the

acquis such as the EU Treaties.?**

With respect to the judgments of the CJEU, it is undisputed that (in the words of the Eskosol
tribunal) these constitute “decisive interpretations of the particular issues of EU law that
they actually reach.”?*° The Tribunal thus agrees with Croatia that in considering the
content of the EU acquis for purposes of an Article 11(2) objection under the BIT, it would
not be “at liberty to set ... aside” the CJEU’s clear statements of what the acquis actually
provide.?*° However, while the CJEU’s interpretations of the acquis are authoritative to
the extent the CJEU has clearly spoken, this does not mean that an international tribunal
applying Article 11(2) of the BIT has no independent role in assessing incompatibility with

the acquis. As with any other provision of the BIT, the arbitral tribunal must render its best

CJEU’s own practice, in which “[t]he Court

and most faithful interpretation of Article 11(2), as that provision becomes relevant in any

given case. This may arise in a number of different contexts.

First, on any given question, there may be a dispute as to whether the CJEU has yet spoken.
If the CJEU has not yet spoken to an issue, then the tribunal necessarily must examine for
itself the content of other elements of the acquis with which particular BIT provisions are
said to be incompatible and thus inapplicable under Article 11(2). Moreover, even if the
CJEU has spoken to some element of an issue, there may be a dispute between the parties
to a BIT dispute as to the scope of its pronouncements. Unless and until the CJEU resolves
such ambiguities by subsequent rulings, it necessarily falls to this Tribunal applying Article
11(2) to determine the extent to which the CJEU’s prior judgments actually reach the
particular issue, as to which a claim of incompatibility with the acquis has been presented

to the tribunal.”*”

Finally, in all instances, after identifying the point at issue in the acquis, the Tribunal must
independently determine the claim of incompatibility, since incompatibility under Article
11(2) is an international law question, not a question of EU law. Consistent with the notion
of competence-competence, the BIT does not require a tribunal to suspend its independent
judgment with respect to a claimed incompatibility. Article 11(2) is not self-judging, as it
might have been if it were phrased alternatively, “[t]he Contracting Parties are not bound
by the present Agreement insofar as [one such Contracting Party claims that] it is
incompatible with the legal acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.”
Rather, it falls to the Tribunal to determine whether the BIT indeed is incompatible, in the
public international law sense previously discussed, with the acquis “in force at any given
time,” while exercising appropriate deference to the CJEU as to what the content of that

acquis actually was at the relevant time.

 
 
 

r Jacobs’ testimony that this approach would be consistent with the
self has fully accepted that, while [its] ruling is binding and, indeed,

 

forms part of the European Union acquis, it is for the court or tribunal hearing the new case to decide whether and, if
so, to what extent, the ruling applies” to the facts and issues before it; “the scope of the ruling, in the absence of a
further reference to the Court of Justice, is entirely a matter for the tribunal hearing the new case”).

68

215.

216.

This point brings the Tribunal finally to the important temporal elements of Article 11(2),
reflected in the phrase “in force at any given time,” within the broader context of absolving
the Contracting Parties from the BIT “insofar as it is incompatible with the legal acquis of
the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.” The first point is that “in force at any
given time” is a composite of two smaller phrases, “in force” and “at any given time,” and
that the latter point about a “given time” qualifies the former point about the scope of the
relevant acquis (that it be the acquis then “in force”). While this may appear obvious, it is
nonetheless worth mentioning, because a slightly different interpretation of Article 11(2)
might result if the phrase “at any given time” were to qualify the reference to
incompatibility, rather than the reference to the acquis (viz., “[t]he Contracting Parties are
not bound by the present Agreement insofar as it is incompatible [at any given time] with
the legal acquis ...”). The question in that case might be whether the acquis, as it has
evolved in toto by the date of the Tribunal’s assessment, compels a finding of
incompatibility such as to release the Parties from obligations otherwise imposed by the
BIT. By contrast, under the actual placement of the phrase “‘at any given time” (referring
to “the legal acquis ... in force at any given time’’), the temporal inquiry must be into the
state of the acquis itself (i.e., what elements were or were not in force as part of the acquis,

as of a particular date).

This is consistent with the reality that all bodies of law evolve over time, including the EU
acquis. The acquis evolves in at least two different senses. First, elements of it emanate
from political acts that are taken at a particular moment in time, such as entry into
additional treaties binding the EU Member States (e.g., the Lisbon Treaty), or adoption of
particular legislation in application of the EU Treaties. Second, elements of the acquis
emanate from the case law of the CJEU, which like courts in many jurisdictions
progressively interprets underlying texts (e.g., the EU Treaties) as particular questions
about those texts are put to it. The CJEU’s interpretation of the EU Treaties may evolve
over time, just as the opinions rendered to the CJEU by its Advocates General may also
evolve. Any given pronouncement by the CJEU (or any given opinion by an Advocate
General, prior to the CJEU’s decision) may become part of the acquis once it is rendered,
but it cannot be said to have be “in force” as part of the acquis prior to when it is rendered.

By contrast, the underlying texts which the CJEU interprets (the EU Treaties) were “in

69

217.

218.

force” as of the date of their adoption, even if the CJEU has not yet had occasion to opine

on a particular question arising about those texts.

This distinction becomes particularly relevant here, as it relates to the Parties’ discussion
of whether and how Achmea should be considered as part of the Tribunal’s jurisdictional
analysis. The Parties agree that for purposes of any jurisdictional question under the ICSID
Convention, the “critical date” for determining the existence of consent to arbitration is the
date on which the relevant request for arbitration was registered (here, 27 September 2017).
What follows from that, and from Article 11(2) of the BIT, is that (a) if the Tribunal were
to find that as of that critical date, Croatia’s offer of consent to arbitration in Article 9(2)
of the BIT was not already incompatible with the acquis then in force (i.e., with the EU
Treaties), (b) then no subsequent event could retroactively vitiate the mutual consent to
arbitration cemented by the act of Addiko’s acceptance.”** As previously discussed, any
such retroactive vitiation of prior consent would be inconsistent with Article 9(2)’s own
express provision that the standing offer of consent is irrevocable, so long as that Article
was valid under Article 11(2), with which it must be read in context. Accordingly, since
Achmea postdated the critical date for determining compatibility, it cannot itself be said
(qua a CJEU judgment) to have comprised part of the acquis “in force at [the] given time”
relevant to the jurisdictional analysis. However, this does not excuse the Tribunal from
assessing, for purposes of the incompatibility analysis, the content and import of the EU
Treaties, which (unlike Achmea) were clearly already part of the acquis “in force” as of

the critical date.

In this context, the Tribunal acknowledges that Croatia is not arguing that post-critical date
events (such as Achmea) dramatically altered the pre-existing acquis, creating a new
incompatibility that should be applied retroactively to vitiate a prior consent that was valid

under the acquis as of the critical date. Croatia rather argues that certain incompatibilities

°88 The Tribunal thus agrees with the UniCredit 2018 Decision that “incompatibility with the EU acquis is measured
for purposes of Article 9 at the time the request for arbitration is submitted and the State’s consent becomes operative,”
and that Article 11(2) cannot be read as leaving room for a “condition subsequent” (such as a new element of the
evolving acquis) to vitiate consent retroactively after consent already has become irrevocable. UniCredit 2018

between the BIT and the EU Treaties were inherent from the date of its accession to the
EU (1 July 2013), even if the CJEU did not have occasion to “clarify” that point until years
later.7*° According to Croatia, the CJEU’s eventual pronouncement in Achmea was simply
a “confirmation” of what always had existed in the acquis,” not a declaration of change,
and therefore “[e]ven without the Achmea Judgment, this Tribunal would have to interpret
and apply these provisions” of the EU Treaties.??! The Tribunal acknowledges this
argument, and therefore considers it essential that it address directly the content of the
Achmea as it relates to the pre-existing provisions of the EU Treaties, and not simply
sidestep that content on the grounds that Achmea was issued only after the critical date in

this case.

At the same time, the Tribunal acknowledges Addiko’s counter-argument that an
incompatibility between the EU Treaties and the BIT could not be said to have existed sub
rosa, as part of the EU acquis already in force, before it was ever recognized as such by
the CJEU. To some extent, the Parties’ contrasting positions on this point — whether an
incompatibility can be said to have existed vis-a-vis the EU Treaties, before the CJEU
announced any interpretation one way or the other — can be said to echo the famous
metaphysical question about observation and perception, “if a tree falls in a forest and no
one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?”?” Of course, as Addiko also argues, there
was at least one sound in the forest of relevant interpretations as of the critical date, namely
Advocate General Wathelet’s opinion on the EU Treaties offered in the Achmea case,
which Addiko asserts formed part of the acquis “in force” up until such time as the CIEU

later departed from it.

The Tribunal considers each of these arguments as presenting serious issues, and returns
to them further below, after first examining certain predicate contentions about the nature

of the alleged incompatibility itself (as expressed in Achmea and otherwise).

THE ALLEGED INCOMPATIBILITY OF THE BIT WITH THE EU ACQUIS

Croatia alleges that from the date of Croatia’s accession to the EU, the BIT is incompatible
with the EU acquis — and therefore was not binding on the Contracting Parties pursuant to

Article 11(2) of the BIT — in two different respects.

First, Croatia contends that Article 9(2)’s offer to submit BIT disputes to international
arbitration was incompatible from the date of Croatia’s EU accession with Articles 267 and
344 of the TFEU. In Croatia’s view, these Articles categorically forbid referral of any EU
law questions to an authority (the arbitral tribunal) that is unable to make a preliminary
reference to the CJEU, the way the national courts of EU Member States could do. These
Articles therefore (in its view) do not allow the creation of any dispute settlement

mechanisms outside the EU court structure that may have to consider issues of EU law.

Second, Croatia argues, the BIT violates anti-discrimination principles in the EU acquis,
reflected in particular in Articles 18, 49 and 63 of the TFEU, because it extends special
rights and protections (both procedurally and substantively) to Austrian and Croatian
nationals, which the Contracting Parties do not also extend to nationals of other EU
Member States. The procedural discrimination is said to arise from the grant of arbitration
rights only to Austrian and Croatian nationals, and the substantive discrimination to arise
from the grant only to the same nationals of various protections reflected in the BIT’s
substantive treatment obligations. In Croatia’s view, these two aspects of favorable
treatment also violate core principles of equal treatment reflected in the GATS, which

Croatia contends is part of the EU acquis.
The Tribunal addresses these contentions separately below.

(1D) Alleged Incompatibility with Articles 267 and 344 TFEU

Article 267 of the TFEU provides as follows:

72

The Court of Justice of the European Union shall have jurisdiction
to give preliminary rulings concerning:

(a) the interpretation of the Treaties;

(b) the validity and interpretation of acts of the institutions, bodies,
offices or agencies of the Union;

Where such a question is raised before any court or tribunal of a
Member State, that court or tribunal may, if it considers that a
decision on the question is necessary to enable it to give judgment,
request the Court to give a ruling thereon.

Where any such question is raised in a case pending before a court
or tribunal of a Member State against whose decisions there is no
judicial remedy under national law, that court or tribunal shall bring
the matter before the Court.

If such a question is raised in a case pending before a court or
tribunal of a Member State with regard to a person in custody, the
Court of Justice of the European Union shall act with the minimum
of delay.

226. Article 344 of the TFEU provides as follows:

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for therein.

227. According to Croatia, the incompatibility of intra-7EU BIT arbitration with these two
provisions of the EU acquis was “clarified and confirmed” by Achmea,”? even if (in its
view) that proposition already was inherent in Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU prior to
the CJEU’s pronouncement. Otherwise stated, while Croatia does not invoke Achmea as a
new event somehow transforming the pre-existing acquis, it does rely almost entirely on
the analysis in Achmea as reflecting the applicable meaning of Articles 267 and 344 of the
TFEU as it relates to intra-EU BIT arbitration. Given this reliance on Achmea to frame the
content of the relevant acquis, it is necessary for the Tribunal to consider what the CIEU

actually decided in Achmea, and correspondingly what the CJEU did not unambiguously

23 Tr. Day 1, p. 60:16-21; see also id., p. 92:2-5 (referring to Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU “as clarified in”
Achmea); Resp. Request 22 (Articles 267 and 344 as “confirmed in” Achmea); Resp. PHBI {{ 62 (Articles 267 and
344 “as clarified by” Achmea).

230.

decide. For this purpose, the Tribunal considers it important to view the Achmea dispositif

in the context of the CJEU reasoning which preceded it, and not simply in isolation.

The Tribunal therefore starts with a summary of Achmea (section “a” below), before
turning to a discussion of the scope of the CJEU’s ruling (section “‘b”) and the implications
of Achmea for the compatibility of Article 9(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT (section “c’’).
The Tribunal then discusses the temporal issues debated by the Parties, including the
application of any broader interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU to BIT cases
commenced before Achmea (section “d’’). Finally, the Tribunal discusses the relevance of
the Declarations (section “e”) and certain other issues raised by Croatia and the
Commission (section “f’), before setting forth in section “g” below its conclusions on the

alleged compatibility of this BIT arbitration with Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.

a. Summary of Achmea

The Tribunal prefaces this summary with an acknowledgment that it largely tracks the
detailed summary of Achmea set forth in the Eskosol decision,?* by a tribunal which
included two members of this Tribunal. Since the Tribunal agrees with that summary, it
sees no need to reformulate the summary in different language. The Tribunal of course
could have simply cross-referenced the relevant passages of Eskosol, but that would require
readers of this decision to resort to that decision, to follow the Tribunal’s assessment of the
implications of Achmea provided in subsequent sections of this Decision. Since the
Tribunal prefers this Decision to stand on its own, it instead incorporates the relevant

summary here, rather than simply cross-referencing it.

The Achmea matter came before the CJEU on a request by the German Bundesgerichtshof
for a preliminary ruling. In December 2012, an UNCITRAL tribunal had issued an
arbitration award in favor of Achmea B.V., a Dutch company, finding that the Slovak
Republic had violated certain obligations owned to the company under the Netherlands-
Slovakia BIT. As the seat of the arbitration was in Frankfurt, the Slovak Republic brought

a set-aside action before the Oberlandesgericht Frankfurt am Main, and when that court

2° Eskosol (9 155-166, CLM-192.

74

dismissed its action, the Slovak Republic appealed to the Bundesgerichtshof on a point of

law.

231. The Bundesgerichtshof in turn decided to stay the appeal and sought a preliminary ruling
from the CJEU on the following questions, referring to the text of Articles 18, 267 and 344
of the TFEU:

qd) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a
provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement between
Member States of the European Union (a so-called intra-EU BIT)
under which an investor of a Contracting State, in the event of a
dispute concerning investments in the other Contracting State, may
bring proceedings against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal
where the investment protection agreement was concluded before
one of the Contracting States acceded to the European Union but the
arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until after that date?

Tf Question | is to be answered in the negative:

(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of such a
provision?

Tf Questions | and 2 are to be answered in the negative:

(3) Does the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU preclude the
application of such a provision under the circumstances described in
Question 1279

232. Advocate General Wathelet proposed that the CJEU should answer these questions as follows:

Articles 18, 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as not
precluding the application of an investor/State dispute settlement
mechanism established by means of a bilateral investment
agreement concluded before the accession of one of the Contracting
States to the European Union and providing that an investor from
one Contracting State may, in the case of a dispute relating to
investments in the other Contracting State, bring proceedings
against the latter State before an arbitral tribunal.”°°

286 Case No. C-284/16, Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV, Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet, 19 September 2017,
4273, CLM-145.

75

233. The CJEU did not, however, accept Advocate General Wathelet’s proposed resolution.
Instead, it began by reformulating the questions posted by the Bundesgerichtshof, into a

combined first and second questions framed as follows:

By its first and second questions, which should be taken together,
the referring court essentially asks whether Articles 267 and 344
TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision in an
international agreement concluded between Member States, such as
Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from one of those
Member States may, in the event of a dispute concerning
investments in the other Member State, bring proceedings against
the latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction
that Member State has undertaken to accept.?*”

234. The CJEU’s reformulation included a specific reference to Article 8 of the Netherlands-
Slovakia BIT. That clause provided first, in Article 8(1), that “[a]ll disputes between one
Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting Party concerning an investment of
the latter shall, if possible, be settled amicably.” Failing such a settlement, Article 8(2) of the
Netherlands-Slovakia BIT provided that “[e]ach Contracting Party hereby consents to submit
a dispute referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to an arbitral tribunal.” The Netherlands-
Slovakia BIT then provided as follows in Article 8(6), regarding the law applicable to such a

dispute:

The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into
account in particular though not exclusively:

- the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

- the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant agreements
between the Contracting Parties;

- the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;

- the general principles of international law.”

235. Beginning its analysis, the CJEU set out various EU law considerations which it considered

relevant:

287 Achmea 31, RLM-12.
288 Achmea {{ 4 (quoting Article 8 of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT), RLM-12.

76

32. In order to answer those questions, it should be recalled that,
according to settled case-law of the Court, an international
agreement cannot affect the allocation of powers fixed by the
Treaties or, consequently, the autonomy of the EU legal system,
observance of which is ensured by the Court. That principle is
enshrined in particular in Article 344 TFEU, under which the
Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties ....

33. Also according to settled case-law of the Court, the autonomy
of EU law with respect both to the law of the Member States and to
international law is justified by the essential characteristics of the
EU and its law, relating in particular to the constitutional structure
of the EU and the very nature of that law. EU law is characterised
by the fact that it stems from an independent source of law, the
Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States, and by
the direct effect of a whole series of provisions which are applicable
to their nationals and to the Member States themselves. Those
characteristics have given rise to a structured network of principles,
rules and mutually interdependent legal relations binding the EU
and its Member States reciprocally and binding its Member States
to each other ....

34. EU law is thus based on the fundamental premiss [sic] that each
Member State shares with all the other Member States, and
recognises that they share with it, a set of common values on which
the EU is founded, as stated in Article 2 TEU. That premiss [sic]
implies and justifies the existence of mutual trust between the
Member States that those values will be recognised, and therefore
that the law of the EU that implements them will be respected. It is
precisely in that context that the Member States are obliged, by
reason inter alia of the principle of sincere cooperation set out in the
first subparagraph of Article 4(3) TEU, to ensure in their respective
territories the application of and respect for EU law, and to take for
those purposes any appropriate measure, whether general or
particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising out of the
Treaties or resulting from the acts of the institutions of the EU ....

35. In order to ensure that the specific characteristics and the
autonomy of the EU legal order are preserved, the Treaties have
established a judicial system intended to ensure consistency and
uniformity in the interpretation of EU law ....

36. In that context, in accordance with Article 19 TEU, it is for the
national courts and tribunals and the Court of Justice to ensure the
full application of EU law in all Member States and to ensure
judicial protection of the rights of individuals under that law ....

77

37. In particular, the judicial system as thus conceived has as its
keystone the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article
267 TFEU, which, by setting up a dialogue between one court and
another, specifically between the Court of Justice and the courts and
tribunals of the Member States, has the object of securing uniform
interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its consistency,
its full effect and its autonomy as well as, ultimately, the particular
nature of the law established by the Treaties ....

38. The first and second questions referred for a preliminary ruling
must be answered in the light of those considerations.?”

236. The CJEU then organized its analysis into three intermediary questions. The first was
“whether the disputes which the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT is called
on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or application of EU law.”*°° The CJEU

answered this question in the affirmative, reasoning as follows:

40. Even if, as Achmea in particular contends, that tribunal, despite
the very broad wording of Article 8(1) of the BIT, is called on to
tule only on possible infringements of the BIT, the fact remains that
in order to do so it must, in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT,
take account in particular of the law in force of the contracting party
concerned and other relevant agreements between the contracting
parties.

41. Given the nature and characteristics of EU law mentioned in
paragraph 33 above, that law must be regarded both as forming part
of the law in force in every Member State and as deriving from an
international agreement between the Member States.

42. It follows that on that twofold basis the arbitral tribunal referred
to in Article 8 of the BIT may be called on to interpret or indeed to
apply EU law, particularly the provisions concerning the
fundamental freedoms, including freedom of establishment and free
movement of capital.*°!

237. The second intermediate question was “whether an arbitral tribunal such as that referred to in
Article 8 of the BIT is situated within the judicial system of the EU, and in particular whether

it can be regarded as a court or tribunal of a Member State within the meaning of Article 267

2 Achmea {32-38 (citations omitted), RLM-12.
300 Achmea 39, RLM-12.
301 Achmea 40-42, RLM-12.

78

238.

TFEU.”*? The CJEU answered this question in the negative, on the basis that an international
arbitral tribunal is neither part of the judicial system of a single EU Member State nor a court

common to a number of such States.5°7

The CJEU’s third intermediate question was “whether an arbitral award made by such a
tribunal is, in accordance with Article 19 TEU in particular, subject to review by a court of a
Member State, ensuring that the questions of EU law which the tribunal may have to address
can be submitted to the Court by means of a reference for a preliminary ruling.”* It noted
that under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, a tribunal may choose its own seat, and it was
only by virtue of the chosen seat in this instance being Frankfurt that a set-aside proceeding
was brought in the German courts.3°5 Even in these circumstances, moreover, judicial review
was limited by German law to the validity of the arbitration agreement and the consistency of
the award with public policy.*°° While the CJEU had accepted the notion of limited review of
commercial awards, “provided that the fundamental provisions of EU law can be examined
in the course of that review and, if necessary, be the subject of a reference to the Court for a

9307

preliminary ruling, it considered that “arbitration proceedings such as those referred to in

Article 8 of the BIT are different from commercial arbitration proceedings.” The CJEU

explained as follows:

While the latter originate in the freely expressed wishes of the
parties, the former derive from a treaty by which Member States
agree to remove from the jurisdiction of their own courts, and hence
from the system of judicial remedies which the second subparagraph
of Article 19(1) TEU requires them to establish in the fields covered
by EU law ..., disputes which may concern the application or
interpretation of EU law. In those circumstances, the considerations
set out in the preceding paragraph relating to commercial arbitration
cannot be applied to arbitration proceedings such as those referred
to in Article 8 of the BIT.2%

308 Achmea { 55 (citations omitted), RLM-12.

79

239.

240.

Based on this analysis, the CJEU considered as follows:

56. Consequently, having regard to all the characteristics of the
arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT ..., it must be
considered that, by concluding the BIT, the Member States parties
to it established a mechanism for settling disputes between an
investor and a Member State which could prevent those disputes
from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness
of EU law, even though they might concern the interpretation or
application of that law.

57. It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an
international agreement providing for the establishment of a court
responsible for the interpretation of its provisions and whose
decisions are binding on the institutions, including the Court of
Justice, is not in principle incompatible with EU law. The
competence of the EU in the field of international relations and its
capacity to conclude international agreements necessarily entail the
power to submit to the decisions of a court which is created or
designated by such agreements as regards the interpretation and
application of their provisions, provided that the autonomy of the
EU and its legal order is respected ....

58. In the present case, however, apart from the fact that the disputes
falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in
Article 8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that
agreement and of EU law, the possibility of submitting those
disputes to a body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU
is provided for by an agreement which was concluded not by the EU
but by Member States. Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into
question not only the principle of mutual trust between the Member
States but also the preservation of the particular nature of the law
established by the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary ruling
procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not therefore
compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation referred to in
paragraph 34 above.

59. In those circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse
effect on the autonomy of EU law.°°?

The CJEU accordingly concluded as follows:

60. Consequently, the answer to Questions 1 and 2 is that
Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the BIT, under which an investor from

3 Achmea ¥{ 56-59, RLM-12.

80

241.

242.

one of those Member States may, in the event of a dispute
concerning investments in the other Member State, bring
proceedings against the latter Member State before an arbitral
tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to
accept.

62. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules:

Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a
provision in an international agreement concluded between Member
States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and
reciprocal protection of investments between the Kingdom of the
Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic, under
which an investor from one of those Member States may, in the
event of a dispute concerning investments in the other Member
State, bring proceedings against the latter Member State before an
arbitral tribunal whose jurisdiction that Member State has
undertaken to accept.*!°

b. Scope of Achmea as it Pertains to Articles 267 and 344 TFEU

Croatia argues that Achmea must be construed as determining that the arbitration clauses
of all intra-EU BITs are incompatible with Articles 267 and 344 TFEU. In its view, the
CJEU’s use of the phrase “such as Article 8 of the [Netherlands-Slovakia BIT]” in its
dispositif (paragraph 62 of Achmea) is a descriptive phrase denoting Article 8 in toto as a
submission to arbitration, and should not be limited to any specific aspect of Article 8, such

as the choice of law clause in Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.*!!

The Tribunal begs to differ. Like the Eskosol tribunal before it, the Tribunal considers that
the phrase “such as Article 8” was inserted to refer to particular characteristics of Article
8, and make clear that the CJEU’s holding would be extended to “comparable provisions”

in other BITs.*'? As to which features of a BIT might “supply the requisite similarities,”

380 Achmea 60, 62, RLM-12.

31

See, e.g., Tr. Day 1, 95:3-8 (contending that the CJEU “conclusively and bindingly clarified [in Achmea] that all
arbitration clauses and bilateral investment treaties entered into between EU Member States are incompatible with
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU”) (emphasis added); Resp. PHB1 {| 64, 66 (arguing that there is “no textual basis”
in Achmea to assume that the CJEU’s “such as” phrase concerned the choice of law clause in Article 8(6) in particular,

and therefore limited the CJEU’s holding to BITs with comparable choice of law clauses).
312 Eskosol | 169, CLM-192.

81

243.

244.

245.

246.

the Tribunal further agrees with Eskosol that the “most important” feature for the CJEU’s
analysis was Article 8’s choice of law clause, because “the CJEU was at pains throughout
its analysis ... to emphasize a concern about submission to arbitration of disputes requiring
application of law.”?°

Several aspects of the CJEU’s reasoning illustrate the centrality of choice of law to its

analysis and conclusions.

First, the questions submitted to the CJEU by the Bundesgerichtshof were broadly framed,
as general questions which addressed all intra-EU BITs submitting claims to arbitration,
regardless of choice of law.*!* As noted above, the CJEU not only reformulated the
question to include the phrase “such as Article 8,”*!> but it went on in its analysis to
emphasize the choice of law issue. This is evident in the CJEU’s description of both the
“principle ... enshrined in” Article 344 TFEU (as a Member State undertaking “not to
submit a dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the [EU] Treaties” outside
the EU court system) and the “object” of Article 267 TFEU (“of securing uniform

interpretation of EU law”).?!°

Second, the CJEU’s central focus on choice of law issues is evident in the care it took to
distinguish international treaties which establish dispute resolution mechanisms
responsible only for “the interpretation and application of their provisions,” i.e., of the
standards and obligations set out in the treaties themselves.*!? The CJEU emphasized that
it had no objection to the submission of such pure international law issues to the decision-

making of courts or tribunals outside the EU structure.

Third, that distinction was further emphasized by the CJEU’s emphasis, for purposes of its
concern, on only two of the four parts of the choice of law provision in Article 8(6) of the

Netherlands-Slovakia BIT. In particular, the CJEU referred to Article 8(6)’s mandate that

313 Eskosol (9 169, 171, CLM-192.

36 Achmea {¥ 32, 37, RLM-12 (emphasis added).
317 Achmea 57, RLM-12 (emphasis added).

82

247.

disputes under the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT be decided not only based on “the provisions
of this Agreement” and “the general principles of international law” — elements which (as
above) it confirmed would not run afoul of Articles 344 and 267 TFEU — but also based on
“the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned” and “other relevant agreements
between the Contracting Parties.”?!® The CJEU specifically stated that “[e]ven if” the
claims in the Achmea arbitration only involved alleged infringements of the BIT, “the fact
remains that in order to” rule on such claims, the arbitral tribunal “must, in accordance
with Article 8(6) of the BIT, take account in particular of the law in force of the contracting
party concerned and other relevant agreements between the contracting parties,” both of
which “must be regarded” as including EU law.*!? Tellingly, the CJEU concluded that “on
that twofold basis” — namely, those two elements of Article 8(6)’s choice of two clause, as
distinguished from the other two unobjectionable elements — a tribunal under the
Netherlands-Slovakia BIT would have to “interpret or indeed to apply EU law.”*?° It was
this conclusion, about the “twofold” elements of the particular choice of law clause in that
particular BIT, which led to the CJEU to state that “/cJonsequently, having regard to all
the characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article 8 of the BIT,” that the
provision in question was precluded by Articles 267 and 344 TFEU.**! The CJEU repeated
the phrase “/cJonsequently” in the paragraph immediately transitioning to its dispositif>?
making clear that the dispositif was based on the particular findings that preceded it, namely

those about the scope and implications of the choice of law clause in the applicable BIT.

The Tribunal thus agrees with the Eskosol tribunal that “nothing in the CJEU’s Judgment
suggested that EU Member States were barred from offering to arbitrate disputes under
treaties not governed even in part by EU law, but only by express treaty provisions and by

general principles of international law.”>” As the Eskosol tribunal further explained:

The Achmea Judgment was not predicated on the exclusive

competence of the EU to enter into such treaties on its Member

States’ behalf. Rather, the Tribunal understands the Achmea

Judgment more narrowly, as objecting only to treaty provisions that

by their terms give tribunals the authority (or indeed the mandate)

to decide a dispute among other things by reference to EU law, in

either or both of the “twofold” aspects the CJEU identified. Put

otherwise, it appears that EU Member States may bring arbitral

tribunals into being for the purposes of deciding treaty disputes

under general principles of international law, but are no longer

allowed to authorize such disputes to apply EU law in addition.**+
This reading of Achmea is also supported by the distinction about applicable law which the
Commission itself had urged the CJEU to adopt, in its 2016 submission in the Achmea
case. The Commission took pains to distinguish between investment treaties under which
EU law was part of the governing law, and those (such as with non-EU Member States)
under which arbitrations “concern only the application and interpretation of the Agreement
and not the rest of Union law.” Importantly, the Commission acknowledged that EU law
still might play a role in disputes under these third-country treaties, depending on the facts
alleged, and that tribunals empowered under those treaties therefore might have to interpret
EU law, but it explained that in such cases the “interpretation [of EU law] plays a role
only as a factual element in the context of the finding of a possible breach of the agreement
and in no way binds the courts of the Union.”??5 The Commission argued to the CJEU that
no incompatibility with the acquis therefore arose, because notwithstanding these possible
interpretations of EU law as issues of fact, “‘arbitral tribunals operating on the basis of these
agreements must therefore only apply the investment protection rules enshrined in
international law between the Union and the third country, and not those provided by Union

law.7326

Moreover, the CJEU reinforced this distinction in its Opinion 1/17, rendered after Achmea,
upholding the legality under the EU acquis of the investment dispute settlement provisions
of the CETA.*”’ In this decision, which is just as much a part of the acquis as Achmea, the
CJEU began by reiterating its statement in Achmea that an international treaty establishing
a mechanism for interpretation of its own provisions “is, in principle, compatible with EU
law.”*8 Tt further stated that the fact the CETA established a dispute resolution mechanism
that was “indeed separate from” the EU court system did not render it incompatible per se
with the EU acquis.*? The key point, the CJEU emphasized, was that “EU law does not
preclude” a treaty conferring on a tribunal “the jurisdiction to interpret and apply the
provisions of the [treaty] having regard to the rules and principles of international law
applicable between the Parties,” so long as the tribunal was not granted the power “to
interpret and apply provisions of [EU law].”°°° The CJEU then emphasized that under the
CETA’s applicable law provision, alleged breaches of CETA were to be determined by
applying the terms of CETA itself and “other rules and principles of international law,” but
the CETA tribunal could not “determine the legality of a measure ... under the domestic
law of a Party.”*?! The CJEU distinguished “the investment agreement at issue in” Achmea
on several grounds, the very first of which was that under its applicable law, a tribunal
“would be called upon to give rulings on disputes that might concern the interpretation or

application of EU law.”**?

Importantly, the CJEU went on to discuss what it meant by “interpretation and application
of EU law,” in the context of a treaty-based dispute. It indicated that it was not troubled by
the CETA’s express provision that “in determining the consistency of a measure with this
Agreement, the [CETA] Tribunal may consider, as appropriate, the domestic law of a
Party as a matter of fact,” because it would be guided by the “prevailing interpretation” of

domestic law provided by domestic courts, and in any event “any meaning given to

domestic law by the [CETA] Tribunal shall not be binding upon” those courts.*7? The
CJEU further explained this distinction between considering EU law “as a matter of fact”
(acceptable under the acquis) and purporting to offer binding interpretations of EU law

(not acceptable under the acquis), as follows:

Those provisions serve no other purpose than to reflect the fact that
the CETA Tribunal, when it is called upon to examine the
compliance with the CETA of the measure that is challenged by an
investor and that has been adopted by the investment host State or
by the Union, will inevitably have to undertake, on the basis of the
information and arguments presented to it by that investor and by
that State or by the Union, an examination of the effect of that
measure. That examination may, on occasion, require that the
domestic law of the respondent Party be taken into account.
However, ... that examination cannot be classified as equivalent to
an interpretation, by the CETA Tribunal of that domestic law, but
consists, on the contrary, of that domestic law being taken into
account as a matter of fact ....°*

Based on this understanding — that taking EU law “into account as a matter of fact” “cannot
be classified as equivalent to an interpretation” of EU law — the CJEU concluded that the
CETA’s dispute resolution provisions were compatible with the EU acquis. It emphasized
again that the governing law of CETA, and hence the “powers of interpretation” of CETA
tribunals, were “confined to the provisions of the CETA in the light of the rules and
principles of international law ....”**° These of course were the same two categories of
applicable law that the CJEU had not objected to in Achmea, when it framed its concern
there as only about the other “twofold” elements of the four-part applicable law clause in

the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT.**°

Commission emphasized essentially the same distinction in an Explanatory Note it issued

Commission explained that it proposed adding a new footnote to the ECT “making explicit
that domestic law is not part of the applicable law to a dispute and that it can only be
considered by a tribunal as a matter of fact.”**” Notably, the ECT’s existing applicable law
clause (Article 26(6)) calls for disputes to be decided only under “this Treaty and applicable
rules and principles of international law.”*** Neither of these categories incorporates EU
law, either as part of the law in force in the host State or as arising from other treaties
between two or more of the ECT Parties.**? The Commission does not suggest otherwise,
but rather states an intent now to “mak[e] explicit” what the Commission therefore
apparently accepts as already implicit, namely that a provision limiting the applicable law
to the terms of a treaty itself and to general rules and principles of international law does
not thereby incorporate domestic law (i.e., EU law) as “part of the applicable law to a
dispute.”*“° The actual proposed footnote confirms that this is intended simply “[flor
greater certainty” about the existing text, and not to enact a substantive change.*4!
Moreover, the Commission evidently accepts that a tribunal’s consideration of EU law
purely “as a matter of fact,” in the course of deciding such a dispute, would not be

incompatible with the EU acquis.°**~ It can be presumed that the Commission would not

urge adoption of a clarifying footnote that it considered incompatible with the acquis. The

is consistent with the position that it urged the CJEU to adopt in Achmea. The two
Commission statements are useful bookends to that effect before and after the two CJIEU

decisions (Achmea and the CETA Opinion) which adopt the same distinction.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not have to enter into an abstract intellectual
debate about the “normative utility” of the CJEU’s “fact/law distinction,” as discussed by

the Parties’ experts in this case,

or evaluate Professor Douglas’ arguments (cited by
Croatia) about the logic or illogic of distinguishing between national law as a referenced
fact versus as part of a treaty’s applicable law.*4 Whatever the answer to that interesting
question as an academic matter is, the fact remains that the CJEU itself has adopted the
distinction. The distinction therefore must be recognized as an integral part of the EU

acquis.

As a result, the Tribunal considers the EU acquis — as reflected in Achmea and the CETA
Opinion which are authoritative interpretations of the EU acquis — to provide that (a)
treaties whose applicable law raises the same functional concerns as the CJEU found
objectionable under the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT would in that respect be incompatible
with Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU, but (b) treaties whose applicable law is limited to
the terms of the treaties themselves and general principles of international law, which the
CJEU found not to be problematic in either Achmea or the CETA Opinion, would not be
incompatible with Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU. The latter conclusion remains the
case under the acquis even if EU law might have to be “taken into account as a matter of
fact” in a particular case for purposes of applying the governing international law standards

(in the language of the CETA Opinion).

Based on this determination, and as noted by the Eskosol tribunal, there is therefore a need
“to determine whether the danger [recognized in Achmea] actually arises in the context of
a particular treaty” at issue in a different case. The Tribunal accordingly turns below to the

Austria-Croatia BIT in particular.

c. Implications of Achmea for the Austria-Croatia BIT

The first observation is that on its face, the Austria-Croatia BIT contains no equivalent
express incorporation into its applicable law of either category of law that the CJEU found
offending in Article 8(6) of the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT at issue in Achmea (the domestic
law of the host State, or other relevant agreements between the Contracting Parties).
Equally true, however, is that the Austria-Croatia BIT contains no express exclusion of
those elements from its applicable law. There is simply no express provision addressing

the issue of applicable law either way.

This does not mean, however, that the BIT should be construed as having no applicable
law at all. A treaty is not an empty vessel with no governing law whatsoever, until some
is assigned to it through resort to the default rules of a particular dispute resolution
mechanism. Under the very definition of a treaty provided by Article 2(1)(a) of the VCLT,
a treaty is “an international agreement concluded between States in written form and
governed by international law ....”>4> In other words, the starting proposition for any treaty
is that, by virtue of entering into that arrangement, its Contracting States have agreed that
it shall be interpreted by reference not only to its terms (on which those States have
expressly agreed), but also by reference to general principles of international law (on which
those States have implicitly agreed). If the Contracting Parties wish to add other elements
to the applicable law, they generally would do so through incorporation of an express
provision to that effect, as the Netherlands and Slovakia for example did in Article 8(6) of
their BIT. If the Contracting Parties do not wish to add other elements to the implicit
applicable law arising from the VCLT, they do not need to include an express applicable
law provision, although of course they may choose to do so for avoidance of doubt. The
fact that they do not include any express clause does not, however, connote that the
Contracting States had no shared understanding at all regarding the issue. It certainly does
not connote that they had a shared intention to depart from the basic VCLT proposition
that treaties are governed by their express terms and by reference to general principles of

international law.

¥5 VCLT Article 2(1)(a).

89

258. The Tribunal’s second observation is that investment treaties often offer investors a choice
among several arbitration rules for the administration of proceedings that the investors may
initiate, pursuant to standing offers of arbitration in the treaties themselves. Article 9(2) of
the Austria-Croatia BIT offers investors a choice between the ICSID Arbitration Rules and
the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; other treaties may offer options of arbitration under the
tules of the International Chamber of Commerce (“ICC”), the Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce (“SCC”), or other institutions. Each of these institutional rules has some default
mechanism for determining applicable law in the absence of party agreement, but the
content of those rules differs from one set of rules to another.*° The Tribunal sees no
reason to assume that in offering such choices, the Contracting States intended the treaty
itself to be interpreted differently, based on which procedural mechanism different
investors might choose to elect.**” A particular jurisdictional requirement in a treaty, or a
particular substantive obligation imposed by a treaty, should not have a different meaning
for a tribunal constituted under the ICSID Arbitration Rules than it would for a tribunal
constituted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the ICC Rules, or the SCC Rules.
Either way, the treaty says what it says, and a tribunal constituted under any set of
procedural rules should apply that treaty according to its terms (interpreted in accordance
with VCLT principles of treaty interpretation), as well as in accordance with general

principles of international law which apply to all such treaties.

259. In the view of the Tribunal, Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not mandate a

different approach to interpretation of investment treaties. This is not only because, as a

§6 For example, Article 35(1) of the 2013 UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules provides that in the absence of party
agreement on applicable law, “the arbitral tribunal shall apply the law which it determines to be appropriate,” a broad
discretion that is echoed in Article 21(1) of the 2017 ICC Arbitration Rules (“apply the rules of law which it determines
to be appropriate”) and Article 27(1) of the 2017 SCC Rules (“apply the law or rules of law that it considers most
appropriate”). The application of such discretion may or may not lead to the same outcome as the default rule in ICSID
Convention Article 42(1), which specifically requires, in the absence of party agreement on applicable law, that “the
Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws)
and such rules of international law as may be applicable.”

37 Of course, the choice of a particular procedural mechanism may result in the imposition of additional jurisdictional
requirements, such as (for example) those derived from the ICSID Convention. This possibility arises because two
different treaties have now come into play, potentially giving rise to a need to satisfy the requirements of both (the so-
called “double keyhole” scenario). However, that does not mean that the underlying treaty which offered ICSID
arbitration in the first place (e.g., the Austria-Croatia BIT in this case) should itself be given a different meaning.

90

general principle which Croatia itself invokes for a different purpose in its pleadings, “the
ICSID Convention is irrelevant for the interpretation of the instrument of consent.”** It
also must be recalled that Article 42(1), along with the rest of the Convention, was
developed at a time when contractual agreements between States and investors were
expected to be the main source of consent to arbitrate disputes — and certainly before the
proliferation of investment treaties (“arbitration without privity”) became an alternate path
to arbitration for investors with whom States had no direct contractual agreements.*? In
that context, it is hardly surprising that Article 42(1) was constructed to begin with a
reaffirmation about the primacy of consent between the two disputing parties: “The
Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of law as may be agreed by
the parties.”*°° But in the newer “arbitration without privity” world of investment treaties,
it is far less likely that there will be any direct agreement on applicable law between the
disputing parties (the investor and the State).*°! Therefore, any such agreement generally
must be found through the same two-step process by which mutual consent to arbitrate is
formed in the first place — namely with (first) a standing offer of arbitration agreed between
Contracting States, and (second) an acceptance of that standing offer by a particular
qualified investor. This means, of course, that one looks to the investment treaty itself for
the “offer” of applicable law, and that the investor’s consent to that applicable law is

implicit in its invocation of the treaty as the basis for commencing arbitration.

would be incorporated in an investment agreement”).

The AAPL tribunal observed that in this new world of treaty-based rather than contract-based arbitration, “the prior
choice-of-law referred to” the first sentence of Article 42(1) “could hardly be envisaged” as involving an agreement
directly between the disputing parties, because they will have had “no opportunity to exercise their right to choose in
advance the applicable law determining the rules governing the various aspects of their eventual dispute.” AAPL, {| 19.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal believes that by accepting an offer to arbitrate
contained in an investment treaty that does not contain an express applicable law clause,
but which nonetheless is implicitly governed by its own terms and by international law
under VCLT Article 2(1)(a), an investor thereby agrees to such applicable law for the
proceedings. In these circumstances, there generally will be no need to proceed to the
second sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which supplies a default
applicable law “[i]n the absence of [an] agreement” between the disputing parties.*>? In the
context of contractual arbitration in which the ICSID Convention Articles were developed,
it was entirely possible that a (poorly drafted) contract might reflect no agreement at all on
applicable law. But in the context of treaty-based arbitration, it is difficult to imagine a
treaty which does not reflect at least an implicit agreement on applicable law, based on the
treaty’s terms and general principles of international law. This is particularly so since
investment treaties incorporate by mutual agreement among Contracting States certain
substantive standards of behavior — essentially, “thou shalt do x” and “thou shalt not do y”
— which themselves were developed in the context of international law (expropriation, fair
and equitable treatment, etc.). The Tribunal agrees with Addiko that these standards form
a lex specialis that the Contracting States agree to govern their respective relationships with
each other’s investors, and which the investors in turn accept to govern any disputes

alleging non-compliance with those standards.*°

This approach to ICSID Convention Article 42(1) in the context of investment treaties is
consistent with that of a number of prior tribunals. For example, the tribunal in ADC v.
Hungary considered that “by consenting to arbitration under [a BIT between Hungary and
Cyprus], the Parties also consented to the applicability of the provisions of the Treaty,”

which “are Treaty provisions pertaining to international law. That consent falls under the

352 ICSID Convention Article 42(1) (second sentence) (“In the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply
the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of
international law as may be applicable.”).

353 See, e.g., Tr. Day 1, 247:6-20, 248:7-19; Cl. PHB1 49] 9, 79, 104-106 (arguing inter alia that “[t]his implicit choice
of international law is a common occurrence and follows naturally from the nature of the Treaty as a creature of public
international law”).

262.

first sentence of Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention ....”**4 The consent so expressed
“must also be deemed to comprise a choice for general international law, including
customary international law, if and to the extent that it comes into play for interpreting and
applying the provisions of the Treaty.”*°> The ADC tribunal reasoned that this approach
would be consistent with “the generally accepted presumption in conflict of laws ... that
parties choose one coherent set of legal rules governing their relationship ..., rather than
various sets of legal rules, unless the contrary is clearly expressed.”**° By contrast, an
approach which found the treaty not to reflect already an implicit agreement on applicable
law would require a resort to the default rules of different arbitral institutions (in that case
ICSID and the ICC) to determine the applicable law, depending which of those offered in
the treaty a given investor chose to accept. Yet “[t]he application of those subsidiary
conflict rules may give differing results, which in turn may affect the manner in which the
Treaty provisions, in particular the substantive ones, are to be interpreted and applied.”?>”
The tribunal considered that “[i]t cannot be deemed to have been the intent of the State

Parties to the BIT to have agreed to such a potential disparity.”*>*

Similarly, the ad hoc committee deciding the annulment application in Azurix v. Argentina
rejected an argument that the tribunal had disregarded applicable law by determining that
its inquiry was governed “by the ICSID Convention, by the BIT and by applicable
international law,” and not also by the national law of Argentina.**? The Azurix committee
did not believe the tribunal was obliged to apply Argentine law by virtue of the second
sentence of Article 42(1), because that sentence “cannot possibly be understood as having
the effect that, in the absence of an express choice of law clause, the municipal law of the

Contracting State will be the applicable law in claims for alleged breaches of an investment

treaty.”°° Rather, the committee reasoned that the treaty already reflected an implicit
choice of law, because “[b]y definition, a treaty is governed by international law” (citing
Article 2(1)(a) of the VCLT.*°! Since an investment treaty in particular “is itself a source
of international law as between the State parties to that treaty,” the Committee found, “the
applicable law in any claim for a breach of that treaty can thus be said to be the treaty itself
specifically, and international law generally,” the latter referring to “general principles of

international law, including principles of the international law of treaties.”*°

The Azurix committee acknowledged that in some cases, an investment treaty itself might
refer to provisions of national law. The example it identified was where the treaty expressly
required a host State “to comply with specified provisions of its own municipal law,” with
the result that a host State’s breach of municipal law “may thus amount to a breach of the
treaty.”°© The committee explained that in such cases municipal law still “does not as such
form part of the law applicable to a claim for breach of a treaty,” even though “it may be
necessary to determine whether there has been a breach of municipal law as a step in
determining whether there has been a breach of the treaty.”**+ The correct framework in
such circumstances, the committee said, was that previously identified by the International
Law Commission, under which “internal law is relevant to the question of international
responsibility,” but “this is because the rule of international law makes it relevant, e.g., by
incorporating the standard of compliance with internal law as the applicable international
standard or as an aspect of it.”*°> The provisions of national law thus become “relevant as
facts in applying the applicable international standard,” particularly when they “are
actually incorporated in some form, conditionally or unconditionally, into that standard,”

but international law remains the governing law of the dispute.**° The Azurix committee

concluded that “even in this situation, municipal law would not thereby become part of the
applicable law under Article 42 of the ICSID Convention for purposes of determining
whether there was a breach of ... the BIT. Rather, any breach of municipal law that might
be established would be a fact or element to which the terms of the BIT and international
law would be applied in order to determine whether there was a breach of” the applicable

BIT standard.>°7

In the view of this Tribunal, the same proposition identified by the Azurix committee
logically would apply also to other treaty provisions which expressly or implicitly make
aspects of national law relevant to application of the treaty standard. For example, Croatia
argues that Article 11(1) of the Austria-Croatia BIT requires investments to have been
made “in accordance with [Croatian] legislation” as a precondition for qualifying for BIT
protection, and contends that this includes Croatian consumer protection law, of which “EU
law formed an intrinsic part.”*°* But even if so, this just means — again echoing the words
of the CJEU in the CETA Opinion — that Croatian law must be “taken into account as a

matter of fact?*°

in applying the BIT’s own stated requirements; Croatian law becomes
relevant only because the applicable rule of international law — the treaty provision —
“makes it relevant.”?”° In considering issues of Croatian law (which Croatia contends
“adopted and approximated the regulatory framework of EU law” in the consumer
protection area),*”! the tribunal would be looking to the interpretations of relevant Croatian
and EU courts, just as international tribunals frequently look to the decisions of national
courts to understand what the law is in a particular country. But that does not mean that

Croatian law or EU law becomes part of the applicable law of the treaty, much less the

legal basis for deciding the jurisdictional objection presented under the treaty. Those

remain the terms of the treaty itself, together with general principles of international law.”

265. There are other examples of ICSID tribunals finding that investment treaties inherently
reflect an agreement on applicable law, for purposes of the first sentence of Article 42(1)
of the ICSID Convention, even where the treaties do not contain an express choice of law
provision. For example, in Alpha Projecktholding v. Ukraine, the tribunal noted that the
applicable BIT did not contain “any express guidance on the governing law,”>” but
nonetheless determined that the dispute over an alleged breach “can only be answered by
reference to the [BIT’s] own terms. The Tribunal will apply the provisions of the [BIT]
and interpret the [BIT] in a manner consistent with customary international law,” although
where national law defined the parties’ rights and obligations under certain contracts

relevant to the dispute, “such questions will be decided as questions of fact.”>”4

266. The Tribunal acknowledges that certain other ICSID tribunals have followed a different
approach, presuming that the absence of an express applicable law clause in a treaty meant
the absence of agreement on applicable law, and therefore requiring resort to the default
approach set out in the second sentence of Article 42(1).7”> In a number of such cases,
however, it is not clear that the issue of an implicit agreement by the Contracting States

with respect to applicable law, accepted by the investor in invoking the treaty, was even

3? The same is true for the areas in which Croatia says EU law may be relevant to resolving Addiko’s merits claims.

See Resp. PHB1 J 174-184. Even if so, the Tribunal views that relevance the same way the CJEU framed the point
in the CETA Opinion, namely as one of factual background which may be taken in account in the application of treaty
standards (e.g., “fair and equitable treatment”), but not as the applicable law of the dispute, and not purporting to bind
the EU courts in their separate interpretation and application of EU law. See similarly Eskosol { 123, CLM-192
(explaining that an ECT tribunal “could ... consider EU law as a matter of fact if potentially relevant to the merits of
a dispute, just as an ECT tribunal may consider a State’s domestic law as part of the factual matrix of a case”)

argued to the tribunals.*”° Even in the few cases where it apparently was,*”’ there is no

evidence that the tribunals considered the corollary question that follows from rejecting the
notion of any such implicit agreement, namely whether the Contracting States really could
have intended the applicable law of disputes under their treaty to depend on which
institutional rules different claimants selected (e.g., ICSID versus UNCITRAL). The
Tribunal considers this to be an important factor, as discussed above, and believes the
correct approach is that adopted thoughtfully among others by the ADC tribunal and the

Azurix ad hoc committee.

267. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that the applicable law of the Austria-Croatia BIT
consists of the terms of that BIT itself, which set for a Jex specialis to govern any disputes
initiated by investors accepting the offer of arbitration extended by the BIT, together with
general principles of international law which may help to inform the concepts embedded
in the treaty terms. These are precisely the sources of applicable law that the CJEU accepted
in both Achmea and the CETA Opinion as presenting no incompatibility with the EU

acquis. Moreover, the Austria-Croatia BIT does not incorporate EU law as part of its

applicable law, as did the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT which the CJEU found incompatible

for that reason with the EU acquis.

268. For the avoidance of doubt, this conclusion is not altered by the existence of Article 11(2)

of the BIT, because contrary to Croatia’s contention,°”8

that provision does not function as
an applicable law clause at all; rather, it presents an exception to the Contracting Parties’
being bound by the BIT. As its terms state, if circumstances arise that make the BIT (or
certain of its provisions) incompatible with the EU acquis in force at a given time, “[t]he
Contracting Parties are not bound by the present Agreement” (emphasis added). But
nothing in Article 11(2) purports to supply the applicable law for interpreting other BIT
terms in cases where the Contracting Parties remain bound. Article 11(2) does not state

that the BIT itself should be interpreted and applied under EU law.

269. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Austria-Croatia BIT does not present the
same functional concerns about applicable law that the CJEU found were present in the
Netherlands-Slovakia BIT, rendering arbitration under that BIT in its view incompatible
with Articles 344 and 267 of the TFEU.*” This remains the case even if, to some extent,
certain issues of EU law may need to be “taken into account as a matter of fact” for
purposes of applying the BIT’s governing international law standards, based on the way
the Parties have pleaded various other jurisdictional and merits issues in the case. The
Tribunal agrees with Croatia that in most cases, the compatibility of a BIT with the acquis

will not depend on specific allegations raised in a particular case, but rather must be

378 Resp. PHB1 {fff 110, 148.

5” Because the Tribunal so finds with regard to the Austria-Croatia BIT, it need not reach the additional distinction
with Achmea that Addiko proffered, to the effect that Achmea concerned an UNCITRAL rather than an ICSID
arbitration. In Addiko’s view, the CJEU’s ruling did not reach the issue of offers to arbitrate under the ICSID
Convention, which would require additional analy: ‘iven State Parties’ independent obligations under that separate
multilateral treaty involving both EU Member States and third states. See, e.g., Cl. PHB1 {ff 77-78, 85-86, 91, 94-102;
Cl. PHB2 {I 51-60. By contrast, Croatia argues that Achmea cannot be limited to non-ICSID cases, because the issue
of ICSID Convention obligations does not arise unless and until there is a valid consent to arbitrate in the first place,
such as through a BIT; the validity of an offer to arbitrate therefore must be determined on its own merits and in light
of the EU acquis, and not by reasoning backwards from the ICSID Convention. See, e.g., Resp. PHB! {{f 35, 61-62,
93; Resp. PHB2 {| 16. While both Parties present interesting arguments on these points, the Tribunal’s determination
that the Austria~Croatia BIT does not designate EU law as part of its applicable law (the way the Netherlands-Slovakia
BIT did) renders the CJEU’s ruling in Achmea inapposite to this BIT, and thereby makes it unnecessary for the tribunal
to assess any operative differences between the two paths to arbitration offered under the BIT.

assessed based on the treaty itself,**° considering issues of its applicable law as the Tribunal
has done above. At most the pleadings in a particular case may require, in the words of the
CJEU in the CETA Opinion, that EU law “be taken into account ... as a matter of fact” in
applying the governing treaty standards,**! but nothing in that possibility results in EU law
becoming the applicable law of the arbitration, or in the arbitration clause of the BIT

becoming incompatible with the EU acquis, for the reasons detailed above.

d. Application to Pre-Achmea BIT Cases

For the reasons above, the Tribunal concludes that arbitration under the Austria-Croatia
BIT is not incompatible with the EU acquis, and hence Croatia remains bound by the offer
to arbitrate reflected in that BIT. However, for avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal also
concludes that, even if (arguendo) the CJEU’s judgment in Achmea were to be interpreted
more broadly — as not hinging on the applicable law of particular BITs, but rather
precluding all intra-EU BIT arbitration regardless of applicable law — that interpretation
could not be applied to release Austria and Croatia from their expressly promised
““rrevocabl[e] consent[] in advance” to arbitration,*** in cases where investors acted to
accept that ostensibly valid offer before Achmea was decided, and therefore itself became

part of the acquis.

In reaching this conclusion, the Tribunal emphasizes that it is not purporting to resolve the
debate between the Parties (and their respective experts) about the ex tunc or ex nunc effect
of Achmea as a matter of EU law. Rather, the Tribunal rests its conclusion on the interaction
of two factors: the express reference in Article 11(2) of the BIT the acquis “in force at any
given time,” and certain general principles regarding invalidity of treaty provisions to

which both Contracting Parties agreed in the VCLT.

First, the Tribunal recalls its discussion in Section V.B above about the evolving nature of
the EU acquis, and the limitation in Section 11(2) to the acquis as it was “in force” at the

“given time” relevant to consent to arbitrate, which the Parties here agree was 27

September 2017. As of that date, while the TFEU was obviously “in force,” the Achmea
interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 had not yet been rendered, and in fact the only then-
extant interpretation of those Articles, by an authority whose interpretations were capable
of being considered part of the acquis, was Advocate General Wathelet’s, which was
rendered on 19 September 2017, just eight days before the critical date in this arbitration **
While the CJEU subsequently rejected elements of Advocate General Wathelet’s
interpretation, and his Opinion thereby ceased to that extent to be part of the acquis, that

had not yet occurred at the “given time” relevant here.

The Tribunal accepts that under an ex tunc view of the Achmea Judgment, one might posit
in hindsight that the TFEU already had the meaning the CJEU later ascribed to it, even
though Advocate General Wathelet did not then perceive it and the CJEU had not
previously had occasion to pronounce it. The Tribunal acknowledges the UniCredit
tribunal’s concern that such a proposition could undermine the force of the “at any given
time” language of Article 11(2), because “[e]ven if there is ex tunc application of an EU
judgment by virtue of a subsequent interpretation, that application is by virtue of a
subsequent event” which had not yet occurred at the “given time” relevant to formation of
consent.**4 The UniCredit tribunal considered that “if the intent had been to enshrine the
ex tunc principle in the Treaty, Article 11(2) would have been written without the ‘in force

...’ clause or would have been written with far more precision.”?*5

Be that as it may, one thing is clear: if intra-EU BIT arbitration was broadly incompatible
with the TFEU from the moment of each new EU Member State’s accession, then this
ostensible defect in intra-EU BITs was overlooked not only by Advocate General Wathelet

in his Opinion in Achmea, but also for many critical years by multiple other participants in

385 UniCredit 2018 Decision { 123, CLM-136. The tribunal concluded that the BIT “does not admit of conditions
subsequent,” and therefore that “the only conditionality that Article 11(2) of the BIT could bring to bear on Article 9
would be if, at the time a claim is i there is i i ‘y between the i offer made
by the Respondent for arbitration and the EU acquis by virtue of decisions or conduct that has occurred prior to that
date.” Id. §{ 123-124 (emphasis added).

the EU system, including numerous EU Member States and the Commission itself. It is
useful to recall that Croatia and the EU (then referred to as the “European Communities”)
began the process of working towards Croatia’s EU accession in 2001, with a Stabilisation
and Association Agreement which specifically encouraged the conclusion of BITs between
Croatia and existing EU Member States.**° While Austria and Croatia did not need this
particular form of encouragement — they already had concluded their BIT, which entered
into force on 1 November 2009 — the Stabilisation and Association Agreement must be
seen as an official endorsement by the EU of such arrangements. Importantly, nothing in
that Agreement suggested that these BITs would be a transitional arrangement that would
terminate upon Croatia’s accession to the EU. That remained true in the Treaty of
Accession that Croatia and the EU Member States signed in 2011 and that entered into
force in 2013, which expressly required Croatia to withdraw from or amend certain other
pre-accession treaties, but imposed no such obligation on it with respect to intra-EU

BITs.*°”

275. It is therefore hardly surprising that the States involved did not perceive these BITs to be
immediately invalid under the EU acquis upon the moment of EU accession. Croatia did
seek Austria’s opinion in 2011 regarding a possible obligation to terminate the BIT upon
accession, but it did not suggest that it believed the two States would be automatically
relieved of their obligations under the BIT absent termination, by virtue of Article 11(2) or
otherwise. Moreover, Croatia’s own record of the direct consultations confirms Austria’s
response that it did not believe any BIT termination would be appropriate, until the EU
arranged an alternate legal framework in EU law “that would protect the investments in the

same manner as they are protected under the bilateral investment treaties.”*** This

suggested that Austria too understood the BIT as remaining both in force and enforceable

for the time being.

While it is true that the Commission increasingly began to express its views about the
incompatibility issue in a variety of fora, the fact is that certain EU Member States (Austria
included) resisted that notion, which as of the critical date in this case was far from
reflecting a consensus understanding.**° As noted above, in September 2017 Advocate
General Wathelet issued an Opinion rejecting the notion that intra-EU BIT arbitration was
incompatible with the TFEU.*”° This arbitration was registered by ICSID eight days after

that Opinion.

In these circumstances, the best that can be said about the alleged incompatibility of intra-
EU BIT arbitration with the TFEU was that it was certainly not manifest, in the ordinary
meaning of that term as evident or obvious, prior to the CJEU’s finding incompatibility at
least with respect to some such intra-EU BITs in the Achmea Judgment. In these
circumstances, the binding agreement by Austria and Croatia to Articles 46 and 69 of the
VCLT come into play. Article 46 of the VCLT prevents States from invoking provisions
of their own law to invalidate their consent to be bound by a treaty, unless the violation of
internal law “was manifest” in the sense that it “would be objectively evident to any State
conducting itself in the matter in accordance with normal practice and in good faith.”*?!
Article 69 of the VCLT then provides that while treaty invalidity is grounds to render the
provisions of such treaty without legal force, “if acts have nevertheless been performed in
reliance on such a treaty” and “in good faith before the invalidity was invoked,” those acts

“are not rendered unlawful by reason only of the invalidity of the treaty.”

389 Indeed, as late as 14 April 2018 (well after the critical date for jurisdiction in this case), Austria continued to state
its understanding, in direct consultations with Croatia under Article 11(3) of the BIT, that “it considers BITs valid and
that it does not deem them incompatible with the EU law,” and in an event that any issue of “incompatibly should
have effect as of the time when it is established, that is without retroactive effect,” such that even “should the CJEU

decide that the dispute resolution provision i

  

incompatible with the EU law ... Austria considers that such decision

would not change the dispute resolution provision and would have no impact on the pending proceedings.” Minutes

279.

In the Tribunal’s view, this is the case for Addiko’s acceptance of Croatia’s apparent
“irrevocabl[e] consent[] in advance” to arbitration, stated in Article 9(2) of the BIT, which
was done prior to any invalidity in such consent (on grounds of incompatibility with the
EU acquis) being invoked by any authority in the EU whose pronouncements were capable
of forming part of the acquis, and certainly prior to any invalidity becoming “manifest.” It
was not until the CJEU actually issued the Achmea Judgment that it could be said that
investors were placed on notice by a competent authority in the EU legal system about the
risks under that system of relying on the apparent consent to arbitration reflected in Article

9(2) of the BIT.*”

The Tribunal does not suggest that these articles of the VCLT somehow “trump” Article
11(2) of the BIT, regarding the consequences of any incompatibility of the BIT with the
EU acquis. However, nor can it be said that Article 11(2) of the BIT demonstrates an
intention to resile, for purposes of this BIT, from the Parties’ mutual agreement to the basic
principles of public international law reflected in the VCLT. Rather, the BIT must be read
as a whole, including not only its Article 11(2) reference to the acquis “in force at any
given time” (which recognizes that the acquis evolves and that the state of the acquis at a
particular critical date is important), but also its Article 9 commitment to the irrevocability
of Austria and Croatia’s advance offer of consent to arbitrate.*** Both of these provisions
moreover must be read in light of the general principles of international law which are
inherently part of the applicable law of the BIT. In these circumstances, the Tribunal is
unable to accept that, whatever EU law may provide regarding the ex tunc or ex nunc effect
of the Achmea Judgment, Article 11(2) of the BIT mandates that this judgment be applied
to international effect contrary to the basic propositions of both Article 9 of the same BIT
and the generally accepted principles of the VCLT regarding good faith reliance on treaty
validity prior to the invocation of invalidity, so long as the grounds for invalidity were not

already manifest at the time of such reliance.

3° See UniCredit 2018 Decision 131 (emphasizing the importance of the BIT’s language about “irrevocably
consent[ing] in advance” to arbitration, and noting that the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT at issue in Achmea did not
include any such language).

103

280.

281.

282.

The Tribunal thus finds that as a matter of international law, any invalidation of Article
9(2)’s stated “irrevocabl[e] consent[] in advance” to arbitration, by virtue of an
incompatibility with the EU acquis pursuant to Article 11(2) of the BIT, could not be
applied to invalidate a consent to arbitration that was given before the Achmea Judgment,
but only prospectively for investors who had not yet initiated a BIT arbitration. In the
Tribunal’s view, this conclusion holds whether the Achmea Judgment itself is considered

under EU law to be applied ex nunc or alternatively ex tunc.*?

e. Relevance of the Declarations

The Tribunal turns next to the 2019 Declarations by various EU Member States, and in
particular, the Declaration — 15 January 2019 which both Austria and Croatia signed, and
which Croatia therefore invokes as the relevant one for purposes of this case.*”° The
document is entitled “Declaration of Representatives of the Governments of the Member
States on the legal consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea and on
investment protection in the European Union.” Citing Achmea, the Declaration — 15
January 2019 first states that “Member States are bound to draw all necessary consequences
from that judgment pursuant to their obligations under Union law.”*°’ The rest of the
Declaration may be divided into two parts, the first expressing views on certain legal issues
in the wake of the Achmea Judgment,*** and the second declaring that in accordance with
those views, the 22 EU Member States “will undertake the following actions without undue

delay.”3°

Regarding the legal issues, the signatories state inter alia as follows:

Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties
concluded between Member States.' As a consequence, all investor-
State arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties
concluded between Member States are contrary to Union law and
thus inapplicable. They do not produce effects including as regards

provisions that provide for extended protection of investments made
prior to termination for a further period of time (so-called sunset or
grandfathering clauses). An arbitral tribunal established on the basis
of investor-State arbitration clauses lacks jurisdiction, due to a lack
of a valid offer to arbitrate by the Member State party to the
underlying bilateral investment Treaty.*°°

The statement that “Union law takes precedence over bilateral investment treaties concluded
between Member States” contains a footnote which cites certain CJEU judgments and then
asserts, without any analysis or citations, that “[t]he same result follows also under general

public international law, in particular from the relevant provisions of the Vienna Convention

on the Law of the Treaties and customary international law (lex posterior).”*°!

283. Regarding the actions to be taken by the 22 signatories, the Declaration — 15 January 2019

pledges that they will “undertake the following,” inter alia:

1. By the present declaration, Member States inform investment
arbitration tribunals about the legal consequences of the Achmea
judgment, as set out in this declaration, in all pending intra-EU
investment arbitration proceedings brought either under bilateral
investment treaties concluded between Member States or under the
Energy Charter Treaty.

2. In cooperation with a defending Member State, the Member State,
in which an investor that has brought such an action is established,
will take the necessary measures to inform the investment
arbitration tribunals concerned of those consequences. Similarly,
defending Member States will request the courts, including in any
third country, which are to decide in proceedings relating to an intra-
EU investment arbitration award, to set these awards aside or not to
enforce them due to a lack of valid consent.

3. By the present declaration, Member States inform the investor

community that no new intra-EU investment arbitration should be
initiated.

5. In light of the Achmea judgment, Member States will terminate
all bilateral investment treaties concluded between them by means

400 RLM-41, pp. 1-2.

of a plurilateral treaty or, where that is mutually recognised as more
expedient, bilaterally.

8. Member States will make best efforts to deposit their instruments

of ratification, approval or acceptance of that plurilateral treaty or of

any bilateral treaty terminating bilateral investment treaties between

Member States no later than 6 December 2019.40?
Croatia has duly followed through on the first undertaking above, by virtue of informing this
Tribunal about the Declaration -15 January 2019. Having been so informed, the question for
the Tribunal is whether that Declaration has legal significance for its jurisdiction to proceed

in this case.

Croatia argues first that the Declaration itself is now part of the EU acquis, and therefore part
of the body of EU law that Article 11(2) of the BIT requires the Tribunal to examine, for
purposes of determining if any BIT provisions are incompatible with the acquis. Croatia relies

on the Eur-Lex Glossary ,*

which includes within its definition of the “EU acquis” the
“declarations and resolutions adopted by the [European] Union.”4 The Tribunal has
considerable doubt, however, that a Declaration issued in the name of particular EU Member
States (even collectively) can be equated with an act of the EU itself. Indeed, Croatia’s own
EU law expert (Professor Craig) does not agree that the Declaration is part of the EU acquis,
and concedes that this is a point of agreement between him and Addiko’s EU law expert,
Professor Jacobs.*°> In any event, the Declaration certainly could not be described as part of
the EU acquis “in force” at the time relevant to determination of this Tribunal’s jurisdiction,
which was 27 September 2017. Whatever EU law might say about the ex tunc application of
CJEU judgments such as Achmea, the Declaration — 15 January 2019 is not itself entitled to

ex tunc effect. It therefore could not form part of the acquis relevant, under Article 11(2) of

287.

the BIT, to the validity of Croatia’s offer to arbitrate at the time when Addiko accepted that

offer.

Second, Croatia suggests that the Declarations constitute an authoritative “interpretation of
Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU” by the various Contracting Parties to the TFEU,*”° or
alternatively stated, “an agreement among all the Contracting Parties to the TFEU on the
interpretation of Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU.”*°” However, the Declarations do not
actually purport to interpret the TFEU, but rather to address the perceived “legal
consequences of the judgment of the Court of Justice in Achmea.”*°* This is an important
distinction, because EU Member States do not have the power to interpret the TFEU; only the
CJEU has the power to do so within the EU legal order.*” As for Achmea, of course, its
judgment says what it says, and while the CJEU may in due course provide further guidance
on how to read that judgment, the EU Member States do not themselves have the authority to
“alter or extend the meaning of a judgment of the CJEU ... Interpretations of the Treaties by

the CJEU can only be altered by the CJEU itself or by amending the Treaties.”*!°

This latter point is important because, as the Eskosol tribunal noted, “in their statements
regarding legal issues on the first pages of the January 2019 Declaration, the signatories have
gone far beyond the actual holding in Achmea Judgment.”*!! Specifically, the Declaration —
15 January 2019 declares that Achmea stands for the proposition that “all investor-state
arbitration clauses contained in bilateral investment treaties ... are contrary to Union law,’4!?
but Achmea does not actually so state. Rather, as explained in Section V.C.1.b above, the
CJEU’s finding in Achmea was limited to intra-EU BITs with a “provision ... such as Article
8” of the Achmea Bir,‘ and its reasoning in Achmea makes clear that the concern was about

clauses that make EU law part of the applicable law of the treaty. In these circumstances,

while Achmea itself now forms part of the EU acquis, EU Member States cannot by simple

about the acquis than the CJEU itself was willing to embrace.

288. Croatia’s third argument is that the Declaration — 15 January 2019 qualifies as a “subsequent

agreement” between Austria and Croatia (inter alia) on interpretation of the BIT, for purposes
of VCLT Article 31(3)(a), which provides that “[t]here shall be taken into account, together
with the context ... any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation
of the treaty or the application of its provisions.”*!4 One of the difficulties with this argument
is that, as noted above, the Declaration by its terms addresses the perceived “legal
consequences” of a 2018 CJEU judgment, but does not purport to interpret the provisions of

this BIT or any other BIT for that matter.*!>

289. Moreover, the ILC’s 1966 Commentaries on the Draft VCLT Articles suggest that the purpose

of Article 31(3)(a) was to allow Contracting States to clarify later “[a] question of fact ... as
to whether an understanding reached during the negotiations [of a particular treaty]
concerning the meaning of a provision was or was not intended to constitute an agreed basis
for its interpretation.”“!° But the Declaration — 15 January 2019 does suggest that Austria and
Croatia (or any other pair of States whose BIT became an intra-EU BIT upon the second
State’s EU accession) had contemporaneously shared any “understanding” at the time of their
BIT negotiations that arbitration provisions would become inoperative upon EU accession.
To the contrary, it would be impossible to claim this was an originally shared understanding
between Austria and Croatia, because as late as February 2018, Austria itself was stating the

opposite with regarding to its own understanding of the Austria-Croatia BIT.*!” In these

underlying treaty).

circumstances, the Declaration at best can be seen as offering a new shared intention with
respect to the BIT’s arbitration clause, rather than confirming a previously shared
understanding.*!® Nor can the Declaration constitute stricto senso a new agreement between
the relevant States, given that it was signed by plenipotentiaries rather than being ratified in
accordance with the appropriate procedures for ratification of international agreements.
Finally, this new shared intention (at best) between Austria and Croatia clearly came into

being well after the critical date for jurisdiction in this case, which was in September of 2017.

290. A similar observation pertains to Croatia’s argument that the Declaration — 15 January 2019

reflects the binding results of a dialogue between it and Austria for purposes of the BIT’s own
Article 11(3), which provides that “[i]n case of uncertainties concerning the effects of [Article
11(2) of the BIT] the Contracting Parties will enter a dialogue.” For this argument, the
Tribunal need not decide whether the bilateral dialogue envisioned in the BIT could be
satisfied by a broader multi-State dialogue in which both Contracting Parties participated.
Notwithstanding Addiko’s objection to this concept, the Tribunal sees no reason in principle
that two State Parties to a BIT could not agree to such a route.*!? Rather, the real issue is a
temporal one, namely the attempted application of the results of such a dialogue to an
arbitration that already had been pending for five months at the time Austria and Croatia met,
and for sixteen months by the time of the Declaration - 15 January 2019. In the view of the
Tribunal, any dialogue between Austria and Croatia under Article 11(3) of the BIT would
have to be prospective in effect, rather than applied after-the-fact to pending cases initiated
under the BIT prior to the date of such dialogue. Giving a new dialogue effect in a pending

case, with the result of defeating jurisdiction that was not demonstrably already contrary to

418 See Eskosol, | 223, CLM-192 (concluding the same with regard to the ECT).

419 On several occasions, Austria suggested to Croatia that the States await EU-wide developments before progressing
with any further bilateral dialogue under the BIT. See, e.g., Record of consultations held with Austrian representatives
on 13 September 2011, 19 September 2011, p. 2. R-40 (Austria suggesting to Croatia in September 2011, with regard
to the issue of potential BIT termination, that “the parties involved should wait until the ie is resolved at the level
of the European Union”); Article 11(2)-(3) Meeting Minutes, p. 1 C-225 (noting that “Austria contends incompatibility
with the EU law should be determined by the CJEU” and “Austria considers that the CJEU will merely provide
instructions for the Member States on the incompatibility, that is how to align with the EU law”); Correspondence
between ministries of the Contracting Parties, 23 February 2018 to 30 January 2019, p. 2, R-41 (Austria’s
representative suggesting to Croatia's representatives in July 2018 that “[w]e also think it is indeed better to wait for
the results of the discussions in Brussels before we continue our bilateral dialogue”).

292.

the acquis “in force” as of the date the case commenced, would be contrary to Austria and
Croatia’s own pledge in Article 9(2)(a) of the BIT to “irrevocably consent[] in advance” to
arbitration. Moreover, as the Eskosol tribunal noted with respect to the same Declaration — 15
January 2019, “it would be inconsistent with general notions of acquired rights under
international law to permit States effectively to non-suit an investor part-way through a
pending case, simply by issuing a joint document purporting to interpret long-standing treaty
text so as to undermine the tribunal’s jurisdiction to proceed.”4”° As discussed further below,
the fact that the signatories to the Declaration did not even evince a belief that their respective
intra-EU BITs had been implicitly terminated from the date of accession, but rather announced
their intent to explore future steps leading to eventual termination,*”! further confirms that the
Declaration cannot be given legal force to invalidate BIT arbitration clauses in cases already

then underway.

f. Additional Arguments of the Commission and Croatia

Finally, the Tribunal addresses several additional arguments the Commission presented in its

non-disputing party submission, some (but not all) of which Croatia also raised in its filings.

First, both the Commission and Croatia rely on Declaration 17 annexed to the Final Act of the
Intergovernmental Conference adopting the Treaty of Lisbon, for the proposition that EU law
takes primacy over intra-EU treaty commitments of Member States, and not just over the
national laws of Member States.*”? Addiko disagrees with this proposition, arguing that the
primacy of EU law applies only vis-a-vis Member State laws, and not vis-a-vis treaty
commitments.’ In the Tribunal’s view, there is no need in this case to resolve the debate,
given the express provision in Article 11(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT that “[t]he Contracting
Parties are not bound by the present Agreement insofar as it is incompatible with the legal
acquis of the European Union (EU) in force at any given time.” This provision acts as lex

specialis, and effectively provides a conflicts rule for this case insofar as any incompatibility

bilaterally.”).

110

actually were to exist, so there is no need to resort to Declaration 17 as a source of a general
conflicts rule arguably elevating EU law over other Member State commitments. The fact
remains, however, that the Tribunal has found no incompatibility with the acquis to exist in
relation to arbitration under the BIT’s Article 9(2), for the reasons stated in Section V.C.1.c

above, so neither conflicts rule becomes operational in the circumstances of this case.

293. Second, the Commission invokes Article 30(3) of the VCLT,** which Croatia also invokes

as an alternative to its primary argument about Article 11(2) of the BIT.*?° VCLT Article 30
is entitled “Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter,” and its first
subparagraph states that “the rights and obligations of State parties to successive treaties
relating to the same subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following
paragraphs.”*?° Subparagraph (3) then provides that “[w]hen all the parties to the earlier treaty
are parties also to the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are
compatible with those of the later treaty.”4?” As the Tribunal already has noted, however,
VCLT Article 30 does not apply, given that Article 11(2) of the BIT provides its own rule
regarding the relationship between the BIT and the EU acquis, which operates as lex specialis.
Moreover, even as an “alternative” argument (as Croatia offers it), Article 30(3) of the VCLT
would not dictate the result Croatia seeks, for two reasons. First, the Tribunal has found that
Article 9(2) of the BIT is not incompatible with the acquis, so the conflicts rule represented
by VCLT Article 30(3) would not apply even if (arguendo) the Tribunal were to find the
predicate step of “same subject matter” satisfied on the facts of this case.*?* The Tribunal

however does not consider the “subject matter” test to be satisfied either, because (as

#25 Resp. Mem. {ff 24, 129.

426 Article 30(1) of the VCLT (emphasis added).

#27 Article 30(3) of the VCLT.

#8 For avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal agrees with Eskosol that Article 30(3) of the VCLT imposes two separate
tests (“same subject matter” and “incompatibility”) rather than a single test, as Croatia and the Commission both
contend. See Eskosol {¥{ 135-139, CLM-192 (explaining that accepting the Commission’s position would “effectively
require rewriting the text” rather than adhering “to the natural and ordinary meaning of the terms,” and would also
ignore “that the comparators in Articles 30(1) and 30(3) are different: Article 30(1) examines the relationship between
treaties as a whole (whether they ‘relat[e] to the same subject matter’), while Article 30(3) examines the relationship
between particular provisions within such related treaties (whether they are ‘compatible’)).

explained more fulsomely by the Eskosol tribunal), the BIT and the EU Treaties cannot be
considered — using the analysis adopted by the ILC to explain the relevant terms — as elements

of a related “treaty regime[]” involving ““‘clusters’ of treaties that are linked institutionally

and that States parties envisage as part of the same concerted effort.”*??

Third, the Commission argues that the BIT already was implicitly terminated under Article
59 of the VCLT, and indeed that such implicit termination occurred from the moment of
Croatia’s accession to the EU.**° Croatia does not advance this argument, and the Tribunal

considers it frankly to be a non-starter.

Article 59 of the VCLT, entitled “Termination of suspension of the operation of a treaty
implied by conclusion of a later treaty,” provides in relevant part that “[a] treaty shall be
considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a later treaty relating to the same
subject-matter and (a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the
parties intended that the matter should be governed by that treaty; or (b) [t]he provisions of
the later treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are
not capable of being applied at the same time.”**! But as a threshold matter, as discussed
above, the Tribunal does not consider the BIT and the EU Treaties to involve the “same
subject matter” for purposes of international law, which is a preliminary requirement under
VCLT Article 59(1) for implicit termination of an earlier treaty by virtue of a later treaty. Nor
has the Tribunal found that Article 9(2) of the BIT and the TFEU are “so far incompatible”
that they “are not capable of being applied at the same time,” within the meaning of Article

59(1)(b) of the VCLT.

Finally, with respect to Article 59(1)(a), there is no evidence that the two State Parties to the
BIT both intended upon accession that the BIT itself, or even just its arbitration provisions,
had been superseded by the TFEU, with the result that the BIT (or those provisions) might be
implicitly terminated by mutual intent. The Tribunal recalls in this regard that while Croatia

in 2011 solicited Austria’s views on whether the two States should take affirmative action to

433

terminate the BIT upon accession, Austria declined to pursue any such bilateral action in
advance of a broader EU-wide determination. Nothing in the exchange suggested that either
State believed termination could occur implicitly upon accession, without the need for some
additional affirmative steps. The notion of implicit termination by mutual intent is also
specifically belied by the text of the Declaration — 15 January 2019, which contains two
undertakings framed in the future tense: number 5, by which the signatories state that they
“will terminate” all bilateral investment treaties concluded between them, and number 8, by
which they pledge they “will make best efforts” to complete this process by 6 December
2019.4 The use of the future tense clearly indicates that the signatories did not believe their
intra-EU BITs already had been terminated, on grounds of invalidity of the underlying
consent or otherwise. Finally, even the recent EU agreement on termination of intra-EU BITs,
which certain Member States (including Croatia) signed on 5 May 2020 — but Austria notably
did not — provides for termination by virtue of (and effective upon) that new treaty’s entry
into force.*7? The whole raison d’étre of the new treaty is to effect a change in the status of
the covered intra-EU BITs, which would not be necessary of such BITs already had been

implicitly terminated under VCLT Article 59.

g. Conclusion on Alleged Incompatibility with Articles 267 and 344 TFEU

For these myriad reasons, the Tribunal rejects Croatia’s jurisdictional objection on the basis
that Article 9(2) of the Austria-Croatia BIT, “irrevocably consenting in advance” to arbitration
of investor claims under the BIT’s substantive provisions, is incompatible with Articles 267
and 344 of the TFEU. The Tribunal turns below to Croatia’s separate argument that various
provisions of the BIT are incompatible with anti-discrimination principles reflected in the EU

acquis.

(2) Alleged Incompatibility with EU Anti-Discrimination Principles

Independent of Croatia’s arguments about Articles 267 and 344 of the TFEU, it contends that
the BIT is incompatible with other aspects of the acquis that forbid Member States from
discriminating between nationals of other EU Member States, such as by providing some EU
investors with more beneficial treatment by virtue of the protections in intra-EU BITs than
others would have (by virtual of their home States not being party to equivalent BITs). Croatia
invokes Articles 18, 49 and 63 of the TFEU as the source of such antidiscrimination
principles, as well as the non-discrimination provisions of the GATs. It contends that the
Austria-Croatia BIT is incompatible with these principles because it provides both substantive
and procedural advantages to Austrian and Croatian nationals, in the form of the substantive
protections enshrined in the BIT as well as a right of access to investor-State arbitration to

pursue alleged violations of those protections. The Tribunal turns to these arguments below.

a. Articles 18, 49 and 63 of the TFEU

The first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU provides as follows:

Within the scope of application of the Treaties, and without

prejudice to any special provisions contained therein, any

discrimination on grounds of nationality shall be prohibited.
Article 49 of the TFEU prohibits Member States from imposing any “restrictions on the
freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member
State,” and Article 63 of the TFEU prohibits “all restrictions on the movement of capital

between Member States and between Member States and third countries.”

Croatia invokes these TFEU provisions for the proposition that the BIT’s procedural and
substantive provisions were incompatible, immediately upon Croatia’s accession to the
EU, with core provision of the EU acquis which prevent any Member State from providing
more favorable treatment to nationals of another Member State than they would to all other

EU nationals.*** Accordingly, Croatia argues, Article 11(2) of the BIT provides that the

+4 Resp. Mem. 95, 101-102.

114

301.

302.

Contracting Parties are not bound by these provisions of the BIT because of their

incompatibility with the acquis.

The Tribunal first recalls that Article 11(2) refers to the acquis “in force at any given time.”
But neither at the time of Addiko’s commencement of this arbitration, nor even as of today,
has the CJEU interpreted the TFEU as barring the procedural or substantive provisions of
intra-EU BITs on discrimination grounds. The only competent EU authority that has
addressed the issue of discrimination (at least vis-a-vis intra-EU arbitration) was Advocate
General Wathelet in his Opinion in Achmea, which expressly rejected any putative
incompatibility on those grounds.**> The CJEU then declined to address the matter,
effectively leaving Advocate General Wathelet’s Opinion as the only standing
interpretation on the issue in the EU acquis. As the Tribunal noted in Section V.B above,
the Parties and their respective EU law experts agreed in this case that the acquis includes
opinions rendered to the CJEU by its Advocates General, to the extent not subsequently
rejected by the CJEU or otherwise incompatible with primary elements of the acquis such
as the EU Treaties.**° In these circumstances, the Tribunal must accept that Advocate
General Wathelet’s Opinion on the discrimination issue still stands as part of the acquis,
unless the Tribunal were prepared to declare that Opinion fundamentally wrong as a matter
of EU law (i.e., as incorrectly interpreting the TFEU). But this would be fundamentally
inconsistent with Croatia’s argument that the Tribunal should not second-guess the

prevailing interpretations of the acquis that were provided by the competent EU bodies.

Moreover, even if the Tribunal arguendo were prepared to disregard Advocate General
Wathelet’s Opinion as an existing part of the acquis with respect to the discrimination
issue, the result would be no different. First, as the UniCredit tribunal explained in its 2020
Decision, a procedural provision giving investors access to arbitration does not guarantee
any investor a substantive decision in its favor, but simply provides a particular forum for

claims to be considered: “[j]ust as the national laws of the EU Member States also provide

303.

for different common courts based on various criteria (e.g., the place of domicile of the
respondent) without that being incompatible with the EU acquis, the BIT provides for
ICSID arbitration,” but it is not clear why this difference in procedural rights necessarily
constitutes discrimination per se.*°” The UniCredit tribunal similarly concluded that the
fact that “the catalogue of rights in the BIT is not identical to that in the TFEU or more
broadly in the EU acquis” does not make them necessarily incompatible, where both are
“protection mechanisms” for investment and “a protection mechanism enshrined in a set
of particular rights is not the goal itself but a tool to ensure the desirable result.”** The
Tribunal understands this reasoning to suggest that discrimination does not necessarily

arise simply from phrasing in different ways protections against improper treatment.

In this connection, the Tribunal recalls the Parties’ agreement that “incompatibility” under
Article 11(2) should be understood as referring to a situation in which compliance with one
obligation places a State into non-compliance with the other obligation.**? As the Tribunal
noted in Section V.B, this definition of incompatibility necessarily requires a finding that
the obligations of the BIT and the TFEU cannot be cumulatively applied. As a matter of
international law, the Tribunal does not consider that to be the case for the BIT’s
provisions, because nothing in the BIT requires Austria or Croatia to provide differential
(i.e., more favorable) treatment to the other’s investors than they would to any other EU
national. The BIT certainly prohibits its Contracting Parties from providing less favorable
treatment than it provides other investors, but that norm itself establishes a proposition of
non-discrimination. So long as Austria and Croatia provide other EU nationals with the
same treatment as they provide each other’s investors, they would not run afoul either of
the BIT’s anti-discrimination provisions or those applicable under the TFEU. In that sense,
the two sets of legal obligations (the BIT and the EU acquis) work towards the same end,
not disparate ends, and can be cumulatively applied without any inherent inconsistency.
This is true not only of the BIT’s substantive provisions, but also of its provision for access

to international arbitration, since (as explained above in this Decision), nothing in the EU

305.

acquis (as interpreted by the CJEU in Achmea) actually prevents Member States from
agreeing to treaty arbitration so long as the proceedings are governed only by the terms of

the treaty and general international law, and not by EU law as such.

b. The GATS

Croatia also contends that the BIT conflicts with the anti-discrimination principles of
Article II(1) of the GATS, which imposes upon WTO Member States an obligation
requiring “that investment incentives or restrictions be applied equally to all foreign
sources of inward service-industry related investments.” Because the GATS (in Croatia’s
view) form part of the EU acquis, this conflict between the BIT and the GATS results in

the BIT’s not being binding on either it or Austria, by virtue of Article 11(2) of the BIT.*°

The Tribunal has some doubt whether the GATS actually constitutes part of the EU acquis,
for the reasons presented by Addiko in this case.*4! However, even assuming arguendo
that it does, the same point applies as under Croatia’s other discrimination arguments,
namely that there is no inherent incompatibility so long as the Contracting Parties to the
BIT do not provide Jess favorable “investment incentives or restrictions” to other GATS
members than they do to each other. Otherwise, of course — if the mere existence of a BIT
between two States constituted a violation of GATS principles of non-discrimination — then
every WTO Member State that was a party to any BIT would equally be in violation of its
GATS obligations.” Indeed, Croatia acknowledged at the Hearing that the necessary
implication of its position was that “no BIT would be valid under this argument” unless
excepted under the procedure for exemptions provided for by the GATS, which only a few

GATS members have sought to do.*? The fact that such a charge has never been leveled

307.

against any State that has not expressly exempted its BITs underscores the novelty (and in

the Tribunal’s view, the fallacy) of Croatia’s argument in that respect.

MONETARY GOLD PRINCIPLE

Finally, Croatia argues that as a matter of international law, this case cannot proceed
because any finding that the Tribunal has jurisdiction would necessarily amount to a
finding that Austria (and not just Croatia) has violated its obligation under the EU Treaties
not to act in a manner incompatible with the EU acquis, and the Tribunal cannot sit in
judgment of Austria without its participation in a case, pursuant to the principle identified

by the ICJ in the Monetary Gold case.*“4

The Tribunal rejects this argument as ill-founded. The Monetary Gold principle, such as it
is, is not part of the EU acquis, and therefore does not come into play under the BIT by
virtue of Article 11(2)’s provisions on the results of any incompatibility between the BIT
and the acquis. In any event, the concerns that the ICJ stated in Monetary Gold relate to a
situation in which the very subject-matter of the dispute involves a determination of a third
State’s international legal responsibility, such as where that determination is a necessary
prerequisite for decision on the claimant’s claims.**> Those concerns do not apply in this
context, because nothing the Tribunal might decide, by virtue of allowing Addiko to
proceed with its claims against Croatia, would adjudicate the legality of any acts by
Austria, whether under EU law, the BIT, or any other set of obligations. To be clear, this
Tribunal will not be entertaining any claims about any acts of Austria. Moreover, nothing
in this Decision would preclude Austria from presenting arguments in future to a different
arbitral tribunal, or to the CJEU, about the validity of the BIT or the enforceability of its
consent to arbitral jurisdiction under the BIT. Austria’s procedural and substantive rights
thus will remain entirely unaffected by this Decision and by whatever ruling the Tribunal

eventually renders on other issues as between Addiko and Croatia.““° Moreover, even to

has not been implicitly terminated, that decision takes no stand beyond the position that
Austria apparently itself recently has taken, by declining to sign on (with other EU Member

States) to the treaty for termination of various intra-EU BITs.*”

VI. DECISION

308. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal denies Croatia’s jurisdictional objection related
to the alleged incompatibility of the Austria-Croatia BIT with the EU acquis, which it
previously accelerated for decision in advance of a plenary hearing on all other
jurisdictional and merits issues in this case. Accordingly, the case therefore moves forward
to consideration of the remaining issues, on the procedural schedule currently in place for

the remaining stages of this arbitration.

unimpaired by this decision.”).
