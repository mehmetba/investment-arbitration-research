PARTIES AND INVESTMENTS

Claimants in this arbitration are Mr. Sergei Paushok, CJSC Golden East Company
("Golden East"), and CJSC Vostokneftegaz Company ('Vostokneftegaz") (collectively
"Claimants").

Mr. Sergei Paushok is a national of the Russian Federation.

Golden East is a closed joint stock company constituted in accordance with the laws of
the Russian Federation with a registered office in that State.

Vostokneftegaz is a closed joint stock company constituted in accordance with the laws
of the Russian Federation with a registered office in that State.

Claimant Paushok is the sole shareholder of both Golden-East and Vostokneftegaz. The
structure of Claimant Paushok's shareholdings, which include Russian and Mongolian
companies other than Golden-East and Vostokneftegaz, is set out in the chart attached
hereto as Annex 1.

As appears from Annex 1, Claimants, directly or indirectly, own 100% of the outstanding
shares of KOO Golden East-Mongolia ("GEM"), a gold mining company, KOO Bumbat
("Bumbat"), also a gold mining company, and KOO Vostokneftegaz ("VNGM"), an oil
and gas company. GEM, Bumbat and VNGM are constituted pursuant to the laws of
Mongolia and are operating in that country.

In these proceedings, Claimants are represented by Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, L.L-P.
Respondent is the Republic of Mongolia ("Mongolia" or "Respondent').

In these proceedings, Respondent is represented by Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy
L.L-P. and the Ministry of Justice and Home Affairs of Mongolia.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On November 30, 2007, Claimants issued a Notice of Arbitration (the "Notice of
Arbitration" or the "C. NA") against the Government of Mongolia, in accordance with
Article 3 of the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (the "UNCITRAL Rules"). A table outlining all the proceedings filed in this
arbitration as well as their respective subject matter is attached as Annex 2 (save the
proceedings related to the Request for Interim Measures addressed hereinbelow).

In their Notice of Arbitration, Claimants alleged that Respondent breached its
obligations under the Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments
between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of Mongolia (the
"Treaty" or the "BIT") by, among others, enacting and enforcing the law "On Imposition of
Price Increase (Windfall) Taxes on Some Commodities" (the "WPT Law") and the law "On
Minerals" (the "2006 Minerals Law").

Article 6 of the Treaty allows the investor of a Contracting Party to initiate arbitration
against the other Contracting Party pursuant to the UNCITRAL Rules:

"Disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor
of the other Contracting Party, arising in connection with
realization of investments, including disputes concerning the
amount, terms or method of payment of the compensation, shall,
whenever possible, be settled through negotiations.

If a dispute cannot be settled in such manner within six months
from the moment of its occurrence, it may be referred to:

(a) A competent court or arbitral tribunal of the Contracting
Party in which territory the investments were made;

(b) The Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce;

(c)  anad hoc arbitral tribunal in accordance with the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law (UNCITRAL)."

In their Notice of Arbitration, Claimants appointed Dr. Horacio A. Grigera Na6én as
arbitrator.

On February 18, 2008, Respondent appointed Professor Brigitte Stern as arbitrator.

On March 12, 2008, Arbitrators Stern and Grigera Naon, further to consultation with
Counsel to the Parties, appointed the Honorable Marc Lalonde as President of the
Tribunal.

Subsequently, the Tribunal, further to consultation with the Parties, appointed Me Lev
Alexeev as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On March 14, 2008, Claimants submitted to the Tribunal a Request for Interim Measures
including a Temporary Restraining Order Prior to March 24, 2008 (the "RIM"), accompanied
by the first witness statement of Claimant Paushok ('Paushok-I") pursuant to Articles 15
and 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules. A complete list of all the witness statements filed in
support of the subsequent proceedings is attached as Annex 3.

In their RIM, Claimants requested an order from the Tribunal directing Respondent
during the pendency of the arbitral proceedings:

(1) To suspend enforcement of the WPT Law, the 2006 Minerals Law, and
penalties for alleged late tax payments against GEM;

19.

20.

21.

-3-

(2) To suspend any criminal action against Claimants or their investments
and guarantee free movement in and out of Mongolia for GEM's
representatives, managers and employees;

(3) | To suspend any other conduct that aggravates the dispute, including, but
not limited to, disparagement of Claimants or their investment in the
media or unjustified refusal of permission to continue to mine gold in the
same way and at the same levels as were approved in 2006 and 2007.

Claimants also requested the issuance of a temporary restraining order directing
Respondent to refrain from the activities listed in sub-paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) above
pending the Tribunal's decision on interim measures.

The request for the issuance of a temporary restraining order was based on the alleged
intention of Respondent to prosecute the enforced collection of taxes and fees disputed
in this arbitration on March 24, 2008.

Subsequent to the RIM, various letters and telephone communications were exchanged
between the Parties and the members of the Tribunal, including (i) a letter from Counsel
for Respondent dated March 22, 2008 and opposing the issuance of a temporary
restraining order and (ii) a telephone conference call between Counsel for the Parties
and the President of the Tribunal on March 22, 2008.

On March 23, 2008, the Tribunal issued the following temporary restraining order (the
"TRO'):

"1- Taking into account the undertaking already given,
Respondent shall refrain from seizing or obtaining a lien on
the assets of Claimants and shall allow Claimants to
maintain their ordinary business operations;

2- Claimants shall immediately sign an undertaking not to
move assets out of Mongolia nor to take any action which
would alter in any way the ownership and/or financial
interests of the Claimants with respect to their assets in
Mongolia, without prior notice to and agreement of
Respondent;

3- Claimants shall, within seven days, provide Respondent
with a complete list of their assets in Mongolia;

4- The issue raised by Respondent of the provision of security
by Claimants shall be dealt with at the time of the
consideration of the Request for Interim Measures;

5- The briefing schedule for any issue related to Claimants!
interim measures application shall be decided in a separate

procedural order by the Tribunal, after consultation with the
Parties.

Pending its decision on interim measures, the Tribunal urges the
Parties to refrain from any action which could lead to further
injury and aggravation of the dispute between the Parties."

On April 18, 2008, an organizational meeting was held at the offices of Stikeman Elliott
L.L-P. located at 1155, René-Lévesque Blvd West, 40 floor, Montreal, Québec, Canada.
The purpose of this meeting was to establish the terms of reference and to discuss
various procedural and logistical issues.

In addition to the members of the Tribunal and the Secretary thereof, the following
Counsel attended that meeting:

Mr. George M. von Mehren and Mr. Stephen P. Anway (Counsel
for Claimants), and

Mr. Michael D. Nolan and Mr. Edward G. Baldwin (Counsel for
Respondent)

It was decided at the meeting that this arbitration will be split in two phases, the first
phase dealing with the issues of Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability (Phase 1") and,
should the need be, the second phase dealing with the issues of Damages ("Phase 2").
This Award on Jurisdiction and Liability is rendered further to the completion of
Phase 1.

Further to the meeting, the contents of which, as per Counsel for the Parties' request and
agreement, were not transcribed, the Secretary of the Tribunal communicated to Counsel
for the Parties detailed minutes of the said meeting on April 29, 2008.

On April 30, 2008, Respondent submitted its Opposition to Claimants' March 14, 2008
Request for Interim Measures (the "Opposition to the RIM").

On the basis of the minutes of the meeting referred to in paragraph 26, Counsel for the
Parties prepared a draft Procedural Order no. 1 and submitted same for consideration to
the Tribunal on May 14, 2008.

On May 30, 2008, Claimants submitted their Reply on Interim Measures, amending their
Request for Interim Measures and limiting the relief sought to the extension of the
temporary restraining order in an Order on Interim Measures.

On June 3, 2008, the President of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 1, which dealt
with all the procedural and logistical issues, save the timetable of submissions and
hearing for Phase 1 (Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability). Under that Order, The
Hague was selected as the seat of the arbitration. The applicable law is public
international law and the law of Mongolia as far as it is relevant

On June 4, 2008, the Tribunal, having received various observations from the Parties,
issued Procedural Order no. 2, which mainly dealt with the timetable for Phase 1
(Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability).

On June 27, 2008, Claimants submitted their Statement of Claim (the "C. SC").
On June 30, 2008, Respondent submitted its Rejoinder to the Request for Interim Measures.

On July 2, 2008, a conference call was held between Counsel for the Parties and the
President of the Tribunal in order to address various organizational and procedural
issues in relation to the forthcoming hearing on interim measures.

From the date of filing of the RIM until the date of the hearing on interim measures,
Counsel for the Parties addressed numerous letters to the members of the Tribunal with
respect to the said request as well as in relation to issues peripheral thereto.

On July 8, 2008, a full day hearing on interim measures was held at the offices of
Stikeman Elliott L.L.P. located at 1155, René-Lévesque Blvd West, 40* floor, Montreal,
Québec, Canada (the "Interim Hearing").

In addition to the members of the Tribunal, the Secretary of the Tribunal and the Court
Reporter, this Interim Hearing was attended by:

On behalf of Claimants:

Mr. George M. von Mehren (Counsel for Claimants)

Mr. Stephen P. Anway (Counsel for Claimants)

Mr. Rostislav Peka¥ (Counsel for Claimants)

Ms. Irina Golovanova (Counsel for Claimants)

Mr. Trevor Covey (Counsel for Claimants)

Verbatim transcripts of the Interim Hearing were produced in English and were
concurrently available for viewing throughout the Interim Hearing. Copies of the
transcripts were distributed to the Tribunal and the Parties a few days after the Interim
Hearing.

Having consulted with Counsel for the Parties, the Tribunal decided that post-hearing
submissions were not required and took the RIM under advisement.

On August 23, 2008, Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to supplement their
Statement of Claim in order to add certain allegation related to Respondent's acts in
relation to Bumbat and the conversion of exploration licenses into mining licenses
(respectively the "New Facts" and the "Request to Supplement").

The Tribunal deliberated on various occasions on the Request for Interim Measures.

On September 2, 2008, the Tribunal issued its Order on Interim Measures (the "OIM"),
granting Claimants' request in part and deciding as follows:

"Claimants' application for interim measures of protection under
Article 26 of the UNCITRAL Rules is granted in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions below:

1. Payment to Respondent of the Windfall Profit tax owing by
GEM (including interest and penalties) is suspended until
the Tribunal has ruled on the merits of Claimants' Request
for relief.

2. Taking note of the undertaking previously made by
Respondent on March19, 2008 and confirmed at the
Hearing, Respondent shall refrain from seizing or obtaining
a lien on the assets of GEM and other assets of Claimants in
connection with the WPT owing to Respondent or from
directly or indirectly taking any other action leading to the
same or similar effect, except in accordance with the
Tribunal's Orders, and shall allow GEM and Claimants to
maintain their ordinary business operations in Mongolia.

3. Following their previous undertaking in that regard on
March 26, 2008, Claimants shall not move assets out of
Mongolia, nor take any action which would alter in any way
the ownership and/or financial interests of Claimants with
respect to their assets in Mongolia, without prior notice to
and agreement of Respondent. Sale and pledges of gold are
authorized provided the funds thus obtained are used for the
ordinary business operations of GEM. Under no
circumstances should such funds be used for other purposes;
in particular, no transfer of funds or assets of any kind
should be made outside of Mongolia (except for deposit into

-7-

the escrow account under the conditions described below) or
to any of the Claimants or any person, corporation or
business related to them, without Respondent's agreement.

Claimants shall provide gradually increasing security as
described below. The Tribunal may increase or decrease the
security for good cause shown premised on the evolution of
GEM's business. Claimants shall submit for approval by the
Tribunal, within twenty days of the present Order, a detailed
proposal, which will have been discussed with Respondent,
concerning the implementation of one of the following
measures of protection which they will have selected:

(a) An escrow account in an internationally recognized
financial or other institution outside Mongolia and
Russia and acceptable to the Tribunal;

(b) The provision of a bank guarantee to the same
effect and under the same conditions from an
internationally recognized financial or other institution
outside Mongolia and Russia and acceptable to the
Tribunal.

If Respondent is not satisfied with the arrangement proposed
by Claimants, the Tribunal will issue the appropriate order
upon request by one of the Parties.

The cost of the escrow account shall be borne equally by
Claimants and Respondent but can be made part of the claim
for compensation by each Party.

Claimants shall deposit in the escrow account (if such is the
option retained), on the first working day of each month
following the establishment of that account, the sum of
US$ 2 million, until a final award is rendered in the present
case or until the sum in the escrow account has reached 50%
of the total amount of the accrued WPT claimed by
Respondent, including interest and penalties, whichever
comes first. The monies deposited in the escrow account may
be invested in financial instruments of high liquidity. The
decision regarding the scope of the security is adopted by
majority, Dr. Horacio A. Grigera Naon being of the view that
tax penalties should be excluded from the determination or
calculation of the security.

Claimants may use the income resulting from the sale of
gold by GEM for deposit into the escrow account, provided
that, in no circumstance, such transfer would result in a

-8-

reduction of shareholders' equity in GEM below the sum of
MNT 31,578,323,602.35 mentioned at line 2.3.20 of the
Balance Sheet of the Financial Statements of December 31,
2007 (after inclusion in the liabilities of the company the
amount of WPT payable at that time - but not actually paid -
of MNT 35,241,117,584.00 mentioned at line 2.1.1.12. Each
such transfer shall be preceded by an affidavit signed by
Director S.V. Paushok and the Chief Accountant of GEM
confirming that fact and sent to Respondent and the
Tribunal.

8. If, instead of the escrow account, the bank guarantee option
is retained, arrangements to the same effect shall be put into
place.

9. Claimants shall, every six months, provide Respondent with
a complete list of their assets in Mongolia.

10. The scope of this Order does not extend beyond the subject-
matter of this dispute and does not prevent Mongolia, after
due consideration in good-faith of the Tribunal's direction
under paragraph 11 below, from exercising its rights against
GEM or Claimants in matters unrelated to this dispute,
including taxes owing in other respect than the Windfall
Profit Tax.

11. The Parties shall refrain, until a final award is rendered in
this case, from any action which could lead to further injury
and aggravation of the dispute between the Parties.

12. The Tribunal reserves for later consideration its decision on
costs arising from these proceedings.

13. The Temporary Restraining Order is terminated.

14. The Tribunal reserves the right to amend or revoke the
present Order at any time during the proceedings, upon
request by one of the Parties demonstrating the need for
such action. In particular, failure by Claimants to timely
provide or maintain the required security could lead to the
immediate revocation of the present Order."

[references omitted]

44. As described more fully herein below, Claimants failed to provide one of the forms of
security provided for in the OIM and, therefore, the latter expired on December 2, 2008.

On September 24, 2008, the Tribunal, having received various observations from the
Parties, issued Procedural Order no. 3, whereby the Tribunal ordered the production of
certain documents by Respondent, granted Claimants' Request to Supplement and
amended the procedural timetable accordingly.

On September 26, 2008, Respondent filed its Defense, Objections to Jurisdiction,
Counterclaim (the "R. Defense").

From September 22 until October 16, 2008, the Parties exchanged among themselves and
with the Tribunal a voluminous correspondence with respect to the implementation of
the OIM, Claimants proposing alternative forms of security and Respondent seeking
security for costs and requesting that the OIM be varied in several respects on the basis
of alleged violations of the TRO by Claimants (the "OIM-related Requests").

On November 5, 2008, the Tribunal adjudicated the OIM-related Requests and issued
Procedural Order no. 4, whereby it reaffirmed the OIM, invited the Parties, in light of
Claimants' inability to provide one of the forms of security set out in the OIM, to come to
a negotiated solution with respect to the implementation thereof by November 21, 2008
and advised the Parties that failure to provide one of the forms of security set out in the
OIM or to come to an alternative agreement would lead to the automatic termination of
the OIM on December 2, 2008.

On November 17, 2008, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no.5, ordering the
production of certain documents by Respondent, including documents the production of
which had already been ordered by Procedural Order no. 3.

On November 28, 2008, Claimants filed their Reply, Answer on Jurisdiction, Defense to
Counterclaim, Objections to Jurisdiction over the Counterclaims and Statement of Claim with
respect to the New Facts (the '"C. Reply").

On December 19, 2008, the Tribunal held a conference call with the Parties with respect
to the issues related to the alleged failure by Claimants to timely disclose certain
documents and the organization of the Hearing on Jurisdiction/Admissibility and
Liability. On the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 6, which dealt with
the issues addressed during the conference call, modified the timetable with respect to
the remaining steps of Phase 1 and took notice of the fact that the Parties agreed holding
the Hearing on Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability in Frankfurt, Germany.

On February 20, 2009, Respondent filed its Rejoinder, Reply on Jurisdiction, Reply on
Counterclaim, Answer on Jurisdiction over Counterclaims and Defense with respect to the New
Facts (the "R. Rejoinder").

By a letter dated March 3, 2009, Claimants advised the Tribunal that they would not file
their Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction over Counterclaims, the issue having been fully
briefed, and that, by the same token, the need for Respondent's Rejoinder on Objections to
Jurisdiction over Counterclaims was no longer required. Claimants also sought that the
procedural timetable be varied in such a way as Claimants' Reply regarding New Facts and
Respondent's Rejoinder regarding New Facts be joined to their respective submissions on

Damages (Phase 2), if any, rather than being submitted as provided for in Procedural
Order no.3. On March 8, 2009, Respondent opposed Claimants' Request for the
modification of the timetable with respect to the proceedings related to the New Facts.

On March 13, 2009, Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and on Counterclaim,
without including however their Reply on the New Facts as directed by Procedural
Order no. 3 (the "C. Rejoinder").

On March 16, 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 7, whereby it took notice
that no further submissions on the issue of jurisdiction over counterclaims would be
filed, set the dates by which the submissions on the New Facts as well as on the events
of December 2, 2008 had to be filed and allowed Claimants to adduce a brief expert
rebuttal evidence by way of direct examination of Professor Temuulen Bataa at the
Hearing on Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability.

On the same day, the Tribunal communicated with the Parties (i) requesting the Parties
to provide, by April 1s, 2009, a joint detailed hearing scenario with respect to the
allocation of time at the Hearing, the order and the length of the oral submissions, the
number and the identity of the witnesses, the sequence and the length of the
examinations and (ii) advising the Parties that it would rule on any on the above issues
should the Parties be unable to come to an agreement.

On March 27, 2009, Claimants filed their Reply on the New Facts and Statement of Claim
with respect to December 2, 2008 events (the "C. Reply New Facts").

On April 6, 2009, the Parties having been unable to agree on all the issues addressed in
the Tribunal's communication of March 16, 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
no. 8, which dealt with the issues related to the holding of the Hearing on
Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability.

On April 14, 2009, a conference call was held among Counsel for the Parties and the
Chairman to discuss Respondent's request of April 9, 2009 for some of its witnesses to
appear by videoconference at the Hearing on Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability.

On April 15, 2009, Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the New Facts and Defence with respect
to December 2, 2008 events (the "R. Rejoinder New Facts"), which submission completed
Phase 1 pre-hearing briefing.

On April 21, 2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 9, granting in part, in light
of Claimants' consent, Respondent's request to have some of its witnesses to appear by
videoconference at the Hearing on Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and Liability.

From April 23 to April 30, 2008, a seven-day Hearing on Jurisdiction/ Admissibility and
Liability took place at the offices of Milbank Tweed Hadley & McCloy L.L-P. located at
15, Taunusanlage, Frankfurt, Germany (the "Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability" or
the "Hearing").

On May 12, 2009, the Tribunal, through its Secretary, communicated with the Parties in
order to indicate some of the matters that it wished to be covered in the Parties' Post
Hearing Briefs.

On May 19, 2009, the Tribunal, through its Secretary, provided the Parties with various
versions of translation of section 3.1 of the BIT (which it had previously received from
the independent interpreters hired by the Parties for the Hearing) and requested that the
Parties attempt to agree on a common translation, failing which the Tribunal was going
to consider the versions already at its disposal.

On June 1, 2009, Counsel for Claimants informed the Tribunal that the Parties were
unable to agree on a common translation of section 3.1 of the BIT and asked the Tribunal
to consider the translations already at its disposal.

On June 12, 2009, the Parties submitted their Post-Hearing Briefs on Jurisdiction and
Liability (individually the "C. PHB" and the "R. PHB").

On September 15, 2010, the Tribunal requested the Parties to submit, by October 30,
2009, briefs on the issue of the jurisdiction ratione temporis of the Tribunal to deal with
the issue of the request of GEM in 2001 for a stability agreement concerning taxation and
the substantive law applicable to that issue. This request of the Tribunal was prompted
by the fact that neither Party had addressed these issues in its previous submissions.

On October 12, 2009, Counsel for Claimants requested the Tribunal to extend the date set
for the filing of the foregoing briefs by one month to November 30, 2009.

On October 14, 2009, Counsel for Respondent informed the Tribunal that they did not
object to Claimants' request for extension.

On the same day, the Tribunal informed the Parties that Claimants' request for extension
was granted and directed the Parties to file their briefs by November 30, 2009.

On November 30, 2009, Claimants filed their Submission on Jurisdiction and Applicable Law
Regarding the Negotiations of a Stability Agreement in 2001 (the "C. SPHB").

On the same day, Respondent filed its Submission Concerning the Questions Put by
Chairman Lalonde in his Letter of September 15, 2009 (the "R. SPHB").

On December 1, 2009, Counsel for Respondent sent to the Tribunal a letter in which they
commented on some of the statements made in C. SPHB. In a subsequent e-mail dated
January 18, 2010, Counsel for Claimants submitted that that letter was improper as
outside of the briefing schedule.

On December 14, 2009, Respondent filed a Submission Concerning New Facts Relating To
Claimants' Activities In Mongolia, whereby requesting the Tribunal:

(1) To reopen the hearings, admit new evidence and grant leave to amend
the Statement of Defense and the Counterclaims;

(2) To grant interim measures ordering Claimants to place into escrow
USD 74.3 million; and

(3) | To set a schedule for briefing of the foregoing issues.

On December 16, 2009, the Tribunal, through its Secretary, requested that Claimants file
their answer to Respondent's Submission Concerning New Facts Relating To Claimants'
Activities In Mongolia by January 11, 2010.

On January 5, 2010, the Tribunal, through its Secretary, requested Respondent to submit
an English translation of R-181 which had been previously filed in Mongolian only. The
requested translation of R-181 was provided to the Tribunal on January 6, 2010.

On January 11, 2010, Claimants filed their Response to Mongolia's Submission of
December 14, 2009.

On January 18, 2010, Respondent sent to the Tribunal a letter brief commenting on
Claimants! Response to Mongolia's Submission of December 14, 2009.

On the same day, Counsel for Claimants wrote to the Tribunal objecting to the foregoing
Respondent's letter brief.

On the same day, the Tribunal requested Claimants to submit an English translation of
CE-134 which had been previously filed in Mongolian only. The requested translation of
CE-134 was provided to the Tribunal on January 20, 2010.

On February 15, 2010, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Respondent's Submission
concerning New Facts relating to Claimants' Activities in Mongolia, whereby dismissing all
of Respondent's requests.

On November 24, 2010, the Tribunal received a letter from Respondent indicating that
the alleged bank fraud referred to in its previous correspondence might have an effect
on this arbitration and the eventual issuance of an award under the Dutch Arbitration
Act.

On November 25, 2010, in a letter to the Tribunal, Claimants stated that, since
Respondent was not asking the Tribunal to do anything, they saw no point in providing
a response to that letter.

On November 29, 2010, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of that correspondence from
the Parties.

On January 19, 2011, Counsel for the Respondent again sent a letter to the Tribunal,
commenting on certain press articles with respect to Mr. Paushok and his operations in
Russia and providing copies of said press articles to the Tribunal.

On January 20, 2011, Counsel for the Claimants objected to the Respondent's
communication of January 19, 2011.

On January 24, 2011, the Tribunal informed Counsel for the Parties that the matters
raised in Respondent's letter of January 19, 2011 were clearly outside of the scope of the
dispute submitted to the Tribunal and, therefore, the Tribunal would not take it into
account for the purpose of the present Award.

The Tribunal deliberated on various occasions before issuing this Award on Jurisdiction
and Liability (the "Award").

SUMMARY OF FACTS

This summary of facts does not purport to be exhaustive. When necessary, other sections
of this Award will include further discussion of facts relevant to the particular issues
addressed in those sections.

The Treaty was concluded on November 29, 1995, entered into force on February 26,
2006 and applies to investments made since January 1, 1949.1

Since 1997 and until December 2008, GEM was engaged in the business of exploring and
developing placer gold deposits in Mongolia.

According to Claimants, GEM was the second largest gold mining company in
Mongolia, operating five open pit mines, holding, as of November 2008, 52 exploration
and production licenses and employing 1470 individuals, including approximately 700
Mongolian nationals. Over the course of its operations, GEM extracted more than 25
tons of chemically pure gold from its operations within Mongolia, including
approximately four tons of chemically pure gold in 2006.

The main competitor of GEM in Mongolia was KOO Boroo Gold ("Boroo"), a gold
mining company owed by Canadian interests. The relevancy of Boroo Gold's operations
for this arbitration is limited to the issues related to the stability agreements executed
between Boroo and Respondent.

A stability agreement is an agreement between a State and an investor for the purpose of
stabilizing (freezing), at least to a certain extent and for a certain period of time, the taxes
payable by an investor and/or other legislative, regulatory or administrative measures
affecting it. In the context of this arbitration, the subject-matter of the various stability
agreements entered into by Mongolia is limited to taxation.

In May 2001, GEM submitted an application for a stability agreement, by way of which
GEM was looking to freeze the taxation regime applicable thereto and to set specific
rates for all the 14 taxes then applicable to GEM.2

Further to GEM's application for a stability agreement, on June 5, 2001, the Ministry of
Finance appointed a working group (the "Working Group"), which included Mr.

Ganbat, who testified at the Hearing on Jurisdiction and Liability, to consider GEM's
application.3

Ultimately, GEM and Mongolia did not come to an agreement with respect to the terms
of a stability agreement (for reasons upon which the Parties disagree and which are
further addressed in the relevant part of this Award) and, therefore, no such agreement
was signed. In this context, the Tribunal notes that on May 9, 2000, Boroo's initial
stability agreement‘ was amended to "confirm" that Boroo's tax regime was entirely
frozen (i.e. Boroo was exempted from novel taxes).>

Since 2005, VNGM is/was, along with GEM, involved in the construction of a major oil
and gas refinery project in Mongolia (the "Oil and Gas Refinery Project"). According to
Claimants, the expenses for the Oil and Gas Refinery Project, including the pre-
construction phase, exceeded USD 20 million.

The price of gold on the world market remained below USD 362 per ounce between
January 1997 and December 2001. In 2002, the price of gold started increasing
dramatically to reach USD 720.1 per ounce on May 11, 2006.

On or about May 12, 2006, Mongolia's major political parties caused the Great Khural
(Parliament) to pass a law "On Imposition of Price Increase (Windfall) Taxes on Some
Commodities" (the "WPT Law").é

Pursuant to sections 4.1.4, 6.2 and 7 of the WPT Law, any gold sales at prices in excess of
USD 500 per ounce were subject to a tax at the rate of 68% on the amount exceeding a
base price of USD 500 per ounce (the "Windfall Profit Tax" or the "WPT"). The base
price was set as a fixed amount, without reference to any production cost index. The sale
reference price was the price set by the London Metal Exchange (as discussed herein
below in the context of Claimants' claim in relation to the WPT paid by GEM prior to the
declaration of unconstitutionality, the London Metal Exchange does not set a price for
gold).

Having negatively affected the income yield of Claimants! investment (Claimants indeed
allege that the WPT put GEM in a position where it would have to sell its gold at a loss),
the imposition of the WPT and the events connected therewith are the main factors
which prompted Claimants to institute the present proceedings and constitute the crux
of the dispute between the Parties.

As early as May 16, 2006 and on numerous occasions thereafter, Claimant Paushok, both
by way of written communications and meetings in person, brought the issue of the
WPT Law and its negative effects on his investments to the attention of high Mongolian
officials, including the then President, His Excellency Mr. Enkhbayar, but to no avail.

The WPT Law came into force on June 8, 2006.

On July 8, 2006, Mongolia also changed the requirements for employment of foreign
nationals by mining companies, the Great Khural passing the law "On Minerals" (the
"2006 Minerals Law").”

Pursuant to section 43 of the 2006 Minerals Law, the maximum number of foreign
nationals employed by a mining company is limited to 10% of its workforce unless the
company pays a penalty equal to ten times the minimum monthly salary for each
foreign national it employs above that percentage (the "Foreign Workers Fee" or the
"FWF"), whereas prior to the adoption of the 2006 Minerals Law, the Law On Export of
Workforce and Import of Foreign Workforce Specialists’, which is still applicable to the
industries other than the mining industry, only required the payment of a fee equal to
two times the minimum wage of each foreign worker approved by the Mongolian
agency responsible for labor matters.?

According to Claimants, GEM had to pay approximately MNT 588,300,000 (about
USD 500,000 at the exchange rate prevailing in November 2008) each month in penalty
as its operations required the employment of a substantial number of foreign workers.

On July 19, 2006, expecting a swift abolition or reduction of the WPT and in an attempt
to alleviate the financial consequences of the WPT by postponing the sales of gold, GEM
entered into a so-called Safe Custody/Sale and Purchase of Precious Metal Agreement
(the "SCSA") with the Central Bank of Mongolia (MongolBank"), which agreement
was later amended by a Supplementary Agreement No. 1 dated October 5, 2006."

Pursuant to the SCSA (as amended), with respect to which the Parties do not agree
either on the qualification nor the consequences thereof, GEM and MongolBank seem to
have agreed as follows:

(1) GEM would deliver to MongolBank for safekeeping and eventual sale at
least one million grams of chemically pure gold prior to December 25,
2007;

(2) Upon delivery of gold, MongolBank would advance to GEM sums equal
to 85% of the value of the delivered quantity of gold;

(3) At least one ton of the gold delivered for safekeeping would be sold to
MongolBank on a date designated by GEM by way of a letter (the "Sale
Letter") during the period prior to December 25, 2007 (the "Sale Date");

(4) The ultimate purchase price of the gold would be determined in
accordance with the price of gold as of the Sale Date.

In accordance with the SCSA, on various dates between July 20, 2006 and January 19,
2007 (the "Delivery Dates"), GEM deposited unrefined gold bullion bars (weighting
3,299,984 grams and containing 2,951,025.20 grams of chemically pure gold) into the
custody of MongolBank for safekeeping (the "Gold"), which Gold represented
approximately 75% of GEM's annual production for 2006 and more than 13% of the total
volume of gold production in Mongolia in that year.

According to Claimants, GEM ceased depositing its gold with MongolBank after
January 19, 2007, because it needed the gold to secure loans from various commercial
banks in Mongolia.

In the fall of 2006, the Mongolian Cabinet attempted to amend the WPT Law to increase
the base price to USD 650, but the Great Khural refused to act. In May 2008, the Cabinet
again attempted to reform the gold taxation, abolishing the WPT Law and replacing it
with increased royalties, but to no avail. In November 2008, the Great Khural amended
the WPT Law to increase the base price taken into account by to the WPT from USD 500
to USD 850.

On December 13, 2006, the Constitutional Court of Mongolia found Articles 4.1.4 and 6.2
of the WPT Law unconstitutional as those articles set the base price of gold by reference
to the London Metal Exchange which does not establish the price of gold. It suspended the
application of the WPT Law and urged the Great Khural to promptly amend it to
remedy that deficiency.

On December 21, 2006, the Mongolian Parliament promptly cured that defect by passing
an amendment to the WPT Law, defining the reference price as a price determined daily
by the Central Bank of Mongolia (the "WPT Law Amendment").

Being of the view that the WPT Law Amendment had no retroactive effect and having
paid the WPT on certain sales that occurred between June 8, 2006 and December 21, 2006
in the amount of MNT 611,927,045 (approximately USD 523,000), GEM, shortly after the
ruling of the Constitutional Court, brought an action before the Court of first instance in
the Chingeltey district seeking the return of the WPT that it had paid prior to the WPT
Law Amendment.

On April 9, 2007, the Court of first instance of the Chingeltey district upheld GEM's
claim for reimbursement of the WPT paid in its entirety (Decision No. 354), but that
decision was subsequently reversed by the Capital Court!?, the decision of which was
subsequently confirmed by the Supreme Court of Mongolia.

On August 7, 2007, the Main Tax Office of Mongolia (the "Tax Office") audited GEM
and concluded that the amounts received under the SCSA at the Delivery Dates by GEM
from MongolBank were proceeds from a sale and thus subject to the Windfall Profit Tax,
and the subsoil resources (royalty) tax.

The Tax Office then issued the Assessment Statement of the State Tax Inspectors
No. 210906 (the "First Tax Assessment")!*, which covered the period from July 20, 2006
to January 2007, was based on the value of the 85% prepayment for the gold at the
Delivery Dates and required GEM to pay MNT 11,172,300,000 (approximately
USD 9,494,926) in royalties as well as the WPT plus interest in the amount of
MNT 5,428,300,000 (approximately USD 4,613,312). These amounts break down as
follows (in MNT millions):

Total Royalties and WPT: 11172,3 Total interest on R. and WPT: 5428,3
Grand Total: MNT 16,600,600,000 (USD 14,108,238)

 

 

Despite the unclear language of the First Tax Assessment and in light of Annex 2 of
Paushok-I, it seems that, at least as far as the WPT is concerned, this assessment covered
only the "sale" of the first 1,010,046.29 grams of chemically pure gold (approximately
one ton) out of 2,951,025.20 grams of chemically pure gold (corresponding to the actual
weight of gold bars of 3,299,984 grams) deposited with MongolBank pursuant to the
SCSA. The WPT allegedly due further to the "sale" of the remaining 1,940,978.91 grams
of chemically pure gold had been apparently withheld and remitted to the tax
authorities on a date unspecified by MongolBank itself.15

Believing that the imposition of the WPT on a sale that had not occurred yet is improper,
GEM refused to pay the taxes and penalties and challenged the First Tax Assessment by
way of administrative means and recourses before Mongolian Courts. However, as set
out below, all GEM's attempts to quash the First Tax Assessment proved unsuccessful
and GEM subsequently paid all the amounts assessed under the First Tax Assessment
(ie. MNT 11,915,300,000), save for part of the interest, which remained outstanding in
the amount of MNT 4,685,300,000 (GEM having paid interest in the amount of MNT
743,000,000 out of the total amount of interest of MNT 5,428,300,000 due in relation to
both the WPT and the royalties).1°

financier of the project, suspended their involvement and financing allegedly due to
GEM's lack of liquidity and its dispute with the Tax Office.”

Around the same time, having been alerted by the actions of the Mongolian tax
authorities, GEM enquired with MongolBank about the status of the Gold delivered
pursuant to the SCSA and learned from a MongolBank press release that the Gold had
been refined and exported out of Mongolia and, so, according to Claimants, contrary to
the terms of the SCSA.18

On September 13, 2007, the Tax Office issued a notice reminding GEM of its obligation to
pay the amount of MNT 16,600,600,000 (approximately USD 14,108,238) due pursuant to
the First Tax Assessment within ten days of the date of the notice (Notice
no. 2107090001).19

On September 27, 2007, the Tax Office seized GEM's bank accounts. The accounts
remained seized until October 18, 2007.2°

Subsequently, GEM unsuccessfully challenged the First Tax Assessment, including by
way of recourses before Mongolian Courts, as outlined below.

On October 11, 2007, the Capital Administrative Court rejected GEM's challenge of the
First Tax Assessment, concluding that GEM sold the Gold to MongolBank, and, thus,
became a payer of the WPT, as appears from a copy of the Capital Administrative Court
Decision No. 254.2! This decision was subsequently confirmed by the Supreme Court of
Mongolia (Decision of the Supreme Court No. 249 dated December 11, 2007).

According to Claimants, in October 2007, MongolBank, dissatisfied with GEM's inquiries
with respect to the status of the Gold, instructed Mongolian banks under MongolBank's
supervision to suspend their business with GEM until the dispute between MongolBank
and GEM would be resolved.

In October 2007, GEM learned that the Gold might have been deposited with the Bank of
Nova Scotia in London (this information was later confirmed by MongolBank) and, thus,
initiated proceedings before the English courts to localize and secure the Gold. In
December 2007, however, the English Appellate Court reversed the lower court (which
had ruled in favor of GEM) and concluded that MongolBank enjoys sovereign
immunity.

On November 6, 2007, MongolBank, in response to GEM's letters, confirmed that it was
willing to return the Gold refined 999,9 finesse but was not in a position to return the
actual physical Gold deposited by GEM (as it had been refined).

On November 7, 2007 and November 8, 2007, GEM sold to commercial banks the gold
mined since February 2007.

On November 8, 2007, Claimants informed Respondent and MongolBank of their
intention to initiate the present proceedings and issued a Notice of Arbitration against
Respondent on November 30, 2007, which Notice of Arbitration was delivered to
Respondent on December 3, 2007.

After November 8, 2007, the dispute between the Parties became highly publicized in
Mongolian media, local newspapers publishing several articles which were highly
critical of Claimant Paushok.

On December 8, 2007, Claimant Paushok left Mongolia for Russia.

On or prior to December 10, 2007, the Tax Office issued another tax assessment against
GEM with respect to the WPT on the gold sold to commercial banks (Trade and
Development Bank, Zoos, Anod and Ulan Bator) on November 7, 2007 and November 8,
2007 in the amount of MNT 28,321,741,000 billion (approximately USD 24 million)
(Notice no. 2106020024 4, the "Second Tax Assessment"). The amount claimed therein
breaks down as follows:

 

 

 

 

 

Deductions at source 83,990,000
WPT 28,237,751,000
Total 28,321,741,000

 

 

On December 12, 2007, one day after the rejection of GEM's last available appeal by the
Supreme Court on December 11, 2007, GEM obtained a loan from Bank Golomt and paid
the WPT (without interest) due under the First Tax Assessment in the amount of
MNT 7,672,000,000 (approximately USD 6,519,930) (Payment Order no. PPT-02204 dated
December 12, 2007).25 On a date unspecified, GEM also paid MNT 743,000,000 on
account of interest on royalties claimed in the First Tax Assessment (the total sum
claimed under that heading amounting to MNT 1,708,700,000).

On December 13, 2007, GEM sent a letter to Mr. Zandanbat, the chief of the State Budget
Revenue Control Department (Letter no. 1551/0526), requesting a 60-day grace period for
the payment of the balance of the taxes due pursuant to the Second Tax Assessment (i.e.
taxes on the gold sold to commercial banks on November 7 and 8, 2007). GEM would
later request a longer grace period (up to one year) both from the tax authorities and the

then Prime Minister (His Excellency Mr. S. Bayar) in order to allow GEM to pay this
amount over the year 2008 from its own revenues but these requests were denied.2”

Further to the Second Tax Assessment, on December 17, 2007, the head of the Tax Office,
Mr. Zorig, gave an interview to Odryin Sonin, a Mongolian newspaper, and is reported
to have made the following statement.28

"Of course, we will do our best to make [GEM pay all taxes]. The
company's licenses might be suspended or canceled altogether.
This is a way out for the state to make the company pay all taxes
due."

On December 19, 2007, Mr. Zandanbat, the chief of the State Budget Revenue Control
Department, responded that the tax authorities would decide on GEM's request of
December 13, 2007, depending on whether GEM was going to pay the WPT and the
royalties allegedly due upon completion of final settlements under the SCSA (which was
going to expire on December 25, 2007) and the balance of interest (MNT 4,685,300,000)
due pursuant to the First Tax Assessment (Letter no. 1/597).2°

By letters dated December 24% and 251, 2007, GEM advised MongolBank that it was
willing to sell 1,010,046.290 grams of chemically pure gold and requested the return of
the remaining 1,940,978.91 grams of chemically pure gold deposited with MongolBank
(the "Remaining Gold"), the whole in accordance with the SCSA.

On December 25, 2007, MongolBank informed GEM that it had to sell all the gold
deposited pursuant to the SCSA, implicitly refusing GEM's request for return of the gold
not sold*2 and "purchasing" the Remaining Gold.

It seems that on the occasion of the sale by GEM to MongolBank of 1,010,046.290 grams
of chemically pure gold, the WPT, in the total amount of MNT 7,993,276,343
(USD 6,831,860) without interest, was mostly paid by GEM (MNT 7,672,000,000 or
USD 6,557,265) and partly withheld by MongolBank (MNT 321,276,343 or USD 274,595),
whereas MongolBank withheld the entirety of the WPT allegedly due in relation to the
"sale" of the Remaining Gold (MNT 15,323,498,355 or USD 13,097,007) and remitted the
amount so collected to the Ministry of Finance of Mongolia. The interest on the WPT
assessed by the Tax Office in relation to the sale of the Gold to MongolBank pursuant to

27 Tbragimova Ex.-32 to Ex.-36.

the SCSA amounted to MNT 3,719,600,000 (USD 3,179,145), but had not been paid
either by GEM or MongolBank**.

145. In December 2007, the Mongolian Ministry of Industry and Trade refused to approve
GEM's exploration and production plans for 2008. According to Claimants, the refusal
was in retaliation to GEM's refusal to pay the WPT assessed against it. According to
Respondent, the refusal was based on GEM's failure to meet the regulatory conditions
required for such a plan to be approved.35

146. As GEM postponed all of its sales of gold until the latter part of the year (both in reason
of the WPT and in order to benefit from the continuing increase in the price of gold in
world markets), GEM sold the gold mined in 2007 at the year end (November 7 and 8 as
mentioned above) for a total of USD 101 million (when the price of gold was USD 832
per ounce).

147. According to Claimants, despite the substantial increase of the price of gold over 2007,
GEM lost USD 1M on the occasion of the sale referred to in the preceding paragraph as
GEM's costs, including other taxes, amounted to USD 75M and the WPT amounted to
USD 27M.°%6

148. On January 4, 2008, GEM wrote to the then newly elected Prime Minister of Mongolia,
His Excellency Mr. S. Bayar, requesting him to restructure the payment of (i) the WPT
(and another minor tax) claimed pursuant to the Second Tax Assessment and (ii) the
outstanding interest claimed pursuant to the First Tax Assessment in order to allow
GEM to pay these amounts over the year 2008 from its own revenues.%”

149. As a result of the exchange of correspondence which was taking place between GEM
and the tax authorities, on January 24, 2008, GEM and the Tax Office executed a
schedule of payment of the WPT due pursuant to the Second Tax Assessment
(MNT 31,321,517,58438) and interest due pursuant to the First Tax Assessment
(MNT 4,685,300,000%") in the total amount of MNT 36,006,817,584 (Schedule of Windfall

38 The evidence submitted by the Parties does not allow to reconcile the amount set in the repayment schedule
(MNT 31,321,517,584, RE-i) with the amount set in the Second Tax Assessment (MNT 28,237,751,000), Notice
no. 2106020024, CE-88), as well as with the amount mentioned in the draft repayment schedule submitted by GEM

(MNT 28,237,751,000, letter dated December 29, 2007, Ibragimova Ex.-36). However, this fact does not have any
direct bearing on the decision rendered by the Tribunal.

3° This amount of MNT 4,685,300,000 represents the difference between the total amount of interest due for the late
payment of the royalties and the WPT assessed under the First Tax Assessment (ie, MNT 5,428,300,000, see
Statement of the State Tax Inspector No. 210906 dated August 7, 2007, CE-18 and the payment made by GEM ona
date unspecified in the amount of MNT 743,000,000 (see Paushok-I, Annex 2).

Tax Payment 2007 and Penalties Imposed by Tax Inspector Act No. 210906, the
"Schedule of Payment").

The Schedule of Payment extended the payment deadline from January 24, 2008 to
March 24, 2008.

On February 10, 2008, GEM's alleged outstanding tax liabilities increased because GEM's
corporate income tax of MNT 6,426 billion (approximately USD 5.5 million) became due.
GEM does not dispute that the corporate income tax was owed but alleges that it was
not able to pay this amount on time by reason of its disrupted cash-flow.

On February 22, 2008, the Tax Office created a working group with the purpose of
examining the allegations of tax evasion by GEM by way of hiding and removing assets
in the amount of MNT 3,332,587.40 (USD 2,860).41

On the same day, the Tax Office, having noticed that GEM had exported operating
machinery and equipment, informed that company of its intention to seize the assets
thereof for failure to make payments in accordance with the Payment Schedule as well
as GEM's failure to pay corporate income taxes, in the total amount of MNT 43 billion
(USD 37 million).2

On February 25, 2008, the Tax Office filed a claim against GEM with the Bayangol
District Court to collect the balance of MNT 4,685,300,000 payable under the First Tax
Assessment and representing the interest for the late payment of royalties and the WPT
(the "Collection Claim"), along with a petition for seizure before judgment of GEM's
assets.

On March 13, 2008, the Tax Office amended the amount sought in the Collection Claim
filed with the Bayangol District Court, increasing the said amount by
MNT 40,187,161,500, the said amount being the sum of amounts allegedly due for the
corporate income tax (MNT 6,424,060,600), deductions at source (MNT 619,893,200), the
WPT (MNT 33,075,468,500) and the value added tax (MNT 67,739,200), the total sum
being then claimed in the Collection Claim amounting to MNT 44,872,461,500
(USD 38,124,436).

On March 23, 2008, the Tribunal issued a Temporary Restraining Order, the conclusions
of which are reproduced herein above (see "Procedural History" section).

157. On March 25, 2008, the Tax Office sent to GEM a notice of failure to meet its tax liabilities
that became due on March 24, 2008, pursuant to, among others, the Schedule of
Payment, requesting to pay the total amount claimed in the Collection Claim within
three days of the date of the notice (Notice no. 2106020024)**.

158. On May 12, 2008, the Bayangol District Court issued Ruling No. 16067 dismissing the
Collection Claim on the basis of lis pendens with the present arbitration.

159. | According to Claimants, Mongolian authorities (namely the Mongolian Special Board for
Mineral Resources, a body of the Mongolian Government responsible for, inter alia, the
approval of gold-mining projects) retaliated against GEM (and Bumbat) further to the
initiation of the present proceedings by, among others, delaying the approval of
Bumbat's project to mine gold from the Baga Hailaast placer deposit (Minutes of
meeting of July 24, 200848) and delayed or refused the conversion of exploration licenses
into mining licenses with respect to five different sites.“

160. On September 2, 2008, the Tribunal issued its Order on Interim Measures, the
conclusions of which are reproduced herein above (see "Procedural History" section).

161. On November 25, 2008, the Great Khural amended the WPT increasing the USD 500
threshold to USD 850.%°

162. On November 27, 2008, the Tax Office filed a request with the Capital Administrative
Court to issue an order and a writ of execution regarding the enforcement of its Decision
No. 254, dated October 11, 2007.5! It bears mention that the said decision only dismissed
GEM's challenge of the First Tax Assessment and that the outstanding balance
thereunder amounted to MNT 4,685,300,000, a fact of which the Tax Office could not
have been unaware of as it requested the payment thereof in the Schedule of Payment.

163. On the same day, the Capital Administrative Court granted the Tax Office's request and
issued the "Court Order's and the "Writ of Execution"s for the enforcement of this
court's Decision No. 254, dated October 11, 200755.

4 The Tribunal notes that the said Notice no. 2106020024 dated March 25, 2008, (Ibragimova Ex.-57) bears the same
number as Notice no. 2106020024 dated December 10, 2007 and referred herein as the "Second Tax Assessment",
(CE-88 and Ibragimova Ex.-28). Despite this fact, the contents of these two documents are completely different.

Claimants let the OIM expire by not making the USD 2 million/month payment into the
escrow account and, alternatively, not providing an equivalent bank guarantee. In a
letter to the Parties dated November 24, 2008, the Tribunal pointed out that GEM's
alleged cash flow inability to support a monthly payment of USD 2 million (Letter from
Claimants to the Tribunal, dated September 30, 2008) was irrelevant as the OIM was not
addressed to GEM and Claimants themselves could have made the required payments
should they have had the means to do so.

The OIM expired on December 2, 2008.

Upon expiration of the OIM, Mongolian officials from various courts and governmental
bodies attended GEM's and VNGM's offices, mines and facilities and took a series of
measures against GEM, VNGM, Bumbat, KOO Yakhton ("Yakhton"), and KOO Vostok-
Energo, a/k/a KOO East-Energo ("Vostok-Energo"), seizing each company's bank
accounts and the contents thereof>*, putting liens on all assets of GEM and VNGM*’ and
seizing approximately 12 kg of gold.58

Subsequently, the Mongolian authorities also refused to extend the work permits of
GEM's foreign employees on the basis of GEM's failure to pay the Foreign Workers fee
for 2007 and so, according to Claimants, contrary to prior administrative practice.

According to Claimants, as a result of the above actions, GEM has been forced to
discontinue its gold-mining and gold-processing activities, keeping only 168 employees
(out of 939) to physically protect GEM's assets and maintain a minimum operation at
GEM's headquarters.

On December 4, 2008, the Tax Office issued a notice claiming the payment of taxes,
including the WPT for years 2007 and 2008 and interest due under the First Tax
Assessment, in the total amount of MNT 56,423,191,700 (USD 48 million) within 10 days
from the date of the notice (Notice no. 2108120001, dated December 4, 2008, the "Third
Tax Assessment").

On December 4 and 5, 2008, GEM complained about the actions of the Court Bailiff's
Office to the Senior Bailiff. On December 8, 2008, the Senior Bailiff summarily
dismissed GEM's complaint of December 5, 2008.2

The outcome of GEM's complaint of December 4, 2008 is unknown.

On December 11, 2008, GEM filed a complaint against the allegedly unlawful
enforcement by the Court Bailiff's Office with the Sukhe-Bator District Court.

On December 17, 2008, on an ex parte application, Justice Zhavkhlan of the Sukhe-Bator
District Court decided to suspend the enforcement of the Court Order of November 27,
2008 pending the resolution of GEM's complaint (Judge Order no. 7556). Justice
Zhavkhlan's decision was served on the Court Bailiff's Office the same day.

Disregarding the ruling of Justice Zhavkhlan, the Court Bailiff's Office continued the
enforcement of the Court Order of November 27, 2008° by issuing an Order on Seizure
of Property no. 6, dated December 19, 20088, which prompted complaints from GEM to
Justice Zhavkhlan on December 22, 20086? and the Department for Judicial Enforcement
on December 26, 2008.7°

On December 22, 2008, the Capital Court Bailiff's Office lodged an appeal against the
decision of Justice Zhavkhlan. On or about the same day, Senior Bailiff Batsukh
reportedly met with Justice Zhavkhlan to discuss the case.7!

On December 23, 2008, the Capital Court Bailiff's Office petitioned Chief Justice N.
Sukhbaatar of the Sukhe-Bator District Court to have Justice Zhavkhlan removed from
the case opposing GEM and the Court Bailiff's Office for having rendered an ex parte
decision.”

On December 24, 2008, equally on an ex parte basis, Chief Justice N. Sukhbaatar of the
Sukhe-Bator District Court accepted Court Bailiff's Office's challenge of Justice
Zhavkhlan, removed him from the case and assigned same to Justice Altanchimeg
(Order of Justice N. Sukhbaatar no. 002, dated December 24, 2008).73

On the same day and without hearing GEM, Chief Justice Sukhbaatar and Justices
Altanchimeg and Monkhzul of the Sukhe-Bator District Court allowed the appeal
lodged by the Court Bailiff's Office against the decision of Justice Zhavkhlan and

63 Ibragimova Ex.-136. The Tribunal has not been made aware as to whether a decision had been issued by the Sukhe-
Baattar District Court on GEM's complaint of December 11, 2008 against the unlawful enforcement by the Court
Bailiff's Office.

annulled the suspension of the enforcement proceedings (Court Judgment no. 03, dated
December 24, 2008).74

Relying on the above decision, the Department for Judicial Enforcement dismissed
GEM's complaints with respect to the disregard of Justice Zhavkhlan's decision while it
was executory (from December 17, 2008 to December 24, 2008) (Letter from the
Department for Judicial Enforcement to GEM dated December 31, 2008).75

After the occurrence of the enforcement measures undertaken by Respondent against
GEM and other Claimants' Mongolian companies, the Parties attempted to negotiate a
modus vivendi which would have allowed the continuation of Claimants! Mongolian
companies' operations during the pendency of this arbitration, but were unable to come
to an agreement.

In August 2009, Mongolia repealed the WPT, with the repeal being effective in 2011.7

The Tribunal will now proceed to consider the following issues relating to its jurisdiction
and the admissibility of Claimants’ claims, the substance of those claims and its
jurisdiction over the counterclaims and their admissibility. The Tribunal has given
careful consideration to the factual and legal arguments raised by the Parties in their
written and oral submissions. The Tribunal’s reasons, while not necessarily repeating
every argument advanced by the Parties, deal with those that the Tribunal considers the
determinative factors required to decide those issues.

This section addresses the arguments of the parties with respect to the five general
objections to jurisdiction and admissibility relevant to all of Claimants! Claims namely:

(1) _ Lack of protected investment;

(2) ITERA loans were not made by Claimants;

(3) Failure to abide by the six month negotiation period;

(4) Abuse of arbitral process;

(5) Failure to apply for a stability agreement.
Objections relating to specific claims, namely:

(1) Ratione temporis objection (with respect to the 2001 stability agreement
negotiation claims);

(2) Claimants! standing (with respect to the SCSA related claims);

(3) | Exhaustion of local remedies to reform a contractual gap (with respect to
the SCSA-related claims);

(4) Lack of protected investment - Bumbat (with respect to the "New Facts"
related claims);

are addressed in the individual sections pertaining to the claims concerned by a given
objection.

In its Order on Interim Measures, the Tribunal discussed the issue of prima _facie
jurisdiction and concluded that Claimants had succeeded in establishing such
jurisdiction.

At this stage, the Tribunal must rule not only as to whether the Tribunal has prima facie
jurisdiction but full and effective jurisdiction to render an award in this case. It will
therefore proceed to consider each objection raised by Respondent. Some objections
raised in the earlier part of this case were not raised again during the Hearing on
jurisdiction and liability or in Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief. But since none of the
objections were formally abandoned, the Tribunal will address all of them.

LACK OF PROTECTED INVESTMENT
4.1.1 ARGUMENT OF THE PARTIES

In its Post-Hearing Brief”, Respondent raises a jurisdictional objection based on the lack
of an investment protected under the Treaty and argues that Claimants would not have
met their burden of proof with respect to same.

According to Respondent, the definition of "investment" under the Treaty refers to assets
"invested by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party."”8 Thus, "investment" does not include companies as such and is
limited to contributions by an investor.”

In light of the foregoing, Respondent submits that the filing of registration certificates of
various companies (GEM, VNG, Yakhton) is not sufficient to establish the Tribunal's
jurisdiction as these certificates do not prove Claimants' contributions.®

Respondent further asserts that Mr. Paushok's testimony regarding an investment of
"USD 34.4 million in the form of direct contributions by [him] and [his] companies"! is
insufficient, unsupported by documentary evidence and does not allow to determine
who exactly made these contributions.®2

Respondent also takes issue with the alleged loans from ITERA International Energy
LLP and Mr. Paushok to GEM in the amount of USD 18 million as the documentary
evidence demonstrates that these loans were provided by ITERA International Energy
LLP alone.’

Respondent concludes its objection as follows:84

"32. To the extent that Claimants have come forward with
documentary evidence as to a purported investment, such as
the ITERA loan documentation, the documents have
contradicted Mr. Paushok's witness testimony. What remains
in evidence are unsubstantiated statements made by
Claimants and registration certificates. As Claimants' counsel
should know from their experience in international
investment arbitration, proof of "mere ownership of shares"

may be insufficient to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements
of the Russia-Mongolia BIT.

33. Consequently, the Tribunal must dismiss:

* Claims based solely on the registration certificates.
These certificates are insufficient to substantiate an
investment sufficient to meet the requirements of
Article 1 and 6 of the Russian-Mongolian BIT.

* Claims relating to the USD 18 million loan investment.
These loans were issued by an ITERA entity. These
claims include all investments detailed in Appendix III
of the Reply, as these assets were purchased by GEM
with ITERA funds.

* Claims relating to the alleged USD 34.4 million. This
alleged amount was not made by Claimants, but other
entities, according to Claimants themselves. Further, the
source of funding of these investments and their use has
not been disclosed.

* Claims relating to the USD 1 million investment claimed
by Mr. Paushok at the Hearing. Allegations of such an
investment are directly contradicted by
contemporaneous documentary evidence. "

In their Post-Hearing BriefS5, Claimants assert that this objection is ill-founded in fact
and in law.

First, Claimants observe that Mongolia's objection is time-barred pursuant to
Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as it had not been raised in the
Statement of Defense® and further point out that Respondent acknowledged at [227 of
its Rejoinder that Claimants' shares in GEM are an investment for the purpose of the
Treaty.8”

Second, Claimants submit that they proved their direct and indirect ownership of 100%
of shareholdings in GEM, VNGM, Yakhton and Bumbat and a 40% shareholding in
Vostokenergo and take the position that this is sufficient evidence of investment for the
purpose of the Treaty, as ownership of the shares in these Mongolian companies is

expressly listed as an example of a protected investment under Article 1(b) of the
Treaty.88

Third, Claimants argue that there is undisputed evidence of the following contributions
(assuming such evidence is required):

"Q) Mr. Paushok contributed USD 1 million of his own money
to start GEM between 1997 and 1999;"% and

(2) Mr. Paushok caused two of his 100%-owned companies,
Kifold and Yakhton, to contribute USD 34.4 million into the
charter capital of GEM."9!

Fourth, Claimants submit that the Treaty defines protected investments as "all kind of
assets" rather than just contributions”, which are but one example of investment.%
According to Claimants, Respondent's interpretation would lead to absurd conclusions,
namely that the Treaty does not even protect the value of Russian investors! shares in
Mongolian companies (because the investment would be limited to the amount for
which the investor bought the shares but not the shares as such), and is incompatible
with the compensation standard set forth in Article 4 of the Treaty.

Claimants are also of the view that the definition of investment includes the term
"income" as such, which is mentioned in Article 1(c) of the Treaty. Even if such is not the
case ("income" is not included in "investment"), "Claimants do not assert any claims with
respect to any payments from GEM and/or Claimants' other Mongolian companies to
Claimants".%

4.1.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

First of all, the Tribunal agrees with Respondent that Claimants bear the burden of the
proof to demonstrate that their investment is protected by Article 6 of the Treaty. The
dispute has to arise "in connection with realization of investments, including disputes
concerning the amount, terms or method of payment of the compensation."

The Tribunal disagrees however with Respondent's interpretation in so far as it argues
that "investments" does not include "companies" and is limited to "contributions" in the

definition of investment. The definition provided in Article 1 (b) of the Treaty is quite
broad, embracing "all kinds of assets invested by an investor", including "in particular,
but without limitation [...] financial means, as well as shares, contributions and other
kinds of interests". That Article also refers, among other examples of investment, to "the
right to conduct business activities, granted by law or contract, including in particular
the right to prospect, extract and exploit natural resources". If "shares" in companies can
constitute "investment", it would be absurd to argue that a company the shares of which
are owned 100% by an investor would not constitute an "investment" as defined in the
Treaty. Respondent has repeatedly presented this argument in its submissions but the
Tribunal does not find support for it in the definition of investment contained in the
Treaty.

In the present instance, Claimants’ investment are the shares of GEM, a company
incorporated under Mongolian law as required by that country in order to engage into
the mining business and, through ownership of those shares, Claimants are entitled to
make claims concerning alleged Treaty breaches resulting from actions affecting the
assets of GEM, including its rights to mine gold deposits or its contractual rights and
thereby affecting the value of their shares. It is therefore important to note that
Claimants must prove that their claims arise out of the Treaty itself and not merely be an
attempt to exercise contractual rights belonging to GEM. To argue that Claimants could
not make such Treaty claims would render it practically meaningless in many instances;
a large number of countries require foreign investors to incorporate a local company in
order to engage into activities in sectors which are considered of strategic importance
(mining, oil and gas, communications etc.). In such situations, a BIT would be rendered
practically without effect if it were right to argue that any action taken by a State against
such local companies or their assets would be not be subject to Treaty claims by a
foreign investor because its investment is merely constituted of shares in that local
company.

In the case of Azurix v. Argentina, both the Tribunal and the ad hoc Committee on
annulment reached the same conclusion on a corporate structure very similar to the one
in the present case.

The Tribunal stated:

"We conclude the discussion on jus standi by affirming the jus
standi of Azurix in these proceedings: Azurix is the investor that
made the investment through indirectly owned and controlled
subsidiaries.°”"

The ad hoc Committee concluded similarly that:
"Although assets of ABA would as a matter of law belong to ABA

and not to Azurix, Azurix nonetheless had, by virtue of its
controlling shareholding in ABA "interests in the assets" of ABA

[...], and through that shareholding indirectly controlled those
assets. Assets of Azurix would also be an "investment" of Azurix
for the purposes of the BIT. Additionally, the legal and contractual
rights of ABA [...], including the rights under the Concession,
being indirectly controlled by Azurix throughout its majority
shareholding in ABA would similarly be "investments" of Azurix
for the purposes of the BIT.%"

Respondent has also spent considerable time arguing that Claimants do not qualify as
investors because, at best, they were nominal shareholders. It has however, recognized
that they were the direct or indirect shareholders of 100% of GEM, VGNM, Yakthon and
Bumbat and of 40% of Vostokenergo.” Respondent disputes the amounts effectively
invested by Claimants, and Mr. Paushok in particular, and argue that the amounts
would at best be very low. But nowhere in the Treaty is there a mention of a minimum
size of investment to qualify as investor. Whether most of the money used in the
creation and the development of GEM was borrowed or originated from Claimants
themselves is irrelevant for the purpose of jurisdiction in this case.

The Tribunal has to look at the situation as it stood at the time of the alleged breaches of
the Treaty by Respondent from the time of its entry into force on February 26, 2006. The
fact is that, at that time, GEM was the second largest producer of gold in Mongolia, with
annual gold sales in 2006 and 2007 well in excess of USD 100 million and that Claimants
at that time owned 100% of the shares of GEM. Respondent itself has also argued that
GEM made hundreds of millions of dollars of revenues prior to 2006. It is clear that such
an enterprise cannot be built out of thin air whatever the form of the initial investment.
Claimants as shareholders of GEM at the time of the alleged breaches were owners of
shares having a significant value by any standard and those shares come under the
definition of "investment" under the Treaty.

In light of the conclusion of the Tribunal as to the existence of an investment, there is no
need to rule on the argument of Claimants that Respondent's objection is time-barred.

ITERA LOANS ARE NOT CLAIMANTS' INVESTMENTS

4.2.1 | ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Respondent asserts that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione materiae over the
loans from ITERA International Energy LLP ("ITERA") to GEM in the amount of
USD 18 million in 1999 ("ITERA Loans") as same are alleged in C. Reply.1%

Respondent submits that ITERA not being a Claimant in this arbitration, these loans do

Claimants respond that ITERA loans having been fully repaid, they do not form part of

4.2.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

There is no claim by ITERA before this Tribunal and Claimants have stated that they
make no claim in connection with a contribution from that company. The objection of
Respondent is therefore without object.

FAILURE TO ABIDE BY THE SIX MONTH NEGOTIATION PERIOD
4.3.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Relying on Article 6 of the Treaty, Respondent argues that Claimants' failure to abide by
the six month negotiation period deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction to adjudicate all of
Claimants! Claims. In support of its objection, Respondent refers to Enron Corp. and
Ponderosa Assets v. The Argentine Republic! and Generation Ukraine Inc. v. Ukraine and
articulates it as follows: 10

"278. Mongolia in the Statement of Defense has submitted that
Claimants did not abide by the 6-month negotiation period
required by the terms of the BIT. Mongolia noted for the
Tribunal that Claimants never sent a dispute notice to the
Mongolian authorities, but rather addressed these authorities
only in their capacity as officers of GEM. Additionally,
Mongolia observed that the letters sent to Mongolian
authorities never concerned a specific incidence or claim, but
rather concerned only a policy disagreement with the law
itself. Mongolia therefore submitted that the Tribunal would
not have jurisdiction over Claimants! Claims.

279. Claimants do not address these issues. Rather, they assert
broadly that the notice period has been abided by letters
from GEM and that, in any event, the 6 month waiting
period does not constitute a jurisdictional requirement.
GEM's letters cannot credibly concern a negotiation between
its shareholders and Mongolia. Further, Claimants' legal
argument is flawed, as the waiting period does constitute a
jurisdictional requirement. [...]

282. [...] In light of the fact that no negotiations took place or

the original]

213. Claimants meet this objection with a three-fold defense:1

(1)

(2)

(3)

Claimants complied with the six-month waiting period as (i) they waited
more than six months after the WPT was enacted to commence this
arbitration; (ii) assuming a notice was required pursuant to Article 6 of
the Treaty, such a notice was provided to the then President of Mongolia,
Mr. Enkhbayar, on May 16, 200617, which notice made clear, despite
being on GEM's letterhead, that the dispute concerned the rights of
investors in the Mongolian mining sector; and (iii) Mr. Paushok met with
Mongolian officials more than 30 times to discuss his disagreement with
the WPT between May 2006 and late 2007;1°

Claimants were not required to wait six months because negotiations
would have been manifestly futile;° and

The six-month waiting period is not a jurisdictional requirement.1!°

214. Finally, Claimants argue that in any event more than six months has now passed since
Claimants commenced this arbitration".

215. Respondent also invokes the failure to abide by the six-month negotiation period as a
substantive defense (as opposed to a jurisdictional objection) to Claimants' treatment

claims.

216. In this regard, Respondent opines that the failure to abide by the six-month negotiation
period also "relates to the reasonableness of Claimants' conduct and their entitlement to
receive compensation for government behavior which they by their actions exacerbated,
or at the very least, provided no chance of remediation'"!2.

Claimants submit that not only they complied with all the requirements of Article 6 of
the Treaty but also that the argument raised by Respondent is ill-founded and, in any
event, moot.113

4.3.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS
Claimants did not fail to abide by the six-month negotiating period.

The WPT Law which constitutes the crux of the present dispute came into force on
June 8, 2006 and the Notice of Arbitration against Respondent was issued on
November 30, 2007. The Tribunal has uncontested evidence that, as early as May 2006
and on numerous occasions subsequently, Claimant Paushok raised with senior officials,
ministers and even the President of Mongolia the issue of the negative impact of the
WPT upon GEM and investors in the gold mining industry.

Arguendo, even if they had failed to abide by the negotiating period, this would not go to
jurisdiction, as that delay has long expired. In that case, the failure to abide by the
waiting period would come under the damages rather than the jurisdiction heading."4

Finally, the Tribunal is of the view that Respondent's reliance on the six month
negotiation period as a substantive defense has no basis in law.

ABUSE OF ARBITRAL PROCESS
4.4.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Respondent argues that Claimants abused their right to claim in arbitration under the
Treaty by reason of their pre-arbitration and arbitration conduct, which renders
Claimants’ claims being in breach of the principle of good faith and, thus, inadmissible.
In this context, Respondent accuses Claimants, among others, of (1) systematic tax
evasion by way of inter-company loans and service agreements, (2) having caused GEM
to violate its obligations under the mining licenses with regard to environmental
restoration and obligations to observe reasonable health and safety standards for their
workers; (3) having violated the TRO and the OIM.15

Claimants argue that the "abuse of rights" objection does not have either factual or legal
support:

"89. [...] Claimants are not required to guess the legal basis for
Mongolia's jurisdictional objection on which it (rather than
Claimants) bears the burden of proof. Having provided
absolutely no legal basis for its objection, Mongolia can

Claims.""16

44.2. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

While Claimants decided not to advance the security required by the OIM, such conduct
does not, by itself, deprive the Tribunal of its jurisdiction or render Claimants’ claims
inadmissible. This is a matter which may have some influence on the conclusions of a
tribunal as to the conduct of a party in a particular case but this goes to the merits of the
case, not to jurisdiction or admissibility. In the present instance, the failure of Claimants
to provide the ordered security resulted in allowing Respondent to implement measures
to secure its tax claims against Claimants, which it did.

As to the other allegations made by Respondent under this heading (improper transfer
of funds - prior to and during the arbitration -, environment, health and safety matters),
they rather go to the merits of the case and the Tribunal, whatever conclusion it reaches
on other grounds, is not of the view that the actions attributed to Claimants can be
considered as abuses of the legal process.

FAILURE TO APPLY FOR AND TO OBTAIN A STABILITY AGREEMENT
4.5.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Respondent first contended that GEM's failure to apply for a stability agreement
destroys Claimants’ reasonable and legitimate expectations with respect to the stability
of the tax environment and, thus, bars, all Claimants' treatment claims:

"175. [...] Where a stability agreement is available and relatively
easy to obtain, a failure of an investor to invest an amount
adequate to qualify for such an agreement and to apply for
one strongly militates against the notion that an investor's
professed expectation of tax stability was reasonable_[...]

255. To the extent that Claimants could make a claim with regard
to a fair and equitable treatment violation under the Russian-
Mongolian BIT, Claimants would have to show that their
investment-backed expectations were reasonable and
legitimate on the basis of the authorities cited by them. As set
out above, the question of tax-related treatment requires a
showing of reasonableness of expectations that is greater
than may have been the case with regard to other subject
matters. An investor, choosing not to commit to investing the
required minimal amount and to apply for a stability
agreement, does not meet this burden under the treaty.

227.

228.

229.

Rather, the investor as a practical matter could have a
reasonable investment-backed expectation only if it had in its
hands an undertaking to that effect and that was bargained
for and in exchange of a significant developmental
contribution. In this case, Claimants did not commit to
investing the required minimal amount and apply for such
an undertaking. Therefore, Claimants cannot invoke a breach
of the treatment protection in the Russian-Mongolian BIT
with regard to changes in Mongolian tax laws.""!7

Once Claimants disproved Respondent's allegation that GEM did not apply for a
stability agreement (proving that GEM applied for a stability agreement but was denied
such by Respondent, as explained herein below), Respondent reiterated its argument on
the basis of GEM's alleged refusal to commit to make additional investments in order to
enter into a stability agreement with Mongolia."'8

Respondent asserts that stability agreements were readily available and it would have
been sufficient for GEM to commit to a prospective (future) investment of USD 2 million
(which GEM allegedly refused to do) to achieve a stability agreement with Mongolia,
which stability agreement would have protected GEM against novel taxes, including the
WPT" and the FWF.120

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent summarizes its position as follows (i) stability
agreements were readily available to mining investors; (ii) a stability agreement would
have protected GEM against the WPT (and other novel taxes) and (iii) GEM did not
obtain a stability agreement because it failed to undertake to invest future funds.!2!

Claimants argue that Respondent's position is ill-founded in law as neither the
protections available under the Treaty nor Claimants’ treatment claims under the Treaty
are conditional upon the existence of a stability agreement.!22

Claimants also argue that Respondent's position is ill-founded in fact, as GEM did apply
for a stability agreement:

"112. As a factual matter, Mongolia's stability agreement theory
also fails. As set forth above, the cross-examination of
Mongolia's witnesses at the Hearing revealed affirmative
evidence of discrimination regarding Mongolia's denial of
GEM's application for a stability agreement. With equal

force, that same evidence shows that (i) GEM did apply for a
stability agreement, and (ii) Mongolia would not agree to
grant protections beyond those in the model stability
agreement. Given that novel taxes were not protected in the
model stability agreement, Mongolia cannot now argue that
GEM would have been protected from the WPT and the FWF
if it had signed it."3

4.5.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

In its Defense, Respondent alleged that Claimants were not entitled to the protection of
the Treaty because GEM had not applied for a stability agreement (in light of Claimants’
Reply, that allegation was not repeated by Respondent in its Rejoinder). Claimants
alleged in their Reply that GEM did apply for a stability agreement and the Tribunal is
satisfied, on the basis of the written and oral evidence submitted to it, that such an
application, albeit unsuccessful, was made. Even if they had not done so, the Tribunal
does not see how that failure to make an application for a stability agreement would be
sufficient to conclude that Claimants’ treatment claims under the Treaty are
inadmissible. Respondent has presented no valid argument in support of such a
statement and this objection is therefore dismissed. Claimants base their claims on the
Treaty; nowhere in that Treaty can one find a provision that would require anything like
a stability agreement before they could contest the validity of the WPT or the FWF or
any other action undertaken by Respondent subsequently to the entry into force of the
Treaty.

It bears mention that Respondent also seemingly presented the "stability agreement
argument" as a substantive defense to the WPT and FWF-related claims. Thus, the issue
of the stability agreement will be further discussed in this Award later in the context of
the WPT and FWF-related claims and the 2001 Stability Agreement Negotiations claims.
Specifically in relation to this latter claim (the 2001 Stability Agreement Negotiations
claims), the dates relating to an application for a stability agreement are going to be of
significant importance to determine whether the Treaty can be invoked in connection
with the treatment of GEM’s application for a stability agreement by Mongolia. The
objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis will be addressed separately when dealing with
that issue.

CONCLUSION ON JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OF THE CLAIMS

The Tribunal therefore dismisses the five general objections to jurisdiction and
admissibility raised by Respondent. As stated earlier, the four remaining objections to
jurisdiction and admissibility limited to specific claims (i.e. the 2001 Stability Agreement
Negotiations, the Safe Custody and Sale Agreement and the "New Facts" related claims)
are addressed in the individual sections pertaining to these claims.

CLAIMANTS' CLAIMS

The Tribunal will now proceed to consider the Claimants' claims, which are organized
by their subject matter (rather than by sections of the Treaty or applicable standards of
protection) as follows:

(1) Enactment and enforcement of the WPT (section 5.2);
(2) WPT paid prior to December 21, 2006 (section 5.3);

(3) Enactment and enforcement of the FWF and imposition of quotas
(section 5.4);

(4) 2001 Stability Agreement negotiations (section 5.5);
(5) Safe Custody and Sale Agreement (section 5.6);

(6) Delay in the approval of a Bumbat project and conversion of licenses
(New Facts") (section 5.7); and

(7) Events of December 2, 2008 and thereafter (section 5.8).

However, prior to addressing the foregoing Claimants' claims and Respondent's
counterclaims, the Tribunal will, as a preliminary matter, expose the Parties' views of the
interpretation of Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty and briefly express its own views on this
subject.

INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLES 2 AND 3 OF THE TREATY
5.1.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Claimants submit that the Treaty, including Articles 2 and 3 thereof, is to be interpreted
broadly, in view, inter alia, of the object and purpose of the Treaty, ie. to create
favourable conditions for investment as stated in the preamble of the Treaty!24.
Claimants mention however that even though an expansive interpretation of the Treaty
is warranted, their claims would succeed even on a narrow interpretation thereof.!

More specifically with respect to Article 3(1) of the Treaty, Claimants state that "a review
of the international investment jurisprudence supports an expansive interpretation of
the "fair and equitable" standard in Article 3. In particular the "fair and equitable"
standard requires the host country (i) to protect the investor's reasonable and legitimate
expectations; (ii) to act transparently in its relations with the foreign investor; (iii) to

224 C, SC, 4130-138, C. Reply, $141174-180.

25 C, Reply, 4173.

-42-

provide stability and predictability in its business and legal framework; and (iv) to
provide judicial process that is not so unfair as to amount to a denial of justice".!26

239. Claimants contest Respondent's argument to the effect that FET is limited to the
standard of "non-impairment by discriminatory measures" and submit that Article 3(1)
of the Treaty sets forth two standards (i) fair and equitable treatment (with no
qualification) and (ii) non-impairment of the operation of and disposal with investments
by discriminatory measures:!2”

"L..] the non-impairment of the operation of and_disposal with
investments by discriminatory measures [standard] is included in,
but certainly does not limit, the first one. It is a non-exhaustive
example of conduct prohibited under the general standard of fair
and equitable treatment".!28

240. Claimants thus argue that the FET standard is unqualified and encompasses a series of
discrete principles (including, but not limited to, the protection of legitimate
expectations), as stated by the Rumeli tribunal!29:

"The parties rightly agree that the fair and equitable treatment
standard encompasses inter alia the following concrete principles:

- The State must act in a transparent manner;
- The State is obliged to act in good faith;

- The State's conduct cannot be arbitrary, grossly
unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, or
lacking in due process;

- The State must respect procedural propriety and
due process.

The case law also confirms that to comply with the standard, the
State must respect the investor's reasonable and legitimate
expectations,"!5°

241. In addition, Claimants dispute Respondent's assertion that Claimants' claims fail
because they do not relate to the operation of or disposal with investment:

"(i) Claimants' claims do relate to the operation and disposal of
their investments; (ii) the plain wording of Article 3(1) makes clear
that the qualification requiring that an investment relate to the
"operation of or disposal with" the investment only applies to the
standard of "non-impairment by discriminatory measures," not to
the fair and equitable treatment standard; and (iii) Mongolia's
argument relies on an artificial distinction between direct rights of
shareholders to ownership in the shares and their indirect rights
in the assets of the company—a distinction that tribunals have
resoundingly rejected."131

Finally, Claimants, relying on the MFN clause in Article 3(2) of the Treaty, invoke the
clearly unrestricted FET standards of protection found in Article 2(2)(a) of the US-
Mongolia BIT!22 and Article 3(1) of the Denmark-Mongolia BIT! as well as "the broader
standard of "[non-impairment] by unreasonable and discriminatory measures [of] the
management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion or
disposal of investments," which is found, for example, in the U.S.-Mongolia BIT!" (as
well as in Article 2(2) the Denmark-Mongolia BIT.1!°°

According to Respondent, Claimants misconstrue the treatment standard under the
Treaty as the protections found in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty have to be read
restrictively based on (i) the contra proferentem rule (the applicability of which Claimants
contest as "they do not stand in the shoes of the Russian Federation nor are they parties
to the Treaty"; (ii) the object and purpose of the Treaty [relying on the last
paragraph of the preamble] and the allegedly detrimental impact on Claimants!
investment [Claimants deny both the relevance of this allegation and its truthfulness],197
and (iii) the restrictive wording of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, including the lack of
reference to international law.1°8

Respondent concludes that Article 3(1) contains one single standard of protection (rather
than two as argued by Claimants): fair and equitable treatment limited to non-
impairment by discriminatory measures, which standard is further limited as it extends
only to the operation of and disposal with investments (as opposed to the latter's use
and enjoyment). The result of this narrow definition of FET would be that a "higher bar
is set to establish the reasonableness of investment-backed expectations" 139

According to Respondent, as Claimants, in their quality of shareholders, claim with
respect to the use and enjoyment of their investment (shares), these claims are to be
dismissed as Article 3(1) does not provide protection for the use and enjoyment of an
investment.!40

With respect to the MEN clause, Respondent takes the position that the MFN clause in
the Treaty cannot be invoked by Claimants in order to broaden the protections available
thereunder:

"207.The [MFN] clause by reference to "the treatment,
mentioned under paragraph1 of this Article" is
expressly limited to claims concerning "the operation of
or disposal with investments". This reference excludes
claims that concern the "management", "use",
"maintenance" or "enjoyment" of investments. [...]

208. Claimants' investments in Mongolia are shareholdings.
The MFN clause therefore applies only to the "the
operation of or disposal with" the shares. It does not
apply to their use or enjoyment. The regulations [the
WPT and the FWF] concern the profitability of Golden
East-Mongolia. The profitability of an enterprise
concerns the use and enjoyment of shares in the form of
dividends and other financial benefits flowing from
them. It does not concern the operation or disposal of
the shares. "141

Furthermore, Respondent objects to the application of the MFN clause on the basis of (i)
the exclusion regarding double taxation treaties and other agreements regarding
taxation found in Article 3(4) of the Treaty (especially given the fact that Russia adopted
a similar position in another arbitration) and (ii) the impossibility to use the MFN clause
in order to import the preambles, which in turn state the object and purpose of a given
treaty, from other treaties (which Claimants do by relying on investments awards
rendered under bilateral investment treaties containing preambles different from those
found in the Treaty).142

With respect to the alleged applicability of the MFN clause to the "operation of or
disposal with investments" only, Claimants argue that such an interpretation would
defeat the very purpose of an MEN clause, i.e. to harmonize "the benefits that Mongolia

other investment treaties."""4

Claimants also submit that (i) the taxation-related exclusion raised by Respondent is not
applicable as Claimants do not attempt to invoke the benefits of a taxation-related treaty
but rather those of other bilateral investment treaties and (ii) the position adopted by
Russia in another arbitration with respect to this issue is irrelevant. Furthermore,
Claimants add that they do not use the MEN clause to import the preambles from other
treaties but rather rely on the various case law cited in their submissions, as the awards
cited are persuasive and the issues analyzed therein are relevant for the Tribunal's
analysis.45

5.1.2. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

To use Respondent's words, "the Treaty is to be neutrally read according to its ordinary
meaning and context"!*, all in accordance with the terms of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties.

Applying that rule, the Tribunal cannot share Respondent's conclusion about the
interpretation of Article 3(1).

First, the Tribunal does not agree that Article 3(1) contains a single standard of
protection, i.e. fair and equitable treatment limited to non-impairment by discriminatory
measures. Such a reading flies in the face of the plain text of Article 3(1) which accords
"investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and activities associated with
investments fair and equitable regime that excludes the application of measures of a
discriminatory character that might impair the operation of or disposal with
investments".

In the Tribunal's opinion, it is wrong to read the last exclusion as if it were restricting the
definition of fair and equitable treatment. The Tribunal has found persuasive the
arguments presented by Claimants in that regard. That expression, in the present case,
cannot be interpreted as being limited to the protection of legitimate expectations and
non-discrimination but covers a number of other principles which have been mentioned
in a number of arbitral awards. The Rumeli award"’, for example, lists the following
principles to be applied: transparency, good faith, conduct that cannot be arbitrary,
grossly unfair, unjust, idiosyncratic, discriminatory, lacking in due process or
procedural propriety and respect of the investor's reasonable and _ legitimate
expectations.

Second, the Tribunal equally disagrees with Respondent's interpretation to the effect that
the FET is limited to "the operation and disposal with investments" as opposed to its use
and enjoyment and that a restrictive interpretation should be given to those words. In
any event, as will be seen later in this Award, any of the claims made by Claimants
could be brought under "the operation of and disposal with investments" but, even more
importantly, the MFN clause of the Treaty allows for the integration into it of the
broader provisions contained in the U.S. Mongolia BIT and the Denmark-Mongolia BIT.
As this issue has arisen mainly in connection with the SCSA, the Tribunal will discuss
this matter more extensively in the section on that Agreement.

This being said, the Tribunal will consider the interpretation of the Treaty in the context
of the specific claims made by Claimants.

ENACTMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF THE WINDFALL PROFIT TAX
5.2.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

Claimants allege that by enacting and enforcing the WPT, Respondent violated several
treatment standards set forth in Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty ("Treatment Claims") and
the non-expropriation provision set forth in Article 4 of the Treaty (‘Expropriation
Claims"). The arguments invoked by the Parties in support of these two categories of
claims are summarized separately below.

5.2.1.1 Treatment Claims

Claimants summarize the key elements of the factual predicate of the WPT-related
treatment claims and the WPT's characteristics as follows:

"84. Mongolia offers no credible explanation—still less actual
evidence —to justify the unprecedented haste with which the
WPT was adopted. Nor does Mongolia offer any explanation
of what consideration was given to the most critical aspects
of the WPT. Indeed, the evidence before the Tribunal
suggests that there was none. And the predictable happened:
The WPT rendered Mongolia's mining taxation system in
discord with international standards, shook investor
confidence in the stability and transparency of Mongolia's
legislative environment, and subjected Mongolia to broad
criticism internationally. Under the circumstances,
Mongolia's tepid defense of the WPT is both telling and
understandable. [...]

195. The most important factual characteristics of the WPT are
undisputed. [...]

(a) the Mongolian Cabinet repeatedly proposed to repeal
the WPT as inconsistent with international standards
and with the need to develop the State economy;

(h)

(i)

258. Based on the foregoing, Claimants argue that, by enacting and enforcing the WPT,
Respondent breached Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty and customary international law:149

(1) Article 2: The WPT violates the "full legal protection and security" standard as
well as Respondent's obligation to encourage Russian investments because the
WPT undermined "the previously stable and secure investment gold-mining
climate [and] devalued the advantages granted to foreign investors in the mining

-47-

production of gold in Mongolia fell sharply following
the introduction of the WPT;

the Mongolian Parliament adopted the WPT in less than
one week, without any consultations with the
Mongolian mining industry and without any analysis of
the law's potential impact on the mining industry and
the Mongolian budget;

the key parameters of the WPT were set without any
contemporaneous justification whatsoever;

the WPT on gold does not include any mechanism that
would account for actual production costs and their
escalation;

the WPT now taxes not only GEM's profits, but also a
part of its production and other costs, including certain
other tax costs;

the WPT only applies to the producers of gold and
copper and leaves intact potential windfall profits of
other industries, including the producers of crude oil;

copper producers receive much more favorable
treatment under the WPT because the tax does not
apply to their costs of smelting, extraction, and
production of concentrate and guarantees that 100%
profit over their operating costs will not be subject to the
tax; and

the WPT is not levied against the largest producer of
gold in Mongolia, Canadian owned Boroo Gold. "48

framework;153

Article 3(1): The WPT violates the "non-impairment" standard as it is (i)
discriminatory; (ii) arbitrary 155 and (iii) unreasonable!®. These violations of the
"non-impairment" standard also constitute violations of the FET standard as
these two standards overlap;1*”

Article 3(2): The WPT violates the national and most favored nation treatments
as it discriminates against Claimants in favor of (i) Mongolian companies active
in the mining and extraction of natural resources such as crude oil (cross-sectoral
discrimination) and copper (discrimination between gold and copper) and (ii)
Canadian-owned Boroo Gold, against which Respondent does not enforce the
WPT (discrimination between foreign gold producers of different
nationalities).58 The MEN and national treatments being part of the regime set
forth in Article 3(1), these violations also constitute violations of the "non-
impairment" and FET standards; and

Customary international law: The WPT is not in compliance with customary
international law as it violates the international minimum standard of treatment
as well as all of the foregoing obligations (if customary international law is
coextensive with the Treaty).16

Taking issue with the various facets of the FET and "non-impairment" standards invoked
by Claimants (which, as more fully explained below, Respondent believes to be either
duplicative of the FET and non-discrimination standards or outright alien to the Treaty),
Respondent denies having violated any provision of the Treaty, including Articles 2 and
3 thereof, as well as any principle of customary international law.

The Sections below contain a summary of Respondent's defenses against the various
facets of the Treatment Claims summarized above.

5.

 

1 Legitimate Expectations and Predictability of Business and
Legal Framework

With respect to both the WPT and the FWF, Respondent relies on its broad regulatory
powers regarding taxation and immigration, two areas which are "traditionally the most
exacting of investor expectations" and, thus, are "subject to a high requirement of
reasonableness with respect to an investor's expectations".16!

Respondent argues that Claimants’ failure to engage in any due diligence in Mongolia
prior to making their investment implies an assumption of risk by Claimants and entails
that they could not have any reasonable expectations with respect to their investment
which would in turn deprive them of any protection under Article 3(1).12

Respondent also submits that even if Claimants would have engaged in sufficient due
diligence, their claims would still fail as it is unreasonable to expect that Mongolia, a
social market economy in transition, would not change its tax and employment laws.
Respondent further stresses that at the time the investment was made in 1997, the price
of an ounce of gold was approximately USD 320 per ounce and that a reasonable
investor would not have made an investment decision on the basis of a potential gold
prices above USD 500 in 2006, but would have rather considered such prices to be a
windfall.1

Respondent also asserts that (i) Mongolia's WPT law is not without precedent and was
modeled on a Russian windfall tax on crude oil exports;!®4 (ii) WPT is not inconsistent
with international standards'® and (iii) Mongolia had a rational basis to enact the
WPT. 166

Respondent raises the same defenses against Claimants’ arguments in relation to the
predictability of the business and legal framework.1”

standards as well as the national and MEN treatments), Respondent raises the following
defenses (presented by type of discrimination):

(1)

All types of discrimination

The WPT is applied with regard to all investors in the Mongolian gold sector
regardless of their nationality.1®

Discrimination protections concern disparate treatment on account of nationality
only (Feldman'©, Champion Trading!”). The WPT is applied with regard to all
investors in the Mongolian gold sector regardless of their nationality, including
Mongolian gold producers, and, thus, Mongolia does not discriminate against
Russian investors [lack of direct or implied animus against Russian investors].
"[...] Claimants do not allege that their Russian nationality has anything to do
with the treatment they received. To the extent that Claimants make any claims
on account of nationality, Claimants generically allege that the law was generally
directed against foreign investors [...]!7!

Respondent challenges Claimants' factual allegations regarding the animus
against foreign investors and, relying on PSEG!”, states that "a disparate impact
of a government measure on an industry sector with significant foreign
participation does suffice to prove discrimination.""3

Cross-sectoral discrimination
The WPT reasonably applies to key economic sectors.!74

far more pronounced role than they do in investor-state
arbitrations. The WTO/GATT framework makes a comparison of
like products and defines such products as products which are

"directly competitive or substitutable."1”6

 

2.2. The Occidental case was decided on the basis of the specific wording of the
underlying national treatment provision.

With respect to cross-sectoral discrimination, Respondent submits that
Claimants! reliance on Occidental v. Ecuador'”’ is improper as that case was
adjudicated on the basis of a national treatment provision (namely Article II(1) of
the U.S.-Ecuador BIT) broader than the national treatment provision of the
Treaty (Article 3(2) of the Treaty) and not on the basis of the non-discrimination
provision (Article II(3)(b) of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT).178

Further, the Occidental tribunal relied on the term "in like situations" found in the
applicable national treatment provision (Article II(1) of the U.S.-Ecuador BIT)
whereas such term is not part of the Treaty.

"114. [...]the Occidental analysis construes the term "in like
situations" in the national treatment protection of the
U.S.-Ecuador BIT —missing from the Russia-Mongolia
BIT—as a technical term. [...]

115. .[...] The Occidental tribunal justified its cross-sector
analysis in the national treatment context by expressly
distinguishing prevalent WIO/GATT jurisprudence on
national treatment exactly because the BIT used "in like
situations" rather than "like products", thus implicitly
acknowledging the relevant of the WTO/GATT
approach in situations not involving such distinctive
treaty language.

116. The approach of Occidental is [...] inapplicable in
connection with the national treatment under the
Russian-Mongolia BIT. The BIT in this arbitration does
not use the term "in like situations" in the national
treatment provision. The BIT accordingly does not allow
for a derogation from the narrower and more sensible
market definition set out in the WTO context [based on a
comparison of like products and defining such products

as products which are "directly competitive or

2.3. The Occidental case has not been followed by investment jurisprudence.

Respondent further argues!8? that the Occidental national treatment standard
analysis has not been followed in Champion Trading'®! and Sempra.182

2.4. Even if the Occidental case were applicable, the comparator is not appropriate

"Mongolia had a rational basis to apply the Windfall Profits Tax to gold and
copper mining but not to other sectors".1%>

Even if the principle set out in Occidental v. Ecuador were applicable, the industry
chosen by Claimants, i.e. oil extraction, would be inappropriate as Mongolia
produces very small quantities of that commodity and imports most of it.184

Respondent submits that Claimants’ Counsel stated at the Hearing that the
Occidental tribunal considered measures relating to oil in connection with "other
products" that were "Ecuador's major export goods". Claimants have never
argued that oil is a "major export" of Mongolia. In fact, Mongolia is an importer
of oil, not an exporter.185

Respondent further argues that:

121. The mining and petroleum industries have a completely
different history in Mongolia. Mongolian mining companies
had a long benefit of record low tax and royalty rates. Given
the state of the Mongolian mining industries, companies in
that sector actually could take advantage of these rates and
sell significant amounts of gold and copper with such a low
regulatory exposure. The same is not true for the petroleum
industry. There is thus a rational basis for a correction in the
gold and copper sector that is entirely lacking in the

Discrimination between copper and gold.
The WPT reasonably distinguishes between gold and copper mining.18”

Respondent alleges that (1) the comparison with copper is improper (as it is not a
"like product");188 (2) different treatment of Erdenet, the only meaningful copper
producer, and gold producers is reasonable and based on differences in
transparency, size and sophistication and the desire to encourage the building of
a copper smelting facility in Mongolia!8° and (3) "providing a flexible cost
formula [as it is the case for copper] for the setting of gold prices would have
invited gold miners artificially to inflate costs to such a degree as to avoid paying
the tax".199

With respect to Erdenet, a copper producer, Respondent submits there is no
evidence of discrimination against Russian investors (Russia and Mongolia being
respectively 49% and 51% shareholders of Erdenet, which is subject to the WPT)
and that "given the differences in cost structures and transparency inherent in
dealing with an enterprise of the size and sophistication of Erdenet as compared
to Golden East-Mongolia, Erdenet does not make for an adequate tertium
comparationis for purposes of establishing whether companies in the copper
industry or the gold industry are treated disparately.1"

Discrimination between GEM and Boroo Gold

This claim is addressed in the "2001 Stability Agreements Negotiations Claims"

Claimants challenge the foregoing defenses to the discrimination claims as follows (in

prompted by a popular animus against foreign investors as reported by
Mongolian media."!%

In any event, Claimants, relying on Occidental v. Ecuador, argue that such a
discriminatory intent is not required to establish discrimination and that "the
actual impact of a measure on the investment is the determining factor to
ascertain whether discrimination occurred".1

With respect to the actual impact of the WPT on Claimants! investment,
Claimants stress that the WPT has been disproportionately applied to GEM. For
instance, Claimants allege that GEM's USD 23 million payment in 2007
represented 80-85% of Mongolia's total WPT income and so despite the fact that
GEM has never made up more than 25% of the total gold production in
Mongolia. The 80-85% figure would have been even higher (89-93%) if GEM had
paid the additional USD 31 million that were due for other sales in 2007.15

Claimants further submit that the applicability of the WPT to Mongolian gold
producers does not constitute a defense and that a similar argument was rejected
by the Occidental v. Ecuador tribunal.1%

Cross-sectoral discrimination

Claimants argue that Occidental v. Ecuador'%’ is applicable in the present case as
Article 3(2) of the Treaty is in fact broader than Article II(1) of the U.S.-Ecuador
BIT (the latter, contrary to the former, referring to treatment "in like situations").

Further, Claimants are of the view that "the small volume of the [Mongolian] oil
production does nothing to explain why Mongolian oil producers can keep their
windfall profits while producers of gold must forfeit 68% of them."8

Claimants further submit that the applicability of the WPT to Mongolian gold
producers does not constitute a defense to the cross-industry discrimination
claim and that a similar argument was rejected by the Occidental v. Ecuador
tribunal.1

Claimants reply that Respondent's reference to Russia's partial ownership of
Erdenet is irrelevant in that context as "Mongolia discriminates against GEM and
other gold producers not only when compared with [the producers of other
natural resources, such as crude oil], but also when compared to Erdenet and
other copper producers because the WPT on gold sales is calculated differently
than the WPT is calculated on copper sales".2°

With respect to Respondent's argument regarding the distinction between
Erdenet and GEM, Claimants point out that the only real difference between
Erdenet and GEM is their size (which is irrelevant for the purpose of the
discrimination argument) and that the differences between two companies, as
opposed to the differences between two industries, are irrelevant per se.
Claimants add that as a factual matter, "there are no major differences between
Mongolian copper producing and gold producing companies in their
transparency and sophistication - either generally or specifically between
Erdenet and GEM",

If evidence of discriminatory intent is required, Claimants submit that
Respondent had same as "the WPT treats copper sales differently than the gold
sales on the very face of the legislation itself"202.

In response to Respondent's assertions regarding systematic cost inflation by
gold producers, Claimants reply that (1) "Mongolia's ex post facto argument that
gold-miners are categorically dishonest (as opposed to copper miners) is
disingenuous. Mongolia imposes other taxes [on gold and copper miners, such as
the corporate income tax] without making any such distinction" and (2) "the
factual predicate for this assertion is a statement in the World Bank discussion
paper about small scale [Ninja] miners, [which has] nothing to do with reporting
costs, and the practices of Ninja miners are hardly applicable to major gold
mining companies;"2%

268. In its Rejoinder, Respondent submits that legislative processes are not within the scope
of any transparency conception as discussed by the international investment tribunals”
but sill raises the following defenses regarding the transparency claim:2%

(1) "[T]he pre-2006 taxation and royalty regime governing gold
mining in Mongolia was heavily imbalanced in favor the
mining companies and did not allow Mongolia to receive the
benefit of its natural resources, as had been recognized by
international authorities and heavily discussed within
Mongolia". This regime allowed GEM to reap "more than a
quarter-billion U.S. dollars with a minimal, and _ still
unsubstantiated, investment. "

(2) Vigorous discussions [in the Mongolian Parliament, the
media and the Mongolian population at large] regarding
changes to Mongolia's tax laws took place for quite some
time prior to enactment of the Windfall Profits Tax in 2006.

(3) Skyrocketing gold prices led to further public discussions
regarding changes to the tax regime. When gold prices began
to skyrocket in earnest in late 2005 and early 2006,
Mongolian Parliamentarians began to discuss plans for a
change in the revenue structure from the mining industry
with constituents leading to drafts of the WPT being
discussed as early as April 2006 in the media.

(4) Interested persons had the ability to comment on the WPT
before its passage. Various NGOs and international groups,
including the World Bank, analyzed and commented on
drafts of the WPT before its passage and lobbied against its
adoption, with the Mongolian mining sector taking an active
role for months in resisting changes to the tax laws.

(5) The legislative process governing the passage of the WPT
was consistent with Mongolian law and practice. The
passage of the WPT followed constitutional requirements of
parliamentary process and was consistent with Mongolian
legislative practice.

(6) Discussions regarding the mining tax regime continued in
Mongolia, resulting in the "effective repeal" of the WPT.
After passage of the WPT, public discourse and analysis of

the tax regime continued in Mongolia, leading to the
eventual change of the base price of gold for the application
of the WPT from USD 500 to USD 850. Claimants have called
this an "effective repeal" of the WPT.

Respondent's defense to the transparency claim is articulated as follows:

(1)

(7)

Transparency relates to the procedure of the implementation [as opposed to
enactment] of laws and regulations, not to whether a law was passed in "six
days" (which in any event is not correct);?° "[emphasis in the original]

Claimants conception of transparency defies common sense as it elevates form
over substance and does not protect investors from any real impairment of their
investment;207

The WPT followed years of public debate about changing the 1997 Mining
Law;208

The WPT was passed in conformity with Mongolian legislative practice;

The debate in Mongolia regarding the management of its natural resources
continued after the passage of the WPT;2!0

Claimants' allegations regarding the process by which the WPT was considered
and passed show that Claimants were not engaged participants in the mining
sector;2!! and

Claimants' conception of transparency rests on an imagined standard that it not
consistently met in any democratic society.2!2

Adding that the Parliament had a rational basis to enact the WPT and acted after due
deliberation and detailed engagement of the underlying issues, Respondent invokes the
same defenses in the context of the non-arbitrariness and reasonableness standards.2!3

5.2.1.1.4 Customary international law

As seen above, Respondent contests the relevancy of any standard of protection save a
restrictive FET protection and the protection against discrimination.2!4

Respondent in fact argues that the lack of reference to customary international law in
Article 3(1) of the Treaty is indicative of the very limited scope of the protections
granted, which protections are below the customary international law standard.2!5

Respondent submits that Claimants! reliance on the press release of the Mongolian
Government2!6 stating that the WPT should be repealed in order to harmonize the tax
burden with international standards is inappropriate as the press release was not
referring to the international minimum standard of treatment and, in any event, it does
not amount to a legal conclusion.2!”

In its Reply2!8, Claimants state that whether the press release?!9 contains a legal
conclusion or not is irrelevant.22°

Claimants further opine that the WPT is not in compliance with customary international
law not only because it violates the international minimum standard of treatment but
also, on the assumption that the customary international law is coextensive with the
Treaty, because it violates the Treaty protections.22!

As to the scope of protection granted by the Treaty, Claimants state that (i) "a treaty can
be interpreted to dispense of important principles of customary international law only if
it clearly states such an intention"22 (which is not the case of the Treaty) and (ii) a BIT
containing an MFN clause cannot, by definition, provide for a standard of treatment
below the international minimum standard.”

In response to the foregoing, Respondent argues™4 that Claimants have not adduced
evidence of the existence of a customary international law rule with respect to taxes”.

Relying on the dissenting opinion of Judge Schwebel in ELSI26, Respondent contests
that the minimum international standard of treatment is part of customary international
law.27

5.2.1.1.5 Full Protection and Security and Duty to Encourage
Investments

As to the full protection and security standard and the duty to encourage investments,
set forth in Article 2 of the Treaty, Respondent argues that this standard amounts to a
reiteration of fair and equitable treatment and that any claims based thereon fail for the
reasons similar to those advanced with respect to the claims based on the fair and
equitable treatment. Respondent further contends that the WPT did not remove the
security and the legal protection from Claimants.28

Claimants disagree with this statement and argue that the failure to encourage Russian
investment in Mongolia amounts to an independent violation of Article 2 of the Treaty
as the latter imposes an objective requirement of stability, certainty and foreseeability
(the objective character of protection becomes all the more important if one accepts
Respondent's incorrect assertion to the effect that the FET standard of the Treaty
imposes a subjective standard reduced to the protection of Claimants' specific
expectations that does not include the requirement of a stable and predictable business
and legal framework for Claimants' investment.”

5.2.1.2 Expropriation Claims

Claimants argue that, by enacting and enforcing the WPT, Respondent also breached
Article 4 of the Treaty.23°

According to Claimants, Article 4 of the Treaty must be interpreted in view of the MFN
clause in Article 3(2) of the Treaty. The MFN clause is applicable to expropriation and
nationalization because these are measures that "impair" the operation of and disposal
with investments within the meaning of Article 3(1) of the Treaty. Thus, Claimants
invoke, among others, the benefit of Article V of the Netherlands-Mongolia BIT that
protects against any direct or indirect deprivation of investments.23!

With respect to their expropriations claims, Claimants rely on the test set forth in EnCana
Corporation v. Ecuador:232

"It is well settled that taxation is a specific category of measures
for the purposes of expropriation. This is because it relates to a
universal State prerogative to create a new legal liability on a class
of persons to pay money to the government in respect of some
defined class of transactions. By definition, taxation is not
accompanied by the payment of any compensation—and,
therefore, under traditional legal principals would ipso facto be
illegal. Therefore, international law sets forth a specific test for the
assessment whether tax measures are expropriatory: a tax is an
unlawful deprivation if it is "extraordinary, punitive in amount or
arbitrary in its incidence." The Windfall Profit Tax constitutes an
illegal deprivation because it is all of these things."23 [emphasis
added]

 

Claimants argue that the WPT meets the foregoing test and, thus, is expropriatory
because it is (the criteria below being disjunctive):

(1)

extraordinary as (1) it does not conform to international standards; (2) it does not
account for production costs; (3) it caused an unprecedented deterioration of the
legal framework applicable to the Mongolian gold-mining industry; (4) it is
unprecedented in the relatively long history of taxation in Mongolia and (5) it
had an extraordinary detrimental impact on non-exempt gold-mining companies
in Mongolia, causing, inter alia, an important fall in the production of gold;75

punitive in amount as (1) it fails as a systemic response to any problems invoked
by Mongolia because the latter discharged from the tax its largest potential
source of revenue, Boroo Gold, making GEM a scapegoat and (2) if enforced, the
WPT would drive GEM out of business (the WPT allegedly drove out of business
several other gold producers);6

arbitrary and discriminatory in its incidence because (1) it is not based on any
rational decision making or a reasoned judgment that would involve balancing
Mongolia's interest against the burden being imposed on Claimants (which
makes the WPT arbitrary) and (2) it is discriminatory for the reasons identical to
those invoked in the context of the Treatment claims.”

Claimants also argue that the WPT is not in the public interest because (1) Mongolia
failed to allege any principled public interest other than the increase of its tax revenues,

which is not sufficient; (2) gold production and revenue intake decreased as a result of
the WPT and (3) the largest potential source of revenue (Boroo Gold) was forgone.238

Respondent is of the view that Claimants failed to make out the expropriation claims
and argues, relying on the test set forth in the LG&E case”? that the WPT does not
constitute indirect expropriation (as would be the case of most tax laws, if the Claimants
analysis were accepted) because:

(1) it did not deprive Claimants of essentially the entire benefit of their investment
(there was no substantial impact translating into a loss of control over the
investment);

(2) it was not a disproportionate exercise of State power, taking into account the

need the WPT was addressing;”#! and
(3) it is not a permanent measure.

Respondent further takes the position that even on the basis of the EnCana test, the
WPT is not expropriatory because:23

(1) the WPT applies to future revenues (the EnCana tribunal making a distinction
between prospective and retroactive measures);7#4

(2) the WPT is not punitive as (i) Claimants, having presented distorted financial
picture, failed to establish the alleged detrimental impact of the WPT on GEM
and (ii) Boroo Gold is not paying the WPT on the basis of a stability agreement
which was available to GEM had it accepted to make additional (future)
investments;245

(3) the WPT is not extraordinary as (i) Claimants failed to adduce any credible
evidence establishing same and (ii) the WPT was modeled on the Russian crude
oil exports tax and is similar to the U.S. windfall tax that was in place for 8
years;24#6

(4) the WPT is not arbitrary as Mongolia had a rational basis for enacting the WPT as
set forth in the Treatment Claims section above.24”

Claimants submit that all the three defenses (see 4283 above) raised by Respondent in its
Defense are ill-founded.28

1. Loss of control and object of expropriation

First, Claimants assert that "loss of control" is not an appropriate test in the tax context’.
Relying on Pope & Talbot?°, CME?! , Tecmed?52 and EnCana?53, Claimants argue that the
finding of a loss of control is not a sine qua non of expropriation but is merely one of the
possible manifestations of the significant interference requirement and that any
government interference resulting in less than full ownership and control of the
investment would support a finding of expropriation.4

Claimants also opine that even if the Tribunal concludes that the "loss of control" is a sine
qua non criterion for a finding of expropriation and that Respondent did not expropriate
Claimants' entire investment, Respondent has nonetheless expropriated parts of their
investments. Relying on a series of investment awards which purportedly recognized
that an expropriation claim stands even when only a part of the investment is
expropriated, Claimants argue as follows:

"459.In line with the above authorities, Mongolia
expropriated GEM's (i) right to conduct business
embodied in its gold-mining licenses, (ii) financial
means, and (iii) right to returns. [Claimants invoke the
benefit of the MFN clause and Art. 2(2) of the Austria-
Mongolia BIT which expressly includes the returns]. More
specifically, although the WPT does not take all of
GEM's returns, it has unquestionably taken so much as
to push GEM to the precipice of insolvency. If Mongolia
enforced the WPT against GEM, GEM would not be left
with enough funds to continue its gold-mining business.
[...] it does not matter that Mongolia has not taken, for
example, GEM's machinery. So long as GEM cannot use
its machinery to mine gold in a profitable way, it is not

better off having the machinery than it would be if
Mongolia had taken it.

460. In any event, even if Mongolia's expropriation has been
only partial thus far, it is only because of the temporary
lack of the enforcement of the WPT][...]. If the WPT was
enforced, it would spell imminent bankruptcy for GEM.
And Mongolia's expropriation would then be
complete."*5

290. Respondent disputes that either GEM's mining licenses or the returns on investment
constitute an "investment" within the definition of the Treaty25¢ and argues that in any
event none of the alleged Claimants' investments has been expropriated, save for the fact
that the "returns on investments" were affected:

"228. In any event, Mongolia notes that Claimants have failed to
establish that any of these rights or assets could have been
expropriated by the Windfall Profits Tax. All of these rights
and assets were not affected by the Windfall Profits Tax.
(Claimants still own GEM's shares. GEM is still the holder of
its licenses to explore and exploit mine reserves in Mongolia.
Claimants are still in control of GEM.) Only "income"
derived from these rights and assets, itself independently
defined in the treaty, has been affected by it. Income,
however, is not the subject matter of an investment claim.
Only the investment is."257

291. With respect to the "loss of control" criterion, Respondent replies that "[w]hatever
specific indicia have been consulted by investment tribunals, the constant in all these
decisions is that measures tantamount to expropriation must rise to the level of an
interference equivalent to expropriation [...].a less complete deprivation does not qualify
as expropriation."*8 [emphasis in the original] In this regard, Respondent argues that the
WPT does not meet the test because:

(1) Claimants can still run a profitable business notwithstanding the WPT (in 2008,
GEM is alleged to have generated USD 35 million even accounting for the WPT),
which in any event has been amended in December 2008, raising the base price to
USD 850,259

(2) Claimants still have control over their investments and no Pope & Talbot
expropriation indicia are present in the circumstances.21

(3) Claimants failed to show causation as GEM's financial statements (not in
accordance with IFRS) present a distorted financial picture which makes it
impossible to determine what impact the WPT really had on GEM.?62

Regarding the partial expropriation, Respondent observes that this claim is ill-founded,
the WPT not being expropriatory (see above) with respect to the entirety of Claimants’
investments or, by necessary implication, parts thereof. Respondent further reiterates
that Claimants failed to identify specific asset or property which did not constitute the
entirety of their investment and that Claimants’ arguments in relation to GEM's licenses
or the returns on investments amount to a statement that a lesser effect in their
investments should be viewed as partial expropriation, which statement is ill-founded in
law.263

2. Permanency

Relying on Wena Hotels?! and Middle East, Claimants argue that temporary
deprivations also qualify for a finding of expropriation.

Respondent submits that the permanency of a measure is a relevant criterion in
circumstances where the investor has never been deprived on its investment, as is the
case with Claimants.26”

3. Proportionality

Assuming that the funds generated by the WPT are used for some laudatory goal (as
Respondent alleges), Claimants submit that such a fact would not legitimize an
expropriation? and especially an expropriation without compensation.2

5.2.1.3 Causation

296. As a general defense to Claimants' WPT-related claims (both Treatment and
Expropriation Claims)”, Respondent argues in its Rejoinder 27! that "Claimants have not
shown that it was the passage of the WPT [to the exclusion of other factors unrelated to
Respondent] that caused the factual harm to GEM underlying Claimants' claims in this
case." In Respondent's view, GEM's profitability has been significantly affected by
factors other than the WPT:272

(1)

()

Claimants' assertion that GEM made no money in 2008 despite mining over
USD 65 million in gold and paying no WPT or foreign worker fee calls into
question GEM's accounting and operations;2?

The hundreds of non arm-length's, related party transactions entered into after
the passage of the WPT has affected the profitability of GEM;?74

Claimants violated the Tribunal's orders by transferring assets out of Mongolia
when the TRO was in force and then claiming that they had no assets to pay
security;?>

Claimants have made cash withdrawals from GEM's accounts of almost
USD 18 million while the TRO and the OIM were in place;2”

Claimants have taken steps to make GEM's costs appear higher than its actual
costs and to prevent an examination by this Tribunal and Mongolia of GEM's
costs.277

297. Claimants address some of the foregoing statements in Appendix 1 to its Reply and state

that:

(1)

There is no evidence of tax fraud:?% (1) prior to this arbitration, Mongolia
repeatedly recognized GEM's tax compliance; (2) Claimants' submissions of
financial information to Mongolia were accurate;*8 (3) the inter-company loans

(3) Claimants have not improperly "siphoned" money out of Mongolia.285
5.2.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

Actions by legislative assemblies are not beyond the reach of bilateral investment
treaties. A State is not immune from claims by foreign investors in connection with
legislation passed by its legislative body, unless a specific exemption is included in the
relevant treaty.

On the other hand, the fact that a democratically elected legislature has passed
legislation that may be considered as ill-conceived, counter-productive and excessively
burdensome does not automatically allow to conclude that a breach of an investment
treaty has occurred. If such were the case, the number of investment treaty claims would
increase by a very large number. Legislative assemblies around the world spend a good
part of their time amending substantive portions of existing laws in order to adjust them
to changing times or to correct serious mistakes that were made at the time of their
adoption. A claim for a breach under an investment treaty has to be proven by claimants
under the specific rules established in that treaty.

The arguments raised by Claimants in the present instance have not convinced the
Tribunal that the adoption of the WPT constituted a breach under Articles 2, 3 or 4 of the
Treaty. The Tribunal will proceed to review the various arguments raised by Claimants
in support of their claims.

5.2.2.1 Claimants' legitimate expectations

The first argument advanced is that the WPT violated Claimants' legitimate
expectations. The Tribunal has dealt earlier with Respondent's defense in Section 4.5 to
the effect that a stability agreement was required in order to challenge the WPT Law and
indicated that the lack of a stability agreement does not strip Claimants of the
protections available under the Treaty.

This being said, foreign investors are acutely aware that significant modification of
taxation levels represents a serious risk, especially when investing in a country at an
early stage of economic and institutional development. In many instances, they will
obtain the appropriate guarantees in that regard in the form of, for example, stability
agreements which limit or prohibit the possibility of tax increases. As a matter of fact,
GEM attempted, although without success, to obtain such an agreement in 2001, a few
years after Claimants’ initial investment and, in 2002, Vostokneftegaz — a company
controlled by Claimants — did secure a stability agreement on a certain number of taxes.
In the absence of such a stability agreement in favor of GEM, Claimants have not
succeeded in establishing that they had legitimate expectations that they would not be
exposed to significant tax increases in the future.

5.2.2.2 International standards

As to the allegation that the WPT was contrary to international standards, Claimants
have not established the existence of such standards. At best, they have succeeded in
demonstrating that such legislation went beyond the taxation levels in application at the
time in most countries of the world but, even in such a case, this is not enough to
establish by itself breaches of FET under the Treaty. The fact that a particular country
happens to have, at a particular time, the highest taxation level affecting a certain
industry does not automatically mean that there has been a breach of a BIT. In support
of their argument, Claimants rely on a press release issued by Mongolia in May 2008
when it proposed to abolish the WPT and to replace it with an increase in royalty
payments. At that time, the Government stated that one of the purposes of the
amendments was to harmonize "the royalty payments with the international standards".
It is a big stretch to read into that statement an admission by Mongolia that it was
previously breaching the international minimum standard of treatment under
international law, when it was merely saying that it was attempting to align its taxation
regime of mining companies with that of other countries.

5.2.2.3 Lack of transparency

The third argument is to the effect that the enactment and application of the WPT were
non-transparent. In particular, it is said, the law was adopted in less than one week and
no consultation took place with the industry. First of all, no evidence has been
introduced to the effect that the Great Khural would have acted in contravention of any
of its own rules in the adoption of the WPT Law. The short time it took to adopt the
WPT Law and the alleged lack of consultation cannot either be used in support of an
allegation of a breach of the Treaty. Legislative assemblies in all countries regularly
adopt legislation within a very short time and, sometimes, without debates, especially if
there is urgency and there is unanimity of views among parliamentarians. The recent
worldwide economic crisis has led to such steps adopted by legislative assemblies in all
kinds of democratic countries. In the present instance, Claimants themselves recognize
that the legislation was debated in the Great Khural and that a significant number of its
members, including members of the Government, were opposed to this legislative
measure. No evidence has been introduced to the effect that, under the Mongolian
Constitution or under the rules of the Great Khural, consultation with affected sectors or

meaningful analysis of the implications of proposed legislation is required before its
adoption.

5.2.2.4 Predictability of the business and legal framework

The fourth argument under the FET standard is that the WPT altered the predictability
of the business and legal framework because of its excessive burden. There is no doubt
that the WPT represented a radical change in the taxation of the gold mining industry in
Mongolia and that it had a severe negative impact upon the industry as a whole and
upon GEM in particular. But this does not mean that the enactment of such legislation
was contrary to the Treaty. An investor, without an agreement which limits or prohibits
the possibility of tax increases,, should not be surprised to be hit with tax increases in
subsequent years and such an event could not be considered as "unpredictable".
Mongolia is far from being the only country in the world where dramatic unforeseen
increases in the price of certain commodities has led to major changes in taxation
regimes of those commodities. Before concluding that a particular taxation level alters
"the predictability of the business and legal framework" of a country, an international
arbitration tribunal will want to see a clear demonstration that, absent such an
agreement, such increase in taxation constitutes a breach of an international obligation
of that country. The Tribunal is of the view that Claimants have not succeeded in doing
so in the present case.

5.2.2.5 The non-impairment standard

Claimants also argue that the WPT not only violated the FET standard but also the "non-
impairment" standard contained in Article 3 of the Treaty. According to them, the WPT
is discriminatory, arbitrary and unreasonable.

It has to be noted that the "non-impairment" standard does not provide a blanket
protection for investors against any measure that might be adopted by the State. In
support of a broad interpretation of that clause, Claimants invoke the MFN clause
contained at Article 3(2) of the Treaty and make reference to other bilateral investments
treaties signed by Mongolia which contain mentions of "unreasonable or discriminatory
measures" or "unjustified or discriminatory measures". Claimants argue that it is now
settled law that MEN clauses allow a claimant to invoke substantive provisions of other
BITs signed by a State and they assert that the relevant protection guaranteed by other
BITs to which Mongolia is a party confirm a broad interpretation of Article 3(1) so as to
cover not only discriminatory, but also arbitrary and unreasonable measures.

Claimants’ claim in this regard is based on an alleged cross-industry and cross-sectoral
discrimination and on the alleged arbitrary and unreasonable character of the WPT.
Even accepting the broad interpretation advanced by Claimants, the Tribunal cannot
conclude that the WPT was discriminatory, arbitrary or unreasonable, for the reasons
mentioned hereunder.

5.2.2.5.1 Cross-sectoral discrimination and cross-industry
discrimination

The discrimination argument takes two forms: (i) the WPT should have equally applied
to other sectors than the mining industry; and (ii) the WPT discriminates between gold
and copper.

As to the first argument, the consolidated statutes of many countries are replete with
fiscal legislation which, whether using tax breaks or direct subsidies, treats various
industries differently from one another. In the specific case of Mongolia, Mongolian oil
production represents a minor sector of the Mongolian economy. Mongolia is a net
importer of oil.28 And there is nothing in the Treaty or in international law which
generally prohibits Mongolia from imposing a tax regime on gold mining which would
be different from other industries. Under such circumstances, there is nothing
permitting to reach the conclusion that the fact that the WPT Law does not apply to such
industry constitutes illegal discrimination under the provisions of the Treaty. Many will
argue that this is not wise economic policy but this does not mean it would constitute a
breach of a BIT, particularly in the area of taxation, in respect of which States jealously
guard their sovereign powers.

As to the second argument, Claimants allege that, by adopting a different taxation
regime for copper, Respondent indulged into discrimination contrary to the Treaty. It is
true that different tax regimes were enacted between copper and gold, even though they
both attained, percentagewise, very significant tax increases; and it might have been
wiser if the Great Khural had adopted similar legislation for both products. But this does
not allow the Tribunal to jump to the conclusion that its failure to do so constitutes a
breach of the Treaty.

In the Tribunal's view, Claimants' reliance on the Occidental case?8’ in support of its two
arguments is inapposite.

First of all, the national-treatment clause contained in that case has a different wording
than the one found in Article 3(2) of the Treaty in the present case. Article II(1) of the
U.S.-Ecuador BIT establishes the obligation to treat investments and associated activities
"on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations to investments or
associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or of nationals or companies of
any third country, whichever is the most favorable". The tribunal in that case, because of
the use of the words "in like situations", differentiated the interpretation to be given to
those words from the words "like products" used in the WIO/GATT which, the tribunal
said, "necessarily relates to competitive and substitutable products". The Treaty in the
present case contains no reference to either "like situations" or "like products", thus
leaving the Tribunal to rely on the general provisions of the Vienna Convention.

Moreover, the Occidental case had to deal with the interpretation of VAT legislation of
general application while the WPT Law deals specifically with two minerals: gold and
copper.

The Tribunal is of the view that, before concluding to discrimination in the present case,
the sectors covered should relate to competitive and substitutable products, an
expression regularly used in WIO/GATT cases. In doing so, the Tribunal is aware of the
differences between the Treaty and the one governing the WTO. It merely states that
such a requirement is a reasonable one to apply when considering allegations of
discrimination. There is nothing in the WPT Law which would lead the Tribunal to
conclude that, by referring to such a standard, there is discrimination in the present
instance either on the basis of a cross-industry (e.g. the petroleum industry) or a gold-
copper comparison. As stated in the Sempra case:88 "(t)here are quite naturally important
differences between the various affected sectors, so it is not surprising that different
solutions might have been or are being sought for each". The different treatment given in
this case to gold and copper compared to other industries or between gold and copper
cannot support a conclusion of discrimination under the Treaty.28?

Moreover, even if the reference to competitive and substitutable products were not
retained as a criterion, the different regimes applied to copper and gold would not
justify the Tribunal to conclude to discriminatory treatment. Respondent has explained
the distinction introduced as relating, for one part, to greater opportunities for tax
evasion existing in the gold mining industry and, for another part, to a desire to see the
proceeds from copper exports to be used for the building of a copper-processing plant in
Mongolia permitting to add value to Mongolian copper production. In addition, as the
Parties have pointed out, copper production in Mongolia was essentially in the hands of
Erdenet, a company 51% controlled by the State of Mongolia and 49% by Russia.?° The
WPT may have been a poor instrument to achieve the objectives of the Great Khural and
the Tribunal has no evidence to the effect that they were in fact achieved. It is not the
role of the Tribunal to weigh the wisdom of legislation, but merely to assess whether
such legislation breaches the Treaty. Claimants have not succeeded in demonstrating
that this was an abusive or irrational decision and that it constituted discriminatory
treatment.

The discrimination argument has also been raised by Claimants in relation with the
stability agreement issued to Boroo Gold in 2000. This matter will be addressed
separately below when dealing with that issue.

288 Sempra Energy International v. The Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/02/16, Award, September 28, 2007,

the tribunal concluded that: "(a)Ithough both kinds of companies operate in the same industry and are subject to
the same kind of rules, there is a significant difference between a company which opts to buy cotton from the
Collection Centers at fixed prices and a company which opts to trade on the free market, whether or not the
company is privately-owned or State-owned or whether the company is national or foreign."

Finally, Claimants argue that the WPT discriminates illegally against them because it
disproportionately applies to GEM. Even accepting Claimants’ statement that GEM’s
WPT payments might have represented up to 89-93% of Mongolia’s total WPT income,
despite the fact that GEM had never made up more than 25% of total gold production in
that country, a major factor in that disproportion results from the fact that even if Boroo
Gold’s production represented in 2006 some 45% of that total,2%! it benefited from a
stability agreement which exempted it from the WPT. Apart from this particular stability
agreement, no evidence had been adduced by Claimants to the effect that the tax burden
imposed upon GEM was different from the one applying to other gold producers in
Mongolia under the WPT.

5.2.2.5.2 Arbitrary and unreasonable measure

The alleged arbitrary and unreasonable characters of the WPT will be considered
together. It has been established that Mongolia is a large producer of gold and that gold
constitutes a very important source of revenue for its Government. It is not surprising
that, when seeing the very large increases that occurred in the price of gold in 2005-2006,
parliamentarians saw such an event as an opportunity for the State to share in the
windfall gains which the gold producers appeared to get. Legislation to that effect was
passed in spite of objections by the Government to some of its content; in fact, as early as
in the Fall of 2006, the Government attempted twice, without success, to reduce the high
level of taxation it contained. In November 2008, the Government succeeded in
convincing the Great Khural to raise from USD 500 to USD 850 the threshold at which
the additional taxes started to bite. There is substantial evidence to show that the WPT
as passed in 2006 had a severe detrimental effect not only upon the industry but also
upon Government's revenues.

Claimants have submitted evidence to the effect that, among others, the World Bank
stated that the WPT legislation had been enacted against its advice. For its part,
Respondent submitted a report of the IMF making the following recommendation: "If
the windfall tax is retained, it should apply only to a limited list of strategic projects for
which the government may choose to take an equity interest; the rate should be reduced
possibly to 55% or less, the base should be adjusted annually by the change in the US
GDP deflator: and the tax should apply to all copper sales".2%

It is clear that the WPT was generally considered excessive, including by some members
of the Great Khural as well as of the Mongolian Government and, from the evidence
submitted, it appears that Mongolia paid a heavy price fiscally and economically
following the adoption of the WPT. But to conclude from this that it was arbitrary and
unreasonable under the terms of the Treaty is a step that the Tribunal is not ready to
take, especially when it comes to dealing with fiscal legislation which on its face is not

targeting Claimants in particular or foreign investors in general. It has to be noted that,
when the WPT was adopted, several other taxes affecting gold companies were reduced
and that even the IMF was ready to endorse a 55% level of taxation, albeit in restricted
circumstances.

5.2.2.6 Duty to encourage investments and full protection and security

Claimants also argue that the WPT violates Article 2 of the Treaty, in that it undermines
the previously stable and secure investment climate in Mongolia and that it discourages
Russians investors to make investments in Mongolia, thereby failing to provide full legal
protection to Claimants’ investments.

Article 2(1) is an enunciation of the general commitment of each Contracting party to
encourage investment and to guarantee "in accordance with its laws and regulations, full
legal protection to investments". The case law and commentators generally agree that
this standard imposes an obligation of vigilance and due diligence upon the
government.2 The AAPL case has approvingly quoted Professor Freeman’s definition
of due diligence:

"The "due diligence" is nothing more nor less than the reasonable
measures of prevention which a well-administered government
could be expected to exercise under similar circumstances."2%

And in the AMT case, the tribunal explained:

"These treatments of protection and security of investment
required by the provisions of the BIT of which AMT is beneficiary
must be in conformity with its applicable national laws and must
not be any less than those recognized by international law. For the
Tribunal, this last requirement is fundamental for the
determination of the responsibility of Zaire. It is thus an objective
obligation which must not be inferior to the minimum standard of
vigilance and of care required by international law."2%

The minimum standard of vigilance and care set by international law comprises a duty
of prevention and a duty of repression. A well-established aspect of the international
standard of treatment is that States must exercise "due diligence" to prevent wrongful
injuries to the person or property of aliens within their territory, and, if they did not
succeed, to exercise at least "due diligence" to punish such injuries.

If a State fails to use due diligence to prevent or punish such injuries, it is responsible for
this omission and is liable for the ensuing damage. It should be emphasized that the

24 American Manufacturing & Trading, Inc. (AMT) v. Democratic Republic of Congo (before referred as Zaire) [hereinafter
AMT vy. Congo], ICSID Case No. ARB/93/1, Award, February 1, 1997; Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL) v.

-73-

obligation to show "due diligence" does not mean that the State has to prevent any
injury whatsoever. Rather, the obligation is generally understood as requiring that the
State take reasonable actions within its power to avoid injury when it is, or should be,
aware that there is a risk of injury. The precise degree of care, of what is "reasonable" or
"due", depends in part on the circumstances.

326. The "legal protection" clause has been raised in a number of BIT cases and has sometime
been interpreted, as a stand-alone clause; as aiming at the physical protection of persons
or assets against illegal actions by third parties. Further, some BITs provide simply for
"full physical protection and security" of investments.27 However, in the present
instance, the Treaty provides clearly for "full legal protection to investments of investors
of the other Contracting Party."2°8 There is therefore no reason to limit the protection
guaranteed to mere physical protection.2%

327. It should be noted, in any case, that in the present instance there is no claim of a negative
action taken by third parties that the State is accused of not having prevented. Further,
the Tribunal has not found, in relation to the WPT, any reason to conclude that there has
been a breach of such a clause or of the fair and equitable treatment through actions of
the State or its agents. As a result, whether it would refer to "an objective requirement of
stability, certainty and foreseeability" as argued by Claimants or to "a subjective
standard reduced to the protection of Claimants’ specific expectations" as argued by
Respondent, the Tribunal cannot conclude that there has been a violation of the "full
legal protection" guaranteed by Article 2 of the Treaty.

5.2.2.7. Customary international law

328. Claimants also argue that the WPT is contrary to customary international law; in
particular, it would be against the public interest and inconsistent with the international
minimum standards. The definition of public interest is one that varies considerably
from one State to another and it is a subject of significant public debate within each
State, specially when controversial legislation or regulation is proposed. This is more a
subject for political debate than arbitral decisions; nowhere in the relevant Treaty is
public interest listed as one of the factors to guide an arbitral tribunal in deciding
whether a breach of it has occurred, except for the mention that an expropriation has to
be shown to have been in the public interest, an issue which is addressed below.

329. Claimants also argue that the Treaty cannot provide for protections below the
international minimum standard, especially in a case like this one where the Treaty
contains a MEN clause incorporating the customary minimum standard that is available

to the investors of any third country. But nowhere do Claimants argue that such
standard would be broader than those contained in the Treaty. The Tribunal having
concluded that the WPT Law did not breach the Treaty, it goes by itself that the WPT
Law is not contrary to the international minimum standard, that standard certainly not
being broader than the FET protection, even applying the MEN clause.

5.2.2.8 Expropriation

Claimants finally argue that Mongolia has breached Article 4 of the Treaty by making
Claimants' investments subject to measures with effects tantamount to nationalization or
expropriation, or indirectly depriving Claimants of their investments without any
compensation. According to Claimants, the WPT would be extraordinary, punitive in
amount, arbitrary and discriminatory and not in the public interest.

In light of what has been said above, the WPT by itself cannot be considered an
expropriatory measure. First of all, Claimants kept the ownership of GEM and
continued to manage its operations after the adoption of the WPT and Mongolia has
made it clear that the conservatory measures it implemented in December 2008 did not
constitute a change of control or ownership. Even at the time of the Hearing, GEM's
ownership and control had not changed.

As to the question whether the measures adopted by Mongolia were tantamount to
expropriation, even though there was no loss of control of GEM, the Tribunal is of the
view that this was not the case, in light of what has been said above. Claimants have
attempted to demonstrate that the burden of the WPT was very heavy upon GEM. This
may well have been the case and the Tribunal has received some evidence to the effect
that a number of gold mines suspended or closed their activities after the adoption of the
WPT and the World Bank, in its Project Appraisal Document mentioned above, noted
that the WPT Law had "resulted in a significant drop in gold sales to the central bank
and a cooling of investment interest"30! but other mines not benefiting from a stability
agreement still managed to continue their operations in spite of the application of the
WPT. GEM itself took certain steps to avoid or reduce the impact of that tax; moreover
the WPT high levels were substantially reduced in 2008 and legislation has been enacted
to the effect that the tax itself will disappear in 2011.

First of all, the Tribunal notes that the quotation from EnCana v. Ecuador cited by
Claimants does not go quite as far as they claim in the paragraph quoted above from
their Statement of Claim. The Tribunal in that case said: "Only if a tax law is
extraordinary, punitive in amount or arbitrary in its incidence would issues of indirect
expropriation be raised. In the present case, in any event, the denial of VAT refunds in
the amount of 10% of transactions associated with oil production and export did not
deny EnCana "in whole or significant part" the benefits of its investment." It is clear

that the Encana Tribunal did not conclude that, if a measure showed the characteristics it
mentioned, this would automatically constitute "an unlawful deprivation," as alleged by
Claimants. It might or it might not, depending on the circumstances of the case.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the written and oral expert evidence submitted by
Mr. B.C. Kaczmarek, for Claimants, and by Mr. M. M .Mulligan, for Respondent,
concerning the impact of the WPT on the financial viability of GEM. The opinions
advanced by the first expert have been hotly contested by the second. But, even under
his own analysis, Mr. Kaczmarek himself stated in his oral testimony*® that "there
would have been a slight profit" in 2006. He then added that, in his view, GEM could not
have made a profit in 2007 because of alleged increased costs of operation. He refers to
an average monthly spot price for gold of USD 697 but the effective price obtained by
GEM is not the average one but the one at the various dates at which GEM actually sold
its gold; without that specific information, it is not possible to determine whether GEM
could or not have made a profit in 2007. Fortunately, that information has been provided
by Claimants themselves** who indicate that, on November 7-8, 2007, GEM sold its gold
mined since February 2007, when the price was USD 832 per ounce (until February, its
gold had been deposited with MongolBank). According to Claimants, if they had paid
the WPT and royalties, they would have ended the year with a loss of slightly less than
USD 1 million, but the scenario presented by Mr. Paushok in that regard does not
appear to include the value of the 1,010,046.29 grams of gold sold by GEM to
MongolBank on December 24, 2007. Be that as it may, and even accepting GEM’s cost
figures for 2007 which were contested by Respondent, a loss of that size for one year is
not a matter leading to the destruction of an ongoing enterprise, specially one with a
long history of strong annual profits and a context of substantial increases in the price of
gold in the subsequent years, as well as legislation enacting a much higher threshold of
USD 850 from November 25, 2008 and legislation in August 2009 repealing the WPT, to
be effective in 2011.

And, in his Second Report of November 28, 2008, Mr. Kaczmarek wrote: "In any event,
the current turbulence in the financial and energy markets makes it difficult to ascertain,
at present, whether or not GEM will be able to survive if the WPT is applied to it."35 No
reference is made to the fact that, on November 25, 2008, the Great Khural had amended
the WPT increasing threshold to USD 850 and to the fact that, for most of 2008, the price
of gold oscillated between USD 800 and USD 1000 an ounce.

In the Tribunal’s view, the expert evidence submitted by Claimants does not support
their thesis that the WPT constituted an expropriatory measure or a measure tantamount
to expropriation.

The Tribunal concluding that there has been no direct or indirect expropriation, the
argument about public interest becomes irrelevant, since it is only in such circumstances
that the Treaty addresses the issue of public interest.

5.2.2.9 Causation

In light of the above, there is no need to address the causation defense raised by
Respondent.

5.2.2.10 Conclusion

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal determines that the enactment and the
enforcement of the WPT do not constitute a breach of Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Treaty.

THE WPT PAID PRIOR TO DECEMBER 21, 2006

Among the claims based on the actions of its tax authorities that Mongolia's judiciary
failed to redress, Claimants submit, as an independent claim, that Mongolia breached
Articles 2 and 3 through the Mongolia's judiciary failure to order the reimbursement of
the WPT paid prior to December 21, 2006. This claim is addressed below.

5.3.1 | ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

On December 13, 2006, Mongolia's Constitutional Court ruled that Articles 4.1.4 and 6.2
of the WPT Law regarding the calculation of the reference price of gold was
unconstitutional, as they referred to the price of gold on the London Metals Exchange
which has no such reference price.

Following that decision, the Great Khural promptly amended the WPT Law, defining
the reference price as a price determined daily by the Central Bank of Mongolia, thereby
adopting the methodology applied by the Chief National Tax Administration of
Mongolia with regard to the WPT before the decision of the Constitutional Court. This
amendment came into effect on December 21, 2006.

In its Statement of Claim, Claimants articulate this head of claim as follows:

"274. [...] shortly after the imposition of the Windfall Profit Tax
[between June 2006 and December 2006], GEM sold a part of
its gold and those sales [sic] and paid MNT 611,927,045
(approx. USD 523,000) of Windfall Profit Tax. In
December 2006, the Constitutional Court stated that a part of
the original wording of the Windfall Profit Tax was
unconstitutional” [because it did not contain a proper reference
for determining the price of gold]. The Mongolian Parliament
cured that deficiency by an amendment of the Windfall

306 C, Reply, 4413.
307 CE-80.

-77-

Profit Tax in December 200638, This amendment, however,
did not have retroactive effect.3”

275. Consequently, GEM sought the return of the Windfall Profit
Tax it had paid in accordance with the unconstitutional
wording of the Windfall Profit Tax. On April 9, 2007, the
court of first instance in the Chingeltey district upheld
GEM's claim in its entirety.4!9 On appeal, however, the
Capital Court reversed the lower court's decision.*? On
November 8, 2007, the decision of the Capital Court was
confirmed by the Supreme Court.3!2

276. Professor Temuulen Bataa explains that the decisions of the
appellate court and the Supreme Court were so egregious as
to constitute another denial of justice claim. The
unconstitutionality of a part of the original wording had
made it impossible for the Tax Authorities to validly levy the
Windfall Profit Tax until the unconstitutional part was
amended.*"3 Hence, the court decisions denying GEM's claim
were grossly erroneous."3!4

344. Claimants conclude that Mongolia committed a denial of justice, breaching its
obligations to grant Claimants' investments fair and equitable treatment (due process)3!5
and full legal protection.31

345. In its Rejoinder?!”, Respondent argues that the Constitutional Court's decision3!8 merely
suspended the application of the WPT from December 13, 2006. Thus, given that the
relevant payment of the WPT occurred on October 2 and 17, 2006, the court's decision
had no impact on the WPT paid before December 13, 2006.19

Furthermore, Respondent contends that GEM was able to determine the amount of the
WPT to be paid and, thus, suffered no prejudice from the lack of reference to a valid
source for determining the price of gold. In addition, Respondent's expert, Professor
Mendsaikhan, suggests (and Respondent endorses) that the lack of reference to a valid
source of the price of gold in the original wording of the WPT Law could have been
remedied by teleological interpretation which would have led to the conclusion that the
price of gold is to be determined according to the market price.520

In their Post-Hearing Brief*?!, Claimants point out that Professor Mendsaikhan admitted
at the Hearing that the original wording of Articles 4.1.4 and 6.2 of the WPT Law did not
include the word "market" at all322 and that Professor Mendsaikhan's interpretation is
contradicted by the decision of the Mongolian Constitutional Court.33

5.3.2. TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

GEM applied to the Mongolian courts to obtain the repayment of the WPT paid prior to
the December 21, 2006 amendment but without success (save for the decision by the
court of first instance in the Chingeltey district). There is nothing in the judicial decisions
rendered by the Capital Court?! and the Supreme Court that would justify this
Tribunal to make a finding of denial of justice regarding decisions which appear to have
been taken with full respect of due process.

Claimants’ claim concerning the WPT paid prior to December 21, 2006 is therefore
dismissed.

ENACTMENT AND ENFORCEMENT OF FOREIGN WORKERS FEE AND
IMPOSITION OF QUOTAS

5.4.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

The requirement to pay the Foreign Workers Fee is set forth in Article 43 of 2006
Minerals Law.26

The factual predicate of Claimants' FWF-related claims is the following:
"224. [...] GEM cannot realistically comply with the 10% quota

because it relies on complex mining machinery and new gold
mining technologies to conduct its business and Mongolian

universities and high schools cannot fully satisfy the need for
qualified specialists. Thus, GEM must pay the extraordinary
fee or hire unqualified Mongolian nationals and sustain a
variety of unacceptable risks, such as risk accidents, damage
to equipment, lower output, and increased production costs.
Either way, the extraordinary fee impairs the operation of
Claimants' investment.

225. Indeed, it appears that Mongolia's ultimate objective was to
increase its fees revenues rather than a genuine attempt to
foster the employment of Mongolian nationals. The lack of
qualified labor in Mongolia is notorious. Fully aware of this,
Mongolia enacted the new _ regulation with the
understanding that the mining companies will simply have
to pay the extraordinary fee. The timing of this dramatic
change in the law confirms its improper purpose. Indeed, it
was enacted within two months of the Windfall Profit Tax—
during a time of increasing taxes and levies against gold-
mining companies,|...].

226. [...] the extraordinary fee and the 10% quota only apply in
the mining industry and apply to all professions within the
industry —even to professions that are not industry-specific,
such as electricians and truck drivers. This is significant
because other industries are subject to more favorable
treatment under the Law "On Export of Workforce and
Import of Foreign Workforce Specialists"[...], adopted on
April 12, 2001.

227. The Import of Workforce Specialists Law requires that
businesses comply with an annual quota of foreign workers
set by the Mongolian agency responsible for labor matters
[...] and pay a fee of two times the minimum monthly salary
for each foreign national. Before the introduction of the 2006
Minerals Law, GEM was subject to the Import of Workforce
Specialists Law. The 2006 Minerals Law thus represented an
alarming and unexpected departure from the legal and
business framework in which GEM had been operating for
nine years."327

352. Claimants argue*?8 that the Foreign Workers Fee violates Articles 2 (full protection and
security), 3 (1) and 3(2) of the Treaty because:

(1) The Foreign Workers Fee and 10% Quota are arbitrary because they are
excessive in amount (10 times the minimum monthly salary whereas a 2 times
the minimum monthly salary would be sufficient to reach Respondent's
objective, provided qualified Mongolian nationals are available) and impose a
disproportionate burden as it is impossible for GEM to comply with the
regulation and hire qualified Mongolian workforce.22

(2) The Foreign Workers Fee and 10% Quota are discriminatory because they
apply in the mining sector only, regardless of the profession of the foreign
worker. Mining industry employers' must pay a fee of 10 times the minimum
monthly salary whereas all the other employers pay a fee of 2 times the minimum
monthly salary.33°

(3) The Foreign Workers Fee and 10% Quota were unpredictable and contrary to
Claimants' legitimate expectations, which included Mongolia using "legal
instruments that govern the actions of the investor or the investment in
conformity with the function usually assigned to such instruments.23!

353. In Claimants! own words:

"Mongolia has breached Article 3 of the Treaty in connection with
the introduction of the extraordinary fee for import of foreign
workforce in excess of the 10% quota in the following ways:

(a) Mongolia has breached its obligations under Article 3(1)
to provide fair and equitable treatment to the Claimants'
investment because the extraordinary fee for import of
foreign workforce in excess of the 10% quota arbitrary
and discriminatory (sic), unpredictably changed the
business and legal framework for the Claimants'
investment, and violated the Claimants' legitimate
expectations.

(b) Mongolia has breached its obligations under Article 3(1)
not to impair the operation, management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment, or disposal of the Claimants'
investments by discriminatory, unreasonable or
unjustified measures because the extraordinary fee for
import of foreign workforce in excess of the 10% quota
impairs the operation of the Claimants! investment is
(sic) arbitrary and discriminatory; and

(c) Mongolia has breached its obligations under Article 3(2)

and/or the nationals of any third state because the
extraordinary fee for import of foreign workforce in
excess of the 10% quota discriminates against the

foreign companies active outside of the mining sector."
332

Respondent asserts that such a legislative change was reasonably foreseeable in light of
Article 34 of the 1997 Minerals Law stipulating that "License holders shall employ citizens of
Mongolia in their exploration and mining operations on a priority basis" (which Claimants
allegedly did not do). Thus, Claimants were on notice that Mongolia had a policy
preference for the employment of Mongolian citizens in the mining industry and,
therefore, the levying of foreign workers fees and the imposition of quotas do not
constitute a breach of the fair and equitable treatment as it was not unexpected in light
of mining companies' failure to give effect to Article 34 of the 1997 Minerals Law (i.e.
Claimants lacked any legitimate expectation that Mongolia would not introduce such a
measure). The foregoing reasoning is also invoked by Respondent to distinguish the
Tecmed and LG&E cases referred to by Claimants.3%3

Respondent further states that the FWF and quotas are in line with the preamble of the
Treaty (transfer of knowledge and technology) and that Mongolia pursues a valid
objective of creating employment of the large population of local artisanal miners, who
are largely unemployed.34

Claimants further argue that Article 34 of the 1997 Minerals Law is irrelevant as it did
not provide for any fee in connection with the employment of foreign nationals*5 and
point out that artisanal miners are not qualified for industrial mining (which explains
why they are not employed by industrial mining companies such as GEM).26 Finally,
Claimants stress that Mongolia failed to join issue with respect to discrimination, despite
the fact that this standard is specifically mentioned in the Treaty.37

In its Rejoinder,%* Respondent contests Claimants' allegation regarding the lack of
qualified workforce in Mongolia and asserts that GEM's inability to hire local workforce
is due to its Russian language requirements for all the positions.%9

In its Post-Hearing Brief,349 Respondent takes the position that the arbitrary treatment
claim fails because (i) a two times fee would have been insufficient to cause companies
to hire Mongolian workers (as demonstrated by the fact that even after the enactment of
the FWF, GEM did not increase its share of Mongolian workers) and (ii) the objective
pursued by the FWF is appropriate as stated by Claimants' legal expert.*!

5.4.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

Claimants make two pleas in connection with the entry of foreign workers into
Mongolia. The first has to do with the enactment and the application of the FWF. The
second deals with the alleged refusal of Respondent to extend existing foreign work
permits. This second matter will be dealt in the section of this Award dealing with
claims concerning the events of December 2, 2008 and thereafter.

In this section, the Tribunal will address the claim concerning the enactment and the
application of the 2006 Minerals Law? which provided that mining companies
employing foreign citizens in excess of a 10% quota must pay a special monthly fee
equal to ten times the minimum salary in Mongolia, while, under the previous law on
the subject, the payment was only two times the minimum monthly salary.

Claimants argue that the enactment and application of the FWF constituted breaches of
Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty. The Tribunal has noted that, in its Post-Hearing Brief,
Claimants have not argued a breach of Article 2 in connection with the FWF. That
argument could therefore be ignored but, in any event, bearing in mind the analysis
already made by the Tribunal concerning the meaning of the protection granted under
Article 2, it is clear that the Tribunal could not conclude that the enactment and
application of the FWF could constitute a breach of Article 2 of the Treaty. The "full legal
protection to investments" guaranteed by that Article could not prevent the adoption by
the Great Khural of legislation like the 2006 Minerals Law and, in the absence of a
stability agreement, could not prevent its application to Claimants.

As to its argument under Article 3, Claimants base it on the alleged lack of protection of
their legitimate expectations, of transparency, of a stable and predictable regulatory
framework, the discriminatory character of the FWF and its unreasonableness.

The Tribunal is not convinced by the argument advanced by Claimants to the effect that
it is impossible for GEM to limit the employment of foreign workers to 10% of its
workforce, Mongolia not having the qualified personnel to meet its particular
requirements. They say that, because of this, Claimants' business was negatively
impacted in a significant way; according to them, at the end of 2007, the required
payment in that respect amounted to about USD 500,000 a month.

First of all, it is not unheard of that States impose restrictions on the hiring of foreign
workers; such restrictions can take various forms. By themselves, such restrictions,
including a total ban on foreign workers, do not automatically constitute a breach of a
BIT. The burden is upon the investor to prove that a particular provision of a BIT has
been breached.

Secondly, in the present case, the particular challenged measure does not appear to be
discriminatory or breaching the fair and equal treatment standard under Article 3 of the
Treaty, in any of the forms alleged above by Claimants.

Claimants argue that it is discriminatory because it is limited to the mining industry. The
Tribunal has already ruled that the WPT Law did not constitute a discriminatory
measure simply because it imposed heavier taxation on the gold mining industry
compared to copper mining or the whole mining industry and that there were
reasonable explanations why a special tax regime could be imposed upon a particular
business sector which would enjoy, at a particular time, large windfall gains. This may
not be very wise public policy but it does not by itself make it a breach of a particular
BIT. It is therefore all of the more the case when a law applies equally, like in this
instance, to a whole industry: the mining industry. It may be true that the required
qualifications for a truck driver in the mining industry may not be significantly different
from those required for the same function in the rest of the economy. But such an issue
is not generally the one considered by a State when it enacts specific legislation
concerning the import of foreign workers. In the present instance, the mining sector is a
strategic sector for Mongolia, representing a large part of its industrial activity and being
the one which attracted most foreign workers. In such circumstances, it is quite
understandable that the State wished to impose severe restrictions on the use of foreign
workers, in order to foster the employment of nationals. GEM seems to have been the
company that has suffered the most from the imposition of entry fees but there was
nothing in the relevant legislation which implied, even in a minimal way, that it targeted
GEM in particular. Moreover, Mongolia has succeeded in demonstrating that several
other foreign mining companies, including gold mining ones, managed to achieve a
much smaller percentage of foreign workers than GEM without appearing to suffer
prejudice in their activities.

It does appear from the evidence that GEM preferred to run a large part of its operations
with Russian workers, alleging the special nature of placer mining and the lack of
qualified Mongolian personnel to fill the required functions. It may well be that some
specialists might have been required to operate dredges and other major machinery and
that Mongolia did not have enough qualified local workers for those functions but, still,
that cannot explain the large percentage of foreign workers (essentially Russian)

employed by GEM compared to any other mining company in Mongolia. Mongolia has
demonstrated before the Tribunal that its technical schools were producing a large
number of graduates trained for the mining industry but Claimants have not shown that
GEM made any special effort to increase its contingent of Mongolian employees.

The Tribunal has received unchallenged evidence from the Director of Mining of
Mongolia, Mr. N. Batbayar* to the effect that Mongolia has five universities from which
students graduate in mining and that, each year, hundreds of students graduate with a
bachelor’s or a master’s degree in mining. In addition, vocational schools also teach
mining to their students. M., Batbayar referred to his own experience as Operational
Manager of a gold placer mining company (like GEM) for several years where all of the
workers were Mongolian.*45 Mr. Batbayar also referred to other large foreign mining
companies, like Ivanhoe and Boroo, which hire up to 95% Mongolian workers, while the
best that could be achieved by GEM in 2007 was a proportion of about 50% 346

From the evidence submitted to the Tribunal, it would appear that GEM was of the view
that the working language for most of the company’s activities should be Russian*47 and
that this resulted in the rejection of many candidates for employment who did not speak
Russian. This may indeed have been GEM’s decision but it should not have been
surprised that Mongolia would have adopted legislation which would have created a
strong incentive for the employment of its own nationals, even though they may not
have been fluent in a foreign language. Mr. Batbayar also gave the example of another
mining company (Ivanhoe) which did not require the knowledge of a foreign language
by candidates before entry but which had courses for its employees to teach them
English.48

Claimants also argue that, in breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty, the adoption of the FWF
and its implementation clashed with their legitimate expectations at the time of their
investment, starting in 1996, when the law simply mentioned that mining companies
should give priority to employment of Mongolians, without imposing any sanction. A
related argument is also to the effect that such development was breaching Claimants’
entitlement to a stable and predictable regulatory framework. The Workforce Specialists
Law was enacted in 2001, and Claimants did not raise any objection to it. Claimants
however add that they had no indication that the legal and business framework in
which they operated would be changed as significantly as it was under the 2006
amendment to the Minerals Law. They also complain that the FWF is not really a fee to
encourage the employment of local citizens but a disguised tax to raise revenues. But
even if it were so, as indicated above, investors cannot legitimately expect that the
taxation environment which they face at the time of their first investment will not be

substantially altered with the passage of time and the evolution of events. The proper
way for an investor to protect itself in such circumstances is to ensure that it will benefit
from a stability agreement covering taxation and other matters; absent such an
agreement, the investor will face the much more difficult task of demonstrating that a
breach of particular provision of a BIT has occurred. This, Claimants have not succeeded
in doing.

As to Claimants’ argument about the arbitrary and unreasonable character of the FWF,
there is no sustainable evidence before the Tribunal that its enactment or application
produced any such result. Nothing indicates that the FWF was not adopted by the Great
Khural in conformity with its procedure or that, in its application, Respondent resorted
to arbitrary or unreasonable measures. If, by that argument, Claimants attack the nature
itself of the legislative measure, the Tribunal has already indicated above that it does not
agree that such measure was in breach of the Treaty. As stated by Claimants’ own legal
expert, Professor Temuulen Bataa: "The objective of Article 43 of the above Law (the
article of the Minerals Law imposing the FWF), that is to provide employment
opportunities to Mongolian citizens, is appropriate" 49

As to the argument that the FWF’s objective was really to increase fees revenues rather
than to foster the employment of Mongolian nationals, the Tribunal fails to see that, if
even this was true, it would turn the FWF into a breach of the Treaty. The way for GEM
to avoid or reduce those fees was to increase rapidly and significantly the number of its
Mongolian employees, which it did, for instance, at two deposit sites, increasing local
staff from about 26% in 2006 to 37% in 2008.3 An alternative to an increase of the fees
could have been for Mongolia to simply set a ceiling of 10% to the employment of
foreign workers but this would have had even more dramatic consequences for GEM.

5.4.3. CONCLUSION

The enactment and application of the FWF were neither arbitrary, unreasonable,
discriminatory, unpredictable or contrary to Claimants' legitimate expectations or to the
maintenance of a stable and predictable regulatory framework These actions did not
constitute a breach of either Article 2 or Article 3 of the Treaty.

On the basis of all the above, Claimants' claims concerning the FWF are dismissed.

2001 STABILITY AGREEMENT NEGOTIATIONS

5.5.1 RELEVANT FACTS

As early as 1993, Mongolia's Foreign Investment Law made stability agreements
available to foreign investors. Of particular relevance to the present case, Article 20 of

4 Temuulen-I, 424

380 Ibragimova-IIl, $145.

- 86-

1997 Minerals Law,*5! in force when Claimants made their investment in Mongolia, also
provided for stability agreements for investments in the mining industry:

"1. If a mining license holder undertakes to invest in its mining
project in Mongolia no less than two (2) million US Dollars
for the first five (5) years of the project, and if the mining
license holder submits an application to enter into a stability
agreement, then the Government of Mongolia, acting
through the Minister of Finance, shall enter into such a
stability agreement providing guarantees for a long term
stable environment for such mining license holder.

2. The form of the stability agreement shall be approved by the
Government and shall contain provisions regarding the
stability of tax rates for a definite time period, the right of the
license holder to export and sell its products at international
market prices, a guarantee that the license holder may
receive and dispose of hard currency income derived from
such sales, and provisions with respect to the purpose,
amount, and term of the license holder's investment.

3. | Within twenty (20) business days following the receipt by
the Minister of Finance of the application and draft of the
stability agreement, the Minister shall determine whether or
not further clarification is required. If the Minister
determines that no further clarification is required, the
Minister shall enter into the stability agreement with the
applicant.

4. If the amount of the initial investment in the Mongolian
mining project is no less than two (2) million US Dollars, the
term of the stability agreement may be ten (10) years. If such
investment is no less than twenty (20) million US Dollars, the
term of the stability agreement may be fifteen (15) years." 352

376. In relation to the foregoing provision, on November 12, 1997, the Government of
Mongolia adopted a model stability agreement (the "1997 Model Stability
Agreement") as it appears from Mongolian Government Resolution No. 226.354

377. The main competitor of GEM in Mongolia was KOO Boroo Gold, a foreign-owned gold
mining company. The relevancy of Boroo Gold's operations for this arbitration is limited

to the issues related to the stability agreements executed between this company and
Respondent.

On July 6, 1998, Boroo Gold and Mongolia entered into a stability agreement regarding
Boroo Gold's exploitation of the "Boroo" gold deposit.555

Boroo Gold's original stability agreement generally corresponded to the 1997 Model
Stability Agreement.36

On May 9, 2000, Boroo Gold and Mongolia entered into an amendment to the stability
agreement that, according to Claimants, extended Boroo Gold's protection far beyond
what was contemplated under the 1997 Model Stability Agreement.25”

According to Claimants, clause 2.8 of the Boroo Amendment*§ expands the stability
protection to all taxes applicable as of the date of the agreement and, thus, protects
Boroo from the WPT.39 Claimants note a discrepancy in the wording of the English and
Mongolian versions of clause 2.8 and argue that the Mongolian version does not provide
protection against new taxes, such as WPT, whereas the English version does.3

On May 3, 2001, GEM requested Mongolia to enter into a stability agreement and, as a
preliminary matter, to be provided with a draft stability agreement.%*

The above fact was initially disputed by Respondent which stated that "Claimants did not
apply for a stability agreement for their mining operations" .52 This allegation proved to be
inaccurate.

On May 17, 2001, Mongolia provided GEM with a draft stability agreement.

On May 23, 2001, GEM submitted to Mongolia a reviewed draft stability agreement.5*+

GEM's draft stability agreement provided for a freeze of the taxation regime
applicable to GEM (including novel taxes) and set specific rates for all the 14 taxes then
applicable to GEM.366

On June 5, 2001, the Minister of Industry and Trade confirmed the appointment of a
Working Group, which included Mr. Tumendemberel and Mr. Ganbat who both
testified at the Hearing, entrusted with the task of negotiating the stability agreement
with GEM.%7

According to GEM's contemporaneous correspondence, "the Working Group set for
the negotiation of the agreement explained that the stability agreement can only be
entered into based on the approved form".

On June 23, 2001 and again on August 13, 2001, GEM asked the Ministry of Industry and
Trade whether the terms of the Model Stability Agreement could be changed.26?

According to Claimants, "Mongolian authorities were not willing to make any changes
to the form stability agreement" and, thus, "no stability agreement has been signed".57°

On March 24, 2002, the Mongolian Government adopted a new Model Stability
Agreement.37!

On March 26, 2002, Vostokneftegaz and Mongolia entered into a stability agreement.2”2

On January 20, 2005, Mongolia entered into a stability agreement with Dynam
Investment Co. Ltd and Erin International Co. Ltd.373

On August 3, 2007, Mongolia and Boroo entered into another amendment to the stability
agreement?! whereby modifying the percentage of corporate taxes (decrease) and
royalties (increase) payable by Boroo. According to Claimants, this amendment was
negotiated in the context of Respondent's attempt to enforce the WPT against Boroo.%75

categories of issues remain however intertwined). For the avoidance of doubt, this
section is concerned with the latter category of issues only, i.e. Claimants' positive claims
regarding the negotiation of the stability agreement between GEM and Mongolia in
2001, including the consequences of this negotiation, if any, on the enforcement of the
WPT in 2006 and thereafter.

Relying on CME »v. The Czech Republic3’6, Claimants argue that Respondent has accepted
the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione temporis over the negotiation of the stability agreement,
because it waived any objections by not raising them within the time limits under
Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration rules.

Furthermore, according to Claimants, even in the absence of such a waiver, the scope of
Mongolia's offer to arbitrate in Article 6 of the Treaty encompasses disputes arising after
the entry into force of the Treaty but based on events predating the entry into force of
the Treaty, such as the case of the dispute regarding the 2001 stability agreement
negotiations, which dispute had not arisen prior to this arbitration.57””

Respondent denies having waived the objection based on the lack of jurisdiction ratione
temporis on the following grounds:

(1) Mongolia could not have waived an objection to the jurisdiction ratione
temporis as the claims related to the 2001 stability agreement negotiations have
been raised in Claimants' Post-Hearing Brief for the first time 978 and there is no
dispute with respect to the 2001 stability agreement negotiations”? and

(2) Pursuant to Article 20 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, no jurisdictional
waiver is possible with respect to the amended claims.28°

Furthermore, Respondent submits that it would be deprived of its right to rebut the 2001
stability agreement negotiations claim and, thus, of its fundamental right to be heard.38!

With respect to the scope of the offer to arbitrate, Respondent, on the premise that
Claimants' WPT-related claims constitute a continuation of their claims with regard to
the 2001 stability agreement negotiations, objects ratione temporis to "Claimants' entire
claims."382 Implicitly, Respondent thus argues that Article 6 of the Treaty does not
encompass disputes over the events predating the entry into force of the Treaty (even if
such disputes themselves arise only after the entry into force of the Treaty).

5.5.2.2. Applicable law

Claimants submit that the substantive law applicable to Mongolia's conduct in the 2001
negotiations of a stability agreement with GEM is the Treaty as Article 9 thereof makes it
substantively retroactive.

In any event, Claimants argue, customary international law is also applicable to these
claims. As to the standard of treatment applicable under customary international law,
Claimants suggest that it is coextensive with the standards under investment treaties
and, even if such was not the case, Mongolia's conduct in the 2001 negotiations violated
any formulation of the minimum standard of treatment under international law (be it
the Neer formulation or the more recent Mondev/Waste Management formulation).5%4

In Respondent's view, the Treaty cannot be provisionally applied (which also excludes
any retroactive application). As far as the customary international law is concerned,
Respondent suggests, provided jurisdiction is found to exist, to apply the so-called Neer
standard. If the Treaty provisions were applicable, Respondent reiterates its arguments
regarding the narrow interpretation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty (notwithstanding the
MEN provision, which, according to Respondent, is not applicable to the FET regime).
Finally, Respondent concludes that even if a different treatment standard were imported
by means of the MEN, the 2001 stability agreement negotiations would not constitute a
breach of the Treaty.285

5.5.2.3 Substantive claims

The Tribunal notes that Claimants' claims with respect to the 2001 Stability Agreement
Negotiations stem from Respondent's defenses against the allegation that it unevenly
enforces the WPT not collecting same from Boroo:

"14. Third, and perhaps most remarkable, Mongolia applies the
Windfall Profit Tax in a discriminatory manner even among
gold producers. The Windfall Profit Tax is not levied at all on
Boroo Gold, the largest gold producer in Mongolia.8° This
bare, incontestable fact strips Mongolia of any argument that
it enacted the Windfall Profit Tax in the public interest. It
would not be credible to claim the purpose of the tax is to
benefit the public interest while foregoing its largest
potential source of revenue."387

In defense to the above claim, Respondent replied that the WPT is not enforced against
Boroo because the latter entered into a stability agreement and that such a stability
agreement was available to GEM but the latter did not apply for it:

"115. The Windfall Profits Tax was aimed at capturing some of the
historic and unexpected rise of gold price for developmental
purposes in Mongolia. The Windfall Profits Tax was not
aimed at Russian investors. The Windfall Profits Tax in fact
was not just applicable to foreign investors, but to all mining
companies. To the extent a foreign investor was "singled
out", such as Boroo Gold, this because the investor, unlike
Mr. Paushok, made an investment at the minimal level
required to apply for a stability agreement. Claimants had
the_same_ opportunity to obtain a stability agreement but
choose to make an investment too small to qualify for one
and did not even apply." 388 [emphasis added]

and concludes:

"281 To conclude, Claimants' discrimination argument fails.
Fundamentally, Claimants compare themselves to
reasonable investors that entered into a stability agreement

in order to make out disparate treatment. This comparison is
exactly improper." 38° [emphasis added]

As mentioned in Section 4.5 above, Respondent initially heavily relied on the allegation
that Claimants did not apply for a stability agreement and, in later submissions, insisted
that they failed to commit the required amount of investment, stressing that if GEM had
obtained such a readily available (at a low USD 2 million threshold) stability agreement,
it would have been exempt from the WPT (and the FWF) ["Stability agreements were
readily available to mining investors"] and that GEM's "failure to apply for a stability
agreement destroys the reasonable expectations, which is fatal to Claimants' Treaty
claims."9

Relying on the facts brought to light by Respondent's statements regarding the stability
agreement-related events of 2001 and its argument that such a stability agreement
would have protected Claimants both from the WPT and the FWF, Claimants articulate
the following claims.

Claimants submit that the failure to make available to GEM a stability agreement
comparable to the one it granted to Boroo and the ensuing uneven enforcement of the
WPT constitute a violation of Articles 2(1), 2(2), 3(1) and 3(2) of the Treaty as well as of

the customary minimum standard of treatment. More specifically, Claimants argue as
follows:

"Q) Mongolia's failure to make available to GEM a stability
agreement comparable to the one it granted to a Canadian
investment, Boroo Gold, and the ensuing enforcement of the WPT
against GEM but not against Boroo Gold discriminates between
GEM and Boroo Gold, which constitute a violation of the fair and
equitable treatment and the non-impairment standards provided
for in Article 3(1) of the Treaty.

With respect to the discrimination, Claimants are of the view that
"Mongolia's refusal to offer GEM a_ stability agreement
comparable to the stability agreement it had concluded a year
earlier with Boroo Gold could not be unintentional" and this fact
establishes Mongolia's discriminatory intent, if such is required.
According to Claimants however, such a discriminatory intent is
not required to establish discrimination.

(2) Mongolia failed to grant the "Claimants' investments
treatment not less favorable than that granted to investors from
any third country because Mongolia does not enforce the WPT
against Canadian owned Boroo Gold and because it offered Boroo
Gold a stability agreement more advantageous than the stability
agreement it offered to GEM", which constitutes a violation of
Article 3(2) of the Treaty.3%

(3) Mongolia's dealing with GEM's application for a stability
agreement and related negotiations were not transparent,
reasonable and in good faith as Mongolia (i) offered GEM the
standard stability agreement which would not have protected
GEM against the WPT and (ii) failed to disclose that it had
concluded a stability agreement with Boroo Gold which provided
protection from new taxes and, thus, the WPT, the whole in
violation of the fair and equitable treatment and the non-
impairment standards provided for in Article 3(1) of the Treaty.3%

(4) "The application of the WPT is non-transparent and
unforeseeable because it is not levied against Boroo Gold based on
a provision of Boroo Gold's stability agreement that has not been
offered to GEM and that most likely violates Mongolian law", the

whole contrary to the obligation to encourage Russian
investments and to provide full legal security respectively set
forth in Articles 2(1) and 2(2) of the Treaty.3%

(5) "[T]he customary minimum standard of treatment (being)
often found to be coextensive with the standards of treatment
under investment treaties", the violations of Articles 3(1), 3(2) and
2 described above also constitute violations of the customary
minimum standard of treatment.°”

Respondent answers Claimants' stability agreement related claims as follows:

") Respondent argues that the discrimination claim fails
because:

(1.1.) Claimants do not allege having been denied a benefit on
account of their Russian nationality but rather that a benefit
granted to a Canadian investor (Boroo Gold) was not granted to
them. Such a claim falls under Article 3(2) of the Treaty (Most-
Favoured-Nation provision) and not under the scope of a
discrimination claim under Article 3(1) of the Treaty (fair and
equitable treatment and non-impairment). Pursuant to the terms
of the Treaty, the MFN provision does not apply to agreements
relating to tax and, thus, does not apply to stability agreements.38

(1.2.) Even if Claimants could invoke the MEN provision, the
discrimination claim fails because Boroo Gold committed to make
future investments whereas GEM "refused to commit to make any
prospective investments at all" (as required by the 1997 Mineral
Laws). In Respondent's words, Claimants "themselves caused the
negotiations to fail, and cannot prove that they could never have
achieved an equally broad stability agreement to the one
negotiated by Boroo Gold had they made such promises of future
investments."9°

(1.3.) Both Mongolian and English versions of the 2000 Boroo Gold
Stability Agreement Amendment protected Boroo Gold from the
WPT and this amendment is lawful.4

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent adopts a different position
and suggests, by reference to the 1997 Mineral Laws, that stability
agreements always protected investors against the imposition of
new taxes even in the absence of a provision to that effect in a
given stability agreement.

(1.4.) Claimants! Article 2 claims are duplicative of those based on
Article 3(1) of the Treaty. Further, the WPT does not interfere with
a legal protection as "Claimants had none with regard to such a
tax having chosen not to enter into a stability agreement".
Therefore, there is no breach of Article 2 of the Treaty.402

(2) Respondent denies having negotiated in bad faith and
having been unreasonable in the context of its dealing with GEM's
application for a stability agreement:

"102. [...] Claimants also raise, improperly in the "Reply", a new
issue with regard to unreasonable treatment not part of the
Statement of Claim, alleging that Mongolia's refusal to grant
GEM a stability agreement was unreasonable. [...] Claimants
cannot complain of unreasonable conduct by Mongolia,
considering that GEM's application was not in keeping with
Mongolian law as set out above. [...] Thus, the claim itself is
frivolous in light of the Russian-Mongolian BIT, as well as
the facts of the case."49

(3) Respondent denies having breached the fair and equitable
treatment obligation by acting in a non-transparent fashion when
dealing with GEM's application for a stability agreement. On this
issue, Respondent's argument unfolds as follows:

(3.1.) GEM was not granted a stability agreement because it
proposed a draft agreement whereby it sough to rely on past
investments rather than committing to make future investments.
As the 1997 Minerals Law requires a prospective investment
(rather than a retrospective one), GEM was not entitled to receive
a stability agreement;!%

(3.2.) "Mongolia has agreed and would agree to changes to the
1997 Model Stability Agreement" and the fact that there existed

stability agreements "different than the model form was notorious
in and out of Mongolia";495

(3.3.) Claimants' comparison to the stability agreement achieved
by Boroo Gold is inappropriate as the latter committed to make
future investments whereas GEM refused to do so;4%

(4) Without specifically addressing the issue of the allegedly
uneven application of the WPT and those related to the
negotiation of the stability agreement, Respondent submits that
the minimum standard of treatment is not part of customary
international law."40”

5.5.3 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

The availability of stability agreements was included in the 1997 Minerals Law; in order
to qualify, a mining investor had to undertake to invest at least USD 2 million.
Moreover, an amendment of 2001 to the General Tax Law confirmed the recognition by
Mongolia that the provisions of a stability agreement would apply consistently
regardless of the provisions of tax legislation enacted after the conclusion of such an
agreement.*°8 Stability agreements were matters of negotiation between an investor and
representatives of the Government of Mongolia on a case-by-case basis.

The Parties are in agreement that no stability agreement was executed. There is
considerable dispute however as to whether GEM committed to future investments and
as to whether Respondent acted in good faith and transparently while considering such
application if it took place. The facts and the arguments of the Parties have been
summarized above in this Award.

The Tribunal has carefully reviewed the arguments raised by the Parties in their
Supplemental Post-Hearing Briefs as well as all the evidence and arguments previously
adduced by the Parties relating to the 2001 negotiations about a stability agreement (‘the
Negotiations"). It will now address the key questions raised by the Parties as follows:

(1) Was the claim regarding the Negotiations properly brought before the Tribunal
and has Respondent waived its right to raise objections on the basis of lack of
jurisdiction ratione temporis?

(2) What is the ratione temporis scope of the Tribunal's adjudicative jurisdiction?

(3) If the Negotiations are outside of the Tribunal's jurisdiction, does the doctrine of
continuing acts and composite acts nonetheless allow the Tribunal to adjudicate

on the 2001 facts, together with the 2006 and subsequent events (regarding the
uneven enforcement of the WPT)?

In answering those questions, the Tribunal is aware that, in Procedural Order No. 1, the
Parties agreed that the applicable law was the Treaty, Mongolian law and public
international law.

5.5.3.2. Was the claim regarding the Negotiations properly brought before
the Tribunal and has Respondent waived its right to raise objections
on the basis of lack of jurisdiction ratione temporis?

The issue of discrimination in favor of Boroo Gold was raised in Claimants' Statement of
Claim, The thrust of their argument however was not to the effect that the alleged
refusal by Mongolia to grant GEM a stability agreement was a breach of the Treaty but
that "the application of the Windfall Profit Tax is discriminatory even among gold
producers"*© and that "it discriminates between GEM and Boroo Gold because the
Windfall Profit Tax is not enforced against Boroo Gold." In its request for relief!2, it
seeks, among other things, declarations by the Tribunal that Mongolia breached Article 3
of the Treaty by "failing to grant Claimants! investments fair and equal treatment" and
"by applying discriminatory, unreasonable and unjustified measures that impaired the
operation, management, maintenance, use, enjoyment and/or disposal of Claimants!
investments". No reference is made to customary international law or to the
Negotiations.

Respondent's Defense responded to Claimants' claims that it had violated the Treaty
after its entry into force through its conduct relating to the WPT, the FWF, and the
SCSA. In particular, it argued that, because GEM did not apply for a stability agreement
(a statement later proven erroneous and abandoned by Respondent), Claimants were
not entitled to the broad protections from changes in tax laws that they claimed.113

In their Reply, Claimants argued strenuously that Respondent was wrong in pleading
that Claimants were not entitled to Treaty protection because GEM had not applied for a
stability agreement; in their view, their failure to obtain a stability agreement could not
be an objection to their claims for breach of the Treaty in connection with the WPT, the
FWE and the SCSA. They maintained that the WPT discriminated between producers of
gold and producers of copper and that Mongolia's enforcement of the WPT
discriminated between GEM and its main competitor, Boroo Gold. In that particular
regard, they argued that Respondent had not made available to GEM a stability
agreement comparable to the one offered to Boroo Gold and, secondly, that it had

refused to consider Claimants' arguments about the illegality of the WPT under the
Treaty, even though it had agreed not to levy the WPT against Boroo Gold.4!4

417. An important element for the consideration of the Tribunal is the conclusion of
Claimants.415 Summarizing their position, Claimants state in particular:

"[...] Mongolia has done nothing to rebut Claimants' assertion that
it breached Articles 2 and 4 of the Treaty and the customary
minimum standard of treatment in connection with the adoption
and_uneven _enforcement_of the WPT in the following ways:
[emphasis added] [...]

(f) Mongolia has breached its duty under Article 3(2) to grant the
Claimants! investments treatment no less favorable than that
granted to investors from any third country because Mongolia
does not enforce the WPT against Canadian-owned Boroo Gold,
the largest producer in Mongolia, and_because it offered Boroo
Gold _a_stability agreement much more advantageous than the
stability agreement it offered to GEM [emphasis added]; and

(g) Mongolia has breached the customary minimum standard of
treatment by any and all of its conduct described above."

418. Witness testimony and arguments concerning the Negotiations were presented to the
Tribunal by both sides at the time of the Hearing. The Tribunal has noted, in particular,
the statement of Counsel for Claimants, in their opening statement,"6 where after having
discussed the issue of stability agreements, it is said:

"So our discrimination claim stands. Boroo was offered a stability
agreement that GEM was not aware it could get, either due to
unequal treatment or the Government's non-transparency
regarding what protections were available to the investor,
Mongolia has breached the Treaty. It cannot say that claimants do
not have treaty protections against _taxes because they did not

enter into a stability agreement that they did not know they could
seek." [emphasis added]

419. In their Post-Hearing Brief, Claimants referred to alleged breaches in connection with
the Negotiations, but this was for alleged violations under Article 3.1 of the Treaty
only.” A reference to customary international law is summarily made in footnote 139 of
that Brief and it is mentioned in connection with violations of Article 4 of the Treaty. The
conclusion of their Post-Hearing Brief reads as follows:

"As shown in Claimants’ submissions and at the Hearing,
Mongolia has repeatedly violated the Treaty. The Tribunal should
hold Mongolia liable for those violations and proceed to the
damages phase of this arbitration.

Finally, in the Conclusion of their Supplemental Post-Hearing
Brief in answer to the two questions raised by the Tribunal,
Claimants submitted the following arguments:

(a) The Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis over Claimants'
claims that Mongolia breached the Treaty after its entry-into-
force through its conduct relating the WPT, the FWF and
may consider Mongolia's conduct to determine the validity
of Mongolia's defenses based on the allegation that GEM did
not obtain a stability agreement.

(b) The Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis over Claimants'
claims that Mongolia's conduct in negotiations for a stability
agreement with GEM in 2001 is itself a breach of
international law because:

(i) Mongolia has accepted the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione
temporis because it waived any objections by not raising
them within the time limits under Article 21(3) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; and

(ii) Even if, arguendo, Mongolia had not waived any
objections to the Tribunal's jurisdiction ratione temporis,
the scope of Mongolia's offer to arbitrate in Article 6 of
the Treaty encompasses disputes based on events that
pre-date the entry-into-force of the Treaty;

(c) The substantive law applicable to Claimants' claims in (b)
above is the Treaty and customary international law because
Article 9 makes it substantively retroactive; and

(d) Even if Article9 does not provide for substantive
retroactivity, the substantive law applicable to the claims in
b) above is customary international law."

In its Supplemental Post-Hearing Brief, Respondent argued, in particular, that it could
not have waived an objection ratione temporis, as the Negotiations claim had only been
made in untimely fashion in Claimants’ Post-Hearing Brief; moreover, it said, the Treaty
could not be applied retroactively and, even if customary international law were to be
applied to the Negotiations issue, such a claim would fail.

The Tribunal is of the view that Claimants did submit in their Reply a claim based on the
refusal of Mongolia to grant GEM a stability agreement similar to the one granted to

422.

423.

424,

425.

-99-

Boroo Gold. That claim however was purely based upon the provisions of the Treaty.
The Tribunal notes that, in 343 (g) of the Reply quoted above, there is a claim that, by
the same conduct, Mongolia breached the "customary minimum standard of treatment
by any and all of its conduct described above". But paragraph (g) comes under the
general heading which reads: "Mongolia has done nothing to rebut Claimants' asserting
that it breached Articles 2 and 4 of the Treaty and the customary minimum standard of
treatment in_ connection with the adoption and uneven enforcement of the WPT"
[emphasis added]. It is therefore clear that the claim has to do with the enforcement of
the WPT and not with the Negotiations.

Whatever claims were made by Claimants in connection with the Negotiations, whether
in their Reply, in their oral pleadings or in their Post-Hearing Brief, those claims were
essentially based on provisions of the Treaty and, even when there was a reference to
customary international law,4!8 it was made in reference to the WPT.

Claimants argue however that Respondent has waived its right to object on the basis of
jurisdiction ratione temporis.

First of all, the Tribunal disagrees with Claimants' argument that Respondent has
waived to raise objections on the basis of jurisdiction ratione temporis, because it failed to
raise them within the time limits set under Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules which
states:

"A plea that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction shall be raised
not later than in the statement of defense or, with respect to a
counter-claim, in the reply to the counter-claim."

Respondent could not raise an objection to a claim that could not have been identified by
reading either the Notice of Arbitration or the Statement of Claim. The issue of the
Negotiations was first raised by Respondent in its Statement of Defense when it alleged
that the failure to apply for and obtain a stability agreement precluded the possibility of
a claim in connection with the WPT, thereby tying the issue of the Negotiations to the
WPT. It is only in its Reply that Claimants made reference to the Negotiations with
enough specificity to allow at least a suspicion that a claim was being made in that
regard, albeit still allegedly under the authority of the Treaty and in connection with the
WPT. Claimants also said that the violations of Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 2 of the Treaty
constituted violations of the customary standard of treatment, that standard being "often
found to be coextensive with the standards of treatment under investment treaties."419
Respondent could then have raised a jurisdictional objection to the claim; however,
instead, Respondent engaged into a debate with Claimants as to whether an application
for a stability agreement had been made, what were the terms of such an agreement that
Claimants and Respondent were willing to consider and what were the reasons for the
non-conclusion of a stability agreement in 2001. That debate carried on right into the
Hearing and the Post-Hearing Briefs. Respondent thereby fully joined issue with

Claimants on this subject and, in the Tribunal's view, it waived its rights to raise an
objection ratione temporis concerning the Negotiations issue in so far as the application of
the Treaty and customary international law were concerned, in connection with the
adoption and enforcement of the WPT.

Secondly, if Respondent waived its right to raise objections, it could waive it only in
connection with the claim as made by Claimants. It could not waive its right to challenge
a claim which had not even been made. As demonstrated above, the claim made by
Claimants in that regard during the whole process was only based on the Treaty or "the
customary standard of treatment in connection with the adoption and uneven
enforcement of the WPT." The fact that Claimants added, under the general heading of
9343 of their Reply a sub-paragraph (g) stating that "Mongolia has breached the
customary minimum of standard of treatment by any and all of its conduct above",
cannot change the fact that the claim is made in connection with the WPT, and not in
connection with the Negotiations.

In the present instance, there has been no consent by Respondent to expand their waiver
to a claim that was not even made during the course of the proceedings but only raised
as a separate claim under customary international law in Claimants' Post-Hearing
Submission of November 30, 2009. Claimants' claim concerning the Negotiations of 2001
themselves is therefore improper, as being untimely. A party cannot spring upon
another party what amounts to a new claim at the time of a post-hearing brief, and even
less at the time of a supplemental post-hearing brief.

5.5.3.3 What is the ratione temporis scope of the Tribunal's adjudicative
jurisdiction?

As stated in the Impregilo case, "care must be taken to distinguish between (1) the
jurisdiction ratione temporis of an ICSID tribunal and (2) the applicability ratione temporis
of the substantive obligations contained in a BIT."20 Therefore, the Tribunal will
consider separately the issue of the retroactive application of the substantive obligations
of the Treaty and the issue of the temporal application of the disputes resolution
provision.

A - The temporal application of the substantive obligations of the Treaty.

As to the first issue, the Treaty contains no specific provision concerning the possible
retrospective application of its provisions to breaches which might have occurred before
it came into effect. The only part of the Treaty which mentions the issue of timing is the
first paragraph of Article 9 which reads:

"The present Agreement shall apply to investments made by
investors of one of the Contracting Parties in the territory of the
other Contracting Party since January 1, 1949, in accordance with

420 Impregilo SpA v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/3, Decision on Jurisdiction, April 22, 2005,

4309

430.

431.

432.

- 101-

the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose
territory they have been made."

No reasonable reading of that Article could lead to the conclusion that the substantive
law provisions of the Treaty would apply to alleged breaches which would have
occurred since January 1, 1949. What it says is simply that the benefits of the Treaty
would not be limited to investments made after the entry into force of the Treaty on
February 26, 2006, but that investments made since 1949, even though there was no
applicable BIT at the time the investments were made, could call upon the provisions of
the Treaty from the time of its coming into effect, even if no additional investments had
been made after that date. In no case, however, does this mean that investors could
claim damages retrospectively on the basis of breaches that would have arisen prior to
that date, unless some other provisions of the Treaty would indicate that this was the
clear intention of the Contracting Parties. The Tribunal fails to find any such indication
in the Treaty.

First of all, the whole Treaty is drafted on a prospective basis. The Preamble clearly talks
about the future:

"Having as their objective to create favorable conditions for
investments of investors of one of the Contracting Party in the
territory of the other Contracting Party;

Recognizing that encouragement and reciprocal protection of such
investments will promote development of mutually beneficial
trade [...]."[emphasis added]

And the Treaty's substantive Articles pursue as such:
"Article 2:

1. Each Contracting Party shall encourage investors of the
Contracting Parties to make investments in its territory and
permit such investments in accordance with its laws and
regulations. [...]

Article 3

1. Each Contracting Party shall, in its territory, accord
investments of investors and activities associated with
investments. [...]

2. The treatment, mentioned under paragraph 1 of this Article,
shall not be less favorable than [...]

3. Each Contracting Party shall have the right to maintain and
introduce [...]

- 102-

4. Most favored nation treatment [...] shall not extend to
privileges [...]

Article 4

Investments of investors of one of the Contracting Parties [...] shall
not be nationalized [...]"

433. While it is recognized that the word “shall”, in the English language, has also an
imperative and categorical character, the thrust of the Treaty is prospective and does not
provide for claims arising before the entry into force of the Treaty.

434. Secondly, this interpretation is fully in line with the principle of non-retroactivity
enshrined in Article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties where it is said:

"Unless a different intention appears from the treaty or is
otherwise established, its provisions do not bind a party in
relation to any act or fact which took place or any situation which
ceased to exist before the date of the entry into force of the treaty
with respect to that party."

435. In its 1966 Commentary to the Draft Articles of the Law of Treaties, the International
Law Commission stated:

"There is nothing to prevent the parties from giving a treaty, or
some of its provisions, retroactive effect if they think fit. It is
essentially a question of their intention. The general rule however
is that a treaty is not to be treated as intended to have retroactive
effects unless such an intention is expressed in the treaty or was
clearly to be implied from its terms."42!

436. Reference is also made to Article 30 (1) of the Vienna Convention which provides that:

"A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose."

437. That interpretation of retroactivity has been confirmed in numerous arbitral decisions.
For instance, the ICSID tribunal in Impregilo S.p.A. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan, stated:

"[...] such language — and the absence of specific provision for
retroactivity — infers that disputes that may have arisen before the
entry into force of the BIT are not covered.422"

The language referred to in that case (‘any dispute arising between a Contracting Party
and the investors of the other") is very similar to the one in the present case ("Disputes
between one of the Contracting Parties and investor of the other Contracting Party,
arising in connection with realization of investments").

And the Impregilo tribunal adds:

"In this respect, it is to be noted that Article 1(1) of the BIT does
not give the substantive provisions of the Treaty any retrospective
effect"!

The same conclusion applies in the present case, when analyzing Article 9 of the Treaty.
The only real difference between Article 1(1) of the Italy-Pakistan BIT and Article 9 of
the Treaty is that, in the first case, the coverage date for investments starts in 1954 and,
in the second case, in 1949.

Among others, the following decisions of tribunals go in the same direction: M.C.I Power
Group LC and New Turbine Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador#4, Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine!25
and Kardassopoulos v. Georgia®6 Chevron v. Ecuador’, Feldman v. Mexico!8 and Mondev.
International Ltd v. United States.#9 It has to be noted however that those last two cases
are under NAFTA which, at Article 1117 (1) (a) limits a tribunal's jurisdiction to claims
arising out of an alleged breach of an obligation under Section A of Chapter Eleven of
the NAFTA.

Article 9 of the Treaty declares that investments made by investors from one of the
Contracting Party into the other Contracting Party since January 1, 1949 are covered by
the Treaty. The Tribunal has no hesitation in concluding that, in the present case, the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the BIT is simply to the effect that such
investments can claim all the substantive benefits of the Treaty from the date of its entry
into force but not before. The Tribunal therefore concludes that nothing in the Treaty
supports a retrospective application of its substantive provisions.

B - The temporal application of the disputes resolution provision of the Treaty.

This leaves for consideration the second issue of the temporal application of the disputes
provision of the Treaty (Article 6) which, in the relevant paragraph, reads as follows:

"Disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor
of the other Contracting Party, arising in connection with the
realization of investments, including disputes concerning the
amount, terms or method of compensation of payment of the
compensation, shall, whenever possible, be settled through
negotiations."

Claimants argue that Article6 of the Treaty grants the Tribunal jurisdiction over
disputes which arose prior to the entry into force of the Treaty as well as those which
arose after the entry into force of the Treaty but are based on events predating such
event. According to them a double exclusion clause (excluding not only disputes that
arose prior to the entry into force of the Treaty but also disputes over facts or situations
existing prior to such entry into force) "would be required to exclude the Tribunal's
jurisdiction over the claims about the Negotiations because they constitute a dispute
arising after the entry into force of the Treaty but based on prior events." In support of
their position, Claimants quote two ICSID decisions on annulment: Vivendi v. Argentina
(Compania de Aquas del Aconquija S.A. v. Argentine Republic®! and Lucchetti v. Peru
Industria Nacional de Alimentos Peru, S.A. v. The Republic of Peru.°?

First of all, the first quote mentioned by Claimants merely makes the innocuous
statement in the present circumstances that:

"[...] the requirements for arbitral jurisdiction in Article 8 (of the
relevant treaty in that case) do not necessitate that the Claimant
allege a breach of the BIT itself: It is sufficient that the dispute
relate to an investment made under the BIT." 4%

As to the Lucchetti case, Claimants refer to the following quote:

"While in the BIT an exception is made for disputes that arose
prior to its entry into force ("single exclusion"), the exception in
other treaties covers not only disputes that arose prior to the entry
into force of the treaty but also disputes over facts or situations
that occurred prior to its entry into force ("double exclusion"). This
means that on this point the exception in the BIT is a narrow one
in comparison with other treaties.

[...] Where there is a double exclusion clause, jurisdiction can be
denied even if the dispute arose after the entry into force of the

treaty, provided that it related to events occurring prior to its
entry into force." 434

The Tribunal notes that, in that case, the Annulment Committee was dealing with a
clause significantly different from Article 9 of the Treaty applicable to the present case.
Art. 2 of the Chile-Peru BIT provided:

"This Treaty shall apply to investments made before or after its
entry into force by investors of one Contracting Party, in
accordance with the legal provision of the other Contracting Party
and in the latter's territory. It shall not, however, apply to
differences or disputes that arose prior to its entry-into-force."

The Annulment Committee was called upon to interpret the meaning of a clause
containing a single exclusion and it went on to discuss the differences between single
and double exclusion clauses. In the end, it concluded that a double exclusion clause
would be required to exclude not only disputes which arose before the entry into force
of the Chile-Peru BIT but also disputes arising after such entry into force and relating to
prior actions or omissions.

Be that as it may, Article 6 of the Treaty in the present case contains no single or double
exclusion clause and the Tribunal has to reach a conclusion, on the basis of that specific
Article and of the Vienna Convention, as to whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule
on a dispute which has arisen after the entry into force of the Treaty but which is based
on events which occurred well before it.

On that issue, some controversy still seems to exist.

For instance, in the Generation Ukraine case, the tribunal had to consider an expropriation
claim. It considered that the claimant had made an investment recognized by the
relevant BIT, even though the transactions relating to that investment occurred before
the entry into force of the BIT, which had a clause similar to Article 9 in the present case.
It concluded however that the tribunal could only have jurisdiction over a cause of
action based on one of the BIT standards of protection which had arisen after the entry
into force of the BIT. Then it added the following:

"It is plain that several of the BIT standards, and the prohibition
against expropriation in particular, are simply a conventional
codification of standards that have long existed in customary
international law. The Tribunal does not, however, have general
jurisdiction over causes of action based on the obligations of states
in customary international law.

In conclusion, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione temporis is limited
to alleged expropriatory acts which occurred after 16 November
1996. (the date of entry into force of the BIT).4%5

Article VI(1) of the Ukraine-USA BIT defines the word "dispute"
as:

[...] a dispute between a Party and a national or
company of the other Party arising out of or relating to
(a) an investment agreement between that Party and
such national or company; (b) an investment
authorization granted by that Party's foreign
investment authority to such national or company; or
(c) an alleged breach of any right conferred or created
by this Treaty with respect to an investment.

It may be noted that item (c) of that Article can be read as limiting claims to breaches of
right conferred by that BIT, but it is to be noted that the items in that Article are not
mentioned as cumulative restrictions but as alternatives and that no such restriction
applies to the first two items. Moreover, the Tribunal, in the quotations mentioned
above, makes no mention of that item as being a basis for its conclusion.

In that particular case, the Tribunal arrived at the conclusion that each of the alleged acts
of expropriation occurred after the entry into force of the BIT but decided on the merits
to reject the Claimants' claims.

In another case,4%6 the arbitral tribunal reached a similar conclusion. The debate in that
case had to with the application of the BIT between Ecuador and the United States to
disputes arising prior to its entry into force; this situation is somewhat different from the
present case where the dispute is alleged to have arisen after the entry into force of the
Treaty but would relate to events having occurred before such entry into force.
Nonetheless, the views of the tribunal are relevant to the present case.

In the M.C.L. case, the BIT, at Article XII, had a clause similar to Article 9 of the Treaty to
the effect that :

"(The BIT) shall apply to investments existing at the time of entry
into force as well as to investments made or acquired thereafter."

And Article VI(4) of the BIT provided, similarly to Article 6 of the Treaty, that:

"Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment
dispute for settlement by binding arbitration [...]."

The claimants in that case argued strenuously both before the arbitral tribunal and the ad
hoc committee that the BIT contained no implicit limitation by the Contracting Parties on
their consent to ICSID jurisdiction to disputes arising after the BIT came into force.

According to them, "the Contracting Parties agreed to submit to binding arbitration
"any" investment dispute unmodified by the express temporal restrictions that appear in
other BITs."97

For its part, Ecuador argued that the tribunal had "no jurisdiction over this dispute
because the test of application of Article 28 of the Convention and Article XII of the BIT
is not whether a dispute arose before the BIT entered into force or continued thereafter
but whether the facts or acts which gave rise to the dispute were committed and
completed before the treaty entered into force or thereafter."498

The arbitral tribunal allowed the objections of Ecuador in respect of the non-retroactivity
of the BIT, exercised its competence over Ecuador's alleged violations of the BIT by acts
or omissions subsequent to the entry into force of the BIT and rejected the claimants’
claims on the merits.

The following quotations from the award are particularly relevant:

"The Tribunal notes that because of the fact that the BIT applies to
investments existing at the time of its entry into force, the
temporal effects of its clauses are not modified.%9

The non-retroactivity of the BIT excludes its application to
disputes arising prior to its entry into force. Any dispute arising
prior to that date will not be capable of being submitted to the
dispute resolution system established by the BIT. The silence of
the text of the BIT with respect to its scope in relation to disputes
prior to its entry into force does not alter the effects of the
principle of the non-retroactivity of treaties.“

The Tribunal observes that prior dispute may evolve into a new
dispute, but the fact that this new dispute has arisen does not
change the effects of the non-retroactivity of the BIT with respect
to the dispute prior to its entry into force. Prior disputes that
continue after the entry into force of the BIT are not covered by
the BIT.441

The Tribunal observes that the existence of a breach of a norm of
customary international law before a BIT enters into force does
not give one a right to have recourse to the BIT’s arbitral
jurisdiction. A case in point is the Mondev v. United States of
America case in which the tribunal pointed out the difference
between a claim made under a Treaty and a diplomatic protection
claim for conduct contrary to customary law."#42

The present Tribunal notes that the Mondev case was under the provisions of the NAFTA
Treaty which limit the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals to the matters specifically
mentioned in that Treaty.

As to the ad hoc Committee, without pronouncing on the correctness of the tribunal's
reasoning, it concluded that "the Applicants have not shown that the Tribunal
manifestly exceeded its powers by failing to exercise its jurisdiction over the accounts
receivable."48

On the other hand, a somewhat different analysis appears to have been made in the
Chevron case,4“4 which contains a definition of "dispute" practically identical to the one
found in the Generation Ukraine case. In that case, the tribunal concluded that the dispute
had arisen and that "the Claimants based their claims on post-BIT conduct and
commenced the arbitration after entry into force of the BIT" and proceeded to render a
decision on that basis. Nonetheless, the tribunal discussed more broadly the issue of
jurisdiction over disputes. Like in the present case, while there was a temporal
restriction concerning "investments", there was no such reference as to "disputes". In the
circumstances, the tribunal expressed the view that "(t)hus, the BIT covers any dispute
as long as it is a dispute arising out of or relating to "investment existing at the time of
entry into force". In support of its opinion, the tribunal quoted, in particular, the ILC
Commentary of Sir Arthur Watts, who wrote: "This is not to give retroactive effect to the
agreement because, by using the word "disputes" without any qualification, the parties
are to be understood as accepting jurisdiction with respect to all disputes existing after
the entry into force of the agreement."

Reference is often made to the Mavrommatis case“*5 decided by the Permanent Court of
International Justice and dealing with Protocol XII to the Treaty of Lausanne. In that
case, the United Kingdom pleaded, inter alia, that the acts complained of occurred before
the Treaty had come into force. The Court ruled that the Treaty applied retroactively to
breaches that occurred before that event. It said in particular:

"The Court is of the opinion that, in case of doubt, jurisdiction
based on an international agreement embraces all disputes

referred to it after its establishment. [...] The reservations made in
many arbitration treaties regarding disputes arising out of events
previous to the conclusion of the treaty seems to prove the
necessity for an explicit limitation of jurisdiction."

However, it is important to note that, in that case, the very nature of the Protocol, if it
was to have real substance, required retroactive application. As the Court said:

"An essential characteristic therefore of Protocol XII is that its
effects extend to legal situations dating from a time previous to its
own existence. If provision were not made in the clauses of the
Protocol for the protection of the rights recognized therein as
against infringements before the coming into force of that
instrument, the Protocol would be ineffective as regards the very
period at which the rights in question are most in need of
protection."#47

465. In the subsequent case of Ambatielos,48 the International Court of Justice adopted a
somewhat different line. It rejected Greece’s contention that under a Treaty of 1926 it
was entitled to present a claim based on acts which had taken place in 1922 and 1923.
The Court stated in particular:

"To accept this theory would mean giving retroactive effect to
Article 29 of the Treaty of 1026, whereas Article 32 of this Treaty
states that the Treaty, which must mean all the provisions of the
Treaty, shall come into force immediately upon ratification. Such a
conclusion might have been rebutted if there had been any special
clause or any special object necessitating _ retroactive
interpretation. There is no such clause or object in the present
case. It is therefore impossible to hold than any of its provisions
must be deemed to have been in force earlier."

466. It is worth noting that those cases pre-dated the adoption of the Vienna Convention. In
its Third Report on the Law of Treaties, Sir Humphrey Waldock had this to say on the
issue on the retroactive application of dispute resolution clauses:

"L...] when a jurisdictional clause is found not in a treaty of
arbitration or judicial settlement but attached to the substantive
clauses of a treaty as a means of securing their due application, the
non-retroactivity principle does operate indirectly to limit ratione
temporis the application of the jurisdictional clause. The reason is
that the "disputes" with which the clause is concerned are ex

hypothesi limited to "disputes" regarding the interpretation and
application of the substantive provisions of the treaty which [...]
do not normally extend to matters occurring before the treaty
came into force. In short, the disputes clause will only cover pre-
treaty occurrences in exceptional cases, like Protocol XII to the
Treaty of Lausanne [...]"

The Tribunal is of the view that the wording of Article 6 of the Treaty should not be
interpreted as granting it jurisdiction concerning disputes which arose after the entry
into force but which are based on actions that have occurred before such entry into force,
except for the particular situation of continuing or composite acts. Such conclusion
applies not only concerning the substantive provisions of the Treaty but also as to resort
to customary international law. Even in a situation where, in a particular dispute, the
State concerned would have waived objections to jurisdiction, there is a question as to
whether an arbitral tribunal could exercise such jurisdiction, as noted in the Generation
Ukraine case, the matter becoming one to be addressed as a diplomatic protection claim
or as an ordinary commercial dispute to be resolved under private law before the
appropriate judiciary. Obviously, the situation would be read differently in situations
where the tribunal is given specific jurisdiction to deal with disputes relating to events
preceding a treaty, like in the case of the U.S.-Iran Claims Tribunal which was called
upon to address only such disputes.4°

The Treaty has to be read "in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the
terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose", to quote
Article 31 of the Vienna Convention. While it is true that there is no temporal restriction
to the word "disputes" in Article 6 of the Treaty, this is no reason to give that Article an
extensive interpretation which takes it well beyond the general scope of the Treaty. In
entering into it, the Contracting Parties entitled investments by investors of the other
Contracting Party made after 1949 and before the entry into force of the Treaty to claim
the same protection as that granted to investments made subsequent to its entry into
force. By providing that disputes could be resolved by arbitration, after an attempt at
negotiations, the Contracting Parties empowered arbitral tribunals to consider disputes
which would come within the ambit of the Treaty, including the application of general
international law. But it is a far stretch to conclude, unless there is a clear provision to
that effect, that a tribunal would have been granted jurisdiction to rule on events going
as far back as 1949. The Contracting Parties cannot be assumed to have allowed a
situation whereby an investor could, after the entry into force of the Treaty, simply
manufacture a dispute with a Contracting Party concerning events which would have
occurred, say in 1955, and an arbitral tribunal would have jurisdiction to rule on such
events. Such an interpretation appears to the Tribunal to be far beyond what could have
been the intention of the Contracting States when they entered into the Treaty. Article 28
of the Vienna Convention (already quoted) referring to the intention of the contracting
parties makes no distinction between the provisions of a treaty dealing with substantive
rights and those dealing with procedural rights.

In the present instance, from the limited and often conflicting evidence submitted by the
Parties (most of it at the Hearing itself), the Tribunal can see that negotiations took place
during 2001 between GEM and Respondent concerning the possibility for GEM to obtain
a stability agreement on taxation. Those negotiations did not lead to an agreement and
GEM did not pursue the matter or raise the absence of an agreement to the level of a
dispute before the initiation of the present arbitration. Between the failure of the
Negotiations and the enactment of the WPT in 2006, neither Claimants nor GEM took
any specific action in that regard.

Claimants have argued, previous to their Post-Hearing Brief that, among other things,
the WPT constituted a discriminatory action because it treated GEM differently from
Boroo Gold which benefited from a stability agreement reached before the entry into
force of the Treaty. The Tribunal has to decide whether that alleged discrimination in
terms of the WPT treatment was in contravention of the Treaty and of Article 42 of the
Washington Convention, and not whether the failure of Mongolia to grant GEM a
stability agreement in 2001 itself constituted an impermissible discriminatory treatment.
The Boroo agreement existed before the entry into force of the Treaty and the Tribunal
has no jurisdiction to consider the consequences of the failure of the Parties to conclude
a stability agreement in 2001, unless Claimants can demonstrate that such is covered by
the doctrine of continuous or composite acts.

However, for the purpose of completeness of its analysis and bearing in mind the
different views among arbitral decisions and legal authorities on the subject and the fact
that, at the request of the Tribunal, the Parties have extensively discussed the issue, the
Tribunal wishes to proceed with an analysis of Claimants’ claim, assuming that it could
have jurisdiction to consider a dispute arising after the entry into force of the Treaty but
relating to facts or events anterior to the Treaty. In that case, it is clear from the above
comments that only customary international law, and not the substantive provisions of
the Treaty, could apply.

C - Even in the absence of a limitation ratione temporis, the Tribunal would not have
found a breach of customary international law.

On the basis of the facts submitted, the Tribunal has concluded that an application for a
stabilization agreement did take place. A letter from GEM to the Mongolian Ministry of
Finance and Economy‘*! made such a request on May 3, 2001 and, on May 23, 2001, in
another letter45? GEM repeated the same request. That letter noted in particular that the
approved model agreement guaranteed stability of taxation only with respect to certain
taxes not covering all of the taxes applicable to the gold mining industry. Although such
letters were produced only at the time of Claimants’ Reply, their existence was not
contested by Respondent.

On May 17, 2001, the Ministry of Finance and Economy responded to the first letter by
providing a form stability agreement covering only five specific types of taxes,

41 CE-131.

452 CE-96,

474,

476.

-112-

consistent with the model stability agreement.%3 Claimants recognize that that form
would not have covered a new tax such as the WPT. During the course of discussions
which lasted several months, GEM expressly asked that the stability agreement fix all
taxes payable by GEM. In its letter of June 23, 2001,4* it stated that "[...] The agreement
should provide for the stability of tax regime existing as of the date of the stability
agreement, covering 15 taxes, and to fix not only the tax rates for each tax, but also
concessions available for each tax under the applicable tax laws that are in effect at the
date of the stability agreement." In addition, GEM requested that any future reduction in
taxes or new tax concessions subsequent to the stability agreement be passed on to
GEM.

It is to be noted that such an exchange of letter took place roughly one year after a
foreign-owned gold producer in Mongolia obtained an amendment to its own stability
agreement granting it full protection against any future tax increases in exchange for a
significant commitment of future investment. At no time was GEM made aware of the
May 9, 2000 amendment to Boroo Gold’s stability agreement which went beyond the
1997 Model Stability Agreement.45 Respondent has established however that the terms
of that Agreement were reported in the specialized press in 2000 and also appeared in
the 2002 SEC filing of Cameco Corp., the Canadian company indirectly controlling
Boroo Gold at the time.‘5” Claimants challenge the validity of the Boroo Gold stability
agreement and argue, at the same time, that they were the subject of unfair and unequal
treatment by not being able to benefit from the same generous agreement as Boroo Gold.
For its part, Mongolia argues that Article 20 of the 1997 Minerals Law entailed an
obligation to protect parties to stability agreement against the imposition of new taxes
such as the WPT and that, if GEM had signed a stability agreement, it would have been
entitled to benefit from that provision.458

The validity of the Boroo Gold agreement is not a matter that is coming under the
jurisdiction of this Tribunal and therefore will not be addressed here. However, again
assuming that the Tribunal would have jurisdiction over disputes concerning events
preceding the entry into force of the Treaty, the argument about unfair treatment would
be one that could be properly raised, the question being whether Boroo Gold and GEM
were in similar situations.

As mentioned before, Boroo Gold committed to substantial investment in the future.
Claimants argue that, prior to their application, they had made much larger investments
than Boroo Gold before its own application. But the argument is misplaced; stability
agreements generally look to the future. They represent a commitment by a State not to
raise taxes affecting a particular investor in exchange for forward-looking commitments

(essentially financial) which will bring significant economic development benefits to that
State. Claimants have not been able to show any stability agreement between an investor
and Mongolia which would grant the relevant tax benefits as a reward for past
investments and Mongolia stated that there are no such stability agreements. Claimants
argue that Article9 of the Treaty protects past investments. The Tribunal does not
disagree with this interpretation of the Treaty but this is quite different from saying that
stability agreements must retroactively reward investors for past investments; no such
provision can be read into the Treaty and, unless an investor can point to a specific
provision in that regard in the local legislation (and this clearly was not the case in
Mongolia), it is a matter of policy for a State to decide if it wishes to enter into such
agreements.

Respondent argues that GEM was not willing to commit to future investments, even to
the tune of the minimum USD 2 million required under the law.‘ For their part,
Claimants argue that the "Working Group set up for the negotiations of this agreement
explained that the stability agreement can only be entered into based on the approved
form."40

First, did Claimants ever commit to future investments, like Boroo Gold did? In its
letters of May 3, and August 13, 2001, GEM stated that: "As our investment program has
been developed for a long period extending into the future [...]"46! and "As our company
has already invested significant funds in Mongolia and is planning further investments
[...] 4 It would therefore appear that GEM was considering investment in the future and
did not rely only on its past investments, in its application for a stability agreement, but,
by themselves, those statements are merely of a general nature and could not be
considered to represent a commitment to future investment.

The letter of May 23, 2001 from GEM to the Minister of Finance and Economy refers to a
draft stability agreement attached in two copies but such an attachment was not
produced at the same time as the letter itself.43

As already mentioned, the content of the Negotiations has been the subject of
considerable debate between the Parties. At first, Respondent claimed in its Defense
that, if GEM was not exempt from the WPT, it was because it had not requested a
stability agreement. In their Reply, Claimants stated that, after having requested from
Respondent the production of documents relating to such a request and being told that
none existed in its files, it proceeded to make a further search for documents. The
Claimants produced a number of documents which they succeeded in retrieving from a
box found at GEM headquarters. As mentioned above, the letter of May 23, 2001 was

produced without its attachment and the Tribunal has received no evidence to the effect
that the draft stability agreement designated as CE-215 was ever sent to and received by
Respondent. In its Statement of Defense, Respondent argued that GEM had not been
willing to commit to future investments.‘ In a letter to Respondent in November 2008
(not produced before the Tribunal but not contested by Respondent), Claimants
transmitted to it a draft stability agreement dated "June 2001" (subsequently identified as
CE-215 when submitted to the Tribunal at the Hearing) which would allegedly have
constituted the attachment to the letter of May 23, 2001 sent to the Minister of Finance.
Claimants produced at the Hearing that draft stability agreement. That document is
much more specific than the previous letters. In particular, it does contain a commitment
to a minimum investment of USD 5 million over the subsequent five years and provides
for a firm engagement by Mongolia to "maintaining the taxation existing as of the date of
this agreement." At the Hearing,*°5 Counsel for Claimants stated that "this document
was provided to Mongolia with other stability agreements that were found in a box at
GEM headquarters. The documents in the box were not organized - they’re 7 or 8 years
old - but we pulled down all the documents we could find and the second paragraph it
says "please find attached to this letter a draft stability agreement." [...] It is a draft
stability agreement that we indicated in our response letter to Mongolia’s Counsel which
we sent on December 10th that we believe could be the attachment to this because it was
the only other draft stability agreement we found in the box of documents. But we could
not say with 100% certainty because it was not actually affixed to the letter." Counsel for
Respondent argued that there was no evidence that the document in question was
actually sent to Respondent at any time. The Tribunal accepted its production, subject to
whatever evidentiary value could be derived from it.

In his Witness Statement of 17 February 2009, Mr. N. Tumendemberel, who was State
Secretary at the Ministry of Finance when GEM asked for the possibility of a stability
agreement, stated the following: "After receiving a draft stability agreement from GEM,
we established a Working Group to consider this request. [...] I was directed by the
Minister to lead the that would consider this request. The Working Group closely
reviewed the application and draft stability agreement from GEM." He claims that the
refused to approve the GEM proposal because "[...] GEM would not first agree to invest
additional money into Mongolia".467 He noted that "GEM wanted to use past
investments as the basis for this agreement" and added that there were also "problems
with the value of the equipment that GEM officials wanted to use as an investment."469
He also challenged Mr. Paushok’s assertion that the Working Group would not agree to
a stability agreement because GEM wanted to add some more specific taxes to the
agreement. In his view, "[t]he issue of extra taxes was not the basis for this decision" and,

in any event, the 2001 amendment to the General Taxation Law assured protection
against all tax increases subsequent to a stability agreement.!””

The other witness which discussed stability agreements was Mr. B. Ganbat, who is
Director General of the Legal Department of the Ministry of Finance and who has been
in the employment of that Department since 1995. In his testimony, he asserted that the
Mining Law of Mongolia could not grant stability agreements for past investments. Like
Mr. Tumendemberel, he was a member of the Working Group responsible for reviewing
GEM’s request for a stability agreement. Somewhat surprisingly, he also stated in his
oral pleading that, while preparing his Witness Statement, the only document he found
in searching the Ministry’s file on GEM’s application for a stability agreement was a
copy of the Government order creating the Working Group,47! although he corrected
himself shortly after”? by saying that the file did not contain the text of any stability
agreement but that "there was correspondence and there was letters sent from the GEM
to the Ministry of Finance regarding the stability agreement issue"; yet at the same time,
he reaffirmed that he had not found copy of a letter dated May 17, 2001 and signed by
the Deputy Minister of Finance acknowledging receipt of GEM’s letter proposing
negotiations for a stability agreement. He added that,‘ although he was acquainted
with the 1997 model stability agreement,4# he had never come across a draft stability
agreement either in the form of CE-127 or CE-215, until they were shown to him at the
Hearing. He had stated in his Second Witness Statement of 22 September 2008 that
"Claimants have not submitted request for stability agreement under the 1997 Mining
Law or the 2006 amendment."475

As for Claimants, Mr. V. Paushok, in his Third Witness Statement of 28 March 2008,
states that he "applied for a stability agreement not only in respect of KOO
Vostokneftegaz (Vostokneftegaz) but in respect of Koo Golden East Mongolia (GEM)."76
He produces, in the case of the first company, a copy of the Stability Agreement of
March 26, 2002 between that company and the Government of Mongolia,!”7 and, in
support of the second, the letter of May 3, 2001 to the Ministry of Finance and
Economics.‘ He then contends that no agreement was signed between GEM and
Respondent because the Mongolian authorities were not willing to make any change to

the model stability agreement, stability being "only guaranteed with regard to some of
the existing taxes as at the time of the agreement..4”?

During his examination by Counsel for each side, no question was raised about the draft
stability agreements allegedly exchanged between the Parties.489 Respondent
concentrated instead on the 2002 Vostokneftgaz Stability Agreement which was
obtained by Claimants. The model agreement for the mining industry states that the rate
of corporate income tax, VAT and gasoline and diesel fuel taxes shall remain fixed at the
rates in effect at the time when the agreement is executed. In addition, equipment and
heavy machinery which are imported are exempt from customs duty and VAT and the
VAT on goods, works and services which are exported is set at zero.48! The agreement
reached concerning Vostokneftgaz provide for more generous treatment than the model
agreement. That agreement which extended over a period of 15 years provided that the
company would pay no corporate income tax in its first five years of production, and
would benefit from a 50% discount from the rate in the next following five years. In
addition, the company was granted lower tax and excise rates on gasoline and diesel
fuel than provided in the model agreement. Finally, the company was granted the same
exemptions as in the model agreement on imports and exports. In exchange, the
company committed to a USD 50 million investment over the first three years of the
agreement. According to Mr. B. Ganbat’s testimony, Vostokneftgaz failed to make the
required investments in 2006 and 2007 and is in breach of the agreement. None of this
was contested by Claimants.

The Tribunal is confronted with conflicting statements from the Parties and with
evidence that leaves room for speculation.

In the case of CE-215 in particular, not a word has come from witnesses for Claimants
about its existence or its authenticity and Counsel for Claimants have themselves stated
that they could not confirm that that document was in fact transmitted to the Mongolian
authorities. However, it seems established at least that Respondent transmitted to GEM
a draft stability agreement dated June 19, 2001482 which was a filled-in form agreement,
and covered exemptions of five specific types of taxes, consistent with the applicable
model stability agreement, in exchange for a commitment by GEM to invest
USD 1 million a year over the next five years. The fact is that no agreement was ever
signed. GEM could have been satisfied with the concessions offered by Respondent and
taken its chances on future negotiations about further investment but it decided
otherwise, as it was entitled to do.

The question then is: Was Mongolia obligated to reach with GEM an agreement on the
same terms as the one concluded with Boroo Gold, on May 9, 2000? The Tribunal does
not believe that this was the case.

First of all, there is a certain element of administrative discretion in the negotiation of
such agreements; the concessions granted by a government will very much depend on
the size of the investment contemplated. In the case of Boroo Gold, if one ignores
previous investments, as argued by Respondent, Boroo Gold committed to investing
some USD 24 million, between July 2000 and July 2003 (USD 9 million in cash and
USD 15 million in other forms). This is significantly superior to the USD 5 million over
five years mentioned in CE-127.

Secondly, the arrival of Boroo Gold (it had arrived earlier but its investment represented
only about USD 1 million by the time of the 2000 agreement), represented the arrival of a
new player in gold mining, a sector considered strategic by Mongolia. In fact, Boroo
Gold quickly became the largest gold producer in Mongolia (GEM being the second). It
would be understandable that, in such circumstances, there would have been a strong
incentive for Mongolia to make exceptional concessions in favor of Boroo Gold in return
for a commitment to substantial investment over the following three years..

In light of the above, the Tribunal concludes that, even if it had been called upon to rule
on the Negotiations, it would, in any event, have decided that the evidence submitted to
it is not sufficient for the Tribunal to conclude that the actions of Respondent in that
connection were of such a nature as to constitute a breach of customary international
law, whether it be because of bad faith, discrimination or on any other ground.

5.5.3.4 Does the doctrine of continuing acts and composite acts allow the
Tribunal to adjudicate on the 2001 facts?

Apart from cases where a treaty would provide for retrospective application, the only
qualification to the principle of non-retroactivity has to do with the case of so-called
continuing or composite acts.

Notably, in Tecmed v. Mexico,4% the tribunal wrote:

"Conduct, acts or omissions of the Respondent which, though they
happened before the entry into force [of the BIT] may be
considered as constituting part, concurrent factor or aggravating
or mitigating element of conduct or acts or omissions of the
Respondent which took place after such date do fall within the
scope of this Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction.

This is so, provided such conduct or acts, upon consummation or
completion of their consummation after the entry into force of the
Agreement constitute a breach of the Agreement, and particularly
if the conduct, acts or omissions prior to December 18, 1996, could
not reasonably have been fully assessed by the Claimant in their
significance and effects when they took place, either because as
the Agreement was not in force they could not be considered

- 118-

within the framework of a possible claim under its provisions or
because it was not possible to assess them within the general
context of conduct attributable to the Respondent in connection
with the investment, the key point of which led to violations of the
Agreement following its entry into force."

493. Similarly, in Société Générale v. Dominican Republic,*4 the tribunal expressed the situation
in these words:

"The Tribunal accordingly concludes that to the extent that on the
consideration of the merits an act is proved to have originated
before the critical date but continues as such to be in existence
after that date, amounting to a breach of a Treaty obligation in
force at the time it occurs, it will come within the Tribunal's
jurisdiction. This will also be the case if the series of acts results in
the aggregate that such a breach of an obligation in force at the
time the accumulation culminates after the critical date."

494. It must be noted however that such situations are far from opening the door to
retrospective application of treaty provisions, when the treaty itself does not provide for
it. The Société Générale tribunal took great care to clarify that situation:485

"87. The Tribunal is persuaded, however, that there might be
situations in which the continuing nature of the acts and
events questioned could result in a breach as a result of acts
commencing before the critical date but which only become
legally characterized as a wrongful act in violation of an
international obligation when such an obligation had come
into existence after the effective date of the treaty. The
tribunals in MCI, Feldman and Mondev, while not accepting
jurisdiction over acts and events preceding the date of entry
into force of the treaty, nevertheless did not exclude the
consideration of prior acts for "purposes of understanding
the background, the causes, or scope of the violations of the
BIT that occurred after the entry into force" or the relevance
of prior events to breaches taking place after the treaty's
entry into force.

88. In such a case, the act _is indeed continuous but its legal

materialization as a breach occurs when the Treaty has come
into force and the investor qualifies under its requirements.
...]" [emphasis added]

It follows that the Tribunal must be satisfied that there could
be a breach of obligations under the Treaty for jurisdiction
over treaty violations to be established, and this again can
only happen once the obligation has come into force. The
actual determination of which acts specifically meet the
continuing requirement is a matter for the merits because it
is only then that it can be decided which acts amount to
breaches and when this took place. At the jurisdictional stage
only the principle can be identified.

The same reasoning applies to composite acts. While
normally acts will take place at a given point in time
independently of their continuing effects, and they might at
that point be wrongful or not, it is conceivable also that there
might be situations in which each act considered in isolation
will not _result_in_a breach of a treaty obligation, but _if
considered as a part of a series of acts leading in the same

direction they could result in a breach at the end of the
process of aggregation, when the treaty obligation will have
come into force. This is what normally will happen in
situations in which creeping or indirect expropriation is
found, and could also be the case with a denial of justice as a
result of undue delays in judging a case by a municipal
court. As noted in Article15 of the Articles on State
Responsibility, the series of actions or omissions must be
defined in the aggregate as wrongful and when taken
together it "is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act". But of
course the latter determination can only be made when the
obligation is in force. [emphasis added]

 

In situations of this kind, the preceding acts might be
relevant as factual background to the violation that takes
place after the critical date, and this is the meaning that the
cases discussed above will have in considering that factual
background and its relevance to explain later breaches. As
the Respondent has rightly recalled, this explains why in
Tecmed, while often believed to have assumed jurisdiction
over acts preceding the treaty, this was only to the effect that
such acts represented "converging action towards the same
result". In such a situation, the obligations of the treaty will
not be applied retroactively but only to acts that will be the
final result of that convergence and which take place when

the treaty has come into force. [emphasis added]

Articles 14-15 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility and the Commentary to those
Articles formulate the same principles.

In its Commentary to Article 14 (2) , the ILC states about continuing acts:

"L...], a continuing wrongful act, on the other hand, occupies the
entire period during which the act continues and remains not in
conformity with the international obligation, provided that the
State is bound by the international obligation during that
period."48°

Discussing Article 15 dealing with composite acts, the Commentary states, in particular:

"[...] The State must be bound by the international obligation for
the period during which the series of acts making up the breach is
committed. In cases where the relevant obligation did not exist at
the beginning of the course of conduct but came into being
thereafter, the "first" of the action or omissions of the series for the
purposes of State responsibility will be the first occurring after the
obligation came into existence."487

In the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that the Negotiations cannot be seen as a
continuing act. Those Negotiations were a discrete event in the course of the relations
between GEM and Respondent which lasted for a few months during 2001. There is no
evidence that GEM raised the issue again at any time between 2001 and 2006, although
there was nothing preventing it from doing so and in spite of the fact that one of
Claimants! subsidiary (Vostokneftegaz) did conclude a stability agreement with
Respondent one year later, in 2002. In fact, GEM later opted for a different strategy in its
attempts to avoid having to pay the WPT: the Safe Custody/Sale and Purchase of
Precious Metal Agreement with MongolBank.

The Tribunal is equally of the view that the Negotiations are not part of composite acts.
As noted in the Société Générale case, this argument is usually raised in the context of
allegations of creeping or indirect expropriation or of denial of justice. The evidence
presented by the Parties on the subject of the Negotiations cannot support a conclusion
that the failure to arrive at the signing of a stability agreement in 2001 was part of a
series of actions by Respondent which, taken together, would lead the Tribunal to the
conclusion that there has been a breach of the Treaty on the basis of composite acts. This
is even more so in a context where nothing special affecting GEM occurred between 2001
and 2006, when the WPT was adopted by the Great Khural, a measure that the Tribunal
has concluded was not in breach of the Treaty. Contrary to the situation in the Tecmed

case, the Tribunal cannot see in the present case a series of acts representing "converging
action towards the same result.488

Those 2001 events cannot qualify as continuing or composite acts or omissions leading to
breaches of the Treaty after the entry into force of the Treaty, some five years later.

5.5.4 CONCLUSION

In light of the above, the Tribunal therefore rejects, first of all, the argument of
Respondent to the effect that the absence of a stability agreement prevents Claimants
from making a claim in connection with the enactment and the enforcement of the WPT;
the Tribunal equally rejects Claimants' argument to the effect that Respondent would
have waived objection to jurisdiction in connection with their separate claim that the
Tribunal would have the authority to hear a claim concerning the 2001 Negotiations
themselves. Apart from the issue of continuing or composite acts discussed above, the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction to rule on the Negotiations that took place in 2001; and,
even assuming that it would have had jurisdiction, the Tribunal would not have found a
breach of customary international law in connection with the Negotiations. Finally, the
Tribunal has concluded that the Negotiations did not constitute continuing or composite
acts.

THE SAFE CUSTODY AND SALE AGREEMENT
5.6.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES

5.6.11 Claimants' standing, exhaustion of local remedies and the alleged
illegality of the SCSA

Claimants argue that Respondent violated Articles 2, 3 and, in some cases, 4 of the
Treaty through its conduct regarding the SCSA because:

(A) __ In the first half of 2007, MongolBank recorded the gold deposited by GEM as sold
and owned by Mongolia, exported it, and provided for its refinement without
GEM's knowledge and permission, the whole in violation of Clause 4 of the
SCSA, which provides that ownership to the deposited gold shall pass to
MongolBank only upon delivery of a Metal Sale Letter on or before December 25,
2007.489

Claimants also submit that the foregoing amounts not only to a violation of the
[imported] umbrella clause but also to the violation of the FET, non-impairment
and full legal protection and security standards.4%

MongolBank "purchased" 1.9Tons of GEM's chemically pure gold (ie. the
Remaining Gold) even though GEM required the return of that Remaining Gold,
the whole in violation of the SCSA and Mongolian law;4%!

Claimants also submit that the foregoing amounts not only to a violation of the
[imported] umbrella clause but also to the violation of the FET, non-impairment,
full legal protection and security‘? and non-expropriation standards.

Tax authorities taxed GEM's deliveries of gold for safekeeping with MongolBank
as sales (the First Tax Assessment) and that interpretation was upheld by
Mongolian courts, namely the Capital Administrative Court‘! and the Supreme
Court of Mongolia,4% which amounts to a denial of justice.4%

Under a separate heading, Claimants add that Respondent breached Article 4 of
the Treaty because the First Tax Assessment (regarding the gold deposited with
MongolBank) is expropriatory (even if the WPT itself is not) as it was imposed in
contravention of Mongolian law.1%”

Alternatively, assuming that the Mongolian courts' interpretation is correct (i.e.
MongolBank became the owner of the deposited gold upon its delivery by
operation of the Law on Treasury and the Law on Central Bank), (i) MongolBank
entered into an impermissible agreement (an agreement it could not perform in
accordance with its terms) with GEM and (ii) MongolBank failed to perform its
contractual obligations relating to its commitment to be GEM's tax agent, which
amounts to a violation of the umbrella clause, FET and full legal protection and
security standards.*8

503. Respondent raises lack of jurisdiction ratione personae as Claimants are not parties to the
SCSA and only GEM, which is not and could not be a party to these arbitral
proceedings, has standing with regard to the contractual claims concerning the SCSA.

Thus, "Claimants are not the proper claimant even were there an umbrella clause in the
Treaty".4°

504. Claimants respond that the foregoing objection is unfounded as (i) all their claims

relating to the SCSA are Treaty claims (rather than contract claims); (ii) Claimants!

claims under the umbrella clause are Treaty claims despite the fact that they are based
on conduct that also violates the SCSA; (iii) the umbrella clause does not require that the
obligation "with regard to investments" be between the host State and the investor.50

Respondent further raises lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae and argues that Claimants
do not have standing with regard to the contractual claims against MongolBank due to
the lack of exhaustion of local contractual remedies by GEM as required by the forum
selection clause , ie. Claimants failed to cause GEM to sue MongolBank for the return of
the gold before local courts and proceeded with this arbitration before the expiration of
the SCSA.501

Respondent further adds that the specific wording of the dispute resolution clause
(Article 9) required the parties to seize the local courts with a request to remedy the lack

of a provision regulating the return of the gold and that Claimants have no claim unless
a Mongolian court modifies the SCSA, adding a provision which would impose on
MongolBank the obligation to return the gold. Failing such a modification, MongolBank
could not have violated the SCSA by failing to return the gold to GEM.502

Claimants argue that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to decide, in accordance with
Mongolian law, whether MongolBank breached the SCSA in order to address Claimants!
Treaty claims arising under the umbrella clause and so, notwithstanding the forum
selection clause in favor of Mongolian courts.53 Claimants further point out that the
Treaty does not impose the requirement to exhaust domestic remedies.5"

Claimants also submit that Respondent's "gap theory" fails as, under Mongolian law,
matters not expressly addressed in an agreement are regulated by the provisions of
generally applicable Mongolian legislation, including the Mongolian Civil Code and "a
gap is only said to arise if the matter cannot be addressed even by application of those
provisions." Moreover, the "gap theory" would be inapplicable to claim (a) as the SCSA
specifies when MongolBank becomes the owner of the deposited gold.55 In any event,
Mongolian courts, namely the Capital Administrative Court and the Supreme Court of
Mongolia,5°” had decided the issue of the ownership of the Gold (and thus, by necessary
implication, the issue of GEM's right to have the Remaining Gold returned) prior to
December 25, 2007 by stating that GEM sold the Gold upon delivery to MongolBank.58

In addition, Respondent asserts that Claimants do not have standing to bring claims
with respect to the First Tax Assessment because the SCSA is illegal as it had been
entered into for the sole purpose of tax evasion.5

With respect to the alleged illegality of the SCSA, Claimants note that (i) the SCSA is not
illegal; (ii) even if the SCSA were illegal, Mongolia is estopped from raising this
objection as its tax authorities, courts and central bank treated the SCSA as legal; (iii) any
potential illegality of the SCSA would not rise to the level of a violation of fundamental
legal principles of Mongolia and (iv) Mongolia does not meet the standard of irrefutable
proof with respect to its allegations of illegality.51°

5.6.1.2 Nature of the SCSA and Mongolia's liability for the actions of
MongolBank

Respondent submits that the SCSA cannot give rise to a Treaty claim as it was an
agreement jure gestionis, i.e. the SCSA is a transaction commercial in nature and as such
cannot give rise to state responsibility (contrary to an act jure imperii).5"

Relying on Eureko BV v. Poland5!2, Claimants respond that the distinction between acts
jure gestionis and jure imperii does not apply with respect to the claims raised under an
umbrella clause.53

Regardless of the foregoing argument, Claimants submit that MongolBank is an organ of
the Mongolian state within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the International Law
Commission's 2001 Articles on State Responsibility, and its conduct is attributable to
Mongolia. Further, the acts of MongolBank constitute acts jure imperii for which
Mongolia can be held liable.5!4

5.6.1.3 MEN and umbrella clauses

Respondent points out that the Treaty contains no umbrella clause.*'5 However,
Claimants invoke the MFN clause in Article 3(2) of the Treaty in order to import an

Claimants make reference, in particular, to the U.S.-Mongolia Treaty5!6 which contains
the following umbrella clause (Article II, 2(c)):

"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with regard to investments."

Claimants also invoke the benefit of Article 2(3) of the Denmark-Mongolia BIT and
Article 2(2) of the U.K.-Mongolia BIT, which contain similar wording.

Respondent argues that Claimants cannot introduce an umbrella clause imported from
another treaty because the MFN clause is narrow in scope, being limited to the
"operation and disposal of investment" (and, thus, does not extend to the use and
enjoyment of same) as per Article 3 (1) of the Treaty.5!”

Furthermore, Respondent is of the view that an "MFN clause cannot import an entirely
new protection into the Treaty" such as an umbrella clause which creates "a new kind of
protection in BITs by transforming non-actionable contractual breaches by state
instrumentalities into Treaty violations."=18.

Echoing its argument regarding Mongolia's liability for the alleged breaches of the
SCSA, Respondent also states that even if an umbrella clause could have been imported
into the Treaty, it would still be of no avail to Claimants as an umbrella clause provides
no protection against acts jure gestionis (as opposed to acts jure imperii) such as those of
MongolBank.5!9

5.6.1.4 Substantive claims

In sum, Claimants argue that Mongolia violated Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty because:
Claim (a): MongolBank recorded the gold deposited by GEM as owned by Mongolia,
exported it, and provided for its refinement without GEM's knowledge and permission;
Claim (b): MongolBank "purchased" 1.9 tons of GEM's chemically pure gold even
though GEM required return of that gold; Claim (c): the tax authorities taxed GEM!
deliveries of gold for safekeeping with MongolBank as sales, an interpretation sustained
by Mongolian Courts; subsidiarily, Claim (d): MongolBank entered into an
impermissible agreement with GEM.

In relation to Claim (b) and (c), Claimants also argue that Respondent breached Article 4
of the Treaty because MongolBank expropriated (by refusing to return) the Remaining
Gold and because the First Tax Assessment (regarding the gold deposited with
MongolBank) is expropriatory (even if the WPT itself is not).52°

Respondent argues that Articles 2, 3 and 4 of the Treaty have not been breached as the
SCSA was performed by MongolBank according to its terms and the tax consequences of
the SCSA had been correctly assessed by the tax authorities and Mongolian courts.
Respondent's position rests on the following assertions:52!

(1)

(2)

(6)

Claimants sought to evade taxes by formality in denial of the economic substance
of the transaction.522

The SCSA is an innominate contract with the purpose of achieving a complex
sale transaction.

The refining and storage of the gold outside of Mongolia did not violate the
SCSA.52

GEM did not have the right to demand the return of [purchase back] the
Remaining Gold from MongolBank.525

Tax authorities and Mongolian courts correctly concluded that the transaction
contemplated by the SCSA met all the criteria of International Accounting
Standard 18 and, thus, constituted a taxable event subject to the WPT and other
taxes®6, Respondent further adds that tax authorities did not rely on
MongolBank's recording of the gold as having been sold to it for the purpose of
the First Tax Assessment.52”

MongolBank had a duty to withhold taxes in its quality of GEM's tax agent
(otherwise GEM would have incurred penalties and interest for late payment),528
except for prepayments.52?

As a further defense, Respondent argues that Claimants' tax related SCSA claims must
fail because (i) Claimants' complaints with regard to the judicial decisions of Mongolian
courts with regard to the imposition of taxes on the pre-payment for gold delivered to
MongolBank do not meet the requirements of a denial of justice claim; (ii) the judicial
decisions at stake are correct as a matter of substance and (iii) Claimants do not allege
any procedural improprieties.5%

With regard to Claimants' expropriation claim, Respondent raises the argument that the
SCSA was performed according to its terms, that GEM received full contractual
compensation for the deposited gold and had agreed that taxes due on the proceeds of
sale be paid by MongolBank to the Mongolian treasury. It therefore concludes that no
expropriation of GEM's gold had occurred.531

5.6.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS

On July 19, 2006, GEM and MongolBank entered into the SCSA, which was amended by
a Supplementary Agreement dated October 5, 2006, extending the duration of the
Agreement until 25 December 2007.

The Tribunal will address first the nature of the SCSA and the alleged breach thereof by
MongolBank, then the issue of jurisdiction and admissibility (Claims (a) and (b)) as well
as the action of MongolBank entering into an allegedly impermissible agreement
(Claim d), an argument raised by each Party; it will finally deal with the other claims
raised by Claimants relating to the tax assessments made by the authorities and
reviewed by the courts (Claim (c)).

5.6.2.1 The nature of the SCSA and the alleged breach thereof by
MongolBank

The SCSA is a document the implementation of which led the Parties to very different
interpretations. The Tribunal has benefited from the written and oral testimony
contributions of two independent experts on Mongolian law, Professor Temuulen Bataa
retained by Claimants and Professor Tumenjargal Mendsaikhan by Respondent. These
two experts addressed a number of legal points, several of them dealing with the
interpretation to be given to the SCSA. The facts concerning the SCSA are not really
disputed between the Parties but they are strongly divided about the nature of the
transaction, its legality and alleged breaches of its provisions.

Subsequently to the adoption of the WPT Law, the President of GEM who is also one of
Claimants, Mr. Paushok, hoping that the measure would soon be amended or rescinded,
developed a strategy whereby GEM would be in a position to avoid having to pay that
tax immediately.52 This implied delaying for as long as possible the moment when a
transfer of ownership of the gold produced by GEM would occur and the payment of
the WPT would have to be made. There is nothing wrong per se in pursuing such a
strategy. The Tribunal knows no country where one is obligated to arrange its financial
activities in such a way as to have to pay maximum taxes; every citizen has the right to
plan its financial affairs so as to minimize the impact of taxation, as long as those
arrangements respect the applicable law. On the other hand, in most countries, tax
authorities frown on commercial activities the only purpose of which is to avoid paying
taxes; accordingly, general anti-avoidance rules and specific legislative provisions have
often been adopted to contain what could be perceived as artificial transactions and

551 R. Defense, 331-339; R. Rejoinder, $259.
52 Paushok-ll, $79.

- 128-

collect taxes that would otherwise be owing. Mongolian tax authorities appear to be no
exception to that practice.

Following its strategy, GEM entered into the SCSA with MongolBank "pursuant to
Article 21, of Law of Mongolia On the Central Bank" which reads as follows:

"Article 21. Disposal and management of the State reserves of
foreign currency

1. The Bank of Mongolia shall ensure prompt payment and
security of those foreign currency reserves of the State which it
disposes of and manages. Only after these obligations are fulfilled
may the Bank of Mongolia conduct income earning operations
using the foreign currency reserves of the State to invest in
instruments tradable in the financial markets.

2. Foreign currency reserves of the State held by the Bank of
Mongolia shall consist of the following assets:

1) Monetary gold held in foreign banks and with
financial institutions;

2) Cash or non-cash convertible foreign currencies;

3) Bills of exchange and promissory notes, freely
payable in convertible foreign currencies;

4) Any type of obligation issued or guaranteed by the
Government or central bank of foreign countries or
international financial __ institutions = which is
denominated and is to be paid in convertible foreign
currencies; and

5) Other assets internationally recognized as foreign
currency reserve.

3. When managing foreign currency reserves of the State the Bank
of Mongolia may conduct operations to freely convert, purchase
and sell the assets set out in paragraph 2 of this article.

4. The Bank of Mongolia shall ensure the stability of the tégrég
when it purchases or sells foreign currencies and similar assets in
exchange for the tégrég.

5. If foreign currency reserves of the State have declined below the
level determined by the State Ikh Khural or if the Bank of
Mongolia has established that it has become impossible to
implement foreign currency policy and to promptly execute

530.

foreign payments of the State, the Bank of Mongolia shall officially
inform the Government and shall take pertinent measures jointly
with the Government."

Under Article 1.1. of the SCSA, "(t)he Seller (GEM) agrees to deliver for safe custody and
subsequently sell to the Bank within the time and in quantities set forth in the
Agreement and the Bank agrees to keep in custody during the period designated by the
Seller and to purchase from the Seller the gold bullion bars (hereinafter "the Metal") and
to pay for the same the price, set forth in the Agreement.>°

Article 1.2 then declares: "The Sale of the Metal shall be subject to the following terms
and conditions:

1.2.1 Sale and delivery period: during six months
through December 26, 2006 (By the Supplementary
Agreement of October5, 2006, this period was
extended to 25 December 2007);

1.2.2 Sale date: any designated by the Seller during the
sale period.

1.2.3 Sale item: chemically pure gold.

1.2.4 Amount of the Metal to be sold during the period
set forth in section 1.2.1 hereof shall be determined
based on the weight of each separate gold consignment
delivered into custody, but the total amount shall be at
least, 1,000,000 (One million) grams".

Under Article 1.2.5, the price of the Metal was to be calculated on the basis of the Metal
price per ounce as set by MongolBank, "on the date the Seller delivers to the Bank a
letter prepared in an arbitrary form designating the date as the Metal sale date and
containing the request to sell the Metal to the Bank (hereinafter the "Metal Sale Letter')".
Other important features of the SCSA were as follows:

1 The Seller was obliged to deliver no less than 1 million grams (one metric ton) o:
he Sell bliged to deli less thi llion g: f
gold to MongolBank within the period mentioned in 1.2.1. (Art. 2.1.1)

(2) The Seller was obliged to issue the Sale Letter within the same period. (Art. 2.1.2)

(3) MongolBank was obliged to ensure acceptance for safe custody in an amount of
not less than 1 million grams. (Art. 2.2.1)

MongolBank was obliged to ensure the security of the metal delivered for safe
custody from the moment of the acceptance of the metal into MongolBank's
depository until its sale by the Seller. (Art. 2.2.2)

MongolBank was obliged to issue a certificate confirming the amount of metal
kept in safe custody on the Seller's request. (Art. 2.2.3)

MongolBank had the right to accept gold in amount greater than provided under
the SCSA. (Art. 2.4)

During the metal sale period, the Seller must sell to MongolBank metal in the
amount set forth in Art. 1.2.4 (at least 1 million grams) and MongolBank must
accept the metal for safe custody and to purchase the metal upon delivery by the
Seller of the Sale Letters. (Art. 3.1)

The delivery and acceptance of the metal for safe custody was to be confirmed by
the execution of two statements: the Metal Delivery and Acceptance Statement
and the Metal Safe Custody Delivery and Acceptance Statement. (Art. 3.2)

Risk of incidental loss would pass to MongolBank on delivery of the metal into
safe custody but ownership would only pass on the delivery of a Sale Letter
designating the sale date and of a Metal Sale Request and the execution of a
Metal Sale Statement between the two parties. (Art. 4.1)

MongolBank would pay 85% of the value of the metal deposited into safe
custody on the date of delivery and that sum would be deducted from the actual
purchase. The balance would be payable to or by the Seller, depending on the
value of the metal at the time of sale. (Arts. 5.5 and 5.8)

In cases not covered by the SCSA, the liability would be determined in
accordance with Mongolian law. (Art. 6.5)

If disputes could not be resolved by negotiations, they would be "resolved in
court pursuant to the procedure established by the current Mongolian law".
(Art. 9.2).

Under Art. 1.2.5, the price of the Metal was to be calculated on the basis of the
Metal price set by MongolBank on the date of delivery of a Metal Sale Letter.

There is agreement between the Parties that the SCSA is governed by Mongolian law
and, in particular, the Mongolian Civil Code (the "MCC").

After analysis of the SCSA and of the opinions of the experts and having considered the
arguments of the parties, the Tribunal has concluded that the SCSA is a mixed contract,
or an "innominate" contract, as Prof. Mendsaikhan calls it.

In the Tribunal's opinion, the SCSA is first and foremost a safe custody contract
associated with a sale contract subject to a suspensive condition.

First of all, Mr. Paushok, in his Second Witness testimony®4 and during his oral
testimony, made no secret of the purpose of the transaction between GEM and
MongolBank and it only made sense if it led to a postponement of the transfer of the title
of ownership, thus avoiding paying the WPT immediately upon deposit with
MongolBank. Article 3.6. of the SCSA makes it quite clear that ownership will be
transferred "(w)ithin one business day from the receipt by the Bank of the Metal Sale
Request."

Secondly, the text of the SCSA itself is worded in such terms that there are clearly two
types of transactions envisaged: first, acts of deposit in safe custody and then orders to
sell through the issuance of Sale Letters no later than December 25, 2007.

Respondent argues that all the risk was transferred to MongolBank and that, under
Mongolian law, this constituted a sale. It bases its argument on Art. 4 of the SCSA
transferring the risk of incidental loss to MongolBank. But, as Prof. Temuulen Bataa
demonstrated, this is a typical characteristic of a safe deposit contract under the MCC.535

Respondent is however right in pointing out some elements of a transaction which bore
little benefits to MongolBank. It was called upon to pay, upon delivery, 85% of the value
of the gold at the time of delivery; then, it was assuming the risk of incidental loss; and
all the while charging no interest or a fee for such storage.

While it is true that there appeared to be little in it for MongolBank, the SCSA was not
totally devoid of potential benefits for it. First of all, the bank was protected from loss,
through an obligation of GEM to pay the difference if at the time of sale, gold was at a
price lower than the 85% amount MongolBank had already paid; on the other hand,
MongolBank was assured of the ownership, at the time of sale, of at least 1 million
grams, and possibly much more, that it could use to enlarge the gold reserves of
Mongolia, with the possibility of selling that gold at profit subsequently, if the price of
gold increased after December 25, 2007 (which it did substantially). Respondent itself
argued in its Statement of Defense that the SCSA "served a public purpose, i.e. the
increase of Mongolia’s gold reserves".

GEM ceased to deposit gold with MongolBank after January 19, 2007 and, instead,
resorted to loans from commercial banks against gold deposits as security, the loans not
exceeding 80% of the secured obligations and with interest rates of 1.1% and 1.5% a
month.

Be that as it may, the SCSA was the deal that was struck between two knowledgeable
and independent parties, one of them being a major institution of the Mongolian State.

Two main questions have to be answered concerning the interpretation of the SCSA: 1-
What amount of gold was GEM obligated to sell to MongolBank? 2- When was the
transfer of ownership of the gold delivered under the SCSA going to occur?

As to the first question, the SCSA could certainly have been drafted more clearly. The
key provisions in the analysis of that contract are the following:

"Section 1.2.4: “amount of the Metal to be sold during the period
set forth in Section 1.2.1 hereof shall be determined based on the
weight of each separate gold consignment delivered, but the total
amount shall be at least 1,000,000 (One Million) grams.”

Section 2.1.1: (The Seller shall have an obligation) “to deliver to
the Bank within the period of time set forth in section 1.2.1 hereof
the Metal in the amount of not less than 1,000,000 (One Million)
grams,”

Section 2.4: “The Bank may accept the Metal in the amount greater
than provided under this Agreement”

Section 3.1: “During the Metal sale period (Section 1.2.1) the Seller
shall sell to the Bank the Metal and the Bank shall accept the Metal
for safe custody and to purchase the Metal as the Seller submits
the Metal Sale Letters."

The Tribunal’ s reading of the SCSA and of the exchanges between MongolBank and
GEM leads it to the conclusion that the obligation of GEM to sell the deposited gold
extended to the whole of the gold deposited with MongolBank. This conclusion is
reached both on the basis of the text of the SCSA and of the Parties’ conduct during its
implementation.

As to the text itself, the Tribunal has already indicated that it was not clear; nonetheless,
the formulation and the spirit of the contract indicates that the more reasonable
interpretation is one which leads to the above conclusion.

To begin with, Section 1.2.4 states that the “amount of the Metal to sold (...) shall be
determined based on the weight of each separate gold consignment delivered into
custody”, the minimum required being 1 million grams. This minimum has to be
interpreted as a provision in favor of MongolBank; it is quite understandable that
MongolBank would not have wished to enter into such an agreement unless it would
have been assured of getting a minimum of gold deposited and available for purchase.
Section 2.4 sustains that interpretation; there would be little point in mentioning that the
Bank could accept a greater amount of Metal, if it would have been under any obligation
to accept more than 1 million grams. As to GEM, if it wished the provision to be in its
favor, it would have been much simpler to provide simply that it would sell 1 million
grams of Metal and rely on the right of MongolBank to buy a greater volume of gold, if
it wished to do so.

It is also worthwhile to note that nothing in the SCSA deals with the possible return of
the deposited gold. Claimants have argued that the provisions of the Mongolian Civil
Code contains provisions concerning deposit contracts and that the parties to the SCSA
(GEM and MongolBank) would have had to abide by them. This is no doubt correct; yet,

549,

550.

551.

- 133-

one would have thought that, if MongolBank could be obliged to return all the gold
deposited above 1 million grams, there would have been some section of the SCSA
dealing with this very important eventuality.

As to the conduct of the Parties, as has already been stated, there was no doubt as to the
intention of GEM; it was to delay as long as possible and, if possible, to avoid
completely the payment of the WPT, if the WPT was to be eventually repealed, an
objective in no way reprehensible.5%. Its purpose was to postpone the sale, not to avoid
it. For that purpose, it provided for the deposit of a large an amount of gold with
MongolBank, getting an advance payment of 85% of the value of that gold at the time of
deposit, without any interest having to be paid on that amount.

As far as GEM is concerned, the Tribunal has received no evidence of a stand taken by
GEM, before its letter of December 25, 2007 to MongolBank, to the effect that it was only
required to sell 1 million grams. In fact, the evidence points in the other direction. Thus,
on October 6, 2006, it wrote a letter? to the Head of the State Budget stating:
“According to the Contract, the Company has an obligation to sell the saved bars to
MongolBank. Sale has to be made in preferable price day, not exceeding the date of
December 25, 2006, on the basis of the Company’s written Metal Sale letter.” It said that
it had "an obligation to sell the saved bars" not merely an obligation to sell 1 million
grams. According to the testimony of Mr. Kaczmarek, Claimants’ financial expert,
Claimants had, by that time, deposited about 1.8 million grams of gold.538 The day
before, the SCSA had been extended for another year, thus opening the possibility of a
further increase in deposits. One is entitled to think that, in such circumstances, if GEM
thought that it was not obligated to sell more than 1 million grams, it would have
mentioned that important fact to the tax authorities which were enquiring about the
situation. As to the condition attached in that letter (the requirement of a Metal Sale
letter), it is not be interpreted as an option for Claimants to sell only a total of 1 million
grams. The Metal Sale letters could be sent at any time before the deadline to instruct
MongolBank to sell the whole or part of the gold deposited, so that GEM could benefit
from increases in the price of gold at a particular time or dispose of the gold promptly if
the WPT had been eliminated or substantially decreased. GEM thus had considerable
flexibility during the course of the SCSA to sell gold but this did not include the right, at
the end of the SCSA, to have sold only a maximum of 1 million grams of gold.

In fact, it is only on December 24, 2007, the penultimate day to submit a Metal Sale letter,
that GEM issued a Metal Sale letter for slightly over 1 million grams and, in a letter of
December 25, 2007, asserted that it was entitled to ask for the return of the 1,910,978.91
grams deposited in excess of the minimum 1 million grams mentioned in the SCSA. For
the first time on that occasion, it invoked Article 422 of Mongolia’s Civil Code and

586 Claimants’ Request for Interim Measures, 122: "Because Mr. Paushok had expected a swift abolition of the
Windfall Tax (or, at a minimum, a substantial adjustment to the tax changes), it was decided that GEM should
postpone the sale of gold."

indicated its willingness to return the related advance payments received and pay for
the safe keeping services provided by MongolBank.

It is true that, during the course of 2007, GEM had initiated legal action in the United
Kingdom concerning the export and refining of its gold by MongolBank (about which
more is said later), but those steps had to do with the alleged premature assumption of
ownership of the whole GEM’s gold by MongolBank, not with the rights resulting from
Metal Sale letters mentioned in the SCSA.

In addition, it is worthwhile noting that GEM made its last deposit of gold with
MongolBank on January 19, 2007 while the SCSA had still some 11 months to run.
Instead, it borrowed from commercial banks against deposit of gold and received in
return only 80% of the value of that gold upon which it was paying large interest rates. It
is hard to understand the rationale for such a decision, compared to the comparatively
very generous terms under the SCSA, if GEM was of the view that it was only obligated
to sell a minimum of 1 million grams under that contract.

On the other hand, the Tribunal also has to look at MongolBank’s conduct during the
implementation of the SCSA. In that regard, no evidence has been adduced
demonstrating that, at any time, MongolBank interpreted that contract as meaning that
GEMs was only required to sell 1 million grams of the gold deposited.

From the evidence submitted, it seems that the relations between GEM and MongolBank
soured significantly during the latter part of 2007. On November 6 2007, MongolBank
wrote a letters? in which it indicated its willingness “to deliver up and give back to you
the gold refined to 999.9 fineness, of which we have repeatedly advised your company”
and it added: “The agreement contains no stipulation as to the return of your company
of the deposited physical gold and as no such provision exists, the issue of gold return
and repayment of the pre-payment may not arise other than outside the contractual
arrangements.” That letter does not contain any recognition by MongolBank that it is
entitled to the eventual ownership of only 1 million grams. Its offer related to the whole
of the gold deposited and indicated clearly that such return would have to be resolved
outside the contractual arrangements. For whatever reason, GEM did not accept this
offer but instead, on November 8, 2007, it served notice of its intention to initiate the
present proceedings and issued a Notice of Arbitration against Respondent on 30
November 2007. It waited until December 24, 2007 to issue its first Sale Letter for slightly
over 1 million grams and claimed the return of the rest of the deposited gold, the
following day.

As to the second question, the answer is clear. Section 1.2.1 states that the sale and
delivery period is during six months through December 26, 2006 (subsequently
extended to December 25, 2007) and then Section 4.1 reads (in part): “the ownership
right to the Metal shall pass from the Seller to the Bank upon the Seller delivering to the
Bank Metal Sale Letter designating the sale date and Metal Sale Request and execution
of the Metal Sale Statement between the Seller and the Bank.” As long as it had not

557.

558.

559.

- 135-

received a Sale Letter or the date of December 25, 2007 had not been reached,
MongolBank was only a safe custodian and could not sell or take ownership of the metal
deposited by GEM. The Letters of MongolBank's Head of Legal Department to the
Executive Director of GEM on November 5 and December 25, 2007549 are revealing in
that regard. In the first letter, MongolBank, after stating that "we are prepared to deliver
up and give back to you the gold refined to 999.9 fineness", asserts that: "(t)he fact that
MongolBank held the gold accepted from your company in safe custody under the
agreement, only means that MongolBank has performed its obligations under the
agreement. As stipulated in the agreement, the title will transfer to MongolBank only
upon delivery of a formal letter, indicating the metal sale date and the request for sale of
the metal along with sale statement executed by both parties and, therefore, we believe
that no dispute has yet arisen with regard to ownership." It is therefore clear that
MongolBank itself recognized that until receipt of the appropriate Sale Letter or the date
of December 25, 2007 had arrived, it was merely a custodian of the gold deposited by
GEM. And it is only, on December 25, 2007, that it asserted that it was entitled to become
the owner of the full 2,951,025.200 grams deposited.

Essentially, on the two questions addressed above, the Tribunal is asked to rule on a
dispute concerning the proper interpretation of a contract (the SCSA). In addition to the
above analysis, one could also query whether MongolBank could, at the end of the
contract, seize ownership of the deposited gold or whether, instead, its only recourse
was one for damages for contractual breach by GEM, under Section 6.1 of the SCSA
which reads: “A Party, which failed to perform or properly perform its obligations
under this Agreement, shall be held liable for compensating losses incurred by the other
party as a result of such non-performance”. Reference in that regard can also be made to
Articles 101.1 and 106.1 of the Mongolian Civil Code. However, all these matters are in
the nature of legitimate differences of views between the parties to the SCSA as to what
is the right interpretation to be given to the Agreement; that Agreement specifically
provides in its Article 9 the recourses available to them: Mongolian law and Mongolian
courts. None of the above actions, even assuming that Respondent's interpretation was
not the right one, can be considered of such a nature as to amount of breaches of the
Treaty, whether it be under its Articles 2, 3 or 4.

However, the actions of MongolBank relating to the export, the refining and the opening
abroad of an unallocated accounting which it deposited GEM’s gold, before receiving
any Metal Sale letter and well before December 25, 2007, deserve a different treatment.
The Tribunal will address that question under section 5.6.2.2.2 of this Award, when it
deals with the issue of Mongolia’s liability for the acts of MongolBank.

The next question is whether Claimants can claim a breach of the Treaty through the
effect of the umbrella clause. To answer that question, the Tribunal will now proceed to
analyze the various issues raised by the Parties with regard to jurisdiction and
admissibility.

5.6.2.2 Jurisdiction and admissibility

It is recognized by the Parties that Claimants not being direct parties to the agreement
cannot base their claim on a contractual basis but by demonstrating that there has been a
breach of the Treaty caused by the conduct of Respondent in connection with the SCSA.

The following questions raised by the Parties will be addressed: a) The MFN and the
umbrella clauses; b) Mongolia's liability for the actions of MongolBank; c) the alleged
violation of the Treaty by the tax authorities and d) the alleged denial of justice resulting
from the court decisions concerning the Tax Assessment.

5.6.2.2.1 MEN and umbrella clauses

Respondent points out correctly that the Treaty contains no umbrella clause. However,
Claimants invoke the MFN clause in Article 3(2) of the Treaty:

"2. The treatment mentioned under paragraph 1 of this Article,
shall not be less favorable than treatment accorded to investments
and activities associated with investments of its own investors or
investors of any third State."

Respondent argues, among other things, that Claimants cannot introduce an umbrella
clause imported from another treaty, because of the limited guarantee provided under
Article 3 (1):

1. Each Contracting Party shall, in its territory, accord
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party and
activities associated with investments fair and equitable
treatment excluding the application of measures that might
impair the operation and disposal with investments.

The question then is whether Article 3(2) of the Treaty is entitling Claimants to import
an umbrella clause from other treaties.

The Ambatielos panel>! stated in that regard that "the most-favored-nation clause can
only attract matters belonging to the same category of subject as that to which the clause
itself relates". Historically, tribunals have tended to construe MFN clauses broadly and
they have regularly accepted to import substantive rights into an investment treaty from
treaties that the host State has signed with other countries. This broad interpretation has
also led tribunals to allow the import of more favorable procedural rights.52 There are
however other cases which have adopted a more restrictive interpretation concerning

the import of procedural rights*43 but this issue need not be addressed in the present
case, the question relating simply to the import of substantive rights.

566. In that regard, Claimants make reference, in particular, to the U.S.-Mongolia Treaty>4
which contains the following umbrella clause (Article II, 2(c):

"Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with regard to investments."

567. Claimants also invoke Article 2(3) of the Denmark-Mongolia BIT and Article 2(2) of the
U.K.- Mongolia BIT, which contain similar wording.

568. The meaning and scope of an umbrella clause has been the subject of much discussion
and debate in the legal literature and in arbitral awards, since the closely related in time
but somewhat divergent conclusions of the arbitral tribunals in the Société Générale de
Surveillance S.S. v. Islamic Republic of Pakistan*45 and Société Générale de Surveillance S.A. v.
Republic of the Philippines cases.54° The fundamental issue is whether an umbrella clause
can cover a contractual breach if the contract is between an entity related to but distinct
from the State and/or an entity distinct from the Investor.

569. A number of subsequent awards dealt with the interpretation to be given to umbrella
clauses, the vast majority supporting the general direction established by the Philippines
case but bringing useful clarifications.”

570. Claimants’ arguments concerning the meaning and effect of an umbrella clause are
however of purely academic interest in the present case. The Treaty is quite clear as to
the interpretation to be given to the MEN clause contained in Article 3(2): the extension
of substantive rights it allows only has to do with Article 3(1) which deals with fair and
equitable treatment. If there exists any other BIT between Mongolia and another State
which provides for a more generous provision relating to fair and equitable treatment,
an investor under the Treaty is entitled to invoke it. But, such investor cannot use that

MEN clause to introduce into the Treaty completely new substantive rights, such as
those granted under an umbrella clause.

This being said, a clause in a BIT whereby the definition of fair and equitable treatment
would be written in broader terms than in the case of the Treaty would clearly be
covered by the MEN clause contained in it. In that regard, the Tribunal notes that the
Denmark-Mongolia BIT#8 quoted by Claimants is of particular relevance. It provides in
its Article 3 (2) as follows:

"Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord investors of
the other Contracting Party, as regards their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their investment, fair
and equitable treatment which in no case shall be less favourable
than that accorded to its own investors or to investors of any third
state, whichever of these standards is the more favourable."

This puts to rest Respondent’s argument about the restrictive interpretation it wishes to
apply to the words "fair and equitable treatment excluding the application of measures
that might impair the operation of or disposal of investment" in Article 3(1) of the
Treaty. That Article cannot have a more limited meaning than that found in Article 3(2)
of the Denmark-Mongolia BIT.

The next step for the Tribunal is therefore to determine whether Mongolia has breached
any article of the Treaty, including the broad application of the fair and equal treatment
provision imported through the MEN clause, but not through the application of an
umbrella clause which Claimants cannot invoke.

5.6.2.2.2 Mongolia's liability for the acts of MongolBank

In order to determine whether Mongolia bears any liability for MongolBank’s actions,
one must first consider its status under Mongolian law. The issue here is not about the
nature of the SCSA itself but whether the disputed actions of MongolBank in the
implementation of the SCSA were actions attributable to Mongolia and thereby might
constitute breaches of the Treaty.

MongolBank has been established as the Central Bank (Bank of Mongolia) under a law
of September 3, 1996. Under Article 3 of that law, MongolBank is to be "the competent
organization authorized to implement State monetary policy" and it is defined as "a legal
entity established by the State". Under Article 4, its main objective is described as "(to)
promote balanced and sustained development of the national economy, through
maintaining the stability of money, financial markets and the banking system." Its
President is appointed by the State Khural (Article 26) to which he reports but the State
Khural cannot interfere with the activities relating to the implementation of State
monetary policy by MongolBank (Article 30). Article 31(2) provides specifically that "the
Bank of Mongolia shall be independent from the Government."

It is in that legal context that the Tribunal must find whether MongolBank’s actions are
attributable to Respondent under the international law rules of attribution. For the
purpose of this case, those rules are reflected particularly in Articles 4, 5 and 9 of the
International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of States for internationally
wrongful acts ("ILC Articles"), which are generally considered as representing current
customary international law.

Article 4 reads as:

"1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of
that State under international law, whether the organ exercises
legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever
position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its
character as an organ of the central Government or of a territorial
unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in
accordance with the internal law of the State."

Article 5 reads as:

"The conduct of a person entity which not an organ of the State
under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that Sate to
exercise elements of the governmental authority shall be
considered an act of the State under international law, provided
the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular
instance."

And Article 9 reads as:

"The conduct of an organ of a State or of a person or entity
empowered to exercise elements of the governmental authority
shall be considered an act of the State under international law if
the organ, person or entity acts in that capacity, even if it exceeds
its authority or contravenes instructions."

The distinction between organs of the State and other entities is of particular relevance in
the determination of potential liability of the State. As stated in the Commentary to the
ILC Articles, "It is irrelevant for the purposes of attribution that the conduct of a state
organ may be classified as "commercial" or as acta jure gestionis. Of course, the breach by
a State of a contract does not as such entail a breach of international law. [...] But the
entry into or breach of a contract by a State organ is nonetheless an act of the State for
the purposes of article 4, and it might in certain circumstances amount to an
internationally wrongful act."549 That situation is different from the case of other entities
exercising elements of governmental authority as described in Article 5 of the ILC

549 Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, with Commentary, 2001, Report of the
ILC on the work of its fifty-third session, p. 41.

Articles, where the liability of the State is engaged only if they act jure imperii and not
jure gestionis.

The ILC Articles do not contain a definition of what constitutes an organ of the State and
the Mongolian law is not very helpful in that regard either. The mention in Article 2 of
the MongolBank Act that it is "a legal entity established by the State" and that it is “the
competent authority authorized to implement monetary policy” is not sufficient to
support a conclusion that it is not an organ but an entity of the type mentioned in
Article 5 of the ILC. If this were the case, one would be left with a very narrow definition
of organs of the State since most of the executive and judiciary functions of the State are
fulfilled by legal entities established by the State and adopting and/or implementing
public policy. The Tribunal has long debated whether MongolBank is an organ of the
State of Mongolia.

According to one view, the fact that the Mongolian Parliament has created it as an
institution independent of the Government does not per se make it lose its status as an
organ of the State. In fact, it fulfills a major State function and the list of its
responsibilities clearly demonstrates that it fulfills a role that only a State can fulfill:
exclusive right to issue currency, formulation and implementation of monetary policy,
acting as the Government's financial intermediary; supervising activities of other banks;
holding and managing the State’s reserves of foreign currencies.55° As stated in the
Commentary to the ILC Articles: "The reference to a “State organ" covers all the
individual or collective activities which make up the organization of the State and act on
its behalf."55! Like other central banks in the world, MongolBank assumes part of the
executive responsibility of the State; and, if one were to argue for a more limited
definition of the executive power of the State, Mongolbank would still qualify as an
organ of the State under the words "any other functions" mentioned in Article 4 of the
ILC Articles.

Such role differentiates MongolBank from other institutions found, in other cases, not to
be organs of the State. Thus, in Jan de Nul N.V., Dredging International N.V. v. Arab
Republic of Egypt,552 the Tribunal concluded that the Suez Canal Authority ("SCA") was
not an organ of the State. Noting that the SCA was created to take over the management
and utilization of the Suez Canal after its nationalization and recognizing that it could be
said to carry out public activities, it relied on Articles 4, 5 and 6 of its constitutive law to
conclude that it was not part of the Egyptian State. Article 4 states that the SCA is to be
managed like" business enterprises without any commitment by the governmental
systems and conditions". Article 5 provides that the SCA "shall have an independent
budget that shall be in accordance with the rules adopted in business enterprises" and
Article 6 states that the "SCA’s funds are considered private funds". Another relevant
case is that of Bayindir Insaat Turizim Ticaret Ve Sanayi A.S. v. Islamic Republic of

550 Article 5 of the Law on Central Bank.

Pakistan.53 In that case, the Tribunal had to decide whether the acts of the National
Highway Authority of Pakistan ("NHA") allegedly in breach of a BIT were attributable
to Pakistan. Having noted that the NHA had a distinct legal personality under the laws
of Pakistan, it decided that "(b)ecause of its separate legal status, the Tribunal discards
the possibility of treating NHA as a State organ under Article 4 of the ILC Articles." The
simple fact that an institution has separate legal status does not allow one to conclude
automatically that that institution is not an organ of the State; in order to reach such a
conclusion, a tribunal has to engage in a broader analysis which includes the functions
assigned to that entity. There is a huge difference to be found between public authorities
established to operate and maintain a navigational canal or to construct and maintain
highways and a central bank charged with the issuance of the currency and running the
State’s monetary policy.

According to that analysis, MongolBank being recognized as an organ of the State, the
question whether MongolBank in entering into and implementing the SCSA acted jure
imperii or jure gestionis would therefore become irrelevant in terms of the liability of the
State.

According to another interpretation, MongolBank is not an organ of the State since
Article 2 of the MongolBank Act specifies that it is established as “a legal entity” and, as
such, it is exercising elements of governmental authority, as described in Article 5 of the
ILC Articles. In support of that view, one can mention the Genin case54 where the Bank
of Estonia is described as “an agency of a Contracting State”. The Tribunal concluded
that Estonia was the appropriate respondent because the related BIT provided that the
State was to be responsible for the activities of any state enterprise when it was
exercising delegated governmental authority. However, that case does not definitely
answer the question whether such a state enterprise was an organ of the State or a State
entity; the legal notion of “agent” does not exist in the international law of State
responsibility. The choice has to be between being an organ under Article 4 of the ILC
Articles or an “entity empowered to use governmental authority” under Article 5.
Another case more to the point however is an English court case involving the Bank of
Nigeria, the charter of which was modeled on that of the Bank of England, and where
the Court of Appeal, under the leadership of Lord Denning, reversing the decision of the
judge of first instance, denied the Bank of Nigeria its plea of sovereign immunity in
connection with an irrevocable letter of credit issued by the Bank in favor of the claimant
for a sale of cement to an English company, for the purpose of building army barracks in
Nigeria. The Court ruled that “the bank, which had been created as a separate legal
entity with no clear expression of intent that it should have governmental status, was
not an emanation, arm, alter ego or department of the State of Nigeria and was therefore

- 142-

not entitled to immunity from suit.”555 The difficulty of making the distinction was
pointed out by Lord Denning (and shared by his two colleagues) when he wrote:

"In these circumstances, I have found it difficult to decide whether
or no the Central Bank of Nigeria should be considered in
international law a department of the Federation of Nigeria, even
though it is a separate legal entity. But, on the whole, I do not
think it should be.

This conclusion would be enough to decide the case, but I find it
so difficult that I prefer to rest my decision on the ground that
there is no immunity in respect of commercial transactions, even
for a government department."

586. The Tribunal however does not need to decide the question whether MongolBank is or is
not an organ of the State, since as will be shown below, even if it were merely an entity
exercising governmental authority, at least some of the disputed actions in connection
with GEM’s gold were in any event actions de jure imperii.

587. While claiming that the SCSA is a purely commercial transaction, Respondent also
argues that MongolBank entered into the SCSA within the exercise of its functions
related to the management of Mongolia's foreign reserves.5° Moreover, by proceeding to
export and refine the gold deposited by GEM, and depositing it or its value in an
unallocated account, MongolBank was clearly exercising specific powers granted to it
under the Law on Central Bank and the Treasury Law. In that regard, a press release of
MongolBank of August 24, 2007 states:557

"MongolBank implementing the Law on Central Bank
(MongolBank) and the Law on Precious Metals and StoneFund
and with the purposes of increasing the country's currency
reserves purchases from gold producing business entities and
individuals unrefined gold at the market price, published as of a
certain date. [...] This gold, which according to the agreement
made with KOO Golden East-Mongolia, will be definitely
purchased by MongolBank, has been refined and placed abroad."

588. That press release was issued in answer to a statement by GEM that three tons of gold
held in custody in MongolBank had disappeared. Such a view was repeated by
MongolBank when, on November 19, 2007, it answered a previous letter of GEM of
November 16, in the following terms:558

"With the purpose of increasing state currency reserves
MongolBank when purchasing business entities purified gold
produced by them would calculate its pure weight according to
common practice of the international financial markets and would
make settlements for the value of the gold based on the markets
price of the gold as of a particular day.

Given that MongolBank has an obligation to refine the purified
gold purchased into the state currency reserves and place the
same in the international financial markets pursuant to the most
favourable arrangements, MongolBank refined 3.1 tons of your
gold, being in possession of MongolBank in accordance with the
law."

Furthermore, in its Statement of Defense, Respondent argued that the sale/purchase of
the gold deposited by GEM "served a public purpose, i.e the increase of Mongolia's gold
reserves."

A related decision by the Court of Appeal (England) involving GEM and the Bank of
Nova Scotia and others **? further supports the conclusion that MongolBank was in part
acting de jure imperii in connection with the SCSA. That decision was referred to by each
side.5 In that case MongolBank was the third defendant, the second defendant being
Scotia Capital (Europe) Limited. The appeal was only concerned with GEM’s attempt to
obtain information and documents from the Bank of Nova Scotia. Without entering into
the details of the case, suffice to say that it was established that GEM’s gold deposited
with MongolBank was refined by a gold refiner outside Mongolia but that it was not
clear where the refined gold was held physically after refining and by whom; pursuant
to a contract with MongolBank, the Bank of Nova Scotia simply had an unallocated
account in which a certain quantity of gold was credited to MongolBank’s account, the
bank not physically holding any gold for MongolBank. The Bank of Nova Scotia, in the
English proceedings, refused to authorize the release of any information concerning its
contract with MongolBank or who had refined and who had physical possession of the
gold concerned, by invoking state immunity, in favor of MongolBank.

The Court first stated: "[...] the question is whether MongolBank entered into the
contract (with the Bank of Nova Scotia) in the exercise of sovereign authority"! and it
answered: "Th(e) evidence shows that the purpose of the transactions including the
refining of the gold and the placing of a quantity of refined gold on the unallocated
account of the bank was for the purposes of increasing Mongolia’s currency reserves. In
my judgment that was an exercise of sovereign authority within the meaning of the 1978
Act (State Immunity)"5* It may be that, under English Law, the definition of State

immunity has a different scope than under international law. But what is interesting for
our purpose is that evidence upon which the Court of Appeal bases its decision is
constituted of the 19 November 2007 letter of MongolBank to GEM and the press release
of 24 August 2007, both quoted above. In addition, the refining of the gold abroad and
the placing of it or its value in an unallocated account in the Bank of Nova Scotia are
exactly the breaches alleged by Claimants in the present case.

The Tribunal therefore has no hesitation in concluding that MongolBank acted de jure
imperii, if not in entering into the SCSA, at least when it exported GEM's gold for
refining and deposited it or its value in an unallocated account in England "with the
purposes of increasing the country's reserves." Those actions were de jure imperii and
went beyond a mere contractual relationship. Therefore, even if MongolBank were not
to be considered an organ of the State but merely an entity exercising elements of
governmental authority, Claimants would be entitled to pursue their claim against
Respondent in connection with the actions mentioned above.

The question which then remains is whether such actions by MongolBank constituted
breaches of the Treaty. In the opinion of the Tribunal, they did so.

First, it is important to note that, in the first half of 2007, MongolBank recorded the gold
deposited by GEM as sold and owned by Mongolia, exported it, and provided for its
refinement without GEM’s knowledge and permission, the whole in violation of Article
4 of the SCSA. It thereby, without any justification, seized ownership of GEM’s gold
when it had absolutely no right to do so.

Secondly, on the basis of the evidence before the Tribunal, MongolBank first tried to
hide that fact and, for a significant period of time, misled Claimants who had legitimate
expectations that they would retain full ownership of their gold until the issuance of Sale
Letters or the termination of the SCSA.

In the opinion of the Tribunal, GEM was prematurely and without any right deprived of
the continuing ownership of its deposited gold in breach of Article 3.1 of the Treaty
which provides for "fair and equitable treatment excluding the application of measures
that might impair the operation or disposal with investments", expanded through the
MEN clause to include the text of the Denmark-Mongolia BIT.

It will be up to Claimants to prove what damages, if any, they suffered from such
actions.

5.6.2.2.3 Lack of standing

Respondent contends that Claimants do not have standing to bring claims in connection
with the SCSA because GEM did not exhaust the contractual remedies provided by the
Agreement. But the right of an investor to claim under a BIT is a separate right from that
of a company it controls to sue under the dispute resolution of a particular commercial
contract and there is no obligation for such an investor to require that company to resort
first to the dispute resolution procedure of its contract, before the investor can exercise
its own rights available to it under the provisions of a BIT.

- 145-

As to the further argument of Respondent, that Claimants had decided to proceed with
international arbitration before the SCSA had expired and that, therefore, they had made
claims before they were ripe, there is clear evidence that Claimants had, by the time of
their Notice of Arbitration, become aware that MongolBank had proceeded to the
transfer to the Treasury as if it were an owner of the gold deposited and to the export
and refinement of that gold. Claimants had, by then, sufficient evidence to conclude that
they had been deprived of the ownership of their gold, before the issuance of a Sale
Letter, as prescribed in the SCSA.

A related argument of Respondent concerns the alleged Jacuna in the SCSA because the
Agreement was not express with regard to the question whether the gold delivered to
MongolBank had to be returned at the end of the delivery period. The Tribunal fails to
see how such a lacuna should prevent Claimants from exercising their rights. As
Professor Temuulen Bataa has clearly indicated, the contract was governed by
Mongolian law, and in particular its Civil Code, which clearly provides in its Article on
void transactions:

"56.5 The parties to the transaction specified in Article 56.1 of this
law (void transaction) shall be liable to mutually return all
objects transferred by the transaction or pay the prices if it is
not possible to do so."

Moreover, in its sectionon unjust enrichment entitled "Liability for acquisition of
property without legal justification", Article 492.1 adds:

"The party that transferred property to the third party in the
course of performing its obligations shall have the right to claim
back that property in the following cases:

"492.1.1 if no liability arises between the recipient of
the property and executor of the obligations,
terms of the obligation or obligations becomes
void."

As stated by Professor Temuulen Bataa:

"MongolBank and GEM had a mutual obligation to return those
things or money, which they had received without proper legal
basis, i.e. if no binding arrangement has arisen between the
parties."565

The alleged lacuna did not leave a legal void; the general provisions of the Mongolian
Civil Code continued to receive their full application.

As to the argument of Respondent that Claimants lack standing because their claims
concern the use and enjoyment of the investment, rather than its operation and disposal,

5 Temuulen-I, 102.

604.

- 146-

meaning that they fall outside the ambit of the Treaty, the Tribunal has already ruled
that the words "operation and disposal" should be given a broad meaning and could
easily cover the words "use and enjoyment", both in terms of their normal meaning and
through the application of the Denmark-Mongolia BIT in that connection, through the
Treaty’s MFN clause. In any event, in the present situation, if MongolBank
inappropriately disposed of the gold deposited by GEM before the issuance of a Sale
Letter, it is difficult to pretend that GEM had not lost the disposal of its gold.

5.6.2.2.4 Impermissible nature of the SCSA (Claim (d))

The potentially illegal character of the SCSA has been raised rather gingerly by both
Claimants and Respondent.

Claimants raise the matter subsidiarily as a matter to be addressed if the Tribunal finds
that the Mongolian courts’ interpretation is correct. As to Respondent, it also states that
the SCSA was impermissible to MongolBank, as it was in violation of legislation
governing it.564 Respondent did not bring substantive evidence in support of its
argument, but alleging the tax evasive character of the SCSA referred to the Capital's
Administrative Court in its decision of October 11, 2007, which stated as a
supplementary argument that:

"[...][A]rticle 23.17 on the law "on Central Bank/Mongolbank"
prohibits that Mongolbank "engage in any balance sheet or off-
balance sheet transactions in support of economic activities of
legal entities, individuals, other than those identified in the state
budget and approved by the Great State Khural, permitted by the
(sic) this law"; therefore, there is no legal basis on which
Mongolbank could make prepayment in support of activities of
individuals or business entities unless the gold was purchased. In
that regard the submission that Mongolbank has not purchased
the gold from KOO "Golden East-Mongolia" and still holds the
same, having made the prepayment for the purchase, is no (sic)
legally valid one."

The point is that, even if Respondent's argument were to be valid, it would not produce
the results anticipated by Respondent. As demonstrated by Professor Temuulen Bataa,
under the provisions of the Civil Code of Mongolia, the SCSA would be a transaction
which would be null and void and the parties would have to be put back in the status
quo ante.56

Moreover, supposing that the SCSA would not have been in conformity with the powers
granted to MongolBank, this fact would not be sufficient to free Respondent from its
liability under international law. This question was addressed in the case of Southern

56 R. Defense, 4229-232.

Pacific Properties (Middle East) Limited v. Egypt®* where the Tribunal ruled that, even
though "certain acts of Egyptian officials [...] may be considered legally non-existent or null
and void or susceptible to invalidation [...] they were cloaked with the mantle of
governmental authorities and communicated as such to foreign investors who relied on
them in making their investments".[...] Whether legal under Egyptian law or not, the acts
in question were the acts of Egyptian authorities [...] and "created expectations protected
by established principles of international law." A similar conclusion was reached in the
case of Ioannis Kardassopoulos v. Georgia where in its Decision on Jurisdiction®”, the
Tribunal stated: "Respondent cannot simply avoid the legal effect of the representations
and warranties set forth in the JVA and the Concession by arguing that they are
contained in agreements which are void ab initio under Georgian law. [...] Claimant had
every reason to believe that these agreements were in accordance with Georgian law, not
only because they were entered into by Georgian State-owned entities, but also because
their content was approved by Georgian government officials without objection as to
their legality on the part of Georgia for many years thereafter."

In the present case, the Tribunal does not have evidence of approval of the SCSA by
other authorities than those of MongolBank but whether MongolBank is considered an
organ of the State or an entity exercising sovereign authority, GEM was in its right to
assume that MongolBank was acting within the powers granted to it by the State.
Moreover, it worth noting that, in spite of having been made aware of the SCSA at least
since 2007, Respondent never took any action before its own courts to challenge the
validity of that Agreement.

Whether or not the SCSA would have been impermissible under Mongolian law, this is
not sufficient to make it impermissible under the Treaty and international law. Neither
Party has made such a demonstration.

In light of the foregoing, the Tribunal dismisses all of Respondent's objections to
jurisdiction and admissibility of the SCSA-related claims, except the one having to do
with the import of an umbrella clause under the MFN clause of the Treaty and where it
was found that the MEN clause could only have an application limited to the coverage
of the fair and equal treatment provision contained in Article3 of the Treaty.
Furthermore, the foregoing analysis disposes of Claimants’ Claim (d) which would have
been dismissed.

5.6.2.3 The alleged violation of the Treaty resulting from the Tax
Assessment by the tax authorities (Claim (c))

It is noteworthy that Claim (c), ie. the claim related to the First Tax Assessment per se
(independently of the validity of the WPT itself), includes two distinct claims: (1) a claim
for violation of the Treaty by the First Tax Assessment and (2) a claim for denial of
justice due to the failure of the Mongolian courts to quash the First Tax Assessment.

These two claims arise under non-contractual conduct and do not involve claims under
the umbrella clause and they will be treated separately.

In defense to this claim, Respondent alleges that the tax authorities were simply
applying Mongolian tax law which incorporates the International Accounting
Standards, and more particularly I.A.S. 18 and that there is no need to refer to any other
legislation or treaty, or even the SCSA itself. As it says in its Rejoinder,5 "(e)ven if it
were true that both parties intended the contract to be one of safekeeping rather than
sale, which is not true, the parties! intention regarding a contract is irrelevant to a tax
authority's determination that the event is taxable."

It is important to note in that regard that, in spite of frequent references by Respondent
in its briefs and oral statements to tax evasion, GEM was never prosecuted for tax
evasion, as would have been possible under Mongolian law. For whatever reason, the
tax authorities chose instead to have recourse to provision of Article 10 (1), (2) and (3) of
the Mongolian General Law on Taxation and to Article 16.1 of the Law on Accounting
which authorized a reference to the general anti-avoidance provision contained in I.A.S.
18.569 As stated by Respondent, such practice is used in a very large number of countries.
The question for the Tribunal is therefore whether the Mongolian tax authorities made
proper use of I.A.S. 18 or breached the Treaty.

The most relevant section of the Statement of the Tax Inspector is the following one,
entitled "Non-Compliance Discovered During Audit":

"As a result of the audit it was discovered that 11282,3 million
tugriks were underreported, which represents violation of
sections 1,2,3 of Article10 of the General Tax Law and
furthermore, given that section 16.1 of Law and Accounting, the
prepayment received by this company of the gold satisfied the
criteria for sales revenue recognition as defined in IAS 18, we have
noted that provisions of Article 3.1.1, 8.1 and 8.2 of the Windfall
Profit Tax Law and Article 38.1 of the Minerals Law were violated,
due to which fact, in accordance with Article 28 of Law "On
Control of taxation, Tax Payment and Tax Collection.

As a result, the Tax Inspector concluded that the 85% prepayment
received by GEM for the gold it delivered was subject to payment
under Articles 3.1.1 of the WPT Law as well as royalties, under
Article 47.1 of the Minerals Law."

Article 10 (1), (2) and (3) of the General Tax Law reads as follows:

"A taxpayer shall have the following obligations:

- 149-

1) To report one's taxable item and tax honestly and to pay
taxes within the prescribed time limit;,

2) To provide the Tax Administration with corresponding
calculations, reports and returns on imposed taxes and
payment of taxes within the prescribed time limit;

3) To keep book-keeping records in compliance with
regulations, balance sheets and reports on financial and
economic operations."

As to Paragraph 14 of I.A.S. 18, it requires the satisfaction of five criteria in order to
recognize sales revenue subject to taxation:

1) The company has transferred to the buyer the significant
risks and rewards of ownership;

2) The company retains neither continuing managerial
involvement to the degree usually associated with
ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;

3) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;

4) It is probable that economic benefits associated with the
transaction will flow to the company; and

5) The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the
transaction can be measured reliably.

As can be readily seen, Article 10 of the General Law on Taxation only imposes an
obligation of a general character. What is important in the present case is to consider
whether the tax authorities properly applied I.A.S.18 which contains the criteria that
could justify subjecting certain revenue to taxation. It is also important to note that all
five conditions have to be met before the revenue can be considered subject to taxation
("Revenue from the sale of goods should be recognized when all the following
conditions have been satisfied").

While recognizing considerable discretion granted to tax authorities in the interpretation
of I.A.S. 18 in their pursuit of tax avoidance by taxpayers, those authorities still have, in
the exercise of their discretion, to meet the conditions set by the legislation they apply.

In the present case, the Tribunal is not convinced that conditions 1) and 2) of I.A.S. 18
were satisfied. In particular, it does not appear correct to conclude that the enterprise
had transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods.
Paragraphs 5.7 and 5.8 of the SCSA spell out that the risks were equally shared between
the parties. They read as follows: "If cash advance is less than the metal selling price
estimated based on the formulas given in Para. 5.6, the Bank shall pay the difference to
the seller within 3 days after the metal sold" and "If cash advance is more than the metal

619.

620.

621.

622.

623.

624.

- 150-

selling price estimated based on the formula given in Para. 5.6, the seller shall pay the
difference to the Bank within 5 days after the metal sold." What can be read from those
paragraphs is that the risks and rewards of the SCSA were shared between the parties,
GEM bearing the risk of having to return some of the 85% it received in the case of a
lowering of the price of gold and MongolBank the risk of having to pay an additional
amount in the case of the contrary event. As to the risk of incidental loss having to be
borne by MongolBank, it has been demonstrated to the Tribunal that such risk was
inherent in the case of safe custody under the Mongolian Civil Code and, in that regard,
it can indeed be said that the risk had been transferred to the buyer.

However, these are matters of interpretation and the Tribunal has received no indication
that the taxation authorities would have breached any of the conditions5” of the fair and
equitable treatment required by Article 3.1 of the Treaty in issuing the Statement of the
State Tax Inspector No 21096 and the Tax Assessment pursuant to it. The Tax
Assessment only applied to the 85% valued of the deposited gold, an amount which had
been in the hands for quite some time.

On the basis of the above analysis of the nature of the SCSA, the Tribunal cannot
conclude that the tax authorities erred, in their analysis of that Agreement and in the
application of I.A.S. 18 to it, to such an extent that their action could be considered as
breaches of the Treaty. Equally, MongolBank acted properly in paying the relevant taxes
and fees applicable to the value of the gold it acquired at the end of the SCSA.

GEM was obviously in disagreement with the interpretation of I.A.S. 18 adopted by the
tax authorities and it appealed their decision before the Mongolian courts, as was its
right.

5.6.2.4 The Court Decisions concerning the Tax Assessment (Claim (c))

The fact that GEM has appealed without success before the Mongolian courts the
decision of the tax authorities does not preclude the possibility of Claimants requesting
this Tribunal to rule on those various decisions, under the provisions of the Treaty.

Two court decisions have to be examined in that regard: 1- the Capital's Administrative
Court decision No. 254 of October 11, 2007571 and 2- the Decision of the Cassation
Instance of the Mongolian Supreme Court No. 249 of December 11, 2007.

According to Claimants, those decisions "were so manifestly unfair, clearly unjust, and
grossly erroneous that they constitute a denial of justice, Accordingly, Mongolia
breached Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty because it breached the standards of fair and
equitable treatment and full legal protection of Claimants' investment."572

570 See the analysis of the Tribunal earlier on that subject as well as the quotation from Waste Management v. Mexico
cited by Claimants below.

57.C, SC, $268.

625.

626.

627.

628.

629.

- 151-

It is well established that the obligation to grant fair and equitable treatment also
extends to the judiciary but it is also well established that arbitral tribunals have set the
bar rather high before finding denial of justice as a BIT breach. Claimants themselves,
citing rather ancient decisions, recognize this fact in their Statement of Claim when they
write: "Numerous tribunals applying the customary standard of treatment held that the
standard is violated by a court decision that does "clear and notorious injustice",
constitutes a "gross and wrongful error" or is simply "so unfair (as) to constitute a denial
of justice."5” But they also quote*”4 the more recent case of Waste Management v. Mexico*”>
as follows: "Taken together, the S.D. Myers, Mondev, ADF and Loewen cases suggest that
the minimum standard of treatment of fair and equitable treatment is infringed by
conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the conduct is arbitrary,
grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the claimant to
sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due process leading to an outcome
which offends judicial propriety as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural
justice in judicial proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an
administrative process."

After a review of the Mongolian court decisions concerned, the Tribunal cannot
conclude that any of those decisions can be seen as so erroneous as to lead to a denial of
justice or a manifest failure of justice in judicial proceedings.

At to the decision of the Capital's Administrative Court, after having made a summary
of the views of the parties, it proceeds to an extensive analysis of the facts and the
legislation applying to them, including the interpretation to be given to I.A.S. 18. The
Court reaches a conclusion different from that of the Tribunal concerning the nature of
the SCSA but this cannot be seen as denial of justice, unless some of the elements
mentioned in the Waste Management or the other cases mentioned by Claimants were to
be present. The Tribunal could find none of them.

Claimants have attached some importance to a declaration by the Court that the SCSA
would have been an illegal transaction, if MongolBank had been a mere custodian.
Claimants argue that, if that were the case, then the whole transaction would be null and
void and, under the Mongolian Civil Code, the parties would have to be put in the status
quo ante, MongolBank returning the gold received and GEM the 85% prepayment.
However, it has to be noted that this is introduced by the Court as a supplementary
reasoning but that it does not constitute the rationale for the decision. Furthermore, even
if the Court had been wrong in its conclusion, this does not mean that this would
constitute a denial of justice under the Treaty or international law.

As to the decision of the Supreme Court, Claimants state that it "upheld the decision of
the Capital's Administrative Court without any detailed analysis"; it is difficult to see
how this, by itself, could constitute a denial of justice. In any event, that description is an

unfair one, bearing in mind the general practice of appeal courts in civil law regimes.
And, looking at the actual decision, one has to conclude that the Supreme Court gave
serious consideration to the positions of each party. The judgment contains a solid
summary of the views expressed by each party and by the State tax inspectors and
concludes its findings as follows:

"As the court of first instance made a well-grounded conclusion
on the basis of evidence contained in the case and refused to
satisfy the claims of KOO Golden East Mongolia requiring to
recognize unlawful and cancel Act No. 21096 dated August 7,
2007 of the state tax inspectors, the court feels that there are no
grounds to satisfy the cassation appeal and cancel the decision of
the court."

It then ends its decision by noting that the parties "will have the right to submit within
30 days from the date of receipt of the decision an appeal to the Administrative Case
Panel of the Supreme Court". There is no evidence that any of the parties availed itself of
that process.

The Tribunal cannot find in the two court cases considered any conduct even
approaching the description contained in the Waste Management and other cases
submitted by Claimants and quoted above. The claim relating to denial of justice it
therefore denied.

5.6.2.5 Conclusion on Claim (c)
The Tribunal concludes that in issuing the Statement of the State Inspector No. 21096
and the Tax Assessment pursuant to it, Respondent did not breach any of the provisions

of the Treaty.

In addition, the Tribunal is of the view that there has been no breach of the Treaty in the
judicial process relating to those measures.

DELAY IN THE APPROVAL OF A BUMBAT PROJECT AND CONVERSION OF
LICENCES ("NEW FACTS")

5.7.1 JURISDICTION
5.7.11 Arguments of the Parties

Respondent asserts that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction ratione materiae over
Bumbat.5%

Respondent contends that Bumbat is not a protected investment because Mr. Paushok's
shareholding in Bumbat is indirect (75% of Bumbat's shares are owned by GEM and 25%
thereof by Kifold Systems, a British Virgin Islands company owned by Mr. Paushok),

whereas Article 1(b) of the Treaty limits the protected investments to those directly
owned.577

Claimants, relying on Siemens v. Argentina®’® argue that the definition of investment in
Article 1(b) of the Treaty is not limited to direct investments.5”?

5.7.1.2 Tribunal's analysis

Bumbat is 75% owned by GEM and 25% owned by Kifold, which companies in turn are
100% owned by Mr. Paushok. Furthermore, Bumbat constitutes an asset belonging to
GEM and Kifold (and ultimately to Mr. Paushok). Nothing in the Treaty limits claims by
investors to direct investments. Claimants are entitled to register a claim concerning the
treatment received by Bumbat from Respondent.

5.7.2. SUBSTANTIVE CLAIMS
5.7.2.1 Arguments of the Parties

Claimants allege that Respondent retaliated against them for the initiation of this
arbitration, inter alia, as follows:58°

"(1) Initiation of a criminal investigation against Mr. Paushok
seven days after the Notice of arbitration was filed;

(2) Arbitrary withholding of various approvals needed for the
operations of GEM and KOO Bumbat (a company 75% owned by
GEM) in Mongolia. With respect to Bumbat, Mongolia would
have delayed for more than 5 months the approval of the project
to mine gold from the Baga Hailaast placer deposit because of
Claimants' statement that Bumbat's future payment of the WPT
will depend on the decision of this Tribunal. With respect to GEM,
Mongolia is alleged to have delayed or refused the conversion of
several exploration licenses into mining licenses."

Claimants allege that the foregoing acts of Mongolia resulted in a significant shortfall in
GEM's and Bumbat's gold production in 2008.58!

Respondent denies the facts alleged by Claimants and generally states that the various
approvals were delayed for reasons unrelated to this arbitration. For instance, the

approval to mine gold from the Baga Hailaast placer deposit was allegedly refused
because of the problems with Bumbat's feasibility study.582

Respondent further adds that Claimants' suffered no harm by reason of the alleged
failure to issue timely approvals as they were able to mine from other deposits. 583

Claimants reject the explanations provided by Respondent with respect to the delays in
approvals, including the delay incurred with respect to the approval to mine gold from
the Baga Hailaast placer deposit.5* In turn, Respondent reiterates its version of the facts
and the explanations provided for delays in approvals.>*°

Claimants argue that "Mongolia misused it regulatory powers in an orchestrated
retaliation against [their] companies" and thus violated Articles 2 and 3 of the Treaty as
well as the TRO and the OIM:586

"422. Any such misuse of a state's regulatory power by definition
violates the standards of fair and equitable treatment, non-
impairment and full legal security under Articles 2 and 3 of
the Treaty. Retaliatory motivation makes Mongolia's conduct
ipso facto arbitrary and unreasonable. Mongolian authorities'
actions were non-transparent and unpredictable because
Mongolian authorities failed to provide any justification for
their refusals and delays.

423. In addition, Mongolian authorities' refusals and delays
violated the Temporary Restraining Order and the Order on
Interim Measures. Both the Temporary Restraining Order
and the Order on Interim Measures required Mongolia not to
aggravate the present dispute. Mongolia's retaliation has, by
definition, aggravated the dispute and Mongolia thus
violated the Temporary Restraining Order and the Order on
Interim Measures."

Respondent generally denies the facts underlying the above claim and states that these
acts do not amount to Treaty violations, without specifically joining issue with
Claimants' legal arguments.

5.7.2.2. Tribunal's analysis

Claimants have submitted evidence in support of their allegations in the form of Witness
Statements by Mr. Akatkin and Mr. Paushok.**”7 While Mr. Paushok’s comment on this

issue was a very short allegation that the approval of the feasibility studies (the "FS")
was withheld because GEM protested the WPT, Mr. Akatkin provides more detailed
analysis of the events. It appears from his evidence that, on June 13, 2008, a first meeting
of the Special Board for Mineral Resources was held to review the feasibility study for
the development of a deposit held by Bumbat. A subsequent meeting called for July 16
did not take place, because the notice had been sent on the same day and Bumbat's
representatives could not be available. Another meeting was held on July 24, where the
FS was considered. At that meeting, Mr. Ariunbayar, the first deputy chairman of the
Scientific and Technical Council of the Administration for Mineral Resources and Oil
would have declared: "I propose to dismiss (the FS) and give consideration to it when a
confirmation of the payment of 68% tax will be formally sent to the Scientific and
Technological Board for approval; in that case, the draft will be re-considered."
Following representations by GEM to senior governmental authorities, another meeting
was held on October 30 and the FS was approved on November 2, 2008.

Claimants argue that the delay was caused by the refusal of GEM to pay the WPT and by
its challenges to it before the Mongolian courts. However, the statement of Mr.
Ariunbayar quoted by Claimants does not exactly say that. It can be read as asking for
an assurance from Bumbat that, if the FS were approved and production of gold would
take place, Bumbat would pay the WPT. Taking into account the behavior of GEM,
which controlled Bumbat, it is difficult to see that this would not be a legitimate
question for the Government of Mongolia to raise.

Be that as it may, a delay of five months in the approval of feasibility studies in the
mining sector in any country is not a surprising phenomenon and, in the end, the FS in
question was approved. The Tribunal sees no reason to conclude, in the circumstances,
to a breach of any provision of the Treaty or of international law. This was more a
situation of conflicting views between an applicant and an administrative authority
which, after representation to senior authorities and further meetings, was finally
approved. If any damage was suffered, it would appear to come under the authority of
Mongolian civil and administrative law with appropriate recourse to the local courts
rather than a breach of the Treaty.

As to Claimants' allegation that a criminal investigation against Mr. Paushok would
have been instigated by Mongolia as a retaliation against the initiation of this arbitration,
no significant evidence in its support was introduced by Claimants. The fact that the
investigation started seven days after the filing of the Notice of Arbitration cannot be
considered as probative of the allegation.

The claim is therefore denied.

5.8. | EVENTS OF DECEMBER 2, 2008 AND THEREAFTER
5.8.1 ARGUMENTS OF THE PARTIES
5.8.1.1 Facts
650. Claimants summarize the factual predicate of this claim as follows:

"13. On December 2, 2008, Mongolian authorities took a series of
measures that paralyzed the operations of GEM and
Claimants! other Mongolian companies, including VNGM,
KOO Bumbat ("Bumbat"), KOO Yakhton ("Yakhton"), and
KOO Vostok-Energo, a/k/a KOO East-Energo ("Vostok-
Energo").

14. Chief among these measures was Mongolia freezing each
company's bank accounts and its prohibition of any sale of
GEM's and VNGM's assets, including the sale of any gold
that GEM produced. As a result, GEM has been forced to
discontinue its gold-mining and gold-processing activities.
The number of GEM employees has plummeted from 939
people to 168. The charge of those 168 remaining employees
is to physically protect GEM's assets and maintain a
minimum operation at GEM's headquarters." 58

651. Claimants further allege that the foregoing enforcement actions of Mongolia are in
violation of Mongolian law and that notwithstanding this fact the Mongolian judiciary
failed to protect GEM and other Claimants' companies.

652. Respondent submits that Claimants present a distorted version of the events which took
place on December 2, 2008 and thereafter. Respondent further points out that its
enforcement actions were lawful and reasonable in the circumstances, especially taking
into account Claimants' stand with respect to the OIM and the events preceding
December 2, 2008. The following paragraph presents the crux of Respondent's position:

"11. Reading Claimants' last paper in isolation, the Tribunal could
understandably, but incorrectly, conclude that life began on
December 2. The "Events of December 2, 2008", however, were the
result of events that began before December 2 - i.e., Claimants'
failure to abide the Tribunal's orders and post security as set out
in the Order on Interim Measures and Procedural Order No. 4, as
well as Claimants’ violation of the TRO and OIM by transferring
GEM's assets. Thus, although Claimants feign surprise and lack of
notice, Claimants were forewarned both by Mongolia and the

588 C, Reply New Facts, 13-14.

- 157-

Tribunal of a natural consequence of the continued breach by
Claimants of the Tribunal's orders of protection in this case." 58°

5.8.1.2 Claims

653. Claimants argue that Mongolia's unlawful enforcement actions and the related failure of
the Mongolian judiciary to provide any protection against these actions violate Articles
2,3 and 4 of the Treaty.5°

654. The violations of Article 3 of the Treaty are the following:
(1) Mongolia did not act in good faith;

(2) Mongolia's enforcement and its purported judicial review did not respect due
process and procedural propriety;5

(3) Mongolia's enforcement is disproportionate;53
(4) Mongolia's enforcement was discriminatory, arbitrary, and unreasonable;

(5) Mongolia's refusal to extend existing foreign work permits was
discriminatory, arbitrary, and unreasonable;5 and

(6) The refusal to extend existing work permits was unpredictable and non-
transparent.5%

655. The violations of Article 2 of the Treaty are presented as follows:5”

"120. Mongolia's obligation to grant full legal protection to

be available to protect those investments. Mongolia's
enforcement achieved exactly the opposite. Mongolia used

enforcement from Judge Zhavkhlan from the Sukhe-Batar
District Court, Mongolia went to a different judge who
cancelled the decision suspending the illegal enforcement.
Mongolia's misuse of its court and enforcement procedures
constitutes a violation of Mongolia's obligation to provide
full legal protection under Article 2 of the Treaty."

656. Mongolia argues that its enforcement actions fully complied with the Tribunal's orders
and Mongolian law and do not amount to violations of either Article 2 or Article 3 of the
Treaty 5%

657. Respondent further submits that, in any event, it did not breach Articles 2 and 3 of the
Treaty because (i) it acted in good faith; (ii) proportionately; (iii) reasonably and (iv) ina
non-discriminatory manner.> Respondent also claims having acted in full compliance
with Mongolian law.

658. With respect to their expropriation claim under Article 4 of the Treaty, Claimants submit
that:

121. Mongolia's enforcement measures forced GEM to cease its
production activities because Mongolia froze its bank
accounts, confiscated GEM's money deposited on those
accounts and 12 kg of GEM's gold, and prevented GEM from
selling any of its assets, including its gold production. In
short, although GEM has not formally closed, it cannot
engage in any business activities. Mongolia's conduct is a
taking by any standard.

122. The same is true of VNGM. Mongolia attached all of its
assets, froze its bank accounts, and confiscated the money
deposited thereon. Mongolia also froze the bank accounts
and confiscated the deposits of Vostok-Energo, Bumbat and
Yakhton.

659. According to Claimants, the foregoing actions do not satisfy any of the four
requirements for a legal taking under Article 4 of the Treaty, namely (i) the deprivation
is in the public interest; (ii) the deprivation is undertaken with due process; (iii) the
deprivation is non-discriminatory; and (iv) there is payment of prompt, adequate, and
effective compensation for the deprivation.

Respondent opposes the expropriation claim and summarizes its argument as follows:

"89. Mongolia's enforcement actions also did not expropriate
Claimants! investment. To begin with, Mongolia operated
through liens and attachment orders and did not take
Claimants! property. Claimants continue to be the de lege
and de facto owner of Golden-East Mongolia. Further,
Claimants still have the legal right to use their equipment.
Finally, Mongolia's actions did not cause the detrimental
effects on Golden East-Mongolia's ability to continue
operating as a business. Claimants' unwillingness to agree to
a reasonable right of audit of prior transaction by a third
party administrator did. Claimants' expropriation case,
therefore, is without legal or factual basis." 63

5.8.2 TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS
5.8.2.1 Enforcement measures

The Tribunal first issued on March 23, 2008, a Temporary Restraining Order temporarily
prohibiting Respondent from seizing or obtaining a lien on Claimants’ assets. In its
subsequent Order on Interim Measures of September 2, 2008, the Tribunal terminated
the TRO and granted Claimants a suspension of any action by Respondent until
December 2, 2008, provided Claimants would give a bank guarantee or deposit monthly
in an escrow account a sum of USD 2 million up to a certain upper limit. By Procedural
Order no. 4, the Tribunal granted Claimants until December 2, 2008, to implement the
options provided for in the OIM. Claimants failed to provide any form of security and
the OIM expired on December 2, 2008. Faced with such a situation, Respondent obtained
an order from the Ulan Bator Administrative Tribunal authorizing Respondent to seize
and put liens on Claimants' assets in Mongolia. All these actions have been more fully
described above in the Section on Facts.

Various proceedings took place before the Mongolian courts and complaints were
registered by Claimants at the Court Bailiff's Office. Upon review of the evidence
submitted by the Parties, the Tribunal is of the view that none of Claimants' arguments
can sustain their claims, under Articles 2, 3 or 4 of the Treaty.

First, the Tribunal has received no evidence that the courts acted in bad faith or without
respect for due process. Respondent respected the TRO, the OIM and Procedural Order
no. 4 while they were operative. Once the delay fixed by the Tribunal had expired
without compliance by Claimants with the Tribunal's Orders and Procedural Order
no. 4, it was absolutely legitimate for Respondent to try and protect its claims against
GEM by obtaining from the Mongolian courts the authorization to seize assets and put
liens on them.

Secondly, with respect to the seizure of the assets of GEM (and VNGM) as well as of the
bank accounts and the contents thereof of other companies of the group, Claimants
allege that, despite the fact that the outstanding balance under the First Tax Assessment
amounted only to MNT 4,685,300,000, the amounts seized in the accounts of GEM,
VNGM, Bumbat, Yakhton, Vostok-Energo (amounting, in local currency, to
MNT 289,524,81.4) as well as the book value of the seized GEM's assets (according to
Claimants amounting to approximately MNT 62 billion)! largely exceeded the balance
outstanding under the First Tax Assessment.

The Tribunal has further noted that the allegation that the Bailiff's office misrepresented
the scope of the Court Order®®5 and of the Writ of Execution in its letter of December 8,
2008 to Zoos Bank®” informing the latter that the Capital Administrative Court ordered
the enforcement up to the amount of MNT 58,440,506,253 while the Court Order and the
Writ do not mention any amount.°8

Even if the book value of the seized assets largely exceeded the outstanding balance
under the First Tax Assessment, as asserted by Claimants, at the time of the Court
Bailiff's actions on December 2, 2008, the fact is that the Second Tax Assessment of
December 10, 2007, for an amount of MNT 28,231,741,000 remained equally unpaid.
Finally, it is worth noting that, on December 4, 2008, the Tax Office issued the Third Tax
Assessment, claiming the payment of taxes and interest in the amount of some MNT
56,423,191,700 (USD 48 million). It stands to reason that, when the Bailiff’s office made
its representations to the Zoos Bank, it was aware that the Tax Office had issued, on
December 4, 2008, a Third Tax Assessment in the total amount of MNT 56,423,191,700,
which is an amount pretty close to the one mentioned in its letter to Zoos Bank.

While the Bailiff's office may have erred in some respects, GEM resorted to the various
appeals opened to it under Mongolian law. The Department of Judicial Enforcement as
well as the courts considered those appeals and ruled against Claimants. None of the
actions reproached to those various authorities is of such significance as to constitute a
breach of due process and procedural propriety, a denial of justice or abuse of process
under international law.

Fourth, as to the argument that Mongolia's enforcement was discriminatory, arbitrary
and unreasonable, the evidence presented by Claimants does not support such a
conclusion.

Finally, the expropriation claim under Article 4 of the Treaty cannot be sustained on the
basis of the evidence submitted. While Respondent's actions certainly severely
handicapped GEM and VNGM activities, it did not take Claimants' property but

operated through liens and attachment orders. GEM and VNGM, as Claimants
recognized themselves still had the right to continue to use the attached assets. The
Parties engaged into discussions on arrangements that could facilitate the continued
operations of the companies concerned but no agreement was reached in that regard.
Claimants’ proposal for the provision of security was turned down by Respondent as
totally inadequate and, in the Tribunal’s view, it had good reason to do so. On the other
hand, Claimants did not accept a proposal made by Respondent aimed at allowing
operations to continue but which also contained some continuing controls by
Respondent.

5.8.2.2 Extension of work permits

Regarding the change in Mongolia's policy regarding the extension of existing work
permits, Claimants allege that the refusal to extend existing work permits was arbitrary
because it lacked any basis under Mongolian law, since the Law on Export and Import
of Foreign Workforce does not provide that the issuance of foreign work permits may be
refused because the employee intends to work or works with a company that has
outstanding foreign worker fee liabilities. In addition, such refusal would be
discriminatory because it apparently applied only to GEM employees. Moreover, such
refusal resulted from an unpredictable and non-transparent change of policy, Counsel
for Respondent having stated in a letter of August 29, 2008, that Mongolia's policy "to
refuse to grant foreign work permits for companies who have not paid fees associated
with having those foreign workers [...] does not apply to requests to extend existing
permits and/or reissue expired permits". Finally, the reversal of policy would not be
related to any rational policy, the proof being that the net result of that reversal —
"together with Mongolia's other actions"*!0 — was that a large number of Mongolian
workers lost their employment.

As to the first point raised by Claimants, it is far from obvious that, in order to refuse to
extend a worker permit for any reason, there would need to be a specific provision in the
law stating that it can be refused because his employer has refused or neglected to pay
the FWF for other workers. Like in many other countries, the entry of a foreign worker
into Mongolia or his continued presence is not a right but a privilege which can be
subject to all kinds of restrictions and policy changes.

As to the second point, Claimants have not established that there existed other foreign
firms in Mongolia which were granted worker permit extensions, in spite of the fact
their employer refused or neglected to pay the WPT or the FWF. The allegation of
discrimination therefore fails.

As to the third point, the fact that the policy of Mongolia may have changed between
August 29 and December 2, 2008 does not indicate an unpredictable and non-
transparent environment, taking into account the behavior of Claimants during that
period when they refused to provide the security which had been ordered by the

Tribunal and which lead to attachments with liens by Respondent on Claimants' assets
on December 2.
As to the last point, the resort by Claimants to "Mongolia's other actions" in order to
support its contention that the change in policy resulted in a large number of
Mongolians losing their employment, it is just not good enough for the Tribunal to
conclude that Mongolia's conduct in refusing to extend the work permits constituted an
irrational decision.
This being said, the Tribunal rejects Respondent's argument concerning its restrictive
interpretation of Article 3(1) of the Treaty to the effect that protection extends only to the
operation and disposal of investment and not to its use and enjoyment. The Tribunal has
already addressed this issue in this Award.

5.8.3. CONCLUSION

In light of the above analysis, the Tribunal dismisses Claimants’ claims concerning the
events of December 2, 2008 and thereafter.

JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY OF THE COUNTERCLAIMS

Arguments of the Parties

Respondent, in its Post-Hearing Brief,5" did not discuss its counterclaims but referred
the Tribunal to its positions in that regard as stated in its Statement of Defense and its
Rejoinder.

Respondent asserts seven counterclaims:

(1) Claimants owe Windfall Profits Taxes they caused GEM to evade in violation of
law;

(2) Claimants owe back Foreign Worker Fees they caused GEM to refuse;

(3) Claimants owe taxes, fees and levies they caused GEM to evade by illicit inter-
group transfers, including non-arm's length transfers;

(4) Claimants have violated their obligations under their license agreements to
extract gold in an efficient and effective manner, causing Mongolia a loss in tax
revenue, loss of employment of Mongolian nationals and other benefits;

(5) Claimants violated their environmental obligations towards Mongolia;

(6) Claimants owe damages for gold smuggling; and

(7) Golden East failure to comply with Order from House of Lords.

Claimants submit that (i) the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to hear any of the seven
counterclaims and (ii) all the seven counterclaims are undeveloped and poorly drafted
to such an extent that they do not meet the basic pleading requirements in Articles 18(2)
and 19(4) of the UNCITRAL Rules.*!2

With respect to Tribunal's jurisdiction, Claimants argue that:

(1) Article 19(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules does not permit Mongolia's counterclaims
as this provision limits the Tribunal's jurisdiction to counterclaims arising "out of
the same contract";613

(2) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae because Mongolia's counterclaims
are not sufficiently connected to Claimants' claims as these counterclaims (i) arise
under the municipal laws of Mongolia and England and (ii) arise from different
occurrences than Claimants' claims.‘"

(3) The proper respondent to Mongolia's counterclaims is GEM.®5

Respondent, relying on Saluka, argues that the Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the
counterclaims as they have a close connection to Claimants' claims.°16

With respect to the standard of pleading, Claimants submit that:

(1) Articles 18(2) and 19(4) require that each counterclaim be specific enough that
Claimants can reply in their Statement of Defense against Counterclaims;*!7 and

(2) Mongolia's statement of counterclaim does not allow Claimants to adequately
reply in their Statement of Defense because Mongolia has failed to explain its
legal arguments and propose evidentiary support.!8

Respondent does not address the foregoing arguments.
TRIBUNAL'S ANALYSIS
The Tribunal is not of the view that Respondent has abandoned its counterclaims at the

Hearing, Respondent at no time having withdrawn its counterclaims and having
specifically referred to them in its Post-Hearing Brief.

The first point to note is that the jurisdiction of the Tribunal rests on the Treaty and not
on any contractual relationship between the Parties, even though in analyzing whether
Treaty breaches have occurred it may be necessary to analyze whether contractual
breaches have occurred and, if so, whether they are of such nature as to come under the
ambit of the Treaty provisions.

Secondly, although GEM is omnipresent in the current dispute, it is not a party to the
dispute and its obligations cannot be simply transposed into Treaty obligations of
Claimants, if any. This is all the more the case when GEM breaches of law which may
have taken place would constitute breaches of local legislation which contains its own
remedies.

Thirdly, Art. 9(3) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules states that "the Respondent may
make a counterclaim arising out of the same contracts or rely on a claim arising out of
the same contract for the purpose of a set off". It has to be noted that that Article sets the
right to counterclaim in the context of a contractual relationship, which is not the
situation in the present case where the relationship is based upon a treaty between two
States. Can a State nonetheless invoke counterclaims, when an investor decides to
initiate an arbitration under a bilateral investment treaty, even if that treaty contains no
specific provision about counterclaims?

The question was addressed in Saluka Investments BV v. The Czech Republic, which like
this case, took place under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and was initiated under
the provisions of a 1991 bilateral investment treaty between the Netherlands and the (at
the time) Czech and Slovak Republic. In the Saluka case, arguments raised by the parties
were similar to those put forward by each side in this case. However, in Saluka, the
tribunal had to make its decision in a preliminary Decision on Jurisdiction where the
tribunal simply had "to be satisfied prima facie that the counterclaim as so presented is
within the Tribunal's jurisdiction under the Treaty."©20 Nonetheless, the analysis made
by the tribunal in that case is very relevant to this one.

It states in particular that "the jurisdiction conferred upon it (the tribunal) by Article 8,
particularly when read with Article 19.3, 19.4 of the UNCITRAL Rules, is in principle
wide enough to encompass counterclaims. The language of Article 8, in referring to "all
disputes" is wide enough to include disputes giving rise to counterclaims, so long, of
course, as other relevant requirements are also met."2! Article 8 of the Saluka BIT is
similar to Article 6 of the Treaty, the first one referring to "all Disputes" while the second
refers to "disputes" and there is no reason to make a difference between the two. Later
on, the tribunal mentions that "(i)n relation specifically to counterclaims, it is necessary
that they must also satisfy those conditions which customarily govern the relationship
between a counterclaim and the primary claim to which it is a response. In particular, a

21 Ibid., 39.

- 165-

legitimate counterclaim must have a close connection with the primary claim to which it
is a response."6” [emphasis added]

690. After having noted that there were no previous decisions on counterclaim in an
arbitration involving both the UNCITRAL Rules and a bilateral investment treaty, the
Saluka tribunal reviewed a few ICSID and Iran-US Claims Tribunal decisions dealing
with the issue and concluded that it was "satisfied that those provisions (of the ICSID
Rules and of Iran-US Claims Settlement Declaration), as interpreted and applied by the
decision which have been referred to, reflect a general principle as to the nature of the
close connection which a counterclaim must have with the primary claim if a tribunal
with jurisdiction over the primary claim is to have jurisdiction also over the
counterclaim." Having concluded that Respondent was trying to bring a third party
(Nomura) with which Saluka had a close relationship through a share purchase
agreement, it concluded that it did not have jurisdiction to hear the counterclaims as
there was not enough of a close connection between them and the primary claim to
which it was a response.
691. It is worthwhile to note two quotations the Saluka tribunal cited approvingly. The first is
from an author commenting on the Iran-US Claims Tribunal decisions:
"When claims are based on contracts the Tribunal has consistently
held that it has no jurisdiction over counterclaims seeking Iranian
taxes or social security premiums allegedly owed by the claimant
and attributable to the performance of those contracts. The reason
is that such counterclaims arise from provisions of Iranian law,
not from the contracts. Even when the contracts contained clauses
requiring the claimant to comply with Iranian tax and social
security laws, it was the law, not the contract, that was the source
of the obligations. "63
692. The second is from Amco Asia Corporation and others v. Republic of Indonesia:
"The Tribunal believes that it is correct to distinguish between the
rights and obligations that are applicable to legal or natural
persons who are within the reach of a host State's jurisdiction, as a
matter of general law, and rights and obligations that are
applicable to an investor as a consequence of an investment
agreement entered into with that host state. Legal disputes
relating to the latter will fall under Article 25(1) of the Convention.
Legal disputes concerning the former in principle fall to be
decided by the appropriate procedures in the relevant jurisdiction

unless the general law generates an investment dispute under the
Convention. "64

In considering whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider the counterclaims, it
must therefore decide whether there is a close connection between them and the
primary claim from which they arose or whether the counterclaims are matters that are
otherwise covered by the general law of Respondent.

Unlike the situation expressly covered by the wording of Article 19 (3) of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, counterclaims (1), (2) and (3) filed in the present case (the
"Counterclaims") do not arise out of an investment contract or other contract to which
the foreign investors are a party and that the foreign investors would have breached.
More importantly, the Counterclaims arise out of Mongolian public law and exclusively
raise issues of non-compliance with Mongolian public law, including the tax laws of
Mongolia. All these issues squarely fall within the scope of the exclusive jurisdiction of
Mongolian courts, are matters governed by Mongolian public law, and cannot be
considered as constituting an indivisible part of the Claimants’ claims based on the BIT
and international law or as creating a reasonable nexus between the Claimants’ claims
and the Counterclaims justifying their joint consideration by an arbitral tribunal
exclusively vested with jurisdiction under the BIT.

Indeed, through the Counterclaims the Respondent seeks to extend the extraterritorial
application and enforcement of its public laws, and in particular its tax laws, to
individuals or entities not subject to and not having accepted to submit to Mongolian
public law or its courts. Thus, if the Arbitral Tribunal extended its jurisdiction to the
Counterclaims, it would be acquiescing to a possible exorbitant extension of Mongolia’s
legislative jurisdiction without any legal basis under international law to do so, since the
generally accepted principle is the non-extraterritorial enforceability of national public
laws and, specifically, of national tax laws. Were the Arbitral Tribunal to decide on the
merits of the Counterclaims in favor of the Respondent, the ensuing arbitral award
rendered in The Netherlands would be entitled to recognition and enforcement through
the 1958 New York Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards in its members countries, including Russia, with the likely effect of advancing
the enforcement of Mongolian tax laws by non-Mongolian courts in respect of non-
Mongolian nationals beyond limitations on the extraterritorial application of Mongolian
tax laws rooted in public international law. As expressed in the Iran-United States
Claims Tribunal Computer Sciences award:

"Such a claim is essentially a request that this Tribunal enforce the
tax laws of a sovereign state [...] It is a "universally accepted rule
that public law may not be extraterritorially enforced". Tax laws
are manifestation of jus imperii which may be exercised only
within the borders of a state. In addition, revenue laws are
typically enormously complex, so much so that their enforcement

is frequently assigned to specialized courts or administrative
agencies. For those reasons, actions to enforce tax laws are
universally limited to the domestic forum ( The Tribunal thus
had no jurisdiction over the [tax claim]. "625

 

As to counterclaims nos. 4, 5 and 6, they cannot be seen as having a "close connection
with the primary claim to which (they are) a response". Moreover, they are clearly
matters which strictly concern GEM and they all relate to subjects being the object of
Mongolian legislation and regulation. As to counterclaim no. 4, Respondent itself states
that GEM did not obtain its licenses from the Government but bought them from third
parties on the gray market.‘ No allegation was made by Respondent that licenses were
issued to Claimants and no evidence to that effect was introduced. Similarly, no
evidence was introduced by Respondent tying Claimants themselves to any of the
breaches alleged in counterclaims nos. 5 and 6.

As to counterclaim no. 7, this is also a matter that has no close connection with
Claimants' claims. This counterclaim has to do with an application by GEM for an
injunction against the Bank of Nova Scotia in connection with its holding of
MongolBank's gold reserves. The application was rejected by the English Courts and the
House of Lords ordered GEM to pay the Bank of Nova Scotia the cost of preparing the
written objection and the cost of preparation for the Hearing. Respondent argues that
GEM's failure to comply with the Order of the House of Lords exposes MongolBank to
liability of the amount incurred.

The decision by the House of Lords is clearly res inter alios partes and Respondent has
produced no evidence of liability actually incurred by it. The matter was not mentioned
at the Hearing and no questions were asked about it from any of the witnesses.

6.2.1 CONCLUSION

The Tribunal has no jurisdiction over any of the counterclaims advanced by Respondent.
DAMAGES

The damages issue has been postponed to a second phase of the proceedings. It will be
up to Claimants to register with the Tribunal any claim they may wish to assert in that
regard, taking into account the decision of the Tribunal in this case.

COSTS

Claimants and Respondent should bear their own costs and should share equally in the
costs of the arbitration, up to this stage.
