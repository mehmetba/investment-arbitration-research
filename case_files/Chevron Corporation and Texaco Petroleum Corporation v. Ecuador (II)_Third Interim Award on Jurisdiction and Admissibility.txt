(B) The Arbitration Agreement

The arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimants is contained in Article VI of the
Treaty between the United States of America and the Republic of Ecuador
concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment of 27
August 1993 (for ease of reference, herein called “the BIT”), providing, inter alia, as

follows:

Article VI(2): “In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute
should initially seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute
cannot be settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to
submit the dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the
dispute; or

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute-settlement
procedures; or

(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3”.

Article VI(3): “(a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not
submitted the dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six
months have elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or
company concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the
dispute for settlement by binding arbitration:

(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); ...”

Article VI(4): “Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment
dispute for settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified
in the written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent,
together with the written consent of the national or company when given under
paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:

Part |— Page 3

1.11.

1.12.

(b) an “agreement in writing” for purposes of Article IT of the United Nations
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards,
done at New York, June 10, 1958 (“New York Convention”) ...”

Article VI(5S): “Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article
shall be held in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.”

Article VI(6): “Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final
and binding on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to carry out
without delay the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its
enforcement.”

(For ease of reference, these terms cited from Article VI of the BIT, with the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976), are herein collectively called the “Arbitration

Agreement”).

In their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, the Claimants maintained
that the requirements of Article VI of the BIT had been met in full to establish this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction, namely: “First, Claimants have not submitted this investment
dispute either to the courts or administrative tribunals of Ecuador or to any other
applicable, previously-agreed dispute settlement procedure. Second, this dispute
arose shortly after the Lago Agrio Litigation was commenced in 2003, when
Ecuador refused to honor its obligations under the 1995 and 1998 investment
agreements. For that reason, the six-month waiting period has expired. In addition,
Claimants’ representatives have met with various government officials on numerous
occasions seeking to resolve this dispute. Moreover, in October 2007, Claimants
delivered a letter reiterating this dispute’s existence, seeking to resolve it via
negotiation, and notifying Ecuador that Claimants would seek international
arbitration under the BIT if the matter could not be resolved, All efforts at a

negotiated settlement failed“ (paragraph 73).

Pursuant to Article VI(3)(a)(iii) of the BIT (cited above), the Arbitration Agreement
incorporates the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (1976).

1.15.

1.16.

Pursuant to Article 3(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, these arbitration

proceedings are deemed to have commenced on 29 September 2009.

By agreement of the Parties (as confirmed by the Tribunal’s Agreed Procedural
Order No 1), the legal place of this arbitration is The Hague, The Netherlands within
the meaning of Article 16 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. The Netherlands is

a State that is a party to the New York Convention.

By further agreement of the Parties (as also confirmed by the Tribunal’s Agreed
Procedural Order No 1), English and Spanish are the official languages of this
arbitration within the meaning of Article 17 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules;
and, as between them, English is the authoritative language, with all oral
proceedings to be simultaneously interpreted and transcribed into English and

Spanish.

(C) The Arbitration Tribunal

Pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal is comprised of three arbitrators

appointed thereunder as follows:

Dr. Grigera Naon: In their Notice of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, the
Claimants notified the Respondent of their appointment as co-arbitrator of Dr.
Horacio A. Grigera Naén, of 2708 35th Place NW Washington, D.C. 20007, United

States of America;

Professor Lowe: On 4 December 2009, the Respondent notified the Claimants of its
appointment as co-arbitrator of Professor Vaughan Lowe QC, of Essex Court

Chambers, 24 Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.

Mr. Veeder: By email of 22 January 2010, the Claimants informed the Permanent

Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) that the two co-arbitrators were unable to consent on

Part |— Page 5

1.17.

1.18.

1.19.

1.20.

the appointment of the presiding third arbitrator. Pursuant to the agreement between
the Parties concerning the selection of the presiding third arbitrator, the PCA was
requested to act as appointing authority and “if the party appointed arbitrators cannot
agree on the President by Jan. 22 [2010], then the PCA will appoint the President but
only after the PCA provides the parties an opportunity to comment on the candidate
under consideration by the PCA.” Accordingly, on 25 February 2010 and in
accordance with the Parties’ agreement, the Secretary-General of the PCA appointed
as the presiding third arbitrator Mr. V.V. Veeder, of Essex Court Chambers, 24
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2A 3EG, United Kingdom.

By further agreement of the Parties, the PCA’s International Bureau was appointed
to administer these arbitration proceedings, with Mr Martin Doe (of the PCA) acting

as Administrative Secretary to the Tribunal.

(D) Principal Written Submissions

The Claimants submitted their Notice of Arbitration of 23 September 2009 and their
Memorial on the Merits of 6 September 2010. In response to the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections listed below, the Claimants submitted their Counter-

6 November 2010.

The Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction on 26 July 2010 and its

Reply Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections on 6 October 2010.
Thereafter, the Parties have made many more written submissions in these

Part |— Page 8

“Accordingly, Claimants request an Order and Award granting the following relief:

J. Declaring that under the 1995, 1996 and 1998 Settlement and Release
Agreements, Claimants have no liability or responsibility for environmental impact,
including but not limited to any alleged liability for impact to human health, the
ecosystem, indigenous cultures, the infrastructure, or any liability for unlawful
profits, or for performing any further environmental remediation arising out of the
former Consortium that was jointly owned by TexPet and Ecuador, or under the
expired Concession Contract between TexPet and Ecuador.

 

2. Declaring that Ecuador has breached the 1995, 1996, and 1998 Settlement and
Release Agreements and the U.S.-Ecuador BIT, including its obligations to afford
fair and equitable treatment, full protection and security, an effective means of
enforcing rights, non-arbitrary treatment, non-discriminatory treatment, and to
observe obligations it entered into under the investment agreements.

3. Declaring that under the Treaty and applicable international law, Chevron is not
liable for any judgment rendered in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

4. Declaring that any judgment rendered against Chevron in the Lago Agrio
Litigation is not final, conclusive or enforceable.

5. Declaring that Ecuador or Petroecuador (or Ecuador and Petroecuador jointly)
are exclusively liable for any judgment rendered in the Lago Agrio Litigation.

6. Ordering Ecuador to use all measures necessary to prevent any judgment against
Chevron in the Lago Agrio Litigation from becoming final, conclusive or
enforceable.

7. Ordering Ecuador to use all measures necessary to enjoin enforcement of any
judgment against Chevron rendered in the Lago Agrio Litigation, including
enjoining the nominal Plaintiffs from obtaining any related attachments, levies or
other enforcement devices.

8. Ordering Ecuador to make a written representation to any court in which the
nominal Plaintiffs attempt to enforce a judgment from the Lago Agrio Litigation,
stating that the judgment is not final, enforceable or conclusive;

9. Ordering Ecuador to dismiss the Criminal Proceedings in Ecuador against
Messrs. Ricardo Veiga and Rodrigo Pérez.

10. Ordering Ecuador not to seek the detention, arrest or extradition of Messrs
Veiga or Pérez or the encumbrance of any of their property.

11. Awarding Claimants indemnification against Ecuador in connection with a Lago

Agrio judgment, including a specific obligation by Ecuador to pay Claimants the
sum of money awarded in to the Lago Agrio judgment.

1.30.

12. Awarding Claimants any sums that the nominal Lago Agrio Plaintiffs collect
against Claimants or their affiliates in connection with enforcing a Lago Agrio
judgment.

13. Awarding all costs and attorneys’ fees incurred by Claimants in (1) defending
the Lago Agrio Litigation and the Criminal Proceedings, (2) pursuing this
Arbitration, (3) uncovering the collusive fraud through investigation and discovery
proceedings in the United States, (4) opposing the efforts by Ecuador and the Lago
Agrio Plaintiffs to stay this Arbitration through litigation in the United States, (5) as
well as all costs associated with responding to the relentless public relations
campaign by which the Lago Agrio Plaintiffs’ lawyers (in collusion with Ecuador)
attacked Chevron with false and fraudulent accusations concerning this case. These
damages will be quantified at a later stage in these proceedings.

14, Awarding moral damages to compensate Claimants for the non-pecuniary harm
that they have suffered due to Ecuador’s outrageous and illegal conduct.

15. Awarding both pre- and post-award interest (compounded quarterly) until the
date of payment.

16. Any other and further relief that the Tribunal deems just and proper.”

In their Notice of Arbitration, the Claimants had requested formal relief in different

but, for present purposes, materially similar terms (paragraph 76).

This Award does not decide the merits of any of the Claimants’ claims or any of the
relief formally pleaded in the Claimant’s Notice of Arbitration and Memorial on the

Merits.

PART III

THE PARTIES’ JURISDICTIONAL DISPUTES

(A) — Introduction

It is appropriate here to summarise, for the purpose of this Award, the submissions
made by the Respondent and the Claimants respectively in regard to the Respondent’s
several objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide, on the merits, the

Claimants’ claims arising from their dispute with the Respondent under the BIT.

This summary, although inevitably lengthy, does not attempt to describe all the
submissions made by the Parties as regards the Tribunal’s disputed jurisdiction in this
arbitration. Nonetheless, the Tribunal has considered and addressed the Parties’
submissions in full; and the fact that a particular submission has not been summarised
below should not be taken as indicating that it has been left unconsidered by the

Tribunal.

It is necessary first to set out, in the form of chronology, the relevant facts alleged by
the Claimants. As explained below in Part IV of this Award, the Tribunal is required
under the BIT and the Arbitration Agreement to take account of the factual allegations
pleaded by the Claimants as regards the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections. The
Tribunal makes no finding in regard to any such facts in this Award; nor could it do so
at this early stage of the arbitration when the Parties’ cases and evidence on the merits

of their respective claims and defences are materially incomplete.

(B) The Claimants’ Factual Chronology

This factual chronology of the principal events alleged by the Claimants is taken by
the Tribunal largely from Part II (“Factual Background”) of the Claimants’ Notice of
Arbitration, for necessary reasons explained above. This chronology is prepared by the
Tribunal for the purpose only of this Award; and it has not been agreed by the
Respondent; nor, as also explained above, does it contain any disputed facts found by

the Tribunal.

1964-1972: In 1964, the Respondent granted oil exploration and production rights in
Ecuador's Oriente region to TexPet and the Ecuadorian Gulf Oil Company (“Gulf”)
under a Concession Agreement dated 21 February 1964 made with these companies’
local subsidiaries operating as a Consortium. Oriente lies in Ecuador’s north-eastern
region, in the Amazon Basin. In 1967, this Consortium discovered oil in Oriente and
drilled its first well; and in 1972, nine oil fields were developed and an oil pipeline

constructed.

1973 Concession Agreement: On 6 August 1973, the Respondent, TexPet and Gulf
entered into a further concession agreement with a term expiring on 6 June 1992
(herein called “the 1973 Concession Agreement”). It was also agreed (inter alia) to
grant to PetroEcuador (also known as “CEPE”) an option to acquire an interest in the
Consortium; and in 1974 PetroEcuador exercised that option, thereby acquiring a 25%
stake in the Consortium. On 31 December 1976, PetroEcuador acquired Gulf’s
remaining interest, thereby acquiring a 62.5% interest in the Consortium. TexPet

retained its 37.5% interest until the Consortium ended in 1992.

During the term of the 1973 Concession Agreement, the Consortium drilled 312 wells,
developed 16 producing wells, built 18 production stations, installed extensive
pipelines and constructed 6 base camps. The Consortium made all decisions on

exploration, financing and operations for the concession; it paid royalties and other

Part III — Page 2

3.8

3.9

3.10

3.11

fees to the Respondent, and it was subject to Ecuadorian Governmental regulation.
From 1965, TexPet, as the Consortium's first operator, conducted the physical work
for the Consortium; but it was the Consortium as a whole that enjoyed the
concession’s profits and also bore the operational risks and any liabilities associated
with its operations. In 1990, Petroamazonas (PetroEcuador’s subsidiary created

specifically for this task) assumed the role of operator in place of TexPet.

Throughout the term of the Consortium’s concession, the Ecuadorian Government
regulated, approved and, in many instances, mandated the Consortium’s activities; and
no facilities were constructed, nor wells drilled, nor oil extracted without the
Government’s oversight and approval. Specifically, section 46 of the 1973 Concession
Agreement imposed obligations on the Consortium in regard to the preservation of
natural resources; and in 1976 the Respondent enacted the “Law for Prevention and

Control of Environmental Contamination”.

During the existence of the Consortium, approximately 90% of the revenues generated
by the concession (approximately US$ 23 billion) were paid directly to the
Respondent in the form of revenues, royalties, taxes and subsidies; the Respondent
and PetroEcuador held full regulatory control over the Consortium (as well as a
majority share of its ownership), and they received almost all of the economic benefits
from the Consortium’s operations. Texaco and TexPet received about US$ 500

million.

In 1990 (when Petroamazonas assumed the role of operator), TexPet and the
Respondent agreed to conduct an environmental audit of the Consortium's oil fields.
Two international contractors conducted separate environmental audits to ascertain the
scope of environmental impacts from the Consortium's operations. These audits
identified certain areas for environmental remediation and estimated that the total cost

to remediate such areas would be approximately US$ 8 million to US$ 13 million.

1992: The 1973 Concession Agreement came to an end on 6 June 1992; and TexPet
then transferred its interest in the Consortium to PetroEcuador. TexPet had thus been a
minority member of the Consortium which had explored for and produced oil in

Ecuador for about 28 years (from 1964 to 1992); and it had been the Consortium’s

3.15

operator under the 1973 Concession Agreement for about 25 years (to 1990). After
1992, TexPet had no ownership interest or involvement in any production activities in

Ecuador.

1994: In 1994, the Respondent decided that it would not participate with TexPet in
conducting environmental remediation. Thus, rather than jointly funding remediation
of the entire concession area, the parties agreed to identify a set of remediation
obligations corresponding only to TexPet's minority ownership interest in the
Consortium in exchange for TexPet being released from any further liabilities or

remediation obligations for environmental impact.

The 1994 MOU: Accordingly, on 14 December 1994, the Respondent (by its Ministry
of Energy and Mines), PetroEcuador and TexPet signed a Memorandum of
Understanding (herein called the “1994 MOU”) in which they agreed to “negotiate the
full and complete release of TexPet's obligations for environmental impact arising
from the operations of the Consortium.” The 1994 MOU referred expressly to the
“environmental impacts” caused by the Consortium’s operations: see particularly

Articles 1(d), IV(b) and V of the 1994 MOU.

The “release” of TexPet would be accomplished in two steps. First, from the outset,
TexPet would be released from any responsibility for environmental impacts not
included in the “Scope of Work” (which was to specify the remediation tasks to be
performed by TexPet). Second, TexPet would be released from any responsibility

related to the Scope of Work upon performance of such Work.

Together, this two-step release would discharge TexPet from any claims that the
Respondent and PetroEcuador might have against TexPet concerning environmental
impacts caused by the Consortium’s operations. At that time, only the Respondent’s
Government could require the environmental remediation of public land; and therefore
by law (according to the Claimants) a settlement with the Respondent would fully
discharge TexPet of any responsibility that might exist for environmental impacts on
public land. However (as the Claimants acknowledge) it would not affect potential

individualised claims for alleged personal injury or damage to private property.

3.19

3.20

The 1995 Scope of Work: On 23 March 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and
TexPet signed the Scope of Work identifying the particular sites and projects that
would constitute TexPet's remediation tasks under the 1994 MOU. TexPet also agreed
to finance certain socio-economic projects in Ecuador; and the Respondent insisted (as
part of the consideration for TexPet’s release) that TexPet should negotiate with four
specified municipalities in the Oriente region claiming compensation for alleged

environmental harm resulting from the Consortium's operations.

The 1995 Settlement Agreement: On 4 May 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and
TexPet made a Settlement Agreement (herein called the “1995 Settlement
Agreement”). It provided in its preamble that TexPet agreed to undertake
“Environmental Remedial Work in consideration for being released and discharged of
all its legal and contractual obligations and liability for Environmental Impact arising
out of the Consortium's operations.” The term “Environmental Impact” included:
“[a]ny solid, liquid, or gaseous substance present or released into the environment in
such concentration or condition, the presence or release of which causes, or has the

potential to cause harm to human health or the environment.”

As contemplated in the 1994 MOU, the 1995 Settlement Agreement: (i) released
TexPet from all of the Respondent’s and PetroEcuador’s claims based on any
Environmental Impact (except for claims related to TexPet’s performance of the
Scope of Work); and (ii) provided that TexPet would be released from all remaining
environmental liability upon completion of the remediation obligations described in

that Scope of Work.

TexPet and PetroEcuador made a further agreement dated 17 November 1995,
effectively confirming TexPet’s obligations in the 1995 Settlement Agreement (page

43).

1995-1998: For the remediation work contemplated by the 1995 Settlement
Agreement, the Respondent provided a list of approved, independent environmental
engineering contractors; and from that list, TexPet selected Woodward-Clyde, a large
and reputable environmental engineering firm. Woodward-Clyde began its work by

conducting additional investigations of the sites listed in the Scope of Work and

Part III — Page 5

3.21

3.22

3.23

developing a “Remedial Action Plan”. The Remedial Action Plan identified the
specific pits at each well-site that required remediation under the criteria set out in the
1995 Settlement Agreement; and it further clarified the remedial action to be taken at
each site. In September 1995, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and TexPet each

approved that Remedial Action Plan.

Between October 1995 and September 1998, Woodward-Clyde conducted (on behalf
of and paid for by TexPet) the remediation required by the 1995 Settlement
Agreement and the Remedial Action Plan. As part of its work, Woodward-Clyde and
its sub-contractors undertook the following items: remediate and close 162 pits and 6
spill areas at 133 well sites; remediate contaminated soil (roughly 6,000 cubic meters)
at 13 production stations, 5 abandoned installations and 17 well sites; identify and
supply water treatment and processing equipment at 6 production stations and at 4
well sites; design and implement plugging and abandonment work at 18 previously
abandoned well sites; recover, treat, upgrade and recycle approximately 28,000 barrels
of hydrocarbon material from the remediated pits; and re-vegetate affected areas using
native Amazonian plant species, or turn those areas over to the local communities for
alternate land use. The responsible ministries and agencies of the Respondent’s

Government’s oversaw and approved all of this remediation and reclamation work.

As already indicated above, the 1995 Settlement Agreement also required TexPet to
provide socio-economic compensation by funding certain community development
projects in Ecuador. Specifically, TexPet paid US$ 1 million for the construction of
four educational centres and adjacent medical facilities (which included funds for two
river ambulances); paid US$ 1 million for agricultural and forestry projects to be
carried out by indigenous and peasant organizations in the Amazon Basin; and
purchased and donated an airplane for the use of the Amazon Basin's indigenous

communities.

The 1996 Municipal and Provincial Releases: As requested by the Respondent,
TexPet also settled disputes with the four municipalities of the Oriente region. TexPet
entered into written settlements with these four municipalities, as well as with the
province of Sucumbios and the Napo consortium of municipalities (herein collectively

called the “Municipal and Provincial Releases’). Under these settlements, TexPet paid

Part III — Page 6

3.24

3.25

3.26

3.27

approximately US$ 3.7 million for (inter alia) potable water and sewage projects; and
TexPet, with its parent company, affiliates and others were then released from any
liability by the municipalities (including liability for environmental impact) for any of
the Consortium’s activities in the area of the concession. These settlements were

approved and confirmed by Ecuadorian Courts.

In all, TexPet paid approximately US$ 40 million on environmental remediation and
community development in Ecuador pursuant to the 1995 Settlement Agreement and

the Municipal and Provincial Releases.

The BIT: The BIT entered into force on 11 May 1997. (This is not disputed by the

Parties).

The 1998 Final Release: During the three-year period from October 1995 to
September 1998, the Respondent’s Government issued nine actas documenting its
acceptance that pits listed therein were remediated under TexPet’s agreements and
certifying the adequacy of the remediation work that it had supervised and evaluated
on a continuous basis. Each of those actas was in turn supported by hundreds of
certification documents. On 30 September 1998, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and
TexPet executed the Acta Final, certifying that TexPet had performed all of its
obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and releasing TexPet from any and
all environmental liability arising from the Consortium's operations (herein called “the
1998 Final Release”). The Respondent and PetroEcuador retained responsibility for

any remaining and future environmental impact and remediation work.

The Aguinda Litigation: In November 1993 (before the 1995 Settlement Agreement &
1998 Final Release but after the Consortium’s termination in 1992), U.S. attorneys
filed a putative class action lawsuit for certain plaintiffs against Texaco in the U.S.
Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York (the “Aguinda
litigation”). The Aguinda plaintiffs, claiming to represent 30,000 members of a class
residing in or near the Oriente region, claimed substantial compensation from Texaco
for personal injuries and damage to their own property allegedly caused by TexPet’s

actions as the Consortium’s operator.

Part III — Page 7

3.28

3.29

3.30

3.31

Texaco applied to the New York District Court for an order dismissing the complaint
on grounds of (inter alia) forum non conveniens; and the Respondent supported the
application. The Respondent also advised the New York Court that the Respondent
was “the legal protector of the quality of the air, water, atmosphere and environment
within its frontiers”, as well as “legal owner of the rivers, streams and natural
resources and all public lands where the [Consortium’s] oil producing operations”
took place; that the plaintiffs had no independent right to litigate over public lands and
that “the [Aguinda] plaintiffs’ attorneys in this matter are attempting to usurp rights
that belong to the government of the Republic of the Respondent under the
Constitution and laws of Ecuador and under international law.” In an interview, the
Respondent's Ambassador to the United States of America confirmed that “the soil,
the subsoil, the vegetation, the air ... all of these are property belonging to the Nation
of Ecuador, not to the individuals living there, and not to the lawyers drawing up the
claims ... Nobody can seek compensation for damages in property belonging to the

Ecuadorian Government. Only the Government can litigate. No third parties.”

In 1996, the New York District Court granted Texaco’s application to dismiss the
Aguinda litigation on the ground of forum non conveniens; and the Aguinda plaintiffs
then appealed this decision to the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals. In
1998, the Court of Appeals vacated the decision and remitted the case back to the New

York District Court.

During this period, the Aguinda plaintiffs' lawyers (reportedly, according to the
Claimants) also lobbied for new legislation in Ecuador that would enable them to file
new claims against Texaco. In July 1999 (after the 1998 Final Release), the
Respondent enacted the Law of Environmental Management, also known as the
Environmental Management Act (the “1999 EMA”). Article 41 of the 1999 EMA
grants to individuals the right to bring a complaint to enforce “collective
environmental rights”; and Article 43 allows individuals “linked by a common interest
and directly affected by the harmful action or omission” to file a complaint “for

damages and for the deterioration caused to health or the environment.”

In 2000, the New York District Court again dismissed the Aguinda litigation on the

grounds of forum non conveniens, subject to Texaco’s consent to the jurisdiction of

Part III — Page 8

3.32

the Ecuadorian courts (as directed by the United States Second Circuit Court of
Appeals). In 2002, the United States Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the

decision of the District Court.

Texaco’s Jurisdictional Consent: The consent as to Ecuadorian jurisdiction by Texaco
before the District Court and Court of Appeals was expressed on 11 January 1999, in
writing (here cited from Sections A and B of its Notice of Agreements in Satisfying

Forum Non Conveniens and International Comity Conditions):

“Section A - Actions to Which Agreements Apply: Texaco Inc.’s agreements herein
apply only to a lawsuit that meets all the following conditions:

1. The lawsuit must be brought by a named plaintiff in Aguinda. et al. v, Texaco Inc.,
Case No. 93 Civ. 7527 (JSR) (hereafter “Aguinda”).

2. The lawsuit must have been filed in an appropriate court of competent civil
jurisdiction in Ecuador;

3. The lawsuit must arise out of the same events and occurrences alleged in the
Aguinda Complaint filed in this Court on November 3, 1993.

4. To insure prompt notice, a copy of each Complaint intended to be filed by Aguinda
plaintiffs (or any of them) in Ecuador must have been delivered to Texaco Inc.’s
designated representative in Ecuador identified in Section B(1) below not later than
the actual date on which it is filed.

Section B - Agreements: With respect to any lawsuit that meets the conditions set forth
above (a “Foreign Lawsuit”), Texaco Inc. hereby makes the following agreements:

1. Texaco Inc. will accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit in accordance with
the applicable law of Ecuador. Texaco Inc.'s designated representative in Ecuador
authorized to accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit shall be: [Name and
address of Texaco’s representative in Quito Ecuador here omitted]. The authority of
[Texaco’s representative] to accept service of process in a Foreign Lawsuit will
become effective upon final dismissal of this action and judgment by this Court. (The
judgment shall become “final” upon the exhaustion of all available appeals or, if no
appeal is filed, the time for filing appeals has expired.)

2. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive and/or not assert an objection
based on lack of in personam jurisdiction to the civil jurisdiction of a court of
competent jurisdiction in Ecuador.

3. In any such Foreign Lawsuit, Texaco Inc. will waive any statute of limitations-
based defense that matured during the period of time between: (a) the filing date of
the Aguinda Complaint in this Court (i.e. November 3, 1993), and (b) the 60th day
after the dismissal of this action and judgment becomes final, as defined in Section

Part III — Page 9

3.33

3.34

3.35

B(1) above. Texaco Inc., however, is not waiving any statute of limitations-based
rights or defenses with respect to the passage of time prior to November 3, 1993, and
Texaco Inc. expressly reserves its right to contend in a Foreign Lawsuit that plaintiffs’
claims were barred, in whole or in part, by the applicable statute of limitations as of
November 3, 1993 when they filed their Complaint in this Court.

4. Texaco Inc. agrees that discovery conducted to date during the pendency of
Aguinda in this Court may be used by any party in a Foreign Lawsuit, including
Texaco Inc., to the same extent as if that discovery had been conducted in proceedings
there, subject to all parties' rights to challenge the admissibility and relevance of such
discovery under the applicable rules of evidence.

5. Texaco Inc. agrees to satisfy a final judgment (i.e. a judgment with respect to which
all appeals have been exhausted), if any, entered against it in a Foreign Lawsuit in
favor of a named plaintiff in Aguinda, subject to Texaco Inc.'s reservation of its right
to contest any such judgment under New York's Recognition of Foreign Country
Money Judgments Act, 7B N.Y. Civ. Prac. L&R § 5301-09 (McKinney 1978).”

In 2001, Texaco and Chevron (with their subsidiaries, including TexPet) “merged”
under the laws of the USA. (The legal effect of this merger is at issue in the Parties’
dispute). Chevron was not earlier involved with TexPet or its past activities in

Ecuador.

The Lago Agrio Litigation: On 30 May 2003, a different but overlapping group of 48
Ecuadorian citizens as plaintiffs filed a complaint against Texaco as defendant in the
Superior Court of Nueva Loja in Lago Agrio (the “Lago Agrio litigation”). The Lago
Agrio plaintiffs claimed damages and other remedies for environmental remediation
of former Consortium sites pursuant to a retroactive application of the 1999 EMA.
The Claimants describe this complaint as a “diffuse claim’, ie. a claim where the
plaintiffs are not seeking individual damages in respect of any personal injuries to
themselves or any damage to their own property but are instead advancing public,
collective and non-individual rights that belong to all in the region. These plaintiffs
were and remain supported by some of the same U.S. attorneys who had filed the

Aguinda litigation in the New York Courts.

The complaint named Texaco as the defendant; but it impleaded Chevron as a
defendant on the basis that, upon the “merger” in 2001, Chevron was “substituted” for
Texaco’s “rights and obligations” and was therefore liable to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs

(paragraph I.11). The Respondent is not a named party in the Lago Agrio litigation.

Part III — Page 10

3.36

3.37

3.38

3.39

In Chevron’s answer of October 2003 to the Lago Agrio complaint, Chevron objected
to the Lago Agrio Court's assumption and exercise of jurisdiction over Chevron on the
basis that (i) Chevron is a distinct legal entity from Texaco that first acquired an
indirect ownership interest in TexPet only in 2001, with TexPet, Texaco and Chevron
still remaining distinct legal entities; (ii) Chevron was never the operator of the
Consortium or a party to any of the concession contracts; nor is it the legal successor-
in-interest of Texaco; and (iii) it was Texaco, not Chevron, that consented to the
jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian Courts upon the Second Circuit Court of Appeals’

decision confirming the District Court’s order dismissing the A guinda litigation.

Chevron also requested the dismissal of the Lago Agrio complaint based on the 1995
Settlement Agreement, the Municipal and Provincial Releases and the 1998 Final
Release. In particular, Chevron contended that TexPet, TexPet’s parent company,
affiliates and principals received a full and complete release from any such liability
under the 1995 Settlement Agreement (thereby including TexPet’s future indirect
owner, Chevron); that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs lacked standing to bring any claims
under the 1999 EMA; and that the 1999 EMA should not be applied retroactively to

the Consortium’s operations which had ended many years earlier, in 1992.

Chevron also notified the Respondent by letter of October 2003 that the Lago Agrio
claims clearly fell within the scope of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Municipal
and Provincial Releases and the 1998 Final Release; and that the Respondent and
PetroEcuador should bear financial responsibility for any obligation relating to the
Consortium and from any court rulings that might be made against Chevron. Chevron
also requested the Respondent: (i) to notify the Lago Agrio Court that, under the 1995
Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release, Chevron, Texaco and TexPet could
not be liable for environmental damage or for remediation work arising from the
former Consortium’s operations; and (ii) to indemnify, protect and defend the rights of
Chevron, Texaco and TexPet in connection with the Lago Agrio litigation. According

to the Claimants, the Respondent did not do so.

The BIT Claims: In regard to the Lago Agrio litigation, the Claimants contend that,

through the Respondent’s actions and inactions in breach of its several obligations

Part III — Page 11

3.40

3.41

3.42

under the BIT to both Claimants, the Respondent is improperly seeking to impose
upon Chevron the public remediation obligations and liabilities that belong
exclusively to the Respondent and PetroEcuador; that never belonged to Chevron;
from which the Respondent and PetroEcuador expressly released TexPet, its parent
company, affiliates and principals (thereby including Chevron); that rather than
honouring its obligations under the BIT and the relevant agreements made with
TexPet, the Respondent has chosen to collude unlawfully with the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs in order to evade the Respondent’s own legal responsibilities and to secure
an illegitimate financial windfall from Chevron; that the Respondent has pursued a co-
ordinated strategy with the Lago Agrio plaintiffs that involves the Respondent's
various state organs; that the Respondent’s executive branch has publicly announced
its support for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs; that the Respondent has sought and obtained
the sham criminal indictments of two Chevron attorneys (Messrs Viega and Pérez) in
an attempt to undermine the 1995 Settlement Agreement and to interfere with
Chevron's defence in the Lago Agrio litigation; that the Respondent’s judicial branch
has conducted the Lago Agrio litigation in total disregard of Ecuadorian law,
international standards of fairness and Chevron’s basic rights as to due process and

natural justice, in co-ordination between the Respondent and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs.

As already indicated, the Claimants’ claims in this arbitration are, as regards their

formal prayer for relief on the merits, set out above in Part I of this Award.

(C) The Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction

On 26 July 2010, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction, disputing
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in this arbitration to decide the Claimants’ claims in this

arbitration (on grounds of jurisdiction and admissibility).

Factual Introduction: In its introductory observations, the Respondent summarises its

version of the background to the Parties’ dispute, from the 1973 Concession

Part III — Page 12

3.43

3.44

Agreement, under which the Respondent granted to TexPet the right to explore for and
produce oil in Ecuador, the Aguinda litigation, the disputes with the Municipalities,

the various settlement agreements, to the Lago Agrio litigation.

In relation to TexPet’s original investment and operations in Ecuador, the Respondent
emphasises that the 1973 Concession Agreement expired in 1992, five years before
the BIT came into force. It stresses that “TexPet has had no ownership interest or
involvement in any production activities in Ecuador” since 1992; and that “Chevron
has never invested in Ecuador ... whatever investment it claims exists for purposes of
this dispute derives solely from TexPet’s purported “investments”.!

The Respondent records that in 1993 a group of Ecuadorian citizens brought a class
action as plaintiffs against Texaco as defendant in the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York (i.e. “the Aguinda litigation”) on behalf of all the
citizens and residents of Oriente in the region of the Amazon. The Respondent asserts
that, in the Aguinda litigation, the plaintiffs were seeking environmental remediation
of the land and waters of the region, in addition to personal damages.” The
Respondent recounts that Texaco contended that the plaintiffs’ claims in the Aguinda
litigation should be dismissed by the New York District Court on the ground of forum
non conveniens (under US law) because the Ecuadorian Courts were a more
appropriate forum; that, in 1996, the District Court granted Texaco’s motion to
dismiss the plaintiffs’ action; that, in 1998, the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals
vacated such dismissal on the basis (inter alia) that the dismissal was inappropriate
unless Texaco consented to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian Courts; and that, in the
light of this appellate decision, Texaco then undertook to accept the jurisdiction of the
Ecuadorian Courts in relation to claims “arising out of the same events and

occurrences alleged in the Aguinda complaint”.*

The Respondent notes that in 1994 four municipalities in the Oriente region filed legal

complaints in Ecuador against TexPet, alleging environmental contamination.‘

According to the Respondent, these several disputes provide the general background
to the various settlement agreements made by the Respondent, the municipalities,
PetroEcuador and TexPet. The Respondent also highlights the following features of

these different agreements:

First, under the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Respondent, PetroEcuador and
TexPet mutually acknowledged that: “all the rights and obligations of each of the
parties with respect to the other and deriving from the [1973 Concession Agreement]

are terminated”.
Second, environmental issues were excluded from the 1995 Settlement Agreement.®
Third, the 1994 MOU was entered into by TexPet as a voluntary agreement.’

Fourth, by its terms, the objective of the 1994 MOU was only to provide a mechanism
to release TexPet from liability for those claims belonging to the Ministry of Energy
and Mines (for the Respondent) and PetroEcuador; and the Respondent asserts that it
expressly rejected a suggestion from TexPet that the intended release should extend to
claims by the people of the Amazon region. On the contrary, the Respondent points
out that the final version of the MOU contained a “carve out” (Article VIII, which
made it clear that the MOU would apply without prejudice to the potential rights of

third parties against PetroEcuador and TexPet as members of the Consortium.*

Fifth, the 1995 Settlement Agreement, consistent with the objectives of the 1994
MOU, operated only to release TexPet from claims by the Respondent and
PetroEcuador. The Respondent also asserts that there is nothing in the 1995 Settlement

Agreement which requires it to intervene in private litigation by others. Further, it is

 

Part III — Page 14

3.52

3.53

3.54

3.55

  

contended that the Respondent is prohibited by Ecuadorian law from waiving the

rights of its own citizens to seek legal redress.”

Sixth, the Municipal and Provincial Releases made in May 1996 similarly operated to
release only these municipalities’ claims against TexPet, Texaco, their affiliates and
related companies, etc; and these settlements did not release the rights of non-parties

to these releases. '°

Seventh, in relation to the 1998 Final Release, the Respondent emphasises that this
released TexPet only from its obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and
did not contain any “hold harmless” or indemnification obligation by the Respondent
in favour of TexPet or Texaco in relation to the Aguinda litigation or any other

environmental claims.'!

In relation to the Lago Agrio litigation, the Respondent points out that it was brought
in Ecuador by all plaintiffs in the New York Aguinda litigation and that the main
allegations made in the Lago Agrio litigation are essentially identical to those made in
the Aguinda litigation.” The Respondent notes that the principal claims in the Lago

Agrio litigation are based upon Ecuadorian substantive law.'3

Finally, as regards this factual introduction, the Respondent submits that these BIT
proceedings were commenced just months after the U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York had brought to an end the AAA arbitration proceedings
which had been commenced by TexPet and Chevron against the Respondent. The
Respondent asserts that, in these BIT proceedings, the Claimants are asserting the
same “release” and “indemnification” claims which they had raised and then agreed to

dismiss in the AAA Arbitration.'*

Jurisdictional Objections: The Respondent’s jurisdictional objections are further
considered seriatim below, in Part IV of this Award. The following is intended by the

Tribunal merely as a convenient summary of the Respondent’s principal objections.

(i)-(iii) Ratione Materiae: The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks

jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT because:

(i) The dispute does not arise out of or relate to an investment in Ecuador, for the

purposes of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT; or

(ii) The dispute does not arise out of an investment agreement, for the purposes of

Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT; and

(iii) | The Claimants have no prima facie case on the merits.

(iv) Fork in the Road: The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction by
virtue of Article VI(3) of the BIT (its “fork in the road” provision) because the

Claimants have previously elected to pursue claims in an alternative forum.

(v) Third Party Rights: The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
because it would be required to determine the rights of third parties, i.e. non-parties to

these arbitration proceedings.

It is convenient to summarise the Respondent’s case under each of these five

objections.

(i) Article VI(1)(c): The Respondent contends that the Claimants rely upon two
characterisations of an “investment” for the purposes of Art VI(1)(c): (i) the “original”
investment, namely “TexPet’s underlying oil operations in Ecuador”; and (ii) their

rights under the Settlement Agreements.'°

With respect to the first characterisation of an investment, whilst the Respondent

acknowledges that TexPet originally did invest in Ecuador, the Respondent maintains

., para. 46

Part III — Page 16

3.63

3.64

3.65

3.66

that this investment came to an end in 1992.'° The Respondent therefore denies that
TexPet can bring its present claims within the scope of that original investment; and it

specifically denies the Claimant’s argument based on the “lifespan of the investment”.

In this regard, the Respondent discounts the principal legal material relied upon by the
Claimants, namely the Commercial Cases Dispute, where the tribunal decided in its

award:

“The Claimants’ investments were largely liquidated when they transferred their
ownership in the concession to PetroEcuador and upon the conclusion of various
Settlement Agreements with Ecuador. Yet, those investments were and are not yet fully
wound up because of ongoing claims for money arising directly out of their oil
extraction and production activities under their contracts with Ecuador and its state
owned oil company. These claims were excluded from any of the Settlement
Agreements...”

Although it involved the same disputing parties as this arbitration, the Respondent
submits that the award in the Commercial Cases Dispute does not have any res
judicata effect, as the Claimants contend, because, that arbitration did not decide the
same issue as is raised in this arbitration and, in particular, because the reasoning in
that award was based solely on the 1973 Concession Agreement and did not analyse

the settlement agreements at issue in this case. "

Further, the Respondent contends that the awards in both the Commercial Cases
Dispute and Mondev (the other legal material cited by the Claimants on the “lifespan
of the investment’) are both distinguishable from the present case. In both those cases,
the interest or agreement said to constitute the “investment” was the direct subject of
the claims in issue; whereas, in the present case, the 1973 Concession Agreement is
not at issue in the Lago Agrio litigation. On the contrary, the Lago Agrio litigation
puts in issue the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Final Release which are

“stand-alone” agreements and not investments. 1s

The Respondent also relies on contemporaneous documentation to dismiss the

Claimants’ assertion that the release, remediation with other activities and the Lago

 

Part III — Page 17

3.67

3.68

Agrio litigation “are all part of the continuation, winding up, disposition, and
enforcement of legal and contractual rights arising directly from, and part of,

Claimants’ Ecuadorian investment.”!°

With respect to the Claimants’ second characterisation of an investment, the
Respondent contends that none of the settlement agreements (and none of the rights
and obligations contained therein) invoked by the Claimants bears the intrinsic
economic characteristics of an investment under Article I of the BIT.*? More
particularly, the Respondent, relying on the Pantechniki and Romak awards, submits
that an investment “must exhibit the inherent economic characteristics of an
investment”, including “the commitment of resources to the economy of the host state
by the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial
return.””! The Respondent also cites the five-fold “litmus test” for an investment, as
advanced in Salini v Morocco” (under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention). The
Respondent further asserts that the 2004 US Model BIT has clarified the definition of
“investment” so as to incorporate both legal and economic components, reflecting the

criteria suggested in Pantechniki.”>

The Respondent then proceeds to analyse the settlement agreements in the light of
these legal materials; and it concludes that none of them exhibits these essential
characteristics of an investment.** The Respondent makes the following specific

points:

(a) Any rights created by the 1994 MOU were superseded by the 1995 Settlement
Agreement; and accordingly such rights did not exist when the BIT entered into

force in 1997;7°

(b) In response to the Claimants’ assertion that the release granted by the 1995

Settlement Agreement has significant economic value, the Respondent submits that

 

Part III — Page 18

the purpose of the release was not to carry out any investment activity, nor to
dispose of any investment, but only to release TexPet from claims made by the
Respondent or PetroEcuador arising from environmental pollution. Similarly, in
response to the Claimants’ reliance on the amount of about US$ 38 million
expended on remediation projects, the Respondent submits that the Claimants were
only remedying their own tortious wrongs; and, accordingly, these were

: 2
compensatory payments and not an investment;”°

(c) In relation to the Municipal and Provincial Releases, the Respondent’s primary
response is that neither the Respondent nor PetroEcuador were parties to these
agreements. In any event, the Respondent asserts that the payments made by the
Claimants thereunder have none of the essential characteristics of any investment;””

and

(d) As to the 1998 Final Release, the Respondent submits that it was merely an
acknowledgement by the Respondent that TexPet had fully performed its
obligations under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. It did not have the essential
characteristics of any investment. Although equipment was transferred by TexPet
under the 1998 Final Release, it was made free of charge; and such transfer is in any

event unrelated to the Claimants’ claims.”*

3.69 The Respondent further submits that, even if the settlement agreements were
technically capable of constituting an “investment” under the BIT, Chevron has no
interest in any of those agreements because it was neither a party to nor a beneficiary

under any such agreements.

3.70 The Respondent criticises, in particular, the Claimants’ reliance on paragraph 5.1 of
the 1995 Settlement Agreement, which defines the “Releasees” covered by that
agreement as: “Texpet, Texaco Petroleum Company, Compania Texaco de Petroleos
del Ecuador. S.A., Texaco Inc., and all their respective agents, servants, employees,
officers, directors, legal representatives, insurers, attorneys, indemnitors, guarantors,

heirs, administrators, executors, beneficiaries, successors, predecessors, principals and

 

Part III — Page 19

3.71

3.72

3.73

3.74

subsidiaries.” The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ characterisation of
Chevron as TexPet’s “principal” is misplaced because it is based on Chevron’s
indirect shareholding in TexPet, rather than on any relationship of principal and agent

between Chevron and TexPet, as here required.”

Moreover, the Respondent notes that, elsewhere in other litigation, Chevron has
consistently denied any agency relationship with TexPet.* The Respondent further
contends that, even if there were an agency relationship between Chevron and TexPet
following the 2001 merger, there could have been no agency relationship in relation to
TexPet’s operations which caused environmental damage, since those operations

ended in 1992, some nine years before the merger between Texaco and Chevron.*!

(ii) Article VI(1)(a): The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ characterisation of the
1995 Settlement Agreement as an “investment agreement”. The Respondent
acknowledges that the BIT does not contain any definition of “investment agreement”.
However, the Respondent relies on the definition in the 2004 US Model BIT. In the
light of this definition, the Respondent asserts that, as a matter of common sense, an
agreement to release TexPet from claims concerning the environmental impact of its
former operations cannot be an agreement upon which the “investor relies in
establishing or acquiring a covered investment.”

The Respondent contends that the 1995 Settlement Agreement did not establish anny
investment: it was a closing agreement dealing with alleged torts and environmental
pollution claims against TexPet.** Further, the Respondent submits that it was entered

into three years after the ending of TexPet’s participation in the Consortium.**

In any event, so the Respondent submits, Chevron is unable to invoke the 1995
Settlement Agreement, for the purposes of Article VI(1)(a), because it is neither a
party to or named as a beneficiary in the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Chevron’s

dispute with the Respondent cannot therefore relate to an “investment agreement”

3.77

between them.** The Respondent relies on the awards in Burlington, Duke Energy and
EnCana in support of its contention that Article VI(1)(a) requires an investment

agreement between the claimant Investor and the respondent State.*°

(iii) Prima Facie Case: The Respondent next contends that neither of the Claimants
can establish any case on the merits of their claims, still less any case satisfying the
prima facie standard applicable to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections. In
relation to Chevron, the Respondent again submits that Chevron is not a party to the
settlement agreements. In relation to TexPet, the Respondent asserts that the dispute
before the Tribunal does not implicate TexPet in any way because TexPet is not a
defendant in the Lago Agrio litigation; and therefore that Texpet cannot be prejudiced
by any of the alleged acts or omissions of the Respondent in regard to that litigation.*”
The Respondent further denies that TexPet can assert any claim on Chevron’s

behalf.**

Moreover, so the Respondent submits, the settlement agreements do not contain the
rights that the Claimants allege in their claims. In particular, none of those agreements
imposes on the Respondent any obligation to intervene in private litigation by other
third parties.” The Respondent further submits that any waiver of third party rights by
the Respondent would be contrary to Ecuadorian law so that, even if the named parties
had intended the 1995 Settlement Agreement to include such a waiver, it would have

been a legal nullity.”

In relation to the prima facie standard to be applied by the Tribunal, the Respondent
submits that: (i) the Claimants must satisfy the Tribunal that jurisdiction is established
for each provision of the BIT on which they rely;"! (ii) the Claimants’ characterisation

of their claims is not definitive: the Tribunal must analyse objectively the basis for its

 

* Thid., at para. 133
+" Tbid., at para. 116

Part III — Page 21

3.78

3.79

3.80

3.81

jurisdiction; and (iii) the prima facie standard does not require the Tribunal to accept

as true the facts alleged by the Claimants in the Notice of Arbitration.

The Respondent notes the elaboration of the prima facie standard in Joy Mining v
Egypt and Continental Casualty in support of its contention that this Tribunal should
not necessarily accept the Claimants’ pleaded facts as true, but, rather, that the
Tribunal should decide whether the Respondent has shown that the Claimants’ claims
have no factual basis, even on a preliminary scrutiny.* In the light of these legal
materials, the Respondent submits that, since it disputes the existence of the
contractual rights on which the Claimants rely, the Tribunal must first determine “in a
definitive manner the exact composition or extent of the investment and investment
agreement asserted by the Claimants”.**

(iv) The Fork in the Road: The Respondent submits that the Claimants are precluded,
by the fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT, from pursuing their
claims in this arbitration because that the Claimants have elected to pursue claims

under the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998 Release in an alternative forum.

The Respondent contends that, in determining whether a claimant has triggered a fork
in the road provision, a tribunal must consider whether the claims asserted in the two
actions have the same “fundamental basis”.*° The Respondent submits that, in a
situation where a claim in a local court is contract-based and a claim in an arbitration
is treaty-based, a tribunal should only exercise jurisdiction where the “fundamental
basis” of the contract and treaty claims are different. With this approach, the
Respondent asserts that if the treaty claim is based on a contractual violation, that may

trigger a fork in the road provision.*”

Applied to the present case, the Respondent contends that, in order to procure the
dismissal of the Aguinda litigation in the US Courts, Texaco (with TexPet and

Chevron) expressly committed itself to submit to the jurisdiction of the Ecuadorian

* Tbid., at para. 117

 

*6 Thid., at para. 141
*7 Tbid., at para. 144

Part III — Page 22

3.82

3.83

3.84

 

Courts in relation to claims arising out of the same events and occurrences alleged in
the Aguinda litigation and only to challenge any judgment of the Ecuadorian Courts at
the enforcement stage.“ According to the Respondent, the Lago Agrio litigation, as
brought in the Ecuadorian Courts, is a continuation of the Aguinda litigation.” The
Respondent submits that Chevron relies in the Lago Agrio litigation on the same
alleged releases under the settlement agreements as Texaco had asserted in the
Aguinda litigation; and the Ecuadorian courts have therefore been requested by

Chevron to determine the scope of these settlement agreements.”

The Respondent next submits that the Claimants’ claims under the BIT in this
arbitration, although pleaded in the form of treaty-based claims, are ultimately based
on contractual rights which the Claimants purport to have acquired under the
settlement agreements; and, therefore, that the Claimants’ treaty claims have the same
“fundamental basis” as those at issue in the Lago Agrio litigation.*! The Respondent
accordingly submits that, having elected to submit to the jurisdiction of the
Ecuadorian courts and not to challenge any judgments until the enforcement stage, the
Claimants are prevented by the fork in the road provision in the BIT from bringing

what is, in effect, a “‘pre-judgment collateral attack” on the Lago Agrio litigation.

(v) Third Party Rights: The Respondent asserts that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
adjudicate the Claimants’ claims because it would be required to determine the rights
of non-parties, contrary to the legal principles established by the International Court of

Justice in Monetary Gold.**

The Respondent contends that: the ‘Claimants’ central claim is predicated upon their
contention that Chevron is not liable for any of the environmental impact at issue in
the Lago Agrio litigation ...”* and on this basis, it is asserted that the rights of the
Lago Agrio plaintiffs are squarely placed at issue in the Claimants’ claims before this

Tribunal. The Respondent contends therefore that it would be impossible for this

Tribunal to decide the Claimants’ rights without also deciding the rights of third
parties, ie. the rights of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs who are not parties to nor

represented in these arbitration proceedings.*

3.85 The Respondent relies on the awards in Larsen v Hawaiian Kingdom and Costa Rica v
Nicaragua in support of its contention that the Monetary Gold principle is not
confined to legal proceedings before the International Court of Justice or arbitrations

between States.*°

3.86 Jurisdictional Relief Sought by the Respondent: In the light of its several objections,
the Respondent requests the Tribunal to grant the formal jurisdictional relief pleaded

as follows:

(i) “Find and declare that jurisdiction is lacking over all claims raised by
Claimants and dismiss all claims, in accordance with the Republic’s Objections

to Jurisdiction above”;

(ii) “Order, pursuant to Article 40 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, Claimants
to pay all costs and expenses of this arbitration proceeding, including the fees
and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs of the Republic’s legal

representation, plus pre-award and post-award interest thereon” ; and

(iii) “Grant any other or additional relief as may be appropriate under the

circumstances or as may otherwise be just and proper.” 7

(D) The Claimants’ Response

On 6 September 2010, the Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on

Jurisdiction.

Preliminary Statement: In their Counter-Memorial, the Claimants at the outset
describe the “Crude” film outtakes, as providing: “overwhelming evidence ... as to the
fraudulent nature of the Lago Agrio litigation.”** The Claimants contend that these
outtakes demonstrate that the Respondent is actively colluding with the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs in that litigation and also in the related criminal proceedings brought against
Chevron’s two lawyers (Messrs Veiga and Pérez) in order to undermine Chevron’s
rights under the settlement agreements. The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s

jurisdictional objections must be seen by the Tribunal in that particular context.”

The Claimants also highlight the “opportunistic” nature of the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections. In particular, it is asserted that the Respondent is seeking to
have it “both ways”: by insisting here that Chevron is a stranger to TexPet’s
investments for the purpose of these arbitration proceedings, whilst in the Lago Agrio
litigation, by ensuring there that Chevron is legally liable for TexPet’s alleged

operations in Ecuador.”

The Claimants further characterise the Respondent’s arguments as being entirely
based on “the alleged lack of a legal connection between this dispute and the
Claimants’ investment”.“' The Claimants reject these arguments, asserting that the
remediation, infrastructure and socioeconomic activities, together with their rights and
obligations under the settlement agreements are “inextricably intertwined with

TexPet’s underlying oil exploration and production activities.
contend that this dispute concerns “rights and obligations that are applicable to an

investor as a consequence of an investment agreement entered into with that host

state”, a category of claims which (so the Claimants submit) the tribunal in Amco v

Indonesia held would fall within Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Response to Jurisdictional Objections: The Claimants approach the issues raised by
the Respondent in a different order, commencing with their submissions on the
general standard to be applied by this Tribunal to the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections. The Claimants next contend that the Respondent’s objections must fail on
the basis that the findings in the award in the Commercial Cases Dispute are res
judicata, or at least highly persuasive, for this Tribunal. The Claimants then submit
that both TexPet and Chevron have standing to enforce the settlement agreements,
before addressing seriatim the Respondent’s objections based on ratione materiae, the

BIT’s fork in the road provision and third party rights.

(i) The Prima Facie Standard: The Claimants assert that it is a well-established
principle of international law, applicable to investment arbitrations, that the scope of
inquiry at the jurisdictional stage is limited to the question whether the claimant’s
allegations, if true, could constitute a violation of the treaty or other agreement at

issue.

The Claimants notes paragraphs 32 and 33 of the Separate Opinion of Judge Higgins
in Oil Platforms and contend that this elaboration of the prima facie standard has been
adopted in a large number of investment dispute arbitration awards, including Noble
Energy v Ecuador and Impregilo v Pakistan. The Claimants emphasise that the
tribunal in Impregilo, after conducting an extensive review of the jurisprudence,
concluded that the prima facie approach balances “the dual concerns of ensuring that

the merits are not prejudiced and preventing abusive claims from proceeding 2706

Having set out the prima facie standard to be applied by the Tribunal, the Claimants
next submit that their claims satisfy that standard. The Claimants highlight, in

particular, the fact that this Tribunal has already issued provisional measures (i.e. its

 

at para. 27

Part III — Page 26

3.95

3.96

3.97

order of 14 May 2010) and emphasise that: “the establishment of a prima facie case on

the merits is a prerequisite for the issuance of provisional measures.”°”

In response to the Respondent’s objection that TexPet cannot make out a prima facie
case because it is not a party to the Lago Agrio litigation, the Claimants assert that this
factor is not necessary for the existence of a dispute between TexPet and the
Respondent under the BIT. The Claimants also submit that it would have made no
sense for TexPet to expend US$ 40 million under the 1995 Settlement Agreement if it
was not entitled to protect both itself and its affiliated companies from similar
claims.® It is also contended that the Respondent has damaged TexPet’s own treaty
and contract rights by the Respondent’s failure to honour its obligations under the
settlement agreements. The Claimants argue that the Respondent should not be
entitled to circumvent TexPet’s rights by having Chevron (and not also TexPet)

named as a defendant in the Lago Agrio litigation.”

In relation to the Respondent’s arguments that the contractual rights asserted by the
Claimants do not exist under the settlement agreements and would, in any case, be
impermissible under Ecuadorian law, the Claimants contend that these arguments go
to the merits of the Parties’ dispute and cannot properly be decided at this
jurisdictional phase. However, the Claimants also note, when the Respondent entered
into these settlement agreements, that it specifically represented the people of Ecuador
in relation to the same legal rights which the Lago Agrio plaintiffs later asserted in the

Lago Agrio litigation.”

(ii) Res Judicata/Issue Preclusion: The Claimants submit that the Respondents’
objections to jurisdiction have already been decided between these same parties,
involving the same BIT and under the same arbitration agreement incorporating the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, in the interim award issued in the Commercial Cases
Dispute; and that such decisions are accordingly res judicata before this Tribunal.”' In
particular, that tribunal in its interim award determined that litigation concerning the

liquidation and settlement of claims relating to an investment constitute part of that

investment; and that the investment in Ecuador continued to exist after the expiry of

the 1973 Concession Agreement in 1992.”

The Claimants contend that the question of res judicata should be governed by
international law on the basis (inter alia) that the effect of a tribunal’s decision made
in an investment treaty-based arbitration should not depend upon the domestic law of
that arbitration’s seat. It is further emphasised that Article VI(6) of the BIT provides
that any arbitral award shall be final and binding on the Parties.”* The Claimants rely
on the approach of tribunals in Waste Management Inc v Mexico and Amco v
Indonesia in support of the contention that international tribunals have adopted a
broad approach to res judicata, and that on the basis of that broad approach, the
decisions of the tribunal in the Commercial Cases Dispute constitute res judicata in

this arbitration.”

The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s submission that the res judicata effect of the
Commercial Cases Dispute should be governed by Dutch law (as the law of the
seat);”> and they also contend that, in any event and contrary to the Respondent’s
submission, that tribunal’s decision in an interim award would still be res judicata as a
matter of Dutch law as the law of the seat of that arbitration. The Claimants note that
the tribunal’s partial award on the merits incorporates all the jurisdictional
determinations from their interim award on jurisdiction; that the Respondent has
brought legal proceedings to set aside the interim award; and that, under Dutch law,
such an application may not be brought until an award has acquired the force of res

judicata under Dutch law. 7

(iii) Privity and Non-Parties: The Claimants reject the Respondents’ argument that
their claims cannot constitute an investment dispute under Article VI of the BIT
because TexPet is not a party to the Lago Agrio litigation and Chevron is not a party to

the settlement agreements. In submitting that both Claimants have standing to enforce

., para. 49

   

these settlement agreements and assert claims under the BIT, the Claimants make the

following four principal points.

First, Chevron has independent standing to enforce the 1995 Settlement Agreement
because it falls within the categories of parties described as “‘Releasees” in Article 5.1
of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Claimants assert, in particular, that the word
“principales” in the Spanish text of Article 5.1 should be construed as “parent
corporation” and include Chevron as TexPet’s parent. The Claimants contend that this
interpretation is supported by the fact that, in the Spanish text, the word “principales”
is expressly linked with the word “subsidiarias”.’’ More generally, the Claimants
assert that the lengthy list of Releasees in Article 5.1 indicates that the parties intended
to release any and all parties who could potentially be sued under any theory of law.”*
The Claimants further contend that the parties intended third party releasees to be able
to enforce the releases. The Claimants reject the Respondent’s reliance on Article 9.5
of the 1995 Settlement Agreement (said to preclude all third party beneficiaries) on
the basis that it would render the express release language meaningless and

unenforceable.”

Second, Chevron has standing as TexPet’s shareholder, under the BIT, to enforce
claims on behalf of TexPet. The Claimants contend that the express language of
Article 1(1)(a) of the BIT makes clear that an indirect owner of an investment is
protected under the BIT. The Claimants cite in support Professor Vandevelde’s
explanation that Article 1(1) of the 2004 US Model BIT was intended to protect
investors against the effect of Barcelona Traction.® It is further contended that
arbitration tribunals, including AAPL v Sri Lanka, AMT v Zaire, Genin v Estonia and
CMS v Argentina have consistently adopted the same approach.*! The Claimants also
cite the decision of the tribunal in the Commercial Cases Dispute that it had

jurisdiction over TexPet and Chevron’s claims against the Respondent.*”

® Tbid., para. 74

Part III — Page 29

3.103

3.104

3.105

   
 

Third, TexPet has standing to enforce its rights under the settlement agreements. The
Claimants rely on the provisions of the Ecuadorian Civil Code in support of their
argument that TexPet is entitled to enforce its contractual rights even if the alleged
breach affects non-parties to those agreements.** The Claimants emphasise that
TexPet provided substantial consideration in return for the release of both TexPet and
its affiliates from liability. To the extent that the Respondent disputes the Claimants’
interpretation of the scope of the release, the Claimants assert that such dispute is a
matter on which TexPet has the right to seek a binding interpretation from this

Tribunal as a matter relating to the merits of the Parties’ dispute.**

Fourth, the Respondent’s position violates legal principles of good faith, including
estoppel and preclusion. The Claimants contend that the Respondent is “blowing hot
and cold” in that it has affirmed jurisdiction over Chevron based on TexPet’s alleged
conduct in the Lago Agrio litigation; but that the Respondent simultaneously seeks to
deny that this Tribunal has any jurisdiction over Chevron on the basis that it is a
stranger to TexPet’s investment and investment agreement. The Claimants further
submit that the Lago Agrio Court has asserted de facto jurisdiction over Chevron for
more than seven years; and that this constitutes a clear statement by the Respondent
that Chevron is responsible for conduct arising out of the investment.*° Citing SPP v
Egypt, the Claimants also assert that the Respondent’s conduct in asserting jurisdiction
over Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation has forced Chevron to incur significant
litigation expenses and to commence the present arbitration as a claimant in order to
prevent the Respondent from taking a contrary course of action.*’ The Claimants also
rely on the international law doctrine of preclusion, which (so it asserts) is broader

than the doctrine of estoppel and, in particular, does not require detrimental reliance.**

(iv) Article VI(1)(c): In contending that there is an alleged breach of the BIT “with
respect to an investment” for the purposes of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, the

Claimants advance two principal submissions.

3.108

First, the Claimants advance a “holistic” approach to the identification of an
“investment”, contending that the concession agreements, TexPet’s underlying
exploration and production activities and the settlement agreements are all
inextricably entwined as an investment.®? The Claimants emphasise the scale of the
original investment and the economic benefits conferred on the Respondent.” The
Claimants contend that this holistic approach was envisaged by the settlement
agreements, all of which expressly recognise that TexPet’s remediation, infrastructure
and socio-economic activities arose directly out of its underlying oil exploration and

production activities.”!

The Claimants further assert that this “holistic” approach is supported by arbitral
jurisprudence. Particular reliance is placed on the tribunal’s decision in Mondev, that
“once an investment exists, it remains protected by NAFTA even after the enterprise
in question may have failed ... Issues of orderly liquidation and the settlement of
claims may still arise and require [international legal protection] > The Claimants
assert that this reasoning was adopted in the Commercial Cases Dispute, in which the
tribunal determined that the Claimants’ lawsuits constituted part of their investment.”
The Claimants further highlight a number of other arbitral awards in support of the
“holistic” or “unity of the investment” approach, from Holiday Inns v Morocco to
Inmaris v Ukraine.” In the light of these legal materials, the Claimants conclude that
the remediation activities, with the rights and obligations under the settlement
agreements, are “component parts of a larger, integrated investment undertaking”®>;
and that, when viewed as an overall “adventure”, they clearly qualify as an investment

for the purpose of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.”°

Second, in the alternative, the Claimants contend that, even if the settlement
agreements are viewed independently of TexPet’s original investment, these

agreements qualify as a “stand alone” investment. The Claimants emphasise that the

 

°° Thid., at para. 135

Part III — Page 31

3.109

3.110

definition of “investment” in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT is expansive, covering “every
kind of investment”.°” The Claimants submit that arbitral jurisprudence, including
Tradex v Albania, Fedax v Venezuela and SGS v Philippines, supports their contention

that definitions of ‘investment’ in BITs should be construed broadly.”*

Adopting this broad approach, the Claimants contend that their investments in
Ecuador fall within at least three of the separate examples of “investments” listed in
Article I(1) of the BIT, namely: (i) “investment contracts” under Article I(1)(a); (ii) “a
claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value” under Article

I(1)(a)(iii); and (iii) “any right conferred by law or contract” under Article 1(1)(ay(v).”?

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that the settlement agreements do not
bear any of the intrinsic economic characteristics of an investment, contending that the
effect of that argument is to impose jurisdictional requirements which do not appear in
the BIT.’ In relation to the legal materials invoked by the Respondent, the Claimants
contend that the tribunal in Salini decided that the contract there at issue constituted an
investment for the purposes of that BIT; but that the four independent criteria were
elaborated in the context of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention which (so that
tribunal decided) required it to go beyond the consent of the parties under the BIT
itself.'°' The Claimants emphasise that the Salini test has been the subject of extended
criticism, notably in Biwater v Tanzania. /2 The Claimants note that the second award
invoked by the Respondent, Pantechniki, was again an ICSID decision; the Claimants
assert that the definition of “investment” for the purposes of that BIT was not there at
issue; and the tribunal expressed caution against applying additional jurisdictional

requirements not found in the BIT’s text.'%

Finally, in relation to Romak v
Uzbekistan, the Claimants acknowledge that the tribunal there appeared to import a
Salini-like test, but they contend that this was made in the context of a one-off

commercial contract; and it thus should be distinguished from the present case. to4

 

Part III — Page 32

3.111

3.112

3.113

3.114

3.115

The Claimants further note that the 2004 US Model BIT (which the Respondent also
invokes in support of its argument) is not phrased in terms of “expectation of a
commercial profit”, but rather an “expectation of gain or profit”. The Claimants
submit that the word “gain” is deliberately broader, and may include non-monetary

benefits, such as a release from alleged liability under the settlement agreements. 105

In any event, so the Claimants submit, even if the narrow test advanced by the
Respondent were correct, the settlement agreements are capable of constituting a
“stand-alone” investment. In particular, the Claimants assert that a substantial
financial contribution was made under the terms of those agreements; there was an
element of risk (in that the remediation works could have cost far more than
anticipated); the remediation works were conducted over a period of four years; and

there was an expectation of gain in the form of the benefits from the release. 106

(v) Article VI(1)(a): The Claimants assert that they are entitled to bring claims before
this Tribunal in respect of alleged breaches of the settlement agreements in accordance
with Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, in addition to their claims for breach of the
substantive provisions of the BIT with respect to an investment under Article VI(1)(c)

of the BIT.'°”

The Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over these claims on two
separate and independent grounds: (i) the Parties’ dispute “relates to” the concession
agreements, which are and have already been held elsewhere to be “investment
agreements” under Article VI(1)(a); and (ii) the settlement agreements themselves
constitute “investment agreements” under Article VI(1)(a) on the basis that they are

agreements concerning the Claimants’ continuing investment in Ecuador. '°*

As to the first ground, the Claimants stress that Article I(1)(a) expressly refers to
disputes “arising out of or relating to” an investment agreement. It is submitted that
the use of the disjunctive word “or” indicates that “arising out of” and “relating to”

have different meanings. In the Claimants’ submission, the phrase “arising out of”

indicates that the investment agreement itself provides the basis of the cause of action,
whereas the phrase “relating to” requires only that the dispute has a reasonable or

legally significant connection with the investment agreement. '°

The Claimants here rely on the Commercial Cases Dispute, wher the tribunal held that
the wording of Article I(1)(a) of the BIT was broad enough to cover a denial of justice
claim which ‘related to’ the original concession agreements.'!° The Claimants also
highlight the approach of the English Court of Appeal in Occidental Exploration v
Ecuador 2007 and of the NAFTA tribunal in Methanex v United States, both of which
(so the Claimants contend) support a broad interpretation of the phrase “relating

tort

In the present case, the Claimants submit that the Parties’ dispute is legally and
factually intertwined with the original concession agreements. It is argued that “but
for” those concession agreements, TexPet would not have conducted oil operations in
Ecuador and (allegedly) caused the environmental damage which is the foundation of
the Lago Agrio litigation. |! The Claimants further assert that the factual materials in
this case go beyond a mere “but for” relationship with the original concession
agreements. It is noted by the Claimants, in particular, that the 1995 Settlement
Agreement expressly provides for the release of TexPet’s contractual obligations
under those concession agreements;''? and that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs specifically

allege that TexPet violated its obligations under the 1973 Concession Agreement.''4

As to the second ground, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s contention that the
phrase “investment agreement” requires an agreement under which the Claimants
established or acquired their investment in Ecuador. On the contrary, it is asserted that
the text, object and purpose of the BIT make clear that “investment agreement” should
be interpreted broadly. The Claimants highlight, in particular, a distinction in the
BIT’s Spanish text between the phrase “agreement of investment” and the broader

phrase “agreement concerning an investment” which is used in Article I(1)(a) of the

at para. 192

BIT.''’ The Claimants assert that, on its plain meaning, the phrase “investment
agreement” encompasses any agreement concerning an investment; and that it is not
limited to an agreement which relates to the establishment, management, operation,

maintenance or disposal of an investment.!'®

In the Claimants’ submission, this broad interpretation of “investment agreement” is
supported by the drafting history of US BITs. The Claimants recount that, whilst the
US-Ecuador BIT was based on the 1992 US Model BIT, none of the pre-1994 US
Model BITs contained a definition of “investment agreement”. The Claimants cite
Professor Vandevelde’s commentary on the 1983 US Model BIT to the effect that the
intention behind this phrase was to exclude ordinary commercial contracts. !'” The
Claimants also cite the US-Russia BIT (concluded shortly before the US-Ecuador
BIT), which does contain a definition of “investment agreement” expressly covering
agreements “concerning an investment”.''* Conversely, the Claimants reject the
Respondent’s reliance on the 2004 US Model BIT because it post-dates the BIT here
at issue and because its new definition of “investment agreement” (according to
Professor Vandevelde’s commentary) was not intended to be simply a clarification of

existing US Model BITs, but represented a revision.'!°

The Claimants distinguish other legal materials, PSEG Global Inc v Turkey and El
Paso v Argentina, which are invoked by the Respondent in support of its narrow
interpretation of the phrase “investment agreement’. The Claimants assert that its
meaning was not actually at issue in these cases.'”° On the contrary, so the Claimants
submit, other legal materials (including Noble Ventures and Occidental v Ecuador
2005) indicate that the term “investment agreement” is used to refer generally to

agreements between a foreign investor and a host State. |?!

Accordingly, the Claimants submit that the settlement agreements qualify as

“investment agreements” under this broader interpretation of Article VI(1)(a) of the

. 205

BIT. In any event, so the Claimants contend, even on the Respondent’s narrow
interpretation, these agreements still qualify as investment agreements because the
remediation work undertaken by TexPet under those agreements constitutes an
“investment” for the purposes of Article I(1) of the BIT; and accordingly the

oe s 122
settlement agreements must be “investment agreements

The Claimants next address the Respondent’s argument that, even if the Tribunal were
to have jurisdiction over TexPet, it cannot have jurisdiction over Chevron because
Chevron was not a party to the settlement agreements. In response, the Claimants rely
on two separate submissions; namely: (i) arbitral jurisprudence and general principles
of international law confirm that Chevron can invoke the jurisdiction of this Tribunal
under the BIT on the basis that it is a covered party or a third party beneficiary of the
settlement agreements; and (ii) the Respondent is estopped or otherwise precluded
from objecting to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because Chevron would not have brought
this arbitration were it not for the Lago Agrio Court’s wrongful assumption of

jurisdiction over Chevron.

As to the first submission, the Claimants contend that in both Burlington v Ecuador
and Duke Energy v Ecuador (invoked by the Respondent), the tribunals accepted that
the requirement that an “investment agreement” should be “between” the claimant and
respondent State is satisfied where the agreement confers enforceable rights on the
claimant, whether or not they are a signatory to such agreement. In neither case did the
parent company have any enforceable rights under the agreement between its
subsidiary and the respondent State.!> Further, the Claimants submit that, in both
common law and civil law jurisdictions, courts and tribunals have decided that a third
party beneficiary may invoke an arbitration clause in a contract to which it was not a

: 124
signatory.

The Claimants further contend that the object and purpose of Article VI(1)(a) of the
BIT is to promote efficiency in the resolution of investment disputes by allowing

investors to bring contractual claims in the same arbitral forum as their treaty claims.

 

4 Thid., at para. 232

Part III — Page 36

3.125

3.126

3.127

 

It is submitted that a third party beneficiary’s rights under an investment agreement
would qualify as an “investment” and that a tribunal would therefore have jurisdiction
over that third party’s treaty based claims pursuant to Article I(1)(c) of the BIT. The
Claimants therefore submit that, consistent with the object and purpose of Article
VI(1)(a), this tribunal should have jurisdiction over a third party’s contractual

. 5
claims.'”°

The Claimants conclude that Chevron is clearly a third party beneficiary under the
settlement agreements, '”°and that it therefore possesses its own enforceable rights and
can invoke the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to enforce those rights in these arbitration

proceedings under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT.!?”

(vi) Third Party Rights: The Claimants distinguish the Monetary Gold case (invoked
by the Respondent). In that case, in order to adjudicate upon the dispute between the
United Kingdom and Italy, the International Court of Justice would have been
required to determine whether an absent third State (Albania) had committed an
internationally wrongful act that would have entitled Italy to claim the gold at issue. In
the Claimants’ submission, this arbitration is materially different: it concerns only a

dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent. '8

The Claimants further seek to confine the scope of the Monetary Gold principle to
third party States,'? asserting that the principle has never been applied in the context

of non-State actors or investor-state arbitrations. '*°

Moreover, the Claimants submit
that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs do not have separate rights which might be affected by
this arbitration, but rather that the rights which those plaintiffs seek to assert against
Chevron are the same rights which (so the Claimants allege) the Respondent agreed to

release in the settlement agreements. BI

In any event, so the Claimants submit, to the extent that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs have
any interest in this arbitration, that interest can be adequately represented by the

Respondent.

(vi) Fork in the Road: The Claimants submits that the Respondent’s argument based
on the BIT’s fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT is wrong because
the Claimants have not submitted their claims in this dispute with the Respondent to

any other forum.

The Claimants contend that the plain language of Articles VI(2) & VI(3) of the BIT
indicates that the fork in the road provision applies only to investment disputes and,
moreover, only to those investment disputes submitted by the national or company
concerned.' In disputing the Respondent’s objection, the Claimants make the

following specific points.

The “investment dispute” before this Tribunal has not been submitted to another
forum. The Lago Agrio litigation, as the Respondent itself recognises, is not an
investment dispute but an environmental damage claim.'* The fact that another
dispute submitted to a domestic court can relate to an investment or an investment
agreement is not sufficient to convert it into an “investment dispute” for the purposes
of a fork in the road provision.'™ The Claimants cite Olguin v Paraguay and Genin v
Estonia in support of their contention that a fork in the road provision will not be
triggered by domestic legal proceedings which are related (but not identical) to the

dispute before the arbitration tribunal. 135

The dispute before this Tribunal has not been submitted by the Claimants to another
forum. Defensive conduct by a party taken in domestic legal proceedings does not
trigger a fork in the road provision. The Claimants, citing Enron v Argentina and CMS
v Argentina, contend that a fork in the road provision contemplates situations where a
claimant has a choice whether to submit a dispute to arbitration or another forum.

Where the investor is defending proceedings brought in a domestic court, it does not

. 245,
- 248
. 249
is. 250-253

Part III — Page 38

3.133

3.134

 

have a choice and therefore a fork in the road provision is inapplicable.'*° The
Claimants accordingly submit that in taking defensive steps in the Aguinda litigation,
Chevron was not exercising a choice but was “pulled into” the dispute by the Aguinda
plaintiffs. '°” In any event, the Claimants deny that the Lago Agrio litigation is a
continuation of the Aguinda litigation; and the fact that Texaco secured a forum non
conveniens dismissal of the Aguinda litigation cannot amount to a voluntary
submission of the present dispute by Chevron to the Lago Agrio litigation. 138

The Claimants did not make any exclusive forum selection. It is asserted that,
whatever statements were made by Texaco, they cannot bind the Claimants, and were,
in any event, related to an entirely different dispute that that at issue in the Lago Agrio
litigation or the present arbitration.” The Claimants further submit that any
statements made by Texaco were premised on the basis of appropriate treatment by
the Respondent’s Courts in accordance with the rule of law and _ international
standards. '4° Further, even if Texaco had made such an agreement, that is not
sufficient to trigger a fork in the road provision: in Lanco v Argentina, the tribunal
held that only the actual filing of a claim is sufficient to constitute a choice for the

purpose of applying a fork in the road provision.

In response to the Respondent’s reliance on a “fundamental basis” test, the Claimants’
primary response is that this is legally irrelevant because the Respondent has failed to
establish the basic requirements of the BIT’s fork in the road provision. '*! The
Claimants also dispute the Respondent’s characterisation of that test, in particular its
reliance on the Pantechniki decision. The Claimants assert that Pantechniki departs
from a long line of decisions which holds that treaty claims are fundamentally
different from contract claims. !*7 Moreover, in Pantechniki, the dispute submitted to
the domestic court was undoubtedly an investment dispute.'*? The Claimants also
reject the Respondent’s argument that this Tribunal will have to carry out an identical

analysis to that required in the Lago Agrio litigation. The Claimants highlight, in

. 266

3.136

particular, that the Parties’ dispute in this arbitration includes allegations of breaches
under the substantive provisions of the BIT, which are not at issue in the Lago Agrio

litigation. M4

Finally, the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s attempt to portray the Claimants’
claims as being essentially contractual claims dressed up as treaty claims should be
rejected by the Tribunal. In the Claimants’ submission, the Respondent’s approach
would effectively require, wrongly, the Tribunal to determine at this jurisdictional
stage the merits of the Claimants’ claims for breach of the substantive provisions of

the BIT.'*°

Jurisdictional Relief Sought by the Claimants: In the light of its submissions, the

Claimants requests the following formal jurisdictional relief from the Tribunal:

(i) “A declaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction and competence of this

Tribunal” ;

(ii) “An order dismissing all of Respondent’s objections to the jurisdiction and

competence of the Tribunal”; and

(iii) | “An order that Respondent pay the costs of this proceedings, including the
Tribunal’s fees and expenses, and the costs of Claimants’ representation, along

with interest”.!

(E) The Respondent’s Reply

On 6 October 2010, the Respondent submitted its Reply Memorial on Jurisdictional

Objections.

Introduction: In its introductory remarks, the Respondent describes the Claimants’
claims as an attempt to “transform what is fundamentally a private environmental
dispute into an ‘investment dispute’ against a sovereign”. "7 The Respondent suggests
that the Claimants have attempted to divert attention from the demerits of their case
“by cobbling together a list of inflammatory allegations ...”, principally by reference
the outtakes from the film “Crude”. '** The Respondent submits that these allegations
could be addressed in detail at the merits stage; but, for the purposes of its
jurisdictional objections, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ allegations

' and that those

relate not to the Respondent but, rather, to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs;
allegations (even if true) have no relevance to this arbitration.’ The Respondent
further denies that the “Crude” film outtakes provide any evidence of collusion or

conspiracy between the Respondent and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs.'*!

Reply to the Claimants’ Response: The Respondent then addresses, first, the standard
of review which should be applied by this Tribunal to the Claimants’ claims at this
jurisdictional stage, before next developing its submissions on jurisdiction ratione
materiae under Article VI(1(c) and Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. The Respondent then
responds to the Claimants’ arguments on the res judicata effect of the Commercial
Cases Dispute, the scope of the Monetary Gold principle in relation to third party
rights and the BIT’s fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT.

(i) The Standard of Review: The Respondent reiterates its submission that the prima
facie test does not require the Tribunal to accept as true all the facts alleged by the

152

Claimants in their Notice of Arbitration.°~ In particular, so the Respondent asserts,

tribunals frequently allow the respondent to adduce evidence to show that the

. > - «153
claimant’s case has no factual basis.'*

The Respondent cites the Micula decision as
demonstrating that, where a jurisdictional issue is dependent on a_ factual
determination, the tribunal must make that factual determination to the extent

necessary for jurisdictional purposes. s4

The Respondent denies that any of its jurisdictional objections requires the Tribunal to
make any inappropriate determination as to the merits of the Parties’ dispute. For
instance, the objection that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction over TexPet’s claims
because it is not a party to the Lago Agrio litigation requires a “determination that is

purely jurisdictional”;'°°

and it does not require the Tribunal to address issues as to the
merits, such as whether the Respondent has breached any substantive obligations

owed to TexPet under the BIT.

In relation to the jurisdictional objection based on the lack of any provision in the
1995 Settlement Agreement under which the Respondent undertook to indemnify the
Claimants from third party liability, the Respondent acknowledges that this objection
might require the Tribunal to examine facts which overlap with the merits of the
Claimants’ claims; but the Respondent contends that the objection is so obvious that it
would be a waste of the Parties’ resources to reserve this jurisdictional decision to a

merits phase in these arbitration proceedings.'*°

(ii) Article VI(1)(c): The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ attempts to establish the
existence of an investment dispute relating to an “investment” under Article VI(1)(c)

of the BIT, making the following two submissions.

 

'86 Thid., at para. 27

Part III — Page 42

3.144

3.145

3.146

3.147

First, the Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot rely for their investment upon
any “inextricable link” between the expired concession agreements and the later 1995

Settlement Agreement.

Under the Claimants’ “holistic” approach to the issue of whether there is an
investment and investment dispute, the Respondent submits that a “fundamental
jurisdictional question” for the Tribunal concerns the nature and quality of the link
which is required between the Claimants’ alleged dispute under the settlement
agreements and TexPet’s expired investment under the original concession
agreements.'*” The Respondent asserts that, in order to cross this jurisdictional
threshold, the Claimants must establish that the settlement agreements were “required
to enable, permit, facilitate, or otherwise contribute to TexPet’s ability to engage in oil
exploration or production activities.” The Respondent contends that these activities

had already expired in 1992.1°8

The Respondent also rejects the factual basis for the alleged “inextricable link”. The
Respondent notes that the Claimants highlight the “magnitude” of TexPet’s original
investment. The Respondent denies that this factor has any relevance to the existence
of a link between that investment and the settlement agreements.” In response to the
Claimants’ assertion that the latter’s remediation and socio-economic activities arose
directly out of the original concession, the Respondent submits that not only does this
run counter to the position which the Claimants have consistently taken, but also that

there is nothing in the 1973 Concession Agreement to support this alleged link.

The Respondent refers to section 46 of the 1973 Concession Agreement (upon which
the Claimants rely) which merely required TexPet to refrain from polluting the
concession area’ and therefore did not anticipate any remediation activities.'°! The
Respondent also contends that the settlement agreements arose not from anything in
the concession agreements, but from environmental audits conducted at the request of
the Respondent. The Respondent also notes that TexPet has explicitly acknowledged

that its participation in these audits was not required by any law or contractual

 

‘6! Thid., at para. 54

Part III — Page 43

3.148

3.149

obligation.'” The Respondent characterises the settlement agreements as a
“contingent liability”; and it cites Joy Mining in support of the proposition that a

contingent liability cannot constitute a protected investment under a BIT. 163

The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ characterisation of the settlement
agreements as being “a part of the natural winding up of TexPet’s expired
investment”. The Respondent asserts that the winding up of TexPet’s investment had
been completed before 1995; and that the relevant claims were third party tort claims
which were independent of TexPet’s obligations under the concession agreements.'™
The Respondent further explains that there is nothing in the language of the 1995
Settlement Agreement to support an “inextricable link”, as alleged by the
Claimants.'® The Respondent asserts that the only argument left to the Claimants is a
“but for” link: namely that TexPet originally caused the environmental damage which

was later remediated under the settlement agreements. 166

As to this last argument, the Respondent contends the arbitral jurisprudence cited by
the Claimants does not supports a “but for” approach to establishing the existence of
an investment.'®’ In particular, the Respondent distinguishes the approach in Mondev,
emphasising that the tribunal was there motivated by an equitable concern that an
investor should not lose its right to assert claims under NAFTA in circumstances
where its investment had been expropriated.'® The Respondent submits that the
present case is different, because the rights invoked by the Claimants do not derive
from the expired concession agreements, but from later settlement agreements made in
response to the Claimants’ contingent liability under Ecuadorian environmental law.
The Respondent maintains that Mondev does not support the proposition that an
investor’s potential liability can extend the life of an expired, as opposed to an

expropriated, investment. 169

3.153

3.154

The Respondent also distinguishes the decision in the Commercial Cases Dispute,
principally on the basis that the Claimants’ claims in that arbitration were founded on

the investors’ alleged rights under the original concession agreements.'”°

In short, as to this first submission, the Respondent contends that none of the legal
materials invoked by the Claimants indicates that a “holistic” approach should be
applied to the question whether an “investment” exists under this BIT, but were rather
concerned with other discrete issues.'7!

As to its second submission, the Respondent contends that the settlement agreements

are not stand-alone investments as alleged by the Claimants.

The Respondent specifically rejects the Claimants’ suggestion that it is seeking to
impose novel jurisdictional requirements; and it seeks to explain that it is simply
maintaining that the Claimants have not established that the dispute is with respect to
an “investment” as required by the BIT.'” The Respondent reiterates that the plain,
ordinary, inherent meaning of the word “investment” incorporates economic
characteristics.'” In the Respondent’s view, this is confirmed by the preamble to the
BIT, which emphasises that the BIT is designed to “stimulate the flow of private
capital and ... economic development”.!™ The Respondent contends that it is not
enough for the Claimants simply to point to something that falls within one of the
categories in Article I(1)(a), because these categories only describe the legal form

which an investment can take.'”°

The Respondent accepts that it is primarily by ICSID tribunals that the economic
characteristics of investments have been analysed, by reference to Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention. However, the Respondent submits that in the recent decision in
Saba Fakes, the tribunal considered that the ICSID Convention captures “the ordinary

meaning of the word “investment”.'”° Moreover, in the Respondent’s further

 

"%6 Thid., at para. 110

Part III — Page 45

3.155

3.156

3.157

3.158

 

submission, it would make no sense if the meaning of “investment” differed according
to a claimant’s post hoc choice of arbitral systems between the UNCITRAL

Arbitration Rules and the ICSID Convention.'””

The Respondent reiterates that none of the settlement agreements possesses the
necessary economic characteristics of an “investment”.!> In addressing the
Claimants’ analysis of these agreements, the Respondent highlights the following
factors: (i) the “contribution” made by TexPet in its remediation activities was at most
“net-zero” but was probably “net-negative”; (ii) TexPet’s activities under the
settlement agreements entailed no risk, but on the contrary eliminated any risk to
TexPet with immediate effect; (iii) the vast majority of the remediation work was
undertaken before the BIT came into effect (in 1997); (iv) TexPet never intended its
remediation work to generate a gain in the sense of a return on an investment: the
assertion that TexPet “gained” a release from liability is legally irrelevant; and (v)
TexPet did not contribute to Ecuador’s development through the financing of these
works because at most the effect of these contributions was “net-zero”.!”

The Respondent further notes that the Claimants refer throughout their Counter-
Memorial to the “Settlement and Release Agreements”. The Respondent submits,
however, that the Municipal and Provincial Releases are irrelevant because neither the
Respondent nor PetroEcuador was a party to these settlements; and, consequently, the
Claimants’ claims must depend only upon the 1995 Settlement Agreement. '*°

In any event, the Respondent further submits that Chevron has no interest in any of

these settlement agreements, including the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

The Respondent contends that Chevron is not a contractually covered beneficiary
under the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Respondent emphasises that this

Settlement Agreement does not include any generic reference to “parent companies”,

181

but refers only to TexPet’s parent at the time, namely Texaco”. The Respondent

rejects the Claimants’ reliance on the term “principales” in the Spanish text,

'S! Thid., at para. 119

submitting that this is a defined term in the Ecuadorian Commercial Code where it is
confined to a “principal” under a principal/agent relationship. 182 By contrast,
Ecuadorian corporate law uses the term “‘matriz” to refer to foreign companies with
domestic operations in Ecuador. 183

The Respondent also notes that the language of the Municipal and Provincial Releases
indicates that the Claimants’ lawyers were well able to include a term which clearly
covered parent corporations in the release when the parties actually intended to do so:
those agreements all expressly extend the release to “any other affiliate, subsidiary or
other related companies.. | The Respondent further submits that, even if the
Spanish word “principales” is construed in the manner alleged by the Claimants, it is
nonetheless incapable of extending to TexPet’s future parent corporations, such as

Chevron. '*°

The Respondent also contends that the Claimants mischaracterise the Respondent’s
submission based on Article 9.4 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. The Respondent
agrees with the Claimants that “Article 9.4 cannot be interpreted to mean that
releasees may not invoke and enforce the releases that the Agreement expressly
provides to them.” However, the Respondent’s actual submission is that Chevron is a
third party which is not covered by any release as a Releasee and therefore has no

right to seek enforcement of a right to which it is not entitled as a non-releasee. '*°

The Respondent further contends that Chevron does not have standing to assert claims

on behalf of TexPet in this arbitration.

The Respondent submits that arbitral jurisprudence establishes that shareholders only
have standing to bring direct claims on their own behalf and, moreover, may only seek
relief for the diminution in the value of their stake in the company.'*” In support of its
submission, the Respondent refers to the legal materials invoked by the Claimants,

including Maffezini v Spain, Azurix v Argentina and AMT v Zaire. The Respondent

contends that all these cases concerned claims brought by claimant shareholders on

their own behalf.

The Respondent notes that the Chevron characterises its indirect ownership of TexPet
as an “investment” protected under the BIT. The Respondent contends that this new
formulation of Chevron’s protected investment is impermissible, but that, in any
event, Chevron’s indirect ownership of TexPet cannot constitute an “investment”
within the meaning of the BIT. The Respondent emphasises that TexPet is not

incorporated in Ecuador, as required by the BiT.'*8

Further, the Respondent asserts that Chevron has failed to establish that its indirect
interest in TexPet has diminished as a result of the alleged wrongs committed by the
Respondent. The Respondent reiterates that TexPet is not being sued as a defendant in
the Lago Agrio litigation; and therefore, as a non-party, TexPet cannot be adversely
affected by the eventual outcome of that litigation. '* The Respondent concludes that
Chevron has no investment dispute with the Respondent within the meaning of Article

VI(1)(c) of the BIT.

As to TexPet, the Respondent contends that it has failed to explain the nature of its
alleged dispute with the Respondent. Although TexPet asserts that its rights are
“directly at issue” in the Lago Agrio litigation, the Respondent again emphasises that
TexPet is not involved in any way with that litigation; and it is thus difficult to see
how TexPet’s alleged rights could be directly affected by any of the Respondent’s

alleged acts or omissions. !”°

The Respondent submits that the provisions of the
Ecuadorian Civil Code (as invoked by the Claimants) cannot be used to establish a
dispute between TexPet and the Respondent in circumstances where TexPet is not an

injured party.!°! The Respondent accordingly submits that TexPet also has no

investment dispute with the Respondent within the meaning of Article VI(1)(c) of the
BIT.

(iii) Article VI(1)(a): The Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
ratione materiae pursuant to Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT for want of any relevant
“investment agreement”, reiterating that neither of the Claimants have established
their jurisdictional cases under Article VI(1)(a). Here, the Respondent responds
principally to the Claimants’ three arguments in support of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction

over Chevron’s claims relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

First, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that the Tribunal has
jurisdiction over Chevron under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT on the basis that the
settlement agreements are “related to” the original concession agreements. The
Respondent submits that the Claimants’ lengthy submissions on the meaning of the
phrase “relating to” in Article VI(1)(a) are wrong. The Respondent contends that a
dispute “relating to” an investment agreement can only qualify as an “investment
dispute” if the parties to the dispute are the same parties to the relevant investment
agreement; and that a looser connection between the dispute and the agreement is
irrelevant where, as with Chevron, the parties to the dispute are not the same as the
parties to the relevant investment agreement. '? In any event, so the Respondent
submits, there is no sufficient connection here between the settlement agreements and
the original concession agreements so as to constitute the former as part of “an

investment agreement” under the BIT.

Second, the Respondent disputes the Claimants’ argument that the settlement
agreements are themselves capable of qualifying as stand-alone “investment
agreements”. In rejecting the Claimants’ broad conception of an investment
agreement, the Respondent submits that it is appropriate to have regard to the 2004 US
Model BIT, given that it was produced shortly after this BIT was signed.'° The
Respondent cites Professor Vandevelde’s commentary on the 2004 US Model BIT:
“The new language specifies that an investment agreement is one on the basis of
which an investment is made or the renewal of such an agreement.”!™ The
Respondent submits that the 2004 US Model BIT does not represent a “‘sea-change” in

the definition of investment agreement from that previously adopted in the 1994 US

 

'% Thid., at para. 170

Part III — Page 49

Model BIT; but, rather, that both US Model BITs expressly limit the definition to

agreements concerning the establishment and renewal of an investment. °°

The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ reference, as aids to treaty
interpretation, to the different term employed in Article X(2)(c) and to the object and
purpose of the BIT and its umbrella clause.'°” The Respondent similarly rejects the
Claimants’ reliance on Occidental v Ecuador, the Commercial Cases Dispute and
Noble Ventures v Romania. The Respondent submits that none of these legal materials
support a broad interpretation of the phrase “investment agreement”. On the contrary,
so the Respondent suggests, the tribunal in Burlington v Ecuador emphasised that
“investment agreement” is more restrictive than “investment” and that it represents a

legal rather than an economic threshold. 198

Third, in response to the Claimants’ argument that an investment agreement between a
claimant and a respondent is established when an agreement signed by the respondent
confers a legally enforceable right on the claimant, the Respondent submits that
Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT clearly requires that a claimant is a party to the investment

agreement. 199

In this regard, the Respondent contends that the “general principles of arbitration law”
invoked by the Claimants merely support the uncontroversial proposition that third
party beneficiaries to a contract may invoke an arbitration agreement contained in that
contract. However, it does not necessarily follow that the third party’s dispute will fall
within the scope of the arbitration agreement. Similarly in this case, so the Respondent
contends, Chevron’s alleged dispute with the Respondent falls outside the scope of the

relevant arbitration agreement contained in Article VI of the BIT?

Lastly, the Respondent again reiterates that TexPet cannot establish under Article

VI(1)(a) that it has any dispute with the Respondent arising out of or relating to the

1995 Settlement Agreement because TexPet is not a party to the Lago Agrio

litigation.2""

(iv) Res Judicata/Issue Preclusion: The Respondent submits that the decision in the
Commercial Cases Dispute is irrelevant to the jurisdictional issues before this

Tribunal and is not res judicata.

The Respondent emphasises that the doctrine of res judicata requires a common
identity of parties and of the issues in dispute.” The Respondent submits that the
relevant issues here are: “(i) whether the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the 1998
Final Release constituted investment agreements or investments; and (ii) whether the
Lago Agrio litigation prolonged the life of the original investment in the Ecuadorian

99203,
hydrocarbons sector.

. The Respondent asserts that the tribunal in the Commercial
Cases Dispute did not decide either of these issues; but, rather, that tribunal founded
its jurisdiction on the basis of the original concession agreements and litigation arising
directly out of those agreements.?“ Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the
assumption of jurisdiction by the tribunal in the Commercial Cases Dispute does not

render the relevant jurisdictional issues in the present case res judicata.

The Respondent further asserts that this Tribunal should not treat the Commercial
Cases Dispute as “persuasive authority”, as argued by the Claimants. The Respondent
contends that, even if the questions decided there had been similar to those arising in

this dispute, the Tribunal would still be free to adopt a different solution and should do

205
so.

(v) Estoppel/Preclusion: The Respondent notes that the Claimants cite no examples of
any tribunal invoking the doctrines of estoppel or preclusion to supplant the
jurisdictional requirements of a BIT? In any event, the Respondent submits that the

Claimants cannot establish the requisite elements of estoppel: in particular, there has

been no representation by the Respondent; and, in the absence of any representation,

there can be no detrimental reliance by the Claimants.”

Similarly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants cannot rely on the doctrine of
preclusion to circumvent the BIT’s jurisdictional requirements, because this doctrine
would at the least require the Claimants to establish a representation by the
Respondent; and, again, there is none. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the
legal materials cited by the Claimants fail to establish that detrimental reliance is not a
necessary requirement of the doctrine of preclusion; and there is here no detrimental

reliance by the Claimants.”°*

(vi) Third Party Rights: The Respondent maintains that the principle in Monetary
Gold is applicable to this case. The Respondent also rejects the Claimants’ argument

that this arbitration concerns only disputes between the Claimants and the Respondent.

The Respondent points to the formal relief claimed by the Claimants in this case. It
refers to the declaration that Chevron has no liability or responsibility for
environmental impact arising out of the former Consortium that was jointly owned by
TexPet and the Respondent; the declaration that “any judgment rendered against
Chevron in the Lago Agrio litigation is not final, conclusive or enforceable”; the
declaration that the Respondent or PetroEcuador would be “exclusively liable” for any
judgment rendered in the Lago Agrio litigation; and an order that the Respondent “use
all measures necessary to prevent any judgment against Chevron in the Lago Agrio

litigation from becoming final, conclusive and enforceable.”

The Respondent submits that, if this relief were granted by this Tribunal, the
Claimants would have no Lago Agrio litigation to defend; and the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs would have no opportunity to obtain or enforce a favourable judgment. On
this basis, it is asserted, the Claimants cannot contend that this arbitration will not

affect the rights of third parties.?!°

The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ suggestion that the rights of the Lago
Agrio plaintiffs would be adequately protected by the Respondent in this arbitration,
noting that the Claimants cite no case where a State respondent has represented the
interests of third parties in an investment arbitration.”'! The Respondent also rejects
the Claimant’s suggestion that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs do not have any separate
rights from the Respondent on the basis (as alleged by the Claimants) that the
Respondent intends to take 90% of any judgment proceeds in that case for public
purposes. The Respondent contends that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ intention is for
90% of any judgment proceeds to be administered by an NGO as trustee for the

affected communities in the Amazon region.”

(vii) Fork in the Road: The Respondent submits that Claimants’ fork in the road
response lacks any legal merit, elevates form over substance and indicates an utter

disregard for the legal institutions before which the Claimants appear.

The Respondent reiterates its position that the issues before this Tribunal are identical
to the issues raised by the Claimants in other proceedings, and that, in particular, the
issue central to Chevron’s current claim in contract (i.e. the scope of the release in the
1995 Settlement Agreement) is exactly the same issue which Chevron has been
asserting in the Lago Agrio litigation.?" The Respondent contends that the Lago Agrio
court and this Tribunal are required to perform the same legal analysis, that is, to
determine whether the 1995 Settlement Agreement operates to bar non-signatory third
parties from asserting environmental claims against the Claimants and, if so, whether
that agreement would be legal and binding, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, on the Lago

Agrio plaintiffs.?"*

The Respondent rejects as “factually incorrect” the Claimants’ argument that they
have not triggered the BIT’s fork in the road provision because they have not
submitted this dispute to another forum, but are merely asserting defensive measures
in the Lago Agrio litigation.?'° The Respondent repeats that, in securing the dismissal
of the Aguinda litigation in New York, the Claimants deliberately opted for a trial in

Ecuador. Moreover, the Respondent contends that the invocation of the “contract”
issue in the Lago Agrio litigation is not a defensive measure by Chevron, but operates
offensively to “foist all responsibility upon the Republic for the damage alleged by the
Lago Agrio plaintiffs.”7!°

In this regard, the Respondent submits that it is irrelevant that the Claimants did not
join the Respondent as a party to the Lago Agrio litigation. In any event, the
Respondent highlights that the Claimants have asserted the same claims against the
Respondent in both the 2004 AAA Arbitration and the 2005 legal proceedings in the

217

New York District Court. The Respondent rejects the contention that the Lago

Agrio litigation is a “fundamentally different dispute ...involv[ing] fundamentally

different claims”.?'*

The Respondent, in support of its submission that Chevron promised to submit due
process claims to another forum, emphasises that, although the commitment was made
by Texaco, Chevron has nonetheless specifically invoked and adopted such
promise.””” The Respondent further rejects the Claimants’ suggestion, based on Lanco
v Argentina, that an investor’s agreement to a forum selection clause without the
actual filing of a claim is insufficient to trigger a fork in the road provision. The
Respondent submits that, in Lanco, the parties could not legally have chosen to submit
their dispute to the relevant domestic court; but that, in the present case, it was lawful
for Texaco (and Chevron) to make this promise to the US Courts.””° In any event, so
the Respondent contends, even if the fork in the road provision were not triggered by
this promise, Chevron is nonetheless estopped from maintaining these arbitration

proceedings because that would be fundamentally inconsistent with its promise.””!

Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ assertion that the BIT’s fork in the road
provision could not apply here on the ground that contract claims and treaty claims
can never be identical. The Respondent submits that this approach would deprive the

provision of any effet utile, since it would always prevent its operation in the context

of rights which are the principal subject of investment treaties.” In any event, the
Respondent notes that the Claimants do not attempt to deny that the contract claims in

the Lago Agrio litigation are the same as the contract claims in this arbitration.

E: The Claimants’ Rejoinder

The Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction on 6 November 2010.

Preliminary Statement: In their introductory remarks, the Claimants identify a number
of points which are said to be common ground between the Parties: the Respondent
concedes that TexPet did have an investment in the hydrocarbons sector in Ecuador,
only questioning the relationship between this original investment and the current
dispute between the Parties;””* and the Respondent agrees that the only jurisdictional
requirements which have to be fulfilled by the Claimants are those contained within

the BIT.?4

Rejoinder to the Respondent’s Reply: In general terms, the Claimants criticise the
Respondent for failing to address the principal jurisdictional issues and “straining

credibility” on other matters.?75

The Claimants then address first the applicable
standard of review, with the Claimants contending that the Respondent has
mischaracterised the factual basis of the Parties’ dispute, and then respond to each of
the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections, including the standing of TexPet and
Chevron, third party rights (with the Monetary Gold principle) and the application of

the BIT’s fork in the road provision.

(i) The Standard of Review: In the Claimants’ submission, the Tribunal, in deciding its

jurisdiction, may make legal and factual determinations on jurisdictional issues but

. 247

 

 

5 Thid., at para.

Part III — Page 55

3.192

3.193

3.194

3.195

should not determine any merits issues. The Claimants agree with the Respondent
that, if a jurisdictional issue “hinges on a factual determination that may also relate to
the merits of the claims”, the Tribunal may determine the facts to the extent necessary
for jurisdictional purposes.””” In the Claimants’ submission, it is therefore necessary to

identify which issues are jurisdictional in nature.

In this regard, the Claimants assert that “the Government’s collusion in the Lago
Agrio litigation and the scope of the diffuse rights claims released by the Settlement
and Release Agreements are not [jurisdictional issues] and their resolution must await
the merits stage”.°8 The Claimants submit that, to determine these particular issues,
the Tribunal would be required to address the merits in order to decide whether the
parties intended contractually to release the diffuse rights claims asserted by the

plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio litigation.”

The Claimants further emphasise that all their claims satisfy the applicable “prima
facie” standard of review, asserting that the Respondent has been unable to rebut the
weight of the legal materials supporting the “prima facie” test. The Claimants dispute
the Respondent’s reliance on the Joy Mining jurisdictional award, noting that that

approach has been discredited in subsequent cases.*°

(iii) Mischaracterised Facts: The Claimants contend that the Respondent has

mischaracterised the material facts of the Parties’ dispute, in two particular ways.

First, the Claimants criticise the Respondent’s response to the evidence of fraud and
improper collusion in the Lago Agrio litigation.?"! The Claimants highlight evidence
which (according to the Claimants) demonstrates the Respondent’s substantial

3,252 and the Claimants

involvement in the Lago Agrio litigation dating back to 200
submit that, in the light of this evidence, the Respondent cannot dismiss the facts of

this case as “merely a matter of ‘Government representatives mak[ing] themselves

 

28? Thid., at para. 25

Part III — Page 56

3.196

3.197

accessible to parties in a dispute’ 78

The Claimants contend that the Respondent
either simply ignores this evidence or makes “feeble excuses” for the high-level

contacts revealed by such evidence.”™

Second, the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s factual chronology of TexPet’s
investment is incorrect. The Claimants contend that the environmental remediation
agreements reached between TexPet and the Respondent, together with the work

5
235 Ty

carried out under those agreements, formed part of the underlying investment.
this regard, the Claimants highlight (inter alia) the facts that the Respondent’s Minister
of Energy and Mines first indicated that an environmental audit would be essential in
May 1990 and that PetroEcuador and TexPet entered into the contract of
environmental investigation services in April 1992 (before the 1973 Concession
Agreement expired).”*° The Claimants submit that, after receiving the results of the
environmental audits, TexPet, PetroEcuador and the Respondent negotiated the
allocation of environmental liabilities between themselves, “as a continued part of the
process that had begun at least as early as 1990.”?57 The Claimants assert that it was
clear that the parties were actively negotiating their responsibilities for remediation

well before the end of the 1973 Concession Agreement.”**

(iv) Res Judicata/Issue Preclusion: The Claimants reject the Respondent’s contention
that the tribunal’s decision in the Commercial Cases Dispute is not preclusive in this
arbitration on the basis that it is not dispositive of the existence of an “investment” or
an “investment agreement” under the BIT. The Claimants assert that the relevant
question is whether the previous tribunal’s decision was “essential or fundamental” to
its award, and that there is no requirement that the determination be “dispositive” in
the subsequent arbitration.” The Claimants further contend that the premise of the
earlier tribunal’s determination is also irrelevant for the purposes of establishing its res

judicata effect before the later tribunal.”

The Claimants acknowledge that the Commercial Cases Dispute tribunal did not
expressly determine whether the activities, claims and rights under the settlement
agreements constituted part of the Claimants’ overall “investment” in Ecuador.
However, the Claimants submit that there is a “close similarity” between these issues
and the tribunal’s decision that “lawsuits concern[ing] the liquidation and settlement
of claims relating to [an] investment ... form part of that investment”. On this basis,
the Claimants assert that the tribunal’s decision is, at the very least, of highly

persuasive effect before this Tribunal.”!

Further, the Claimants reject again the Respondent’s contention that the tribunal’s
decision in the Commercial Cases Dispute cannot be considered res judicata since it
was made in an interim award and therefore cannot have such effect under Dutch law.
The Claimants note that the Respondent do not put forward any example in which an
international tribunal has applied domestic law to determine the res judicata effect of a

decision made by another international tribunal.”

(v) Article VI(1)(c): The Claimants maintain that this Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione

materiae over the Claimants’ claims pursuant to Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT.

The Claimants contend again, at some length, that their investment in Ecuador must be
viewed holistically and, consequently, incorporates the settlement agreements. In the
Claimants’ submission, the sole question for this Tribunal in relation to jurisdiction
ratione materiae under Article VI(1)(c) is whether a sufficient nexus exists between
TexPet’s underlying oil activities and the activities, rights and claims arising under the

243

settlement agreements.” The Claimants highlight several factors which, so they

submit, entirely dispose of the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction.*

First, the legal framework governing the Claimants’ investment confirms the nexus.
The Claimants reiterate that the BIT expressly protects the investment throughout its
lifespan, in particular citing Articles (3), II(3)(b) and II(7) of the BIT. The Claimants

dispute the Respondent’s argument that the BIT was not aimed at protecting rights

 

244 Thid., at para. 45

Part III — Page 58

3.203

3.204

3.205

associated with remediation and wind-up activities, but only at stimulating future
foreign investment. The Claimants highlight (inter alia) Article XII(1) of the BIT,
which expressly protects past investments existing at the time of the BIT’s entry into

- 2
force.

The Claimants further contend that the Ecuadorian legal framework confirms the
nexus between TexPet’s underlying operations and the settlement agreements. The
Claimants submit that, by investing in Ecuador, TexPet became subject to Ecuadorian
law and that, consequently, TexPet’s operations were governed by environmental
obligations contained both in the 1973 Concession Agreement and under Ecuadorian
law.™° The Claimants contend that section 46 of the 1973 Concession Agreement and
Ecuadorian law indicate that the parties contemplated that some environmental
remediation would be a part of the original investment operation.” The Claimants
accordingly reject the Respondent’s suggestion that the remediation issues are not part

of the “natural winding up” of TexPet’s original investment.”**

The Claimants also contend that the nexus is confirmed by the parties’ agreements.
The Claimants submit that the Respondent attempts both to limit the scope of the 1973
Concession Agreement and to minimise the relationship between the settlement
agreements and TexPet’s original investment. In the Claimants’ submission, both of

these contentions are wrong.”?

In particular, the Claimants reiterate a number of examples in the language in the
settlement agreements, which (it is said) indicate that the remediation activities were
part of the original investment, including several express references to the 1973
Concession Agreement.”*° The Claimants submit that the Respondent ignores almost

all of these examples and focuses instead on peripheral issues.?>!

 

251 Thid., at para. 62

Part III — Page 59

3.206

3.207

3.208

3.209

Further, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s submission that because the settlement
agreements were entered into voluntarily, these agreements must be divorced from the
original concession agreements. In the Claimants’ submission, the mechanism by
which TexPet chose to comply with its obligations does not establish that those

obligations did not arise from the 1973 Concession Agreement.””

The Claimants note that the Respondent argues that, at best, the only link which could
be established between the original investment and the settlement agreements is a “but
for” link; and that the Respondent argues that such a link is legally insufficient
because a “material legal connection” is required. In response to these arguments, the
Claimants submit that the Respondent does not cite any legal materials establishing
that a “but for” link is insufficient, or that supports the Respondent’s alleged threshold
of a “material legal connection”.”** Further, the Claimants dismiss the Respondent’s
attempt to distinguish the arbitral jurisprudence on the lifespan of the investment
doctrine and the holistic approach, as “wholly unconvincing”. 24 The Claimants
highlight the Jnmaris decision in particular, noting that the tribunal there indicated that

the “contractual cross references” supported the integrated nature of the operations.”°>

Second, the Claimants maintain that the settlement agreements also qualify as ‘free-

standing investments’ under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT.

In asserting that these settlement agreements can independently qualify as
investments, the Claimants emphasise that they fall squarely within the definition of
“investment” in the BIT. The Claimants contend that, although the Respondent “pays
lip service” to the BIT’s language, it fails to address the Claimants’ submissions that:
(i) the text and structure of Article I(1)(a) is “broad and all-encompassing” and that
other provisions of the BIT similarly indicate that the parties intended the definition of
“investment” to be as broad as possible; (ii) arbitral jurisprudence supports an
expansive interpretation of the BIT’s definition; and (iii) the investment falls squarely

within at least three separate categories of “investment” listed in Article 1(1)(a).°°

 

Part III — Page 60

3.210

3.211

3.212

3.213

 

The Claimants contend that the language and structure of the BIT is crucial, because
“the categories of investments were carefully crafted by the BIT’s drafters and
embody the parties’ consent”. If the parties had intended to include economic

characteristics, they could have done so — but, significantly, did not do $0.27

The Claimants also dispute the Respondent’s arguments regarding “intrinsic economic
traits”. The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s position has changed with its
Reply Memorial because it now argues that the settlement agreements do not bear any
“intrinsic economic traits”.** The Claimants emphasise that the Respondent’s
“pragmatic approach” acknowledges that economic characteristics are merely
“benchmarks” and are not jurisdictional criteria.?°° Indeed, the Claimants assert that

this position has considerable support in arbitral jurisprudence.?

The Claimants reject the policy reasons by reference to which the Respondent
encourages this Tribunal to apply an “economic characteristics” threshold. In
particular, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s suggestion that these
characteristics need to be universally applied to ensure a consistent application of
investor protection is misplaced. The Claimants note that Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention does not define an “investment”.?°! Further, the Claimants submit, even if
an ICSID and UNCITRAL tribunal were to adopt different approaches, that should not
be disparaged since the BIT expressly allows for a claimant’s choosing between

ICSID and the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.”

In any event, the Claimants reiterate that the settlement agreements do satisfy the
inherent economic traits of an “investment” under this BIT. The Claimants submit that
the Respondent wrongly seeks to parse the settlement agreements into separate parts,
whereas the tribunal in Jnmaris v Ukraine made clear that “... it is sufficient that the

« : 99263
transaction as whole meets those requirements. 26

Ibid., at para. 94

Part III — Page 61

3.214

3.215

3.216

3.217

 

Third, the Claimants maintain that the Municipal and Provincial Releases also qualify

as investments under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT.

The Claimants reject the Respondent’s argument that these Municipal and Provincial
Releases are irrelevant. The Claimants submit that: “The overlapping, independently
sufficient and comprehensive corpus of release agreements executed by every
governmental entity with even arguable standing to assert such claims reinforces
Claimants’ legitimate expectations to be free from any further diffuse environmental

992

claims...” The Claimants contend that the 1995 Settlement Agreement on the one

 

hand and the Municipal and Provincial Releases on the other are each sufficient to bar

all “diffuse” environmental liability claims alleged against the Claimants.”°°

(vi) Article VI(1)(a) - TexPet’s Claims: The Claimants contend that the Respondent’s
only response to the Claimants’ submissions on this point in their Counter-Memorial
is to reiterate its previous arguments that the Claimants cannot establish, even on a
prima facie basis, that the Claimants have an investment dispute relating to an
investment agreement with the Respondent.” The Claimants note that the
Respondent’s arguments that: (i) the dispute does not relate to the original concession
agreements, and (ii) that the settlement agreements do not constitute “investment
agreements” under the BIT, are in fact raised only in the context of the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections concerning Chevron. The Claimants nonetheless maintain

that the Respondent’s submissions are equally misplaced with regard to TexPet.

First, as regards the original Concession Agreements, the Claimants stress first the
broad meaning of the phrase “relating to” in Article VI(1) of the BIT. The Claimants
contend that the Respondent appears to embrace the Claimants’ interpretation of this
phrase, merely arguing that there is no “legally significant connection” between the

7

dispute and the original concession agreements.” In rejecting the Respondent’s

argument, the Claimants highlight, in particular, the following factors.

. 102

. 106

267 Thid., at para. 108

Part III — Page 62

3.218

3.219

3.220

 

It will not be possible for the Tribunal to decide whether there is a breach of the 1995
Settlement Agreement without referring to the original concession agreements because

the releases specifically applies to claims “...arising from the Operations of the
Consortium”, which is defined in the 1995 Settlement Agreement as covering
activities carried out under the “Consortium Agreements”, which in turn is defined as
including the 1973 concession agreement.*** This is not simply a “but for”
connection, but rather that the concession agreements constitute a “key element of the
circumstances giving rise to TexPet’s claims”.”° The Respondent also fails to address
the Claimants’ submission that the plaintiffs in the Lago Agrio litigation specifically
allege that TexPet violated its obligations under section 46 of the 1973 Concession
Agreement.” The 1995 Settlement Agreement contains numerous provisions which
link the parties’ rights and obligations under that 1995 agreement to the “Consortium
Agreements” and the “operations of the Consortium”,?”! Lastly, in the context of the
question whether an arbitration agreement contained in an original contract is
applicable to disputes regarding a later agreement which settles disputes arising under
the original contract, the Claimants reiterate that courts and tribunals have consistently
held that a claim for breach of such a settlement agreement “relates to” the original
contract,?”* and that this approach applies equally to non-contractual disputes provided

that they relate to the original contract.?”3

Given these several factors, the Claimants contend that both the contractual and non-
contractual claims which TexPet and the Respondent settled under the 1995
Settlement Agreement “related to” the original concession agreements; and the

Parties’ dispute in this arbitration relates to both as an investment.””*

Second, as regards the settlement agreements qualifying as “investment agreements”,
the Claimants contend that the Respondent’s approach conflicts with the rules of
treaty interpretation contained in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. In

particular, the Claimants submit that the Respondent’s reliance on extrinsic materials

is both unnecessary and inappropriate, given that the meaning of this phrase can be
clearly established by applying the “ordinary” rules of interpretation in Article 31 of

+ + 5
the Vienna Convention.””*

The Claimants submit that the USA-Russia BIT (invoked by the Respondent) actually
supports the Claimants’ broad interpretation of “investment agreement”.””° The
Claimants dispute the relevance of the 1994 and 2004 US Model BITs and warn that
Professor Vandevelde’s assertion about the “underlying intent in prior models” is

contradicted elsewhere in his writings.?””

Moreover, the Claimants reiterate that the
broad meaning of “investment agreement” is supported by the internal structure of the
BIT, in particular the use of the phrase in Article X(2)(c), the reference back to Article

VI(1)(a) and the context provided by the Preamble and the Umbrella Clause?”

In any event, so the Claimants assert, the “costly and extensive” remediation works
undertaken by TexPet under the settlement agreements constitute “investments”; and
that, since those obligations were undertaken under the settlement agreements, those
agreements must therefore be “investment agreements” for the purposes of Article

VI(1)(a) of the BIT.?”

(vii) Article VI(1)(a) - Chevron’s Claims: The Claimants maintain that the important
difference between the Parties as regards Chevron is the interpretation and application
of the requirement, in Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, that the investment agreement be

“between” the claimant and the respondent host State.”*°

The Claimants submit that Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT does not require that the
claimant be a signatory or even a party to the investment agreement: the word
“between” bears a wider meaning. The Claimants refer to the English dictionary
definition of “serving to connect or unite in a relationship”.”*! On this basis, the

Claimants submit that an investment agreement conferring legal rights on a third party

which are enforceable against a State qualifies as an “investment agreement between”

that third party and the host State.”*?

In further support of this submission, the Claimants emphasise that in circumstances
where an arbitration agreement requires that parties to the arbitration be “parties” to
the contract containing the arbitration agreement, the courts have consistently held
that a third party beneficiary should be treated as a party to the contract for the
purposes of determining whether a tribunal has jurisdiction under the arbitration

agreement.”*?

Further, the Claimants reiterate that the Respondent is estopped from objecting to this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over Chevron’s claims on the basis that Chevron did not sign
the settlement agreements, because: (i) the Lago Agrio Court’s assertion of de facto
jurisdiction over Chevron is clearly intended to circumvent the application of these
settlement agreements; (ii) the issues that Chevron seeks to have decided in this
arbitration are “intricately intertwined” with the settlement agreements; and (iii) the
Respondent (and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs) cannot assert that Chevron is responsible
for TexPet’s alleged conduct in domestic litigation, whilst at the same time asserting
that Chevron is separate from TexPet in regard to the enforcement of the settlement

2
agreements.”**

The Claimants also maintain that Chevron has standing to enforce the settlement
agreements against the Respondent. The Claimants highlight five factors in support of

this submission.

First, Chevron is a “Releasee” under the 1995 Settlement Agreement made with the
Respondent. The Claimants emphasise that this question should be approached on the
basis of the rules of contractual interpretation contained in the Ecuadorian Civil Code;
and that, applying these rules, the Spanish word “principales” clearly means “parent

285

corporation”, i.e. covering Chevron as TexPet’s parent.’ The analysis of the

Respondent’s expert, Dr Salgado, is criticised as “flawed” by the Claimants because it

. 133
- 134
. 139

Part III — Page 65

3.229

3.230

3.231

flies in the face of the parties’ objective intentions, which (as Dr Salgado himself

acknowledges) is the “ultimate interpretive inquiry” under Ecuadorian law.?8°

The Claimants further emphasise that it would make no sense to interpret
“principales” as being confined to the relationship of principal and agent because an
agent, acting within the scope of its agency, does not bind itself contractually. Thus,
there would be no point in a settlement agreement providing for the release of liability
of such agents. Moreover, in the 1995 Settlement Agreement, TexPet was not acting
in an agency capacity for a separate principal; but, rather, it was acting in its own
capacity to negotiate a release of liability in respect of its own alleged conduct. On
this basis, it is submitted by the Claimants that the Respondent’s interpretation of

“principales” would mean that the Respondent’s release applied to no party at all.87

The Claimants also emphasise that the Respondent concedes that the Municipal and
Provincial Releases do cover Chevron in their releases. In the Claimants’ submission,
the parties cannot have intended Chevron (as a future parent) to be released under
some settlement agreements but not under the 1995 Settlement Agreement.*** The
Claimants note that the Municipal and Provincial Releases also expressly name
Texaco as a releasee; and consequently the Respondent cannot consistently argue that
the express reference to Texaco in the 1995 Settlement Agreement indicates that the

parties did not intend there to include Chevron as a Releasee.””

Second, the settlement agreements cover future parent corporations as owners. The
Claimants note that, in arguing that the 1995 Settlement Agreement cannot be taken to
release future parent corporations, the Respondent must necessarily be acknowledging
the corporate distinction between Texaco and Chevron; and that the Respondent then
relies on that legal distinction to assert that Chevron cannot take any benefit under the
1995 Settlement Agreement. However, as the Claimants emphasise again, the
Respondent here tries to have it both ways, because the Respondent also holds

Chevron legally accountable for the separate conduct of Texaco.”

The Claimants dispute the Respondent’s reliance on US case law in support of its
contention that future parent corporations should not be regarded as covered releasees,
emphasising that the 1995 Settlement Agreement must be construed according to
Ecuadorian law.” Additionally, the Claimants note that the Respondent’s reliance on
Nagel v Czech Republic is misplaced because that arbitration concerned a materially
different factual dispute.” Again, the Claimants emphasise that, in determining the
scope of the release, the principal inquiry is directed at the parties’ objective
intentions. In this regard, the Claimants submit that it would have made no sense for
the parties to enter into an agreement which did not release future parent corporations

from liability, such as Chevron.?”?

Third, the Claimants have maintained a consistent position as to Chevron’s standing;
and that the Respondent wrongly argues that the Claimants’ interpretation of
“principales” contradicts earlier positions taken by the Claimants. Moreover, the
Claimants contend that the materials cited by the Respondent in fact demonstrate that
the Claimants have consistently taken the view that the release extends to parent

corporations, i.e. Chevron.?"

Fourth, the Respondent concedes that Releasees may enforce their rights. The
Claimants notes that the Respondent agrees that “Article 9.4 cannot be interpreted to
mean the releasees may not invoke and enforce the releases that the Agreement
expressly provides to them.” However, the Claimants do not agree with the
Respondent’s argument that persons who are not covered releasees may not invoke the
1995 Settlement Agreement. Rather, the Claimants contend that, if the Respondent
seeks to assert liability against Chevron as if it were TexPet, then Chevron may invoke

TexPet’s defences against the Respondent’s claim.

Fifth, Chevron has standing to assert BIT claims against the Respondent as a result of
its status as TexPet’s indirect shareholder. The Claimants reject the Respondent’s
analysis of the cited legal materials to the effect that indirect shareholders may only
- 153

. 156

Part III — Page 67

3.236

3.237

3.238

 
  

bring a claim in respect of the diminution in the value of their shares in the investor-
company. The Claimants consider in detail the treatise by Messrs Ripinsky and
Williams, submitting that their analysis does not support the Respondent’s position,
but rather indicates that it is legally possible for an indirect shareholder’s investment
to be characterised as the “underlying business unit’, in particular where a BIT
contains a broad definition of “investment”. In the present case, the Claimants submit
that the BIT definition extends broadly to “every kind of investment in the territory of
one Party owned or controlled directly or indirectly by national or companies of the
other Party”; and Chevron’s investment should therefore be understood as the “assets

and legal rights of the underlying business unit.”°

Similarly, the Claimants contend that the decision of the ICSID annulment committee
in Azurix v Argentina supports their contentions: the committee there decided, as a
result of Azurix’s shareholding in ABA, that Azurix had “interests in the assets” of
ABA, and that these interests included ABA’s legal and contractual rights.?°7 In the
light of this analysis of academic and arbitral materials, the Claimants contend that
Chevron’s investment can include both its shares in TexPet and also its interests in

TexPet’s assets, contractual rights and claims to performance.”

The Claimants dispute the suggestion that TexPet cannot constitute Chevron’s
“investment” because TexPet is not incorporated in Ecuador. The Claimants submit
that the BIT defines a “company” of a party as a company that is “legally constituted
under the laws and regulations of a Party”; and that, moreover, the definition of
“investment” is not so limited. Thus, the Claimants submit that TexPet can be an

Chevron’ s “investment” in Ecuador.”””

In any event, the Claimants reiterate that, even if Chevron can only assert a claim
based on the diminution in the value of its shares in TexPet, it clearly has standing to

do so since TexPet’s shares are worth more with the release than without the release,

and therefore the Respondent’s conduct in undermining the release inevitably

. p > 3
undermines the value of TexPet’s shares.*°

(viii) TexPet’s Standing: The Claimants also maintain that TexPet has standing to
enforce the settlement agreements against the Respondent in this arbitration for itself
and for Chevron’s benefit. The Claimants make three particular points in support of

this submission.

First, under Ecuadorian law, a party may seek specific performance of a contract, even
if has suffered no damage from the other party’s breach. The Claimants contend that
the Respondent’ own legal expert on Ecuadorian law supports this proposition.*”!
Second, the TexPet has shown that it has suffered damage. The Claimants rely on the
submission that the Respondent’s conduct violates international law and _ that
consequently TexPet has suffered moral damage for which international law allows
compensation (as claimed by TexPet); and further, that moral damages may be
claimed under the Ecuadorian Civil Code.*” Third, the Claimants submit that TexPet
has standing to seek a declaratory interpretation of the settlement agreements in

circumstances where the parties dispute the content of those rights and obligations.*”

(ix) Estoppel/Preclusion: The Claimants acknowledge that they do not rely on these
doctrines as providing an independent basis for this Tribunal’s jurisdiction, but rather
contend that the Respondent is thereby precluded from making jurisdictional
objections based on its own inconsistent positions.*™* The Claimants reiterate that the
Respondent has “blown hot and cold” with regard to the corporate separateness of
Chevron, TexPet and Texaco in various legal proceedings; and the Claimants contend

that these inconsistent positions indicate a lack of good faith by the Respondent.*”

In response to the Respondent’s arguments on estoppel, the Claimants contend that a
representation may be founded on inaction or silence.*° In any event, the Claimants

submit that the Respondent has communicated its position clearly on numerous

. 174

- 184

Part III — Page 69

3.243

3.244

   
  
 

occasions, for example by instigating criminal proceedings against Chevron’s
lawyers.°” Moreover, the Claimants contend that it is not necessary for the
representation to relate specifically to international law and the jurisdictional
requirements of the BIT: it is enough that the Respondent has represented that it has

se ae 3
jurisdiction over Chevron.” 08

(x) Third Party Rights: The Claimants maintain that there are no legitimate third party
rights at issue in these arbitration proceedings. The Claimants reiterate that the
Monetary Gold principle is inapplicable here because the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not
asserting separate legal rights, but are asserting the same rights which the Respondent
released in the settlement agreements.*” The Claimants acknowledge that their
position on third party rights is not solely based on the Attorney General’s statement
regarding the administration of the Lago Agrio judgment.*!° The Claimants contend
that the Respondent represented and released the same rights that the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs now assert; and, since the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are asserting the interests of
the Ecuadorian community to live in a clean environment, the Ecuadorian Constitution
expressly obliges the Ecuadorian State to represent those interests. In the Claimants’
submission, the Respondent did represent those interests in entering into the
settlement agreements. Moreover, in the light of this constitutional provision, the
Respondent is obliged and not merely entitled to represent any interest which the Lago

Agrio plaintiffs may have in these arbitration proceedings.*!!

More generally, the Claimants repeat that the Monetary Gold principle should not be
extended to investor-state arbitration, based on the contention that whilst the Tribunal
in this arbitration may determine the Respondent’s international obligations under the
BIT, the domestic Lago Agrio litigation operates on a different legal plane.*? The
Claimants therefore contend that if the Tribunal’s determination of the Respondent’s
obligations under the BIT were to jeopardise the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ rights under

Ecuadorian law, that may create an issue between those plaintiffs and the Respondent;

. 192

3.246

3.248

 

but the Respondent is not thereby permitted to rely upon its domestic obligations to
313

evade its international law obligations to the Claimants.
(xi) Fork in the Road: The Claimants maintain that the Respondent’s Reply ignores
the plain meaning of the fork in the road provision in Article VI(3) of the BIT. The

Claimants make four specific points.

First, Chevron did not submit the investment dispute in this case to the Lago Agrio
Court. The Claimants stress that the BIT’s fork in the road provision is predicated on
an “investment dispute” that cannot be settled amicably; and, consequently, the
Respondent must show that the same “investment dispute” has been submitted to
domestic legal proceedings. The Claimants reiterate that the issues and relief sought in
the Lago Agrio litigation are materially different from those at issue in this arbitration.
In particular, in this arbitration the Claimants assert positive claims against the
Respondent (inter alia) for violations of the BIT and breaches of the settlement
agreements. However, in the Lago Agrio litigation, the Claimants have brought no
positive claims against the Respondent and have merely relied on the settlement

agreements for the dismissal of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ claims.*!*

Second, the Claimants did not submit this investment dispute to the New York Courts.
The Claimants contend that, even if the Claimants had submitted the same investment
dispute to the New York Courts, this could not trigger the BIT’s fork in the road
provision given that these were legal proceedings in the USA and not Ecuador.*! In
any event, the Claimants deny that they ever submitted this dispute to the New York
Courts. In particular, the Claimants emphasise that the Respondent sought and
obtained the dismissal of the Claimants’ counterclaims in the New York litigation on
the basis of sovereign immunity and forum non conveniens. Accordingly, the
Claimants submit that the Respondent cannot now rely on these counterclaims for the

purpose of its arguments under the BIT’s fork in the road provision.*'°

Third, the Claimants maintain that they have never submitted this investment dispute

in the Aguinda litigation in New York. As regards the Respondent’s reliance on the

- 200
. 207
- 208

Part III — Page 71

3.249

3.250

undertaking by Texaco, the Claimants contend that, as a matter of fact, the
undertaking was much more narrowly defined than the Respondent now suggests; and
in particular that it made clear that Texaco did not waive “all claims and defences that
it may have or be entitled to assert...’ Further, the Claimants reject the
Respondent’s argument that Chevron adopted the “representation” made by Texaco.
The Claimants note that the documents cited by the Respondent only refer to the
forum non conveniens dismissal, which, as the Claimants explain, was not given on

the basis of the broad “promise” which the Respondent now alleges.°"*

Moreover, the Claimants maintain that the forum non conveniens dismissal by the
New York Courts cannot trigger the BIT’s fork in the road provision, since it relates to
legal proceedings in the USA, whereas the BIT’s fork in the road provision is only

° The Claimants reiterate their

triggered by Ecuadorian legal proceedings.*!
submissions that the fork in the road provision also requires a claimant to have made a
choice; and it therefore cannot apply to a situation where the claimant in the arbitral
proceedings has been forced to defend earlier domestic proceedings.*”°

(xii) Estoppel: In rejecting the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants are estopped
from bringing their claims in this arbitration because these arbitration proceedings are
“fundamentally inconsistent” with their alleged promise given to the US courts, the
Claimants again highlight the limited nature of the undertaking given by Texaco to the
New York Courts.*?! The Claimants reiterate that, even if such a promise had been
given as alleged by the Respondent, it was premised on Texaco (with Chevron)
receiving fair treatment from the Ecuadorian Courts; and that the deterioration and
lack of independence of the Ecuadorian judiciary in this case prevents any estoppel

arising in favour of the Respondent.*”

(G) The Jurisdiction Hearing

The Parties developed their respective cases orally at the Jurisdiction Hearing, by their
legal representatives. No factual or expert witness testified before the Tribunal at this
Hearing. It would lengthen unduly this summary of the Parties’ jurisdictional cases by
describing here the Parties’ oral submissions; and the Tribunal have taken these fully
into account in its analysis of the Parties’ overall submissions below in Part IV of this

Award.

The Respondent’s Attorney-General: However, it is appropriate here to set out the
opening address made by the Respondent’s Attorney-General at the Jurisdiction
Hearing, as interpreted and recorded in the English transcript of the Hearing, as

follows [D1.8]:

“Members of the Tribunal, I participate in this Hearing in my condition of
Procurador General of the State of the Republic of Ecuador. With me are some of the
members of the team that is in charge of the responsibility of defending the Republic
in this international arbitration of investors and state. Before allowing to speak our
lawyers of Winston and Matrix I want to talk to you briefly.

As a first point, I would like to talk about the present justice system in Ecuador. In the
year 2008, the latest Constitutional Assembly in Ecuador as an expression of
sovereign expression of the Ecuadorian nation approved the new Constitution that
rules our country at the moment. This fundamental law is a product of the most
important democratic exercise in Ecuador in the later years, with more than 63
percent of votes in favour of the referendum which approved the Constitution.

In terms of the justice administration, the new Constitution consolidated previous
efforts of the judicial reform of Nineties. Although still we are not in the position that
we would like to be, we are achieving important progress in this ambit. First of all,
we have to concentrate the existence of Courts and other Tribunals to marginal places
allowing better access to justice. [Secondly,] There is an improvement in justice
efficiency in relation to the number of cases that are resolved. Thirdly, we have
achieved greater transparency and publicity in terms of the activities of the judiciary;
and, fourthly, we have developed norms that rules behaviour of judges and lawyers.

In this way, in our system of justice is an improvement. There is advancement. We

continuously improve trying to achieve high standards, standards of efficiency for the
benefit of the Ecuadorian society.

Part III — Page 73

Now we concentrate in the present arbitration. The Ecuadorian Republic is trying to
be trapped in a private controversy between two private litigants that are foreign to
the State: On the one hand, the transnational companies Chevron and Texaco, and
the other part, the indigenous people from Lago Agrio. In this litigation, what is at
stake is the improvement of health in a locality of Ecuador that is still pending a
resolution vis-a-vis a court in Amazonia in Ecuador. The Ecuadorian State is not part
of this case. The controversy is being known by the presidency of the Provincial
Court in Lago Agrio as a result of a litigation of 10 years against the Claimants and
the tribunals of the United States. In that moment, the Claimants supported, without
any objection, and presented the advantages of a judicial system vis-a-vis the Courts
of the United States.

So, our judicial system should be in charge of knowing about this case in Lago Agrio.
At the moment, the Claimants have decided that they don't want to litigate against the
Claimants of Lago Agrio, but they want to replace these Claimants with the Republic
of Ecuador as part of the controversy, and they fabricated a crisis in the justice
administration and a problem of Government in Ecuador. They have redirected that
offensive against those that once offered an excellent relationship in previous decades.

The Claimants pretend to come unto this Arbitration Tribunal claiming for rights that
they don't have in violation of the judicial commitments in the United States. So, the
Republic of Ecuador, in an unconstitutional manner, should violate independency of
the legal system to close a case of Lago Agrio.

I accepted my designation, and I have done my job as Procurador of the State of the
Republic of Ecuador convinced and respectful of the autonomy of the functions of the
State because I am convinced of the independency of the justice system of my country
and the process of change. But by the same token I am very conscious of the difficult
problems affecting our systems still. We still have delays in processes in front of our
courts. We have complaints against dishonest Courts, and we have problems of
salaries for judges and Magistrates and lawyers. But I am conscious of our problems.

 

We know our deficiencies, but we are working to correct them. The recent institution
by the Council of Judiciary of Juan Nunez, who was in charge of the case of Lago
Agrio until September 2009, is the testimony of the efforts to achieve a justice
administration more robust and transparent.

From the reading of Memorials and other communications from the Claimants in the
present arbitration case, it is obvious that we are talking of different illicit case of the
Claimants of Lago Agrio. But it is more obvious that the Claimants tried to convert
the local litigation in Ecuador in an international litigation against a sovereign State
has not been part of the controversy, particularly where one of the parties,
transnational companies that have unlimited resources who now have presented this
arbitration of investments looking for the protection under the argument that to
operate in Ecuador is inconvenient. We have to understand inconvenient to their
interests, of course.

The position of the Ecuadorian Republic in the case of Lago Agrio as well as the

position of Ecuador in any litigation of similar characteristics in Ecuadorian Courts
is very clear and firm position. It's a litigation between private parties, the Claimants

Part III — Page 74

3.253

of Lago Agrio and Chevron, and the only role that the Republic of Ecuador in this
case has to fulfil is to be the forum through its system of justice administration of a
litigation where Chevron previously tried to prove; that is, in Ecuador where the case
should be known.

 

The Republic of Ecuador does not deny the support that [Texaco] received of the
Government at the time in a note to the State Department of the United States, inviting
the American Government to intervene in the case Aguinda with the intention to send
the case to Ecuador. The same way we do not deny that the Governments of the time
including the present administration made public the declarations in support of the
people of Lago Agrio, but I conclude in two things.

First of all, there is no indication that in the case of Lago Agrio or its antecessor Lago
Inda [Aguinda]; secondly, the Republic of Ecuador never interfered with the judicial
process of Lago Agrio. The Republic of Ecuador has become the center of an attack
by Chevron against the Ecuadorian State. Ecuador had to confront, to face this with
the limited resources it has, different legal cases. The first case is Chevron of AAA
and the courts of New York. The second case, Chevron is an arbitration of investment
based in The Hague. And this arbitration, that is a third case presented by Chevron,
and especially the machine of public relations of the Claimants that every year work
in the corridors of the American Congress and also in the offices of the
representatives of commerce of the United States looking to cancel the preferences
that Ecuador enjoys from the commercial viewpoint, with the intention of pressurizing
the Government to intervene in the case of Lago Agrio in favour of Chevron.

This offensive without limit started in 2003, when Ecuador informed Chevron and the
demandantes of Lago Agrio that it would keep a neutral position in this case, and we
refused to interfere with the justice administration to disqualify this claim.

In this Hearing of Jurisdiction that starts today, a request from you, members of the
Court, that you look at this arbitration as what it is really, the effort by the Claimants
to transform artificially a domestic litigation between private parties in the
controversy of international characters between a State and investors, eliminating the
rights of the Ecuadorian Courts and the people of Lago Agrio denying or claiming
elements of a Treaty -- of investment five years after Texaco left our country after
collecting enormous profits, thanks to our oil, during 20 years.”

Chevron’s General Counsel: In response, Chevron’s General Counsel, Mr Pate, made
the following statement (in English), which it is similarly appropriate to cite in full, as

recorded in the transcript [D1.111], as follows:

“It was a privilege to hear directly from Solicitor General Garcia. His decision to
address the Tribunal himself shows the importance of this matter to his client. I
likewise will make a few preliminary points before turning to Mr. Bishop and
Professor Crawford for the substantive presentations.

Part III — Page 75

Chevron take no pleasure any in dispute with any sovereign Government. Chevron
prides itself on constructive relations with Governments that employ widely varying
systems and policies of Government and hold wildly varying attitudes toward the
Government policies of the United States.

 

Chevron’s subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum Company, pursued constructive relations
with Ecuador from the 1960s to the 1990s when the Government of Ecuador decided
at that time that the entire Concession and operation should be awarded to the
PetroEcuador company.

During Texaco's time, it earned profits described as enormous by Dr. Garcia, of some
$500 million. Ecuador's royalties, taxes, and other earnings during that same time
period were approximately $23 billion, and approximately $116 billion through 2008.
Texaco cleaned up when it left and awaits PetroEcuador's promised cleanup of its
share of past impacts, not to mention what PetroEcuador will do about its pollution
during the succeeding 18 years.

Let me now make some comments that relate to the so-called “Lago Agrio Plaintiffs”,
not to the Government of Ecuador. Chevron believes the dramatic evidence in the
Crude video outtakes and recently produced documents has brought this entire
situation into a fundamentally new phase. The Tribunal need not take my word for
this, for several U.S. federal judges have noted that the evidence has “sent shock
waves through the legal community”, and shows activity that should be recognized as
fraud by any Court.

Fraudulent filings, threats to judges, procuring sham criminal charges to be bartered
for settlement money, and other activities by the American Plaintiffs' lawyers and their
allies have been shown on high definition video and in the Plaintiffs' lawyers own
documents.

 

Chevron will not give the so-called ‘Lago Agrio Plaintiffs' lawyers’, whomever they
really represent, the extorted settlement money they seek. As to them, we hope only
that they will be brought to justice by the appropriate authorities.

Now, Chevron has previously made detailed arguments about the interference by the
Government of Ecuador in the Lago litigation, and it stands by those, but again, my
comments on the Crude video evidence this afternoon are about the private Plaintiffs’
lawyers and their profit motivated litigation investors.

The question for the Government of Ecuador, once it has had a fair opportunity to
address the emerging evidence, is how it will respond to the evidence. In the Lago
Agrio Court, Chevron's lawyers have lately been fined and threatened with other
sanctions simply for presenting the evidence of fraud on the Tribunal. I note I have
yet to hear from any speaker before this Tribunal any hint of doubt that the Lago
Agrio Court will render a judgment against Chevron, no matter what evidence is
shown to that Court. And, of course, the Government of Ecuador stands to get 90
percent of any judgment in the case. The figure now being sought is $113 billion.

Dr. Garcia states with sincerity that Ecuador has nothing to do with the Lago Agrio
Case, yet Mr. Bloom has submitted in New York just Friday attesting to the existence

Part III — Page 76

3.254

of a common-interest privilege with the Lago Agrio Plantiffs' lawyers since 2006. The
evidence of communication between Winston & Strawn and Steven Donziger is
copious.

A U.S. Federal Magistrate Judge recently stated that any country that does not
recognize what has happened in Lago Agrio as a fraud has bigger problems than an
oil spill.

Chevron eagerly awaits to what the Republic of Ecuador's reaction to the new
evidence may be and whether the Republic believes there is anything that it and
Chevron might constructively do together to address that situation.”

The Tribunal notes that both statements touch generally upon the most important
questions raised by the Parties; namely the Respondent’s legal responsibilities under
the BIT (both by its executive and judicial branches) for events allegedly occurring in
the Lago Agrio litigation in Ecuador. In the Tribunal’s view, these questions impinge
more on the merits of the Parties’ dispute, rather than the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections. It is, however, impossible for the Tribunal to lose sight of both these
statements in addressing the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and the Claimants’

jurisdictional responses.

PART IV: THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISIONS

(A) Introduction

It is appropriate to address in turn the issues raised by each of the Respondent’s

jurisdictional objections in regard to the Claimants’ claims.

For ease of reference below, the Tribunal refers to the 1995 Settlement Agreement
as including the 1998 Acta Final (also called by the Claimants “the 1998 Settlement
and Release Agreement”) and both, together with the Municipal and Provincial
Releases, as included in the generic shorthand term “settlement agreements”. The
1995 Settlement Agreement made with the Respondent lies, of course, at the heart of
the Claimants’ claims against the Respondent, as both an alleged “investment” and
an alleged “investment agreement” under the BIT; and the Tribunal has therefore

concentrated its analysis on that particular settlement agreement.

(B) The Prima Facie Standard

The Parties appear to agree in part upon the general prima facie standard of review
to be applied by the Tribunal to the Claimants’ claims as a matter of jurisdiction; but
they dispute its scope and application to this case. Their respective submissions are
summarised in Part III above and their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing

recorded at D1.115ff and D2.240, 321 & 336.

Part IV — Page 1

47

In the Tribunal’s view, under the BIT and Article 21 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration
Rules, the Tribunal is required to decide in regard to the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections whether or not, if the facts alleged by the Claimants are assumed to be
true, the Claimants’ claims would be capable of constituting breaches of the BIT as
pleaded by the Claimants in their Notice of Arbitration (as later clarified and

confirmed by their Memorial on the Merits).

As regards facts alleged by the Claimants but not admitted or denied by the
Respondent, the Tribunal is required to test the factual basis of the Claimant’s claims
by reference to a prima facie standard. That standard was most clearly expressed by
Judge Higgins in the well-known passage from her separate opinion in Oil
Platforms; and it has been applied since by many arbitration tribunals in addressing

jurisdictional objections made in investor-state arbitrations.'

In short, by that standard, the Tribunal is here required for jurisdictional purposes, at
the early stage of this arbitration (i.e. before the Respondent has pleaded any defence
on the merits, particularly in response to the Claimants’ Memorial on the Merits), to
assume that the facts pleaded by the Claimants in the Notice of Arbitration are true
unless such factual pleading is incredible, frivolous, vexatious or otherwise
advanced by the Claimants in bad faith. Without having heard factual evidence from
both sides (which it has not), the Tribunal cannot here finally determine any issue of
fact disputed by the Parties: the relevant evidence before the Tribunal is materially
incomplete; such evidence as has been adduced is made in writing only, without
being tested orally by cross-examination or questions from the Tribunal to
witnesses; and it has been manifest from the beginning of this arbitration that much

of the Claimants’ factual case is strongly disputed by the Respondent.

The practical difficulty arises from the use of the Latin term “prima facie”. In the
Tribunal’s view, it does not mean, at this early procedural stage, that the Claimants
must satisfy the Tribunal that their case, as now pleaded, would necessarily prevail

on the merits if this arbitration were to proceed beyond the jurisdictional stage. Nor

are collected in Schreuer et al, p. 540 (footnote 121).

can it mean, in a heavily adversarial procedure with both sides here making very
extensive submissions and submitting numerous exhibits, that the Tribunal should
only investigate the apparent surface of the Claimants’ case on the merits. In other
words, the jurisdictional stage of this arbitration cannot take the form of a
preliminary hearing on the merits: but, conversely, the Claimants must establish that

their case is sufficiently serious to proceed to a full hearing on the merits.

The Tribunal specifically rejects as imposing too high a prima facie standard the
Respondent’s submission at the Jurisdiction Hearing that the Claimants must already
have established their case with a 51% chance of success, i.e. on a balance of
probabilities (D2.242); and the Tribunal prefers, to this extent, the Claimants’
submissions that their case should be “decently arguable” or that it has “a reasonable

possibility as pleaded” [D2.321 & 338].

There is another feature of the prima facie standard to which the Respondent’s
Counsel drew attention [D2.243]: it would not be appropriate for the Tribunal here
to found its jurisdiction on any of the Claimants’ claims on the basis of an assumed
fact (alleged by the Claimants but disputed by the Respondent) if that factual issue
was never again to be examined by the Tribunal. In the context of factual issues
which are common to both jurisdictional objections and the merits of the Parties’
dispute, there is of course no like difficulty; but the Tribunal acknowledges the real
difficulty of assuming under the prima facie standard the truth of a disputed fact
unique to a jurisdictional objection which, if jurisdiction were then assumed and
exercised, is never again addressed by the Tribunal during the arbitration

proceedings.

This difficulty was best expressed by Sir Frank Berman in his dissenting opinion in
Lucchetti v Peru’: “It is one thing to say that factual matters can or should be
provisionally accepted at the preliminary phase, because there will be a full
opportunity to put them to the test definitively later on. But if particular facts are a
critical element in the establishment of jurisdiction itself, so that the decision to

accept or to deny jurisdiction disposes of them once and for all for this purpose, how

can it be seriously claimed that those facts should be assumed rather than proved?”
(paragraph 17). The Tribunal agrees with this question’s implicit answer; and, to this

extent, the Tribunal accepts the submission made by the Respondent.

Accordingly, in summary, the Tribunal’s general approach in deciding the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections under the prima facie standard here requires
an assumption of the truth of the relevant facts alleged by the Claimants in the
Notice of Arbitration (subject to the qualifications described above), excluding
however a disputed fact uniquely relevant to the existence or exercise of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction. As to such disputed fact, the Tribunal is required either
finally decide that factual issue here (if it can) or address it later pursuant to Article
21.4 (second sentence) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. As to the actual merits
of the Claimants’ claims or the likely defences of the Respondent, the Tribunal is
required not finally to decide here any legal or factual issues arising thereunder,
including the question whether, even if the Claimants’ alleged facts were proven
true, the Claimants would be entitled under the BIT and the Arbitration Agreement
to the relief claimed by either of them in respect of any of their claims pleaded

against the Respondent.

(C) Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT

The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae under
the BIT because the Parties’ dispute does not arise out of or relate to an
“investment” in Ecuador, for the purposes of Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT. The
Parties’ respective submissions are summarised in Part III above and their oral
submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1.31ff & 119 and D2. 254, 333
& 340.

The Tribunal notes the broad definition of “investment” contained in Article I(1)(a)
of the BIT, listing a wide variety of different forms (‘‘investment’ means every
kind of investment ....”); and Article I(3) also provides that any subsequent alteration

in the form of in which assets are invested or reinvested “shall not affect their

Part IV — Page 4

4.14

4.15

4.16

character as investment.” The BIT imposes no temporal limit on an investment:
Article II(3)(b) confers express protection on the “disposal” of an investment; and
Article II(7) likewise in regard to “effective means of asserting claims and enforcing
rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment
auhorizations”. There is no reason in the wording of this BIT to limit the lifespan of
a covered investment short of its complete and final demise, including the
completion of all means for asserting claims and enforcing rights by the investor or

others in regard to that investment.

TexPet: It is appropriate to consider first the position of TexPet, before considering

Chevron’s separate position.

As alleged by the Claimants, TexPet began its investment in Ecuador in 1964 and
continued its investments under the 1973 Concession Agreement. In the Tribunal’s
view, that investment did not terminate in 1992 (upon that Concession Agreement’s
ending) because there is a close and inextricable link between TexPet’s 1973
Concession Agreement and the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Without the former, the
latter would not have come into existence. It is also plain from the text of both the
1973 Concession Agreement (especially section 46) and the 1995 Settlement
Agreement that the latter must be read with the earlier concession agreement and the
Consortium’s activities thereunder: the 1995 Settlement Agreement cross-refers
repeatedly to the 1973 Concession Agreement: see its Preamble and Articles 1.1,

1.2, 1.12, 5.1, and 5.2.

The Tribunal therefore determines that, for the purpose of applying Article VI(1)(c),
it is not possible to divorce one from the other. To the contrary, it is necessary to
treat the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a continuation of the earlier concession
agreements, so that it forms part of the overall investment invoked by TexPet. The
Tribunal also notes that the BIT’s requirement addresses not a concession agreement
but an investment which can, by its nature and form, precede and (as here) follow
the contractual term of a concession agreement. An investment can undergo several
successive phases not chronologically coterminous with a concession agreement or

concession.

Part IV — Page 5

417

4.18

4.19

4.20

It is also clear to the Tribunal from the complaint in the Lago Agrio litigation that its
principal subject-matter addresses the alleged activities of TexPet under these
concession agreements, with the complaint alleging several breaches of the 1973
Concession Agreement, especially paragraphs IV(7) & IV(9). There is, on the facts
alleged by TexPet, a similar factor linking those concession agreements to the
institution of the Respondent’s criminal proceedings against Chevron’s two lawyers.
As regards the continued existence of TexPet’s investment, that common subject-
matter links the complaint and criminal proceedings not only to these concession
agreements but also to the related 1995 Settlement Agreement between TexPet and

the Respondent.

At this point, in addition to its more traditional form, TexPet’s investment assumes
the forms set out in Article I(1)(a) of the BIT as: “a claim to performance having
economic value, and associated with an investment” and “any right conferred by ...
contract”. In the Tribunal’s view, assuming its case were to prevail, TexPet’s
remedies under the BIT in regard to such forms of investment (given its original
investment) are not limited in this arbitration to compensatory damages for its own
damage but could also include (as a matter of jurisdiction) its declaratory and other
non-compensatory relief as a named signatory party to the 1995 Settlement

Agreement.

Accordingly, applying these interpretations of the BIT, the Tribunal rejects the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections against TexPet’s claims under the BIT in this
arbitration by reference to Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT. TexPet’s investment began in
1964, it includes the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and, with the Lago Agrio

litigation, that investment has not yet reached its complete and final demise.

As a co-claimant in this arbitration, the Tribunal therefore decides that TexPet has
standing (as a matter of jurisdiction) to seek its claimed declaratory, specific
performance, moral damages and other relief against the Respondent, even though
TexPet is not a defendant in the Lago Agro litigation (or a defendant in the criminal
proceedings). As an investor with a covered investment and as a contractual party to
the 1995 Settlement Agreement with the Respondent, TexPet enjoys valuable

economic rights for itself; and its claimed relief can thus include relief advanced

4.21

4.22

4.23

4.24

under Articles I(1)(a)(v), Article II(3)(c), Article I(1)(a)(iii) and Article VI(1)(c) of
the BIT.

The Tribunal has reached this decision on the basis of its interpretation of the BIT’s
wording, together with the facts of this case, both assumed and non-disputed
between the Parties. Having made that decision independently, the Tribunal notes,
however, that its approach regarding the overall life-span of an investment
materially accords with the reasoning of other tribunals in Commercial Cases
Dispute, Saipem v Bangladesh, Mondev v USA, Frontier Petroleum Services v Czech

Republic and White Industries v India.

Chevron: The Tribunal considers that additional considerations arise in regard to
Chevron. Chevron made no investment under any of TexPet’s concession
agreements; it was never a member of the Consortium; it was not a signatory or
named party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and it first appears in this case’s

chronology in 2001 following its “merger” with Texaco.

On these facts alone, the Tribunal would not consider that Chevron could
successfully plead any investment under the BIT for the purpose of establishing this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over its claims in this arbitration; and, if its case stopped
there, this Tribunal might decline jurisdiction over Chevron’s claims under Article
VI(1)(c) - subject only to Chevron’s residual argument that it can still bring its

claims as the indirect owner of TexPet.

In the Tribunal’s view, as TexPet’s parent company, Chevron is a covered investor
under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT because it indirectly owns or controls an
“investment” in Ecuador. It is not disputed that Chevron is a company “of the other
Party” formed in the USA; and Article 1(1)(a) does not require its indirect
investment (i.e. in TexPet and its investment) to be a company formed in Ecuador.
Accordingly, the Tribunal decides, as a matter of jurisdiction, that Chevron can
bring its claims before this Tribunal for an alleged breach of any right conferred or

created by the BIT with respect to its indirect “investment” in TexPet.

Part IV — Page 7

4.25

4.26

4.27

A different issue arises from Chevron’s exposure to the liability to the plaintiffs in
the Lago Agrio litigation. Chevron became TexPet’s parent and thus an investor in
2001 only, long after the events said to give rise to Chevron’s liability and occurring
at a time when Texaco (not Chevron) was TexPet’s parent company.
Notwithstanding their ostensibly distinct legal personalities and corporate histories,
the Lago Agrio litigation appears completely to amalgamate Chevron with Texaco
(for legal reasons which remain unclear to the Tribunal). In that event, Chevron here
submits for jurisdictional purposes that it should be treated by this Tribunal as,
effectively, standing in the shoes of Texaco, as TexPet’s parent company from 1964
onwards, with the same original investment indirectly made and continued by
Texaco. Otherwise, so Chevron submits, the Respondent and the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs could succeed unfairly in “having it both ways”: with Chevron liable in the
Lago Agrio litigation because of the concession/investment made by Texaco &
TexPet but with Chevron not entitled in this arbitration to assert any relief because it

had in fact no such investment/concession at the material time, i.e. before 2001.

The Tribunal declines to cut this Gordian knot at this early stage of these arbitration
proceedings: it will need a much better understanding of the legal reasons why
Chevron is to be treated in the Lago Agrio litigation as a party succeeding to
Texaco’s liabilities which arose before the “merger” in 2001; and it will also need a
clearer understanding of what constituted such “merger” as regards the different and
successive legal relationships between Texaco, TexPet and Chevron before and after
such “merger”, under whatever applicable law or laws, namely the laws of the USA

and/or Ecuadorian law.

Accordingly, for the time being, the Tribunal makes no final decision in regard to
the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection to Chevron’s own claims as a direct
investor under Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, save to join that particular objection to
the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. In addition, the
Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision to treat Chevron as an indirect investor should not
be understood as indicating (one way or the other) that Chevron would be entitled to
all the relief claimed by Chevron in paragraph 547 of the Claimants’ Memorial on
the Merits (cited in Part I above). That is also a matter for the merits phase of this

arbitration.

Res Judicata and Issue Preclusion: Given these decisions, the Tribunal need not
here address the Parties’ respective submissions regarding res judicata or issue
preclusion and the awards in the arbitration known as the Commercial Cases
Dispute. It is unnecessary to decide this question as regards TexPet, given the
Tribunal’s decision in its favour above. As regards Chevron, however, this question
may remain relevant, but for two reasons, the Tribunal declines to decide it here.
First, the answer, even if completely favourable to Chevron, may be legally
irrelevant and leave untouched other issues relevant to Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT;
and, second, in the Tribunal’s view, this question of res judicata raises issues of
Dutch law which are better resolved as part of the merits at a later stage of these
arbitration proceedings. Accordingly, this question of res judicata (with issue
preclusion) is not here decided by the Tribunal but joined to the merits, if and to the

extent relevant, pursuant to Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

Estoppel and Preclusion: Likewise, Chevron’s other submissions based on estoppel,
preclusion and good faith arising from the Respondent’s alleged conduct in regard to
the Lagio Agrio litigation and criminal proceedings are similarly joined to the merits

pursuant to Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

(C) Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT

The Respondent submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae under
the BIT because the Parties’ dispute does not “arise out of or relate to an investment
agreement” between the Respondent and the Claimants, for the purpose of Article
VI(1)(a) of the BIT. The Parties’ respective submissions are summarised in Part IIT
above and their principal oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at
D1.69, 114 & 164. These oral submissions overlap with their submissions under
Article VI(1)(c) of the BIT, given their disputed definition of investment,
particularly as regards Chevron’s alleged investment agreement. The Tribunal notes
at the outset that there is no definition of “investment agreement” in the BIT. It is

again appropriate consider separately the positions of TexPet and Chevron.

Part IV — Page 9

431

4.32

4.34

TexPet: In the Tribunal’s view, the 1973 Concession Agreement was an “investment
agreement” within the meaning of Article VI(1(a) of the BIT. TexPet, as a named
party to this agreement with the Respondent, made investments in Ecuador, as both
alleged by the Claimants and indeed acknowledged by the Respondent (Memorial on
Jurisdiction, paragraph 47).

In the Tribunal’s view, having already decided above upon the broad interpretation
of “investment” under Article I(1)(a) of the BIT, there is an inextricable link
between the 1973 Concession Agreement and the 1995 Settlement Agreement, to
which TexPet and the Respondent were named and signatory parties. Again, the
latter would not have come into existence without the former; and, accordingly, the
Tribunal similarly determines that, for the purpose of applying Article VI(1)(a), it is
not possible to divorce one from the other. In the Tribunal’s view, the 1995
Settlement Agreement must be treated as a continuation of the earlier concession
agreement, so that it also forms part of the overall “investment agreement” invoked

by TexPet under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT.

The Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s argument that the 1995 Settlement Agreement
came too long after the expiry of the 1973 Concession Agreement, some three years
later (in 1992). In the Tribunal’s view, there could be no doubt that if the 1995
Settlement Agreement had been made during the contractual term of the 1973
Concession Agreement (say in 1975), it could only have been regarded as an
elaboration of that agreement and thus clearly forming part of one overall investment
agreement. A long term oil concession must inevitably involve extensive clean-up
costs and related responsibilities to others for the environmental consequences of its
activities, particularly at or after the end of such activities. It is also well known
scientifically that the consequences of environmental pollution caused by oil
production are generally measured over many years, if not several decades. As the
Claimants’ Counsel rightly submitted at the Jurisdictional Hearing: “Environmental

remediation is a normal and natural part of an oil concession project” (D1.129).

The Tribunal therefore dismisses any chronological distinction between remedial

agreements made the day before and the day after the expiry of a concession

Part IV — Page 10

4.35

4.36

437

agreement; and there is equally no logical reason to treat differently a much longer
period after the concession’s agreement expiry, so long as the same link remains

between them (as is the case here).

Moreover, the requirement for an “investment dispute” under Article VI(1)(a) of the
BIT (which introduces the Arbitration Agreement) is broadly defined to mean a
dispute “arising out of or relating to” an investment agreement. In the Tribunal’s
view, such wording would not limit an investment dispute to one only arising under
a particular investment agreement but would include a wider range of disputes
“relating to” the investment agreement. In the Tribunal’s view, TexPet’s claims
under the BIT do “relate” to the 1973 Concession Agreement, even if (contrary to
the Tribunal’s decision above) the 1973 Concession Agreement were to be isolated
from the 1995 Settlement Agreement and the Parties’ dispute did not arise under or

even “out of” that concession agreement at all.

On the other hand, the Tribunal is not minded to treat the 1995 Settlement
Agreement, by itself or (in the Claimants’ phrase) free-standing, as an “investment
agreement” under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. It was of course an “agreement”
whereby TexPet in fact incurred substantial expenditure and paid significant monies
to actual and putative claimants in Ecuador; but TexPet’s activities thereunder
cannot fairly be described, by themselves, as having been made as an “investment”.
These activities were, as rightly submitted by the Respondent, performed by way of
amicable settlements for past actual or alleged wrongs and not for investment
purposes. Accordingly, standing alone, the Tribunal rejects the 1995 Settlement
Agreement as founding its jurisdiction; and it is only when that 1995 Settlement is
considered along with the 1973 Concession Agreement that it forms part of an
“investment agreement” under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT. In arriving at this
decision, the Tribunal found little assistance (either way) from the Parties’ different

submissions regarding the USA’s treaty practices and related doctrinal writings.

On the basis that TexPet’s dispute with the Respondent under the BIT relates to an
investment agreement, consisting of the 1973 Concession Agreement either by itself
or together with the 1995 Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal rejects the

Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT as regards

Part IV — Page 11

4.38

4.39

4.40

TexPet’s claims in this arbitration. In particular, the Tribunal does not consider that
TexPet’s claims relating to the 1995 Settlement Agreement under the BIT and
international law are barred by Ecuadorian law as a matter of jurisdiction; e.g.

Article 1465 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (also “CC”).

Chevron: In the Tribunal’s view, additional considerations again apply to Chevron,
because it was not a party to any concession agreement; and it was not a named or
signatory party in the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Indeed, Chevron was not a
named or signatory party to any contractual agreement made with the Respondent

before the commencement of these arbitration proceedings.

The first issue is whether Chevron, under Article VI(1)(a) of the BIT, can assert
contractual rights against the Respondent as a “Releasee” under Article 5.1 of the
1995 Settlement Agreement. There is no provision in the 1995 Settlement
Agreement regarding its applicable law or its authoritative language (as between its
English and Spanish versions); and Article 9.3 contains a “whole contract”
provision. The Tribunal also notes that Article 9.6 provides that the 1995 Settlement

Agreement substitutes and voids the 1994 MOU.

The Tribunal does not consider that this first issue is answered by the mere fact that
Chevron was not a contractual party to the 1995 Settlement Agreement at the time
when it was signed by TexPet and the Respondent. In the Tribunal’s view, as
considered above, the broad language of Article VI(1) of the BIT (‘relating to”)
does not require such original contractual privity between Chevron and the
Respondent; and moreover the term “between” in Article VI(1)(a) cannot be
interpreted as requiring Chevron to be an actual signatory or named party to the
investment agreement. However, the Tribunal does consider that Article VI of the
BIT requires Chevron to be entitled to assert contractual or other legal rights against
the Respondent under the 1995 Settlement Agreement as a “Releasee”. The Parties’
experts on Ecuadorian law agree that a “Releasee” can enforce the 1995 Settlement
Agreement (by its terms and Article 1465 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code); and the
question is therefore whether or not Chevron became such a Releasee in or after its

“merger” with Texaco in 2001.

Part IV — Page 12

441

442

4.43

4.44

The English version of Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement contains a long
list of persons described as “‘Releasees”, including TexPet’s and Texaco’s respective
“successors” and “principals and subsidiaries”. The latter term appears to relate to an
agency relationship; and it does not thus self-evidently describe, in the Tribunal’s
view, Chevron as TexPet’s later parent. The former term (“successors”) might be
more apt depending upon Chevron’s “merger” with Texaco; but that is not a
submission apparently made by Chevron, perhaps for reasons associated with the
Lago Agrio litigation [D1.207 & D2.289]. The Tribunal notes that this contractual
list does not expressly include parent or associated companies, although TexPet’s
then parent company (Texaco) was expressly included amongst the named

Releasees.

Given its centre of gravity, for present purposes, the Tribunal here relies principally
upon the Spanish text and Ecuadorian law, as submitted by the Parties. The question
of this text’s contractual interpretation was addressed in written reports by the
Parties’ respective legal experts on Ecuadorian law: Dr Barros and Dr Coronel for

the Claimants and Dr Salgado for the Respondent.

The Parties’ experts there closely examined the precise meaning of the Spanish word
“principales” in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. Dr Barros and Dr
Coronel support the Claimants’ submissions, to the effect that “principales” means
parent company (See Dr Barros’ second report; and Dr Coronel’s second report).
With that interpretation, since Chevron has indirectly owned and controlled TexPet
since 2001, Chevron would therefore be a “Releasee”, contractually and legally
entitled to seek declaratory and other relief against the Respondent under the 1995

Settlement Agreement.

Dr Barros’ report (paragraphs. 23-35) also places special emphasis on the fact that
the terms “principales y subsidiarias” are used in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement
Agreement. Dr. Barros expresses the opinion that in such a context “principales”
does not refer to the principal-agent relationship under the law of agency, but to the
parent or controlling company/subsidiary relationship under company law. Amongst
other factors, Dr. Barros indicates that: (i) if the signatory parties had wished to use

the term “principales” according to the meaning to be assigned to such a term in an

Part IV — Page 13

agency relationship (“principal” or “mandante”), they would have mentioned it
together with the term “agents” (“‘agentes” or “mandatarios”) in Article 5.1 - which
significantly was not the case (paragraph 26 of Dr. Barros’ report); and (ii) a
harmonious and good faith interpretation of the 1995 Settlement Agreement
militates against construing the release as only covering companies or persons in the
ownership structure (including TexPet), as such structure then existed and not also
companies or persons that were to come into the structure at a later date (paragraphs
31 & 33 of the Barros report). Dr Barros points out that a contrary interpretation of
Article 5.1 would mean that TexPet’s officers when the release was signed would be
covered as Releasees but not TexPet’s future officers who could be still be exposed

to liabilities; and that such reading does not make any sense (paragraph 29).

4.45 This interpretation is supported by Dr Coronel’s report. Dr Coronel also expresses
the opinion that with the parties’ use of the words “principales” and “subsidiarias”
together, Article 5.1 should be read to mean that companies above and below those
mentioned by name in this provision are to be covered by the release (paragraph 19).
Dr. Coronel also refers specifically to Article 1465 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code?
and also Article 1562 CC’, Article 1576 CC°, Article 1578 CC®, Article 1580 CC’
(paragraphs 11-150).

4.46 By relying upon Articles 1576 CC and 1580 CC, Dr. Coronel states that a joint

reading of the definition of “release” (“liberacién”) found at Articles 1.12 and 5.1

> “Cualquiera puede estipular a favor de una tercera persona, aunque no tenga derecho para representarla;
pero s6lo esa tercera persona podrd demander lo estipulado; y mientras no intervenga su aceptacidn expresa o
tdcita, es revocable el contrato por la sola voluntad de las partes que concurrieron a él. Constituyen aceptacién
tdcita los actos que sélo hubieran podido ejecutarse en virtud del contrato”.

* “Los contratos deben ejecutarse de buena fe, y por consiguiente obligan, no sélo a lo que en ellos se expresa,
sino a todas las cosas que emanan precisamente de la naturaleza de la obligacién, 0 que, por la ley 0
costumbre, pertenecen a ella”.

5 “Conocida claramente la intencién de los contratantes debe estarse a ella mas que a lo literal de las
palabras”.

° “El sentido en que una cldusula puede surtir algun efecto debera preferirse a aquél en que no sea capaz de
surtir efecto alguno”.

7 “Las cldusulas de un contrato se interpretaran unas por otras, ddndose a cada una el sentido que mejor
convenga al contrato en su totalidad. Podrdn también interpretarse por las de otro contrato entre las mismas
partes y sobre la misma materia. O por la aplicacién practica que hayan hecho de ella ambas partes, o una de
las partes con aprobaci6én de la otra”.

Part IV — Page 14

447

4.48

of the 1995 Settlement Agreement confirms the intention of the parties not only to
release TexPet but also “all persons and entities related to TexPet “ (paragraph 20).
The main thrust of his opinion seems to be that Article 1.12 broadly extends the
release to all legal and contractual obligations and responsibility vis-a-vis the
Respondent and PetroEcuador resulting from the consortium’s operations and
relating to the environment (not limited to TexPet), and that the broad list of related
entities covered by Article 5.1 evinces the parties’ intention to extend the release to
companies or entities or persons not there expressly mentioned or identified by

name.

In particular, Dr Coronel states that: (a) the release covers Texaco, then the indirect
owning and controlling company of TexPet, which means that it must also extend to
companies becoming in the future the indirect owning and controlling companies of
TexPet (i.e. Chevron); and (b) the reference to “successors” in Article 5.1 indicates
that companies not expressly listed by name in its text could still benefit legally from
the release. Dr Coronel states that when the 1995 Settlement Agreement was made,
it was impossible for the signatory parties to know or even predict that Chevron (or
anybody else) would become the owning and controlling company of TexPet. Since
the highest parent corporation at that time was expressly covered by the release, a
logical and good faith reading of this provision requires its coverage to any future
company replacing Texaco as TexPet’s parent (paragraph 20). In that sense (and
only in that sense), Chevron is a “successor” of Texaco; i.e., Texaco was replaced
with Chevron as the indirect owning and controlling shareholder of TexPet within

the meaning of Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

Neither Dr Barros’ report nor Dr Coronel’s report denies that the Spanish term
“principales” outside the specific context in which such term is used in Article 5.1
and within the context of an agency relationship means “principal” or “mandante”.
In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the Diccionario de la Real Academia
Espafiola defines “principal” as follows: (i) 19th Edition (1970): “For. El que da
poder a otro para que lo represente, poderdante”; and (ii) 22nd (last) Edition (2001):
“Der. Poderdante” [i.e., within a legal context - this is what the references For. or

Der. stand for]. “Principal” means who grants a power of attorney in fact.”

Part IV — Page 15

4.49

4.50

451

On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that examples in which such term has been
used in the context of general company or corporate law in Ecuador are very
exceptional, as shown in the report of the Respondent’s legal expert, Dr. Roberto
Salgado Valdez (the “Salgado report”). However, the Salgado report does not go
further than addressing the usual legal meaning of the term “principal”. It does not
analyse the question of what exactly the signatory parties themselves objectively
intended by their use of that term in Article 5.1 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement;
and the Tribunal has not been shown any legal materials refuting the possibility of
the contextual interpretation advanced in the Barros and Coronel reports based upon
such intention. Although the Respondent disputes these experts’ interpretation, it
appears to rely only upon its own reading of the meaning only of “principales” out
of context.* The Salgado report limits itself to denying the Claimants’ interpretation
in only one paragraph (paragraph 20), exclusively on the basis of the isolated
meaning of “principal” (with no context) and without analysing the reasoning in the

Coronel report or the Barros report.

The Tribunal notes that, although clause VIII of the 1994 MOU provides that its
stipulations do not limit third-party rights arising out of the operations of the
Consortium, Article 9.6 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement clearly provides that it
substitutes and voids the MOU. Further, Article 5.1 of the Settlement Agreement
does grant releases to third parties not specifically identified by name which is
incompatible, on its face, with clause VIII of the 1994 MOU. These circumstances
militate in favour of not assigning interpretative weight to the MOU when

interpreting the 1995 Settlement Agreement.

The Tribunal also notes that Article 9.4 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement provides
that it shall not be construed to confer any benefit on any “third party not a Party to
this Contract”, nor grant any rights to “such third party” to enforce its provisions.”

The term “Party” excludes Chevron as a non-signatory party. This significant

provision was of course much invoked by the Respondent. Indeed, the Tribunal
considers that, if Chevron were not a Releasee, Chevron must be treated as a third
party which is not legally entitled to claim any benefit under the 1995 Settlement
Agreement or to enforce its provisions against the Respondent. If Chevron were,
however, a “Releasee” (as the Claimants submit), the question arises whether
Chevron is a “third party” at all. The Claimants contend that Article 5.1 effectively
grants benefits to parties which are not named or signatory parties and that Article
9.4 should be interpreted harmoniously with Article 5.1 so as to avoid making the
releases meaningless. The Tribunal, whilst not finally deciding this question,
considers that the Claimants’ answer is sufficiently serious to require further

consideration at the merits phase of this arbitration.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that Dr Salgado acknowledges that the meaning of
Article 5.1 depends ultimately on the intention of the signatory parties, here TexPet
and the Respondent. This approach appears to accord with the approach taken by Dr
Barros and Dr Coronel. In the Tribunal’s view, those parties’ objective intention
may therefore provide the answer to this important question; but, again, it is not a
question which the Tribunal can properly answer at this early stage of this
arbitration, not without affording to the Respondent the requisite opportunity to
adduce relevant and admissible evidence as to such an objective intention. (The
Tribunal has noted, as earlier indicated, the “Whole Contract” provision in Article

9.3 of the 1995 Settlement Agreement).

In summary, applying the prima facie standard described above, the Tribunal
decides for present purposes that the Claimants’ interpretation, supported by two
legal experts, is at least “serious”; but the Tribunal does not otherwise here finally
decide the question one way or the other. Given that this question is a mixed
question relevant both to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection under Article
VI(1)(a) of the BIT and the merits of Chevron’s claim relating to the 1995
Settlement Agreement, the Tribunal decides to join the Respondent’s objection to

the merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

Res Judicata, Issue Preclusion and Estoppel: As with Article VI(1)(c) above, the

Tribunal considers it inappropriate here to decide these questions under Article

Part IV — Page 17

4.55

4.56

457

4.58

VI(1)(a) of the BIT. Similarly, it joins these issues, if and insofar as they may remain
relevant to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to Chevron’s claims, to the

merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

(D) No Prima Facie Case

The Respondent next submits that this Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae
under the BIT because the Claimants have no prima facie case on the merits of their
claims. The Parties’ respective submissions are summarised in Part III above and in

several parts of their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing.

Applying the standard of review described above, the Tribunal specifically rejects
this separate jurisdictional objection. Given that this arbitration will now proceed
further in regard to the respective merits of the Parties’ dispute and that the
Respondent has yet had no opportunity to plead its defence on the merits, it is

appropriate for the Tribunal here to add very little.

There is no doubt in the Tribunal’s mind that the allegations pleaded by the
Claimants against the Respondent rank amongst the gravest accusations which can
be advanced by a claimant against a modern State subject to the rule of law. There is
equally no doubt that these allegations are deeply offensive and repellent to the
Respondent. The Tribunal refers to the opening statements made respectively by
Chevron’s General Counsel and the Respondent’s Attorney-General, set out above

in Part III of this Award.

The Claimants’ allegations may be completely false or completely true. As yet, the
Tribunal has formed no concluded view on any these contested allegations one way
or the other. Its decision in this Award is limited to the required application of the
prima facie standard under the BIT and Arbitration Agreement to the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections; and for this limited purpose it has concluded that the
Claimants’ pleaded case is serious and not advanced in bad faith; nor is its case

incredible, frivolous or vexatious.

(E) Third Party Rights and Monetary Gold

The Parties’ respective submissions are summarised above in Part III of this Award
and their oral submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1.101 & 227 and

D2.262 & 353.

Under international law, the Monetary Gold principle articulated by the International
Court of Justice stipulates, in essence, that although a tribunal may have jurisdiction
over a dispute it must not or should not exercise that jurisdiction if the very subject-
matter of the decision would determine the rights and obligations of a State which is
not a party to the proceedings. There is disagreement between the Parties concerning
the applicability of the principle to mixed (State/Non-State) arbitrations under
bilateral investment treaties and to circumstances in which a tribunal adjudicating
upon the liability of a State may have to consider matters that are the subject of
litigation between private persons. The Tribunal does not, however, have to decide
that disagreement, because it considers that even if the Monetary Gold principle
should be applicable in this arbitration it would not operate so as to prevent the
Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute. The following
paragraphs explain the Tribunal’s reasoning, assuming (for the sake of argument)

that the principle should be applicable here.

As the Parties to the present dispute have recognized, the Monetary Gold principle
draws its strength from, and implements, a number of distinct and fundamental
principles of international law. Most obviously, it gives effect to the principle that no
international tribunal may exercise jurisdiction over a State without the consent of
that State; and, by analogy, no arbitration tribunal has jurisdiction over any person
unless they have consented. That may be called the ‘consent’ principle, and it goes

to the question of the tribunal’s jurisdiction.

In the Monetary Gold case itself, the International Court of Justice held that, as a

corollary of the ‘consent’ principle, if the very subject-matter of the case that it has

Part IV — Page 19

4.63

4.64

4.65

4.66

to decide is a question of the rights of a State not before it, the International Court
cannot proceed to decide that case. In such a case, the Court would not hear full
argument on the rights in question. That corollary may be called the ‘indispensible
third party’ principle; and it goes to the question of the ability of the tribunal to

decide the case justly and according to law.

There is also a concern that the rights of States should not be ruled upon unless they
are properly before the Court and are given a full opportunity to present their case.
This third aspect may be called the ‘due process’ principle; and it goes to the

question of the rights of the absent third party.

All three aspects of the Monetary Gold principle are reflected in the submissions of
the Parties to this Tribunal. The Lago Agrio litigation has, as a central issue, the
question of the legal effect (if any) of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. That is also a
question before this Tribunal; but the Lago Agrio plaintiffs are not named parties to
these arbitration proceedings. Assuming, for the sake of argument, that the Monetary
Gold principle applies to the present arbitration, all three of its aspects need to be

considered.

First, the ‘consent’ principle: it is clear that this Tribunal does not have jurisdiction
over the Lago Agrio plaintiffs themselves. That is the case both in the context of
applications for interim measures and in the context of any further proceedings on
the merits in this arbitration. One consequence is that the Tribunal has no legal
authority over the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and cannot order them to do or to abstain
from doing anything. At most, the Tribunal could request the Lago Agrio plaintiffs
to follow a certain course of action. On the other hand, the Tribunal does have
jurisdiction over Chevron and TexPet as Co-Claimants and also (subject to its
jurisdictional objections) over the Respondent in this arbitration, under the

Arbitration Agreement.

Second, the ‘indispensible third party’ principle. This is more complicated. A
decision that the 1995 Settlement Agreement releases Chevron and TexPet from all
liability in respect of environmental harm in Ecuador would appear to entail the

conclusion that the Lago Agrio plaintiffs could not succeed in their litigation against

Part IV — Page 20

4.67

4.68

Chevron in respect of environmental harm in Ecuador. Indeed, this Tribunal is
formally requested, in the Claimants’ prayer for relief (cited in Part I above), to
make a series of decisions that are explicitly or implicitly premised upon a particular
view of the legal effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement. In that sense, if there
were a decision by the Tribunal in this arbitration that the 1995 Settlement
Agreement releases Chevron from all liability, that might be said to decide the legal
rights of the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. But that is something that depends upon the form
and content of the decision of this Tribunal: it is not an inevitable consequence of
the Tribunal exercising its jurisdiction. The question of form and content of the

decision is a matter to be addressed during the merits phase of this case.

It is clear that this Tribunal has only to decide upon questions of the Respondent’s
liability to the Claimants under the BIT. In so far as it is relevant to the Monetary
Gold point, the question for this Tribunal is whether the Respondent is, by virtue of
that treaty, under an obligation to the Claimants to act so as to uphold the efficacy of
the terms of the 1995 Settlement Agreement, as those terms are interpreted by the
Claimants. It may be that the answer to that question is that the Respondent is indeed
under such an obligation; and that the decisions of the Ecuadorian Courts are
incompatible with that obligation. But that answer would not decide the question of
the effect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement as between the Lago Agrio plaintiffs
and Chevron. If there were an inconsistency between the Respondent’s obligations
under the BIT and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs’ rights as determined by the Courts in
Ecuador, it would be for the Respondent to decide how to resolve that inconsistency.
On this analysis, the Lago Agrio plaintiffs cannot here be regarded as indispensible
third parties; and this case can properly proceed to the merits of the Claimants’

claims without them.

Third, the ‘due process’ principle: it is possible that even though the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs may not be indispensible third parties to this arbitration, a decision by this
Tribunal may nonetheless have a significant effect upon their legal rights and
interests. The question therefore arises of the extent to which the principle of due
process, in relation to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, may be brought to bear in this

context by the Respondent in this arbitration.

Part IV — Page 21

4.69

4.70

471

At this stage, the question is to be answered in the context of the Respondent’s
objection to jurisdiction. It is, moreover, a question to be answered in the light of the
rights of due process possessed by the Parties to this arbitration. Due process is a
principle that bears, at least primarily, upon the manner in which jurisdiction is
exercised by a tribunal, rather than upon the very existence of that jurisdiction. It is
not necessary for this Tribunal to decide if there is a theoretical possibility that due
process rights of a third party, not a party to the proceedings and not subject to the
jurisdiction ratione personae of an arbitral tribunal, might in some extraordinary case
be argued to operate so as to deprive persons who undoubtedly are parties to the
proceedings and within the jurisdiction ratione personae of the tribunal of their right

to a hearing and to due process. That is plainly not the case here.

The question for this Tribunal is in essence whether the Respondent has or has not
violated rights of the Claimants under the BIT because of the way in which the
Respondent has, through its organs, acted in relation to the settlement agreements.

The question is one of the rights and obligations existing between the Claimants and

  

the Respondent; and the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, who are not parties to the settlement
agreements or to the BIT, do not have rights that are directly engaged by that
question. If it should transpire that the Respondent has, by concluding the Release
Agreements, taken a step which had the legal effect of depriving the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs of rights under Ecuadorian Law that they might otherwise have enjoyed,
that would be a matter between them and the Respondent, and not a matter for this

Tribunal.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides to reject this part of the Respondent’s objections

based upon Third Party Rights.

(F) Fork in the Road

The BIT’s fork in the road provision appears in Article VI(3) of the BIT, the
material parts of which are set out in Part II above. The Parties’ respective
submissions are summarised in Part III above and their oral submissions at the

Jurisdiction Hearing recorded at D1.86 & 184 and D2. 294.

The question is whether “the dispute” submitted to this Tribunal has already been
submitted to the national courts of Ecuador or New York so as to trigger the fork in
the road provision in Article VI(3). There is no suggestion that the Parties have

agreed to any other settlement procedure under Article VI(2)(b) of the BIT.

In the Tribunal’s view, “the dispute” in this context must mean “the same dispute”:
it is not suggested that the submission of a different dispute between the Claimants
and the Respondent could trigger the fork in the road provision in relation to the
Parties’ dispute before this Tribunal. Plainly, what is literally one and the same
dispute cannot be before two tribunals simultaneously. ‘Sameness’ must refer to
material identity or sameness determined in the context of a fork in the road
provision. The question is therefore: what is required to establish this particular

‘sameness’?

Tribunals in earlier investment cases have applied a ‘triple identity’ test, requiring
that in the dispute before the domestic courts and the dispute before the arbitration
tribunal there should be identity of the parties, of the object, and of the cause of
action. In the present case, there is no identity of parties, of object or of cause of
action between the Lago Agrio litigation or, indeed, in the Aguinda litigation in the

New York Courts.

It is unlikely that the triple identity test will be satisfied in many cases where a
dispute before a tribunal against a State under a BIT and based upon an alleged

breach of the BIT is compared with a dispute in a national court. National legal

Part IV — Page 23

477

4.78

4.79

4.80

systems do not commonly provide for the State to be sued in respect of a breach of
treaty as such, even though actions for breach of a national law giving effect to a
treaty might be possible. A strict application of the triple identity test would deprive

the fork in the road provision of all or most of its practical effect.

The triple identity test was developed to address questions of res judicata and to
identify specific issues that have already been determined by a competent tribunal. It
has also been applied to similar questions arising in the broadly comparable context
of lis pendens. It is not clear that the triple identity test should be applied here in
order to determine if it is the same ‘dispute’ that is being submitted to national
courts and to the arbitration tribunal. It is, however, not necessary for the Tribunal to
decide this question, because there is a more fundamental point arising from the

wording of the BIT itself.

The short answer to the fork in the road issue in the present case is that the fork is
stated by Article VI(3)(a) of the BIT to be inapplicable if the “national or company
concerned has not submitted the dispute for resolution.” Those words require that,
for the fork to be applied, not only must the dispute have been submitted for
resolution but also that the dispute was submitted by the “national or company

concerned” for resolution in the national courts.

In this case, the dispute before the Courts of Ecuador was not submitted by the
Claimants but by the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. One Claimant (Chevron) before the
arbitration tribunal is the defendant before the Courts of Ecuador. The other
(TexPet) is not a party to the Lago Agrio litigation at all. Whatever might be the
position in respect of differently-worded fork in the road provisions in other BITs, it
is clear that the Claimants in this case have not themselves submitted the dispute
before this Tribunal to any other court or tribunal. The same reasoning applies to the
legal proceedings before the New York Courts, even if a submission to those Courts
could trigger the BIT’s fork in the road provision at all (as opposed to its

continuation before the Ecuadorian Courts, as submitted by the Respondent).

That is a sufficient answer to the fork in the road issue, but only within its own

limits; i.e., only insofar as it is true that the Claimants have not themselves submitted

Part IV — Page 24

4.81

4.82

4.83

4.84

the dispute to the Courts of Ecuador or New York. It is arguable that if some part of
the dispute before this Tribunal were to have been submitted to the national courts,
for example by way of a counterclaim, that part of the dispute would be subject to

the fork in the road provision.

It is the Claimant’s prayer for relief in the Lago Agrio litigation that must be
scrutinised and compared to the Claimants’ claims pleaded in this arbitration (as to
the merits) in order to determine whether the former contains any elements that have
the character of counterclaims or which are for some other reason exceptions to the
observation that the Claimants have not themselves submitted that dispute to the
Ecuadorian Courts. In this arbitration, the Claimants’ prayer for relief is set out in
paragraph 547 of the Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits, which is recited in full in

Part I above.

The request in subparagraph | of paragraph 547 for a declaration that the Claimants
have no liability or responsibility for environmental impact certainly corresponds to
the defence raised in the Lago Agrio litigation. The raising of a plea in defence to a
claim in the national courts, however, cannot properly be described as the
submission of a dispute for settlement in those courts. The notion of ‘submission’ of
a dispute connotes the making of a choice and a voluntary decision to refer the
dispute to the court for resolution: as a matter of the plain and ordinary meaning of
the term, it does not extend to the raising of a defence in response to another’s claim

submitted to that court.

The request in subparagraph 2 for a declaration that the Respondent has breached the
BIT is not a matter before the national courts; nor (obviously) is the request in
subparagraph 3 for a declaration that under the BIT and international law Chevron is
not liable for any judgment rendered in the Lago Agrio litigation; nor the request in
subparagraph 4 for a declaration that any judgment rendered against Chevron in that

litigation is not final, conclusive or enforceable.

The request in subparagraph 5 for a declaration that the Respondent or PetroEcuador
(or the Respondent and PetroEcuador jointly) are exclusively liable for any

judgment rendered in the Lago Agrio litigation is, if strictly construed, a request

Part IV — Page 25

4.85

4.86

4.87

4.88

4.89

relating not to the substantive rights and duties in issue in the Courts of Ecuador but
a request relating to the distinct duties that the Respondent and Petroecuador would

have in respect of any judgment in the Lago Agrio litigation.

It might be said that in effect this request invites the Tribunal to decide that the
Respondent and/or PetroEcuador are liable for any environmental damage. That is a
request that might be said to go beyond the simple defensive plea that Chevron (and
TexPet) is (or are) not liable for any such damage. It might also be said to be a
question that could be answered, at least impliedly, by the Lago Agrio Court’s ruling
on Chevron’s defence based on the settlement agreements. It would, however, be a
triumph of form over substance if this request in subparagraph 5, which is the direct
corollary of the plea of non-liability under the 1995 Settlement Agreement at the
heart of the Claimants' defence in the Lago Agrio litigation, were to be regarded as a
dispute that had been submitted to the Courts of Ecuador by the Claimants, thus
triggering the fork in the road provision. The Tribunal does not therefore take this

formalistic approach to the Claimants’ pleading in this arbitration.

It is unnecessary to deal in detail with the requests in subparagraphs 6 — 12, which

are patently not matters that the Claimants have submitted to the Ecuadorian Courts.

The request in subparagraph 13 for the recovery of the costs of defending the Lago
Agrio litigation and seeks recovery of costs from the Respondent in this case, not
from the Lago Agrio plaintiffs. Plainly, those costs cannot be recovered twice: but
while further developments in the Lago Agrio litigation might affect the amount of

any claim, they do not affect its admissibility in this arbitration.

The request in subparagraph 14 does not duplicate any claim in the Lago Agrio

litigation; and nor do the requests in subparagraphs 15 and 16.
The Tribunal decides accordingly to reject the Respondent’s case that the Claimants’

claims before this Tribunal are precluded by the fork in the road provision in Article

VI((3) of the BIT.

Part IV — Page 26

(G) Admissibility

The Tribunal has generally subsumed under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules the
Respondent’s objections as to the admissibility of the Claimants with its
jurisdictional objections; and it is not therefore necessary to address them here

separately, save for the following specific objections considered below.

Generally, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s objections to the
admissibility of the Claimants’ claims, where not amounting to or overlapping with
its jurisdictional objections, should be treated under Articles 15 and 21 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules as issues relating to the merits phase of these
arbitration proceedings. The UNCITRAL Rules do not contain any provision
equivalent to ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5). An objection to the admissibility of a
claim does not, of course, impugn the jurisdiction of a tribunal over the disputing
parties and their dispute; to the contrary, it necessarily assumes the existence of such
jurisdiction; and it only objects to the tribunal’s exercise of such jurisdiction in
deciding the merits of a claim beyond a preliminary objection. Under the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, that is an exercise belonging to the merits phase of

the arbitration, to be decided by one or more awards on the merits.

The Respondent submits that material damage is essential to the Claimants’ claims
under the BIT in respect of the 1995 Settlement Agreement; and that, in the oral
submission of the Respondent’s Counsel at the jurisdiction hearing: “... unless and
until the Claimants are found liable to the Lago Agrio plaintiffs in a judgment not
subject to appeal, there is no claim before this Tribunal that is ripe for adjudication”

[D1.65].

In the Tribunal’s view, this submission is mistaken as regards the Claimants’ claims
for non-compensatory relief under the BIT; and it is also mistaken as a matter of
legal principle as regards the claim for moral damages (see Article 31(2) of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility: “Injury includes any damage, whether material or

moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State”). As regards the

Part IV — Page 27

4.94

4.95

4.96

4.97

Claimants’ other claims for compensatory relief, it relates to the merits of the
Parties’ dispute because the Claimants’ claims for damages are based upon injuries
alleged caused by the Respondent’s existing acts and omissions in breach of the BIT
and are not exclusively dependent upon the eventual and final outcome of the Lago

Agrio litigation.

As to the Respondent’s related application to stay these arbitration proceedings
“until the Lago Agrio judgment is handed down and appeal’s been heard” [D1.67],
the Respondent later acknowledged (rightly so, in the Tribunal’s view) that the
Tribunal could proceed with its decisions on jurisdiction as a matter of discretion
under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules (D2.253). Subsequent events have also

made the Respondent’s application otiose.

(H) Conclusion

TexPet: In conclusion, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal here decides, as
regards TexPet’s claims, to reject all objections made by the Respondent as to

jurisdiction and admissibility.

Chevron: As to Chevron, the Tribunal decides to reject all objections made by the
Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility in regard to Chevron’s indirect
investment (as TexPet’s parent company owning and controlling TexPet) under
Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the BIT; the Tribunal decides to join to the
merits under Article 21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules the objections made
the Respondent as to jurisdiction in regard to Chevron’s direct investment under
Articles I(1)(a), VI(1)(a) and VI(1)(c) of the BIT; and it decides to reject all other

objections as to jurisdiction and admissibility made by the Respondent.
Costs: Given that these arbitration proceedings will now proceed further to the

merits phase, the Tribunal decides that it would be inappropriate to make any

decision as to costs claimed by the Parties in their respective claims for jurisdictional

Part IV — Page 28

4.98

relief (set out in Part III above); and that such costs should be decided in a later

order or award by the Tribunal.

Jurisdictional Relief: In these circumstances, it follows that the jurisdictional relief
claimed by the Respondent is dismissed (save for its claim for costs to be deferred);
and that the Claimants’ claim for jurisdictional relief (save for their claims for costs

to be likewise deferred) is granted to the extent decided above.

PART V: THE OPERATIVE PART

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal here decides as a third interim
award:

The Tribunal declares that it has jurisdiction to proceed to the merits phase of
these arbitration proceedings with the claims pleaded in the Claimant’s Notice
of Arbitration dated 23 September 2009, subject to the following sub-
paragraphs;

A regards the claims pleaded by the Second Claimant (Texaco Petroleum
Company or “TexPet’’) in the Claimants’ said Notice of Arbitration, to reject
all objections made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility by its
Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility dated 26 July 2010, its Reply
Memorial on Jurisdiction Objections dated 6 October 2010 and its further
submissions at the Jurisdiction Hearing on 22 and 23 November 2010;

As regards the claims pleaded by the First Claimant (Chevron Corporation or
“Chevron’”) in the Claimants’ said Notice of Arbitration, to reject all objections
made by the Respondent as to jurisdiction and admissibility in its said
memorials and further submissions, save those relating to the jurisdictional
objections raised against the First Claimant as a investor under Article I(1)(a)
alleging a “direct” investment under Article VI(1)(c) and an “investment
agreement” under Article VI(1)(a) of the Ecuador-USA Treaty of 27 August
1993 which are joined to the merits of the First Claimants’ claims under Article
21(4) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules forming part of the Parties’
arbitration agreement under the Treaty; and

As regards the Parties’ respective claims for costs, the Tribunal here makes no

order save to reserve in full its jurisdiction and powers to decide such claims by
a later order or award in these arbitration proceedings.
