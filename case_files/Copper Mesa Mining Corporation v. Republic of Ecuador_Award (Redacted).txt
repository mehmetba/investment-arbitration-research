B: The Arbitration Agreement

1.7.

The terms of the arbitration agreement invoked by the Claimant are contained in
Article XIII of the “Agreement between the Government of Canada and the
Government of the Republic of Ecuador for the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection
of Investments” signed on 29 April 1996 (the “‘Treaty’’), providing, in relevant part, as

follows:

“Article XIII
Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host Contracting Party

1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or
not taken by the former Contacting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and
that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of,
that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled amicably between them.

2. Ifa dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six months from
the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted by the investor to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). For the purposes of this
paragraph, a dispute is considered to be initiated when the investor of one
Contracting Party has delivered notice in writing to the other Contracting
Party alleging that a measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting
Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss
or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.

3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:

(a

the investor has consented in writing thereto;

(b

the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of
this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party
concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;

(c

if the matter involves taxation, the conditions specified in paragraph 5
of Article XII have been fulfilled; and

(d

not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the
alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or
damage.

PART | — Page 2 of 28

The dispute may, at the election of the investor concerned, be submitted to
arbitration under: [...]

(c) an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration tribunal established
under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law (UNCITRAL).

Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of this Article.

al

A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issue in dispute in
accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.

[...]

A tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:
(a
(b)

monetary damages and any applicable interests;

restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide that the
disputing Contracting Party may pay monetary damages and any
applicable interest in lieu of restitution.

A tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration
rules.

. An award of arbitration shall be final and binding and shall be enforceable

in the territory of each of the Contracting Parties.

. Any proceedings under this Article are without prejudice to the rights of the

Contracting Parties under Articles XIV and XV.

. (a) A claim that a Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that

an enterprise that is a juridical person incorporated or duly constituted in
accordance with applicable laws of that Contracting Party has incurred loss
or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, may be brought by an
investor of the other Contracting Party acting on behalf of an enterprise
which the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly. In such a case:

(i) any award shall be made to the affected enterprise;

(ii) the consent to arbitration of both the investor and the enterprise shall
be required;

(iii) both the investor and enterprise must waive any right to initiate or
continue any other proceedings in relation to the measure that is

PART | — Page 3 of 28

alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals
of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure
of any kind; and

(iv) the investor may not make a claim if more than three years have
elapsed from the date on which the enterprise first acquired, or should
have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge
that it has incurred such loss or damage.

Notwithstanding subparagraph 12(a), where a disputing Contracting Party
has deprived a disputing investor of control of an enterprise, the following
shall not be required:

(i)  aconsent to arbitration by the enterprise under 12(a)(ii); and

(ii) a waiver from the enterprise under 12(a)(iii).

C: The Three Mining Concessions

1.8.

In summary, the Parties’ dispute arises from three mining concessions at Junin,
Chaucha and Telimbela in Ecuador granted by the Respondent to (as the Claimant
claims) its associated Ecuadorian project companies that were subsequently revoked

or terminated by the Respondent.

The Claimant alleges that the Respondent unlawfully revoked or terminated the
concessions, thereby depriving the Claimant of the entire value of its investments in
its project companies and causing it to suffer substantial damages.' The Claimant
contends that the Respondent’s actions and omissions violated its obligations to the
Claimant and the Claimant’s investments under the Treaty and international law, as

the applicable law.

D: The Procedural History

1.10.

On 20 July 2010, invoking Article XIII(2) of the Treaty, the Claimant sent a written
Notice of Dispute to Ecuador alleging that measures taken by Ecuador were in breach
of the Treaty, that the Claimant had incurred loss or damage by reason of those

breaches, and requesting monetary compensation.” In response, by letter dated 2

'Claimant’s Statement of Claim, para 2.

registry in these proceedings. The Terms of Appointment also established English as
the sole language of the arbitration; The Hague, The Netherlands, as the legal place
(or “arbitral seat”) of the arbitration; and Washington DC, USA, or such other
geographical venue as the Tribunal may determine in consultation with the Parties as

the physical venue for oral hearings.

accompanying documents, raising several objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Order No. 2, the Tribunal circulated a draft Amended Procedural Order No. 2 to the

Parties inviting them to comment by 25 April 2012.

On 26 April 2012, the Tribunal issued Amended Procedural Order No. 2, setting out a
procedural time-table allowing for the possibility that the Respondent might submit a
request for bifurcation (as between jurisdiction and the merits) and also setting out an

alternative time-table in the event of no such bifurcation.

the Parties’ further agreement to extend these deadlines to 17 April 2013 and 16
August 2013, respectively, and to start the oral hearing on 16 September 2013. The

Respondent confirmed this agreement by separate correspondence.

confidentiality of raw footage from the documentary film “Under Rich Earth” i!
HE (he Respondent, by letter dated 12 August 2013, requested an
urgent confidentiality order from the Tribunal in respect of these materials. The
Claimant opposed this application by letter dated 13 August 2013. On 14 August 2013,
the Tribunal issued an Urgent Procedural Order granting the Respondent’s application
in part. It also extended the deadline for the Respondent to file its Rejoinder to 19

August 2013.

ME By e-mail messages exchanged on 16 August 2013, the Parties agreed to
modify the text of the relevant undertaking; and the Claimant informed the Tribunal

that it no longer required clarification of the Tribunal’s order.

By e-mail of 19 August 2013, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder and

accompanying documents.

On 23 August 2013, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, confirming its Urgent
Procedural Order of 14 August 2013 and addressing certain other procedural matters

From 16-21 September 2013, an oral hearing (the “Hearing”) was held at the World
Bank in Washington, DC, USA.

During the Hearing, the Parties agreed to make simultaneous submissions of post-
hearing briefs by 29 November 2013, rebuttal post-hearing briefs (including costs
submissions) by 24 January 2014, and responses on the reasonableness of the other
side’s costs submissions by 31 January 2014. In addition, the Tribunal requested that
the Parties submit an agreed list of issues by 4 October 2013, as well as agreed

chronologies and dramatis personae together with their post-hearing briefs.

By respective e-mail messages of 4 October 2013, the Parties jointly requested that the
Tribunal extend the deadline for the submission of the agreed list of issues to be
addressed in the Parties’ post-hearing briefs until 11 October 2013. The Tribunal
granted such extension by e-mail message from the Presiding Arbitrator of 6 October

2013.

By respective e-mail messages of 11 October 2013, the Parties jointly requested that
the Tribunal again extend the deadline for the submission of their agreed list of issues
until 22 October 2013. The Tribunal granted such extension by e-mail message from

the Presiding Arbitrator of 13 October 2013.

By e-mail message of 22 October 2013, the Claimant informed the Tribunal of the
failure of the Parties to agree on a single joint list of issues. It proposed that the Parties
submit to the Tribunal, by 24 October 2013, a list of the questions asked by the
Tribunal at the end of the Hearing, a list of additional issues as described by the
Claimant and a list of additional issues as described by the Respondent. By separate e-

mail message of the same date, the Respondent confirmed its agreement to this request.

By e-mail message of 24 October 2013, the Claimant submitted its list of issues
consolidating the questions asked by the Tribunal at the end of the Hearing and the
issues raised by each Party, whether agreed or not. By further e-mail message of 24
October 2013, the Respondent confirmed its agreement to the submission of this
consolidated list. The Tribunal has modified this list for present purposes; and it is

included in the list of principal issues in Part 2 of this Award.

By separate e-mail messages of 21 November 2013, the Parties requested that the

Tribunal extend the deadlines to submit their post-hearing briefs to 4 December 2013,

and the chronology and dramatis personae to 11 December 2013. The Tribunal
confirmed both extensions by e-mail message from the Presiding Arbitrator of 22

November 2013.

On 4 December 2013, the Claimant and the Respondent submitted their respective

Post-Hearing Briefs.

By separate e-mail messages of 10 December 2013, the Parties communicated to the
Tribunal their agreement to extend the deadlines to submit the chronology and

dramatis personae until 16 December 2013.

On 16 December 2013, the Parties submitted their respective chronologies and
requested a further extension to the deadline for the submission of the dramatis
personae until the filing of the reply post-hearing briefs. The Tribunal granted such

extension by e-mail message from the Presiding Arbitrator of 17 December 2013.

By separate e-mail messages of 23 January 2014, the Parties requested the Tribunal’s
agreement to the filing of their cost submissions on 31 January 2014, followed by a
simultaneous reply on costs a week later. The Tribunal approved the above by e-mail

from the Presiding Arbitrator of 24 January 2014.

On 24 January 2014, the Parties submitted their respective Reply Post-Hearing Briefs
and dramatis personae. For present purposes, the Tribunal has modified the latter

documents and the result appears earlier in this Award.

By letter dated 6 February 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal
was preparing to declare the proceedings closed in accordance with Article 29 of the
UNCITRAL Rules and requested that the Parties confirm by 14 February 2014 that
they did not have any “further proof to offer or witnesses to be heard or submissions

to make” in the meaning of that article.

On 7 February 2014, the Parties submitted their respective comments to the other
Party’s costs submissions. The Claimant also confirmed that the proceedings could be

closed.

By letter dated 13 February 2014, the Respondent confirmed that it had no “further
proof to offer or witnesses to be heard or submissions to make” within the meaning of

Article 29 of the UNCITRAL Rules.

By e-mail of 15 December 2014, the Presiding Arbitrator informed the Parties that
there had been and would be a significant delay in the Tribunal’s deliberations as a
result of certain health issues affecting one of its members, for which that member

apologises.

E: The Parties’ Dispute

1.70.

1.71.

1.72.

1.73.

The Tribunal briefly summarizes below the Parties’ respective cases, based on their
written and oral submissions made in this arbitration. This summary, made to facilitate
an understanding of this Award, is not intended to be complete or exhaustive, as to
legal or factual issues. The fact that any submission has been omitted or truncated
below should not be taken as an indication that such submission has not been

considered by the Tribunal.

The Claimant advances its claims under the Treaty, alleging violations by the
Respondent of its international obligations under Article II (as to fair and equitable
treatment [‘FET’] and full protection and security [‘FPS’] standards); Article IV (as to
national treatment) and Article VIII (as to expropriation). In respect of all three
concessions at Junin, Chaucha and Telimbela, the Claimant claims compensation for
its losses in a total principal sum of US$ 70 million, together with compound interest

and costs.

The Respondent objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and, in regard to the Junin
concessions, also to the admissibility of the Claimant’s claims. As to the merits in
regard to three concessions, the Respondent denies any liability to the Claimant,

including causation, compensation, interest and costs.

The Claimant’s Corporate Structure: On 3 February 1999, Messrs. Paul Grist and
Dana Jurika, nationals of the United States of America, incorporated Ascendant
Exploration S.A. Ascendex (“Ascendex”) in Ecuador. Subsequently, they incorporated
Ascendant Holdings Ltd. (“Ascendant”), through which they managed and

controlled Ascendex.>

On 5 May 2004, Ascendant established the Claimant under the name “Ascendant
Copper Corporation” (“Ascendant Copper’), under the laws of the province of British
Columbia, Canada.® By the end of 2004, Ascendant sold its shares in the Claimant to
a small group of early investors. Following its initial public offering (IPO) on 14
October 2005, the Claimant’s shares were listed for trading on the Toronto Stock
Exchange on 22 November 2005. Since then, the Claimant submits that no one person
has owned more than 20% of its shares, two Canadian firms being the largest

shareholders: Sprott Asset Management and Pinetree Capital Limited.’

In November 2004, the Claimant acquired from Ascendant, for US$ 250,000, 100%
of the shares of Ascendant Copper (Barbados) Corporation (“Ascendant Barbados”),
which in turn held 100% of the shares of Ascendant Copper Ascendcopper S.A.
(“Ascendant Ecuador” or “AE”), a corporation established under Ecuadorian law in

May 2001 under the name of “Maley Trade S.A.”*

The Respondent contests the validity of such transfer. It submits that Ascendant
Barbados did not exist at the time of the transfer and that the acquisition was made
through an unsigned deed which was allegedly accepted by Ascendant Barbados at an
uncertain later date.? The Claimant contends that the transfer was validly made and

contends for its continuous ownership of Ascendant Barbados up to the present date.'°

At the time of the acquisition of Ascendant Barbados by the Claimant, Ascendant
Ecuador held concessions in two mining projects in Ecuador: (1) the Junin project,
consisting of the Golden | and Golden 2 concessions (the “Junin concessions” later
enlarged with the adjoining Magdalena concession); and (2) the Chaucha project,
consisting of Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession in southern Ecuador (the “Chaucha

concession”).!!

The Claimant contends that, relying on these concessions, it obtained its initial seed

capital of US$ 3 million from a Canadian investment bank; and that it launched its IPO

and a subsequent offering in June 2007, raising approximately US$ 28 million.'? The
Claimant submits that it invested substantially all of these funds in the development of

its Ecuadorian projects.!*

In 2006, the Claimant indirectly incorporated three subsidiaries in Ecuador: Compaififa
Minera DosRios S.A. (“DosRios”), Compaiiia Minera Telimbela S.A. (“Telimbela’’)
and Compaiifa Ruta de Cobre S.A.'*

The Claimant submits that it was the indirect owner of these companies, as well as
Ascendant Barbados at all material times. While Ascendant Ecuador continued to hold
the Junin Concessions, the Chaucha Concession was transferred to DosRios.
Telimbela held an option to acquire the San Pablo 1 concession for the Telimbela

project in Ecuador (the “Telimbela Concession”). !>

The Respondent contends that since 2009, Biotreat S.A. (“Biotreat”’) has been the sole
shareholder of Ascendant Ecuador and Telimbela, as well as the majority owner of
DosRios. The Respondent further contends that Biotreat has always been wholly
owned by Ecuadorian nationals without any connection to the Claimant or its

subsidiaries. '°

The Claimant submits, however, that at all material times it was and remained the
continuous owner of its several subsidiaries, namely Ascendant Barbados, Ascendant
Ecuador, Dos Rios and Telimbela.'” According to the Claimant, in July 2009, the
Claimant and Biotreat had agreed on the sale of the shares of Ascendant Barbados
(itself the owner of Ascendant Ecuador, Dos Rios and Telimbela), It accepts that
Biotreat expressed an interest in using the surface land at Junin for agricultural
purposes; however, so the Claimant contends, Biotreat only paid a deposit on the

purchase price; and due to its failure to pay the balance of the purchase price, the shares

concedes that Biotreat’s management has remained in control, de facto in Ecuador, of

Ascendant Ecuador, Dos Rios and Telimbela since July 2009. 19

The Concessions: The Respondent submits that within three years of its incorporation,
Ascendex, a company with no history in mining, had obtained by direct application 31
mining concessions and grown into “one of the largest concession holders within

Ecuador”.”°

The Claimant, for its part, submits that its concessions were first acquired by Ascendex
with the assistance of a team of highly skilled geologists and engineers, who allowed

Ascendex to identify highly valuable prospective mining projects in Ecuador.”!

According to the Claimant, in early 2003, Ascendex identified the Chaucha project as
a potential acquisition.”? On 7 November 2003, the Ministry of Mines granted the
Chaucha Concession to Ascendex.”? On 24 November 2003, Ascendex obtained title
to the Telimbela concession.24 The Claimant submits that in the autumn of 2003,
Ascendex was approached by Dr Roque Bustamante (an Ecuadorian lawyer) about the

sale of his interest as the concessionaire of the Junin concessions.”°

Dr Bustamante had obtained the Junin concessions on 20 December 2002.76 The
Respondent contends that the way in which Dr Bustamante acquired the Junin
concessions was a “classic case of tender-rigging”. According to the Respondent, the
Claimant (in collusion with Dr Bustamante) took advantage of a lacuna in the
applicable legal framework whereby in case of multiple applications submitted
simultaneously, a tender was to be organised within 48 hours. When Dr Bustamante
had filed an application for the Junin concessions, two other applicants requested two
concessions each, all for the exact same area sought by Dr Bustamante. However,

when the bidding process was organised, only Dr Bustamante submitted bids; and the

other applicants failed to submit any bid. This resulted in the rights to the Junin
concessions being granted by the Respondent to Dr Bustamante. The Respondent
alleges that the Claimant was behind this improper charade. Also, according to the
Respondent, the Junin concessions represented a more ambitious more risky
acquisition, given it had been a “reserved area” until 2001 due to environmental
sensitivity. It adjoined to a biologically diverse area under close public and local
scrutiny. All this, so the Respondent submits, suggests that Dr Bustamante obtained

the Junin concessions for the Claimant and not for himself.””

The Claimant denies the Respondent’s allegations and contends that Dr Bustamante
applied for the Junin concessions only for himself when he noticed they were available
from the Ministry of Mines. The Ministry considered it an attractive business
opportunity for development by a mining company.”* The Claimant contends that no
allegation of tender-rigging was ever made against the Claimant before the
Respondent’s Statement of Defence. The Claimant further contends that it would have
made no sense for Ascendex to use Dr Bustamante, instead of applying for the
concession in its own name.” The Claimant contends that the Respondent has
presented no evidence why it decided to grant the Junin concessions with full
knowledge that there was only one bidder, namely Dr Bustamante.*? Moreover, the
Claimant alleges that the Respondent has not pointed out to any aspect of the bidding
tules which was violated by the offer made Dr Bustamante; and that, following their
grant, the Ministry of Mines willingly received patent fees for these concessions from

Dr Bustamante, Ascendex and the Claimant.*!

Ascendex purchased the Junin concessions from Dr Bustamante on 29 March 2004,32
which, so the Claimant submits, was an arm’s length transaction.** By two separate
public deeds dated 17 September 2004, Ascendex assigned the Junin and Chaucha
concessions to Ascendant Ecuador. *4 The Claimant submits that the Pichincha

Regional Mining Director had expressly approved Dr Bustamante’s assignment of the

Junin concessions to Ascendex in March 2004, as well as their subsequent assignment
by Ascendex to Ascendant Ecuador.** On 29 November 2006, the Chaucha concession
was assigned by Ascendant Ecuador to DosRios,** whilst Ascendant Ecuador kept the
Junin concessions. In March 2006, Ascendex transferred its rights to the Telimbela
concession to Ecuador Gold S.A. Ecuadorgold (“Ecuadorgold”).*” On 26 October
2006, the Claimant’s subsidiary, Telimbela, acquired an option to acquire the
Telimbela concession from Ecuadorgold. ** The Respondent submits that the
Telimbela concession was never owned or controlled by the Claimant: it was at most

an unexercised option held by Telimbela.*”

1.89. | According to the Claimant, the 1991 Mining Law (Ley de Minerfa), as amended in
2000 (the “2000 Mining Law”),*° pursuant to which these concessions were granted
by the Respondent, declared mining activity to be in the public interest and, while it
recognised that the State held ownership of all natural resources, declared that the State

could authorise the performance of mining activity by granting mining rights.*!

1.90. | The 2000 Mining Law conferred upon the holder of a mining concession the universal
and exclusive property right to explore, exploit, benefit, smelt, refine and trade all the
mineral substances which exist and can be obtained within the concession area.”
Mining concessions had a term of up to 30 years, subject to the payment of an annual
patent fee based on the acreage of the concession; and failure to pay such fee was the
only ground for termination of the concession.** According to the Claimant, while the
1991 Mining Law included both the inactivity by the concession holder and
environmental damage as grounds for termination of concessions, the amendments of

2000 repealed these grounds for termination.

The Junin and Chaucha concessions each declared that their holders held the exclusive
property right to the minerals in the concession areas for a term of 30 years.*> The
Claimant contends that Ecuadorian officials and courts confirmed the validity of Junin
and Chaucha concessions and their assignments, thereby creating expectations on

Claimant's part that its rights to these projects were secure.*®

In this regard, the Claimant contends that the State Attorney General’s opinion relating
to the Junin project (see below, para 4.149), which is legally binding on all public
entities with respect to the subject matter that it addresses, concluded that a lack of
local consultation does not result in the nullification of the title or the mining
concession rights, but in the suspension of the exercise of such activities.” According
to the Claimant, while mining activities were suspended pending the completion of
local consultations and subsequent approval by the Respondent of an environmental
impact study (“EIS”), this suspension would never result in the loss of the mining

rights.**

On the other hand, according to the Respondent, obtaining a mining concession under
the 2000 Mining Law did not translate into immediately enforceable mining rights.
Further steps were required for the concession holders to be permitted to undertake
actual mining activities.*? Among others, environmental regulations applicable to
mining concessions included environmental impact studies and environmental
management plans designed to prevent, mitigate, control, repair and compensate
environmental and social impacts related to mining activities, as well as requirements
of consultation of local communities that may be affected by the contemplated mining

project.

The Respondent contends that under the 2000 Mining Law, the presentation of the EIS
to the affected local communities and their consultation was required before any
mining activity could be undertaken by a concessionaire.» The Respondent contends

that these requirements did not change with the 2008 Mining Mandate or the 2009

that the question regarding the nullity of the mining title was not truly answered by the

legal opinion, which deferred the question to the Municipal Council.**

1.95. The Claimant’s Investments: The Claimant submits that, in reliance on the rights to
the Junin concessions, it made substantial investments in Ecuador. These included: the
commissioning of a technical report by a leading geological consulting firm; the

acquisition of the neighbouring Magdalena | concession;**

the acquisition of surface
land in and around the concession areas; the preparation and submission of an EIS for
the exploration phase of mining activity; the employment and contracting of a team of
Ecuadorian geologists, environmental and community relations experts, managers and
administrative staff; and the commitment of substantial resources to the provision of

social services and community development.**

1.96. As to these investments, the Respondent contends that the land purchase program in
the Junin concession areas by Ascendant Ecuador, post-acquisition of the concessions,
consisted of illegal “land trafficking”, as reported in July 2007 by the Commission for

Civil Control of Corruption (“CCCC”).*°

1.97. The Claimant denies that said report makes any such finding.*° Instead, the Claimant
contends that the CCCC found that persons with no relationship to Ascendant Ecuador
had applied for grants of agricultural land from the Ecuadorian government and then
re-sold those lands at a profit to Ascendant Ecuador. Hence, the Claimant, denying
knowledge of any such activity, claims that, should that finding be true, Ascendant

Ecuador would have been the victim of the land trafficking scheme instead of the

perpetrator.*’ In addition, the Claimant contends that the acquisition of surface rights

is a standard industry practice.**

1.98. The Respondent, however, claims that the CCCC found that the program was
unlawful, linking the acquisitions with favours by public officials, and concluded that

18 of the land acquisitions by Ascendant Ecuador had been illegal.*?

The Respondent
attributes the development and implementation of this “land-trafficking scheme” to the

Claimant.

1.99. With respect to the Chaucha concession, the Claimant submits that, in reliance on the
tights to said concession, it likewise made substantial investments in Ecuador. These
included the commissioning of a technical report that compiled and interpreted
existing exploration data and results, preparing and submitting an EIS to the
Respondent for the exploration phase, upgrading the access road to the concession
area, rehabilitating the existing exploration camp, carrying out an extensive drilling
program, and funding employment and community development initiatives in the
project area (including renovations to the town of San Antonio, two model farm

projects, a reforestation project and a bakery cooperative).°!

1.100. On 26 September 2005, the Respondent’s Under-Secretary of Environmental
Protection approved the EIS for the Chaucha project. Following which, the Claimant
submits that it completed a comprehensive drilling program, beginning in September

2006 through its subsidiary DosRios.©

1.101. The Claimant submits that it also advanced the Telimbela project by conducting
extensive technical studies of the Telimbela concession. It further submits that an EIS

approved by the Under-Secretary, the Claimant submits that there was every indication

that the Telimbela EIS would have been approved by the Respondent in due course.

The Junin EIS: As to the EIS for the Junin concessions, the Claimant obtained approval
for its Terms of Reference from the Respondent’s Under-Secretary of Environmental
Protection on 16 June 2006.™ The EIS for the exploration phase of the Junin project
was completed; it concluded that mining exploration activities in the Junin area could
be conducted in an environmentally sustainable manner; and it was submitted to the
Ministry of Mines on 12 September 2006. According to the Claimant, Ascendant
Ecuador (with the Claimant) engaged in an extensive local consultation process,
obtaining largely favourable comments to the completion of the EIS and the
development of the Junin project. The Claimant also submits that the Respondent
never suggested that the proposed exploration work would create any material

environmental impact.®

The Respondent strongly disagrees that the local communities supported the
Claimant’s mining project and also that the Claimant’s project would not create any

material environmental impact in such an environmentally sensitive area.

The Claimant contends that the Ministry of Mines did not raise any material technical
objection to the EIS; and that it acknowledged that Ascendant Ecuador had completed
consultations of the local inhabitants in all major communities in the Junin area.
Nonetheless, on 8 December 2006, the Ministry of Mines rejected the EIS submitted
by Ascendant Ecuador in September 2006, finding no evidence of consultation by

Ascendant Ecuador of certain affected communities in the area.

According to the Claimant, a small anti-mining group based in some of the villages

exploration and development in the Junin area.’ Hence, following certain violent
incidents described below, Ascendant Ecuador, the Ministry of Mines, the Governor
of Imbabura, and the militant anti-mining groups in the villages identified for the
consultation process entered into negotiations, which culminated in the signature of
tripartite agreements on 20 March 2007 (the “Tripartite Agreements”).° The Claimant
submits that according to the Tripartite Agreement, the Ministry of Mines was to
ensure that anti-mining groups would remove illegal roadblocks and surrender

weapons.

The 2007 Suspension Resolution: However, in July 2007, the Ministry of Mines
demanded that the Claimant and Ascendant Ecuador halt all activities and informed
them that security for their work on the Junin EIS would not be provided by the
Respondent. This demand was followed by a formal resolution of the Pichincha
Regional Mining Director on 25 September 2007 (the “Suspension Resolution”),
declaring the suspension of all mining activity (including the Claimant’s community
relation activities) in the Junin concession area until a report was obtained from the
Mayor of Cotacachi on whether the Junin concessions were located within an urban

perimeter, prohibited by Article 11(a) of the Mining Law.”

The Claimant contends that, as the Junin EIS was never approved by the Respondent,
there was never any “mining activity” at Junin or plans to carry out “mining activity”
after the approval of the EIS anywhere near the limits of any city or populated centre.”!
According to the Claimant, Ascendant Ecuador made a formal appeal against the
Suspension Resolution, but no decision on such appeal was ever issued by the
Respondent.” Further, so the Claimant contends, the Respondent has not pointed to
any legal provision that allowed the Ministry of Mines to suspend all of Ascendant
Ecuador’s activities in the Junin area, including its ability to re-submit an EIS, given

that the Ministry had previously expressed the opinion that Article 11 of the Mining

Law (invoked by the Suspension Resolution) only applied to exploration work in urban

areas and not to community relations work or work needed to complete an EIS.”*

1.108. According to the Respondent, however, the continuing social conflict caused by the
Claimant and Ascendant Ecuador prompted the Suspension Resolution. It was issued
after negotiations between the Regional Mining Director and Ascendant Ecuador and
in accordance with the terms of the Tripartite Agreements. It was necessary, given that
it had become increasingly clear that Ascendant Ecuador had no intention to comply
with the Tripartite Agreements, particularly with its death threats and violence
occurring during 2007.”4 The Respondent contends that the Tripartite Agreements
specifically envisaged its right to exercise its authority to re-establish social peace in
Intag.’> Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the Suspension Order did not apply

to the consultation process or the preparation of a new EIS.”°

1.109. The 2008 Nullification Resolutions: On 25 January 2008, the Pichincha Regional
Mining Director passed resolutions nullifying the Junin concessions (the “Nullification
Resolutions”), declaring them to be unconstitutional on the basis of the State’s
inalienable ownership of all natural resources granted by the Constitution of
Ecuador.’’ Ascendant Ecuador appealed the Nullification Resolutions to the National

Mining Director, who revoked the Nullification Resolutions on 15 September 2008.7*

1.110. The 2008 Mining Mandate: On 18 April 2008, the Respondent’s Constituent Assembly
(Asamblea Constituyente) passed Constituent Mandate No. 6 (Mandato Constituyente
No. 6, the “Mining Mandate”) declaring that mineral substances were “to be exploited
to suit national interests” and provided for the termination (extincidn) “without
economic compensation” of mining concessions falling into a number of categories,
including those “without any investment in project development having been made in

conducted, including those pending an administrative resolution” (Article 1).””

1.111. The 2008 Termination Resolutions: On 7 October 2008, the Under-Secretary of Mines
ordered the termination of the Junin concessions on the basis of the Mining Mandate
stating that “no prior referendum process” had been conducted.*° On 12 November
2008, the Pichincha Regional Mining Director issued two resolutions (the
“Termination Resolutions”) declaring the extinction of the mining rights with respect
to the Junin concessions without any economic compensation pursuant to the Mining
Mandate.*! The Respondent contends that the extinction of the Junin concessions was
a matter of legitimate public policy where the concession holder had failed to secure

the approval of local communities in the years it held the concession.**

1.112. Ascendant Ecuador appealed the Termination Resolutions to the National Mining
Director with the Regional Mining Director’s office in Pichincha, who ruled on 8
January 2009 that the appeal was inadmissible because the Regional Mining Direction
was not competent to process appeals. Previously, the Ministry of Mines had
determined that no review of the Termination Resolutions would be permitted,
instructing the National Mining Director that Article 12 of the Mining Mandate
precluded any such appeal. ** Subsequently, Ascendant Ecuador applied for an
extraordinary measure of protection to the Transitional Constitutional Court, but it was

dismissed on the basis of failure to state any cause of action.**

1.113. The Mining Mandate also suspended any other mining activity until a new mining
legislation was passed; and it declared a moratorium on the granting of new
concessions. As a result, the Claimant contends it suspended any further work on the

Chaucha project on 18 April 2008. The Claimant also suspended the work it had begun

in order to exercise its option on the Telimbela Project.*°

The 2009 Mining Law: On 29 January 2009, a new mining law (the “2009 Mining
Law’) was enacted by the Respondent. Article 24 established that the mining areas
and mining projects where the State of Ecuador conducted geological research,

exploration or prefeasibility or feasibility studies shall be returned to the State.*®

According to this new Mining Law, the Ministry of Mines had 90 days to issue a
Ministerial Order (acuerdo) containing the terms, conditions and periods for the
reversion of the projects under Article 24.8’ The Order was issued on 30 April 2009
giving the Under-Secretary of Mines a term of 45 days to prepare a report identifying
the relevant projects.** The technical report, dated 19 June 2009, identified all three of
the Claimant’s projects as ones in which the State had conducted geological

investigations.*?

Attempted Sales: The Claimant contends that the combined effect of the these
measures taken by the Respondent deprived it of the ability to seek any further public
financing in Canadian capital markets, and therefore, that it was forced to search for a
buyer of its remaining interests in Ecuador as its cash reserves were being depleted.
From the autumn of 2008, the Claimant claims that it pursued such a sale, but each

attempt failed due to uncertainties surrounding its rights to develop its projects.

Facing imminent insolvency, the Claimant claims it was forced to accept a “fire sale”
price offer from Nortec Ventures Corp. (“Nortec’”). However, Nortec withdrew from
its proposed acquisition of Ascendant Barbados finding a “serious title defect with the
[Chaucha] Concession”. Such defect in title referred to the Chaucha concession being
included, together with the Junin and the Telimbela concessions, in the list of projects
where the Respondent had performed geological research and being therefore subject

to reversion to the State under Article 24 of the new Mining Law.”

Nortec then made a filing under Canadian securities law disclosing that: “Nortec
withheld payment as a result of its due diligence review which indicated that the

Chaucha Property was to revert to the State of Ecuador. [...] Nortec’s due diligence

86 Pursuant to the Mining Mandate, in early 2009 the Respondent enacted the new Mining Law (Ley de Minera),
which was published in the Official Gazette (Registro Oficial) No. 517 of 29 January 2009 (C-11).

review confirmed that the Ecuadorian Government had identified the Chaucha
Property for reversion to the State. In the circumstances, Nortec decided not to make
any further payments until such time as it received confirmation that the Chaucha
Property would not be reverted to the State. Nortec still has not received a definitive

pronouncement from the Ecuadoran State in this respect”.°!

1.119. The Claimant states that all further attempts to complete a sale of the shares of
Ascendant Barbados failed and, given the Claimant’s inability to maintain the listing
requirement of the Toronto Stock Exchange due to lack of financing, all trading of the

Claimant’s Copper shares ceased by July 2010.9?

1.120. Contrary to the Claimant’s assertions, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant
terminated the Nortec agreement to pursue negotiations with other buyers. ”*
According to the Respondent, the list referred to by the Claimant containing the
Chaucha and Telimbela concessions did not purport to apply Article 24 and was an
internal confidential document to avoid speculations about any steps to be taken

pursuant to Article 24.%

1.121. According to the Claimant, the existence of this report was no secret.*° According to
the Respondent, however, Nortec could not have obtained a copy of this document
lawfully. °° Moreover, the Respondent contends that any uncertainty about the
Respondent’s position with respect to the Chaucha concession was cleared up on 23
April 2010 when the Respondent re-issued the mining title to the Chaucha concession
to DosRios, with approval to carry out mining activities in the area granted in August

2012.7

1.123. The Respondent denies such allegations and contends that no person holds a
concession in the areas that were covered by the Junin concessions (although it accepts
that ENAMI was granted a mining concession). The Respondent states further that the
same requirement to consult the local population and present an acceptable EIS would
apply for new concessions.” As to the Chaucha concession, the Respondent contends
that DosRios was issued a new mining title in 2010 and continues to operate said
concession. ! As for Telimbela, the Respondent contends that Ecuadorgold, the
holder of the Telimbela concession, chose not to seek to renew its title to the
concession under the new legal regime; and it was accordingly relinquished in

February 2011.'°!
E: Formal Relief Sought by the Parties
1.124. The Claimant: The Claimant requested that the Tribunal render an award in its favour:

“(a) dismissing Ecuador’s preliminary objections;

(b) declaring that it has jurisdiction to hear Copper Mesa’s claim under the
Treaty;

(c) declaring that Ecuador breached its obligations under the Treaty;

(d) ordering Ecuador to pay monetary compensation to Copper Mesa in an
amount of US$69.7 million plus compound interest thereon from April
30, 2013; and

(e) granting Copper Mesa its costs of this arbitration and costs of legal
representation and assistance in an amount to be determined in a final
award”, 102

PART 2 - THE PRINCIPAL ISSUES

A: Introduction

2.1.

2.2.

This list of issues is largely derived from the consolidated list originally prepared by
the Parties, as modified substantially by the Tribunal for present purposes. It should
be read as an incomplete checklist of the principal issues arising in the arbitration,
rather than a comprehensive description of all the issues arising from the Parties’ many

written and oral submissions.

Moreover, as will be evident from later parts of this Award, the Tribunal did not think
it necessary to address and decide specifically all issues listed in this checklist, still
less all issues arising from the Parties’ respective submissions. Moreover, the Tribunal
considers that many of the decisive issues turn on the specific facts of this case. Having

determined those facts, other issues become irrelevant or otiose.

B: Evidentiary Issues

2.3.

24.

2.5.

What is the relevance of missing or potential witnesses, and if so, what evidential
inferences, if any, should be drawn against a Party not calling such available

witnesses?

What is the relevance of the evidence of witnesses who were called by one Party, but

which was not challenged on cross-examination by the other Party?

How should the Tribunal reconcile the conflicting testimony, both written and oral, of,

in particular, Mr. Davis, Mr. Jurika i?

C: Jurisdiction and Admissibility Issues

2.6.

2.7.

What is the correct interpretation and application of Article XIII(12) of the Treaty?

Is the Respondent estopped or otherwise precluded from alleging any breach of
Ecuadorian law or any breaches of the doctrines of international public policy and

unclean hands?

PART 2 - Page | of 6

2.8.

2.9.

2.10.

Regarding Article 1(g) of the Treaty, is there a distinction between the operation and

the acquisition of an investment in accordance with Ecuadorian law under the Treaty?

Regarding Article 1(g) of Treaty again, whether the Claimant “owned and controlled”
its investments in accordance with Ecuadorian law, including international human
rights law as incorporated in Ecuadorian law, so that the Tribunal has jurisdiction
pursuant to Article 1(g) of the Treaty, and whether this obligation of legality extends

beyond the acquisition or making of an investment?

After the making of an investment, what is the scope of the application of the doctrine

of unclean hands?

What were the Claimant’s legitimate expectations, and their source, at the time of its

investment in the Junin concessions?

What is the relevance and what was the extent of the anti-mining sentiment in the Junin

area at the time of the Claimant’s acquisition of its investment in those concessions?

What is the Claimant’s responsibility (if any) for alleged acts of Ascendant Ecuador

or its alleged agents and the consequences of such acts?

Whether the social conflict in the Junin area was the cause for the Claimant’s loss of
the Junin concessions, and, if so, whether it was Ascendant Ecuador and the Claimant
who were responsible for the social conflict because of their community relations
programme and/or their conduct towards the opponents of their mining project and/or

their involvement in the violent incidents of 1 November and early December 2006?

Whether Ascendant Ecuador (as the Claimant’s agent) and the Claimant, committed
human rights violations in 2006 and 2007; and what is the legal standard applicable to

such determination (prima facie or otherwise)?

Whether Ascendant Ecuador and the Claimant failed to obtain the required social
licence to operate the Junin concessions; and whether such failure was wholly

attributable to the Claimant?

If the events in 2006 and 2007 allegedly attributable to the Claiman {i

the Claimant’s project in Junin irretrievably harmed or even doomed by 31 December
2007, before the 2008 Mining Mandate and the Termination Resolutions of 12
November 2008? And, if that were so, what effect would this situation have on issues

of liability, causation and compensation?

How could Ascendant Ecuador and the Claimant consult the local inhabitants of
villages in the Junin area if there were physical barriers across access roads impeding

their ingress?

Whether from August 2006 to 2007, Ascendant Ecuador and the Claimant failed to
comply with the legal requirement to consult the seven communities directly affected
by the mining project (including Barcelona); and whether such failure was attributable

to the Claimant?
Did Ascendant Ecuador ever carry out a local consultation process?

Prior to the Mining Mandate, was there a deadline for Ascendant Ecuador and the

Claimant to complete a local consultation process?

What were the consequences, if any, of the finding that Ascendant Ecuador’s EIS

could not be processed?

Whether Ascendant Ecuador’s EIS was declared inadmissible or rejected on the merits,
and if the former, whether the EIS was so deficient that it would have been rejected on
the merits in any event and, if so, what effect would this situation have of this on issues

of liability and causation of loss?

Did the Respondent’s Ministry of Mines (MEM) have the legal authority to suspend
Ascendant Ecuador’s non-mining activities in the Junin area? If so, what was the

source of that authority?

Whether the Respondent’s 2007 Suspension Resolution was justified on the facts, and
legitimate and justified under the Treaty and international law, regardless of the legal

basis for the suspension under Ecuadorian law?

Did the Respondent’s 2008 Nullification and Termination Resolutions directed at the
Junin concessions pursuant to the Mining Mandate constitute an expropriation or a

breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the Treaty?

PART 2 — Page 3 of 6

2.27.

2.28.

2.29.

2.31.

2.33.

2.34.

Whether the Nullification Resolutions of January 2008 deprived the Claimant of any
right of enjoyment of its investments in the Junin concessions, in view of their

suspension in February 2008 and their reversal in September 2008?

Whether the 2008 Nullification Resolutions were justified on the facts, and legitimate
and justified under the Treaty and international law, regardless of the legal basis for

these under Ecuadorian law?

Did the Ecuadorian legal regime in force prior to the enactment of the Mining Mandate
enable the termination of mining concessions for failure to consult local communities,

in particular by relying on Article 28 of the LGA?

Was the denial of rights to challenge the Mining Mandate and the rejection of
Ascendant Ecuador’s appeal against the termination of the Junin concessions in
November 2008 a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the Treaty?

If so, what losses were caused by that breach?

Whether the Mining Mandate was based on legitimate public policy, so that the
Termination Resolutions of November 2008, based on Article 1 of the Mining

Mandate, were justified and legitimate under international law?

Whether the Claimant was denied any right of appeal against the Termination

Resolutions of November 2008?

Whether an appeal against the Termination Resolutions would likely have been

successful on the merits?

What is the impact (if any) of the rights acquired by ENAMI in 2011 and the current

situation in Junin?

Did the termination of the Junin concessions, followed by the grant of a right of first
refusal thereto to ENAMI and the exercise of that right by ENAMI, constitute a breach

of the national treatment obligation under the Treaty?

What is the current situation with respect to the development of the concessions

covering the Junin project by ENAMI and/or CODELCO?

Whether ownership of the Chaucha Concession was affected by the termination of the

Junin concessions?

Whether there was a “cloud” over the Claimant's title as a result of Article 24 of the
2009 Mining Law (or otherwise); and, if so, whether this was wrongful under the

Treaty?

What steps could the Claimant or its subsidiaries take to clarify the legal status of the

Chaucha concession; and were any such steps taken?

Whether any cloud on title disappeared after the request by the Respondent to submit

information for the renewal of title to the Chaucha Concession in 2010?

2.42.

2.43.

Whether there is any act attributable to the Respondent that led to the expiry of the

Claimant’s option to acquire the Telimbela Concession from Ecuadorgold?

Whether there was a “cloud” over the Telimbela concession as a result of Article 24

fair market value of the Junin concessions, the Chaucha concession and the Telimbela
option, when the application of each of such valuation methods produces such very

different results?

Whether any valuation based on a method other than the market capitalisation of the
Claimant provides reliable results concerning the value of the Claimant’s mining

project?

Should comparable transactions be considered in quantifying damages claimed by the
Claimant? If so, what weight should they be given, along with measures of market

value?

What is the impact on quantum of the cash held by the Claimant on the valuation date

it has chosen?

division, but may be divided into percentage parts represented by rights or actions.

Art. 8. Special Mining Areas. The President of the Republic may declare as Special
Mining Areas any areas that have mining development potential so that the Ministry
of Energy and Mines may, directly or through the Geologic/Mining/Metallurgical
Research Division, undertake surveys, geologic/mining research or another type of
mining activities under their respective jurisdictions. Such declaration may be
issued for free development purposes. No mining concessions may be granted in

special mining areas. [...]
ii.) The 2000 Mining Law°

Art. 4. Public Interest — Mining activity in all its phases, on or outside concessions,
is declared to be in the public interest. Consequently, it is proper to constitute

easements as necessary, in accordance with this Law.

Art. 5, State Authority Over Mines and Deposits - All mineral substances existing
in the national territory belong to the inalienable and inextinguishable ownership
of the State, whatever their origin, form or physical state, and whether they are
under the ground, on the surface, on the seabed or in marine waters. And, the
exploitation shall agree with the lineaments of sustainable development and of
environment protection and conservation.

As provided in the last sub-section of section 1 of Article 46 (actual Art. 247) of the

mining concessions gives preferential rights to receiving them.

Art. 7. Mining Concessions — A mining concession is a universally valid and
property related right, distinct and independent from the ownership of land on
which it is located, even when both belong to the same person. The universally valid
right which derives from the mining concession is defensible as against third
parties, transferable and transmittable, susceptible to mortgage and, in general, to

any act or contract except to form part of the common property of a family.

Constructions, installations and other articles permanently linked to the operation

are considered real property accessory to the concession.

area has potential mining development but has not been granted under concession,
in order for the Sectorial Ministry, through its agencies, to map out the area,
conduct geological-mining research or undertake any other kind of activity of
scientific interest, within its respective competences. The declaration of a Special
Mining Area shall expressly establish the term thereof, which shall not be greater
than four years; once that term expires, the declaration shall be lifted without the
need of any ruling so declaring. In any case, the declaration shall respect legally
established rights or the rights derived therefrom. Mining concessions shall not be
granted in said areas during the term thereof.

During the next four years after the term of a Special Mining Area, the National
Mining Company shall have preferential rights to request mining concessions in

include the applicable environmental assessment describing _ prevailing
environmental conditions, the mechanisms to mitigate any potential impact, if
applicable, and the specific environmental regulations applicable to the activities

subject matter of the concession.

Article 28. Every natural or legal person is entitled to participate in environmental
management, through the mechanisms established in the Rules for such purpose,
including consultation, public hearings, initiatives, proposals or any form of
association between the public and the private sector. Popular action shall be
available to denounce anyone in breach of this warranty, without prejudice to the

civil and criminal liability for reckless or malicious accusations.

The non-compliance with the consultation procedure referred to in Article 88 of the
Political Constitution of the Republic renders unenforceable the activity to which it

refers and renders null the respective contracts.

The Constituent Assembly issued Constituent Mandate No. 6. Article 1 thereof
stipulates that: “Extinction without any economic compensation is declared for all
mining concessions which during their exploration stage did not make investments
by December 31, 2007 to develop the project or have not submitted the
corresponding environmental impact study or have not conducted a prior

resolution.” TWO: Memorandum No. 2253-DINAPAM of October 02, 2008, issued
by the National Mining Environmental Protection Director, which states: (...)
“based on a review of the physical file at this ministerial office, it has been verified
(...) GOLDEN I AREA code 401447: A joint environmental impact evaluation study
was submitted for Golden I, Golden 2, and the Magdalena areas. On December 8,
2006, it was declared that the study Can Not be Processed [sic] because the
invitation to a prior referendum and public dissemination process, made to at least

because the Constituent Assembly declared the extinction of all mining concessions
falling under the situation described in Article I of Constituent Mandate No. 6,
without any economic compensation whatsoever, and based on the order issued by
the Mining Undersecretariat, as the Pichincha Regional Mining Director I

PART 4 - THE PRINCIPAL FACTS

A: Introduction

4.

4.2.

43.

The relevant factual chronology to the Parties’ dispute is long, complicated and, in many
material respects, highly disputed between the Parties. In these circumstances, the
Tribunal has had to consider at length the voluminous documentary evidence submitted
by the Parties, together with the written and oral testimony of their respective factual
witnesses and several hours of film and video-recordings. The Tribunal’s principal
findings of fact are recorded below in the form of a chronology, insofar as relevant to its
other decisions in this Award. Despite its length, this chronology reflects only a portion

of the full history of the mining controversies, particularly in the area of Junin.

For this purpose, the Tribunal has generally placed primary importance on contemporary
documentation, as being usually the most reliable factual evidence. Where appropriate,
it has accepted the testimony of certain of the Parties’ factual witnesses, but only where
such testimony is corroborated by contemporary documentation or other reliable
testimony. It has not relied on contemporary documentation that appears to have been
forged or falsified by third persons. It has also guarded against apparent corroboration
from duplicated evidence traceable to an earlier single source. It has taken no account of
statements made by persons under duress or in a state of fear. As regards facts derived
from films, video-recordings and photographs, the Tribunal has taken no account of
accompanying text or commentary from unknown persons; and it has guarded against

what might be regarded as editorial selection in the production of such materials.

For ease of reference in the chronology, the Tribunal does not always seek to distinguish
between the Claimant (“Ascendant Copper” or “Copper Mesa’’) and Ascendant Ecuador
(“AE”), the local project company for the Junin concessions and (at first) also for the
Chaucha concession. It is unnecessary do so: at all material times AE acted as the agent
of the Claimant in Ecuador. Similarly, the Tribunal does not always seek to distinguish
between the Claimant, AE and the other project companies, DosRios (“Compaiiia
Minera DosRios S.A.”) and Telimbela (“Compajfifa Minera Telimbela S.A.”), for the
Chaucha and Telimbela concessions respectively. Again, AE acted as the agent of the

Claimant; and both acted for these two project companies. Again for ease of reference,

PART 4 — Page 1 of 101

44.

45.

4.6.

47.

the Tribunal refers to the Claimant’s Telimbela concession; but it was, ultimately, only

an option to acquire the Telimbela concession which was owned by Telimbela.

It is necessary at the outset to identify three particular sources of evidence used by the

Tribunal: (i) Mr Davis and (iii) Mr Zorrilla.

Mr Davis testified in writing and orally at the Hearing, called as a factual witness by the
Claimant. He made two written witness statements; and he was cross-examined by the
Respondent at the Hearing. Mr Davis has been the President, Chief Executive Officer
and a board director of the Claimant since the end of 2004. He was not previously
involved in the Claimant’s concessions in Ecuador. He does not speak Spanish; and he
had not previously worked in Ecuador. Mr Davis, however, has more than thirty years’
management experience in mining and mineral resources all over the world. The
Tribunal found him generally to be a reliable factual witness, as to facts of which he had

direct knowledge at the time. He was obviously, as defined below, a ‘pro-miner’.

Mr Zorrilla testified only in writing, also called as a factual witness by the Respondent.
He made two written witness statements. He was not required for cross-examination by
the Claimant at the Hearing; and, accordingly, he did not testify at the Hearing. He is a
citizen of the USA, of Cuban origin, living in the Junin area since 1978. The Claimant
contends that material parts of his evidence are no more than hearsay or conjecture,
motivated by his resolute anti-mining views expressed over many years. The Tribunal,
as will also appear below, found him to be a useful factual witness in several respects,
to the extent that his testimony, based on his own knowledge over a long period of time,
was corroborated by or corroborating other testimony. He was, as defined below, an

‘anti-miner’.

PART 4 — Page 2 of 101

4.9.

4.10.

It is regrettable that several persons, with highly relevant testimony, did not testify
during this arbitration. These persons include, in particular: Mr Francisco Veintimilla,
General Cesar Villacis and Mr Ronald Andrade. The latter is a fugitive from justice, on
suspicion of drug-dealing and murder (both unrelated to the Parties’ dispute); and his
absence was readily understandable. The other two persons might have been called as
witnesses by the Claimant, as their former employer. Given the usual difficulties in
requiring a private person to testify as a witness in an international arbitration, the
Tribunal draws no adverse inference against the Claimant for not presenting their
testimony in this arbitration. In the circumstances, the Tribunal can only do its best with
these missing pieces of the jigsaw. However, whilst it suffers from no adverse inference,
the Claimant can equally derive no advantage over the Respondent from the absence of

these witnesses.

The factual chronology set out below covers a period of thirty years, beginning in 1981
and ending in 2011. It should be read with the documentation in the footnoted references,
including the recitation of the Parties’ respective cases in Part 1 above. It would lengthen
unduly an already long document to include full summaries of the footnoted
documentation. Hence, the facts are often only briefly described in the main text. Where
the footnoted reference is made to a Party’s pleading, it refers to the evidence there cited.

Where the original document is in Spanish, the English translation is used.

The Claimant’s principal concessions were situated in the Junin area, known as Golden
1, Golden 2 and (later) Magdalena. The area of the concessions extended over 12,900
hectares. The Junin area lies within the larger “Intag area”. It is situated approximately
80 kilometres north of Quito, in a remote part of Ecuador located in the western part of
the Province of Imbabura in the Canton of Cotacachi. The southern boundary of the
Junin area is the Intag River. Its northern and western boundaries partly adjoin the
Protected Forest of Chontal Intag, the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve and the
near-by Protected Forest of Pajas de Oro. The area’s topography is rugged, with steep-
sided mountains, hills and tropical forest, only part of which is cleared for farming. At
the material time, there was little industrial activity; about 70% of the population worked
as farmers (full time or part time); the mountain roads were largely dirt tracks; there
were limited medical facilities (with only one permanent doctor in Pefiaherrera); and
there was a permanent police force only in Apuela. In short, it was an area where the

forces of the State, particularly of law and order, had long been only thinly present.

The Intag area’s principal communities are Cotacachi, Apuela, Pefiaherrera and Garcia
Moreno. The smaller communities include Chontal Alto, Chontal Bajo, La Armenia,
Chalguayacu Alto, Chalguayacu Bajo, Junin, Cuellaje, La Magnolia, Alto Mira,
Barcelona, El Rosario, La Esperanza, La Libertad and Cerro Pelado. For ease of
reference, these smaller communities are collectively described as the “Junin area”. The
last two-named were situated within the geographical area of the Claimant’s Junin
concessions, Golden 1 and Golden 2 respectively. As a matter of local government, the
area formally comprised six parish councils, but within these bodies, there seems to have

been evolutionary changes (both de facto and de jure).

It is necessary to distinguish between these communities likely to be directly affected,
adversely, by the mining concessions, where anti-mining opposition was strongest, and
those communities more likely to benefit from the concessions. Opposition to the mining
was concentrated in the Junin area, while strong support was expressed by local
politicians in Cotacachi. Although, for ease of reference above and below, the simplistic
terms ‘pro-mining’, ‘pro-miner’, ‘anti-miner’ and ‘anti-mining’ are used, there were

many variations of both: neither formed strictly distinct and permanent groups.

The Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession was situated in the south of Ecuador, namely 70
kilometres west of the town Cuenca in the Chaucha parish, in the Cuenca Canton of the
Azuay Province in Southern Ecuador. The parish lies on the western flanks of the Andes
in the Cordillera Occidental. The concession covered an area of approximately 3,000

hectares.

The Telimbela concession was situated in the Canton of Chimbo in the Province of
Bolivar, south of Quito, covering an area of approximately 4,200 hectares. As already
explained, this was not a concession, but ultimately an option for a concession; and it is

here described as a “concession” for ease of reference only.

Several maps of the concession areas are appended overleaf: namely the Junin
concessions (taken from the Respondent’s Exhibit R-504); the Chaucha (Janeth 1)
concession (taken from Exhibit C-23); and the location of the Junin, Chaucha and

Telimbela concession areas within Ecuador (taken from Claimant’s Exhibit C-19).

' Respondent’s

1981-82 — A study of the Junin area is made by the Respondent’s General Direction
for Geology and Mines of Ecuador (“DGGM”).!

1984-85 — Additional geological, geochemical and geophysical investigations are
conducted by DGGM and the Belgian State Technical Assistance Mission
(“AGCD”).?

31 May 1991 — The 1991 Mining Law is enacted by the Respondent.*

19 July 1991 — A Cooperation Agreement is made between Japan and Ecuador, which

provides for mining studies in Ecuador, including the Junin area.*

1991-1997 — The Junin area is studied for a proposed mining project by the Japanese
International Co-operation Agency (“JICA”), with the Metal Mining Agency of Japan.
JICA subcontracted exploratory work to Bishimetal Exploration Company Limited (a
subsidiary of Mitsubishi, also known as “Bishi Metals” or “Bishimetal”). The
Respondent’s CODIGEM (in English, the ‘Corporation for Geological, Mining and
Metallurgical Research and Development’) was JICA’s counterparty.° At that time,

there was no history or experience of mining in the Junin area.

January 1995 — DECOIN (in English, the ‘Ecological Defence and Conservation of
Intag’), a private organisation, is founded by Carlos Zorrilla (who became its executive
director) with the support of Father Giovanni Paz.° Its name speaks for itself: it was

anti-mining in the Junin area, including JICA’s proposed project.

1996 — Auki Tituaiia is elected as the Mayor of Cotacachi.’ He introduces, as part of

reforms in local government, participatory popular assemblies with representatives

from local communities, known as “Cantonal Unity Assemblies” (Asambleas de

Unidad Cantonal). Mr Tituafia was to be re-elected in 2000 and 2004.

1996 — From July 1995 to January 1996, Bishimetal carries out a preliminary
environmental impact study, together with representatives of CODIGEM. The
Tribunal notes the Claimant’s submission that this early study related to the
exploitation phase of the project rather than the exploration phase (as were its Junin
concessions).* That distinction could bring little comfort to the communities likely to
be affected by any mining project in the Junin area, then or later. Nor did it, as

subsequent events demonstrate.

March 1996 — JICA submits to the Respondent its Final Report on the Technical
Cooperation for Mineral Exploration in (inter alia) the Junin area.° It confirms the
discovery of large deposits of copper. It also contains several passages on the

environmental impact of the proposed mining project on the Junin area.
For example, as regards adverse environmental impacts, the report states:

[Part 1, Para 5.2.1]: “... the Junin area, which is adjacent to the area of the
Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve in the north and the Intag river in the
south, is rich in natural beauty. Therefore, it was recognised that it would be
necessary to carry out an environmental impact assessment there, based on a
tentative development plan, prior to any mining development. The study was
an assessment carried out at the preliminary research stage. The environmental

research area is approximately 150 km? (Fig. 1-1-3)”

[Part 2, Para 2.7.4(1)]: “The area of the mining installations consists of open-
cast operations, roads, the area of the waste reservoirs, the area of tailing dams,
grinding plants, mining offices, etc. It reaches 45.6 sq. km and the primary
forest of the sub-tropical rainforest (1,100 ha), the very wet sub-tropical forest
(1.56 ha), and the wet sub-tropical forest (1,900 ha) are felled. The cultivated
area is also changed by the development area. The northern part of the split
area is situated in another place 4 km from the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological

Reserve area, so that the development area encroaches upon the buffer zone of

§ Memorial para 162.

°R-107.

PART 4 — Page 9 of 101

the area of reserve. It is assumed that massive deforestation will give rise to an
increase in dry conditions (known as “Desertification”), effects on the local
climate and alteration of the vegetation around the boundary of the split area.
Furthermore, the direct effect on the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve
area is not thought to be small. It will be necessary to change the development
plan in accordance with the results of more detailed research of the fauna and

flora. ...”

[Part 2, Para 2.7.4(2)]: “It is assumed that effects on flora and fauna in the
Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve area due to the development area will
not be small, due to encroachment into the buffer zone 5 km wide. It is
necessary to carry out investigations outside the influence of the Cotacachi-
Cayapas Ecological Reserve area on a continuous basis, together with
investigations to monitor the flora and fauna. It is very important and necessary
to change the development plan based on the results of the research and
monitoring examinations. In the event that it is possible to obtain further access
to the interior, there will be a very great impact on the very wet sub-tropical
forest, very wet mountain forest or higher parts due to legal or illegal felling,
accompanied by development. Therefore, it is necessary to restrict not only the
construction of new access roads to the interior but also the splitting of the

existing forest ...”

[Para 2.7.6c]: “The resettlement of the inhabitants of the communities of Junin,
EI Pelado, Barcelona and part of La Libertad, a total of approximately 100
families, will be necessary for the open-cast mining development to take place.
Resettlement of the inhabitants of the communities of Junin, a total of
approximately 40 families, will be necessary for the underground mining
development to take place. In the event that agreement cannot be reached to

resettle the inhabitants, it will be necessary to change the development plan.”

[Para 2.7.6d]: “In order to avoid misunderstandings among the local inhabitants
with regard to the execution of a mining development plan, and to prevent the
rapid occurrence of problems, it is hoped that good communications will be
established with the local inhabitants and communities. Above all, it will be

necessary to establish an advance process of dealing with problems, involving

explanations, excursions, etc., to prevent mining contamination, including

water quality, air quality, etc.”

As to certain of the beneficial impacts from the proposed mining project,

report states:

[Part 2, Para 2.7.6.2]: “In the event that the mining development takes place,
the expansion of employment opportunities will improve living conditions,
adequacy of sanitation and medical treatment, and the improvement of
economic conditions and well-being will be promoted. It will be necessary to
improve the roads, including resurfacing depending on the increase in traffic.
In the event that the presence and value of ruins and cultural assets are clarified,
it will be very important and necessary to change the development plan based
on those conditions. It will be necessary to establish an advance process for
dealing with problems, involving explanations, excursions, etc.; to prevent
mining contamination, including water quality, air quality, etc. It will be
necessary to give the inhabitants sufficient explanation of the progress of the
resettlement process, to ensure the safety of the resettlement locations and to
guarantee them with the consent of the inhabitants. In the event that agreement
cannot be reached to resettle the inhabitants, it will be necessary to change the
development plan. Industrial and domestic waste will not be transported outside
the development area and will be treated within that area. Wastewater in the
development area will be treated in wastewater treatment facilities, and the

treated water will then be discharged into the rivers.”

The report’s contents become publicly available, unofficially. Notwithstanding its

guarded terms, its emphasis on consulting affected local communities and the potential

benefits to the Junin area it described, the report leads to significant controversy within

those communities likely to be adversely affected by the project.'? The report’s

prescient tone and the hostile reactions to its contents lay the seeds for the difficulties

that follow over the next decade.

It is however correct, as Mr Davis testified, that the report’s description of this early

project applied to an exploitation phase and not an exploration phase. '! According to

Mr Davis, that early project was also different from Copper Mesa’s later project; and
the report had also become outdated by the time of Copper Mesa’s project: it did not
reflect improved mining technologies; and, for example, Copper Mesa anticipated
building a ‘zero discharge’ facility that would have a very limited environmental
impact. As described below, to the opponents of both projects, all this was a distinction
without a difference: they were anti-mining, whatever phase or form it might take. It
is, however, important to bear in mind that, from the outset of this proposed project in
Junin, a significant part of the local communities was pro-mining and that the

Government of Quito was, at that time, also pro-mining.

29 April 1996 — Canada and Ecuador conclude their Agreement “for the Promotion

and Reciprocal Protection of Investments” (the “Treaty”).!?

Early 1997 — Bishimetal publishes its full report.'* Soon after its publication, the
Council of the Communities (Consejo de las Comunidades) is created. Representatives
from seven communities directly affected by the proposed project are elected to the
Council. '4 It requests consultations with Bishimetal over the proposed project’s

environmental impact, without success.

1997 — The 1997 Cantonal Unity Assembly, attended by hundreds of delegates,
proposes to declare Cotacachi an Ecological Canton. (The formal declaration was later

made on 13 September 2000 with the “Cotacachi Ordinance”: see below).!°

12 May 1997 — Confrontations take place between Bishimetal, CODIGEM and
members of the local communities. At first, on 12 May 1997, a group of 50 from the
latter occupy the mining camp of Bishimetal and CODIGEM in Junin, without overt
violence on either side.'® It is reported that the reason for the occupation is the lack of
consultation by Bishimetal and CODIGEM over the proposed project’s adverse

environmental impact, including the displacement of families, deforestation,

activity from outsiders. !”

15 May 1997 — Anti-mining members of the local communities, said to be 150 in
number, deliberately burn down the mining camp of Bishimetal and CODIGEM.'*®
The Respondent commences criminal proceedings against certain named individuals

alleged to have taken part in the arson. These eventually lead nowhere.

16 May 1997 — A landowner in the Junin area (Mr Piedra), who had refused Bishimetal
permission to enter his land, is shot dead. The date is unclear: it may have occurred
earlier in 1997.'? However, whilst an anti-mining NGO later attributed his murder to
“a paramilitary squad presumably sent by [Bishimetal]’, there is no evidence to

support this allegation before the Tribunal.”°

As later events demonstrate, there were
acts of violence committed by individual pro-miners without responsibility attributable
to any mining concessionaire: there can, in such circumstances, be no “presumption”

here against Bishimetal.

Summer 1997 — Bishimetal departs from the Junin area, abandoning the proposed

mining project owing to local hostility.7!

These events were widely reported at the time, both within and without Ecuador. In
particular, they became known to the Claimant before its active involvement in the
Junin area. As Mr Jurika testified: “We knew that Bishi Metals had faced some local
opposition to the development of the Junin project and that some opponents had

resorted to violence by burning down one of its camps.”

12 September 1997 — The Environmental Regulation for Mining Activities (Executive
Decree) (“RAAM”) is promulgated by the Respondent.”’ In brief, the regulation

provides that a ‘preliminary evaluation of environmental impact’ has to be submitted

4.42. July 1999 — The Environmental Management Law 1999 is enacted in Ecuador.*?

4.43. December 1999 - DECOIN and the Association of Coffee Growers request a review
by the World Bank Inspection Panel regarding the World Bank’s funding of
PRODEMINCA (the Ecuador Mining Development and Environmental Control
Technical Assistance Project), a mineralogical mapping exercise by the Respondent
co-funded by the World Bank, the United Kingdom and Sweden.*? The World Bank
Inspection Panel later reports, on 21 February 2001, that the World Bank was
substantially compliant but also “in apparent violation of certain provisions of the
[World Bank’s] policies and procedures on Environmental Assessment’, including

local consultation. The Tribunal notes this emphasis on consulting local communities.

444. In this regard, after meetings in Quito and the Junin (Intag) area, the World Bank

Inspection Panel’s report concludes:

“[54]. During its investigation the Panel was confronted repeatedly with a
strongly expressed fear that the Project’s geo-information activities would lead
to mining in the Region surrounding the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological
Reserve. This fear was expressed not only by representatives of residents of the
Intag Area, but also by the Mayor, councilors and residents of the town of
Cotacachi and by leaders of several NGOs in Quito who met with the Panel.
Although it is obviously hard to estimate the percentage of the population in
the Intag Area and the town of Cotacachi who shared these fears and concerns,

it was clearly a substantial number.”

“[55]. During its Town Hall meeting with the Mayor Auki Tituafia Males,
Councillors and residents of Cotacachi, the Inspection Team heard
representatives of different groups from civil society express their fear that the
publication of maps and the CD-ROM would lead to mining around and even
in the Cotacachi-Cayapas Ecological Reserve, with a range of negative
consequences for their communities. The Mayor presented the Panel with
copies of two documents related to this fear: a Municipal Resolution declaring
the Cotacachi Canton an Ecological Zone [in 1997, see above], and Minutes

containing the Resolutions of the Fifth Cantonal Unit Assembly of September

? R-158.
33 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial para 37; and R-108.

PART 4 — Page 15 of 101

4.45.

13-15, 2000 [see below]. Of significant relevance to this Project is Resolution
17 of the Minutes that states that: ‘the Assembly demands from the Ministry of
Environment and the Ministry of Energy and Mines that dissemination of
PRODEMINCA’s Mining information about the Cotacachi-Coyapas
Ecological Reserve and the [Cotacachi] Canton in general be stopped.’ A day
later, at a meeting with the Inspection Team, in Apuela, a small town in the
Intag Valley, about 40 representatives of different community based

organizations expressed similar fears.”

“[56]. During these meetings, it became evident that part of the information on
which the local people based their opinions, was in fact misinformation. Some
people, for example, had the impression that PRODEMINCA was a mining
company. Some did not know that parts of the Intag Valley would not be
mapped. Others were ‘convinced’ that PRODEMINCA was producing detailed
maps that easily could lead to an ‘invasion’ of illegal or artisanal miners. No
one, of course, had seen the maps, nor had the CD-ROMs been properly
explained to them. People at these meetings spoke about their experience with
exploration activities around a mine site in the Junin area, where a mining
company was forcibly removed by elements of the community [i.e. Bishimetal
in 1997, see above]. This traumatic event engendered fear and, the Panel was
informed, caused severe problems in the community between those that were
employed by the company and those that were against mining activities in the

Valley.”

By the time the World Bank Inspection Panel report was published, it is clear that the
local community was becoming increasingly divided between anti-miners and pro-
miners. It is also clear that the Government in Quito, in contrast to local government,
was seen, by the anti-miners as pro-mining and pro-mining concessions. The Tribunal
also notes a regrettable feature of this controversy: a fear and mistrust by anti-miners

of all mining, based in part on, in the World Bank Inspection Panel’s phrase,

“misinformation”.

3 August 2002 — The parish leaders in Apuela, Plaza Gutiérrez, Cuellaje, Garcia
Moreno, Pefiaherrera and Vacas Galindo send a letter to the Respondent’s Ministry of
Energy and Mines (“MEM”),*° voicing concern over the auction of concessions in

Intag. The letter states (inter alia):

“\.. It is worth mentioning that the Intag communities, along with local,
national and international organizations, have voiced their opposition to the
mining activities in an irrevocable manner. The company which tried to start
mining operations in the area was forced to leave. Please be informed that these
communities continue to be firmly opposed to the mine. More importantly, they
are more determined than ever to prohibit such activity in their communities
and are supported by the Presidents of other parishes, the Mayor of the Canton,
the Ordinance declaring Cotacachi an Ecological canton and a network of
national and international entities. In light of the foregoing, we hereby request
the immediate suspension of the award of all concessions and auction
procedures relating to mining exploration studies and mining exploitation in
the Cotacachi Canton. What you are aiming at is in violation of the Cotacachi
Ecological Ordinance and is contrary to the goals and wishes of the
communities. If, despite the foregoing, you decide to enter the Cotacachi
Canton, in particular the Intag area, we will assume no responsibility for the

communities’ decisions and actions ...”

20 December 2002 — Following an auction initiated by MEM on 15 August 2002, the
“Golden 1” and “Golden 2” concessions in Intag, in the Junin area, are granted by the
Respondent (MEM) to Dr Roque Bustamante. He pays US$8,005.00 for Golden 1 and
$10,000.00 for Golden 2.*!

May 2003 — On 12 May 2003, local communities in the Junin area (represented by
Mayor Tituajfia) seek urgent constitutional protection in the Court of Imbabura against
the granting of the Junin concessions, in legal proceedings against MEM and Dr
Bustamante. The Imbabura Court, by its judgment of 27 May 2003, grants the
following relief:*>

[Article 5]: “From the above, and having analysed the evidence adduced by the
parties, it becomes apparent that the mining concession granted by the
Pichincha Regional Mining Directorate to Mr Roque Bernardo Bustamante
Espinoza, would have brought serious consequences and impacts such as on an
environmental and ecological level in rivers and streams and to the flora and
fauna, and social impacts, and others. Moreover, it is not apparent from
proceedings that [by: sic] the Pichincha Regional Mining Directorate has taken
into account the provisions of Article 88 of the National Constitution, i.e.: that
the criteria of the community were not previously considered; because, as has
previously been said, the inhabitants of the six parishes of Intag in this canton
have resolutely objected to said mining concession occurring. Wherefore,
above without requiring further analysis, and since this Judge estimates that
constitutional provisions have been violated, such as Article 86 and 88 of the
National Constitution; the Fundamental rights protection measure is accepted,
submitted by the Attorney Generals and representatives of the Municipality of
Cotacachi and it is resolved to rescind the mining Concession previously
granted to the Pichincha Regional Mining Directorate in favour of Mr Roque

Bernardo Bustamante Espinoza, namely in the areas known as Golden 1, of an

created by members of the communities in Intag affected by the Junin concessions. Its
central board is composed of representatives from Junin, Chalguayacu Alto, Cerro
Pelado and La Armenia. It was brought into existence as a direct result of the previous
day’s meeting with Ascendex. Its stated aim is the economic and social development
of the communities of Intag and the permanent restraint of mining activities; i.e. it is
resolutely anti-mining. ©? Jaime Polibio Pérez is elected as its leader.™ Its first step is
to send a letter regarding the meeting to Mayor Tituafia dated 17 May 2004. * Shortly

afterwards, it organises a series of public protests against the Junin concessions.®

2 June 2004 — Ascendex states on its website that it intends, as part of its vision “to be
a profitable mining company that will achieve the highest standards of
social, environment and industrial philosophies”, to create “a company administered
foundation that will work with and finance existing foundations and

development endeavors.”°°

July 2004 — Ascendant Ecuador (“AE”) is acquired by Ascendant Copper (Barbados)

also possible that this incident took place much later, when Mr Pérez was shoved
against a car on 27 August 20077? (see below). It is equally possible that it took place
in August 2004 when Mr Pérez was allegedly threatened by Mr Andrade who, gun in

Mr Jurika testified that CODEGAM was created by a number of community leaders
who were not related to Ascendex (or AE):** it was to be an independent community
organisation that gave a voice to the many members of the local community that saw
mining as the only source of economic development; Ascendex agreed that
CODEGAM could administer certain social services and community development
programs that Ascendex wished to finance; but this “did not make CODEGAM an

agent of Ascendex in any way.”*?

participating in religious, political or partisan acts.” Its objects (stated generally in
Article 5) do not call for mining in Garcia Moreno; and there is no ostensible link with
Ascendex or AE. It is nonetheless resolutely pro-mining and in favour of the Junin

8 December 2004 — A declaration of the Parish Government of Garcia Moreno is
promulgated. °? It is pro-mining. The declaration (inter alia) congratulates the
“respectful and serious attitude of [AE] with which it is carrying out the socialization
process, within the framework of a development plan of the sector, of the exploration
project in the GOLDEN concessions.” It also records that the majority of the parish
communities, represented at the meeting, were in accord with the presence of AE in
the parish and their “public support for Ronald Andrade, CODEGAM President, who
has in a courageous form defended the development of the region and country and who
is currently the victim of persecution, threats and attacks against his life on the part of
DECOIN, since he has denounced publicly the existing corruption in these
organisations, that handle money incorrectly, and petition him, in the name of our
communities, to continue with his struggle and defense of the progress and
development of our parish.” It denounces foreigners (including Mr Zorrilla) said to be
intervening in the internal politics of the country. It also denounces “arbitrary road
controls” established by DECOIN and its supporters at La Armenia, Chalguayacu Alto
and Bajo, San José de Magdalena and Junin. The declaration is signed by 25 persons,

including Jorge Pasquel, José Yanouch, Melva Vallejos and Guido Cousin.

the Tribunal’s use of the terms “employee” and “employment” should not be

2004 - Summary: By the end of 2004, it is clear that the communities in the Junin

remained sorely divided between pro-mining and anti-mining activists, with

PART 4 — Page 27 of 101

2005

4.98.

allegations of violent and other unlawful conduct freely made by each side, often with
cause. It is equally clear that conduct by individual pro-miners cannot, without more,
be attributed to AE (or Ascendant Copper). The hostilities between pro-miners and
anti-miners pre-existed the granting of the Junin concessions; and certain anti-miners
were not angels, as evidenced by the arson attack on Bishimetal. Nor can the conduct
of the anti-miners be attributed to the Respondent. To the contrary, the Government in
Quito supported AE and its Junin concessions; and it remained unequivocally pro-
mining. However, as already indicated, governmental agencies, including the forces

of law and order, were only thinly present in the Junin area.

There were also new features that greatly aggravated the situation. First, the creation
of CODEGAM, led by Mr Andrade with General Villacis and now well funded by AE,
was to be a catalyst for much more serious events to come. It significantly contributed
to the polarisation of local communities. Second, the unlawful road-blocks established
by some anti-mining communities were soon to cause AE severe difficulties. These
had to be overcome, somehow, if the Junin concessions were to enjoy any chance of

success.

At this point, AE was aware (with Ascendant Copper) that it faced severe troubles in
the Junin area, sufficient to imperil the further development of its concessions. Whilst
MEM and the Government in Quito as a whole were pro-mining, AE knew that the
Government’s powers in the Junin area were weak, if not (for most practical purposes)
non-existent, and therefore easily exploited by both pro-miners and anti-miners with
an increasing risk of social conflict. For AE and Ascendant Copper, all this required a
new strategy: increased efforts, particularly with social funding, to gain genuine
support for the Junin project amongst the local communities (with CODEGAM’s
involvement); and a program of land acquisition both to secure such support and also

to gain ready access to the Junin concessions.

complicated transaction. It was fully explained by Mr Davis in his testimony; and the

Tribunal accepts his evidence as to the legitimacy of this transaction.

4.115. J April 2005 — A Resolution is made by the Cantonal Unity Assembly of Cotacachi
and the Development and Action Council.'?* It is entitled ‘With a single voice: NO
TO MINING’; and it is signed by Mayor Tituajfia and representatives of the Council.

It merits here citing at length, as one of several turning points during this period:

“... The citizens, legitimate representatives of the communities, organizations
and public entities of Cotacachi Canton, Imbabura Province, Ecuador, that
subscribe the present document do it to make it known to the world, and
particularly to national and transnational mining companies, that it is our

insurmountable decision to PREVENT MINING in the Cotacachi Canton.

The mining companies which intend to sack our natural resources and destroy
our communities, violate our rights, social peace and environment should know
that we will always support the Intag communities in their rejection of mining

activities.

Organized civil society and the Intag and Cotacachi authorities have chosen
sustainable development, framed in solidarity, reciprocity, democratic
principles and involvement, respecting human rights, both individual and
collective and the right of the communities to create and enjoy their own forms
of development and to say NO to projects that may endanger their natural and

socio-cultural wellbeing.

We, therefore, ask Ascendant Exploration S.A., Ascendant Holdings Limited
and subsidiaries and representatives to leave our Canton, within 30 days.
Ascendant Exploration S.A. has never consulted or asked the potentially

affected communities’ consent to develop its projects.

Equally, it has not consulted or informed the Cotacachi Municipality of its
plans and activities nor requested the corresponding municipal authorization.

It has created, however, a vile setting in which the violation of our rights

28 R-77; Zorrilla WS 1 para 64.

PART 4 — Page 32 of 101

commands, it has tried to divide us, threaten us, [with] intimidations and law

suits against the villagers and a community newspaper.

To avoid more problems of this kind, we request the Central Government,

through the Ministry of Energy and Mines to:

1) Respect the independence and autonomy of Cotacachi Canton’s

local governments.

2) Abstain from violating human rights recognized in the Political
Constitution of Ecuador and especially those that guarantee the right to
prior consultations in connection with the exploitation of non-renewable

natural resources and that may affect our environmental and social rights.

3) Respect the rights of citizens to live in a contamination-free and
ecologically balanced environment as guaranteed by Article 86 of

the Constitution.

4) Once and for all, refrain from granting mining concessions in Cotacachi
Canton and revoke those that have not been authorized by the Cotacachi
Municipality nor have obtained consent by the communities which would

be affected by mining activities, including exploration.”

The Tribunal notes that the address to the Ascendant companies to leave the Junin area
within thirty days is phrased as a request; but the anti-mining policy is
uncompromisingly expressed. The Tribunal also notes that those signing this resolution

perceive the Government in Quito (including MEM) as pro-mining.

4.116. Around I April 2005 — Mr Giovanni Rosania is appointed as the general manager of
AE.!”° He had previous experience as the head of another copper project. In the
Tribunal’s view, as later events would demonstrate, his appointment was another
turning point.

General Commander, '*? CODEGAM requests military intervention in the area of

Cotacachi “in the most restrained form”. The letter is signed by (inter alios)

Mr Andrade.

4.118. 4 April 2005 — By letter to Mr Andrade (as President of CODEGAM), Mr Sixto Erazo
(as “trustee of the La Armenia Community”) denounces Mr Muifioz (the President of
La Armenia) for signing the declaration of 7 March 2005 (see above) because it goes
“against the interest and wishes of the majority of the Armenia community, constituted
by ten families of which seven want development [i.e. mining]’. '7! Similar
documents are sent by persons in Magdalena (6 April) and Chalguayacu Bajo (6 April).

The 11 April 2005 Incident

4.123. According to Mr Zorilla’s account, Mr Andrade, General Villacis and AE’s new
general manager (Mr Rosania) gathered some 150 people to take them to the Cotacachi
municipality in buses rented by AE.'*? The demonstrators were deployed in front of
the town hall to show fierce opposition to Mayor Tituafia’s disapproval of AE’s mining
projects. They forced an entry to the town hall and held the Mayor hostage for several
hours.

4.124. Mr Davis testified differently as to this incident.'** He was not present. He was
informed by Mr Rosania that none of the disorderly conduct was organized or
sanctioned by AE itself. He also testified the manner in which CODEGAM’s members
conducted themselves was not consistent with the behaviour that Ascendant Copper
expected from its contractors. He also learned that some of AE’s funds had not been
used properly. As a result, Mr Davis decided to terminate General Villacis’
employment with AE. '4°

There is no doubt that this incident can be attributed to the Claimant, albeit to AE and
its local agents in Ecuador, particularly Mr Rosania and General Villacis with Mr
Andrade. There is equally no doubt that Mr Davis’ horrified reaction was sincere: it
was, on any view, a negative development for Ascendant Copper’s mining project in

in the Junin area, if not also elsewhere in Ecuador.

23 April 2005 — Representatives of AE meet with Mayor Tituafia of Cotacachi.'#°

Mr Davis referred to two meetings in April 2005, including a meeting on 23 April
2005. He testified that thereafter the Mayor refused to meet or enter into dialogue with

them personally. That was, perhaps, hardly surprising.

23 April 2005 — A Resolution is passed by the General Assembly of CODEGAM.'*”
It resolves to ask Ascendant Copper to suspend discussions with the Municipality of
Cotacachi and that it should negotiate with CODEGAM and the Intag communities as
the lawful representatives of the region. CODEGAM denies the authority of Mayor
Tituafia of Cotacachi and demands that he refrains from acting in a manner contrary to
the development of the mining project in Junin. It also demands that Mr Pérez (of
DECOIN) and Mr German Flores be declared persona non grata; and that Mr Zorrilla
and others be expelled from the country. The declaration is signed by a large number
of persons, including Mr Andrade, Ms Morales, Mr Pasquel, Mr Yamouch and Mr

Cousin.

Mr Davis testified that the content of the resolution was one of the things he would not
tolerate. '? Yet CODEGAM’s resolution was published on Ascendant Copper’s
website on 29 April 2005.'°° Mr Davis took no action at the time to indicate his strong

disapproval of the resolution.!°'! Mr Davis was an experienced manager; and the

Tribunal does not doubt his sincerity. It is therefore driven to the conclusion that Mr

Davis cannot have then fully understood the worsening gravity of the situation in
Junin, to which his company’s money and local personnel had substantially

contributed.

29 April 2005 — An employee of AE allegedly delivers a notice from CODEGAM to
an aid worker at Magdalena Bajo which says: “‘you’re not welcome here; people is
ready, and you are warned.”!>? It is also alleged that CODEGAM personnel seek to
assault and kidnap a French citizen working on a development project in the Junin

area. '* (These may be the same incident).

4 May 2005 — A group from Whistler Consultants (EIS experts to Ascendant Copper),
with Mr Rosania, try and fail to gain access to Junin for the purpose of undertaking
preparatory work for the EIS required for the Golden 1 and Golden 2 concessions. !**
After Magnolia, before Junin, their car is stopped by a barrier across the road, a
wooden pole with a counterweight locked with a padlock. Villagers come, with two
aggressive young foreigners probably alerted by DECOIN. The group is eventually
asked to leave. Mr Davis testified that Whistler Consultants had expected to have a
draft EIS prepared by mid-July 2005 and to submit it by the end of July 2005. (Whistler

Consultants were later replaced by Terrambiente Consultants in September 2005).!°°

9 May 2005 — MEM sends a letter to Ascendant Copper recording that MEM supports
the preparation of the EIS for the Golden 1 and 2 concessions.'*° The letter also refers
to the local communities approving the performance of these studies at the meeting on
5 March 2005 in Garcia Moreno, attended by MEM (see above). Its terms are
unambiguously supportive of the Junin project; and the letter was doubtless drafted for

local publication in Junin. Thus, the Government in Quito remains pro-mining.

12 May 2005 — Mayor Tituaiia of Cotacachi files an extraordinary administrative claim

with MEM requesting the nullification of the Junin concessions. !*”

incident of 11 April 2005.'** Mr Rosanja writes that he had no participation in the
declaration of support for Ascendant Copper that was organized by CODEGAM. It is
not possible to square his explanation with the other evidence adduced before the
Tribunal. It is however probable that the contents of his letter influenced Mr Davis
favourably as regards Mr Rosanja’s dealings in the Junin area (Mr Davis being absent

in Canada).

June 2005 — Mr Rosania (of AE) sends an email message to Mr Davis, stating that six
landowners had been threatened by DECOIN: they would be “beaten” if they sold their
land to AE under its program for land acquisition. However, they were still willing to
sell their land to AE, which would facilitate AE’s access to the concession area using

the road to Barcelona and Cerro Pelado.'®

June 2005 — AE formally terminates the employment of General Villacis; and
ostensibly it suspends its relationship with CODEGAM.'®” Mr Davis testified that in
a good faith effort to respond to the allegations of intimidation against AE, he replaced
General Villacis as manager of community relations.' Mr Davis also testified that
CODEGAM was not created by AE and did not act as AE’s agent: it was an
independent organisation that gave voice to members of the community that supported
mining; whilst AE at first relied on CODEGAM to direct its financing for social
services and community development initiatives, by June 2005 Mr Davis had imposed
strict limits and conditions on such financing to ensure that its funding was not used
for political activities. ©? Mr Davis at first testified that he believed that CODEGAM
was fully authorized to act on behalf of the local governments in the Junin area.”
Later, in his oral testimony, Mr Davis withdrew that statement. 7! He was right to do

so.

4 June 2005 — The populations of Cerro Pelado, Junin, El Triunfo, Villaflora, Cuaravi,
La Armenia, Cazarpamba and Barcelona express opposition to Ascendant Copper’s

mining plans for Junin.!7

23 June 2005 — Ascendant Copper issues its preliminary prospectus for an Initial
Public Offering.'” It states (inter alia): “In 2004 Ascendant began a socialization
program to introduce Ascendant and its plans for the Junin project, to determine what
support existed for the Junin project, and to determine the priorities of local
communities ... CODEGAM is thought to be comprised of the majority of Garcia
Moreno Parish communities, being 34 of a total of 38 recognized communities that
could be most significantly impacted by exploration and development activities on the
Junin property.”!* Also: “To date, Ascendant’s community relations programs have
been met with mixed results. CODEGAM has advised Ascendant that 34 of the
approximate 38 communities that could be locally impacted by development of the
Junin property support and are in favour of Ascendant’s plans for proceeding with
exploration of the property. There exists, however, within the Imbabura Province a

vocal faction opposing any exploration or development of the Junin project.”!7>

25 June 2005 — Mr Davis travels to Junin and meets Mr Pérez and others.!”° The
meeting was filmed, apparently by DECOIN. It shows Mr Davis taking a conciliatory
approach. Mr Davis states there is no doubt in his mind that the company had made
mistakes to this point; and he expresses his apologies if there had been threats and
abuses.'”” He accepts that Ascendant Copper had funded CODEGAM and that the
latter had done things with its money which Ascendant Copper would not tolerate. He
refuses to identify the amount of funding provided by Ascendant Copper, as being an
internal company matter. He says CODEGAM was originally set up as a clearing
house for community input. The meeting lasts for about one hour; but none of Mr
Davis’ explanations of the proposed development are shown in the video made by
DECOIN.!”8 During his oral evidence, Mr Davis testified: “The [video] footage, if it

says that what is stated, that I apologized for wrong doing, that is incorrect. I said if

there had been any wrongdoing or any abuses, for that I was sorry. I had no knowledge
whatsoever that there had been [any wrongdoing]”.'”” Mr Davis went on to say that
CODEGAM had been trying to divide the community — that was something which his

company did not stand for and was not in the interest of the company. '*°

In the Tribunal’s view, having seen and heard Mr Davis as an oral witness in this
arbitration, it is highly unlikely that Mr Davis was seeking at this meeting to deceive
Mr Pérez and his colleagues. It is also highly likely that Mr Davis was not fully
informed as to what had actually taken place in the Junin area, attributed (rightly or
wrongly) to his company and its predecessors-in-title. Mr Davis, so the Tribunal
decides on the evidence available, was genuinely trying at this meeting to calm down
what had become a difficult situation for his company, with the sincere intention of
starting anew its relations with the affected communities of the Junin area. He also
genuinely believed that the Junin project could benefit these communities as a whole.
Unfortunately, given the events that had already transpired, members of those
communities did not believe or trust him or the company and remained resolutely anti-

mining.

July 2005 — A technical report on the Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession by Micon

International (UK) is prepared for Ascendant Copper. '*!

12 July 2005 — MEM decides that it lacks jurisdiction to hear the nullification claim

made by Mayor Tituafia on 12 May 2005 (see above).

21 July 2005 — Mr Davis (for Ascendant Copper) writes a letter to CODEGAM
referring to his meeting with its executive council on 24 June 2015 (during his visit to
Ecuador). He states that any future projects using company funds would be carefully
reviewed in advance; and he sets out a list of approved and prohibited activities for
which funds, respectively, could and could not be used by CODEGAM. Ascendant
Copper’s monthly payments are now to be limited to US$1,000 for “general
administrative expenses”, with further funding to be justified and approved by

Ascendant Copper in advance.

Mr Davis also gives an example of his company’s funds having been previously mis-
used by CODEGAM:!*? “We would like to again remind CODEGAM’s members that
we contracted to rebuild 11.5 kilometers road from Loma Negra-La Magnolia-Garcia
Moreno. It disturbs us greatly that we paid over $250,000 for its completion, but less
than 5.5 kilometers was finished and even the portion that was completed did not meet
the technical specifications under the contract. Payment was made in full under the
contract and we can make available all receipts for audit if CODEGAM wants to
pursue completion of this road. We now understand that the road should not have cost
more than $ 150,000 to complete. This is a perfect example of a project where a few
people benefited at the expense of the communities. It is our understanding that
the contracting company was introduced to us by General Villacis and is either
owned by his son or he is a partner in it. Furthermore, General Villacis later
demanded more funds from the Company to complete the road. Our question is, if
the road should only have cost approximately $150,000, why wasn’t it completed
and where did the money go? The Company would appreciate receiving assistance
from CODEGAM’s Council in investigating this road and putting pressure on the road
contractor to make it right with the communities by finishing the road according to the
specifications of the contract. At this point, we do not expect the road will survive the

rainy season. We will not allow this kind of conflict of interest in the future ...”

10 August 2005 — A legal opinion of the State Attorney General in Quito is addressed
to Mayor Tituafia of Cotacachi.'*? It states that a breach of the consultation obligations
established by the State would not serve as grounds for nullification of a mining title

or concession rights, but only for a suspension in the exercise of such activities.

US$9.2 million. Ascendant Copper raises an additional US$19 million in private

public offering on 22 June 2007.'°

22 November 2005 — Ascendant Copper’s shares are listed for trading on the Toronto

serve as chairman of the company until the end of 2007, holding approximately 13%
of the shares in Ascendant Copper until September 2009. '°* Mr Davis continued as the

company’s chief executive.)

December 2005 — There is increasing conflict between anti-miners and pro-miners in
the Junin area. At a community meeting, over 300 local residents vote “to burn down

aggressive tactics employed by [Ascendant Copper/AE]”.!%

2005 - Summary: At some stage towards the end of 2005 and early 2006, it appears
that Ascendant Copper (with AE) decided upon a different strategy to solve its
difficulties in Junin. Conciliation had failed to achieve what Mr Davis had sought
earlier in 2005. Ascendant Copper’s conciliatory approach to DECOIN had been met
with an increased and more active opposition from the anti-miners in the Junin area
and DECOIN itself. Even more serious was the new threat of violence to Ascendant
Copper’s personnel and properties in the Junin area, which (as all knew) had an ugly
precedent in the forced departure of Bishimetal in 1997, only eight years earlier. As to
reliance upon assistance from CODEGAM to gain more local support, that risked only
more trouble for Ascendant Copper and AE: CODEGAM, particularly with Mr
Andrade, was directly responsible for increasing, not decreasing, the conflict between
pro-miners and anti-miners for which Ascendant Copper was being held responsible
amongst the divided communities in Junin. As for the Government in Quito, it
remained pro-mining and supportive of Ascendant Copper and its concessions in

Junin. For Ascendant Copper and AE, however, that was not enough.

3 January 2006 — Between 3 January 2006 and 5 October 2006, 18 individuals sell
land in Garcfa Moreno and Pefiaherrera to Ascendant Copper.!°* These individuals had
been granted the land by the National Institute for Agricultural Development
(“INDIA”). Accordingly an issue arose as to the legality of their onward sales to
Ascendant Copper which was later investigated for unlawful land trafficking by the
Respondent’s Civic Corruption Control Commission. In its report of 18 July 2007, the
Commission also listed 56 purchases by Ascendant Copper and its predecessors-in-
title between 2005 and 2006 in La Florida, Las Palmas, Chalguayacu Alto, Junin, Alto
Mira, Cerro Pelado, Barcelona, Chontal Alto, San Edmundo, San Juan, Mirador and

Monopamba, totalling 2,752.4 hectares with additional rights over 166 hectares.'* As

to the 18 sales, the Commission recommended their reversal on the ground of unlawful

speculation.

March 2006 — Mr Davis is informed by an attaché to the Canadian Embassy in Quito
that the Under-Secretary of Mines, Carlos Murriagui, had expressed strong support for

that he was fully behind Ascendant Copper and intended to approve the Junin EIS once

it was completed and reviewed by MEM.?°?

March 2006 — Mr Zorrilla meets Mr Andrade. Mr Andrade proposes that CODEGAM
supporters join the local anti-mining organisations opposing AE. Mr Zorrilla turns
down the proposal. During this meeting Mr Andrade allegedly gave to Mr Zorrilla a
bag containing confidential AE document. (i

interest and not acting for AE.

Lucero, Edmundo Lucero, Victor Hugo Ramirez and Marcia Ramirez. Local police

officers intervene to prevent the two being taken to the community of Junin.?°

9 March 2006 — Ascendant Copper issues a news release to the Toronto Stock
Exchange.”°° It records the reclogging of core samples at the Junin concessions,
confirming the presence of a large porphyry copper, hydrothermal system; the
appointment of an expert geologist (Mr King); the completion of “the initial draft of
the [EIS]”; and the commencement of “the process of obtaining comments from
representatives of the community and the local governments, prior to submitting the

EIS to the Ecuadorian Ministry of Energy and Mines for final approval”.
As to such consultation, the news release states:

“Unfortunately, this consultation process is being contested by a small but
vocal faction of the community that does not want mineral exploration or
development of any kind in the area. Last week, in two separate incidents, five
persons -- four of whom are contracted to the Company, as well as one
government official -- were detained for up to eight hours. ‘It is believed that
several of the people who may have been responsible for these actions were
also involved in the destruction of the Company’s medical clinic and
demonstration farm in December 2005,’ said Davis. In response to these
activities, five arrest orders have been issued by the local authorities and should
be served within the next few days. The Ecuadorian Ministry of Energy and
Mines has promised its full support in seeing that law and order is restored and
maintained in the region. ‘While these acts are unfortunate, they are acts of a
small and distinct minority in the region,’ said Davis. “We will continue to
finish the EIS and submit it to the Ministry in order to obtain the drilling permits
necessary to take advantage of the upcoming summer season. The vast majority
of the people in these communities want this project - which is committed to
adhering to best industry practices on environmental and social matters -- to
move forward, and they recognize the many economic, as well as

environmental, benefits to the region that will result from it,’ concluded Davis.”

23 March 2006 — By letter, Ascendant Copper informs MEM that the modified terms

5 April 2006 — By letter, MEM informs AE that it is insufficient to disseminate the
terms of reference for the EIS on the Internet.””* Mr Guevara testified that he drafted
that letter (albeit that it was signed by the Under-Secretary). In his testimony, he
explained that the local population had little or no access to the internet. Accordingly,
as the law required, AE was to arrange for information centres to be opened onsite to
provide the information to the local communities. (Between the end of March 2006
and 30 April 2006, Ascendant Copper opens two public information centres in Garcia

Moreno to disseminate the terms of reference for the EIS).7!°

terms of reference at the office and sees that AE personnel are available to respond to

affected areas should be notified by courier or through a notary. Only one office had
been used to disseminate the terms of reference; and this had been considered
sufficient.2!>_ Mr Jurika testified that AE had to close the first of the two offices

Secretary for Environmental Protection writes, having referred to threats from
“ecologists” forcing the closure one information office, as already cited above: “...
Likewise, I support ASCENDANT COPPER in regards to attacks on personnel and
private property (burning of the camp, kidnapping of personnel, car theft) that are
being performed by people that claim to protect the environment and its surroundings,
but that use processes contrary to the norms and laws of the Republic of Ecuador to
carry this out.” The Government thus remains pro-mining and supportive of Ascendant

Copper and its concessions in Junin.

for the Junin concessions.7!®

From this and other accounts (including the film “Under Rich Earth”)””° it is clear that
some form of staged incident certainly took place; and the criminal complaint

do. However, the evidence is inconclusive as to whether this incident can be attributed

to Ascendant Coppe fii ES As later events show, H&L

such people say does not necessarily make it tru Moreover,
it is most unlikely that Mr Davis would have approved of such a manoeuvre, even if
he had known of it in advance. However, at the time, there is no doubt that anti-miners

attributed this provocative incident to Ascendant Copper, rightly or wrongly.

3 May 2006 — Ascendant Copper workers are physically attacked by anti-miners whilst
taking water samples from a river on the property of Luis Vallejos; and their equipment
is stolen. Ascendant Copper identifies the perpetrators as Edmundo Lucero, Julio

Espinoza, Victor Hugo Ramirez, Elsa Piedra and Carmen Ramirez.?7!

20 May 2006 — A meeting takes place of the Area Assembly in Garcia Moreno. 7°? Mr
Andrade, ostensibly, speaks out against mining in the Junin area. iy

Mid 2006 — AE creates a parallel coffee seller’s association, “APCT’, to rival the
existing anti-mining Association of Coffee Producers of Rio Intag (which had been
established in 1998: see above).?*4 Mr Cueva (the latter’s technical director) testified
that APCI was run by Ciro Benalcazar and Magdalena Flores, both employees of AE,

and that it was buying coffee from producers at enhanced prices funded by AE.??>

Summer 2006 — Mr Veintimilla becomes the general manager of AE in Quito.”°
Beforehand, he had been in charge of community relations since 2005. In the
Tribunal’s view, his appointment was another significant watershed in the

development of AE’s strategy towards the anti-miners.

June 2006 — Mr Jurika becomes Ascendant Copper’s Vice-President of Corporate
Development.?”’ (For the year and a half before June 2006 Mr Jurika had no role in
the management of the company;?”* and Mr Grist was to be no longer involved after
leaving his position as a director in June 2006).”?° Mr Jurika is to spend much of his

time in Ecuador and works with Mr Veintimilla, the general manager of AE.?°°

Summer 2006: Mr Davis testified that, because of the attacks on AE’s workers, he
decided that AE should retain the services of, in his words, an internationally

recognized and respected security provider — Honour & Laurel (“H&L”):

“Initially, the company looked to local police authorities for protection.
However, over time, we discovered that the Ecuadorian government did not
give the local police sufficient resources to adequately protect our employees
and contractors. As we did not permit any of our own employees to carry any
weapons, Ascendant Ecuador eventually concluded that it had no alternative
but to retain professional security guards. These security guards were retained
solely to protect Ascendant Ecuador’s legal property and the physical security

of its employees and contractors.”?*!

To Mr Davis’ knowledge, guards employed by H&L would be armed; but he trusted
in H&L’s judgment and discipline. However, although AE retained H&L, it had no
direct contractual relationship with Segurivital (engaged by H&L) whose armed
guards were involved in the subsequent altercations with anti-mining groups, as

described below.

Again, the question arises whether Mr Davis in Canada was kept fully informed of
actual events in Ecuador. It is highly improbable, if he had been fully informed, that

he would have approved of the steps now being planned by AE in Quito, with H&L.

June 2006 — In an internal document, Ascendant Copper summarises its “activities” as

at June 2006.?* It merits citing here in full:

“The Company:

Acquired the 9,500 hectares within the Golden 1, Golden 2, and Magdalena
Concessions in 2004.

Purchased an additional 3,400 hectares of private at a cost of $2 million.
Social Effort to date:

1-hired two doctors and have seen over 1,000 patients (two thirds children)
2-hired a dentist and have done over 800 dental examinations

3-hired a veterinarian and have vaccinated over 2,500 cattle

4-built three nurseries and are raising a variety of plants, crops and seeds
5-planted over 6,000 trees for reforestation efforts

6-Hired over 70 people to do road work, farm experiments, and environmental
monitoring

Accordingly, as at June 2006, Ascendant Copper was ‘hoping’ to begin drilling in
September 2006; and both for that operation and to complete the “EIS process”, AE
required access to the Junin concessions — but that essential access was, so it

considered, “denied ... by radical NGO groups.”

3 June 2006 — A violent incident occurs in the Garcia Moreno Assembly, attributed to

Ascendant Copper (see below).?*°

6 June 2006 — By letter to Mr Davis (with attachments), MEM deplores the escalation
of violence in Junin, for which it holds Ascendant Copper “exclusively
responsible”.?*° MEM also refers to the incident on 3 June 2006 in the Garcia Moreno
Assembly. It states that once Ascendant Copper complies with all its commitments, as
well as social and environmental agreements concluded with the local communities,
and only then, will MEM deal with any request for intervention. To the Tribunal’s
understanding, this is the first suggestion to Ascendant Copper that MEM was not fully

supporting Ascendant Copper against anti-miners in the Junin area.

MEM) visits all three offices. He requests to see letters of invitation to the local
communities directly affected (in particular Barcelona).*! These invitations were not
provided to him, save only documents showing an invitation to representatives of

Apuela.?>>

Mr Jurika testified that he attended meetings at these offices on a regular basis where
he and others presented the EIS. He says a total of 368 people attended the office in
Garcia Moreno and 261 people the office in Apuela. Of these, 104 were from the
smaller villages of Chalguayacu Bajo, Chalguayacu Alto, Cerro Pelado, Magnolia,
Alta Mira and Barcelona.?* Only 16 people attended from Cotacachi. He discussed
the consultation process with Mr Guevara, who never suggested to him at the time that
there were any deficiencies in the EIS consultations. To the contrary, Mr Guevara told
him on several occasions that he was very pleased with how AE was carrying out the
process and felt that the company was exceeding its legal obligations. Mr Guevara also
told him that AE were doing an excellent job; and that Mr Guevara never mentioned

any inadequacy of notices given to local communities in Garcia Moreno. >>+

Later, Mr Stonehouse was to join Ascendant Copper in January 2007, as its Vice-
President, Exploration. Although relating to a later period (after the incidents of
December 2006 described below), Mr Stonehouse also testified on AE’s consultation
process in the Junin area:?°° AE had carried out consultations in Apuela and Garcia
Moreno, but MEM had asked that individuals from seven or so smaller communities
be addressed particularly or individually, either in Garcia Moreno or in their own
communities. Mr Stonehouse testified: “We couldn’t do the consultation work until

2 August 2006 — By letter complaining of DECOIN’s misleading statements on its
website, Mr Davis confirms to Mr Zorrilla that Ascendant Copper does not have any
relationship with CODEGAM, which had been suspended in June 2005 and “fully and
formally” terminated in February 2006.7°’ Mr Davis also confirms that Ascendant
Copper was committed to coordination with local law enforcement forces and to

promote the rule of law.

23 August 2006 — Ms Chaplin initiates criminal proceedings for theft and injury against
Mr Zorrilla,?°* accusing him of having stolen her video camera and US $500 in cash
and having organised a group of people to assault her during the anti-mining
demonstration outside MEM on 13 July 2006. These proceedings led to a court order
for Mr Zorrilla’s detention, a search of Mr Zorrilla’s home where illegal drugs were
“found”; and his temporary exile from Ecuador.?*? The proceedings were eventually
dismissed by the Ecuadorian courts in June 2008, which described the complaint as
“malicious and reckless”.? It was indeed malicious and clearly intended to side-line
Mr Zorrilla from his anti-mining activities in the Junin area, together with certain of

his anti-mining colleagues accused as co-conspirators in the (staged) theft and assault.

Mr Davis testified that he had never met Ms Chaplin; and that she did not work for
Ascendant Copper.”°! However, Ms Chaplin was working for H&L in Quito. Ill

Andrade’s statements can be given any credence. Mr Andrade was by now, more than

Mr Andrade’s bad reputation amongst them. Nor did it.

Mid-September to December 2006: From this point onwards, the evidence of certain
events is unclear (including precise dates and times), given the different accounts given
its several participants, only a few of which testified before the Tribunal. It is manifest
that the full story of these events has not been made available to the Tribunal, for one
reason or another. Yet, it is equally manifest that certain of these events affected

critically the fate of the concessions in Junin.

12 September 2006 — This incident is alleged by Ascendant Copper to have taken place
on 12 September 2006, when seven of Ascendant Copper’s employees and contractors,
working on Ascendant Copper’s lands, were kidnapped and taken hostage by 20-30

anti-mining activists. 7”?

Two employees escaped and three were released the
following day. The remaining two were released on [Saturday] 16 September 2006, in
Ascendant Copper’s words at the time: “thanks to the overwhelming support and
intervention of the [Ecuadorian] Federal Government, state and local police, and the
communities: By Saturday, over 60 police officers from the Province of Imbabura
along with over 300 local community representatives pressured the 30 or so radicals
to unilaterally release the final two hostages.” Ascendant Copper also reports that, by
19 September 2006, two of the kidnappers had been arrested, arraigned and were in
prison awaiting sentencing. (This appears to be the same incident as that reported by
Ascendant Copper in a later document as taking place on 13 September 2006: see

below. The exact date is not material).

13 September 2006 — According to Ascendant Copper, its employees were forced at
knifepoint and machete to stay the night at Cerro Pelado and then taken to Junin.?”4
These employees had been working on Ascendant Copper’s land taking coordinates.
Some of the employees were released the following day; but two were kept in captivity
and released only on 16 September 2006. Mr Davis testified that these employees were

severely beaten by Mr Pérez and his anti-mining supporters, identified by name.”

20 September 2006 — Compaiiia Minera DosRios SA is incorporated in Ecuador. Its
shareholders are Ascendant Copper (Barbados) Corporation (4999 shares) and

Ascendant Copper (1 share).?””

October 2006: The date for Ascendant Copper’s drilling intended for September 2006
now lies in the past. Essential access for that operation to the Junin concession remains
effectively blocked by anti-miners; and Ascendant Copper’s situation is becoming
more, not less, difficult. Ascendant Copper decides upon a new policy of confrontation
with the anti-mining communities in the Junin area, so as to force the issue once and
for all. There is also an imminent presidential election (in November 2006) where the
new president (taking office in January 2007) might be significantly less supportive of

private mining concessions in Ecuador. Much of what is described below, until

written (or updated) in Quito after the events described in the report:?*+

“BACKGROUND.-

The entry into and physical occupation of the lands that are property of

ASCENDANT COPPER, is planned in two phases:

The first phase, under the responsibility of Fernando Alba, contemplated the
entry onto the company’s lands in the sector of Junin, utilising the Chalguayacu
Alto-Junin road, along with personnel from the sector. Additionally, through
Falericorp, the private security company Segurivital is hired, which had the
specific function of discouraging any attempt at forced entry onto private

property once the lands were taken over.

The second phase, under the responsibility of Wilmer Fuertes, consisted of
seizing the lands, which are property of the company in the sector of Cerro
Pelado, utilising a helicopter in order to mobilize workers of the agricultural
company, Falericorp, and a group of Segurivital’s (private security company)

personnel.
DEVELOPMENT.-
Saturday December 2.

02:00 a.m.: Entry into Junin by a group of 30 locals and 20 private security

guards.

04:00 a.m.: Upon passing through the community of Junin there was strong
opposition to the entry by anti-mining groups, which results in a light
confrontation with the group marching towards the properties, ending with the

detention of 30 people, among employees and security guards of the company.

05:00 a.m.: A group of 6 people reach the company’s lands (old properties

belonging to Mr Garzon), where they remain for the next 6 days.

08:00 a.m.: In a second attempt to enter onto the lands, a group of
approximately 30 people, made up of locals and security guards,

reorganizes itself.

Upon reaching the sector of Junin, the opposition was no longer conformed by
only local residents, but there was a well organised group of opponents from
Junin, Cotacachi, and Manabi, as well as foreigners with Colombian accents
and other foreigners who spoke English. (The latter were the ones carrying

video cameras who caught the confrontation on tape.)

On the network of public roads in the sector of Junin there was a brief dialogue
between the opposition and security guard personnel, which was interrupted by
gunfire of the opposition. This in turn triggered a response by the guards, which

was to fire shots in the air.

This confrontation, which was considered as one of the possible scenarios, and
for which clear and precise NON AGRESSION guidelines were rendered,
occurs as a result of inevitable circumstances, in which the guards had no
choice but to react using firearms. It is worth noting that there were no wounded
or fatalities during this confrontation, which demonstrates that even though the
use of force was inevitable, the guidelines for preserving people’s integrity,
established by Falericorp, were not ignored, regardless of whether those

involved were either pro- or anti-mining.

06:00 pm: The opposition frees the 30 people detained in Junin during the early

morning hours.
Second Phase:
Saturday December 2.

10:00 a.m.: A helicopter flies over the sector of Cerro Pelado, due to adverse
weather conditions air entry into the company’s properties was not achievable

that day.

PART 4 — Page 61 of 101

4.216.

08:00 p.m.: The march to reach the company’s properties in the sector of Cerro
Pelado begins with a group of 57 people; 40 Falericorp workers and 17 security

guards.
Sunday December 3.

02:00 a.m.: The company’s properties are reached (old properties belonging to

Mr Vasquez), and the group remains on-site for the next 48 hours.

During this time, basic infrastructure tasks were carried out, such as enclosing

the area with barbed wire and the use of a perimeter security device.
Tuesday December 5:

08:30 a.m.: A group of approximately 150 people, armed with shotguns, 9mm
pistols, .38 caliber revolvers and sophisticated communications equipment,
headed up by Polibio Pérez, surround the precarious encampment, and in a
show of force in terms of personnel and armament, threaten Falericorp
personnel, whom after various struggles and threats by members of the

opposition, back down and peacefully surrender their weapons.

It is worth noting that they followed the non-aggression guidelines. We must
remember that the presence of the guards was meant as a deterrent to any

attempt at forced entry onto private property, once the lands were taken over.

Following this peaceful surrender, they were then taken hostage and led to

Junin, where they were held at the church until Sunday December 10.
Sunday December 10.

08:00 p.m.: The hostages are freed by the Under-Secretary of the Environment,

and National Police forces.”

In the Tribunal’s view, this contemporary account broadly establishes the general plan
intended by AE, with H&L and Falericorp, in its several phases. It also describes the
total failure of that plan. The account is otherwise a sanitised, self-serving and
materially incomplete version of the relevant events. It is therefore necessary to

describe in some detail other available evidence, resuming the chronology as at mid-

October 2006.

16-17 October 2006 — On 16 October 2006, as a result of the criminal complaint by
Ms Chaplin, the Pichincha Court orders Mr Zorrilla’s detention and issues a search
warrant for his house. 7°° On 17 October 2006, 19 armed policeman break into

Mr Zorrilla’s house and “find” drugs and a gun (Mr Zorrilla, forewarned, has already

fled the scene).”*°

26 October 2006: Telimbela acquires an option from Ecuadorgold to acquire the

Telimbela concession.”

27 October 2006 — A “usufruct agreement” is made between Faleriocorp S.A. (as the
beneficiary) and Ascendant Copper (as the landowner),”° by Mr Veintimilla for
Ascendant Copper and Mr Jorge Mantilla German (Captain Mantilla) for Falericorp.
It provides (inter alia) that Ascendant Copper “voluntarily assumes all of the costs of
the initial implementation activities, the research activities and the first agricultural
labors” and will pay Falericorp US$ 39,298 per month “in the form of a non-
reimbursable loan”. The contractual term runs to 30 November 2008, subject to the
Parties’ further agreement to extend the term; but Ascendant Copper has the right to
terminate the agreement at any time. It records that the usufruct agreement “‘is given

for free, because it suits the mutual interests of the contracting parties.”

Mr Davis testified that Ascendant Copper wanted to put its farmlands to productive
use and therefore granted Falericorp a usufruct on its lands.?*! In the Tribunal’s view,
given the terms of the agreement and the circumstances in which it was made, the
agreement was not a genuine agreement intended only for farming. Rather, it was part
of the charade upon which Ascendant Copper was now engaged in seeking access to

its Junin concessions. Why else, in particular, would Ascendant Copper as the

landowner, as opposed to Falericorp as the beneficiary, bear the financial burden under
the usufruct agreement? Mr Mantilla appears to have been appointed to his post at
Falericorp on the same day as he made the agreement; and at that time, Falericorp had
no farmworkers.””? Falericorp had been formed on 8 February 2006 as a registered
business “dedicated to activities involved in the transmission of sound, images and
other data for cable information.” 7° Mr Davis testified that Falericorp might have
used Ascendant Copper’s money to pay for security guards; but he acknowledged that
was only his speculation;?”* he did not know that at the company registry Falericorp’s

activities were so described;

and he was not aware that Falericorp had no employees
at the time the usufruct contract was concluded.”*° The question again arises as to the
extent to which Mr Davis was kept fully informed of exactly what AE was planning

in the Junin area, with H&L.

For all practical purposes, the Tribunal concludes that Falericorp was acting as AE’s
creature, to do AE’s bidding as it sought to gain access to the Junin concessions. AE’s
attempt to disguise the true facts was to fool none of the anti-miners; and, indeed, the
failure of that attempted deception made the situation worse for AE and Ascendant

Copper.

shouting ‘we are the people’ as ‘the voice of God’, despite apparent efforts by the
police to keep order.”°** Mr Andrade’s demands (directed at Ascendant Copper as a
condition of its mining project) apparently include: “15 percent of global investments,
25 percent of the income tax and one percent of the company’s profits to be destined
for the Garcia Moreno parish, the area and the province; 80 percent of the company’s

workforce to be made up of area residents and to establish a ‘school of careers related

Cayapas and reforestation of the area.” The Tribunal does not accept that Mr Andrade
was here acting, directly or indirectly, at the behest of Ascendant Copper. His strange
conduct, however devious or deceptive, could not assist but only harm Ascendant
Copper’s interests; and, indeed, Mr Davis testified that he would not tolerate this kind

of incident.”

Mr Jurika denied attending the meeting on 30 October 2006. He testified that he had
left Ecuador the previous day. Moreover, he testified that his objective was to ensure
that there were no confrontations with the anti-miners because the EIS was then under
review by the authorities and any confrontation would be perceived by them
negatively.*°? The Tribunal accepts that Mr Jurika did not attend the meeting of

30 October; nor could he play any active part in the incidents that followed.

they fired tear gas. Another eye-witness (Elena Pantoja) says two gas canisters hit her,
one on the head. There is film of tear gas canisters; and of canisters being given by

This incident was later described in a UN Working Group report, as the reports of an
allegation:*°° “On 1 November 2006, about 40 plain-clothed persons connected with
Ascendant Copper would have made a violent entry into the community of Barcelona
carrying tear gas bombs, 40 machetes, | dagger, and 4 dogs, to threaten the inhabitants.
Eight tear gas bombs would have directly affected five children and four women,
among them one who was pregnant, and an elderly woman. One community member
would have been hit and wounded by a company van. In the presence of the police,
the inhabitants found in the backpacks of the attackers sleeping bags, tents, canned

food, a set of dishes, Ascendant Copper uniforms and other belongings.”

is not accepted as accurate by the Tribunal.

1 November 2006 — MEM notifies Ascendant Copper of deficiencies in its EIS for the
Junin concessions (submitted by Ascendant Copper on 12 September 2008): the EIS
did not attach documents showing that public consultations with all of the affected
communities had taken place.*!° The draft of this letter had already been prepared
within MEM on 30 October 2006, hence its sending had nothing to do with the incident
of 1 November 2006).

10 November 2006 — By letter, Ascendant Copper responds to MEM’s criticisms of its
EIS for insufficient consultation.*!! Ascendant Copper explains that it had tried to
approach the community in Barcelona and sent two employees to deliver invitations,
but that they were prevented from entering the area. Further, Ascendant Copper states
that a leader of the Barcelona community had attended Ascendant Copper’s Apuela
office to ask questions about the project, but had refused to sign the record of his

attendance.

20 November 2006: An agreement is made between Ascendant Copper, ODI, the
Parish Assembly of Garcia Moreno and others. It is signed for Ascendant Copper by
Mr Davis, Mr Jurika and Mr Veintimilla.*!? Ascendant Copper is to contribute US$1
million for the development of Garcia Moreno over four years, as Mr Davis confirmed
in his testimony.*!> Mr Jurika likewise testified: “It was a collective idea of myself and
Francisco [Veintimilla] and Gary [Davis] to work with ODI”, which was using
CODEGAM’s shell but was not CODEGAM:#*!* Ascendant Copper’s idea was to

create a representative body for the development of the community.

uniformed men in bulletproof vests approach a make-shift checkpoint (a chain).>”* It
is on a dirt road where a number of local people are standing, including women and
children. Some of the local people appear to be holding sticks; but there are no guns
visible. Some of the men in uniform appear to be carrying guns. The local people say
that they will wait there until the police arrive. Suddenly one armed man (with black
moustache and black baseball cap on backwards) sprays something into the eyes of
one of the local people. That action does not appear to have been provoked by anyone.
Two other armed men to each side of him do the same. The man in the middle then
reaches for a pistol and fires into the air. The film then shows several of the armed men
firing pistols. The footage then shows women and children leaving the area where the

chain was; and the armed men appear to leave in their trucks.

There is other video footage of the same incident taken from a high vantage point. It
looks down on a group of local people to the left of the chain and a group of uniformed
men to the right of the chain. It also shows one man in uniform spraying something
into the faces of the local people: the man wears his baseball cap backwards and has a
black moustache. There is no obvious provocation by any of the local people. The
video records tens of shots being fired; but only the sound is recorded as the camera is

3-4 December 2006: The film “Under Rich Earth” shows armed men on the upper
slopes of the hill firing down onto persons on the road below. The film also shows that
certain men captured by local villagers in the forest (about 56 in number) also carried
weapons. The armed man who had sprayed tear gas at the chain on 2 December 2008
is shown handing over his bullet proof vest to the villagers.**° The younger man to his
left who also sprayed the local people with tear gas is shown captured.**! The men are
disarmed in the forest by the villagers (led by Mr Pérez) and taken to the church in
Junin where they are held captive.**? There is no violence shown on the video, but the
captured men are clearly very frightened. It would here be inappropriate to use their
filmed statements (or “confessions”) procured in such circumstances; and the Tribunal

places no reliance on such statements.

5 December 2006: The film shows that the captured men are still detained in the church
at Junin. There are also pictures of a tree across a road preventing buses from going
further; and a ditch dug into the road to prevent further access. Mayor Tituajia, the
Governor of Imbabura Province and other officials are in the buses, trying

unsuccessfully to reach Junin.***

Around 6 December 2006: From the hillside above the buses, the film “Under Rich
Earth” shows pro-miners throwing rocks and burning objects down to the people
below.*** There is also film footage of some of the pro-miners firing pistols towards
people below (albeit out of range). There are police accompanying those in the

buses; and policemen climb up the hillside to talk to the pro-miners.

At about this date (or shortly thereafter), Mr Veintimilla of AE is interviewed in Quito
by the producers of the film “Under Rich Earth”, apparently in his office. Speaking to
the camera, he flatly denies that Ascendant Copper had sent any armed men or any
weapons into the Junin area, stating that the men were only agricultural workers.**

This was untrue.

7 December 2006 — By letter to Mr Veintimilla (for AE and Ascendant Copper), MEM
(by its newly appointed Under-Secretary for Environmental Protection, Ms Yolanda
Viteri) refers to the grave confrontations taking place in Junin.**° MEM’: letter reads

in full:

“As is publicly known, in the last few days grave confrontations have taken
place in the communities within the area of influence of the Junin Mining
project, which is under the responsibility of the company you represent, putting

at risk the security and integrity of the inhabitants of the area.

I remind you that before undertaking any mining activity in the concession
areas, an approved Environmental Impact Study shall be in place, in accordance

with the applicable rules.

Therefore, as the environmental authority in charge in the mining sector, this
Subsecretary requires that the company you represent refrain from carrying out

activities until this requirement is fulfilled.”**”

Mr Davis testified that he understood that, without an EIS approved by MEM,
Ascendant Copper was only being precluded from undertaking “mining activities”;
and that MEM was not here indicating that Ascendant Copper was restrained from
carrying other activities, including its community relations program.*** Without an
approved EIS, even before this letter, Ascendant Copper was already precluded from
undertaking mining activities. It was thus a misreading of MEM’s letter, as other
events soon confirmed: MEM was here requiring Ascendant Copper to refrain from
carrying out activities beyond mining activities until its EIS was approved, as the
original Spanish version makes clear (“... se abstenga de realizar actividades ...”).

This was a direct result of the “grave confrontations” taking place in the Junin area.

337 The original Spanish reads: “Como es de conocimiento ptiblico, en los tiltimos dias se han suscitado graves
enfrentamientos en las comunidades del drea de influencia directa del proyecto Minero Junin, a cargo de su
representada, poniendo en riesgo la seguridad e integridad de los habitantes de la zona.

Le recuerdo que previo al inicio de cualquier actividad minera en las 4reas concesionadas, se debe contar con un
Estudio de Impacto Ambiental aprobado por la autoridad competente, de acuerdo a las normas vigentes.

Por lo expuesto. esta Subsecretaria, como autoridad ambiental en el sector minero, requiere que su representada
se abstenga de realizar actividades, hasta que se cumpla con este requisito indispensable.”

4.258. 8 December 2006 — MEM (by its Under-Secretary for Environmental Protection,
Ms Viteri) responds to Ascendant Copper’s letter of 10 November 2006 regarding its

EIS for the Junin concessions. *4° The letter reads (in material part):

“... In this regard, and after reviewing the submitted documentation, it is
evidenced that invitations to the Process to Inform the Public of said project
were made and the Executive Summary delivered to the central authorities of
Quito; invitations were made to sectional authorities and local key players of
the County of Ibarra to the opening of the consultation offices; invitations were
made to the opening of the consultation processes and opening and closing of
the consultation offices in the County of Cotacachi and the Parishes of Garcia
Moreno and Apuela. Nevertheless, once again, there is no record of invitations
to the following communities which, according to the study, are inside the
direct area of influence of the project: Chalguayacu Bajo, Chalguayacu Alto,
Junin, Cerro Pelado, Magnolia and Alta Mira, and the community of Barcelona
which, according to the maps, the social conflict in that area, and the criteria of

the Mining Environmental unit, belong to the direct area of influence.

Therefore, and in accordance with Art. 6.g of the Substitute Instructions for
submitting mining environmental impact studies, contained in Ministerial
Decree 410, published in Official Gazette No. 724 of December 13, 2002, and
the information, required in Official Letter No. 2838 SPA-DINAMI-UAM of
November 1, 2006, was not completed, the Undersecretariat of this Ministry
considers that the study cannot be processed and, therefore, the submitted
documentation must be returned. The holder of the mining rights may initiate
a new process for submitting the study, complying with the applicable
requirements and procedure, in accordance with the instructions and other

applicable regulations ...”

Accordingly, Ascendant Copper could not have its EIS approved by MEM unless and
until it invited appropriate consultations with the communities of Chalguayacu Bajo,

Chalguayacu Alto, Junin, Cerro Pelado, Magnolia, Alta Mira and Barcelona.

Mr Davis and Mr Jurika testified that Ascendant Copper did not consider that any
further consultations were required because residents from these smaller communities
had in fact attended Ascendant Copper’s information centres in the larger communities
of Garcfa Moreno and Apuela. *! However, Ascendant Copper now decided to accede

to MEM’s request and to send invitations to these smaller communities.**?

9 December 2006. MEM’s Environmental Under-Secretary (Ms Viteri) reaches Junin
by helicopter from Quito. She is accompanied by Mr Guevara (of MEM). Mayor
Tituafia and Mr Pérez take her to the church in Junin, where the captured men are still
held. Her principal purpose, as a senior Government official, is to calm the situation
and have the men released. She informs the villagers that MEM had decided that
Ascendant Copper’s EIS was inadmissible for review.*4? The captured men are then

handed over by the villagers to the police, unharmed.

9 December 2006 — According to the film “Under Rich Earth”, a few hours after Ms
Viteri left Junin, Robinson Guachagmira and his father are attacked by 25 pro-miners.
The film shows a man with blood on his face.*“* There are other allegations against
pro-miners which the anti-miners attribute to Ascendant Copper. Also on 9 December
2006,**° when officials were returning from Junin, an armed group attacked the vehicle
carrying Gustavo Leén, the President of the Pefiaherrera Parish Assembly. This
happened close to Garcia Moreno, between 5.30 pm and 6.00 pm, minutes after an
Ascendant Copper vehicle had passed in the direction of Garcia Moreno, from where
the attackers came. At about this time, Mr Pérez (of CDC) receives a death threat whilst

participating in an anti-mining protest.*4°

13 December 2006 — It is announced that Mr Correa has won the Presidential

election.*4”

End December 2006: The film “Under Rich Earth” records local villagers saying that
Ascendant Copper is still carrying out activities in Junin, trying to get agricultural
workers on to its farmland.*#* Don Edmundo Lucero (President of the village of Junin)
says that Ascendant Copper is hiring people from other communities and putting them

on one of its farms. He says that the people (on the farm) have weapons.*"?

2006 - Summary: It is appropriate here to take stock of Ascendant Copper’s position
as at the end of 2006. In brief, the situation for Ascendant Copper in the Junin area,
difficult from the outset, had become significantly worse: Ascendant Copper’s
successive attempts (with AE) at conciliation and confrontation with the anti-miners
had all failed to meet Ascendant Copper’s objectives. The hostility to mining from
anti-miners was now greater in the Junin area than at any time since the forced
departure of Bishimetal almost ten years earlier. The divisions within the local
communities and the social conflicts between anti-miners and pro-miners (with the
latter actively supported by AE and Ascendant Copper) were becoming increasingly
strident, for which Ascendant Copper was being held responsible. MEM, for the first
time, was no longer supporting Ascendant Copper unequivocally: MEM’s rejection of
AE’s EIS for the Junin concessions was problematic: it was not entirely clear how AE
and Ascendant Copper were now to meet successfully MEM’s criticisms regarding
further attempts at consultation with the local communities; and such consultations
were of paramount importance for the EIS. As a result, MEM’s acceptance of AE’s
EIS remained in abeyance; and without such acceptance, the Junin concessions could

not move forward.

Worse than any of this, however, was the reckless escalation of violence which AE
(by itself and by its contractors and sub-contractors) had introduced into the Junin area
in its own name and also that of Ascendant Copper, particularly with the employment
of organised armed men in uniform using tear gas canisters and firing weapons at local
villagers and officials. It was miraculous that no-one had been killed during one or

more of these violent incidents. Certain of the anti-miners were certainly not angels,

as already noted; but Mr Pérez (with CDC) appears to have done his best to restrain
his supporters during these incidents. That could not be said of AE. As a result, AE
and Ascendant Copper had now acquired, irrevocably, a malign reputation for
intimidation, threats, deception, mendacity and violence amongst members of the local
communities in the Junin area. It was a place from which there could be no easy return;
and there was soon to be an important change in the country’s political administration

in Quito, unfavourable to mining concessions.

Early 2007 — AE has now some 240 employees in the Junin area;*° and AE is

responsible for the subsistence of some 700 families.**!

January 2007 — Ascendant Copper recruits James Stonehouse as Vice-President,

Exploration;***

who holds the position until July 2009. Mr Stonehouse knows the
Junin area well and speaks Spanish. He suspected that he was brought in by Ascendant
Copper “to calm things down”.*>* He reported to Mr Davis weekly.*** Mr Pérez’ wife
was Mr Stonehouse’s wife’s favourite cousin.*>> With Mr Veintimilla, Mr Stonehouse
met Lucia Ruiz (MEM’s Under-Secretary for Environmental Protection from 16
January 2007 onwards) soon after he joined Ascendant Copper.**® From that meeting,
it appeared to him that the completion of the additional consultations in the
communities identified by MEM was the last remaining barrier to the approval of the
EIS by MEM. Although there were certain technical requests, in his view, these were
minor (i.e. the taking of additional soil and water samples; and identifying a mysterious

primate in the Junin area).

5 January 2007 — By letter from MEM (Ms Viteri), the Commander of the National
Police is requested to provide the protection sought by the local population of the Junin

area.*8

6 January 2007 — An inspection is carried out by MEM (Mr Guevara and Milton
Carrasco) from its Environmental Mining Unit on Ascendant Copper’s activities in the
Junin area, following complaints that armed men were employed by Ascendant
Copper.**? Their report records the presence of personnel (in civilian clothes) on a
farm operated by Ascendant Copper: 4 older persons and 14 youths one of whom (an
outsider) was carrying a concealed weapon. It recommends notifying the police

authorities, together with a copy of the report.

9 January 2007 — By letter from MEM (Ms Viteri) to AE (Mr Veintimilla) enclosing
the report,*°° MEM reminds Ascendant Copper of its restriction on Ascendant
Copper’s activities in the Junin area: “... I reiterate my decision to remind you that your
principal cannot perform any type of activity derived from its Mining Concession until it
overcomes the existing social problems and the approval of the corresponding
Environmental Impact Study ...” Mr Davis testified that he did not recall seeing this
letter from MEM.*°! Having been shown it, he thought the restriction was limited to
mining activities.*? To the contrary, the restriction applies expressly to all activities
(including agriculture), excepting only the new consultations required by MEM for

Ascendant Copper’s EIS.

11 January 2007 — There is a second inspection carried out by MEM in the Junin area
of Ascendant Copper’s activities on farmland. Its report describes some 25 persons
present at Junin who said they were working for Falericorp on agriculture and
transport, without any specific contract; and also that the unnamed youth with the gun
had left the day before. The report concludes with the need for Ascendant Copper to

be responsible for a more constructive dialogue for all those involved.*

President of Ecuador.

29 January 2007 — Ascendant Copper terminates its relationship with Falericorp.*™
As to its reason for doing so, Mr Davis testified that it would have had to do with the
aggressive nature of their security guards “something that I simply would not
tolerate.” *°° Mr Davis also testified that he had had no direct knowledge of the violent

incidents in November and December 2006.°%

22 February 2007 —‘Anti-miners’ place a chain barrier across the road at Chalguayacu

Bajo.5°7

14 March 2007: About 40-50 anti-miners from Junin and Chalguayacu Alto occupy
the farm “La Florida” in Chalguayacu Bajo owned by Ascendant Copper.** A group
led by Mr Pérez (later joined by Mr Cueva) arrives at about 8.45 am; and the police

arrive at about 4 pm. Ascendant Copper’s personnel are required to leave the farm.*

16 March 2007 — Negotiations between anti-mining representatives (including
Mr Pérez and Mr Cueva), pro-mining representatives, Ascendant Copper and MEM
take place at the La Florida farm. Ms Ruiz (MEM’s Under-Secretary for
Environmental Protection) testified that, although she did not attend the negotiations,
it was there agreed that Ascendant Copper would evaluate the list of company
personnel and would propose a substantial reduction; the communities would hand
over weapons they had taken from the armed men in December 2006; they would no
longer block access to the concession area; they would vacate Ascendant Copper’s

land; and both sides were to act peacefully thereafter.*”°

20 March 2007 — This agreement is recorded in the “tri-partite commitment
agreements” agreed between (i) the national and regional governmental authorities
(including MEM and the Provincial Police) and CDC (represented by Mr Pérez); and

(ii) those same authorities and Ascendant Copper (represented by Mr Veintimilla).*”!

The local community thereby agrees to release weapons seized on 4 December 2006
and to allow free transit; and Ascendant Copper agrees to decrease the number of its
personnel in Junin and Garcia Moreno (consisting of agricultural workers,

environmental monitors and health promoters) from 159 to 48.

complies with the orders given by the authorities:

- In accordance with the law, the competent Authority to hear and resolve
aspects related to the issue that this agreement is based on, is the Ministry
of Energy and Mining; in such virtue, all action will be channeled through

the said Ministry.

- The parties, aware of their mutual responsibilities, will definitely act and
develop their actions in the framework of peace and concurrence at that

location and out of it.

- The Community Council of the Region of Intag, from Canton Cotacachi
[“CDC”], is committed to guarantee the free transit, given that it is a
Constitutional guarantee and a right for all citizens, to which it will eliminate
the obstacles that impede the free transit. To do the contrary will be judged

a criminal infraction.

4.283. MEM (Ms Ruiz) writes to Ascendant Copper on the same day. The letter, in material

part, reads as follows:°7?

“With regard to the decision made by this Under-Secretary of Environmental
Protection, communicated via Letter No. 01012 — 0616037 dated 7 December
2006, to suspend the activities of your company in the Intag region and, in light
of the socio-environmental conflict present in the area and the failure to observe
express provisions of the environmental mining regulations, I allow myself to
remind you that the referenced suspension of activities will be kept until the

entirety of originating causes have been overcome.

Reestablishing the citizen peace and tranquility in the region will surely
contribute to performing the processes of consultation and participation with
absolutely transparency and the full participation of all citizen sectors and
communities involved, to guarantee individual environmental and collective
rights enshrined by the Political Constitution and the domestic legal

framework.

With certainty that this recommendation will be heard to the full satisfaction of
this Under-Secretary, preserving the conditions of citizen calm and

contributing to decreasing the tensions existing in the area where your company

operates, I hereby sign.”?”

Mr Davis testified that he discussed MEM’s letter with Mr Veintimilla and took action
consequent upon it, such as terminating the employment of Ascendant Copper’s

personnel and scaling back its social programs.*”>

Mr Stonehouse testified that the roadblock on the road to Junin from Chalguayacu Alto
was taken down after the tripartite agreements. However, the roadblock on the road to
Junin remained in place, made up of rocks and logs.*”° He recounted an incident when
(10 or 12 days after the agreements were signed) he travelled by vehicle to test whether
that road was open. He and his companions came to the chain in the road where there
was a group of 50 people armed with so-called “Intag clubs” (made from heavy
electrical cable) and machetes. The group threatened to kill Mr Stonehouse and his
companions. After some hours, the police arrived and procured their release.*”’ Mr
Stonehouse concluded that Ascendant Copper could not get into Barcelona to perform
the individual consultations required for the EIS, even if other people were allowed to

continuing its activities in the Junin area in conflict with the instructions from MEM

unnecessary to relate them all here. The tension in the Junin area remains acute, with

Impact Assessment with the highest technical standards, subject to all legal and
regulatory guidelines and inform the community of said company studies and

guidelines issued by former Minister Alberto Acosta via Ministerial
Agreements numbers 62 and 76, issued on 22 May and 13 June of this year
[2007]. We consider that we can implement these mandates in coordination

Until now, we have not been able to perform these activities [for the EIS] due
to the constant opposition and factual steps taken by certain opposition to the
Junin mining project. We have been unfairly accused of performing mining
activities, when the only thing that we have performed is corporate
responsibility activities and community assistance. Art. 18 of the Mining Law
expressly defines the mining activity stages, without us having performed any
activities defined therein. The community diffusion is not a mining activity, on

the contrary, it is a preliminary obligation to performing mining activities.

[Ascendant Copper] has certain community assistance projects that are current
as of today, even before performing any mining activity in the area, and it also
creates jobs for agricultural and forest activities in its properties. Unfortunately,
we have had to decrease these jobs with the sole purpose of satisfying the
demands of opposition groups and enabling a dialogue and discussion between

the parties.

Neither the Mining Law nor any legal body in the country contemplates any

restriction for the above referenced social responsibility activities ...”°°?

Ascendant Copper was thereby challenging the Government’s instructions, of more
than nine months’ standing, to cease all activities in the Junin area (apart from the EIS)
and not only “mining activities” (which had not in fact begun and could not begin until

its EIS was accepted by the Ministry).

8 August 2007 — At a meeting between the Minister for Mines (Mr Chiriboga) and his
officers (including Ms Ruiz), anti-mining and pro-mining representatives (the latter
including Mr Veintimilla), Ascendant Copper is asked to suspend all forms of activity
in the Junin area.*? As Ms Ruiz testified: “what the minister asked the company was
to act in an environment of peace for the EIS to be prepared; it must be stated that 10
months almost had elapsed where the activities and the relationship had permanently

deteriorated. This, because of the fact that there was no peace.”3*4

20 September 2007 — By letter from Mr Veintimilla (of Ascendant Copper) to the
Minister for Mines (Mr Chiriboga), Ascendant Copper states that Ascendant Copper
and its associated agricultural company have only had 48 workers in the Junin area to
guard Ascendant Copper’s property and for agriculture; and that Ascendant Copper
had suspended its activities (including social responsibility projects) in the Junin
area.**> As Ms Ruiz testified, Ascendant Copper’s use of agricultural workers “was
in direct violation of the Minister’s order contained in the 12 July 2007 letter

demanding the suspension of all agricultural work.” *°°

24 September 2007 — The Under-Secretary of Mines approves the Terms of Reference
for the Telimbela EIS.*?”

25 September 2007 — The Pichincha Regional Mining Director in Quito declares by
formal resolution the suspension by Ascendant Copper of all mining activity in the
Junin concessions and of Ascendant Copper’s community relations activities in the
Junin area (the “Suspension Resolution”).*** As appears from the Attorney-General’s

letter to Mayor Tituajfia also of 25 September 2007,*””

the Suspension Resolution was
to have the force of criminal law; and, as such, the police could provide support to
enforce the suspension of all activities by Ascendant Copper. As Ms Ruiz testified, the
intended effect of this formal resolution was to suspend all activity by Ascendant

Copper, including the consultation required for the EIS.*”°

MEM.*°!

Early October 2007 — MEM’s representatives and the police travel to Chalguayacu
Bajo and Garcia Moreno to seal off Ascendant Copper’s farm and office.*°? Some days
later, Ms Ruiz finds that the seals are not stopping people from entering the premises;

and that the office had clearly been used.

24 October 2007 — By letter, Ascendant Copper (Mr Veintimilla) informs the Under-
Secretary of Mines (Mr Serrano) that, in compliance with the Director’s Suspension
Resolution, Ascendant Copper “does not maintain any activity, not even agricultural

or that of any other nature, in the area of Junin”.

2007 - Summary: By the end of 2007, there is no EIS approved for the Junin
concessions. There is also no concluded consultation by AE with certain of the local
communities in the Junin area, as required by MEM. However, with the Suspension
Resolution enforced by the Respondent, AE and Ascendant Copper are now precluded
by the Respondent from conducting any activity in the Junin area, thereby making it
impossible to conclude the required consultations and to submit an appropriate EIS to

MEM. The situation with the Chaucha and Telimbela concessions is more equivocal.

January 2008 — Ascendant Copper has a cash reserve of US$6.9 million.4

8 January 2008 — Ascendant Copper prepares to commission a further technical report

for the Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession from Tetra Tech.*°°

25 January 2008 — Nullification Resolutions: The newly appointed Regional Director
of Mining of Pichincha (Santiago Pazmifio) nullifies by resolutions Ascendant

to the National Office for Mining Environmental Protection for information on the
Junin concessions (Golden 1 and 2).*!° The written answer reports (inter alia) that
Ascendant Copper’s EIS had not been processed (by the Ministry) because “there was
no invitation of at least seven community leaders in the impact zone of the project for

the process of previous consultation and public discussion.”

Director of Pichincha to declare the termination of the Junin concessions (Golden 1
and 2) “without any compensation whatsoever” on the basis of Article 1 of the Mining
Mandate.*!” The reasons stated are that consultations have not been carried out by the

concessionaire.

Mining Director of Pichincha (Eduardo Sandoya Sanchez), Copper Mesa’s Junin
concessions are terminated without any economic compensation (the “Termination

Law).!29

23 June 2009 — By letter, Nortec notifies Copper Mesa of a serious defect in Copper
Mesa’s title to the Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession and that it would make no further
payments until the issue was resolved.**’ The letter states that Copper Mesa’s
Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession is included on the list of concessions that satisfies the
criteria of Article 24 of the 2009 Mining Law. This was a reference to the Ministry’s
memorandum of 19 June 2009 (supra). Mr Davis is told by Nortec’s President that an
Ecuadorian national on Nortec’s board was informed of the memorandum by one of
his contacts.**! Mr Davis testified that Nortec’s President told him that Nortec was not
prepared to close the transaction while this ‘cloud on title’ remained and was prepared
to forfeit its deposit paid to Copper Mesa rather than make any further payments under
the agreement.**? Mr Davis testified that Copper Mesa had no choice but to terminate

the agreement with Nortec.

24 June 2009 — Copper Mesa issues a press release (repeated in its later financial
statements), as required by Canadian securities laws, reporting the cloud on its title to

any prospect of raising any additional financing from a public offering of securities or
a sale of its Ecuadorian assets. Nortec’s withdrawal from its proposed acquisition of
Ascendant Barbados had confirmed that no mining company would be interested in
Copper Mesa’s Ecuadorian projects and no investors would provide any significant

amounts of financing in these circumstances.”*?

25 June 2009 — Nortec issues a material change report, as required by Canadian
securities laws, to the effect that its due diligence had confirmed that the Chaucha
concession was to revert to the State of Ecuador: It concluded: “... In the
circumstances, Nortec decided not to make any further payments until such time as it
received confirmation that the Chaucha Property would not be reverted to the State.
Nortec still has not received a definitive pronouncement from the Ecuadoran State in
this respect.” +4 There is here an implication that Nortec initiated an inquiry of the

Respondent, but that no response came to it from such inquiry.

2009 - Summary: For all practical purposes, subject to further legal proceedings in
Ecuador, the Claimant has lost (for one reason or another) its beneficial interests in the
Junin and Chaucha concessions, save for the possibility of a fire-sale of its legal

interests in the project companies to one or more third parties.

28 January 2010 — A new contract of sale of shares in Ascendant Barbados is agreed
between Copper Mesa and Biotreat.4! The shares are not transferred as Biotreat fails
to pay the balance of the purchase price.” Hence, as a matter of Ecuadorian law, the

Claimant has not lost its legal interests in the three project companies.

8 February 2010 — The Ministry of Mining advises DosRios to renew its mining title

to the Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession in accordance with the Mining Law 2009.*

17 February 2010 — DosRios applies for a new mining title to the Chaucha concession

(Janeth 1) under the Mining Law 2009.*##
29 March 2010 — DosRios presents a yearly investment plan and schedule of works.*#5

It also refers to difficulties caused by the suspension of its activities.

23 April 2010 — A new (substituted) mining title is issued by MEM to DosRios for the

Chaucha (Janeth 1) concession.““°

July 2010 — Copper Mesa’s shares cease to trade in Canada.”

24 August 2010 — The Constitutional Court rejects Copper Mesa’s appeal from the

dismissal of its application for extraordinary protection.

24 February 2011 — The Telimbela concession is terminated (archived) by MEM — no

renewal of title had been sought by the project company.*”

22 May 20/11 — Empresa Nacional Minera Enami EP (ENAMD), the Respondent’s
national mining company, applies for concessions in Junin, including Golden 1 and

Golden 2.4°°

13 June 2011 — The Mining and Control Agency (ARCOM) informs ENAMI that the
Junin concessions (Golden | and 2) are “free and available, so that ENAMI EP can

exercise the preferential right identified in the Law”.*>!

21 July 201] — The Ministry of Non-Renewable resources names the Junin and

Chaucha concessions as potential projects for ENAMI.*°?

19 September 2011 — A newspaper article quotes the Deputy Minister of Mines,
(Federico Auquilla) as saying that the state mining company of Chile would begin
exploration activities in Junin and is also interested in Chaucha.*? The National

Mining Sector Development Plan 2011-2015 refers to Junin, as its largest resource.**4

The interests shown by ENAMI and the Chilean state mining company in Junin take
place in 2011 long after Copper Mesa’s loss of its Junin and Chaucha concessions, i.e.
with the Termination Resolutions of 12 November 2008 and the events of June 2009

respectively.

By this time, Copper Mesa had begun these arbitration proceedings, by its Notice of

Arbitration dated 21 January 2011.

Checklist: Accordingly, the Tribunal has here decided, in substance, the principal

issues listed in Part 2 above, under Paragraphs 2.3 to 2.5.

PART 4 — Page 101 of 101

PART 5 - JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

A: Introduction

5.1.

5.2.

5.3.

5.4.

It is necessary briefly to summarise the Parties’ respective submissions before setting
out the Tribunal’s analyses and decisions on the issues of jurisdiction and
admissibility. In addition, as an international tribunal, the Tribunal is required to check

and, if applicable, confirm its jurisdiction to decide the Parties’ dispute.

In brief, the Claimant submits that the Respondent has given its unconditional consent
to the submission of this dispute to international arbitration in accordance with Article
XIII(5) of the Treaty, and that, in initiating this arbitration, the Claimant has fully

complied with the relevant requirements of Article XIII of the Treaty.

On 20 July 2010, invoking Article XIII(2) of the Treaty, the Claimant sent a written
Notice of Dispute to Ecuador as the named Respondent which alleged that measures
taken or not taken by Ecuador were in breach of the Treaty; that the Claimant had
incurred loss or damage by reason of those breaches; and that the Claimant was
therefore requesting monetary compensation from Ecuador. In response, by letter
dated 2 August 2010, Ecuador acknowledged receipt of the Claimant’s Notice of
Dispute on 23 July 2010. The Claimant submits that more than six months passed
before it commenced arbitral proceedings against the Respondent by its Notice of

Arbitration dated 21 January 2011 pursuant to Article XIII(4)(c) of the Treaty.!

In brief, the Respondent does not dispute these factors. However, the Respondent has
challenged the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, contending that: (i) the Claimant failed to
comply with Article XIII(12) of the Treaty by not obtaining the consents and waiver
of other remedies from the Ecuadorian project companies that the Claimant contends
sustained damage, and (ii) the Claimant failed to establish that it had made any
investments in Ecuador that would qualify for protection under the Treaty.? The
Respondent contends that the claims of the Claimant relating to the Junin concessions

fall outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because: (i) these were not investments made

and operated in accordance with the applicable law (Ecuadorian law); and (ii) the
Claimant is approaching this Tribunal with “unclean hands” (under international law).
The Respondent further contends that the Claimant has not proven ownership of the

Ecuadorian project companies at critical dates.*

The Claimant, on the contrary, submits that this Tribunal has jurisdiction and that it
has met all the requirements for the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Treaty: ratione

temporis, ratione personae and ratione materiae.

As to ratione temporis, the Claimant contends that the measures at issue relate to
events subsequent to the entry into force of the Treaty on 6 June 1997. As to ratione
personae, the Claimant contends that it (Copper Mesa) is an enterprise incorporated or
duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of Canada and therefore a
Canadian “investor” as defined in Article I(h)(ii) of the Treaty. Copper Mesa was
incorporated on 5 May 2004, and it acquired its Ecuadorian investments before the
existence of any dispute with Ecuador and owned them (indirectly) at the time of all
the impugned measures.* The Claimant submits that it elected to submit this dispute
to arbitration on its own behalf, which it claims is permitted by the Treaty.° As to
ratione materiae, the Claimant contends that its indirect interests in the project
companies are “investments” in the territory of Ecuador as defined in Article I(g) of
the Treaty; and, further, that indirect ownership through Ascendant Barbados
(Ascendant Copper (Barbados) Corporation) is expressly permitted by this provision

to qualify as an “investment”.”

These project companies are identified by the Claimant as Ascendant Copper
Ascendcopper S.A. (“Ascendant Ecuador” or “AE”), Compaiifa Minera DosRios S.A.
and Compajfifa Minera Telimbela S.A. as the concessionaires of, respectively, the

Junin, Chaucha and (subject to the option’s exercise) Telimbela concessions.

PART 5 — Page 2 of 22

5.8.

It is appropriate next to break down the Respondent's jurisdictional objections and the
Claimant’s responses under four separate headings: Article XIII(12) of the Treaty,

Continued Ownership, legality and Unclean Hands.

B: Article XITI(12) of the Treaty

5.9.

5.10.

5.11.

The Respondent’s principal jurisdictional objection is based on Article XIII(12) of the
Treaty. According to the Respondent, the Claimant is bringing a claim under Article
XIII(12)(a) concerning damage to the (alleged) local subsidiaries of the Claimant in
Ecuador (i.e. the three project companies), and not a claim under Article XIII(3).
Therefore, according to the Respondent, the Claimant must comply with the
requirements of Article XIII(12) and the local subsidiaries must separately consent to
arbitration and waive any rights each may have under the local law (here Ecuadorian
law) against the measures taken by the host State (here the Respondent) of which the

investor (here the Claimant) complains.*

In brief, the Respondent submits that Article XIII(12) is an “improved version of a
fork-in-the-road clause”, establishing a unity of interest between the foreign investor
and its local subsidiary. If the latter chooses to initiate or continue local or other
proceedings, no claim under the Treaty may be brought by the foreign investor; but if
the foreign investor chooses to initiate an arbitration under the Treaty for damages
caused to the subsidiary, these proceedings are considered to have been brought on
behalf of the local subsidiary. Pursuant to Article XIII(12)(b) of the Treaty, the only
exception to these conditions would be when the host State has unlawfully deprived

the foreign investor of the control of its local subsidiary. Such is not this case.

The Respondent contends that Article XIII(12) seeks to eliminate the risk of parallel
litigation as the foreign investor and the local subsidiary have separate legal
personalities; and, therefore, each has the capacity to sue in its own right.!° The
Respondent further contends that: “[h]Javing elected to organize its investment in

Ecuador in the form of local subsidiaries which had their own legal personality and

could act in their own name, the Claimant is not entitled to pierce the corporate veil

and claim for losses allegedly sustained by those subsidiaries”.!!

The Respondent further contends that where a foreign investor has made and operates
its investment through a local subsidiary, it may not claim for direct damage to itself
under Article XIII(3) of the Treaty; and, in that sense, that Article XIII(12) is intended
to be an exclusive (or exhaustive) remedy. !? The Respondent considers that an investor
may bring a claim on its own behalf in the event that it has itself incurred loss or
damage as a result of an alleged breach of the Treaty (Article XIII(1) and (2)), only in
situations where the foreign investor has not established a local subsidiary to operate
the investment or where such a subsidiary has been established but the foreign investor
has been deprived by the host State of control of the subsidiary, which the Respondent
observes has not been claimed by the Claimant in this case.'? Indeed, again, such is

not this case.

The Respondent notes that the Claimant could have applied for the mining concessions
directly in its own name. It chose to do so indirectly through Ecuadorian legal entities.
It could not obtain their consents and waivers when this arbitration began because it

had sold those companies. '* None of this is attributable to the Respondent.

As regards Article XIII(3) of the Treaty, the Claimant contends that the claims under
the Treaty belong to itself as “the investor”; and that the Treaty allows the Claimant to
bring its claim on its own behalf (as it does) for the losses that it has incurred due to
the diminution in the value of the shares of its Ecuadorian subsidiaries and due to its
inability to recover its inter-company loans to these subsidiaries. The Claimant submits
that it has expended itself nearly US$ 26.5 million on the three mining projects in
Ecuador, either directly or indirectly by loans to its local subsidiaries. Further,

according to the Claimant, Article XIII(12) supplements Article XIII(3) providing for

additional remedies that can only be awarded to the “enterprise” and does not diminish

in any way the rights and remedies of the “investor” under the Treaty.!*

5.15. | The Claimant considers that a waiver from a local subsidiary is only required where
the investor asserts a remedy that can only be given to the subsidiary under Article
XIII(12), such as restitution of the property owned by the subsidiary or payment to the

subsidiary of 100% of its loss when the investor owns less than 100% of its shares.'®

5.16. | The Claimant notes that Article XIII(12) of the Treaty provides that: “a claim [...] may
be brought by an investor of the other Contracting Party acting on behalf of an
enterprise which the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly”. It contends that
the Respondent’s interpretation would transform the permissive text of this provision
from “may be brought” to a mandatory “shall be brought”, which the Claimant
contends was not the intention of the drafters of the Treaty.!’ The Claimant further
submits that there is a jurisprudence constante under NAFTA, CAFTA and other
treaties that include similarly worded requirements to the effect that the ordinary
meaning of such provision is to provide investors with additional remedies and not to
require them to submit waivers where they have made investments trough local
subsidiaries.'* According to the Claimant, rather than building on “fork-in-the-road”
clauses, the Treaty adopts a distinction used in Articles 1116 and 1117 of NAFTA
(concluded two years before the signature of the Treaty) between claims that an
investor can make on its own behalf and additional claims that it can assert “acting on

behalf of an enterprise which the investor owns or controls”.'?

5.17. | The Claimant refers to the NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration in UPS v. Canada where
the tribunal dismissed the objection that the claimant could not assert damage on its
own behalf under Article 1116 where the impugned measures related solely to the

treatment of its local subsidiary, UPS Canada.”° The Claimant further cites another

NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration award in Pope & Talbot v. Canada where the Tribunal
accepted a claim brought by the investor on its own behalf for damages to the local
subsidiary that it owned and controlled.”! It cites the decision of the ICSID annulment

committee in Azurix v. Argentina to similar effect.”

5.18. | The Claimant also refers to Railroad Development Corporation (RDC) v. Guatemala
where the tribunal awarded proportional damages to the shareholder of the local
company for its claims on its own behalf, rather than insisting that the claim could only
be brought on behalf of the local company, noting that it had the capacity to tailor the
award to avoid double recovery through parallel litigation. >> The Claimant
distinguishes the present case from the situation where, in that case, the claimant had
been pursuing local proceedings at the time when arbitration proceedings were started

(which is not this case).”+

5.19. The Claimant further contends, in the alternative, that if the Tribunal were to find that
Article XII(12) did apply to the Claimant’s claims, then Article XTII(12)(b) should
also here apply as the Claimant had no choice but to allow Biotreat to take over the de
facto management of the project companies in July 2009 as the Respondent’s measures
had deprived the Claimant of the ability to obtain any financing for the continued

operation of these companies, depriving it of control of these companies.”>

5.20. | The Respondent rejects this alternative argument of the Claimant. It contends that the
alleged “loss of control” to Biotreat of the local companies was a result of a voluntary
sales transaction without any causal link to measures allegedly taken by the

Respondent. Therefore, so the Respondent maintains, the Claimant fails to meet the

21 Pope & Talbot Inc. v. Government of Canada, UNCITRAL, Award on Damages, 31 May 2002 (CLA-5) [“Pope
& Talbot v Canada”) paras 78-80: “Article 1117 is permissive, not mandatory, in its language ‘may submit to
arbitration’ [...] claims may be brought under Article 1116 by an investor who is claiming loss or damage to its
interest in the relevant enterprise, which is a juridical person that the investor owns.”

where the foreign investor is not the actual legal owner of the assets constituting an investment, or not an actual
party to the contract giving rise to the contractual rights constituting an investment, that foreign investor may
nonetheless have a financial or other interest in that investment. [...] The Committee sees no reason in principle
why an investment protection treaty cannot protect such an interest of a foreign investor, and enable the foreign
investor to bring arbitration proceedings in respect of alleged violations of the treaty with respect to that interest.”

requirements of Article XIII(12) and therefore no valid arbitration agreement exists

pursuant to Article XIII(5) of the Treaty.”°

In the event that the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent and finds that the Claimant’s
claims may be brought only under Article XIII(12), the Claimant presented with its
Reply (i.e. after the commencement of this arbitration) the written consents and
waivers of each of the project companies ostensibly effective as of the date of the
commencement of the arbitration. The Claimant submitted that these waivers were
being filed (with its Reply) without prejudice to its primary argument that they are
“completely unnecessary”. However, the Claimant acknowledges that they do not
completely eliminate any remaining risk of parallel litigation, as invoked by

the Respondent.”’

The Respondent replies in turn that the Tribunal still lacks jurisdiction ratione
personae, as (so it maintains) it is a well-established rule under international law that
jurisdiction must exist on the date when the arbitration is commenced; and so the
Claimant cannot cure at the moment of presenting its Reply the jurisdictional defect
that existed when the arbitration was commenced.”® The Claimant submits, in turn,
that cases under the Treaty have allowed valid consents and waivers from a claimant

to be filed subsequent to its notice of arbitration.”

C: Continued Ownership

5.23.

As to the second principal objection by the Respondent to this Tribunal’ s jurisdiction,
relating to the existence of the Claimant’s “investment” protected under the Treaty,
the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s case is based entirely on measures

claimed to have affected its alleged local subsidiaries that owned the three mining

concessions in dispute. The Respondent contends that the Claimant does not dispute

that Biotreat has controlled these subsidiaries since at least July 2009.*°

In brief, according to the Respondent, the Claimant has not proven ownership of any
of the assets alleged by the Claimant as constituting its investments in Ecuador on the
relevant dates, including the shares indirectly owned by the Claimant (under its present
or previous name) in Ascendant Ecuador, DosRios and Telimbela as the project
companies. *! The Respondent submits that the Claimant sold its subsidiaries to
Biotreat in January 2010, and accordingly, that only Biotreat may claim thereafter on
behalf of these three companies and not the Claimant.** Further, the Respondent
challenged the acquisition of Ascendant Barbados by the Claimant (which owned the
project companies).** As to the three concessions, the Claimant never owned them
directly, but only indirectly through Ascendant Barbados and the local project

companies.**

In brief, the Claimant contends that the Respondent seeks to impose a non-existent
jurisdictional requirement of continuous ownership of the investment beyond the date
of the impugned measures and up to the date of submission of the claim in this
arbitration. The Claimant refers to the plain text of Article I(h) of the Treaty defining
the term “investor” as including a Canadian enterprise “who makes the investment in
the territory of the Republic of Ecuador’. The Claimant contends that the Respondent’s
interpretation would be substituting the word “makes” with “holds” or “owns”.*> The
Claimant further cites the Tribunal in Encana v. Ecuador deciding that “[p]rovided
loss or damage is caused to an investor by a breach of the Treaty, the cause of action
is complete at that point; retention of the subsidiary [...] serves no purpose as a
jurisdictional requirement [...]”*° and “[{t]o require the claimant to maintain a

continuing status as an investor under the law of the host State at the time the

arbitration is commenced would tend to frustrate the very purpose of the BIT”.*” The

Claimant also refers to GEA v. Ukraine and related doctrine in support of its case.**

Further, the Claimant submits that it has provided evidence of its indirect ownership
of the project companies at the relevant times, prior to the Nullification Resolutions in
January 2008 up to the termination of the Nortec transaction in June 2009. It relies
upon the share certificates and the share register of Ascendant Barbados, as well as the
legal opinion on Barbadian law of Ascendant Barbados’ counsel, the share certificates
of the project companies, mandatory filings in Ecuador, shareholders’ resolutions and
legal opinions issued prior to the Nullification Resolutions and the termination of the

Nortec transaction.

In the alternative, should the Tribunal require continuous ownership of the project
companies up to the date of the submission to arbitration, the Claimant submits that it
has proven that Ascendant Barbados’ sale to Biotreat was never completed. And in the
further alternative, should the Tribunal find that such sale was completed, the Claimant
insists that it would nevertheless have a residual interest with respect to the amounts
still owed to it by Biotreat under such sale.*° Similarly, should the Tribunal decide that
Article XIII(12) creates a requirement of continuous ownership to the date of the
submission to arbitration, the Claimant presented with its Reply the addendum to the
share purchase agreement between the Claimant and Biotreat dated 11 February
2013,*! whereby Biotreat formally acknowledged that it did not obtain ownership of
Ascendant Barbados prior to the date of this arbitration. The Claimant also refers to
the formal declarations by the general managers of the project companies confirming
that prior assertions of a transfer of ownership to Biotreat in 2010 were invalid.*? In
addition, the Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s argument that the signing of
the share purchase agreement instantly transferred title to the shares in Ascendant
Barbados and the project companies. According to the Claimant, the share purchase

agreement creates the right to acquire and the corresponding obligation to transfer the

shares; however, only the delivery of the shares produces the effective transfer of the

right to the assets; and such transfer never occurred.*?

The Respondent contends that this agreement of 11 February 2013 between the
Claimant and Biotreat is only a later “addendum” to the share purchase agreement and
cannot change the historical fact that the agreement to transfer Ascendant Barbados’
legal and beneficial interest in the three Ecuadorian subsidiaries to Biotreat was
concluded on 30 October 2009. The Respondent submits that pursuant to the share
purchase agreement, the Ecuadorian subsidiaries were under Biotreat’s effective
control; and that, accordingly, the Claimant lost control and title to these subsidiaries

on 28 January 2010, before the commencement of this arbitration.“+

D: Legality of Ownership

5.29.

5.30.

The Respondent’s third jurisdictional objection raises the issue of illegality. In brief,
the Respondent submits that, even assuming that the Claimant had made investments
in Ecuador, those investments are tainted by illegality under both Ecuadorian law and
public international law, arguing that the concessions were acquired on the basis of
illegally obtained information and that they were illegally awarded and illegally
transferred to the Claimant. Moreover, the conduct of the Claimant’s alleged
subsidiaries, as well as that of its agents and employees, amounts, so the Respondent
submits, to severe breaches of legal principles governing corporate social
responsibility and is contrary to international public policy, including the UN Global
Compact, the OECD Guidelines and the Voluntary Principles.** The Respondent
contends that according to Article I(g) of the Treaty, only lawful investments are

protected under the Treaty.*°

The Respondent submits that the Treaty only protects investments “owned or
controlled either directly, or indirectly through an investor of a third State, by an
investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in
accordance with the latter’s laws”.*’ The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s

investment relating to the Junin concessions were made in a manner not in accordance

with the laws of Ecuador, as the Claimant was fully aware that these concessions were
obtained under a “rigged” tender process. The Respondent further contends that these
concessions were also not operated in accordance with Ecuadorian law as the Claimant
engaged in a series of unlawful activities violating Ecuadorian law and international

law, as well as international public policy.**

5.31. In brief, the Claimant contends that Article I(g) of the Treaty requires that the
ownership or control of the investment made by the claimant must be determined in
accordance with the law of the host State;*? but that the Treaty does not require
compliance with local laws during the “management, conduct or operation” of that
investment, which is the language is used in Article IV(1) of the Treaty. Hence, so the
Claimant submits, these different words must be given different meanings.* Had the
Contracting Parties to the Treaty intended the broader meaning alleged by the
Respondent, they would have specifically used the word “operated”, at least, rather

than the word “controlled”.*!

5.32. | The Claimant also contends that the Respondent’s broad interpretation would lead to
absurd results where any breach of the host State’s laws at any point during the entire
period of the management, conduct or operation of a long-term investment (as were
the concessions) would preclude the investor from obtaining any relief under the
Treaty, even if the single breach of the host State’s laws was wholly unrelated to the

merits of the claim. The Claimant concludes that “very few businesses that operate in

a country for a long period of time will have such a pristine legal record”.*?

5.33. | The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s submission is contrary to the general rule

of treaty interpretation as set out in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law

[*Vannessa Ventures v Venezuela”] where applying a treaty using similar language as in this case, the tribunal
held that “the jurisdictional significance of the ‘legality requirement’ in the definition of an investment [...] is
exhausted once the investment has been made” (para 167); and to Alasdair Ross Anderson et al. v. Costa Rica,
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/07/3, Award, 19 May 2010 (RLA-44) [“Anderson et al. v. Costa Rica”| where again
applying a treaty using similar language, the tribunal merely found that “the transaction by which the Claimant
obtained ownership of thei ts” violated Costa Rican law, without considering the conduct by the claimants
after the initial transaction was concluded (para 57).

of the Treaties. That requires treaties to be interpreted “in good faith in accordance
with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in
light of its object and purpose”. ** According to the Respondent, the legality
requirement under Article I(g) of the Treaty covers investment “owned or controlled”
and not only “made” in accordance with the law of the host State.** The Respondent
submits that it has “identified a long list of actions taken by the Claimant that were in

breach of the applicable Ecuadorian law”.*>

5.34. In support of its interpretation, the Respondent relies on Inceysa v. El Salvador where
the tribunal denied jurisdiction on the basis that the investor had obtained a concession
fraudulently,*° and on Fraport v. Philippines I where the tribunal decided that it lacked
jurisdiction because the investment had not been accepted in accordance with the laws
of the host State.*” The Respondent also relies on the principle nemo auditur propiam
turpitudinem allegans (“no one may be heard to benefit from their own wrong”) and
submits that the investor cannot seek to benefit from an investment effectuated by

means of illegal acts and also enjoy the protection granted by the host State.**

5.35. | The Claimant contends that the cases cited by the Respondent apply this principle only
at the time of the acquisition of the investment and not to the operation of the
investment subsequent to its acquisition by the investor.°? Further, the Claimant
submits that the Respondent has not identified with any precision the provisions of
Ecuadorian law that the Claimant or its subsidiaries has contravened, either of

Ecuador’s Criminal Code or its other legislation.

E: Unclean Hands

5.36. According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s claims are inadmissible ratione materiae
as the Claimant approaches the Tribunal with “unclean hands” having failed to comply
with applicable Ecuadorian and international laws. °! This fourth jurisdictional
objection relates only to the Junin concessions. In its post-hearing brief, the
Respondent re-confirmed that its case on “unclean hands” only applies to the
Claimant’s claims concerning the Junin concessions and not to the Chaucha and

Telimbela concessions.

5.37. In brief, according to the Claimant, the Respondent is estopped from raising any case
based on “unclean hands”, because it failed at the material time to investigate any
“unclean hands” committed by the Claimant. The Claimant submits that no
contemporary statement was ever made by the Respondent or its officials regarding

any alleged violations of human rights by the Claimant prior to this arbitration.“

5.38. Further, the Claimant contends that the “scope of this doctrine is limited to cases where

the claimant is seeking a remedy of an equitable nature but is involved in on-going

conduct that is precisely similar in fact and law as the conduct it seeks to prevent”.

5.39. In brief, the Respondent contends that the Claimant’s narrow interpretation of the
doctrine of “unclean hands” would limit the doctrine to cases where equitable relief

was sought, which, so the Respondent contends, is wrong as a matter of international

 Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief paras 55-66, 125-126. According to the Claimant, the letter from the Ministry of
Mining of June 2006 and the four letters of 2007 cited by the Respondent in its Rejoinder do not contain allegations
of violations of human rights; nor do the Suspension, Nullification and Termination Resolutions do not do so
either. The Claimant also contends that Ms. Ruiz testified that she did not make any written complaints regarding

complicit in any use of force, [it] investigated the complaints of human rights abuses [and] took remedial actions
to avoid any further confrontation by terminating both Falericorp and H&L after the incident became known to
it.” (Mr. Davis’ testimony, Reply paras 93, 96-112; Transcript, Day 2, 530:13).

law.® The Respondent submits that the doctrine also applies in at least two other
situations, namely, (i) “where the respondent’s allegedly unlawful conduct is a
consequence of, or has been prompted by, the claimant’s own unlawful conduct”; and
(ii) “where the claimant’s claim arises out of actions or circumstances that are tainted
by the claimant’s own international illegality or conduct that is incompatible with
international public policy”.©’ The Respondent submits that the latter is the present
situation; and that, in any case, it is well-established under international law that the

scope of application of the relevant legal principle (“unclean hands”, nemo auditur, ex

injuria non oritur, etc.) is not limited to the making of the investment.

5.40. In response, the Claimant contends that none of these doctrines can be used to expand
the scope of the relevant inquiry to cover all aspects of the conduct of a claimant or its
investment, as a matter of jurisdiction under international law.® According to the
Claimant, however broad the doctrine, the Respondent is now estopped from denying

the validity of the Junin concessions.”°

5.41. | The Claimant contends that not all actions relating to these concessions’ acquisition or
operation can be relevant. It would require a substantial non-compliance with the host

State’s laws and regulations, which the Claimant contends is not the present case and

which the Respondent has not proven.”! The Claimant further contends that the alleged
tender “rigging” in the Respondent’s original grant of the Junin concessions is based
purely on speculation by the Respondent; and, furthermore, that the Respondent
nonetheless decided at the time to grant the concessions, instead of cancelling

the tender.”

The Respondent replies that it does not contend that “any breach” of the law is relevant
and that “a trivial violation of the law that is unrelated to the merits would not be
relevant”. However, the Respondent contends that such is not the case here. The
Respondent submits that the Claimant and its subsidiary, Ascendant Ecuador, “have
committed flagrant breaches of Ecuadorian and international human rights law and
international public policy” in circumstances that are not “unrelated to the merits of
the claim”, rather “the Claimant’s claim arise directly out of the circumstances in
which the breaches were committed and thus form the very subject matter of the
dispute before this Tribunal”.’? Further, the Respondent contends that it is not

estopped from challenging the Claimant’s claims on the basis of illegality.”

F: The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

5.43.

5.44.

The Treaty was signed on 29 April 1996; and it came into force on 6 June 1997. The
Claimant was a legal person organised under Canadian law on 5 May 2004. As further
explained below, the Claimant owned, indirectly, the three project companies from
July 2004 onwards, up to and including the Termination Resolutions (12 November
2008) in regard to the Junin concessions and also the events of June 2009 regarding “a
cloud on title” in regard to the Chaucha concession (with the Telimbela concession).
Accordingly, the Claimant made its alleged investments in Ecuador in July 2004
onwards, through its intermediary subsidiary (Ascendant Barbados), a legal person

formed under Bajun law.

The Claimant’s investments thus took place before the alleged measures taken by the
Respondent in 2008 and 2009 allegedly in breach of the Treaty, allegedly causing legal
harm to the Claimant. They also took place long before the Claimant’s Notice of

Dispute of 20 July 2010 and the commencement of this arbitration on 21 January 2011.

R-35.

Further, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s case that, de jure, the Claimant’s
transactions with Biotreat in 2009 did not deprive the Claimant of its investments
before this arbitration’s commencement. Hence, the Tribunal finds there was
continuous legal ownership by the Claimant of its investments from 2004 up to 21

January 2011.

There remains an issue as to exactly when Ascendant Copper (Barbados) Corporation
was formed in Barbados. The Respondent at first submitted that it was formed after
the date of its “acquisition” by the Claimant in May 2004 and, hence, that such
acquisition was a legal impossibility. The Respondent then pointed (in particular) to
the Bajun company’s certificate of incorporation dated 28 September 2004.”° That
jurisdictional objection was then modified following the Claimant’s filing of the legal

opinion of Ms Hyde Porchetta on Bajun company law.

The Tribunal notes first that this issue was first raised by the Respondent in this
arbitration. In all its previous dealings with the Claimant, the Respondent had never
sought to challenge the Claimant’s indirect ownership and control of its Ecuadorian
project companies. Moreover, it would be fair to describe the Respondent’s modified
objection as, at best, purely technical: there can be no suggestion of bad faith or
manipulation by the Claimant of the corporate structures by which it held its
investments in Ecuador. Yet, even a technical objection as to jurisdiction requires the

Tribunal’s consideration.

This issue of the Claimant’s direct ownership of Ascendant Barbados, with the
Claimant’ s indirect ownership (through the Bajun company) of the Ecuadorian project
companies, is a long and complicated story. The details are not here important.
Ultimately, it arrrives, subject to the precise date in 2004 of the Claimant’s completed
acquisition of the Bajun company (itself immaterial to this case), at the same result:
the Claimant indirectly owned and controlled the Ecuadorian project companies from
at least the end of 2004 up to at least the dates of the measures in 2008 and 2009
impugned by the Claimant and, further, up to the date of this arbitration’s
commencement in January 2011, as a matter of Canadian, Bajun and Ecuadorian laws,

as applicable to the Claimant, Ascendant Barbados and the project companies. The

PART 5 — Page 16 of 22

5.48.

5.49.

5.51.

Tribunal concludes such ownership continued, de jure, up to the date of this

arbitration’s commencement.

Accordingly, subject only to what follows, the Tribunal decides that the Claimant has
met the jurisdictional requirements of the Treaty, as regards ratione temporis, ratione
personae and ratione materiae. The Tribunal next addresses the distinct jurisdictional
objections made the Respondent, under three separate headings: Article XII of the

Treaty; Illegalities; and Unclean Hands.

Article XIII: The Tribunal considers that the Claimant has complied with the formal
requirements of Article XIII(3) & (4)(c) of the Treaty, with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, for commencing this arbitration against the Respondent. Moreover,

the Tribunal does not understand the Respondent to contend otherwise.

The Tribunal considers that the Claimant is entitled, as a matter of jurisdiction and
admissibility, to advance its own claims against the Respondent, in respect of its own
investments in Ecuador pursuant to Article XIII(1) and (2) of the Treaty. The Tribunal
also considers that is what the Claimant has done in this arbitration for its primary
claims: it has not there sought to advance or espouse any claim in the name of any its
subsidiaries; and it is only claiming compensation for harm which it has itself suffered
and not any harm suffered by its subsidiaries. That was re-confirmed, unambiguously,
by the Claimant in its post-hearing brief.” Although, in case its primary claim failed,
the Claimant also advanced an alternative claim under Article XIII(12) of the Treaty,
that alternative subsidiary claim was made only in response to the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objection to its primary claims. In the circumstances, this alternative

claim is otiose and need not here be considered further by the Tribunal.

It is nonetheless correct that, during these arbitration proceedings, many of those
subsidiaries’ names have often been used by the Parties interchangeably with the
successive names of the Claimant. Yet, that shorthand, made for ease of reference only
to avoid unnecessary confusion, cannot change the formal status of the Claimant’s
pleaded claims against the Respondent under Article XIII(1) and (2) of the Treaty. In
the Tribunal’s view, these are all claims pleaded against the Respondent by the

Claimant alone, in its own right and on its own behalf for its own harm to its own

investments. For that purpose, as a matter of jurisdiction, the Claimant does not
advance any claim on behalf of any of the project companies; and it does not need to

place any reliance upon Article XIII(12) of the Treaty.

In this regard, the Tribunal notes, with approval, the important distinction drawn by
the NAFTA tribunal in UPS v Canada between Articles 1116 and 1117 of NAFTA,
on wording broadly similar to Article XIII(2) and Article XIII(12) of the Treaty. In
that NAFTA award, that tribunal there decided:””

“[34]. UPS argues that Canada’s objection is not well taken. UPS asserts that it
has properly brought its claims under article 1116, that it is entitled to claim for
losses incurred by a wholly owned subsidiary, that this has been recognized by
other NAFTA tribunals, and that it should be allowed the election between
claims under article 1116 and article 1117. UPS joins issue with Canada
respecting the decisions of other NAFTA tribunals, directly contradicting
Canada’s reading of NAFTA tribunal decisions in the Mondev case and in Pope
& Talbot Inc v Canada, Award in Respect of Damages (31 May 2002). If this
Tribunal does not accept its contentions respecting the construction of article
1116, UPS asks that it be permitted to modify its claim as a claim under article

1117.

[35]. We agree with UPS that the claims here are properly brought under article
1116 and agree as well that the distinction between claiming under article 1116
or article 1117, in the context of this dispute at least, is an almost entirely formal
one, without any significant implication for the substance of the claims or the
rights of the parties. UPS is the sole owner of UPS Canada. As such, it is entitled
to file a claim for its losses, including losses incurred by UPS Canada. If there
were multiple owners and divided ownership shares for UPS Canada, the
question of how much of UPS Canada’s losses flow through to UPS — the
question posed by Canada here — may have a very different purchase. As it is,
there is no reason to ask that question in the instant proceeding. Whether the

damage is directly to UPS or directly to UPS Canada and only indirectly to UPS

is irrelevant to our jurisdiction over these claims. That is clearly the same

position taken by the tribunal in the Pope & Talbot proceeding ...”

The Tribunal considers it unnecessary to add a list of further decisions comprising, on

this point, an effective jurisprudence constante to like effect.

In these circumstances, no question can arise here as to any requirement imposed by
Articles XTII(1) and (2) of the Treaty upon the Claimant to obtain the consents or
waivers of its subsidiaries in commencing this arbitration against the Respondent. In
the Tribunal’s view, the requirements of Article XII(12)(a) of the Treaty are simply
not applicable to the Claimant’s case under Articles XIII(1) and (2). It is therefore
unnecessary to consider further the Respondent’s submission that Article XII(12)

operates as an improved or exclusive ‘fork-in-the-road’ provision.

Illegalities: As regards violations of Ecuadorian law, in the Tribunal’s view, the
wording of the Treaty is confined, at most, to a jurisdictional bar applying to the time
when the Claimant first made its investment. That was in 2004. The wording of Article
1(g) of the Treaty is clear: the phrase “in accordance with the latter’s laws” qualifies
the earlier concept of the investment’s ownership and control when made; and it does

not extend to the subsequent operation, management or conduct of an investment.

Not only is any such wording significantly absent from Article 1(g), but it would take
clear wording to produce such an important jurisdictional bar. It would effectively
deprive an investor from exercising any arbitral remedy under the Treaty if the investor
(or its agents or employees) ever committed a breach of the host State’s laws during
the life of its investment. That would be a stark and potentially harsh result, severely
limiting the legal autonomy of the arbitration agreement between an investor and a

host State resulting from Article XIII(4) of the Treaty.

The Respondent, of course, readily accepts that no jurisdictional bar could arise from
a minor breach of the local law; and that concession was necessarily made. For
example, an employee of the investor cycling to work in the dark without a rear light
(in contravention of local traffic laws) should not deprive that investor forever of its
arbitral remedy under the Treaty. However, the Respondent’s broad interpretation,
however tailored, would still leave a significant lack of clarity as to the exact dividing-

line between minor and non-minor violations of the local law. It would also produce

PART 5 — Page 19 of 22

5.57.

5.58.

5.59.

much room for debate in activities that are almost inevitably litigious, such as mining.
Where illegal conduct remains relevant to the merits of an investor’s claim under the
Treaty, without clear language, there is here no discernable object or purpose in
elevating such a defence into a jurisdictional bar. The Tribunal notes that the same
interpretation, on similar wording in the Canada-Venezuela BIT, was reached by the
ICSID tribunal in Vannessa Ventures v Venezuela. It there decided that the
jurisdictional significance of the requirement of legality was exhausted once the

investment was made.”®

Accordingly, with the Tribunal’s interpretation based on the wording used in the
Treaty, interpreted with its ordinary meaning under Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties, the Respondent’s case is limited to the time of the
Claimant’s original investment in acquiring the Junin concessions. There seems to be,
as already noted, no similar case advanced by the Respondent in regard to the Chaucha

and Telimbela concessions.

As recited in Part 4 above, as to the facts, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s
submissions that the Claimant acquired the Junin concessions in violation of
Ecuadorian law, assessed at the time when the Claimant made its initial investment in
2004. It also accepts the testimony of the Claimant’s expert witness on Ecuadorian
law, Dr Zumarraga, to the effect that the Junin concessions were validly granted by

the Respondent.”

On all these matters, the Respondent bore the legal burden of proving its positive
allegations. At most, it could only allege that something was possibly awry with the
original tender and grant of the Junin concessions to Dr Bustamante in 2003. That
allegation was not proven on the evidence adduced before this Tribunal. Moreover,
there was no cogent evidence linking Dr Bustamante’s actions in 2003, even assuming
them to be somehow unlawful or collusive, with Ascendex, any other of the project
companies or (still less) the Claimant in 2004. The Tribunal does not accept, on the

evidence, that the acquisition of the Junin concessions was made otherwise than in

good faith and at arm’s length by Ascendex; and it accepts the testimony of Mr Jurika

to such effect.*?

Unclean Hands: The Tribunal does not consider that the Claimant was guilty of any
wrongdoing, whether it amounted to “unclean hands” or any other like impropriety, at
the time when it acquired the Junin concessions in 2004. The Tribunal does not
understand the Respondent’s case on “unclean hands” to extend to the Chaucha and
Telimbela concessions. Accordingly, the Respondent’s case on unclean hands is
limited to the alleged misconduct of the Claimant (by itself, its agents and employees)

after its indirect acquisition of the Junin concessions in 2004.

The Respondent has adduced an impressive amount of expert testimony and materials
relating to the legal doctrine of unclean hands under international law, including the
obligations of foreign investors on human rights in the broadest sense.*! The Tribunal
has studied this testimony and materials, including (in particular) the expert testimony
of Professor Murphy. Nevertheless, this is not the place to address these materials in

detail, for two cumulative reasons.

First, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent’s case on unclean hands is not a
jurisdictional objection, but rather an objection to the admissibility of the Claimant’s
claims based upon its alleged post-acquisition misconduct. In regard to the latter, if
correct, the Tribunal would have jurisdiction, but it could not exercise that jurisdiction
in favour of the Claimant’s claim. An objection as to admissibility necessarily assumes

that a tribunal has jurisdiction.

Second, the Respondent’s case involves grave allegations against the Claimant of
violations of international law, particularly during the post-acquisition period from
2005 to 2007. All, or almost all, of such alleged conduct took place in Ecuador, openly
and in view of the Respondent’s governmental authorities both in the Junin area and
in Quito. Yet, as regards international law, international public policy and human
rights, not a single complaint was made by the Respondent against the Claimant at the
time. Such a complaint surfaced for the first time after the commencement of this

arbitration.

PART 5 — Page 21 of 22

5.64.

5.65.

5.66.

5.67.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal considers that it is far too late for the Respondent
to raise such objections to the Tribunal’s exercise of jurisdiction in this arbitration.
Given the Respondent’s obligation of good faith under the Treaty in regard to
arbitration, the Tribunal decides that the Respondent is precluded from raising this
objection as to admissibility. (This decision does not apply to other wrongdoings under

Ecuadorian law by the Claimant and its agents).

The Tribunal has decided to join what remains of the Respondent’s case on
admissibility to the merits of the Claimant’s claims in regard the Junin concessions.
As will appear below, the Tribunal there prefers to take into account the Claimant’s
case not in the form of the doctrine of unclean hands as such, but rather under
analogous doctrines of causation and contributory fault applying to the merits of the
Claimant’s claims arising from events subsequent to the acquisition of its investment.
That result, based on the Respondent’s case on the merits, strikes the Tribunal as more
legally appropriate to this case than an outright dismissal of the Claimant’s claims (in

regard to the Junin concessions) on the ground of inadmissibility.

The Tribunal also notes that this is is not a case where an essential part of the
Claimant’s claim is necessarily founded upon its own illegal acts or omissions,
regardless of any defence by the Respondent. In other words, this case is materially
different from cases such as World Duty Free v Kenya or (more recently) Al-Warraq
v Indonesia where the claim, as a cause of action, was directly based from the

beginning upon the claimant’s own illegal act.*”

Summary: For these several reasons, the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s
objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction and (as regards the Junin concessions) the
admissibility of the Claimant’s claims. Accordingly, the Tribunal has here also
decided, in substance, the principal issues listed in Part 2 above, under Paragraphs 2.3

to 2.10.

PART 6 - LIABILITY AND CAUSATION

A: Introduction

6.1.

6.2.

6.3.

6.4.

In brief, the Claimant contends that the Respondent has violated its obligations under
the Treaty, including its obligations to pay compensation upon the direct or indirect
expropriation of the Claimant’s investments, to provide fair and equitable treatment
and full protection and security to the Claimant and its investments (the FET and FPS
standards), and to provide national treatment in regard to the Claimant’s investments

in Ecuador, thereby breaching Articles II, IV and VIII of the Treaty.!

In brief, the Respondent rejects these claims, contending that the Junin concessions
were revoked as part of a legitimate reform of the Respondent’s mining regime, that
the Chaucha and Telimbela concessions have never been expropriated, and that

ENAMI was not granted more favourable treatment by the Respondent.”

It will be necessary to summarise the Parties’ respective submissions before setting
out the Tribunal’s analyses and decisions. For that purpose, it is appropriate to take
each of the Parties principal claims and defences in turn. In so doing, the Tribunal
notes that the Claimant bears the legal burden of establishing its positive case against
the Respondent in respect of each claim. As for the Respondent, it bears the legal
burden of proving its positive defences. For both Parties, the standard of proof for their
factual allegations requires the Tribunal to be satisfied on a balance of probabilities: it

is not sufficient at this stage of the proceedings to prove only a prima facie case.

For ease of reference below, the names of Ascendant Copper and the Claimant (Copper
Mesa) as concessionaires are used interchangeably, given their common legal entity:

as already indicated, the name-change took place in July 2008.

B: Unlawful Expropriation

6.5.

The Claimant submits that it owned “real property” as investments in Ecuador within

the meaning of the Treaty, namely its three mining concessions, which had been

validly granted by the Respondent for thirty-year terms and were subject only to one
condition, that of paying the annual conservation patent fees, which (as is not disputed

by the Respondent) were paid on time.*

The Claimant contends that the Respondent however: (i) directly expropriated the
Junin concessions by formally extinguishing title to the Golden 1 and Golden 2
concessions (with Magdalena) via the Nullification Resolutions and the Termination
Resolutions applying the Mining Mandate, (ii) indirectly expropriated the Claimant’s
interest in Ascendant Ecuador (“AE”) by taking all its material assets, thereby
destroying the entire value of its shares and (iii) indirectly expropriated the Chaucha
and Telimbela concessions by disclosing their inclusion on the list of projects to be
directly expropriated by the Respondent (without compensation) under Article 24 of
the 2009 Mining Law, thereby also creating a “serious title defect” to the Chaucha

concession.*

The Claimant contends that these were unlawful expropriations under the Treaty as no
compensation was paid, they were not taken for a public purpose, they were not carried
out according to due process of law, and they singled out the Claimant’s investments
in a discriminatory manner. The Claimant further contends that the Respondent
violated Article VIII of the Treaty, which required prompt, adequate and effective
compensation to be paid by the Respondent to the Claimant for both direct and indirect

expropriation.>

C: The Junin Concessions

6.8.

With respect to the Junin concessions, the Claimant contends that it is well established
that the revocation by the host State of a concession (or a license) needed to carry on
a business activity constitutes an expropriation of the investment. The Claimant further
contends that such a revocation, by depriving the subsidiary of its ability to carry on
the business for which it was created, has an effect equivalent to its nationalisation. It
submits that this is all the more so in this case where the mining concessions
constituted the only material assets of the Claimant’s project companies, without

which they became worthless empty shells.° The Claimant relies on several decisions

to such effect made by arbitration tribunals: Goetz v. Burundi, Middle East Cement v.

Egypt, Tecmed v. Mexico and CME v. Czech Republic.

The Respondent for its part contends that it is well established under international law
that a non-discriminatory regulation, adopted for a public purpose and enacted in
accordance with due process, does not amount to expropriation, and even less, to unfair
and inequitable treatment.’ The Respondent relies on the award in Methanex v. USA
where the tribunal stated that: “as a matter of general international law, a non-
discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with
due process and, which affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not
deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given
by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating

investment that the government would refrain from such regulation”.®

Likewise, the Respondent cites the decision in Chemtura Corporation v. Canada,
where the tribunal stated that: “the Tribunal considers in any event that the measures
challenged by the Claimant constituted a valid exercise of the Respondent’s police
powers. [...] the PMRA took measures within its mandate, in a non-discriminatory
manner, motivated by the increasing awareness of the dangers presented by lindane
for human health and the environment. A measure adopted under such circumstances
is a valid exercise of the State’s police powers and, as a result, does not constitute an
expropriation”. The Respondent further refers to other decisions following the same
reasoning by several other tribunals: Saluka Investments BV v. Czech Republic,
Tecmed v. Mexico, Feldman v. Mexico, and Suez Sociedad General de Aguas

Barcelona SA and InterAgua Servicios Integrales del Agua SA v. Argentina.'°

The Respondent contends that the 2008 Mining Mandate and the 2009 Mining Law
are measures issued by the State in the exercise of its legitimate regulatory authority
and police powers, responding to a compelling public policy consideration (the need
to consult the affected local population), seeking to address the many social, economic

and environmental issues that remained unsolved (which could not be addressed

effectively under the earlier legal regime) and to establish a more stable and efficient
regulatory regime.'' The Respondent further submits that the Mining Mandate was
enacted in accordance with due process by a Constituent Assembly elected on the basis
of a national referendum; and that it was non-discriminatory. The Respondent records
that, apart from the Junin concessions, 1,334 other concessions were terminated by the
Mining Mandate and a total of over 1,026 concessions were terminated under Article

1 of the Mining Mandate. '*

The Respondent denies that the Nullification Resolutions amounted to expropriation,
as they were overturned upon appeal. As to the Termination Resolutions, the
Respondent contends that they were made in a valid application of both Ecuadorian
law and international law as a result of the concessionaire’s failure to submit a valid
EIS.'° In addition, as measures taken pursuant to the Mining Mandate, the Termination
Resolutions were also legitimate public policy measures. ' Therefore, so the
Respondent concludes, these measures do not amount to expropriation under the

Treaty.

The Claimant submits that none of the measures challenged by the Claimant fall within
the ‘police powers’ exception that is recognised by international law'> and that the
Mining Mandate was not enacted for a ‘public purpose’.!° In turn, the Respondent
rejects the allegation that it has abused its police powers and submits, there being
nothing on the face of the Mining Mandate or measures that could support this, that is
the end of the matter as regards the Treaty. The Respondent further claims that the
Claimant has not produced any credible evidence to support its argument that the
Respondent abused its regulatory authority towards the Claimant. The Respondent
contends that the public policy goal of the Mining Mandate is clear, as set out in its

preamble. '”

The Respondent contends that even if this Tribunal were to find that the 2008 Mining

Mandate, the 2009 Mining Law and the Termination Resolutions were in their effects

expropriatory, they do not qualify as breaches of the Treaty because they fall under the

general exception provided by Article XVII(3) of the Treaty!®.
Article XVII(3) provides as follows:

“Article XVII. Application and General Exceptions

 

3. Provided that such measures are not applied in an arbitrary or unjustifiable
manner, or do not constitute a disguised restriction on international trade
or investment, nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a
Contracting Party from adopting or maintaining measures, including

environmental measures:

(a) necessary to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not

inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement;

(b

necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health; or

(c

relating to the conservation of living or non-living exhaustible natural

resources.”

According to the Respondent, the Mining Mandate was adopted for the legitimate
public policy purposes of protecting public health and the environment where the
requirement to consult the local population on the basis of an EIS was specifically
intended to protect the residents and local communities and to reduce the
environmental impacts of mining activities. The Termination Resolutions were
necessary to implement the Mining Mandate. These measures were not, according to
the Respondent, arbitrary, unjustifiable or inconsistent with the Treaty. Therefore, so
the Respondent submits, these measures cannot amount to breaches of the Treaty, by

virtue of Article XVII(3).!°

The Claimant contends, however, that the Nullification Resolutions were applied in an
arbitrary and unjustifiable manner towards the Claimant, and that the Mining Mandate

and the Termination Resolutions were also arbitrary, as they were both exempt from

any form of judicial review and were measures taken outside the normal rule of law in
Ecuador.”° Hence, so the Claimant concludes, Article XVII(3) is inapplicable to its

claims for expropriation.

6.18. The Respondent contends that the Nullification Resolutions however never took effect,
as they were suspended following an appeal and were subsequently overturned; that
the Mining Mandate was issued by a competent body, duly constituted by the
Constituent Assembly and that the Termination Resolutions were subject to a variety
of legal recourses.”! The Respondent further contends that it is not the Tribunal’s task
to second-guess an assessment of the need for the Mining Mandate, absent any
evidence of abuse of the host State’s regulatory authority, and that these measures fall

under the exceptions in Article XVII(3) of the Treaty.?”

6.19. | The Claimant contends that even if these measures were taken for legitimate policy
objectives (as the Respondent contends), its liability is not excused under the Treaty
where lawful expropriations must be for a public purpose and must be accompanied
by the appropriate payment of compensation.”* Similarly, the expropriation of other
mining concessions under these laws does not excuse the taking of the Claimant’s
investments.”* The Claimant contends that this is not a case about the economic impact
of bona fide regulatory measures, but rather a case about an actual taking targeting the

Claimant’s investments.”>
D: The Chaucha and Telimbela Concessions

6.20. With respect to the Chaucha and Telimbela concessions, the Claimant contends that
they were indirectly expropriated by the Respondent because, even if their title was
not taken or formally extinguished, the measures taken by the Respondent left them

without any value for the Claimant.”° According to the Claimant, even if the “cloud

on the title” of these concessions were to have been subsequently lifted (it was not),

the duration of the Respondent’s conduct amounted to their indirect expropriation.”

6.21. | The Respondent denies the existence of a “list of projects” under Article 24 of the 2009
Mining Law and contends that such a list (as alleged by the Claimant) was merely an
internal and confidential technical report that cannot and does not amount to

expropriation under the Treaty.?*

6.22. The Respondent further contends that no measures were actually taken under Article
24 against the Chaucha or Telimbela concessions.’ Moreover, the Respondent
contends that if the Claimant truly believed that the draft memorandum prepared by
the National Geological Services (but never published) created a ‘cloud’ on its title, it
could and should have requested a clarification from the Government, which it did
not.*? According to the Respondent, no breach of the Treaty can be claimed if the
investor has failed to seek reasonable redress before the local authorities before turning
to investment protection under the Treaty.*! The Claimant contends that any such

efforts would have been “futile” in the circumstances.*

6.23. | The Claimant contends that international law does not require legal formalities such

as the formal extinction of legal title of these concessions under Article 24. There was

tribunal explained that “it is recognized by international law that measures taken by a State can interfere with
property rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered so useless that they must be deemed to have been
expropriated, even though the State does not purport to have expropriated them and the legal title to the property
formally remains with the original owner.” The Claimant also relies on the decision in Metalclad v. Mexico (CLA-

redress from national authorities disqualifies the international claim, not because there is a requirement of
exhaustion of local remedies but because the very reality of conduct tantamount to expropriation is doubtful in the
absence of a reasonable — not necessarily exhaustive — effort by the investor to obtain correction.” The Respondent

here, so the Claimant contends, an indirect expropriation or a violation of the
Respondent’s obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment under the Treaty. The
enactment of Article 24 of the 2009 Mining Law, combined with the Respondent’s
repeated public declarations that Article 24 would be used to revert legal title to the
Chaucha and Telimbela projects, is sufficient to allow the Claimant to claim for the

lost opportunity to sell these projects at their fair market value, as it wished.

The Respondent also contends that there can be no expropriation where the investor
maintains overall control over its investment.** The Respondent submits that this test
is not met in this case as the Chaucha concession has been renewed and is currently
being exploited, while the Telimbela concession has been relinquished by

its concessionaire.*>

international law, and full protection and security, thereby violating Article II of the

Treaty, by the following acts:

(i) revoking the legal framework that applied to the mining concessions that were
the fundamental basis of the Claimant’s investments by adopting the
Nullification Resolutions, the Termination Resolutions and Article 24 of the

2009 Mining Law;

(ii) through these same measures, acting contrary to specific representations
contained in the concessions (confirmed on numerous occasions) to the effect
that the Claimant’s subsidiaries had a right of exploration and development

within the concession areas;

constituting a denial of due process. The Claimant submits that it relied on the 2000
Mining Law and the security of tenure of the mining concessions for thirty years
provided under that legislation. It further claims that, according to the 2000 Mining
Law, there was no deadline for obtaining the approval of an EIS;*? and that delays in
the approval process would not jeopardise the mining rights granted by the
concessions.*° The Claimant adds that, from a legal perspective, local opposition to
mining and local political opposition are not valid grounds for terminating valid
mining concessions.*! The Claimant contends that the EIS was the only legal
requirement that Ascendant Ecuador needed to begin mining operations, and that a
“social license” was not a legal requirement; if it was “soft law”, then by definition, it
was a voluntary undertaking and not a legal obligation imposed upon Ascendant

Ecuador.”

6.29. According to the Claimant, these legal guarantees were revoked by the 2008 Mining
Mandate, which was not based on any recognisable rule of law, but rather on the basis
of a non-legal, political exercise of powers by the Respondent.*? The Claimant submits
that the Termination Resolutions were issued in a manner that violated due process, as
they were issued without giving to the Claimant or the concessionaire any opportunity
to comply with the Mining Mandate, and without providing for any recourse against

the Termination Resolutions.*

6.30. |The Respondent rejects these claims. The Respondent contends that the Termination
Resolutions with respect to the Junin concessions were taken following the failure of

Ascendant Ecuador to respect and comply with a legal framework in place since

2000.*5 The Respondent submits that the EIS was already required under existing
legislation, from the 1991 Mining Law onwards. Likewise, the obligation to carry out
local consultation and the right of the Respondent to annul a concession if this
obligation was not complied with had been included since at least 1997 in Article 29(d)
of the Environmental Regulation for Mining Activities (Reglamento Ambiental para
las Actividades Mineras, or “RAAM”), adopted in September 1997, and, since 1999,
in Article 28 of the Environmental Management Law (Ley de Gestién Ambiental, or

“LGA” or “EMA”), adopted in July 1999.4

The Claimant contends that the Article 28 of the EMA applies to contracts and not to
concessions, providing in relevant part that “non-compliance with the consultation
procedure referred to in Article 88 of the [Constitution] renders unenforceable the
activity to which it refers and renders null the respective contracts”.*” According to the
Respondent, this reference to “contracts” stems from the concept in the EMA of
concessions as a form of administrative contract under Article 26 of the EMA.** The
Respondent contends that every mining concession included the requirement to
comply with environmental laws, in particular the EMA; and that the application of
Article 28 of the EMA to mining concessions was uncontested when Ascendant

Ecuador appealed against the Termination Resolutions.*?

The Respondent contends that the local consultation and EIS requirements existed
before the 2008 Mining Mandate. The Respondent submits that the Mining Mandate’s
only novelty was that instead of the Government having a discretion as to whether or
not to revoke the concession in a case of failure to carry out the consultation process,
the revocation became mandatory in such a case.*’ The Respondent contends that
before the Mining Mandate, in practice, the State’s power to terminate mining
concessions was not exercised, which resulted in an unsustainable situation. Therefore,
the State, through Ministerial Orders No. 062 and 076, implemented measures to
oblige concessionaires to comply with the obligation to consult without terminating

mining concessions. However, ultimately, the mandatory revocation under Article 1

of the Mining Mandate was necessary when all efforts to bring concessionaires into

compliance with the obligation to consult had failed.*!

6.33. | The Respondent submits that no concessionaire could have reasonably expected that
the Respondent would never terminate mining concessions that were in breach of the
applicable law and in respect of which the exercise of the fundamental right of prior
consultation had been denied to the affected local population.*? Furthermore, the
Respondent contends that Ascendant Ecuador had more than reasonable notice of the
impending legal reforms, that it failed to bring itself into compliance with the
applicable laws by obtaining the necessary consents from the local communities, and

that such failure is entirely the Claimant’ s own fault (with Ascendant Ecuador).*?

6.34. In addition, the Respondent contends that there is nothing in the terms of the
concessions that precludes subsequent legal reform such as the one brought about by
the Mining Mandate. The Respondent submits such legal reform is fully consistent
with international standards, and, contrary to the Claimant’s arguments, was passed by
a Constitutional Assembly in accordance with its mandate.*4 According to the
Respondent, a State can exercise its legitimate regulatory authority and the investor
cannot complain of any frustration of its expectations, absent a specific commitment

by the State not to modify the relevant laws and regulations.*>

The Respondent denies having made such commitment to the Claimant.*° It contends
that Ecuadorian law, having been subject to frequent changes,*’ the Claimant cannot
legitimately claim to have expected that there would be no change in the field of
mining law.** The Respondent contends that the circumstances of the host State are to
be taken into account by a tribunal. *® The Respondent submits that, in the
circumstances of the present case, it is important to keep in mind that the determination
of whether the investor’s alleged expectations existed, or were indeed legitimate, is
not limited in terms of time to the making of the investment; and that the investor has
a duty to conduct its business in a reasonable manner and in good faith, in order to be
able to claim protection under the FET standard. It submits that the Claimant’s
operation of its investments in Junin failed to meet the requirements of good faith

and reasonableness.

The Respondent also denies that the Termination Resolutions were adopted for
“political” reasons or as a result of political lobbying. The Respondent insists that they
were legitimate measures taken to implement the Mining Mandate, which served
legitimate public policy purposes and addressed issues of serious public concern. The

Respondent contends that the Mining Mandate did not target the Junin concessions.°!

The Claimant submits that the Termination Resolutions were discriminatory, because
only the Junin concessions were cancelled, whereas approval of an EIS was not
required for other concession holders to maintain their titles.° The Respondent
submits that the Mining Mandate and the Termination Resolutions were non-
discriminatory as (as already indicated), and that, apart from the Junin concessions,
more than 1,000 other concessions were terminated pursuant to the Mining Mandate.

Mandate was the cause of termination in many of these cases.°* The Respondent
submits that the termination procedure was in each case the same and was no different
for the termination of the Junin concessions.™ Moreover, the Respondent denies that

other concessionaires were not required to submit an EIS.

6.38. | The Respondent also denies that the Mining Mandate or the Termination Resolutions
violated due process and that Ascendant Ecuador did not have any right to independent
review of the Termination Resolutions. Ascendant Ecuador, although unsuccessful,
filed claims for extraordinary constitutional relief.©° The Respondent further contends
that there were multiple forms of recourse available to Ascendant Ecuador to challenge
the Termination Resolutions; namely: recurso de reposicién, recurso de apelacion,
recurso extraordinario de revisiOn, recurso subjetivo o de plena jurisdicci6n, recurso
de casaci6n, accién extraordinaria de proteccién and accién de proteccién. The
Respondent contends that Ascendant Ecuador could have filed appeals as late as three

years after the date of the Termination Resolutions. It failed to do so.

s 216-219. The Respondent contends in this sense that the Ministry of Mines did
not allow the submission of a further EIS after the termination of the Junin concessions. On 7 November 2008, the
Ministry published a table describing the status as at 17 April 2008 of all mining concession holders with respect
to the submission of an EIS. Given the very large number of concessions and the possibility of errors, the Ministry
issued three public announcements informing potentially affected concession holders that they could challenge the
ssessment made by filing supporting document within five days. The Respondent denies that this means that the
Ministry would accept the submission of a new EIS prepared within five days, which was impossible.

6.40. |The Respondent contends that, even assuming that the Claimant had proven its case as
regards liability, according to the well-established principle of contributory fault, the
Claimant should not be awarded any compensation with respect to the Junin
concessions.’! The Respondent submits that the Claimant’s own actions, including its
fraudulent acquisition of the concessions and other unlawful actions creating social
conflict in the area that delayed and ultimately prevented the completion of the
consultation process, contributed to the termination of these concessions by increasing
the risks associated with mining projects in Junin, an area with strong resistance to

mining.

6.41. | The Claimant contends that, while the principle of contributory fault is recognized in
international law, arbitral practice supports a restrictive application of this principle.
In particular, the Claimant cites Occidental v. Ecuador where the tribunal held that: “it
is not any contribution by the injured party to the damage which it has suffered which
will trigger a finding of contributory negligence. The contribution must be material

and significant”. The Claimant contends that such is not this case.”
G: The Chaucha and Telimbela Concessions

6.42. With respect to the Chaucha and Telimbela concessions, the Claimant contends that

revocation of the security of tenure relied upon by the Claimant to make its
investments. The Claimant also contends that the Respondent confirmed that these
concessions were free and clear of prior interests and that the rights could be enjoyed
for a thirty-year term. Therefore, so the Claimant submits, the Respondent’s conduct

amounted to unfair and inequitable treatment in breach of the Treaty’s FET standard.”4

The Respondent contends, as noted above, that Article 24 was never applied to these
concessions, and that, if the Claimant believed that the draft memorandum that it had
obtained through Nortec (unlawfully) created a cloud on its legal title over the Chaucha
concession, it should have sought to clarify the Respondent’s position.” It did not do
so. The Respondent further contends that there is no evidence that the Claimant has
been treated in any way in an unfair or unjust manner.’° It makes the same submission

with respect to the Telimbela concession.””

H: The FPS Standard

6.44.

6.45.

According to the Claimant, the FPS standard in the Treaty required the Respondent to
exercise due diligence to protect the physical and legal security of the Claimant’s
investments against attacks by private persons.’® The Claimant contends that the
Respondent failed to provide the Claimant’s investments with both the physical and
the legal security required by Article II(b) of the Treaty, given that the Respondent
terminated the Junin concessions on the grounds that Ascendant Ecuador had not
completed the consultation process. That failure, so the Claimant alleges, was solely
attributable to the Respondent’s failure to act with due diligence to guarantee the
physical security of Ascendant Ecuador’s employees and its subsequent suspension of

any further activity by Ascendant Ecuador in the Junin area.”

The Respondent disagrees. It contends that the Claimant has not established that the
Respondent failed to ensure the physical security of the Claimant’s investments, and

that the Claimant’s own paramilitary forces provoked the violent confrontations with

the local communities. *° The Respondent submits that pursuant to the tripartite
agreements, its police forces were effectively deployed; but that it was Ascendant
Ecuador that failed to implement the tripartite agreements. *! According to the
Respondent, in these circumstances, there is no basis whatsoever to argue that the
Respondent in any way failed to comply with any obligation to ensure full protection
and security of the Claimant’s concessions in Junin in breach of the Treaty’s FPS

standard.®?

6.46. The Respondent notes (in its Rejoinder) that whilst the Claimant asserts breach of the
FET standard with respect to the Junin, Chaucha and Telimbela concessions, the
Claimant only asserts a failure to provide full protection and security with respect to

the Junin concessions.*?
I: National Treatment

6.47. | The Claimant next contends that the Respondent violated Article IV of the Treaty
granting more favourable treatment to the investments of one of its own investors,
ENAMI, with respect to the expansion, management, conduct and operation of the

Junin, Chaucha and Telimbela concessions, than it granted to the Claimant.*4

6.48. | The Claimant submits that the national treatment standard requires a three-prong test:
(i) identification of relevant subjects of comparison; (ii) consideration of the treatment
each comparator receives; and (iii) consideration of any factors that may justify the

1.85

differential treatment.*’ The Claimant identifies ENAMI as operating in the same

business sector as the Claimant and its Ecuadorian subsidiaries. It submits that ENAMI
was granted de jure more favourable treatment by being granted a preferential right of
first refusal on the mining projects by virtue of Article 20 of the General Regulations
to the 2009 Mining Law. According to the Claimant, this difference in treatment was

not justified and existed only to unjustly enrich the Respondent.*°

PART 6 — Page 17 of 39

6.49. According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s claim appears to be based on the
argument that the fact that the mere existence of the preferential right qualifies as a
breach of the Treaty, whether or not any of its three mining projects were in fact
granted to ENAMI, and whether or not the Claimant itself has applied for renewal of
the concession.*” The Respondent submits that this claim fails because: (i) the General
Regulations to the 2009 Mining Law establishing ENAMI’s preferential rights were
only issued on 4 November 2009, (ii) the Claimant’s theory would imply that the
Respondent could have breached the Treaty after the Claimant had already lost or
disposed of its investments, and (iii) the concessions have not been granted to ENAMI
(nor has ENAMI applied for them), although the Respondent agrees that ENAMI has
been granted a concession that partially overlaps with the area of the Junin concessions

(ie. the Llurimagua concession).**

6.50. | The Respondent also submits that the Claimant failed to re-apply for the concessions
and, therefore, even if ENAMI held all three concessions in dispute, it could not
amount to any discriminatory treatment. *? In any case, ENAMI did not use its
preferential right under the 2009 Mining Law to obtain the Llurimagua concession.”
Furthermore, as ENAMI’s preferential rights are based on its status as a State-owned
national mining company and not its Ecuadorian nationality, and no other Ecuadorian
investor enjoys the same right, this could not amount to unlawful discrimination on

the basis of nationality under the Treaty.”!

6.57.

As regards the Junin concessions, it is appropriate in this case to start backwards in
time, beginning with the Termination Resolutions of 12 November 2008 made under

Article 1 of the Mining Mandate: see the factual chronology recited in Part 4 above.

The Termination Resolutions: It will be recalled that Article 1 of the Mining Mandate,
promulgated on 18 April 2008, provided for the termination, without economic
compensation, for certain defined mining concessions; namely those “without any
investment in project development having been made to their exploration stage by 31
December 2007 or without their environmental impact study [EIS] having been
submitted or without a prior referendum process having been conducted ...” (see the

full text recited in Part 3 above, with the original Spanish text in Part 4 above).

In October 2008, the Under-Secretary of Mines established that the Junin concessions
fell within such definition and ordered the Regional Mining Director of Pichincha to
terminate the Junin concessions without any compensation on the grounds that: (i)

consultations had not been carried out by the concessionaire.

On 12 November 2008, pursuant to such order and Article 1 of the Mining Mandate,
the regional mining director terminated the Junin concessions without any economic
compensation, with no prior notice to the concessionaire and no prior opportunity for
the concessionaire to make any representations in its defence. Although the Claimant
subsequently sought to appeal to the National Mining Director from the Termination
Resolutions on 18 November 2008, it was informed by the Ministry of Mines on 1
December 2008 that no appeal was possible on the basis of Article 12 of the Mining
Mandate. Indeed, no effective appeal was possible, despite further attempts to do so

by the Claimant in 2009 and 2010.

Accordingly, the Termination Resolutions were implemented, without payment of any
compensation to the Claimant and without any effective opportunity for the Claimant
to appeal against such uncompensated termination (including the amount of
compensation) before any administrative or judicial organ competent to hear and

decide such an appeal on its merits within the Ecuadorian legal system.

In these circumstances, the first issue is whether there was any expropriation of the

Junin concessions within the meaning of the Treaty, as a matter of international law.

PART 6 — Page 19 of 39

As regards a measure amounting to a direct expropriation under the Treaty, the
Tribunal considers that its constituent legal parts requires: (i) that the measure deprive
the investor of its investment permanently; (ii) that the resulting deprivation finds no
justification as the legitimate exercise of the Respondent’s police or regulatory powers
and (iii) the non-application of Article XVII(3) of the Treaty. The primary issues here
concern the second and third requirements: a revocation can amount to a permanent
deprivation, as did the Termination Resolutions; but the Respondent seeks to justify
that revocation as a legitimate response to a social and political problem confronting
the nation as a whole, for which international law provides no remedy and in respect
of which Article XVII(3) separately provides an express exception. In the present case,

as explained below, the second and third requirements turn on the same factors.

As to deprivation, the test under the Treaty and international law is the substantial
deprivation or the complete or near complete deprivation of an investment.”* As was
decided by the ICSID tribunal in CMS v Argentina, the question turns on whether the
enjoyment of the investment “has been effectively neutralized”.*> The Tribunal
decides that the effect of the Termination Resolutions was effectively to neutralize the

Claimant’s investment in the Junin concession amounting to substantial deprivation.

As to justification, the Tribunal notes Paragraph 712 of the American Law Institute’s
Third Restatement of Foreign Relations Law: “A State is not responsible for loss of
property or for other economic disadvantage resulting from bona fide general taxation,
regulation, forfeiture for crime, or other action of the kind that is commonly accepted
as within the police power of States, if it is not discriminatory ...”.*4 It also notes the
statement in Methanex v USA: “As a matter of general international law, a non-
discriminatory regulation for a public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with
due process and, which affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not
deemed expropriatory and compensable unless specific commitments had been given

by the regulating government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating

investment that the government would refrain from such regulation.”®° It likewise
notes the statement in Tecmed v Mexico: “The principle that the State’s exercise of its
sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause economic
damage to those subject to its powers as administrator without entitling them to any

compensation whatsoever is undisputable.”°

In the Tribunal’s view, as a general matter, the Claimant took the risk of changes in
the legal and regulatory regime upon making its long-term investments in Ecuador.
There were in the present case no specific commitments, representations or assurances
to the Claimant that the Respondent would refrain from such regulation. The Tribunal
acknowledges that a specific commitment, assurance or representation is not always
necessary to a claim advanced under an FET standard. However, even in their absence,
the investor must still establish a relevant expectation based upon reasonable grounds.
The Tribunal decides that the Claimant has not established, on the evidence, any
legitimate expectation to prevent the application of such general changes adversely

affecting its investments.

As was stated in AES v Hungary: “... any reasonably informed business person or
investor knows that laws can evolve in accordance with the perceived political or
policy dictates of the times”; and “the fact that an issue becomes a political matter, ...
does not mean that the existence of a rational policy is erased.” °’ The Tribunal refers
to the several decisions to the same effect cited by the Respondent, as recorded above.
It would be possible to add many similar statements from other decisions made by

investment arbitration tribunals. It is unnecessary to do so here.

In the Tribunal’s view, the applicable legal standards under international law are not
here in doubt. The primary issue is whether, in the circumstances, the Termination

Resolutions were made in accordance with due process and not in arbitrary manner.

The Tribunal emphasises that its inquiry stems from the Termination Resolutions. It is
no part of this Tribunal’s function under the Treaty to decide for itself what was or
was not in the national interests of the Respondent, its citizens or the local population.

It is not a regulator. The Tribunal therefore defers to the Respondent’s sovereign right,

as regulator, to determine what lies within its national interest. Nor is the Tribunal, as
regards expropriation, competent to decide upon the revocations of other concessions,
said to exceed 1,000 in number, made by the Respondent pursuant to the same national
interest. Further, the Tribunal does not here question the national policies, or public
purposes, which led to the 2008 Mining Mandate and 2009 Mining Law. It is possible
that the Respondent could have expropriated the Junin concessions lawfully under both
its domestic law and international law; but it could not do so unlawfully inconsistently

with its obligations under the Treaty.

The Tribunal also emphasises that its decision regarding the Termination Resolutions
cannot be taken in the abstract, but, rather, must take into account the relevant
circumstances, including the preceding events of 2007 and 2008. The Termination
Resolutions did not come out of a clear blue sky on 12 November 2008: they formed
part of a history that marks their legal character. It is this history that, in the Tribunal’s

view, is ultimately decisive for the present case.

The Tribunal decides that the Termination Resolutions, as implemented, are
attributable to the Respondent under international law. That much is not apparently in
dispute. Given the circumstances, explained below, the Tribunal also decides that the
Termination Resolutions were no mere regulatory measures, because, in the
circumstances, these Resolutions were made in an arbitrary manner and without due

process.

Accordingly, given its introductory proviso, Article XV(II)(3) of the Treaty is
inapplicable; and the permanent taking of the Claimant’s Junin concessions, was an
expropriation under Article VIII of the Treaty. Further, given the absence of any
compensation and due process upon such expropriation, the Tribunal decides that it
was an unlawful expropriation in breach of Article VII of the Treaty, as well a breach

of the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty.

As regards unlawful expropriation, it is indisputable that the Termination Resolutions
were not made or implemented “against prompt, adequate and effective compensation”
as required by Article VIII(1) of the Treaty. Further, they were made and implemented
without any “prompt review by a judicial or other independent authority” of the

Respondent within the meaning of Articles VITI(1) and (2) of the Treaty.

Despite its best efforts, the Claimant had no effective remedies under Ecuadorian law
to challenge the Termination Resolutions, the absence of due process or the non-
payment of any compensation. It is no answer for the Respondent to assert that no such
compensation, legal remedy or administrative review were permitted, in theory, under
the Mining Mandate or otherwise under its national laws: the Treaty, to which the
Respondent had voluntarily agreed, imposed higher standards as a matter of
international law; and it does not require an investor to pursue ineffective legal

remedies when its goose is well and truly cooked.

As regards the breach of the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the Treaty, the
Termination Resolutions lie at the end of a history of arbitrary conduct taken against

the Claimant in the Respondent’s name, as described separately below.

The Tribunal does not consider, on the evidence, that a separate breach has been
established by the Claimant under Article IV of the Treaty in regard to national
treatment. The Tribunal acknowledges that this standard does not require the Claimant
to prove that the Respondent’s conduct was motivated by the Claimant’s foreign
nationality.°* Yet, there must be proof of a materially different treatment of another in
like circumstances at a relevant time. The evidence regarding ENAMI (by itself or
with the Chilean state mining company) comes too late (after the Termination
Resolutions) and is in any event too equivocal. Moreover, even if there were such a
breach, it would add nothing to the unlawful expropriation of the Junin concessions,
as regards liability, causation and quantum. Hence, for present purposes, this claim can

be rejected summarily.

The Nullification Resolutions: Proceeding backwards in time, the Tribunal does not
consider, on the evidence, that the Respondent violated Articles II(2)(a), IV or VIII of
the Treaty in regard to the Nullification Resolutions of 25 January 2008. The Claimant
appealed from these resolutions; and, as a result of its successful appeal, they were
revoked by order of the Ministry of Mining’s National Director on 15 September 2008:

see the chronology recited in Part 4 above.

Whilst the Claimant was, in theory, temporarily deprived during the intervening period

from 25 January to 15 September 2008 of its full rights of use and enjoyment of the

Junin concessions within the Junin area, it is not apparent from the evidence that the
Claimant was then in fact exercising such rights. Even before January 2008, the
Claimant had confirmed to the Under-Secretary of Mines by letter dated 24 October
2007 that it was not maintaining any activity in the Junin area: see Part 4 above.
Moreover, even if, in practice, the Claimant was deprived of its full rights, such
deprivation did not amount to the substantial deprivation or the complete or near
complete deprivation of its investment required by the Treaty and international law,

given its successful appeal.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that no liability arises from the Nullification
Resolutions under the Treaty, as alleged by the Claimant. However, as a factual matter,
the Tribunal notes that the Nullification Resolutions, having failed to achieve their
intended purpose with the Claimant’s successful appeal, were followed within a month
by the Termination Resolutions. It also notes that the Claimant’s inactivity in the Junin
area during 2008 resulted from (inter alia) earlier interventions by the Ministry itself.
Hence, it is next necessary to turn to these earlier historical events, including (in

particular) those earlier interventions.

The Ministry’s Earlier Interventions: The Tribunal has set out at length the factual
evidence, as it sees it, relevant to the difficult situation confronting both the Ministry
of Energy and Mines (“MEM”) and the Claimant in 2006 and 2007: see the chronology
above in Part 4. It is unnecessary to repeat the details here and only necessary to state

the Tribunal’s conclusions relevant to this analysis.

In brief, under the Treaty, the Tribunal cannot fault the Ministry or, more broadly, the
Respondent, for the Claimant’s increasing difficulties up to March 2007, including the
Claimant’s physical access to the Junin concessions. These difficulties did not
constitute by themselves violations of the Treaty. Moreover, they were caused by third
persons (whose conduct is not attributable to the Respondent) and, particularly from
the summer of 2006 onwards, many were materially self-inflicted by the Claimant
itself. However, it is necessary to examine more closely the Respondent’s conduct

from March 2007 onwards.

On 29 March 2007, the tripartite agreements were successfully brokered by the
MEM’s Under-Secretary. This was an exercise in good government; and the

Respondent’s initiatives did not, in the Tribunal’s view, attract any liability under the

PART 6 — Page 24 of 39

6.78.

6.79.

6.80.

Treaty. To the contrary, the MEM’s interventions in December 2006 onwards up to 29
March 2007 probably saved the Claimant’s Junin concessions from suffering the same
fate as befell Bishimetal in May 1997. However, those agreements were not
successfully implemented by both sides, albeit without fault attributable to the
Respondent under the Treaty. By that stage, the mutual hostilities between anti-miners
and pro-miners, the latter actively supported by the Claimant, had gone far too far for

any easy remedy, including a successful intervention from the Government in Quito.

By letter dated 12 July 2007, the Ministry tried to appease the anti-miners by restricting
the Claimant’s farming and community activities. Given the subterfuge and other
methods previously used by the Claimant and those it supported locally, these non-
mining activities were seen as socially divisive and exacerbating tensions within the
affected communities. At that stage, the Ministry did not attempt to stop the Claimant’ s
activities as concessionaire in regard to the EIS, including consultation. Those attempts
began with the meeting on 8 August 2007 (albeit framed as a request made by the
Ministry); and they culminated on 25 September 2007 with an instruction that the
Claimant suspend all activities in the Junin concessions in the form of a resolution by

the Pichincha Regional Mining Director.

That resolution effectively made it legally impossible for the Claimant to complete the
EIS, quite apart from the illegal roadblocks and other impediments vigorously
maintained by the anti-miners. Although the Claimant sought to appeal against that
resolution, it was compelled by letter dated 24 October 2007 to the Under-Secretary
of Mines to confirm that it was no longer maintaining any activity in the Junin area.
Accordingly, the Claimant could not proceed to complete its EIS, by deliberate act of
the Respondent, from late September 2007 onwards to 12 November 2008 when the
Termination Resolutions were issued by the Respondent. Without a completed EIS,

the Termination Resolutions were an inevitable consequence.

The Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant’s allegations of any breach of the Treaty
by the Respondent before 24 September 2007. For the subsequent 14-month period
from 24 September 2007 to 13 November 2008, the question arises whether the
Respondent was in breach of Article II of the Treaty, whether under its FET standard

or its FPS standard.

PART 6 — Page 25 of 39

6.81.

6.82.

6.83.

Neither standard as expressed in the Treaty imposes an absolute obligation on the host
State. Under this FET standard, there is a balancing exercise permitted to the host
State, weighing the legitimate interests of the foreign investor with the legitimate
interests of the host State and others, including (especially) its own citizens and local
residents.°® Under the FPS standard, the obligation of the host State does not attract
strict liability but imposes a lesser duty more akin to the exercise of due diligence.'
Both standards can require active, and not merely passive, conduct by the host State

that may go beyond the mere abstention from prejudicial conduct. !°!

For present purposes, although the FET and FPS standards impose legally distinct
obligations under the Treaty, it is not necessary to distinguish between them. The issue
is much the same: should the Respondent have imposed its will on the anti-miners,
acting with all the powers and forces available to a sovereign State, so as to ensure that
the Claimant, as the concessionaire under concessions granted by the Respondent,
could gain access to the Junin concessions in order to carry out the required

consultations and other activities required for its EIS?

It will be recalled from the Tribunal’s factual findings in Part 4 above that the risk
from anti-miners in the Junin area was both real, long standing and well-known even
before the Claimant’s Junin concessions; and that the State’s presence in the Junin
area, including its police, was invariably weak, intermittent and ineffective. Yet, the
Tribunal decides that there was a breach by the Respondent of the FET and FPS
standards by September 2007. At that point, rather than giving legal force to the factual
effect of the anti-miners’ physical blockade of the Junin concessions, the Respondent
should have attempted something to assist the Claimant in completing its consultations
and other requirements for the EIS. It is of course difficult to say now what it should
have done to resolve all the Claimant’ difficulties and, still more so, whether what

anything it could have done would have changed the Claimant’s position for the better.

Plainly, the Government in Quito could hardly have declared war on its own people.

Yet, in the Tribunal’s view, it could not do nothing.

In any event, what it could not do under the Treaty, so the Tribunal decides, was to
make the situation even worse, by making it legally impossible, under threat of
criminal penalties, for the Claimant to complete its EIS as the concessionaire. Yet that
is what the Respondent did on 25 September 2007 with the resolution by the Pichincha
Regional Mining Director. In the Tribunal’s view, in the circumstances, the
Respondent’s conduct was arbitrary, in the sense that it was unreasonable and
disproportionate at that time to side so completely with the anti-miners as to make it
impossible, both legally and physically, for the Claimant to complete its EIS, with

inevitable consequences.

Accordingly, as explained above, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent’s unlawful
conduct under the FET and FPS standards, from September 2007 to November 2008,
materially contributed to the characterization of the Termination Resolutions of
13 November 2008 as an unlawful expropriation and a further breach of the

FET standard.

Causation: The Tribunal next addresses all issues however broadly related to causation
under this single heading, although the Parties have addressed them under several
different headings, including causation itself, contributory fault and unclean hands,

materially affecting issues of both causation and compensation.

As to causation, the Tribunal bears primarily in mind Article 31 of the ILC’s Articles

on State Responsibility for Internationally Wrongful Acts. It provides, as to reparation:

“[31.1] The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation

caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.

[31.2] Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the

internationally wrongful act of a State.”

As to the Claimant’s injury allegedly caused by the Respondent’s unlawful
expropriation, within the meaning of Article 31 and also Article VIII(1) of the Treaty,
the issue arises as to what loss was caused by the Respondent’s unlawful expropriation

to the “genuine value” of the Claimant’s investments immediately before the

PART 6 — Page 27 of 39

6.89.

6.90.

6.91.

Termination Resolutions of 13 November 2008. The Claimant must discharge the
burden of proving that its injury was caused solely by the Respondent’s wrong. The
Respondent must discharge the burden of proving that the Claimant materially

contributed to its injury.

It should be recalled that the Junin concessions remained immediately before
13 November 2008 in their early stages: there was no active mine or ongoing mining
business by the Claimant. By November 2008, the global economic crisis had already
begun, with a severely depressing effect on the value of the concessions and, indirectly,
the Claimant’s investments. The Tribunal here takes full account of the effect of the
Respondent’s earlier breaches of the FET and FPS standards in Article II (2)(a) & (b)
of the Treaty: these predated the beginning of the full blown global crisis; but those
treaty breaches did not amount to an expropriation. Nonetheless, it is appropriate to

take those breaches by the Respondent into account, beginning at September 2007.

By September 2007, with the events of mid-2006 to late-2006, the Tribunal decides
that, even if the EIS had later been successfully completed and accepted by the
Ministry, the prospects of the Junin concessions being successfully developed by the
Claimant were uncertain or even unlikely (albeit not impossible). These events of 2006
therefore assume a crucial importance for the issues of causation arising from
“contributory fault” or “unclean hands”. Given its decision above (in Part 5) to the
effect that the concessions were not unlawfully or improperly acquired, it is not here

relevant to consider the Claimant’s conduct before 2006, as alleged by the Respondent.

Contributory Fault: As to “contributory fault”, the Tribunal refers to Article 39 of the
ILC Articles on State Responsibility, entitled “Contribution to the Injury” as being
declaratory of international law. It provides: “In the determination of reparation,
account shall be taken of the contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or
omission of the injured State or any person or entity in relation to whom reparation is
sought.” In the ILC Commentary (paragraph 1), Article 39 is described as dealing
“with the situation where damage has been caused by an intentionally wrongful act of
a State, which is accordingly responsible for the damage in accordance with Articles
1 and 28, but where ... the individual victim of the breach has materially contributed

to the damage by some willful or negligent act or omission. Its focus is on situations

PART 6 — Page 28 of 39

6.92.

6.93.

which in national law systems are referred to as ‘contributory negligence’,

‘comparative fault’, ‘faute de la victime’ etc.”

The ILC Commentary also explains what is meant by wilful or negligent action or
omission (paragraph 5): “Not every action or omission which contributes to the
damage suffered is relevant for this purpose. Rather article 39 allows to be taken into
account only those actions or omissions which can be considered as wilful or negligent,
i.e., which manifests a lack of due care on the part of the victim of the breach for his
or her own property or rights [footnote omitted]. While the notion of a negligent action
or omission is not qualified, e.g., by a requirement that the negligence should have
reached the level of being ‘serious’ or ‘gross’, the relevance of any negligence to
reparation will depend upon the degree to which is has contributed to the damage as
well as the other circumstances of the case. The phrase ‘account shall be taken’
indicates that the article deals with factors that are capable of affecting the form or
reducing the amount of reparation in an appropriate case.” The ILC Commentary cites

(inter alia) the decisions in LaGrand, Delagoa Bay Railway and The Wimbledon.'°

Unclean Hands: As to the Respondent’s remaining case on “unclean hands”, the
Tribunal refers to the ECT tribunal’s three awards in the Yukos cases of 18 July 2014.
These awards add nothing new to the state of international law; and the Tribunal cites
them only as a useful illustration of existing legal principles. The Yukos tribunal there
concluded (in similar terms for each award): “In the view of the Tribunal, Claimants
should pay a price for their abuse ... which contributed in a material way to the
prejudice which they subsequently suffered at the hands of the Russian Federation.”!>
The Yukos tribunal cited Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility, MTD

v Chile and Occidental v Ecuador (as did the Respondent in this case).!°*

The Yukos tribunal also stated:

“[1636]. The Tribunal agrees with the ICSID Annulment Committee in the MTD
v. Chile case that ‘the role of the two parties contributing to the loss [is] [...]
only with difficulty commensurable and the Tribunal [has] a corresponding
margin of estimation’ [footnote omitted]. However, the Tribunal, as other
tribunals have done, must reach a decision and it has done so on the basis of all

the evidence which it has reviewed.”

The Yukos tribunal then decided that the claimants had contributed to the extent of 25
percent to the prejudice which they had suffered as a result of the respondent State’s

destruction of their investments.

The Tribunal notes that the committee and tribunal in MTD v Chile and Occidental v
Ecuador, respectively, also applied Article 39 of the ILC Articles on State
Responsibility. !°° In Occidental, the tribunal cited part of a doctoral thesis by

Professor Brigitte Stern, pre-dating the ILC Articles, as follows: !°°

“[674] Both parties, in support of their respective positions, have quoted
extensively to extracts of the 1974 seminal thesis of Professor Brigitte Stern, a
member of this Tribunal, entitled ‘Le préjudice dans la théorie de la
responsabilité internationale.’ The Tribunal agrees that Professor Stern’s thesis,
particularly Chapter II entitled ‘Application nuancé des régles normales de la

causalité,’ is very instructive to and informs its decision on this issue.

[675] In a section of this chapter of her thesis entitled ‘Acte de la victime
justifiant partiellement I’acte de I’Etat,’ Professor Stern refers to the cases of
Delagoa Bay Railway and Lillie Kling v. Mexico,'’ as authorities for the
following proposition: ‘Il y a enfin un certain nombre de circonstances dans
lesquelles l’acte de la victime ne justifie que partiellement I’acte de I’Etat et ot
il faut donc considérer qu’ aussi bien l’un que l’autre sont intervenus de fagon

complémentaire dans la production du dommage’ [Translation: Finally, there are

a certain number of circumstances in which the act of the victim only partially
justifies the State action, and in which as a result it must be concluded that both
the former and the latter operated in a complementary fashion to produce the

damage.]

[676]. The words of the Tribunal in Delagoa Bay Railway are particularly
pertinent to the present case: ‘Toutes ces circonstances qui peuvent étre
alléguées 4 la charge de la compagnie concessionnaire et 4 la décharge du
gouvernement portugais atténuent la responsabilité de ce dernier et justifient
[...] une réduction de la réparation a allouer’ [Translation: All these
circumstances that can be put forward against the concessionaire and to the
credit of the Portuguese government lessen the responsibility of the latter and

justify [...] a reduction in the damages to be granted] (Emphasis added by

tribunal).

[677]. In Lillie Kling, the presiding commissioner opined that ‘it is impossible
not to consider that the action of the [Mexican] soldiers [the shooting and killing
of an American] was caused by the shots fired in the air [...] in a very imprudent
manner’ by some of the victim’s companions. This “imprudence” was thus taken

into consideration by the Commission to reduce the amount of the indemnity.

[678] The Tribunal agrees that an award of damages may be reduced if the
claiming party also committed a fault which contributed to the prejudice it
suffered and for which the trier of facts, in the exercise of its discretion,

considers the claiming party should bear some responsibility.”

The Tribunal notes that, in MTD v Chile, the reduction was 50% of the damages; and

in Occidental, 25% of the claimants’ prejudice.

As was cited by the Yukos tribunal, the MTD committee held that the role of the two
parties contributing to the loss was only with difficulty commensurable; and that the
tribunal had “a corresponding margin of estimation” (paragraph 101). The Occidental
tribunal decided likewise that it had “a wide margin of discretion in apportioning
fault.” (paragraph 670). The Tribunal does not discount the difficulty in estimating a

contribution by way of percentage contribution; but it prefers to interpret these

references to “margin” and “discretion” as requiring the same exercise for any issue of

causation. In the present case, that issue is essentially factual.

For present purposes, the Tribunal considers that the general approach taken in all
these decisions, whether treated as causation, contributory fault (based on wilful or
negligent act or omission) or unclean hands, is materially the same, deriving from a
consistent line of international legal materials. The Tribunal decides to apply that
general approach in this case. As further explained below, it decides that the
Claimant’s injury was caused both by the Respondent’s unlawful expropriation and
also by the Claimant’s own contributory negligent acts and omissions and unclean
hands. Given that the Tribunal draws no distinction between these different concepts

for this case, it prefers to refer only to Article 39 of the ILC Articles.

In the Tribunal’s view, Article 39 requires a factual assessment as regards the
Claimant’s conduct from mid-2006 to late-2006. Given all the events leading up to
November 2008, the issue is whether and, if so, to what extent, the Claimant’s
worsening situation as the concessionaire in the Junin area was caused (in whole or in
part) by its own acts or omissions. Much of the detailed factual evidence has already
been described in Part 4 above; and what follows should be read with those findings

of fact.

By December 2006, by the acts of its agents in Ecuador, the Claimant had substantially
reduced its chances of turning its Junin concessions into a commercial success. In
short, a foreign investor, by its local agents, whatever the illegal provocations by local
residents in the form of road-blocks, violence, arson and other impediments, should
not resort to recruiting and using armed men, firing guns and spraying mace at
civilians, not as an accidental or isolated incident but as part of premeditated, disguised
and well-funded plans to take the law into its own hands. Yet, this is what happened.
The Claimant’s decisions to do so from mid-July to December 2006 remain both
unexplained and inexplicable to the Tribunal, save as a sustained act of folly. It was

bound to fail and to make the situation far worse for the Claimant; and it did.

In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence establishes that several of the Claimant’s senior
personnel in Quito were guilty of directing violent acts committed on its behalf, in
violation of Ecuadorian criminal law. Their resort to subterfuge and mendacity

aggravated those acts. The consequences could have led to serious injury and loss of

life. The adverse response from members of the local communities, already hostile,
was inevitable. That is not to say that the Claimant’s senior management in Canada
was fully privy to the planning and execution of these acts. On the evidence, the
Tribunal prefers to base its decision on the Claimant’s negligence, rather than the
wilful conduct of its Canadian senior management. If it were based on the latter’s own
wilful conduct as the Claimant’s alter ego, the result, as regards Article 39, would be

much graver for the Claimant’s case.

By 13 November 2008, almost a year later than these critical events, the Claimant’s
situation had not improved in the Junin area. Indeed, the Claimant had by then acquired
a pariah-like status in the local community and in Quito — hence, doubtless, its change

of corporate name in July 2008, to no avail.

Taking all these factors into account, including the provocations by certain anti-
miners, the Tribunal assesses the Claimant’s contribution to its own injury as at
November 2008, for the purpose of applying Article 39 of the ILC Articles, at 30 per

cent. On the facts of this case, it could not be less.

L: The Chaucha Concession

6.103.

6.104.

6.105.

The Claimant: The Claimant’s claim in regard to the Chaucha concession is based
upon an alleged indirect expropriation by the Respondent in violation of Article
VIII(1) of the Treaty; namely that the concession was “subject to measures having an
effect equivalent to ... expropriation.” The claim is also advanced as a breach of the
FET standard in Article II(2) of the Treaty. The Claimant relies, in particular upon the

following principal matters.

On 31 January 2008, the Under-Secretary of the MEM publicly declared that both the
Junin and Chaucha concessions would be covered by a new mining law providing for
the reversion of properties to the State, without compensation. This declaration was to
impede the Respondent from disposing of its interest in the Chaucha concession for

over a year.

On 12 November 2008, the Respondent unlawfully expropriated the Junin

concessions, with the Termination Resolutions.

On 29 January 2009, the Respondent enacted Article 24 of the 2009 Mining Law.

Article 1 provided for the return to the State of certain defined concessions.

On 30 March 2009, an agreement was made between the Claimant and Nortec for
(inter alia) Nortec’s indirect acquisition of the Chaucha concession. It was, according

to the Claimant, a forced sale, later repudiated, which eventually came to nothing. !°8

On 30 April 2009, the MEM issued a Ministerial Order identifying the concessions

that would revert to the State under Article 24 of the Mining Law.

On 30 May 2009, the MEM confirmed that the Chaucha concession would revert to

the State under Article 24 of the Mining Law.

By letters dated 18 and 23 June 2009, Nortec informed the Claimant that it had
obtained a copy of the MEM’s official memorandum designating the Chaucha
concession for reversion under Article 24 of the Mining Law. Nortec also provided
Copper Mesa with a legal opinion from an ex-Minister of Mines confirming that this
was the official policy of the Respondent.'” The Claimant’s own counsel could not
provide a legal opinion confirming the Claimant’s indirect title (via DosRios) in the

Chaucha concession.

On 23 July 2009, the MEM issued a ministerial order declaring that formal resolutions
extinguishing title in affected concessions would be issued following a final review by
the MEM Under-Secretary and that no compensation would be paid to

concessionaires.!!°

On 10 September 2009, the Chaucha concession was again listed by the Respondent
as amongst the strategic mining projects that would be nationalised by the

Respondent.!!!

According to the Claimant, the result of this chronology substantially deprived its
interest in the Chaucha concession of any material value, hence amounting to an
indirect expropriation in breach of the Treaty and a violation of the Treaty’s FET

standard. The Claimant also contends that the Claimant (with its subsidiary, DosRios)

had no realistic or effective prospect, by legal or administrative proceedings within
Ecuador, to lift the cloud-on-title so adversely affecting the Chaucha concession. If it

had existed, the Claimant would have used it.

The Respondent: The Respondent denies any liability in respect the Claimant’s claim.

In brief, it relies in particular upon the following principal matters.

There never was any cloud-on-title in regard to the Chaucha concession. The
newspaper reports and other materials on which the Claimant relies do not
demonstrate, according to the Respondent, that the Respondent intended to expropriate
the Chaucha concession. Specifically, the MEM’s draft internal memorandum was
clearly a draft, as can be seen from the comparison with the final document. It cannot
have been obtained legitimately by Nortec. Accordingly, the Claimant cannot here rely
up on it, as unlawfully obtained material. As for the ministerial order of 23 July 2009,
it was overturned on 27 August 2009 and substituted by another ministerial order on
the same date. That order provided for an internal deadline of 180 days to prepare and
review a report on the mining areas in which there had been investigation by the State,

including the Chaucha concession.

The Claimant never sought any clarification from the Respondent as to whether it had
in fact taken a decision to revert the Chaucha concession. The Claimant could have
requested a meeting with MEM for clarification; or it could easily have written to the

MEM; but it did neither.

As from 8 January 2010, any “cloud” would have disappeared. DosRios (as the
Claimant’s subsidiary and concessionaire) then received a written request from the
MEM to renew the Chaucha concession pursuant to the 2009 Mining Law. This request
showed that the Respondent had not taken any decision to revert the Chaucha
concession. Further, the renewal of the Chaucha concession on 23 April 2010 further

confirmed that there was no cloud-on-title.

The Claimant’s Response: As regards the newspaper reports, the Claimant submits that
these referred, both prior to and after the passage of Article 24 of the 2009 Mining
Law, to the Chaucha concession as one of the targets for reversion. As for the MEM
internal memorandum provided by Nortec, it was neither a draft nor confidential.

According to the Claimant, its existence was mentioned in a public ministerial order;

PART 6 — Page 35 of 39

6.119.

6.120.

6.121.

6.122.

it was signed; and there is no evidence that it was not voluntarily disclosed by the
Respondent to Nortec during the course of the ordinary due diligence that any

purchaser (such as Nortec) would undertake in the circumstances.

As regards the Ministerial Order of 23 July 2009, it provides a complete answer to the
Respondent’s case that a meeting with or a letter to MEM would have clarified any
cloud-on-title. It declared the Respondent’s official policy of the State; and MEM
could not have contradicted that policy in any correspondence or meetings with the
Claimant. The subsequent Ministerial Order 84 did not reverse that policy, but merely
extended the deadline for implementing it by 180 days. It therefore simply continued
the cloud-on-title that prevented any disposal by sale of the Claimant’s interest in the

Chaucha concession.

By January 2010, when Biotreat controlled the Chaucha concession (de facto) and was
offered a substitute concession by the Respondent (albeit without any guarantee that
this new concession itself would not be subject to Article 24), the cloud-on-title to the

Chaucha concession had persisted for more than two years.

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision: The Tribunal notes that the Claimant pleads its
case primarily as an alleged substantial deprivation of its interest in the Chaucha
concession, amounting to an indirect expropriation. Its allegations of a cloud-on-title,
affecting the disposal of its interest by sale, are advanced as factual manifestations of
such deprivation, being more form than substance. The Tribunal prefers, as explained

below, to address the issue of substantial deprivation.

There is no question that indirect expropriation is covered by Article VIII(1) of the
Treaty and international law. Unlawful expropriation is not limited to direct
expropriation, confined to the overt taking of physical property or the formal transfer
of title to movable or immovable property. As many tribunals have decided on similar
wording, measures other than an actual taking or a formal transfer may amount to
“measures having an effect equivalent to ... expropriation”, in the words of Article

VIII(1) of the Treaty.!'? However, it is clear that indirect expropriation requires a

6.126.

 

substantial deprivation of the economic use and benefit of the investment, including

its disposal.!!

In the Tribunal’s view, by July 2009, there was a substantial deprivation amounting to
an indirect expropriation in breach of Article VIII(1) of the Treaty by July 2009. The
Tribunal notes that the MEM’s Under-Secretary’s announcement on 31 January 2008
of the pending reversion of the Chaucha concession immediately followed the
Nullification Resolutions of 25 January 2008 in regard to the Junin concessions.
Although these Nullification Resolutions made no reference to the Chaucha
concession, the policy behind these resolutions (pre-dating the Mining Mandate and
the Mining Law’s Article 24) could equally have been applied to the Chaucha

concession. The same applies to the Termination Resolutions of 12 November 2008.

It is impossible to ignore the fact that the Claimant was the interested party for these
concessions; and that, by November 2008, it had long acquired in Quito a pariah-like
status, as recorded elsewhere. It could not, by then, have reasonably been expected that
the Chaucha concession could long escape the fate of the Junin concessions. It was

only a question of time.

With the enactment of Article 24 of the Mining Law on 29 January 2009, the result
was inevitable and imminent. In all but form, it came by July 2009. By then, the
Claimant’s subsidiary was the concessionaire of the Chaucha concession in name only.
The Claimant could not use, enjoy or dispose of the economic benefit if its interest in
the Chaucha concession, as was confirmed by its failed sale to Nortec in June 2009.
The fact that a different beneficial owner (other than the Claimant) was requested by
the Respondent in 2010 to renew and did renew the Chaucha concession proves
nothing, other than the fact the Respondent viewed that third party (Biotreat) very

differently from the Claimant.

The Tribunal does not identify the Claimant as a wrongdoer in receiving and acting
upon the information procured by Nortec for its own purposes, namely the exercise of

due diligence before closing a significant closing transaction. Moreover, the Tribunal

ple, see Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador, ICSID Case No ARB/08/5, 14 December

2012, Decision on Liability (RLA-160) [“Burlington v Ecuador” paras 471-473.

PART 6 — Page 37 of 39

does not accept as proven that Nortec itself committed any legal wrong in procuring

the list or draft list of affected concessions originating within the MEM.

6.127. Further, the Tribunal does not accept that the Claimant (or DosRios) had any effective
remedy, legal or administrative, to mitigate or extinguish the effect of the
Respondent’s conduct towards the Chaucha concession. Any formal or informal
inquiry to MEM could not have resulted in any satisfactory solution for the Claimant

by July 2009 or, indeed, at any later time.

6.128. In the circumstances, the Tribunal thinks it unnecessary to address the Claimant’s
further claim under the FET standard in Article II(2) of the Treaty. That claim can add
nothing to its claim for indirect expropriation under Article VIII(1) of the Treaty. The
Tribunal notes that the Claimant did receive from Biotreat all or part of US$50,000 for
its interest in the Chaucha concession in October 2009 under a forced sale, which sum

will be taken into account in regard to quantum below.
M: The Telimbela Concession

6.129. The Claimant never held any interest in a concession over Telimbela: the concession
was held by Ecuadorgold as the concessionaire, with the Claimant having only an
option to acquire the concession for the Telimbela concession. This claim was not
pressed by the Claimant at the Hearing or in its subsequent post-hearing submissions.
In the circumstances, although the Tribunal does not treat it as having been abandoned,

the Tribunal considers that it can decide this claim summarily, as follows.

6.130. In short, there is no cogent evidence that any measure taken by the Respondent caused
the Claimant (by itself or others) to allow the lapse of the option to acquire the
Telimbela concession. Although inconclusive, the evidence suggests that the decision
to allow the option to lapse was caused by the lack of sufficient funds to do otherwise,

both by the Claimant and Biotreat.
6.131. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses this claim.
N: Summary

6.132. As regards liability, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides that the

Respondent is liable under the Treaty for the Claimant’s claim regarding the Junin and

PART 6 — Page 38 of 39

6.133.

6.134.

Chaucha concessions. It dismisses the Claimant’s claim regarding the Telimbela

concession.

As regards causation, for the reasons also set out above, owing to the Claimant’s
contributory negligence under international law, the Tribunal assesses the Claimant’s
contribution to its own injury at 30 per cent regarding the Junin concessions. It makes
no such assessment regarding the Chaucha concession (where the Respondent makes

no equivalent allegation).

Accordingly, the Tribunal has here decided, in substance, the principal issues listed in

Part 2 above, under Paragraphs 2.11 to 2.43.

It is likewise necessary to summarise the Parties’ respective submissions on

compensation before setting out the Tribunal’s analyses and decisions.

The Claimant: In brief, the Claimant submits that the Respondent, having violated its
obligations under the Treaty in regard to the Junin and Chaucha concessions, must
make full reparation to re-establish the situation existing before the violations took
place or the situation that would have existed had the violations not occurred.! The
Claimant contends that the reparation should take the form of monetary compensation
sufficient to wipe out the consequences of the Respondents illegal acts.” According
to the Claimant, the compensation should amount to the difference in the value of the
Claimant’s investments had the measures complained of not taken place, and the lesser

value of these investments in light of those measures.*

The Claimant submits that, under customary international law, compensation
reflecting the capital value of property taken or destroyed is generally assessed on the
basis of “fair market value of the property lost”. The Claimant presents three
approaches to calculate that fair market value in this case: (i) income-based, (ii)
market-based and (iii) cost-based.* The Claimant adduces the expert report of FTI
Consulting Inc. in support of the compensation it seeks.> The Claimant cites the
CIMVAL Guidelines to note that income-based approaches are not suitable for

properties at an exploration stage, as in this case.°

As its primary case on quantum, the Claimant presents a market-based quantification
of damages with the high figure at US$72.8 million and the low figure at US$44.8

million. The Claimant claims the mid-point of the range, of US$69.7 million, together

with interest from the appropriate valuation date. The Claimant selects the date of 24
January 2008 as the appropriate valuation date, as it is the date immediately before the
Nullification Resolutions in respect of the Junin concessions.’ The same date is
proposed for use with respect to the Chaucha concession considering that the
Nullification and Termination Resolutions would have also depressed the value of the
Claimant’s investments in general, despite being directed only at the Junin

concessions.*

As to quantification, the Claimant adopts the weighted average of three different
market approaches to determine the fair market value of the Claimant’s concessions:
40% to the market transactions involving mineral assets that are similar to the
Claimant’s concessions; 40% to the Claimant’s share price in the thirty days prior to
the valuation date; and 20% to the public offering of the Claimant’s shares that

occurred six months prior to the valuation date.

In the alternative, the Claimant presents the cost-based approach of quantification
amounting to US$ 26.5 million in costs incurred by the Claimant related to the Junin,
Chaucha and Telimbela concessions, as confirmed by its audited financial statements.
This is a subsidiary alternative, only advanced if the Tribunal rejects its primary case
on quantum. The Claimant contends that this is not the appropriate measure of

damages, as it does not reflect future cash flows or expected investment returns. !°

The Respondent: The Respondent disagrees with the Claimant’s quantification
methodologies in that its selected valuation date is not only unjustified, but also
misguided and misleading. Moreover, so the Respondent contends, the weightings
attached to each valuation method are not justifiable and arbitrary.'' In support of its

case, the Respondent adduces the expert testimony on quantum of The Brattle Group.

The Respondent claims that the valuation date of 24 January 2008 selected by the
Claimant is unsupported by the facts and the Claimant’s own legal case. '? The

Respondent contends that, under international law, the appropriate valuation date in

case of direct expropriation is the date immediately before the expropriation date, or
the date on which the decision to expropriate became publicly known, if earlier.!? In
the case of an indirect expropriation, the valuation date should be the date when the

acts or omissions in question have ripened into an irreversible taking of the asset.'*

Therefore, according to the Respondent, the valuation date for the Junin concessions
should be 12 November 2008, the date of their termination under the Termination
Resolutions.'> As to the Chaucha concession, it was alleged by the Claimant to have
been expropriated as a result of a series of events that culminated on 23 June 2009,
when Nortec became aware of the draft memorandum of the National Geological
Survey. Accordingly, so the Respondent contends, this date should be selected as the
valuation date for the Chaucha concession.'© The Respondent contends that the earlier
valuation date selected by the Claimant, falling before the 2008 global financial crisis,
grossly overstates its loss;'’ and the Claimant thereby seeks compensation for the

decline in asset values caused by that crisis, not caused by the Respondent at all.'®

Further Submissions: The Claimant contends that the Respondent gave specific
instructions to its expert witness on quantum regarding the valuation dates it
considered to be applicable, while the Claimant allowed its expert witness to come to
his own conclusions. Hence, according to the Claimant, the evidence from the

Respondent’s quantum expert can have little or no value.

The Claimant’s expert, FTI, concluded that the proper valuation date was 25 January
2008, as the date on which the Junin concessions were nullified under the Nullification
Resolutions, taking into account the language of the Treaty, Article VIII(1), that:
“Tc]ompensation shall be based on the genuine value of the investment or returns
expropriated immediately before the expropriation or at the time the proposed
expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier”.!° The Claimant

indicates that the Nullification Resolutions constituted the actions whereby the

proposed expropriation became public knowledge, and therefore the valuation date it

used is appropriate.”°

The Respondent disagrees. It contends that the determination of the valuation date is a
matter of treaty interpretation, international law and fact; and that, therefore, a
valuation expert lacks competence to decide these matters.”! The Respondent contends
that the valuation date selected by the Claimant is inconsistent with its legal case that
the expropriation of the Junin concessions took place with the Termination
Resolutions, and not with the Nullification Resolutions. The Respondent contends that
the Claimant seems to be arguing a case of “creeping expropriation” when selecting
the valuation date, rather than the case of “direct expropriation”, as it alleges with
respect to its pleaded claim of expropriation. The Respondent contends that in cases
of creeping expropriation, as a composite act, the valuation date would be the date

when the steps taken resulted in an irreversible taking.

As regards the Junin concessions, the Respondent submits that such a date would be
the date of the Termination Resolutions because the Nullification Resolutions had only
a temporary effect and were subsequently annulled.? As regards the Chaucha
concession, the Respondent submits that there is no basis to use the date of the
Nullification Resolutions as their valuation date at all: the relevant date is the date
when the expropriation becomes irreversible, not the date when the first instance of
the Respondent’s alleged wrongdoing occurs. Therefore, so the Respondent submits,
the proper date for their valuation is 23 June 2009, when Nortec became aware of the
internal draft memorandum of the National Geological Survey identifying Chaucha as
among the areas on which the Respondent had carried out investigation, prospecting,

exploration and/or exploitation.”

The Respondent, based on the expert report of The Brattle Group, contends that it is
unnecessary and inappropriate to refer to market transactions involving mineral assets
that are allegedly comparable to the Claimant’s concessions and to allocate a weight

of 40% to this method. The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s own share value

should have been used instead. The Respondent alleges that the comparability of
projects depends on their economics and not only upon their geological character;
similar geological characteristics often have significantly different economics due to
various factors. 4 Therefore, zero weight should be attached to comparable
transactions.”> According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s quantum experts have
also erred with respect to cut-off selection, time adjustments and purchase price

allocations.”°

The Respondent contends that the use of traded share data, when available (which it is
here), should be the primary and generally the only basis for valuing the assets of a
company.”’ However, the Respondent alleges that the Claimant allocates a low weight
to it and uses arbitrary dates in its stock price analysis, therefore substantially
overstating the value of its claim.?* The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s
chosen dates for valuing its stock prices are illogical.” The Respondent also disagrees
with the use of a premium for an acquirer purchasing the totality of the shares,
considering that although it may arise in the context of specific transactions where the
acquirer is paying for unique value being transferred from the seller, they are not an
inherent part of the fair market value of the asset. The Respondent concludes that the

Claimant cannot be worth more than its traded market value.*”

The Claimant in turn rejects the Respondent’s arguments. The Claimant contends that
sound valuation methodology recognises that no one approach to valuation is
necessarily accurate. Therefore, it is widely accepted that valuers should use multiple
methods, examine the results and either choose a single method as being the most
reliable or ascribe different weights to the outcomes of each methodology, depending
on the factual circumstances of the case.*! The Claimant also contends that the use of
comparable properties is the primary and preferred valuation method; and that its

quantum expert witnesses used this method according to best industry standards.*?

The Claimant contends that FTI took into account market capitalisation as a factor.
However, it concluded that the Claimant’s share price did not reflect fair market value;
and it therefore gave that method less weight when determining fair market value. Its
reasons included the fact that the Respondent had taken numerous steps before the
valuation date which could be expected to depress the value of the Claimant’s shares,
information imbalances that would not have reflected the Claimant’s fair market value
in its share price in the stock exchange, and the exclusion of a control premium in the
traded price.** The Claimant further contends that should the Tribunal take into
account the Claimant’s share price alone to determine value, it should do so at a more
current date and not at the Respondent’s valuation date at the bottom of the stock
market decline of 2008, when more recently as in October 2012, comparable

companies have recovered almost all of the share value they had lost.**

The Respondent disagrees that a mix of valuation methods is required, and insists that
the market capitalisation is the appropriate valuation method, also disagreeing with the
Claimant's reasons for criticizing this method.*° As to the alternative date proposed by
the Claimant for valuation using the market capitalisation, the Respondent contends
that it is also inappropriate considering that, even more recently, in July 2013, the value
of the same comparable companies had fallen substantially below the levels of the

valuation date of 24 January 2008 initially proposed by the Claimant.*°

The Respondent also contends that the proper approach in accordance with standard
valuation practice would have been to compare the fair market value of the Claimant’s
investments before and after the dates of their alleged taking.*” According to the
Respondent, an event study analysis shows a value of US$ 2.5 million as of
12 November 2008 for the Junin concessions.** As for the Chaucha (and Telimbela)
concessions, the Respondent contends that the best evidence comes from the Nortec
offer, and therefore, the value of US$ 5 million as at 23 June 2009 reflects the

market evidence.*?

The Claimant objects to the determination of value using event studies arguing, inter
alia, that share prices do not reflect fair market value and therefore an event study is
inappropriate, and that event studies require an efficient trading market that is not the
case when stocks are not liquid as in the case of the Claimant’s shares.*° The
Respondent disagrees. According to the Respondent, it is the standard method to
account for the effects of multiple events causing change in firm value, and the level

of market efficiency in this case is sufficient for an event study.*!

As to the cost-based method of valuation, the Respondent rejects its application stating
that this method ignores sharp declines in value suffered as a result of the global
financial crisis.4* The Respondent claims that a detailed accounting of the costs being
allocated by the Claimant would be needed in order to understand the damage amount
claimed by the Claimant using this valuation method.** The Claimant submits that this
approach was presented as an alternative method against to which to compare other

methods, and is one of the generally accepted approaches to valuation.*

B: The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

7.22.

7.23.

Legal Burden of Proof: The Tribunal starts with the general principle under
international law that it is for the Claimant to prove the extent of its injury within the
meaning of Articles VIII(1) of the Treaty as regards the expropriation of its Junin and
Chaucha concessions. Given the Tribunal’ decision dismissing, as to liability, the
Claimant’s claim regarding the Telimbela concession, it can be disregarded for present

purposes.

Valuation Date: As regards the dates of direct and indirect expropriation under Article
VIII(1) of the Treaty, the Tribunal decides upon: (i) 3 November 2008 for the Junin
concessions and (ii) 30 June 2009 for the Chaucha concession. However, as will appear
below, these different dates are not directly material to the Tribunal’s decisions on

compensation.

The Parties’ Quantum Experts: Save for one method, the Tribunal decides not to
accept the several valuation methodologies advanced by the Parties’ respective expert
witnesses. In the Tribunal’s view, applied in this case, those methodologies are too
uncertain, subjective and dependent upon contingencies, which cannot fairly be
assessed by the Tribunal. For example, wholly extraneous factors significantly affect
the different figures resulting from the Parties’ different methodologies. These huge
differences, with insufficient explanations, suggest that extreme caution is required in
assessing compensation in this case. This is hardly surprising, given that the
Claimant’s concessions remained in an early exploratory stage with no actual mining
activities, still less any track record as an actual mining business; and, particularly as
regards the Junin concessions, that the Claimant’s chances of moving beyond an

exploratory stage were, by December 2006, slender.

The Tribunal has therefore experienced difficulties in assessing compensation in this
case. These difficulties cannot, however, preclude the Tribunal from making such an

assessment on the relevant evidence adduced in this arbitration.

The Tribunal has no doubt that the Claimant has itself suffered some legal harm. That
much is certain. What is uncertain is the proven extent of that legal harm, quantified
as compensation payable by the Respondent. As the tribunal held in its award in
Vivendi v. Argentina, faced with similar difficulties on the issue of quantifying loss:
“Nevertheless, there is useful evidence on the record; and it is well settled that the fact
that damages cannot be fixed with certainty is no reason not to award damages when
a loss has been incurred. In such cases, approximations are inevitable; the settling of
damages is not an exact science.”** Other arbitral decisions confirm this pragmatic
approach, precluding a claim’s dismissal for want of certainty or difficulty in its
assessment.*° For this reason, rather than seeking to value an elusive loss of a chance
to the extent permissible under international law, the Tribunal here prefers to select the
Claimant’s alternative valuation method of proven expenditure. As may now also be

understood, the date of valuation is not material to this approach on compensation.

Expenditure: In the Tribunal’s view, the most reliable, objective and fair method in
this case for valuing the Claimant’s investments in November 2008 and June 2009 is
to take the Claimant’s proven expenditure incurred in relation to its Junin and Chaucha

concessions.

As stated in its audited consolidated financial statements as adjusted downwards by
FTI in the form of its Revised Schedule 10, this figure is US$ 25,764,500.47 From this
figure, it is necessary to deduct US$ 1,473,607 in respect of the Telimbela concession.
It is also necessary to separate out the expenditure for the Junin concessions and the
Chaucha concession: these are respectively US$ 15,977,994 and US$ 8,312,899. The
Tribunal finds that such expenditure on the Claimant’s activities and its lawful “social
programs” was not unreasonable, as regards both the Junin concessions and the
Chaucha concession.** Moreover, at the relevant time, it was all being spent by the
Claimant from its own pocket, with no recoverable claim against the Respondent in

mind.

That expenditure in regard to the Junin concessions and the Chaucha concession now
lies wasted and is therefore totally lost for the Claimant. For present purposes, the
Tribunal makes no distinction between direct and indirect expropriation as regards the
Claimant’s concessions. In selecting this approach, the Tribunal intends to restore the
Claimant to the status quo ante, where it would have never been an investor in the
Junin and Chaucha concessions. Anything more would be mere speculation. Anything
less could not compensate the Claimant for the loss of its investments under Article
VIII(1) of the Treaty or amount to the reparation required under the general principle

enunciated in the Chorzéw case, as here applied by the Tribunal.”

For the Junin concessions this approach produces the figure of US$ 15,977,994. It is
however subject to the Claimant’s contributory negligence under Article 39 of the ILC
Articles. It therefore falls to be reduced by 30 per cent. Accordingly, that figure
becomes US$ 11,184,595.80 (a reduction of US$ 4,793,398.20). The Tribunal had
considered removing from this figure all costs howsoever connected with the

Claimant’s negligent fault under Article 39 of the ILC Articles; but it decides not to

inception to 30 September 2009, with Notes citing (inter alia) C-219.

do so to avoid subjecting the Claimant to a double penalty. It is confident that this
reduced amount does not include any reimbursement of costs incurred by the Claimant

in regard to its unlawful activities in the Junin area.

For the Chaucha concession, this approach produces a figure of US$ 8,262,899 (being
US$8,312,899 less US$50,000 received from Biotreat).

Conclusion: As decided, the starting-point is the Claimant’s figure, accepted as proven
by the Tribunal for lost expenditure actually incurred for the Junin and Chaucha
concessions. As regards the Junin concessions, the Claimant’s figure falls to be
reduced for the Claimant’s contributory negligence by 30 per cent, producing the final
amount of US$ 11,184,595.80. As regards the Chaucha concession, it produces the
final amount of US$ 8,262,899. The total principal amount of compensation amounts
to US$ 19,447,494.80. Accordingly, the Tribunal has here also decided, in substance
and to the extent relevant, the principal issues listed in Part 2 above, under Paragraphs

2.44 to 2.54.

It is necessary briefly to summarise the Parties’ respective submissions before setting

out the Tribunal’s analyses and decisions.

The Claimant: In brief, as to the interest rate, the Claimant contends that the rate for
six-month US Treasury bills should apply, plus a risk premium of 3% to 5% for
sovereign debt in Ecuador and in emerging markets generally, from the valuation date
onwards.! The Claimant further contends that recent investment treaty ‘jurisprudence’
points to compound interest as suitable for full reparation as the investor forgoes

investment opportunities that would have included compounding effects.”

The Respondent: The Respondent disagrees. In brief, according to the Respondent, the
Claimant is not entitled to claim compound interest, simple interest still being the
prevailing rule in international arbitration and most domestic legal systems. *
Moreover, Ecuadorian law prohibits compound interest as it is against Ecuadorian
public policy.* Since the Claimant’s investments were made in Ecuador, Ecuadorian

law must be considered dispositive of the issue.”

The Respondent further contends that according to Article VIII of the Treaty,
compensation for expropriation “shall be payable from the date of expropriation with
interest at a normal commercial rate”. Therefore, as to the Junin concessions, from 12
November 2008 (being the date of the Termination Resolutions), and as to the Chaucha
concession, from 23 June 2009 (being the date of the alleged indirect expropriation of

these concessions).°

The Respondent also disagrees that the Claimant is entitled to any risk premium. The
Respondent contends that liability is determined at the time of the award and therefore
pre-award interest should be at a risk-free rate.’ Therefore, interest, if any is awarded,
should be awarded on a simple, risk-free rate, as required by the Treaty (“at a normal
commercial rate”) and the prevailing international arbitral practice (e.g. see the ICSID

decision in Arif v. Moldova).®

The Claimant, for its part, submits that domestic law prohibitions on payment of
interest or compound interest are not applicable to claims under investment treaties
that are governed by international law, and that compound interest as opposed to
simple interest is the international law standard in expropriation cases.? The Claimant
refers to the decision in Occidental v. Ecuador where the tribunal reviewed recent
trends in relation to interest in ICSID awards. It concluded that most recent awards
provide for compound interest; and it found that this practice accords with the Chorz6w
principle. That tribunal also distinguished the decision in Duke Energy v. Ecuador (not
an expropriation case) where damages were awarded only under domestic law and not

under international law.'°

In addition, the Claimant contends that the “normal commercial rate” pursuant to the
Treaty is not a risk-free rate. The Claimant, noting that its valuation expert’s initial

report tool “a highly conservative approach to a ‘normal commercial rate’”, suggests
that a more accurate rate would be the Claimant’s debt rate or the T-bill rate plus

Ecuador’s average sovereign debt premium. '!

B: The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

8.8.

The Tribunal begins with the wording of Article VIII(1) of the Treaty and international
law, as the applicable law. It provides, in the case of lawful expropriation,
compensation with interest “at a normal commercial rate” from the relevant date of
expropriation (as there defined). As regards the rate of interest, the French wording

states: “au taux d’intérét en vigueur dans le commerce”; and the Spanish wording

reads: “a la tasa de interés comercial normal”.'? All three languages in the Treaty are

equally authentic.

The Tribunal notes that these wordings appear in a treaty signed almost twenty years
ago, in 1996. At that time, it may be questioned whether these phrases necessarily
included compound, as distinct from simple, rates of interest. However, there is no
doubt that normal commercial rates include compound rates of interest. These

wordings remain, however, equivocal.

It is not necessary for the Tribunal to base its decision on any equivocal interpretation.
This case concerns compensation for unlawful and not lawful expropriations. For an
unlawful expropriation (whether direct or indirect), the Tribunal also applies the
general principle established by the Chorzow case. It provides for full reparation, in

the well-known passage already cited in Part 7 above.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that full reparation in this case is not limited to
simple interest under Article VIII(1) of the Treaty. Applying the Chorzéw principle,
with Article VIII(1), the Tribunal considers it appropriate in this case to award

compound interest and not simple interest.

As to the rate of compound interest, the Tribunal decides upon the rate for 26-weeks
US Treasury bills (as published in the Wall Street Journal, New York edition, available
at: wsj.com), plus three per cent as a normal commercial premium. It rejects the
Claimant’s claim for an additional country risk premium. Such an approach is
inappropriate to an arbitration award made in the Netherlands under the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules, subject to recognition and enforcement under Dutch law and the
UN New York Convention of 1958. The Tribunal decides upon six-monthly rests. As
for the starting date, the Tribunal fixes, as regards the Junin concessions, 3 November
2008 and, as regards the Chaucha concession, 30 June 2009, as the respective dates of
their direct and indirect expropriations, until payment. Accordingly, the Tribunal has
here also decided, in substance and to the extent relevant, the principal issues listed in

Part 2 above, under Paragraph 2.55.

PART 9 - COSTS

A: Introduction

9.1. It is necessary briefly to summarise the Parties’ respective submissions before setting
out the Tribunal’s analyses and decisions regarding legal and arbitration costs claimed
under Articles 40(1) and 40(2) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules forming part of

the Parties’ arbitration agreement derided from Article XIII of the Treaty.

9.2. The Claimant: In brief, the Claimant seeks to have the Respondent bear all the costs
of arbitration. The Claimant refers to the Tribunal’s discretionary power to award costs
under the UNCITRAL Rules, in particular, to Article 40(1) and (2) whereby “in
principle” the cost of arbitration is to be borne by the unsuccessful party and the cost
of legal representation and assistance shall be apportioned “taking into consideration

the circumstances of the case”.'

9.3. The Respondent: In brief, the Respondent, for its part, seeks an award of all its costs
of this arbitration from the Claimant, including attorney’s fees and all other fees and

expenses incurred from its participation in this arbitration, including internal costs.”
B: The Tribunal’s Analyses and Decisions

9.4. Legal Costs: The relevant amounts of legal costs claimed by the Parties respectively

are as follows:

(i) The Claimant: US$ 3,079,264.20 (including US$ 440,000 as “arbitration

costs”)

The Tribunal refers to the Claimant’s letter dated 31 January 2014, with the affidavit

of Ms Nancy Chave.

(ii) The Respondent: US$ 4,503,097.50 and US$ 1,201,082.42 (not including

Arbitration Costs: The relevant amounts of arbitration costs are as follows:

Expenses: US$ 20,239.31

Judge Bruno Simma:
Fees: US$ 218,738.64

Expenses: US$ 5,964.93

Other Tribunal Expenses: US$ 127,295.39

Total for Arbitration Costs: US$ 1,063,515.05

The Parties have each deposited with the PCA US$ 531,757.50 as deposits towards
arbitration costs, totalling US$ 1,063,515.00.The costs of the arbitration disbursed by
the PCA total US$ 1,063,515.05, leaving no unexpended balance on hand with the
PCA. These costs include all those costs detailed in Article 40(2)(a), (b), (c), (d) and
(f) of the UNCITRAL Rules.

In the Tribunal’s view, there is no clearly “successful party” in this arbitration. It is
true that the Claimant has succeeded, as regards jurisdiction, admissibility and liability,
in its subsidiary claim for compensation in regard to two of its three concessions,
including its principal concessions at Junin. On the other hand, the Claimant had
claimed a substantially greater amount in its main claim for all its concessions, which
was not accepted by the Tribunal (as to 70% of such claim). Moreover, the Respondent
largely succeeded on its defence on causation and compensation based on the
Claimant’s contributory fault for its loss in regard to the Junin concessions. Those
issues took up most of the time and effort in this arbitration, both for the Parties and
the Tribunal. Their end-result significantly reduced the total amount of the Claimant’s

claims for compensation against the Respondent.

PART 9 — Page 2 of 3

9.10.

The Tribunal does not attach material weight to either Party’s procedural complaints
against the other. The Claimant complains at the Respondent’s attempt to bifurcate
this proceeding (which the Tribunal rejected). It also complains at the Respondent
making allegations that were later withdrawn or not pursued, such as the ownership of
the Claimant’s project companies and the acquisition or transfer of the concessions. In
turn, the Respondent complains at the Claimant’s deficiencies on document production
(such as a complete and accurate list of its employees in Ecuador) and non-disclosures
regarding the eventual sale of the Claimant’s subsidiaries to Biorea, =!
Hs 20c its initial opposition to the

admission of film footage, including the documentary film “Under Rich Earth”.

In the Tribunal’s view, none of these complaints are decisive factors in regard to the
Tribunal’s discretion to allocate between the Parties legal and arbitration costs. The
overriding factor lies in the factual complexities of the Parties’ dispute: the volume of
evidence was extensive; and much of it was contradictory. In a dispute raising such
controversies between pro-miners and anti-miners, this was always a complicated and
difficult arbitration. Indeed, it is a tribute to the Parties’ Counsel that so many of these
difficulties were overcome. The Tribunal sees no good reason to criticise either Party

or any Counsel for the conduct of its case in this arbitration.

Conclusion: Taking all the circumstances into account, the Tribunal decides that the
fairest decision on legal costs would be to let them lie where they fell: i.e. to make no
order regarding legal costs, thereby rejecting both Parties’ claims for legal costs. As
regards arbitration costs, applying the same approach, the Tribunal decides that the
Parties, as between themselves, shall bear the costs of the arbitration equally.
Accordingly, the Tribunal has here also decided, in substance and to the extent

relevant, the principal issues listed in Part 2 above under Paragraph 2.56.

PART 10 - SUMMARY OF THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISIONS

10.1. The Claimant: As noted above in Part | of this Award, the Claimant requested that the

Tribunal make an award in its favour:

Treaty;

(c) declaring that Ecuador breached its obligations under the Treaty;

(d) ordering Ecuador to pay monetary compensation to Copper Mesa in an
amount of US$69.7 million plus compound interest thereon from April
30, 2013; and

(e) granting Copper Mesa its costs of this arbitration and costs of legal
representation and assistance in an amount to be determined in a final
award”!

10.2. The Respondent: As also noted in Part 1 above, the Respondent requested that the
Tribunal dismiss the Claimant’s claims for lack of jurisdiction, or in the alternative,
dismiss the claims as inadmissible, or in the further alternative, dismiss the claims as
unfounded, and award the costs of this arbitration, including attorney’s fees and all
other fees and expenses incurred in participating in this arbitration, including internal

costs.”

10.3. The Tribunal’s Summary: As set out above in this Award, in summary, the Tribunal

has decided:

10.4. As regard the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, the Tribunal
has decided to reject them and declares that it has jurisdiction to hear and decide on
their factual and legal merits the Parties’ dispute, including the Claimant’s claims,
under Article XIII of the Treaty.. The Tribunal’s reasons are contained in Part 5 of this

Award. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s pleaded claims in paragraphs

(a) and (b) above; and the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s pleaded objections to

jurisdiction and admissibility.

As regards the Claimant’s claims that the Respondent breached its international
obligations under the Treaty, the Tribunal has decided that the Respondent breached
such obligations in regard to the Junin and Chaucha concessions (but not in regard to
the option for the Telimbela concession) under Articles II(2) and VIII(1) of the Treaty.
The Tribunal’s reasons are contained in Part 6 of this Award. Accordingly, to this
extent, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s pleaded claims in paragraph (c) above as
regards the Junin and Chaucha concessions; and it rejects the Respondent’s pleaded

defence that the Claimant’s said claims are unfounded.

As regards the Claimant’s claim that the Respondent breached its international
obligations under the Treaty in regard to the option for the Telimbela concession, the
Tribunal has decided to reject that claim. The Tribunal’s reasons are contained in Part
6 of this Award. Accordingly, as regards Telimbela, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s
pleaded claim in paragraph (c) above; and the Tribunal accepts the Respondent’s

pleaded defence that the Claimant’s said claim is unfounded.

As regards the Claimant’s claims for compensation for breaches of the Treaty in regard
to the Junin concessions (as decided by the Tribunal), the Tribunal decides that the
Respondent contributed to 30 per cent of its loss by negligent acts and omissions
committed by its own senior management in Canada. The Tribunal decides that the
Claimant’s net loss (after deduction of such 30 per cent) amounts to US$
11,184,595.80. The Tribunal’s reasons are contained in Parts 6 and 7 of this Award.
Accordingly, to this extent only, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s pleaded claim in
paragraph (d) above; and the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s pleaded defence that

the Claimant’s said claim is unfounded.

As regards the Claimant’s claims for compensation for breaches of the Treaty in regard
to the Chaucha concession (as found by the Tribunal), the Tribunal decides that the
Claimant’s loss amounts to US$ 8,262,899. The Tribunal’s reasons are contained in
Part 7 of this Award. Accordingly, to this extent only, the Tribunal accepts the
Claimant’s pleaded claim in paragraph (d) above; and the Tribunal rejects the

Respondent’s pleaded defence that the Claimant’s said claim is unfounded.

PART 10 — Page 2 of 3

10.9.

10.10.

10.11.

Accordingly, as regards the total principal sum of compensation payable by the
Respondent to the Claimant under the Treaty in regard to the Junin and Chaucha

concessions, that sum is US$ 19,447,494.80, as decided by the Tribunal.

As regards interest under the Treaty accruing upon such principal sums for both the
Junin and Chaucha concessions, the Tribunal has decided to order compound interest,
with six-monthly rests, at the rate of 26-weeks US Treasury Bills, plus three per cent
as a normal commercial premium, starting as regards the Junin concessions on 3
November 2008 and as regards the Chaucha concession on 30 June 2009, until
payment. The Tribunal’s reasons are contained in Part 8 of this Award. Accordingly,
to this extent only, the Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s pleaded claim in paragraph (d)
above; and the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s pleaded defence that the Claimant’s

said claim is unfounded.

As regards the Parties’ respective claims for legal costs, it orders each of the Parties to
bear its own legal costs in full, without recourse to the other Party. Accordingly, the
Tribunal dismisses the Parties’ respective claims for legal costs. As regards the Parties’
respective claims for arbitration costs (not being their own legal costs), the Tribunal
orders each Party, as between themselves, to bear equally such costs, again without
recourse to the other Party. The Tribunal’s reasons are contained in Part 9 of this
Award. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects both the Claimant’s pleaded claim in
paragraph (e) above; and the Tribunal also rejects the Respondent’s pleaded claim that

it be granted its full costs of this arbitration, including its legal costs.
