INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the ““Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement between the
Government of Barbados and the Government of the Republic of Venezuela for the
Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Investments dated 15 July 1994, which entered into
force on 31 October 1995 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”), and the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States dated 18 March 1965,
which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

Claimant is Gambrinus Corporation and is hereinafter referred to as “Gambrinus” or the

“Claimant.”
Claimant is a company incorporated under the laws of Barbados.

Respondent is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela and is hereinafter referred to as

“Venezuela” or the “Respondent.”

Claimant and Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The

Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

OVERVIEW OF THE CASE AND PARTIES’ REQUEST FOR RELIEF

The dispute relates to the alleged expropriation by Respondent of Claimant’s ten percent
(10%) equity interest in a group of four Venezuelan companies, jointly referred to as
Fertinitro,! which produces nitrogen fertilizers (ammonia and urea) for export and internal

use in Venezuela, through the operation and maintenance of four petrochemical plants.

A Joint Investors’ Agreement establishing Fertinitro was concluded on 8 April 1998, and the

plants commenced commercial operations in 2001.

1 Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, S.A.; Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, C.E.C.; Fertilizantes
Nitrogenados de Venezuela, SRL; and Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, Fertinitro, C.E.C. (collectively
referred to as “Fertinitro”).

Fertinitro’s structure included four original shareholders at the top: Petroquimica de
Venezuela S.A. (“Pequiven”) a wholly owned subsidiary of Petrdleos de Venezuela S.A.
(PDVSA), the state-owned oil company, Polar Uno C.A. (“Polar”) a company incorporated
in Venezuela, Koch Oil S.A. (later denominated Koch Minerals S.a.r.l., (“Koch”)), a
company incorporated in Switzerland, and Snamprogetti B.V. (“Snamprogetti”), a
company incorporated in the Netherlands. In January 2008, Polar -under a new
denomination- namely Inversiones Polar S.A. (“Inv. Polar”)? executed a transaction with
the purpose of transferring its interest in Fertinitro to Gambrinus, the Claimant in this

arbitration.

On 11 October 2010, Expropriation Decree No. 7713 dated 10 October 2010, declaring the
compulsory acquisition of the assets of Fertinitro came into effect. The Decree directed
Pequiven, a 35% equity-holder in Fertinitro, to act as the “expropriating entity” and carry
out “the forced acquisition ... of all the real and personal property ... belonging or currently

in the possession of Fertinitro.”*

To date, Gambrinus has not received compensation from Venezuela for the forced
acquisition of its alleged investment in Fertinitro. According to Claimant, Respondent is thus
liable for breaches of Venezuela’s obligations to Claimant, a protected “Company” under
the terms of the BIT.*

Gambrinus requests that the Arbitral Tribunal issue an Award:

(a) Declaring that Respondent is in breach of its obligations under, among other
provisions, Articles 5, 2(2) and 3 of the Treaty, as well as customary international
law, and that, by virtue of the violations of the Venezuelan Expropriation Law,
Respondent is in further breach of Articles 5, 2(2) and 3 of the Treaty;

(b) Ordering that Respondent pay Claimant full compensation with respect to said
breaches of the Treaty and international law, in an amount of USD150,404,359.00
million, to bear interest at a rate no less than the Venezuela sovereign debt rate,

2 See infra 4 46.
3 Decree Law No. 7,713 of 10 October 2010, Official Gazette No. 39,528 dated 11 October 2010 (the “Expropriation
Decree”) (C-2).

compounded annually (or monthly LIBOR+8%, compounded monthly, or such
other rate as the Tribunal deems fit) until the date of the Award;

Ordering that Respondent pay all costs of and associated with this arbitration,
including Claimant’s legal fees, experts’ fees, disbursements, administrative fees
and the fees and expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal;

Ordering that post-Award interest shall continue to run on all sums so awarded at
the Venezuela sovereign debt rate, compounded annually (or monthly LIBOR+8%,
compounded monthly, or such other rate as the Tribunal deems fit) until the date of
payment; and

Granting such other and further relief as the Arbitral Tribunal deems just and
5
proper.

12, For its part, Venezuela contends that Gambrinus is not a foreign investor in Venezuela, it

has made no investment, suffered no detriment and has taken no risk. The belated transfer

from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus was made in clear breach of the Founding Agreements of

Fertinitro such that Gambrinus never received title to shares in Fertinitro, and in all cases the

transfer was made at such time as to fabricate jurisdiction.®

13, Respondent requests that the Arbitral Tribunal:

(a)

(b)

decline jurisdiction in the present proceedings;

in the alternative, dismiss all of Claimant’s claims in finding that Respondent has
not breached its obligations either under the BIT or international law;

in the alternative, if the Tribunal should decide to make an award in favour of
Claimant, limit the award to a maximum amount of USD 13.7 million;

order Claimant to pay all costs incurred in connection with these arbitration
proceedings, including the costs of the arbitrators and those associated with ICSID,
as well as the legal and other expenses incurred by Respondent, including the fees
of legal counsel and experts, plus interest; and

order such other relief as the Tribunal, in its discretion, considers appropriate.”

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. The Institution of Proceedings and the Constitution of the Tribunal

14,

On 9 November 2011, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated 8 November 2011 from
Gambrinus Corporation against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (the “Request” or
“RfA”). The Request was supplemented by a letter dated 1 December 2011, answering
questions posed by the Centre.

On 2 December 2011, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In
the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute
an Arbitral Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the Centre’s Rules

of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the
Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the formula set forth under Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal is composed of Piero Bernardini, a national of Italy, President, appointed by
agreement of the Parties, Marc Lalonde a national of Canada, appointed by Claimant, and

Pierre-Marie Dupuy, a national of France, appointed by Respondent.

The President of the Tribunal accepted his appointment on 24 April 2012, and his co-
arbitrators on 8 February 2012, and 15 March 2012, respectively.

On 24 April 2012, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), the Secretary-General notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Mairée Uran-Bidegain, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

B. The First Session of the Tribunal and the Exchange of Written Pleadings

24,

The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties on 12 July 2012. The Parties confirmed
that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed. It was agreed inter alia that
the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that both
English and Spanish would be the procedural languages of the arbitration and that the place
of proceeding would be Paris, France. The Parties agreed on a schedule for the
jurisdictional/merits phase of the proceedings. The agreement of the Parties was embodied
in Procedural Order No. 1 signed by the President and circulated to the Parties on 23 July
2012, supplemented by letters of 30 July 2012 and 26 September 2012.

On 8 June 2012, Respondent submitted a request to address the objections to jurisdiction as
a preliminary question (the “Bifurcation Request”). This was followed by Claimant’s

Observations on the Bifurcation Request on 22 June 2012.

On 6 July 2012, Respondent submitted a response to Claimant’s Observations of 22 June

2012, and on 9 July 2012, Claimant submitted final observations on the Bifurcation Request.

On 30 July 2012, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties of the Tribunal’s decision

not to bifurcate the proceedings, joining Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction to the merits.

Following the schedule agreed between the Parties and the Tribunal during the first session,

for a non-bifurcated procedure, the Parties filed their written pleadings as follows:

(a) Claimant filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits, and Quantum on 30 November
2012, accompanied by a witness statement of Mr. Reinaldo Gabaldon and an expert

report of Mr. Brent Kaczmarek of Navigant;

(b) Respondent filed its “Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, Merits, and Quantum,” on
17 May 2013, accompanied by witness statements of Francisco Toro and Simén

(c) Claimant filed its Reply on the Merits and its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, on
30 August 2013, accompanied by a second witness statement from Mr. Reinaldo

and a second valuation report by Mr. Kaczmarek;

30.

On 18 March 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 authorizing Respondent to
deal with a particular jurisdictional argument relating to Respondent’s allegations that

Claimant had failed to comply with the terms of Section 6.7 of the Joint Investors Agreement

and therefore failed to obtain valid title to the Fertinitro shares.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, on 16 May 2014, Respondent filed a written

submission on the Invalidity of the Purported Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus;

and on 21 July 2014, Claimant answered Respondent’s submission of 16 May 2014.

Iv. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

33. The Tribunal summarizes below in chronological order, insofar as relevant to make its

determination, the factual background of these proceedings.

A. The Project

34. During the 90s, Venezuela was a net importer of agricultural products and by the end of the
decade it imported up to 64% of the internal food consumption.* Against this background,

Venezuela decided to increase its production of fertilizers.°

fertilizer production facility.

36. On 14 October 1997, Pequiven, Polar, Koch, and Snamprogetti, concluded a Fertilizer
Development Agreement, setting forth the framework for the creation of a joint venture for
the construction and operation of a fertilizer production facility, namely two ammonia and

35. During that time, Pequiven sought private partners to participate in the development of a
| two urea plants, together with the commercialization in both local and export markets, of the

ammonia and urea produced by the plants (the “Project”).'° Ammonia and urea are both

fertilizers used to increase crop productivity. !!

According to Respondent, the selection of the participants to the Project was made intuitu
personae: Koch had experience in international and U.S. markets for production and
distribution of fertilizers; Pequiven had experience in the fertilizers national market;
Snamprogetti had experience in the construction of industrial plants and would serve as the
engineering, procurement and construction contractor and become a shareholder; and Polar,
one of Venezuela’s largest private business, was invited to participate in the project as a
domestic partner, in order to inspire confidence in Venezuela’s environment and thereby

attract external funding.”

On 8 April 1998, Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti and Polar concluded a Joint Investors’
Agreement (“JIA”), setting forth the contractual framework for the construction, operation
and investment terms of the two ammonia plants, each with a minimum nameplate capacity
of 1,800 metric tons of ammonia per day, and of the two urea plants, each with a minimum
nameplate capacity of 2,200 metric tons of urea per day. '3 Pursuant to the JIA, the four joint
investors (also referred to as “Owners” under the terms of the JIA), agreed on the creation

of the following Venezuelan companies:
= Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente S.A.; (the “Company”)
= Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente C.E.C.; (the “Comandita”)
= Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, SRL; and

= Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, Fertinitro C.E.C. (the “Operating
Company”).

These four companies are jointly referred to as “Fertinitro.” Section 2.1 of JIA, provided

for the ownership structure of Fertinitro as follows:

* 35% owned by Pequiven (as holder of Class A shares in the Company, and Class
V shares in the Comandita);

= 35% owned by Koch (as holder of Class B shares in the Company, and Class W
shares in the Comandita);

= 20% owned by Snamprogetti (as holder of Class C shares in the Company, and
Class X shares in the Comandita); and

= 10% owned by Polar (as holder of Class D shares in the Company, and Class Y
shares in the Comandita).

Koch and Polar owned their respective interests in the Project through wholly owned
“Special Purposes Subsidiaries” (as defined in the JIA), namely Koch José Cayman Islands
Limited (“Koch José”), and Polar José Investments Limited, (“Polar José”) respectively,
both companies organized under the laws of Cayman Islands.'* In accordance with Section
2.4 of the JIA, and the Recitals, Koch and Polar as Owners, remained responsible together
with the Special Purpose Subsidiaries for compliance with all the obligations under the JIA.
Moreover, the only assets of the Special Purpose Subsidiaries were the shares or debt in the
Fertinitro Companies. By 18 February 1998, Koch transferred 28.571% of its interest in
Koch José to Latin American Investment Fund (“LAIF”). LAIF then became a 10%

shareholder of Fertinitro.

On or around the same date of the conclusion of the JIA, several agreements related to the
construction, maintenance and financing of Fertinitro were also executed. Among others,
on 8 April 1998, Koch, Pequiven and International Petrochemical Sales Limited (“IPSL”)
(an affiliate of Pequiven), executed a 20 years Offtake Agreement, pursuant to which both
Koch and Pequiven/IPSL, agreed to buy ammonia and urea produced by Fertinitro on a

“Take-or-Pay” basis until the loans taken out by Fertinitro to finance the project would be

repaid.'> Neither Polar nor Polar José were parties to the Offtake Agreement and had no

role in marketing or selling Fertinitro’s output.

The sales of fertilizers to the international market were regulated by Article 2.3 of the Offtake
Agreement, pursuant to which, Pequiven and IPSL had the right to market and sale output
in South and Central America and the Caribbean, including Venezuela, and Koch, had the

right to market and sale output in the North American markets. 16

Under the Offtake Agreement, Pequiven’s potential sale of fertilizers to the Venezuelan
market was limited to 10% of its allocated output. This percentage was increased to 15%
three years later, and by 1% per year thereafter.'” In addition, the Offtake Agreement set a
specific formula to determine the price at which Koch and Pequiven were entitled to buy

urea and ammonia from Fertinitro for resale or for their own consumption. '*

The project finance structure contained many other service and financing agreements,
including an Equity Contribution Agreement, setting forth the obligations of the Owners to
fund their capital contributions to the constituent Fertinitro entities, the Common Security
Agreement, and the Transfer Restrictions Agreement, setting forth the transfer

requirements requested by the Project lenders. !°

On 12 May 1998, Polar Uno C.A., the Venezuelan company that concluded the JIA, changed
its name to Inversiones Polar S.A. (Inv. Polar).2! Three years later, on 6 August 2001, Inv.
Polar decided to remove Polar José (the Special Purpose Subsidiary of the Cayman Island),??
from the Fertinitro investment structure and instead, to own its shares through Inv. Polar, the
Parent Company. According to Claimant, this was in response to a change in Venezuela’s
tax law that established a list of “low tax jurisdictions,” which included the Cayman
Islands.?> Consequently, Polar José notified the Fertinitro shareholders and lenders that it
was transferring all its interest in Fertinitro, previously owned through Polar José, to be
owned directly by Inv. Polar.”* Polar José completed the transaction without objection from

the other shareholders.?5

Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente S.A., the Company, was at the corporate structure’s
effective peak. The management of Fertinitro was carried out through a nine-member
Board of Directors for each of the four companies mentioned above, with the Board of the
Company at its top. Pequiven appointed 3 members, Koch and LAIF appointed 3 members
in total, Snamprogetti appointing 2 members and Polar José, appointed one member, to each
of the boards. In addition, each shareholder appointed one or more alternate directors.?”
Certain management functions such as, for example, the appointment of the Chairman of the

Board, were reserved to Koch and Pequiven, the largest shareholders.7*

Polar José, Inv. Polar and Gambrinus appointed Messrs. Hernan Anzola, and Oscar
Grossman as Directors, in different periods, and Mr. Reinaldo Gabaldén as Alternate

Director. Mr. Gabald6n is acting as witness in the present proceedings.

B. Renegotiation of Agreements and Potential Buy-Out of Private Shareholders by
Pequiven

50, Between 2001 and 2005, LAIF and Pequiven requested at different times an agreement from
the Fertinitro Board of Directors to amend the Offtake Agreement. On the one hand, LAIF
was concerned that the “off takers” were paying below-market price for urea, to Fertinitro’s
detriment, and requested that the price be raised.” On the other hand, Pequiven requested
the right to purchase additional urea at a reduced price (from the price agreed in the Offtake
Agreement), for resale in the Venezuela market for the period between 2005 and 2007.
From 2005 to 2006 directors and shareholders continued to discuss potential revisions to the

Offtake Agreement.?! However no agreement was ever reached.”

51, In 2007, Pequiven initiated talks with Fertinitro’s shareholders to gain additional control
over Fertinitro’s equity and output. Concomitantly, the Board of Directors discussed the
potential effects of Venezuela’s policies of seeking additional State control over
petrochemical activities. For example, on 18 January 2007, Mr. Parra, one of Koch’s
directors reported that Mr. Toro, Pequiven’s appointed alternate director, had informed the

board that “time ha[d] run out and Pequiven must take control of the Offtake and business”;

2° In April 2005, at the request of the Fertinitro Board of Directors, Blue, Johnson and Associates, an independent
consulting firm issued a report reflecting the results of its review of the Offtake Agreement. The firm had been
to review the iency and implications of the A t’s pricing on the revenue being
generated to the venture and its investors. It concluded that the Agreement was harming the company’s profitability,
as it resulted in more benefits for Koch and Pequiven/IPSL, but less revenue for the other shareholders. The off-takers
had an economic incentive not to amend the Offtake Agreement. See Presentation Report prepared by Blue Johnson
& Associates INC dated 5 April 2005 (R-22); Cl. Reply, ff 25, 26; see also Resp. C-Mem., ff] 72-78.

volume of urea that Pequiven could produce outside of Fertinitro. See also, Minutes of Board of Directors Meeting

“Fertinitro must be run by the Venezuelan State;” and “all shareholders’ rights and

agreement will be respected.”

52. Less than a month later, on 8 February 2007, Mr. Francisco Toro, reiterated to the Board of

Directors a similar statement:

[G]iven the policies of the Venezuelan State, which were supported by
Pequiven, it would be necessary to search for a way and design a process by
which control of the production and marketing of Fertinitro’s fertilizer could
be handed over to Pequiven. Mr. Toro repeated that existing agreements would
be honored but that this step was inevitable and would have to be completed
within a matter of months. He added that Pequiven would soon be holding
individual talks with each shareholder to try to reach an amicable agreement
on the matter.

53. The Parties disagree on whether these communications could be considered as a threat of a
potential expropriation*®® or a confirmation of Pequiven’s desire to buy the other

shareholders’ interest at a fair and arms-length value.°¢

54. In late 2007, the shareholders negotiated a draft Memorandum of Understanding (“MOU”)
concerning the sale.>7 The MOU was not executed. The Parties differ on the reasons for

which the transaction was not completed. **

time that the government of Venezuela was not nationalizing Fertinitro; see Reinaldo Gabaldén’s Personal Notes from
December 11, 2007 Meeting with Miguel Zaldivar (Partner, Hogan & Hartson LLP) (RG-114).

37 Draft Memorandum of Understanding (2007) (RG-36) (Nav. 116). The draft MOU provided by both Parties contains
track changes and therefore may not be the latest version.

38 Claimants state that the lack of financing by Pequiven prevented the deal from going through, as the price was set
in agreement by all shareholders including Pequiven (see Cl. Mem., {| 51-52; Cl. Reply, {| 34-35). According to
Respondent, Koch had set a price exceeding the reasonable valuation of the plant and this broke the negotiations (see
Resp. C-Mem., § 126).

Contribution Agreement

On 21 January 2008, pursuant to Section 6.2.2 of the JIA and Section 12(b) of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company and the Comandita, Inv. Polar, as the successor
of Polar Uno C.A., notified Pequiven, Koch Oil S.A., Snamprogetti B.V., Fertilizantes
Nitrogenados de Oriente C.E.C and Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, S.A., of its

intention to “transfer all the Polar Interests to Gambrinus Corporation.”*°

In that same letter,
Inv. Polar, specified that it “desired to consummate the transfer as soon as practicable and
no later than 24 January 2008.”4° Inv. Polar then requested from the addressee’s-
shareholders a “waiver” of the 30 day prior notice requirements contemplated in the JIA for

transfers to affiliates.*!

The 21 January 2008 notice was accompanied by an “Assumption Instrument” dated 22
January 2008, to be signed by Inv. Polar and Gambrinus Corporation, “before the
consumption of the Transfer, all in compliance with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the [JIA] and
Section 12(b) of the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Comandita and the

Company.”*? Under the terms of the executed Assumption Instrument:

= Inv. Polar agreed to remain jointly and severally “responsible” with Gambrinus for
compliance with all the obligation of Inv. Polar under the JIA;

= Inv. Polar agreed to repurchase its interest in Fertinitro should Gambrinus cease to be
an affiliate of Inv. Polar;

= Gambrinus agreed to become a part to the JIA, adopted the JIA and assumed all of the
obligations as if it were an original “named party thereto.”

58. On 24 January 2008, Gambrinus and Inv. Polar executed a Share Purchase Agreement.

Pursuant to clause THREE of this agreement, Gambrinus would pay USD eighty million one
hundred (USD 80,000,100.00) for Inv. Polar’s 10% equity interest in Fertinitro “at a future
date following the granting of this document.” On that same date, Simon Guevara, the
Secretary of Fertinitro’s Board, sent an email to Tony Parra, Koch-appointed Director,
stating that the transfer complied with the requirements under the purchase and financing

documents, including the JIA Section 6.2.4°

59, On 15 February 2008, Gambrinus and Inv. Polar subscribed a Common Share Subscription
Agreement.*” In accordance with the terms of this agreement, Gambrinus issued 800,001
(Eight hundred Thousand One) Common shares in itself to Inv. Polar for an amount of USD
80,000,100.00.48 The Share Subscription Agreement further stipulated that “as a result of
the capitalization of the Subscription Amount by [Inv. Polar] in [Gambrinus], the account
receivable that [Inv. Polar] has against [Gambrinus] is hereby extinguished.”*? No cash was

exchanged between Gambrinus and Inv. Polar for this transaction.”

60. In April 2008, after Gambrinus was already incorporated in the project, a USD 70 million
dividend payment to all shareholders was approved by Fertinitro. The dividend was paid in
dollars to all shareholders, including Pequiven.*! To allow this dividend, the lenders required

According to Respondent, from 1999 onwards, restructuring Venezuela’s food and
agriculture system and achieving “food security’ by way of increasing its agriculture

productivity, became one of the priorities of the Venezuelan Government. *°

In furtherance of this objective, Venezuela first issued the 2001 -2007% and subsequently the
2007-2013, national plans for economic and social development of the Nation.>”? Among
their objectives, the plans sought to guarantee “food security,” and “food sovereignty” by
“respecting the right to property and eradicating and penalizing the /atifundios and the non-
use of lands,” and carrying out an “ integral rural development”®? as a means to achieve
sustainable economic growth. According to Respondent, the government developed several
other plans with the purpose of furthering food self-sufficiency and food security. Ensuring
adequate fertilizer supply was one of the elements of these plans. Claimant emphasizes

that the Plans contemplated the continued presence of the private sector.°!

Domestic demand for fertilizers, particularly urea, increased between 1999 and 2005. The
majority of Fertinitro’s urea production was destined to exports and Pequiven’s other
fertilizers plants (El Morén and El Tablazo) experienced production problems. In 2004, the
domestic urea demand was not satisfied by the domestic production, and Venezuela imported

urea.®

In 2002, Venezuela enacted the Law of Expropriation for Reasons of Public or Social Utility.

 

On 1 D ber 2005, V la enacted an d tt to the Law to Stimulate
Development of the Petrochemical, Carbochemical and Related Activities.“ According to
Article 4 of the amended law, Pequiven and its mixed companies shall guarantee the

satisfaction of the domestic market as a priority, at competitive prices.

From 2006 and there onwards, Venezuela continued to regulate the food and agriculture

sector through various decrees and regulations.

On 21 February 2007, Decree-Law 5,197, (the “Hoarding Law”) came into effect. Article
4 of the Hoarding Law declared all goods necessary for the development of activities related
to the production, fabrication and distribution of food or products subject to price control, as
being goods of “public utility and social interest” (de utilidad publica e interés social). The
same provision further declared that for safety reasons and food-sovereignty and without
further formality, the government may initiate expropriation proceedings to be carried out

by executive decree.

On 6 March 2007, Decree No. 5,218 (the “Urea Decree”) came into effect.°” Articles 1 and

2 of the Urea Decree declared nitrogen fertilizers “goods of first necessity” (bienes de

primera necesidad), and imposed on all producers, distributors and exporters, the obligation
to meet the domestic demand for nitrogen fertilizers, before exporting the products. In
accordance with Articles 3 and 5 of the Urea Decree, the price and production of fertilizers
were subject to control and further regulated by a joint resolution of the Ministry of Popular
Power for Agriculture and Land, the Ministry for Light Industries and Commerce and the

Ministry for Energy and Oil (the “Urea Resolution”).

The Urea Resolution fixed the maximum price at which Pequiven could buy urea from any
producer “established” in Venezuela “in order to meet the needs of the Nation.” © The price
fixed by the Urea Resolution was below production price.” It further regulated the export of
urea, by requiring exporters to previously obtain a “Certificate of Satisfaction of the local

market.”7!

In April 2007, the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum circulated a draft Petrochemical
Organic Law for discussion before the National Assembly.” According to news reports, the
draft law provided that State-owned entities should hold a majority in all petrochemical
companies, and it eliminated the possibility for the State of concluding legal stability
agreements originally provided for in the Venezuelan law for the promotion and protection
of investments.”? The draft law further confirmed Venezuela’s commitment to the promotion

of “social, collective and private property.”

In July 2007, the Venezuelan National Council for the Promotion of Investments, posted a
press release stating that the law was expected to be enacted by the end of 2007 and that the

new law would require the State, through Pequiven, to assume the control of the 15 mix

51% ownership interest in those companies.”°

On 31 January 2008, Venezuela’s Decree Law 5,835, became effective (“Decree 5,835”).76
Article 4 of Decree 5,835, amended Article 4 of the Hoarding Law to include as goods of
“public utility and social interest” not only the goods subject to price control or necessary
for the production and manufacture of food, but also “any other products that had previously
been declared of first necessity.””” Article 4, last sentence restated that the government may
initiate expropriation proceedings through decree for reasons of “food sovereignty and

security.” 78

Six months later, on 31 July 2008, the Organic Law for Food Security and Sovereignty,
LOSSA, further declared in its Article 3, that all goods that ensure the population’s access
to and availability of food, and also the infrastructure necessary to develop those activities,
are goods of “public utility and social interest.” Article 3 also ruled that Venezuela’s
executive could by decree declare the compulsory acquisition of such goods, in exchange of
prompt and adequate compensation, when necessary to further the objective of food

security.”?

On 18 June 2009, the Organic Law for the Development of Petrochemical Activities, came

into effect.®° Pursuant to Article 5 of the Law:

The basic and intermediate petrochemical activity is reserved to the State, as
well as the works, goods or facilities required for conducting such activity. This

75, On 11 October 2010, Venezuela enacted Decree No. 7,713, which provides, in Article 1, the

forced acquisition of Fertinitro as follows (the “Expropriation Decree”):

The forced acquisition is ordered of all the real and personal property, including
property improvements, facilities, plants, industrial equipment, office and other
assets, required or needed for the production, processing, transport and storage
of fertilizers (urea and ammonia), belonging or currently in possession of the
corporations Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente, S.A.; Fertilizantes
Nitrogenados de Venezuela, S.R.L; Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Oriente,
C.E.C.; and Fertilizantes Nitrogenados de Venezuela, C.E.C.; or of any other
company or related persons, in order to achieve the complete and effective
realization of the national plans for sowing and production formulated by the
[Executive Branch of the National Government], which are needed to execute
the “Socialist Plan for Agro-Alimentary Sovereignty.”*!

76. Under Articles 2, 4-7 of the Expropriation Decree, Pequiven was designated as Fertinitro’s
“expropriating entity” and was given all necessary powers for the implementation of the
expropriation. Finally, all expropriated assets were to be transferred through Pequiven to
the Venezuelan government, without liens and limitations, in accordance with Article 3 of

the Expropriation Decree.

77. On that same day, Minister Ramirez went to the Fertinitro Plant and gave a press conference
stating that the government was taking over the plant.*? Gambrinus’ appointed Directors
resigned on 22 November 2010, stating that “from a practical perspective, Pequiven ha[d]

assumed full and exclusive operational and managerial control of Fertinitro to the exclusion

of any other investors, including Gambrinus Corp.”**

78. According to Respondent, thereafter, Fertinitro cancelled its debt towards its lenders by

5 Claimant

having Pequiven repurchase, from the lenders and bondholders, their loans.®
agrees that Fertinitro’s debt has been paid and suggest that Pequiven’s bond repurchase was
financed through the almost “half billion dollars in cash” that Fertinitro generated between

2011 and 2012.%°

79, Pequiven also commenced negotiations with the other Fertinitro shareholders to establish
the value of the compensation due for the expropriation. Negotiations were held with the
private shareholders of Fertinitro on 16 February 2011 in New York, and subsequently on 6
April, and 24, 25 May 2011 in Caracas.*” The letter summarizing the first meeting specified
that Mr. Oscar Grossman would represent “Empresas Polar” in this “consultation and
amicable settlement” phase.** Accordingly, that and subsequent letters summarizing the
points discussed during those negotiations were addressed to Empresas Polar, Koch
Minerals, Snamprogetti Limited and Magna Capital.® These letters made no mention of

Gambrinus Corp.

On 28 June 2011, Koch filed a request for arbitration against Venezuela before ICSID, which
was registered by the ICSID Secretary General on 19 July 2011.% The Fertinitro

shareholders, however, continued negotiations.

At the request of the shareholders, and following their comments, Advantis prepared a
revised valuation report that was circulated to the shareholders on 19 July 2011. The revised

updated report valuated Fertinitro at between USD 452 million and USD 561million.?

On 26 July 2011, Pequiven initiated judicial expropriation proceedings before the Court of
First Instance of the Judicial Circuit of Anzodtegui of Venezuela. Subsequently, the court

appointed an administrator to carry out the expropriation.
On 1 September 2011, the shareholders met for the last time in Miami, Florida.

JURISDICTION

A. Introduction

87.

88.

89.

Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal ratione personae, ratione temporis
and ratione materiae, under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, alleging inter
alia that (A) Gambrinus is not a protected foreign investor and Polar’s use of Gambrinus’s
legal personality is an abuse of corporate personality; (B) the dispute pre-dates the
“interposition” of Gambrinus in the corporate structure and/or was reasonably foreseeable at
that time; and (C) Gambrinus made no investment, as it has not proved title to the Fertinitro
shares and its purported interest is not an “investment” for purposes of the ICSID Convention
and the BIT.

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that jurisdiction in the present case is subject to a dual test,
meaning that it must exist both under the ICSID Convention and the applicable investment
protection treaty, the Agreement between the Government of Barbados and the Government

of the Republic of Venezuela dated 15 July 1994 and in force on 31 October 1995.

ICSID jurisdiction and the competence of this Tribunal derive from Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention, which states in relevant part:

(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State... and a national of
another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing
to submit to the Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party
may withdraw its consent unilaterally.

(2) ‘National of another Contracting State’ means:

(b) any juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting
State other than the State party to the dispute on the date on which
the parties consented to submit such dispute to conciliation or
arbitration and any juridical person which had the nationality of the
Contracting State party to the dispute on that date and which, because
of foreign control, the parties have agreed should be treated as a
national of another Contracting State for the purpose of this
Convention” .

24

90.

91.

92.

Article 1(a) of the BIT defines “investment” as “every kind of assets invested by nationals
or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party [...].”
Article 1(d) defines “companies” as meaning, “in respect of each Contracting Party,
corporations, firms and associations incorporated or constituted under the law in force in
that Contracting Party. For the purpose of the Convention referred to in Article 8 [ICSID
Convention] ‘Company’ shall include any company incorporated or constituted under the
law in force in one Contracting Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals

or companies of the other Contracting Party.”

Article 8 of the BIT sets forth the disputes that may be submitted to arbitration according
to the BIT and the ICSID Convention:

(l) Disputes between one Contracting Party and a national or company of
the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the former under this
Agreement in relation to an investment of the latter shall, at the request of the
national concerned, be submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes for settlement by arbitration or conciliation under the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of other States opened for signature at Washington on March 18,
1965S.

(4) Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of disputes as referred to in paragraph 1 of this Article to
international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

The jurisdiction of the Centre depends first and foremost on the consent of the parties.°”
Tribunals shall exercise jurisdiction over all disputes that fall within the scope of the parties’
consent as long as the dispute satisfies the objective requirements set forth in Article 25 of
the ICSID Convention. In the words of Professor Aaron Broches, the purpose of Article
25(2)(b) is to

. indicate the outer limits within which disputes may be submitted to

conciliation or arbitration under the auspices of the Centre with the consent of
the parties thereto. Therefore the parties should be given the widest possible

57 Report of the Executive Directors of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development on the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Dispute between States and National of Other States, 1 ICSID Reports 28, stating that
“{c]onsent of the parties is the cornerstone of the jurisdiction of the Centre” (J 23).

latitude to agree on the meaning of “nationality” and any stipulation of
nationality made in connection with a conciliation or arbitration clause which
is based on a reasonable criterion should be accepted.”

Regarding the “outer limits within which disputes may be submitted to conciliation and
arbitration,” Broches points specifically to a situation where it should not be permitted to

the parties “to use the Convention for purposes for which it was clearly not intended.””?

Based on Article 25 of the Convention and the BIT this Tribunal has jurisdiction over the
present dispute if the following requirements are met: (1) Claimant is a “national or
company” of a Contracting Party to the BIT and a “national of another Contracting State”
to the ICSID Convention; (2) Claimant has an “investment” in the territory of the other
Contracting Party and in accordance with the ICSID Convention; (3) the legal dispute arises
directly from the investment; and (4) the parties to the dispute have consented to ICSID

jurisdiction over it.

Bearing in mind the principles that have just been recalled, the Tribunal shall now examine
Respondent’s arguments that there is no jurisdiction ratione personae, ratione temporis and

ratione materiae.

B. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Ratione Personae

96.

(1) The Parties’ Positions

According to Respondent, Gambrinus is not a foreign investor in Venezuela: the only true
investor is Polar, a Venezuelan corporation, and the mere incorporation of Gambrinus in
Barbados is not sufficient for Gambrinus to qualify as an “investor” for purposes of the BIT
and the ICSID Convention. !°° Claimant, in turn, argues that Gambrinus is a purposeful
investor under the BIT, since it is incorporated in Barbados and there are no reasons to
disregard Claimant’s Barbadian citizenship. Moreover, it is established practice that any

agreement on nationality included in the BIT, also satisfies the definition of “national of

another contracting state” for purposes of the ICSID Convention, and thus this Tribunal has

jurisdiction ratione personae over Claimant.

a. Respondent’s Position

97. Respondent alleges that Gambrinus does not qualify as an “investor” under the BIT and a
“national of another contracting State” under the ICSID Convention, on the basis of the

following arguments:

i. First, Gambrinus is an empty off-shore entity with no operations. It is owned,
controlled and run by Polar, a Venezuelan company, in Venezuela. In accordance
with the text of the BIT and the purpose of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal
should look at Gambrinus’ economic reality to determine whether it can be
considered a foreign investor under the BIT, instead of stopping its analysis at the

place of incorporation. '°!

ii. | Second, even if the Tribunal would consider that only the incorporation criterion
should be followed under both, the BIT and the ICSID Convention, Gambrinus
corporate veil should be pierced, on the basis of an occurrence of abuse of process
and fraude de ley, '°

(i) Gambrinus’ status as an “investor” for purposes of the BIT and the ICSID

Convention
98. According to Respondent, Gambrinus does not exist as an economic entity in its own right.
Gambrinus is undistinguishable from Inv. Polar as it has no business or economic activities
of its own and lacks any meaningful link with Barbados.'® It is registered in Barbados as an
“International Business Company,” a qualification typically given to shell companies, and

its registered addresses correspond to secretarial service providers.'** Instead, it is entirely

owned by Inv. Polar, without any true identity and no independent decision-making powers,
controlled by the same high ranking executives of Inv. Polar based in Caracas,'°° as well as
managed by the same directors previously appointed by Inv. Polar, Mr. Grossman and Mr.
Gabaldén.!°° Moreover, Polar became involved in Fertinitro for its characteristics as a

7 and it was Inv. Polar, and not

Venezuelan company and not as a foreign investor!”
Gambrinus, which participated in the settlement negotiations with Pequiven. As such, even
after the Share Transfer, Inv. Polar and not Gambrinus continued to be treated as the actual
shareholder in Fertinitro.!°* Mr. Gabald6n’s continued to receive his salary from Polar, and
Mr. Sucre, the director of the board, approved both, the sale by Inv. Polar, and the purported
purchase by Gambrinus. '°° All these factors, according to Respondent, prove that Gambrinus

is not a foreign investor under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.
The BIT

Respondent explains that the reference in Art. 1(d) of the BIT, second sentence, to “effective
control” reflects Barbados and Venezuela’s intention that economic realities and the
economic substance of the entity, be considered when determining the nationality of an
investor.'!° It further adds that “an investor incorporated in Barbados but void of any
independent economic substance and effectively controlled by a Venezuelan company does

not satisfy the nationality requirement.” !!!

In addition, as a matter of international law, the place of incorporation criterion is not
sufficient to determine a company’s nationality. Contrary to Claimant’s recount of the
Barcelona Traction holding, in that case the Court found that, in addition to the place of

incorporation, there was a need for some “permanent and close connection” between the

State of purported nationality and the corporation.'!? Moreover, according to Respondent,
“the need for a permanent and close connection has also been recognized by Article 9 of the
International Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection, which reflects

customary international law.”!"

Furthermore, Respondent suggests that Claimants’ reliance on the Yukos, Saluka, ADC, and
Tokios Tokelés cases to have the Tribunal rely solely on the place of incorporation is
misplaced, as those treaties “contained no control criterion at all” or in the case of Tokios,
Tokelés the “applicable provision concerned entities incorporated in third states and its

purpose was to extend the scope of protection” to those states.! \4
The ICSID Convention

Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that the definition of investor included in the BIT,
instrument of consent, should always be a determining factor over any potential objective
definition arising from the Convention. Instead, according to Respondent, such definition
should be disregarded in special cases where it proves to be “unreasonable in light of the

ICSID Convention’s object and purpose.”!!5

Venezuela posits that by considering Gambrinus as a protected investor, the Tribunal would
be permitting Inv. Polar, a Venezuelan corporation, to submit a purely domestic dispute to
an ICSID Tribunal, which would be contrary to the ICSID Convention’s object and

purpose. !!¢

Venezuela considers that Claimant’s reliance on the Aucoven, Tokios Tokelés and Rompetrol

tribunals to establish jurisdiction ratione personae under the Convention is misplaced. First,

eo

the Aucoven Tribunal agreed, citing Mr. Broches, that the Parties’ discretion to determine

the nationality of companies-investor is limited by the purpose of the Convention.

. Second, the Tokios Tokelés majority recognized that the dispute must satisfy objective
requirements of the Convention to fall under the jurisdiction of the tribunal.''” Moreover,
in Tokios Tokelés, the claimant had a real business activity in Lithunia, and the “test of the
siege social” used in that case would lead to the conclusion that Gambrinus is not an

investor.!!8

. Third, in Rompetrol, the claimant was only partially owned by a Romanian national, not
entirely owned and the BIT provided for more than only ICSID Arbitration. Therefore, no

parallels can be drawn from both cases.'!°

. Furthermore, Respondent argues that its proposition is further supported by the intuitu
personae nature of the contractual arrangements underlying the Fertinitro Project, pursuant
to which transfers were subject to restrictive conditions, as the original investors would
remain liable for all obligations under the contracts.'?° It alleges that “Polar was chosen to
participate in Fertinitro because of its Venezuelan identity”!”! and it was Polar Uno C.A.,
which signed the JIA and the By-Laws of Fertinitro, subscribed to the original shares, and
became one of the Owners of Fertinitro.'?* Inv. Polar, as the transferor of its rights under
the JIA, bore the risks of Gambrinus’ participation in Fertinitro, and as the guarantor to
Gambrinus, Inv. Polar remained jointly and severally liable for all obligations relating to the

Project.'23 It also retained control over the Claimant.'

. Additionally, Respondent rejects Claimant’s arguments that the investment was done

through a non-Venezuelan entity from the inception, i.e, Polar José, the entity from the

BL

followed under both the BIT and the ICSID Convention, Respondent submits that
Gambrinus’ corporate veil should be pierced and Gambrinus legal personality should be

considered indistinguishable from that of its shareholder, Inv. Polar, a Venezuelan company.

0. Respondent states that “the factors considered by arbitral tribunals in piercing the corporate
veil are based on the notion of abuse (and in some cases, fraud) and seek to ascertain whether
or not abusive corporate structuring or treaty fraud is established. Accordingly, ... if there
has been a misuse of the legal personality, the corporate veil of the company must be
pierced.”!2° Contrary to Claimant’s allegations, “tribunals have a discretionary power to
decide whether it is appropriate to apply this equitable doctrine in cases submitted to their

scrutiny,” !?7

Respondent contends that the present case merits piercing the corporate veil because

29128

Gambrinus is “an empty vehicle with no genuine connection to Barbados and Inv. Polar

is using its legal personality as “an opportunistic shield” to gain access to ICSID
jurisdiction.'° Venezuela submits that “the Share Transfer was a purely artificial
transaction. Gambrinus did not disburse a single dollar when it received Fertinitro’s shares
from Polar, nor did it suffer any economic detrimental impact as a result of the
acquisition.”!2° Moreover, Claimant failed to submit any evidence to support its statement

that Gambrinus is a “corporation of substance.”!?!

Respondent further contends that the takeover of Fertinitro was predictable and imminent.
By 2008, date of the transfer to Gambrinus, Inv. Polar knew that Venezuela would soon take
control of Fertinitro. It was at that point, according to Respondent, that Inv. Polar executed
the “hasty reorganization to transfer, on a purely technical level, its holding to
Gambrinus,” !°2. which was completed for the sole purpose of obtaining a nationality of
convenience and gain access to ICSID arbitration by committing an abuse of process and

legal personality. '°

. Moreover, by doing so, Gambrinus also incurred a “fraude de ley” under Venezuelan law.

As explained by Professor Iribarren, the fraude de ley or “fraud of law” principle “is based
on the notion that “an entity may be [a] party to legal dealings which are an indirect breach
of the law, in the sense that they achieve a result contrary to the legal framework, although

technically complying with the letter of the law.”'*4

. Gambrinus intended to evade (through the share transfer, an otherwise legal means) the

jurisdiction of Venezuelan courts over the present dispute, and thereby purposefully elude
mandatory rules that dictate the submission of expropriation claims to the Venezuelan courts,
as a matter of public policy. These elements are sufficient to conclude that the share transfer

constituted a fraude de ley, '%5

. Respondent concludes that the present circumstances justify piercing the corporate veil and

that the Tribunal must decline jurisdiction ratione personae to prevent the investment treaty

arbitration system to be abused. '3°

b. Claimant’s Position

(i) Gambrinus’ status as an “investor” for purposes of the BIT and the
ICSID Convention
Numerous investor-state tribunals have accepted that when incorporation in a state is the
sole condition for corporate nationality, no further requirements should be imposed. '3? The
nationality definition in the BIT applicable to these proceedings is satisfied by reasons of
simple incorporation in a contracting state. Since Claimant is incorporated in Barbados,
Claimant satisfies the BIT’s corporate nationality definition.'°* In addition, as admitted by
Respondent, the widely accepted established practice is to find that any agreement on
nationality of the BIT satisfies the first prong of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. '*°

The BIT

Claimant rejects Respondent’s reading and interpretation of Article 1(d) of the BIT,
including its second paragraph. It alleges that Article 1(d) looks solely to “incorporation” as
the criterion of nationality. The second paragraph of Article 1(d) does not dictate the
Tribunal to inquire into the nationality of the claimant’s ultimate shareholders, which
Claimant considers to be irrelevant.'4° Under the second paragraph, a Venezuelan company
will qualify as a Barbadian national if owned or controlled by a Barbadian citizen or a

Barbadian company. '*!

Claimant relies on the Oostergetel, Saluka and Yukos and Rompetrol tribunals and the Tokios
Tokelés Majority for the proposition that where agreed upon definitions appear in a treaty, a
Tribunal should not unilaterally alter it and that the BITs’ definitions of nationality should

govern the nationality requirement. '47

Claimant also contends that the application of the express terms of the BIT (i) conforms with
the principles of treaty interpretation of Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (“VCLT”), and (ii) comports with the object and purpose of the BIT, including
Barbados’ intention of protecting all its juridical entities regardless of the nationality of the

shareholders. '*?

Gambrinus further challenges Respondent’s factual allegations on its so-called “economic
realities” highlighting that it failed to cite cases in support of such test and insists that
tribunals have consistently refused to insert additional jurisdictional criteria to replace those
chosen by the Parties. '4 Furthermore, it alleges that whether Claimant is a shell company
or not, this has no impact on jurisdiction, 45 and in any event, Venezuela has failed to refute
the evidence showing that Gambrinus, which was incorporated in 2004," had investment
activities and was “a corporation of substance.”!4” Claimant became the direct shareholder
in Fertinitro and directly assumed contractual obligations to the other shareholders, pursuant
to the JIA and the 2008 Additional Capital Contribution Agreement.

According to Claimant, Article 1(d) second paragraph of the BIT is intended to “expand”
ICSID jurisdiction, by covering also locally-incorporated entities under foreign control and

thereby triggering the second limb of Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. It cannot be

construed as diminishing the BIT’s provision defining nationality.'** Since this is not a case
brought against Venezuela by a Venezuelan-incorporated company that claims to be
controlled by “Barbadian nationals,” Article 1(d) second sentence does not come into

play.'49
The ICSID Convention

Claimant sees no grounds for the Tribunal to look further into an objective separate definition
in the ICSID Convention. According to Claimant, the test of incorporation, based on the
definition of the BIT, is wholly reasonable and consistent with the object and purpose of the
Convention, especially where, as Broches notes, parties have been given “the widest possible
latitude to agree on the meaning of ‘nationality’ [under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention] and any stipulation of nationality made in connection with ... a[n] arbitration
clause which is based on a reasonable criterion, should be accepted.”!® Therefore, the

nationality requirement of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention is also satisfied.'*!

Similarly, Claimant’s reliance on the ILC Draft Articles on Diplomatic Protection is
unavailing since the Draft Articles do not apply to the extent that they are inconsistent with
special rules of international law, such as treaty provisions for the protection of investments,

as found by various prior tribunal, including Rompetrol.'?

(ii) Veil-Piercing, Abuse of process and Fraude a la ley or Fraude de Ley

Claimant notes that when a party makes a “veil-piercing” plea, this virtually concedes that a
prima-facie showing of the corporate nationality has been made. Claimant also rejects

Respondent’s position that Gambrinus corporate veil should be pierced.

Past tribunals, including the ICJ in Barcelona Traction, have held that veil-piercing is
reserved for exceptional cases involving injustice or fraudulent use of corporate form, none
of which exist in this case.'*3 Here, Claimant submits, there are no exceptional factual bases

2

for claiming that Gambrinus was incorporated for “fraudulent purposes,” “abuse of legal
personality,” “malfeasance” or “evasion of legal requirements or of obligations.”'** Instead,
Gambrinus was formed in 2004, several years after the investment and four years before
acquiring the Fertinitro shares, and was engaged in other business activities, such as
acquiring shares in Metanol de Oriente S.A. (“Metor”).'°> Claimant acquired the Fertinitro
shares, through a real issuance of equity shares in exchange of Fertinitro shares; it is not an
artificial transaction and it was completed at the suggestion of Pequiven, in anticipation of a

potential sale of the shares to Pequiven, at a time when no expropriation was made. '*°

Claimant also underlines that from the outset the JIA and Offtake Agreement permitted off-
shore affiliates to hold Fertinitro shares. Gambrinus’ Fertinitro shares were originally held
by Polar José, another foreign entity from Cayman Islands and Pequiven itself used a BVI
entity in the Offtake Agreement.!5’ The Transfer of Fertinitro shares to Claimant from Inv.

Polar “merely restored the status quo ante.” '*8

The mere fact that Inv. Polar agreed to “remain responsible with the transferee Affiliate” for
compliance with the JIA, does not change the separate, independent legal obligations
assumed by Gambrinus, as an “original named party” to the JIA, according to Claimant.'*
Moreover, as explained by Mr. Kaczmarek, the January 2008 acquisition was “not a ‘cost-

free’ transaction, but a common method of acquiring another company.”!®°

128. Accordingly, there are no legal bases to conclude that the 2008 transfer from Inv. Polar was
improper. In any case, as already recognized by the Tidewater tribunal, even if the transfer
to Claimant was purely motivated by the desire to obtain future treaty benefits, this would
not prevent the Tribunal from finding that Gambrinus is a Barbadian company and that it has
jurisdiction ratione personae. '*! Citing also to the Mobil tribunal, as well as Prof. Schreuer,
Claimant alleges that the weight of authority holds that it is a perfectly legitimate goal to

restructure investments with investment treaty protection in mind, !

129, Similarly, Respondent’s fraude a la ley objection shall be dismissed because it requires the
subjective intent to evade a norm of public policy. However, these elements are absent in
this case. First, the transfer of shares occurred to address currency exchange concerns and
therefore no “subjective intent” can be shown, and, second, the BIT is a fully “implemented”
treaty in Venezuela, and therefore reliance on the BIT cannot be an evasion of “a mandatory
norm.”!® As explained by Professor Ayala, “the option exercised by Gambrinus, that is, one
of the two equally valid and effective alternatives under Venezuelan law [namely recourse
to the BIT, or to the Venezuelan courts] and which protect investors, cannot be understood

to be a violation of Venezuelan public order.”!

130. For all these reasons, Claimant alleges that there are no exceptional circumstances that would
allow the Tribunal to ignore Claimant’s status under the laws of Barbados and pierce the
corporate veil. Accordingly, the conditions for jurisdiction ratione personae are met in this

case.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

Jurisdiction ratione personae depends on how “nationality” is defined in the ICSID
Convention and the BIT, this definition setting the limits to the rights protected which may

only be those belonging to a qualifying investor.

As it has been noted, Contracting States enjoy broad discretion to define corporate
nationality under the ICSID Convention. “[D]efinitions of corporate nationality in national
legislation or in treaties providing for ICSID’s jurisdiction are directly relevant to the
determination of whether the nationality requirements of Article 25(2)(b) have been met”
and “[a]ny reasonable determination of the nationality of juridical persons contained in
national legislation or in a treaty should be accepted by an ICSID commission or

tribunal.”!®

As mentioned by other ICSID tribunals, the drafters of the ICSID Convention, in reliance
on its consensual nature, preferred giving the Contracting Parties a greater latitude to define

oes

investment,

themselves such terms as “legal dispute, nationality” and “foreign
control.”!° Thus, it has been held that “the jurisdiction of the Centre depends first and
foremost on the consent of the Contracting Parties, who enjoy broad discretion to choose

the disputes that they will submit to ICSID.”!°7

Considering the freedom thus left to the Contracting Parties to identify specific criteria to
determine the nationality of a juridical person, one may turn to the applicable investment
protection treaty to find which are these criteria. According to the BIT, incorporation in
Barbados is sufficient to establish nationality of a company.'®® Therefore Gambrinus is a
“national of another Contracting State” and a “national” or “company” meeting the

nationality requirement of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. This is Claimant’s position.

135. As previously explained, Respondent contends in opposition that the freedom left by the
ICSID Convention to the Contracting Parties is not absolute since it cannot supersede the
very purpose of the Convention, which is to promote “foreign private international
investment” as stated by the Preamble. It adds that Gambrinus is a shell company with no
activity whatsoever either in Barbados or in Venezuela, the purpose of the transfer of

interest by Inv. Polar in 2008 being to get the benefit of the BIT Barbados-Venezuela.

13

s

In support of its position, Respondent argues that the BIT expressly applies a control
criterion to determine corporate nationality in cases where the company is incorporated in
one Contracting Party but “owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies, of
the other Contracting Party.”'® It relies on Article 1(d), second sentence, of the BIT,
according to which
For the purposes of the Convention referred to in Article 8 “Company” shall include
any company incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one Contracting

Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals or companies of the other
Contracting Party.'”°

137. According to Respondent, this provision necessarily has a double effect: first, extending
jurisdiction to companies incorporated in the Host State but controlled by nationals of the
other Contracting Party; second, preventing companies incorporated in one Contracting
party but controlled by nationals of the Host State from suing the Host State.!7! According
to Respondent, the reference to “effective control” in the second sentence of Article 1(d)

reflects Barbados and Venezuela’s intent for economic realities to be taken into account.'”

138. Always according to Respondent, the provision would apply also to the present case with
the effect of excluding that Gambrinus, being owned or effectively controlled by a
Venezuelan entity, is eligible as a “Company” for purposes of the ICSID Convention under
Article 8 of the BIT. Respondent relies on the treaty interpretation criteria codified in the
VCLT, specifically Article 31(1) according to which the treaty provision should be

interpreted “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms
of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”'” In this respect, an
analysis of the purpose and object of the BIT, as described in the preamble confirms that the
Tribunal should look at economic realities, since the BIT aims to provide protections to

foreign and not to domestic investors.'

139. The Tribunal does not share Respondent’s interpretation of the second sentence of Article
1(d) of the BIT. It considers that this provision mirrors Article 25(2)(b), second part, of the
ICSID Convention according to which the nationality requirement is satisfied also in case
of a company incorporated in the Contracting State party to the dispute if such company is
subject to foreign control. As indicated by the wording used for the definition of “Company”
under Article 1(d), second sentence, of the BIT, the intent of the Contracting Parties was to
expand such definition to include “any company incorporated or constituted under the law
in force in one Contracting Party which is owned or effectively controlled by nationals or
companies of the other Contracting Party.” The “expansive” effect of Article 1(d), second
sentence, is the same as it is provided by Article 25(2)(b), second part, of the ICSID

Convention.

140. Respondent's interpretation is at odds with the “ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty
in their context” under the VCLT and with the Contracting Parties’ intention to give an
expansive effect to this provision, as made manifest by the wording adopted. According to
this interpretation, the provision “includes” the situation that Respondent seeks instead to
exclude. When applied to the case of Gambrinus, the effect of the provision would not be
to “exclude” Gambrinus, from the scope of Article 8 of the BIT, but rather to consider that
Gambrinus, being a company incorporated or constituted under the law in force in one
Contracting Party, namely Barbados, would be eligible for dispute settlement purposes to
bring a claim against Barbados under the BIT as a company “owned or effectively
controlled by nationals or companies of the other Contracting Party,” i.e. controlled by Inv.

Polar, a Venezuelan company.

40

141, Respondent further contends that failing application of the above provision to exclude that
Gambrinus meet the nationality requirement under the ICSID Convention and the BIT,
Gambrinus’ corporate veil should be pierced since “Polar’s use of Gambrinus’ legal
personality is a prime example of abuse of personality.”!7> Respondent relies on the ICJ’s
Barcelona Traction case as recognising that the act of piercing the corporate veil is part of
the international customary law “to prevent the misuse of the privilege of legal

personality.” !7

142. The Tribunal notes initially that Barcelona Traction’s ruling concerns diplomatic
protection, a context which is not the one of investment protection regulated by the ICSID
Convention and the BIT. It notes further that piercing the corporate veil may only apply in
exceptional circumstances, in case where “fraud” or “malfeasance” is clearly established,
this being the type of conduct considered by Barcelona Traction as justifying a veil-
piercing. Respondent has not shown that Claimant has used its status as a Barbadian entity,
known to and accepted by Respondent, to perpetrate fraud or engage in malfeasance. As it
has been noted, there is nothing wrong for a prudent investor “to organise its investment in
a way that affords maximum protection under existing treaties, usually by establishing a

company in a State that... accepts incorporation as a basis for corporate nationality.”!77

143, There is also no basis for Respondent’s claim that by entering into the Share Transfer
Agreement with Inv. Polar, Claimant committed a “fraude a la ley” under Venezuelan law
since the aim of the transaction was to avoid the application of mandatory Venezuelan laws,
specifically the expropriation law, and to evade the exclusive jurisdiction of Venezuelan
courts. As it has been correctly mentioned, the option to make recourse to the BIT protection
was equally valid under Venezuelan law, the BIT being part of this law, so that its choice
cannot be understood as a violation of Venezuelan public order.'’ The only basis for

establishing jurisdiction ratione personae in this case is the conformity of Claimant’s claim

with the requirements of the ICSID Convention and the BIT, not with mandatory rules of

the local law.

In the exercise of its functions the Tribunal is guided by the terms in which the Contracting
Parties to the BIT have agreed to establish its jurisdiction. According to the Tribunal’s
interpretation, the BIT only requires that Claimant be constituted under the laws of one of
the Contracting Parties. As a company incorporated or constituted in Barbados, one of the

BIT’s Contracting Parties, Gambrinus satisfies the jurisdiction ratione personae.

The Tribunal’s finding of jurisdiction ratione personae under the BIT is not dispositive of
all issues of jurisdiction. It leaves open the question whether in the particular case the ICSID
Convention is used for a purpose for which clearly it was not intended by permitting that a
purely domestic dispute be internationalized into a treaty investment dispute in violation of

the “outer limits” of that Convention!”

Contrary to Claimant’s suggestion that only the BIT is relevant for the purposes of
determining jurisdiction ratione paersonae, cases on which it relies confirm the need to
consider in addition whether jurisdiction in the particular case is consistent with the very
purpose of the ICSID Convention. Thus, the tribunal in Aucoven, referring to the discretion

left to the parties by the framers of the Convention in defining nationality, held:

it goes without saying, however [...] that this discretion is not unlimited and cannot
be exercised to the point of being clearly inconsistent with the purposes of the
Convention, '*°

Likewise, the majority of the tribunal in the Tokios Tokelés case held:

Tribunals shall exercise jurisdiction over all disputes that fall within the scope of the
Contracting Parties’ consent as long as the dispute satisfies the objective requirements
set forth in Article 25 of the Convention.'*!

"79 Supra, J 93. To use the words of another tribunal, “[t]he tribunal has to ensure that the ICSID mechanism does not
protect investments that it was not designed for to protect, because they are in essence domestic investments disguised
as international investments for the sole purpose of access to this mechanism.” Phoenix Action, Ltd v. Czech Republic,

147. Unless jurisdiction is to be excluded on any other ground, it shall therefore be necessary to

examine in the context of jurisdiction ratione materiae whether Gambrinus owns an
“investment” in Venezuela according to the ICSID Convention and the BIT and, if so,
whether Gambrinus is a shell company having made no contribution, as alleged by

Respondent.

C. The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Ratione Temporis

148.

149,

(1) The Parties’ Positions

According to Respondent, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis because Inv. Polar
transferred it shares to Gambrinus with the purpose of gaining access to ICSID “at a time
when the dispute had already arisen, or was at the very least reasonably foreseeable.” !**
Claimant answers, in turn, that the Share-Transfer responded to business considerations and
that Respondent’s challenge to the 2008 Share Transfer as an abuse of rights is factually

unsupported. '83

a. Respondent’s Position

A change of nationality which enables an investor to access international arbitration when
the dispute between the parties (defined as “a disagreement on a point of law or fact, a
conflict of legal views or of interest between two persons”) had already arisen or was
reasonably foreseeable should lead to a lack of jurisdiction.'** This has been established by

numerous tribunal including Mobil, Phoenix Action and Pac Rim. '*°

150. Respondent submits that Pequiven’s stated aim for Fertinitro to be run in line with “the

philosophies of the Venezuelan government and its laws,” conflicted with the interest of

Fertinitro’s private shareholders years before the Expropriation Decree was enacted, 6°

151. According to Respondent, the dispute arose, at the latest, in early 2007 with the adoption of
the Urea Decree and the Urea Resolution. At the time of the 2008 Share Transfer, Fertinitro
had already been affected by these and other regulatory measures which reflected the

government’s increased control over food security industries. !8”

152. In particular, the Urea Decree and Urea Resolution significantly impacted Fertinitro’s
revenues; '** prompted Fitch to downgrade Fertinitro’s rating from B to CCC;!*? prompted
the Fertinitro Board to declare an “Event of Force Majeure” under the Offtake Agreement;
and were regarded by Koch, another Fertinitro shareholder who initiated a separate
arbitration proceeding, as a “creeping expropriation.”!”! All of these events demonstrate the

existence of a dispute.

153, Venezuela also submits that, unlike what Claimant alleges, whether Gambrinus decided or

not to bring a positive legal claim on the basis of the Urea Decree is irrelevant to determine

... Pequiven began diverting a higher percentage of FertiNitro’s production to the domestic market in 2006.

This was followed by a 2007 government regulation mandating that urea be supplied first to the domestic
market. Since then Pequiven has run the Jose facility itself; Koch pulled its own people out in 2007. (C) Koch
has received verbal assurances from Pequiven that the project would not be affected by the new petrochemical
legislation. In the event of nationalization, however, Koch has prepared by registering its FertiNitro affiliate in
Switzerland to give it access to the Swiss Bilateral Investment Treaty. A Koch representative added that
Pequiven’s management of the facility could be termed a “creeping expropriation” given that it no longer
consults with the FertiNitro Board or abides by other contract provisions.

if there is a dispute. For a dispute to exist, the applicable test is whether at the time of the

purported transfer “a conflict of legal views or interests existed.” '*

Accordingly, the purported 2008 Share Transfer was made after the dispute had arisen, and

there can be no jurisdiction over Gambrinus.

Relying on the Pac Rim and Tidewater cases, Respondent further submits that, in any case,
an abuse of rights can also occur when the dispute, albeit not yet in existence, was reasonably
foreseeable, !°3 Venezuela contends that the escalation of regulatory and legislative measures
in 2007, as well as repeated public and private warnings at the time of the purported 2008
Share Transfer, made the expropriation obvious and inevitable (at the very least), and

therefore beyond the reasonably foreseeable standard, for the following reasons:

156, First, the 2007 legal climate unequivocally pointed to Fertinitro’s nationalisation:

With Venezuela’s National Development Plan to “take control” of strategic production
activities and related measures in the background, it was “imminent and foreseeable” that, as
part of the government policy, Venezuela would take control of Fertinitro’s assets.!°*

The framework for Fertinitro’s expropriation had already been established.'* Relying on Dr.
Irribaren’s Opinion, Respondent alleges that in Venezuela all expropriation process have
three distinct phases: the first phase begins when the legislative body enacts a legal act
declaring that the assets and activities are of “public interest,” a second administrative phase
follows in which the executive body declares the expropriation; and third, a judicial phase
consisting of the payment of compensation to the affected parties and the transfer of title of
the assets. '%°

In this instance, the pre-expropriatory phase began in February 2007 with the enactment of
the Hoarding Law. This law declared that all products necessary for the production and
manufacturing of food were public and of social interest. It continued with the issuance of
the Urea Decree and Decree 5835 and the enactment of the Draft Petrochemical Organic
Law, that would require Fetinitro’s acquisition of at least 51% of the shares, as well as other
measures in the field of food security followed during the first quarter of 2007. Subsequent
to this, Inv. Polar transferred its interest to Gambrinus in 2008.

2007,!%” there had been public warnings by the President of Pequiven, and by President

160. Thus, the objective of the purported share transfer and subsequent change of nationality of
the Inv. Polar equity interest was to enable Gambrinus to access international arbitration by
bringing a pre-existing or reasonably foreseeable dispute as an international dispute under

the BIT. This should lead the Tribunal to decline jurisdiction over the present proceedings.

b. Claimant’s Position

161.

According to Claimant, Respondent’s assertion that the transfer of Fertinitro shares to
Claimant was motivated by an imminent expropriation is unfounded. Instead, Claimant
asserts, it was based on business considerations for currency-related reasons to receive U.S.
dollars in anticipation of Pequiven’s purchase of Inv. Polar’s interests in Fertinitro.?™
Moreover, Pequiven’s own lawyer, Mr. Simon Guevara, was of the opinion that there was a
reasonable risk that a dividend to be paid to a shareholder located in Venezuela could be

subject to currency restrictions.?°°

162. Relying on Mr. Gabaldén’s statement and documentary evidence, Claimant contends that

the initial buy-out negotiations coincided with discussions between Inv.Polar and Pequiven

for the sale to Pequiven of Inv. Polar’s interests in another mixed company, Metor. 7°° In

reliance of its witness, Mr. Gabald6n, Claimant stated that during those negotiations:

Mr. Garcia [a Pequiven representative] suggested that the best way for Inv.
Polar to receive U.S. dollars for its shares was for Inv. Polar to transfer its
interest in Metor to an ‘off-shore’ entity, because such a transfer would obviate
the need for Pequiven to obtain approval of the Central Bank of Venezuela and
Ministry of the Popular Power for Energy and Oil to make foreign currency
payments to a domestic corporation.

Based on this suggestion, Inv. Polar transferred its interest in Metor to
Claimant. Inv. Polar then also followed the same practice when it transferred
its Fertinitro shares to Claimant, in anticipation of another acquisition by
Pequiven.”””

163. Claimant denies that the buy-out negotiations ended in late 2007, as alleged by
Respondent. According to Claimant, in December 2007, Pequiven’s counsel stated that
the buy-out was on a “fast track” set for “early next year (1 Qtr)?* and Pequiven was
ostensibly still working with the lenders at that time toward the completion of the
transaction. “Thus, Fertinitro was also still considering dollar-denominated dividend
payments in January 2008, which provided an additional impetus for Inv. Polar to transfer

its shares to Gambrinus.”?°°

164. According to Claimant, there is no basis to suggest that there was a crystalized expropriation
claim, much less a dispute between Inv. Polar and Venezuela at the time of the January 2008
acquisition. Claimant denies that the Urea Decree and Resolution triggered a dispute
between the Parties. ?!° Since Fertinitro had no choice but to comply with the Urea Decree,

there was no dispute over its application: “it was accepted and complied with.”2!!

165. In any case, Respondent mischaracterizes the case law on this question, as neither Phoenix,
Tidewater nor Mobil suggested that “any” regulatory measure affecting the investor could

trigger an “abuse of right” claim. Instead, the notion of “pre-existing dispute” must be “tied

to the specific measures that form the Claimant’s cause of action in the arbitration.”?!?

Neither Inv. Polar nor Gambrinus made a legal claim concerning the implementation of the
Urea Decree and Resolution, which would be necessary for a dispute to exist.?!? Claimant’s
claim rests on the October 2010 Expropriation Decree alone not the Urea Decree or

Resolution, 7!

Even if the Tribunal would be willing to accept that a prior measure which caused damage
could be a “pre-existing dispute,” “the evidence... demonstrates that ‘damages’ caused by
the Urea Decree and Resolution were mitigated by events.”?!5 Relying on Mr. Gabaldén’s
statement, Claimant asserts that only 15% of Fertinitro’s output was subject to the Urea

Decree?! and it did not constitute an Event of Default under the offtake agreement.*!”

Moreover, Gambrinus rejects the allegation that the expropriation of Fertinitro was actually
foreseeable or imminent, and argues that even a transfer of interests made in anticipation of
a potential adverse measure is not an “abuse of right.” Even under Pac Rim, the standard is
an exacting and high one: Respondent must show that Claimant “fore[saw] a specific future

dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible controversy.”?"*

Relying on Mr. Gabaldén’s statement and Prof. Ayala’s Opinion, Claimant asserts that
Respondent failed to meet this standard. Claimant argues that the Government measures
cited by Respondent to argue that the expropriation was “imminent” and “foreseeable” to a
“high degree of probability” were not understood by Inv. Polar as creating a “real threat of

nationalization.”?!

For example, the Urea Decree “was an assurance against expropriation” 220

as it expressly
contemplated the participation of private investors in the fertilizers industry provided the
government be satisfied that the domestic demand for nitrogenous fertilizers was met at the
specified price.”! Moreover, at the time, the Ministry of Oil and Energy made assurances

that the Urea Decree would not negatively impact Fertinitro’s Operations.”””

Similarly, neither the Hording Law nor the Decree 5,835 of January 2008 amending the law,

or the subsequent regulations indicated that an expropriation was looming; the 2001-2007

and the 2007-2013 National Development Plans, as well as the 2005 National Sowing Plan,
did not contemplate a 100% takeover by the Government and expressly contemplated the
existence, participation and continuation of private investors in private-public partnerships

like Fertinitro.?”°

171. Claimant further denies that Mr. Toro informed Inv. Polar of a potential take-over of
Fertinitro’s interest. Instead, according to Claimants, Respondent expressly disclaimed any
intention to expropriate Fertinitro. First, Mr. Toro provided assurances that shareholders’
rights would be respected and that the Urea Decree would not negatively impact Fertinitro’s
operations.” Second, Respondent informed Claimant and the other shareholders of
Fertinitro’s interest in a buy-out through a negotiated process and in a December 2007
meeting, Mr. Miguel Zaldivar, Pequiven’s counsel, expressly told the investors that “the
Government of Venezuela was not nationalizing Fertinitro.”®*> Third, correspondence from
a Koch representative shows that, sometime in January 2007, Mr Toro stated that “all
shareholders rights and agreements will be respected.”?”6 Thus, at least on three occasions,
January, February and December 2007, Respondent represented that there would be no
expropriation.”” Finally, the 2008 acquisition occurred in an atmosphere of continued

negotiations between Fertinitro and the private shareholders for an amicable buy-out.?78

172. As to the other measures alleged by Respondent, including the 2009 Petrochemical Organic
Law, they had little effect on Fertinitro and they were passed after Claimant’s acquisition of

the Fertinitro shares. Therefore, they could not have suggested to Claimant that an

expropriation was foreseeable, nor could they motivate the transaction.”°

173. Moreover the Petrochemical Organic Law did not apply to pre-existing mixed companies,
such as Fertinitro; it required that Venezuela have a majority shareholding in new mixed
companies to take control of them, and thus did not require expropriation.” In addition, in
2009 Pequiven’s counsel, represented by Hogan & Hartson’s Caracas Office, provided a
Memorandum concluding that the law “did not result in the nationalization or expropriation

of Fertinitro’s shares,”?*!

174. Therefore, according to Claimant, these measures do not prove a pre-existing dispute or an
imminent or highly probable expropriation and Venezuela has failed to carry its burden of
demonstrating “to a high threshold” that there was an abuse of right, depriving this tribunal

of jurisdiction.

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

175. According to Respondent, since the dispute predates Gambrinus’ acquisition of an interest

in Fertinitro there is no jurisdiction ratione temporis.?”

176, Respondent relies on Phoenix holding that an investor cannot modify downstream the
protection granted to its investment by the host State “once acts which the investor considers
are causing damages to its investment have already been committed.””°> Respondent refers
also to Tidewater holding that a dispute may be considered to have arisen when it “could
reasonably have been foreseen”?*4, and to Pac Rim which considers that a dividing line is
passed, with resulting “abuse of process,” when “the relevant party can see an actual dispute
or can foresee a specific future dispute as a very high probability and not merely as a possible

controversy.”?35

Respondent lists a series of facts that in its opinion indicate that the conditions for a dispute
to have arisen existed in January 2008, when Inv. Polar transferred to Gambrinus its interest
in Fertinitro.2° According to Respondent, the transfer to Gambrinus was made after the
dispute had started for the purpose of resolving the same through an international regime

that would not have been available to Inv. Polar.?*”

The Tribunal notes that Phoenix, on which Respondent relies, accepts that investors are free
o “structure their investments... in a manner that best fits their need for international
protection,””® adding that they could not modify their investment after the reasons for a
dispute have already arisen.” Also Mobil has accepted that restructuring an investment is

“a perfectly legitimate goal as far as it concerned future disputes.”™°

In view of Respondent’s position, the question for the Tribunal is therefore whether in the
present case the dispute relating to an expropriation or a reasonably foreseeable
expropriation predated Inv. Polar’s transfer of its interest in Fertinitro to Gambrinus, a
Barbadian company, or if in any case the dispute was foreseeable thereby enabling Claimant

to have access to this Tribunal by an abuse of process.

In order to substantiate the position that the dispute pre-dated the transfer of interest from
Inv. Polar to Gambrinus, Respondent refers to a series of legislative and regulatory measures
reflecting Venezuela’s policy to ensure stable domestic food production and food security.74!
Among such measures, the National Development Plan for the Economic and Social
Development of the National for the period 2007-2013 were announced in January 2007,
declaring the State’s maintenance of “full control of production activities which are of

strategic value for the development of the country.””4

181. A few days later, on 21 February 2007, the Hoarding Law was published, declaring the
public utility and social interest of goods needed for food production activities and allowing
the Government to initiate expropriatory actions for reasons of food security and
sovereignty.” The Urea Decree followed on 26 February 2007, stating that food production
is “an essential element of national security and sovereignty” and declaring nitrogenous
fertilizers and products required for their production to be primarily for the local market and
that their prices would be regulated by ministerial resolutions. Such resolution was issued
on 2 May 2007 (the Urea Resolution), fixing the price at which Pequiven was entitled to buy

urea in order to meet domestic demand from any domestic producers, including Fertinitro.”4

182. Other legislative measures were contemplated regarding the petrochemical industry. A draft
of Petrochemical Organic Law was circulated around April 2007 providing that Pequiven
would have to hold a majority equity participation in all mixed petrochemical companies
(including Fertinitro),”45 the intent being to pass the Law before the end of 2007." On 23
September 2007, the new Socialist Petrochemical Revolutionary Plan was released declaring

the objective of turning Venezuela into a world petrochemical power.

183. On 28 January 2008, Decree 5835 was issued “declaring numerous products including
ammonia and urea, to be of a public utility” and stating that “for safety reasons and food

sovereignty and without further formality... the government might initiate expropriation

proceedings.”?47

Escalation of Measures in 2007

 

 

185, According to Respondent, this escalation of regulatory and legislative interventions
throughout 2007 could not but make a sophisticated and prudent business actor as the Polar
Group realise “that the expropriation of Fertinitro was inevitable”? and that the dispute in
that regard, if not already in existence, was reasonably foreseeable at the time of the
purported Share Transfer.?*° The more so since, according to Respondent, under Venezuelan
expropriation law the first step in the expropriatory process is the declaration of “various
products, including fertilizers, to be of public and social interest,” such declaration having

intervened in February 2007 with the Hoarding Law.”*!

18

a

It is undeniable that the series of measures enacted by Venezuela during 2007, directed as
they were to guarantee food security and sovereignty in various sectors of activity, would

have impacted also on Fertinitro’s production operations. However, the available evidence

188.

does not point to just one direction, namely the serious threat of imminent expropriation of

Fertinitro, as contended by Respondent.

Some of these measures, such as the Urea Decree and Regulation, had limited effects on

Fertinitro’s business activity,?>

the latter remaining “capable of servicing its debt
obligations and generating profits.””*? The Urea Decree did not even lead to a declaration of
default by Fertinitro under the financing documentation only 15% of its output being
estimated to be required to comply with that Decree.4As stated by Claimant, after studying
the effect of the Urea Decree for a year, on 15 October 2008 “Fitch Ratings upgraded
Fertinitro’s credit rating.”*°> The valuation so given of Fertinitro’s business activity by a
prominent ratings agency may be hardly reconciled with the imminent threat of an

expropriation.

Additional circumstances show that the situation prevailing in 2007 was far from suggesting
the imminence of Fertinitro’s expropriation. In a communication of 18 January 2007, Mr.
Parra, one of Fertinitro Directors, advised Mr. Gabaldén regarding comments made by Mr.
Toro in a previous Board Meeting on plans and intentions for Fertinitro’s future. The essence

and key points of Mr. Toro’s communication were:

* Time has run out and Pequiven must take control of the Offtake and the Business;
FertiNitro must be run by the Venezuela State;

Fertilizer is vital to the country’s needs;

All this is in line with the philosophies of the Venezuelan government and its law;
Pequiven will be bringing specific proposals for the consideration of all the
shareholders;

The discussions will be open, but time is limited;

Pequiven recognizes that the debt must be paid off-it is internally studying the process
to achieve this end;

Pequiven would like to have all shareholders continue to participate-nevertheless, one
shareholder has already offered its shares for sale, and this knowledge will be made
public shortly;

252 As explained by Mr. Gabaldon (II), {| 74, 93-94, 104, 105 and recognized by Mr. Toro, Pequiven’s representative
and the Company’s President, at Fertinitro Board Meeting of May 24, 2007: “based on estimates of urea consumption,
Pequiven’s own production, and the fact that Pequiven’s new fertilizer plant should be ready within three years, the
effect on Fertinitro of the requirement [to supply] urea at regulated price[s] should be very reasonable.” (RG-70, p. 2).

«All shareholders’ rights and agreements will be respected.?°°

In a subsequent board meeting of Fertinitro, on 8 February 2007, Mr. Toro stated that, given

the government’s policies supported by Pequiven,

it would be necessary to search for a way and design a process by which control
of the production and marketing of Fertinitro’s fertilizer could be handed over
to Pequiven.

According to Mr. Toro, existing agreements would be honored but this step was inevitable
and would have to be completed within a matter of months. He added that Pequiven would
soon be holding individual talks with the shareholders to try to reach an amicable agreement

on the matter.?°”

Following Fertinitro’s management favourable consideration, since October 2006 Pequiven
had started negotiating the purchase of one or more of the other shareholders’ interest in
Fertinitro.2®8 Therefore, despite the legislative measures contemplated or already enacted
that, according to Respondent, had an impact on Fertinitro’s future business prospects, in
February 2007 there was no threat of expropriation but rather a negotiation program in order
for Pequiven to acquire the control of Fertinitro based on “an amicable agreement” in the

pursuance of which “existing agreements” would be honored.?5?

According to Respondent, the shareholders other than Pequiven, including Inv. Polar,
showed interest in Pequiven’s proposal to buy their shares in Fertinitro.7° As reminded by
Mr. Toro, at that time, Polar had sold to Pequiven its interest in another mixed company with

the latter, Metor.7°' Negotiations followed for the buy-out of Fertinitro.

In November 2007, a draft MOU was circulated setting forth the general terms of a

transaction pursuant to which each of Koch, LAIF, Snamprogetti and Polar would have

transferred their respective shares in Fertinitro to Pequiven for an aggregate purchase price
indicated by the draft of USD 1,210,000,000.00 “less the outstanding balance of principal
and accrued interest on Fertinitro’s existing bank and bond financing as of the Closing

Date... plus the Excess Cash.”

The Parties disagree on the reasons for the failure to reach a final agreement on the buy-out
of Fertinitro’s shares by Pequiven. According to Respondent, the price indicated in the draft
MOU was “far exceeding a reasonable valuation of the plant” and therefore, the negotiations
were interrupted. According to Mr. Gabald6n, a sale of shares to Pequiven remained a real
possibility throughout much of 2008, Pequiven “seeking to raise the necessary funds to
complete the buyout,” which became too difficult for it “due to the worldwide economic

crisis that began in September 2008.”

By an e-mail of 30 September 2008 Mr. Miguel Zaldivar, counsel for Pequiven at Hogan &

Hartson, sent the following message to the representatives of Fertinitro’s shareholders:

At the request of some of the shareholders, the Citibank-Hogan & Hartson team
working with Pequiven invite you to participate in a meeting in Miami (at noon
in our offices, address is below) on Monday October 6 at which we will make
a presentation of a proposed plan involving the transfer of your interest in
FertiNitro and related fi ing issues. ially, some of the st Id
want to know the details of the finance plan, a step by step analysis of how it
will be implemented, attendant legal and financial risks, etc. Please confirm
whether you will be in attendance. Thanks and best regards, Miguel.?°°

The same document refers in its body to previous communications among the parties to the
proposed transaction confirming Claimant’s position that after December 2007 “Pequiven
was ostensibly still working toward the completion of the transaction.”*°° Evidence in the

file shows that on 6 October 2008, following the above invitation, Mr. Grossmann, a director

of Inv. Polar, attended a meeting with Hogan & Hartson, counsel for Pequiven, and Citibank

in Miami “to finalize issues related to the financing of the transaction.”?67

Based on the foregoing, it is the Tribunal’s view that at the time of the purported Share
Transfer to Gambrinus, “expropriation” of Fertinitro was not only far from being in existence
but neither “reasonably foreseeable” or “highly probable,” as alleged by Respondent.”
There would have been no need for Pequiven to continue to negotiate the terms of a complex
transaction as the one related to the Fertinitro’s buy-out, if Respondent had plans of

expropriating Fertinitro in January 2008.

More may be said on the subject. Respondent’s claim -relying on the Phoenix holding- that
the Urea Decree and Regulation had “cause[d] damages to” Fertinitro so that a “dispute...
had already arisen” in January 2008 making Gambrinus’ acquisition an “abuse of right,”
is to be rejected. As previously mentioned and as recognized also by Pequiven, the effects
on Fertinitro’s business of the Urea Decree and Regulation were minimal, Fitch having
upgraded again Fertinitro’s rating in October 2008.2”. Even accepting the holding of other
tribunals according to which to consider that a dispute exists it is sufficient that it be
“reasonably foreseeable”?”! or “highly probable,”?” it is a fact that in January 2008 there
was no “dispute” which might have had a negative impact on Fertinitro’s business activities

in the near future.

Under general international law, a dispute means “a disagreement on a point of law or fact,
a conflict of legal views or interests between parties.”””> ICSID tribunals have adopted
similar description of a dispute, holding that in order for a dispute to exist it must be

susceptible of being stated in terms of a concrete claim.?”* No such “disagreement” or

“conflict of legal opinions or of interests” had emerged in January 2008, even if only

potentially, regarding Fertinitro and its expropriation.

Based on the foregoing analysis and evidence in the file, the Tribunal concludes that
Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction ratione temporis is to be dismissed. Except to the
extent relevant for other aspects of the case, this determination dispenses the Tribunal with
inquiring into the reasons underlying the Share Transfer of January 2008, a subject on which

the Parties disagree.?”5
The Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Ratione Materiae

(1) The Parties’ positions

According to Respondent, Claimant cannot be considered to have made an investment under
the objective criteria of the ICSID Convention Article 25.7” In addition, the applicable BIT
definition is not met “because Gambrinus never made an active contribution, nor did it ever
commit any resources for the Fertinitro shares it purportedly acquired.”*”” Moreover, since
Gambrinus alleged “investment” was made in violation of Venezuelan laws, the dispute
arising from it falls outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.?% Claimant, in turn, rebuts
Respondent’s allegation, stating that Gambrinus held at all material times 10% of the
outstanding shares in Fertinitro, which is sufficient to satisfy the terms of the BIT and the
ICSID Convention. The Salini test, including the criteria for contribution and risk, does not

establish jurisdictional requirements, which are, in any event, met in this case.?”

a. Respondent’s Position

Respondent rejects Claimant’s contention that the burden of proof lies solely on Respondent
to prove that Claimant did not have title to its investment, and states that pursuant to
international law “it is for the claimant that wishes to bring a claim to demonstrate that it
held an investment.””*° It further argues that, in any case, to the extent that it falls on

Respondent, Venezuela has fully satisfied this burden.”*!

(i) The validity of the Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus

According to Respondent, the Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus involved “a
technical arrangement involving a share issue and the creation and then cancellation of a
hypothetical debt with no detriment to Gambrinus.””®? Such transfer was not in accordance
with the terms of the transfer restrictions of the Fertinitro Founding Agreements and
therefore Gambrinus has no standing before this Tribunal because it never received title to

the shares in Fertinitro.

1, The modalities of the Share Transfer and alleged applicable
restrictions under the Founding Agreements

. In recognition of the intuitu personae nature of the JIA and the Fertinitro Companies By-

laws, these documents contained detailed restrictions on the transfer of their interests.

Sections 6(2) and 6(7) of the JIA contain the required conditions for the disposition of
interests in Fertinitro. Section 6.2 included two different set of regimes. One for share-
transfer to third parties (i.e. any party that is not an Owner or an affiliate of an Owner as
defined in the JIA) and another one for transfer “by an Owner to an Affiliate of such

Owner.”

In accordance with Section 6(2) for transfers to an Affiliate, an Owner would have to
comply with inter alia the following: (i) provide 30 day written notice of the transfer to

Fertinitro and the other Owners; (ii) repurchase the shares transferred to the affiliate if the

affiliate ceases to be an affiliate of the Owner; (iii) ensure that the transferring Owner
remains responsible with the transferee Affiliate for compliance with all the obligations of
the transferring Owner under the Agreement; and (iv) comply with the conditions of 6(7),

which were applicable to any type of transfer.?6

In accordance with Section 6(7), all transfers of participating interest in Fertinitro shall be

made “exclusively for cash or cash equivalent.”

Respondent argues that these transfer requirements —as the other provisions of the JIA~
were specifically chosen among sophisticated commercial entities, with extensive
knowledge and experience of concluding commercial contracts of this type and

complexity.”

. In addition, Articles 11 to 15 of the By-Laws of Fertinitro Oriente S.A. contain a mirror

validity requirement that all transfers be made “in cash or cash equivalent to the exclusion
of any other forms of consideration,” and that any non-compliant disposition of interests

would be null and void.?8

According to Respondent, it is undisputed that Gambrinus did not make a payment in “cash
or cash equivalent.” Instead, Inv. Polar and Gambrinus devised a “share for share

transaction.”?°°

This was accomplished first, through the 21 January 2008 notice, by which Inv. Polar
informed the other Owners of the purported Share-Transfer and “urgently” requested that
they waive the 30-day notice period required under Section 6.2.2(a) of the JIA and 12(b)
of the By-Laws.”*’ Respondent alleges that Claimant failed to explain the urgency of the

request. 288

The second step was the execution of the 24 January 2008 Share Purchase Agreement
pursuant to which Gambrinus would pay Inv. Polar’s USD eighty million one hundred
(USD 80,000,100.00) for Inv. Polar’s 10% equity interest in Fertinitro.° The one and
half page was not circulated to the other Owners.” “[W)hile the shares were stated to
have already been transferred, payment would only take place at an undetermined future

date,” following the “granting” of the document.?”!

Third, on 15 February 2008, Gambrinus and Inv. Polar subscribed a Common Share
Subscription Agreement.”°? Under this agreement, Gambrinus issued further shares in
itself to Inv. Polar for USD eighty million one hundred (USD 80,000,100.00). The amount
owed by Inv. Polar to Gambrinus for the subscription of those new shares was set off
against the identical sum that Gambrinus owed to Inv. Polar under the Share Purchase

Agreement. 7”

Respondent further alleges that under this arrangement, no funds were transferred from
Gambrinus to Inv. Polar. Similarly, the issuance of new shares could not be considered as
a payment in cash or having been made through a “cash equivalent.” This was expressly

recognized by Claimant during the hearing. Respondent asserts that:

[I]t is generally accepted that a cash equivalent is a fully liquid asset, that is
one of that is readily convertible into cash on a short-term basis... Gambrinus
is not traded publicly, and as such there is no market for the trade of its shares
and no way in which their value can be quickly and precisely defined. Shares
in Gambrinus could therefore not constitute a cash equivalent as they are not
an immediately realizable liquid asset.”*°

Respondent claims that it did not realize the share-for-share nature of this transaction until

it read Claimant’s Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.?°°

2. Gambrinus’ alleged acquisition of the Fertinitro shares

Pursuant to Section 6.1. of the JIA, all transfers that did not comply with all required
conditions, would be null and void, and have no force or effect.?°” On this basis, the
consequence of Inv. Polar’s non-compliance with the terms of the JIA and By-laws is that
the purported transfer is ipso iure null and void, which pursuant to Venezuelan law, has the

same effect as non-existence.”

Respondent also rejects Claimant’s allegations that the aforementioned transfer restrictions
do not apply to inter-affiliate transactions, as is the case between Inv. Polar and Gambrinus.
A transfer to an Affiliate constitutes a “Permitted Disposition” under Section 6.2 of JIA,
which expressly requires that Section 6.7 be complied with. Respondent further contends
that the heading of Section 6.7 unequivocally states that it applies to all transfers. The same

reasoning applies to Art. 14 of the By-Laws.””

Accordingly, the Share Transfer never materialized; Gambrinus never acquired ownership
of the shares in Fertinitro and it never became an Owner under the terms of the JIA, as further
confirmed by Dr. Garcia Montoya, Respondent’s appointed legal-expert. As a result, it made

no protected investment under the BIT and cannot be subject to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.>°

(ii) Gambrinus’ alleged investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT
According to Respondent, in this case there is no investment either under the ICSID

Convention, or under Article 1(a) of the BIT.

Respondent rejects Claimant’s contention that satisfying the requirements of the BIT is

sufficient to satisfy Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.*”' Citing for support to several

ICSID decisions and commentators, Respondent asserts that an investment must pass a “dual

jurisdictional test.”>°

Respondent posits that the existence of objective criteria for purposes of determining if there
is an “investment” under the Convention, and the use of the “Salini criteria,” have been
widely accepted by ICSID tribunals and cannot be simply dismissed, as Claimant’s attempt
to suggest.°3 Recent cases such as Caratube, Quiborax, KT Asia and Malicorp have
recognized that the mere holding of shares is “insufficient” for an investment to be found to
exist.34

First, considering the Salini criteria, as expanded by subsequent case law, Claimant’s alleged
investment does not meet the jurisdictional requirement under the ICSID Convention

because:

1. There is no substantial contribution in money or other assets, i.e. “a commitment of
resources” from Gambrinus. An investment must involve from the outset a
substantial trans-border flow of capital from the purported investor to the host state
(i.e. the contribution).>°° Gambrinus’ involvement was nothing more than ‘an
accounting exercise’ between affiliates of the same group.°°° Therefore, any alleged
contribution done by the Fertinitro shareholders, including Inv. Polar, prior to

Gambrinus’ involvement in the project is irrelevant.°°”

= The 2008 Capital Contribution Agreement, constitutes a “hypothetical call for

= Similarly, the know-how that Mr. Grossman and Gabaldén as Directors could
have brought to the Fertinitro Board was minimal an in any case cannot suffice
as a “contribution” for purposes of the ICSID Convention, as it has been

recognized by prior ICSID Tribunals.*”

"Finally, Gambrinus cannot attempt to differentiate itself from Inv. Polar for
purposes of establishing the nationality of the investors, while at the same time

trying to treat the two entities as just one for purposes of contribution.*!°

2. The transfer from Iny. Polar to Gambrinus did not involve any risk. Under the alleged
Share Transfer, Inv. Polar remained liable for the obligations and Project risks,*!!

5. Gambrinus investment was made fraudulently in breach of domestic law. Citing to
the Phoenix tribunal for support, it asserts that “States cannot be deemed to offer
access to the ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to investments made in violation
of their laws.”?!5 Respondent argues that the Share Transfer constituted a fraudulent
bid to bypass fundamental principles of domestic law and Claimant incurred a fraude

de ley,

Second, Gambrinus did not make an investment under the BIT. Under Article 1(a) of the
Venezuela-Barbados BIT, an investment is defined as “every kind of asset invested by
nationals or companies of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting

Party...” (emphasis added).

According to Respondent, the words “invested by,” was intentionally included and signifies
that for a valid investment to exist, an active contribution is required from the investor, in
contrast to a passive participation of mere ownership or control.>!° “This sets a higher
threshold than other BITs to which Venezuela is a party, such as [the BIT] with Canada,
which only require that an investment consist of assets ‘owned’ or ‘controlled’ by the

investor.3!7

reasons specified in paragraph 221.5 above.

b. Claimant’s Position

Respondent, as the party putting forward an affirmative defense, such as its objection to the
validity of Gambrinus’ title, bears the burden of substantiating its position through evidence.
The principle that the party who asserts must prove has been recognized by several ICSID

tribunals.>!°

Claimant also argues that there is no basis, either in the text of the JIA, or the Fertinitro By-
Laws (nor under Venezuelan or international law), for challenging the 24 January 2008
transfer of Fertinitro shares from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus. The transfer was made in good
faith, fully disclosed to all shareholders and accompanied by cash/cash equivalent
consideration namely, the obligation, assumed by Gambrinus at the time of the transfer, to

pay Inv. Polar the sum of USD 80,000,1 00.37

(i) The validity of the Share Transfer from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus

1. The modalities of the Share Transfer and alleged applicable
restrictions under the Founding Agreements
Respondent’s “new argument” that the January 2008 acquisition did not satisfy a “cash

equivalent” requirement of the JIA and Fertinitro By-Laws is meritless.

“Cash equivalent” encompasses “monetary obligations” and payments of a money
obligation, as articulated by both Parties’ legal experts, Mr. Rodner and Dr. Garcia.*?! The
cash equivalent criterion in Section 6.7(i) of the JIA and Article 14 of the By-Laws is

satisfied by payment in “money equivalent.”*””

318 Resp. Submission, $§ 55-58. Art. 2(1) of the BIT reads: “Each Contracting Party shall encourage and create
favorable conditions for nationals or companies of the Other Contracting Party to invest capital in its territory, and
subject to its right to exercise powers conferred by its laws, shall admit such capital.”

In January 2008, “to acquire the Fertinitro shares, Gambrinus undertook ‘an obligation to
pay [a] creditor a certain sum of money,’ i.e. a ‘money obligation’”>*? “for ‘money

equivalent’ which is also ‘cash equivalent.””>*4

Claimant agrees with Respondent that the January acquisition was a “set off’ in which
Gambrinus incurred debt to Inv. Polar in exchange of Fertinitro shares, and on 15 February
2008, Inv. Polar incurred debt to Gambrinus, in exchange of Gambrinus shares of the same
value. Relying on Mr. Rodner, Claimant further states that these debts were “set off’ against
each other; the transfer was thus conducted for “set off’ of money, i.e. two matching cash
equivalent obligations, satisfying cash equivalency.**> This “set off’ of two mutual cash

obligations was contemplated and authorized by the Venezuelan Civil Code.**°

In any case, the cash equivalency transfer requirement of the JIA and the Fertinitro
Companies’ By-laws, does not apply to inter-affiliate transfers.°?” According to Claimant,
“Venezuelan law eschews interpretation of a contract which are at odds with the intention of

the parties, ignores the contract as a whole, and ... would have absurd consequences.”*”*

Claimant also alleges that “there is no reason in law or logic, why inter-affiliate transfers
need to be subject to a ‘cash equivalency’ requirement, particularly given that the sole
commercial rationale for that requirement is to [give] effect [to] the right of [first] refusal

provisions in Sections 6.3 through 6.5."°29

Claimant further rebuts the reasons provided by Respondent for the “cash equivalent”
requirements as follows: First, it cannot be to provide solvency assurances of any new owner

and economic standing to participate in the Project, because the JIA mandates that prior

Garcia rely on it in his expert report. In any case, I[AS7 was an accounting standard adopted by Venezuela in 2008 and
therefore cannot inform the interpretation of “cash equivalency” as drafted in the 1998 JIA and Fertinitro Bylaws. In
any case, the cash equivalents in this transaction were offsetting cash obligations, not shares. Cl. PHB (II), {] 17.

shareholders guarantee the obligations of the new affiliate.°° Second, members of the same
group do not engage in protracted ownership struggles, and therefore there is no reason to
include a “cash equivalent” restriction to “limit potential disputes over ownership rights,” as

claimed by Respondent. *3!

According to Claimant, further proof of the parties’ intent lies in the fact that the range of
“Permitted Dispositions” in Section 6.2 include numerous scenarios in which it is literally
impossible to supply cash or cash equivalent payment of the kind urged by Venezuela and
still be fully compliant with Section 6.7. Such is the case, for example, of the share for share
exchanges between Pequiven and Venezuela’s state-owned investment fund or “VIE”

contemplated by Sections 6.2.1 and 2.1.1.3%

With regard to the alleged restrictions applicable under the By-Laws, Claimant answers that
the By-laws contain mirror requirements to the JIA and argues that Respondent fails to

mention relevant language of Articles 11 and 12 of the By-Laws.

This is further reinforced, according to Claimant, by the fact that neither the JIA, nor the By-
Laws require that the price set out for an inter-affiliate transfer be disclosed, nor is there a
requirement to disclose the kind or extent of the payment.*?? This is in contrast to third-

party transfers under Section 6.4 of the JIA.*™4

The absence of a disclosure of price requirement is the reason why Claimant and Inv. Polar
did not give information on the modality or the amount of the transfer price contained in the

Share Transfer Agreement. No bad faith or misrepresentation can be concluded from this.**°

Moreover, the 24 January 2008 email from Mr. Sim6én Guevara, Secretary of the Board of
Fertinitro, to each of the Owners, including Pequiven, confirmed that “after reviewing the

By-Laws and the pertinent Sections of the Joint Investors Agreement... we are of the opinion

that Inv. Polar ha[d] complied with all requirements to proceed to transfer its shares.” 36 The
email contains no mention of cash equivalency, nor of any other Owner, including Pequiven,
asking about cash equivalency since none of the parties expected or required, that cash

equivalent consideration be furnished. °°”

2. Gambrinus’ alleged acquisition of the Fertinitro shares

239. Claimant contends that Venezuela cannot dispute Gambrinus’ titles to the shares. Relying
on Mr. Rodner, Claimant asserts that, regardless of whether cash equivalence was applied or
satisfied, Claimant would retain its substantial shareholding,” as “failure to satisfy cash

equivalency does not, under Venezuelan law, lead to absolute nullity.”?8

240, In any case, Venezuela’s new argument cannot divest the Tribunal of jurisdiction under the
Treaty. According to Claimant, all of Respondent’s cited authorities involved objectively
grievous and knowing frauds, such as the “knowing and intentional breach” of criminal laws
or falsity in documents.**? Citing to the Metalpar tribunal, Claimant alleges that “divestment
of jurisdiction is an excessive sanction for even a mere technical legal error, if one
existed.”*“° According to Claimant, “the present dispute, concern(s) a highly technical
contractual provision raised at the eleventh hour, and then only to distort it” therefore it

cannot be compared to the authorities cited by Respondent.

241, Relying on Mr. Rodner, Gambrinus asserts that “no fundamental principle of morality,”

“public policy” or “illegality” is implicated here.*#!

(ii), Gambrinus’ alleged investment under the ICSID Convention and the BIT

242. According to Claimant, it remains unrebutted by Venezuela that this Project satisfies the
definition of investment included in Article 1(a) of the BIT, which defines investment

broadly, to include “shares and stock and debentures of a company.” Gambrinus held at all

material times, 10% of the outstanding shares in Fertinitro Oriente S.A. and Fertinitro
Oriente C.E.C. Therefore, Claimant’s equity ownership in an industrial facility, is a “clear-

cut investment.”342

Respondent’ belated argument that the term “invested by” incorporated in the BIT’s
definition of investment suggests that an “active contribution” is necessary, was raised for
the first time at the Hearing. In any case, it is without merits and has already been rejected

by the Mytilineos tribunal in connection with the Greece-Serbia BIT.*3

Claimant argues that by holding a “shareholding in a large industrial concern” Gambrinus
held a “classic form of an investment” and therefore recourse to the Sa/ini criteria “are not

required.”*4 In any case, the Salini criteria are met, because:

1. Claimant made a contribution to acquire Fertinitro shares through the January 2008
Share Purchase Agreement,**> as well as know-how, managerial experience through
Mr. Gabaldon and Mr. Grossman. *#° Moreover, Claimant contributed “by signing the
2008 Shareholder Additional Contribution Agreement, under which it committed to
provide certain pro rata capital infusions, to bolster Fertinitro’s bond ratings.”*4” In
addition, Gambrinus corporate predecessors and affiliates made substantial

contributions, which Claimant inherited.*“*

2. Claimant assumed risk because it directly assumed all rights and obligations of the JIA,
and entered into the 2008 Capital Contribution Agreement, obligating Gambrinus to
make fresh injections if the project under-performed and allowing it to receive
dividends.*4? “The mere fact that these contractual risks were subject to guarantees

made by Inv. Polar and Cerveceria Polar, does not diminish Gambrinus’ separate and

3. The contribution to the host state's development is not an independent factor in the
Salini analysis, as conceded by Respondent, but in any case, Fertinitro’s contribution

“ts obvious and incontestable.”*>!

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

245. In order for jurisdiction to exist under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and the BIT
Claimant must own an “investment” to be entitled to bring a claim against the host State.
Since this requirement is preliminary to any other conditions for jurisdiction ratione

materiae, it shall be examined first.

246. According to Respondent, Claimant failed to comply with the Joint Investors’ Agreement
and the Fertinitro By-Laws** (jointly referred to by it as the “Founding Agreements”) when
the purported transfer of shares was made in January 2008, the transfer being consequently
“null, void and of no force and effect.”**as it breached “essential restrictions agreed from
the outset” in the referenced Founding Agreements. Since Gambrinus never acquired
ownership of Fertinitro’s shares,** in Respondent’s view it has no standing before the

Tribunal and jurisdiction should be declined on this basis.>*°

247, Article VI of the JIA, regulating the transfer of Fertinitro’s shares, is applicable. It provides

as follows in Sections 6.1. and 6.2:

6.1. Restriction on Transfer. No Owner shall give, sell, assign, transfer,
pledge, hypothecate, mortgage, grant a security interest in, or otherwise dispose
of and/or encumber any of its interests or any interest therein (“Disposition”)

other than a Disposition permitted under Section 6.2 unless such Owner
complies with the provisions of this Article VI. Any Disposition attempted or
made without full compliance with this Article VI in its entirety shall be null,

6.2 Permitted Dispositions. The following Dispositions shall be permitted
without compliance with any other provision of this Article VI other than
Section 6.7:

6.2.1 by Pequiven to VIE as contemplated in Section 2.1.1;

6.2.2 by an Owner to an Affiliate of such Owner (including any Special
Purpose Subsidiary) if: (a) such Owner has provided at least thirty (30) days
written notice of such Disposition to the Company, Comandita and each of the
other Owners; [...] (d) the transferring Owner agrees, pursuant to instruments
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the non-transferring Owners,
to remain responsible with the Affiliate for Hi with all the
obligations of the transferring Owner under this Agreement, including
execution of a Parent Performance Agreement by any Parent Company of the
transferee, if applicable; and (e) the transferee Affiliate becomes a party to this
Agreement pursuant to the instruments in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the non-transferring Owners. [...]

 

248, According to Section 6.2, any Disposition is subject to the additional conditions of Section

6.7, which provides as follows:

6.7. Additional Interest_Transfer Requirements. Any Disposition of
Interests is subject to the satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

(i) Any Disposition shall be made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to
the exclusion of any other consideration;

Gi) Any Disposition must be for a Proportionate number of Shares and
Comandita Passive Shares;

(v) Any transferee of Interests, including an Affiliate of the transferor, shall, by
a written instrument executed and delivered to the Company and the Remaining
Owners before the Disposition is agreed to or concluded, (a) authorize, approve
and adopt this Agreement and assume all of the obligations of an Owner
hereunder as if it were an original, named, party hereto, including execution of
a Parent Performance Agreement by any Parent Company, if applicable, (b)
make representations and warranties substantially equivalent to those made by
Pequiven, Koch, Snamprogetti and Polar in Article III, and (c) provide an
address and facsimile number to the Company and the Owners for purposes of
Section 13.14.

Respondent refers to the By-Laws of Fertinitro Oriente S.A. assuming that the same
replicates the provisions of the JIA regarding share transfer restrictions.*°° Under the
Founding Agreements any share transfer, including to Affiliates, in order to be valid would
have to be made “exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other
consideration.” Contrary to this provision, according to Respondent the parties devised a
“share-for-share transaction” by which Gambrinus, instead of paying in cash or cash
equivalent for the shares in Fertinitro, issued further shares in itself to Inv. Polar in exchange
for the shares in Fertinitro,>>’ this share-for-share being recognised by Claimant as having

occurred. *58

According to Respondent, the detailed restrictions of the JIA regarding share transfers were
the result of careful drafting and analysis given the importance of the partners and their
identity, each of whom had been carefully selected to participate in the Fertinitro Project,
because they offered “strategic advantages.”>? Any attempted transfer in violation of the
restrictions of Article VI would be null, void and legally ineffective.> These restrictions
equally applied to a transfer of shares to an affiliate. Although a Permitted Disposition under
Section 6.2, a transfer to an affiliate would also be subject in any case to satisfaction of each
of the conditions of Section 6.7, including the requirement that “any Disposition shall be
made exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other considerations.”
According to Respondent, this condition would have assisted in ensuring, among other
things, the solvency and economic standing of the transferee, the transparency as to the value

of the disposition and the genuine character of the operation.**!

Claimant replies that there is no basis under the JIA or the Fertinitro By-Laws or international
law for challenging the January 24, 2008 transfer of shares from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus.*”
Claimant relies on the legal opinion of Mr. James Otis Rodner (the “Rodner Opinion”)
according to which the JIA cash requirement does not apply in case of inter-affiliate
transfers, the purpose of the requirement that the transfer be for cash or cash equivalents
being to facilitate the “right of first refusal regime” requiring a departing shareholder to offer
its interest to the other shareholders prior to sales to unaffiliated third parties.*® This right
requires for its exercise that the price at which the shares to be transferred are offered for
sale be stated in money and payable only in money. Since no such “right of first refusal,”
arises with respect to inter-affiliate transfers, there is no reason why the cash equivalency

requirement shall be applicable.**

According to the Rodner Opinion, to apply the cash equivalency requirement to any transfers
between affiliates would lead to the absurd result of disallowing various “Permitted
Dispositions” under Section 6.2, specifically inter-affiliate transfers pursuant to liquidation
or merger under Section 6.2.2 or a share-for-share transfer under Section 6.2.1 since these
Dispositions cannot be made “exclusively” for “cash equivalent consideration” as expressed
by Section 6.7(i) 3%

Claimant contends that Fertinitro By-Laws, far from being identical to the JIA as asserted
by Respondent,* actually state that inter-affiliate transfers may be made without complying
with “cash equivalents” requirement.*©” According to Claimant, under the 24 January 2008
Share Purchase Agreement, Gambrinus assumed the “obligation to pay the money sum of

USD 80,000,100.00 as payment for the shares in question” ** and the cash nature of this

obligation is not altered by it being later offset by matching a cash obligation assumed by

Inv. Polar under the 15 February 2008 Common Share Subscription Agreement.>”

According to the Rodner Opinion, under the Fertinitro By-Laws the cash equivalent
requirement under Article 14 for a shareholder’s sale of its shares, applies with the express
exclusion of the transactions mentioned in Article 12 regarding inter-affiliate transfers, such
as the transfer made from Inv. Polar to Gambrinus. According to the Rodner Opinion,
Article 12 provides that “the shareholders can sell ... transfer ... without the obligation of
compliance with the provisions of this Chapter (the reference is to Chapter III of the Charter)

... in case of... transfer by a shareholder in favor of an Affiliate.”>”°

The Rodner Opinion reminds that contracts in Venezuela, as in many civil law countries, are
interpreted taking into account the real intentions of the parties, avoiding absurd results and
looking at the contract as a whole, meaning by that that one must not read individual
provisions without relating them to the parties’ intentions when entering into the contract
and to the remaining clauses in the contract. Under civil law systems, this is a systemic
interpretation (“interpretacién sistemdtica”) where each clause in the contract, being a
logical part of an integrated system, is given meaning that is coherent with the contract as a

whole.>7!

. The Rodner Opinion adds that in civil law, including Venezuelan law, when the same parties

enter into several contracts that deal with the same subject, if there is a contradiction in the
terms used in both contracts, the language in the later contract prevails over the language in
the earlier contract. The later document in this case is the Fertinitro C.E.C. Charter, which
has a higher standing, the JIA having been entered into on 8 April 1998 while that Charter
was registered in the Mercantile Registry on 21 May 1998, after the date of the JIA.
According to the principle that the latest expression of the parties should be given prevailing

consideration, if, in relation to a particular requirement under both agreements, the terms of

the Fertinitro Charter differ from the terms in the JIA, the terms in the Fertinitro Charter

prevail over the terms in the JIA.*”

Respondent contends on its side that any provisions which are the product of the will of the
parties to a contract and which are not contrary to public order or good moral standards, shall
be deemed valid and of full force and effect between them, this being the case of the “cash
or cash equivalent” requirement. It adds that in light of the prevalence of the principle of
party autonomy, statutory provisions have merely a supplementary nature in relation to
contractual provisions.*”? Had the parties wished to exclude inter-affiliate transfers from the
“cash or cash equivalent” requirement, they could easily have done so, tribunals being not
supposed to rewrite the parties’ agreement by resorting to rules of interpretation that are
applicable in case of obscurity, ambiguities or deficiencies in the parties’ intention, which is

not the present case.>”4

Respondent contends further that the Fertinitro By-Laws may only give effect to the will of
the parties as reflected in the JIA which, as provided by Section 13.12, “may not be altered,
modified, amended or changed in any manner... except pursuant to a written agreement
executed and delivered by all of the Owners.” In any case, the By-Laws confirm that the
requirement of consideration in cash or cash equivalent applies “sin perjuicio de
cualesquiera otras previsiones” and applies to “cualquier transferencia 0 enajenacién de
acciones de la Sociedad.”*”° No evidence is given by Claimant as to why the cash equivalent
clause should be excluded in case of inter-affiliate transfers, Section 6.7 not dealing with
pre-emption rights so that situations of pre-emption cannot have been the reason for
including the cash or cash equivalent requirement.>”° Claimant failed to make any payment
of cash or cash equivalent consideration as required, the share-for-share set off being not a

“payment in any manner of representing money” according to the Rodner Opinion’s

interpretation, falling rather within “any other consideration,” which is specifically excluded

by the Founding Agreements.>””

It is Claimant’s position that the parties’ real intention regarding the precise scope of the
condition under Section 6.7(i) of the JIA that “[a]ny Disposition of Interest shall be made
exclusively for cash or cash equivalents to the exclusion of any other consideration” is made

uncertain by at least two reasons:

= The difference in the formulation of Article VI of the JIA and Chapter III of the
Fertinitro By-Laws regarding the applicability of the same condition to the transfer
of shares to Affiliates;*”*

= The fact that the application of this condition to any “Disposition of Interest” will
lead to the absurd result of disallowing various of the Permitted Dispositions under
Section 6.2.3”
Regarding the first of Claimant’s remarks, the Tribunal is asked to interpret the provisions
regulating the transfer of Fertinitro’s shares contained in an agreement governed by

0

Venezuelan law*®° in relation to the corresponding provisions of Fertinitro By-Laws

adopting a different formulation.

It should initially be mentioned that there is no prevalence of the Fertinitro By-Laws over
the text of the JIA. According to Section 2.1 of the JIA, “{t]he Owners acknowledge and
agree that each of the Charter / By-Laws, the Comandita Charter / By-Laws, the S.R.L.
Charter/ By-Laws and Operating Company Charter / By-Laws have been registered and shall
be modified, if necessary, to reflect the provisions of this Agreement.” Thus, it is rather for
the By-Laws of Fertinitro to reflect the terms of the JIA, not the contrary. To the extent the
terms of the By-Laws depart or conflict with the terms of the JIA, the terms of the latter

prevail.

263.

264.

The Tribunal notes that differently from Section 6.2 of the JIA which makes any Disposition
of shares, not excluding transfers to Affiliates, subject to the condition of a “cash or cash
equivalents” consideration under Section 6.7(i), no similar condition is apparently prescribed
by the Fertinitro By-Laws regarding transfers to Affiliates.**! Under Article 12 of the By-
Laws (entitled “Exception to the Restriction on Disposal and Encumbrance of Company
Shares”), the shareholders may transfer or confer rights on their shares without being obliged
to comply with the provisions of Chapter III (inclusive of Articles 11 to 15), “except where
provided for under paragraph three of clause thirteen,” in case (under B) of disposal of shares
to Affiliates. Paragraph three of Article 13, dealing with “Transfers to Third Parties,” is no
exception to the unconditioned disposal of shares to Affiliates under Article 12, considering

that transfers to Affiliates are not transfers to Third Parties.

Under Article 14 of the Fertinitro By-Laws, any transfer or disposal of shares in the
Company, to be valid, must meet the condition that “[t]he only compensation to be received
by the assignor-shareholder. .. shall be funds in cash (or an equivalent in foreign currency),
to the exclusion of all other compensation.” The reference made at the beginning of Article
14 to “any transfer or disposal of Company shares” includes, due to its generality, transfers
to Affiliates. This would be in conflict with the exemption of transfer to Affiliates from the
condition of payment in cash or cash equivalent under Article 12, However, the conflict is
removed by the starting language of Article 14, making its provisions applicable
“{nJotwithstanding any other provision contained in these Articles of Incorporation/ By-

Laws,” the reference to any other provision including Article 12.

The prevalence of Article 14 over the exemption of transfer to Affiliates under Article 12 is
confirmed by the last part of the same Article 14, providing (under B) that “{a]ny disposal
or transfer of Company shares must be carried out pursuant to the provisions contained in

the Agreement,” where “Agreement” cannot but refer to the JIA. Also under the By-Laws,

38! In examining the By-Laws the Tribunal shall follow the English translation provided by Claimant on 23 July 2014,
accepted by its decision of February 4, 2015. Respondent has declared not to accept Claimant’s translation of the By-
Laws in its communication of 11 February 2015: however, its translation of Article 14, used by Resp. Submission (ns.
22 and 23), conforms substantially to Claimant’s translation.

267.

therefore, transfers of shares to Affiliates are subject for their validity to the condition of

payment being made in cash or cash equivalents, as provided by Section 6.7(i) of the JIA.

Both Parties and their legal experts have made reference to the rules of contract interpretation
of Venezuelan law reaching however different conclusions.*** The Tribunal notes that

according to Article 12 of the Venezuelan Code of Civil Procedure,

En la interpretacién de contratos o actos que presenten oscuridad, ambigiiedad o
deficiencia, los jueces se atendran al proposito y a la intencién de las partes o de los
otorgantes, teniendo en mira las exigencias de la Ley, de la verdad y de la buena fe?
It does not believe that the situation confronting the Parties in the present case is
characterized by “oscuridad, ambigiiedad o deficiencia,” as required by Article 12 of the
Venezuelan Code to allow for the real intention of the parties to take precedence over the

contract language.

There is no “obscurity, ambiguity or deficiency” in the provisions of the JIA regulating the
transfer of shares, including with regard to the condition under Section 6.7(i) that any
transfer, not excluding transfers to Affiliates, “be made for cash or cash equivalents.” The
Tribunal is not supposed to modify the Parties’ agreement merely because one might believe
that requiring the application of this condition also in case of inter-affiliate transfers would
serve no useful purpose, particularly none of the purposes assigned by Respondent to this
condition,*** since any such transfer is subject in any case to the transferor’s guarantee to the

other shareholders for the transferee’s obligations.

Likewise, the Tribunal is not supposed to interpret the parties’ agreement under the JIA so
as to exclude that the condition of payment in cash or cash equivalent under Section 6.7(i)
apply to intra-affiliate transfers only because it is reasonable to think that the real purpose of
that condition is to permit the exercise of the right of first refusal of the other shareholders.
By the same token, the Tribunal should not rewrite the parties’ agreement because otherwise

the condition of a “cash or cash equivalent” consideration under Section 6.7(i) would not

permit implementing some of the Permitted Dispositions under Section 6.2 of the JIA. The
Tribunal’s appreciation of the real impact of that condition in those different cases is no

substitute for the parties’ free determination in that regard.

The condition that payment for the transfer of Fertinitro shares be made in cash or cash
equivalents applies therefore also to the transfer of shares to Gambrinus as an Affiliate of
Inv. Polar. The payment of the price for such transfer was agreed in the Share Purchase
Agreement in the sum of USD 80.000.100.00 which, as stated therein, “will be paid to THE
SELLER by THE BUYER at a future date following the granting of this document.” **5 It
formally conformed to the condition prescribed by the JIA for such payment, leading to
believe that Claimant was aware that this condition had to be complied with also for the
transfer to an Affiliate. The Tribunal is further comforted in its conclusion by the clear
statement of Inv. Polar itself in its letter of 21 January 2008 to the other investors stating that
the transfer of all its Fertinitro shares to Gambrinus would take place, “all in compliance
with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the Joint Investors’ Agreement and Section 12(b) of the

articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Commandita and the Company.”>*°

Before such payment would be made, however, the parties agreed under the Common Share
Subscription Agreement of 15 February 2008 to convert it into a share-for-share payment,
Gambrinus issuing shares in itself to Inv. Polar, the amount due by the latter for the newly
issued shares being set off against the same amount due by Gambrinus to Inv. Polar for the
transfer of Fertinitro’s shares.**’ The Tribunal agrees with Respondent that shares in
Gambrinus are not a cash equivalent as they are not “an immediately realizable liquid asset,”

Gambrinus not being traded publicly.>*

Respondent contends that it learnt of the share-for-share transfer to Gambrinus only during
the proceedings, Claimant having repeatedly represented that there had been a valid share

transfer to then admit, only in its Rejoinder of 17 January 2014, the nature of the transfer.**°

It adds that the purported share transfer was made in breach of the general principle under
Venezuela law of good faith, so that even if Gambrinus had actually acquired the ownership
of Fertinitro shares the transfer cannot be opposed against the other Owners or third parties,

Claimant being not entitled to claim the BIT protection due to its lack of good faith.>°°

Claimant denies having breached the good faith principle or made any misleading
representations or having concealed the true nature of the transaction, Gambrinus and Inv.
Polar having complied with Section 6.7 of the JIA considering how it was interpreted.*”! It
explains that the reference to a “December 12, 2007” share agreement in the Common Share
Subscription Agreement was the result of a clerical error so that it does not suggest that the
transfer was made in breach of good faith before consent was given by the other shareholders
on 22-23 January 2008.7

The Tribunal is of the view that the condition under Section 6.7(i) that any transfer of shares
be made for cash or cash equivalents was considered by the parties to the JIA to be an
essential element of the contract.” This is evidenced by the seriousness of the sanction that
had been agreed in case of breach of such condition, the “nullity” and the “no force or effect”

of the purported transfer.

The transfer of shares between Gambrinus and Inv. Polar made on 24 January 2008 under
the Share Purchase Agreement may not be given effect in the present case in view of the
breach of the agreed essential condition that the transfer be made for cash or cash
equivalents, the share-for-share consideration agreed in the Common Share Subscription

Agreement of 15 February 2008 being not equivalent to cash,

This conclusion dispenses the Tribunal from dealing with Respondent’s subordinate claim
whereby, since the investment was not made in good faith, it should in any case be denied
protection. For what may be of relevance in the present case, the Tribunal is of the view that

Claimant did not act in breach of the good faith, its conduct being rather motivated by an

erroneous interpretation of the relevant provisions of the JIA and the By-Laws. For that
reasons, there was no bad faith representation by Claimant to the other shareholders that the

transfer would comply with Sections 6.2.2 and 6.7 of the JIA.°%4

275. As confirmed by a recent ICSID award, “a tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to a dispute

between the host State and a national or company which has acquired its protected

investment before the alleged breach occurred.”*°> This holding, which follows a long series

396

of consistent investment treaty decisions,*”° is based on the principle whereby “the

substantive protections of the BIT apply to the State conduct that occurred after these

protections became applicable to the eligible investment.” °°”

276, Claimant’s claim in this arbitration is founded on Respondent’s expropriation of its

investment on October 10, 2010 in breach of Article 5 of the BIT? as well as on the breach
of the fair and equitable treatment of its investment under Article 2(2) of the BIT due to
Respondent’s expropriatory actions.°°? Claimant owned no investment at the time of the
alleged expropriation of Fertinitro shares on 10 October 2010, due to the Share Purchase
Agreement with Inv. Polar being of no force and effect.°° Having made no investment which
may fall within the BIT protection, Claimant’s claim is not subject to the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction which, accordingly, must be declined.

277. At the end of the analysis of jurisdiction ratione personae, the Tribunal indicated that it
would examine in the context of jurisdiction ratione materiae whether Gambrinus owns an
investment in Venezuela and, if so, whether it is a shell company having made no
contribution, as alleged by Respondent.*°! Having reached the conclusion that Claimant did

not own an investment in Venezuela at the time of the alleged BIT breaches, the Tribunal

has declined jurisdiction. Accordingly, there shall be no further analysis of the present case

by the Tribunal.

THE COSTS OF THE PROCEEDING

. The Parties filed simultaneous submissions on costs on 17 October 2014 and simultaneous

reply submissions on 31 October 2014.

In its submission Claimant contends that it should be awarded the totality of its arbitration
costs, including legal fees, experts’ fees, and other disbursements associated with this
arbitration, as well as its share of the costs of the Tribunal and the Centre, in the amount of

USD 7,817,562.63.

In its submissions Respondent argues that regardless of the outcome of this case Claimant’s
behaviour throughout this arbitration justifies its bearing all costs incurred in these
proceedings, i.e. its own costs as well as Respondent’s costs for a total amount of USD
7,607,586.24 (the share of ICSID costs, equal to USD 350,000, being provisional).
According to Respondent, the arbitration was unnecessary since negotiations with Pequiven
on compensation should have been maintained until their conclusion. Had Claimant
disclosed from the outset that the purported share transfer had been done in breach of the
relevant agreements Respondent would have been in a position to object initially to the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

. The fees and expenses of the Tribunal and ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses amount
to USD 731,432.65, divided as follows (in USD):4

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses:

Prof. Piero Bernardini USD 182,932.56
The Hon. Marc Lalonde USD 151,942.80
Professor Pierre-Marie Dupuy USD 170,613.69

285,

ICSID’s administrative fees: US$ 128,000.00
ICSID’s expenses(estimated):4” US$ 101,881.10

The Tribunal’s fees and expenses as well as ICSID’s administrative fees and expenses are
paid out of the advances made by the Parties. As a result, each Party’s share of the costs of
arbitration amounts to USD 365,716.32.4%

The Tribunal has the power to order costs under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention,

which provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees
and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.
It is recognized that in awarding costs the Tribunal enjoys broad discretion, subject to the
exercise of discretion being explained, as required by Article 48(3) of the ICSID Convention
providing that “(t]he award shall deal with every question submitted to the Tribunal, and

shall state the reasons upon which it is based.”4°5

The outcome of the case has been to some extent in each Party’s favour, the Tribunal having
rejected Respondent’s jurisdictional objections ratione personae and ratione temporis but
having accepted to decline jurisdiction, as requested by Respondent, due to Claimant’s lack

of title to an investment in Venezuela.

In view of the outcome of the case, the Tribunal considers appropriate that each Party bear
in full its own legal fees and costs and that the Parties equally share the fees and expenses of
the Tribunal and the costs of the ICSID facilities.

43 The amount includes estimated charges (courier, printing and copying) in respect of the dispatch of this Award.

44 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

VII. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION

286. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

1. The Centre has no jurisdiction and the Tribunal has no competence to hear

Claimant’s claims.

2. Each Party shall bear in full all legal fees and costs it has incurred and shall equally
share the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and the costs for the use of the facilities of the

Centre.
