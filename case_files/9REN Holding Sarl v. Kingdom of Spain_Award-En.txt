PART 1. OVERVIEW AND THE PARTIES

1. This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Energy Charter Treaty which

entered into force on 16 April 1998 as between Luxemburg and Spain (the “ECT” or “Treaty”)

 

and the Convention on the Settl of In Disputes States and Nationals of

Other States, which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention’).

2. This dispute relates to measures implemented by the Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain,
(the “Respondent” or “Spain” or the “Government”) which modified, to the disadvantage of the
Claimant and other producers, the regulatory and economic regime applicable to renewable energy

projects, and in particular, electricity produced by solar photovoltaic cells (“PV”).

3. The Claimant, 9REN Holding S.A.R.L. (the “Claimant” or “9REN”), is a renewable
energy company with headquarters in Luxembourg. It seeks compensation pursuant to the ECT
arising out of its investment in PV facilities in Spain, which it says, was induced by Spain’s
guarantee of a premium Feed-In Tariff (“FIT”) and related benefits irrevocable by Spain for the
life of the facilities. The promise, the Claimant argues, gave rise to reasonable and legitimate
expectations (and to other enforceable obligations under the ECT) that Spain would keep its word,

which, according to the Claimant, Spain failed to do.

4. In addition to the ECT’s “fair and equitable treatment” provision, the Claimant relies on
the ECT “impairment” clause, its “umbrella” clause and its prohibition against illegal

expropriation.
A. The Investment

5. The Claimant began investing in Spain in 2008 when it acquired a Spanish company,
Gamesa Solar, S.A. (“Gamesa Solar”), which was developing renewable energy facilities and
projects at various stages of completion, and a related engineering, procurement, and construction

business, among other associated investments.!

' See Giuliani First Witness Statement, paras. 16, 23-25.

6. Spain disputes the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on multiple grounds and contends that in
any event, as a responsible elected government, it took the disputed measures in furtherance of the
proportionate and rational exercise of its sovereign powers. The electricity market in Spain is a
regulated industry. The entitlement of the renewable energy investors was always limited by
Spanish law to a “reasonable return” on their invested capital and nothing more. Before, during

and after the “disputed measures” the Claimant received at least a reasonable return on its

investment.
B. Spain’s Renewable Energy Initiatives
7. The Claimant’s investment took place in the context of Spain’s ambitious program to

attract significant investment to build capacity in renewable energy during the mid-2000s. The
program, Spain says, was adopted to meet a mandate for renewable energy from the European
Union (“EU”) to increase rapidly the generation of energy from renewable sources including PV,”
solar facilities as well as wind and “mini-hydro” projects. The Claimant’s primary investments

were in PV facilities.

8. Following a number of relatively unsuccessful initiatives to attract foreign investment,
Spain, according to the Claimant, dramatically sweetened its offer in 2007. Royal Decree (“RD”)
661/2007, the Claimant says, held out to potential investors guaranteed premium rates for the
lifetime of their renewable energy facilities (adjusted for inflation during the initial 25 years and
thereafter at the rate of 80% of the premium tariff throughout the remaining life of the generating
facilities). This was followed by less generous, but equally irrevocable FIT benefits under RD
1578/2008. In the case of large PV plants (over 100 kW), Spain increased fixed tariff rates

around 82% in the 2007 reforms.?

9. According to the Claimant, the guarantees “promised” by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
were important to enable investors to obtain long term financing for their projects. Major capital

costs of renewable energy generators are overwhelmingly committed at the outset of a project,

? Photovoltaics are best known as a method for generating electric power by using solar cells to convert energy from
the sun into a flow of electrons. A typical photovoltaic system employs solar panels, each comprising a number of
solar cells.

3 See Expert Report Jaume Margarit dated 7 July 2016 (“Margarit First Expert Report”), p. 25; see also Exhibit C-
099.

and are thereafter “sunk” beyond recall. If, contrary to what actually happened, Spain had made
clear to potential investors that it retained the authority to modify unilaterally key features of
its FIT program for existing PV facilities to the detriment of investors (including modification
of tariff rates, the duration of the incentives period, operating hours and grid access), few

investors (and few bankers) would have found Spain’s proposal attractive.

10. In effect, according to the Claimant, RD 661/2007 and later RD 1578/2008 functioned as
the equivalent of a specific regulatory representation or offer open to potential investors. The
fixed tariffs (or market premiums) were spelled out in great detail and acceptance was open to
all investors whose facilities met Spain’s eligibility criteria and were registered before the
regulatory deadline Spain established. The arrangement was consummated when the investor
committed the capital to a facility that met the eligibility criteria by the applicable deadline and
obtained registration under the administrative process called “Registro Administrativo de
Instalaciones de Produccién de Régimen Especial’, known by its Spanish acronym as RAIPRE.
Spain’s registration of a renewable energy facility confirmed compliance of the project with the
terms of the regulatory offer. At that point, the Claimant says, Spain assumed the obligation under
the ECT not to reduce the RD 661/2007 and (later) RD 1578/2008 benefits. Subsequent
impoverishment of the FIT program may have been valid as a matter of Spanish domestic law, but
nevertheless, the Claimant contends, constituted a breach of Spain’s international treaty

obligations under the ECT and the breach entitles the Claimant to compensation.

Cc. Spain’s General Response is That the Claimant Made its Investment in the Context
of a “Dynamic” and Flexible Regulatory Scheme Which at all Relevant Times Limited
Investors in the Electricity Sector to a “Reasonable Return” on Invested Capital

11. In addition to its objection to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal, Spain contends that the
Claimant knowingly made its investment in a “dynamic” regulatory environment, (including the

Special Regime (“SR”) applicable to renewable energy) which was ever-evolving within the

following framework:

(a) subsidies to the Special Regime constituted a cost to the Spanish Electricity
System (“SES”), whose technical and economic sustainability constituted

paramount public policy;

(b) Special Regime remuneration had always been structured and based on “standard”
facilities, rewarded by the market price for electricity plus a subsidy, with the aim
of allowing renewable energy facilities to achieve no more than a reasonable

return in line with the return on capital placed in other low risk investments;

(c) the principle of reasonable return requires regulators to adjust rates as
circumstances change and such changeability was (or ought to have been) known

to the Claimant at the time of its investment had it performed due diligence;

(d) the various regulatory changes in FIT benefits in the period 2010 to 2014 were
undertaken either to (i) correct situations of excess profits to investors, or (ii) to
respond to the deterioration in the economic circumstances of Spain‘ including the
unforeseen and unforeseeable financial downturn in 2008/9, the consequent drop in
employment and economic activity, which led to reduced electricity demand and
an electricity “tariff deficit” which required Spain, as a responsible regulator, to
make adjustments in the FIT programs. The resulting modifications nevertheless
provided investors with a “reasonable rate of return” (as distinguished from excess

profits);

(e) the validity of Spain’s flexible and ever-evolving regulatory system has been
repeatedly affirmed by the Spanish Supreme Court both before and after the date

of the Claimant’s investment; and
(f) in short, the Claimant got exactly what it bargained for.
D. Did Spain Breach an Enforceable Undertaking?

12. The Claimant expresses the nub of its complaint as follows:

4 In 2010, when Spain adopted the first contested measures, and in 2012, prior to its adoption of the remaining
contested measures, windfall profits were evident and the growing accumulated tariff deficit, was unsustainable. Spain

as undergoing a profound economic crisis. The unemployment rate was at almost 20% in 2010 and it continued to
escalate up to around 25% in 2012. This had a negative effect on the electricity demand, which fell to levels that were
below its expected evolution: Econ One First Expert Report, p. 133, figure 38 (Spanish Electricity Demand 2000-
2012).

     

Thus, by early 2013, the pattern was clear: through nicks and scrapes,
Spain was steadily eroding the value of the incentives it had promised to
investors in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, just a few years after Spain
had reaped all the policy benefits of the newly-added renewable energy
capacity and once investors were effectively trapped into ownership of
assets with large up-front capital investments.*

13. More specifically, the Claimant notes that in a series of regulatory measures enacted
between 2010 and June 2014, the FIT scheme established by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
was dismantled and replaced by a new legislative and regulatory framework that required PV
and other renewable facilities to sell electricity on the wholesale market. The revenues from such
sales were supplemented by new “incentives”, to bridge the difference in cost of generating
renewable energy over conventional sources but the Claimant says these “new incentives” were
far less valuable than the previous incentives that Spain had (according to the Claimant)
“guaranteed” under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. The new regulatory regime was explicitly

made subject to ongoing and unilateral adjustment.
E. The Tribunal’s Conclusion

14. Despite Spain’s able and comprehensive argument, the Tribunal has unanimously

concluded for the reasons that follow that:

(a) the Tribunal is competent to hear and determine the Claimant’s claims against

Spain under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention and Article 26 of the ECT;

(b) Spain’s argument based on the proposition that the reduction in benefits was valid

at Spanish law provides no defence to the breach of its international obligations;

(c) under RD 661/2007 (but not RD 1578/2008), Spain generated legitimate
expectations under the FET standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT in terms of
international obligations that non-revocation of benefits was guaranteed in respect

of existing and registered renewable energy facilities. Such expectations were

(d)

induced by the clear and specific representation in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 as

follows:

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the deed
of commissioning shall have been granted prior to January | of the
second year following the year in which the revision shall have been
performed. (emphasis added)

 

RD 1578/2008 lacked the explicit grandfathering clause that RD 661/2007 provided
and in fact, as will be seen, explicitly contemplated ongoing review and potential

modification;

Spain’s generation of such expectations was made in the context of a concerted
drive to attract foreign and other investments which had not been attracted by the
earlier Spanish schemes which lacked equivalent benefits including any “stability”

guarantee;

viewing the text of RD 661/2007 in the context of Spain’s statements redoubling
its efforts to attract reluctant foreign investors, Spain created a reasonable and
legitimate expectation, upon which the Claimant reasonably relied, that Spain’s
promises of benefits under RD 661/2007 were irrevocable in respect of facilities

registered by a deadline unilaterally fixed by Spain at 29 September 2008;

the Claimant’s interpretation of the text of RD 661/2007 was confirmed at the time

it was issued by contemporaneous communiques authored by the Spanish cabinet;

Spain’s legislative roll-back violated its ECT obligations of fair and equitable

treatment under the FET standard in Article 10(1);

the Claimant has not established that its interest in renewable energy plants were

unlawfully expropriated in violation of Article 13 of the ECT; and

the Claimant has established its entitlement to compensation under the FET

standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT.

15. The Tribunal by a majority of its members assesses the quantum of such compensation at

€41.76 million as at 30 June 2014.

16. The Award of €41.76 million is to carry interest compounded annually at a rate equivalent

to the yield on Spanish Government 5-year bonds from 30 June 2014 to the date of payment.
17. The Claimant is entitled to its costs assessed at US$4,814,570 and €562,458.

18. In addition, the Tribunal assesses the arbitration costs payable by the Respondent at

US$299,908.16.
PART 2. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

19. On 31 March 2015, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration dated 30 March 2015 from
OREN against Spain (the “Request’”).

20. On 21 April 2015, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral
tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the

Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

21. The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be appointed

by each Party and the third, presiding arbitrator to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.

22. The Tribunal is composed of the Honourable Ian Binnie, C.C., Q.C., a national of Canada,
President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. David R. Haigh, Q.C., a national of Canada,
appointed by the Claimant; and Mr. V.V. Veeder, Q.C., a national of the United Kingdom,
appointed by the Respondent.

23. On 8 February 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules’), notified the Parties

that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore

deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Francisco Grob, ICSID Legal Counsel, was

designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

24, In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on 4 April 2016 by teleconference.

25. Following the first session, on 14 April 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision of the Tribunal on
disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules
would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural language would be English and
Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No. 1 also

sets out the procedural calendar for this proceeding.

corresponding translations on 29 November 2016.

28. On 17 November 2016, the Parties communicated to the Tribunal their agreement to extend
some deadlines for the document production phase. On 18 November 2016, the Tribunal took note

of the Parties’ agreement to extend deadlines.

29. On 16 January 2017, the Parties further agreed that both Parties would submit the Redfern
Schedule only in English. On the same date, each party filed a request for the Tribunal to decide

on production of documents.

30. On 2 February 2017, the Parties agreed to remove the requirement to provide to the
opposing party with hard copies of the exhibits when they submit their pleadings, therefore
amending section 13.3.2 of Procedural Order No. 1. On 9 February 2017, the Tribunal confirmed

the agreement of the Parties by letter.

31. On 3 February 2017, after hearing both Parties, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No.

2 on document production.

32. On 19 May 2017, the Claimant filed a Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on

Boaz Moselle and Dr. Dora Grunwald (FTI Consulting) with Exhibits BMDG-89 to BMDG-118,
Dr. Manuel Aragon Reyes and Mr. Jaume Margarit. On 20 June 2017, the Claimant filed the

corresponding translations.

33. On 22 July 2017, the Parties communicated to the Tribunal their agreement to extend the
deadline for the submission of the Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction
instead of 28 July 2017 to be 2 August 2017. On 24 July 2017, the Tribunal took note of the Parties’

Expert Report from Professor Pablo Pérez Tremps and Professor Marcos Vaquer Caballeria. The

Respondent filed the corresponding translations on 23 August 2017.

35. By letter dated 25 August 2017, the Centre informed the Tribunal and the Parties that Ms.
Catherine Kettlewell, ICSID Counsel, had been appointed as Secretary of the Tribunal in

replacement of Mr. Francisco Grob.

36. On 29 September 2017, the Claimant filed a Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“Claimant’s
Rejoinder”) together with Exhibits C-252 through C-270 and Legal Authorities CL-160 through

agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions of disputed matters regarding the organization of the

Hearing.

39. On 22 November 2017, the Respondent requested the Tribunal to introduce new relevant
documentation pursuant to Section 17.5 of Procedural Order No. 1. On 27 November 2017, the

Claimant commented on the Respondent’s request.

40. On 23 November 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 containing the agenda

and other procedural matters related to the Hearing.

Al. On 24 November 2017, the Claimant requested the addition of specific documents to the
record pursuant to Sections 16.3 and 17.5 of Procedural Order No. 1 and Section 30 of Procedural

45. During the Hearing, the Claimant submitted Exhibits C-271 to C-277, and the Respondent
submitted Exhibits R-334 to R-342. The Respondent also submitted an English translation of
Exhibit R-105.

46. On 11 December 2017, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the Parties that the sound

recordings and transcripts were available to the Parties in the sharing platform.

47. On 8 January 2018, the Respondent requested the introduction of two new legal authorities
into the record, Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. El Salvador, 1CSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on
the Respondent’s Jurisdictional Objections (1 June 2012) (“Pac Rim Decision’), and Bear Creek
Mining Corporation v. Republic of Peru, CSID Case No. ARB/14/2, Award (30 November 2017)
(“Bear Creek Award”). On 9 January 2018, the Tribunal decided as follows:

In light of the fact the two cases have already been discussed at some
length in the Respondent’s oral submissions on Day 5 of the hearing
without objection on the part of the Claimant, the Tribunal thinks it
appropriate to have before it the actual text of the decisions in Pac Rim
and Bear Creek. Accordingly, the Respondent is at liberty to add the two
decisions to its exhibits.

48. The Pac Rim Decision was introduced as Legal Authority RL-97 and the Bear Creek

Award was introduced into the record as Legal Authority RL-98.

49. On 18 January 2018, the Parties submitted the agreed corrections to the Hearing transcripts

in English.

50. On 19 January 2018, the Tribunal decided on a procedural calendar for the Parties’
simultaneous post-hearing brief submission, notification of reply, and reply. In its letter, the
Tribunal also invited the Parties to address certain issues and respond to questions. On 2 February
2018, the Tribunal amended the procedural calendar for the post-hearing submissions. On 6
February 2018, the Parties communicated to the Tribunal that they agreed that the post-hearing
brief and reply would be submitted in English only and proposed an extension to the deadlines
decided by the Tribunal. On 7 February 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the agreed extension to the
deadlines. On 23 March 2018, the Parties informed of a further extension to the deadlines which

the Tribunal confirmed on the same date.

51. The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 26 March 2018. On the same date,
the Respondent requested leave to introduce several legal authorities to the record. On 28 March

2018, the Tribunal granted leave to introduce the legal authorities RL-99 to RL-116.

52. On 19 April 2018, the Respondent notified the Tribunal, pursuant to the procedural
calendar as amended, that it would submit a Reply to Claimant’s Post-Hearing Submission. On 20
April 2018, the Claimant submitted its notification to the same effect. On 23 April 2018, the
Respondent objected to the late notification from the Claimant and, on the same date, the Claimant
responded to the objection. After further exchanges, the Tribunal decided that no prejudice had
been caused to the Respondent and rejected the Respondent’s request to strike the Claimant’s

Reply Post-Hearing Submission from the record.

53. The Parties filed simultaneous Reply post-hearing briefs on 23 April 2018.

54. On 5 June 2018, the Claimant requested the Tribunal for leave to add the Masdar v. Spain

award on which the parties submitted their respective comments on 29 June 2018.

55. On 18 June 2018, the Tribunal introduced into the record the Masdar v. Spain Award as
exhibit CL-192 and invited the Parties to simultaneously submit comments on the Masdar v. Spain

Award.

56. On 29 June 2018, the Parties submitted their respective comments on the Masdar v. Spain

Award. The Respondent’s comments were accompanied by Exhibits RL-117 to RL-121.

57. On 31 October 2018, the Centre received an Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-
Disputing Party in this proceeding from the European Commission dated 24 October 2018 (the
“EC Application”). On 1 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their
observations on the EC Application. On 8 November 2018, each Party filed its respective
observations to the EC Application. The Claimant’s comments were accompanied by Exhibits
CL-193 to CL-201 and the Respondent’s observations were accompanied by Exhibit RL-122. On
26 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 rejecting the EC Application.

58. On 23 November 2018, the Claimant requested that the Tribunal take note of the Foresight
Luxembourg Solar I Sarl, Greentech Energy Systems A/S and others v. Kingdom of Spain, SCC
Arb V 2015/150, Award of November 14, 2018 (“Foresight Award”), specifically on the decision
with respect to “fair and equitable treatment.” On 26 November 2018, the Respondent commented
on the Claimant’s communication on the Foresight Award. On 27 November 2018, the Tribunal
decided that it did not require any additional authorities or submissions at this point of the

proceeding.

59. On 21 December 2018, the Tribunal closed the proceeding pursuant to Arbitration Rule
38(1) and invited the Parties to file costs submissions which were simultaneously filed on 25

January 2019.

60. On 25 January 2019, the Respondent requested the Tribunal’s leave to reopen the

procedure pursuant to Rule 38 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules in order to introduce a new legal

14

authority and allow the Parties to comment. On 26 January 2019, the Tribunal invited the Claimant
to comment on the Respondent’s request. On 21 February 2019, the Tribunal decided that the
Respondent’s request did not meet the test under Rule 38(2) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules and

the request was therefore dismissed.

61. On 30 January 2019, the Respondent submitted comments to the Claimant’s Cost
Submission. On 31 January 2019, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to identify the provision of
Procedural Order No. 1 relied upon to file its comments on the Claimant’s Cost Submission. The
Respondent submitted a clarification on 1 February 2019. The Tribunal invited the Claimant to
submit comments on the Respondent’s Cost Submission. The Claimant submitted its comments

on 8 February 2019.

62. On 8 April 2019, the Tribunal communicated to the Parties that it had decided to extend
the 120 day period after the closure of the proceeding to draw up and sign the award by a further

60 day period in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 46.

PART 3. FUNDAMENTALS OF THE DISPUTE

63. The fundamental difference between the parties is the insistence by the Claimant on
restricting its focus to incentives provided by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 and related public
pronouncements by Spanish Government authorities, and the Respondent’s equal and opposite
insistence that those measures and pronouncements must be viewed in the broader historical and
regulatory context which entitled the Claimant to no more than a “reasonable rate of return” on its
investment. What constituted a “reasonable rate of return” is always to be assessed by Spain by

reference to “the cost of money in the capital market” as adjusted from time to time.

64. The Tribunal is therefore required to consider the “evolution” in Spain’s subsidies to
renewable energy facilities and to determine whether the Claimant’s entitlement was fixed (as it
claims) by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 or evolutionary and subject to diminution (as Spain

contends) in successive regulatory modifications between 2010 to 2014.

A. The Regulatory Framework

65. The general right of a host State to regulate sectors of its economy is undoubted. When an
investor enters a regulated industry, it cannot, in general, exclude the risk of legal or regulatory

changes. As stated by the tribunal in EDF v. Romania:

The idea that legitimate expectations, and therefore FET, imply the
stability of the legal and business framework, may not be correct if stated
in an overly-broad and unqualified formulation. The FET might then
mean the virtual freezing of the legal regulation of economic activities,
in contrast with the State’s normal regulatory power and the
evolutionary character of economic life. Except where specific promises
or representations are made by the State to the investor, the latter may not
rely on a bilateral investment treaty as a kind of insurance policy against
the risk of any changes in the host State's legal and economic framework.
Such expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable. (emphasis

added)
66. Spain sets energy policy through a variety of laws and regulations, including:
. Statute Law enacted by the legislature;
. Royal-Decree Laws enacted by the government, which have the force of law (but

may only be issued in cases of extraordinary and urgent need, and which the

legislature must validate within 30 days); and

. Regulations issued by the Council of Ministers, which cannot be contrary to any
Law. Regulations may be in the form of Royal Decrees issued by the Council

of Ministers, or Ministerial Orders issued by individual ministries.
B. The Regulators

67. The Ministry of Industry, Energy and Tourism (the “Ministry”) has primary
responsibility for the regulation of energy matters. Within the Ministry, the Secretary of State
for Energy (“Secretaria de Estado de Energia”) exercises specific responsibility for energy

policy.°The Ministry also houses the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of Electricity

— Organization Chart, as accessed on 4 March 2016, Exhibit C-022.

(known by the Spanish acronym “IDAE”), which is the repository of “subject-matter” expertise,
providing advice to policymakers on technical and economic issues and drafting legislation, etc.
The IDAE also functions as a liaison between the government and industry, with a mandate

(among other responsibilities) to promote investment in the renewable energy sector.’

68. At the same time, the Ministry of Economy and Competition housed an advisory agency
known from 1998 until 2013, as the National Energy Commission (“Comision Nacional de
Energia’) (known by the Spanish acronym “CNE”)® with oversight of competition in the market,
settlement of the regulated costs of the electricity system (including costs for renewable energy

facilities), and monitoring the technical compliance of both conventional and renewable power
9

  

facilities.

69. Additionally, the regional government in each Autonomous Community was competent

to authorize power generation facilities under SOMW in its territory.'°
Cc. Introduction of the Feed-In Tariff Premiums

70. In 1991, Spain’s National Energy Plan for the following decade (“PEN 1991”) made
express provisions for the development of renewable energy.''! The objective was to increase
greatly the share of total primary energy consumption from non-hydro renewable sources pursuant
to that objective, Spain enacted Royal Decree 2366/1994, which created what was called
“Special Regime” for electricity generated from renewable energy sources. The 1994
modifications introduced a FIT'? which compensates a producer at a fixed tariff rate for the

electricity that the producer “feeds” into the electricity grid.

71. However, RD 2366/1994 did not include any guarantee against downward adjustment of
the feed-in tariff. The tariffs were subject to discretionary adjustment by ministerial order.'> The

offer proved insufficient to attract the level of hoped-for investment.
D. The Development of European Community Policy

72. In 1994, the Declaration of Madrid established the principles incorporated in the
European Energy Charter, and called on the European Union to establish the goal that

renewable energy would satisfy 15% of the EU’s energy requirements by 2010.'*

723. In 1998, Spain agreed to ambitious targets, and later became subject to European Union

mandates to increase its share of energy produced from renewable sources.

E. A New Comprehensive Law Governing the Transmission and Distribution of
Electricity

74. In 1997, Spain enacted the Electricity Power Law (“Electricity Law 1997”) which
regulated activities in the electricity industry under which prices and compensation for services
were set by the government. At the same time, the Electricity Law 1997 liberalized electricity
generation and supply subject to a broad requirement that government incentives to producers
should provide “reasonable rates of return [in line with] the cost of money in the capital
markets.”!> Royal Decree 2818/1998 elaborated more specific details for the application of

Electricity Law 1997 to the Special Regime. !°

75. Again, however, the 1997/1998 sweeteners did not attract the desired level of investment.
According to the Claimant, the vague guarantee of a “reasonable” rate of return was deficient

because it exposed investors to the uncertainty of the regulators’ view of what return would be

“reasonable.” Moreover, there was no guarantee that future rate reductions would not be applied

retroactively to already-completed and registered facilities. !”
PART 4. THE FOUR STAGES OF THE SPANISH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS
76. Subsequent events can conveniently be described in four stages:

(a) the regulatory incentives prior to the Claimant’s investment;

(b) the regulatory incentives at the time of the Claimant’s investment;

(c) the regulatory modification stage (2010 to 2014);

(d) the New Regulatory Regime (2014).

77. The Claimant’s expert, FTI Consulting, provided the following chart to demonstrate the

timeline of the evolving regulatory regime:

(FTI Regulatory Report, para. 6.4 — Figure 6.1)

"7 Investors (and their financers) could only rely upon the generic clause contained in the Preamble of RD
2818/1998, which read that “for facilities based on renewable and waste energies, the incentive established has no
time limit placed on it because its environmental benefits need to be internalized and because its special characteristics
and technological standards entail higher costs that make such facilities unable to compete in a free market”, Exhibit
C-067.

19

A. Stage One: The Pre-Investment Stage

78. By 1997, it was evident that Spain’s strategies to attract more investment in renewable
energy projects were inadequate. Participants in the renewable energy industry were vocal in their
demands. In 2003, an association that represented over 500 Spanish renewable energy
companies, the Renewable Energies’ Producers Association (“Asociacién de Productores de
Energias Renovables” or “APPA”), published a report that, amongst other things, expressed what
the Claimant considers to have been the industry view that a vague guarantee of a “reasonable rate
of return,” where specific rates were subject to retroactive revision after the completion of

investments, did not provide sufficient certainty to attract investors. '*

79. On 1 April 2003, the CNE proposed that the Special Regime incentives!’ be amended to
be predictable throughout the facilities’ useful life. Any adjustment mechanisms were to be
both transparent and indexed to objective variables (e.g., the Consumer Price Index). Further,
the CNE concluded that any reviews or amendments to the incentive scheme should affect new
facilities only.”° Existing facilities would be grandfathered. Spain points out that the role of the

CNE was advisory only. The CNE did not make the rules.

80. In March 2004, Spain replaced RD 2818/1998 with a further new regulatory framework
for renewable energy in the form of RD 436/2004 which, amongst other things, specified that any

rate revisions would apply only to new facilities, and would “not have a backdated effect on any

previous tariffs and premiums.”?!

81. However, despite the sweetening of incentives, investment continued to lag. Even by 2006,

installed capacity of PV facilities amounted to just 84 MW, which was less than a quarter of

Spain’s target of 371 MW by 2010.” According to Spain’s Secretary General for Energy, Ignasi
Nieto Magaldi, it was necessary to raise further the incentive rates for renewable energy. He stated:
...[T]he premiums need to be revised upwards so that they meet the

targets. I think that we will comply with the 30 percent of renewable
energies in terms of electricity in 2010.

82. In February 2007, the CNE published a further advisory report affirming the following key

principles to govern a new regulatory regime:

. economic incentives must be recognized as an essential regulatory instrument to

reach the renewable energy targets set by the government;

. the regulation must offer the necessary guarantees of transparent, stable, and

predictable pricing of energy for the entire life of the facility;

. any modification of the economic regime must be applicable exclusively to new
facilities;
. new provisions may be applied retroactively only where transitional provisions

assured investors of compensation that is adequate in light of expectations generated

by earlier regulations;

. the next program should include greater efforts to promote the least developed
technologies contemplated in the Government’s targets (such as solar power). To
provide incentive for the development of those immature technologies such as
solar power, the feed-in tariffs should provide a return above what would

otherwise be considered reasonable.”

21

83. The Claimant contends that these CNE recommendations foreshadowed RD 661/2007 and

provide important background to its interpretation.
B. Stage Two: The Regulatory Environment at the Time of the Claimant’s Investment
(a) The New Incentives to Potential Investors

84. On 25 May 2007, Spain enacted fresh incentives in the form of RD 661/2007. The
improvement was dramatic, especially in PV facilities of over 100 kW, which established feed-in
tariffs for photovoltaic installations 82% greater than the rate previously offered in
RD 436/2004.?5 Of equal importance, according to the Claimant, the incentives were protected (or

“stable”) throughout the operating lives of the facilities.°°

85. The improved offer was sufficient to attract the Claimant, 9REN, which is a subsidiary of
First Reserve, a U.S.-based partnership which was founded in 1983 to invest in the energy
sector.” In the then view of First Reserve, the minimum return on equity that venture capital

would require to put money into renewable energy projects in Spain was in the range of 11-12%.?8

86. RD 661/2007 created upper and lower limits to the total compensation for producers
eligible under the FIT program, (i.e., the sum of the market price plus the premium) received

in payment for electricity.”?

87. The Claimant relies in particular on what it interprets to be a guarantee of “stability” or
non-revocation in respect of existing facilities, found in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 (mentioned

above) which (for ease of reference) provides as follows:

During the year 2010, in view of the results of the monitoring reports on
the degree of fulfillment of the Renewable Energies Plan (PER) 2005-
2010, and of the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy in Spain (E4),
together with such new targets as may be included in the subsequent
Renewable Energies Plan 2011-2020, there shall be a review of the

25 See Press Release for RD 661/2007, Exhibit C-099.

°6 As further explained below, RD 661/2007 set a base tariff that was guaranteed for an initial period (e.g., twenty-
five years for photovoltaic facilities) with a percentage of the base tariff (e.g., 80% for photovoltaic facilities) being
paid in remaining years throughout the operating life of the facility.

27 See Official Website of First Reserve — About www.firstreserve.com, last accessed 20 July 2016, Exhibit C-193;
Giuliani First Witness Statement, para. 5.

28 See First Reserve Presentation on Project Gasol, 17 December 2007, p. 8, Exhibit C-015.

29 See RD 661/2007, Preamble para. 8 and Article 36, Exhibit C-098.

tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower and upper limits defined in
this Royal Decree with regard to the costs associated with each of these
technologies, the degree of participation of the Special Regime in covering
the demand, and its impact on the technical and economic management of
the system, and a reasonable rate of profitability shall always be
guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in the capital markets.
Subsequently a further review shall be performed every four years,
maintaining the same criteria as previously.

The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower
limits [under premium option] indicated in this paragraph shall
not affect fi ies for which the deed of commissioning shall have
been granted prior to January 1 of the second year following the
year in which the revision shall have been performed.” (emphasis
added)

 

 

88. The Claimant contends that RD 661/2007 contemplated a “grandfathering” of benefits for
facilities registered (known as the deed of commissioning) before any authorized “revisions”.
Facilities not thereby “grandfathered” would be subject to the specified periodic revisions which
were to reflect a “reasonable” rate of profitability. Spain contends that the underlined words

“indicated in this section” limit the scope of irrevocability to the listed revisions.
89. Some commentators viewed RD 661/2007 as a new paradigm:

[With RD 661/2007,] the predictability and legal security of the economic
incentives are guaranteed. The right to receive economic incentives
(rates and premiums) is stated during the entire lifetime of the
installation, with annual updates tied to the variation in the CPI and with
modifications every four years that only affect new facilities. For this
reason, the Royal Decree possesses great value in regulatory stability.*!
(emphasis added)

90. Article 36 of RD 661/2007 set out fixed values and duration of the FIT:

% See RD 661/2007, Article 44, Exhibit C-098.

(See RD 661/2007, Art. 36, C-98)

91. Article 36 of RD 661/2007, the Claimant alleges, and the Respondent denies, thereby
confirmed a fixed duration for the fixed incentives granted to each type of renewable
facility.*? For PV facilities, the base fixed tariff (adjusted for inflation) was, the Claimant says,
guaranteed to remain in effect for twenty-five years, and thereafter (“a partir de entonces”) would
drop to 80% of the base tariff (adjusted for inflation) throughout the remaining life of the

projects.* The Claimant asserts that the productive life of its PV facilities would average 35 years.
(b) The Process of Registration of New Renewable Energy Facilities

92. Under Article 17 of RD 661/2007, registration under RAIPRE was a condition precedent

to entitlement:

The right to receive the regulated tariff, or if appropriate the premium,
shall be subject to final registration of the facility in the Register of
production facilities under the special regime...[i-e., the RAIPRE].*
(emphasis added)

93. With limited exceptions, the authority to authorize construction of facilities eligible

under the Special Regime, and then to bring the facilities within entitlement to the Special

Regime, was within the jurisdiction of the regional government in which the facility was

located.

94.

The right of a facility to be included in the Special Regime vested on the first day of

the month following the date of issuance of the Deed of Commissioning Certificate after final

registration in the RAIPRE.* The Claimant argues that registration constituted an additional

source of Spain’s obligation. Spain responds that registration was nothing more than a matter of

program administration.

(c)

95.

Impact of the 2007 Inducements

The installed capacity of PV projects reached 85% of the target in just four months.*’

Between 2006 and 2007, PV capacity increased almost 600%; from 2007 to 2008, that figure

* The procedure for inclusion in the Special Regime is set out in RD 661/2007 and consisted of several staged
steps, including:

. itting an lication to the authority that the operating and technical

characteristics of the planned facility met the requirements of one of the categories (or subcategories) eligible
under RD 661/2007 (e.g., a PV facility of 100 kW capacity);

* Obtaining permission from the transmission or distribution grid operator to connect to the grid;

* Providing a bank guarantee of €500/kW (for most projects) guaranteeing completion, which would be
released up on final commissioning of the facility;

* Obtaining an “Administrative Authorization” and “Approval of the Project for Execution of Works,” which
authorized construction to commence;

* Upon of obtaining a “Provisi C issioning Certificate” that
authorized functioning and performance tests necessary to obtain final commissioning of the facility. Upon
obtaining the Provisional Commissioning Certificate, facilities could obtain provisional registration with the
regional Administrative Registry for Special Regime Generation Facilities (the “RAIPRE”);

* After successfully completing functioning and performance tests, and upon submission of a works completion
certificate confirming that the facility complied with the approved Project for Execution of Works and
applicable regulations, the facility would obtain a “Final Commissioning Certificate,” along with final
registration in the RAIPRE. Achieving all prior steps was a prerequisite for the certificate of final registration
with the RAIPRE being issued. See RD 661/2007 Articles 6-13, Exhibit C-098.

 

 

 

 

   

  
  

 

 

36 See RD 661/2007, Article 14, Exhibit C-098.

57 According to the CNE, 91% of the target had been reached by 31 August 2007. As mentioned e.g. in Resolution
of 27 September 2007, of the General Secretariat of Energy establishing the deadline for the regulated tariff of
photovoltaic technology, pursuant to Article 22 of Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May, published in Spain’s Official
Gazette (BOE) No. 234 of 29 September 2007, Exhibit C-151.

increased by about 3,000%.** It was reported in the media that Spain accounted for half of the

solar power installed globally in 2008.*
(d) The Importance of Bank Financing in the Achievement of Spain’s Renewable Energy Goals

96. The Spanish government in PER 2005 anticipated that debt financing would provide
nearly 80% of the total capital investment needed to meet Spain’s objectives.*° Accordingly,
the ability to attract bank financing was an important objective if Spain was serious about attracting

the desired level of investment.

97. Following introduction of RD 661/2007, some banks offered financing on a non-recourse
basis (i.e., without personal guarantees from the equity investors). The Claimant says the banks’
willingness to do so pre-supposed that the revenues generated by the projects were expected by
the banks (who were sophisticated lenders) to be not only sufficient to repay the bank loans but
were stable, fixed and predictable.*! PER 2005 anticipated that the leverage ratios of project
finance to equity could be as high as 80:20.*? According to the Claimant, the “buy-in” of the

banks and other shrewd financial institutions shows that the sophisticated international financial

program, Spain’s photovoltaic sector had a total installed capacity of less than 5 MW. By 2006, however, the
installed capacity slightly exceeded 100 MW, and by the end of 2007, it had reached 690 MW. By 2008, PV

in this proceeding.

98. Spain announced on 27 September 2007, that RD 661/2007 would close to new
investments in PV projects one year later,*? i.e. new PV facilities would have to obtain final
registration under RAIPRE before 29 September 2008“ in order to be “grandfathered” under RD
661/2007.

(e) The Modified Regime (RD 1578/2008)

99. Spain enacted RD 1578/2008 on 26 September 2008, a few days before the cut-off date
for new PV projects under RD 661/2007. The new Royal Decree extended the FIT program
but in important aspects modified RD 661/2007.*> The premiums were reduced but nevertheless
remained significant to attract new photovoltaic facilities that missed the registration deadline of
29 September 2008.*° In respect of new investments,” (i) it established limited annual quotas of
power capacity that would be eligible for the feed-in-tariff, which gave Spain more control over
the number of facilities that would benefit from the new regime;** (ii) it offered lower feed-in

tariff rates; and (iii) granted Spain more flexibility to adjust the tariffs for new projects.”

The Claimant's Investment in PV Projects

As mentioned earlier, the cut-off date for registration under RD 661/2007 was 29

September 2008. The evidence establishes that the Claimant and its Spanish subsidiaries, Solaica

Power S.L.U. (“Solaica”) and 9REN Espaiia, constructed, commissioned and registered with the

RAIPRE seven PV projects before that date.*?

°° See Press Release for RD 1578/2008, Exhibit C-138.
5! Ibid.

* See RD 1578/2008, Article 11(5), Exhibit C-046.

°3 These seven projects were:

© Project El Soldado, which comprises of eight 100 kW PV facilities located in Cordoba. These plants
obtained their final registrations in the RAIPRE on 25 June 2008 (Certificate of final registration in
RAIPRE - El Soldado, 25 June 2008, Exhibit C-209);

© Project El Paso, which is composed of seven 100 kW PV plants located in Tenerife. These facilities
obtained their final registrations in the RAIPRE on 4 September 2008 (Certificate of final registration in
the RAIPRE — El Paso, 25 June 2008, Exhibit C-208);

104. The Claimant did some re-financing of these projects in 2009, with some corporate
restructuring, but in the result the investments were owned directly or indirectly by the Claimant
at the date of the RAIPRE registration and Deed of Commissioning as well as at the date of Spain’s

alleged violations of the ECT between 2010 and 2014.>+

105. In 2011, 9REN Espafia completed its eighth self-owned plant, Formiiiena, and
registered it under the RAIPRE on 23 March 2011.°° The Claimant acknowledges that due to the
late date of registration, the Formifiena facility was entitled to payment of the tariff established

under RD 1578/2008° not RD 661/2007.

Cc. Stage Three: Spain Reduces the Benefits Provided Under RD 661/2007 and RD
1578/2008

106. According to the Claimant, Spain enacted the measures said to violate its obligations under

the ECT commencing in November 2010.

  

Project La Gineta II, which comprises twenty-four 100 kW PV facilities located in Albacete. These plants
obtained their final registrations in the RAIPRE on 25 August 2008 (Certificate of final registration in the
RAIPRE - La Gineta II, 3 June 2008, Exhibit C-210);

Project Siruela, which is composed of twenty-four 100 kW PV plants located in Badajoz. These facilities

those five plants to Solaica, a Spanish company currently owned by the Luxembourg-based Solaica Power S.a.r.1.,
which in turn is wholly-owned by 9REN. Solaica then entered into a €69.5 million non-recourse facility agreement
with a bank consortium comprised of Natixis, Barclays, Lloyds, and Santander. Tr. Day 1 (Mr. Fleuriet), p. 68:5-

(a) Reducing the Period of Full Tariff Remuneration

107. In November 2010, Spain enacted RD 1565/2010, which terminated the right of PV

facilities to receive a guaranteed tariff after the twenty-fifth year of operation*” (later increased

to 30 years).**

(b) Limiting the Number of Paid Operating Hours

108. A few weeks later, on 23 December 2010, Spain enacted RDL 14/2010*° which limited
the annual operating hours for which PV facilities could receive feed-in tariffs.© The effect of
the “operating hours limit” was to reduce the total quantity of electricity for which investors’
facilities could receive RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 tariffs.°! Excess production would

simply be sold on the wholesale electricity market at lesser rates.

57 See Claimant’s Memorial, para. 246, citing RD 1565/2010 stated:

Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May, by which the activity of electricity production under the special regime

is regulated, the following modifications are made...Table 3 of Article 36, the values of the regulated tariffs

indicated for type b.1.1 facilities, from the twenty-sixth year are deleted. (emphasis added)
See RD 1565/2010, Article 1, Tenth (“Ten. In table En 3 of Article 36 [of RD 661/2007], the values of the feed-in
tariffs indicated for type b.1.1 facilities are removed as from the year twenty-six.”), Exhibit C-129. Subsequently,
Spain lengthened the period of time under which PV projects could receive the full tariff— first from 25 years
to 28 years, and finally to 30 years. The duration of the tariff became moot when Spain abolished the RD 661/2007
and RD 1578/2008 regimes in 2013.

remuneration rate under RD 661/2007 to year 30), Exhibit C-95.
°° See RDL 14/2010, Exhibit C-102. At the same time, Spain also enacted Royal Decree 14/2010, of 7 December
2010, regulating and modifying certain aspects relative to the activity of electricity generation from solar thermal and
wind technologies, published in the Official Gazette (BOE) No. 298 on 8 December 2010 (“RDL 14/2010”) which
contained similar provisions for wind and solar thermoelectric facilities. See also Exhibit C-75.
© RDL 14/2010, First additional dis ion, Exhibit C-102.
6! Margarit First Regulatory Report, para. 6.44 says that in the case of a | MW fixed-axis plant registered under RD
661/2007, the producer would only receive the feed-in tariff set out in RD 661/2007 for the first 1,250 MWh
of electricity produced, regardless of the plant’s actual production in a given year. Thus, if such a plant had
1,500 effective operating hours (i.e., it generated 1,500 MWh of electricity in a year), the plant would receive
the RD 661/2007 tariff for the first 1,250 MWh only, and would receive the much lower wholesale price for the
additional 250 MWh of electricity production. Wholesale prices in 2011-2013 were a very small fraction of the
guaranteed feed-in tariff. The impact of the effective hours limitation was greater on the most productive PV
facilities.

(c) Imposition of an “Access” Toll

109. RDL 14/2010 also created a new “access toll” of €0.5/MWh on all electricity that a
producer delivered into the grid.©? The Claimant argues that RD 661/2007 “guaranteed” producers
the right to deliver their entire net electricity production into the grid, and receive the tariffs
and other compensation provided by that law, without having to pay any such toll. That toll
thus effectively reduced the compensation which the Claimant says was guaranteed in the

original regulatory framework, and thus violated Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007.
(d) In Late 2012, Spain Imposed a 7% “Energy Tax”

110. On27 December 2011, Spain imposed a new 7% “tax” (the “TVPEE”) by Act 15/2012
on all revenue received from the generation of electricity. The Claimant contends that by design
and as applied, the 7% “energy tax” was not a tax in any meaningful sense of the word. It constituted

a straightforward 7% reduction in the tariff rates set out in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.
(e) In 2013, Spain Eliminated the “Objective” CPI Indexation

111. The base tariffs of the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were defined in eurocents per
kWh, and were indexed to the general Consumer Price Index (“CPI”). By RD 2/2013,
introduced an “‘amended CPI” that excluded price changes in food, energy products, and certain
tax effects from the calculation of inflation.® The Claimant contends that the effect of this
change was to reduce the inflation adjustment by about three percentage points (from +2.98%

to -0.03%).9

D. Stage Four: In 2013-2014, Spain Adopted a New Regulatory Regime and Abolished
the Previous Regulatory Incentives

112. On 14 July 2013, Spain enacted RDL 9/2013, which abolished the SR for renewable

energy that had governed the sector since 1994, including the feed-in tariff regimes set out in RD

661/2007 and RD 1578/2008." In its place, a New Regulatory Regime for renewable energy
facilities required facilities to sell electricity on the wholesale market. Spain supplemented that
revenue with “specific remuneration” based on the investment and operating costs of what Spain
regarded as a “standard” renewable energy facility, plus a rate of return tied to the historical
average yield of 10-year Spanish Government bonds plus 300 basis points. The precise details

of this new regime were not announced at that time.

113. In December 2013, Spain enacted Electricity Power Law 2013 (‘Electricity Law 2013’),
to address its expanding electricity “tariff deficit’® between the costs and revenues of the
regulated electricity system. The new law allowed Spain to defer “specific remuneration”
payments to renewable energy facilities in order to balance annual costs and revenues of the

system.

114. InJune 2014, Spain enacted RD 413/2014 (establishing the new regime) and Ministerial
Order IET/1045/2014 (establishing details of the new compensation formulae). The New
Regulatory Regime provided for an amount of “specific remuneration” (on top of market revenue)
to provide investors with a “reasonable rate of return” as calculated by the regulator for a
“standard installation.” The “specific remuneration” consisted of two components: (1) an
“investment incentive” calculated per MW of installed capacity to compensate investors for the
capital cost of their investment; and (2) an “operating incentive””’ designed to compensate
facilities for the gap between the operating costs of a renewable energy facility and the
wholesale price of electricity. The New Regulatory Regime set the initial target rate of
return (7.398%) based on the historical average yield of 10-year Spanish treasury bonds.

Periodic review would be made of the target rate of return based on the two-year historical

115. The Claimant says that as a result of the foregoing measures it has suffered loss, damages

and expense in respect of its entire Spanish investment in renewable energy including:
(a) eight Solaica PV Plants;
(b) three 9REN Espajia PV Plants.

PART 5. JURISDICTION

116. Itis convenient at the outset to deal with the basic requirements of ECT jurisdiction. Similar
requirements arise separately under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. However, the Tribunal
takes the view that if the Claimant can establish jurisdiction in this case under Article 26 of the
ECT, it would follow that the Claimant has also met the requirements of Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention. Hence, the latter requires no specific further consideration by the Tribunal for the

purpose of this Award.

117. Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty sets out the conditions precedent to the availability

of ECT arbitration as follows:

Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the
former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the former
under Part III shall, if [not] settled amicably...be submitted [to, inter alia,]
ICSID arbitration.

7! FTI Regulatory Report, para. 6.59.

? See testimony of Dr. Moselle, Amended Tr, Day 4, p. 134:11-23 (emphasis added):
..-when I said “clawback”, or we say “clawback”, we refer to the fact that rather than having a scheme which
says, “Starting here in 2013, we will ensure that from now on you earn a return of 7.398%”, the scheme says,
“We stand here in 2013, we will ensure that over your lifetime you will earn a return of 7.398%, and since in
our opinion you got paid more than that in the past, we're going to have to give you less in the future.
So it’s a clawback in the sense that the payments that the PV plants receive now are lower because the
government believes that the payments that they received prior to 2013 were, in that sense, excessive.

A. Was the Claimant “an Investor of Another Contracting State”?

118. Article 1(7) of the ECT provides that the term “investor” means “a company or other
organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.” The

domestic laws of each Contracting State determine nationality.”*

119. The Respondent acknowledges that Spain is a Contracting Party to the ECT” and a

Contracting State to the ICSID Convention.”

120. On 27 February 2008, prior to the incorporation of the Claimant, FR Solar Luxco S.a.r.1.
a subsidiary of First Reserve (the U.S. venture capital firm previously referred to) acquired the
Spanish company, Toler Inversiones 2007 S.L. (“Toler”) to serve as its acquisition vehicle in
Spain for renewable energy projects being developed by another Spanish company, Gamesa

Solar.”

121. Spain accepts” as authentic the purchase contract of 28 February 2008 for the shares of
Gamesa Solar by Toler but notes, at the same time, the prominent involvement in the acquisition

process of US personnel.

122. The shares in Toler were then transferred to FR Solar Luxco JVCo S.a.r.1. (“FR Solar
JVCo”) — 9REN’s Luxembourg-based parent company. The Claimant was incorporated as a

further subsidiary of the First Reserve group in Luxembourg on 26 March 2008. In December

73 Article 1(7) of the Energy Charter Treaty (“ECT”) defines Investor to mean (Exhibit C-001):

Contracting Party in accordance with its applicable law;
(ii) a company or other organization organized in d

2008, FR Solar JVCo transferred the investment in Spanish renewable energy projects to the

Claimant, 9REN.

123. In October 2008, the two Spanish companies, Gamesa Solar and Toler merged. Finally, on
2 December 2008, 9REN’s parent companies transferred to OREN the shares in the Spanish
company, which was renamed 9REN Espaiia. The result of this process was that on 2 December
2008, 9REN directly or indirectly owned 96.5% of the Spanish projects at issue in this arbitration.
(Ata later date, its interest in REN Espafia was reduced to 51% when the vendor’s loan provided

at the time of sale by Gamesa was converted into equity.)

125. Spain contends that 9REN is a “letterbox” company in Luxembourg which does no

substantial business activity in Luxembourg. The real investor, Spain argues, is the U.S. First

Reserve Group, which is not the Claimant and is not eligible to initiate an ECT arbitration. The

nominal Claimant, 9REN, lacking substance, is not the real investor.

126. For reasons addressed below in relation to the Article 17 (“the denial of benefits”)
objection, the Tribunal’s view is that the Claimant does substantive business in Luxembourg and

qualifies as “an investor of another contracting state’.
B. The Claimant Made a Qualifying Investment in Spain

127. On 23 April 2008, according to the Claimant, its investment of €211 million in Spanish
renewable energy projects assets was complete, as explained by one of its directors (and an officer

of First Reserve), Mr. Francisco Giuliani:

Q. There has been some discussion — or what I say “confusion” —- about
when the investment occurred. Can you expand on that?

A. Yes, it was interesting to hear that, and I may even understand the
rationale for the confusion. But the investment was made in April 2008,
period, full stop. There was no other money — not one cent — that was
invested after April 2008.

Just to be clear, it’s important to distinguish the multiple layers. The
Claimant, the company that I am representing today, and I was on the
board and I’m on the board of, made the investment in April 2008:
€211 million, just to be clear. €211 million. Then the company that we
acquired, Gamesa Solar, was a living organism, and that company
made investments.

So maybe when you see in FTI language that talks about the continuation
of the investment, it has to do with what Gamesa Solar, underneath our
investment, was making. But the investment of the Claimant was made
in one equity cheque that was invested in April 2008.’° (emphasis
added)

8 Tr. Day 2, Giuliani, p. 68:19-25 to 69:1-13. The Request for Arbitration recites that the total acquisition price was
€211 million, comprised of a cash payment of €116 million, a €60 million vendor loan granted by Gamesa Energia
S.A. (to mature after 4 years), and a €35 million deposit into an escrow account. Once the acquisition was complete,
First Reserve restructured and carried out share transfers that resulted in 9REN obtaining full ownership of the former
Gamesa Solar through 9REN’s holding company, 9REN Espaiia SL. (“9REN Espafia”). In October 2008, Gamesa
Solar merged into Toler. Finally, on 2 December 2008, 9REN’s parent companies transferred to 9 REN the resulting
company, which was renamed 9REN Espaiia.

 

36

128. The Tribunal accepts the evidence of Mr. Giuliani on that point. Accordingly, the Tribunal

is satisfied that at the material times the Claimant was “an investor of a contracting state’.
Cc. The Dispute Must Involve a Covered “Investment”

129. The definition of investment in ECT Article 1(6) is very broad.”? The Claimant lists a
number of different “investments” in the Spanish energy sector. *° Equally, the definition in Article
1(6) of the Treaty includes “every kind of asset owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an
investor” and includes both “tangible and intangible, and immovable property and any property

rights” as well as “any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences or permits.”*!

130. The Tribunal is satisfied that the dispute concerns a “covered investment”.
D. Both Parties Consented to ICSID Jurisdiction

131. 9REN consented to ICSID arbitration by filing a Request for Arbitration on 30 March
2015, as provided in ECT Article 26(4), which states:
In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution

[in international arbitration], the Investor shall further provide its
consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

   

7 ECT, Article 1(6) defines “investment”
(6) Investment means every kind of

leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges:

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a company

‘ollows (Exhibit C-001):
sset, owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor and

 

or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract having an economic value and
associated with an Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;

(e) returns;

(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences and permits granted pursuant to
law to undertake any Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.

   
     

(ii) the Claimant’ s and equity participation in Spanish companies and business enterpr
well as debt obligations; (iii) the Claimant’s right to returns, claims to money, and claims to performance pursuant
to contracts having economic value and related to the investments; (iv) rights conferred by law, including, but not
limited to, the rights to fixed feed-in tariffs conferred through RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008; and (v) rights
conferred by licenses and permits.

(a) (i) The International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes
. if the Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party to
the dispute are both parties to the ICSID Convention... (emphasis added)

132. Inits Request for Arbitration, 9REN affirmed in writing its consent to ICSID jurisdiction.**

133. The Claimant argues that Spain gave its “unconditional consent” to the submission of

this dispute to ICSID arbitration in Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT, which provides that:

subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party hereby
gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to
international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the provisions
of this Article.**

134. The exception does not apply and the Tribunal is satisfied that both parties have consented
to this arbitration (subject to resolution of Spain’s “additional” objections to jurisdiction discussed

below).

E. The Dispute Concerns a Legal Dispute Arising Directly out of an Investment and
Concerning an Alleged Breach of Part III of the ECT

135. The Claimant alleges that Spain breached firm commitments it made to 9REN in respect of

the Claimant’s investments in PV plants in Spain in violation of Article 10(1)** of the ECT which

82 Request for Arbitration, para. 59.

83 ECT, Article 26(3)(a), (Exhibit C-001). While that provision contains some limitations to consent, none of those

limitations are applicable in the present case.

84 ECT, Article 10, (Exhibit C-001): Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments:
(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in with the provisions of this Treaty, and create
stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions of Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to accord at all times to Investments of
Investors of other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the
most constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such
Investments be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international law, including treaty
obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.
(2) Each Contracting Party shall endeavor to accord to Investors of other Contracting Parties, as regards the
Making of Investments in its Area, the Treatment described in paragraph (3).
(3) For the purposes of this Article, “Treatment” means treatment accorded by a Contracting Party which is
no less favourable than that which it accords to its own Investors or to Investors of any other Contracting
Party or any third state, whichever is the most favourable.

(4)...

 

 

  
 

 

38

provides: 1) a requirement that Spain treat the Claimant’s investments fairly and equitably; 2)
a prohibition against unreasonable or discriminatory measures that impair the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investments; and 3) a requirement to observe any
obligations that Spain entered into with an investment or an investor. Article 13° of the ECT
protects the Claimant’s investments against unlawful expropriation and measures having
equivalent effect. The Tribunal therefore finds the dispute arises out of a covered investment in

respect of alleged breaches of the ECT.
136. The Claimant asserts, and Spain denies, that Spain violated each of those protections.
F. An Effort Was Made to Settle This Dispute Amicably

137. Before submitting a dispute to arbitration, Article 26 of the ECT contemplates that
disputing parties will endeavor to settle their disputes amicably.*° The Claimant argues that

compliance with this provision is not a jurisdictional prerequisite to arbitration. Nevertheless,

85 The ECT provides in Article 13, (Exhibit C-001):
Expropriation:
(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other Contracting Party shall not be
nationalized, expropriated or subjected to a measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalization
or expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “Expropriation”) except where such Expropriation
(a) for a purpose which is not in the public interest;
(b) not discriminatory;
(c) carried out under due process of law; and
(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation.
Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment expropriated at the time
immediately before the Expropriation or impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect
the value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the “Valuation Date”).
Such fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in a Freely Convertible Currency on
the basis of the market rate of exchange existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall
also include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of Expropriation until
the date of payment.
(2)...
SECT, Article 26, (Exhibit C-001). The Claimant’s contention is that the majority view of tribunals and commentators
considers such provisions to be procedural in nature, and thus subject to waiver or excuse in appropriate circumstances.
See e.g. Wena Hotels v. Egypt, ICSID Case No. ARB/98/4, Summary Minutes of the Session of the Tribunal, 25
May 1999, Exhibit CL-003 (the Tribunal noted that the respondent's jurisdictional objections based upon the
claimant's alleged noncompliance with a three-month waiting period imposed by the Egypt-United Kingdom
bilateral investment treaty would have served no useful purpose because “even if these procedural objections
were granted, they could have been easily rectified and would have had little practical effect other than to delay
the proceedings”); Campbell McLachlan et al., International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles para. 3.18
(2008), Exhibit CL-004 (explaining that “the majority of tribunals have not penalized claimants for failing to
observe these cooling-off periods”). As demonstrated above, however, this distinction is immaterial in this case
because the Claimant satisfied the requirement.

  

   

 

 

 

 

39

the Claimant sent a letter to Spain on 14 October 2014, notifying it of this dispute and offering
to settle the dispute amicably.*’ Spain did not respond to the Claimant’s letter. The Claimant filed

its Request for Arbitration with ICSID more than five months later on 30 March 2015.
PART 6. SPAIN’S ADDITIONAL OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION

138. Spain complains that the Claimant’s interpretation of the ECT is one-sidedly in favour of

investors and leaves out of account the legitimate interest of the host state:**

1052. Nonetheless, the Claimant sets out the violations of 10(1) ECT from
a single viewpoint, exclusively in favour of the investor. That is, after
referring to the objective and aim of the ECT, they claim that protection
for the investor is an absolute value, above the general interest needs of
the States. However, this theory is not admissible and has not been
admitted by any Precedent that has applied the ECT.

139. In this respect, Spain relies on the final award of the Electrabel case:*°

The host State is not required to elevate unconditionally the interests of
the foreign investor above all other considerations in every
circumstance...even assuming that Electrabel had an expectation that it
would be awarded the maximum compensation..., once weighed against
Hungary’s legitimate right to regulate in the public interest, such an
expectation does not appear reasonable or legitimate.*”

140. Spain relies on a similar point made in the Charanne v. Spain award:

...in the absence of a specific stability commitment, an investor cannot
have the legitimate expectation that a regulatory framework like the
one disputed in this arbitration would never be modified in order to
adapt it to market needs and the public interest.°!

141. Spain therefore raises a number of jurisdictional objections beyond the basic pre-requisites

to ECT jurisdiction:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

an ECT tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with an investment dispute where the
ECT contracting parties are both EU members’? [the ‘“Achmea’ issue].
Luxembourg, the “ostensible” country of the Claimant, and the Kingdom of Spain
are Member States of the EU. Article 26 of the ECT is not applicable to an intra-
EU dispute. The Claimant is therefore not a protected investor within the scope of

Article 26 of the ECT;

the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction rationae voluntatis. Spain exercised in its Counter-
Memorial its right to deny the Claimant the benefits of Part III of the ECT [the
“denial of benefits” issue]. The conditions precedent to Article 17 of the ECT have

therefore been fulfilled and the Tribunal is without authority to proceed;

the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because any claim for compensation in respect of the
photovoltaic plants belongs exclusively to the operating companies that directly
own the plants and the Claimant, as an upstream parent, does not fit in that category
[the “corporate payment” issue]. A parent company cannot claim a compensable
loss in respect of an asset owned by its subsidiary; at most it can claim a diminution
in share value, but the Claimant has not presented a case based on diminution of

share value;

the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to deal with an alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the
ECT related to the 7% Tax on the Value of the Production of Electrical Energy
(“TVPEE”) by Act 15/2012 of 27 December 2011 [the “TVPEE” issue]. Article
10 of the ECT denies remedies in respect of taxation measures of Contracting

Parties.

A. The EU Law and Membership Arguments

142. Spain relies on the recent decision of the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”) in Slovak
Republic v. Achmea BV,” which arose out of a bilateral treaty concluded between two EU Member
States. Spain concedes that the Achmea decision did not concern an international treaty such as the
ECT to which both non-members of the EU and the EU itself are also parties. However, Spain
contends that the reasoning behind Achmea is fully applicable because the effect of the ECT
arbitration clause as interpreted by the Claimant is to remove the dispute between an EU investor
and an EU Member State from the jurisdiction of their respective domestic courts and therefore
prevent those disputes from being resolved in a manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU

law.

143. | Both Luxembourg and Spain are members of the EU. Spain points out that the Claimant’s
investment was made (so far as Spain is concerned) pursuant to the framework of the Internal
Market in Electricity of the EU. Within this framework, Spain says, the EU system confers
particular protection upon the EU-national investor to the exclusion, Spain contends, of non-

EU dispute resolution mechanisms.

144.  Spain’s contention that an ECT tribunal has no jurisdiction to deal with the present dispute

by reason of the EU connection falls broadly into three areas of contention:

(a) the governing law argument: Spain contends that EU law governs the determination
by the Tribunal of its own jurisdiction under Article 26(6) of the ECT and Article
42(1) of the ICSID Convention;

(b) the institutional argument: EU law does not permit the existence of any institutional
dispute mechanism (including an ECT tribunal) other than an institution established

by the EU treaties to resolve their investment disputes;

(c) the application of EU law argument: the Tribunal has no jurisdiction under the BIT
or the ECT to apply EU law to determine the rights of intra-EU investors, including
alleged ECT violations arising from Spain’s participation in the EU Internal Market

in Electricity including rules governing State Aid. To do so would inevitably
infringe on the exclusive competence of the judicial system of the EU to interpret

EU law.
(a) Spain’s “Governing Law” Argument

145. Spain contends that Article 26 of the ECT requires the Tribunal to determine its jurisdiction

in this case on the basis of EU law.”°

146. In Spain’s view, the reference in Article 26(6) to the “applicable rules and principles of
international law” includes EU law, and indeed prioritizes EU law over other more general
principles of international law. However, as the tribunal in Vartenfall et al. v. Germany” pointed
out, Article 26(6) refers both to governance of the “issues in dispute” not jurisdiction and to Part
III (“Investment Promotion and Protection”) not Part V (“Dispute Resolution”).*” Equally, Article

42(1) of the ICSID Convention”® refers the decision of a “dispute” which, in context, refers to the

° ECT, Article 26, (Exhibit C-001):
(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party relating to an
Investment of the latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the
former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.
(2)...
QB)...
(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the
Investor shall further provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

 

 

(a)(i) The ational Centre for 1 of Disputes, i pursuant to the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes...
(5)...

(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance with this
Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law. (emphasis added)

substantive dispute between the parties, not a jurisdictional objection.” Although EU law,

comprised of and derived from treaties between EU Member States, is properly characterized as

international law,!

it does not displace the general rule of interpretation in Article 31(1) VCLT,
i.e., “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
given to the terms in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.” To the extent that EU
law may be “taken into account, together with the context” under Article 31(3)(c), it does not
displace the plain reading of Article 26 of the ECT because otherwise “the same words in the same
treaty provision may have a different meaning depending on the independent legal obligations
entered into by one State or another, and depending on the parties to a particular dispute. An ECT
dispute between an Australian claimant and Spain, for example, would be subject to different rules
than an ECT dispute between a German claimant and Spain. The need for coherence, and for a
single unified interpretation of each treaty provision, is reflected in the priority given to the text of

the treaty itself over other contextual elements under Article 31 VCLT.”!!
(b) The Tribunal’s Ruling on Spain’s “Governing Law” Argument

147. | The exclusion of intra-EU disputes from the scope of ECT would not be consistent with
the plain language of the ECT or the ICSID Convention.' Spain’s objection in this respect is

rejected.

(c) Spain’s EU Institutional Argument

148. The starting point of Spain’s institutional argument is that the decision of an ECT tribunal
is final (Article 53 of the ICSID Convention), subject only to the possibility of annulment by an
ad hoc committee. Such a committee does not belong to the judicial system of the EU.'
Accordingly, the ECJ judgment in Achmea precludes acceptance of jurisdiction by an ECT tribunal
because as an institution it is foreign to the EU and acceptance of jurisdiction would prevent the
ECJ from exercising its function “to ensure the full application of the EU law in all member States
and to ensure judicial protection of the rights of individuals under that law” through the provision
for a reference for a preliminary ruling established in Article 267 of the Treaty on the

Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”).'*

(d) The Claimant’s Response

149. The ECJ’s Achmea decision is irrelevant to the present dispute for four principal reasons.
First (and foremost), the tribunal’s jurisdiction is exclusively based on the express jurisdictional
provisions of the ECT. If a claimant satisfies those express provisions, that is the “end” of the
matter. Second, eighteen (18) investment treaty tribunals have rejected the “intra-EU” objection
to date — not a single treaty tribunal has ever accepted it — and the reasoning of those 18 treaty
tribunals in rejecting the objection is as applicable and persuasive today as it was prior to Achmea.
Third, even if Achmea were relevant to certain BIT disputes — which remains an open question —
Achmea is decidedly not relevant to this dispute under the ECT, to which the EU is a party. Indeed,
perhaps with the ECT in mind, the ECJ clearly differentiated the “intra-EU BIT” situation at issue
in Achmea from a situation involving a treaty to which the EU is a party. Fourth and finally,
Achmea’ s theoretical future impact (if any) upon a claimant’s ability to enforce an award in certain

EU jurisdictions is simply not a relevant concern for this Tribunal.
(e) The Tribunal’s Ruling on Spain’s EU Institutional Argument

150. The Tribunal has attempted, with the Parties’ assistance, to understand the truncated

reasoning in the ECJ’s decision in Achmea. There is much to understand. However, for this case,

03 ICSID Convention, Article 53; Respondent’s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 82.
'4 Respondent’ s Post-Hearing Brief, ,paras. 37, 82.2.

45

this Tribunal’s perspective as an international tribunal applying international law, together with
the terms and membership of the ECT, make it possible to address Spain’s arguments within a

relatively narrow compass.

151. Nonetheless, whilst the Tribunal has reached a consensus in rejecting Spain’s additional
objection to jurisdiction, it should not be assumed that it’s three members share equally the same

identical perspective or attach equal importance to the issues raised by the objection.

152. The ECJ’s decision in Achmea itself drew attention to the institutional difference between
a bilateral investment treaty between two EU member states and a multilateral international treaty
(such as the ECT) to which the EU itself as well as EU and non-EU states are parties. In joining
the ECT, the European Union (then the “European Communities”) itself agreed to submit to the
jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals under Part V (“Dispute Settlement”).'°° In Achmea, the ECJ
affirmed the treaty making authority of the EU to enter into treaties which include a dispute

resolution mechanism outside the framework of the EU courts. The ECJ stated in Achmea that:

It is true that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an international
agreement providing for the establishment of a court responsible for the
interpretation of its provisions and whose decisions are binding on the
institutions, including the Court of Justice, is not in principle incompatible
with EU law. The competence of the EU in the field of international
relations and its capacity to conclude international agreements
necessarily entail the power to submit to the decisions of a court which
is created or designated by such agreements as regards the
interpretation and application of their provisions, provided that the
autonomy of the EU and its legal order is respected...'°° (emphasis
added)

Spain notes that in this passage (in English), the ECJ refers to a “court which is created or
designated by such agreements.” It does not refer to “a tribunal”, i.e. an arbitration tribunal. It is
correct that in the language of the case (German), the ECJ’s judgment appears to refer to a court
(Gericht). In the Tribunal’s view, however, this is a distinction without a difference. The applicable

principle is the same.

105 See also the European Communities’ Statement under Article 26(3)(b)(ii) of the ECT as a Contracting Party to
the ECT.

106 Judgment of the European Court of Justice, Slovak Republic v. Achmea BV, Case C-2084/16, Decision, 6 March
2018, para. 57, Exhibit RL-100.

46

153. The ECJ itself thus recognized in Achmea that the EU enjoys no immunity in respect of
non-EU dispute resolution mechanisms under the international treaties to which the EU itself has
made itself a party, and may therefore be sued as a respondent in an ECT case. The ECJ’s
affirmation of the scope of the EU treaty making power in Achmea carries within it the rebuttal of
Spain’s position that EU laws exist in a bubble subject to interpretation and consideration only by

EU courts (and tribunals).

154. ECT membership of course includes countries remote from the EU including, for example,
Australia. Spain’s notion that within the remedial provisions of the ECT there are different
categories of members with different access to different remedies, and that EU members ought to
be considered to constitute a subset of countries with investor rights and remedies different to the
rights and remedies available generally to ECT arbitral parties, has no basis in the text of the ECT
itself or in the Achmea decision. Spain’s argument in this respect has been addressed in other
awards that pre-date Achmea'” in terms which are still applicable post-Achmea, and in decisions

subsequent to Achmea such as Masdar v. Spain and Vattenfall v. Germany.'°8

155. Disputes under a BIT between EU member states (to which the EU is not a party) is subject

to a different analysis as the ECJ noted:

107 See e.g. RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.A.R.L. v.
Kingdom of Spain, \CSID Case No. ARB/13/30, Decision on Jurisdiction, 6 June 2016, paras. 74-75, Exhibit CL-101:
[T]his Tribunal has been established by a specific treaty, the ECT, which binds both the EU and its Member
States on the one hand and non-EU States on the other hand. As for the latter, EU law is res inter alios acta
and it cannot be upheld that, by ratifying the ECT, those non-EU States have accepted that EU law as
prevailing over the ECT. The ECT is the ‘constitution’ of the Tribunal, and, to use the terminology of the
UNCITRAL tribunal in PV Investors v. Spain, [redacted]. This is what the Parties to the ECT agreed amongst

themselves, it is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to alter this.

Therefore, in case of any contradiction between the ECT and EU law, the Tribunal would have to insure the

full application of its ‘constitutional’ instrument, upon which i isdiction is founded. This conclusion is

all the more compelling given that Article 16 of the ECT expressly stipulates the relationship between the

ECT and other agreements — from which there is no reason to distinguish EU law. It follows from this that,

if there must be a ‘hierarchy’ between the norms to be applied by the Tribunal, it must be determined from

the perspective of public international law, not of EU law. Therefore, the ECT prevails over any other norm

(apart from those of ius cogens — but this is not an issue in the present case).

47

In the present case [Achmea], however, apart from the fact that the disputes
falling within the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal referred to in Article
8 of the BIT may relate to the interpretation both of that agreement and of
EU law, which was concluded not by the EU but by the Member
States.'°

156. EU member states are as much parties to the ECT as the EU itself and are entitled to invoke
the ECT dispute resolution provisions. As the Eiser tribunal pointed out:
[A]lthough the EU is a party to the ECT, EU Member States also remain

contracting parties to the ECT. Both the EU and [its] Member. ‘States can
have legal standing as respondents in a claim under the ECT.!

157. There is nothing in the Achmea decision that suggests the ECJ contemplated ECT claims
against the EU itself while at the same time (as Spain argues) immunizing from such claims EU
Member States. Spain is as firmly bound by the ECT dispute resolution mechanism as is the EU

itself.

158. For these reasons, the institutional objection to the jurisdiction of an ECT arbitral tribunal

in any dispute involving EU members is rejected.
if) Spain’s “Application of EU Law” Argument

159. The ECJ in Achmea held that “the autonomy of the EU and its legal order” must be

respected. |!!

160. Spain contends that an ECT tribunal, even if it would otherwise have jurisdiction, cannot
set itself up as an interpreter of EU law, which is the exclusive province of EU courts. Spain relies
on Article 26(6) which, it says, would require an ECT tribunal to apply EU law as a component of

“international law”:

48

(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles
of international law. (emphasis added)

 

161. Spain contends that this dispute is largely about EU law. The reference to “international

law” includes EU law. !!

Spain put in place its support scheme for renewable energy in compliance
with EU law not only with regard to the objectives established by the EU Directives, but also
subject to the limits provided for EU Guidelines on State Aid. Spain’s objection to jurisdiction
therefore invokes fundamental EU principles, it says, of the “freedom of establishment, freedom
to provide services, free movement of capital and free movement of workers of EU law.”!!?
Unavoidably this Tribunal, if it accepts jurisdiction, would be called on to interpret and apply EU
law in respect of the important EU regulatory regime governing State Aid pursuant to Article 107

of the TFEU.

162. Spain notes that the opinion of the EU Advocate General, while overtaken by the decision
of the ECJ in Achmea in some respects, nevertheless recognized that “neither Achmea nor the
Slovak Republic based their claims and defence on provisions of EU law.” In the present case,
Spain’s defence relates directly to subsidies to renewable energy facilities which are State Aid

under EU law.!!4
(g) The Claimant’s Response

163. Spain is wrong to attempt to circumvent the logic of the ECJ’s Achmea decision by
introducing EU law through a “back door” application of the ECT’s “governing law” provision in

Article 26(6). Spain’s attempt is misconceived. Multiple tribunals have held that the reference to

'2 Article 40 of the ICSID Report of the Executive Directors states that:

...the term “international law” as used in this context should be understood in the sense given to it by Article
38(1) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice, allowance being made for the fact that Article 38
was designed to apply to inter-State disputes.

The Statute’s definition includ

 

...international conventions, whether general or particular, establishing rules expressly recognized by the
contesting states.

Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 38.

114 Thid., para. 104.

113

49

“this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law” in Article 26(6) refers to

public international law, not regional law such as EU law (as interpreted by the ECJ).

164. This is necessarily so because the ECT is a multilateral instrument to which many non-EU
Member States are Contracting Parties. The drafters could not have intended the phrase “applicable
tules and principles of international law” to vary from one party to another. This would be the
result if Article 26(6) is interpreted as being subordinate to EU law, thereby distinguishing between
EU Member States and Non-EU Member States under the same provisions of the ECT. The result
would be the creation of different classes of members for which no textual basis is found in the
ECT. If the parties had intended such a differentiated and multi-categorized result, they would
have so specified in very clear terms. But as the Novenergia'"> tribunal observed, the parties to the

ECT did not do so.

165. The Claimant says it is worth noting that eighteen (18) investment treaty tribunals have
now rejected the “intra-EU” objection — not a single treaty tribunal it says, has ever accepted it.
On the other hand, numerous investment treaty tribunals have held that they are not tasked with

deciding the disputes before them on the basis of EU law.!!°

166. In any event, there is no need in this case for the Tribunal to address the EU law on State
Aid as neither the EU nor Spain regarded the RD 661/2007 regime as State Aid. Spain did not
notify the EU of the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 programs as would have been required if
Spain understood these measures to constitute “State Aid”.!'7 In the Tribunal’s view, Spain was
correct not to consider the incentives to be State Aid, as confirmed by a January 2008 report by
the EU itself. The EU was well aware of the Spanish incentives and indeed in 2010 EU officials
did not applaud but criticized Spain for its manner of reducing the incentive schemes provided by
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, a position which is entirely opposed to Spain’s position that

reductions in the FIT benefits were made to satisfy the EU. The EU officials wrote:

[T]he retroactive nature of [RDL 14/2010] has raised great preoccupation.
We wish to inform you of it and express our reserves in relation to these
measures. This should be no surprise, if you consider the indications that
the Commission made in prior occasions on that matter.

We do not question that the adjustment of the tariffs or the cost reductions
[in relation to] technical evolution might be justified or necessary.
Nevertheless, we are convinced that those adjustments need to be made
while thinking in the future, hence in a predictable manner, instead of
having a retroactive effect. It shall not be forgotten that negative
consequences for investors’ confidence of retroactive changes in the
economic conditions of a certain type of renewable facility may spread
and produce similar effects in other types of facilities and in other
countries, which may lead to a loss of confidence in the domestic and
European legislations concerning energy from renewable sources.'!*
(emphasis added)

167. Accordingly, the Claimant contends, Spain’s argument based on EU law is without

merit.!!°

"7 See extract from EC website presented by the Claimant in Closing Submissions at Slide 50:
EU State Aid control requires prior notification of all new aid measures to the Commission. Member States
must wait for the Commission’s decision before they can put the measure into effect. There are a few
exceptions to mandatory notification...”
The Claimant notes in its Slide 50 that Spain never notified the RD 661 or RD 1578 incentive schemes to the EC for
As to “why not”, the Claimant says that Spain did not consider those schemes to be “State Aid”.

Spain continues to achieve the highest growth rates in terms of the effectiveness indicator and at the same

generation costs due to good resource conditions on the hand and relatively low investment costs on the other.

(h) The Tribunal’s Ruling

168. The Claimant’s case does not rest on EU law. The Tribunal is not required to interpret and
apply EU law. The Claimant’s claims turn on the ECT and the jurisprudence of ECT tribunals and
decisions of the International Court of Justice (“ICJ’”) in respect of rights and obligations under
international law. Spain, on the other hand, does invoke EU law. Spain asks the Tribunal to
examine EU regulatory provisions dealing with State Aid both to justify Spain’s’ reduction of the
FIT benefits from and after 2010 as well as to support its contention that the Claimant knew or
ought to have known (had it exercised due diligence) that the Spanish subsidies were part of the

EU renewable energy scheme and thus subject to modification.

169. Spain says “there is no right to State Aid under EU law”.'?° However, the Claimant is not
asserting a right to State Aid under EU law. '7! Nor is the Tribunal deciding upon any such right
in this Award. The Claimant is asserting an entitlement to compensation for breach of Articles 10
and 13 of the ECT by reason not of the conduct of the EU but of the conduct of the Spanish State.
The status of Spain’s compliance with the EU law is, so far as the Claimant is concerned, res inter

alios acta.

170. As a matter of international law, the notion that EU law may be considered only by EU
judges is misconceived. In this case, the Tribunal, in the application of international law, may have
regard from time to time to national law (e.g. with respect to the Claimant’s corporate status) as
well as to EU law (e.g. Spain’s justification for its regulatory steps). International courts and
tribunals are frequently required to consider the laws of domestic or regional jurisdictions. Their
conclusions, of course, are not binding on the courts or tribunals of the home jurisdiction (in this
case, the EU and the ECJ). Nevertheless, consideration of “foreign” law may be essential to the
international law analysis where a party (in this case Spain) insists on its relevance. The award of
an ECT tribunal does not in any way represent a threat or challenge to the autonomy or authority

of the jurisdiction (or courts) where the “foreign” laws originated, in this case the EU and the ECJ.

20 Respondent’ s Post-Hearing Brief, para. 109.
121 Article 27 of the Vienna Convention (Exhibit CL-008):
“A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.”

52

171. At times, Spain portrays this case as an attack on Spain’s regulatory system whereas in fact
the claim only exists because of the way in which the Spanish regulatory systems was (apparently)
validly exercised to the detriment of the Claimant.' At the stage of a jurisdictional objection the
Tribunal is prepared to accept, arguendo, that Spain’s’ modifications of the FIT benefits in 2010
and the following years were permitted under both EU law and Spanish law. The Claimant is not
seeking to reverse the modifications to the FIT benefits. On the contrary, the changes in tariff and
modifications of the FIT benefits under Spanish domestic law is the legal basis for its ECT claim.
If the modifications to the regulations were not valid, the Claimant would more properly be

engaged in a Spanish court seeking their annulment.

172. The Tribunal therefore concludes that having properly taken jurisdiction to resolve this
dispute it is within that jurisdiction to consider EU law to the extent necessary for the resolution
of the dispute under international law. For the purpose of its decision on jurisdiction, the Tribunal
does not consider that EU law is materially incompatible with the applicable international law,
including the EU treaties and Article 26 of the ECT as to investor-State arbitration under the ICSID

Convention.

173. In summary, (i) the ECJ’s judgment in Achmea does not extend to the ECT, a multilateral
treaty to which both EU Member States and the EU are signatory parties, including (especially) Article
26 of the ECT; (ii) there was and is no material conflict between the ECT and EU law (including the
EU treaties, particularly the Treaty of the European Union (“TEU”) and TFEU); (iii) EU law does not
modify Spain’s obligations under the ECT, including Article 26 of the ECT; (iv) this Tribunal’s

jurisdiction and its exercise in the present case rests upon the ECT (with international law as the

'22 Spain draws the Tribunal’s attention to the decision of the Spanish Supreme Court of 3 December 2009 in rejecting

a challenge to the Transitory Provision of RD 661/2007, and confirming its previous case law:

there are no grounds for challenging Transitory provision one, section 4 of the RD contested, of infringing
the principle of legitimate expectations, given that the mercantile companies appealing, as companies that
operate in the electricity production business...do not have a right for the remunerative regime of the
electricity sector to remain unaltered...as we upheld in the judgement of this Chamber of Contentious-
Administrative Matters of the Supreme Court of 15 December 2005, “there is no legal obstacle to prevent the
Government, in the exercise of regulatory powers and broad entitlements that it has in such a strongly
regulated matter as electricity, from modifying a specific system of remuneration providing that this remains
within the framework established through the Electricity Sector Act.”

applicable law) and not EU law; and (v) this is an ICSID arbitration under the ICSID Convention

without a seat or legal place in any national jurisdiction, still less in any EU Member State.
B. Spain’s “Denial of Benefits” Objection (Article 17)

174. Spain objects to jurisdiction rationae voluntatis under Article 17 of the ECT. Spain
contends that the Claimant is a shell company - little more than a post-box in Luxembourg, and is

therefore not entitled to bring this claim!” under the ECT.
175. Article 17 of the ECT states, in relevant part:

Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of [Part
III of the ECT, regarding Investment Promotion and Protection] to:

(1) a legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such
entity and if that entity has no substantial business activities in the Area
of the Contracting Party in which it is organized.'4 (emphasis added)

(a) Spain’s Objection
176. Spain’s objection raises two distinct questions:
(a) when can Spain invoke this right?

(b) did 9REN have “substantial business activities” in Luxembourg at the material

times?

123 ECT, Article 17, (Exhibit C-001) provides as follows:
..-Non-application of Part III in certain circumstances” which states the following:
Each Contracting Party reserves the right to deny the advantages of this Part to:
1. A legal entity if citizens or nationals of a third state own or control such entity and if that entity has no
substantial busin ‘tivities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized; or
2. an Investment, if the denying Cc ing Party blishes that such S is an of an
Investor of a third state with or as to which the denying Contracting Party:
(a) does not maintain a diplomatic relationship, or
(b) adopts or maintains measures that:
(i) prohibit transactions with investors of that state, or
(ii) would be violated or circumvented if the benefits of this Part were accorded to Investors of that state
or to their Investments (emphasis added)
'24 Claimant’s Closing Argument, Slide 69, citing ECT, Article 17, Exhibit C-001.

  

 

  

54

177. Spain acknowledges that it did not “deny” benefits until delivery of its Counter-Memorial.
However, it argues that the belated timing of its objection does not present a problem. 9REN is a
legal entity controlled or possessed by citizens or nationals of a third-party country (the United
States).!?5 Luxembourg is simply a national flag of convenience. The Claimant “has no substantial

business activities in the Area of the Contracting Party in which it is organized.”!7°
(b) The Claimant’s Response

178. The Claimant contends that once (as here) a dispute emerges, Spain cannot retroactively
withdraw its consent nunc pro tunc, and relies on ECT case law disposing of the timing issues,

including the award of the /solux tribunal. The Claimant contends that:

[T]he solution is so obvious...the activation of the denial of benefits clause
can never function retroactively. As emphasized by the Arbitral Tribunal
in the case of [Stati] v. Kazakhstan in order to activate the denial of
benefits under Article 17 ECT, the notification of such denial must be
prior to the commencement of the dispute. In the case at hand, there is
no dispute that the Kingdom of Spain did not activate the denial of benefits
clause prior to its Statement of Defence, during the course of the
arbitration proceeding... As a result, the Tribunal reject[s] the
Respondent's jurisdictional objection...'”” (emphasis added)

179. Similarly, in Liman Caspian Oil v. Kazakhstan, the ICSID tribunal observed that “the
option of retroactive notifications would not be compatible with the object and purpose of the

EcT.”

!25 Respondent’ s Counter-Memorial, para. 136. Spain points out that the Claimant is 100% owned by the Luxembourg
company FR Solar Luxco JVCo S.C.A. which, in turn, is 99.4% owned by the Luxembourg company FR Solar Luxco
S.arl. which is 100% owned by the Cayman Islands entity FR XI Offshore AIV L.P. which is one of the Limited
Partners of the Limited Partnership into which First Reserve is organised, a US venture capital firm. Another First
Reserve affiliate is the General Partner is responsible for making decisions.

180. In this case, it is not necessary for the Tribunal to address the issue of timeliness. The
evidence is clear that 9REN carried on “substantial business operations” in Luxembourg. Mr.

Giuliani testified that:

OREN Holding has carried out normal business activities in Luxembourg
since its founding. 9REN has leased office space and has maintained at
least one locally-based employee in Luxembourg since July 2009. (REN
Holding has also maintained bank accounts there, since incorporation,
with ING Luxembourg. I understand that a sample of 9REN Holding’s
bank statements have been produced to Spain in partial response to this
allegation. Further 9REN Holdings pays taxes in Luxembourg.

In addition to those normal business activities, meetings of the boards of
OREN Holding and its Luxembourg parent companies are regularly held
in Luxembourg. All of the major decisions about the companies’
investments and their operations are made there. 9REN Holding currently
has six managers that serve on the board of directors, three of whom
permanently reside in Luxembourg, two of whom reside in London, and
one of who resides in Italy. Over the years, eighteen different directors
have served on 9REN Holding’s board, including nine directors based in
Luxembourg and six based elsewhere in Europe (including London, Spain
and Italy). In its history, only three of 9REN Holding’s directors were
based in the U.S.'”

181. The Claimant argues that such business activities in Luxembourg are not formalistic or

lacking in substance, citing in support Limited Liability Company Amto v. Ukraine:

The ECT does not contain a definition of “substantial” nor does the Final
Act of the European Energy Charter Conference that would serve as
guidance for interpretation. As stated above, the purpose of Article 17(1)
is to exclude from ECT protection investors which have adopted a
nationality of convenience. Accordingly, “substantial” in this context
means “of substance and not merely of form’. It does not mean “large”,

“Accepting the option of a retroactive notification would not be compatible with the object and purpose of
the ECT, which the Tribunal has to take into account according to Article 31(1) of the VCLT, and which the
ECT, in its Article 2, expressly identifies as “to promote long-term co-operation in the energy field” Such
long-term co-operation requires, and it also follows from the principle of legal certainty, that an investor must
be able to rely on the advantages under the ECT, as long as the host state has not explicitly invoked the right
to deny such advantages. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that Article 17(1) of the ECT does not have retroactive
effect.”

(c)

and the materiality not the magnitude of the business activity is the
decisive question.'*’ (emphasis added)

The Tribunal’s Ruling on Denial of Benefits

182. The test of substantial business activities must take its colour from the nature of the

business. Bricks and mortar are not of the essence of a holding company, which is typically pre-

occupied with paperwork, board meetings, bank accounts and cheque books. Accordingly, quite

apart from the timeliness issue, Spain has failed to establish that 9REN lacks substantial business

activities in Luxembourg. Article 17 of the ECT has no application to the facts of this case and the

“denial of benefits” objection is rejected.

c.

(a)

The Corporate Pyramid Objection - Spain Contends That if any Loss has Been
Suffered, it has Been Suffered by the Subsidiary Spanish Companies which Owned
and Operated the Facilities, not by the Claimant Who is a Mere Shareholder

Spain’s Objection

183. Spain argues that under orthodox corporate law, a corporation (in this case, the Claimant)

has no compensable interest in the assets of a subsidiary (in this case assets owned by REN

Espafia and its operating subsidiaries).!*! At most, 9REN can claim in respect of an alleged

130 Claimant’s Closing Argument, Slide 76, citing Limited Liability Company Amto v. Ukraine, Arbitration No.
080/2005, Final Award 26 March 2008, para. 69, Exhibit CL-048.
15! As stated in the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial:

In accordance with the above, in the present case, it must be concluded that the Claimant in this arbitration
lacks legal standing to claim for alleged damages to the assets (photovoltaic plants) of the companies that
own these plants and in whose capital the Claimant has a stake. (Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 187)

  

eR

 

The Claimant...attributes as his own supposed rights to receive incomes that do not correspond to him. It is
income that the photovoltaic plants will receive by virtue of the principle of reasonable return. The
shareholders in the companies that own the photovoltaic plants will receive a revenue, if the case, from their
investment through the distribution of profits if the companies are properly managed. Consequently, the
Claimant will receive the profits that, as a shareholder, correspond to him. (Respondent’s Counter-Memorial,
para. 195)
EER RR

...the Claimant is not entitled to claim for alleged damages to the photovoltaic plants that are the subject of
this arbitration, given that the legitimation for such claim corresponds exclusively to the companies that own
those plants, and who are not claimants in this arbitration. Hence, with all due respect, the Arbitral Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction to hear such dispute. (Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 204)

diminution in the value of its equity, but that is a different claim than the claim now presented to

the Tribunal.
(b) The Claimant’s Response

184. The Claimant’s loss is a direct function of the loss suffered by the operating companies and

has been appropriately discounted where appropriate to reflect its percentage shareholding.

185. The Claimant’s expert, Mr. Edwards of FTI Consultants, explicitly took into account the

indirect nature of the Claimant’s loss:

Thave been instructed to assess 9REN’s loss resulting from the diminution
in the value of its investments in the Solaica Plants and the 9REN Espajia
Plants caused by the Regulatory Changes on, or shortly after, the date the
details of the new regime were announced. !*? (emphasis added)

 

As did Spain’s expert, Dr. Flores:

This matter involves the shareholding interests of 9REN Holding S.a.r.1.
in a number of solar photovoltaic plants located in Spain. (emphasis
added)!**

 

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling on the Corporate Pyramid Issue

186. At the material times the Claimant was part of a foreign group of companies, and was the
immediate shareholder and beneficial owner directly or indirectly of a group of renewable energy
companies in Spain, including those at the operating level of electrical generation. Spain’s attempt
to deny jurisdiction on the basis of a common (if not almost universal) type of corporate structure,
where an actual financial loss to the operating subsidiaries necessarily causes loss of share value

to the owner (in this case the Claimant) has been consistently rejected by investor state tribunals.

187. Spain, of course, argues that the quantum of loss in respect of reduced share value is not

necessarily the same as the direct loss to the operating companies,'** but the Tribunal notes that

'32 FTI First Quantum Report, para. 1.18.
133 Econ One First Quantum Report, 7 November 2016, p. 1, para. 1.
14 Spain states in its Counter-Memorial at para. 205:

 

58

none of the valuation experts on either side retained to assess the Claimant’s loss considered the
corporate pyramid to impede their assessment of quantum. In this case, the experts were dealing
with wholly (or majority) owned subsidiary economically integrated into the parent company. The
experts collectively proceeded on the basis that the loss flowed thorough from the operating
companies to 9REN. The expert witnesses (including Spain’s expert, Dr. Flores) were instructed
by legal counsel to calculate the loss (if any) suffered by the Claimant not the loss of the
downstream operating companies, yet all experts proceeded on the common ground that the loss
to the operating companies equated (proportionately) to the loss in value of the Claimant’s

shareholding.

188. The Respondent’s “corporate pyramid” objection is misconceived and, with respect, is

rejected by the Tribunal.

D. The Tribunal Lacks Jurisdiction to Deal with an Alleged Breach of Article 10(1) of
the ECT in Respect of the TVPEE Tax

189. Spain challenges the Tribunal’s jurisdiction in respect of the Claimant’s claims arising out

of the TVPEE tax of 7% (Act 15/2012) on the production of electrical energy effective 1 January

2013. The 7% tax is sometimes referred to as a “levy”.
(a) Spain’s Objection

190. Spain submits that Article 21 of the ECT contains a general exclusion of taxation measures
from the scope of application of the ECT (the taxation “carve-out”) which only permits ECT

tribunals jurisdiction in the exceptional circumstances expressly stipulated in Article 21,'*> none

 

The jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal must be limited to hearing the dispute relating to alleged damages
caused to the Claimant in its shares or stakes in the capital of the companies that own the photovoltaic
plants.

135 ECT, Article 21 provides as follows (Exhibit C-001):
1. Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty shall create rights or impose
obligations with respect to Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any inconsistency
between this Article and any other provision of the Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the
inconsistency. (emphasis added)
2. ete.

59

of which exceptions are relevant to the case presented by the Claimant.'*° The Spanish courts have

upheld the validity of the TVPEE tax as a legislative measure properly characterized as a tax.

191. Spain acknowledges the TVPEE objection applies only to a FET claim under Article 10(1),
not to the illegal expropriation complaint under Article 13. However, in Spain’s view,
“expropriation” is irrelevant because there is enough excess fat in Spain’s renewable energy
subsidies to permit investors to pay TVPEE and still obtain a reasonable return. Moreover, Spain

contends, the regulations treat TVPEE as an expense reimbursable by Spain:

The impact of TVPEE in renewable energy producers such as the ones of
this arbitration has been neutralised, since the TVPEE is one of the costs
remunerated to such producers through the specific remuneration they
receive...That is to say, the specific remuneration received by renewable
producers allows them, in addition to obtaining a reasonable rate of return,
to recover certain costs which, unlike with the conventional technologies,
they cannot recover on the market. The TVPEE, precisely, is one of those
costs.!°7

(b) The Claimant’s Response

192. The levies imposed by Law 15/2012 do not correspond to the accepted criteria for what
constitutes a “tax”. The TVPEE simply reduces the incentive tariffs guaranteed under the FIT
program. This is clear from the fact that the “tax” applies to revenues not profits. Article 21 of the

ECT does not afford Spain any defence.

193. The Tribunal is required to look behind the “taxation” label at the actual purpose and effect
of the TVPEE which is confiscatory in its nature and, according to the expert testimony of Dr.
Boaz Moselle, discriminatory in its application as between renewable energy producers and

conventional producers. !*

36 Respondent’ s Counter-Memorial, para. 228.
'57 Respondent’ s Counter-Memorial, para. 860.
58 Dr. Moselle testified as follows:

 

“Spain introduced a 7% tax on the revenue from electricity generation, which applied to all types of plants,
but would, for reasons we could discuss, have a much more serious impact on solar PV than it would on
conventional plants. So, in brief, I would say that conventional plants could pass this tax through to their
customers, but solar PV plants were receiving a tariff from the government and had no ability to pass anything

60

194.

In its Reply Memorial, the Claimant lists the reasons why, in its view the TVPEE does not

meet the essential criteria of a “Taxation Measure” within the meaning of Article 21(1):

through. So it was

“Spain has wrongly disguised reductions to the incentive tariffs that is granted to
9REN’s plants as “taxes”, which Spain now uses to attempt to avoid liability under

the ECT.”!°

“While [TVPEE] purported to tax the value of electricity, it actually reduced the
value of the incentives that Spain granted to Claimant’s plants to induce their

development.” !4°

“Law 15/2012 also provided that the revenue raised from [TVPEE] would not flow
into the state treasury, like normal taxes would, but instead would flow into the
electricity system in order to reduce the tariff deficit. Thus, Law 15/2012 reduced
the incentives guaranteed to 9REN’s facilities so that electricity consumers could

pay less for electricity.”'#!

“[W]hile the domestic characterization of a disputed measure as a tax may be

helpful in ascertaining its nature, domestic law is not determinative.” 4?

“Under the Second Additional Provision of Law 15/2012, the amount Spain obtains
each year from the TVPEE does not raise general revenue for the state, as Spain
itself admits. According to that Provision, the annual General Budget Act of the
State earmarks an amount to finance the costs of the electricity system that is

equivalent to the sum of the annual revenue derived from the TVPEE.

simply a tax on them, and because their tariff was much higher, 7% of the large tariff is a

 

much bigger number than 7% of the market price.”

Consequently, the money Spain obtains from the TVPEE is syphoned into the

electricity system." !47

“[TVPEE] does not serve a general public purpose, but instead reduces the costs of
certain Spanish consumers in commercial transactions for the purchase of

electricity.” !4#

“Moreover, Law 15/2012 does not even advance its stated purpose of harmoniz[ing
Spain’s] tax system with more efficient, respectful, and sustainable use of the
environment with its purported goal of internationalizing environment costs arising
from the production of electricity. Spain’s suggestion that Law 15/2012 advances

these goals is laughable.”'4>

“Renewable plants received tariff revenue precisely because their total production
costs were higher than conventional plants. By applying the “tax” to all revenue
including incentive tariffs, and without deducting depreciation, renewable plants
paid a much higher “tax” on the same amount of electricity production than

conventional plants.” !4°

“By raising market prices, conventional energy producers are able to recover a
substantial proportion of their annual 7% payment directly from consumers. Under
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008, renewable energy producers could not raise

prices to recover the tax because their tariffs were fixed.”!4”

“In design and effect, these measures are not materially different from a
straightforward reduction of the tariffs that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008

guaranteed to Claimant’s plants.”!4*

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling on the TVPEE Tax Issue

195. Spain proceeds on the basis that TVPEE is a tax. The Claimant’s principal argument is that
TVPEE is not a tax. Period. While Masdar recently rejected an investor’s attack on TVPEE as part
of a series of measures imposed in bad faith that individually and collectively violate the ECT,
the Claimant 9REN picks up the prior question of whether the TVPEE satisfies the four
traditional tests of a “tax”, namely a levy established by law that imposes obligations on a
defined class of persons, generates revenues going to the State and these revenues are used for
public purposes. If established, these criteria would qualify the TVPEE as a ‘Taxation Measure’

under ECT Article 217)!” but, the Claimant argues, the criteria are not established.

196. The Claimant says Masdar did not explicitly consider the four “tax” requisites. However,
in the Tribunal’s view, the reality is that if the TVPEE levy was not an exercise of the State’s
taxing power there would have been no reason for the Masdar or Eiser Tribunals to go on to

consider if the taxing power had been abused.

197. In its commentary on Masdar dated June 29, 2018, the Claimant again made it clear that it
was not alleging against Spain either bad faith or an intent to abuse the taxation power. This aspect

of the Claimants’ tax argument is important and worth reproducing in full:

5. The Masdar tribunal also considered Spain’s objection based on the so-
called 7% “energy tax”. The tribunal found that it did not have jurisdiction
to decide whether the 7% “levy” breached the ECT, because the tribunal
was not willing to agree with Masdar that Spain’s motives behind the
measure were in bad faith. However, Claimant’s position as to why the
present Tribunal has jurisdiction to rule on its claims related to the
so-called 7% “energy tax” does not turn on Spain’s intentions and
does not require a finding of bad faith. Instead, it simply requires an
assessment of whether this measure has the characteristics needed to
fall within the meaning of “taxation measures” in ECT Article 21. No
tribunal to date has assessed the energy “levy” as a taxation measure
according to the three-prong test accepted by a long line of investment
treaty case law, as Claimant has requested. (emphasis added)

Masdar relies on the findings in Jsolux and Eiser, but those tribunals also
considered the allegedly improper motives and obscured purpose behind

63

the measures and did not apply the taxation measure “test” to determine
whether the measures were bona fide taxes in the first place.'*°

198. On the first branch of the test, there is no doubt that TVPEE was established by law. The
Spanish Supreme Court so held.'! While the Tribunal is not bound by the domestic court’s
characterization of TVPEE as a “taxation measure”,!** there is no reason to doubt the Spanish
Court’s conclusion that TVPEE met Spain’s constitutional requirements for the enactments of

valid legislation.

199. The raising of revenue for public purposes is an important function of State sovereignty.
(So important, obviously, that the ECT, as a matter of policy, excluded Taxation Measures from

ECT arbitral jurisdiction).

200. On the second branch of the test, TVPEE is imposed “on a defined group of persons”
namely producers who sell electricity to the SES. The power to tax includes the power to determine
who is to pay the tax and Spain was within its sovereign authority to render producers subject to

the tax on the sale of electricity to the State.

201. The Claimant objects that the tax is imposed on revenue rather than profits. In the
Tribunal’s view, there is nothing objectionable to a tax on revenue rather than profit. Multinational
corporations can structure themselves to allocate profits to different jurisdictions to suit their
corporate purposes, which may not align with the legitimate interest of the host country. Indeed in
the present case Dr. Flores, of Econ One, Spain’s quantum expert, testified that the corporate group
to which the Claimant belongs manipulated O&M costs to transfer profits within the group. The
current EU controversies over taxes paid (or not paid) by such multinationals as Amazon and
Google are testament to that concern. The Claimant does business in Spain and can expect to pay

tax there. TVPEE is no less a tax because it is a tax on revenue.

202. As to the third branch of the test, the revenues from TVPEE go to the Spanish State. As
Spain explained in its Counter Memorial an amount equivalent to the tax collected under Act
17/2012, including TVPEE, is afterwards appropriated by “the State General Budget” !>? to finance
the costs of the electricity system specifically relating to the promotion of renewable energy. The
Tribunal therefore rejects the Claimant’s assertion that “the [TWPEE] revenue would not flow into
the state treasury, like normal taxes would, but instead would flow into the electricity system.” '*+
The proceeds do flow to the State treasury and then (as is quite explicit in Act 15/2012) an
equivalent amount is appropriated by the State budget to a specific purpose, which is the normal
function of a budget, and there is nothing inherently improper or unusual in making a budget
appropriation in support of the electricity system. As to the Claimant’s suggestions that the
connection of TVPEE to renewable energy is “laughable”, the evidence is clear that the cost of the
electricity system to which the subvention is granted arose to a significant extent from Spain’s

commitment to renewable energy.

203. It is true, of course, that from the taxpayer’s point of view, Spain giveth in RD 661/2007
and in part Spain taketh away under Act 15/2012 and the net effect is reduced revenue to the
Claimant as taxpayer. Yet the Claimant has not demonstrated that (absent any allegation of bad
faith) reduction of the tariff deficit is not a “public purpose”. A tobacco tax may be directed to
funding health costs associated with smokers’ health issues. A fuel tax may be used to repair

highways. It is not the function of an ECT tribunal to micromanage Spain’s tax policy.

153 See Respondent’s Counter Memorial, paras. 295-296:
It is worth adding that the second additional provision of Act 15/2012 provides that an amount equivalent to
the estimated annual collection of the State arising from the taxes included in Act 15/2012, among which is
the TVPEE, will be allocated each year in the Spanish General State Budgets Acts to finance the costs of the
electricity sector:
“Additional provision two. Costs of the electricity system.
In the General State Budgets Acts of each year an amount equivalent to the sum of the following will be
used to finance the costs of the electricity system provided for in Article 13 of the Electricity Sector Act:
a)The estimate of the annual collection derived from taxations and fees included in this Act.
b)The estimated revenue from the auctioning of emission rights for greenhouse gases, with a maximum
of €500 million. (emphasis added)
errr
...the fifth additional provision of Act 17/2012 ... establishes that an amount equivalent to the estimated
annual collection arising from the taxes included in Act 15/2012, among which is the TVPEE, will be
allocated to finance, among the costs of the electricity system provided by the Electricity Sector Act,
specifically those relating to the promotion of renewable energy...”

54 Claimant’s Reply, para. 116.

204. The argument that TVPEE is not a tax because in practice it may fall differently on
taxpayers who can pass on the cost (in whole or in part) to their customers, whereas other taxpayers
cannot, is not persuasive. It is well known and commonly understood that a tax may sometimes be
absorbed (voluntarily or otherwise) by the taxpayer on which it is levied, in which case it operates
as a direct tax, or passed on to a third party, in which case it operates as an indirect tax. Absent

bad faith, variation in the incidence of a tax does not mean it is not a tax.

205. In effect, the Claimant contends that it was guaranteed RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
benefits free of tax, but there is no basis for that position in RD 661/2007 or RD 1578/2008, and
so far as the ECT is concerned, Article 21 manifests a deliberate policy decision not to limit a

State’s taxation power in this way.

206. To take acommon example, old age pensioners may be granted a statutory right to a fixed
sum of money but, absent a legislative exemption, the amount will usually be subject to taxation.
Persons in a high tax bracket may not keep much of the old age pension to which by law they are
entitled to receive (and do receive), just as the Claimant’s operating companies are entitled to
receive and do receive revenue from the sale of their electricity to the SES but the receipt is not

free of tax.

207. Inshort, TVPEE is a tax and in the absence of any allegation (let alone demonstration) of
bad faith, Article 21 withdraws the TVPEE issue from the Tribunal’s consideration. On this point,
the Tribunal agrees with the conclusion of the ICSID tribunal in Eiser!® (in a passage also adopted

by the Masdar tribunal) as follows:

270. The power to tax is a core sovereign power that should not be
questioned lightly. The ECT Article 21(1) tax ‘carve-out’ and the
corresponding provisions in many other bilateral and multilateral
investment treaties reflect States’ determination that tax matters not
become a subject of investor-State arbitration, save perhaps in carefully
limited circumstances. (ECT Article 21(5)(a) thus allows claims for
expropriation effected through taxation, but subject to limiting procedures
requiring consideration of the claim by national tax authorities.) The
present case does not on the facts reach a situation where the tax
enforcement measures are found to have been used as part of a
pattern of behavior aimed at destroying Claimants and therefore the

ARB/13/36, Award, 4 May 2017, paras. 266, 270-271, Exhibit CL-158.

66

Tribunal does not reach a view on the availability of such an exception,
were such a case to be made out.

271. The Tribunal cannot disregard the ECT’s clear terms on the
strength of the record here, which falls well short of demonstrating
any improper or abusive use of the power to tax. The Tribunal therefore
finds that it does not have jurisdiction to decide Claimants’ claim with
respect to the alleged inconsistency of the TVPEE with Spain’s obligations
under Article 10(1) of the ECT. (emphasis added)

This Tribunal agrees with Eiser and Masdar!* in this respect.

208. Whether or not, taken with other measures, the TVPEE tax amounted to expropriation
requires an analysis of TVPEE in the context of the other measures complained of by the Claimant.
This is an analysis that will be further undertaken in the discussion of the allegation of illegal

expropriation contrary to Article 13 of the ECT.
PART 7. LIABILITY FOR BREACH OF ECT OBLIGATIONS
209. For ease of reference, Article 10(1) provides as follows:

Article 10: Promotion, Protection and Treatment of Investments

(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions of Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to
accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contacting Parties
fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most
constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way
impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. In no case shall such Investments
be accorded treatment less favourable than that required by international
law, including treaty obligations. Each Contracting Party shall observe any
obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an
Investor of any other Contracting Party. (emphasis added)

210. Furthermore, Article 13 of the ECT provides as follows:

186 As the Masdar tribunal stated:

Nonetheless, the Tribunal does not consider that the circumstances of the introduction of the Levy could be
said to reach the high bar set by the c: in which a tribunal has concluded that the conduct of a State is such
as to merit the loss of the benefit of the Article 21(1) “carve out”.

67

   

Article 13: Expropriation

(1) Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other
Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to a
measure or measures having effect equivalent to nationalisation or
expropriation (hereinafter referred to as “Expropriation”) except where
such Expropriation is:

(a) for a purpose which is in the public interest;

(b) not discriminatory;

(c) carried out under due process of law; and

(d) accompanied by the payment of prompt, adequate and

effective compensation.

Such compensation shall amount to the fair market value of the Investment
expropriated at the time immediately before the Expropriation or
impending Expropriation became known in such a way as to affect the
value of the Investment (hereinafter referred to as the “Valuation Date’).

Such fair market value shall at the request of the Investor be expressed in
a Freely Convertible Currency on the basis of the market rate of exchange
existing for that currency on the Valuation Date. Compensation shall also
include interest at a commercial rate established on a market basis from
the date of Expropriation until the date of payment.

(2) The Investor affected shall have a right to prompt review, under the
law of the Contracting Party making the Expropriation, by a judicial or
other competent and independent authority of that Contracting Party, of its
case, of the valuation of its Investment, and of the payment of
compensation, in accordance with the principles set out in paragraph (1).

(3) For the avoidance of doubt, Expropriation shall include situations
where a Contracting Party expropriates the assets of a company or
enterprise in its Area in which an Investor of any other Contracting Party
has an Investment, including through the ownership of shares.

The Claimant relies on the ECT’s Article 10 “fair and equitable treatment” provision; it’s

“impairment” clause; its “umbrella” clause; and the ECT’s Article 13 prohibition against illegal

PART 7(1). VIOLATION OF THE FAIR AND EQUITABLE STANDARD

The fundamental controversy between the parties is whether under international law Spain
did indeed owe, as the Claimant contends but Spain denies, an irrevocable obligation to the

Claimant to pay the feed-in tariff established by RD 661/2007 for 25 years and thereafter at 80%

of the original base rate for the life of the facility.

68

213. The Claimant also claims irrevocable benefits under RD 1578/2008 but, as earlier stated,
RD 1578/2008 is somewhat differently structured'*’ and as counsel for Spain noted, the Fifth
Additional Provision of RD 1578/2008 expressly warned investors of the possibility that
remuneration to existing PV facilities could be modified.'°* The Claimant points out (somewhat
weakly) that RD 1578/2008 did not explicitly state that it did not grandfather the benefits to

registered facilities. However, there is no obligation on Spain to meet such a reverse onus.

214. The threshold issue is whether the facts of this case are capable of giving rise to the
legitimate expectation asserted by the Claimant that the benefits set out in RD 661/2007 were

irrevocable within the scope of the ECT’s FET standard. Spain points out that:

...the ECT is not a kind of insurance policy in favour of the investor
against the risk of changes in the regulatory framework, and therefore:

a) It is necessary to have specific commitments made to an investor that
the regulation in force is going to remain immutable. This was declared in
the Plama Case and ratified by other precedents of the ECT, such as the
AES Summit, EDF and Charanne Cases.

b) The investor’s Expectations must be reasonable and justified in relation
to any changes in the laws of the host country. This requires an assessment
of the “background of information that the investor knew and should
reasonably have known at the time of the investment and of the conduct
of the host State”.!*°

‘57 The most relevant portions of RD 1578/2008 provided as follows (Exhibit CL-046):
Article 2. This royal decree will apply to facilities of the group b.1.1 [solar PV facilities] of Article 2 of Royal
Decree 661/2007, of 25 May 2008, [that is to those] photovoltaic facilities that obtained definitive registration
after 29 September 2008 in the Administrative Registry of Electricity Power Generation Facilities of the
Energy Policy and Mines General Department.
Article 11(5). The applicable regulated tariff applicable to a facility, in accordance with this royal decree,
shall be maintained for a maximum duration of twenty-five years, as from the latest of the two following
dates: the date of commissioning, or the date of the registration of the facility in the Compensation Pre-
Allocation Registry. Such compensation shall never applicable prior to the date of such registration.
Article 12: The rates provided in Article 11 shall be updated as provided in Article 11 shall be updated as
provided in Article 44.1 of Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 May [ICP], for subgroup b..1.1 facilities, as from
1 January, of the second year subsequent to the notice in which they are fixed.

158 RD 1578/2008 provided in part as follows:
Fifth additional provision. Amendment to the Retribution of the Activity Electricity Generation from
Photovoltaic Technology.
In the course of 2012, in light of the technological developments in the sector and in the market, and of the
performance of the remunerative framework, the compensation for electricity power generation with solar
photovoltaic technology, may be amended.

 
   

  

'59 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 1108.

215. Spain’s view that the legitimacy of the expectation must focus on a particular investor, and
the need for specific undertaking to that investor, is not shared by UNCTAD which in 2012
reported that:

Arbitral decisions suggest in this regard that an investor may derive

legitimate expectations either from (a) specific commitments addressed to

it personally, for example, in the form of a stabilization clause, or (b) rules

that are not specifically addressed to a particular investor but which are

put in place with a specific aim to induce foreign investments and on

which the foreign investor relied in making his investment. (emphasis
added)!

216. The Claimant argues that Spain's “clear commitments in its legislative and regulatory
framework”, the “well-known purposes and motivations” of its RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
regimes, the manner in which those regimes “specifically addressed the concerns of PV investors
(based on the significant upfront costs of PV installations)”, Spain's need to aggressively promote
PV and other renewable energy investments to meet its EU commitments and domestic policy
goals, and the “clear, repeated statements and conduct” of Spanish officials concerning the “total
legal certainty” and other features of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 all gave rise to legitimate
expectations on the part of Claimant that it would continue to benefit from the 2007/2008 feed-in

tariffs for the periods specified in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.
A. The Claimant’s Argument on the Facts

217. The Claimant contends that once Spain enrolled a photovoltaic plant into the RD 661/2007
and RD 1578/2008 programs, the tariff benefits were fixed according to their terms. There was no
provision that permitted Spain to refuse to pay the full, guaranteed value of those tariffs for

all of the electricity the plants produced.

218. In particular, the Claimant contends that:

160 UNCTAD, Fair and Equitable Treatment (2012), n 263, p. 69, Exhibit CL-148.

70

(a)

(b)

(c)

the terms of RD 661/2007 were clear in offering a stable pricing mechanism of
tariff rates over the full operating life of a facility (one rate for the first twenty-five
years of operation and a reduced rate thereafter); '°!

Spain needed significant renewable energy investments to ensure that it would
meet binding EU targets for renewable energy, as well as to reduce its
dependence on non-renewable and foreign energy sources. The fundamental
purpose and basic logic of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 required the stable

and predictable nature of the promised tariffs;

in the PV sector, upfront costs of constructing a facility are significant, and thus
both investors and their lenders needed to have security that those costs would be
recovered (and the facility would thereafter generate a profit). Spain knew this well,
the Claimant argues, as its officials publicly stated that the best legal framework

to encourage investments “are [those] most predictable and stable and best

‘61 The Claimant contends that the guarantee was explicit in the legal framework and relies on the following chart in
respect of “b.1.1.” facilities (PV facilities), which was incorporated into RD 661/2007, Article 36, Table 3, Exhibit C-

The Claimant contends that RD 1578/2008 was equally clear as, upon enrollment of a facility into the pre-allocation
registry, Spain confirmed the specific tariff that would apply to the facility for twenty-five years. In the case of 9Ren’s
Formifiena’s plant, Spain confirmed the rate to be 0.2908570 cé/kWh. See Certificate of final registration in the
RAIPRE for Formifiena, 14 April 2011, at p. 3, Exhibit C-215; FTI Quantum Report, para. 3.14.

adapted to the needs of long-term, capital intensive investments, such as renewable

energy facilities”; !©

(d) in terms of reliance, Mr. Giuliani, a director of REN, and an officer of First
Reserve testified that guaranteed stability tariff was a condition precedent to the

Claimant’s investment decision: !©

SREN Holding would not have made this investment if it had known
that Spain might retroactively change the tariffs for completed
projects. '°*

Mr. Giuliani was encouraged by the willingness of large banks to provide non-
recourse finance at ratios of 80% or higher, secured by the future cash flows of the
solar PV plants. This confirmed his interpretation of the regulatory measures as

providing security for investments in the Spanish renewable energy regime;'®

(e) Spain was fully aware that the return on investment under RD 661/2007 was well
in excess of the 7.398% that it now argues is reasonable. The regulator CNE
projected returns at between 9.1% for fixed installation (like those of the Claimant)

and 9.8% for sun-tracking facilities; 166

(f) the Claimant states that Spanish officials repeatedly made explicit promises to
investors that the support they would receive through the RD 661/2007 incentives
and other elements of the regulatory regime would remain constant throughout the

operating lives of the PV facilities. While these “promises” were framed in terms

‘65 Giuliani First Witn
166 CNE 30/2008 Report, Exhibit C-111, states at p. 17:
These figures have been used to calculate the return, taking into account the regulatory tariff currently in
force in RD 661/2007 and the tariff contemplated in the draft Royal Decree for type II. The regulatory tariff
that would be necessary to achieve a return of 7%, which was the reference used in the economic calculations
of RD 661/2007.
The returns obtained by considering current costs (first half of 2008) and the tariff in place under Royal
Decree 661/2007 vary between 9.1% for fixed installations and 9.8% for sun tracking installations.

confirmed prior to the Claimant’s investment to be an exceptional measure to deal
with an exceptional situation by multiple statements of persons of authority in the

That provision, already mentioned, is reproduced here again for ease of reference:

Government officials, previously referred to, and (as stated) were also confirmed in unambiguous
terms by press releases issued by the Cabinet Office contemporaneously with RD 661/2207 and

the Referencia as follows:

Every four (4) years the tariffs will be revised, bearing in mind compliance
with the targets set. This will allow an adjustment to the tariffs in line with
the new costs and the degree of compliance with the targets. The tariff
revisions carried out in the future will not affect those installations
already operating. This guarantee affords legal safety [security] to the
producer, providing stability to the sector and promoting its
development.'7’ (emphasis added)

HR ak

It will be in 2010 that the tariffs and premiums set out in the proposal will
be revised in accordance with the targets set out in the Renewable Energies
Plan 2005-2010 and in the Energy Efficiency and Savings Strategy and in
line with the new targets included in the following Renewable Energies
Plan for the period 2011-2020.

The revisions carried out in the future of the tariffs will not affect
those Installations already in operation. This guarantee provides legal
safety [security] for the producer, affording stability to the sector and
fostering its development. '™* (emphasis added)

221. The word “guarantee” is clear and explicit. Thus, Spain’s promises and aggressive
promotion of RD 661/2007 were not only designed to generate expectations on the part of equity
investors; they were also intended to reassure the sophisticated financial community whose

financing was required for the vast majority of the PV projects.'7>

222. In summary, the Claimant’s submission is that Spain created a legitimate expectation
among investors (and their lenders) that the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 tariffs and benefits,
once granted to a particular facility, would be honored for the duration stated in the Royal

Decrees.
B. The Claimant’s Legal Arguments
223. The applicable legal principle was stated in the Total S.A. v. Argentine Award as follows:

[T]he expectation of the investor is undoubtedly “legitimate”, and hence
subject to protection under the fair and equitable treatment clause ... when
public authorities of the host country have made the private investor
believe that such an obligation existed through conduct or by a
declaration. Authorities may also have announced officially their
intent to pursue a certain conduct in the future, on which, in
turn, the investor relied in making investments or incurring costs.'”°
(emphasis added)

224. Arbitral jurisprudence (in the form of “jurisprudence constante”) recognizes that State
conduct and policy goals can create expectations on the part of investors that induce them to

invest.'7’ In this respect, the Claimant relies upon the analysis of legitimate expectations by the

 

175 9005 PER Summary, pp. 55-56, Exhibit C-082. (“With regard to sources of external financing, thi
not intend to list the different modalities or possibilities of projects according to their degree of implementation,
but rather to point out that the financial market continues to respond... to factors of financial profitabi ity staged within

 

order to facilitate and achieve the established objectives.”) The Claimant notes that many financing institutions
provided financing, often on a non-recourse basis, requiring no additional security from investot a result of the
apparent clarity and stability of the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 frameworks. See Claimant’s Memorial, para.
353, see also Margarit First Expert Report, p. 31; see also FTI Regulatory Report paras. 6.24, 6.37. This was the method
by which the Claimant largely financed its own investment.

Micula v. Romania tribunal. In the late 1990s, Romania was in “‘a deep economic and social
crisis” and it “undertook serious efforts to attract investment, both foreign and domestic.” !78
Romania passed a series of tax incentives with the stated goal of inducing investment in some
of the most under- developed regions of the country.'”? The Micula claimants invested in reliance
on those regulatory incentives and, in particular, on the expectation that they would be

maintained for a 10-year period.'*° Romania then changed its mind.

225. The Micula tribunal found that “an interplay of the purpose behind the [incentives]
regime, the legal norms, the [administrative certificate granting the incentives to specific
investors], and Romania’s conduct” gave rise to a legitimate expectation that the incentives

would endure substantially unchanged throughout their stated duration. '*!

226. Similarly, the E/ Paso v. Argentina tribunal stated that “a reiteration of the same type
of commitment in different types of general statements could, considering the circumstances,

amount to a specific behaviour of the State, the object and purpose of which is to give the investor

182

a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely. The El Paso tribunal further observed in terms

similar to the UNCTAD Report previously cited, at paragraph 375:

375. A reasonable general regulation can be considered a violation of the
FET standard if it violates a specific commitment towards the investor.
The Tribunal considers that a special commitment by the State towards an
investor provides the latter with a certain protection against changes in the
legislation, but it needs to discuss more thoroughly the concept of ‘specific
commitments’. In the Tribunal’s view, no general definition of what
constitutes a specific commitment can be given, as all depends on the
circumstances. However, it seems that two types of commitments might
be considered ‘specific’: those specific as to their addressee and those
specific regarding their object and purpose.'*’ (emphasis added)

227. Promises or assurances from the State can be explicit or implicit and still create “legitimate
expectations.” Explicit promises can be made in the legal or regulatory framework of the host
State at the time the investor made its investment. '** This was the case of RD 661/2007 and RD
1578/2008. Much of the jurisprudence arising out of the 1999 Argentine economic crisis confirms
that observation.!®> For example, in both the Enron and LG&E cases, the respective tribunals
found that guarantees set forth in domestic law constituted a State promise to foreign investors

and were deemed sufficient to create legitimate expectations. '*®

228. The Claimant argues that ““Masdar is the third award in a rapidly developing jurisprudence
constant confirming that Spain’s abrogation of the RD 661/2007 incentive tariffs constitutes a

violation of the ECT. To date, four ECT tribunals have found against Spain in cases involving

nearly identical facts. Those cases are Eiser, Novenergia, Masdar and Antin.” 187

229. The Claimant argues that at international law, a State is not permitted to point to competing

government interests to justify legislative or regulatory changes that undermine investors’

184 Total S.A. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1, Decision on Liability, 27 December 2010, para.

statements could, considering the circumstances, amount to a specific behaviour of the State, the object and
purpose of which is to give the investor a guarantee on which it can justifiably rely”), Exhibit CL-012.

185 These cases all involved a 1991 Argentinean law that indexed the peso to the US dollar while also providing
for the convertibility of the former to the latter. In reliance on this law, foreign investors invested heavily in
Argentina's newly-privatized gas sector. For a time, prices were calculated in US dollars and adjusted twice a year
on the ba: f the US production price index. But as a result of a financial crisis, Argentina declared a state of
emergency and passed a series of new laws in early 2002, abolishing the peso-US dollar indexation, converting
all US dollar obligations into pesos, and stipulating that all prices would from then on be calculated in pesos, not US
dollars.

legitimate expectations. That is particularly true when the investments in question require

substantial upfront costs that can only be recovered over a substantial period of time.'**

230. The jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court concerned the domestic legal situation
under the Spanish Constitution. It did not address, as there was no need to do so, the impact of

changes in the Spanish regulatory system on Spain’s obligations under international law.

231. The Claimant relies on the advice of the Spanish law firm Garrigues Abogados which
was retained to conduct due diligence on the proposed investment.!*? In its report, Garrigues

summarized the key provisions of RD 661/2007, and confirmed that in its opinion:

(a) the tariff rates would be “updated annually taking as a reference the increase in the

CPI less 0.25 until 31/12/2012 and 0.50 thereafter”;

(b) the tariff rates would be revised in 2010 in light of changes in the “costs
associated with each of these technologies, the degree of participation of the
special system in covering demand and the effect on the technical and economic

management of the system”;

(c) but [quoting Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007] that “such revisions of the
regulated tariff ... will not affect facilities commissioned before 1 January of
the second year following the year the revision has been made.”!*° (emphasis

added)

188 As the Perenco Ecuador Ltd. v. Republic of Ecuador, \CSYD Case No. ARB/08/6, Decision on Remaining Issues
of Jurisdiction and Liability, 12 September 2014, para. 564, tribunal explained (Exhibit CL-024):
Particularly after changes in government occur, States must seek to act consistently with, and governments
cannot willfully repudiate, long- term commercial relationships with foreign investors concluded by
their predecessors. New governments must bear in mind why the State engaged in such relationships in the
first place, because resource ion and other capital-intensive inves s with ial ‘up-front’
generally require a medium to long-term period of operations in order to be able to generate a
reasonable return on investment. Such investments must be able to withstand deviations in governmental
policy that could undermine their contractual framework.

233.

The Claimant’s legal expert, Professor Aragon testified that Article 44(3):

expressly guarantees facilities that have satisfied the procedures [required
to benefit from RD 661/2007] and therefore their investors, that the
remuneration model that led them to realize their investment would
not change, armoring that model against revisions of tariffs,
premiums, supplements, duration and limits...'°! (emphasis added)

 

The Respondent’s Argument in Opposition to the Existence of Any “Legitimate
Expectation”

Spain relies on its general position regarding its sovereign authority to amend regulations

within the limits of the parent statute, The Electricity Act, 1997, and in particular:

any investor who performed due diligence in 2008 would know that under Spanish
law the regulator had no authority to make irrevocable commitments in respect of
FIT benefits. It would know that the FIT tariff and other benefits could be modified
by a subsequent regulation authorized by the underlying law. No mere Royal
Decree was (or could be) entrenched beyond modification or repeal by subsequent
measures equally authorized by the underlying statute namely the Electricity Law

1997,

the Claimant would also have understood Spain’s sovereign authority and
responsibility to regulate the electricity sector, an essential public service, in the

public interest;

the Claimant has misconstrued Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 by ignoring the words
“indicated in this section” or “defined in this Royal Decree” [depending on the

translation];

in any event, the Claimant’s investment was made in stages. Legitimate

expectations are ass

 

ssed as of the date of the final step, which was not taken by

the Claimant until 2011. As such, all of the Claimant’s investments come under RD

191 Aragon First Expert Report, p. 27.

80

1578/2008 not RD 661/2007, and RD 1578/2008 did not grandfather “existing
facilities”.

(a) Spain Argues that the Claimant Could Have No Legitimate Expectation of Irrevocability
in Light of the Clear and Consistent Jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court

234. Spain rejects the contention that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 should be considered as
exceptions to the general regulatory framework. In terms of the hierarchy of laws, no regulation
can prevent subsequent modifications that comply with the provisions of the parent statute. Article
30.4 of the Electricity Law 1997 allows investors to expect only “reasonable rates of return with
reference to the cost of money in the capital market” or “reasonable remuneration for their
investments.” The Spanish government’s authority to modify premiums that foster electricity
production has been consistently affirmed by the Spanish Supreme Court before, during and after
the date of the Claimant’s investment and the Claimant could have had no legitimate expectation

to the contrary.

235. Spain rejects the Claimant’s reliance on RD 661/2007 because the Claimant knew or ought
to have known that the Spanish regulatory system promised nothing more than a reasonable rate
of return. The Spanish Supreme Court Judgment of 25 October 2006,'” rendered before the
Claimant made any investment in Spain, established that the Spanish regulatory framework allows
regulatory changes that: (i) affect the economics of existing installations and; (ii) modify the

formulas used for fixing the subsidies to renewable facilities. The Court said that:

... the payment regime under examination does not guarantee to special
regime electricity producers that a certain level of profits or revenues will
[be] unchanged relative to those obtained in previous years, or the
formulas for fixing the premiums will stay unchanged.

Just as in terms of an economic policy with many different aspects (the
promotion of renewable energy but also the planning of electricity
networks, and other considerations regarding energy saving and
efficiency) grants and incentives for the production of electricity under the
special regime may increase from one year to another, but they may
also decrease when those same considerations warrant it.'*

HR ak

'2 Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, 25 October 2006 (Appeal 12/2005), Exhibit R-O118.
"3 Dbid., p. 4.

81

Companies that freely decide to enter a market such as electricity
generation under the special regime, knowing that is largely dependent on
the setting of economic incentives by public authorities, are or should be
aware that they may be modified within legal guidelines, by those same
authorities. One of the "regulatory risks" to which they submit and
which they must take into account, is precisely the variation of
parameters for premiums or incentives, something which the Electricity
Sector Law limits, as previously discussed, but does not preclude.'**
(emphasis added)

236. Therefore, Spain argues, the investors in this economic activity knew or ought to have

known that their investment would be subject to a “regulatory risk” of a reduced tariff. !°°

237. The 2006 Spanish Supreme Court Judgment went on to observe that investors could expect
only “reasonable returns with reference to the cost of money in the capital market” or, to put it
again in the words of the preamble to Royal Decree 436/2004, “reasonable compensation for their
investment.”!°° The Supreme Court pointed out that the limits to the regulatory powers do not
reside in the regulations which are subject to changes in the government’s discretion but in the
governing statute, being the Electricity Law 1997. Spain contends that anyone investing in Spain

with due diligence would (or ought to) have been aware of the Supreme Court’s authoritative

pronouncements as of the date of the investment. !*”

238. The Spanish Supreme Court reiterated the principles of its 2005 and 2006 decision in 2009

when faced with additional claims about the immutability of the remuneration regime. !°*

194 Ibid.
15 Tt is noted that the Spanish Supreme Court was referring in this Judgment to a prior regulatory decree (RD
436/2004) which did not contain the language of RD 661/2007 which, according to the Claimant, provides the
guarantees of stability it relies upon.

regulating electricity generation in the special regime and specific technological facilities equivalent to the ordinary
regime, of 14 February 2007, pp. 21-22, (PDF pp. 153-154), Exhibit R-0101. Thus, the CNE itself, shortly before the
Claimant's investment on 23 April 2008 reminded everyone that the Spanish Supreme Court’s Judgment of 25 October
2006 had affirmed the modification of “premiums that foster electricity production” does not violate the principle of
either legal certainty or of legitimate expectation.
198 Judgment of the Third Chamber from the Supreme Court, 9 December of 2009, Legal Ground 6, p. 4., Exhibit R-
0122:

(The Claimant) does not pay enough attention to the case law of this Chamber specifically referred to with

regard to the principles of legitimate expectation and non- ity applied to the

regimes for electricity generation. This involves the considerations set out in our decision dated October 25,

 

 

82

239. As recently as 2017, the Supreme Court reiterated the same principle:

...the only thing guaranteed to the owners of the facilities is a right to
a reasonable return on their investments - not a right to the prevailing
remuneration framework when they made their investment
remaining unchanged. (emphasis added)

HR ak

...the analysed remuneration regime did not ensure owners of facilities
under the special regime “the intangibility of a certain level of profits or
revenues relative to those obtained in previous years, nor formulas used to
set feed-in tariffs remaining unchanged indefinitely.”!”

240.  Arbitral tribunals also uniformly acknowledge a State’s sovereign right to regulate its

economy in the interest of its citizens. In Parkerings v. Lithuania, the tribunal decided:

It is each State’s undeniable right and privilege to exercise its sovereign
legislative power. A State has the right to enact, modify or cancel a law at
its own discretion.””

241. In AES v. Hungary, the tribunal decided, in considering the application of Article 10(1) of

the ECT to changes in electricity pricing:

...any reasonably informed business person or investor knows that laws
can evolve in accordance with the perceived political or policy dictates at
the time.”"!

2006 and repeated in that ed on March 20, 2007, inter alia, about the legal situation of the owners of
electrical energy production installations under a special regime to whom it is not possible to acknowledge
for the future an “unmodifiable right” to the maintenance unchanged of the remuneration framework
approved by the holder of the regulatory authority provided that the stipulations of the Law on the Electricity
Sector are respected in terms of the reasonable return on investments.

(b) The Tribunal’s Ruling on the Relevance of the Spanish Supreme Court Jurisprudence

242. The jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court in relation to Spain’s domestic law is
entitled to great respect, but the judgments relied upon by the Respondent address a different issue

than the issue before this Tribunal, which is concerned only with international law obligations.

243. It is not surprising that the Spanish Supreme Court should affirm that regulatory measures
under domestic Spanish law may be modified in the exercise of Spanish sovereignty. The question
before the Tribunal however is whether such changes can be made by Spain without financial

consequences under the ECT.

244. The views of the Spanish Supreme Court concerning legal certainty or legitimate
expectation may dispose of the issue of government liability at domestic law, but the Claimant
does not rely on Spanish domestic law. It relies on Article 26(6) of the Energy Charter Treaty
which mandates this Tribunal, not the Spanish Supreme Court, to determine whether the Claimant
had a legitimate expectation of irrevocability and if so, whether that legitimate expectation was
violated, and if so the legal consequences as a matter of international law. This is clear from Article
27 of the Vienna Convention which states that a “party may not invoke the provisions of its internal

law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty.”

(c) Spain Argues Not Only That it Had the Right but the Duty to Regulate its Energy Sector in
the Public Interest

245. Spain contends that the better view taken by some prior tribunals is that Article 44(3) is
not a stabilisation clause?” and in any event is not a clog on Spain’s regulatory responsibility to
evolve in response to changing conditions. Spain rejects the Claimant’s position as explained by
FTI from “an economic and regulatory perspective, there were better options available to the

Spanish Government.” FTI is wrong to claim that:

Spain did not need to shift part of the burden of its tariff deficit to
renewable energy investors, and doing so was not wise policy. The
measures introduced by the Spanish Government increase regulatory
uncertainty in Spain increasing the risk of investments not only in the
renewables sector but also in other sectors that are dependent on regulated
payments. As discussed in Section 5, the EC and other authorities

2 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, para. 595 et seq.

84

cautioned that retroactive changes undermine investor confidence and
should be avoided. Investors will be likely to require higher rates of
return on their investments to be compensated for the increased
regulatory risks increasing the costs of achieving Spain's renewable
electricity generation targets.”°°

246. According to Spain, the ECT clearly permits the adoption of reasonable and proportionate

macroeconomic control measures, provided that they are motivated in the public interest, as

explained in Plama v. Bulgaria:

[T]he Tribunal believes that the ECT does not protect investors against
any and all changes in the host country's laws. Under the fair and equitable
treatment standard, the investor is only protected if (at least) reasonable
and justifiable expectations were created in that regard. It does not appear
that Bulgaria made any promises or other representations to freeze its
legislation on environmental law to the Claimant or at all.?04

247. Among other relevant facts, in this case, Spain emphasizes:

(a)

(b)

(c)

the public interest in the financial sustainability of the SES;

the awareness of the renewable energy investors of Spain’s ‘ius variandi’ powers

within the statutory limit of ensuring a reasonable rate of return on the investment;

Many of the so-called “representations” by the Spanish government have no official
status, as in the case of the CNE, an advisory body whose statements cannot be

taken as government policy. Counsel for Spain submitted:

[W]e need to understand what the role of the CNE is within the Spanish
regulatory framework. The CNE was mainly a consulting body. Its reports
are not binding. Consultants describe its influence capacity towards policy
making as low compared to industry stakeholders. ..considering that it was
an advisory board and its reports were not binding, it didn’t have authority
on decision making at all.?”

85

Moreover, Spain says that the CNE PowerPoint presentations relied upon by the

Claimant were for “training courses” given by CNE personnel not to promote

foreign investment;2

(d) the worsening of the international crisis from 2009 to 2012, resulted in an
exceptional decrease in electricity demand. Spain’s risk premium compared to

Germany reached 575 points on 18 June 2012, and 637 points on 24 July 2012;

(e) the international commitments undertaken by the Kingdom of Spain in July 2012

in relation to the bailout of the Spanish financial sector;

(f) the adoptions of macroeconomic control measures to ensure the sustainability of

the SES and to avoid an excessive burden on consumers.?°”

248. Spain relies in particular on the Award in Charanne B.V and Construction Investments

S.A.R.L v. Kingdom of Spain?®® which held that:

In this case, the Claimants could not have the legitimate expectation that
the regulatory framework laid down by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
would remain unchanged during the entire lifespan of their plants.
Accepting such an expectation would, in fact, amount to freezing the
regulatory framework applicable to eligible plants, even though the
circumstances may change. Any modification to the tariff amount or any
limitation in the number of eligible hours would thus constitute a violation
of International Law. In practice, the situation would be equivalent to that
resulting from the signing by a State of a stabilisation agreement, or of a
commitment to never modify the regulatory framework. The Arbitral
Tribunal cannot accept such a conclusion. In fact, the Claimants
themselves have clearly stated that they could not reasonably expect
that the regulatory framework would remain unchanged. (emphasis
added)

The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants that said decisions [of the
Spanish Supreme Court] are irrelevant or out of context. Although they
refer to different rules, those judgments clearly lay down the principle that
domestic law can modify, in compliance with the LSE, an economic
regime, such as the one provided in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008,
aimed at fostering renewable energy production. To the Tribunal’s
understanding, at the time of making the investment in 2009 the
Claimants could have carried out an analysis of their investment’s
legal framework in Spanish law and understood that the regulations
enacted in 2007 and 2008 could be modified. At least that is the degree
of diligence that could be expected from a foreign investor in a heavily
regulated sector like the energy industry. In such a sector, thorough prior
analysis of the legal framework applicable thereto is essential to make an
investment.””? (emphasis added)

(Note: The decisions referred to in the Award are the Judgment of the
Supreme Court of 15 December 2005 (Exhibit R-117) and the Judgment
of the Supreme Court of 25 October 2006 (Exhibit R-118).)

249. Spain also notes the observation by the arbitral panel in /solux Infrastructure Netherlands,

B.V. v. the Kingdom of Spain that:

Without requiring a reasonable investor to perform an extensive legal
investigation at the time of investing, knowledge of important decisions
from the highest authority regarding the regulatory framework for
investment may be assumed.?!°

250. As in the Charanne Award, the Isolux tribunal quotes the Supreme Court Judgments of
20057!! and 20067! as decisions from the highest authority regarding the dynamic and flexible
regulatory framework. Such knowledge should be attributed to the investors by reason of their due

diligence obligations.

251. Spain further contends that the Claimant has not furnished any proof of ever having
knowledge of the Government presentations or statements now relied upon and in particular of the

Cabinet press release and the Referencia.?"

252. In any event, the tribunal in AES Summit v. Hungary rejected the argument that the

existence of a stability clause can be deduced from a general regulatory framework:

The stable conditions that the ECT mentions relate to the framework
within which the investment takes place. Nevertheless, it is not a stability
clause. A legal framework is by definition subject to change as it
adapts to new circumstances day by day and a state has the sovereign
right to exercise its powers which include legislative acts.

 

Therefore, to determine the scope of the stable conditions that a state has
to encourage and create is a complex task given that it will always depend
on the specific circumstances that surround the investor’s decision to

and Charanne v. the Kingdom of Spain:

in the absence of a specific commitment an investor cannot have the
legitimate expectation that the regulation in place is going to remain
unchanged.”!° (emphasis added)

(d) The Tribunal’s Ruling on Spain’s Reliance on a Sovereign Duty to Evolve Regulations in
the Public Interest

253. Inthe Tribunal’s respectful view, for the reasons already discussed, the Charanne tribunal
placed too much emphasis on the domestic jurisprudence of the Spanish Supreme Court. This
Tribunal does not doubt the constitutional authority of Spain to evolve its regulatory system to
keep abreast of changing circumstances. The question is whether under the ECT the cost of such
changes should fall on the investors who were attracted to Spain’s renewable energy by specific

promises of stability rather than fall on Spanish consumers or Spanish taxpayers generally.

254. Tribunals have been quite consistent on the need to balance a State’s regulatory autonomy

against international obligations freely undertaken. In Saluka, the tribunal decided:

No investor may reasonably expect that the circumstances prevailing at
the time the investment is made remain totally unchanged. In order to
determine whether frustration of the foreign investor’s expectations was
justified and reasonable, the host State's legitimate right subsequently to

regulate domestic matters in the public interest must be taken into
consideration as well. As the S.D. Myers tribunal has stated, the
determination of a breach of the obligation of “fair and equitable
treatment’ by the host State ‘must be made in the light of the high measure
of deference that international law generally extends to the right of
domestic authorities to regulate matters within their own borders”?"®

255. In El Paso v Argentina, the tribunal decided: “There can be no legitimate expectation for
anyone that the legal framework will remain unchanged in the face of an extremely severe
economic crisis. No reasonable investor can have such an expectation unless very specific
commitments have been made towards it or unless the alteration of the legal framework is

total.”?!” (emphasis added)

256. In Glamis v. USA, the tribunal decided that, without a specific undertaking to the
contrary, “a claimant cannot have a legitimate expectation that the host country will not pass

legislation that will affect it.”2!*

257. In this case, Article 44.3 of RD 661/2007 was a specific undertaking within the
contemplation of the jurisprudence. A representation is no less “‘specific” if (as here) it is addressed
to an identifiable class of persons, namely prospective investors whose money was solicited by

Spain’s FIT program.

258. The effect of an ECT award in favour of the Claimant would simply be to transfer back to
Spain the cost of the tariff modifications without in any way putting in question the validity at

Spanish law of the disputed measures.

259. While unforeseen events understandably created serious difficulty for the Spanish
regulators and the Spanish economy, Spain accepted international obligations under the ECT and
the Tribunal’s obligation is not to rewrite history but to give effect to the RD 661/2007 embodiment
of government policy to the extent RD 661/2007 created legitimate expectations of stability in

accordance with its terms.

(e) Spain Argues that the Claimant Misconstrues the Terms of RD 661/2007 by Ignoring the
Words “Defined in this Royal Decree” or “indicated in this Section”

260. Spain says the Claimant’s argument misconstrues the terms of RD 661/2007 which (put at
its highest) deals only with an expected 2010 review of “tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower
and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree [RD 661/2007]” and it is only those listed revisions
that were not to be applied to previously commissioned facilities. The “disputed measures” are not

on the list of investor protections.

261. The expert witness, Carlos Montoya, described RD 661/2007 as a measure designed to
limit compensation, not expand it. Speaking of the earlier RD 436/2004 regime, Mr. Montoya

testified:

Not only did the link between the TMR [the “Average Reference Tariff]”
and the regulated tariffs and premiums cause excess remuneration across
all technologies, it also had an unfavourable effect on the economic
sustainability of the SES. This effect on the sustainability became acuter
once the renewable energy implementation targets established in the PER
2005-2010, and the real installed power of some technologies are taken
into account.

RD 661/2007 implemented a new remuneration regime to avoid this
perverse effect, which caused an increase in unjustified remuneration
due to the simple commissioning of new generation facilities?!
(emphasis added)

262. On this point, Spain argues that the Claimant’s argument distorts reality:

The Claimant conveys a misinterpretation on the reason that justified the
approval of RD 661/2007. It inaccurately claims that the only reason for
the enactment was to improve incentives to achieve the objectives set by
the EU. This statement is not supported by any evidence provided by the
Claimant.

As stated above, RD 661/2007 was motivated by the need to ensure the
economic sustainability of the SES, which could be affected by a system
of subsidies linked to the TMR.””

219 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, paras. 516, 519. Accordingly, RD 7/2006 of 23 June 2006 noted the inefficiency
of the then existing remuneration system and froze the renewable energy subsidies until a new remuneration system
was implemented by RD 661/2007.

220 Thid., paras. 525, 541-542.

90

263. The text of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 must be read in light of these realities and not so

as to handcuff Spain in dealing with a situation of over-remuneration.

if) The Tribunal’s Ruling on Spain’s Purposive and Textual Interpretation of RD 661/2007

264. In plain terms, Article 44(3) specifically represented to potential investors that:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

there would be a review in 2010 of the tariffs, premiums, supplements and lower

and upper limits defined in this Royal Decree;

but regardless of any revisions resulting from the 2010 review, a reasonable rate of
profitability shall always be guaranteed with reference to the cost of money in

capital markets;

subsequently, a further review shall be performed every four years, maintaining the

same criteria as previously;

the revisions to the tariffs, etc. “defined in RD 661/2007” shall not affect facilities
for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to January 1 of

the second year following the year in which the revision shall have been performed.

265. The above interpretation of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 was affirmed with crystal clarity

by the Spanish Cabinet in its press release accompanying RD 661/2007 that assured investors of

the stability guarantee:

Every 4 years, the tariffs will be revised, bearing in mind compliance with
the targets set. This will allow an adjustment to the tariffs in line with the
new costs and the degree of compliance with the targets. The tariff
revisions carried out in the future will not affect those installations
already operating. This guarantee affords legal safety to the producer,
providing stability to the sector and promoting its development.”!
(emphasis added)

266. The terms of Article 44 of RD 661/2007 must be read not only with a close regard to its

text but also the broader context in which it was made and its clear and obvious paramount purpose

21 Press Release for RD 661/2007, Exhibit C-099.

91

which was (in the Tribunal’s view) the inducement of investment in renewable energy that Spain’s

earlier incentives had failed to attract.

267. The existence of the listed revisions contemplated to occur in 2010 and periodically
thereafter show that the financial terms applicable to the FIT program were not entirely frozen.
Nevertheless, if even such relatively modest revisions?” would not apply to existing facilities, it
is not credible to conclude that the text of RD 661/2007 was intended to convey the message that
even more sweeping revisions or wholesale repeal of benefits would apply to existing facilities (as

happened from 2010 onwards).

268. Moreover, if the Spanish Government had really intended to make such a limited “offer”
in RD 661/2007, and had said so in plain language, the evidence shows that RD 661/2007 would
not have accomplished its legislative purpose. Prior offers had failed to attract the necessary
investment in renewable energy. Spain was under time pressure from the EU to meet its renewable
energy targets. By 2007, Spain recognized that its offer to potential investors had to be dramatically
improved, and Spain reacted (possibly, in the government’s current view, over-reacted) with RD

661/2007.

269. The Tribunal does not accept Spain’s reading of RD 661/2007 as plausible. The Claimant’s

interpretation of RD 661/2007, taken in the context of its creation, is persuasive.

222 The Claimant argues in the alternative that the categories of revisions indicated in this section are broad enough to

include the disputed measures which were thereby expressly excluded from application to existing PV facilities, as
follows:

Investment costs

to the cost of money Interest rates

“impact upon the technical and economic Economic sustainability of the system

 

92

(g) The Tribunal’s Ruling on the Claimant’s Reliance on the RD 661/2007 “Guarantee”

270. While there is no evidence the Claimant was aware prior to its investment of the Spanish
Cabinet Press Release and Referencia which stated that:

The revisions carried out in the future of the tariffs will not affect

those Installations already in operation. This guarantee provides legal

safety [security] for the producer, affording stability to the sector and
fostering its development.” (emphasis added)

There is no doubt that the Claimant independently arrived at this understanding of RD 661/2007
prior to its investment, and relied on the clear undertaking in RD 661/2007 in deciding to invest

€211 million in Spanish renewable energy projects.

271. As mentioned, Mr. Giuliani, a director of 9REN, and an officer of First Reserve testified
that guaranteed stability tariff was a condition precedent to the Claimant's investment decision:?*4

OREN Holding would not have made this investment if it had known that
Spain might retroactively change the tariffs for completed projects.”?>

272. Mr. Giuliani’s plain text reading of RD 661/2007 was reinforced by the “due diligence”
opinion obtained from Garrigues Abogados which reported that in its opinion “such revisions of
the regulated tariff...will not affect facilities commissioned before 1 January of the second year

following the year the revision has been made.”?°

273. There is no persuasive evidence that undermines the evidence of such reliance, and it stands
to reason that investors would (and did) require such a guarantee before committing the very large,
up-front costs of renewable energy projects. The Claimant’s investment of €211 million was not

made unless and was only made when such a guarantee was entrenched in a regulation.

(h) In Any Event, Spain Contends that the Claimant’s Investment was Made in Stages, and
Legitimate Expectations are Assessed as of the Date of the Final Step. Therefore the
Claimant’s Investments Were Made Under RD 1578/2008 not RD 661/2007, and RD
1578/2008 did not Grandfather “Existing Facilities”

274. The text of RD 1578/2008 contains no explicit “grandfathering” of existing renewable
energy facilities. It therefore becomes critical to identify the effective date of the Claimant’s
investment. The cut-off date for RAIPRE registration under RD 661/2007 was 29 September 2008.
Thereafter, RD 1578/2008 provides for compensation “for a maximum [not minimum] period of

25 years from the last of the start-up dates or the date of registration.” (emphasis added)

275. Spain contends that the Claimant continued its investment in stages from 2008 to 2011.
Once it is established that investment decisions were being made by the Clamant as late as 2011,
the appropriate date to ascertain the legitimacy of the expectation is when the whole of the
investments were complete, i.e. 2011,77” at which point RD 1578/2008 had already made it clear

that existing FIT benefits could be reduced by regulatory modification.

276. The Fifth Additional Provision of RD 1578/2008 explicitly warned of the potential

modification of rates as follows:

during the year 2012, based on the technological evolution of the sector
and the market, and the functioning of the compensatory regime,
compensation for the generation of electric power by photovoltaic solar
technology may be modified.?”* (emphasis added)

 

227 In this respect, the Respondent refers to Professor Schreuer’s Opinion that:

 

It follows from thi
purposes of their ju

 

consistent case law that tribunals, when examining the existence of an investment for

diction, have not looked at specific transactions but at the overall operation. Tribunals
have refused to dissect an investment into individual steps taken by the investor, even if these steps were
identifiable as separate legal transactions. What mattered for the identification and protection of the
i was the entire operation directed at the investment's overall ic goal.

277. Spain says the Claimant’s current position that its investment was complete in April 2008
is contradicted by the Claimant’s own words in its Memorial on the Merits.?”? The evidence is

clear that 9REN Espaijia projects continued to be developed until at least 2011.

278. It is common ground that at least PV Plant of Formifiena was registered in 2011, i.e. after
29 September 2008, even though the registration document refers to RD 661/2007 not RD
1578/2008. 75°

279. The Claimant’s current position is contradicted by its own instructions to its experts that
its investments were made in successive tranches between 2008 and 2011. The FTI Consulting

Group stated in its 2016 report:

2.2 In 2007 and 2008, Spain enacted two successive incentive schemes for
renewables technologies including solar PV (through RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008, the First Regulatory Framework). Between 2008 and
2011, the Claimant invested in the Spanish PV generation sector
under those schemes. 7°! (emphasis added)

280. The Claimant’s legal expert, Professor Aragén was similarly instructed that investment

“occurred between April 2008 and March 2011.”?7?

281. Professor Arag6n confirmed that he received such instructions from the Claimant:

22° In its Memorial on the Merits, the Claimant states:
2. After the acquisition, 9REN Espaiia developed and operated its own facilities in reliance on RD 661/2007
and RD 1578/2008.
231. After the acquisition, 9REN INVESTED FURTHER in Spain through its wholly-owned subsidiary,
OREN Espaiia, by developing eight solar parks in the former Gamesa Solar’s “pipeline” of projects. These
projects had a combined nominal capacity of approximately 15 MW.
232. OREN Espaiia successfully constructed, commissioned, and registered with the RAIPRE seven of its
own projects before the September 29, 2008 cut-off date for registration under RD 661/2007...
233. Although 9REN originally intended to sell these PV fac after completing them, the market for
M&A transactions was not strong in 2009 due to the global financial crisis and ensuing rect nn. Because
it did not want to sell the projects at deflated prices, 9REN decided to retain these , at least
momentarily...
237. In 2011, REN Espafia commissioned and registered its eighth self-owned plant, Formifiena, located in
Aragon, under the RAIPRE on March 23, 2011. The 1.0 MW Formifiena facility was entitled to payment of
the RD 1578/2008 fixed tariff for 25 years from the date of commissioning.

In your second report you say that investment was made, that the Claimant
invested between April 2008 and March 2011. Did you review that, did
you confirm that, or that’s a data that your clients gave you?

A. Those information were provided by those who commissioned this
report.??

282. The Certification in the Registry of Installations on Special Regime of Formifiena Plant
establishes that the license to build the plant was not issued until 6 November 2008 well after the
29 September 2008 deadline for RD 661/2007.?** The Formijiena PV Plant was not finished until
January 2011.

283. Spain argues that once it is established that at least part of the Claimant’s investment fell
outside the RD 661/2007 regime and engaged the RD 1578/2008 regime, the Claimant’s entire
entitlement fails to be considered under RD 1578/2008. As counsel for Spain put it in the post-

hearing brief:

..-all RD 1578/2008 [Fifth] Additional Provisions [warning of future tariff
modifications] were applicable to Royal Decrees and Ministerial Orders
different than RD 1578/2008...the literal wording of this [Fifth]
Additional Provision clearly includes all the “photovoltaic solar
technology” and does not exclude the registered PV Plants.

284. Spain contends that arbitral jurisprudence establishes that the correct timing for
determining an investor’s legitimate expectations is not the historical moment of the investor’s

initial commitment of capital in respect of a particular project, but rather its expenditure

throughout the course of the investment as a whole.?*°

96

285. Ulysseas v. Ecuador established that legitimate expectations can only arise at the time the

investment is actually made:

In order for an “investment” to arise in this sense, there must be an actual
transfer of money or other economic value from a national (whether a
physical or a judicial person) of a foreign State to the host State through
the assumption of some kind of commitment ensuring the effectiveness of
the contribution and its duration over a period of time.?*°

286. Spain points out that the Claimant’s acquisition of Gamesa Solar’s shares included a
“pipeline” of eight “projects” which were not yet developed and according to Spain, this “implied”
that further investment decisions were necessary to complete the investment beyond the RD

661/2007 cut-off. This is confirmed by 9REN Espaiia’s 2011 financial statement.?*”

(i) The Tribunal Rules that the Claimant’s Investment was made in April 2008 in Reliance on
RD 661/2007

287. Spain’s argument conflates the date of the investment by the Claimant (23 April 2008)

and the dates when various projects were registered (2008-2011). Thus Spain contends that:

 

...it is totally contradictory that the Claimant, on the one hand, appeals
against RD 1565/2010 and RDL 14/2010 on the grounds that it considers
that the Kingdom of Spain violated the ECT in 2010 and, on the other,
built a new PV plant which became operational in April 2011. This
contradiction is insurmountable.”

288. As stated, some of this confusion was created by the Claimant’s own pleadings as reflected

in the First FTI report and statements by the Claimants’ own expert witnesses.

A legitima fe expectation is normally said to arise “at the time of making the investment”. In the Tribunal’s

289. The critical date for purposes of assessing the reasonableness and legitimacy of the

Claimant’s expectations is the date the Claimant invested, which on the evidence is 23 April 2008.

290. The fact the investment was used to finance projects in stages thereafter is not relevant as
by those dates the investment funds had already been remitted under the protection of the ECT and

(in part) RD 661/2007.

291. However, the fact the Formifiena Plant was covered by RD 1578/2008 rather than RD
661/2007 is relevant to quantum because while the Formifiena Plant was part of the Claimant’s
protected investment, the entitlement to a continuing revenue stream from Formifiena was not

protected by the RD 661/2007 stability guarantee.

D. The Tribunal Concludes That the Claimant Reasonably Relied Upon a Legitimate
Expectation that the FIT Benefits of RD 661/2007 Would Continue for the Useful Life
of Seven of its Eight Facilities

292. It is true, as Spain argues, that in this case the Claimant is unable to point to any specific
communication fo it (as opposed to erga omnes) from an official authorized to bind the Spanish
government affirming in the Claimant’s case the irrevocability of RD 661/2007 entitlements.
Although, as mentioned, there was a specific government to investor communication in respect of

9REN’s Formifiena Plant regarding the rate of 0.2908570 c€/kWh.?*?

293. The relative absence of direct government to investor communications is a factor of some

weight although, as the Claimant points out, the specific “in person” communications in Masdar**”

and some of the other cases did little more than repeat what was already plain on the face of RD

661/2007, and in any case post-dated rather that pre-dated the investment.

239 See Certificate of final registration in the RAIPRE for Formifiena, 14 April 2011, p. 3, Exhibit C-215, FTI First
Quantum Report, para. 3.14.

240 The Tribunal acknowledges the helpful analysis in Masdar Solar and Wind Cooperatif U.A. v. Kingdom of Spain,
ICSID Case No. ARB/14/18 dated 16 May 2018 which identifies a spectrum from situations where a claimant relies
only on a bare regulatory measure addressed to the entire world, which lies at the weaker end of the spectrum, to clear
and specific undertakings to a particular investor, which is generally enforceable under the FET. In Spain’s view, the
key difference between Masdar and the present case is the existence in Masdar of direct government assurances to
the investor.

98

294. At the same time, the Tribunal accepts as correct the observation of UNCTAD (2012) that
legitimate expectations may arise from “rules not specifically addressed to a particular investor
but which are put in place with a specific arm to induce foreign investments and on which the
foreign investor relied on making his investment”.~*! To similar effect, the El Paso tribunal
distinguished between “two types of commitments... those specific as to their addressee and
those specific regarding their object and purpose.” Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 falls into
the latter category. It is true that the Claimant’s projects proceeded in stages with the first stage
under RD 661/2007 and the second [much smaller] stage under RD 1578/2008 but the investment
was made (according to Mr. Giuliani’s testimony) on 23 April 2008. Mr. Giuliani’s statement was

not successfully challenged on cross-examination.

295. There is no doubt that an enforceable “legitimate expectation” requires a clear and specific
commitment, but in the view of this Tribunal there is no reason in principle why such a
commitment of the requisite clarity and specificity cannot be made in the regulation itself where
(as here) such a commitment is made for the purpose of inducing investment, which succeeded in

attracting the Claimant’s investment and once made resulted in losses to the Claimant.

296.  Inthese circumstances, there is no principled reason to deny that the investor’s expectations

of performance by the State are legitimate.

297. As of the date of the investment on 23 April 2008 of €211 million, the Claimant therefore

had a reasonable and legitimate expectation that provided its projects complied with FIT

243

requirements (including timely registration under RAIPRE) and continued to comply

throughout the life of the facility, it would receive the benefits set out in RD 661/2007.

242 EI Paso Energy Int’l Co. v. Argentine Republic, ICSID Cece No. ARB/03/15, Award, 31 October 2011, para. 375,
Exhibit CL-0012.
> Spain is correct to dispute the Claimant's position that RAIPRE is an independent source of obligation. As Spain
points out:
Registration in the RAIPRE is not, therefore, a State commitment to indefinitely and unalterably maintain
the future return of the FV sector, but rather an administrative register that makes it possible to control and
know those involved in the SES. This has been the aim of entry in this register since 1998.
The set of conditions and requirements for enjoying the special regime was not simply limited to entry in an
administrative register. The requirements were much greater.
At the same time, Spain acknowledges that registration affirms compliance:

  

 

99

298. As to the Formifiena plant registered in 2011, the RD 1578/2008 tariff was promised for a
maximum (not minimum) of 25 years, and a revision of “compensation” was explicitly
contemplated “during the year 2012”.+ There was no clear and specific representation of
irrevocability. While the Formifiena plant was part of the Claimant’s protected investment, there
was no legitimate expectation that the output of the Formifiena plant would continue to be

compensated at the 2012 level throughout its active lifetime.

299. The Tribunal notes the helpful legal analysis in Masdar which identifies a spectrum of
situations where a claimant relies only on a bare regulatory measure addressed to the entire world,
which lies at the weaker end of the spectrum, to clear and specific undertakings to a particular
investor, which lies at the strongest end.2* In Masdar, the claimant had (as this Claimant does not)
specific letters of commitment from the government. However, as earlier noted, those letters
simply confirmed what was already in RD 661/2007 and were issued after not before the claimant
in that case made its investment. In the Tribunal’s view, the clear and specific “guarantee” in RD

661/2007 satisfies the requisite degree of “specificity”.

RD 661/2007 FRUSTRATED?

300. The frustration of the Claimant’s legitimate expectations is said by the Claimant to have

occurred in two stages:
(a) the initial violations of 2010 to 2014:

(i) cancelling the right of the Claimant’s RD 661/2007 projects to receive the
tariffs after Year 25 of their operating lives (which Spain subsequently

lengthened to Year 28 and finally to Year 30), despite the representation

Furthermore, registration can be revoked if the facility ceases to comply with the requirements to be
included in the special regime.
This is confirmed by Spain in its Counter-Memorial at paragraph 617:
Anyone who complies with the objective requirements could be registered. There is no specific or special
commitment with any facility to keep it registered or to maintain the applicable regime. If the
requirements are no longer fulfilled, the registration is revoked.

in RD 661/2007 that facilities would be eligible for specific tariff rates for

the first twenty-five years of operation and 80% _ of those rates for the

remainder of their operating lives;?*°

(ii) limiting the amount of electricity eligible for feed-in tariffs by imposing
annual operating hour restrictions on all PV facilities, despite the fact that
RD 661/2007 guaranteed fixed feed-in tariffs to the Claimant’s qualifying

facilities for their entire electricity production;?*”

(iti) reducing all of the income earned by the Claimant’s facilities from
electricity production, including revenue from the RD 661/2007

incentives themselves, by a 7% levy wrongfully labeled a “tax”; and

(iv) altering the method for updating the compensation in RD 661/2007 by de-
linking the tariffs from the CPI and substituting a lower index of Spain’s
creation, despite the clear language in RD 661/2007 that “the values of the

tariffs ... as defined in this Royal Decree...shall be updated on an annual

basis using as a reference the increase in the [retail price index (RPI)].”7*

The Claimant argues that each of those measures served to reduce what had been
granted to the Claimant as fixed, guaranteed tariffs to be paid throughout the
operating lives of their plants and thereby, the Claimant contends, violated its
legitimate expectations. The “violations” were presented as a package. (The

Claimant’s quantum expert FTI did not endeavor to quantify the financial impact of

each individual “measure”).”°

46 RD 661/2007, Article 36, Table 3, Exhibit C-098.
47 Ibid., Article 17 (granting eligible facilities the rights “... (b) to transfer to the system...their net production of
electrical energy or energy sold [and] (c) to_receive, for the total or partial sale of th[e] net electricity
rated...the ‘ion_provided in the ic regime set out by this Royal Decree.”) (emphasis added).
248 Thid., Article 44.1, Exhibit C-098.
249 As FTI (Richard Edwards) testified:
I don't set out anywhere the financial impact of each measure individually, but it's worth bearing in mind that
the impact of some of these measures is interrelated. So it's not necessarily straightforward to isolate the
impact of each measure. I could do that, I could go away and do that if that was required, but it's not actually
set out in my reports.

 

101

301. Spain’s decision to abolish the right of RD 661/2007 facilities to receive 80% of the
full RD 661/2007 tariff after Year 25 (and then Year 30) of operation was inconsistent with the

clear terms of RD 661/2007 that granted tariffs for the entire operating life of a facility.
A. The New Regulatory Regime (10 June 2014)

302. The New Regulatory Regime that Spain unilaterally imposed on the Claimant after repeal
of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 is fundamentally different from the framework that Spain

promised and that induced the Claimant to invest. According to the Frontier Petroleum tribunal:

Transparency means that the legal framework for the investor’s
operations is readily apparent and that any decisions of the host state
affecting the investor can be traced to that legal framework...[A]n
arbitrary reversal of [that framework] will constitute a violation of
fair and equitable treatment...”°° (emphasis added)

303. The New Regulatory Regime frustrates the Claimant’s legitimate expectations in
multiple respects. First, the Claimant did not invest in Spain in the expectation of receiving a
“reasonable rate of return” as unilaterally defined by Spain from time to time. Rather, the
Claimant invested in Spain in the legitimate expectation its facilities would receive the precise
tariffs established in RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 for all of the electricity produced by its
installations, which the Claimant concluded based on its own criteria and judgment would

offer a sufficient return to justify the risks of investment.
B. The Respondent’s Argument

304. Spain essentially adopts the reasoning of the Spanish Supreme Court in justifying the limits

on RD 661/2007 compensation. The Supreme Court reasoned as follows:

EER RR
I think we've done a very significant amount of work already. The incremental work that would be involved
in not just doing two valuation exercises and a lost profits thing, but replicating that at a series of different
points in time, would mean producing reports that are potentially four times the size or five times the size of
the ones we have already.
Tr. Day 4, (Edwards), p. 164:1-19 to p. 166:1- 12.
250 Frontier Petroleum Services Ltd. v. Czech Republic, UNCITRAL, Final Award, 12 November 2010, para. 285,
Exhibit CL-031; see also Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. v. United Mexican States, \CSID Case No.
ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003, para. 154, Exhibit CL-015.

102

One of said implicit constraints is that the promotional measures (in this
case, the receipt of a very favourable regulated tariff) cannot be regarded
as “lifelong” or unlimited over time. It is not reasonable to assume that
Royal Decree 661/2007 guarantees the receipt of the regulated tariff for an
infinite period, in other words, without any time limit. On the contrary,
even when there is talk —in its original version — of a period “subsequent”
to the 25 years, it can easily be assumed that this implicitly set as a ceiling
or termination the final date of the working life of the photovoltaic
facilities, taken as an average, a time frame which, according to the
majority of technical opinions issued at that time — in particular, according
to the estimates of the Institute for the Diversification and Saving of
Energy — did not exceed thirty years (including within this timeframe any
appropriate preventive and corrective maintenance operations)...

Even when in some unique cases said reference period could, in the future,
exceed 30 years, the attendant official economic remuneration calculations
must comply with the average of the whole...7°!

305. The Claimant is not deprived of any of the assets acquired through investment that it chose
to retain. It has always earned at least a “reasonable return” on the invested funds which is all that

Spain ever offered.

306. The “clawback” was a legitimate response to the excess profits obtained by the Claimant

prior to 2014.
Cc. The Tribunal Rules the Claimant’s Legitimate Expectations Were Frustrated
307. The Tribunal concludes that:

(a) Spain’s representation of non-retroactivity in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 was
clear and specific (excluding the potential adjustments referred to in RD

661/2007 itself);

(b) the Claimant’s legitimate expectation under RD 1578/2008 in respect of the

Formifiena plant did not include the irrevocability of the existing tariff;

(c) the Claimant’s expectations of tariff stability were reasonable and legitimate in

the circumstances;

251 Judgment from the Third Chamber of the Supreme Court, 12 April 201, rec. 40/2011, EDJ 2012/65328, Exhibit R-
0125.

103

(d) the Claimant reasonably relied upon Spain’s representation when it made its

investment; and
(e) in the result, the Claimant suffered the loss complained of.

308. Of course, in addition to deciding that its legitimate expectations have been frustrated by
the host State, a claimant must also prove a breach of the FET standard. The former does not
necessarily lead to the latter. “Legitimate expectations” based upon a specific representation are
only “a relevant factor” in assessing whether or not the Respondent violated the FET standard in

Article 10(1) of the ECT.2%2

309. Having rejected the Respondent’s view that the extent of the Claimant’s legitimate
expectation was limited to a “reasonable rate of return”, and having accepted the Claimant’s
interpretation of RD 661/2007, and Mr. Giuliani’s evidence of the actual expectation the Claimant
possessed, and the reasonableness of the Claimant’s reliance in the circumstances, the Tribunal
concludes that the Respondent denied the Claimant fair and equitable treatment. In this respect,
the Tribunal substantially adopts the list of violations alleged by the Claimant set out in paragraphs

299 to 301 above.

310. At the same time, the Tribunal notes that the Claimant’s Formifiena plant, was not
registered until 23 March 2011, after the date for potential revision (2010) contemplated in RD
1578/2008. There was therefore no breach of fair and equitable treatment in relation to the

Formifiena plant.

D. The Tribunal Rules that the Frustration of the Claimant’s Legitimate Expectation
Violated the Standard of Fair and Equitable Treatment

311. The financial vulnerability of renewable energy projects is the heavy up-front capital costs.
Once money is “sunk” in the PV facilities, the funds of the developer (and its bankers) are locked
into the FIT contracts with their investments effectively (as the Claimant put it) long-term
hostages. If energy prices rise, the benefit accrues to Spain not the operators who, in Spain’s view,

will recover only what Spain unilaterally declares to be a reasonable return by reference to the

282 Glamis Gold, Ltd. v. The United States of America, UNCITRAL (1976), 8 June 2009, Exhibit CL-0011.
104

bond market. On the other hand, if energy prices fall, Spain claims the right to resile from what
the Tribunal has concluded was a regulatory guarantee of price stability. Spain’s position is that it
alone should benefit from rising prices, but the burden of falling prices is to be off-loaded onto
investors. As a matter of Spanish domestic law, such treatment of local investors has been held to
be constitutional, but in the Tribunal’s view, such one-sided treatment is neither fair nor equitable.
Under the ECT, the Claimant, as a foreign investor, was entitled to fair and equitable treatment

and in this case did not receive it.

PART 7(3). DID SPAIN BREACH THE FET STANDARD BY FAILING TO TREAT THE
CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENTS TRANSPARENTLY AND FREE FROM IMPAIRMENT
BY UNREASONABLE OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES

312. A State’s duty of “transparency” requires the legal framework that will apply to an

investment to be readily apparent. 7° Article 10(1) of the ECT provides in part that:

(1) Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of this
Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a commitment to
accord at all times to Investments of Investors of other Contracting Parties
fair and equitable treatment. Such Investments shall also enjoy the most
constant protection and security and no Contracting Party shall in any way
impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal. (emphasis added)

A. The Claimant’s Argument

313. A State may violate the “fair and equitable treatment” standard either by violating an
investor’s “legitimate expectations” or by failing to treat an investor or its investment
transparently and free from impairment by unreasonable or discriminatory measures. The
Claimant, citing Metalclad, argues that, “investors must be able to know and understand the legal
regime that will govern their investments...[T]here should be no room for doubt or uncertainty

on such matters.”?*4 The Claimant points to Micula v. Romania as an example of a tribunal

283 See Rudolf Dolzer and Christoph Schreuer, Principles of International Investment Law, pp. 149-151 (2d ed. 2012),
Exhibit CL-O18.

284 Metalclad Corp. v. United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Award, 30 August 2000, para. 76, Exhibit
CL-029.

105

finding that a State may violate the “fair and equitable treatment” standard twice — first by
undermining “legitimate expectations” and second by failing to act transparently and
consistently.?>> Thus, “legitimate expectations” and “transparency/consistency” are “stand alone”
claims the Claimant argues, and it says, the violation of either of them gives rise to liability under

the ECT and international law.

314. Spain replaced the “clear and transparent pricing formulas” under RD 661/2007 and
RD 1578/2008 with remuneration under the New Regulatory Regime based on the general notion

of a “reasonable rate of return,” which pursuant to MO 1945, is to be determined by reference
to various formulas (one of over 578 “standard” PV installations) which can be revised and

imposed on existing facilities at Spain’s discretion.?°

315. Spain thereby made the investment environment entirely uncertain, unreasonable, and
future remuneration impossible to predict. That uncertainty led to an unsatisfactory sale price
for 9REN’s Solaica plants that was only a fraction of what they would have been worth without

Spain’s revisionist measures.

316. Interms of discrimination, the Claimant contends that not only is the TVPEE not a genuine
tax, but it discriminates between renewable and conventional energy producers. The so-called
“tax” discriminated against renewable energy producers like JREN. When a tax is imposed on
producers who sell their goods in a competitive market, the producers typically can pass on some
portion — often a large portion — of the tax to consumers. Tariff rates, however, were fixed by law,
such that 9REN’s plants could not increase prices to pass on the “tax” to consumers.”?°”

317. Spain’s regulatory activity 2010 to 2013 is precisely the opposite of the sort of rational,
balanced decision-making process that the LG&E tribunal required for a State to fulfill its

obligations under the impairment clause.

255 Joan Micula et al. v. Romania, (CSID Case No. ARB/05/20, Award, 11 December 2013, para. 872, Exhibit CL-
020; see also Franck Charles Arif v. Republic of Moldova, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/23, Award, 8 April 2013, para.
557, Exhibit CL-028.

256 In addition to the 3- and 6-year reviews mandated under the New Regulatory Regime, under Act 24/2013,
Claimant’s investments are also subject to further payment reductions as needed to cover Spain’s long-running
tariff deficit. Law 24/2013, C-180. This allows Spain to unilaterally decide if and when it would like to reduce
tariffs in the future, further underlining the lack of transparency pervasive in the New Regulatory Regime.

257 Claimant’s Memorial, para. 263.

106

B. The Respondent’s Position

318. Spain notes the Claimant’s acknowledgement that the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
regimes were “clear and transparent”. In Spain’s view, the New Regulatory Regime could hardly
be more specific and detailed. All told, MO 1045 is a 1,761-page document that defines parameters
for 1,517 different “standard installations,” including 578 “standard installations” in the PV sector

alone.?°* In its quantum report, the Claimant’ s expert FTI acknowledged that:

[flor PV plants, an IT Code existed for every possible combination of the
factors set out above. For example, the IT Code IT-00014 was assigned to
any PV plant that: (i) was granted its final commissioning certificate in
2007; (ii) was registered under RD 661; (iii) used single axis trackers; and
(iv) had an installed capacity of less than or equal to SkW. If a plant
matching all of these characteristics was granted its final commissioning
certificate one year later in 2008, it would have been assigned a different
IT Code (IT-00015).”°

319. Spain argues that it spelled out in meticulous detail the compensation rules complained of
by the Claimant. Moreover, for the reason previously explained, the disputed measures were
neither discriminatory nor arbitrary in light of the “tariff deficit” and the general financial situation

in which Spain found itself.
Cc. The Tribunal’s Ruling on Transparency and Discrimination

320. The Claimant’s case rests on RD 661/2007 (and perhaps RD 1578/2008) being a clear,
specific and binding representation. Thus, they are “transparent”. The fact that under the New
Regulatory Regime, regulated tariffs now may be varied from time to time in accordance with
stated criteria under MO 1045, does not mean the New Regulatory Regime lacks transparency.
Different regulators adopt different methodologies. Complexity is not necessarily the enemy of

transparency. Complexity may simply be a function of the subject matter.

258 See MO 1045, Preamble, Exhibit C-179. Although MO 1045 formally entered into force on the day following its
publication in the Official Gazette, the provisions included therein were actually effective as of 14 July 2013, the date
of entry into force of RDL 9/2013. Remunerations received by the installations from 14 July 2013 to 21 June 2014
were in the form of payments on account, which should be regularized in the first nine assessments carried out pursuant
to the new remuneration scheme.

259 FTI First Quantum Report, para. 3.35.

107

321. The fact that MO 1045, issued in conjunction with the New Regulatory Regime, attempts
to address in an explicit way the different variables in arriving at compensation levels is not an
ECT violation. The fact the Claimant disagrees with parts of the methodology does not rob Spain

of its regulatory authority.

322. The financial crash of 2008/2009, now known as the Great Recession, created serious
challenges. As the Claimant’s expert testified on cross-examination by Ms. Rivas Kortazar:

Q. In this paragraph -- and I am reading out loud -- you establish: “Clearly

there are legitimate policy concerns that might lead a government to keep

prices low, in particular for the most vulnerable consumers and for

companies facing international competition.” So do you agree that it's a

legitimate policy concern to protect somehow vulnerable consumers and
the competitiveness?

A. (Dr Moselle) That's what the sentence says. So, yes, that's exactly what
we say.

323. Aregulatory measure rationally connected to a legitimate State objective, where the means
chosen are proportionate to achievement of the objective which Spain says was avoidance of SES
insolvency, is neither unreasonable nor arbitrary. The Tribunal also rejects 9REN’s argument that
the regulatory regime 2010 to 2014 lacked transparency within the limits permitted by the ECT.
Whether Spain’s “disputed measures” violated other provisions of Article 10(1) is of course a

different question.

324. The Claimant’s argument on discrimination relates to the incidence of the TVPEE tax,
which, as explained above, is withdrawn from the Tribunal’s jurisdiction by Article 21 of the ECT

and is, in any event, unconvincing.

325. The Tribunal accordingly rejects the Claimant’s argument on transparency and

discrimination.
PART 7(4). THE UMBRELLA CLAUSE

326. The ECT provides in Article 10(1) in part as follows:

2Tr, Day 4, (Moselle) p. 141:23 to p. 142 8.
108

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into
with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting
Party. (emphasis added)

327. The expression “any” obligations is very broad. The Claimant asserts and Spain denies, that
obligations undertaken through law or regulation (and not just contractual obligations) fall within

its scope.2°!
A. The Claimant’s Argument

328. Investment treaty tribunals have adopted broad interpretations of similarly worded
umbrella clauses, finding that they cover not only contractual obligations, but also obligations
undertaken through law or regulation.” For example, in LG&E v. Argentina, the tribunal
considered that the obligations undertaken by Argentina under its Gas Law and its regulatory tariff
scheme “were not legal obligations of a general nature [but] were very specific in relation to
LG&E’s investment in Argentina so that their abrogation would be a violation of the umbrella
clause.” As in the LG&E case, Spain’s incentive tariffs were not of a general nature; rather,
they were individually granted to specific photovoltaic plants that qualified under the terms
of the legal regime, were granted a Final Commissioning Certificate, and were individually

registered in the RAIPRE. In the case of Formifiena, the fixed tariff rate was confirmed by

261 Tt is common ground that umbrella clauses cover contractual obligations. See Plama Consortium Limited v.
Bulgaria, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/24, Award, 27 August 2008, para. 187, Exhibit CL-042; Bosh Int’l, Inc. and

244, 246 (“The plain meaning- the “ordinary” meaning” — of a provision prescribing that a State “shall observe

certain type, but “any” —that is to say, all- obligations entered into with regard to investments of investors of the

Spain upon the facility’s enrollment in the pre-allocation registry. Spain’s grant of specific rights
was limited to those investors, like the Claimant, who properly qualified their individual plants

under the regime.”

329. Similarly, in Khan Resources v. Mongolia, the tribunal held that a breach by Mongolia of
any provision of its Foreign Investment Law would constitute a breach of the ECT’s “umbrella

clause.” The tribunal concluded that Mongolia had breached its Foreign Investment Law and

was therefore “liable towards the Investor through operation of the umbrella clause.”

330. The tribunal in Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan confirmed that the umbrella clause in the ECT
“is broadly stated, referring as it does to ‘any obligation’ and, as such, by the ordinary meaning
of the words, includes both statutory and contractual obligations.””°’ In Plama v. Bulgaria,
the tribunal analyzed the ordinary meaning of the term “any obligation” in the last sentence of

Article 10(1) of the ECT and concluded that its wide ambit encompassed “any obligation

regardless of its nature, i.e., whether it be contractual or statutory.”?°°

331. With respect to the facts, the Claimant contends that RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
created a number of explicit obligations regarding the tariffs that Spain undertook to pay for the

electricity produced by qualifying facilities:

. the obligation to pay “the compensation provided in the economic regime [of RD

661/2007 and RD 1578/2008]” to the Claimant’s facilities “for the total or partial

264 The Claimant also notes, curiously, that according to Professor Aragén, RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 granted
specific property rights under Spanish law to eligible investors, including Claimant. (Aragén First Expert Report at 16,
26, 41-43) Elsewhere the Claimant argues that Spanish law is irrelevant to the modification issues.

“an obligation for the State to constantly guarantee observance of its commitments entered into with respect to
investments of investors of the other party. The obligation has no limitations on its face — it apparently applies to all
such commitments, whether established by contract or by law, unilaterally or bilaterally, etc.”

to, the Claimant says, RD 1578/2008);

. the obligation to pay fixed tariffs of 44.0381c€ to the Claimant’s El Paso, El
Soldado, La Gineta II, Siruela, Gibrale6n and Yecla facilities and 41.75c€ to
the Claimant’s Alcaudete plant, per kWh of electricity produced for the first

twenty-five years of those facilities’ operation (Article 36 of RD 661/2007);

. the obligation to pay fixed tariffs of 35.2305c€ per kWh of electricity produced
by the Claimant’s El Paso, El Soldado, La Gineta IT, Siruela, Gibraleén and Yecla
facilities and 33.400c€ per kW of electricity produced by the Claimant’s Alcaudete
plant, for the remaining operating lives of those facilities (Article 36 of RD

661/2007);

. the obligation to pay fixed tariffs of 0.2908570c€ to Formifiena PV facility per
kWh of electricity produced for the first twenty-five years of operation (Article
11 of RD 1578/2008 and the specific resolution issued to Formifiena upon

enrollment in the RD 1578/2008 pre-allocation registry);

. the obligation to update the value of the RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 tariffs
“on an annual basis using as a reference the increase in the CPI” (Article 44.1

of RD 661/2007 and Article 12 of RD 1578/2008); and

. the obligation to ensure that “revisions to the regulated tariff...shall not affect
facilities for which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior
to 1 January of the second year following the year in which the revision shall
have been performed” (Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, which the Claimant argues
is also applicable to RD 1578/2008).

332. Starting in 2010, Spain began to violate the obligations it had undertaken in respect of

the Claimant’s investments, progressively reducing the remuneration it had agreed to provide in

its

regulatory framework and in specific commitments regarding 9REN’s facilities. In

661/2007 incentives according to the CPI;2” and

(e) 2013-2014 “New Regulatory Regime” violated Spain’s obligation to pay fixed

incentive rates for the lifetime of plant operation.”
The Respondent’s Argument

3. The Claimant errs in stressing the word “any”, which due to its broad nature, would open

the floodgates to all types of state activity to be included in the concept of obligations. The words

“entered into” in the last sentence in Article 10(1) of the ECT require a State’s assumption of

specific obligations regarding a certain investor or a certain investment.?”°

RD 661/2007, Article 17 provides that:
[P]roprietors of production facilities under the special regime shall enjoy the following rights:...
(c) Receive, for the total or partial sale of their net electrical energy generated under any of the options
appearing in Article 24.1, the compensation provided in the economic regime set out by this Royal

Citing Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania where the tribunal concluded:

 

...considering the wording of...“any obligation [a party] may have entered into with regard to investments,”
it is difficult not to regard thi clear reference to investment contracts. In fact, one may ask what other
obligations can the parties have had in mind as having been “entered into” by a host State with regard to an
investment. The employment of the notion “entered into” indicates that specific commitments are referred to

   

112

334. The words “entered into” appear, in context, as “...obligations it [the host State] entered
into with an Investor.” The ECT was signed in multiple languages. The French reads “respecte les
obligations qu’elle a contractées vis-a-vis du’un investisseur”; and the Spanish reads: “cumplird
las obligaciones que haya contraido con los inversores.” All these terms suggest that a bilateral

obligation must have been agreed between the investor and the host State.

335. The Claimant wrongly invokes the award of Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria as a precedent

in its favour. The Plama tribunal held explicitly that:

Since the Parties are exclusively concerned with the application of the last
sentence of Article 10(1) ECT to [contractual obligations], the Tribunal
need not extend its analysis any further.?”°

336. Equally Khan Resources v. Mongolia is distinguished because in that case the Foreign
Investment Law was passed specifically for foreign investors. Therefore, the obligations analyzed
in the award do not arise from regulations of general nature, erga omnes, as is the case here. RD

661/2007 is a regulation applicable to any investor, regardless of nationality.

337. The Claimant's stance is not supported by Al-Bahloul v. Tajikistan either. Reading the

entire paragraph from which the Claimant extracts the quote in fact undermines the Claimant’s

position:?””

This protection is broadly stated, referring as it does to “any obligation”
and, as such, by the ordinary meaning of the words, includes both statutory
and contractual obligations. The ICSID Ad Hoc Committee, in annulling
the decision in CMS v Argentina, took a narrower view and considered

and not general commitments, for example, by way of legislative acts. This is also the reason why Art. II
(2)(c) would be very much an empty base unless understood as referring to contracts...

that the words “entered into” suggest that the obligation is limited to those
of a consensual nature. In both cases, however, it is clear that the
obligation must have been entered into “with” an Investor or an Investment
of an Investor. Therefore, this provision does not refer to general
obligations of the State arising as a matter of law.’ (emphasis added)

338. Equally, AMTO v. Ukraine?” concerned the question of whether a contractual obligation
undertaken by the State with a parent company could be extended to a subsidiary. In the present

case, there is no allegation of any contractual obligation between the Claimant and Spain.

339. The Claimant also invokes various awards involving Argentina including LG&E v.
Argentina and Enron v. Argentina.?*° But in these cases there were specific commitments between

the State and investors by way of concessions or licences

340. The Claimant also cites Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania, but that award indicates, to the
contrary, that

the employment of the notion “entered into” indicates that specific

commitments are referred to and not general commitments, for example

by way of legislative acts. This is also the reason why Article II (2)(c)

would be very much an empty base [sic] unless understood as referring to
contracts. ..78!

341. The Claimant’s claims under the umbrella clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT should

therefore be dismissed.
Cc. The Tribunal’s Ruling on the Umbrella Clause

342. The Tribunal is sensitive to the implications of Spain’s “floodgates” argument. The ECT
uses the term “any obligation”. The term “any obligation” must be interpreted according to the
words used in Article 10(1) of the ECT. It is used in the context of an obligation “entered into” by
the State “with an Investor’. That context is apt for a bilateral contract, such as a concession or

licence agreement. It is not apt to describe a State’s public legislation or administrative regulations.

A State does not “enter into” such legislation with a private party. In any event, a legitimate
expectation, divorced from its anchorage in the FET standard, is itself not a free standing

“obligation” in the sense of Article 10(1) of the ECT.

343. The Claimant’s case has been pleaded throughout as a “legitimate expectations” case based

on

(a) Spain undertaking to accept the “total or partial” output of the Claimant’s RD
661/2007 plants in accordance with the prescribed FIT tariff and terms. There was

to be no limitation with respect to operating hours or imposition of an access toll;

(b) the obligation was to continue for a period of 25 years and at 80% thereof for the
balance of the useful life of the facility. The Tribunal notes that “the useful life of

the facility” is undefined;
(c) to adjust compensation by reference to an objective CPI.

344. On the other hand, the Tribunal has concluded that Spain did not assume any obligation to

the Claimant
(a) to refrain from imposing the 7% TVPEE tax;
(b) to refrain from modification of the compensation payable under RD 1578/2008.

345. In the circumstances, it would be both problematic and superfluous to give effect to the
Claimant’s argument under the umbrella clause; problematic because it would conflate an
investor’s protection under FET with the protection sought to be extended by the umbrella clause
and twist the latter out of shape, and it would be superfluous because the umbrella clause adds

nothing in the way of relief to what has already been granted under FET.

346. The Claimant contends that “there is an additional level of obligations in the form of the

192i

RAIPRE registration for each of 9REN’s investments”?*” but on this point, the Tribunal agrees

282 Claimant’ s Closing Argument, Slide 2. The Claimant relies on the evidence in cross-examination of Spain’s legal
expert, Professor Vaquer:

115

with Spain that RAIPRE registration is just an administrative precondition to the FIT benefits and

not a source of those benefits.”

PART 7(5). EXPROPRIATION

347. The issue is whether the cumulative effect of all of Spain’s measures was to

substantially deprive the Claimant of its investment in the PV facilities. The issues are:
. was there any expropriation?
e if so, was it lawful?

A. The Claimant’s Argument

348. Investment treaty jurisprudence is replete with support for the principle that discrete
legal rights — be they rights to money or otherwise — are independent “investments” capable

of expropriation in cases where the relevant treaty defines “investments” to include such

rights.?*4

349. A measure is expropriatory when a State interferes with a protected investment in a way
that significantly or substantially deprives the investor of the use, benefit, or value of the

investment, to an extent that is more than ephemeral.

Q. Could a plant benefit from the economic regime of RD 661 without having obtained registration in the
RAIPRE?
A. It shouldn’t have. It shouldn't have, because the royal decree said: prior registration in the RAIPRE.
Tr. Day 3, (Vaquer) p. 212:4-8.
?83 As indeed seemed to be the position of the Claimant’s legal expert, Professor Aragon:
...the right to the remuneration has its source of course in the regulation, in 661 itself, but it enters into force,
it is enforced for the operator of an i ion when their installation is regi d. And the lation is
very clear: it is a necessary condition to operate under the remuneration regime of this royal decree, it is a
necessary condition to be registered with RAIPRE. This is perfectly clear, unequivocal. If this condition is
not met, the subjective right to benefit from that regime is not in existence.
Tr. Day 3, (Aragon) pp. 104:5-15.
°84 Further, at least one scholar has argued that “a taking of acquired rights...is considered as much as a wrong a
taking or destruction of tangible property. The taking of acquired rights entitles the victim to_compensation.” Lone

116

350. International tribunals have held that the form of the measures is not decisive of
whether an expropriation has occurred: the measures may vary from an immediate and
comprehensive taking to a series of measures that gradually chips away an investment’s value
by incremental steps, culminating in a substantial deprivation of the investment (often referred
to as “creeping expropriation”).”*° In short: “Expropriation can be direct, indirect, regulatory,
creeping, de facto, or a government act may be ‘tantamount to,’ ‘equivalent to,’ or ‘have similar

effects as’ expropriation.”°”

351. As a matter of international law, it is not necessary that Spain expropriate the entire
business operation to have violated Article 13 of the ECT.*** For example, in Middle East
Cement, the tribunal separately analyzed whether the claimant’s license, its tangible property (in
that case, a ship), and other rights that qualified as “investments” had been expropriated, reaching

different conclusions based on the impact of the State’s measures on each separate

2015, para. 118, Exhibit CL-053 (acknowledging that “good-will” and “know-how” — as covered investments — are
capable of being expropriated). Moreover, the concept of partial expropriation exists under international law, as
demonstrated in the Guidelines for the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment, adopted by the Development
Committee of the Board of Governors of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which states: “A
State may not expropriate or otherwise take in whole or in part a foreign private investment in its territory, or take
measures which have similar effects...” (Guidelines on the Treatment of Foreign Direct Investment Issued by the
Development Committee, 7 ICSID REV.-F.LL.J. 295 (1992), s. IV (emphasis added), Exhibit CL-060) While the form
of expropriatory measures may vary, the determining factor as to whether an expropriation has occurred is the
consequential impact of the measures on the investor’s “investment.” The question is whether the investor has been
deprived — in whole or in substantial part — of the use, benefit, or value of its “investment.” See e.g., Técnicas
Medioambientales Tecmed, S.A. v. United Mexican States, ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award, 29 May 2003,

investment.”*? Further, in Eureko v. Poland, the tribunal found that the claimant’s right to
acquire further shares in a company was an investment capable of being expropriated, although

the underlying business operation remained unaffected by the state’s expropriatory measures.?”°

352. The EnCana v. Ecuador tribunal reached a similar conclusion with respect to
expropriation of claimant’s “claims to money.”?*! That case concerned claims for the refund
of VAT in connection with contracts for the exploration and exploitation of oil and gas. The
tribunal first rejected a claim that the overall business operation had been expropriated.?” It
then proceeded to examine separately the question of whether the denial of the VAT refund
amounted to an expropriation of that specific right.’ Noting that the applicable bilateral
investment treaty contained “claims to money” in its definition of “investment,” the tribunal
found that “a law which cancels a liability the State already has to an investor...is capable of
amounting to expropriation.”*?> The Claimant argues that its rights under its FIT contracts amount
to property rights.?°°

353. Specifically, RD 661/2007 conferred a bundle of rights on seven of 9REN’s projects as
set out in Articles 17, 36, and 44 of RD 661/2007. For its part, RD 1578/2008 provided
similar rights to a fixed tariff for twenty-five years for 9REN’s Formifiena plant. Professor
Aragon testified that rights granted to those facilities under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 were

legal rights under Spanish law and protected as such.?%”

354. Spain substantially interfered with 9REN’s rights to receive the full value of the RD
661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 tariffs on all of the electricity that its facilities produced when,

between 2010 and 2013, Spain enacted the disputed measures previously discussed.?*

355. Those acts of substantial interference” were followed by Spain’s abrogation of RD
661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 in their entirety in 2013/2014, with the New Regulatory Regime

which entirely deprived the Claimant of each of its rights under the aforementioned regimes.

356. For all of these reasons, Spain expropriated the Claimant’s “investments” in the sense
of Article 13 of the ECT. Moreover, the expropriation was unlawful, because it did not satisfy
each of the four cumulative requirements for a lawful expropriation contained in Article 13 of the
ECT. The Tribunal should therefore conclude that Spain’s measures violated Article 13 of the
ECT.

B. The Respondent’s Position

357. Spain contends that a regulatory modification that affects the value of a right does not
amount to an expropriation of that right and is well within the sovereign regulatory power of the

State.

358. There has been no expropriation. The photovoltaic plants are guaranteed by statute a
reasonable rate of return, protected from market uncertainty and fluctuations. An investment that

remains in the possession and control of the investor with a reasonable rate of return guaranteed

28 FTI First Quantum Report, para. 8.

2” It is well-accepted that a host state may “interfere” with the investor’s property through regulatory actions,
including through taxation measures, which can amount to expropriation. At least one tribunal has found a state
liable for expropriation when the state interfered with an investor's rights under a license, while the license itself
remained with the investor and was not itself expropriated. Furthermore, a government decree or pronouncement
that makes clear that the investor will not be able to exploit its investment in the future may be expropriatory if it
deprives the investor of the ability to make reasonable use of the property or sell the investment at a reasonable price.
See Yukos Universal Limited (Isle af Man) v. The Russian Federation, UNCITRAL, PCA Case No. AA 227,
Award, 18 July 2014 paras. 1579, 1580, Exhibit CL-071; Restatement (Third) of the Foreign Relations Law of the

by law cannot be considered expropriated, despite being deprived in part of its hoped-for

regulatory premium.

359. Future returns on an investment do not qualify as ‘“‘an asset” subject to expropriation within
the terms of Article 13(3) of the ECT. The Claimant does not “possess or control directly or
indirectly” the returns it expected to receive in future via a tariff regulated under the Spanish

legislative framework within the meaning of Article 1(6) of the ECT.

360. According to Spain, the Claimant is consistently wrong in denying the importance of
Spanish law. Any investment capable of being expropriated must consist in a right or asset that is
duly constituted, defined, formed and recognised under the laws of the host State.> This is so
because the international law on expropriation is only concerned with the protection of property

rights or other economic interests and does not regulate the process of the creation of such

rights.*°!

361. The Claimant had an acquired right to receive only the remuneration under RD 661/2007
in relation to energy already sold. Under no circumstances was there an acquired right capable of

expropriation to a future income stream.*°”

To assess the nature of these rights in a case of alleged expropriation of contractual rights, one must look to
the domestic law under which the rights were created. AASA’s and the Claimants’ contractual rights in the

paras. 494, 458 and 459, Exhibit RL-0049. As the Charanne tribunal held:
The subject of the investment were [sic] not the returns, but rather the company X...an investment protected
under Article 1(6) must be owned or controlled by the investor, and that the Claimants neither own nor control
the future returns on the plants, which do not constitute vested rights. Therefore, the Tribunal considers that
the Claimants invested in shares (Article 1(6)(b) ECT), and not in returns.

  

 

 

  

120

362. Inany event, the contested measures are regulatory acts that do not generate the obligation
to compensate. They result from Spain’s power to legislate in the public interest in a highly
regulated industry. State acts are not subject to compensation when they are an expression of the

police powers of the State.*°*

363. Arbitration tribunals that have interpreted the ECT have shown that, in order for Article
13(1) to characterize a measure as equivalent to expropriation, it must prevent the investor from
continuing to enjoy its investment or from using it, or it must restrict some property right attaching

to the investment in a severe and devastating manner.*°*

364. Despite the Claimant’s litany of complaints, it is assured recovery of the cost of the
investment and the operating costs and is guaranteed a reasonable rate of return linked to the 10-
year Spanish bond plus 300 basis points. The challenged measures are neither disproportionate nor

unreasonable in relation to the objective they are intended to achieve.

365. In AES v. Hungary, the tribunal ruled that, as AES maintained control over AES and
continued to profit from its investment, the measures adopted by Hungary could not be considered

measures equivalent to expropriation.*”°

303 UNCTAD Expropriation Report, p. 78, Exhibit RL-0030.

* In Electrabel S.A. v. the Republic of Hungary, the tribunal established that the measures adopted by Hungary, as
they neither prevented Electrabel from continuing to operate the plant, nor prevented it from operating on the
Hungarian electricity market, could not be considered measures equivalent to an expropriation under Article 13 ECT:

 

As regards indirect expropriation, the Tribunal considers that the wording of Article 13(1) ECT requires
Electrabel to establish that...its investment lost all significant economic value with the PPA’s early
termination...In short, the Tribunal considers that the accumulated mass of international legal materials,
comprising both arbitral decisions and doctrinal writings, describe for both direct and indirect expropriation,
ently albeit in different terms, the requirement under international law for the investor to establish the
tial, radical, severe, devastating or fundamental deprivation of its rights or the virtual annihilation,
‘ion or factual destruction of its investment, its value or enjoyment...Conversely, arbitral
tribunals have rejected claims for expropriation under international law where the investor has failed to meet
this test for “substantial” deprivation... .the Tribunal also interprets the terms of Article 13(1) ECT as requiring
Electrabel to meet the test for substantial deprivation both for direct expropriation and indirect expropriation
having the equivalent effect to direct expropriation or nationalisation.

a State’s act that has a negative effect on an investment cannot automatically be considered an expropriation.
For an expropriation to occur, it is necessary for the investor to be deprived, in whole or significant part, of

 

  
    

 

 

 

121

366. The El Paso v. Argentina award held:

...for an expropriation to exist, the investor should be substantially
deprived not only of the benefits, but also of the use of its investment. A
mere loss of value, which is not the result of an interference with the
control or use of the investment, is not an indirect expropriation.*”
(emphasis added)

 

 

367. Likewise, the Charanne case requires a loss equal to deprivation of ownership:

465. ...For a measure to be considered equivalent to an expropriation, its
effects have to be so significant that it can be considered that the investor
has been deprived, in full or in part, of its investment. Therefore, a mere
decrease in the value of the shares subject to the investment cannot
qualify as an indirect expropriation, unless the loss of value is such that
it could be considered equivalent to a deprivation of property.*”” (emphasis
added)

368. In summary, the challenged measures did not take control of the shares or management of
the Claimant’s plants, or destroy the value of the operating companies. Therefore, (i) the Claimant
continues to control its shares in the Plants, (ii) the plants continue to operate, producing and selling
photovoltaic energy on the market, and (iii) the Claimant continues to obtain a reasonable rate of
return from the plants. The future returns from the plants do not fall under the concept of an
investment protected under Article 1(6) ECT. The Claimant does not “possess or control directly
or indirectly” the returns it expects to receive in future via tariffs regulated under the Spanish

legislative framework.

the property in or effective control of its investment: or for its investment to be deprived, in whole or
significant part, of its value.
But, in this case, the amendment of the 2001 Electricity Act and the issuance of the Price Decrees did not
interfere with the ownership or use of Claimants’ property. Claimants retained at all times the control of the
AES Tisza II plant, thus there was no deprivation of Claimants’ ownership or control of their investment.
Moreover, Claimants continued to receive substantial revenues...which proves that the value of their
investment was not substantially diminished and that they were not deprived of the whole or a significant
part of the value of their investments.
In these circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the effects of the reintroduction of the Price Decrees do
not amount to an expropriation of Claimants’ investment(s). (emphasis added)

Cc. The Tribunal’s Ruling with Respect to Expropriation

369. The Claimant’s investments are properly characterized as corporate shares. The
downstream operating companies had a right to revenue from electricity sold to the SES, but the
Claimant did not itself have any right to the income stream, though the value of its shares was
directly or indirectly impacted by a modification of the income stream. Nevertheless, when the
Claimant speaks of expropriation as distinguished from loss of value (or at least loss of value
mounting to virtual destruction), the Tribunal must focus on the fate of the shares held by the
Claimant as investments. The Claimant does not allege a loss of control of the shares. Nor does it
dispute that it continued to hold the shares until the sale of five plants to Sun European S.A.R.L.

(“Sun European”) in 2015. That was a voluntary alienation.

370. While regulatory modifications between 2010 and 2014 significantly reduced the share
value, the reduction in value is better analyzed in terms of a violation of the Claimant’s legitimate
expectation. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds a number of the authorities cited by the Claimant as

distinguishable and of little assistance.

371. In Deutsche Bank v. Sri Lanka, for example the tribunal found that State measures to
prevent payments owed to the claimant constituted an expropriation. Deutsche Bank claimed that
Sri Lanka had expropriated its rights to payments owed under a Hedging Agreement. The Sri
Lankan Supreme Court issued an order that no further payments should be made under the Hedging
Agreement, an act that “deprived Deutsche Bank of the economic value of the Hedging
Agreement since it was deprived as a matter of fact and under Sri Lankan law of payment under
the Hedging Agreement.”*°* Spain has never denied payments. It has reduced the value of the
Claimant’s shares, but the income stream still represents a return in the order of 7.9% (depending

of course on the variables, as will be discussed under quantum).

372. Inthe circumstances, the Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s allegation that its investment was

expropriated.

2012, para. 521, Exhibit CL-073.

PART 8. QUANTUM

373. The only explicit guidance to quantum in the ECT concerns expropriation in Article 13.
The Tribunal has concluded that there has been no expropriation. In the case of other violations of
the ECT, resort is had to the customary international law principle of full compensation.*”? There
is no real dispute about the measure of applicable compensation. The Claimant is still entitled to
“reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish
the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been committed.”?!°
As stated in Article 31 of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States of International Wrongful

Acts,

Article 31. Reparation

1. The responsible State is under an obligation to make full reparation for
the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the
internationally wrongful act of a State.

374. In AAPL v. Sri Lanka, the tribunal held that Sri Lanka had violated its obligation to provide

full protection and security and stated:

Both Parties are equally in agreement about the principle, according to
which, in case of property destruction, the amount of the
compensation due has to be calculated in a manner that adequately
reflects the full value of the investment lost as a result of said destruction
and the damages incurred as a result thereof.*'! (emphasis added)

375. The tribunal in Vivendi v. Argentina observed that “[b]ased on these principles, and absent
limiting terms in the relevant treaty, it is generally accepted today that, regardless of the type

of investment, and regardless of the nature of the illegitimate measure, the level of damages

awarded in international investment arbitration is supposed to be sufficient to compensate the

affected party fully and to eliminate the consequences of the state’s action.”?!”

376. As mentioned, these basic principles for the assessment of compensation are not in dispute.
They are grounded in the decision the Permanent Court of International Justice in the case of
Chorzéw Factory between Germany and Poland, which dealt with Poland’s unlawful seizure of
a factory owned by a German national. The Permanent Court of International Justice held in a

passage already cited in part:

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal act —
a principle which seems to be established by international practice and in
particular by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must,
as far as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and
re-establish the situation which would, in all probability, have existed
if that act had not been committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not
possible, payment of a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution
in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained
which would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place
of it — such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount
of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.*' (emphasis
added)

377. The customary international law principle is regularly applied by arbitral tribunals, as in

the decision of the Iran-US Claims Tribunal in Amoco v. Iran which held:

[Chorzéw Factory] is widely regarded as the most authoritative
exposition of the principles applicable in this field and is still valid
today...[unlawful] expropriation gives rise to an obligation of reparation
of all the damages sustained by the owner of expropriated property... The
rules of international law relating to international responsibility of States
apply in such a case. They provide for restitutio in integrum: restitution
in kind or, if impossible, its monetary equivalent. If need be, “damages
for loss sustained which would not be covered by restitution” should
also be awarded. *4

A. Quantification of Compensation

378. The Claimant seeks the diminution in the fair market value*! of its investments in the five
Solaica plants, and its lost profits on its investments in the three OREN Espaiia plants, that can

be shown to have been caused by Spain’s violations of the ECT.

379. The Claimant retained FTI Consulting (Mr. Richard Edwards) to calculate the quantum

of these losses.

380. The Respondent retained Econ One Research Inc. (Dr. Daniel Flores) to provide expert

evidence on the appropriate quantum should liability be established.
B. The Date of Assessment

381. The Claimant proposed that the impact of the challenged measures on the value of the
Claimant's investments should be assessed as of 30 June 2014 (the “Date of Assessment”).*!° The
date of 30 June 2014 was chosen because it marked the end of the quarter in which Spain finalized
the terms of the New Regulatory Regime (i.e. the enactment of RD 413/2014 on 10 June 2014, and
the publication of MO 1045 on 20 June 2014). At that point, the full impact of Spain’s measures

was manifest.

382. Dr. Flores performed his calculations as at two dates: 30 June 2014, (to correspond to the
Date of Assessment FTI was instructed to use); and 19 June 2015, the date that the Solaica plants

were sold to Sun European.
Cc. Positions of the Parties on Quantum
(a) The Claimant’s Approach to Quantum

383. FTI presented a “but for” analysis, i.e. “but for” Spain’s regulatory changes 2010 to 2014,

what would have been the value of the Claimant’s investment as of the date of assessment (30 June

315 The International Valuation Standards Council (also referred as IVSC) defines market value as: “the estimated
amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and willing seller
in an arm’s length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgably, prudently,
and without compulsion.”

316 FTI First Quantum Report, para. 1.18.

 

126

2014). In its view, the “disputed measures” had the impact of reducing the revenues of the plants
by approximately 24%. On that basis, FTI concluded that the Claimant’s investment in Solaica
would have been worth €60 million on the Date of Assessment,*"” but was instead worth just under
€9 million. Adding a calculated loss of approximately €1 million on its investment in the 9REN
Espafia Plants retained by the Claimant, FTI calculated the total loss of value incurred by the

Claimant at €52.2 million.*!8

384. FTI employed the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method which values an investment
based on the stream of future cash flows that the investment is expected to generate,
“discounted” to a present value to account for the time value of money and the uncertainties
inherent in the forecast of future cash flows.*!? The DCF method also allows the valuer to take

into account the specific characteristics of particular assets and, in the opinion of FTI, to measure

37 In FTI First Quantum Report, it is stated at paras. 4.37, 4.38 and 6.39:
4.37 In the Counterfactual Position the Regulatory Changes would not have been implemented, and
consequently there is no reason to suppose that a significant number of companies owning PV plants would
have been in distress in mid or late 2014. Nor is there any reason to suppose that traditional investors in such
assets would have considered the sector more risky in mid-2014, and sought to reduce (or at a minimum
maintain) their exposure to it.
4.38 Consequently, I consider that in the Counterfactual Position the market for Spanish PV assets would
have been undisturbed, and that the rates of return demanded by investors in these assets would have reflected
the highly predictable revenues offered by the FiTs under RD 661 and RD 1578. I have, therefore, ed
the value of 9REN’s investments in the Counterfactual Position using a cost of capital commensurate with
low risk investments.
6.39. In the Counterfactual Position the Solaica Plants would have received the remuneration they
were entitled to under RD 661 from the start of the operation until the Date of Assessment. That i:
where all electricity produced by the plants would have been sold for the appropriate FIT. (emphasis
added)

38 FT] First Quantum Report, paras. 2, 18.

319 See testimony of Richard Edwards (FTI), Tr. Day 4 (Edwards), p. 41:8 to p. 42:2:
In my view, businesses like PV plants lend themselves very well to discounted cash flow valuation. Why is
that? It's because their performance is very predictable. Although the weather varies a little bit from year to
year -- it varies by, at least according to the records of this company, less than 5%, plus or minus -- but there's
very little market that these companies are exposed to. They can sell all of their production, and they can
sell it at a price that is very largely known well in advance. The operating costs are relatively small compared
to revenues, but they are also largely determined by long-term contracts. So the financial performance of
these assets is highly predictable compared to almost any other company that I could imagine. Very little
market risk. Not only that, but the DCF method allows me to reflect very specifically in my valuation
performance of these particular plants. Consequently, to come up with, if you like, a valuation of a
hypothetical scenario, in my view this is far and away the best method.

with some precision the impact of the disputed measures introduced by Spain between 2010 and

2014.37

385. The amount calculated by FTI (€52.2 million) is then carried forward with interest for a
total loss ranging from €53 million to €56.2 million depending on the post-June 2014 interest rate

that is selected.

386. The FTI calculation (on counsel’s instruction) treats the Claimant as exempt from the 7%
TVPEE tax on revenue obtained on the sale of electricity to the SES, and extends the “useful life”

of the PV plants to 35 years from the 30 years said by Spain to be appropriate.

387. More specifically, FTI calculated the quantum of compensation in respect of the five
Solaica plants, which the Claimant sold to Sun European in an unrelated party transaction in

2015, based on the difference between:

(a) the value that the Claimant’s investments in Spain would have had if Spain had not
introduced the disputed measures that the Claimant contends violated the ECT (the

“Counterfactual Position’); and

(b) the market value of those investments after the introduction of those disputed
measures as reflected by the proceeds that the Claimant actually received from

the sale of the five plants to Sun European in 2015 (the “Actual Position”).*?!

388. For the Claimant’s 51% equity in the three small plants that 9REN Espajia continues to
own (which collectively had less than a tenth of the generating capacity of the Solaica plants), FTI
calculated damages based on the present value of the additional cash flows that those plants
would have earned but for the disputed measures,**” and after discounting to account for the

Claimant’s 51% equity, calculates the loss at €1 million.

*20 FT] First Quantum Report, para. 4.23.

* ETI First Quantum Report, pa 2.6, 4.10. The specific investments that FTI values are 9REN’s equity in
Solaica, and a shareholder loan that it extended to Solaica. Because the shareholder loan is junior to Solaica’s
third-party debt, FTI says it is effectively the same as an equity investment for purposes of FTI’s analysis. [bid.,
paras. 4.18-4.19.

322 Ibid., para. 2.7.

 

 

 

128

(b) The Respondent’s Methodology

389. Much of the Econ One methodology is premised on Spain’s argument that the Claimant
was entitled only to a “reasonable return” or “reasonable profit” on its investment as reflected in
the 2005 PER, a position which the Tribunal has rejected. Dr. Daniel Flores thus took the position
that:

from an economic perspective, the correct way to establish whether the
Measures have had an economic impact on Claimant’s interests in the PV
Plants is to determine whether the return that those plants can be
expected to yield after the enactment of the Measures is lower than
the reasonable return for renewable energy projects. We find that the
project IRR for the PV Plants after the enactment of the Measures is higher
than the reasonable rate of return for renewable energy projects.
Therefore, we conclude that the Measures have not had a negative impact
on the PV Plants. **

390. Dr. Flores calculated the post-tax internal rate of return on the investment in the Solaica
plants in the Actual Position to be between 10.90% and 11.48%, and estimated the “reasonable rate
of return for renewable energy projects” to be 7%. Because he considered the actual return despite
the disputed measures to be higher than the “reasonable rate of return”, Dr. Flores concluded that

the Claimant had suffered no loss as a result.

391. Spain argued in its Counter-Memorial that the DCF method was not appropriate*** but Dr.
Flores appears to disagree with his client’s assertion that there is a “high dependency of the cash
flows on external, volatile and unpredictable elements.” Dr. Flores testified that that “PV Plants

have fixed operating costs and a relatively stable level of electricity generation.”*?>

392. The Tribunal concludes, on the evidence that the DCF method was appropriate.

323 Econ One First Qua

is, the Claimant he

should be noted that FTI concludes on the contrary that even on the
ffered a loss:

   

if one assumes that returns would have been regulated down to 7%, 8% or 9%, and depending on whether
those cash flows would be earned over 25 years, 30 years or 35 years... .indicatively the Claimant might have
lost anything between €20 million and €60 million, depending on what one assumes the reasonable rate of
return would have been and the useful life of the plant...(Tr., Day 4 (Edwards), p. 57:7-13)

324 Respondent’ s Counter-Memorial, para. 1327.

*5 Econ One First Quantum Report, para. 176.

129

393. However, Dr. Flores went on to criticize elements of the FTI implementation of the DCF
method as set out below. For example, Dr. Flores criticizes FTI for assuming that “the Solaica
plants paid and will continue to pay corporate taxes when in fact they never have.” °° Moreover,
according to Dr. Flores, FTI’s estimate of the investment costs of the Solaica plants is skewed.*?’
The various calculations of Dr. Flores were vigorously tested in cross-examination by Mr. Kevin

Mohr on behalf of the Claimant.
(c) FTI’s Response

394. FTI argues that Dr. Flores’ proposed adjustments to its discounted cash flow model, and his
conclusion, are dominated by a proposed risk adjustment to revenues. In FTI’s view, Dr. Flores
either assumes that Spain had the right to amend the FIT terms (and his analysis is thereby
unresponsive to the Tribunal’s conclusion on liability) or Dr. Flores has materially overstated the

risk of Spanish default.*?8

395. For reasons to be discussed, the Tribunal by majority agrees with Dr. Flores that a proper
valuation would take into account the risk that Spain could lawfully make adjustments to RD
661/2007 without violating the ECT (as contemplated by the Charanne and Isolux tribunals).
Investment in a regulated industry is not a risk free proposition, but the risk should not be assessed
at the elevated discount levels Dr. Flores proposes. The dissenting member of the Tribunal would

not make such an adjustment.

(i) The FTI Analysis Proceeded in the Following Steps

1. Solaica Plants

*26 Econ One Second Quantum Report, para. 116.

27 Econ-One points out when analysing the investment costs in the plants included in the financial sphere of Solaica:
The initial investment costs of the Solaica PV Plants appear to be in excess of the costs that would be incurred
in an arm’s length transaction. We have not seen any documents that would explain why the initial investment
costs of the Solaica PV Plants, as reported in the Solaica financial statements, are significantly higher than
the typical installed costs in the photovoltaic industry. We do not have access to detailed cost information for
the Solaica PV Plants to evaluate the reasonability of their initial investment costs. As a result, we have not
been able to determine whether there are some initial investment costs that should be excluded from our
calculations. To the extent that PV Plants’ initial investment costs represent payments to the shareholders, or
non-arm’s length transactions between related parties, they would need to be excluded from our calculations.

397. The DCF method was used to calculate the actual value of the Claimant’s investments
as of the Date of Assessment namely 30 June 2014.**” A comparison was made between the Actual
Position, i.e. the real world result after absorbing the impact of the disputed measures, and the
Counterfactual Position, the theoretical universe where no such regulatory changes had been

Initial Investment Cost

 

FTI estimates the Claimant's initial investment
costs at €116.5 million.**? FTI points out that
Dr. Flores’ estimate is unrealistic as it is
materially lower than the costs used by Spain
in MO 1045 as described by Spain’s expert,
Mr. Carlos Montoya in his witness statement.
According to FTI, Dr. Flores’ conclusion that
QREN has suffered no loss is almost entirely

 

 

Dr. Flores estimates €68.3 million (in part
because the Claimant excludes labour and
other relevant costs borne by an affiliated
company). However, errors were discovered
in the calculation. In his Second Report, Dr.

million.

dependent on this erroneous estimate of the
initial investment costs of the Solaica plants.**7

 

Electricity Production

 

FTI projects future electricity production
based on each company’s average historical
production from the start of each plant’s
operation through the end of 2014 (a period of
5+ years for most of the plants).**° FTI then
applies a degradation rate of 0.5% per annum
to account for future declines in the efficiency
of the solar panels.**°

Dr. Flores calculates future electricity
production based on the regulator’ s “standard”
parameters, e.g. operations eligible for the
premium limited to 1,250 hours per year.**”
(As noted earlier however, the Tribunal has
already concluded that the limitation to 1,250
hours per year violated the Claimant’s ECT
rights.)

 

Inflation

 

Under RD 661/2007, the tariffs were to be
adjusted annually based on the Spanish CPI
(less 0.25% until 2012 and 0.5% thereafter).
FTI projects future inflation in the near term
(through 2019) based on forecasts published by
the International Monetary Fund (“IMF’’), and
in the longer term based on the European
Central Bank’s inflation target.***

Econ One says the European and IMF
projections are unrealistic in light of Spain’s
particular economic circumstances. Dr. Flores
projects “long term inflation in Spain at
1.48%.”>*° FTI agreed and made a €10 million
adjustment of its calculation in Spain’s
favour.*4°

 

Operating Life

 

FTI projects that Claimant’s plants will
continue to operate, and thus continue to
receive the tariffs and other benefits
guaranteed by RD 661/2007, for 35 years from
inception.*#! A useful life expectancy of 35
years is supported by a study published by the
European Commission in 2011 and_ the
lending model adopted by the bank consortium

 

 

Econ One considers a 30-year useful life is
more realistic. The studies relied upon by FTI
provide wide ranges and the choice of 35 years
is at the high end of the studies.** A more
likely average range is 20 to 30 years.*4°

In June 2012, following the loan conversion, Gamesa held a 49% interest in the 9REN Espafia PV Plants, but
not in the Solaica PV Plants. Now there was an incentive to reduce O&M costs, because for every €1.00
reduction in the O&M cost of the Solaica Plants, Claimant would achieve a €1.00 increase in operating profits
from Solaica and only a €0.51 decline in operating profits from 9REN Espaiia.

assume a useful life of 30 years.*4?

 

Operating Costs

 

FTI projects future O&M costs based on the
average historical costs from 2011 to 2014,
which FTI projects to grow with inflation.*4
FTI estimates that if the adjustment to O&M
costs advocated by Dr. Flores is made, FTI’s
estimate of loss on the Solaica plants would
actually increase by €1.9 million from €51.2
million to €53.2 million.*4”

Econ One points out that operations and
maintenance services were provided by a
company affiliated with the Claimant and
represent transfer pricing other than a market
rate*8 and were “abnormally high”.*4? The

tisk applicable to the PV plants “was the
general default risk of Spain” which FTI
estimates at 2.1%.°°° In any event, FTI
criticizes Dr. Flores’ regulatory risk scenario
for assuming the possibility that all regulatory
support would be removed. This would imply
that most (if not all) Spanish PV plants built
under RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 would
become loss making and likely cease
operations. Dr. Flores’ hypothetical is thus
more severe than the regulatory revisions
actually introduced. There was no realistic risk
that Spain would revise regulatory support in
ways that resulted in a significant proportion of
its renewable energy assets ceasing
operations.*°7

Econ One says FTI’s assessment of risk is
unrealistic. In 2008, a bid for one of the
Solaica plants “implicitly” incorporated a
2.5% annual probability that the regulated
premium would be eliminated.*°* In Econ
One’s opinion, had Spain not taken the
measure in 2010-2014 to stabilize the Spanish
electricity system, it is reasonable to assume as
of the date of assessment (30 June 2014) there
would have been a tariff deficit crisis looming,
and a 10% probability of a severe regulatory
reduction.>?

As regards the risk of Spain being unable to
meet its obligations, Dr. Flores was of the view
that this risk was not altered materially by the
regulatory changes.

 

Discount for Lack of Liquidity

 

 

An “illiquidity discount” is a function of
marketability (how long it would take to sell
the assets) and the potential discount required
to facilitate the sale. FTI does not make an
adjustment for the fact that the Claimant’s
investment consisted of assets that might be
difficult to sell on the date of assessment.°

 

Econ One estimates that considering the
nature of the Claimant’s assets and the Spanish
market, it would take about 6 months to sell
the plants (based on the time taken for 9REN
to sell its plants to Sun European in 2015).
Accordingly, in the view of Dr. Flores, there
should be an “liquidity discount” of 18% in the

the “but for” scenario.* Dr. Flores testified
that there is general consensus among
investors and market players that some
illiquidity discount is necessary with this type
of asset.*

 

Discount Rate to Arrive at the Present Value on

the Date of Assessment

 

FTI discounted its calculated future cash flows
to present value on the Date of Assessment
using the Weighted Average Cost of Capital
(“WACC”).°° FTI calculates the applicable
WACC to be 5.3%, which it rounds up to
5.5% 30

Econ One considers the “Adjusted Present
Value” (“APV”’) methodology more
appropriate than WACC, and calculates a
discount rate of 4.94% for the PV plants.*”
Econ One accepts that in the result, the impact
of this difference in of opinion with FTI is
“relatively small”.*°°

 

Counterfactual Value on the Date of Assessment

 

To arrive at the value of the Claimant’s
investment in Solaica in the Counterfactual
Position, FTI subtracted the net third-party
debt held by Solaica from its enterprise value.
FTI also subtracted the value of the additional
cash that the companies would have held on the
Date of Assessment but for the challenged

 

 

Econ One contented itself with the observation
that FTT’s calculations were flawed.

measures, which FTI calculates to be €6.7
million (e.g. Solaica’s historical losses from
the challenged measures before 30 June
2014). FTI also includes the value of the
interest rate swaps that Solaica entered into in
2009. Based on these calculations, FTI
assessed the value of the Claimant’s
investment in Solaica in the Counterfactual
situation at €60 million.

 

Actual Value of the Investment in Solaica on the Date of Assessment

 

In the Actual Value Assessment, FTI relied on
the actual proceeds that the Claimant received
from its sale of Solaica on 19 June 2015 to Sun
European for €9.5 million.*”° FTI understood
the sale to Sun European was an arms’ length
transaction and therefore a “‘strong indicator of
the market value of 9REN’s investment in
Solaica at the time of sale.”27!

There is evidence that dividends were paid to
9REN in the year prior to the acquisition of
Solaica by Sun European. FTI therefore
responds that the consideration paid by Sun
European in 2015 reflected both the expected
cash flows and the cash earned in the year prior
and no such further adjustment is
appropriate.°”*

In the absence of significant regulatory
changes between the Date of Assessment and
the date of sale, FTI considered the sale price
in June 2015 to be a good indicator of the actual
market value of 9REN’s investment a year
earlier in Solaica as of the Date of
Assessment,*” discounted by the Claimant’s
cost of equity for one year, resulting in FTI’s
valuation of the Claimant’s interest in Solaica
in the Actual position (as of the Date of

 

 

Assessment) of €8.8 million.*”

Econ One agrees that the appropriate measure
of the value of the Solaica investment is the
proceeds of the sale of the PV plants to Sun
European in June 2015 for €9.5 million,*”> but
would adjust for cash flows between 30 June
2014 and 19 June 2015.

Conclusion

 

Consequently, in FTI’s First Quantum Report
dated 12 July 2016, the Claimant’s losses on its
investment in Solaica as a result of Spain’s
measures were calculated as the difference
between the value of its investments in Solaica
in the Counterfactual and Actual Positions, set
forth in Table 7.1 of FTI’s Quantum Report as
follows:

In its subsequent Report dated 19 May 2017,

FTI stated:
...applying Dr. Flores’ APV method using
my estimate of the unlevered cost of equity
of 5.9% and Dr. Flores’ estimate of the value
of the interest tax shield, would increase the
value of the Solaica Plants in the
Counterfactual Position as at the Date of
Assessment by EUR 0.7 million, and
consequently my assessment of the loss
incurred on the Solaica Plants would
increase by EUR 0.7 million from EUR 51.2
million to EUR 52.0 million.

However, in later calculations (e.g. the interest

calculation at Table 8.3) FTI reverted to its

estimated loss on the Solaica Plants of €51.2

million.

 

 

Econ One calculates that the disputed
measures created no diminution of value of the
Claimant’s investment. As Dr. Flores stated in
cross-examination:

Q. So in your view, as long as the IRR, with
the measures in place — what you call the
"prevailing scenario" — is greater than 7%,
then you think that there is no compensable
economic impact?

A. Again, I don't know if “compensable
economic impact" has a legal meaning that
escapes me. I think that would show that
there's no — in my report I never have used the
term "compensable". I would just say there's
no economic impact.”

 

400.

FTI illustrates what it says are the various impacts of the differences between its

calculations (using a loss estimate of €51 million) and the calculations of Econ One with respect

to the Solaica Plants as follows:

401. In this chart, FTI did not break out a figure for the impact on its valuation that would result

from the application to the Claimant of the 7% revenue tax.

2. Calculation of Compensation in Respect of the REN Espajia Plants

402. A different methodology was used by FTI to value the Claimant’s losses in respect of the
three plants that 9REN Espafia continues to own, for two main reasons. First, 9REN Espafia has not
sold those facilities, and thus there is no market transaction on which to base actual value. Second,
the financial data for those plants (e.g., cost data in particular) are consolidated with REN Espafia’s
other business activities in its financial accounts in such a way that it is impractical for FTI or Econ
One to construct a complete cash flow model for those facilities. As Mr. Edwards of FTI testified
in cross-examination:
Q. As I said, you distinguished between those two sets of plants, and you

calculate a DCF for the Solaica plants, but for the 9REN plants you used
another kind of valuation method, right?

A. It’s more of a loss assessment method, I'd say. So I didn’t derive values
for the plants; what I estimated was the loss of profits arising from reduced

138

revenues and slightly increased costs, and I discounted that loss of profits.

But I didn't value those plants, no.°””

 

403. Accordingly, with respect to the 9REN Espajia plants, the experts had the following
differences:
Evidence of FTI Evidence of Econ One

 

Actual Versus Counterfactual Situations

 

FTI estimates revenue in the Actual Situation
based on the remuneration parameters
established in MO 1045 for each plant, taking
into account how those parameters are likely to
change during the periodic reviews based on
forward yield curves for Spanish government
bonds.378

FTI calculates the incremental costs based on
the application of the 7% TYVEE revenue tax
to its estimated revenue in the Actual Position
and the Access Toll to estimated electricity
production.*”

FTI estimated the lost profits that the Claimant
incurred on its investment in those three plants
as a result of the disputed measures based on
the projected revenue of the plants in the
Counterfactual Position Jess the projected
revenue of the plants in the Actual Position,
plus the incremental costs allegedly arising
from the challenged measures.**°

In the Counterfactual Position, FTI estimates
the revenues for the three 9REN Espaiia plants
employing the same methodology summarized
above for the Solaica plants, namely:

(i) the plants’ average historical production;

 

(ii) an annual degradation factor of 0.5%;

 

Dr. Flores does not assess the Claimant’s loss
on its investment in the 9REN Espajia plants
as he states that he does not have sufficient
information to analyze and forecast their
financial performance.**° Notwithstanding
that, Dr. Flores considers that he has “not seen
anything to indicate that [his] conclusions for
those plants would be anything different than
[his] conclusions for the Solaica PV plants.”**°
Dr. Flores concludes, therefore, that based on
his assumptions about a reasonable rate of
return, the Claimant is unlikely to have
suffered a loss on its investment in the 9REN
Espaiia plants.

(iii) tariffs based on the applicable tariff rates
under RD 661/2007 and RD _ 1578/2008
(adjusted for inflation); and

(iv) operating life of 35 years from
inception.**!

FTI concludes that the three 9REN Espaiia
plants (together) will earn around €200,000
less per year under the New Regulatory
Regime than they would have received under
RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008.3*

FTI then deducts the corporate income tax that
9REN Espafia would have owed on those
incremental profits.***

Finally, FTI calculates the present value of
those lost profits by adding interest to those
losses that were incurred before the Date of
Assessment (at the 12 month EURIBOR rate),
and by discounting the losses that will be
incurred after the Date of Assessment at the
WACC rate of 5.5%.3%4

The result of these calculations, presented in
Table 8-4 of FTI’s Quantum Report, is that the
present value of 9REN Espaiia’s lost profits on
the Date of Assessment is approximately €2
million:

when the Claimant bought Gamesa Solar) into
a 49% equity interest. Consequently, the
Claimant owns a 51% interest in REN Espaiia
and FTI reduces its calculation of the
Claimant’s damages for the 9REN Espajia
plants to €1 million accordingly.**”

 

Conclusion re: Quantum of Compensation

 

Thus, in total, FTI assesses damages as of the | Dr. Flores assesses the damage to the

 

 

 

date of Assessment of €52.2 million. Claimant’s investment as of the Date of
Assessment, even using DCF’s methodology
at ZERO.

 

D. The Tribunal’s Ruling on the Quantum of Compensation

404. The Tribunal proceeds on the basis that the quantum must be “sufficient to compensate the

[Claimant] fully and to eliminate the consequences” of Spain’s’ wrongful conduct.***

405. In this respect, the Claimant bears the legal burden of proving its case on compensation. This
general principle is well established under international law: onus probandi actori incumbit. If and to
the extent that the Claimant does not prove its case on the assessment of compensation, it follows that
its claim for compensation must be reduced or, where no loss is established, altogether dismissed by
the Tribunal. Assessment of loss is not a simple exercise in arithmetic. Complex issues in the
assessment of compensation that divide the Parties’ expert witnesses justify a margin of appreciation
for the Tribunal under the ECT and international law. The required exercise is acknowledged to be less

than an exact science.

406. The Tribunal accepts 30 June 2014 as an appropriate Date of Assessment, having regard to
the enactment of the New Regulatory Regime on 10 June 2014 and the convenience of evaluating

data as of the end of the second quarter of the 2014 financial year.

407. The Econ One methodology premised on the “reasonable rate of return” interpretation put
forward by Spain is of little assistance given that the Tribunal has rejected Spain’s interpretation

as inconsistent with the text and context of RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008. The Tribunal accepts

Award, para. 8.2.7, Exhibit CL-79.

141

as appropriate the DCF methodology applied by FTI but taking due account of the objections of

Econ One.

408. In undertaking quantification, the Tribunal recognizes that while the DCF method presents
a picture of mathematical precision, its output is wholly dependent on the quality of the inputs,
many of which are necessarily (to borrow Mr. Edwards’ phrase) “judgmental and subjective”.**
As noted by the tribunal in Gold Reserve v. Venezuela,*” the assessment of damages is often a
difficult exercise. Such assessments will usually involve some degree of estimation and the
weighing of competing (but equally legitimate) facts, valuation methods and opinions. The
element of imprecision reinforces the inevitability of a certain amount of approximation when

assessing damages.*?!

409. Asis seen in the points above listing the differences between Mr. Edwards and Dr. Flores,
in many cases (e.g. Mr. Edwards testimony that if an illiquidity discount were to be applied, it

should be “no more than 10% and probably less”),?°”

the experts were often working not so much
with specific figures but a range of figures, which, when combined one with the others potentially

unleashed a multiplier effect that could lead to a wide range of outcomes.

410. Nevertheless, having made its findings of jurisdiction and liability, the Tribunal is obliged
to arrive at an award based on the materials the parties have chosen to put before it, remembering
always that it is for the Claimant to prove its loss on a balance of probabilities. In this respect, as
the Crystallex tribunal observed:

Claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the Tribunal can, with
reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.*”?

tribunal noted that “it is well-settled that the fact that damages cannot be assessed with certainty is no reason to award
damages when a loss had been incurred.” And in Tecmed, the tribunal observed that “any difficulty in determining
the compensation does not prevent the assessment of such compensation where the existence of damage is certain.”

142

411. To repeat, a tribunal is necessarily given a “margin of appreciation”, as noted in the Rusoro

Mining*™* award:

Any assessment of damages in a complex factual situation, involving
revenue-generating enterprises, includes some degree of estimation — the
same degree which is also applied by (private and government) actors in
the real world when valuing enterprises. Because of this difficulty,
tribunals retain a certain margin of appreciation. This should not be
confused with acting ex aequo et bono, because the Tribunal’s margin of
appreciation can only be exercised in a reasoned manner and with full
respect of the principles of international law for the calculation of
damages.

412. With respect to the points of the FTI analysis in dispute between Mr. Edwards and Dr.

Flores:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

the Tribunal accepts FTI’s projection of electricity production based on historical
performance plus a degradation factor of 0.5% per annum, subject to the “operating

hours” limitation discussed below;

the rate of inflation of 1.48% proposed by Dr. Flores and accepted by Mr. Edwards

is appropriate;

with respect to the operating life of the facilities, the Tribunal prefers the 30 years
suggested by Dr. Flores. The studies referred to by both witnesses suggest that the
35 years used by FTI is towards the most optimistic end of the range, whereas 30

years is a more realistic estimate of “average” longevity;

in terms of operating costs, FTI did not take into account that the historical
operating and maintenance cost was provided by a company affiliated with the
Claimant, and dropped significantly when the Claimant acquired a 49% outside
partner in Gamesa Solar S.A. in 2012. The post-2012 level of costs were more
appropriate. However, FTI argues that this adjustment would marginally increase

the compensation to the Claimant;

143

(e) corporate income tax is a reality that should be reflected in the calculation of the
value of the investments to the Claimant in the shares of the operating companies

over the 30-year life of the facilities;

(f) the Tribunal accepts that RD 661/2007 refers to “all or part of the electricity
generated”, as used in the calculation of Mr. Edwards, not just 1,250 operating
hours accepted by Dr. Flores. The Tables set out in RDL 14/2010 illustrated the
severity of the “cap” on hours during which energy can be produced at the
subsidized rate which vary in their application to a “fixed facility” (such as the

Claimant’s) from 1,232 to 1,753 hours:

(g) as to the TVPEE tax, introduced on 27 December 2012, the Tribunal concludes
that the ECT afforded no immunity. Mr. Edwards confirmed that if TVPEE was

not properly imposed:

the Revenue Tax would have had the effect of reducing the revenues of
the Solaica Plants by 7% over this period, and would have reduced the
cash flows by marginally less than this in most years.*°°

35 FTI Second Quantum Report, Appendix A-4-2, para. Ad-2.4.

144

(h) as to the regulatory risk of revision to the benefits of RD 661/2007, the FTI

position is that the only applicable risk to investors was “the general default risk of

Spain”.3°

The opinion of Dr. Flores, on the other hand, is that if the disputed regulatory
changes had not been imposed, “the Spanish electricity system would have
remained in a state that was perceived to be unsustainable.”*°’ This would have
given rise, according to Dr. Flores, to a 10% probability of a “regulatory revision”
(that is, that the regulatory support would be removed in whole or in substantial
part) in each year. Spain could not have afforded to do otherwise. Now, however,
“Ta]s a result of the stabilization of the tariff deficit, the broader Spanish economy,
as well as the consistency between the prevailing regulatory regime and the stated

objective of the law”, the risk is lower;>8

The Second FTI Report rejects the appropriateness of a “regulatory risk” other
than risk of a general failure of Spain to meet its financial obligations but this

approach is expressly based on the instructions of counsel:

...I understand that it is a tenet of the Claimant’s case that Spain did not
have a right to change or suspend the payment of the FiTs voluntarily, or
to choose not to fund or guarantee any shortfall between consumer tariffs
and the regulated cost base (such as the tariff deficit). As I have been

5 FTI Second Quantum Report, para. 5.19:
As I explain in my First Report, I have captured macroeconomic risks, including the risk of a government
not being able to meet its obligations, by including a country risk premium of 2.1% in my estimates of the
cost of capital. The country risk premium included in my calculation of Solaica’s cost of capital is based on
the spread of Spanish bond yields over German government bond yields (the latter being a proxy for the risk-
free rate). In other words, the country risk premium included in my cost of capital reflects the market

ssociated with the of Spanish default, plus a further adjustment to reflect the risk
to equity investors. In my view no further adjustment to cash flows or the cost of capital is necessary to
capture the effect on value of Spanish default risk.

3°7 Econ One First Quantum Report, paras. 201-202:
201. In the absence of the Measures, the Spanish electricity system would have remained in a state that was
perceived to be unsustainable. Investors would have faced considerably higher regulatory risk than in 2008,
when the tariff deficit began to accelerate. It is unreasonable to assume, as FTI does, that specific regulations
applicable to the PV Plants would have stayed in place as they existed at one precise point in time.
202. Given the condition of the Spanish electricity market in the absence of the Measures, a 10% probability
of regulatory revision affecting the PV Plants’ revenue is reasonable in the “But For” Scenario. We model a
probability of revision beginning in 2013, when the first of the substantial Measures were put in place.

instructed to calculate the loss on the basis of the Claimant’s case as

choosing to change the remuneration, or choosing not to fund or
guarantee the tariff deficit, in my counterfactual valuation.*”
(emphasis added)

In light of counsel’s instructions to calculate the loss on the basis of the Claimant’s
case as pleaded, FTI concluded that the relevant risk left open by counsel’s

instructions was “country risk”:

...the risk that Spain would be unable to fund any shortfall or deficit, is a
relevant consideration, however. This is because ultimately the risk of
non-payment of renewable energy producers’ remuneration comes down
to whether Spain is willing and able to meet any shortfall between
revenues and costs in the electricity system should a shortfall occur. If the
Claimant is correct, and Spain did not have a right to change or
suspend the payment of the FiTs voluntarily, or to choose not to fund
or guarantee any shortfall between consumer tariffs and the regulated cost
base, then the risk that Spain will be unable to meet the funding
requirement of the system is the risk that Spain will default on its financial
obligations.“ (emphasis added)

In the Tribunal’s view, reasonable investors on the Date of Assessment, 30 June
2014 would have expected that Spain would honour the obligations it had
undertaken in RD 661/2007, but in the majority view, there was a risk that Spain
would not perform as promised and that (as some international tribunals, notably
Charanne and Isolux*®! have held), Spain’s tariff reductions would not be
considered violations of the ECT. The Charanne award was quite explicit that any
investor who had done due diligence with respect to the Spanish legal system was
put on notice that the FIT tariff in both RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008 could be
reduced, and that such investors could have no legitimate expectation of a “stability

guarantee” that if violated, could give rise to an ECT claim:

In this case, the Claimants could not have the legitimate expectation that
the regulatory framework laid down by RD 661/2007 and RD 1578/2008
would remain unchanged during the entire lifespan of their plants.“

While the Tribunal appreciates that FTI acted on counsel’s instructions, a majority
of the Tribunal agrees with Econ One that a proper analysis of quantum must take
into account as of the Date of Assessment the risk that a regulatory reduction in the
FIT tariff would eventually be found by an investor state Tribunal not to have

violated the ECT and therefore not to give rise to compensation.

A majority of the Tribunal therefore considers that some measure of “regulatory
tisk” should be reflected in the Award because a prudent and well-informed
investor would have been alive to the risk that Spain might reduce the FIT tariff
and be held (despite the ECT) to be within its rights under international law to do

so without compensation;

as to a discount for lack of liquidity, Mr. Edwards testified that as of 30 June 2014
there was a steady market for PV facilities in Spain, although he accepts that a €100
investment in stocks was more readily disposable than an €100 investment in
Spanish renewable energy facilities. On the other hand, the Tribunal concludes that
Dr. Flores’ suggestion of an 18 to 26% discount for “‘illiquidity” is not supported
by the evidence. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts Dr. Flores’ evidence that an
“jlliquidity discount” is appropriate but accepts Mr. Edwards’ evidence that in light
of the fact it took the Claimant 6 months to sell the Solaica plants, an illiquidity
discount rate based on a 6 month marketing period is sufficient. Mr. Edwards,
employing the “Finnerty Model”, arrived at what he calls a likely illiquidity

discount that would result from a 6 month marketing delay to be 3.4%;4

(0) as to the appropriate discount rate, FTI used 5.5%. Dr. Flores used 4.94% but
acknowledged that the differences to the end result would be “relatively small’”.4*

The Tribunal accepts the 5.5% proposed by Mr. Edwards.

413. The Tribunal is of the view, for the reasons stated, that the FTI calculation of a €52.2
million loss failed to take into account a number of significant contingencies, including the 7%
TVPEE revenue tax, the lack of a “stability guarantee” in RD 1578/2008, the increase in O&M
costs after 2012 and an illiquidity discount. The Tribunal by majority would also include a

discount for regulatory risk.

414. On the other hand, the Tribunal does not agree with Dr. Flores with respect to his
calculation of zero loss which rests on a number of contingencies which the Tribunal has rejected,
including the operating restriction to 1,250 hours a year, and an exaggerated regulatory risk

adjustment.*°

415. The diminution in the value of the Claimant’s investment in the Solaica Plants and the
SREN Espaiia Plants is not capable of precise calculation on the basis of the materials before the
Tribunal. There are too many contingencies and contingencies within contingencies. However, the

Tribunal must work as best it can with the tools provided to it by the Parties.

416. In the circumstances, having regard to the onus on the Claimant to prove the quantum of
its claim, the Tribunal, on the evidentiary record before it, reduces the quantum asserted by the
Claimant by 20% from €52.2 million to €41.76 million by removing the claim to reimbursement
of the 7% TVPEE, reducing the expected useful operating life of the facilities from 35 to 30 years
(which Mr. Edwards calculated would itself reduce the claim by €7.5 million), eliminating the
tariff protection for the Formifiena plant in light of the explicit warning of potential tariff

reductions in RD 1578/2008, and incorporating a discount for illiquidity and regulatory risk.

417. In the circumstances, the Tribunal therefore concludes that the Claimant has established a

loss of €52.2 million less 20% for a net quantum of €41.76 million.

E. Pre- and Post-Award Compound Interest

418.  FTT’s calculation of €52.2 million includes interest up to and including the Date of
Assessment of 30 June 2014. In its second report, FTI calculated interest from the Date of
Assessment to the date of its Second Report, 19 May 2017, based on the Spanish 5-year
government bond yield, which the Tribunal considers appropriate because (i) it represents the
interest the Claimant would have received had the money been loaned to the Respondent and (ii)
the claim was, until now, an unliquidated amount and therefore not in the power of the Respondent
to accurately assess prior to this Award. Taking the FTI figure of €53 million“ and applying a

20% discount, the net quantum is €42.4 million including interest to 19 May 2017.

419. Nevertheless, for the purpose of this Award, the Tribunal prefers to start with the net
quantum of €41.76 million as of the agreed Date of Assessment, 30 June 2014, and then fix an
appropriate rate of interest based on the Spanish 5-year Government bond yield to be applied to
€41.76 million from 30 June 2014 until the Award is paid. The calculation is to be made using the

methodology employed by FTI in its calculation of interest from 30 June 2014 to 19 May 2017.

(a) The Claimant’s Argument on Compound Interest

420. The Claimant contends that “interest becomes an integral part of the compensation itself,
and should run consequently from the date when the State’s international responsibility became
engaged.”*°” The Claimant requests that the Tribunal grant an appropriate interest rate based on

international commercial rates.“°°

421. The Claimant further requests that any award of interest granted by this Tribunal be
compounded as the most accepted and appropriate method of making a claimant whole. Since
2000, the majority of BIT tribunals have awarded compound interest in cases involving

diverse countries, different facts, and various industries.*°? Thus, according to the Claimant,

international law now recognizes the awarding of compound interest as the generally accepted

standard for compensation in international investment arbitrations.

422. In Compania del Desarrollo de Santa Elena v. Costa Rica, the tribunal, in awarding
compound interest to the claimant, noted that compound interest serves two distinct goals:
(i) to ensure that the claimant receives “the full present value of the compensation that it should
have received at the time of the taking” and (ii) to prevent “the State [from being] unjustly...
enrich[ed]...by reason of the fact that the payment of compensation has long been delayed.”*!°
Had the Claimant been compensated on the Date of Assessment, it could have received compound
interest merely by placing its money in a readily available and commonly used investment vehicle.

In the circumstances, it is neither logical nor equitable to award the Claimant only simple interest.

423. In Vivendi v. Argentina, the tribunal stated that “a number of international tribunals have
recently expressed the view that compound interest should be available as a matter of course if
economic reality requires such an award to place the claimant in the position it would have

been in had it never been injured.”*!!

424. The payment of interest furthers the principle of full compensation because it aids in
restoring the claimant to the position in which it would have been had the respondent not

committed the breach.*!? Moreover, compound interest prevents unjust enrichment of the

respondent by requiring it to pay compensation for the benefits received from using the money

it wrongfully withheld.*°

425. Compound interest more accurately reflects what the Claimant would have been able to

earn on the sums owed if they had been paid in a timely manner.*!*
(b) The Respondent’s Argument

426. Spain’s financial expert, Econ One, contented itself at paragraph 228 of its Second Quantum
Report dated 28 July 2017 with the observation that “we maintain that should compensation with

interest have to be awarded to [the] Claimant, a short-term, risk-free rate would be appropriate to

calculate interest, which is generally consistent with FTI’s position in its first report.”*!°

(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling on Compound Interest

427. The Tribunal accepts as correct the approach taken in Compajiia del Desarrollo de Santa
Elena v. Costa Rica*'® on the need to compound interest in such a way as to make “whole” the

Claimant:

In particular, where an owner of property has at some earlier time lost the
value of his asset but has not received the monetary equivalent that then
became due to him, the amount of compensation should reflect, at least in
part, the additional sum that his money would have earned, had it, and the
income generated by it, been reinvested each year at generally prevailing
rates of interest. It is not the purpose of compound interest to attribute
blame to, or to punish, anybody for the delay in the payment made to the
expropriated owner; it is a mechanism to ensure that the compensation
awarded the Claimant is appropriate in the circumstances. As to the
compounding period, depending on the circumstances of the case and the
conduct of the parties, tribunals have also, in many recent investment
cases, determined that interest should be compounded annually, semi-
annually, quarterly or monthly.

immediately after the cause of action arose, awarding simple interest fails to fully compensate claims. All awards
of prejudgment interest should therefore be computed using compound interest.”), Exhibit CL-093.

41 See Gotanda, A Study of Interest, Exhibit CL-090; see also Col6n & Knoll at 8 (“Awarding simple interest
generally fails to compensate claimants fully and can create strong incentives for respondents to delay arbitration
proceedings and cause harms, thereby wasting resources.”), Exhibit CL-093.

February 2000, para. 104, Exhibit CL-068.

 

152

428. As to when compounding interest should be annual or semi-annual or even more

frequently, the Tribunal notes the observation of Professor James Crawford:

Care is however needed since allowing compound interest could result in
an inflated and disproportionate award, with the amount of interest greatly
exceeding the principal amount owed.

429. In the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that an annual compounding of interest is

appropriate for both pre-award and post-award interest.
F. Rate of Interest

(a) The Claimant’s Position

430. FTI in its first report stated that:

Ihave estimated the present value of post-tax lost profits that would have
been earned before the Date of Assessment by adding interest. I have
assumed that interest would have been earned at the 12 month EURIBOR
rate and that this interest would have been taxed at the prevailing rate of
corporate tax in each year."””

FTI then calculated the Claimant’s notional borrowing costs on the Date of Assessment, 30 June
2014 at 4% based on the 6 month EURIBOR rate of 0.3% plus a spread of 3.5%.*!8 FTI did not

rely on the Claimant’s actual debt experience, whatever it may have been.

4\7 FTI First Quantum Report, at para. 8-19.

418 FT] First Quantum Report, Appendix 6-2, para. A6-2.28:

Based on my discussions with the Claimant, I understand that Solaica would (with the capital structure I
been able at the Date of ment to raise debt with an interest rate equal to approximately 4%. Thi:
estimate of 6 month Euribor on the Date of Assessment of 0.3% plus a “spread” of approximately 3.5%. Therefore, I
assess the post-tax cost of debt of 3% (assuming a corporate tax rate of 25%). My calculations are set out in Table A6-
1-4 below.

Table A6-2-4: Post-tax cost of debt

    

   

to cut taxes recovery, FT June 2014)

153

431. In its second report, FTI changed the basis of its interest calculation “pursuant to my
instructions“! to assess the Claimant’s loss, as of 30 June 2014 using two different measures,

namely Spanish 5 year Government bonds and the actual cost to the Claimant of its debt.*”°

(b) The Respondent’s Position

432. Dr. Flores objects to the “amended” FTI interest calculation based on “the instruction of

[the Claimant’s] counsel”, and reaffirms his concurrence with FTI’s initial calculation.
(c) The Tribunal’s Ruling

433. In the circumstances, the Tribunal orders interest from 30 June 2014 until payment of the
Award at an interest rate equivalent to 5-year Spanish Government bond yields during the relevant

period compounded annually.

434. As the amount of compounded interest will not be ascertainable until an actual date of
payment by the Respondent is established, the Tribunal necessarily has to specify a method rather
than a fixed amount. It has done so. The calculation is to be made according to the yield from time

to time during the relevant period on 5-year Spanish Government bond.
PART 9. COSTS
A. The Parties’ Submissions on Costs

435. In response to the Tribunal’s request the Claimant filed a statement of costs fees and
expenses in the amount of US$6,334,961.01 added to €740,076.42 (approximately
US$839,359.89) making a total claim of US$7,174,320.80. The Claimant was represented by eight

lawyers from two firms at the hearing on the merits. The lawyers recorded 8010 hours of work on

(Sources: Table 8-3 and Table 8-4)

the Claimant’s case. While the hourly rates of lawyers of different seniority are not set out, the
blended rates for the work of King & Spalding vary from about US$744 per hour for work on the
Reply on the Merits and Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction, to about US$925 per hour for work on
the Rejoinder on Jurisdiction. The blended rate for work at the hearing and post-hearing
submissions is about US$812 per hour. By way of comparison, the Claimant’s Spanish co-counsel
at Gomez-Acebo & Pombo charged blended rates that vary from about US$561 per hour on work
prior to the Request for Arbitration, to US$760 per hour for their work on the Reply on the Merits

and Counter Memorial on Jurisdiction.

436. Atthe same time, the Respondent filed a claim for costs of €1,401,037.36 (which, at current
rates, equates to US$1,588,990.72). In large part, the discrepancy is accounted for by the fact that
the Respondent was represented by counsel employed by the Spanish Ministry of the Attorney

General.

437. The Claimant’s request for US$7,174,320.80 is higher than might be expected in a case of
medium complexity involving investor-state disputes in respect of Spain’s renewable energy
program where these firms (and experts) have already participated in a number of comparable
renewable energy claims against Spain and thus possess considerable prior experience and

accumulated knowledge of the Spanish electricity system and the evolution of the FIT tariffs.

438. The Claimant acknowledges that ICSID tribunals “enjoy wide discretion to allocate costs
between the parties as they see fit.”4?! While the successful party will usually receive an award of
costs, there is no entitlement. Moreover, while a party is free to spend as much money as it sees fit
in pursuing or defending a claim, there is no corresponding obligation on the unsuccessful party

(or the Tribunal) to accept as reasonable or justified the resulting bill of costs.

439. The Parties appear to agree that the correct approach is for the Tribunal to take into account
(1) the relative success of the claims and defences of each of the parties (2) together with the

circumstances of the case and (3) the conduct of the Parties to the proceedings.*?”

B. The Tribunal’s Ruling on Costs

440. The Tribunal here addresses two separate issues on costs: (i) the allocation of costs as
between the Claimant and the Respondent (comprising both the Parties’ respective legal costs and
the costs of the arbitration); and (ii) subject to this first issue, the assessment of the amount of
recoverable legal costs. As to this second issue, the Tribunal notes that the Parties’ claims for legal
costs are both made under Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention and with ICSID Arbitration Rule
47(1)(G), and not as compensation for an internationally wrongful act subject to the Chorzéw

Factory and other principles of international law.*”

441. There is no reason in this case to deny any element of the claim for costs based on the
Parties’ conduct of these proceedings. On the contrary, in the Tribunal’s view, the case was well
conducted, in good faith, at all stages by counsel for both the Claimant and the Respondent,

whose efforts were all of great assistance to the Tribunal, and much appreciated.

442. As to the allocation of costs as between the Parties, with respect to relative success, the
Claimant has been successful in establishing jurisdiction and liability, but it had divided success
in respect of quantum, where the Claimant’s claim has been reduced by 20% for the reasons
discussed earlier in this Award. This reduction does not warrant any award of costs in favour of
the Respondent, however the divided success on the quantum issues should be reflected in a
corresponding reduction in the assessment of the largely successful Claimant’s legal costs to be

recovered from the Respondent (as further addressed below).

443. Asto the assessment of the Claimant’ s legal costs, the Tribunal bears in mind two particular
factors. First, the “loser pays” practice under Article 61 of the ICSID Convention is, in Schreuer’s
words “neither clear nor uniform.”4* There is no entitlement under the ICSID Convention for a
successful party to receive a full indemnity for its legal costs from the losing party. Moreover, the
principle of “loser pays” derives historically from certain common law jurisdictions where a
percentage of the winning party’s legal costs was traditionally “shifted” to the losing party but
only on a “party and party” or “taxed” basis. Such a basis does not provide a full indemnity to the

winning party. Costs may be further reduced in situations of divided success. In common law

*4 Schreuer, The ICSID Convention (2" ed), p. 1229.

156

jurisdictions an award of costs is often taxed in amounts that are considerably less than a party’s
actual costs. Exceptionally, these common law jurisdictions could order indemnity costs in special
situations, usually based upon the status of the claiming party (such as a trustee) or the gross
misconduct of the losing party (for example, where that party had improperly pleaded fraud against
its opponent). There is no such special situation in the present case. In the result, there being no
presumption in favour of full indemnity costs, or indeed any other “default” position with respect
to costs, it is for the Tribunal to determine by whom and in what amount (if any) the costs incurred
by a party for lawyers and experts are to be added to the award. The Tribunal, in the exercise of
its discretion in respect of costs concludes by majority that it will not direct a full indemnity to the

Claimant for its full legal costs.

444. Second, with respect to the circumstances of this case, it is of course true that every claim
presents its own difficulties and challenges (in this case, the Achmea decision presented a
significant added twist). Yet the Spanish renewable energy claims have a public common history
in many respects and public common elements. Moreover, the prior experience of the Claimant’s
law firms in numerous other arbitrations in this sector could be expected to result in a greater
familiarity than in the situation of an isolated one-off case (as also, but still more so, the
Respondent’s legal representatives). The Tribunal does not doubt that the hours claimed by the
Claimant were spent by its law firms. Moreover, the hours were spent with the full approval of the
Claimant, as the client, at a time when it was not assured that it would recover any part of its legal
costs from the Respondent. In making its assessment the Tribunal therefore intends no criticism of

the Claimant or its law firms.

445. The issue remains whether the Respondent should be required to reimburse the Claimant
for its full legal costs in the form of a full indemnity under the ICSID Convention and ICSID
Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal decides that such an outcome would not do justice in the
circumstances of this case. The Tribunal therefore disposes of the claim for legal costs as follows
(i) as regards assessment, a majority of the Tribunal considers applicable the principle that the
decision of a party to mount a generously funded case does not impose on the unsuccessful party
a corresponding obligation to make full reimbursement. Partial reimbursement may well be more
appropriate. A majority also thinks relevant the number of similar claims publicly known and the

involvement of the Claimant’s lawyers in many of them. Taking into account all the circumstances

157

the Tribunal thinks appropriate a modest reduction of 5 % from the Claimant’s claimed sums of
US$6,334,961.01 and €740,076.42 resulting in sums of US$6,018,213 and €703,073 respectively
and (ii) as regards allocation, the Tribunal majority concludes that that the Claimant’s divided
success on quantum should be reflected in a 20% reduction in these two sums, resulting in a net
award for legal costs of US$4,814,570 and €562,458 in favour of the Claimant and against the

Respondent.
Cc. The Tribunal’s Ruling on Costs of the Arbitration

448. With respect to the allocation of the costs of the proceedings under Article 61(2) of the
