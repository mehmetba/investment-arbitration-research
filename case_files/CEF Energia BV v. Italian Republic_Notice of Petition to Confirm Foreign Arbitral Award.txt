Introduction

2. Incentive schemes put in place by Respondent to encourage
investment in renewable energy supply lie at the heart of this
arbitration. Claimant owns, in whole or in majority part, three Italian
companies which operate photovoltaic plants in Italy, and alleges that
certain changes Respondent made (directly and indirectly) to such
incentive schemes engaged international responsibility as a matter of
the ECT. Claimant further alleges that such international
responsibility gives rise to the right on its part to compensation with
the object of putting it into the position its investments would have
been in had the changes to the incentive schemes not taken place.
Apart from jurisdictional objections, Respondent also argucs that the
measures it took do not engage international responsibility on its part,
and, further, Claimant’s investments remained profitable
notwithstanding the changes which were made to the incentive
schemes. The Tribunal, if it has the jurisdiction to do so, resolves
these disputes by this award.

might be required to be brought to our attention concerning the
quantum of the claims.

We have considered the matter and we do not wish to have such
Press reports on the evidential record af the case. Our preference
is that we ask the parties to now liaise on this putative issue,
without copying us, and if, in that process it emerges that there are
matters which we do need to see then we ask that these be brought
to our attention as soon as possible. Please note that the Tribunal
has deliberated, the award is in preparation, and, therefore, what
we are now proposing is not a reopening of the case but confined
only to the possibility of something of importance for the purposes

Prayers for Relief advanced by the Parties — Sequence of Issues

 

 

50. The Tribunal now records the Prayers for Relief, in their latest

51.

iteration, advanced by the Parties in this case.
At paragraph 446 of the Reply the following relief is sought:

* a declaration that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over this dispute;

+ a declaration that Italy has violated the Energy Charter Treaty
and international law with respect to Claimant’s investments;

* compensation to Claimant for all damages it has suffered, as set
forth in Claimant’s submissions and as may be further developed
and quantified in the course of this proceeding;

+ all costs of this proceeding, including (but not limited to)
Claimant's attorneys’ fees and expenses, the fees and expenses of
Claimant's experts, and the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and
the SCC;

* pre-award and post-award compound interest at the highest
lawful rate from the Date of Assessment until Italy’s full and final
satisfaction of the Award; and

+ any other relief the Tribunal deems just and proper.

52. At paragraphs 480-483 of the Rejoinder the following relief is sought:

480. In the light of the above, the Respondent reiterates its requests
to the Tribunal to:

- Decline jurisdiction to decide, as the ECT does not cover intra-
EU disputes.

- Alternatively, decline jurisdiction aver the totality of claims,
since:

- Some of the attacked measures are exempted under Article 21
ECT,

- No amicable solution has heen attempted for some further
measures;

- the exclusivity forum choice contained in the GSE Conventions
bans this Tribunal from judging under the umbrella clause,

- Ina further alternative, decline admissibility of protection of the
Claimant's alleged interests since these are barred from seeking
relief, as they did not seek amicable solution for a number of
claims.

481, Should the Tribunal consider to have jurisdiction over the
case and that claims are either totally or partially admissible,
declare on the merits that

- the Respondent did not violate Article 10(1) ECT, first and
second sentence, since it did not fail to grant fair and equitable
treaiment to the Claimant's investment.

- the Respondent did not violate Article 10{i) ECT, fourth
sentence, either, since it always adopted reasonable and non-
discriminatory measures to affect Claimant's investment.

- Article 10(1) ECT, last sentence (the so-called “umbrella
clause”) does not apply in the case at stake, or, alternatively, that
the Respondent did nat violate it neither through statutory or
regulatory measures, nor the GSE Conventions.

- Consequently, declare that no compensation is due.

482. In the unfortunate event that the Tribunal were to recognize
legitimacy to one of the Claimant’s griefs:

- Declare that damages were not adequately proved.

- In addition, declare that both the methods for calculation and
calculation itself of damages proposed by the Claimant are
inappropriate and erroneous,

- Order the Claimant to pay the expenses incurred by the Italian
Republic in connection with these proceedinys, including
professional fees and disbursements, and to pay the fees and
expenses of the Members of the Tribunal and the charges for the
use of the facilities of the SSC, in accordance with Articles 43 and
44 of SCC 2010 Arbitration Rules.

483. The Respondent reserves the right ta amend and modify its
evaluations on relief and to refine its position in the course of the
arbitration.

53. It is immediately apparent from the respective Prayers for Relicf
advanced by the Parties that a threshold issue of jurisdiction arises in
this case, namely, whether or not the ECT can give rise to an “intra-

EU” arbitration. By the phrase “intra-EU” arbitration the Tribunal
means the issue as to whether the Tribunal Jacks jurisdiction because
either Article 26 ECT is inapplicable to disputcs between an investor
from a EU member State and another EU member Statc, or because
£U law subsequent to the ECT has deprived tribunals established
under Article 26 ECT from their jurisdiction to hear such disputes, If
the answer to that threshold issuc is that the Tribunal lacks
jurisdiction then thcre is no need for further analysis and the case
ends. Thus, the Tribunal will analyze that issue first. It is
uncontroversial to say that this issue does not require an examination
of the underlying facts of this case, but rather it is a matter of Jegal
analysis as to whether or not on 20 November 2015 (the date of the
RfA) there was a valid offer on the part of Respondent to arbitrate
disputes arising from the ECT.

If, on the other hand, the “intra EU" issue is resolved against
Respondent, then there would also remain for analysis the other
jurisdictional and admissibility objections advanced by it. These are
articulated, in outline, in Respondent’s alternative jurisdictional
prayers for relief recorded above. In the Tribunal’s view, given their
nature they fall for consideration not isolated from the facts but as part
of the overall analysis of the merits of the case.

Thus, if the Tribunal goes beyond the threshold issue of “intra-EU”
jurisdiction, it will engage in an analysis of the facts, the merits on
liability {at which time Respondent's other jurisdictional and

issibility objecti will be lyzed), and, i ry if

necessary, the merits on quantum,

 

The Tribunal considers, in its procedural appreciation of the file of
this case, to be the most efficient way to arrange this award.

Jurisdiction — Intra EU

Introduction — the relevant provision in the ECT

57. The Tribunal, first, notes the following provision in the ECT (in
relevant extract):

Article 26 Settlement of Disputes berween an Investor and a
Contracting Party:

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of
another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in
the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an
obligation of the former under Part Ill shall, if possible, be settled
amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on
which either party to the dispute requested umicable settlement, the
Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting
Party to the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(¢) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphy (b) and (c), each
Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of a dispute to international arbitration or conciliation
in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such
unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted
the dispute under subparagraph (2) (a) or (b).

(c) A Contracting Party listed in Annex IA does not give such
unconditional consent with respect to a dispute arising under the
last sentence of Article 10(1).

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for

resolution under subparagraph (2)(c), the Investor shall further
provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

CLARK

 

(¢) an arbitral proceeding under the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce, ...

(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the

issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable

rules and principles of international law.
The overarching question conceming jurisdiction is whether or not, on
the date of the RFA (20 November 2015), Article 26 of thc ECT was
in force as regards Respondent. Claimant says yes, and Respondent
says no (as indeed does the Commission). If it was in force as regards
Respondent, the R£A d an i ji to
arbitrate by which the Tribunal was established to decide the issues in
dispute. If it was not in force on that date, the case comes to an end as
the Tribunal would have no jurisdiction. The Tribunal now proceeds
to resolve that issuc.

By way of introductory observation to the intra-EU jurisdictional
analysis, the Tribunal will arrange this issue broadly into two parts.
First, there is the position advocated by Respondent (and also
advocated by the Commission) from thc outset to the cffect, in
general, that as a matter of treaty interpretation the ECT was not
intended to cover intra-EU disputes (namely, a dispute between an
investor from a member state and another member state); or, treaties
between member states subsequent to the ECT have had the effect of
superscding it. This is the main thrust of Respondent’s (and the
Commission’s) position on jurisdiction. Secondly, a narrower
question, but one to which great importance was attached by
Respondent, took centre-stage after the hearing, namely the
consequences, if any, of Achmea.

Jurisdiction challenge pre-Achmea

60.

Prior to Achmea Respondent's jurisdictional objection was articulated
thus in summary (para. 10, SoD):

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 16

61.

«the ECT does not cover intra-European Union (“EU",
or the Union") disputes: this was not the intention of the
signing parties, nor such interpretation would be
compatible with a combined reading of the ECT and the EU
Treaties as currently in force. Lack of jurisdiction under
this ground would require dismissal of the dispute in its
entirety.

The views, in broadly similar terms, but to an identical outcome,

 

d in the C issi issions were ised as

follows (para. 8);

This brief is organised into four sections. After the present
introduction (Section 1.), the Commission will show, first,
that the interpretation of Article 26 ECT leads to the
conclusion that the offer for entering into arbitration made
by Italy is limited to investors from contracting parties
other than EU Member States and did not create any
international obligations between EU Member States inter
se (Section 2.). it will, then, second, set out that if Article 26
ECT were to be interpreted in the opposite manner, i.e. as
entailing an offer also to EU investors, that that would
constitute a violation of the Treaty on Functioning of
European Union (“TFEU") and that there would be
conflict between two international treaties which both are
part of the law applicable by your Tribunal, namely the
ECT and the TFEU. Said conflict would have to be
resolved, in any case, in favour of the TFEU, either via
interpretation on the basis of context (“harmonious
interpretation” or “systemic integration"} or via the
applicable rules of conflict of laws (Section 3.) On the basis
of these assessments, the Commission will, finally, suggest
a course of action to your Tribunal that involves three
options for proceeding with the present dispute: First,
declare that your Tribunal lacks the competence to hear the
case. Second, suspend the proceeding pending the
preliminary ruling of the ECJ in Achmea y Slovakia, which
is expected to decide on the compatibility of intra-EU
Investor-State Dispute Settlement (“ISDS”) with Union law
Third and finally, should your Tribunal consider that it is
competent to hear the case, which would make it necessary
to analyse the compliance of Italy’s measures with State aid
rules, in particular for assessing whether the claimants had
legitimate expectations, find a solution that respects the

exclusive competence of the Commission in that regard.
(Section 4.).

62. In passing the Tribunal notes that the second of the proposals
suggested by the Commission has becn overtaken by events, namely
that the CJEU has rendered its decision in Achmea. However, as
discussed below the CJEU did not decide, as a matter of EU Law, on
the compatibility of intra-EU Investor-State Dispute Settlement
(“ISDS”) with Union law, rather the outcome of that case was
narrowly articulated by that court, and specific to its circumstances.
Awaiting the outcome of Achmea would not have been of any
assistance.

63. In the Rejoinder, and during the course of the hearing, Respondent
placed particular emphasis on the award in Bfusun as regards the
merits of the case. However, Claimant also invoked Blusun in the
Reply in support of its case as regards jurisdiction. While many other
tribunals have opined on the intra-EU “issue”, considering that
Respondent has particularly approbated Blusun in this case, the
Tribunal, therefore, sets out the pertinent part of the reasoning in
telation to intra-EU jurisdiction and the ECT as articulated by that
tribunal:

B. EU Law and the inter se issue

(a) Admissibility of the inter se argument
BUT sssives

(b) The applicable law

278. The Parties in effect agree that the applicable law in
determining this issue is international law, and specifically
the relevant provisions of the VCLT. The Tribunal agrees,
but would observe that this does not exclude any relevant
rule of EU law, which would fall to be applied either as
part of international law or as part of the law of Italy. The
Tribunal evidently cannot exercise the special jurisdictional

‘SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 18

age 43:piftd Ro. 654707/2019

powers vested in the European courts, but it can and where
relevant should apply European law as such.

(c) The original scope of the ECT

279. As a matter of international law, the first question is
whether the ECT applied to relations inter se of EU
Member States as at the date of its conclusion (December
1994) in accordance with Articles 31-33 of the VCLT.

280, On its face there is nothing in the text of the ECT that
carves oul or excludes issues arising between EU Member
States. (1) The preamble to the ECT records that it intends
to place the commitments contained in [the European
Energy Charter] on a secure and binding international
legal basis. This implies that the scope of the (non-binding)
European Energy Charter of 17 December 1991 was
replicated in binding form in the ECT. There is no
indication of any inter se exclusion in the Charter, which
refers to a ‘new desire for a European-wide and global co-
operation based on mutual respect and confidence’, and
further refers to the ‘support from the European
Community, particularly through completion of its internal
energy market’ (Preamble, paras. 6, 14). The EC and
Euratom were signatories to the Charter. This was of
course before the Treaty of Maastricht, let alone the Lisbon
Treaty, (2) Article 1(2) of the ECT defines ‘Contracting
Party’ as ‘a state or Regional Economic Integration
Organization which has consented to be bound by this
Treaty and for which the Treaty is in force. EU Member
States and the EU are all Contracting Parties, Prima facie
at least, a treaty applies equally between its parties. It
would take an express provision or very clear
understanding between the negotiating parties to achieve
any other result. Thus when Great Britain was asserting
‘the diplomatic unity of the British Empire’, it was argued
from time to time that multilateral treaties to which the
Dominions were separately parties had no inter se
application. The inter se doctrine was not however
accepted, being unsupported by express provision or clear
understanding to the contrary. (3) There is no express
provision (or ‘disconnection clause’, to adopt recent
parlance) in the ECT. (4) While the Respondent and the EC
relied on the travaux preparatoires to justify reading in a
disconnection clause, this is not permissible in a context in
which the terms of the treaty are clear. In any case, the
travaux preparatoires seem to point against implying a
disconnection clause: one was proposed during the course

of the Energy Charter Treaty negotiations, but was
rejected.

281. Neither is there anything in the text to support the
EC's argument that the ECT did not give rise to inter se
obligations because the EU Member States were not
competent to enter into such obligations, The mere fact that
the EU is party to the ECT does not mean that the EU
Member States did not have competence to enter into inter
se obligations in the Treaty. Instead, the ECT seems to
contemplate that there would be overlapping competences.
The term ‘regional economic integration organizations (or
REIO) is defined in Article 1(3) of the ECT to mean an
‘organization constituted by states to which they have
transferred competence over certain matters a number of
which are governed by the ECT, including the authority to
take decisions binding on them in respect of those matters.
The Area of the REIO is also defined by Article 1(10) with
reference to EU law. But nothing in Article 1, nor any other
provision in the ECT, suggests that the EU Member States
had then transferred exclusive competence for all matters of
investment and dispute resolution to the EU.

282. The EC argues that the ‘Member States .. . are ..
presumed to be aware of the rules sens the
ib of ina sup

they have themselves created.’ But if the Members States
thought they did not have competence over the inter se
obligations in the ECT, this would have been made explicit
by including a declaration of competence to set out the
internal division of competence between the EC and its
Member States, as has been done in many other treatics
with mixed membership. Nothing in the text of the ECT
supports the implication of such a declaration of
competence.

283. Pursuant to Article 6 of the VCLT, every State
possesses capacity to conclude treaties and is bound hy
those obligations pursuant to the principle of pacta sunt
servanda. No limitation on the competence of the EU
Member States was communicated at the time that the ECT
was signed. Article 46 of the VCLT provides that a State
may not invoke provisions of its internal law regarding
competence to conclude treaties to invalidate a treaty
unless it was a manifest violation of a rule of fundamental
importance. While EU law operates on both an internal and
international plane, a similar principle must apply. Even if,
as a matter of EC law, the EC has exclusive competence
over matters of internal investment, the fact is that Member

States to the EU signed the ECT without qualification or
reservation. The inter se obligations in the ECT are not
somehow invalid or inapplicable because of an allocation
of competence that the EC says can be inferred from a set
of EU laws and regulations dealing with investment, The
more likely explanation, consistent with the text of the ECT,
is that, at the time the ECT was signed, the competence was
a shared one.

284. The EC relied on its competence argument to argue
that there was also no diversity of territory among the
investors and the host State as required by Article 26, since
both are part of the same ‘Contracting Party’ for its
purposes, It is not necessary for the Tribunal to deal with
this argument, since it has held that the European Member
States remain ‘Contracting Parties' and that the ECT does
create inter se obligations for European Member States.

(@ Subsequent modification of the ECT as to inter se
matlers

285. The Respondent and the EC also argue that, even if the
ECT had originally concerned inter se matters, this was
modified by the fact that the Member States of the EU
subsequently entered into other agreements that covered
both the investment and dispute resolution aspects of the
ECT. The EC states that subsequent EU treaties, such as
the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Treaty of Nice, and the Treaty
of Lisbon, implicitly repealed the earlier ECT under the lex
posterior rule in Article 30 of the VCLT, whereby
‘successive treaties relating to the same subject-matter’ will
prevail over the earlier to the extent that the treaties are not
compatible.

286. Turning first to the substantive investment obligations,
it is not clear how these are incompatible with the
Investment righls protected under European law. The EC
points to the rules establishing the European internal
marke, with free movement of goods, persons, services and
capital, it states that discriminatory measures or
expropriation are not permitted under European law. But
these obligations are arguably broader than those in the
ECT, and are complementary to them. There is no
discrimination unless the same benefits are not accorded to
other EU States, but there is nothing in the ECT that
requires such a result. Were a national of a European State
nat party to the ECT to bring international arbitration
proceedings against a European host State that was a party
to the ECT and had breached investment obligations

NYSCEF DOC. NO.

 

protected under it, that host State would have to determine
whether it could, consistent with its EU obligations, decline
to consent to such jurisdiction. Nothing in the ECT would
prevent the host State from extending its protections beyond
those States that are party to it, if this were required to
meet these obligations. As the tribunal found in Electrabel
vy. Hungary, EU law can be presumed not to conflict or
otherwise be inconsistent with the ECT.

287. The only example the EC pointed to where an
inconsistency might arise between EU and investment law
was the award in Micula v. Romania, In Micula, however,

the tribunal concluded that EU law was not applicable to
the dispute, as Romania had not yet acceded to the EU at
the time the impugned measures were taken (although the

EC appears to have taken the view that FU rules on state

aid did apply during the accession negotiations). Any
conflict thus arose not out of incompatibility of the relevant
BIT with EU law, but out of a disagreement on whether EU
rules applied prior to accession. Afier the Micula award
was issued, the EC notified Romania that it would be in
breach of the EU rules on state aid if it complied with its
obligation under the award to pay damages to the investors
Sor a breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard. In
that context, any conflict related to the implications of
enforcement, not to direct contradictions between the
substantive rules themselves. This was also the conclusion
of both the Micula tribunal and the Micula ad hoc
committee.

288. The Respondent and the EC also argue that the dispute
resolution clause, Article 26 of the ECT, is itself
incompatible with Article 344 of the TFEU, which provides
that ‘Member States undertake not to submit a dispute
concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties
to any method of settlement other than those provided for
therein.’

289. In the view of the Tribunal, there is no such
incompatibility. The dispute before this Tribunal is not an
inter-State dispute. It is a dispute, in the words of Article
26, ‘between a Contracting Party and an Investor of
another Contracting Party’. It is not necessary for this
Tribunal to decide whether Article 27, which concerns
inter-State disputes, would be incompatible with Article 344
of the TFEU. Even if there were such an inconsistency, this
would not also void Article 26, since the later Treaty will
supersede the earlier one only to the extent of any
incompatibility. To find otherwise would disadvantage

investors, who have no ability under European law to
protect their investment by suing the host State directly for
breaches of the ECT. Neither does anything in European
law expressly preclude investor-State arbitration under the
ECT and the ICSID Convention.

290. As noted (paragraph 260(e) above), the Claimants
also relied on the combined effect of the lex specialis and
lex posterior presumptions, the ECT being both more
specific than the EU legal order und subsequent to it.
Having concluded that there is no incompatibility between
the TFEU and the ECT, the Tribunal does not need to
address this argument,

291. For these reasons, the Tribunal holds that the inter se
obligations in the ECT have not subsequently been modified
or superseded by later European law.

(2) The state of the authorities

292. The inira-EU issue has been canvassed in greater or
lesser depth by previous investment tribunals, which have
reached practically common conclusions.

302. Despite the fact that the EC has intervened in many
other intra-EU arbitrations, as far as has been publicly
reported, no tribunal yet has upheld this objection to
Jurisdiction.

303. Overall the effect of these decisions is a unanimous
rejection of the intra-EU objection to jurisdiction. The
tribunal in each case has found that the relevant BIT or the
ECT was intended to bring about binding obligations
between EU Member States. The tribunals found no
contradiction between the substantive provisions of EU law
and the substantive or dispute resolution provisions of the
BITs. No such system for investor- State arbitration exists
in EU law, and it would be incorrect to characterise such
disputes as inter-State disputes such that Article 267 of the
TFEU could he said to preclude jurisdiction. These
conclusions support those adopted by the Tribunal in this
case.

64. Having considered the matter, the Tribunal adopts the reasoning in
Blusun in full. The reasoning is comprehensive and unimpeachable.

a.

‘The Tribunal does not consider it necessary to add or subtract in any

way from the Biusun reasoning.

The Tribunal extrapolates the following points from Blusun for the
purposes of its present jurisdictional analysis.

First, the interpretation argument advanced by Respondent (and by the
Ci ission) which is refe d as the ‘di ion clause’, in
shorthand parlance, does not stand up to scrutiny when the ECT is
interpreted (as the B/usun tribunal did) in an entirely regular and
ordinary manner according to the provisions of the VCLT.

Secondly, nothing in EU law subsequent to the ECT has the effect of
superseding (insofar as Respondent is concemed) the latter.

By way of complctencss the Tribunal also now addresses two further
points on jurisdiction raised by Respondent.

Respondent submits that the rules on state aid, a concept forming part
of EU law, lead to the conclusion that compliance with any award
might transgress such rules at an enforcement stage. Therefore, such
potential transgression (which might arise as a matter of EU law)
denudes the Tribunal now of ECT jurisdiction,

This state aid point was considered, and then dismissed by the tribunal
in Blusun. The Tribunal agrees.

Effectively Respondent’s position is that because there might be some
enforcement issue in the future, deriving from an aspect of EU law
(state aid, it must be recalled, itself was the product of the sovereign
choices of member states, and, in particular for this issue, something
which Respondent itself created through its membership of the EU),
then this must denude the Tribunal of its jurisdiction as a matter of an
entirely separate treaty (the ECT),

72. The Tribunal docs not see how such a proposition can have the far-
reaching effcct on jurisdiction which Respondent suggests. If the
Tribunal were to accede to such a proposition then it would give
support to a sovereign slate being able to avoid an international
promise to arbitrate disputes with a two-fold argument which relies on
rules which such sovereign itself created and simply foreshadows
putative future issues with cnforcement. The Tribunal cannot give
succour to this position, and it is dismissed.

73. Next, Respondent drew upon Case C-459/03 Commission v Ireland
[2006] ECR 1-4635, generally referred to as the MOX Plant Case. The
Tribunal understands this position on the part of Respondent to be
supportive of the main thrust of its case on Achmea, rather than
providing a separate jurisdictional argument. As discussed below,
Achmea, when analysed in detail, does not provide the Respondent (or
the Commission) with legal support for the outcome sought, thus, the
MOX Plant Case docs not fill that gap. The Tribunal does understand
that the MOX Plant Case is, in of itself, utilised as the legal
proposition for bringing intra-EU treaty arbitration to an end.

Achmea

74. As the jurisdicti in this arbitration evolved, particularly
in the aftermath of the hearing, dchmea has moved centre-stage in

 

terms of the importance and significance altached to it by Respondent
(and the Commission).

75, The Commission’s Communication is now quoted, in pertinent part,
to illustrate the foregoing point, with emphasis added,
In the recent preliminary ruling concerning the Achmea

case, the Court of Justice confirmed that investor-State
arbitration clauses in intra-EU BITs are unlawful. (p. 2)

 

The Achmea judgment and its consequences

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 25

  

BSTEMPage SUIS: 654707/2019

RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

In the Achmea judgment the Court of Justice ruled that the
investor-to-State arbitration clauses laid down in intra-EU
BITs undermine the system of legal remedies provided for
in the EU Treaties and thus jeopardise the autonomy,
effectiveness, primacy and direct effect of Union law and
the principle of mutual trust between the Member States.
Recourse to such clauses undermines the preliminary ruling
procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is not
compatible with the principle of sincere cooperation. This
implies that all investor-State arbitration clauses in intra-
EU BITS are inapplicable and that any arbitration
tribunal established on the basis of such clauses lacks
jurisdiction due to the absence of a valid arbitration
agreement. As a consequence, national courts are under the
obligation to annul any arbitral award rendered on that
basis and to refuse to enforce it. Member States that are
parties to pending cases, in whatever capacity, must also
draw all necessary consequences from the Achmea
judgment. Moreover, pursuant to the principle of legal
certainty, they are bound to formally terminate their intra-
EU BITs.

The Achmea judgment is also relevant for the investor-
State arbitration mechanism established in Article 26 of
the Energy Charter Treaty as regards intra-EU relations,
This provision, if interpreted correctly, does not provide
Sor an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between
investors from a Member States of the EU and another
Member States of the EU. Given the primacy of Union
law, that clause, if interpreted as applying intra-EU, is
incompatible with EU primary law and thus inapplicable.
Indeed, the reasoning of the Court in Achmea applies
equally to the intra-EU application of such a clause which,
Just like the clauses of intra-EU BITs, opens the possibility
of submitting those disputes to a body which is not part of
the judicial system of the EU. The fact that the EU is also a
party to the Energy Charter Treaty does not affect this
conclusion: the participation of the EU in that Treaty has
only created rights and obligations between the EU and
third countries and has not uffected the relations between
the EU Member States. (pp. 3-4)

76. Approximately one month before the Commission’s Communication,
the tribunal in Masdar arrived at a quite different conclusion as that
sought by the Respondent (and the Commission). The Tribunal notes
the following passages from that award:

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 26

   

age SlafAlio. 654707/2019

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

678. Upon consideration of the Parties’ respective
submissions and upon analysis, the Tribunal has concluded
that the Achmea Judgment has no bearing upon the present
case.

679. The Achmea Judgment is of limited application ~ first,

and specifically, to the Agreement on encouragement and
reciprocal protection of investment between the Kingdom of
the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak Federal
Republic and, second, in a more general perspective, to any
“provision in an international agreement concluded
between Member States, such as Article 8 of the Agreement
on encouragement and reciprocal protection between the

Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak
Federative Republic.” The ECT is not such a treaty. Thus,

the Achmea Judgment does not take into consideration, and
thus it cannot be applied to, multilateral treaties, such as

the ECT, to which the EU itself is a party.

680. The conclusion of the Tribunal is in line with the
Opinion of Advocate General Wathelet delivered on 19
September 2017 in Achmea. The Advocate General stated
that Achmea was: “the first opportunity [for the CIEU] to
express its views on the thorny question of the compatibility
of BITs concluded between member States and in
Particular of the investor-State dispute settlement {‘ISDS')
mechanisms established by those BITs.” (Emphasis added).
Thus, it is clear that Achmea pertains only to BITs
concluded between EU Member States — as the wording of
question No. (1) referred by the Bundesgerichtshof to the
CJEU likewise confirms: “Does Article 344 TFEU preclude
the application of a provision in a bilateral investment
Protection agreement between Member States of the
European Union (a so called intra-EU BIT) [..]."
(Emphasis added).

681. With specific reference to the ECT, the Advocate
General made the following statement:

“That multilateral treaty on investment in the field
of energy [the ECT] operates even between Member
States, since it was concluded not as an agreement
between the Union and its Member States, of the one
part, and third countries, of the other part, but as an
ordinary multilateral treaty in which all the
Contracting Parties participate on an equal footing.
In that sense, the material provisions for the
protection of investments provided for in that
Treaty and the ISDS mechanism also operate
between Member States. I note that if no EU

institution and no Member State sought an opinion
from the Court on the compatibility of that treaty
with the EU and FEU Treaties, that is because
none of them had the slightest suspicion that it
might be incompatible.” (Emphasis added).

682. Had the CJEU seen it necessary to address the
distinction drawn by the Advocate General between the
ISDS provisions of the ECT and the investment protection
mechanisms to be found in bilateral investment treaties
made between Member States within the ambit of its ruling,
it had the opportunity to do so. In fact, the Tribunal notes
that the CJEU did not address this part of the Advocate
General's Opinion, much less depart from, or reject, it. The
Achmea Judgment is simply silent on the subject of the
ECT, The Tribunal respectfully adopts the Advocate
General's reasoning on this matter, and it relies in
Particular upan the observation in the final sentence cited
above from his Opinion.

683. For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the
Achmea Judgment has no bearing upon its determination of
the matters in issue in this arbitration and it denies
Respondent's Application.

77. Unsurprisingly, Claimant adopts the reasoning in Masdar in support
of its position on jurisdiction. On the other hand, Respondent severely
criticizes the tribunal in Masdar for the cursory manner (in its view)
by which Achmea was analysed, and the conclusion reached in that
regard. Respondent’s heading in its submissions on Masdar leaves no
room for doubt in that regard, with emphasis added:

The Masdar award failed to engage with the Achmea
judgment and used an easy cop out strategy
78. In light of the diametrically-opposed views of the Parties the Tribunal
considers it appropriate to cxamine what it is Achmea decides, and,
importantly, what it does not decide.

79. First, briefly as to the context of Achmea; a dispute arose between
Achmea B,V., a Dutch company, and the Slovak Republic due to
certain governmental changes in the market for private health
insurance. An UNCITRAL tribunal was constituted pursuant to

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 28

Article 8 of the Agreement on encouragement and reciprocal
protection of investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands
and the Czech and Slovak lederative Republic (“the Achmea BIT”).
Frankfurt am Main, Germany, was chosen as the legal seat of that
UNCITRAL tribunal and the arbitral proceedings. The Slovak
Republic raised an objection of lack of jurisdiction, namely, that, as a
result of its accession to the European Union, recourse to an arbitral
tribunal provided for in Article 8(2) of the Achmca BIT was
incompatible with EU law, Achmea B.V. was awarded damages in the
Principal amount of EUR 22.1 million by that UNCITRAL ‘Tribunal.
The Slovak Republic brought an action to set aside that arbitral award
before the German courts, ultimately arriving on appeal at the
Bundesgerichtshof.

80. The Bundesgerichtshof decided to stay the appeal before it and ask
the following questions of the CJEU for a preliminary ruling:

(1) Does Article 344 TFEU preclude the application of a
provision in a bilateral investment protection agreement
between Member States of the European Union (a so-called
intra-EU BIT) under which an investor of a Contracting
State, in the event of a dispute concerning investments in
the other Contracting State, may bring proceedings against
the latter State before an arbitral tribunal where the
investment protection agreement was concluded before one
of the Contracting States acceded to the European Union
but the arbitral proceedings are not to be brought until
afier that date?

Jf Question ! is to be answered in the negative:

(2) Does Article 267 TFEU preclude the application of
such a provision?

If Questions I and 2 are to be answered in the negative:
67) Does the first paragraph of Article 18 TFEU

preclude the application of such a provision under the
circumstances described in Question 1?

81. ‘The Tribunal notes that the first question, in particular, was posed in
wide terms by the Bundesgerichtshof and is not confined to the
Achmea BIT.

82. Rather than answering the widely-drawn question 1 posed by the
Bundesgerichtshof, the CJEU combined questions 1 and 2, but also
added a qualifying phrase (emphasis added):

31. By its first and second questions, which should be
taken together, the referring court essentially asks whether
Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as
precluding a provision in an international agreement
concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the
BIT, under which an investor from one of those Member
States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments
in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the
latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose
Jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.

83. The CJEU then set out a number of general considerations found in
EU law which are now quoted in full:

32. In order to answer those questions, it should be
recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, an
international agreement cannot affect the allocation of
powers fixed by the Treaties or, consequently, the autonomy
of the EU legal system, observance of which is ensured by
the Court, That principle is enshrined in particular in
Article 344 TFEU, under which the Member States
undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method
of settlement other than those provided for in the Treaties
(Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18
December 2014, EU:C:2014:2454, paragraph 201 and the
case-law cited).

33 Also according to settled case-law of the Court, the
autonomy of EU law with respect both to the law of the
Member States and to international law is justified by the
essential characteristics of the EU and its law, relating in
particular to the constitutional structure of the EU and the
very nature of that law, EU law is characterised by the fact
that it stems from an independent source of law, the
Treaties, by its primacy over the laws of the Member States,

and by the direct effect uf a whole series of provisions
which are applicable to their nationals and to the Member
States themselves, Those characteristics have given rise to
@ structured network of principles, rules and mutually
interdependent legal relations binding the EU and its
Member States reciprocally and binding its Member States
to each other (see, to that effect, Opinion 2/13 (Accession of
the EU te the ECHR) of 18 December 2014,
EU:C:2014:2454, paragraphs 165 to 167 and the case-law
cited).

34 EU law is thus based on the fundamental premiss that
each Member State shares with all the other Member
States, and recognises that they share with it, a set of
common values on which the EU is founded, as stated in
Article 2 TEU. That premiss implies and justifies the
existence of mutual trust between the Member States that
those values will be recognised, and therefore that the law
of the EU that implements them will be respected, It is
precisely in that context that the Member States are
obliged, by reason inter alia of the principle of sincere
cooperation set out in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3)
TEU, to ensure in their respective territories the
application of and respect for EU law, and to take for those
Purposes any appropriate measure, whether general or
particular, to ensure fulfilment of the obligations arising
out of the Treaties or resulting from the acts of the
institutions of the EU (Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU
to the ECHR) of 18 December 2014, EU:C:2014:2454,
paragraphs 168 and 173 and the case-law cited).

35 In order to ensure that the specific characteristics
and the autonomy of the EU legal order are preserved, the
Treaties have established a judicial system intended to
ensure consistency and uniformity in the interpretation of
EU law (Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the ECHR)
of 18 December 2014, EU:C:2014:2454, paragraph 174),

36 = In that context, in accordance with Article 19 TEU, it
ls for the national courts and tribunals and the Court of
Justice to ensure the full application of EU law in all
Member States and to ensure judicial protection of the
rights of individuals under that law (see, to that effect,
Opinion 1/09 (Agreement creating a unified patent
litigation system) of 8 March 2011, EU:C:2011:123,
paragraph 68; Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the

paragraph 33).

37 In particular, the judicial system as thus conceived
has as its keystone the preliminary ruling procedure
provided for in Article 267 TFEU, which, by setting up a
dialogue between one court and another, specifically
between the Court of Justice and the courts and tribunals of
the Member States, has the object of securing uniform
interpretation of EU law, thereby serving to ensure its
consistency, its full effect and its autonomy as well as,
ultimately, the particular nature of the law established by
the Treaties (Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the
ECHR) of 18 December 2014, EU:C:2014;2454, paragraph
176 and the case-law cited),

38 The first and second questions referred for a
preliminary ruling must be answered in the light of those
considerations.

The Tribunal notes that, having set out a number of gencral
considerations (which are of general application in EU Jaw), the
CIEU then discusses the precise circumstances of the Achmea BIT.
This analysis of the Achmea BIT is particularly important as it
informs the exact rationale for the answers given by the CJEU to the
Bundesgreichtshof.

The CJEU, first, sought to asccriain whether the disputes which a
tribunal established according to Article 8 of the Achmea BIT might
be called on to resolve are liable to relate to the interpretation or
application of EU law (cmphasis added, and this is language
particularly relied upon by Respondent). In that regard it refers to
Article 8(6) of the Achmea BIT (emphasis added):

 

6. The arbitral tribunal shail decide on the basis of the
law, taking into account in particular though not
exclusively:

— the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

— the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant
agreements between the Contracting Parties;

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

the provisions of special agreements relating to the
investment;
— the general principles of international law.

86. This precise language led the CJEU to the conclusion that a tribunal
established pursuant to Article 8 of the Achmea BIT may, in two
tespects, be called on to interpret or, indeed, to apply EU law,
particularly the provisions concerning the fundamental freedoms,
including freedom of establishment and free movement of capital.

87. The Tribunal notes that the use of the word “shall” in the introductory
paragraph of Article 8(6) of the Achmea BIT compels the conclusion
that any such tribunal was inevitably going to decide a dispute
according to EU Jaw, amongst others. The two emphasised sub-
paragraphs recorded just above are not options, but part of the matters
to which such a tribunal would mandatorily be taking into account.

88. The CJEU, secondly, analysed whether a tribunal established pursuant
to Article 8 of the Achmca BIT was a court or tribunal within the
meaning of Article 267 of the TFEU. The answer was readily found,
namely, that it was not such a court or tribunal.

89. Thirdly, the CJEU analysed the extent of judicial review available at
the seat, namely, Frankfurt am Main. It noted that paragraph 1059(2)
of the Code of Civil Procedure (part of Germany's /ex arbitri)
provides only for limited review, concerning in particular the validity
of the arbitration agreement under the applicable law and the
consistency with public policy of the recognition or enforcement of
the arbitral award. Specifically, in relation to commercial arbitration,
the CJEU has held that the requirements of efficient arbitration
proceedings justify the limited review of arbitral awards by courts of
EU Member States, “provided that the fundamental! provisions of
EU faw can be examined in the course of that review and, if
necessary, be the subject of a reference to the Court for a

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 33

92.

 

preliminary ruling” (the Tribunal’s emphasis, and arising from the
landmark 1999 decision of the CJEU in what is routinely referred to
as Eco Swiss).

However, the CJEU found (for reasons which do not readily emerge
from its reasoning) that the circumstances of Article 8 of the Achmca
BIT do not permit a similar review of awards which attach to
commercial arbitrations (in the manner mandated by Eco Swiss). The
Tribunal infers from this, in the specific instance of dispute between
Achmea B.V. and the Slovak Republic, that even if the German courts
could examine the arbitral award of 7 December 2012 in light of
fundamental provisions of EU law (which they can do due to Eco
Swiss), that was not a satisfactory (for the CJEU) answer to the
reformulated questions.

The CJEU then articulated its conclusion, which is now recorded in
full;

56. Consequently, having regard to all the
characteristics of the arbitral tribunal mentioned in Article
8 of the BIT and set out in paragraphs 39 to 55 above, it
must be considered that, hy concluding the BIT, the
Member States parties to it established a mechanism for
settling disputes between an investor and a Member State
which could prevent those disputes from being resalved ina
manner that ensures the full effectiveness of EU law, even
though they might concern the interpretation or application
of that law.

The Tribunal makes two observations which arise from this
conclusion of the CJEU. The reasoning stems entirely from the
specific circumstances of the Achmea BIT, and is not based on any
other BIT or a wider ISDS enquiry (particularly, not the ECT); and,
secondly, the recourse which might be had against the arbitral award
of 7 December 2012 before the German courts, which includes (as a
matter of Eco Swiss) an examination in light of fundamental
principles of EU law, is, in the view of the CJEU, insufficient to

ensure the full effectiveness of EU law, and, further, could prevent
such full effectiveness. It is unclear from the reasoning of the CJEU
as to why this is the case, but, given that Achmea docs not address the
ECT, the Tribunal does not dwell any further on this point.

93. The further conclusion which the CJEU then draws is as follows:

Article 8 of the BIT is such as to call into question not only
the principle of mutual trust between the Member States but
also the preservation of the particular nature of the lav
established hy the Treaties, ensured by the preliminary
ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, and is
not therefore compatible with the principle of sincere
cooperation referred to in paragraph 34 above.... In those
circumstances, Article 8 of the BIT has an adverse effect on
the autonomy of EU law.

94. Having reached these conclusions, the CJEU answers the question

which it reformulated (as recorded above) from the questions poscd
by the Bundesgerichtshof in the following manner:

Consequently, the answer to Questions 1 and 2 is that
Articles 267 and 344 TFEU must be interpreted as
precluding a provision in an international agreement
concluded between Member States, such as Article 8 of the
BIT, under which an investor from ane of those Member
States may, in the event of a dispute concerning investments
in the other Member State, bring proceedings against the
latter Member State before an arbitral tribunal whose
jurisdiction that Member State has undertaken to accept.

95. The Tribunal notes that the predicate word for the answer given by the
CJEU to the question it posed itself is “consequently” which, thus,
plainly draws on the preceding analysis of Article 8 of the Achmea
BIT, and not {as question | posed by the Bundesgerichtshof sought) a
wider discussion of ISDS clauses in BITs,

96. Considcring Achmea, thus, in full, the Tribunal draws a number of

conclusions as follows:

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 35

      

FILED: NEW ZQRK -

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4

(a) the answer given by the CJEU is confined, on a full, rather than
selective analysis of the whole judgment, to the specific context of
Article 8 of the Achmea BIT only;

(b) the question, of wider application to ISDS clauscs, posed by the
Bundesgerichtshof was not answered so, therefore, no view can be
inferred as to the compatibility of such clauses with EU law insofar as
the opinion of the CJEU is concemed. Had the CJEU wished to
answer the widcly-drawn questions posed by the Bundesgerichtshof,
then presumably it would have done so;

(c) the mandatory requirement in Article 8(6) of the Achmea BIT for
a tribunal constituted under that treaty to decide a disputc according,
amongst others, to (i) “the law in force of the Contracting Party
concemed” and (ii) “the provisions of this Agreement, and other
relevant agreements between the Contracting Partics” was the treaty
language which transgressed EU law;

(d) the CJEU does not go so far as to say that the Slovak Republic or
the Kingdom of the Netherlands are barred from offcring to enter into
arbitration agreements. Rather, the Tribunal understands the position
to be more correctly that the objection by Respondent (and the
Commission) forming of what it says is the gravamen of Achmea is to
the extent of the authority given to such a tribunal to decide a dispute,
amongst others, according to the two EU law aspects already noted
above. Put another way, il appcars that EU member states may bring
such arbitral tribunals into being, but, according to the position
adopted by Respondent and the Commission, they arc not allowed by
EU law to authorise such arbitral tribunals to interpret or apply such
law; and

(e) the CIEU does not make any comment on, nor does it gainsay the
authority of that UNCITRAL tribunal to rule according to the general

principles of international law. Its sole concern revolves around the
two parts of Article 8(6) of the Achmea BIT which it says engage the
application or interpretation of EU law.

97. Drawing upon the foregoing conclusions from Achmea for the
purposes of this case, the Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in Masdar
that the judgment is, in of itsclf, of limited apptication (only, insofar
as EU law is concerned, to the Achmea BIT) and, further, of no
application as such to the ECT. Respondent’s criticism of the
approach taken by the tribunal in Masdar appears to the Tribunal as
unwarranted in view of the CJEU’s answers to its own reformulated
questions.

98. In light of the above reasoning and conclusions concerning the lack of
direct impact of Achmea as undermining the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal, the Tribunal is not convinced that its conclusions should be
modified because of the position taken by the Commission in its
Communication (quoted above at para. 75). The Tribunal considers
that a proper reading of the Achmea does not lead to the conclusion
that “(T]he Achmea judgment is also relevant for the investor-State
arbitration mechanism established in Article 26 of the ECT as regards
intra-EU relations”. Nor is the Tribunal convinced for the reasons
stated above that “[TJhis provision, interpreted correctly docs not
provide for an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between
investors from a Member State of the EU and another Member State
of the EU”

99. The Tribunal restates that it is called, in this dispute, to resolve the
alleged breach by Respondent of Art. 10(1) ECT on the basis of
principles of public international Jaw relevant to the interpretation and
application in the present case of the ECT, a multilateral treaty in
force and applicable also between The Netherlands and Respondent.
‘The Tribunal is thercfore unable to read Achmea as supporting the

within the EU, the Communication is not an authoritative statement of

renewable energy production in Italy. Next, there will be a description
of each of the five Conto Energia Decrees which were implemented

which operate photovoltaic plants and the agreements concerning the
incentives for their respective output. Thereafler, the Tribunal records
the facts surrounding the measures taken by Respondent of which
Claimant makes complaint. These are all matters which the Tribunal
considers, in light of the submissions received from the Parties, to be

factually uncontroversial. The Tribunal has been assisted,
considerably, by the Parties in this regard in the manner that they have
not engaged in needless factual disputes, but rather have dwelt upon
the more important issues as to whether or not the measures taken by
Respondent engage international responsibility as a matter of the
ECT.

104, For the avoidance of doubt, the summary of facts (i.e. the historical
context, the five Conto Energia Decrees, and the outline of the three
Italian companies purchased by Claimant) which follows should not
be taken as setting out material anterior findings. The summary of
facts has the purpose of putting into broad context for the reader the
background to this case. Analysis of material issues which might, or
might not, he a trigger for the disposition of claims follow in a later
part of this Award.

Historical Context

105. From the early 1980s onwards Respondent has promoted and
encouraged the development and use of rencwable energy sources.
Given that Italy is a country blessed with abundant sunshine for much
of the year, photovoltaic generation of electricity was clearly of
considerable importance,

106. In particular, Respondent’s Law No. 9 of January 9, 1991, simplified
the authorization procedure for the production of energy from
renewable sources, Regional governments were required to develop
plans prioritizing the production of encrgy from renewable sources,

107. In 1992, Respondent established the first fixed feed-in tariff for
renewable energy production through its CIP6/92 regulation. That

lation allowed ble energy prodi to produce el
from renewable sources without any capacity limit and established a

remuneration procedure based on kilowatt-hours of electricity

produced. The CIP6/92 regulation also provided some ceriainty to
investors because it obligated ENEL S.p.A., Respondent’s electricity
company, ta buy all clectricity produccd from renewable energy
sources, By 1997, 16% of Italy’s electricity was being produced from
renewable energy sources.

Respond inued to i in its developing
Tenewable energy sector by enacting Legislative Decree No. 79 on
March 16, 1999. Known as the Bersani Decree, that act encouraged
electricity production from renewable cnergy sources by prioritizing
their access to the grid. The Bersani Decree also obligated gencrators
and importers of electricity from non-renewable sources beyond a
certain threshold to inject a portion of electricity from renewable
sources into the grid. To satisfy that obligation, the non-renewuble

or i could p a ing amount of

renewable energy from other producers, or from the GSE, or they
could purchase “green certificates” from third parties.

Developments leading to the "Conto Energia” Decrees

109,

On 27 September 2001, the European Parliament and the Council
enacted Directive 2001/77/EC, promoting clectricity produced from
renewable energy sources in the internal electricity market. That
directive set national targets for cach member state for renewable
energy production in light of the EU’s stated objective of having
22.1% of total Community electricity consumption gencrated from
renewable energy sources by 2010. Respondent was expected to
produce 25% of its total electricity consumption from rencwable
energy sources by 2010. That directive was subsequently replaced by
Directive 2009/28/EC, which aimed to achicve a 20% share of energy
from renewable sources in the Community’s gross final consumption
of energy by 2020. It required that EU member states report on
planned or existing measures put in place to meet those targets. It also

tequired EU member states to adopt indicative targets for the
following 10 years. For Respondent, the target was for 17% of overall
energy consumption to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.

110, In light of the fact that the cost of producing electricity from
rencwable sources was substantially higher than the cost of producing
electricity from fossil fuels, in order to meet its target, Respondent

idered it fit to i and abi ket i i
that would further devclop and encourage investments in its

 

renewable energy sector. Thus, on 29 December 2003, Respondent
enacted Legislative Decree No. 387, the goal of which was to
“promote a greater contribution from renewable energy sources to the
production of electricity in the Italian and European markets.” Article
7 thereof, which addressed solar power, stated that Respondent would

facilities, Accordingly, from 2005 to 2012, Respondent enacted
incentive schemes for photovoltaic plants known as Conto Energia

113, Conto I provided that qualifying photovoltaic plants had the right
(“diritto”) to receive a specific incentive tariff for a twenty-year
period. The tariff rate was paid to the producer per kilowatt-hour of
electricity it produced, on top of whatever sale price the producer also
obtained for its electricity. Conto J established tariff rates for eligible
plants authorized in 2005 and 2006 on the basis of the facility’s
nominal capacity: 0.445€/kWh for plants between 1 kW and 20 kW;
0.460€/kWh for plants between 20 kW and 50 kW; and 0.490€/kWh
for plants between 50 kW and 1 MW. ‘The rates offered to eligible
facilities after 2006 were slightly lower.

Conto I required anyone who wished to develop a solar facility and
benefit from the incentives to submit a request for the incentive tariff,
along with a commitment to obtain the necessary authorizations for
the construction and operation of the plant. Once provisionally
authorized to benefit from the programme, the investor then had six to
twelve months (depending on the plant’s capacity) to commence
construction of the facility and twelve to twenty-four months to
complete construction and connect the facility to the grid. Failure to
meet those deadlines would result in loss of the right to the incentive
tariffs.

115, Confirmation of the right to the incentive tariffs under Conto [ was
established by a formal letter from the GSE, which communicated the
specific tariff rate that it agreed to pay for a twenty-year period to the
company or person that held the project rights to a photovoltaic plant
(ie., the “soggetto responsabile”). This is reflected in Art. 7.7 of
Conto I:

Within 90 days following the deadlines provided for
transmission of the applications under paragraph I, the
implementing body (soggetto attuatore) shall communicate
the outcome under paragraphs 4 and 5 to the plant
operators (soggetti responsabili) who sent the application
under paragraph |. The implementing body shall also

under paragraph 5, article 5 and article 6 (2), of the
amount of the incentive tariff actually awarded for a period
of twenty years commencing from the date of operation of
the plant.

116. ‘The letter served as the basis for a contract that the producer and the
GSE would subsequently execute. In outline, such a contract indicated
that it was effective as of the date on which the producer connected
the plant to the grid and that it would terminate twenty years later.
Amendments to the contract could only be made in writing by mutual
agreement between the producer and the GSE.

117. Some of the pertinent provisions of a sample Conto J contract are now
recorded by the Tribunal:

Article 1
Purpose of the agreement

This agreement concerns the recognition by GSE to the
Producer of the contribution due to electricity generated
by solar power through photovoltaic conversion and
incentivized pursuant to Legislative Decree 387/03, art. 7
of MAP decrees dated 28/07/2005 and 06/02/2006,
ALEG. resolution no. 188/05 as subsequent amended

Article 2
Effective date and value of the incentive

For a period of twenty years as of 08/04/2009, the
incentive tariff to be recognized to the phatoveltaic plant
concerned under this agreement is equal to 0.46 G/kWh.

Article 3
Incentives payment methods

The pavment of the incentive tariffs shall be made by GSE

according to the measures defined in art. 3-bis of A.E.E.G.

methods regulated by such resolution. With respect to art, 3
bis of A.E.E.G. resolution no. 40/06, GIOVA SOLAR SRL is
the party responsible for the survey, registration and
communication to GSE of the measurements on the
incentivized photovoltaic energy. GSE provides for the
payment of the incentive tariffs with value date as of the last
day of the month following the one in which the “Payment

“Payment Date” falls on a holiday, the payment is
arranged with value date as of the following business day.

GSE shall arrange for the payment of the incentive tariffs by
crediting the amounts to the bank aecount specified by the
Producer in the “data registration form for the purpose of
incentive tariffs payment”, mentioned in the introductory
section of this agreement.

Article 8
Effective date and duration of the agreement

This agreement is effective from 08/04/2009 and shall
expire on 07/04/2029, This contract is deemed as legally
terminated and having ceased to produce effects for the
Parties should the Producer be faulty on the prohibitions
and forfeitures defined in art. 10 of Law 575/1965 as

On 19 February 2007, the Ministry of Economic Development of
Respondent cnacted a second Conto Energia (“Conto II”) with a
stated goal of implementing a simplified, stable, and durable system
to access the photovoltaic incentives. One of the recitals to Conto I]
makes this intention explicit:

Jt being held that it is necessary to introduce corrections to
the mechanism introducing a simplified system for
accessing incentives, which is both stable and lasting

Conto IT changed Conto J in two principal respects.

First, it eliminated the preliminary authorization phase that previously
existed and instead required electricity producers to request the
benefit of the incentive tariff upon the facility’s entry into operation.
This simplified the enrolment process and avoided the problem of
investors being granted capacity that was never realized. It also meant
that investors bore the development and construction risks of their
investments, because the tariff rates decrcased progressively over time
and the rate granted to a given facility was established only when the
facility entered into operation.

Secondly, Conto H increased the capacity thresholds for receiving
incentive tariffs to include plants over 1 MW and to an aggregate
installed capacity of 1,200 MW. It also established a variety of tariff
rates that were based on sophisticated technical criteria of a given
plant, including a facility’s nominal capacity and other characteristics
such as the plant’s size and whether it was partially or totally
integrated, As with Conta I, the Conto H/ rates were paid to producers
per kilowatt hour of electricity produced, regardless of the sale price
of the electricity that the producers also reccived. The Conto I] tariffs

were slightly lower than those offered in Conto I. Conto II expressly
stated, at Art. 6(1), that “/TJhe tariff identified ..... is awarded for a
period of twenty years commencing from the date of entry into
operation of the plant and shall remain constant in current currency

Jor the entire twenty year period.”

122. ‘The tariff rates established in Conto I] were available to eligible
plants entering into operation in 2007 and 2008, with slightly reduced
tariffs available to facilities entering into operation afler 2008. ‘The
Conto I] tariffs were available until the aggregate installed capacity of
photovoliaic plants in Haly reached 1,200 MW, although facilitics that
connected to the grid within fourteen months of the date on which
Italy reached the 1,200 MW threshold would also receive the tariffs.

123, In line with Respondent’s goal of making photovoltaic investments
more competitive until the technology matured and their costs
decreased, Conto IF stated that the Ministry of Economic
Development would issue a subsequent decree revising the incentive
tariffs for photovoltaic plants connected to the grid after 2010, taking
into account energy products and component price trends as well as
technological monitoring from the ENEA. In practice, through the
Salva Alcoa decree (Law Decree 8 July 2010, n. 105), Respondent
later extended the Conto JI incentive tariffs to plants entering into
operation after 2010.

124. The implementation of Conto I was furthered through the
“Implementation of the Decree of the Minister of Economic
Development, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment,
Land and Sea February 19, 2007, for the purpose of promoting the
production of electricity using photovoltaic plants” by the AEEG,

Article 8.1

The incentive rate is recognized to the parties responsible
allowed under Article 5 for twenty years from:

a)The date of entry into the facility, for photovoltaic
systems that became operational after the date of entry into

b) The first day of the month following that in which they

systems came into operation in the period between I
October 2005 and the date of entry into force of this
provision and which comply with the provisions Article 4,
paragraph 7 of the Ministerial Decree of 19 February
2007.

Article 5.2 thereof states that tariff amount is specified by
GSE in the communication on the admission to the support
regime; therefore, if we combine Article 5.2 with Article 8
the result is that the tariff amount as accorded by GSE is
Jixed for 20 years,
A Conto IT contract was, in broad terms (save for the amount of the
incentive and the relevant dates) the same as that set out above for

Conto I.

Respondent’s Ministry of Economic Development enacted reduced
tariffs (in comparison with Conto I) in a third Conto Energia (“Conto
If) on 6 August 2010. As with the previous two Conto Energias,
Conto II] granted qualifying photovoltaic plants the right (diritto) to
receive a specific incentive tariff that would remain constant for a 20-
year period starting from the date of the plant’s connection to the grid.
Conto I] established a range of tariffs for various facilities entering
into operation from 2011 through 2013 and provided that the Ministry
of Economic Development would issue a subsequent decree
establishing the rates for incentive tariffs offered to plants connected
to the grid after 2013. The Conto II tariffs were available until the
aggregate installed capacity of photovoltaic plants admitted to the

programme reached 3,000 MW. Plants that were connected to the grid
within 14 months of the date on which Italy reached the 3,000 MW
threshold would also receive the Conto Jif tariffs.

127. The implementation of Conto JI was furthered through the
“Deliberation implementing Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010 (Third
Energy Bill)”, by AEEG, quoted in relevant part:

Article 31
The incentive rate and the increase if any are approved {...)

a) for twenty years from the date of entry into the facility, for

5) for twenty years, minus the period between the date of entry

issuance of implementing Legislative Decrces, such as the “Romani
Decree” No. 28/2011 of 3 March 2011. Among its guiding principles,
Article 17 of Law 96/2010 (“Mcasures for conforming the national
legal system to the Community's legislation on energy and recovery
of garbage”) stated al para.!(h) that “in preparing the implementing
legislative decrees...the Government shall follow...also the following
guiding guideli (h) adjusting and hening the ii i
system of renewable energy sources and of energy saving, without
new or additional burdens for the public finance...”

‘The Romani Decree sought thus to balance several competing factors
relevant to the photovoltaic market. On one hand, Respondent wanted
fo maintain (i) equitable remuneration for investors, given that
photovoltaic facilities stil] needed above-market incentives to
compete with traditional electricity producers, and (ii) the confidence
of investors by ensuring a constant rate of incentives throughout a
fixed time period equal to the average useful life of a facility,
reinforced through a contract with the GSE. On the other hand,
Respondent wanted to adjust the tariffs to account for cost reductions
in photovoltaic technology and to reduce costs of electricity for
consumers. The Romani Decree contemplated gradual regulatory
monitoring and controls, while “safeguarding investments already

‘The Tribunal notes, in particular, that Article 24(d), which is recorded
below, of the Romani Decree provides for private law agreements for
the assignment of applicable incentives. As noted already, each of
Contos J, Ii, and IH required formal contracts as the consummation of
the arrangements for incentives.

The Romani Decree altered the mechanics of Conto Lf! by limiting the
availability of the Conto II] tariffs to photovoltaic plants that were
connected to the grid by 31 May 2011 (instead of by 31 December

2013, as originally contemplated). Plants connected after that date
would receive different incentive tariffs, to be established in a future
decree. Furthermore, the Romani Decree introduced limitations on the
eligibility of plants receiving incentive tariffs, based on their size,

organization, and zoning of land.

133. The Tribunal now records aspects of the Romani Decree (with
emphasis added):

Art, 23 — General principles

1. This Section provides for the new regulation of support
regime dedicated to RES based energy und energy
efficiency through the reorganization and improvement of
current support mechanisms. The new rules provide for a
general framework aimed at promoting renewable sources
energy generation and energy efficiency to the extent
adequate to reach the targets set forth in art. 3 hereof, by
Setting criteria and tools that promote effectiveness,
efficiency, streamlining and overtime stability of the
support regimes as well as pursue the harmonization with
other tools designed for alike purposes together with the
reduction of support costs charged to end-users.

2. Gradual intervention to safeguard investments made
and proportionality to the targets are further general
principles af the reorganizution and improvement of
support regime reform, as well as flexibility of support
regimes’ structure, in order to take into account market
dynamics and technology evolution of renewables and
energy efficiency.

Art, 24 Incentive mechanisms

1. The production of electricity from plants using renewable
Sources that enter into operation afier December 31, 2012,

will be promoted through the instruments and according to
the general criteria set out in paragraph 2 and the specific
criteria set out in paragraphs 3 and 4. The safeguard of
non-incentivized plants is ensured through the mechanisms
under art. 8 hereof.

RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019}

2. The production of electricity by the plants referred to in
paragraph | is supported on the basis of the following
general criteria:

a) the incentive has the purpose of ensuring a fair
remuneration of the investment and operating costs;

5) the period one is entitled to receive the incentive all
through is equal to the average conventional lifecycle of
specific kind of plant, and starts from the date of entry into
operation thereof;

¢) the incentive remains constant throughout the support
period to which one is entitled under the law and may take
into consideration the economic value of energy
produced;

d) the incentives are assigned by way of private law
agreements between the GSE and the plant owner
(soggetto responsabile), based on a sample agreement
approved by the Authority of Electricity and Gas within 3
months as of the entry into force of the first of the decrees
as per para S herein.

On 5 May 2011, Respondent’s Ministry of Economic Development
enacted Conto IV as a matter of the Romani Decree requirement that it
issue revised incentive tariffs for facilities connected to the grid after
31 May 2011. The rates established in Conto JF were based, amongst
others, the goal of progressively decreasing tariffs to achieve a
gradual alignment with the aciual cost of the technology, while
maintaining stability and certainty in the market.

In particular, Conto JV noted that, in light of the cvolution of
photovoltaic technology, “grid parity” would be achieved within a
few years. “Grid parity” occurs when photovoltaic plants can gencrate
power at an equal or lower cost than the price of purchasing power
from the electricity grid. In Respondent’s view, once producers
achicved grid parity, it would no longer be necessary to incentivize
the development of new facilities. At the same time, Confo IV

confirmed the importance of additional incentive tariffs to ensure an
increase of installed capacity in the immediate future.

136. As with the previous Conto Energia decrees, Conto IV provided that
those producers that connected qualifying photovoltaic plants to the
grid between 31 May 2011, and 31 December 2016, had the right
(diritto) to receive a specific incentive tariff, which would remain
constant, for a twenty-year period starting from the date of the plant’s
connection to the grid. Respondent established different values for
Conto IV incentive tariffs for each month of 2011, each semester of
2012, and the first semester of 2013 on the basis of a plant’s nominal
capacity and other technical characteristics. It also established a
registry for appli so that Respondent could monitor i

during each month or semester. Conto IV stated that a reduced tariff,

to be determined at a later date, would apply to new plants connected

to the grid beginning in the second semester of 2013.

137. Nevertheless, once Respondent granted a tariff value to a facility,
according to the text of Conto JV, the incentive granted would remain
constant for twenty years, as was the case with the previous Conto
arrangements.

138, Conto IV also included new measures to moderate the growth of the
total cost of the incentive tariff system for photovoltaic facilities,
noting that the total cost would likely reach €3.5 billion euros per
annum by 2011. Those measures included limits on the amount of
incentive tariffs granted to new facilities per semester, beyond which
the incentive tariffs would no longer be available for new facilities
during that semester. Respondent also proposed an overall cap on the
total photovoltaic capacity that could benefit from incentive tariffs
and a corresponding cost threshold: Conto [V established a national
objective for cumulative nominal installed photovoltaic capacity of 23
GW, which would correspond to a total annual cost of €6-7 billion for

all of the Conto Energia incentive tariffs. Respondent's Ministry of
Economic Development was entitled, though not obligated, to revise
the incentive tariffs for future plants when Italy reached the €6 billion
threshold, “favouring in any event the further development of the

sector.”

As with the three previous Conto Energia decrees, under Conto IV,
the GSE entered into contracts with producers whose plants benefited
from the incentive tariffs, which confirmed the tariff rate granted to
the facilities. The contracts were to remain in force for the same
twenty-year period stated in the Conto itself.

The Tribunal now records the part of Confo /V setting out access to
the incentive tariffs;

Article 10

Transmission of documentation on operational date of the
plant and access to incentive tariffs

J. Within fifteen calendar days of the operational date of
the plant the plant operator (soggetto responsabile) is
under an obligation to send GSE a request for the pertinent
i tariff, fete with all de provided
under annex 3-C. Failure to comply with the deadlines
under this paragraph involves inadmissibility of the
incentive tariffs for the period between the operational date
and the date of communication to GSE, without prejudice to
entitlement to the applicable tariff at the operational date.

2. For the purposes of paragraph 1, the grid managers are
under an obligation to connect the plants to the electricity
grid within the terms established by the Authority for
electricity and gas resolution no, ARG/elt 99/08 as
subsequently amended.

3. Following verification of compliance with the provisions
of this decree, GSE will establish and guarantee payment of
the tariff owed to the plant operator (soggetto responsabile)
within one hundred and twenty days of the date of receipt of
the application, excluding times imputable to the plant
operator,

4. Transfer of a photovoltaic plant, or of the building or
property unit on which the plant is located together with the
plant itself, must be notified to GSE within 30 days of the
date of registration of the transfer.

5. The period of entitlement to the incentive tariffs under
this decree is considered net of any suspensions due to
problems connected to grid safety or following catastrophic
events recognised as such by the competent authorities.

Conto V

141. By carly 2012, Respondent approached the €6 billion threshold for its
incentive tariffs program anticipated in Conto IV. Respondent also
determined that as of year-end 2011, renewable electricity production
capacity was 94 TWh per year, only 6 TWh short of its 2020 target of
100 TWh, Therefore, Respondent considered that it was well on its
way to meeting its EU targets. Thus, in accordance with the Conto IV
provision that it could issue new tariffs once Respondent met the €6
billion cost threshold, on 5 July 2012, its Ministry of Economic
Development enacted the fifth and final Conto Energia. Conta V
stated that it would enter into force 45 days afler the AEEG issued a
resolution announcing that the total cost of the incentive tariffs had
reached €6 billion. The AEEG issued that resolution on 12 July 2012,
and Conto V entcred into force on 27 August 2012.

142. In Conto V, Respondent noted that technological progress and
economics of scale had contributed to a rapid decrease in the cost of
photovoltaic plants, and that this decrease had caused a similarly rapid
increase in the number of plants being built and connected to the grid.
Respondent concluded that it would need an additional €700 million
per year of incentive tariffs to make photovoltaic technology
competitive, but that, thereafter, new producers would no longer
Tequire incentive tariffs.

145,

Conto V provided two different incentive regimes based on the
photovoltaic plants’ capacity: (i) it awarded plants up to 1 MW an
“all-inclusive tariff’ (that is, including both the price of the electricity
and the value of the incentive with a further specific tariff for any
self-consumed quantity of energy), and (ii) it awarded plants
exceeding 1 MW an amount equal to the difference (if positive)
between the all-inclusive tariff mentioned above and the market price
(“prezzo zonale orario”) of electricity plus the revenues deriving
from the sale of the energy to the market (“! energia prodotta resta
nella disponibilita del produttore”). Therefore, the value of the
incentive component varied depending on the market price (i.e. if the
price of electricity rosc, the incentive value decreased and vice versa).

Additionally, regardless of a plant’s capacity, Conto V provided a
bonus tariff on the electricity the operator produced and consumed,
which would constitute revenue in addition to the savings that the
producer had from generating its own electricity. Conto V also
simplificd access to the incentive tariffs for plants that Respondent
deemed to be under-developed (e.g., concentrated photovoltaic
systems and plants with innovative characteristics) or whose
development needed to be further incentivized given their cost (¢.g.,
very small rooftop plants). Plants falling outside these catcgorics
could access the Conto V incentives by applying to a registry that was
capped in phases corresponding to the total cost of the incentive
program. Specifically, the cap for the first registry was €140 million
euros, the cap for the second registry was €120 million, and so on,
until requests for Conte V tariffs reached €700 million.

Conto V ceased to apply on 6 July 2013. Thus, after 6 July 2013, no
incentive tariffs were available to any new photovoltaic plant installed
and connected to the Italian electricity grid.

concerning imposition of administrative fees.

147. The Tribunal now sects out a number of provisions in Conto V:

Article 5
(incentive Tariffs)

4. The tariff is awarded for a period of twenty years
commencing from the entry into operation of the plant and
shall remain constant in current currency for the entire
support period. This entitlement period is considered net of
any suspensions due to problems connected to grid safety
or following catastrophic events recognised as such by the
competent authorities.

Article 6
(Application for and disbursement of incentive tariffs)

1. Within fifleen calendar days as of the entry into
operatain date of the plant, uploaded by the grid manager
onto GAUDI, the plant operator (soggetto responsabile) is
under an obligation to send GSE a request for the relevant
incentive tariff, by submitting a declaration in lieu of
affidavit pursuant to article 47 of DPR 445, 2000, including
information under annex 3-B. Failure to comply with the
deadlines under this paragraph involves loss of the
incentive tariffs for the period between the operational date
and the date of communication to GSE, without prejudice to
entitlement to the applicable tariff at the operational date.

2, For the purposes of paragraph 1, the grid managers are
under an obligation to connect the plants to the electricity
grid within the terms established by the Authority for
electricity and gas resolution no, ARG/elt 99/08 as
subsequently amended and to register the date of the
connection with GAUDI within the deadlines established
therein.

3. Following verification of compliance with the provisions
of this decree, GSE will guarantee payment of the tariff
owed to the plant operator (soggetto responsabile) within
ninety days of receipt of the application under paragraph I,
excluding times imputable to the plant operator or to other
parties consulted by GSE in application of law no. 183, 12
November 2011, or operators involved in the process for
uploading and validating data in GAUDI. Prior to the date
on which GAUDI is fully operational and interoperational
with the portal for the management of incentives,
established by the Authority for electricity and gas, GSE

will adopt transitional solutions for the acquisition of data
already present in GAUDI directly from the parties
applying for incentives, providing prior information to the
Authority for electricity and gas and the Ministry for
economic development.

148. The Tribunal notes that the sample (submitted as an cxhibit by

Claimant) of a Conto V contract with the GSE has the following
provision, with emphasis added:

Article 17
Modifying agreements and referral

17.1 Any modifying or supplementary agreements on the
content of the present Agreement subsequent to the date on
which the agreement signed hy GSE is made available must
be agreed in writing, under the penalty of nullity.

17.2 For anything not expressly defined in the present
Agreement, the Parties expressly defer to the provisions in
the Ministerial Decree on 5 July 2012, to the decisions
referenced in the present Agreement and their subsequent
modifications and supplements, to the rules on the subject
of connections of plants to the grid and measurement of
electricity, to the other legislation of the sector und, where
applicable, to the provisions of the Civil Code.

17.3 GSE retains the right to unilaterally modify the
clauses of the present Agreement which, as a result af any
legislative and regulatory amendments, are in contrast
with the existing framework, These modifications shall be
communicated by GSE to the Soggetto Responsabile
through the electronic portal, notwithstanding the
possibility for the Soggetto Responsabile to withdraw from
the present contractual relationship in conformity with the
Provisions of Article 13 above.

17.4 The Parties are aware that any statement rendered in
the context of the present Agreement and/or in the context
of the uctivities/obligations connected to its application are
made pursuant to Presidential Decree of the Republic
445/00.

17.5 The introduction forms a substantial and essential part
of the agreement.

149. In contrast, the corresponding provision of a sample Conto JV contract

with the GSE states as follows:

Article 15
Modifying agreements and referral

Any modifying or supplementary agreements on the content
of the present Agreement subsequent to the date on which
the agreement signed by GSE is made avatlable must be
agreed in writing, under the penalty of nullity.

The Parties are aware that any declaration deriving from
the present Agreement and/or in the context of the
activities/obligations connected to its application is made
pursuant to Presidential Decree of the Republic 445/00.

The introduction forms an integral and essential part of the
Agreement.

150, Tt readily emerges from this comparison that with the Conto V
arrangements, Respondent changed the term of the GSE contracts to
allow for unilatcral changes brought about by legislation. Mutual
agreement to changes was no longer csscntial in order for certain
changes to become applicable.

Claimant's Investments

Megasol

151, In January 2010, Claimant acquired Sunholding S.r.1. (“Sunholding”).
Sunholding owned Megasol S.r.]., a company that held all project
rights to a photovoltaic plant of approximately 13 MW located in
Montalto di Castro in the Lazio region (“Mcgaso!”). The Megasol
photovoltaic plant was connected to the grid in May 2011 and
received an incentive tariff of 0.346€/kWh under Conto IJ, as
confirmed by a GSE Agreement dated 2 November 2011. Claimant’s
acquisition of Sunholding, therefore, pre-dated thc relevant GSE
Agrecment.

taken by Respondent

163. The Tribunal starts its analysis first with the Spalmaincentivi measure
taken by Respondent, which Claimant allegcs to have transgressed —
in breach of Article 10(1) ECT - its legitimate expectations as to the
stability of the Icgal and economic regime of the PV electricity
production in Italy into which it invested. The ‘Tribunal will then
describe the other measures. This order of analysis is justified by the
fact that the Spalmaincentivi was the preponderant cause of the

to Claimant’s from its i Te I

 

however, the Spalmaincentivi was not the first measure by which
Respondent sought to “scale back”, as Claimant describes

91/2014 of 24 June 2014, which was subsequently converted with
substantial relevant changes into Law 116/2014 of 11 August 2014,
As all such decrces addressing urgent issues, which under the Italian
Constitution, Governments may enact with force of a law, Law
Decree 91/2014 had to be converted by Parliament within 60 days
into a law, possibly with amendments, as happened for Law Decree
91/2014, in case it would lose any effect. The shortened name of the
Decree is “Decreto Competitivita” (“Competitiveness Decree"). It
included a range of measures to bolster Italy’s competitiveness,
including among others, as mentioned in its full title, measures for the
“limitation of the costs burden on clectricity tariffs”, which are found
in Article 26. This purpose was considered so important that, as the
Parties have recalled, Article 26 measures have been also labelled
with the term “taglia-bollette” (tariff bill-cut).

The original text of Article 26 provided only, among other measures
included in the Law Decree, to reduce the burden for clectricity
consumers due to advantages granted to various electricity users and
producers (among ihc latter, notably PV producers) that the benefits
of the incentive tariffs would be spread over 24 years instead of the 20
years provided in the various Conto Energia. According to Claimant
this entailed a reduction of 17%-25% depending on the residual
period of opcration of a given PV plant.

. As a result of the parliamentary debate, in which parliamentarians of

parties favourable to the industry were active in proposing
modifications that would diminish the negative impact of the original
Spalmaincentivi on PV producers, the conversion Law 116/2014
(effective 1" January 2015) offered producers the choice between
three options: (A) a 17-25% tariff cut (as originally provided in the
Law Decree), paid over 24 years instead of originally promised 20
years; (B) a tariff reduction from 2015-2019, with a promise of

increased tariffs in remaining years; and (C) (which applied in default
of a choice by a producer) straight 6-8% cut over 20 years, depending
on the installed capacity of the plant concerned. Further, another
aspect of Spalmaincentivi was that payment of 100% of the incentive
within 60 days was changed to 90% with the 10% balance paid the
subsequent year.

Administrative fees and imbalance costs

167. First, as regards administrative fees, article 10.4 of Conto V provided
that, as of | January 2013, all photovoltaic producers benefiting from
incentive tariffs under any Confo were required to pay an annual
administrative fee corresponding to € 0.0005 per kWh of incentivized
energy, to cover the GSF’s management, verification, and control

expenses.

168. Secondly, as regards imbalance costs, on 5 July 2012, the AEEG
passed Resolution 281/2012/R/EFR (“Resolution 281"), which
required renewable energy producers to pay imbalance costs as of 1
January 2013. The GSE, with approval of the AEEG, implemented
the method by which those costs would apply to renewable energy
producers at the end of 2012 with Resolution 493/2012/R/EFR
(“Resolution 493”),

169. Resolution 281] and Resolution 493 were challenged before the Italian
administrative courts, On 9 June 2014, the Consiglio di Stato found
in favour of the producers and held that the AEEG's resolutions were
unlawful. In particular, the Consiglio di Stato indicated that the
resolutions were discriminatory because they regulated programmable
and non-programmable sources of energy in the same manner, and
therefore failed to differentiate amongst different types of renewable
energy sources. As a result of that judgment, in many cases, the GSE
reimbursed the sums that renewable energy producers had already
paid under Resolution 281 and Resolution 493.

170. On 23 October 2014, the AEEG issued Resolution No.
522/2014/R/EEL (“Resolution 522”) that, once again, imposed
imbalance costs on renewable energy producers. Although certain
producers challenged Resolution before the Italian courts on grounds
that it should be null and void as in contrast with the principles of the
previous court ruling, renewable energy producers have becn paying
these imbalance costs since 1 January 2015.

Robin Hood tax

171. In 2008, Respondent enacted a windfall profits tax on the profits of
oil, gas, and other traditional energy companies, colloquially known
in an amalgam of English popular legend and modern economic
factors as the “Robin Hood” tax.

172. Under the heading of “Oil and gas scctors” in Law-Decree No.
112/2008 of June 25, 2008, Respondent provided that, as a result of
the country’s economic situation and the social impact of the increase
in energy prices, it would increase the corporate income tax rate of
companies with an annual gross income of over € 25 million by 5.5
percentage points, from 27.5% to 33%.

173. In July 2009, Respondent increased the corporate income tax rate of
companies subject to the Robin Hood tax to 34%, Respondent
explicitly excluded producers of renewable energy from the Robin
Hood tax because they had not bencfited from the then price spikes in
traditional energy sources.

174. In August 2011, Respondent broadened the scope of the Robin Hood
tax by extending it to all encrgy producers, including renewable
energy producers, with a gross annual income of over €10 million and
taxable income of over €1 million. In the law decree’s preamble it
was noted the urgency of adopting financial stabilization measures

was to guarantee the stability of Italy in the midst of an international
economic crisis and unstable markets. Respondent also increased the
corporate income tax rate of companies subject to the Robin Hood tax
from 34% 10 38%, which applied to fiscal years 2011 through 2013,

175. In June 2013, Respondent extended the scope of the Robin Hood tax
by reducing the applicable income thresholds to gross annual income
over €3 million and taxable income over € 300,000, This resulted in
the application of the Robin Hood tax to Claimant's photovoltaic
plants.

176. A constitutional challenge to the application of the Robin Hood tax to
the renewable energy sector was brought and on 11 February 2015,
the Italian Constitutional Court ruled the extension of the Robin Hood
tax to renewable energy producers to be unconstitutional. The Court
also ruled that its decision would not have retroactive effect.

a

On 28 April 2015, Respondent confirmed that renewable energy
producers were required to pay the Robin Hood tax for the 2014 fiscal
yeur.

IMU/TASI charges

178. In December 2013, Respondent classified photovoltaic plants as
immovable property, thereby subjecting them to increased IMU and
TASI charges. Respondent changed this in the 2016 Budget Law,
reducing IMU and TASI charges by about 90%. Respondent has not
refunded IMU and TASI charges paid in 2014 and 2015.

Section B - Merits ~ Liability (incl. concomittant Jurisdiction & Admissibility)

Introduction

179. Claimant says that the matters discussed in the foregoing section of
this award (Spalmaincentivi, Administrative fees and imbalance costs,
the Robin Hood tax, and the IMU/TASI charges) give rise to ECT
claims in respect of cach of its three investments, namely, Mcgasal,
Phenix, and Fnersol. Claimant summarised each head of claim, in its
Opening Presentation at the hearing, as follows:

- ttaly failed to fulfill the obligations it entered into with respect
to CEF's investments, which were crystallized in Tariff
Confirmation Letters and Contracts.

Italy violated CEF's legitimate expectations of receiving
precisely the tariffs granted to its PV plants through the Conto
Energia Decrees, Tariff Recognition Letters, and Contracts
when Italy amended those tariffs through the enactment of
various measures, including the Spalmaincentivi

Ff Italy's case is to be believed, then it failed to provide a
transparent legal framework, since under Italy's case, the
Conto Energia Decrees, Tariff Recognition Letters, and
Contracts did not mean what they plainly said.

Ttaly’s measures reducing the Conto Energia tariffs
unreasonably impaired CEF'’s investments.

180. In summary, these are: (a) Umbrella Clause claims; (b} FET claims;
(c) Failure to provide transparent legal framework claims; and (d)
Unreasonable impairment claims,

Respondent denies ail liability, and, additionally, raises the exception
found in Article 21 of the ECT in respect of a number of the measures
(this summary is taken from its Opening Presentation at the hearing):
(a) Robin Hood Tax; (b) Qualification of assets for fiscal and
cadastral purposes; (c) Imbalance charges; and (d) Administrative
fees.

182. The Tribunal, in its procedural appreciation of the materials before it,
arranges its analysis as follows: 1. FET claims; 2. Umbrella Clause
claims; 3. Failure to provide transparent legal framework claims; and

4. Unreasonable impairment claims.

FET claims

183. The Tribunal, first, records the basic contours of what constitutes fair
and cquitable treatment. Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows,
in part:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of
other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment.

184. The Parties are in agreement with one another that protection of
legitimate expectation comes within the ambit of Article 10(1) of the
ECT, though as to what precisely such protection exactly means (from
the plethora of prior awards cited to the Tribunal) is an area of
contention. The briefings which the Tribunal received from the Parties
on 20 July 2018 (commenting, inter alia, on Antaris) encapsulated
such contention; but most particularly these briefings showed that
each advocated a vicw that, regardless of how one articulates the
protection of Icgitimate expectation, the outcome was going to be
their favour.

185. In this respect the Tribunal finds it useful to recall and quote the
summary made by the tribunal in Antaris of the protection that the
FET standard grants to covered forcign investors by clauses such as
Art. 10(1) ECT. The Tribunal considers that the summary of the
Antaris award quoied hereunder is by and large a correct description
of the import of the FET standard as found in Article 10 (1) ECT in

RR RE ils

the light of the abundant case law that has developed on the issue. In
referring (o such summary the Tribunal is, in any case, mindful that
principles have to be adapted to the specificity of each case and that in
this field previous awards and decisions may properly be looked at as
uscful (re-)statements of the law but do not represent binding
precedents. The relevant recapitulation in Antaris is as follows
(footnotes omitted):

360. As is usual in these cases, the Parties have adduced many
published awards (in this case more than 50) on the interpretation
or application of the FET (“fair and equitable treatment”)
standard, and the FPS (“full protection and security") and non-
impairment standards. Most of them are well-known, and, although
Formulations of the principles differ in detail, it is only necessary to
summarize the present state of international law and practice in
these general propositions (several of which overlap with each
other):

(1) There will be a breach of the FET standard where legal and
business stability or the legal framework has been altered in sucha
way as to frustrate legitimate and reasonable expectations or
guarantees of stability.

(2) A claim based on legitimate expectation must proceed from an
identification of the origin of the expectation alleged, so that its
scope can be formulated with precision.

(3) A claimant must establish that (a) clear and explicit (or
implicit) representations were inade by or attributable to the state
in order 10 induce the investment, (b) such representations were
reasonably relied upon by the Claimants, and (c) these
representations were subsequently repudiated by the state,

(4) An expectation may arise from what are construed as specific
guarantees in legislation,

(5) A specific representation may make a difference to the
assessment of the investor's knowledge and of the reasonableness
and legiti of its exp ion, but is not indisp ble to
establish a claim based on legitimate expectation which is
advanced under the FET standard.

(©) Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of

persons or a category of persons, do not create legitimate
expectations that there will be no change in the law; and given the

State's regulatory powers, in order to rely on legitimate
expectations the investor should inguire in advance regarding the
prospects of a change in the regulatory framework in light of the
then prevailing or reasonably to be expected changes in the
economic and social conditions of the host State,

(7) An expectation muy be engendered by changes to general
legislation, but, at least in the absence of a stabilization clause,
they are not prevented by the fair and equitable treatment standard
if they do not exceed the exercise of the host State’s normal
regulatory power in the pursuance of a public interest and do not
modify the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor al the
time of its investment outside the acceptable margin of change.

(8) The requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability
as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State's
rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt
its legal system to changing circumstances.

(9) The host State is not required to elevate the interests af the
investor above all other considerations, and the application of the
FET standard allows for a balancing or weighing exercise by the
State and the determination of a breach of the FET standard must
be made in the light of the high measure of deference which
international law generally extends to the right of national
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.

(10) Except where specific promises or representations are made
by the State to the invesior, the latter may not rely on an investment
treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes
in the host State’s legal and economic framework. Such
expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable.

(11) Protection from arbitrary or unreasonable behaviour is
subsumed under the FET standard.

(12) It will also fall within the obligation not to impair investments
by “unreasonable ... measures” (Article ]0(1), ECT) or “arbitrary
».. measures (Article 2(2), Czech Republic/Germany BIT).

(13) The investor is entitled to expect that the State will not act ina

way which is manifestly inconsistent or unreasonable (i.e.
unrelated to some rational policy).

186. Respondent also, at para. 473 of SoD, makes the point that the

protection under the FET standard may only concern those

expectations of the investors that existed at the time when they made

the investment. It is with this important temporal point that the
Tribunal will begin its analysis of the FET claims.

187. As already noted above (paras. 152 and 153), both the tariff
recognition letter and the GSE Agreement in respect of Megasol post-
dated Claimant's investment. Also, as already noted above (paras, 157
and 158), both the tariff recognition letter and the GSE Agreement in
respect of Phenix post-dated Claimant’s investment. Further, neither
plant bad becn, at the time of the investments, connected to the grid.
Thus, at the time Claimant invested in both Megasol and Phenix, at
the very best it can be said that its intention was to complete plants
which would, at a point in the future, be connected to the grid, and be
compliant with the necessary requirements under the applicable
Conto. Thereafler, appropriate applications would necd to be made
(and the requirements of the applicable Conto to be satisfied), a reply
in the positive received, and then a GSE Agreement consummated,

188. Claimant, in reality, at the time of the making of both the Megasol
and Phenix investments still had a number of steps to take before it
knew for certain that the hoped-for incentives were actually awarded
to it, It enjoyed no guarantee of success at the time of investment, and
nothing in any of Respondent’s Contos could infer that a party in
Claimant’s position as of such dates was inevitably going to be
awarded the incentives. The fact that Claimant did indeed, at a later
time, succeed in all respects for both Megasol and Phenix does not
assist il as of the dates upon which it made those investments. What is
decisive is that as of those dates the protection of Claimant's
investment rights had not yet crystallised.

189. As a consequence, the Tribunal finds that Claimant cannot assert an

FET claim by way of protection of legitimate expectation for both
Megasol and Phenix insofar as it might allege that the changes to the

lat ded i ives engage i ional responsibility on the
part of Respondent.

190. Conversely, no such difficulty arises in respect of Enersol. As noted
above in footnote 2, it is common case that the date of Claimant's
investment was 30 March 2012, which clearly post-dates the
connections to the grid, the tariff recognition letters, and the GSE
Agreements. Thus, as of 30 March 2012, Claimant’s investment in
Enersol enjoyed crystallised rights to incentives as described above.

191,

Thus, the Tribunal will now analyse whether Respondent’s actions
transgressed the protection of legitimate expectation by the ECT
insofar as Enersol is concemed. This is a two-stage process as a
matter of international law: first, what is the origin and scope,
precisely, of the legitimate expectation; secondly, how exactly has
such legitimate expectation (if first established as a matter of
international law) have been transgressed, if at all, in a manner
prohibited by international law.

192. Before embarking into the analysis of whether or not there was a
breach of any legitimate expectation attached to Claimant’s
investment in Enersol, the Tribunal must address threshold points
raised by Respondent.

193. As noted in para. 181 above, Respondent raises Article 21 of the ECT
in four respects. Article 21 of the ECT provides as follows:

Respondent says that certain of the actions it took of which Claimant
makes complaint, arc captured by Article 21 of the ECT. In such
circumstances, if Respondent is correct, the Tribunal has no
jurisdiction to decide whether or not those actions engaged
international responsibility as a matter of the ECT. These arguments
are now examined in tum.

As regards administrative fecs, these arose as follows. Article 10.4 of
Conto V provided that, as of 1 January 2013, all photovoltaic
producers bencfiting from incentive tariffs under any Conto were
required to pay an annual administrative fee corresponding to €
0.0005 per kWh of incentivized energy, to cover the GSE's
management, verification, and control expenses. Are these
administrative fecs a Taxation Measure, or are they not?

As Respondent points out at para. 147 of the SoD, the definition in
Article 21(7) of the ECT is very wide, and includes any provision
relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party or of a
Political subdivision thereof or a local authority therein. Respondent

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

then develops its argument as to what is 1ax provision in the domestic
law of Italy at paras. 149-15] of the SoD:

149. In Italy, fiscal measures (tributi) can be broadly divided into
three categories: imposta (tax), tassa (fee) and coniributo
(contribution), although it is not the name of the measure to
actually make it a fiscal measure (as further explained). In general
terms, a (administrative, judicial or industrial) fee is paid as
consideration for a given service rendered by a public body. In this
case, the service provided is in principle requested by the citizen. A
tax corresponds to the wealth that is drawn from the citizens in
relation to the production of income for the provision of general
services provided by the State; therefore, this is not related to any
specific service but based on the contributive capacity (“capacita
contributiva”) of the person. Finally, a contribution (or “onere
sociale”: social burden) is the compulsory levy from certain
individuals, to the fact that they derive a benefit, directly or
indirectly, by certain public services, even without having
requested these.

150. In the absence of legislative measures to help defining when a
specific measure is to be considered a fiscal measure (tributo), we
need to be guided by case law, in particular by the Italian
Constitutional Court. The Constitutional Court has stated
repeatedly that, irrespective of the name given to the measure, the
Features that qualify a disbursement as of fiscal nature are: 1)
dutifulness of the withdrawal, 2) absence of exact reciprocity
between the parties, and 3) connection of the withdrawal to the
public spending by linking this to an economically significant
prerequisite.

151. In addition, the Italian Constitution imposes that tribuies be
established by law. All taxes, fees and contributions under Italian
law thus satisfy the above conditions under Article 21(7) and
consequently are “Taxation Measures" under the ECT.

197. Claimant’s Reply (para. 109) counters by referencing the official
Italian language version of the ECT which only includes “imposte” in
Article 21(7), rather than the wider definition advocated by
Respondent encompassing “tassa” and “contribute”. Claimant also
invokes a number of awards stated to be in its favour (Murphy
Exploration & Production Company ~ International v the Republic of
Ecuador, Partial Final Award, 6 May 2016; Occidental Petroleum
Corporation, Occidental Exploration and Production Company v The

Republic of Ecuador, \CSID Case No. ARB/06/11, Award, 5 October
2012; and Yukos Universal Ltd. v Russian Federation, Award, 18 July
2014).

. The Tribunal finds Claimant’s argument as to the Italian language

version of the ECT to be unavailing, If it were upheld, then the
different official language versions of Article 21(7) (as demonstrated
in para. 120 of the Rejoinder) would give risc to radically differing
results, The definition contained in Article 21{7), whether in Italian,
or any other official language, is widely drawn. The Tribunal does
not, therefore, have any reason to consider that definition, insofur as it
applies to Italy, as being anything other than that articulated by the
Italian Constitutional Court: J) dutifulness of the withdrawal, 2)
absence of exact reciprocity between the parties, and 3) connection of
the withdrawal to the public spending by linking this to an
economically significant prerequisite.

‘Thus, the Tribunal considers the administrative fees 10 be a Taxation
measure. They clearly fal] within the definition articulated by the
Italian Constitutional Court. The Tribunal accepts the submission of
Respondent at para. 149 of the SoD that the widely-drawn meaning of
a taxation measure in Italy (tributi) cncompasses fees such as the
administrative fees imposed on all photovoltaic operators by means of
Conto V. These were consideration for a given service rendered by a
public body and while such administrative feces might only be directed
towards photovoltaic operators and not the public at large, this does
not detract from their essential nature; they are imposed by
Respondent (or an emanation thereof) in order to fund a service
rendered in support of such photovoltaic operators, The Tribunal finds
further support for its conclusion from the example given by
Respondent concerning municipal garbage taxes. Although they are in
principle fecs for service rendered, Italian jurisprudence considers
them to be taxes because they are charged on all home owners or

tenants to whom the service is provided irrespective of a precise
comespondence between such service and its utilization by an
individual owner or tenant.

200. In such circumstances, Claimant's claims conecming administrative
fees arc captured by Article 21 of the ECT.

201.

Secondly, as regards imbalance costs, Respondent says, at para.
132(b) of the Rejoinder:

Imbalance charges in turn relate to the dispatching of energy and
are an instrument to cope with shocks of the dispatching system.
Transmission and dispatching of energy is reserved to the State
and granted in concession to Terna. Relevant legislation defines
“dispatching” as the activity aimed at providing instructions for
the use and the coordinated operation of production plants, the
transmission grid and auxiliary services. Terna has a monopoly
over such activities, In the case of transmission and dispatching
activities, Terna has the duty to grant non-discriminatory access to
all operators and be neutral and unbiased in offering the service.
However, this does not interfere with the possibility that a specific
charge be paid by way of fee, The fiscal nature of such measures is
recognize by the Claimant in the first place: “{pJolicymakers have
the choice either of charging imbalance costs to renewable
producers or passing them on to consumers" (§173 of Statement of
Claim). It states further “Italy had socialized the imbalance costs,
meaning that the entire energy forecast was conducted at the
national system level and the costs were passed on to
endconsumers via the electricity bill.” (§ 175 of Statement of
Claim). Passing these costs on to consumers means to impose a
general fee to final users for the implementation of the mechanism
of energy reserves by Terna, indeed to “socialize” the costs of the
public service. Charging them to the generality of energy
producers means to equally impose a fee, to “socialize” the costs
by putting a burden on producers instead of final user. What
changes is the general category of persons charged with the fee,
not ils nature.

202. The Tribunal considers the imbalance costs to be a Taxation measure.
They clearly fall within the definition articulated by the Italian
Constitutional Court and the analysis conducted above in connection
with administrative fees applies mutatis mutandis. Whether or not the
current imbalance fees are illegal as a matter of Italian law is a

municipal matter.

In such circumstances, Claimant's claims concerning imbalance costs
are captured by Article 21 of the ECT.

The Robin Hood tax clearly falls within the definition articulated by
the Italian Constitutional Court, and is, therefore, a Taxation measure.
While it might well be the subject of bewilderment to Claimant that
taxes which have been held by the municipal courts to be
unconstitutional have not been reimbursed, that is still in the domain

of a Taxation measure.

In such circumstances, Claimant’s claims concerning the Robin Hood
tax arc captured by Article 21 of the ECT.

Finally, in this regard, the Tribunal also readily appreciates the IMU
and TASI charges to be Taxation measures. Classifying photovoltaic
plants as immovable property, thereby subjecting them to increased
IMU and TASI charges, falls directly within the definition articulated
by the Italian Constitutional Court, As with the Robin Hood tax, the
non-refund of such charges paid in 2014 and 2015 may well be
considered by Claimant to be irreconcilable with the 2016 Budget
Law, but that is a matter of municipal law inextricably bound up with
domestic fiscal measures.

In such circumstances, Claimant’s claims concerning the IMU and
TAS] charges are captured by Article 21 of the ECT.

In conclusion, and taking into account all of the foregoing, Claimant’s
FET claim reposes on what was its legitimate expectation as on 30
March 2012 in respect of the Enersol investment, and, whether,
Spalmaincentivi transgressed the protection of such, if any, legitimate
expectation. The Tribunal will now proceed to assess that FET claim
according to the following approach: first, what is the origin and

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 92

ge 117,9644%. 654707/2019

scope, precisely, of the legitimate expectation; secondly, how exactly
has such Icgitimate expectation (if first cstablished as a matter of
international law) been transgressed in a manner prohibited by

international law.

The origin and scope of Claimant's legitimate expectation as regards Enersol

209. As on 30 March 2012, when Claimant bought Enersol, what can be
objectively identified as unquestionably in place and explicitly known
to it?

210. First, seven scctions of the photovoltaic plant had already been
connected to the national electricity grid.

211. Secondly, seven tariff recognition letters had been issued by an
emanation of Respondent. These letters stated (as already recorded
above):

The incentive tariff will be recognized for a period of twenty years
as of the date of entry into operation of the plant: 28/04/2011; the
tariff is constant, in current currency, all through the 20-year
period, [Section 1]

The tariff will be recognized for a twenty-year period as of the date
of entry into operation of the plant: 31/07/2011; the tari
constant in current currency for all the twenty year period.
[Scctions 2 & 3]

The tariff will be recognized for a twenty-year period as of the date
of entry into operation of the plant: 31/08/2011; the tariff is
constant in current currency for all the twenty year period.
[Sections 4, 5, 6, & 7]

212. These letters did not simply state that the tariffs were recognised, but
expressly say that in order to obtain such tariffs, the relevant GSE
agreements needed to be printed and signed. This was an express and
unmistakeable invitation on the part of an emanation of Respondent to

sign the relevant GSE agrecments as an essential prerequisite to the
obtaining of the incentives.

Thirdly, seven GSE Agreements had been concluded between
investments of Claimant and an emanation of Respondent. By way of
example, as already recorded above, these GSE Agreements had the
following language (example is taken from Sections 2 and 3):

The incentive tariff, constant in regular instalments in current
currency, to be recognised to the photovoltaic plant under this
Agreement, is equal to 0.2510 Euro/kWh, a value recognised by
GSE and notified to the Soggetto Responsubile with the
communication on admission to the incentive tariff,

The present Agreement is effective from 31/07/2011 and expires on
30/07/2031.

Any modifying or supplementary agreements on the content of the
present Agreement subsequent to the date on which the agreement
signed by GSE is made available must be agreed in writing, under
the penalty of nullity.
The language found in the sample GSE contract pursuant to Conto V,
which expressly puts on notice any photovoltaic producer of the
potential for unilateral changes brought about by legislation, is not
present in any of the seven GSE Agreements applicable to Enersol.
All of the GSE Agreements to which Enersol was a party had the
express language that the only way change could be brought about to
contractual terms was by way of mutual agrecment in writing.

Fourthly, four Contos and the Romani Decree had been passed into
law by Respondent. These, in varying respects, were the domestic
legal background to the incentive schemes.

For the moment, the Tribunal does not take account of the plethora of
advertising material (whether apparently issued by cmanations of
Respondent, or through promotional material issued by, amongst

others, law firms) which Claimant relies upon in its submissions as
indicating reliance on the putative constancy of the incentive schemes.
Much of this material might well be described as puffery, and the
Tribunal prefers, at this stage, to analyse the four matters discussed
just above for the purposes of Claimant's legitimate expectation as on
30 March 2012.

21

_

Looking at the four matters described above (in no particular order:
{a) the four Contos and Romani Decree; (b) the tariff recognition
letters; (c) the connections to the national grid; and (d) the GSE
Agreements), a party in the shoes of Claimant would be left in no
doubt but that it was to receive incentives, in constant currency, for a
twenty year period, and all pursuant to private law contracts (as this
was understood to be the state of Italian law at the time of the making
by Claimant of its Enersol investments — indeed the Romani Decree
could not have been clearer in that respect to any reasonable reader)
which could not be amended save by mutual agreement. This was
clearly based on the consistent legal policy of Respondent as
manifested in the four Contos and the Romani Decree. No reading, no
matter how indulgent, could lead anyone to consider anything other
than a clear promise of twenty years of constant currency incentives
pursuant to a private law contract. This is not a black letter reading, or
the Tribunal holding Respondent hostage to blinkcred pedantry
(which would be unbecoming the dignity of a sovereign state), rather,
it is the product of a careful, good faith reading of all of Respondcnt’s
unambiguous acts as set out above.

218. The critical question readily emerges from all of the foregoing is
whether Claimant enjoyed a legitimate expectation protected by
Article 10(1) of the ECT in respect of its Enersol investment as of 30
March 2012?

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 95

 

NYSCEF DOC. NO.

219,

220.

22t.

Drawing upon the principles articulated by the tribunal in Antaris, the
‘Tribunal now ascertains whether a key predicate for a claim based on
legitimate expectation is present in this case, As that tribunal
described, [A] claim based on legitimate expectation must proceed
from an identification of the origin of the expectation alleged, so that
its scope can be formulated with precision, it is readily apparent to the
Tribunal that both the origin and scope of the expectation of Claimant
in respect of Enersol as on 30 March 2012 is precisely identifiable:
Enersol was to receive incentives, in constant currency for a twenty-
year period,

It is also important to differentiate the situation of Claimant as on 30
March 2012 in respect of Exersol with that of the claimant in Blusun.
That claimant was, unlike Claimant and its investment in Enersol, still
at a preliminary stage of its altempts to invest in the Malian
photovoltaic market. That led to it falling at the first legal hurdle for
causation as a matter of Article 10(1) of the ECT before that tribunal
which found (para. 386) that:

{T]o conclude, in the Tribunal's view, the Project ran a significant
risk of incurring legal or administrative difficulties, even if these
could be (and in the event largely were) overcome. Its success was
by no means certain.

This finding of the Blusun tribunal echoes part of the summary,
already quoted above, of the tribunal in Antaris, but now quoted again
in specific illustration of these points:

(6) Provisions of general legislation applicable to a plurality of
persons or a category of persons, do not create legitimate
expectations that there will be no change in the law; and given the
State’s regulatory powers, in order to rely on legitimate
expectations the investor should inquire in advance regarding the
prospects of a change in the regulatory framework in light of the
then prevailing or reasonably to be expected changes in the
economic and social conditions of the host State.

RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

(7) An expectation may be engendered by changes to general
legislation, but, at least in the absence of a stabilization clause,
they are not prevented by the fair and equitable treatment standard
if they do not exceed the exercise of the host State's normal
regulatory power in the pursuance of a public interest and do not
modify the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor at the
time of its investment outside the acceptable margin of change.

(8) The requirements of legitimate expectations and legal stability
as manifestations of the FET standard do not affect the State's
rights to exercise its sovereign authority to legislate and to adapt
its legal system to changing circumstances,

(9) The host State is not required to elevate the interests of the
investor above all other considerations, and the application of the
FET standard allows for a balancing or weighing exercise by the
State and the determination of a breach of the FET standard must
be made in the light of the high measure of deference which
international law generally extends to the right of national
authorities to regulate matters within their own borders.

(10) Except where specific promises or representations are made
by the State to the investor, the latter may not rely on an investment
treaty as a kind of insurance policy against the risk of any changes
in the host State’s legal and economic framework Such
expectation would be neither legitimate nor reasonable.
The foregoing five points made by the tribunal in Antaris do not
present Respondent with an answer to the position of Claimant in
respect of Enersol as of 30 March 2012. Claimant’s expectation as of
that date was not simply (as was, csscntially, the case with the Blusun
claimant) relying on a general, erga omnes, promise found in law to
putative photovoltaic producers. Quite the contrary, by 30 March
2012, Claimant's expectation was both specific as to what it was to
receive by way of incentives and their exact duration, and precise in
its origin (namely, from explicit acts of Respondent).

The next question is, according to the tribunal in Antaris, is whether
such representations were reasonably relied upon by the Claimants.
‘This is a matter which, at the very end of the hearing, included a new
point being raised by Respondent in connection with a due diligence
report prepared for Claimant’s financiers by Clifford Chance.

Claimant, prior to consummating its investment in Enersol on 30
March 2012 undertook due ditigence via the law firm of Ashurst. A
Legal Duc Diligence Report authored by that firm of 18 March 2012
is relied upon in Claimant’s SoC, That Legal Due Diligence Report
explicitly references the GSE Agreements (section 5 thereof). Further,
the Tribunal has been shown by Claimant a sct of slides prepared by
Glennmont Partners (which is understood to be the controller of
Claimant) entitled Serenissima which describes (p. 5) explicitly the
volume and price arrangements for the Enersol investment.

. The Tribunal readily, therefore, sees that Claimant relied on the

circumstances of Enersol (described above) when deciding whether or
not to invest, All of the matters set out in both the Legal Due
Diligence Report and the Serenissima presentation carefully record
the circumstances of Enersol and, therefore, reliance can well be
understood to have been reasonable.

However, at the end of the hearing there was a ripple in the lagoon by
reason of reliance, first raised in oral closing argument by
Respondent, on a passage in an exhibit of Claimant, the due diligence
report issued by Clifford Chance.

. Respondent’s point, which arose in oral closing argument at the

hearing (and cannot be found anywhere in Respondent’s memorials),
was as follows. In a due diligence report prepared for Claimant’s
financiers by Clifford Chance, the following is stated:

amendments become effective may have to comply with the then-
applicable requirements and be eligible only for the then-available
incentives.

You should be aware that Italian law does not prohibit the
enactment of laws with retro-active effect; although no laws with
retroactive effect have been issued in the field of energy law in
Italy in the past.

Once the grant of the incentives is secured by the execution of the
agreement with the GSE, the risk of a retroactive change in
incentives can be reasonably deemed low.

228. The Clifford Chance due diligence report was included as an exhibit
to Claimant's SoC, and, thercforc, was entirely known to Respondent
from that moment onwards, Nonetheless, it was only at the oral
closing stage at the hearing that considerable emphasis was laid upon
this section by Respondent as support for the proposition that
Claimant was on notice that there was a risk of retrospective changes
to granted incentives. As described in the procedural history section
of this Award, the Tribunal thereafter received post-hearing
submissions in that regard, These will now be analysed.

229. With specific reference to Claimant’s FET claim, it argues in its post-
hearing brief as follows:

6. sus First. considered objectively, the language Italy cites
would not warn an investor that Italy could legally retroactively
revoke the rights it had guaranteed under its regulatory
Sramework, in the GSE Tariff Confirmation Letters, and In the
GSE's Contracts with the individual plant owners without
Providing compensation. In fact, Clifford Chance expressly
recognized that a completed facility shat had enrolled in the regime
had rights that undeveloped projects did not have: “any
photovoltaic plant that is not yet admitted to the Conto Energia at
the time of such legislative amendments become effective may have
to comply with the then-applicable requirements and be eligible
only for the then-available incentives.” That sentence clearly
refers to prospective, not retroactive changes to the regulatory
regime.

7. On the other hand, the final two sentences do reference
retroactive changes, but do not lead to Italy's proposed
conclusion. While Clifford Chance does state that Italian law
technically does not prohibit retroactive changes, it also states that
“no laws with retroactive effect have been issued in the field of
energy law in Italy in the past, Further, Clifford Chance never
suggested that retroactive changes stripping investors of their
rights without compensation are permitted. Indeed, Clifford
Chance acknowledged that “[ojnce the grant of the incentives is
secured by the execution of the agreement with the GSE, the risk of
@ retroactive change in incentives can be reasonably deemed law.”
Thus, after reviewing the Clifford Chance report, CEF still had a
reasonable expectation that Italy would not modify its legal regime
retroactively without compensating investors, and invested in
Project Enersol on the basis of that expectation. That is
particularly the case in light of all the additional evidence
regarding CEF'’s legitimate expectations in relation to its
investments generally and Project Enersol in particular, such as
the GSE Contracts setting forth the specific tariffs that project
would receive,

230. The Tribunal does not appreciate from any of the briefings which

As

N

followed thereafter that R dent gainsayed the foregoing position
of Claimant. That does not mean, inevitably, that the Tribunal accepts

 

what Claimant submits. It will make its own independent assessment
of the consequences, if any, of what Clifford Chance says,

First, it is clear that Clifford Chance indicates that the risk of
retrospective legislation in the energy sector is very low indeed; so
low that it opines that it has never occurred in the past. Thus, as of 30
March 2012, Claimant is explicitly aware of the fact that no
retrospective change in the law in the energy sector had ever occurred,
up to that time, in Italy.

Secondly, Clifford Chance makes a clcar distinction between
investors which have not yet secured a precise incentive, and those
that have consummated a GSE agreement, with the former plainly at
greater risk of not getting what they might have expected at the time
they commenced their works in the event of a change of the Jaw,
Those that have consummated a GSE agreement are, in Clifford

Chance’s words, facing, reasonably, a low risk of retrospective
change. That firm does not go any further in developing this point,
possibly due to the fact that such an event (at that timc) had never
occurred in Italy in the cnergy sector.

233. The Tribunal, in its assessment of the international law standard of
legitimate expectation, finds it difficult to see how a two-sentence
articulation of a low-risk hypothetical (which had never occurred in
the energy sector up to that moment) could comprehensively
eviscerate the collective and explicitly-stated consequences of all of
the four matters described at paras. 210-215 above for the purposes of
what was Claimant's legitimate expectation on 30 March 2012. While
later events (as discussed below concerning the judgment of the
Constitutional Court) bore out Clifford Chance’s opinion, the precise
content of the legitimate expectation is measured against the
conditions pertaining at the date of investment. The strictness of this
temporal rule inures to Respondent's favour in respect of Megasol and
Phenix.

234. In summary, the Tribunal is now in a position to answer the key
question posed above at para, 218 above with “yes”: did Claimant
enjoy a legitimate expectation within the meaning of Article 10(1) of
the ECT in respect of its Enersol investment as of 30 March 2012?
The answer is yes, and the precise scope of that legitimate expectation
is that Enersol was to receive incentives, in constant currency for a
twenty-year period. However, that legitimate expectation does not, in
the Tribunal’s estimation, extend to one further aspect of Claimant’s
claim, namely, the change, brought about by Spalmainincentivi
whereby payment of 100% of the incentive within 60 days was
changed to 90% with the 10% balance paid the subsequent year. The
Tribunal considers that Claimant has not asserted (save for a passing
criticism in para. 208 of the SoC, which the Tribunal finds to be

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 101

 

NYSCEF DOC, NO. 4

insufficient) or proven that organs of Respondent offered explicit or
implicit promises or guarantees that change of the type encompassed
by the payment term change would not be made. Thus, even though
Claimant considered this measure unfavorable to their investments, it
has not argued or alleged any ground for an FET claim.

Has Claimant's legitimate expectation been transgressed in a manner prohibited
by the ECT?

235.

236,

This question, which is at the heart of the issue of liability, can be
formulated as follows: whether, in Junc / August 2014, when
Respondent enacted the Law Decree No. 91/2014 converted into Law
116/2014, colloquially known “Spalmaincentivi”, by which Conto
Energia tariffs previously granted to existing PV plants were reduced
in order to lessen the burden of clectricity bills to consumers, did it
breach the protection of Claimant’s legitimate expectation as a matter
of Article £0(1) of the ECT? By reference to the third of the three-step
test postulated at para. 360(3) of the award in Antaris, the present
question is refined further, namely, did the Spalmaincentivi breach the
representations of Respondent which led to the legitimate
expectations of Claimant in respect of Enersol?

The existence of a breach is not the automatic consequence of a
finding that subsequent measures taken by the host state are in
contrast with the legal regime and “assurances” of stability on which
the foreign investor relied when it made its investment. To follow
again Antaris, the reasons and justification of the state’s action must
also be cvaluatcd, “in the light of the then prevailing or reasonably to
be expected changes in the economic and social conditions of the hast
State” (Antaris, para. 360(6)). This entails cvaluating whether the
subsequent action by the State “af /east in the absence of a
stabilization clause,...do not exceed the exercise of host State's
normal regulatory power in pursuance of a public interest and do not

modify the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor at the
time of its investment outside the acceptable margin of change.”
(Antaris para. 360(7)) This means that the quantitative negative
impact on the investment’s valuc and profitability must be taken into
account. Finally, (Antaris para. 360(9) “The host State is not required
to elevate the interests of the investor above all other considerations,
and the application of the FET standard allows for a balancing or
weighing exercise by the State and the determination of a breach of
the FET standard must be made in the light of the high measure of
deference which international law generally extends to the right of
national authorities to regulate matters within their own horders"
{Antaris para. 360 (9).

237. As concerns the first clement of the comparative analysis, consisting
in “balancing and weighing” the expectations of the Claimant as a
foreign investor protected by Article 10(1) ECT, with the right of
Respondent as host State to adapt its regulatory framework to
changing circumstances, the Tribunal has already duly highlighted the
key and spccific clements of Claimant’s rights and expectation and
their sources. As stated above at para. 222, “Claimant's expectation
was both specific as to what it was to reccive by way of incentives
and thcir exact duration, and precise in its origin (namely, from
explicit acts of Respondent)”. Specifically, as said above in para. 217
Claimant’s expectation was based on “a clear promise of twenty years
of constant currency incentives pursuant to a private law contract”.

238. On the other hand, looking at the actions by Haly which negatively
affected the legitimate expectation of Claimant and their reasons, the
Tribunal recalls that as an effect of the modifications of the original
Law Decree 91/2014 when it was converted into Law 116/2014 the
options of a cut in tariffs were offered to the PV operators. They all
resulted in a photovoltaic producer nol receiving the originally-

240.

241.

promised incentivised tariff for twenty ycars. Even the least damaging
option (Option C), added in the conversion Law 116/2014 (the default
option chosen by Claimant in respect of Enersol,) providing for a
tariff cut of 6-8% for the residual years up to the end of the 20-year
contractual period, resulted in the amount of the tariff obtaincd by
Enersol being Jess than the one originally granted on which Claimant
had relied in making its investment.

As to the reasons for the issuance of the Spalmuincentivi the ‘Tribunal
has taken note that the Decree Law and accompanying official
documents, spell out the reasons for reducing the incentives provided
to the PV operators through the various Conto Energia. The rationale
was that of reducing the burden of electricity bill to the consumers,
especially small and medium enterprises, in ordcr to stimulate
economic growth and competitiveness. The Tribunal has also taken
note that the tariff cut was not the only measure taken to this end as
concerns electricity tariffs in the Decree Law 91/2014.

The Tribunal is at pains to also observe that Respondent’s three
Spalmaincentivi options are not, in of themselves, an unreasonable
measure. The sustainability of the incentive system for PV producers
and other valuable objective of general interests were at stake, and it
can readily be appreciated that the dignity which attaches to
sovereigns must be given deference, though that is not infinite when
bal against a ination of i i igati freely
assumed and, further, fact-specific circumstances of the extent of
commitments given to investors.

The Tribunal does not consider that the reasons adduced by the
Respondent to justify the cut of the tariff granted for a 20-year period
to the Claimant’s investment in Enersol and the fact that the cut was

not of such a magnitude as to render the investment unprofitable, but
allowed it (arguendo) to still generate a fair return can prevail over
the legitimate expectations of Claimant that it is entitled to benefit of
the originally granted and agreed incentivized tariff

242. The Tribunal finds support for this conclusion in the words of EI Paso
Energy International Company v. Argentine Republic, that the FET is
linked to the objective reasonable legitimate expectations of the
investors and that these have to be evaluated considering all
circumstances. As discussed ulready in this award, there are specific
circumstances attaching themselves to Claimant’s investment in
Enersol: (a) the relevant Contos and Romani Decree; (b) the tariff
recognition letters; (c) the connections to the national grid; and (d) the
GSE Agreements. None of these could give any reasonable observer
the slightest doubt but that Respondent had committed itself vis a vis
Enersol to constant currency tariffs over a twenty year period. The
contrast in the apparent (at the time of the Enersol investment)

bility and it of R dent to the of the
tariffs with its later position can particularly be noted from the fact
that a GSE contract under the Conto V regime clearly puts the
photovoltaic producer on notice of the risk of unilateral changes to
such terms.

243. It is readily apparent to the Tribunal that the greater the level of
engagement as between a sovereign and an investor, such as here
through Respondent's undertaking to maintain a specific incentivized
tariff for 20 years, ultimately resulting in legitimate expectations
which are clear in both scope and origin, the more rigorous the
serutiny must be of acts which, even if reasonable, cut across those
legitimate expectations. It is an inherent aspect and quality attaching

244.

245,

246.

to the dignity of a sovereign that promises made and obligations
accrued by it are respectfully and carefully uphcld and vindicated.

Having taken all of the foregoing into account, the Tribunal concludes
that the three Spalmaincentivi options are, therefore, a breach by
Respondent of Article 10(1} ECT in respect of Claimant's legitimate
expectation concerning its investment in Enersol. Claimant was, as a
matter of the Spalmaincentivi options, faced with three choices none
of which would lead to the vindication or upholding of the legitimate
expectation it had in respect of Enersol as on 30 March 2012.

Prior to making its final conclusion in respect of Claimant's FET
claim as regards Enersol, the Tribunal also notes that Respondent
argued at some length that its measures did not result in Claimant's
investments becoming unprofitable. That may very well be the case,
but this, in the Tribunal's view, does not provide an answer to
Claimant’s FET case in respect of Enersol. This is best encapsulated
by a provision in the Romani Decree, namely, that the incentive has
the purpose of ensuring a fair remuneration of the investment and
operating costs, This is an entirely appropriate policy aim so that the
incentives which Respondent grants to PV producers does not turn
into a one-sided financial bonanza at the expense of the public purse.
However, the decision as to what is a fair remuneration, while in the
hands of Respondent, is made at the time the level of a particular

is set for a particular prod There is no indi of any
kind whatsoever in the first four Contos, the Romani Decree, the tariff
recognition letters, and the GSE Agreements that, once an incentive
rate is offered, and then accepted into a consummated contract, it
would be subject to the vagaries of whatcver might later be deemed to
be a fair ion for the ining lifetime of the

Spalmaincentivi, Respondent breached the ECT protection of
Claimant’s legitimate expectation in respect of the latter’s investment
in Enersol. The consequences of this breach will be discussed later in
this Award.

247. The above conclusions that the Respondent has breached the FET
standard of Article 10(1) ECT by having breached the protection of
the legitimate expectations of Claimant that the incentivized tariff
would not be cut by a provision such as Spalmaincentivi reflects the
views of a majority of the Tribunal (comprising Mr. Reichert and
Prof. Dr. Sachs}. Prof. Sacerdoti disagrees on those conclusions for
the following reasons: “I believe that the weighing and balancing
exercise between the expectations of Claimant in the stability of the
20-year tariff, on the one hand, and the right of Italy to change it in
special circumstances in the public intcrest, as was done through the
Spalmaincentivi, should lead to the conclusion that Respondent has
not thereby breached Article 10(1) ECT. As to the expectations of the
Claimant in the stability of the tariff granted to Enersol, 1 recognize
they were properly based on a series of general and specific
provisions (including the GSE Agreements) that madc it reasonable to
believe that the 20-year tariff incentive would not be subject to
change. On the other hand, Claimant should have been aware that
under Itatian law (on which the due diligence reports it had obtained
exclusively focused) the possibility that the State could unilaterally
modify the tariff in special circumstances, for pressing reasons of
public interest, provided that the negative impact would be modest,
could not be ruled out. ‘This is exactly what the Constitutional Court
held in its judgment 16/2017 in relation to the Spalmaincentivi: “The
analysis of the rationale and of the content of the challenged
provision [Article 26 of Law 116/2014] leads to exclude that the latter
impacted on the long-term relationship — resulting from the
agreements concluded with [GSE] - in an unreasonable, arbitrary
and unpredictable way, so as to harm...the invoked principle

[legitimate expectations]. Indeed the regulatory change at hand is
justified hy a public interest, in terms of a fair balancing of the
opposed interests at stake, which is meant to combine the policy of
support to the production of energy from renewable sources with a
better sustainability of the respective costs borne by the end
consumers of electricity energy” ( ai para. 8.2). As to the tariff cut put
in place by the Spalmaincentivi, the evidence shows in my opinion
that it was a reasonable measure, taken in a transparent way, aimed at
pursuing a legitimate public interest - both looking at its aims and at
the economic context - and that, finally, due care was taken to protect
the interests of the investors (which by the way were predominantly
Italians). This is because (a) the burden of the consumers’ clectricity
bills reducing measures (“Taglia-bollette”) was spread among various
categories, among which that of the beneficiaries of the PV
incentivized tariffs was but one, and (b) the negative impact was
limited (6-8% cut) also due to the modification in the final Law
116/2014 of the initially harsher reduction. The cut has not affected
the profitability of the investment (for which there is a market, cf
para. 42 above), as certified by the fact that the damages that the
Tribunal finds and awards to Claimant in respect of Enersol are just
6% of the enterprise value (EUR 164,700,000.00) determined by
Claimant’s quantum expert.”
Umbrella Clause claims
248. Article 10(1) of the ECT provides as follows, in relevant part:

Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has
entered into with an Investor or an Investment of an Investor of any
other Contracting Party.

249, Claimant advances, cither additionally or alternatively to its FET
claims, umbrella clause claims against Respondent which repose on
the GSE Agrecments in respect of all of its investments, Megasol,
Phenix, and Enersol. It argues that cach of the GSE Agreements

(while subject to Malian law and jurisdiction) do not admit of (as of
now) any other reading or interpretation save an obligation on the part
of Respondent to pay incentives, in constant currency, for twenty
years, with no possibility of amendment save by mutual consent.

250. At the centre of Respondent’s defence to these umbrella clause claims
is Decision No. 16/2017 of the Italian Constitutional Court and its
position that the GSE Agrecments were, in fact, found by such
Decision to be “accessory”.

251. Respondent’s SoD, footnote 109, submits as follows (emphasis

added):

Contracts concluded by public administrations can be divided into
three broad categories. The first consists of the so-calied
“ordinary contracts", and are contracts that do nat undergo
modifications for the fact that one of the parties is a public
authority. The parties act on a strictly equal footing. The second
category consists of the so-called “special contracts”, because
contracts (private) law generally governs them, but, alongside the
provisions of the civil code, other specific rules apply, which
normally ascribe special powers to the government. Besides these
specific provisions, however, also these contracts follow the
general principles of private law. The third category comprises
contracts with a “public subject matter”, or “contracts of public
law”. Unlike the previous ones, these are connected to public
measures, af which they are a necessary complement. Their scope
is circumscribed by the public act and only exist in connection with
such public act and the exercise of the public power. In turn,
“contracts of public law” are usually divided into three further
categories: “ “accessory contracts” to public measures, “auxiliary
” to public 5, and b i “citi
. “Accessory

bearing distinctive features. Asa ‘oneal tien ‘it can be
stated that “accessory” are those contracts governing reciprocal

duties of parties that arise from a public measures. To a phase of
authoritative exercise of public powers, it follows one built under
the scheme of a contractual relationship: whereas the authoritative
exercise of power establishes the legal situation, the contractual
instrument regulates its operation. Even assuming that, because of
these two sides, such a contract is “mixed” in nature, this would in
fact mean that the management of the executive aspects of the
relationship are regulated by private law, whereas the contract

keeps a public nature. In particular, this would not change the fact
that_the_particular nature of the subject matter of the contract
(public_interest), and its object (the management of this interest),
leave intact a position of supremacy by the public power that

‘ould make it possible for the latter to unilaterally modify its
ions by modifying the authoritative act.

  

252. The case before the Italian Constitutional Court concemed
Spalmaincentivi, Various photovoltaic producers sought to have the
changes to the tariff regime struck down. In particular, those parties
alleged that their incentives were recognized by private law
agreements.

253. The Italian Constitutional Court, when considering the relevant GSE
contracts described them as follows:

This is even truer if one considers that the agreements
reached with GSE cannot be qualified as contracts meant to
determine the exclusive profit of the operator, with terms
and conditions blocked at the initial conditions, for twenty
years, even if technological changes may change
profoundly. They are instead regulatory instruments, aimed
at reaching the objecting of incentivizing certain sources of
energy in equilibrium with other sources of renewable
energy, and with the minimum sacrifice for the users who
ultimately bear the economic burden.

Setting aside the fact that such “contracts” are accessory
fo the provisions granting the incentives, one should recall
the principle — which has been repeatedly stated by this
court — that there cannot be a violation of the freedom of
economic initiative when the general limited that have been
put aim at promoting social welfare, as established by
article 41, para. 2, of the Constitution, provided that the
measures are not arbitrary and the intervention of the
legislature does not pursue its aim through measures which
are clearly incongruous..... Both these requirements, as
already said, have been complied by the provisions
reducing and rescheduling the incentives.

254. The Tribunal is, therefore, compelled to the conclusion that the
obligations which Respondent entered into with Claimant's

Investments (ie. Megasol, Phenix, and Enersol) were, as a matter of
Italian law subject to unilatcral modification by Respondent. The GSE
Agreements are all subject to Italian Jaw, and the awards which
Claimant cite do not have the effect of overriding a choice of
governing law made by the partics thereto. The obligations of
Respondent which it owed to Claimant’s Investments were delineated
by Italian law, which (when revealed by the Italian Constitutional
Court to be accessory in nature) allowed it to unilaterally modify such
obligations,

255. In such circumstances, the Tribunal dismisses Claimant’s Umbreila
Clause claims as argued for by it and summarised in its Opening
Presentation at the hearing (“/taly failed to fulfill the obligations it
emered into with respect to CEF’s investments, which were
crystallized in Tariff Confirmation Letters and Contracts"). Bearing
in mind the alternative prayer for relief advanced by Respondent
(“Article 10(1) ECT, last sentence (the so-called “umbrella clause”)
does not apply in the case at stake, or, alternatively, that the
Respondent did not violate it neither through statutory or regulatory
measures, nor the GSE Conventions"), the Tribunal considers the
latter proposition to be well-founded. In particular, apart from the fact
that the “obligations” are municipal matters, subject to Italian law, the
Tribunal does not consider the measures implemented by Respondent
to transgress the ECT requirement by a signatory state to
observe “any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party”. The
measures, of which Claimant makes complaint, were addresscd to all
PV producers and were, in the Tribunal's assessment, compliant with
Ttalian law (as emerged from the decision of the Italian Constitutional
Court).

Failure_to_provide transparent legal ework claims - __Unr ble

256. For convenience, the Tribunal considers these two claims together.

257. The Tribunal now records, in relevant part, Article 10(1) of the ECT:

Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area.

  

uch investments shall alse enjoy the most constant protection and
security and no Contracting Party shall in any way impair by

258. By way of introductory comment, and consistent with its findings

oS

carlicr in this award, none of the Taxation measures cun be taken into
account by the Tribunal when deciding whether either of these claims
are successfully made by Claimant. Thus, only Spalmaincentivi can
be considered by the Tribunal in its analysis.

. In light of the earlier discussion of Spalmaincentivi and, in particular,

the Tribunal’s observations that the rationale for the measure was
reasonable (which was not, in the specific circumstances of this case,
an answer to the legitimate expectation claims), it would be entirely
inconsistent to now find unreasonable impairment or a failure to
provide a transparent legal framework.

261. The Tribunal will now proceed, in the next section, consider what is
the consequence of the established breach of the ECT by Respondent.

Damages & Interest

 

262. As a starting point, Claimant sets out its legal position as follows in
the SoC: .

286, To determine the compensation that Italy awes to CEF, the
Tribunal should in the first instance look to any lex specialis in the
ECT and, in the absence of any lex specialis, to the rules of
customary international law. The only lex specialis standard of
compensation found in the ECT is in Article 13, which sets out the
conditions that Italy must satisfy in order to lawfully expropriate
investments held by protected investors in Italy. The ECT does not

 

pressly provide a d of Sor violations of the
ECT, and thus the customary international law principle of full
compensation fills the lacuna.

287. The principle of full compensation was first established by the
Permanent Court of International Justice in the seminal 1928 case
of Chorzéw Factory between Germany and Poland, which arose
Jrom Poland's unlawful seizure of a factory owned by a German
national. According to the Permanent Court of International
Justice:

It follows that the compensation due to the German
Government is not necessarily limited to the value of the
undertaking at the moment of dispossession, plus interest to
the day of payment. This limitation would only be
admissible if the Polish Government had had the right to
expropriate. ... [SJuch a limitation might result in placing
Germany and the interests protected by the Geneva
Convention, on behalf of which interests the German
Government is acting, in a situation more unfavourable
than that in which Germany and these interests would have
been if Poland had respected the said Convention. Such a

consequence would not only be unjust, but also and above
all incompatible with the aim of [the Convention].

tere

The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an
illegal act — a principle which seems to be established by
international practice and in particular by the decisions of
arbitral tribunals — is that reparation must, as far as
possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act
and re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible,
payment of a@ sum corresponding to the value which a
restitution in kind would bear; the award, if need be, of
damages for loss sustained which would not be covered hy
restitution in kind or payment in place of it — such are the
principles which should serve to determine the amount of
compensation due for an act contrary to international law.

263. In the SoD, Respondent’s position is as follows, and seeks to
differentiate the present case from that contemplated by the Chorzow
Factory case:

680. In the case at stake, the Tribunal should necessarily consider
the general and regulatory character of Italian measures, the
absence of any fraudulent intent whatsoever, the fundamental
public purpose characterizing each of the measures. Accordingly,
it should equitably reduce the amount of compensation (if any)
Jrom the full value of damages.

681. This conclusion is supported by case law. As quoted by the
Claimant itself, in the Azurix Annulment Decision the Committee
stated that “for breaches of BIT obligations other than the
expropriation clause, the Tribunal has a discretion in determining
the approach to damages”. Since no expropriation is claimed by
the Claimant, the Tribunal should employ its discretion precisely
to take into account the reasons expressed above. Incidentally,
such declaration of discretionary power is linked, in the Azurix
casé, to sustain that a tribunal is not compelled to use the “fair
market value” in non-expropriation cases.

682. In sum, Haly preliminarily contends that in the event that the
Tribunal were to award a compensation (quod non, as argued sub
V.2), the amount of such a compensation be in any case reduced by
considering the arguments exposed in this Section,

264. At para. 418 of the Reply, Claimant disputes Respondent's position:

Claimant does not request the full fair market value of their
investments as damages in this case. They request the diminution
in the fair market value of their investments caused by Italy's

illegal measures. The fact that the diminution in value is not total —
ie., it was around 26% — properly limits damages to the amount of
the diminution; it does not mean that the injury was insignificant
or that damages should be denied altogether on the ground that
the injury was not substantial enough to award a higher level of
damages that the Claimant does not seek.

265. The Tribunal does not sec a reason to depart from the long-established
principles articulated in the Chorzow Factory case. The way in which
Claimant presents its case, as sct out just above, is consistent with
those principles and it seeks compensation to “re-cstablish the
situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had

not been committed”.

266. The purpose of the protections found in the ECT are not, in the
Tribunal’s appreciation, designed to simply preserve profitability of
an ii Indeed if an i inued to be F ible, but

i which the i

contained in the ECT, then Respondent’s position would logically

result in, potentially, no compensation being awarded. Thus, such an
investor would be left with a lesser profit than would have been the
case had the mcasures in breach of the ECT not been deployed. Such

less so, ing nsgr P

a scenario would denude the ECT protections of practical application.

267. The Chorzow Factory principles do not operate to reward an investor,
or to make its investments more profitable than they would have been
had the offending measures not been implemented. Rather, the
purpose of Chorzow Factory is to “re-establish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed”. Specifically, the Tribunal considers the analysis is must
now make is what the position would have been in respect of the
Claimant’s investment in Enersol had the Spalmaincentivi not been
implemented.

268. As to the amounts claimed by Claimant, in a Memorandum dated 21
February 2018, Mr Edwards set out his calculation of the loss suffered

FILED: NEWCHORK: 1OQWNIH SOCLERKuteNLb/ ie SAEBLPMPage 1405 45 654707/2019

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

in respect of Enersol as being EUR 10,300,000.00 (such loss
assuming Robin Hood Tax, IMU/TASI, Administrative Fees and
Imbalance Costs fall outside of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction — which is
the case as found earlicr in this Award), excluding interest. Thus,
EUR 10,300,000.00 is Claimant’s remaining claim for compensation
given that the Tribunal has not found the Respondent liable for any
breach of the ECT in respect of either Megasol or Phenix.

269, Mr Edwards presents his calculations on the following basis, namely a
comparison of the value of the Enersol investment as on | January
2015 just prior to the implementation of the Spalmaincentivi, with the
value on the same date immediately afier such implementation. He
says (p. 4 of his presentation to the Tribunal dated 21 February 2018,
which was a summary of his previously-expressed opinions for the
purposes of the hearing) that 1 January 2015 is the date the most
significant change was implemented. He describes his approach as
follows (p. 5 of his presentation to the Tribunal dated 21 February
2018): “

My assessment of the Claimant's loss is the difference between the
value of its investments on the Date of Assessment us they actually
were (the Actual Position) and as they would have been had the
Principal Regulatory Changes not been made (the Counterfactual
Position),

270. As regards the “Actual Position” and “Counterfactual Position”, Mr
Edwards states the following as his methodology for valuation
respectively (p. 5 of his presentation to the Tribunal datcd 21
February 2018):

Market value of investments including impact of Principal
Regulatory Changes on I January 2015 - Market value of
investments absent impact of Principal Regulatory Changes on }
January 2015 - DCF method used to value investments

271.

Respondent's Expert, GRIF, puts its position in the Rejoinder Report
as follows:

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

 

3. On use of the DCF method and calculations in the First FTI
Financial Report Offering this as a supposed weakness, the FTI-
RII and the FTI-FRII repeatedly emphasise that our first two
reports (GRIF Economic Report and GRIF Financial Report) do
not criticise the DCF method or contest the approach used in the
FTI Financial Report to calculate the Opposing Party's alleged
losses.

An effective summary of the Opposing Party's position in this
regard appears in the Claimant's Reply (paragraph 437): “In
summary, GRIF’s entire quantum analysis simply parrots Italy's
argument on liability, disguised in the language of a quantum
analysis. GRIF offers no opinion on the losses attributable to the
Claims as pleaded, or indeed any criticism of FTI’s calculation of
those losses. Accordingly, the Tribunal should accept FTI’s
quanium analysis entirely,”

That aside, it is clear that the Opposing Party's experts did not
understand or else speciously ignored the terms of the issue in the
case ai hand, so our work completely escapes them. Our criticism
of the FTI Financial Report's approach goes much deeper, as it
contests its very foundation and thus the data arising from this
these assumptions. In summary, and for purposes of clarity:

- We did not dispute the FTI Financial Report’s calculations, but
rather its basic assumptions and, as a consequence, the resulting
data used to make these calculations.

- We identified the correct essential elements needed to
the obje and
investors at the time the investments were made.

~ We showed that when the correct essential elements are used,
the measures adopted by the Malian Government caused no
losses to the Oppesing Party. rnccesent a discussion about

Iculation methods b ding the one
proposed in the FTT Financial, Report. Finally, it makes even less
Sense to deepen potential mistakes in the calculation method
proposed in the FT! Financial Report.

272. The Tribunal’s appreciation of the position of GRIF is, therefore, that
it does not dispute the calculations made by Mr Edwards, but rather
approaches the issue of compensation upon a different premise. The
following conclusion of GRIF later in the Rejoinder Expert Report
encapsulates its position:

SCC Arbitration V (2015/158) - Award 7

 

SALE 7o OUECORVERTEMP age 1B a5 654707/2018

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

Considering average Italian production, the intervention through
the “Spalmaincentivi” decree reduces feed-in tariffs to an extent
much less than proportional to the increases in productivity that
the plants are reporting, with the overall result that consumer
expense is reduced without in any way negatively influencing the
economic and financial plans of the plants built. In fact, investors
continue to realise profits well beyond their expectations.

273, GRIF’s presentation (dated 22 February 2018) to the Tribunal at the

hearing states the following, at p. 25:

In the specific case, what happened is simply a little adjustment in
order to keep a fair profit having taken into account that incentives
were based on underestimated value of the solar radiation, with a
consequent over incentive on the revenues side. The 8%
adjustment reduces the extra-profits realised by PV plants af CEF
Energy, but they are still realising more profits than those
expected when the investments were made

274, Later in the same presentation (p, 27), in a similar vein, which echoes

the Respondent’s case on liability:

Ktaly did not impair CEF investments because Italy intervened
after a period of over-incentive to restore the efficient level of the
Stream of revenues.

275. The Tribunal prefers the methodology of Mr Edwards, namely, his
adoption of DCF. Quite apart [rom the fact that the DCF method is
well-established and accepted by investment arbitration tribunals over
many years for the purposcs of calculation of compensation, the
approach of GRIF would be inconsisient with the even longer-
established Chorzow Factory principle. The latter requires an
assessment of the position as if the act, found to be a breach of the
international obligation in question, had not occurred. GRIF’s
approach would, taken to its logical conclusion, would result in
ascertaining whether the investor was nonetheless making a “fair”
profit notwithstanding the measure found to be in breach, and,
therefore, such “fair” be sufficient compensation. That is not the

established principle found in Chorzow Factory.

276. Returning to the amount claimed in respect of Enersol, as noted
above, Mr Edwards presented his calculation of the ‘actual —v-
counterfactual’ position in a Memorandum dated 21 February 2018
with the assumption (which was made upon the invitation of the
Tribunal during the course of the hearing) that the Robin Hood Tax,
IMU/TASI, Administrative Fees and Imbalance Costs fell outside of
the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Mr Edwards’ calculations in this respect
are referenced to the spreadsheet (marked Appendix 5,1b) which
accompanied his reply report,

277, The Tribunal does not understand GRIF to gainsay Mr Edwards’
calculations (as discussed above, GRIF’s position was to approach the
underlying methodology differently, rather than to dispute the
correctness of his calculations pursuant to the DCF method).
Nonetheless, the Tribunal will now examine Mr Edwards’

ions as ined in the dsheet (marked Appendix 5.1b).

 

278. Within Mr Edwards’ spreadsheet there is a sheet which is entitled
“Key assumptions”. There are seven assumptions listed with a
“Yes/No” option adjacent. Changing these assumptions from Yes to

Joulati Isewhere in the spreadsh

No has a for

279, The Tribunal can immediately see, from the list of Key assumptions
that the first four (Robin Hood tax, IMU/TASI, Administrative Fee,
and Imbalance costs) must be set to “No” in order for consistency
with earlier findings in this award.

280. The next Key Assumption is “Loss from IT Decrease”. This is set, by
Mr Edwards to Yes. The Tribunal agrees, as this is the issue discussed
above.

FILED: NEWCHORE: MDoONds Page 14PBF 45 654707/2019

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 4 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

281. The next Key Assumption is “oss from IT Payment Term Change”
which Mr Edwards has set to Yes. In light of what the Tribunat has
already decided at para. 234 above, it, therefore, is setting this Key
assumption to No.

282. The final Key assumption (“Include negative free cash flow”) is
already set to No by Mr Edwards and is not, therefore changed by the
Tribunal.

283. Having set the Key assumptions in a manner consistent with the
Tribunal’s findings, the amount of the claim in respect of Enersol
emerges from the calculations on the sheet entitled “Summary tables”,
namely, EUR 9,600,000.00.

284. ‘lo summarise, the Tribunal holds, insofar as it has the jurisdiction to
do so, that the ‘actual —v- counterfactual’ position as of 1 January
2015 in respect of the Claimant’s investment in Enersof results in an
amount of EUR 9,600,000.00 by which such investment has been
lessened by the Spamalincentivi.

285. Turning to interest, Claimant seeks pre- and post-Award compound
interest from the Tribunal at, according to para. 305 of the SoC,
“based on international commercial rates”. While Claimant’s
calculation, as presented by Mr Edwards, altcrnate between
Respondent's cost of debt and Claimant’s cost of debt, the Tribunal
prefers to award interest at the following rate: annually, LIBOR plus
2%, Compound interest, therefore, at a rate of LIBOR plus 2%,
annually, on EUR 9,600,000.00 from | January 2015, until payment
in full.

Costs

First, pursuant to Article 43 of the SCC Rules, the “Costs of the
Arbitration” are: (i) the Fees of the Tribunal; (ii) the Administrative
Fee; and (iii) the expenses of the Tribunal and the SCC. The Parties
are jointly and severally liable to pay the Costs of the Arbitration.

Claimant has prevailed in this arbitration in a number of respects: (a)
the “intra EU” jurisdiction issue, which has occupied a very
considerable part of the written argument before the Tribunal, both
before, and then, in particular, afterwards with extensive submissions
on Achmea; and (b) its FEY claim in respect of Enersol resulting in an
award of EUR 9,600,000.00 plus interest. On the other hand, a
number of Claimant’s claims did not succeed in their entircty
(Megasol and Phenix), and aspects of the Enersol claim were captured
by Article 21 of the ECT. Placing all of these factors together does
still, in the Tribunal’s estimation, mcan that Claimant was the
prevailing party but the attenuated measure of its overall success will
be appropriately taken into account in the amount of costs awarded
against Respondent.

As regards allocation of liability as between the Partics for the Costs
of the Arbitration, with the background of the matters set out in para.
289 above in mind, the Tribunal considers that an amount of EUR
100,000.00 (excluding VAT) to be paid by Respondent to Claimant is
appropriate.

. Secondly, turning to the costs incurred by Claimant (as per Article 44

of the SCC Rules), the amounts sought are as follows:

Legal Fees

FOREWORD

The Energy Charter Treaty is a unique instrument for the promotion of international
cooperation in the energy sector. Following its entry into force on 16 April 1998, the
Treaty, together with the related documents contained in this booklet, provides an
important legal basis for the creation of an open international energy market.

The Charter process includes the countries of the enlarged European Union, Central
and Eastern Europe, the Russian Federation, Central Asia and the Caucasus, as well
as Japan, Australia and Mongolia. The Treaty remains open for accession by all
countries committed to observance of its principles. It is very positive in this regard
that states such as China, Iran, South Korea and the countries of ASEAN are taking
a close interest in the Charter process, thus opening up the prospect of a further
extension of its geographical scope.

The primary challenge facing the constituent members of the Energy Charter
process in the coming years will be that of ensuring full implementation of the
Treaty’s commitments, This will entail increased focus on multilateral cooperation
over transit, trade, investments, environmental protection and energy efficiency. By
continuing to build on its existing work in these areas, the Charter process stands
ready to play a key role in translating the aim of a truly open non-discriminatory
energy market into reality.

This publication of the Energy Charter Treaty and related documents has been made
possible thanks to a generous financial contribution from the Netherlands. On
behalf of the Energy Charter Secretariat, I would like to express my sincere gratitude
for this support. I trust that this publication will provide a valuable reference tool,
and also help in raising broader awareness about the provisions of the Energy
Charter Treaty.

AN INTRODUCTION TO THE
ENERGY CHARTER TREATY
WHY AN ENERGY CHARTER?

‘The roots of the Energy Charter date back to a political initiative launched in Europe
in the early 1990s, at a time when the end of the Cold War offered an unprecedented
opportunity to overcome the previous economic divisions on the European
continent. Nowhere were the prospects for mutually beneficial cooperation
between East and West clearer than in the energy sector. Russia and many of its
neighbours were rich in energy resources but needed major investments to ensure
their development, whilst the states of western Europe had a strategic interest in
diversifying their sources of energy supplies. There was therefore a recognised need
to ensure that a commonly accepted foundation was established for developing
energy cooperation between the states of the Eurasian continent. On the basis of
these considerations, the Energy Charter process was born.

More than a decade later, the role of the Charter’s legally-binding foundation,
the Energy Charter Treaty, remains very significant. In a world of increasing
globalisation and interdependence between net exporters of energy and net
importers, the value of multilateral rules providing a balanced and efficient
framework for international cooperation is widely recognised.

The Energy Charter Treaty provides a multilateral framework for energy
cooperation that is unique under international law, and the strategic value of these
rules is likely to increase in the context of efforts to build a legal foundation for
global energy security, based on the principles of open, competitive markets and
sustainable development.

The Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol on Energy Efficiency
and Related Environmental Aspects were signed in December 1994 and entered into
legal force in April 1998. To date the Treaty has been signed or acceded to by fifty-
one states plus the European Communities (the total number of its Signatories is
therefore fifty-two).

The Treaty was developed on the basis of the European Energy Charter of 1991.
Whereas the latter document was drawn up as a declaration of political intent to
promote East-West energy cooperation, the Energy Charter Treaty is a legally-
binding multilateral instrument, the only one of its kind dealing specifically with
inter-governmental cooperation in the energy sector.

RE 6 B J BI 1p - 654707/2019
NYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

 

The fundamental aim of the Energy Charter Treaty is to strengthen the rule of
law on energy issues, by creating a level playing field of rules to be observed by all
participating governments, thus minimising the risks associated with energy-related
investments and trade.

‘The Treaty’s provisions focus on five broad areas: the protection and promotion of
foreign energy investments, based on the extension of national treatment, or most-
favoured nation treatment (whichever is more favourable); free trade in energy
materials, products and energy-related equipment, based on WTO rules; freedom
of energy transit through pipelines and grids; reducing the negative environmental
impact of the energy cycle through improving energy efficiency; and mechanisms
for the resolution of State-to-State or Investor-to-State disputes.

INVESTMENT

The fundamental objective of the Energy Charter Treaty’s provisions on investment
issues is to ensure the creation of a “level playing field” for energy sector investments
throughout the Charter’s constituency, with the aim of reducing to a minimum the
non-commercial risks associated with energy-sector investments.

The Treaty ensures the protection of foreign energy investments based on the
principle of non-discrimination. By accepting the Treaty, a state takes on the
obligation to extend national treatment, or most-favoured nation treatment
(whichever is more favourable), to nationals and legal entities of other Signatory
states who have invested in its energy sector. The Treaty thus carries the equivalent
legal force of a unified network of bilateral investment protection treaties.

The majority of the Treaty’s investment-related provisions, aimed at the creation of
the appropriate investment climate, are self-implementing. However, the Energy
Charter Conference maintains a constant political focus on investment climate
issues, by providing regular assessments, through survey activities and peer reviews,
of investment practices among its participating states.

In its present form, the Treaty obliges Contracting Parties to accord non-
discriminatory treatment only to existing investments made by investors of other
Contracting Parties. The adoption of a Supplementary Treaty that would extend this
obligation to ensure non-discriminatory treatment also in the pre-investment phase
(the so-called “Making of Investments” stage) remains under discussion among the
Energy Charter’s member states,

TRADE

The Energy Charter Treaty’s trade provisions, which were initially based on the
trading regime of the GATT, were modified by the adoption in April 1998 of a Trade
Amendment to the Treaty.

This brought the Treaty’s trade provisions into line with WTO rules and practice,
which are founded on the fundamental principles of non-discrimination,
transparency and a commitment to the progressive liberalisation of international
trade, The Trade Amendment also expands the Treaty’s scope to cover trade in
energy-related equipment, and sets out a mechanism for introducing in future a
legally-binding stand-still on customs duties and charges for energy-related imports
and exports.

The Treaty’s amended trade regime represents an important stepping stone for
those Signatory states that have not yet acceded to the WTO. It allows them to
familiarise themselves with the practices and disciplines that WTO membership
entails, through application of its rules “by reference” to trade in energy materials
and products and energy-related equipment.

TRANSIT

The Energy Charter Treaty’s existing transit provisions oblige its Contracting Parties
to facilitate the transit of energy on a non-discriminatory basis consistent with
the principle of freedom of transit. This is a critical issue for the collective energy
security of the Charter’s Signatory states, since energy resources are increasingly
being transported across multiple national boundaries on their way from producer
to consumer.

For this reason, the Charter’s participating states have looked to enhance the Treaty's
provisions on transit through the elaboration of a Transit Protocol, on which formal
negotiations commenced in early 2000. This item remains under discussion. The
Transit Protocol’s aim is to develop a regime of commonly-accepted operative
principles covering transit flows of energy resources, both hydrocarbons and
electricity, crossing at least two national boundaries, designed to ensure the security
and non- interruption of transit.

The Energy Charter Conference approved in 1998 a set of rules of procedure for
the conduct of conciliation during disputes over matters of energy transit. The
Conference also took positive note in 2003 of the first edition of Model Agreements
on Cross-Border Pipelines, prepared on the basis of a mandate from the Conference
in 1999, All of these documents are available on the Energy Charter's web site (www.
encharter.org)

ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

The Energy Charter Protocol on Energy Efficiency and Related Environmental
Aspects (PEEREA) was signed together with the Energy Charter Treaty in
December 1994, PEEREA requires its participating states to formulate clear policy
aims for improving energy efficiency and reducing the energy cycle’s negative
environmental impact.

Through the implementation of PEEREA, the Energy Charter provides transition
economies with a menu of good practices and a forum in which to share experiences
and policy advice on energy efficiency issues with leading OECD states, Within this
forum, particular attention is paid to such aspects of a national energy efficiency
strategy as taxation, pricing policy in the energy sector, environmentally-related
subsidies and other mechanisms for financing energy efficiency objectives.

PEEREAs development is currently focused on a series of in-depth energy efficiency
reviews, designed to produce concrete recommendations for individual governments
concerning ways of improving their national energy efficiency strategies. To date
such in-depth reviews have been conducted in Denmark, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Estonia, Moldova, Lithuania, Poland, Hungary, Turkey, Bulgaria and
Romania.

The UN-ECE “Envi for Europe” Ministerial Conf e, which was held in
Kyiv, Ukraine, in May 2003, based its findings in the area of energy efficiency on the
work carried out on PEEREA’S implementation.

DISPUTE SETTLEMENT MECHANISMS

The Energy Charter Treaty establishes dispute settlement procedures for cases of
investment-related disputes between an investor and a Contracting Party, and for
state-to-state dispute concerning the application or interpretation of the Energy
Charter Treaty between Contracting Parties.

There is, in addition, a more specific mechanism under the Treaty for trade-related
disputes between Contracting Parties (envisaging the application of a panel system
along the lines of WTO Dispute Settlement Understanding procedures).

The existence of the Treaty’s dispute settlement procedures is of considerable value
in confidence-building terms. The fact that such procedures are available, and that
the Treaty’s Contracting Parties have taken on the unconditional obligation to
accept their application where necessary, provides reassurance for investors that, in
the case of a dispute, they will be entitled to have recourse to the above mechanisms
in defence of their interests.

THE ENERGY CHARTER SECRETARIAT

The Energy Charter Conference is served by a small permanent Secretariat based in
Brussels. The Secretariat is staffed by energy sector experts from various countries
of the Conference's constituency, and is headed by a Secretary General.

‘The Secretariat's functions are:

« to monitor implementation of the Energy Charter Treaty and Protocol's
obligations;

+ to organise and administer meetings of the Conference and its subsidiary
bodies;

* to provide analytical support and advice to the Conference and its
subsidiary bodies on all aspects of the Energy Charter process;

« to represent the Energy Charter Conference in the development of
its relations with non-member states and other relevant international
organisations and institutions;

+ to support negotiations on new instruments mandated by the Conference;

« toconduct or facilitate dispute resolution/conciliation procedures.

THE ENERGY CHARTER PROCESS

Participation in the Energy Charter process is not limited merely to the act of
signing the Energy Charter Treaty. The Energy Charter represents not only a legal
framework, but also a multilateral policy forum where governments from across
Eurasia participate in a dialogue on issues affecting cooperation in the energy
sector.

Under the Charter’s auspices, a programme of work is carried out aimed both
at ensuring that the provisions of the Treaty are observed at national levels, and
also at encouraging dialogue between member countries on such issues as energy
market restructuring, promoting energy efficiency, and reducing barriers to energy
investments and trade regionally and globally.

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

Examples of the Energy Charter’s work in this area include:

* The development of a set of Best-Practice Guidelines on Energy Market
Restructuring, designed to provide practical assistance to economies in
transition by examining and summarising the lessons learned by various
countries in conducting energy-sector privatisations and in establishing
regulatory mechanisms to ensure fair competition within a liberalised
energy market.

+ The development of a study on the operation of Regional Electricity
Markets in the Eurasian area, aimed at identifying existing barriers to trade
in electricity of a legal, technical or regulatory nature and at proposing
possible means to overcome them.

* An analysis of Natural Gas Markets in the Eurasian area and the prospects
for their future development in line with the Energy Charter's goal of
establishing open, competitive energy markets. This analysis is designed
to provide a platform for policy discussions among the Charter's member
governments on issues that need to be addressed in order to strengthen
their cooperation in the area of natural gas investments and trade.

« A study on the development of Co-generation and District Heating
in Europe, assessing inter alia the impact of energy market reforms in
transition economies on the potential for using co-generation technologies
to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

GEOGRAPHICAL EXPANSION OF THE ENERGY CHARTER

The Energy Charter is an open process. Interested non-member countries are
welcome to join, subject to the approval of the Energy Charter Conference and to a
demonstration by the country concerned of its readiness to take on the obligations
contained in the Energy Charter Treaty.

Although the Charter began its life as a European initiative, it has long since taken
on a wider geographical dimension, reflecting the tendency towards a unified
Eurasian energy market. Japan, Australia and the states of Central Asia signed the
Treaty in 1994-1995. They were subsequently joined by Mongolia, which acceded to
the Treaty in 1999. The Asian dimension of the Charter was further strengthened
when Observer status was granted to the People’s Republic of China in 2001, to
the Republic of Korea in 2002, and to the ASEAN Centre for Energy in 2003. The
Islamic Republic of Iran became an Observer in 2002. In the Mediterranean region,
discussions have been held with Morocco and Tunisia on their possible accession to
the Treaty.

Conference, as did invited observers from certain countries and international
organizations.

BACKGROUND

During the meeting of the European Council in Dublin in June 1990, the
Prime Minister of the Netherlands suggested that economic recovery in
Eastern Europe and the then Union of Soviet Socialist Republics could be
catalysed and accelerated by co-operation in the energy sector. This suggestion
was welcomed by the Council, which invited the Commission of the European
Communities to study how best to implement such co-operation. In February
1991 the Commission proposed the concept of a European Energy Charter.

Following discussion of the Commission’s proposal in the Council of the
European Communities, the European Communities invited the other
countries of Western and Eastern Europe, of the Union of Soviet Socialist
Republics and the non-European members of the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development to attend a conference in Brussels in July 1991

to launch negotiations on the European Energy Charter. A number of other
countries and international organizations were invited to attend the European
Energy Charter Conference as observers.

Negotiations on the European Energy Charter were completed in 1991 and the
Charter was adopted by signature of a Concluding Document at a conference
held at The Hague on 16-17 December 1991. Signatories of the Charter,
then or subsequently, include all those listed in Section 1 above, other than
observers.

‘The signatories of the European Energy Charter undertook:

- to pursue the objectives and principles of the Charter and implement and
broaden their co-operation as soon as possible by negotiating in good faith
a Basic Agreement and Protocols.

The European Energy Charter Conference accordingly began negotiations
on a Basic Agreement — later called the Energy Charter Treaty — designed
to promote East-West industrial co-operation by providing legal safeguards
in areas such as investment, transit and trade, It also began negotiations on
Protocols in the fields of energy efficiency, nuclear safety and hydrocarbons,
although in the last case negotiations were later suspended until completion of
the Energy Charter Treaty.

Negotiations on the Energy Charter Treaty and the Energy Charter Protocol
on Energy Efficiency and Related Environmental Aspects were successfully
completed in 1994.

THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

As a result of its deliberations the European Energy Charter Conference has
adopted the text of the Energy Charter Treaty (hereinafter referred to as the
“Treaty”) which is set out in Annex | and Decisions with respect thereto which
are set out in Annex 2, and agreed that the Treaty would be open for signature
at Lisbon from 17 December 1994 to 16 June 1995.

UNDERSTANDINGS

IV. By signing the Final Act, the representatives agreed to adopt the following
Understandings with respect to the Treaty:

1. With respect to the Treaty as a whole

(a) The representatives underline that the provisions of the Treaty have
been agreed upon bearing in mind the specific nature of the Treaty
aiming at a legal framework to promote long-term co-operation in a
particular sector and as a result cannot be construed to constitute a
precedent in the context of other international negotiations.

ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

(b) The provisions of the Treaty do not:
{i) oblige any Contracting Party to introduce mandatory third party
access; or
(ii) prevent the use of pricing systems which, within a particular
category of consumers, apply identical prices to customers in
different locations.
(c) Derogations from most favoured nation treatment are not intended to

cover measures which are specific to an Investor or group of Investors,
rather than applying generally.

2, With respect to Article 1(5)

(a) It is understood that the Treaty confers no rights to engage in economic
activities other than Economic Activities in the Energy Sector.

(b) The following activities are illustrative of Economic Activity in the
Energy Sector:

(i) prospecting and exploration for, and extraction of, e.g., oil, gas,
coal and uranium;

{ii) construction and operation of power generation facilities,
including those powered by wind and other renewable energy
sources;

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 5 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

 

(iv) removal and disposal of wastes from energy related facilities such
as power stations, including radioactive wastes from nuclear power
stations;

(v) decommissioning of energy related facilities, including oil rigs, oil
refineries and power generating plants;

(vi) marketing and sale of, and trade in Energy Materials and Products,
e.g., retail sales of gasoline; and

(vii) research, consulting, planning, management and design activities
related to the activities mentioned above, including those aimed at
Improving Energy Efficiency.

3. With respect to Article 1(6)

For greater clarity as to whether an Investment made in the Area of one
Contracting Party is controlled, directly or indirectly, by an Investor of
any other Contracting Party, control of an Investment means control
in fact, determined after an examination of the actual circumstances in
each situation. In any such examination, all relevant factors should be
considered, including the Investor's

(a) financial interest, including equity interest, in the Investment,

(b) ability to exercise substantial influence over the management and
operation of the Investment; and

(c) ability to exercise substantial influence over the selection of members
of the board of directors or any other managing body.

Where there is doubt as to whether an Investor controls, directly or
indirectly, an Investment, an Investor claiming such control has the burden
of proof that such control exists.

4. With respect to Article 1(8)

Consistent with Australia’s foreign investment policy, the establishment of
a new mining or raw materials processing project in Australia with total
investment of $A 10 million or more by a foreign interest, even where
that foreign interest is already operating a similar business in Australia, is
considered as the making of a new investment.

18. With respect to Article 29(2)(a)

(a) Where a provision of GATT 1947 or a Related Instrument referred to
in this paragraph provides for joint action by parties to the GATT, it is
intended that the Charter Conference take such action.

()

The notion “applied on 1 March 1994 and practised with regard to
Energy Materials and Products by parties to GATT 1947 among
themselves” is not intended to refer to cases where a party to the
GATT has invoked article XXXV of the GATT, thereby disapplying the
GATT vis-a-vis another party to the GATT, but nevertheless applies
unilaterally on a de facto basis some provisions of the GATT vis-a-vis
that other party to the GATT.

ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

19. With respect to Article 33

The provisional Charter Conference should at the earliest possible date
decide how best to give effect to the goal of Title III of the European Energy
Charter that Protocols be negotiated in areas of co-operation such as those
listed in Title IfI of the Charter.

20. With respect to Article 34

(a) The provisional Secretary-General should make immediate contact
with other international bodies in order to discover the terms on which
they might be willing to undertake tasks arising from the Treaty and
the Charter. The provisional Secretary-General might report back to
the provisional Charter Conference at the meeting which Article 45(4)
requires to be convened not later than 180 days after the opening date
for signature of the Treaty.

(b) The Charter Conference should adopt the annual budget before the
beginning of the financial year.

21. With respect to Article 34(3)(m)

The technical changes to Annexes might for instance include, the listing of

ratify, or additions to Annexes N and VC. It is intended that the Secretariat
would propose such changes to the Charter Conference when appropriate.

22. With respect to Annex TFU(1)

(a) Ifsome of the parties to an agreement referred to in paragraph (1) have
not signed or acceded to the Treaty at the time required for notification,
those parties to the agreement which have signed or acceded to the

VI.

(b) The need in general for notification of agreements of a purely
commercial nature is not foreseen because such agreements should
not raise a question of compliance with Article 29(2)(a), even when
they are entered into by state agencies, The Charter Conference could,
however, clarify for purposes of Annex TFU which types of agreements
referred to in Article 29(2)(b) require notification under the Annex
and which types do not.

DECLARATIONS

The representatives declared that Article 18(2) shall not be construed to allow
the circumvention of the application of the other provisions of the Treaty.

The representatives also noted the following Declarations that were made with
respect to the Treaty:

1. With respect to Article 1(6)

The Russian Federation wishes to have reconsidered, in negotiations with
regard to the supplementary treaty referred to in Article 10(4), the question
of the importance of national legislation with respect to the issue of control
as expressed in the Understanding to Article 1(6).

2. With respect to Articles 5 and 10(11

Australia notes that the provisions of Articles 5 and 10(11) do not diminish
its rights and obligations under the GATT, including as elaborated in the
Uruguay Round Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures,
particularly with respect to the list of exceptions in Article 5(3), which it
considers incomplete.

Australia further notes that it would not be appropriate for dispute
settlement bodies established under the Treaty to give interpretations of
GATT articles III and XI in the context of disputes between parties to the
GATT or between an Investor of a party to the GATT and another party
to the GATT. It considers that with respect to the application of Article
10(11) between an Investor and a party to the GATT, the only issue that
can be considered under Article 26 is the issue of the awards of arbitration
in the event that a GATT panel or the WTO dispute settlement body first
establishes that a trade-related investment measure maintained by the
Contracting Party is inconsistent with its obligations under the GATT or
the Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures.

3. With respect to Article 7

The European Communities and their Member States and Austria,
Norway, Sweden and Finland declare that the provisions of Article 7 are
subject to the conventional rules of international law on jurisdiction over
submarine cables and pipelines or, where there are no such rules, to general
international law.

They further declare that Article 7 is not intended to affect the
interpretation of existing international law on jurisdiction over submarine
cables and pipelines, and cannot be considered as doing so.

. With respect to Article 10°

Canada and the United States each affirm that they will apply the provisions
of Article 10 in accordance with the following considerations:

For the purposes of assessing the treatment which must be accorded
to Investors of other Contracting Parties and their Investments, the
circumstances will need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. A
comparison between the treatment accorded to Investors of one
Contracting Party, or the Investments of Investors of one Contracting Party,
and the Investments or Investors of another Contracting Party, is only valid
if it is made between Investors and Investments in similar circumstances.
In determining whether differential treatment of Investors or Investments
is consistent with Article 10, two basic factors must be taken into account.

The first factor is the policy objectives of Contracting Parties in
various fields insofar as they are consistent with the principles of non-
discrimination set out in Article 10, Legitimate policy objectives may
justify differential treatment of foreign Investors or their Investments in
order to reflect a dissimilarity of relevant circumstances between those
Investors and Investments and their domestic counterparts. For example,
the objective of ensuring the integrity of a country’s financial system would
justify reasonable prudential measures with respect to foreign Investors
or Investments, where such measures would be unnecessary to ensure
the attainment of the same objectives insofar as domestic Investors or
Investments are concerned. Those foreign Investors or their Investments
would thus not be “in similar circumstances” to domestic Investors or their
Investments. ‘Thus, even if such a measure accorded differential treatment,
it would not be contrary to Article 10.

Editor's note: Canada and the United States of America have not signed the Energy Charter Treaty.

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 5

RECEIVED NYSCEF:

The second factor is the extent to which the measure is motivated by the
fact that the relevant Investor or Investment is subject to foreign ownership
or under foreign control. A measure aimed specifically at Investors because
they are foreign, without sufficient countervailing policy reasons consistent
with the preceding paragraph, would be contrary to the principles of Article
10. The foreign Investor or Investment would be “in similar circumstances”
to domestic Investors and their Investments, and the measure would be
contrary to Article 10.

. With respect to Article 25

The European Communities and their Member States recall that, in
accordance with article 58 of the Treaty establishing the European
Community:

a) companies or firms formed in accordance with the law of a Member
State and having their registered office, central administration or
principal place of business within the Community shall, for the right
of establishment pursuant to Part Three, Title III, Chapter 2 of the
Treaty establishing the European Community, be treated in the same
way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States; companies
or firms which only have their registered office within the Community
must, for this purpose, have an effective and continuous link with the
economy of one of the Member States;

(b) “companies and firms” means companies or firms constituted under
civil or commercial law, including co-operative societies, and other
legal persons governed by public or private law, save for those which
are non-profitmaking.

The European Communities and their Member States further recall that:

Community law provides for the possibility to extend the treatment
described above to branches and agencies of companies or firms not
established in one of the Member States; and that, the application
of Article 25 of the Energy Charter Treaty will allow only those
derogations necessary to safeguard the preferential treatment resulting
from the wider process of economic integration resulting from the
Treaties establishing the European Communities.

ith res; icle 40

Denmark recalls that the European Energy Charter does not apply to
Greenland and the Faroe Islands until notice to this effect has been received
from the local governments of Greenland and the Faroe Islands.

trade in nuclear materials between them shall be governed, until
they reach another agreement, by the provisions of article 22 of the
Agreement on Partnership and Co-operation establishing a partnership

in no way prejudice the rules in Contracting Parties governing the system of
property ownership of energy resources.

Each state continues to hold in particular the rights to decide the geographical
areas within its Area to be made available for exploration and development of
its energy resources, the optimalization of their recovery and the rate at which
they may be depleted or otherwise exploited, to specify and enjoy any taxes,
royalties or other financial payments payable by virtue of such exploration
and exploitation, and to regulate the environmental and safety aspects of such
exploration, development and reclamation within its Area, and to participate
in such exploration and exploitation, inter alia, through direct participation by
the government or through state enterprises.

The Contracting Parties undertake to facilitate access to energy resources, inter
alia, by allocating in a non-discriminatory manner on the basis of published
criteria authorizations, licences, concessions and contracts to prospect and
explore for or to exploit or extract energy resources.

ARTICLE 19
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS

In pursuit of sustainable development and taking into account its obligations
under those international agreements concerning the environment to which it

(a) two years from the date of entry into force of this Treaty if the Contracting
Party is a party to the GATT; or

(b) three years from the date of entry into force of this Treaty if the Contracting

During the applicable period referred to in paragraph (3) a Contracting Party
shall not modify the terms of any trade-related investment measure which it

the Responsible Party shall take such reasonable measures as may be available
to it to ensure observance of the Treaty in respect of the measure.

(2) The Responsible Party shall, within 30 days from the date the award is made,
provide to the Secretariat written notice of its intentions as to ensuring
observance of the Treaty in respect of the measure. The Secretariat shall
present the notification to the Charter Conference at the earliest practicable
opportunity, and no later than the meeting of the Charter Conference following
receipt of the notice. If it is impracticable to ensure observance immediately,
the Responsible Party shall have a reasonable period of time in which to do so.
The reasonable period of time shall be agreed by both parties to the dispute.
In the event that such agreement is not reached, the Responsible Party shall
propose a reasonable period for approval by the Charter Conference.

Where the Responsible Party fails, within the reasonable period of time,
to ensure observance in respect of the measure, it shall at the request of the
other Contracting Party party to the dispute (hereinafter referred to as the
“Injured Party”) endeavour to agree with the Injured Party on appropriate
compensation as a mutually satisfactory resolution of the dispute.

If no satisfactory compensation has been agreed within 20 days of the request
of the Injured Party, the Injured Party may with the authorization of the
Charter Conference suspend such of its obligations to the Responsible Party
under the Treaty as it considers equivalent to those denied by the measure in
question, until such time as the Contracting Parties have reached agreement on
a resolution of their dispute or the non-conforming measure has been brought
into conformity with the Treaty.

In considering what obligations to suspend, the Injured Party shall apply the
following principles and procedures:

(a) The Injured Party should first seek to suspend obligations with respect
to the same Part of the ‘Treaty as that in which the tribunal has found a
violation.

(b)If the Injured Party considers that it is not practicable or effective to
suspend obligations with respect to the same Part of the Treaty, it may
seek to suspend obligations in other Parts of the Treaty. If the Injured
Party decides to request authorization to suspend obligations under this
subparagraph, it shall state the reasons therefor in its request to the Charter
Conference for authorization.

On written request of the Responsible Party, delivered to the Injured Party
and to the President of the tribunal that rendered the award, the tribunal shall
determine whether the level of obligations suspended by the Injured Party is
excessive, and if so, to what extent. If the tribunal cannot be reconstituted,
such determination shall be made by one or more arbitrators appointed by
the Secretary-General. Determinations pursuant to this paragraph shall be
completed within 60 days of the request to the tribunal or the appointment
by the Secretary-General. Obligations shall not be suspended pending the
determination, which shall be final and binding.

In suspending any obligations to a Responsible Party, an Injured Party shall
make every effort not to affect adversely the rights under the Treaty of any
other Contracting Party.

(b)A Contracting Party may make a written request to any other Contracting
Party for consultations regarding any existing measure of the other
Contracting Party that it considers might affect materially compliance with
provisions applicable to trade under Article 5 or 29. A Contracting Party
which requests consultations shall to the fullest extent possible indicate the
measure complained of and specify the provisions of Article 5 or 29 and of
the GATT and Related Instruments that it considers relevant. Requests to
consult pursuant to this paragraph shall be notified to the Secretariat, which
shall periodically inform the Contracting Parties of pending consultations
that have been notified.

(c) A Contracting Party shall treat any confidential or proprietary information
identified as such and contained in or received in response to a written
request, or received in the course of consultations, in the same manner in
which it is treated by the Contracting Party providing the information.

(d)In seeking to resolve matters considered by a Contracting Party to affect
compliance with provisions applicable to trade under Article 5 or 29 as
between itself and another Contracting Party, the Contracting Parties
participating in consultations or other dispute settlement shall make every
effort to avoid a resolution that adversely affects the trade of any other
Contracting Party.

(2) (a) If, within 60 days from the receipt of the request for consultation referred
to in subparagraph (1)(b), the Contracting Parties have not resolved their

Contracting Parties and the Secretariat have received written notice of its
interest no later than the date of establishment of the panel, as determined
in accordance with subparagraph (c).

(c) A panel shall be deemed to be established 45 days after the receipt of the
written request of a Contracting Party by the Secretariat pursuant to

(d)A panel shall be composed of three members who shall be chosen by the
Secretary-General from the roster described in paragraph (7). Except

(b), or citizens of states members of a Regional Economic Integration
Organization which either is party to the dispute or has notified its interest

to the nominations of panel members and shall not oppose nominations
except for compelling reasons.

(f) Panel members shall serve in their individual capacities and shall neither
seek nor take instruction from any government or other body. Each
Contracting Party undertakes to respect these principles and not to seek to

sufficient diversity of backgrounds and breadth of experience are reflected
in a panel.

(g) The Secretariat shall promptly notify all Contracting Parties that a panel has
been constituted.

(3) (a)The Charter Conference shall adopt rules of procedure for panel
proceedings consistent with this Annex. Rules of procedure shall be as close

The proceedings of a panel shall be confidential. A panel shall make an
objective assessment of the matters before it, including the facts of the
dispute and the compliance of measures with the provisions applicable to
trade under Article 5 or 29. In exercising its functions, a panel shall consult
with the disputing Contracting Parties and give them adequate opportunity
to arrive at a mutually satisfactory solution. Unless otherwise agreed by
the disputing Contracting Parties, a panel shall base its decision on the
arguments and submissions of the disputing Contracting Parties. Panels
shall be guided by the interpretations given to the GATT and Related
Instruments within the framework of the GATT, and shall not question the
compatibility with Article 5 or 29 of practices applied by any Contracting
Party which is a party to the GATT to other parties to the GATT to which
it applies the GATT and which have not been taken by those other parties
to dispute resolution under the GATT.

Unless otherwise agreed by the disputing Contracting Parties, all
procedures involving a panel, including the issuance of its final report,
should be completed within 180 days of the date of establishment of the
panel; however, a failure to complete all procedures within this period shall
not affect the validity of a final report.

(b)A panel shall determine its jurisdiction; such determination shall be final
and binding. Any objection by a disputing Contracting Party that a dispute
is not within the jurisdiction of the panel shall be considered by the panel,
which shall decide whether to deal with the objection as a preliminary
question or to join it to the merits of the dispute.

{c} In the event of two or more requests for establishment of a panel in relation
to disputes that are substantively similar, the Secretary-General may with
the consent of all the disputing Contracting Parties appoint a single panel.

(4) (a) After having considered rebuttal arguments, a panel shall submit to the
disputing Contracting Parties the descriptive sections of its draft written
report, including a statement of the facts and a summary of the arguments
made by the disputing Contracting Parties. The disputing Contracting
Parties shall be afforded an opportunity to submit written comments on the
descriptive sections within a period set by the panel.

Following the date set for receipt of comments from the Contracting
Parties, the panel shall issue to the disputing Contracting Parties an interim
written report, including both the descriptive sections and the panel’s
proposed findings and conclusions. Within a period set by the panel a
disputing Contracting Party may submit to the panel a written request that
the panel review specific aspects of the interim report before issuing a final
report. Before issuing a final report the panel may, in its discretion, meet
with the disputing Contracting Parties to consider the issues raised in such
a request.

The final report shall include descriptive sections (including a statement
of the facts and a summary of the arguments made by the disputing
Contracting Parties), the panel’s findings and conclusions, and a discussion
of arguments made on specific aspects of the interim report at the stage of
its review. The final report shall deal with every substantial issue raised
before the panel and necessary to the resolution of the dispute and shall
stale the reasons for the panel’s conclusions.

ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

A panel shall issue its final report by providing it promptly to the Secretariat
and to the disputing Contracting Parties. The Secretariat shall at the earliest
practicable opportunity distribute the final report, together with any written
views that a disputing Contracting Party desires to have appended, to all
Contracting Parties.

(b) Where a panel concludes that a measure introduced or maintained by a
Contracting Party does not comply with a provision of Article 5 or 29 or
with a provision of the GATT or a Related Instrument that applies under
Article 29, the panel may recommend in its final report that the Contracting
Party alter or abandon the measure or conduct so as to be in compliance
with that provision.

(c) Panel reports shall be adopted by the Charter Conference. In order to
provide sufficient time for the Charter Conference to consider panel
reports, a report shall not be adopted by the Charter Conference until at
least 30 days after it has been provided to all Contracting Parties by the
Secretariat. Contracting Parties having objections to a panel report shall
give written reasons for their objections to the Secretariat at least 10 days
prior to the date on which the report is to be considered for adoption by
the Charter Conference, and the Secretariat shall promptly provide them to
all Contracting Parties. The disputing Contracting Parties and Contracting
Parties which notified their interest in accordance with subparagraph (2)(b)
shall have the right to participate fully in the consideration of the panel
report on that dispute by the Charter Conference, and their views shall be
fully recorded.

(d)In order to ensure effective resolution of disputes to the benefit
of all Contracting Parties, prompt compliance with rulings and
recommendations of a final panel report that has been adopted by the
Charter Conference is essential. A Contracting Party which is subject to
a ruling or recommendation of a final panel report that has been adopted
by the Charter Conference shall inform the Charter Conference of its
intentions regarding compliance with such ruling or recommendation.
In the event that immediate compliance is impracticable, the Contracting
Party concerned shall explain its reasons for non-compliance to the
Charter Conference and, in light of this explanation, shall have a reasonable
period of time to effect compliance. The aim of dispute resolution is the
modification or removal of inconsistent measures.

(5) (a) Where a Contracting Party has failed within a reasonable period of time
to comply with a ruling or recommendation of a final panel report that
has been adopted by the Charter Conference, a Contracting Party to the
dispute injured by such non-compliance may deliver to the non-complying
Contracting Party a written request that the non-complying Contracting
Party enter into negotiations with a view to agreeing upon mutually
acceptable compensation. If so requested the non-complying Contracting
Party shall promptly enter into such negotiations.

(b)If the non-complying Contracting Party refuses to negotiate, or if the
Contracting Parties have not reached agreement within 30 days after
delivery of the request for negotiations, the injured Contracting Party may
make a written request for authorization of the Charter Conference to
suspend obligations owed by it to the non-complying Contracting Party
under Article 5 or 29.

(c) The Charter Conference may authorize the injured Contracting Party to
suspend such of its obligations to the non-complying Contracting Party,
under provisions of Article 5 or 29 or under provisions of the GATT or
Related Instruments that apply under Article 29, as the injured Contracting
Party considers equivalent in the circumstances.

(d) The suspension of obligations shall be temporary and shall be applied only
until such time as the measure found to be inconsistent with Article 5 or 29
has been removed, or until a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.

(6) (a)Before suspending such obligations the injured Contracting Party shall
inform the non-complying Contracting Party of the nature and level of
its proposed suspension. If the non-complying Contracting Party delivers
to the Secretary-General a written objection to the level of suspension of
obligations proposed by the injured Contracting Party, the objection shall
be referred to arbitration as provided below. The proposed suspension of
obligations shall be stayed until the arbitration has been completed and
the determination of the arbitral panel has become final and binding in
accordance with subparagraph (e).

(b) The Secretary-General shall establish an arbitral panel in accordance with
subparagraphs (2)(d) to (f), which if practicable shall be the same panel
which made the ruling or recommendation referred to in subparagraph
(4)(d), to examine the level of obligations that the injured Contracting Party
proposes to suspend. Unless the Charter Conference decides otherwise the
rules of procedure for panel proceedings shall be adopted in accordance
with subparagraph (3)(a).

ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

(c) The arbitral panel shall determine whether the level of obligations proposed
to be suspended by the injured Contracting Party is excessive in relation
to the injury it experienced, and if so, to what extent. It shall not review
the nature of the obligations suspended, except insofar as this is inseparable
from the determination of the level of suspended obligations.

(d)The arbitral panel shall deliver its written determination to the injured
and the non-complying Contracting Parties and to the Secretariat within
60 days of the establishment of the panel or within such other period as
may be agreed by the injured and the non-complying Contracting Parties.
The Secretariat shall present the determination to the Charter Conference
at the earliest practicable opportunity, and no later than the meeting of the
Charter Conference following receipt of the determination.

(e) The determination of the arbitral panel shall become final and binding 30
days after the date of its presentation to the Charter Conference, and any
level of suspension of benefits allowed thereby may thereupon be put into
effect by the injured Contracting Party in such manner as that Contracting
Party considers equivalent in the circumstances, unless prior to the
expiration of the 30 days period the Charter Conference decides otherwise.

(f) In suspending any obligations to a non-complying Contracting Party, an
injured Contracting Party shall make every effort not to affect adversely the
trade of any other Contracting Party.

Each Contracting Party may designate two individuals who shall, in the case of
Contracting Parties which are also party to the GATT, if they are willing and
able to serve as panellists under this Annex, be panellists currently nominated
for the purpose of GATT dispute panels. The Secretary-General may also
designate, with the approval of the Charter Conference, not more than ten
individuals, who are willing and able to serve as panellists for purposes of
dispute resolution in accordance with paragraphs (2) to (4). The Charter
Conference may in addition decide to designate for the same purposes up to
20 individuals, who serve on dispute settlement rosters of other international
bodies, who are willing and able to serve as panellists. The names of all
of the individuals so designated shall constitute the dispute settlement
roster. Individuals shall be designated strictly on the basis of objectivity,
reliability and sound judgement and, to the greatest extent possible, shall have
expertise in international trade and energy matters, in particular as relates to
provisions applicable under Article 29. In fulfilling any function under this
Annex, designees shall not be affiliated with or take instructions from any
Contracting Party. Designees shall serve for renewable terms of five years and
until their successors have been designated. A designee whose term expires
shall continue to fulfil any function for which that individual has been chosen
under this Annex. In the case of death, resignation or incapacity of a designee,
the Contracting Party or the Secretary-General, whichever designated said
designee, shall have the right to designate another individual to serve for the
remainder of that designee’s term, the designation by the Secretary-General
being subject to approval of the Charter Conference.

Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this Annex, Contracting Parties
are encouraged to consult throughout the dispute resolution proceeding with a
view to settling their dispute.

The Charter Conference may appoint or designate other bodies or fora to
perform any of the functions delegated in this Annex to the Secretariat and the
Secretary-General.

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT AT ADOPTION SESSION
ON 17 DECEMBER 1994 ®

I would like to note that the Russian Federation believes that the reference to
international law in Article 10(1) is not intended to impose most favoured nation
obligations with regard to Making of Investments. This is clearly in accordance with
the intent of the negotiators who decided not to include in this first Treaty MFN
obligations for the pre-investment stage.

In addition, the Russian Federation has expressed the view that the consideration
of appropriate amendments to the Treaty pursuant to Article 30 affecting sectors
of services within the scope of this Treaty to which measures of the GATS apply,
and the negotiations towards the supplementary investment treaty provided for in
Article 10(4), should be conducted in such a manner as to assure mutual consistency
of the Treaty provisions arrived at. Here again, I am sure that all delegations would
fully endorse the need to achieve such consistency in the future incorporation in the
Treaty of the results of the Uruguay Round, and in negotiation of the second Treaty
for the pre-investment stage.

ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

Further, the Russian Federation has stated its view that, except where the Treaty
expressly indicates a contrary intention, no provision of this Treaty shall derogate
from the provisions of GATT 1947 as made applicable by Article 29(2), Annex G
and relevant Declarations. This again is clearly the intention of the negotiating
parties and a basis for the approach to trade contained in Article 29 of the Treaty.

Having followed the long and difficult discussions on the Freedom of Transfers, I
note that certain countries in transition have drawn attention to their interpretation
of Decision N° 3 which I think to be correct; the rights granted to Investors of other
Contracting Parties under paragraph 1(a) of Decision N° 3 do not preclude these
countries from applying, without derogating from paragraphs 1(b) and (c), (2),
(3) and (4) of that Decision, restrictions on movement of capital made by their
Investors

I have also noted the Russian delegation’s concerns on nuclear trade with the
European Communities. It is clear that as far as the Energy Charter Treaty is
concerned, nuclear trade will be governed by Article 29(2)(a), Annex G and the
joint declarations, concerning the implementation of the GATT rules by reference.
I take note of the fact that the Russian Federation and the EC have agreed that a
joint memorandum be annexed to the report of our session.

68 Editor's note: Annex | to document CONF 115 of 6 January 1995 (not published). This Statement was read out
by the Chairman to the final Plenary Session of the European Energy Charter Conference on 17 December 1994
at Lisbon and also circulated in written form. The Conference agreed without objection to this proposal for
resolving the outstanding interpretative issues.

Finally, I note that the representative of Norway supported by the representatives
of Armenia, Belarus, Estonia, European Communities and their Member States,
Finland, Iceland, Lithuania, Liechtenstein, Kazakhstan, Moldova, the Russian
Federation, Sweden, Switzerland and Ukraine have declared that the Treaty shall be
applied and interpreted in accordance with generally recognized rules and principles
of observance, application and interpretation of treaties as reflected in Part III of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 25 May 1969. In particular in the
context of Article 18(2) they recalled that a party may not invoke the provisions of
its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. The Treaty shall be
interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to
the terms of treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

JOINT MEMORANDUM OF THE DELEGATIONS OF
THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION AND THE EUROPEAN
COMMUNITIES ON NUCLEAR TRADE ®

The delegations of the Russian Federation and of the European Communities
have examined the situation of the nuclear trade between both Parties and they
acknowledged the following:

* The statement of the European Commission in the Joint Committee held on
1 and 2 December 1994 clearly indicates that “the European Commission
and the Euratom Supply Agency have never made it their policy to apply
quotas on imports of nuclear materials from Russia and do not intend to do
so in the future unless a situation should arise requiring safeguard measures
in accordance with Article 15 of the Agreement between the European
Economic Community, the European Atomic Energy Community and
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on Trade and Economic and
Commercial Co-operation signed in Brussels on 18 December 1989. This
means, a fortiori, that no quotas have been or will be applied on a utility by
utility basis”.

ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

« The relevant provisions of the Agreement on Partnership and Co-operation
establishing a partnership between the European Communities and their
Member States on the one part, and the Russian Federation on the other
part, signed in Corfu on 24 June 1994, on national treatment with respect
to nuclear materials imported from Russia are fully applicable.

» They acknowledge the intention expressed by the European Commission
to look at the way the Euratom Supply Agency is implementing its supply
policy, with a view to take full account of both Parties’ legitimate interests,
including inter alia the interest expressed by Russia in increasing the
volume of trade.

Representatives of the Commission and of the Russian Government will meet in the
near future in order to examine the difficulties encountered by Russian exporters of
nuclear materials.

GUIDE TO THE AMENDMENT
TO THE TRADE-RELATED PROVISIONS OF
THE ENERGY CHARTER TREATY

This Note outlines the elements of the Amendment agreed by the Conference in
April 1998 and where those elements are to be found in the text.

1.

The Amendment consists of the Final Act which contains three Understandings
and two Joint Declarations related to the Amendment; Annex 1 to the Final
Act is the Amendment itself which consists of seven Articles; Annex 2 to the
Final Act contains two Decisions.

Article 1 of the Amendment (Annex 1 to the Final Act) contains the text of
Article 29 (Interim Provisions on ‘Trade-Related Matters) to replace that of the
Energy Charter Treaty (ECT).

Article 2 contains other consequential amendments to the ECT (except the
amendments to Annexes D and G).

 

Article 3 contains amendments to Annex D of the ECT (trade-related dispute
settlement mechanism).

 

Article 4 contains the text of Annex W (application of provisions of the WTO
Agreement) to replace Annex G of the ECT.

 

Article 5 contains the new trade-related Annexes to be inserted in the ECT
Annexes EM II, EQ I, EQ I, BR and BRQ).

Article 6 is the provisional application provision of the Amendment.

Article 7 makes the Decisions an integral part of the ECT.

 

The Amendment expands the ECT trade regime to cover Energy-Related
Equipment. It replaces the outdated GATT 47 references and terms with the
relevant WTO references and terms. Furthermore, coherence in application of
WTO rules under the ECT and under the WTO is ensured (see e.g. Article
2, the new definition of WTO amending ECT Article 1(11), and Annex W,
paragraph (B)(10)).

The text of Article 29 provides for a best endeavours tariff commitment for
both Energy Materials and Products (Annex EM I) and Energy-Related
Equipment (Annex EQ I) (see paragraphs (4) and (5)).

This is complemented by the possibility to move to a future legally binding
commitment for agreed items which are presently subject to the best
endeavours commitment (see paragraphs (6) and (7)).

654707/2019
08/16/2019

TRADE AMENDEMENT

165

 

NYSCEF DOC. NO.

Accordingly, there is provision for moving items to the level of a legally
binding tariff commitment at a later date by a Conference decision requiring a
unanimous vote, without having to go through a formal amendment procedure.
That procedure is reflected in Article 2 through the amendment to ECT Article
34(3) (new subparagraph (0)) and Article 36(1) (new subparagraph (g)).

The present Annex EM of the ECT on Energy Materials and Products becomes
Annex EM I (see Article 2 renaming Annex EM). Energy-Related Equipment
is listed in the new Annex EQ I (see Article 5 of the Amendment). Energy-
Related Equipment is defined in the same manner as Energy Materials and
Products (see Article 2 of the Amendment inserting a new Article 1(4bis) in
the ECT). Items subject to a legally binding tariff commitment will be listed
in Annexes EM II and EQ U, both of which are empty until the Conference
decides otherwise. Annual reviews by the Conference on the possibility
of moving items to a legally binding commitment are provided for in
Understanding No. 3.

The Charter Conference, in deciding on moving items to the legally binding
standstill commitment, will also decide on the listing of countries in Annexes
BR/BRQ. This is provided for in paragraph (7) of Article 29 and in Article 2
of the Amendment including a new subparagraph (n) in ECT Article 34(3).
Understanding No. 2 deals with commitments by non-WTO countries listed
in Annexes BR and BRQ. Decision No. 1 provides an opting out procedure for
countries which are not applying the Amendment and which are not listed in
those Annexes when the Conference takes a decision to move items to a legally
binding tariff commitment.

Decision No. 2 provides that the Final Provisions of the Amendment shall be
based on Part VIII of the ECT so far as relevant. This concerns in particular
the entry into force of the Amendment (Article 42 of the ECT).

(B) Rules Governing the Application of Provisions of the WTO Agreement.

(1)In the absence of a relevant interpretation of the WTO Agreement adopted
by the Ministerial Conference or the General Council of the World Trade
Organization under paragraph 2 of article IX of the WTO Agreement
concerning provisions applicable under Article 29(2)(a), the Charter
Conference may adopt an interpretation.

(2) Requests for waivers under Article 29{2) and (6)(b) shall be submitted to
the Charter Conference, which shall follow, in carrying out these duties, the
procedures of paragraphs 3 and 4 of article IX of the WTO Agreement.

(3) Waivers of obligations in force in the WTO shall be considered in force for
the purposes of Article 29 while they remain in force in the WTO.

(4)The provisions of article I] of the GATT 1994 which have not been
disapplied shall, without prejudice to Article 29(4), (5) and (7), be modified
as follows:

(i) All Energy Materials and Products listed in Annex EM I] and Energy-
Related Equipment listed in Annex EQ II imported from or exported to
any other Contracting Party shall also be exempt from all other duties
or charges of any kind imposed on or in connection with importation
or exportation, in excess of those imposed on the date of the standstill
referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or under Article 29(7), or
those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed thereafter by
legislation in force in the importing or exporting territory on the date
referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence.

(ii) Nothing in article II of the GATT 1994 shall prevent any Contracting
Party from imposing at any time on the importation or exportation of
any product:

(a) a charge equivalent to an internal tax imposed consistently with

(b) any anti-dumping or countervailing duty applied consistently
with the provisions of article VI of GATT 1994;

(c) fees or other charges commensurate with the cost of services
rendered.

(iii) No Contracting Party shall alter its method of determining dutiable
value or of converting currencies so as to impair the value of the
standstill obligations provided for in Article 29(6) or (7).

(iv) If any Contracting Party establishes, maintains or authorises, formally
or in effect, a monopoly of the importation or exportation of any
Energy Material or Product listed in Annex EM II or in respect of
Energy-Related Equipment listed in EQ II, such monopoly shall
not operate so as to afford protection on the average in excess of the
amount of protection permitted by the standstill obligation provided
for in Article 29(6) or (7). The provisions of this paragraph shall
not limit the use by Contracting Parties of any form of assistance to
domestic producers permitted by other provisions of this Treaty.

(v)

=

If any Contracting Party considers that a product is not receiving from
another Contracting Party the treatment which the first Contracting
Party believes to have been contemplated by the standstill obligation
provided for in Article 29(6) or (7), it shall bring the matter directly
to the attention of the other Contracting Party. If the latter agrees that
the treatment contemplated was that claimed by the first Contracting
Party, but declares that such treatment cannot be accorded because a
court or other proper authority has ruled to the effect that the product
involved cannot be classified under the tariff laws of such Contracting
Party so as to permit the treatment contemplated in this Treaty, the
two Contracting Parties, together with any other Contracting Parties
substantially interested, shall enter promptly into further negotiations
with a view to a compensatory adjustment of the matter.

TRADE AMENDEMENT

(vi)(a) The specific duties and charges included in the Tariff Record

charges maintained by such Contracting Parties, are expressed in
the appropriate currency at the par value accepted or provisionally
recognized by the Fund at the date of the standstill referred to in
Article 29(6), first sentence, or under Article 29(7). Accordingly,
in case this par value is reduced consistently with the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund by more than
twenty per centum, such specific duties and charges and margins
of preference may be adjusted to take account of such reduction;

Provided that the Conference concurs that such adjustments will
not impair the value of the standstill obligation provided for in
Article 29(6) or (7) or elsewhere in this Treaty, due account being
taken of all factors which may influence the need for, or urgency
of, such adjustments.

(b) Similar provisions shall apply to any Contracting Party not a
member of the Fund, as from the date on which such Contracting
Party becomes a member of the Fund or enters into a special
exchange agreement in pursuance of Article XV of GATT 1994.

(vii) Each Contracting Party shall notify the Secretariat of the customs
duties and charges of any kind applicable on the date of the standstill
referred to in Article 29(6) first sentence. The Secretariat shall keep a
Tariff Record of the customs duties and charges of any kind relevant
for the purpose of the standstill on customs duties and charges of any
kind under Article 29(6) or (7).

(5) The Decision of 26 March 1980 on “Introduction of a Loose-Leaf System
for the Schedules of Tariff Concessions” (BISD 278/24) shall not be
applicable under Article 29(2)(a). The applicable provisions of the
Understanding on the Interpretation of Article II:1(b) of the GATT 1994
shall, without prejudice to Article 29(4), (5) or (7), apply with the following
modifications:

(i) In order to ensure transparency of the legal rights and obligations
deriving from paragraph 1(b) of article If of GATT 1994, the nature
and level of any “other duties or charges” levied on any Energy
Materials and Products listed in Annex EM II or Energy-Related
Equipment listed in Annex EQ II with respect to their importation or
exportation, as referred to in that provision, shall be recorded in the
Tariff Record at the levels applying at the date of the standstill referred
to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or under Article 29(7) respectively,
against the tariff item to which they apply. It is understood that such
recording does not change the legal character of “other duties or
charges”.

(ii) “Other duties or charges” shall be recorded in respect of all Energy
Materials and Products listed in Annex EM II and Energy-Related
Equipment listed in Annex EQ II.

(iii) It will be open to any Contracting Party to challenge the existence of
an “other duty or charge’, on the ground that no such “other duty or
charge” existed at the date of the standstill referred to in Article 29(6),
first sentence, or the relevant date under Article 29(7), for the item in

29(6) or (7), for a period of one year after the entry into force of the
Amendment to the trade-related provisions of this Treaty, adopted
by the Charter Conference on 24 April 1998, or one year after the
notification to the Secretariat of the level of customs duties and charges
of any kind referred to in Article 29(6), first sentence, or Article 29(7),
if that is the later.

(iv) The recording of “other duties or charges” in the Tariff Record is
without prejudice to their consistency with rights and obligations
under GATT 1994 other than those affected by sub-paragraph (iii)
above. All Contracting Parties retain the right to challenge, at any time,
the consistency of any “other duty or charge” with such obligations.

(v) “Other duties or charges” omitted from a notification to the Secretariat
shall not subsequently be added to it and any “other duty or charge”
recorded at a level lower than that prevailing on the applicable date
shall not be restored to that level unless such additions or changes are

made within six months of the notification to the Secretariat.

(6) Where the WTO Agreement refers to “duties inscribed in the Schedule” or
to “bound duties”, there shall be substituted “the level of customs duties

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
AT THE ADOPTION SESSION ON 24 APRIL 1998 *!

“On the issue of future listing of countries on Annexes BR and BRQ, I conclude that
all delegations are aware of the long standing positions of those delegations which
like Australia, Hungary and Japan have repeatedly underlined that they support
legally binding tariff commitments provided their commitments under the Energy
Charter Treaty reflect their commitments in the WTO. This also reflects the position
of other delegations, and there is a general acceptance among delegations that they
will give positive consideration to that position at the time when the decision on
legally binding tariff commitments is taken.”

read out by the Chairman to the Adoption Session on 24 April 1998 and also circulated in written form, This
Statement, which reflected the outcome of informal consultations, replaced a draft Declaration on the issue of
listing on Annexcs BR and BRQ, the text of which was consequently deleted from the text for adoption.

CHAIRMAN’S CONCLUSION ON
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TRADE-RELATED RULES,
AT THE ENERGY CHARTER CONFERENCE
ON 24 APRIL 1998 *

The Chairman concluded with respect to the future implementation of trade-related
rules that there was a consensus among delegations that the Secretariat was to be
invited to develop the elements for one implementation system based on the regime
in the Trade Amendment. In particular, where the Trade Amendment foresees
notification requirements and procedures, including with regard to Understanding
2 to the Amendment, they would follow WTO practice, provided that duplication
of notifications with the WTO did not occur. There was furthermore a consensus
that in developing dispute settlement rules and procedures WTO rules of procedure
and practice would be followed and the roster of panellists to be adopted by the
Conference would be drawn up in accordance with Article 3 of the Amendment.

Finally, whenever necessary to maintain the principle of harmonious
implementation of trade-related rules based on WTO practice, appropriate rules of
procedure should include the elements necessary to achieve that aim.

TITLE II
IMPLEMENTATION

In order to attain the objectives set out above, the signatories will, within the
framework of State sovereignty and sovereign rights over energy resources, take
co-ordinated action to achieve greater coherence of energy policies, which should
be based on the principle of non-discrimination and on market-oriented price
formation, taking due account of environmental concerns.

They underline that practical steps to define energy policies are necessary in order
to intensify co-operation in this sector and further stress the importance of regular
exchanges of views on action taken, taking full advantage of the experience of
existing international organisations and institutions in this field.

‘The signatories recognise that commercial forms of co-operation may need to be
complemented by intergovernmental co-operation, particularly in the area of
energy policy formulation and analysis as well as in areas which are essential and
not suitable to private capital funding.

They undertake to pursue the objectives of creating a broader European energy
market and enhancing the efficient functioning of the global energy market by joint
or co-ordinated action under the Charter in the following fields:

* access to and development of energy resources;

* access to markets;

liberalisation of trade in energy;
* promotion and protection of investments;

1. Access to and development of energy resources

Considering that efficient development of energy resources is a sine qua
non for attaining the objectives of the Charter, the signatories undertake to
facilitate access to and development of resources by the interested operators.
To this end, they will ensure that rules on the exploration, development and
acquisition of resources are publicly available and transparent; they recognise
the need to formulate such rules wherever this has not yet been done and to
take all necessary measures to co-ordinate their actions in this area.

With a view to facilitating the development and diversification of resources,
the signatories undertake to avoid imposing discriminatory rules on operators,
notably rules governing the ownership of resources, internal operation of
companies and taxation.

2. Access to Markets

The signatories will strongly promote access to local and international markets
for energy products for the implementation of the objectives of the Charter.
Such access to markets should take account of the need to facilitate the
operation of market forces, and promote competition.

3. Liberalisation of trade in energy

In order to develop and diversify trade in energy, the signatories undertake
progressively to remove the barriers to such trade with each other in energy
products, equipment and services in a manner consistent with the provisions
of GATT, its related instruments, and nuclear non-proliferation obligations
and undertakings.

The signatories recognise that transit of energy products through their
territories is essential for the liberalisation of trade in energy products. Transit
should take place in economic and environmentally sound conditions.

They stress the importance of the development of commercial international
energy transmission networks and their interconnection, with particular
reference to electricity and natural gas and with recognition of the relevance
of long-term commercial commitments. To this end, they will ensure the
compatibility of technical specifications governing the installation and
operation of such networks, notably as regards the stability of electricity
systems.

i BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE LEGAL DISPUTE

A. Italy’s Early Attempts to Encourage Investments in the Renewable
Energy Sector

6. Italy’s attention to renewable energy policy dates back to 1981, when Italy
developed its first comprehensive National Energy Plan, setting targets for the development
of renewable energy facilities across the country. A second National Energy Plan followed in
1988, which included further measures for the development of national renewable energy
sources. However, Italy only implemented the first concrete measures for the development of
renewable energy sources in 1991, during its electricity sector reforms. In particular, Law No.
9 of January 9, 1991, simplified the authorization procedure for the production of energy
from renewable sources, It required that Italy’s regional governments develop energy plans

prioritizing the production of energy from renewable sources.

7. In 1992, Italy established the first fixed feed-in tariff for renewable energy
production through its CIP6/92 regulation. That regulation allowed renewable energy
producers to produce electricity from renewable sources without any capacity limit and

iblished a i dure based on kilowatt-hours of electricity produced. The
CIP6/92 regulation also provided some certainty to investors because it obligated ENEL
S.p.A., Italy’s state-owned electricity company, to buy all electricity produced from
renewable energy sources. By 1997. 16% of Italy’s electricity was being produced from

renewable energy sources.

8. Ttaly to i in its developi energy
sector by enacting Legislative Decree No. 79 on March 16, 1999. Known as the Bersani
Decree, that act encouraged electricity production from renewable energy sources by
prioritizing their access to the grid. The Bersani Decree also obligated generators and
importers of electricity from non-renewable sources beyond a certain threshold to inject a
portion of electricity from renewable sources into the grid. To satisfy that obligation, the non-
renewable generators or importers could purchase a corresponding amount of renewable
energy from other producers or from the GSE, or they could purchase “green certificates”

from third parties.

9. The foregoing measures were relatively “soft” in that they demonstrated
Italy’s interest 10 promote investment in renewable energy, but they did not contain
commitments that would induce large numbers of intemational investors to enter Italy's

renewable energy market.

B. Italy Implemented Conto Energia Decrees to Induce Significant
Investments in Photovoltaic Plants

10. With the turn of the century, policies to promote renewable energy like those
already existing in Italy became a priority, particularly among the European Union states. On
September 27, 2001, the European Parliament and the Council enacted Directive 2001/77/EC,
promoting electricity produced from renewable cnergy sources in the internal electricity
market. That directive set national targets for each member state for renewable energy
production in light of the EU’s stated objective of having 22.1% of total Community
electricity consumption generated from renewable energy sources by 2010. Italy was
expected to produce 25% of its total electricity consumption from renewable energy sources
by 2010,

11, Because the cost of producing electricity from renewable sources was
substantially higher than the cost of producing clectricity from fossil fucls, to meet its target,
Italy needed to implement measures and above-market incentives that would further develop

and encourage investments in its renewable energy sector. Thus, on December 29, 2003, Italy

+ Directive 2001/77/EC was subsequently replaced by Directive 2009/28/EC, which aims to achieve a 20%
share of energy from rencwable sources in the Community's gross final consumption of cnergy by 2020. It
requires that Member States report on planned or existing measures put in place to meet those targets. It
also requires Member States to adopt indicative targets for the following 10 years. For Italy, the target is for
17% of overall energy consumption to come from renewable energy sources by 2020.

NEWCXORE

enacted Legislative Decree No. 387, the goal of which was to “promote a greater contribution
from renewable energy sources to the production of electricity in the Italian and European
markets.” In broad strokes, Legislative Decree No. 387 set out measures to encourage
investment in each type of renewable energy source. For example, Article 7, which addressed
solar power, stated that Italy would implement incentive tariffs to encourage investments in
photovoltaic facilities. Accordingly, from 2005 to 2012, Italy enacted attractive incentive
schemes for photovoltaic plants known as Conto Energia Decrees (“Contos”). Through
successive Contos, Italy guaranteed incentive tariffs to eligible photovoltaic plants that would

supplement the revenues generated from the sale of electricity to the Italian national erid$

12. Each Conto set forth a range of incentive tariffs to be granted to eligible
renewable energy producers. Italy designed the regime to ensure that the producers received
the incentive tariff (or premium) offered in the Conto in addition to the market price of
electricity produced and sold to the grid. The value of the applicable tariff varied based on
criteria specific to each of the Contos, including the size, location, and the date of connection
to the grid of the photovoltaic plant under consideration. Once Italy granted a particular tariff
to an eligible photovoltaic facility pursuant to the applicable provision of the Conto in force
at the time, the facility was entitled to that tariff for 20 years. The Contos did not contain any
provision allowing subsequent amendment of the tariff rate granted to an eligible

photovoltaic facility.

13. Each Conto stated that the incentive tariffs it offered would remain available
to photovoltaic plants until a fixed date or until the market reached a specific installed
capacity or expenditure cap. Once the date, installed capacity, or expenditure cap was
reached, the incentives under that particular Con/o were no longer available to new facilities.
New photovoltaic plants could benefit from the tariffs offered in a subsequent Conto

program, provided that they met its eligibility requirements.

14. On July 28, 2005, Italy — through its Ministry of Productive Activities —
enacted Conto I. Conto I granted incentive tariffs for a 20-year period to photovoltaic plants
with a nominal capacity between 1 kW and 1,000 kW. Italy originally intended to maintain

the incentive scheme under Conto I until installed capacity reached 100 MW; however, on

This is truc of the first four Contos relevant to this arbitration, as described herein.

February 6, 2006, the Ministry of Productive Activities enacted a decree amending Conto I

and increasing the threshold to a maximum installed capacity of 500 MW.

15. Italy further promoted investment in renewable energy with the enactment of
Conto Il on February 19, 2007. Conto II granted incentive tariffs for a 20-year period to
photovoltaic plants with a nominal capacity equal to or higher than 1 kW. The incentive
scheme under Conto Il applied to ail eligible photovoltaic plants that were connected to the
grid between April 13, 2007 and December 31, 2010, or until installed capacity reached
1,200 MW, whichever occurred first. Installed capacity reached the 1,200 MW threshold in
the summer of 2010. Nevertheless, Italy extended Convo Il to any eligible photovoltaic plant
connected to the grid before June 30, 2011, provided the plant itself was built by December
31, 2010.°

16. Soon after the capacity target under Conto II was reached in the summer of
2010, on August 6, 2010, Italy enacted Confo II] to further encourage investment in
photovoltaic facilities. Conto Ill offered incentive tariffs for a 20-year period to photovoltaic
plants with a nominal capacity equal to or higher than 1 kW. The incentive scheme under
Conio Ul applied to all eligible photovoltaic plants that were connected to the grid between
January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2013, or until installed capacity reached 3,000 MW,

whichever occurred first.”

17. Italy inued to im in the pl ltaic sector by

 

enacting Conto IV on May 5, 2011. Conto IV granted incentive tariffs for a 20-year period to
photovoltaic plants with a nominal capacity equal to or higher than 1 kW. The incentive
scheme under Convo IV applied to all eligible photovoltaic plants that entered into operation
starting from June 1, 2011, until December 31, 2016. Italy replaced Conto IV with new

legislation — Conto V — during the summer of 2012.8

18. The Contos proved successful in encouraging substantial investment in
photovoltaic plants and rapidly increasing the installed capacity of those plants in {laly. For

illustration, the production of electricity from solar energy in Italy amounted to 193 gigawatt-

On March 3, 2011, however, Italy enacted Legislative Decree No. 28/2011 limiting the application of Conro
IL to photovoltaic plants that were connected to the grid by May 31, 2011.

hours (GWh) in 2008. That figure increased to 676 GWh in 2009 and to 1,906 GWh in 2010.
By 2011, it had skyrocketed to 10,730 GWh.

19. For each photovoltaic plant accepted into the regime, Italy further confirmed
its commitment to the incentive tariffs granted under the different Contos in an agreement
between the soggetto responsabile (i.e., the company or person that held the project rights to
the plant) and the Gestore dei Servizi Energetici (“GSE”), the state-owned company

ible for the impl ion of ible electricity i i under the

direction and control of the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (“convenzione per il

riconoscimento delle tariffe incentivanti” or “GSE Agreement”),”

20. ‘To enter into a GSE Agreement and thus benefit from a particular Conto, the
soggetto responsabile had to file an incentive tariff request (“richiesta di accesso agli
incentivi”) with the GSE after its photovoltaic plant was connected to the grid, along with
specific supporting documentation. Once the GSE confirmed that the photovoltaic plant met
the necessary prerequisites to benefit from a particular Conto, the GSE and the soggerto
responsabile executed the GSE Agreement, which was then published on the GSE’s website.
If the soggeto responsabile’s application to the GSE was timely and correctly filed, the
incentive tariff granted under the specific Conto applied to the facility as from the date it was

connected to the grid.

 

21. The GSE A identified the particular Conto and it ive tariff
granted to a specific photovoltaic plant and confirmed that the plant was entitled to receive
that tariff for 20 years. The GSE Agreements did not contain any legal provision authorizing
the GSE or any other Italian state entity to unilaterally amend or abrogate the incentive tariff

granted thereunder.

photovoltaic sector as a result of those incentives. Italy’s commitments under the Conto

the GSE to enter into these GSE agreements,

and ponding GSE Agt were i ly crucial to CEF’s decision to
invest, in part because the substantial upfront cost of constructing and developing a
photovoltaic facility is generally only recovered several years after a plant begins operating.
Thus, the 20-year commitment in the Contos and GSE Agreements ensured the future
profitability of the plants. CEF expected Italy to abide by its promises to maintain the fixed
tariffs for 20 years, as well as to further promote investments in photovoltaic facilities as set

forth in the legislation described above.

23. In January 2010, CEF first invested in Italy by acquiring Sunholding S.r.1.
(“Sunholding”). Sunholding owned Megasol S.r.1., a company that held all project rights to a
photovoltaic plant of approximately 13 MW located in Montalto di Castro in the Lazio region
(“Megasol”). The Megasol photovoltaic plant was connected to the grid in May 2011 and
received an incentive tariff of 0.346€/kWh under Conto II, as confirmed by a GSE
Agreement dated November 2, 2011.

 

24. d by Italy’s inued p ion of ible energy in’
with its enactment of Conto Il, in December 2010, CEF acquired a 70% controlling stake in
Phenix S.r.l., a company that held all project rights to a photovoltaic plant of approximately
24 MW located in Canino in the Lazio region (“Sugarella”). The Sugarella photovoltaic plant
was connected to the grid in April 2011 and was entitled to an incentive tariff of 0.297€/kWh
under Conto III, as confirmed by a GSE Agreement dated November 23, 2011.

25. Italy’s enactment of Conto IV on May 5, 2011, further assured CEF that Italy
remained serious about its commitments to support investments in the photovoltaic industry.
Thus, in December 2011, CEF acquired Enersol S.r.l., a company that held all project rights
to a multi-section photovoltaic plant of approximately 48 MW located in Canaro in the
Veneto region (“Enersol”). The Enersol photovoltaic plant was partitioned in seven sections.
Section 1 of the plant was connected to the grid in April 2011, and was entitled to an
incentive tariff of 0.297€/kWh under Conto LI, as confirmed by a GSE Agreement dated
November 2, 2011. Sections 2 and 3 of the plant were connected to the grid in July 2011, and
were entitled to an incentive tariff of 0.251€/kWh under Conto IV, as confirmed by two
separate GSE Agreements (one per Section) dated March 2, 2012. Sections 4 to 7 of the
plant were connected to the grid in August 2011, and were entitled to an incentive tariff of

0.238€/kWh under Conto IV, as confirmed by four separate GSE Agreements (one per

 

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 6

 

Section) dated January 11, 2012 (for Sections 5 and 7), February 6, 2012 (for Section 4), and
March 2, 2012 (for Section 6).

26. In reliance on Italy's commitments to promote a thriving renewable energy
sector and to maintain the incentive tariffs granted under the respective Contos and confirmed
in the GSE agreements, CEF invested approximately € 100 million in the above-mentioned

plants.

D. Italy Imposed Unexpected, Arbitrary Costs on Investors That
Undermined the Incentive Schemes

27. After having induced CEF to invest in its photovoltaic sector and while
continuing to benefit from the resulting increase in renewable energy investments, Italy
enacted a series of measures that imposed additional, arbitrary costs on CEF’s investments, in
violation of the commitments Italy had made guaranteeing incentive tariffs and pricing.
Those measures also created an environment of legal and regulatory uncertainty that severely
depressed Italy’s once-burgeoning photovoltaic market. The measures, discussed below,

violate the ECT and international law and directly harmed CEF’s investments.

28. On July 5, 2012, Italy’s Ministry of Economic Development enacted a decree
requiring all renewable energy producers benefiting from any Conto to pay, as of January I,
2013, an administrative fee cormesponding to € 0.0005 per kW of incentivized energy.'° The
fee, which is offset against the incentive tariffs granted under the Contos and guaranteed by
the GSE Agreements, reduced the payments that CEF expected to receive pursuant to the

Contos governing its facilities.

29, Furthermore, also on July 5, 2012, the Autorita per | energia elettrica, il gas e
il sistema idrico (“AEEG"), an entity responsible for regulating the electricity market, passed
Resolution 281 requiring renewable energy producers to pay so-called “imbalance costs” as
of January 1, 2013. The “imbalance costs” stemmed from a history of Italy requiring non-
renewable energy producers to provide advance projections to the grid manager of the
quantity of electricity they would deliver to the grid, in order to create predictable supply and
assist the grid manager in balancing supply and demand. If a producer missed its projections,
it was required to rectify the imbalance by paying certain costs based on the difference
between the producer’s projections and the energy it delivered.

30. Historically, and when CEF decided to invest in the sector, Italy exempted
renewable energy producers from paying “imbalance costs.” Since the “imbalance costs”
only applied to non-renewable energy producers, when CEF invested in its photovoltaic
plants in Italy, it reasonably expected that those costs would not apply to its plants.
Resolution 281, however, unexpectedly and arbitrarily extended those costs to CEF and other

renewable energy producers.

31. The Italian courts later annulled Resolution 281 because it unlawfully failed to

between and energy prod: as well as between

different types of ble energy prod garding the i ion of “i

costs.” On October 23, 2014, in an attempt to address the deficiencies of Resolution 281, the
AEEG passed Resolution 522, which again required renewable energy producers, including
CEF, to pay “imbalance costs” starting from January 1, 2015. That Resolution also
undermined CEF’s expectation that these costs would not apply to their plants when it

invested in Italy. It too violates the ECT and international law.

32. In addition to Resolutions 281 and 522, Italy enacted other legislation that
imposed d costs on ible energy prod including CEF. In 2008, Italy had
enacted a windfall tax on the profits of energy companies with an annual gross income of
over € 25 million, the so-called “Robin Hood” tax. The rationale behind the tax was to use
the profits that oil companies and other energy groups were earning from record oil and
energy prices to fund aid for low-income households that had been hard-hit by high energy
and food prices. As no such windfall profits befell renewable energy producers, Italy
expressly excluded renewable energy producers from the scope of the Robin Hood tax. Thus,
when CEF invested in the Italian photovoltaic plants, it reasonably expected that its plants

would nol be subjected to the tax.

33. However, in 2011, Italy unexpectedly and arbitrarily broadened the scope of
the Robin Hood tax by extending it to all energy producers, including renewable energy
producers, with a gross annual income of over € 10 million and taxable income of over € 1
million.'' In 2013, Italy again extended the scope of the Robin Hood tax by reducing the

applicable income thresholds to gross annual income over € 3 million and taxable income

"See Law Decree No, 138/2011 of August 13, 2011, converted into law by Law No. 148 of September 14,
2011.

 

over € 300,000.'" That measure resulted in the application of the Robin Hood tax to CEF’s
facilities. The Robin Hood tax directly reduced the profits and revenues that CEF reasonably
expected to receive on the basis of the incentive remuneration guaranteed under the Contos
and GSE Agreements. The tax rate was 10.5% for 2013 and 6.5% for 2014.

34. On February 9, 2015, the Italian Constitutional Court declared the Robin Hood
tax unconstitutional. However, the Court also ruled that its decision would not have
retroactive effect. This means that Italy will not reimburse CEF for the sums wrongfully paid
under the Robin Hood tax legislation, despite its violation of the ECT and international law
and despite Italy's own acknowledgement that the tax violated Italian law. On April 28, 2015,
Italy confirmed by way of Circular No. 18/E that it required investors to pay all amounts
purportedly owed pursuant to the Robin Hood tax for the 2014 fiscal year.

35. __ Italy implemented a further measure harming CEF’s investments on December
19, 2013. The Italian tax authorities issued Circular No. 36/E, which changed the rules for the
depreciation of capital investments in photovoltaic plants. Prior to Circular No. 36/E,
photovoltaic plants were classified as movable property and subject to a depreciation rate of
up to 5% per year. Circular No. 36/E, however, reclassified photovoltaic plants as immovable
property for tax purposes, which reduced the applicable depreciation rate for photovoltaic
plants to a maximum of 4% per year. Because a higher depreciation rate results in lower
taxable income, the decrease of the applicable depreciation rate pursuant to Circular No. 36/E
increased the taxable income of photovoltaic plant owners. Moreover, Italy’s reclassification
of photovoltaic plants as immovable property made them more likely to be subjected to the
IMU (imposta municipale propria) and TASI (tassa sui servizi) taxes. Each of these measures
has harmed CEF’s investments by unexpectedly and arbitrarily increasing CEF’s costs, and
thus decreasing the revenues that CEF reasonably expected it would be receiving pursuant to
Italy’s guarantees under the relevant Contos and GSE Agreements.

36. In addition, on December 27, 2013, Italy declared a need to establish a
capacity market in its electricity system and enacted Law No. 147 (the so-called Legge di
Stabilité 2014)." In electricity capacity markets, electricity producers receive compensation

See Law Decree No. 69/2013 of June 21, 2013, converted into law by Law No. 98 of August 9, 2013.

See Law Decree No. 147/2013 of December 27, 2013. On March 10, 2015, the AEEG issued Resolution
No. 95/2015 proposing that the capacity market be implemented by 2017, with the first auctions taking
place in September 2015,

for selling capacity, i.e., the power that they will provide in the future. The implementation of
a capacity market in Italy’s electricity system is meant to ensure that the grid operator, Terna
S.p.A., always has a sufficient amount of available electricity to cover demand. The Legge di
Stabilité 2014 indicated that the compensation that would be paid to electricity producers for
selling their capacity on the capacity market would not result in an increase of the electricity
price for end consumers. Although the manner in which this compensation will be funded
remains unclear, it is likely that some costs will be borne by renewable energy producers like

CEF. Any such costs would further damage CEF’s investments.

37. Each of the measures described above, separately and in combination,
constitutes a violation of the ECT and international law. By enacting these measures, Italy
igfilly repudiated the

to the Contos and the GSE A Italy burdened energy p'

 

ding the i ive tariffs that it had made pursuant

 

including CEF, with unexpected, arbitrary costs that significantly reduced the profits and
revenues that CEF reasonably expected to receive on the basis of the incentive remuneration
guaranteed under the Contos and GSE Agreements. As discussed below, however, these were

not Italy’s only breaches of the ECT.

E. Italy Wrongfully Abrogated the Conto Incentive Schemes

38. The foregoing retroactive alterations to the legal and economic regime
governing photovoltaic plants in Italy caused significant damage to CEF’s investments,
principally by reducing the revenues that CEF reasonably expected when it decided to invest
in Italy. Italy further violated the ECT through the enactment of Law Decree No. 91/2014 on
June 24, 2014 (“LD 91/2014”), which was converted into law by Law No. 116 of August 11,
2014,

39. LD 91/2014 abolished (as of January 1, 2015) the incentive tariffs guaranteed
for a 20-year period under the five Contos and the GSE Agreements for photovoltaic plants
with a nominal capacity above 200 kW. LD 91/2014 replaced the incentive tariffs with new
tariffs that are calculated pursuant to one of three mechanisms {Options A, B and C), each of

which provides materially less compensation than the incentive tariffs guaranteed in the

 

Contos and GSE A Italy i d owners and of ph ic plants to
select their preferred option by November 30, 2014. If no choice was made, Option C would

40. Under Option A, the new tariff is paid over twenty-four years (starting from
the date when the photovoltaic plant was connected to the grid), rather than the twenty-year
period guaranteed in the Confos and the GSE Agreements. However, Option A also reduces
the tariff by a percentage that depends on when the plant began benefiting from it. For
example, if the plant is entitled to twelve more years of incentive tariffs (having benefited
from them for the past eight years), then the tariff is reduced by 25%. If the plant is entitled to
eighteen more years of incentive tariffs (having benefited from them for the past two years),
then the tariff is reduced by 18%.

amount, however, is reduced between 2015 and 2019 by a percentage that depends on when
the photovoltaic plant began benefiting from the incentive tariffs. It is then increased during
an equivalent number of years toward the end of the twenty-year period. Although the new
increased tariff in later years superficially appears to offset the new decreased tariff in the
earlier years, the changes are likely to result in a reduction of the total value of the tariff
because: (i) the lower tariff applies in the early life of the projects when plants are more
productive; and (ii) a delay in receiving the expected tariff will result in losses due to the time

value of money.

42. Under Option C, the new tariff is still paid over a twenty-year period, but it is
reduced for the duration of that period by a fixed percentage depending on the photovoltaic
plant’s nominal capacity. For plants with a nominal capacity higher than 900 kW, the

incentive tariff is reduced by 8%.

43. Faced with those three unpalatable choices and the threat of automatically
defaulting to Option C if no choice were made, CEF directed its Italian investment companies
to send protest letters to the GSE regarding each of its plants. The Italian investment
companies sent those letters in November 2014, noting that Italy was applying Option C to

the plants over CEF’s objections and in violation of its contractual and legal rights.

44. In addition to the abrogation of the incentive tariffs guaranteed under the
Contos and the GSE Agreements — and their wholesale replacement by highly reduced tariffs
pursuant to one of three options — LD 91/2014 amended the payment modalities of the tariffs.
Before LD 91/2014 was enacted, the remuneration that a soggetto responsabile received was

based on data indicating the photovoltaic plant’s production and was paid at the end of every

pge 399, Of Alm. 654707/2019

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 6 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

 

month. Under the new law, the new tariffs are paid by monthly installments amounting to
90% of the estimated yearly average production of electricity. The payment of the remaining
10% is postponed for six to eighteen months, resulting in adverse impacts to investment cash

flows.

45. LD 91/2014 also imposed additional annual “fees” on renewable energy
producers that purportedly cover the GSE’s expenses for management of the new tariff
scheme,'* despite the fact that the GSE Agreements do not provide for such fees. One such
fee applies to any photovoltaic plant benefiting from incentive tariffs under the Contos and
ranges from € 1.20 to € 2.20 per kW, depending on the specific plant’s nominal! capacity.
Another fee — known as the RID fee — applies to all renewable energy sources. For solar
energy producers, the RID fee ranges from € 0.60 to €0.70 per kW, depending on the
specific photovoltaic plant’s nominal capacity, with a maximum cap of € 10,000 per year per
plant. These new fees ostensibly replace the administrative fee that Italy introduced in 2012,

referred to above.’

46. Italy’s enactment of LD 91/2014 has severely harmed CEF’s investments.
Italy abrogated the incentive tariffs that it originally ensured would apply to CEF’s plants for
20 years pursuant to the Contos and the GSE Agreements, and Italy replaced them with new,

severely reduced tariffs.

FE Italy Continues to Aggravate the Dispute

47. As discussed in Section II.F, below, CEF wrote in July and October 2014 to
notify Italy that the measures discussed above, which reduced the revenues and profits
guaranteed to its photovoltaic plants, constituted a legal dispute for purposes of the ECT.
CEF requested an opportunity to resolve the dispute amicably and requested that Italy take no
further measures to aggravate the dispute. Despite those letters, Italy has continued to impose

harmful measures on renewable energy producers, including CEF.

48. On May 1, 2015, the GSE published technical rules (“regole tecniche per il

mantenimento degli incentivi”) regulating the impact of certain modifications or

 

“interventions” on ‘ing plants and providing a general obligation to i those

modifications or interventions to the GSE, Under these new regulations, even the most

‘3 See Ministerial Decree of December 24, 2014, implementing Art. 25 of LD 91/2014.
'S See supra 428.

 

routine modifications — such as a simple refurbishing to maximize efficiency- must be
communicated to the GSE. Furthermore, if any type of intervention on a plant results in
increased efficiency, the technical rules unlawfully purport to cap the incentives that would
otherwise apply to the increased production levels. For example, if such a “modified” plant
has been receiving incentivized remuneration for three or more calendar years before it is
deemed to have increased efficiency and production, the cap that the GSE will impose will be
equal to the maximum quantity of energy generated in any one year during the three years
prior to the modification, plus 2%. If the “modified” plant has been receiving incentivized
remuneration for less than three calendar years, then the cap will be calculated on the basis of

estimates provided by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development.

49, The May 1, 2015, GSE rules also listed a variety of potential modifications
that the GSE may or may not permit under certain conditions. Those include, for example, the
relocation of a plant, a change in the connection point to the grid, and the replacement of
spare parts. If an investor is found to have made modifications that the GSE deems material
to the facilities’ original technical characteristics, the GSE could sanction that investor,
including by revoking the investor’s right to incentivized tariffs and requiring the investor to

return incentive tariffs previously paid by the GSE.

50. _Italy’s latest measure, in addition to aggravating the existing dispute with
CEF, is manifestly unreasonable, arbitrary, and constitutes an additional breach of the ECT.
The technical regulations threaten to harm CEF’s investments in Italy by unexpectedly
decreasing — and possibly eliminating — the revenues CEF reasonably expected pursuant to
the Italian legislative framework, which formed the basis for its investments. The GSE's
technical regulations have already triggered confusion and complaints in the market

regarding their unreasonableness, arbitrariness, and lack of clarity.

51. CEF is not in a position to determine the precise impact that this measure,
which is currently under review, will have on its investments, in part because the GSE
suspended the effectiveness of the technical regulations on July 9, 2015. Nevertheless, CEF
reserves its rights to claim for the harm caused by that measure and any other aggravating

measures that Italy may take during the course of this proceeding.

52. ‘In summary, Italy’s abrogation of the incentive tariffs, combined with its past
and continued imposition of arbitrary costs and unfair regulations, have severely damaged
CEF’s investments. CEF seeks relief through arbitration under the ECT for the harm that

Italy’s conduct has caused, and continues to cause, to its investments.

Ill. THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO SETTLE THIS DISPUTE THROUGH
SCC ARBITRATION

53. Article 26 of the ECT grants CEF the right to submit this dispute to
international arbitration at the Arbitration Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

Article 26 states:

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area of
the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the
former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which
either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

{a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party to
the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting Party
hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute
to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with the
provisions of this Article.

(b) (i) The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such
unconditional consent where the Investor has previously submitted the
dispute under subparagraph (2) (a) or (Baas

(c) A Contracting Party listed in Annex IA does not give such
unconditional consent with respect to a dispute arising under the last
sentence of Article 10(1).'”

‘© Italy is listed under Annex ID. However, CEF has not previously submitted this dispute to the courts or
administrative tribunals of Italy or in accordance with any previously agreed dispute settlement procedure.
Consequently, Anicle 26(3)(b}(i) is irrelevant for purposes of this arbitration.

 

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 6

 

(4) In the event that an Investor chooses to submit the dispute for
resolution under subparagraph (2) (c), the Investor shall further
provide its consent in writing for the dispute to be submitted to:

(c) an arbitral proceeding under the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce. ...

(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and
principles of international law,
54. The requirements under Article 26 of the ECT may be summarized as follows:
a) the dispute must concern a breach of Part III of the ECT; b) the dispute must involve a
covered “investment;” c) the Respondent must be a Contracting Party to the ECT; and d) the
opposing party must be a covered “investor” that is a national or company of another

Contracting Party to the ECT. Each of these requirements is satisfied in the present case,

A. This is a Dispute Concerning a Breach of Part III of the ECT

55. As explained in Section II above, this dispute concerns Italy’s failure to fulfill
legislative, regulatory, and contractual commitments it made in relation to CEF and its
investments in photovoltaic plants. The acts and omissions of Italy described above and to be
developed further in the course of this proceeding constitute serious and repeated breaches of
the protections accorded to CEF’s investments in Italy under Part II] of the ECT. Those
protections include, but are not limited to, the obligations of Italy found in Articles 10 and 13
of the ECT.

56. Article 10 provides a number of guarantees and protections to CEF and its
investments, including: 1) a requirement that Italy treat CEF’s investments fairly and
equitably; 2) a requirement that Italy grant “the most constant protection and security” to
CEF’s investments; 3) a prohibition against unreasonable or discriminatory measures that
impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment, or disposal of investments; 4) a
prohibition against treatment less favorable than that required by international law, including
treaty obligations; and 5) a requirement to observe any obligations that Ialy entered into with
an investment or an investor. By way of example only, Italy treated CEF’s investments

unfairly and inequitably by altering, and then abrogating, the incentive schemes governing

 

‘7 Italy is not listed under Annex IA. Consequently, CEF is entitled to assert a claim based on the last

sentence of Article 10(1). the ECT’s “umbrella clause.” which it docs.

those investments, in violation of its commitments and the clear terms of the different Contos
and the GSE Agreements. Italy’s misconduct in that respect also unlawfully impaired CEF’s
investments in an unreasonable or discriminatory manner and violated the obligations Italy

entered into with respect to CEF’s investments.

57. Additionally, Article 13 of the ECT prohibits Italy from unlawfully
expropriating CEF’s i or subjecting them to having an equivalent effect.
As CEF will demonstrate during the course of the arbitration proceeding, Italy breached
Article 13 of the ECT by abrogating the rights granted to CEF’s investments pursuant to
Conto Ml, Conto Il, Conto TV, and the GSE Agreements. Since those rights, granted by law
and enshrined in contract, formed part of CEF’s investments in this case, Italy’s repudiation
of those rights constitutes a measure tantamount to expropriation, if not a direct

expropriation, under the ECT and international law.

B. The ECT Covers CEF’s Investments

58. The ECT provides a broad definition of the term “investment.” As stated in
ECT Article 1(6),

“Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled
directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:

(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property,
and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and
pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other
forms of equity participation in a company or business enterprise,
and bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to
contract having an economic value and associated with an
Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;

(e) Returns;

(® any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any
licences and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any

Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.

A change in the form in which assets are invested does not affect
their character as investments and the term “Investment” includes

all investments, whether existing at or made after the later of the
date of entry into force of this Treaty for the Contracting Party of
the Investor making the investment and that for the Contracting
Party in the Area of which the investment is made (hereinafter
referred to as the “Effective Date”) provided that the Treaty shall
only apply to matters affecting such investments after the Effective
Date.

“Investment” refers to any investment associated with an
Economic Activity in the Energy Sector.

59, Under this definition, and as discussed in Section II, above, a number of
different investments of CEF have been harmed in this case, including but not limited to: (i)
CEF’s ownership of tangible and intangible property and property rights; (ii) CEF’s
ownership of shares and equity participation in Italian companies and business enterprises, as
well as debt obligations; (iii) CEF’s right to returns and claims to money; (iv) rights
conferred to CEF by law, such as the rights to fixed incentive tariffs conferred under Conto
Il, Conto Ill, Conto TV; and (v) rights conferred by contracts, licenses, and permits, such as
the contractual rights conferred in the GSE Agreements.

60. CEF thus owns several covered “investments” under the ECT that have been

damaged by Italy.

Cc. Respondent is a Contracting Party to the ECT

61. Italy is a Contracting Party to the ECT. Italy signed the ECT on December 17,
1994, and ratified it on December 5, 1997. Italy deposited its instrument of ratification on
December 16, 1997. The ECT entered into force for Italy on April 16, 1998,"

D. CEF is a Covered Investor and a National of a Contracting Party to the
ECT

62. Article 1(7) of the ECT defines “investor” as “a company or other

organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that Contracting Party.”

"© See excerpts from Energy Charter website, CEX-5. CEF notes that Italy reportedly has given notice of its

intention to withdraw from the Energy Charter Treaty and that such withdrawal is scheduled to take effect
in January 2016. While CEF has been unable to confirm the validity of Italy’s reported withdrawal, it notes
that any such withdrawal does not affect the protection of CEF’s investments or the jurisdiction of the
Arbitral Tribunal under the ECT. CEF further notes that the ECT remains in force for Italy for a period of
twenty years,

page 405,afetli. 654707/2019

NYSCEF DOC. NO. 6 RECEIVED NYSCEF: 08/16/2019

 

63. CEF is a company duly established under the laws of the Kingdom of the
Netherlands. The Netherlands is a Contracting Party to the ECT. It signed the ECT on
December 17, 1994, and ratified it on December 11, 1997. The Netherlands deposited its
instrument of ratification on December 16, 1997. The ECT entered into force for the
Netherlands on April 16, 1998.'° Thus, CEF is a covered investor and a national of a

Contracting Party to the ECT.

E. The Parties Have Consented to Arbitration

64. Italy consented to arbitration under the ECT by signing and ratifying the
treaty. As noted above, the ECT entered into force for Italy on April 16, 1998.

65.  CEF consented to arbitrate this dispute pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT
through two letters dated July 7, 2014, and October 20, 2014.°° CEF hereby confirms its
consent to arbitration under the ECT and elect to submit this dispute to the Arbitration
Institute of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce in accordance with Article 26(4)(c) of the
ECT.

FE. CEF Attempted to Settle This Dispute Amicably

66. Before submitting a dispute to arbitration, Article 26 of the ECT states that
disputing parties should, if possible, attempt to settle their disputes amicably. On July 7,
2014, CEF sent a letter to Italy notifying it of this dispute and offering to settle the dispute
amicably. CEF sent a second letter to the same effect on October 20, 2014. Italy has not
responded to CEF’s offers to pursue a settlement, and no resolution of the present dispute has

been achieved.

67. Article 26 of the ECT permits an Investor to submit its dispute to arbitration
under the ECT if the parties have not resolved their dispute after a three month period. As
more than three months have passed since CEF attempted to settle this dispute amicably with
Italy, CEF is entitled to submit this Request for Arbitration to the Arbitration Institute of the

Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

IV. PROCEDURAL MATTERS

68. Pursuant to Articles 12 and 13 of the SCC Arbitration Rules, and in view of

the size and complexity of this case, the Arbitral Tribunal should consist of three arbitrators.

69. CEF hereby appoints Prof. Dr. Klaus Sachs, a national of Germany, as its
party-appointed arbitrator for this proceeding. His contact information is:

70. With respect to the selection of the Chairman of the Arbitral Tribunal, in
accordance with Article 13(1) of the SCC Arbitration Rules, CEF proposes that the Chairman
be selected by the two party-appointed arbitrators, with agreement of the parties. If Italy fails
to appoint an arbitrator or if the two party-appointed arbitrators are unable to agree upon a
Chairman, the SCC Board should make the necessary appointment(s) as provided in Article
13(3) of the SCC Arbitration Rules.

71. CEF chooses English as the procedural language for the arbitration and

proposes Geneva, Switzerland, as the seat of the arbitration.

72. This Request is submitted by e-mail. CEF is transferring an amount of € 2,000
corresponding to the registration fee to the Arbitration Institute and will provide confirmation
of that transfer in the coming days.

Vv. PRELIMINARY REQUEST FOR RELIEF

73; Pursuant to Article 2(iii) of the SCC Arbitration Rules, CEF requests an award

granting it the relief set forth below:
(a) a declaration that the dispute is within the jurisdiction of the ECT;
(b) a declaration that Italy has violated Part ITI of the ECT, including but not

limited to Article 10 and Article 13, as well as international law with
respect to CEF’s investments;
