INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Treaty Between the
United States of America and the Republic of Kazakhstan Concerning the Encouragement
and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, which entered into force on January 12, 1994 (the
“BIT” or “Treaty”) and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between
States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on October 14, 1966 (the
“ICSID Convention”). The United States has been a party to the ICSID Convention since
October 14, 1966, the Republic of Kazakhstan since October 21, 2000.

The claimant is Big Sky Energy Corporation (“Big Sky”, “Big Sky US”, or the

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 11 of 184

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On June 19, 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated the same date from Big

Sky Energy Corporation against the Republic of Kazakhstan (the “Request”).

On July 7, 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance with
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an
arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of

Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each Party and the presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the

two co-arbitrators.

On November 27, 2017, the Claimant requested that the Chairman of the ICSID
Administrative Council (the “Chairman’”) appoint the arbitrator not yet appointed and
designate him or her to be the President of the Tribunal in this case, pursuant to Article 38

of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Arbitration Rule 4.

In accordance with these provisions, ICSID shall use its best efforts to comply with this
request within 30 days. ICSID conducted a ballot to assist the Parties in selecting a mutually

agreeable presiding arbitrator.

The Tribunal was composed of Dr. Michael Moser, a national of the Republic of Austria,
President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Professor Stanimir A. Alexandrov, a
national of the Republic of Bulgaria, appointed by the Claimant; and Professor Rolf

Knieper, a national of the Federal Republic of Germany, appointed by the Respondent.

On January 29, 2018, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the

Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was

010

therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Alex B. Kaplan, ICSID Legal

Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On January 30, 2018, the Claimant filed its Request for the Disqualification of Arbitrator
Professor Rolf Knieper, with Exhibits 1 through 33 (“Request for Disqualification”). The

proceeding was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(6).

On February 26, 2018, the Respondent filed its Reply to the Claimant’s Request for the
Disqualification of Arbitrator Professor Rolf Knieper, with Exhibits DA R-001 through
DA R-026.

On February 27, 2018, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(1), the Secretary-General
informed the Parties that Dr. Michael Moser had resigned as the presiding arbitrator “due
to certain unforeseen conflicts which have arisen” since his appointment. In accordance
with ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2), the proceeding remained suspended until the vacancy

resulting from Dr. Moser’s resignation had been filled.

On March 26, 2018, ICSID informed the Parties of its intention to propose to the Chairman
the appointment of Professor Bernardo M. Cremades, a national of the Kingdom of Spain,
as the presiding arbitrator. Without objection from the Parties, the Chairman proceeded to

seek Professor Cremades’ acceptance of the appointment.

On April 4, 2018, ICSID informed the Parties that Professor Cremades had accepted his
appointment to serve as the presiding arbitrator in this case, and the vacancy created on the

Tribunal following the resignation of Dr. Moser had been filled.

On April 9, 2018, Professor Knieper furnished explanations regarding the Request for
Disqualification in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3).

On April 19, 2018, the Claimant filed its Further Observations on its Request for
Disqualification of Arbitrator Professor Rolf Knieper, with Exhibits 34 and 35.

On May 3, 2018, Arbitrators Professor Bernardo M. Cremades and Professor Stanimir A.

Alexandrov issued their Decision on Request for Disqualification of Professor Rolf

Knieper. In accordance with the Decision, Professor Rolf Knieper was disqualified and the

proceeding remained suspended pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 10(2).

On June 15, 2018, Judge Peter Tomka, a national of the Slovak Republic, accepted his
appointment as arbitrator, appointed by the Respondent in accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rule 11(1). The proceeding was resumed pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule
12.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the

Parties on July 13, 2018 by teleconference.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

This section summarizes the factual background of the dispute that gave rise to this
arbitration. It does not purport to be exhaustive and is meant to provide a general overview

of the key facts and factual allegations to put the Tribunal’s analysis in proper context.

As further developed below, there is a general level of agreement between the Parties
regarding the general timeline of the Claimant’s investment in Kazakhstan and about the
underlying factual background to this investment (Section A.). The Parties however
disagree on the handling of the court proceedings relating to the corporate agreements
concluded by a company owned by the Claimant in order to undertake its operations in

Kazakhstan (Section B.).

GENERAL FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The dispute relates to the Claimant’s investment in KoZhan LLP (“Kozhan”), a Kazakh
company that owned since 2003 licenses to explore, develop and exploit a number of oil

fields in western Kazakhstan.

The present section focuses on (i) the main actors to the factual matrix underlying this
dispute, (ii) the background to the Claimant’s investment in Kazakhstan, (iii) the general
timeline of the court proceedings (although the exact content of the court proceedings is
addressed in more detail below), and (iv) the factual events that occurred after the

proceedings and the sale of Kozhan to third parties.

(dd) Main Actors

The Annex to the Claimant’s Reply contains a dramatis personae for this case.’ The Annex

refers to 74 natural persons and 16 legal entities. Not all these persons or entities are

directly relevant to the Tribunal’s analysis of the facts of this case and, as a result, they do
not need to be all presented here. The following developments address only the main actors

that the Tribunal considers to be directly relevant to the factual background of the dispute.

a. Big Sky Energy Corporation

Big Sky Energy Corporation, or Big Sky (also referred to as “Big Sky US” by the
Respondent, and on occasions by the Claimant as well), the Claimant, is a company that
was incorporated in Nevada, USA, on February 9, 1993. It was originally named “Institute
for Counselling INC”, and after several name changes throughout its history, its name was
ultimately changed to Big Sky Energy Corporation on December 9, 2004.* Mr. Matthew
Heysel was the Chairman of the Board of Directors from April 2000 to June 2009, and
CEO of the Claimant from April 2000 to March 2005.° The present Sole Director of Big
Sky is Mr. Scott Lawler.

Mr. Heysel incorporated Big Sky Energy Kazakhstan (“BSEK”) in July 2003 as a special
purpose vehicle to be owned by the Claimant, with expectations that the Claimant would
acquire and fund Kozhan, further to BSEK’s acquisition of the rights to exploit the oil

fields from Kozhan.!°

The Claimant claims to have contributed in non-pecuniary ways to the development of

Kozhan through providing international oil industry management expertise and know-

how.!!

b. BSEK

BSEK (also referred to as “Big Sky Canada” by the Respondent) is a company that was
incorporated under the laws of Alberta, Canada, on July 29, 2003.'? BSEK is presented as

being wholly owned by the Claimant.

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 24 of 184

On August 11, 2003, BSEK concluded a Sale and Purchase Agreement (the “2003 SPA”)
with five Kazakh nationals who owned Kozhan at that time (the “Original Owners”).'*
Pursuant to this SPA, BSEK acquired 90% of the Original Owners’ collective interest in
Kozhan.'° BSEK further signed the 2005 Sale and Purchase Agreement (“2005 SPA”) with
the Original Owners, pursuant to which it acquired the remaining 10% collective interest

in Kozhan.'¢

Further to the conclusion of the 2003 SPA, BSEK entered into loan agreements with
Kozhan in order to finance, among other things, the fees that were associated with the
acquisition of the licenses and which had to be paid to the Kazakhstan Ministry of Energy
and Mineral Resources (“MEMR”),!’ and Kozhan’s operating costs.'® These loan
agreements included a loan agreement dated October 17, 2003,'° a line of credit agreement
dated December 1, 2003,”° and a line of credit agreement dated December 14, 2004. The
December 14, 2004 loan agreement (the “2004 Line of Credit Agreement”) was amended
a number of times between 2004 and 2006, resulting in the increase of the credit to USD

50 million.?!

As further developed below, the dispute in this Arbitration concerns the conduct and
consequences of various court proceedings relating to the validity of the 2003 SPA and the
2005 SPA, including a legal action initiated by the spouses of the Original Owners. BSEK
was respondent in the action filed by the Original Owners’ spouses (see infra).?? BSEK
also filed criminal complaints against the Original Owners and their spouses to the General

Prosecutor, Chief Finance Police and Chief of Agency on Internal Affairs for Fraud.?*

Also in dispute is the conduct of the Kazakh courts in the proceeding resulting from
BSEK’s attempt to recover from Kozhan a part of the funds loaned under the 2004 Line of

Credit Agreement.”*

c. KoZhan LLP (Kozhan)

Kozhan is a limited liability partnership established on April 28, 2001 under the laws of

Kazakhstan and founded by five Kazakh nationals (i.e. the Original Owners — see infra).

Shortly after its establishment, Kozhan successfully acquired rights from the MEMR in
relation to the exploration, development, and exploitation of three oil fields in Western
Kazakhstan — the Morskoye, Karatal and Dauletaly fields (the “Oil Fields”) — through the

conclusion of three subsoil use contracts with the MEMR (the “Subsoil Use Contracts”).”°

Kozhan was also a party to two agreements signed with the Kazakh construction company
ABT Ltd. LLP — the “2004 ABT Agreement” and “the 2004 Transfer Agreement.”
Under these agreements, ABT undertook to perform construction works and to finance
certain drilling works required on the Morskoye oil field.?” In return, Kozhan transferred
45% of the rights to explore and exploit the Morskoye field to ABT.** Kozhan also
executed the 2006 ABT Agreement with the Claimant and ABT Ltd. LLP (the “2006 ABT
Agreement”), which replaced the 2004 agreements, wherein it undertook to make certain

payments and repay loans to ABT.”°

d. The Original Owners and their Spouses

August 11, 2003, BSEK concluded a Sale and Purchase Agreement with the Original
Owners.*? The SPA was signed by Mr. Mukashev on behalf of all the Original Owners,
and Mr. Yang, BSEK’s president at the time.*?

In August and September 2006, four of the Original Owners’ spouses initiated legal actions
against BSEK, requesting the court to invalidate the 2003 SPA on the ground that they had
not provided their notarized consent to their spouses selling their interest in Kozhan. These
were Ms. Roza Gumarovna Faskhutdinova, spouse of Mr. Mukashev, Ms. Radina
Faskhutdinova, spouse of Mr. Faskhutdinov, Ms. Zhanat Faizullayeva, spouse of
Mr. Kaschapov and Mr. Shyngskhan Seidagaliev, spouse of Ms. Asanova.** While the fifth
spouse (Ms. Bayansulu Teleugalievna Tulegenova, spouse of Mr. Kadyr Baikenov) did not
initiate a claim against BSEK at the same time as the other four spouses in August-

September 2006, she later joined the proceedings.*°

Several of the Original Owners were also involved in separate legal proceedings that are
relevant to this Arbitration, including claims relating to other agreements concluded further

to the acquisition of Kozhan by BSEK.*°

e. The Kazakhstan Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (the MEMR)

The MEMR is the Respondent’s central executive body responsible for the regulation of
oil operations and oil products in Kazakhstan. The MEMR carries out the function of
forming and implementing national policy relating to oil and gas and of coordinating the

management process of oil and gas projects in the country.*”

On February 17, 2003, the MEMR signed three Subsoil Use Contracts with Kozhan for the
exploration and production of hydrocarbons at the Oil Fields.** Pertinent to the case’s
background are also several orders that the MEMR issued further to the conclusion of the
Subsoil Use Contracts, including the suspension order dated March 18, 2005, the

termination order of October 5, 2005, and the reinstatement order of January 18, 2006.*?

Sf The Kazakh Courts

This Arbitration relates to the conduct of judicial proceedings concerning the corporate
agreements concluded between BSEK and Kozhan for the use of the rights to exploit the
oil fields. The proceedings relevant to this case occurred before several organs of the
Kazakh judicial system, including (i) the Bostandyk District Court, (ii) the Court of Appeal
of the Almaty City Court, (iii) the Supervisory Collegium of the Almaty City Court, and
(iv) the Supervisory Collegium of the Kazakh Supreme Court.

g. ABT

ABT Ltd. LLP (“ABT”) is a Kazakh construction company.*? ABT concluded two
agreements with Kozhan in 2004: the 2004 ABT Agreement and the 2004 Transfer

Agreement. These two agreements aimed to finance and build infrastructure required for
the operation of one of the Oil Fields.*! These agreements were terminated in 2006 and
replaced with the 2006 ABT Agreement.*? Under the 2006 ABT Agreement, Kozhan
agreed to (i) repay the loan provided by ABT to Kozhan under the 2004 ABT Agreement,
(ii) pay for the construction works performed by ABT, (iii) pay a sum of money in
consideration for ABT’s waiver of its right to the 45% interest in the Morskoye Oil Field.
Big Sky, for its part, undertook to transfer a 9.7% stake of its share ownership to ABT.“4
This transfer further resulted in a loan agreement between Big Sky and Kozhan, whereby
Kozhan would become indebted towards the Claimant for the amount corresponding to the

value of the stake transferred from Big Sky to ABT (the “2006 Loan Agreement”).*°

As further explained below, in 2008, two of the Original Owners filed a claim before the
District Court against Big Sky, BSEK, ABT and Kozhan seeking the invalidation of the
2004 and 2006 ABT Agreements.*° ABT filed a counterclaim, seeking to invalidate the
2006 ABT Agreement on the ground that it was misled as to the values of the share it had
acquired from Big Sky. The proceeding resulted in Big Sky owing a judgment debt of
approximately USD 27 million to ABT.*”

h. The “Three Oligarchs”

According to the Claimant, the proceedings against BSEK by the Original Owners and
their spouses were part of an illicit scheme orchestrated by three influential Kazakh

individuals. These individuals (referred to as the “Three Oligarchs” by the Claimant) are:

i. The Office of the General Prosecutor and the National Security Committee

In Kazakhstan, one of the functions of public prosecutors is to supervise the accurate and
uniform application of laws in civil proceedings on behalf of the State.*° Public prosecutors
may therefore play a role in appellate proceedings by filing a “protest” in respect of any

court decision they consider wrong in law.

As further explained below, the Office of the General Prosecutor became involved in the
SPA proceedings, by exercising its statutory power to suspend the execution of decisions
issued by Kazakh courts, after BSEK unsuccessfully appealed these decisions.°! The Office
of the General Prosecutor also filed a protest to the Collegium of the Supreme Court of

Kazakhstan seeking to reverse some of the decisions issued in the SPA proceedings.

Further, the Office of the General Prosecutor opened a criminal investigation against the
Original Owners and their spouses in 2008 in response to BSEK’s complaints and referred

the matter to the National Security Committee for preliminary investigation.

The National Security Committee is a special State body under the direct authority of the
President of Kazakhstan tasked with overseeing issues related to national security,

intelligence coordination and defense strategy.°*

The National Security Committee started investigating the criminal complaint filed by
BSEK against the original owners after the file was transmitted to it by the Office of the
General Prosecutor. The National Security Committee issued a ruling that the criminal case

should be closed due to the absence of the element of crime.°>

je Mr. Ogai

Mr. Ogai was, at the relevant time, Head of Department at the General Prosecutor’s Office
and was the person in charge of the investigation against the Original Owners in response

to BSEK’s complaints.

Along with its Rejoinder, the Respondent produced five exhibits (R-179 to R-183) that
allegedly constituted the “complete criminal files” from the investigations carried out by
the Office of the General Prosecutor and the National Security Committee (the “Criminal
Files”).©’ According to the Claimant, the exhibits produced by the Respondent were
incomplete. The Claimant therefore wrote to the Respondent on February 7, 2020 inviting
it to produce the complete record of the Criminal Files.°* The Respondent refused to
produce additional documents and, as a result, the Claimant requested on February 23,
2020 an order from the Tribunal requiring the Respondent to produce the complete record
of the Criminal Files and to call Mr. Ogai as a witness in this arbitration for examination
at the Hearing (or another appropriate person if Mr. Ogai was not available) “to testify as
to the Respondent’s knowledge of, and complicity in, the [iJllicit [s]cheme that led to the
taking of the Claimant’s investment in Kozhan.”® By letter of February 27, 2020, the
Tribunal decided to order the Respondent to produce the evidence allegedly missing from
the Criminal Files, and that, if this evidence could not be produced, the Tribunal would call

Mr. Ogai as a witness in the Hearing.””

By letter of April 3, 2020 the Tribunal decided that Mr. Ogai would appear as a witness

called by the Tribunal in the Hearing and established the conditions for his testimony.”!

Mr. Ogai was present at the Hearing and testified pursuant to the conditions established by

the Tribunal in consultation with the Parties.

(2) Background to the Claimant’s Investment in Kazakhstan

The dispute finds its origin in the Claimant’s acquisition in 2003 of Kozhan, a Kazakh
company which held the rights to explore, develop and exploit the three Oil Fields in

western Kazakhstan.”

Kozhan had acquired these rights after a successful bidding campaign which started in
2001 and which successfully ended in 2003 with the conclusion of three subsoil use
contracts with the MEMR for the exploration and production of hydrocarbons at the Oil
Fields (i.e., the Subsoil Use Contracts).’? Pursuant to the Subsoil Use Contracts, Kozhan
obtained explorations right, for an initial period of six years, and production rights for an
initial period of 25 years.’* In exchange, the Contracts contained a series of financial
obligations for Kozhan, including: the payment of signature bonuses to the MEMR totaling
USD 1 million;’> the obligation to invest several tens of millions of dollars (for each
contract) for the exploration and production of the Oil Fields throughout the duration of

the contracts;”° and financial participation in social programs in the region.””

The chronology of the Claimant’s acquisition of Kozhan is described in Mr. Heysel’s first
witness statement.’* In brief, according to Mr. Heysel and the Claimant, neither the
Original Owners nor Kozhan had the financial capacity to fulfil the obligations contained
in the Subsoil Use Contracts and therefore needed external financial support. Mr. Heysel
was approached by Kozhan shortly after the Contracts were signed and, after an initial
review of these Contracts and of geological and technical data relating to the Oil Fields, he

started to look for potential funders in order to secure the financing that would be required

The Parties do not agree on the exact amount of these required investments. The Claimant refers to a total
investment of USD 69 million, while the Respondent refers to required expenditures of USD 5.1 million
during the exploration period and a total expenditure of USD 40 million over the life of the contract. See

to invest in Kozhan.” Mr. Heysel approached Big Sky and received a positive response.
He incorporated BSEK in July 2003 “as a special purpose vehicle to be owned by Big Sky
us.”*°

Following completion of due diligence work, on August 11, 2003, BSEK entered into the
2003 SPA with the Original Owners. Pursuant to this SPA, BSEK acquired 90% of the
Original Owners’ collective interest in Kozhan. In exchange, BSEK undertook to allow
Kozhan to honor its commitments with the MEMR by sharing expenses associated with
Kozhan’s operations in direct proportion to owned interest, by “assist[ing] with western
style expertise of management,” and by providing assistance for the purchase of the

western equipment required for Kozhan’s operations.*!

After the conclusion of the SPA, on January 12, 2004, Big Sky acquired BSEK and thus

became an indirect owner of the 90% interest in the capital of Kozhan.*

The Parties’ respective accounts of the factual narrative start to substantially differ after
the conclusion of the SPA. According to the Claimant, Big Sky made substantial financial
contribution and other contributions to Kozhan following the 2003 SPA.* These
contributions allowed Kozhan to commence exploration development and exploitation of
the Oil Fields in 2004.** As part of the Claimant’s investment strategy, Kozhan entered
into the 2004 ABT Agreement and the 2004 Transfer Agreement with ABT.** It acquired
the Original Owners’ remaining 10% interest in Kozhan via the 2005 SPA,*° and continued
to explore, develop and exploit the Oil Fields.*” The Claimant explains that the termination

of the 2004 ABT Agreement and the 2004 Transfer Agreement and their replacement with

the 2006 ABT Agreement was planned.** According to the Claimant, Kozhan’s growing
success drew the attention of the Original Owners, who decided to establish a plan or “illicit

scheme” to take back Kozhan from BSEK.*°

The Respondent tells a different story, insisting on the difficulties that the Claimant faced
in the early years of its management of Kozhan.”° According to the Respondent, under the
Claimant’s management, Kozhan failed to honor its commitments under the Subsoil Use
Contracts and, as a result, the MEMR suspended these Contracts and later terminated two
of these Contracts.°! Because of the Claimant’s mismanagement and lack of resources,
Kozhan was constrained to accumulate substantial debt and was running the risk that the
other Subsoil Use Contracts would not be extended beyond their initial 6 year exploration

period, and that these Contracts would, in fact, be terminated.°”

(3) The Court Proceedings

At the heart of this Arbitration are the outcomes of four court proceedings relating to
several of the instruments concluded by the Claimant for the purpose of its investment in
Kazakhstan. Each of these four proceedings followed a relatively complex chronology,
with several decisions issued by courts at different levels, some of them being interrelated,
some of them being upheld, and others being reversed.°? These four proceedings are
discussed at length below. The purpose of the present section is simply to draw the basic

chronology of these four proceedings.

The first_proceedings (the “2003 SPA Proceedings”) concern the claim filed by the
Original Owners’ spouses in August and September 2006 with the Bostandyk District
Court seeking the invalidation of the 2003 SPA on the ground that the Original Owners

had not obtained notarized spousal consent to sell jointly owned marital property, as

required under Kazakh Matrimony Law.” This proceeding culminated with a ruling of the
Kazakh Supreme Court on January 30, 2008 that had the result of invalidating the 2003
SPA.

The second proceedings (the “2008 ABT Proceedings”) concerned a claim filed in 2008
by two of the Original Owners before the District Court against Big Sky, BSEK, ABT, and
Kozhan, for the invalidation of the 2004 and 2006 ABT Agreements.” This second
proceeding resulted in a judgment from the Bostandyk District Court dated September 15,
2008 (the “2008 ABT Decision”). The 2008 ABT Decision invalidated the 2004 and 2006
ABT Agreements and ordered the Claimant to reimburse approximately USD 27 million

to ABT and approximately USD 2.5 million to Kozhan.””

The third proceedings (the “2009 Set-Off Proceedings”) concerned an action filed further
to the issuance of the 2008 ABT Decision. On October 6, 2008, ABT and Kozhan entered
into a settlement agreement where ABT assigned to Kozhan the USD 27 million judgment
debt payable by the Claimant.°* As a consequence, Big Sky owed the total sum of
USD 29,626,053 to Kozhan. On November 14, 2008, Kozhan applied to the bailiff to
enforce the Court-ordered debt.” Due to the alleged difficulty of enforcing this debt against
any of the Claimant’s assets, the bailiff applied to the District Court for an order to change
the method and order of execution of the judgment debt to permit execution against
BSEK’s 10% remaining interest in the charter capital of Kozhan.'° On July 1, 2009, the
District Court granted the bailiff’s application and ordered the partial execution of the
judgment debt against BSEK’s 10% interest in Kozhan, which had been valued at
USD 163,867 (the “2009 Set-Off Ruling”).!°!

The fourth and last proceeding (the “IUS Award and 2012 Set-Off Proceedings”)
concerned the actions that BSEK took in order to recover the approximately USD 30.7
million owned under the 2004 Line of Credit Agreement.'°* On May 8, 2008, BSEK filed
aclaim against Kozhan at the IUS International Arbitration Court, pursuant to the relevant
provisions of the Credit Agreement. On November 7, 2008, the IUS tribunal issued an
award ordering Kozhan to reimburse BSEK approximately USD 30.1 million (the “IUS
Award”).! On March 13, 2012, while BSEK was trying to enforce this judgment, Kozhan
filed a petition seeking to offset the remaining balance of the partially-satisfied judgment
debt resulting from the 2008 ABT Proceedings.'"* On April 10, 2012, the District Court
granted the bailiff’s petition and ordered the set-off of the judgment debt against the IUS
Award (the “2012 Set-Off Ruling”). !°

(4) The Sale of Kozhan after the Court Proceedings

As a result of the proceedings, the ownership of Kozhan was transferred back to the
Original Owners. !°°

Further to a two-tier transaction, which occurred on December 9, 2009 and January 6, 2010,
the Original Owners sold their entire 100% shareholding in Kozhan to IMR, a Dutch
company, allegedly owned by the “Three Oligarchs”.!°7

From January 2010, IMR fully owned and controlled Kozhan. During that time, Kozhan
continued to produce oil and reinvested most of the surplus cash generated in capital

expenditure. !°*

On August 12, 2015, IMR sold its 100% interest in Kozhan to Geo-Jade Petroleum
Corporation (“Geo-Jade”), a Chinese company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange,

THE PARTIES’ FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS SPECIFIC TO THE KAZAKH COURT
PROCEEDINGS

The Parties disagree as to whether these proceedings complied with Kazakh procedural law
and whether the courts correctly applied Kazakh law, which are matters that relate to the
very merits of this case. This section presents the Parties’ respective main factual

descriptions of and arguments concerning these proceedings.

(dd) The Claimant’s Position

The Claimant submits that the Kazakh courts committed several serious violations of
procedural and substantive law, especially by not addressing critical arguments, by not

stating their reasoning, and by omitting to give proper notice to all parties. !!°

a. The 2003 SPA Proceedings

The Claimant submits that the Kazakh courts arbitrarily invalidated the 2003 SPA in order

to return Kozhan to its Original Owners without compensation.

In August 2006, four of the five spouses of the Original Owners filed claims against BSEK,
their spouses, the Kazakh Ministry of Justice (the “MOJ”) and the notary that had validated
the SPA before the Bostandyk District Court.''' In short, the spouses sought to challenge
the validity of the 2003 SPA on the basis that they never declared their notarized consent

to the selling of the Original Owners’ shares.'!* They therefore requested the invalidation

of the 2003 SPA and the cancellation of the registration of Kozhan as an entity owned by
BSEK.!3

The main ground for this action was the Kazakh domestic Law on Marriage and Family
(“Kazakh Matrimony Law” — Exh. C-127) (and, in particular, its Article 33), which
provides that the disposal of marital property requires, under certain circumstances, spousal
consent.'!* According to the Claimant, however, under Kazakh law, the spouse’s consent
is presumed unless (i) the spouse positively disagreed, and (ii) the third party knew or
should have known of this disagreement.''> The Claimant submits that none of these

exceptions applied and the spouses’ action should have been dismissed on that basis.!!°

On September 12, 2006, the District Court ordered the seizure of 36% of the interest in the
charter capital of Kozhan as a security for the outcome of the proceedings and further
prohibited a re-registration of Kozhan so that BSEK would be hindered in selling its

interests. !!7
On September 13, 2006, Kozhan was joined to the proceedings as a third party.!!®

On October 17, 2006, the spouses further asked the Court to invalidate the power of
attorney which was granted to Mr. Mukashev by the other Original Owners to execute the

SPA on their behalf.!'?

On October 23, 2006 the District Court ordered an additional seizure of 36% in the charter

capital of Kozhan as a security on the outcome of the proceedings. !?°

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 40 of 184

The Claimant considers it to be obvious that the spouses and the Original Owners had
conspired together and that the spouses knew about the 2003 SPA at the time of its
conclusion; or that they had this knowledge at least since the 2005 SPA.!?!

The Claimant further submits that BSEK, Kozhan, the notary of the 2003 SPA and the
MOJ all raised defences before the District Court arguing that (i) the spouses’ claims were
time-barred, (ii) the spouses’ claims were not supported by any evidence, (iii) the spouses’
consent was to be presumed, (iv) no notarial spousal consent was required and BSEK and
Kozhan did not have knowledge of the lack of consent, and (v) the 2003 SPA was

concluded in accordance with the laws of Kazakhstan. !77

The Claimant further argues that the conspiracy between the spouses and the Original
Owners is shown by the statements which Messrs. Faskhutdinov and Mukashev (two of
the Original Owners) submitted in favor of their spouses even though — according to the
Claimant — these statements were largely deceptive.'”° In fact, the Claimant contends that
Mr. Mukashev’s statement in the preliminary hearings in October 2006 was incorrect and

misleading. '**

The Claimant submits that Mr. Mukashev was the “mastermind” behind the court
proceedings and that he mainly sought a settlement of an enormous amount of money.!7°
In fact, on numerous occasions, the proceedings were adjourned in order to allow a
potential amicable settlement.'2° The Claimant argues that Mr. Mukashev and
Mr. Faskhutdinov already thought at the time about re-transferring Kozhan to third parties,
and in particular to the Three Oligarchs.'?” According to the Claimant, the settlement

negotiations failed. !7

After a hearing on November 22, 2006, the District Court dismissed the spouses’ claims
by stating that the transaction did not require a notarized spousal consent, that the spouses
did not prove the requirement of knowledge of BSEK and that the 2003 SPA was in
accordance with Kazakh law.'?? Additionally, the Claimant points out that the District

Court considered the claims to be time-barred. '°°

On December 11, 2006 the spouses filed an appeal against the District Court’s decision, '*!
arguing that the findings of the District Court on the merits of the case were wrong, and
that, with respect to the proceeding, the fifth spouse was deprived of her right to participate

in the case.!*?

The Court of Appeal overruled the District Court’s decision on February 6, 2007.
According to the Claimant, this decision was flawed in many ways, and especially because
it entirely failed to address BSEK’s arguments against the appeal.'*? Based on the
conclusion of Professor Abzhanov,'*+ the Claimant also argues specifically that the Court
of Appeal violated Kazakh law by prejudging the merits of the case when referring it back

to the District Court. !°5

On February 19, 2007, BSEK lodged an appeal against the Court of Appeal’s decision to
the Supervisory Collegium of the Almaty City Court.!°° The Supervisory Collegium
summarily rejected the appeal.'*’ According to the Claimant, this decision was also flawed
in a number of respects, and in particular because the Supervisory Collegium allegedly

failed to state reasons. !8

The District Court asked the fifth spouse, Ms. Tulegenova, to submit her claim

independently because she was not an original claimant. 4°

The Claimant argues that BSEK again argued that the spouses’ claims should be dismissed
and that Ms. Tulegenova’s claim as “third party having an independent claim to the subject
matter of the dispute” was not admissible.'4! The District Court nevertheless accepted its
jurisdiction over this third party claim.'#” The Claimant contends that the District Court did
not allow Mr. Baikenov, who was a defendant according to the fifth spouse’s claim, to
appear as a witness even though the Court of Appeals had allegedly instructed the District

Court to do so.'3

On the merits, the District Court ultimately declared the 2003 SPA invalid, i.e., it upheld
the spouses’ claims by following the Court of Appeal’s reasoning that a voluntary
notarization of the SPA led to the requirement of a notarized consent of the spouses. '## The

Claimant considers that this decision had no basis in Kazakh law. 45

The Claimant submits that BSEK did not receive a copy of the District Court’s decision in
time to file an appeal, so that it first filed an appeal based merely on its general knowledge
of the decision and, once BSEK had received a copy of the decision after the deadline for
the filing of an appeal, an amended appeal.'4°

The Court of Appeal proceeded to review the case, and eventually concurred with the

District Court and therefore dismissed the appeal. '*7

The Claimant further submits that Kazakh law allows an appeal through a public prosecutor
and that it fell back on this possibility.'4* The General Prosecutor granted BSEK a
suspension of the District Court’s decision.'4? At BSEK’s request, the Almaty City
Prosecutor lodged a protest at the Supervisory Collegium.'*° The Supervisory Collegium

rejected the protest and confirmed the lower courts’ decisions. '*!

The General Prosecutor still suspended the District Court’s decision and called on the

Kazakh Supreme Court to decide on the issue.'**

Whilst the appeal proceedings were pending before the Court of Appeal, BSEK filed
several complaints for fraud against the Original Owners and their spouses which led the
General Prosecutor to open criminal cases. '**

In January 2008, two spouses and the respective Original Owners (Ms. Asanova and Mr.
Seidagaliev, and Mr. Baikenov and Ms. Tulegenova) issued a statement that they withdrew
every claim made against BSEK.'*+ The Claimant considers this as evidence that Mr.

Mukashev had orchestrated the spouses’ claims. '°°

Despite the withdrawal of two of the spouses claims and alleged irregularities and legal
flaws in the District Court’s and Court of Appeal’s decisions invalidating the 2003 SPA,

the Supreme Court upheld these decisions on January 30, 2008.'*°

The Claimant contends that the Supreme Court’s decision was legally flawed and that this

can be deduced from a later and contradictory decision of the Supreme Court in which it

did not require a spousal consent for the sale of a participation in a limited liability
partnership but presumed such consent. !*”

The Claimant submits that, shortly after the decision by the Supreme Court, the criminal
investigations were abandoned, due to an alleged absence of criminal elements, and the
decision against BSEK was enforced. !** The Claimant submits that this conduct was, again,

in violation of Kazakh law.!°°

b. The 2008 ABT Proceedings

The Claimant argues that the District Court fabricated a debt which the Claimant allegedly
owed to Kozhan as a part of a plan to dispossess the Claimant of its investment in

Kozhan.'!°

The Claimant submits that in order to recover a part of its investment after the 2003 SPA
Proceedings, it initiated an IUS arbitration under the 2004 Line of Credit Agreement which
led to an award ordering Kozhan to pay USD 30,073,722 to BSEK.!*!

The Claimant contends that the Original Owners constructed an artificial debt in order to
gain the remaining 10% interest BSEK held in Kozhan by off-setting the debt against the
TUS Award. !

The Claimant argues that the Original Owners relied on the 2004 and 2006 Agreements in
order to reverse the debt originally owned by Kozhan to BSEK.'® Two of the Original
Shareholders (Messrs. Kaschapov and Faskhutdinov) commenced court proceedings
against the Claimant, BSEK, ABT and Kozhan in order to invalidate the 2004 and 2006

Agreements regarding the Morskoye field.'°* The Claimant argues that these claims were

merely fabricated, especially because the 2004 Agreements had been terminated and
replaced by the 2006 Agreements and because the claims were without legal substance. !°
The District Court sustained these claims and invalidated the 2004 and 2006 Agreements
partially or fully (depending on the specific Agreement) and ordered that the parties be
reinstated to their original positions. The Claimant submits that this conclusion is meritless,
especially because it does not consider the fact that it was originally Kozhan which owed
a debt to BSEK.'®° The Claimant contends that the ABT Decision, according to which it
suddenly owed a debt of USD 29,626,053 to Kozhan, was not based on Kazakh law (which

is supported by the Claimant’s legal expert, Professor Abzhanov).!°”

The Claimant further clarifies that in its opinion, ABT started to behave in a more hostile
manner towards BSEK because of external threats.’ It also contends that it is of no
relevance that it did not file an appeal against the 2008 ABT Proceeding and that it could

reasonably believe that any attempt to appeal would be fruitless.'°

Finally, the Claimant contends that the Tribunal does not need access to the pleadings in
the 2008 ABT Proceeding for its decision.'”° The Claimant especially points out that, even
if it cannot be determined whether BSEK raised arguments in its defense, the court should

have considered the issues of its own motion.'7!

c. The 2009 Set-Off Proceedings

The Claimant further complains that BSEK’s remaining 10% participation was then set off
against this so-called Court-ordered Debt even though Kozhan’s original debt was owed to

Big Sky and not to BSEK.'” As a result, the Original Owners regained 100% control over

Kozhan.'”? The Claimant considers this conduct to be unlawful and inconsistent with
Kazakh law.'”* According to the Claimant, the 2009 Set-Off was supposed to allow the
Three Oligarchs to take over Kozhan through the Original Owners and to destroy BSEK’s

pre-emption right as shareholder of Kozhan.!7>

The Claimant contends especially that the District Court failed to notify BSEK or Big Sky
176

properly of the 2009 Set-Off Proceedings so that they were unable to defend themselves.
Furthermore, the Claimant contends that the set-off procedure, i.e., the 2009 Set-Off Ruling

and its enforcement, were not in accordance with Kazakh law.!77

Finally, the Claimant submits that appeal procedures against the 2009 Set-Off Ruling

would have been unsuccessful because the District Court did not extend the deadline for

the filing of an appeal.”

d. The 2012 Set-Off Proceedings

The Claimant argues that BSEK’s efforts to secure a part of the value of its investment
through the IUS Award were rendered fruitless by the Respondent’s courts.!”? The
Specialized Inter-district Economic Court of Almaty City ordered enforcement of the IUS
Award which was confirmed by the Court of Appeal.'*° The Claimant submits that Kozhan,
in order to fight the enforcement, petitioned successfully in front of the District Court that
it could set off the Court-ordered Debt against the [US Award even though this Court-
ordered Debt had already been used as set-off against BSEK’s 10% shareholding in Kozhan

while ignoring that after the set-off Kozhan still owed USD 447,669 to BSEK.'*! The
Claimant argues that this decision was rendered in violation of Kazakh law, i.e. because

Big Sky and BSEK were not even notified of the ongoing proceedings. '*?

The Claimant submits that an appeal filed by BSEK was without success and that BSEK’s
arguments were not addressed by the Court of Appeal.'*? Attempts by BSEK to enforce

the IUS Award allegedly failed due to a decision of the Court of Appeal dated August 17,

2012 which was also confirmed by the Supervisory Collegium on October 23, 2012.!*

(2) The Respondent’s Position

After laying down the structure of the Kazakh Court System,'** the Respondent rejects the
Claimant’s contentions that Kazakh courts failed to apply Kazakh procedural and

substantive law in the four proceedings which are at the center of this case.!**

a. The 2003 SPA Proceedings

The Respondent submits that four of the Original Owners’ spouses (Ms. Roza
Faskhutdinova, Ms. Ranida Faskhutdinova, Mr. Shyngyskhan Seidagaliev and Ms. Zhanat

Faizullayeva) filed a complaint against the 2003 SPA and against the power of attorney

given to Mr. Mukashev; those complaints were consolidated in one single proceeding.!*”

that they did not inform their spouses of the 2003 SPA.!*°

The District Court decided on November 22, 2006 that the requirements for invalidation of
the 2003 SPA were not met and that Kozhan’s re-registration was in full compliance with

Kazakh law. !°°

The Respondent submits that the four spouses filed an appeal against the decision of the
District Court arguing that the District Court misjudged the requirement of spousal consent
and its implications.!?! The Court of Appeal overturned the District Court’s decision
concluding that the District Court’s decision was not based on sufficient evidence and
missed the correct source of the spousal consent’s requirement.'** Furthermore, the
Respondent asserts that the Court of Appeal could send the case back to the District Court

and has the competence to determine the substantive law.'*>

Regarding the appeal brought before the Supervisory Collegium, the Respondent submits
that the Supervisory Collegium refused to review the decision and provided sufficient

reasoning. !°+

As a result, the District Court was supposed to hear an amended version of the spouses’
claim.'°> The Respondent especially points out that BSEK did not raise any objection of

limitation in these second proceedings.!°° The Respondent further submits that the fifth

spouse, Ms. Tulegenova, filed a complaint as well.!°? According to the Respondent,
Kazakh law allows the District Court to decide this additional claim, contrary to the
Claimant’s assertion.'°* The Respondent maintains that the District Court was within its

rights to decline to hear Mr. Baikenov as a witness. !”

The Respondent contends that the District Court issued, correctly and in accordance with
Kazakh law, a decision on April 26, 2007 invalidating the 2003 SPA in accordance with
the decision of the Court of Appeal, i.e. correctly recognizing the necessity of notarized
spousal consent.°° According to the Respondent, the General Prosecutor’s participation in
the appeal proceedings does not indicate that the judicial decisions were “patently

unlawful”.?°!

On May 10, 2007 BSEK and Kozhan submitted a first appeal against the District Court’s
decision, which it considered to be without grounds, and requested to be provided with the
full decision.”°? On May 31, 2007 BSEK filed an amended appeal.?° This appeal was

dismissed on July 6, 2007 and the Court of Appeal confirmed that a notarization of the

spouses’ consent was required.?°*

The Respondent submits that BSEK also tried to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision

through the office of the General Prosecutor. As a result, on October 5, 2007, the Almaty

President who then ordered the General Prosecutor to investigate.°°

On October 30, 2007 the Supervisory Collegium rejected the appeal and concurred with

Court applied the law correctly when not considering the withdrawal of claims by Ms.

pursue them.?!!

The Respondent first points out that the 2008 ABT Decision was rendered after the
Claimant had burdened Kozhan through the execution of the 2006 ABT Agreements and
further forced Kozhan to conclude various other disadvantageous transactions.?!*

The Respondent argues that it is of no relevance whether the District Court’s decision
(agreeing with the Original Owners’ claims) was correct as such and that the Claimant’s
contentions are merely meant to distract the Tribunal from enquiring into BSEK’s actions
and decisions in relation to the ABT proceedings.”!> The Respondent submits in any event
that the Claimant’s criticism of the 2008 ABT Decision is unfounded.”!° The Respondent
argues specifically that the Claimant did not seek to enforce the return of its 15,000,000
shares from ABT which is allegedly the counterpart to the sum the Claimant owed to

Kozhan, according to the District Court’s decision.?!”

Finally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant could not provide a reasonable
explanation as to why it did not lodge an appeal against the 2008 ABT Decision and it

could only have been merely a strategical or tactical decision.7!*

c. The 2008 Set-Off Proceedings

The Respondent submits that after ABT assigned the judgment debt (arising under the 2008
ABT Decision) to Kozhan, Kozhan started to enforce the debts owed to it by Big Sky.?!°

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 52 of 184

The Respondent submits that it is impossible to determine when the Claimant learned of
these proceedings in the absence of any documents from the enforcement file but considers
that the Claimant must have been aware of the 2009 set-off.” The Respondent furthermore
considers the 2009 Set-Off Ruling to be correct and in accordance with Kazakh law and
rejects the Claimant’s expert’s criticism (Professor Abzhanov) of the set-off decision itself

and of the execution of this decision.””!

The Respondent asserts that — contrary to the Claimant’s allegations — the Respondent’s
courts applied Kazakh law correctly when deciding on the set-off issue.” According to
the Respondent, the courts correctly recognized the possibility of a set-off and also
correctly assessed that the assignment from ABT to Kozhan was valid.?”* Furthermore, the
Respondent contends that the District Court could correctly enforce the 2008 ABT
Decision by granting a set-off; this execution was handled in accordance with Kazakh
law.274

The Respondent further submits that BSEK only initiated appeal proceedings in November
2012, and that the District Court rejected a restoration of the deadline for the filing of an
appeal.??> According to the Respondent, this decision is in line with Kazakh law even if

the Claimant’s legal expert claims the contrary.?”°

d. The 2012 Set-Off Proceedings

The Respondent argues that BSEK applied for the enforcement of the IUS Award at the

latest possible time.??’ The Respondent argues that when Big Sky’s application to enforce

the IUS Award was granted, Kozhan filed a motion to set off the award against the debt
owed to Kozhan.?** The Respondent submits that on April 10, 2012, the District Court and
the State Bailiff correctly granted a set-off (the “2012 Termination Ruling”) and points
out that Big Sky and BSEK had been notified of the hearing and of the decision.?”?

The Respondent submits that Big Sky and BSEK must have been aware of the 2012
Termination Ruling but still did not file an appeal and chose instead to try the enforcement
of the entire [US Award (which allegedly had been partially set off).7° After enforcement
was initiated, Kozhan filed a complaint with the District Court, but this complaint was

rejected.?*!

The Respondent refers to the appeal proceedings of BSEK against the 2012 Set-Off which
was dismissed by the Court of Appeal on August 2, 2012.7? The Respondent rejects the

Claimant’s argument that the Court of Appeal failed to address numerous arguments of the

appeal.?3

The Respondent further argues that Kozhan voluntarily paid the outstanding part of the
TUS Award.?*4 The Respondent alleges that BSEK directed Private Bailiff Mekebayev to
withdraw the writ of execution so that the amount paid by Kozhan was returned to it.?°>

THE TRIBUNAL’S CONSIDERATION OF THE PARTIES’ STATEMENTS OF FACTS

The Parties largely agree on the general facts that led to the State action at issue in this case

JURISDICTION

THE PARTIES’ POsITIO! DENIAL OF BENEFITS

 

(dd) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent invokes the denial of benefits clause of Article I(2) of the BIT, which

provides:

“Each Party reserves the right to deny to any company the advantages of
this Treaty if nationals of any third country control such company and, in
the case of a company of the other Party, that company has no substantial
business activities in the territory of the other Party or is controlled by
nationals of a third country with which the denying Party does not maintain
normal economic relations.”

The Respondent considers that the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT fall within the
ambit of the denial of benefits clause.”*° To this end, the Respondent interprets Article I(2)

of the BIT to contain two requirements:74!

e Nationals of any third party control the Claimant; and

e The Claimant either has no substantial business activities in the territory of the US
or is controlled by nationals of a third country with which the Respondent does not
maintain normal economic relations.

The Respondent argues that pursuant to an interpretation in accordance with Article 31 of
the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties it is entitled to invoke Article 1(2) of the
BIT without temporal restrictions“? and especially at the early stage of the proceedings.”

The Respondent adds that this also aligns with the object and purpose of the BIT to deny

those investors the benefits of the BIT who do not “genuinely engage in the economic

activities [of the BIT].”#

Referring to the CCL v. Kazakhstan case, the Respondent submits that the requirements of
Article I(2) of the BIT need to be fulfilled on the date of the request for arbitration.**> The
Respondent further contends that other tribunals (Ulysseas v. Ecuador, Guaracachi v.
Bolivia, Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine; all assessing different BITs) also decided in this
direction.*4° The Respondent rejects the argument sometimes made in Energy Charter
Treaty (“ECT”) cases whereby the State has to notify the investor in advance of its
intention to rely on the denial of benefits clause, and argues that those decisions were only

made due to the “specific nature of the ECT.”?*”

a. The Issue of Control

The Respondent submits that the term “control” is to be understood as control-in-fact by a
natural person in order to align this requirement with the object and purpose of the BIT
(economic reciprocity and prevalence of substance over form).”** Referring to Ulysseas
Inc. v. Ecuador, the Respondent notes that the tribunal held with regard to an identical

clause that: “the natural person who is the ultimate controller of [the claimant] and its

nationality must be identified.”?4?

The Respondent considers that the Claimant failed to substantiate that it is in fact controlled

by a US national.

The Respondent argues that the burden of proof must be on the Claimant because all
relevant facts are within its possession/control or at least the evidentiary burden would have
to be shifted to the Claimant because the Respondent raised reasonable doubts.” To
strengthen this position, the Respondent refers again to the CCL v. Kazakhstan case,”*! and
to Bridgestone v. Panama and the ICJ’s Diallo case.**? Additionally, the Respondent
submits that, according to Amto v. Ukraine, a Tribunal can draw adverse inferences if one

party refuses to provide evidence as to who in fact has control over a company.?*>

The Respondent argues that the Claimant did not submit (sufficient) evidence of the

ownership despite being asked to do so by the Respondent several times.7*4

First, the Respondent submits that Mr. Lawler is a “nominee director” and that, as such, he
does not exercise control in fact over the Claimant.*** The Respondent also notes that Mr.
Lawler was not called as a witness by the Claimant to answer the question of who was Big
Sky’s controller-in-fact.?°° The Respondent recognizes that Mr. Lawler is and was at the
date of the request a US national and the Claimant’s sole director; nevertheless, the
Respondent argues that Mr. Lawler takes instructions from someone else.”°’ According to

the Respondent, Mr. Lawler is a lawyer who works with other US registered companies

whose operations are conducted in other jurisdictions and who is signatory of SEC filings

for more than 50 corporate entities.?**

Whereas the Claimant argues that Mr. Lawler was appointed Sole Director just before the
Board of Directors resigned, the Respondent considers the email which was produced by
the Claimant in evidence thereof to be unsuitable to prove that Mr. Lawler is more than a
mere nominee director. This is because (i) the documentation provided predates
Mr. Lawler’s appointment, and (ii) the email submitted does not address Mr. Lawler and
is therefore inconclusive.**? Therefore, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has not
substantiated who benefits from the arbitration and who exercises control- in-fact over Big

Sky.26°

Second, the Respondent submits that the Claimant is not owned by US nationals.
According to the Respondent, this is because the Claimant’s most substantial shareholders
are not US nationals or corporations registered under US law.?*!

Third, the Respondent states that the Claimant is in any event not controlled by its
shareholders. According to the Respondent, even if the Claimant could argue that, legally,
under Nevada law and the Claimant’s bylaws, the Claimant’s board of directors is
controlled by its shareholders, this is not corroborated by factual evidence. This is
especially because Mr. Lawler failed to call the shareholders meetings and therefore did
not allow the shareholders to exercise control in fact by relying on internet submission of
alleged shareholders of the Claimant.?*? The Respondent furthermore argues that it is
irrelevant whether the Claimant conducts “normal business activities” and that it is
uncontested that the Claimant’s only current activity is the conduct of the present

arbitration.?°

The Respondent submits that the person who controls the arbitration is the person who
controls in fact the Claimant because the present arbitration is its only activity.7™
According to the Respondent, this is a national of a third country. Whilst complaining that
the Claimant produced only one document in the document production phase of the
proceedings, the Respondent relies on the document obtained — the arbitration funding
agreement between Vannin Capital PCC, Big Sky, BSEK, Big Sky Energy Atyrau Limited,
Fietta LLP and Agrima Limited — to argue that the person ultimately in control is
Mr. Daniel Israel, a Belgian national, the controller of Agrima Limited who is the case

manager.”°

In light of the above, the Respondent — relying on the tribunal in Amto LLC v. Ukraine —
considers that the Claimant allegedly did not produce satisfying evidence regarding control
and that the Tribunal should therefore infer that the Claimant is not controlled by a national

of the United States.”

b. The Claimant’s Substantial Activities in the United States

In order to determine the meaning of the term “substantial business activities in the territory
of the US” the Respondent considers it to be self-explanatory but nevertheless points out
that the business activities have to refer to the Claimant itself, not any related entity.?°’ The
Respondent also submits that this requirement has to be met at the date of the filing of the

request for arbitration.?*

Based on this standard the Respondent contends that the Claimant has never had

“substantial business activities” within the US.?°

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 61 of 184

To this end, the Respondent submits that the Claimant was originally incorporated as the
“Institute for Counselling, Inc.”, acquired a company of the British Virgin Islands (China
Broadband Corp), and had allegedly close connections to China and Chinese companies.?”°
At this time, Mr. Heysel, of Canadian nationality, served as CEO of China Broadband
Corp.?7! The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s principal business office was located
in China, its administrative office in Canada, that its assets were located outside of the US,
and that it never had any physical presence in the US.?” In 2003, the Claimant acquired

BSEK and eventually became Big Sky Energy Corporation.?”°

The Respondent considers that the Claimant is a mere “shell company” and submits that it
had no business activities in the US at the date of the filing of the Request, an assessment
which it considers to be acknowledged by the Claimant’s observations on bifurcation and

Mr. Heysel’s witness statement.?”

Further, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s entire Board of Directors stepped down
in 2013, and that the company has not had any business activities since 2013. In fact,
according to the Respondent, Mr. Lawler is the only remaining person behind the Claimant
(acting as President, Secretary, Treasurer and Director), and the only real “activity”

performed by the Claimant is the pursuit of the present arbitration.?”°

Additionally, the Respondent submits that the Claimant never had any substantial business

to draw parallels because of other facts/evidence and because of the ECT’s structurally

different denial of benefits clause).?””

Therefore, according to the Respondent, the Tribunal cannot follow the reasoning of the
tribunal in Masdar v. Spain because the Claimant allegedly never had any presence in the
US.°’8 The Respondent argues that the Claimant (i) never had any office in the US, (ii) its
company meetings were always held somewhere else, (iii) never had a US bank account
and (iv) never employed permanent staff in the US.?”° The Respondent also argues that the
filing of annual reports with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”),
the finance-raising in the US or the existence of a debt towards a US company is not

suitable to demonstrate substantial business activities in the US.?%

Additionally, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s distinction between “operations” and
“business activities.”**! The Respondent also argues that the Claimant’s reliance on
Amto v. Ukraine and on Bridgestone v. Panama is misplaced because the facts in the
respective arbitrations were different (because in the cases of reference the party had

certain activities which were carried out in the State in question).?*”

Finally, the Respondent contends that this assessment is not influenced by the Claimant’s
character as a publicly traded company and its many individual shareholders. According to
the Respondent, this interpretation does not find echo in the wording of the Article I(2) of

the BIT, especially considering the fact that the Claimant is, for over a decade, not a

publicly listed company.”* Further, the Respondent points out that — to its knowledge — no
tribunal had to decide in the past on the applicability of the denial of benefits clause to a
publicly listed company.”* In its Reply on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on the Merits and
Quantum, the Respondent refers to Ampal v. Egypt to argue that — even if it was not a
decisive question in those proceedings — the tribunal did not give any indication that a

publicly listed company does not fall within the scope of a denial of benefits clause.*°

The Respondent further submits that the activity to conduct the present arbitration, the sole
activity of the Claimant, is not sufficient to meet the requirement of “substantial business
activity”.?°°

The Respondent rejects that the Claimant’s activities in the US ceased due to the
Respondent’s conduct and that as a result the Respondent should be precluded from
invoking the denial of benefit clause in the BIT. According to the Respondent, even if this
was factually verified (which the Respondent refutes), the Claimant’s legal argument is
meritless, as it is in contradiction with the language and rationale of Article I(2) of the

BIT.287

Finally, the Respondent concludes that, in any event, the Claimant had no substantial
business activities on the date of the filing of the Request which is the relevant date to

assess the denial of benefits clause.7**

The Claimant submits that the Tribunal has jurisdiction over the dispute and rejects the

highlights that the requirements of Article (2) of the BIT are cumulative and are supposed

to exclude “mere shell companies” from the BIT’s protection.”

As a general remark, the Claimant submits that it did produce all evidence which it was
obligated to disclose with regard to the Respondent’s jurisdictional objection regarding the
denial of benefits clause. According to the Claimant, it disclosed the identity of its
shareholders, Mr. Lawler’s position and activities, the funding of the present arbitration

and the absence of control by nationals of a third country.??!

The Claimant contends that the burden of proof lies upon the Respondent as the party which
invokes the denial of benefits clause.” In particular, the Claimant refers to the decisions
in Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, Pac Rim v. El Salvador and Amto v. Ukraine which,
according to the Claimant, accepted that the Respondent bears the burden of proof for the
fulfilment of the requirements of a denial of benefits clause.”*? Furthermore, the Claimant
points out that proceedings initiated before the US District Court of Arizona (under section

1782 of Title 28 of the US Code) were dismissed.” In the alternative, the Claimant argues

that it provided enough evidence to discharge the burden of proof.*?°

The Claimant contends that it is a publicly held Nevada corporation and that it is not

controlled by any non-US person or entity.” It further submits that its substantial business

activity was raising debt and equity finance for the development of its investments in

Kazakhstan, activities it only had to cease due to the Respondent’s conduct.??”

a. The Issue of Control

According to the Claimant, the Respondent did not demonstrate that the Claimant is
controlled by a national of a third country. As a general remark, the Claimant clarifies that
the Tribunal must assert the requirement of control with regard to the Claimant’s position
“but for” the host State’s conduct in dispute.?”

The Claimant disagrees with the Respondent’s arguments (based on CCL v. Kazakhstan)
that the Claimant did not provide evidence that it is controlled by US nationals. It also
disagrees that Mr. Lawler is a “nominee director” who does not exercise control in fact.?°

The Claimant bases its argument on two main points.

First, the Claimant refers to its bylaws to argue that it is in law controlled by its Directors
amongst whom were two US nationals prior to March 2013 (Dr. Philip D Pardo and Mr.
Daniel Caleb Feldman) and after the resignation of the Board of Directors in March 2013
by Mr. Scott Lawler, who is also of US nationality.*°° The Claimant further submits that
Mr. Lawler and the Claimant can look back on a long working relationship.*”' Ultimately,

the Board of Directors is under the control of the shareholders.>”

Second, according to the Claimant, Mr. Lawler, the Sole Director, controls the Claimant in
fact.*°? The Claimant submits that Mr. Lawler managed its activities, especially in regard

to the debt owed towards Ingalls & Snyder.*** The Claimant contends that no more than

one director is currently needed because its business activities ceased due to the
Respondent’s conduct.*5 It was Mr. Lawler who ultimately initiated the treaty arbitration

and engaged outside professionals to assist.*°°

The Claimant further points out that shareholder meetings were held in 2005 and in
2006.°**” In these meetings, the shareholders had — contrary to the assertions of the
Respondent — the possibility to exercise their control over the Claimant and they could e.g.

demand to receive the Claimant’s annual report.*°

Additionally, the Claimant argues that as a company listed on the US stock exchange it is
subject to a multitude of regulations which allow the conclusion that the Claimant was

“anchored” in the US.°

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that Article (2) of the BIT refers to the control over
the Claimant, not to the control over the arbitration (as allegedly suggested by the

Respondent).*!°

Finally, the Claimant argues that its character as a publicly listed company opposes the
denial of benefits clause because (i) this means that there is not one single controlling
shareholder, and (ii) that it is in the very nature of such a company for shareholders to
change over time.*!! In addition, contrary to what the Respondent argues, there was no
attempt to lessen the influence of investors from the US within the Claimant’s

shareholding.?!”

The Claimant further submits that the reasoning of the precedent on which the Respondent
tries to rely (CCL v. Kazakhstan) cannot be applied to the present dispute.*!? First of all,
the Claimant argues that the CCL v. Kazakhstan tribunal did not base its decision on the
denial of benefits clause but rather on the lack of information provided by the investor.°!*
Additionally, the cases differ because the present Claimant’s shares are not held privately

and by a small number of shareholders.*!°

In light of the above, the Claimant argues that the Respondent did not meet its burden of

proof and did not demonstrate that the requirements of Article I(2) of the BIT are met.?!°

In its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections, the Claimant further points out that, according
to its own presentation and to Ulysseas v. Republic of Ecuador, the Respondent misjudges
the requirement of “control”. In the Claimant’s view, it includes control in fact as well as
control in law.*!’ The Claimant submits that no third-party nationals controlled the

Claimant at any moment in time in fact or in law.*!*

To this end, the Claimant argues that the Board of Directors was not controlled by nationals
from a third country. The directors were of different nationalities and none of them could
control the board.*!° As the Claimant’s business had ceased due to the Respondent’s
disputed conduct, the Board of Directors resigned and Mr. Lawler was designated the

Claimant’s Sole Director.*”° The Claimant further submits on this issue that Mr. Lawler

was the controller in law and in fact and had only to answer to the shareholders. There was

however never one or several shareholders that had control over the Claimant.*?!

The Claimant also stresses that, first, the criterion of control over the present arbitration is

not relevant for Article I(2) of the BIT and, second, that this control lies with Mr. Lawler.

In any event, the Claimant submits that Article I(2) of the BIT refers to the control over the
Claimant (i.e. not over the arbitration) and not to the person that ultimately benefits from

the arbitration.*”? The person responsible for the conduct of the arbitration is Mr. Lawler.>>

Additionally, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s reliance on CCL v. Kazakhstan and
argues that the cases are different, especially that the tribunal in CCL v. Kazakhstan lacked

evidence regarding the control over the claimant-investor (which it alleges is not the case

324

in the present arbitration).°~* Moreover, the Claimant argues that CCL v. Kazakhstan was

not followed by other tribunals.*?°

Finally, the Claimant considers it not unusual to resort to a third party for financial support
in the arbitration and refers in this respect to ICSID precedents, including Abaclat v. The
Argentine Republic; Ambiente Ufficio v. The Argentine Republic, Giovanni Alemanni and

Others v. The Argentine Republic.?*6

regard to the date on which the Claimant must have had substantial business activities and
the notion of substantial business activities.*?* The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s
argument that the relevant moment is only the date of the filing of the request for arbitration

and argues that the relevant timeframe is broader.”

The Claimant asks the Tribunal again to decide on a “but for” analysis to prevent the
Respondent from invoking the denial of benefits clause after “destroying” the
investment.**? The Claimant argues that prior to 2008, when it lost its investment, it had

substantial business activities in the US.**!

The Claimant submits that its activity consisted in the raising of equity for the investment
in Kazakhstan and that it was subject to several potential liabilities due to its reporting

obligation towards the SEC.>*?

The Claimant submits further that it raised — under the lead of Mr. Heysel — capital for its
investment operation from 2000 to 2006, in particular by attracting US investors, and had

a market capitalization of over USD 350 million by 2006 and planned to continue to do so

once it is listed again.*** Additionally, the Claimant used private placements.***

Furthermore, the Claimant referred to its multitude of SEC filings.**°

Moreover, the Claimant explained that it resorted to debt financing with a US investment

firm (Ingalls & Snyder, represented by Mr. Thomas Boucher, a US national).**°

Additionally, the Claimant submits that it did hire US advisers and US service providers

for its business in the US.>°”

The Claimant points out that the Respondent did not submit jurisprudence applying a denial
of benefits clause to publicly listed companies.*** Furthermore, the Claimant argues that
the Respondent’s reference to Pac Rim v. El Salvador is not fitting because in the present
arbitration the Claimant exercises an activity beyond mere asset holding.**? The Claimant
refers to the Amto v. Ukraine and the Masdar v. Spain arbitrations in support of its argument
that a substantial activity does not necessarily have to be a large activity.*“° As it raised
over USD 80 million on US markets and increased its market capitalization to over USD
350 million, the Claimant considers its financing activities to be material and of “great
magnitude.”*4! With reference to Bridgestone v. Panama, the Claimant contends that the
requirement of substantial activities is also fulfilled by activities which are a significant

part of the Claimant’s business.**

Ultimately, the Claimant submits that only the financing operations in the US allowed the

realization of its investment in Kazakhstan.*

Moreover, the Claimant argues that the Respondent cannot rely on an objection to
jurisdiction which results from its own conduct and that — for the same reason — the

Respondent should not be allowed to argue that the relevant date is the one of the filing of

the request for arbitration.*“* According to the Claimant, its business activities ceased due
to the Respondent’s conduct.*#5 The Claimant refers to Article 31(1) of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties ¢he“YEL¥F”) and its rule of interpretation in good
faith to argue that the Respondent is not allowed to invoke the denial of benefits clause
because, if the requirement of lack of substantial business were to be fulfilled, this would

only result from the Respondent’s actions.*4°

To conclude, the Claimant submits that the requirements of Article I(2) of the BIT are not

met in the present arbitration.*4”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

To recall, the denial of benefits clause contained in Article I(2) of the BIT provides:

“Each Party reserves the right to deny to any company the advantages of
this Treaty if nationals of any third country control such company and, in
the case of a company of the other Party, that company has no substantial
business activities in the territory of the other Party or is controlled by
nationals of a third country with which the denying Party does not maintain
normal economic relations.”

As indicated by both Parties, the denial of benefits issue under Article I(2) of the BIT

concerns two levels of analysis — control and substantial business activities.

(dd) Control by Nationals of a Third Country

For the Respondent to successfully invoke Article I(2) of the BIT, it must establish that the

Claimant was controlled by nationals of a third country.

Both Parties address the concept of control from a legal and factual perspective, and thus

both are addressed below.

a. Controller-in-Law

While the Respondent’s jurisdictional arguments focus on the control of the Claimant as
of the date of filing the request for arbitration, it is worth noting that before Mr. Lawler
became Sole Director, the Board was controlled by individuals of mixed nationalities
(including two from the US) and there was no third country controlling shareholder that

could arguably be described as having control for the purpose of Article I(2).*#*

Since 2013, Mr. Lawler has served as Sole Director and it is the Claimant’s position that
he has thus been the controller-in-law, subject only to possible shareholder control, which
has failed to exist because of the lack of any definitive individual or group of shareholders

wielding such control over Mr. Lawler in his position as Sole Director.

The Respondent calls into question Mr. Lawler’s legal ability to control the Claimant as
the Claimant’s bylaws specify a minimum of three directors.*4? While Mr. Lawler’s
position as the Sole Director would appear to be at odds with this highlighted section of
the bylaws, the Respondent fails to demonstrate that Mr. Lawler subsequently lacked legal
control over the Claimant as a result. In reality, regardless of whether the Claimant should,
by its own bylaws, work with a minimum of three directors, there is no doubt that Mr.
Lawler has indeed been operating as the Sole Director with the legal powers that
accompany such a position. Further, even if this Tribunal were to delve deeper into this
issue, such a discrepancy fails to establish legal control from nationals of a third country,
but rather questions the Claimant’s decision to operate in such a manner. The Tribunal is

therefore satisfied that Mr. Lawler was the controller-in-law.

b. Controller-in-Fact

The Respondent dedicates most of its argument to the issue of controller-in-fact, which is
arguably more complex than the controller-in-law analysis. The Respondent’s argument is
primarily two-fold: (1) the Claimant’s contention that Mr. Lawler controls the Claimant is
unconvincing; and (2) as manager of this arbitration, the Claimant’s only current activity,

Agrima, through Mr. Daniel Israel, a Belgian national who resides in the Democratic

Republic of the Congo, is the controller-in-fact of the Claimant. The Respondent further
alleges that the Claimant’s shareholders do not exercise control over the Claimant, but this
point is not determinative as the Claimant also acknowledges that, despite the theoretical
control of shareholders, no predominant group exists that could qualify as controller-in-
fact. In that sense the Parties are in agreement and the nationalities of the shareholders is

not the dispositive issue here.

Concerning the first point, the Respondent argues that, for the purpose of Article I(2) of
the BIT, it is insufficient for the Claimant to merely point to the individual who is formally
vested with the power of control over the Claimant.**° Specifically, although Mr. Lawler
is registered as the Claimant’s Sole Director, the Respondent contends that the available
evidence suggests that Mr. Lawler is a nominee director who takes his instructions from
another entity or individual.**' The Respondent highlights the lack of evidence provided in
this arbitration concerning the Claimant’s desire to vest Mr. Lawler with actual control, or

Mr. Lawler’s exercise of said control.

While it admittedly could have been helpful to hear from Mr. Lawler at the hearing
concerning the details of his position, the Tribunal finds that it has enough information

before it to rule on this issue.

Importantly, the Respondent has failed to establish that Mr. Lawler is a nominee director
who takes instructions from another entity or individual, as alleged. In examining the
footnote that accompanies this general argument in the Respondent’s Memorial on
Jurisdiction and Counter-Memorial on the Merits, it can be seen that the Respondent fails
to provide any evidence that definitively supports this position,** but rather primarily
relies on its contention that the Claimant has failed to provide evidence establishing that

Mr. Lawler is not merely such a nominee director.*** This of course relates to his role

generally, and is distinct from the Respondent’s position concerning control over this

arbitration which is addressed below.

While the Tribunal does acknowledge the Claimant’s failure to provide thoroughly
compelling evidence concerning Mr. Lawler’s role in the company, the Claimant has
managed to provide enough support to withstand an argument which is primarily based on
the allegation that the Claimant has failed to meet its initial burden. Prior to their
resignation in March 2013, the Board of Directors, empowered with controlling the
business activities of the Claimant, appointed Mr. Lawler as the Sole Director, President,
Secretary and Treasurer.*°> As the Claimant correctly highlights, Mr. Lawler has had a
long-standing relationship with the Claimant, having been appointed its US General
Counsel in 2006.3°° The Tribunal is not willing to characterize Mr. Lawler as a mere
“nominee director”. In his role, the Tribunal sees no evidence suggesting that anyone other
than Mr. Lawler manages the Claimant’s activities at the Board level, which is the role of
the Sole Director.*°’ Absent any compelling evidence that Mr. Lawler takes instructions
from someone else in his capacity as the Sole Director, the Tribunal is satisfied that

Mr. Lawler’s execution of this role is sufficient to withstand scrutiny.

Aside from the general contention that Mr. Lawler fails to display actual control-in-fact
over the Claimant, the Respondent specifically alleges that control over the Claimant has
been exercised by Agrima through Mr. Daniel Israel, a Belgian national who resides in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo.*** The Respondent’s theory relies on the fact that
Agrima is the “Claim Manager” in the Arbitration Funding Agreement governing the
Claimant’s dispute before this Tribunal.**? Specifically, the funding agreement provides
that Agrima, as the Claim Manager, “must (i) use its best endeavors to give Counsel prompt

and regular instructions on behalf of [the] Claimant[], that allow Counsel to do their work

properly; and (2) [on] behalf of the Claimant not ask Counsel to work in an improper or

unreasonable way.”°°°

With respect to Mr. Israel’s direct control, the Respondent highlights ICIJ Offshore Leaks
Database documents demonstrating Mr. Israel’s control of Agrima, as well as a December
5, 2012 email to Mr. Lawler, among other recipients, in which the arbitration at hand is

referred to as the “Daniel Israel international investment treaty arbitration”.*“!

Ultimately the Respondent takes the position that while the Claimant may secure funding
from a third party, it must do so “without entirely divesting its board and its shareholders
of control over both itself and the resulting proceedings.” On that note, the Respondent
comments that (1) it may be the case that Agrima is set to receive all the benefits from
these proceedings (which is unknown because of the Claimant’s decision to redact the
relevant provision of the funding agreement); and (2) the evidence reveals that Agrima is
the controller and the entity standing to benefit from the advantages of the treaty within the

meaning of Article I(2) of the BIT.

The Tribunal is not convinced that an arbitration funding arrangement necessarily transfers
control-in-fact of a party to the claim manager. While such a transfer is in theory possible
and could be contractually provided for, that is not the case here and instead the Respondent
relies on merely presumed control present in a standard relationship between a claim

manager and a party.

There is a stark difference between control-in-fact of an entity and having an active role in
how that entity pursues legal claims in an arbitration. As lawyers act on behalf of parties
in such proceedings, Agrima here, pursuant to the funding agreement, also acts on behalf

of the Claimant, not as its controller.*°

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 76 of 184

In this respect, the Tribunal finds the Ambiente Ufficio S.p.4A. v. Argentine Republic
(“Ambiente”) case particularly helpful. In Ambiente, the tribunal noted that the
respondent’s concern was not the funding arrangement as such, but that a third party

(NASAM) “was the driving force behind the present arbitration and that it has full control

over it.”364

The Ambiente tribunal then observed:

“The Tribunal considers that, while NASAM has, without doubt, played a
crucial role not only in financing the present proceedings on the Claimants’
side, but also in bringing them together and coordinating them to conduct
the proceedings against the Respondent, this does not amount to putting
NASAM in a position to “control” the present proceedings. The lawyers
acting in this case are bound by the Power of Attorney which legally links
them to the Claimants, and to the Claimants only. At the same time, these
lawyers are not bound by the NASAM Mandate which is a contract between
NASAM and the Claimants. Hence, the Tribunal cannot conclude that
NASAM is more than a third party which has a special relationship to the
Claimants. It is not a party to the present proceedings. The NASAM
Mandate does not interfere with the ability of the Claimants to conduct the
present proceedings in their best interest and to instruct their counsel
accordingly.”>°>

Here the Tribunal is faced with a similar scenario. It does not question that there is a
relationship between Agrima and the Claimant, or that Mr. Israel, as a Belgian national, is
involved in such a relationship. Further, the Tribunal does not question that this relationship
concerns this very arbitration and the proceeds that may come from it. The Tribunal rejects,
however, that such a relationship amounts to putting Agrima in “control” of the
proceedings, let alone the Claimant, to an extent relevant for the purpose of analyzing the

denial of benefits clause present in Article I(2).

Simply put, the Respondent fails to articulate a viable legal theory whereby the Claimant,

through Mr. Lawler, surrendered control-in-fact of the Claimant by entering into a funding

agreement whereby an outside claim manager has an active role in managing the

arbitration.

The Respondent relies heavily on CCL v. Republic of Kazakhstan (“CCL”) for its position,

but that case is quite distinguishable to the case at hand.

As noted by the Claimant, in CCL the tribunal was faced with a lack of evidence to properly
determine who in fact was in charge of the claimant-investor. Specifically, the CCL tribunal
noted that (i) reasonable doubt had been raised as to the actual ownership of and control
over the company seeking protection under the treaty; (ii) by [Mr. X]’s own admission, the
sole activity of the claimant since the termination of the relevant agreement, and the sole
asset of the claimant, was the arbitration; (iii) that the arbitration was financed solely by a
group of shareholders allegedly owning 49 per cent of the shares in the holding company;
and (iv) that the economic outcome of the arbitration was fixed with 5/6 to the shareholder
group and 1/6 to [Mr. X]. This scenario led to the CCL tribunal concluding that the claimant
had the burden of proving that [Mr. X] was in control of the decisions to be made in the
arbitration or generally in control, directly or indirectly, of the claimant, as [Mr. X]’s

nationality was being invoked for the purposes of the treaty.*°°

The CCL tribunal ultimately found that the claimant had failed to provide information and
evidence concerning ownership and control despite repeated requests to do so, and
therefore the tribunal determined that the claimant had not provided sufficient proof that
US citizens or companies had any degree of control, directly or indirectly, over the

claimant.*”

Here, as noted by the Claimant, neither the funder nor the claim manager is a shareholder
of the Claimant, unlike in CCL, eliminating a crucial layer of possible control at issue in
that case. In the dispute at hand, the Claimant has provided a list of shareholders, who are

diverse and thus do not represent control by nationals of a third country, and the shares are

not privately held by unknown shareholders in a shell company, which was at issue in

ccL.3%8

Further, aside from the focus on Mr. Israel as the controller-in-fact, the Respondent focuses
generally on the lack of involvement seen from Mr. Lawler, questioning the assertion that
he is the relevant controller for the purpose of this analysis. However, in this arbitration
the Tribunal has before it a claimant-investor with a clearly identified Sole Director of US
nationality, entering into a funding agreement whereby the assistance of an outside claim
manager has been procured for an undisclosed percentage of possible future proceeds. This

scenario is simply not comparable to that of CCL.

On the basis of the above analysis, the Tribunal concludes that, for the purpose of Article
I(2) of the BIT, it has not been established that the Claimant was controlled by nationals of

a third country.

While the Respondent’s failure to establish the first prong of the denial of benefits clause
is enough for the Tribunal to dismiss the Respondent’s invocation of Article I(2) of the
BIT, the Tribunal provides additional analysis below concerning substantial business

activities.

(2) Substantial Business Activities

Before examining the business activities at issue, it is important to understand the nature
of the activities, or lack thereof, necessary for the application of the denial of benefits

clause.

First, the Tribunal must address the relevant date. The Claimant correctly points out that
the denial of benefits clause is designed primarily to exclude from treaty protection certain
“mailbox” companies that have no meaningful connection to the country whose nationality
is invoked.*° Accordingly, the denial of benefits clause permits a state from denying

protection to such companies.

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 79 of 184

For this purpose, it does not logically follow that the only relevant date for examining such
activities would be the date of a request for arbitration. It is quite a common characteristic
of investment treaty arbitrations that by the time a request for arbitration is filed, a claimant-
investor is fairly or completely inactive aside from the arbitration itself, in large part
because of the negative business effects it attributes to a host State. Because of this, if the
only relevant date was the start of an arbitration, then, in theory, a respondent State could
assure itself of protection under the denial of benefits clause as long as it took such
significant action against a claimant-investor as to completely rid it of any current business
activities (e.g., a complete and total expropriation). This simply cannot be the proper
analysis under such a clause, which is why tribunals have analyzed business activities more

broadly with respect to the relevant date.*”°

The Respondent spends considerable effort highlighting the lack of certain qualities
displayed by the Claimant that one might expect from a typical business conducting
activities in the US. While the absence of certain examples of what could be considered
“typical” business activities (e.g., the presence of a physical office) may be relevant for an
overall view of how a business was operating, in the context of a “substantial business
activity” under Article I(2) of the BIT, this is not the proper means of analysis. Rather,
since a threshold of activities must be met, it is instead more helpful to examine the
allegations before us concerning business activities and to then weigh whether they are

sufficiently “substantial” to avoid a denial of benefits clause.

The analysis begins with the meaning of “substantial”, as no definition is provided for in
the BIT. There is no clear test for fulfilling this requirement, but the Parties have both

provided language helpful for establishing the burden here.

As the Claimant highlights, having “substantial business activities” in a particular
jurisdiction has been clarified not to refer solely to the jurisdiction with the most substantial

connections, but rather includes jurisdictions where sufficiently substantial business

activity is seen.*”! The test for substantial business activities takes its color from the nature
of the business.*” In this respect, the Claimant submits that arbitral tribunals have

determined that:

“Ts]ubstantial’ in this context means ‘of substance, and not merely of form.’
It does not mean ‘large,’ and the materiality not the magnitude of the

business activity is the decisive question”;>”>

“[s]ince it is the quality and not just the quantity of the activities that is
relevant, whether the term ‘important’ or the term ‘substantial’ is used does
not make a difference”;*”

“tribunals that have found such activities to exist have been prepared to do
so on the basis of a relatively small number of activities both in terms of
quantity and quality”;>” and that

“[a] business activity may not be cursory, fleeting or incidental, but must be
of sufficient extent and meaning as to constitute a genuine connection by
the company to its home state. That genuine connection is necessary to
ensure that the company is one that the home State has an interest to protect,
and which the host State would consider it appropriate for the home State
to protect. The connection between the company and its home State cannot
be merely a sham, with no business reality whatsoever, other than an
objective of maintaining its own corporate existence.”>”°

e Between 2000 and 2006, the Claimant’s stock was traded on the OTC-BB in the
US.

The Respondent argues that this case is analogous to Pac Rim Rayman L.L.C. v. Republic
of El Salvador (“Pac Rim”) in which a similar holding company was found to lack
substantial business activities in the US.°*° That case is, however, distinguishable from the

dispute at hand.

In Pac Rim, the Tribunal determined that the claimant was nothing beyond a mere holding
company, with its activities as a holding company not directed at business activities in the
US. In addressing its activities in the US before and after a nationality change, the tribunal

noted that it was:

“not possible from the evidence . . . for the Tribunal to identify any material
difference between the Claimant’s activities as a company established in the
Cayman Islands and its later activities as a company established in the USA;
the location (or non-location) of the Claimant’s activities remained
essentially the same notwithstanding the change in nationality, and such
activities were equally insubstantial.”>*!

Based on the above, the Pac Rim tribunal found that, specifically, as a holding company
first in the Cayman Islands and then in the US, the claimant’s activities were principally to
hold shares in El Salvador, with such activities seemingly unchanged even as the claimant’s

nationality changed.**?

Here, the Claimant is not comparable to the type of claimant seen in Pac Rim. While the
claimant in Pac Rim lacked even a board of directors, the Claimant in this arbitration was
a publicly traded company with several business activities directed at the US. It thus cannot

accurately be characterized as merely a “shell company with no geographic location for its

nominal, passive, limited and insubstantial activities.”**? Unlike in Pac Rim, the Claimant
here has highlighted a number of US-specific activities, and while they may lack what
would constitute more convincing evidence of substantial business activities (e.g.,
permanent US staff, physical offices, US bank accounts, etc.), the activities present in this
case nonetheless far exceed those at issue in Pac Rim. The Tribunal is not convinced that

the Pac Rim analysis is comparable here.

Under the Respondent’s own description of “substantial business activities”, the focus is
on “substance” and not “form” and on materiality rather than on magnitude of the business
activity. The Tribunal is convinced that the Claimant fulfils this requirement. While it is
undisputed that the Claimant lacks more traditional components of what a US business may
be expected to demonstrate, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate that such
characteristics are necessary for an entity to be considered to have “substantial business
activities” in a given jurisdiction. The fact is that a publicly listed company raising tens of
millions of US dollars on US markets, including raising equity from US investment
companies and funds managed by US companies, whilst engaging US law firms, filing
numerous SEC reports and arranging consistent face-to-face meetings in the US with US
investors and stockbrokers, can hardly be characterized as a company merely engaging in

activities “of form” as opposed to “of substance”.

The activities in the US were quite material to the Claimant’s purpose and went well

beyond those displayed by traditional “mailbox” or “shell” companies.

The Tribunal repeats here that it need not find the existence of substantial business
activities to deny the Respondent’s denial of benefits position because it finds that the
Claimant was not controlled by nationals of a third country. However, for the sake of
completeness, the Tribunal also concludes that the Claimant engaged in sufficiently

substantial business activities in the US.

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION ON THE MERITS

As a general remark, the Claimant points out that the present arbitration concerns more
than a mere allegation of misconduct of the Respondent’s courts and differs greatly from
Liman v. Kazakhstan.*** To argue this point, the Claimant states that all the Respondent’s
organs, including the courts, were obligated to protect the Claimant’s investment vis-a-vis

the Original Owners and the Three Oligarchs.***

Also, the Claimant submits that under international law the conduct of all the Respondent’s
organs, especially its courts, is imputable to the Respondent and refers to Article 4 of the
International Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally

Wrongful Acts and the Commentary thereto.**°

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the Respondent had a duty of due diligence and
this duty is not limited to the prohibition of a denial of justice.**”? The Claimant refers to
the International Law Association’s study regarding the content of the due diligence
standard under international law and points out the role of due diligence when determining
the Fair and Equitable Treatment (“FET”) and the Full Protection and Security (“FPS”)

standards.*** According to the Claimant, the duty of due diligence requires States to take

appropriate steps to prevent harm and to conduct effective investigations into alleged

wrongdoing..°°?

Generally, the Claimant considers that the BIT standards of protection are not limited to

the denial of justice standard which exists under international law.”

(dd) Article III(1) of the BIT — Expropriation

Article III(1) of the BIT provides:

“Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or
indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization
(“expropriation”) except: for public purpose; in a nondiscriminatory
manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation;
and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of
treatment provided for in Article II(2). Compensation shall be equivalent to
the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the
expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be
calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market
rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a
commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully
realizable; and be freely transferable.”*?!

The Claimant argues that the Respondent violated Article III(1) of the BIT and unlawfully
expropriated the Claimant because none of the actions addressed below were for a public
purpose and the Claimant received no prompt, adequate and effective compensation.*””

Furthermore, the Claimant explains that the Respondent’s organs collectively failed to

protect the Claimant’s investment.*??

The Claimant refers to the Caratube I Tribunal?** which defined the notion of

expropriation under the US-Kazakhstan BIT as “(i) the unreasonable substantial

deprivation of existing rights, (ii) of a certain duration and (iii) caused by a sovereign act
of the host State.”>°> The Claimant further argues that an expropriation can also consist in
the abrogation of the investor’s contractual rights by State courts.*°° Also, the Claimant

argues that the BIT includes indirect expropriation.°**”

The Claimant further clarifies that the protection against expropriation cannot be limited
to a denial of justice standard and that its complaint is not centered around judicial
misconduct.*°* The Claimant submits that the BIT does not distinguish which organ is at

the origin of the expropriation.*”

The Claimant’s argument is that the Respondent expropriated the Claimant’s investment
400

through the court decisions at the heart of this dispute.
The first branch of the Claimant’s argument centers around the alleged unlawful
expropriation of its 100% interest in the charter capital of Kozhan through the court
proceedings regarding the 2003 SPA and the cancellation of the re-registration of

Kozhan.*”!

The Claimant submits that the Kazakh courts issued legally flawed decisions and denied
BSEK due process.*°? The Claimant argues that BSEK’s defenses were not heard and that
crucial elements such as the withdrawal of claims by two of the spouses were not

addressed.

According to the Claimant, following the 2003 SPA decisions, it only owned 10% of
Kozhan’s shares due to the 2005 SPA but was denied the ownership rights in that

The Claimant complains in particular that BSEK was not duly notified of the court
proceedings.*”° According to the Claimant, the 2009 Set-Off cannot be characterized as a

mere error.*°”

The second branch of the Claimant’s argument concerns the Respondent’s conduct
regarding the 2006 Agreements because the Claimant considers that the Respondent’s
courts unlawfully expropriated its rights under those agreements.*°* The Claimant

especially points out that it was under no obligation to exhaust all local remedies. *°”

The Claimant’s third line of argumentation alleges that the Respondent’s courts
expropriated the Claimant’s rights resulting out of the [US Award and the 2004 Line of
Credit Agreement by allowing the 2012 Set-Off.*!? The Claimant submits that these
decisions were legally flawed and not in accordance with Kazakh law and led to the
enforcement of the allegedly fabricated debt a second time.*!! The Claimant contends again

that BSEK was not duly notified of the proceedings.*!”

Finally, the Claimant submits that previous decisions of arbitral tribunals cited in its

Memorial are relevant to the present arbitration.*!* In particular, the Claimant refers to CCL

y. Kazakhstan,*"* in which the tribunal established the criteria for expropriation which the

Claimant says should be applied in this case.*!°

On this issue, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s allegation that its complaint mainly
regards the substantive correctness of the 2003 SPA decisions.*!° The Claimant refers again
to the alleged failures that the Respondent’s courts committed when deciding on the
Claimant’s disputes.*!? The Claimant insists on the alleged fact that the Respondent’s
courts violated a number of procedural rules, especially that the courts failed to address
numerous arguments of BSEK and ignored the withdrawal of the complaints by two of the

spouses as well as Mr. Baikenov’s potential witness status.*!*

(2) Article II(2)(a) of the BIT — FET

The Claimant alleges a violation of the FET standard contained in Article II(2)(a) of the
BIT.*!? Article II(2)(a) provides:

“Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall
enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment
less than that required by international law.”4?°

The Claimant points out that the FET standard as contained in the BIT includes lack of
arbitrariness and as a result covers due process and the predictability of the legal
framework.*?! According to the Claimant, a blatant misapplication of the law can also

amount to a denial of justice and, as a result, a breach of FET.*” Finally, the Claimant

points out that multiple acts or omissions which do not constitute an FET violation per se

can amount to a violation when considered together.*”>

Further, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contentions that the FET standard is limited
to denial of justice.*?* The Claimant refers for example to the Crystallex v. Venezuela*>
decision on the interpretation of the FET standard according to the ordinary meaning of the
terms.*”° On this basis, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s conduct does not need
to be “outrageous” or “egregious,” even though it qualifies the conduct of the Respondent’s

courts as manifestly unjust.*?”

Furthermore, the Claimant refers to the most-favored nation (“MFN”) clause in Article

II(1) of the BIT, which provides:

“Each Party shall permit and treat investment, and activities associated
therewith, on a basis no less favorable than that accorded in like situations
to investment or associated activities of its own nationals or companies, or
of nationals or companies of any third country, whichever is the most
favorable, subject to the right of each Party to make or maintain exceptions
falling within one of the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Treaty.
Each Party agrees to notify the other Party before or on the date of entry
into force of this Treaty of all such laws and regulations of which it is aware
concerning the sectors or matters listed in the Annex. Moreover, each Party
agrees to notify the other of any future exception with respect to the sectors
or matters listed in the Annex, and to limit such exceptions to a minimum.
Any future exception by either Party shall not apply to investment existing
in that sector or matter at the time the exception becomes effective. The
treatment accorded pursuant to any exceptions shall, unless specified
otherwise in the Annex, be not less favorable than that accorded in like
situations to investments and associated activities of nationals or companies
of any third country.”

The Claimant relies on this clause to argue the applicability of Article 4(2) of the

Kazakhstan Investment Law which provides a right of foreign investors to be reimbursed

for damages caused to them in case of the “enactment by a state body of an act conflicting
with legislative acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan or as a result of an illegal action (a

failure to act)”.*°8

More precisely, the Claimant argues that the Court of Appeal’s decision seriously violated
Kazakh procedural and substantive law, especially by omitting to address BSEK’s defenses
and by prejudging the merits.4?? The Claimant further argues that the Supervisory
Collegium’s decision was equally flawed, especially because it did not address BSEK’s
arguments in defense.*° With regard to the second 2003 SPA Decision, the Claimant
complains in particular that the court allowed Ms. Tulegenova to join the proceedings and
did not allow Mr. Baikenov to appear as a witness.**! The Claimant argues that the District
Court failed to address the issue of limitation even though the Supervisory Collegium had
directed it to consider it.4*? Furthermore, the Claimant argues that it did not receive the
District Court’s decision, thereby being hindered in safeguarding its interests by filing an
appeal.**? Finally, the Claimant submits that the Kazakh courts failed to award BSEK any

compensation for the shares that were handed back to the Original Owners.**4

Additionally, the Claimant submits that the rejection of its appeal by the Court of Appeal
and by the Supervisory Collegium was unfounded and points out that its appeal was

supported by the Almaty City Prosecutor (according to the Claimant this is noteworthy

because it was an organ of the Respondent who supported the Claimant’s cause).**°

The Claimant also argues that the Supreme Court’s decision was equally flawed with

regard to procedural and substantive law considerations, particularly with regard to its own

prior jurisprudence.**° The Claimant especially submits that the Supreme Court neglected
to take into account that two of the spouses withdrew their complaints and did not address
the consequences of such a withdrawal.**’ The Claimant also argues that — in execution of
the Supreme Court’s decision — the MOJ annulled not only the 2003 SPA but also the 2005
SPA and this allegedly without any legal basis.***

With regard to the 2006 Agreements, the Claimant argues that the Respondent breached
the FET standard.**? The Claimant submits that the Respondent’s conduct is not only a
further FET standard violation but also a piece of the Respondent’s unlawful “conduct as
a whole.”*#° According to the Claimant, the conduct with regard to the 2006 Agreements
does not impact the overall compensation.**! The Claimant contends - again relying on its
legal expert Professor Abzhanov — that this conduct is contrary to Kazakh law and that
there was no basis under Kazakh law for the debt that the Respondent’s court allegedly
fabricated in the 2008 ABT Decision.”

The Claimant also argues that the 2009 Set-Off Proceedings, which destroyed the

Claimant’s remaining 10% participation in Kozhan, violated the FET standard.*

According to the Claimant, the 2009 Set-Off Proceedings were legally flawed, especially
because the District Court failed to duly notify BSEK and Big Sky of the hearing.*#
Furthermore, the Claimant contends that the Bailiff’s conduct was contrary to the FET

standard and Kazakh law, especially because the Bailiff allegedly omitted to value the 10%

interest in Kozhan as it was required to do.*4°

Finally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent also breached the FET standard with
regard to the 2012 Set-Off Ruling and the IUS Award.“° Again, the Claimant alleges that

the 2012 Set-Off Ruling is not based on Kazakh law and violated basic procedural

7

guarantees,*4” and proceeds to list the various reasons for which the 2012 Set-Off

Proceeding was illogical, unreasoned and procedurally unfair.“

To conclude, the Claimant argues that the four proceedings in question in this arbitration
were run in contradiction of the Claimant’s basic procedural rights,**? displayed a manifest

lack of transparency,**” and eventually resulted in decisions that were “arbitrary, unfair,

unjust and idiosyncratic, and manifestly contrary to settled Kazakh law.”4!

(3) Article II(2)(b) of the BIT — Arbitrary or Discriminatory Measures

The Claimant also argues that the Respondent violated its obligation not to take any

arbitrary or discriminatory measures,*** as provided in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT:

“Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory
measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment,
acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute
resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or
discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has had or has exercised
the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative
tribunals of a Party.”

As the Claimant points out, referring inter alia to LG&E v. Argentina, the prohibition of

arbitrary measures is closely linked to the requirement of due process and the FET standard.

As such, arbitrary measures may be described as measures affecting investors or

investments “without engaging in a rational decision-making process.”*>4

The Claimant argues that the Respondent’s conduct leading to the alleged violation of the
FET standard amounts to discriminatory and arbitrary measures.*** The Claimant also
submits that these measures further violated the Respondent’s obligation not to

discriminate against foreign investors.*°°

(4) Article I1(6) of the BIT — Effective Means

The Claimant alleges a violation of the effective means provision contained in Article II(6)

of the BIT.**” Article II(6) of the BIT provides:

“Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing
rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment
authorizations.”*°

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s allegation that the effective means provision is
limited to a denial of justice protection.*°? Referring to Chevron-Texaco v. Ecuador,*® the
Claimant submits that effective means provisions in BITs generally prohibit host-States
from interfering with the exercise of the investor’s rights.*°! The Claimant contends, with

reference to AMTO v. Ukraine, that an effective means provision includes the guarantee of

foreign investors are entitled to expect that “a domestic court will (i) fairly and impartially
consider their arguments and evidence; (ii) render its decision on the basis of the rule of
law and without undue delay; and (iii) make the decision in an honest, independent, and
impartial way.”4°

The Claimant further submits that the Respondent’s courts blatantly failed to meet this

requirement throughout the four proceedings in dispute.**

(5) Article I1(2)(a) of the BIT — FPS.

The Claimant argues that the Respondent breached the FPS standard,*® protected under
Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

The Claimant contends that the FPS standard functions as a minimum standard,*® and that
it includes legal protection and not merely physical protection.*°’ Even though the
Claimant acknowledges that there is a divide among investment tribunals on this question,
it submits that the Tribunal should — by applying normal interpretation standards — consider
legal protection as a part of the FPS standard in order to guarantee “full” protection. The
Claimant submits that such an interpretation would also align with the purpose of the

BIT.*® Finally, the Claimant points out that the FPS standard is meant to protect the

470

investor from an infringement of its rights,*’” which includes the necessity of legal

security.*7!

The Claimant argues that the Respondent — even after being notified of the alleged

fraudulent conduct — failed to take action to protect the Claimant’s investment. According

to the Claimant, the General Prosecutor, its National Security Committee, its Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, its President and its Supreme Court, all knew about the alleged illicit
scheme involving the Three Oligarchs and failed to take action. On the contrary, the
Respondent allowed the Claimant’s investment to be negatively impacted by the court

proceedings in dispute.*””

Hence, the Claimant argues that “the facts demonstrate a total abrogation of Kazakhstan’s
collective responsibility [...] to exercise vigilance and due diligence to protect the

Claimant’s investment.”473

(6) Denial of Justice

Finally, the Claimant addresses the Respondent’s denial of justice arguments. The
Claimant considers that it is erroneous to argue, as the Respondent does, that the Claimant
has to establish a denial of justice no matter which treaty provision it relies upon.*”* The
Claimant alleges in this regard that the Respondent’s argument would dilute the different
treaty protections.*”° If the Tribunal were to follow the Respondent’s argument, the
Claimant considers that this deprives the treaty provisions of their effet utile.*”° Referring
to Saipem v. Bangladesh and Tatneft v. Ukraine, the Claimant dismisses the arbitral
decisions the Respondent relies upon, and in particular Jan de Nul v. Egypt, and submits
instead that acts or omissions of State organs may violate treaty protections even without

being qualified as a denial of justice.4””

Nevertheless, the Claimant submits that even if the standard of denial of justice were to be

the applicable standard, the Respondent would also have breached it.*”*

In particular, the Claimant submits that a denial of justice may occur under international
law in case of (i) a clearly improper and discreditable court judgment, (ii) a discreditable
decision which is offensive to judicial propriety, or (iii) where major procedural errors were
committed during the proceedings.‘”? The Claimant refers especially to the importance of

due process in this context.**°

The Claimant argues that numerous organs of the Respondent denied the Claimant
justice.**! The Claimant especially complains about the violation of its procedural rights

during the court proceedings in dispute in the present arbitration.**”

The Claimant contends that it exhausted local remedies against the disputed decisions as

far as reasonably possible.**?

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION ON THE MERITS
(dd) Standards of Protection
a. The Necessity for the Claimant to Establish a Denial of Justice

The Respondent argues that the applicable standard of protection against acts of the host
State’s judicial organs is the standard of denial of justice and that otherwise such a

complaint cannot succeed.*** Hence, the Respondent argues that the Claimant must

establish a denial of justice, whichever treaty protection is invoked.***

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 97 of 184

The Respondent refers to Liman v. Kazakhstan and Jan de Nul v. Egypt which considered
denial of justice as a category of the FET protection.**° According to the Respondent, these
tribunals considered that a FET claim because of judicial conduct must also meet the

requirements of a denial of justice in order not to circumvent this standard.*8”

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant failed to exhaust all possible local
remedies even though, in accordance with ICSID case law, and in particular in accordance
with Loewen v. United States, it should demonstrate that it did so in order to establish a

denial of justice.***

b. Article II(2)(a) of the BIT — FET

The Respondent notes that denial of justice should be considered as part of the FET
standard.**? Looking at the nature of the denial of justice standard under international law,
the Respondent asserts that denial of justice is necessarily procedural and does not include
the substantive correctness of a court decision.*”° Therefore the Respondent submits that a
denial of justice must meet high requirements, i.e. it must be shown that there was a

manifest injustice and a lack of due process so that the outcome of the proceeding offends

judicial propriety.*?!

The Respondent argues that because the Claimant cannot demonstrate that these
requirements are satisfied, it tries to “re-characterize” its claims by referring to other

standards of protection under the BIT.**? Yet, as the Respondent submits, the Claimant

essentially claims a denial of justice.*” Therefore, the Respondent asserts that the case law
cited by the Claimant on the general interpretation of the FET standard in the BIT is not
applicable because it allegedly does not concern FET violations by judicial misconduct.*”*
The Respondent refers to Jan de Nul v. Egypt to argue that the requirements of the denial
of justice cannot be circumvented by referring to general violations of the FET standard

(or other BIT protections for that matter).*°>

The Respondent submits that the Claimant was not able to establish a denial of justice and
therefore there cannot be any breach of the FET standard.**° The Respondent rejects the
Claimant’s argument that it is of little relevance to distinguish between a procedural and a
substantive aspect for a denial of justice.*?’ The Respondent emphasizes that a tribunal
may not act as a court of appeal for decisions of domestic courts.*”*

Additionally, the Respondent emphasizes that the denial of justice standard includes the
requirement of exhaustion of local remedies by the investor, i.e. that the judicial system

has failed as a whole, and submits that the Claimant failed to meet this requirement.*”°

The Respondent argues that the numerous irregularities which the Claimant advances

regarding domestic law are not sufficient to establish a denial of justice.*°”

Furthermore, the Respondent submits that the FET standard cannot be used for the
Claimant’s due diligence argument.*°! The Respondent argues that the notion of due

diligence is frequently invoked at the charge of the investor.*? Insofar as a due diligence

duty is invoked regarding the State, the Respondent considers that there is no jurisprudence

which supports the Claimant’s allegations.*°>

c. Article HI(1) of the BIT — Judicial Expropriation

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s allegations regarding expropriation.*** According
to the Respondent, a judicial expropriation can only be established when the requirements
of a denial of justice are also met, especially in the present case in which the Claimant

complains about an alleged misapplication of domestic law.*°

The Respondent argues that the jurisprudence on which the Claimant relies does not
support the Claimant’s case.*°° In particular, the Respondent considers the Claimant’s
reference to the Caratube IJ decision unsuitable because the cited passage concerned not
the BIT clause but the Kazakhstan 1994 Foreign Investment Law.*°” Furthermore, the
Respondent submits that the Claimant is also wrong to refer to CCL v. Kazakhstan which,
according to the Respondent, concerns the application of a domestic investment law and a
case in which the decisions were appealed.*** Additionally, and on similar grounds, the
Respondent attacks the Claimant’s reliance on the Saipem v. Bangladesh decision.*°? The
Respondent also rejects the comparison with the Sistem v. Kyrgyz Republic because the
claimants in these proceedings did not complain about the regularity of the domestic
proceedings nor did they address the distinction between denial of justice and
expropriation.*!°

Finally, the Respondent argues that the jurisprudence referred to by the Claimant to argue

the existence of an expropriation, independently from a denial of justice, is not relevant for

the present arbitration, since these decisions did not rule on the relationship between

expropriation and denial of justice.>!!

Ultimately, the Respondent submits that the Claimant failed to establish an expropriation
and allegedly did not even demonstrate that it was deprived of its investments.*!? In any
event, the Respondent asserts that an investor may only complain about an expropriation

if it has exhausted all local remedies beforehand.*'?

d. Article II(6) of the BIT — Effective Means

The Respondent furthermore rejects the Claimant’s allegations that it was not granted
effective means to enforce its rights.°'+ The Respondent submits that Article II(6) of the
BIT does not contain a standard of protection with lower requirements than the denial of
justice provision.*!> Therefore, the standard of effective means includes the establishment

of national rules and structures to guarantee due process but no further standard.>!°

The Respondent points out in particular that the decisions relied on by the Claimant
(Chevron v. Ecuador (No. 1) and White Industries Australia Ltd. v. Republic of India)
should not be followed because they did not address the question whether allowing a
Claimant to plead a standard other than denial of justice could be considered to lower the

requirements of the respective standard of protection.*!”

e. Article II(2)(a) of the BIT — FPS

considers that it corresponds basically to the FET submissions and must therefore also be

rejected on the same grounds.*'* The Respondent argues that the FPS standard includes
physical protection but not legal protection and refers in support of this view to the Suez v.
Argentina decision.*'? The Respondent further argues that the invocation of other
provisions via the MFN clause is not possible for the reasons explained regarding the FET

standard, i.e. that those further provisions do not include an independent guarantee.*”°

Furthermore, the Respondent addresses the Claimant’s allegations of due diligence and
submits that the FPS standard does not include an absolute guarantee.**! The Respondent
considers that it fulfilled its due diligence duty because it provides a functioning judicial

system.*?

was accordingly, as the Respondent submits, no violation of the principle of due process.*””
The substantive correctness of the court decisions cannot, according to the Respondent,

constitute a BIT breach.*”8

b. The 2008 ABT Proceedings

The Respondent also rejects the Claimant’s contentions regarding the 2008 ABT
Proceedings and considers that this decision does not violate any BIT provisions.*”° The
Respondent submits that the Claimant refused to participate in the proceedings and could

therefore not have been denied justice.**°

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that even if BSEK participated in the proceedings, it

did not advance the arguments on which the Claimant relies in the present arbitration.**!

c. The 2009 Set-Off Proceedings

The Respondent considers that the allegations regarding the 2009 Set-Off Proceedings are
equally unfounded.**? The Respondent submits again that the Claimant and BSEK decided
not to participate in the proceedings.*? The Respondent submits that no breach of

international law can be argued because the Claimant failed to exhaust local remedies.***

Furthermore, the Respondent argues that even though it considers that the decision was
legally correct, the correctness of the decision is of no relevance for the question of a breach

of the BIT.**°

d. The 2012 Set-Off Proceedings

The Respondent argues again that the Claimant essentially complains about the alleged
incorrectness of the 2012 Set-Off Proceedings with regard to Kazakh law.>*° The
Respondent submits again that the Claimant failed to participate in the proceedings.**” The
Respondent also argues that with regard to the appeal proceedings Big Sky and BSEK
appeared interchangeably in front of Kazakh courts.*** Finally, the Respondent submits
that the decision was in accordance with Kazakh law but that the correctness of the decision

is of no relevance for the question of a violation of the BIT.**°

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS
(dd) Denial of Justice

Because of its relevance to the other claims, the Tribunal chooses to begin with the

allegation of denial of justice.

This case, as articulated by the Claimant, boils down to relevant court decisions and their
ultimate effect on the Claimant’s investment. The issue here is not whether the Tribunal is
simply convinced of the merit of the underlying allegations in such legal proceedings.
While the merit is of course at issue, in that the underlying proceedings are certainly
relevant to analyzing whether the applicable court decisions amounted to a denial of justice,
the Tribunal stresses that it is not an international court of appeal established to review the

determinations made by the Kazakh courts.
Instead, as the Claimant highlights, the applicable test has been described as when:

“at an international level and having regard to generally accepted standards
of the administration of justice, a tribunal can conclude in the light of all the
available facts that the impugned decision was clearly improper and

discreditable, with the result that the investment has been subjected to unfair
and inequitable treatment.”*4°

The Claimant has provided alternate formulations, but the core principles remain

consistent.*4!

The inquiry then is not whether this Tribunal is of the view that the Kazakh courts arrived
at incorrect conclusions of law in the relevant proceedings. Instead, the Claimant’s burden
requires to convince the Tribunal that the proceedings displayed such impropriety as to

render them null as a matter of international law.

Throughout the arbitration, in the written submissions and at the Hearing, the Claimant
provided numerous examples of judicial conduct that it considered flawed. The Tribunal
below individually addresses acts that form the basis of the Claimant’s arguments. The

alleged wrongful conduct that is addressed in this section includes:

e Whether the Appellate Collegium improperly prejudged the merits when it remitted
the 2003 SPA case back to the District Court;

e Whether the Supervisory Collegium violated the requirement to state reasons when
it declined to open a supervisory review of the Appellate Collegium’s decision
allegedly prejudging the case for the District Court in the second phase of the 2003
SPA Proceeding;

e The District Court’s decision to take jurisdiction over Ms. Tulegenova’s claim and
to add Mr. Baikenov as a new defendant;

e The District Court’s refusal to summon Mr. Baikenov as a witness;

e Reaching a final, non-appealable, judgment in the 2003 SPA Proceeding despite
the withdrawal of the claims by the plaintiff spouses Ms. Tulegenova and
Mr. Seidagaliev;

364. The Claimant’s denial of justice claim concerns the totality of the various alleged acts by

the Respondent’s judicial system, as opposed to each individual allegation.

a. Whether the Appellate Collegium improperly prejudged the merits when it
remitted the 2003 SPA case back to the District Court

365. The Claimant relies on Article 363(2) of the Civil Procedure Code, which states that:

“[t]he court hearing the case in the appellate proceeding shall not prejudge
the issue on credibility or non-credibility of a particular piece of evidence,

on the priority of one evidence over the other, as well as on what decision
shall be made on a new hearing of the case.”**7

Relying on the wording of this statute, the Claimant contends that the Court of Appeal
improperly reached fresh merits findings that: (i) the 2003 SPA was subject to mandatory
notarization and thus required notarized spousal consent; (ii) the 2003 SPA was subject to
mandatory state registration and thus required notarized spousal consent; and (iii) BSEK
could not rely on the statutory presumption of consent to the 2003 SPA by spouses of the

Original Owners.*#
Professor Abzhanov opines that:

“when there has been a breach of substantive law by the lower court, the
court of appeal shall not remand the case for a new hearing but rather shall
itself decide it on the merits by applying correct substantive law. However,
when there has been a violation of procedural law, the court of appeal shall
remand the case for a new hearing and give the lower court specific
procedural instructions without, however, prejudging the merits. It is
obvious that when there have been both procedural and substantive law
violations, the court of appeal shall follow the route for procedural
violations because the first instance court has priority for dealing with
procedural matters and hearing evidence. Indeed, if the court of appeal were
allowed in these circumstances to apply the substantive law itself,
remanding the case for a new hearing on procedural grounds would become
moot because, regardless of the procedural actions taken by the first
instance court, the result on the merits would be already prejudged based on
the rules of substantive law.”*“+

The Tribunal finds some flaws in this reasoning. Professor Abzhanov does not contest that
the court of appeal can make decisions on the merits by applying the correct substantive
law. In fact, he claims this is mandated. He suggests, however, that in the presence of
procedural errors as well as violations of substantive law, the court of appeal must refrain
from coming to conclusions on the substantive law because doing so would prejudge the

merits. There is an inherent contradiction in this reasoning. If the goal was truly for the

court of appeal to refrain from making pronouncements on the correct application of
substantive law, it would be prohibited from doing so in all cases, instead of being
affirmatively required to do so, at least in the absence of procedural violations. Professor
Abzhanov therefore appears to be criticizing the court of appeal for doing what he admits
is a regular duty of the court. Now, one could perhaps argue that remanding the case for a
new hearing on procedural grounds when the correct application of substantive law has
been clarified by the Court of Appeal could amount to a potential waste of time, if the result
on the merits would be prejudged by such a ruling on the substantive law, as Professor
Abzhanoy claims. But this is hardly the same as the Court of Appeal going beyond its

proper role in addressing such substantive law issues.
It is understandable why the Respondent makes the argument that:

“it is impossible as a matter of common sense to see how any appellate court

could in practice provide a reasoned judgment setting aside a decision of

the lower court for violation or misapplication of the law without explaining

the basis for its findings by reference to the proper interpretation of that

law.7545
Whether it is “impossible” or not, the Tribunal understands that it would certainly not be
the norm, as again, Professor Abzhanov admits that the Court of Appeal, at least in cases
without procedural violations, shall indeed clarify the proper application of the substantive

law in the case of a substantive law violation.

In any way, the fact that the Court of Appeal reached conclusions on the merits while also
making rulings on procedural errors does not amount to a violation of international law.
Therefore, the Tribunal finds no issue with the Supervisory Collegium’s actions in this

respect.

b. Whether the Supervisory Collegium violated the requirement to state reasons
when it declined to open a supervisory review of the Appellate Collegium’s
decision allegedly prejudging the case for the District Court in the second
Phase of the 2003 SPA Proceeding

In its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, the Respondent provided a lengthy excerpt from
the relevant Supervisory Collegium decision declining supervisory review.*“° It need not
be repeated here. In the decision, the Supervisory Collegium quite clearly rejects the
presence of improper prejudgment.**” The Claimant seems to contend that a statement
rejecting the presence of improper prejudgment is an insufficient reason for the Supervising

Collegium’s decision to decline review for alleged prejudgment.*4*

The Tribunal understands that the Claimant perhaps desired a lengthier discussion of the
legal issues, but it has failed to provide evidence establishing such a requirement. As
highlighted by the Respondent, the Supervisory Collegium, through its statement,
demonstrated that it considered and rejected the allegation of improper prejudgment. The

Tribunal finds this sufficient.

Further, the Respondent notes that the Claimant could have appealed this ruling to the
Supervisory Collegium of the Supreme Court but failed to do so. As is the theme in a few
aspects of the Claimant’s case (discussed in more detail for certain claims), the failure to
exhaust local remedies is quite detrimental to a case based on improper court action,

whether or not it is under the denial of justice prong of a particular dispute.

c. The District Court’s decision to take jurisdiction over Ms. Tulegenova’s claim
and to add Mr. Baikenov as a new defendant

The Claimant contends that the District Court’s decision to allow Ms. Tulegenova to file a

third-party claim against her husband, Mr. Baikenov, violated procedural norms.*4?

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 109 of 184

Specifically, the Claimant contends that Ms. Tulegenova’s third party claim was “nothing

more than a repetition of the other spouses’ existing claims with her own tagged on.”°°°

There are three possible requirements necessary for the court to have taken jurisdiction

over Ms. Tulegenova’s claim. These are discussed below.

(i) | Pursuant to Article 52 of the Civil Procedure Code, a third party can only
file a claim in relation to an already-existing subject-matter

A primary disagreement under this factor is whether the 2003 SPA should have been
treated as a unitary transaction or as five separate transactions.*°! In this respect the
Tribunal finds convincing the Respondent’s focus on the structure of the agreement, *°?
which suggests it should properly be taken as a single unitary transaction. It is correct that
Ms. Tulegenova’s claim would have necessarily concerned only the 18% commonly owned
by her and her husband. However, with the overall transaction already at the heart of the
dispute, it can hardly be said that filing a claim concerning that 18% fails to relate to an

already existing subject-matter of the dispute.

(ii) The third-party claim may be filed only against one or both of the already
existing parties to the dispute

Here, the Claimant’s contention is that by adding Mr. Baikenov as a defendant,
Ms. Tulegenova necessarily made a claim against someone who was not an already

existing party to the dispute. In other words, she added a party.

interest and not the individual 18% interests of each Original Owner; (d) the 2003 SPA does not provide for
a mechanism where the “Purchase Price” is refundable pro rata by each of the Original Owners in the event
of a breach of its terms”).

The Parties disagree as to whether, under this rule, a third-party claim must be filed against
an already existing party or whether the third-party claim can only be filed against an

already existing party.

While Professor Abzhanov suggests the latter is true, the Respondent is correct that
Professor Abzhanov fails to point to any legal authority when making this claim.** The
Respondent’s experts endorse the former theory, and to support this position highlight
Article 52 of the Code of Civil Procedure which they indicate guarantees a third party the
same rights and obligations as a plaintiff, including the right to file a claim against a new

defendant.**+

Neither Party has produced definitive evidence concerning the proper application of this
limitation to third-party claims. Accordingly, the Tribunal finds the Respondent’s
interpretation plausible. More importantly, the Tribunal concludes that this requirement
was met as, in addition to adding a defendant, Ms. Tulegenova clearly filed claims against

already-existing parties.

(iii) The third-party claim must exclude the claims of other parties

There is disagreement over the extent to which this is an actual requirement. It is undisputed

that it was not met, as even the Respondent’s expert has acknowledged as such.**>

Professor Abzhanov points to the Commentary to the Code of Civil Procedure, which
reads, “The Plaintiff's claim and the claim of the third party having an independent claim
to the subject matter of dispute do not coincide but exclude each other.”9°°

In response, Professor Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin contend that “it is wrong to
accept the limitation set out in the Commentary to the Code of Civil Procedure as a rule

which would apply to all possible situations,” instead arguing that, “[w]hen considering

the issue of third parties joining proceedings for the invalidation of a transaction, the

conditions and specifics of the transaction should be taken into account.”°*”

In making this claim, the Respondent’s experts submit as an exhibit a note concerning third
parties joining proceedings of the Arbitrazh Court of Voronezhskaya.*°* While not
controlling, the note highlights a practice in a system that is obviously quite influential on

the Respondent’s practice. The note reads, in part:

“[iJn essence, the claims of third parties having independent claims to the
subject matter of the dispute are aimed as “substituting” the claims of the
plaintiff and (or) the counterclaims of defendants. In some cases, such
claims may supplement the original claims. For example, if the protection
of the plaintiff violated rights under the original claim does not constitute
the grounds for the claims to be satisfied in full, a third party having
independent claims to the subject matter of the dispute joining the case can
ensure full satisfaction of the claims. A corporate dispute where the plaintiff
(member of a corporation) disputes the decision of the corporation in its
entirety while his rights and legitimate interests are affected only by part of
the decision can serve as an example. In this situation, another member of
the corporation joining the proceedings as a third party having independent
claims to the subject matter of the dispute whose rights and legitimate
interests have been affected by a different part of the impugned decision is
a prerequisite for the claims to be satisfied in full.”>?

The Respondent’s experts thus claim that various situations can occur which would not fit
into the limiting interpretation provided by the Commentary to the Code of Civil Procedure

relied upon by Professor Abzhanov.*°

The Tribunal is hesitant to rely on a legal note concerning a Russian practice in the face of
limiting language contained in Kazakh legal commentary. However, the Tribunal once
again is not in a position to review Kazakh court decisions in an appellate capacity and is
instead tasked with determining whether certain determinations fall astray of international
law. Here, the commentary provided by the Respondent’s experts, while from a different,

yet comparable legal system, does appear to provide a logical justification for permitting

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 112 of 184

third party claims in some scenarios that do not fully exclude the claims of other parties.
Like the example provided for in the excerpt quoted by Professor Tlegenova and Dr.
Mukhamedshin, here it would appear that permitting a third party having independent
claims to the subject-matter, whose rights and interests are separate than those of the other

plaintiffs, would best permit the claims of the dispute to be satisfied in full.

Accordingly, without definitively ruling on whether meeting this requirement was
necessary for taking jurisdiction over Ms. Tulegenova’s claim, the Tribunal finds
insufficient evidence establishing that the court’s judgment was fatally flawed in permitting

her claim despite the fact that it did not exclude all other claims.

d. The District Court’s refusal to summon Mr. Baikenov as a witness

The Claimant contends that the Court of Appeal expressly directed the District Court to
hear from Mr. Baikenov personally, and thus it became mandatory to call him as a
witness.**! In doing so, the Claimant relies on the following two excerpts from the Court

of Appeal’s ruling (the first one also being referred to by the Respondent):

“K.K. Baikenov and his spouse were denied the possibility to participate in
the proceeding which directly affected their rights and interests protected
by the law. In particular, those not joined persons could have provided
additional information to the court regarding the circumstances of entering
into and (or) performance of the sale and purchase agreement, the existence
or lack of consent of K.K. Baikenov’s spouse to entering into the impugned
transaction, ete.”°°

“At the new hearing, the court shall rectify the abovementioned violations
of [...] the rules of procedural law committed in this case, give proper legal
consideration to the evidence collected, and resolve the dispute in
accordance with the rules of substantive and procedural law.”*°

While the excerpts of course indicate there was the possibility that Mr. Baikenov could
have provided additional, relevant information, the Tribunal is not convinced that these
excerpts constitute a mandate for the District Court to call Mr. Baikenov as a witness. To
the contrary, as highlighted by the Respondent, these excerpts appear primarily concerned
with protecting the rights of Mr. Baikenov and Ms. Tulegenova, as opposed to forcing the

participation of Mr. Baikenov in a manner considered desirable by BSEK.

The next point of contention concerns the appropriateness of calling Mr. Baikenov as a
witness considering his position as a defendant. This area of dispute is complicated by its
relation to the Claimant’s overall allegation of the illicit scheme to use the court system to
deprive it of its investment, with Mr. Baikenov being inappropriately labelled as a

“defendant.”

The Respondent’s expert focuses primarily on Mr. Baikenov’s status as a defendant in the
sense that this procedural manoeuvre granted Mr. Baikenov “much wider rights than that

of a witness.” Professor Tlegenova further stresses that:

“[t]he status of a defendant enables a person to actively seek a favourable

outcome of a case by using the whole spectrum of available procedural

rights. I do not see how the status of witness could improve Mr. Baikenov’s

procedural opportunities compared to those which are provided with the

status of defendant.”>
The Claimant is correct in that this justification misses the point. BSEK was clearly not
concerned with Mr. Baikenov’s ability to defend himself but rather that Mr. Baikenov had
knowledge that BSEK considered crucial to its own defence. To imply that Mr. Baikenov’s
increased ability to defend himself was relevant to BSEK’s defence, especially considering
the overarching allegations of this case, is disingenuous. To argue that, as a result of
Mr. Baikenov’s position as a defendant, “[i]t follows that there were no procedural benefits
to be gained (for either Big Sky Canada or Mr. Baikenov) from summoning Mr. Baikenov

as a witness” lacks credibility.*°° BSEK quite justifiably did not consider its interests to be

aligned with those of Mr. Baikenov and was thus focused on potential testimony that would
support its position in court. The Tribunal thus finds this justification for failing to call Mr.

Baikenov unconvincing.

Finally, the Parties dispute whether BSEK actually requested that the court summon Mr.
Baikenov as a witness. The Tribunal also finds this justification unconvincing. BSEK
undoubtedly requested that it be permitted to interrogate Mr. Baikenov as a witness.*° This
attempt was unsuccessful. The court subsequently had the opportunity to call Mr. Baikenov
as a witness and chose not to. Accordingly, while BSEK has failed to produce evidence
that it again tried to request that Mr. Baikenov testify as a defendant, the Tribunal is not

convinced this is the reason the court failed to do so.

Ultimately, it is quite obvious why BSEK wished to call Mr. Baikenov as a witness, and
the subsequent Joint Statements revealing the questionable nature of the claims present in
the case demonstrate that the desire was quite justified. However, the Claimant has failed
to produce evidence establishing more than a very questionable use of the court’s
discretion. The Tribunal is of the opinion that Mr. Baikenov could have provided crucial
testimony, but it is unconvinced that as a clear matter of law, the District Court was
necessarily required to summon him to testify let alone that the failure to fulfil such a

requirement amounts to a violation of international law.
e. Reaching a final, non-appealable, judgment in the 2003 SPA Proceeding

despite the withdrawal of the claims by the plaintiff spouses Ms. Tulegenova
and Mr. Seidagaliev

The Claimant’s position here is twofold: (1) the withdrawal of claims should have been
accepted by the court; and (2) even if the withdrawal had not been accepted, the withdrawal

statement should have served as convincing evidence on the merits.

Concerning the first issue, the Joint Expert Report of Professor Tlegenova and

Dr. Mukhamedshin describes the issue of withdrawal of claims as follows:

“The supervisory instance is only concerned with verifying the lawfulness
and justiciability of lower courts’ decisions, and the only grounds for

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 115 of 184

applying to the supervisory instance are significant violations of substantive
or procedural law. A party that has lodged an appeal with the Supreme Court
is permitted to withdraw the appeal, in which case the decision of the lower
court will stand. However, it is not possible to withdraw the claim at the
supervisory level as, of course, the claim itself will, by this stage, have
already been determined by the lower court, and a judgment given and
entered into legal force. The party would have to apply for the setting aside
of the judgment.”**

Further, Professor Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin conclude that “even if the Joint
Statements could have been regarded as a withdrawal of the claims properly filed with the
court of first or appellate instance, no court would have accepted them since they were filed
in breach of the procedural law by an unauthorised person.”°* Professor Tlegenova and
Dr. Mukhamedshin come to this conclusion based on the understanding that proper powers
of attorney were not issued by Ms. Tulegenova and Mr. Seidagaliev to the representative

of BSEK, as required under CPC Article 61.°°
Professor Abzhanov provided a different view, namely that:

“each party has a fundamental right at any stage of the proceeding to
‘choose [its] position, means and instruments of its protections
independently and separately from the court, other organs and persons.’
Therefore, if the plaintiff decides to withdraw its claim and thus confirms
that, from its perspective, there is no ‘violat[ion] or dispute[]’ concerning
the rights, freedoms and legitimate interests of that person, the court has no
business to act on the claim because there is nothing more to ‘protect[]’ in
the first place.”>”°

It is not the Tribunal’s role to interpret the Respondent’s procedural requirements for
withdrawal of claims and to apply such interpretation. Again, the Claimant must show that
the relevant proceedings displayed such impropriety as to render them problematic as a
matter of international law. The Tribunal questions the Respondent’s experts’ contention

that it is not possible to withdraw a claim at the supervisory level. However, the Tribunal

is not persuaded that the Court’s failure to allow the withdrawal of the claim amounts to a

violation of international law.

The Claimant further stresses that such an interpretation would make it impossible for the
plaintiff to settle a claim after the first court decision entered into force.*”'! Professor
Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin clarify that as soon as a court decision enters into force,
the plaintiff and defendant become creditor and debtor, and thus “[tJhe parties can [...]
enter into a settlement agreement in relation to the judgment and terminate the enforcement
proceedings (as opposed to the termination of court proceedings aimed at resolving the
dispute).”°7? The Tribunal finds this interpretation reasonable and certainly not “clearly

improper and discreditable.”

With respect to whether the withdrawal statements should have been considered as
evidence on the merits, the Respondent does seem to admit that such a procedure was at
least permissible,*” and evidence provided by the Respondent’s experts appears to confirm
this. Specifically, the “Normative Regulation of the Supreme Court of the Republic of
Kazakhstan dated 20 March 2003 No. 2: On the Application of Some Rules of Civil

Procedure Legislation by Courts” provides in part:

“A supervisory instance court cannot amend or annul a court act, which was
entered into legal force, based on the evidence submitted by a party, that
was not examined by a court of first or appellate instance. Subject to the
existence of relevant grounds, such court act can be reviewed based upon
discovery of new circumstances.”>”+

The issue thus turns to whether the Supreme Court improperly chose not to.

Professor Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin first focus on the general premise that the
Supreme Court is obligated to examine only the materials in the case file and does not have

the right to change or overturn the relevant judicial act that has come into force on the basis

of evidence submitted by a party that was not examined by the lower court.°”> The Tribunal
does not find this convincing, as again (i) the Normative Regulation cited by Professor
Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin provides for the use of newly-discovered
evidence/circumstances, as admitted by the Respondent;*”° and (ii) BSEK did not initially
have access to the testimony of Mr. Seidagaliev and Ms. Tulegenova. The Tribunal agrees
with Professor Abzhanov that it cannot reasonably be the case that the Supreme Court was
unable to evaluate evidence that was prevented by the lower court from being obtained,
precisely because it was not obtained and submitted to the lower court.>””

Professor Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin attempt to resist this interpretation by arguing
that it was not BSEK who produced this “new evidence” but rather Ms. Tulegenova,
Mr. Seidagaliev, Mr. Baikenov and Ms. Asanova, and these four individuals had never
asked the lower court for any help in obtaining evidence and provided no explanation as to
why such statements could not have been provided in the lower court.>”’ The Tribunal does
not find this argument convincing either. As highlighted by Professor Abzhanov, BSEK
lacked access to the testimony of Ms. Tulegenova and Mr. Seidagaliev and their spouses,
despite petitioning the lower court to secure their attendance at the hearing and to call
Mr. Baikenov for examination as a witness.°”? While the Joint Statements of course could
have theoretically been submitted to the lower court had the declarants made and submitted
such statements, that is not the issue. BSEK, through no discernible fault of its own, lacked
access to such evidence and was thus unable to present it to the lower court. After procuring
such new evidence, it argues the Supreme Court should have evaluated it in the confines

of the merits, which the Respondent admits was at least in theory permitted.

While the Tribunal is unsure why the Supreme Court would fail to consider and discuss
the Joint Statements as evidence on the merits, it cannot come to the conclusion that the

Supreme Court’s decision was so clearly flawed as to constitute a violation of international

law. The Claimant has successfully convinced the Tribunal that the Supreme Court could
have used such evidence, and the Tribunal sees the value in such evidence, but the Tribunal
is not convinced that the Tribunal had an obligation to accept, analyze and discuss the Joint
Statements in its evaluation of the merits of this case, such that the failure to fulfil this
obligation would amount to a violation of international law. Based on the views expressed
by the experts, it does appear to be the exception to the norm that new evidence is
highlighted in such a proceeding, as the Supreme Court generally evaluates cases based on
the lower court record. The Supreme Court would have had to have been convinced (i) that
under the applicable rules it cou/d use the Joint Statements as evidence on the merits; that
(ii) with all circumstances accounted for it should use such statements; and (iii) that any
such evaluation renders it necessary to openly discuss how such statements play into its
ultimate ruling. There are undoubtedly subjective aspects to this multi-layered analysis,
and the Tribunal is not prepared to characterize the Supreme Court’s judgment in this

respect as fatally flawed.

f Failing to consider or decide dispositive evidence and arguments submitted
to the court demonstrating that the plaintiff spouses had failed to prove that
BSEK knew or should have known of their alleged disagreement to the 2003

SPA
A major part of this arbitration comes down to the application of Article 33(2) of the
Matrimony Law to the spousal consent at issue in this case. There are two main issues
within this analysis, which are whether: (i) Article 33(3) of the Matrimony Law applies to
the spousal consent in this case; and (ii) even if Article 33(3) does apply, the presumption

of spousal consent contained in Article 33(2) applies.
(i) Application of Article 33(3) of the Matrimony Law
The Tribunal heard from the Parties at considerable length on this point, in written

submissions and by way of oral testimony at the Hearing.

The issue has two layers of analysis: (i) whether the agreement became subject to
mandatory spousal consent under Article 33(3) as a result of the decision of the parties to
the 2003 SPA to notarize the agreement; and (ii) whether the 2003 SPA was subject to

mandatory registration.

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 119 of 184

On the first issue, the Tribunal finds the correct application of Article 33(3) to be quite
unclear. Both Parties have provided plausible expert testimony and relevant legal authority

supporting their conflicting legal theories.

The Claimant is quite correct that the plain text of the statute would suggest that voluntary
notarization of an agreement would not result in mandatory spousal consent, as such
voluntary notarization of the agreement would not appear to alter the nature of the
underlying transaction. Article 33(3)’s requirement that “transactions subject to mandatory
notarisation” be subject to notarized spousal consent would appear to concern the nature
of such transaction. In other words, the plain meaning of the text would suggest that
whether notarized spousal agreement is required would depend on the type of transaction

at issue, not how such a transaction is ultimately executed.

Further, Professor Abzhanov has provided numerous examples, from court decisions to
legal opinions, suggesting that the voluntary notarization of a transaction, or even a
notary’s decision to notarize a transaction out of an abundance of caution, does not

transform the underlying transaction into one requiring notarization under Article 33(3).>°°

Now while it is true that the Respondent spends significant time going through the
examples listed by Professor Abzhanov to challenge his claim that there is generally
universal acceptance of the position that voluntary notarization of a transaction does not
render it a transaction subject to mandatory notarization, the Tribunal need not comb
through such arguments at this time. Suffice it to say that Professor Abzhanov has provided
ample reason for the Tribunal to conclude, absent contradicting authority, that Article 33(3)

may well operate in the way he suggests.

An in-depth discussion of the Respondent’s challenges to Professor Abzhanov’s authorities
is not necessary because, as is often stressed in this award, the Tribunal is not here to act
as a court of appeal to definitively rule on the proper application of Article 33(3) under
Kazakh law. Accordingly, if it is sufficiently convinced by the Respondent’s case in the
affirmative on the proper application of Article 33(3), that is, to the point where the

Tribunal cannot conclusively rule that the Respondent’s courts’ application was so flawed
as to constitute a violation of international law, the relative persuasiveness of Professor
Abzhanov’s sources becomes less important as the Tribunal can reject the Claimant’s
position even while accepting the Claimant’s significant authority on this particular aspect

of the legal dispute.
With that the Tribunal moves to the Respondent’s interpretation.

Professor Zhanaidarov and Dr. Daulenov argue that Article 154(1) of the Civil Code
requires notarization of a transaction if the parties agree to notarize this transaction.**!

Article 154(1) provides:

“In cases established by the legislative acts or by an agreement of the
parties, written transactions are considered to be completed only after their
notarization. Failure to comply with the requirement of notarization shall
entail invalidation of the transaction with the consequences provided for by
paragraph 3 of Article 157 of this Code.”***
According to the Respondent’s experts, pursuant to this statute, by agreeing that a
transaction be notarized, the transaction is therefore not completed until such notarization
is obtained. If the transaction cannot be completed without such notarization, it has
consequently been transformed into an agreement requiring notarization. Therefore,
Article 33(3) would apply despite the fact that the nature of the underlying agreement may

not be of the type that would ordinarily be subject to mandatory notarization.

The Respondent’s experts also note that pursuant to Article 220(3) of the Civil Code,
“[w]hen making transactions requiring notarization [...], the consent of other participants

in joint ownership of the transaction shall be notarized.”**°

The Tribunal is not convinced that by agreeing to notarize an agreement, parties to that
agreement transform the agreement into one requiring notarization. This would especially

appear to be the case considering that the parties, after having agreed amongst themselves

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 121 of 184

to notarize, could have just ignored this internal agreement or could have even forgotten
about such a plan, and the transaction would have been legitimately executed because of
no external requirement to notarize. Because of this theoretical possibility, it would seem
that even the decision or intention of the parties to voluntarily notarize fails to transform it
into a transaction requiring such notarization, absent an explicit executed agreement to
mandate such notarization. Now, the Respondent could disagree with this hypothesis by
arguing that it is not the agreement or intention to notarize that transforms the nature of the
agreement, but the actual moment of voluntary notarization. But this position would be an
even weaker argument, as a transaction would be considered to require notarization

exclusively after such notarization would have taken place.

The Tribunal is mindful of Professor Abzhanov’s additional criticisms of the Respondent’s
theory,*** and finds convincing the basic premise that the plain meaning of Article 33(3)
seems to suggest that the mandatory nature of the notarization of certain transactions relates

to the nature of the type of transaction at issue — here, the transfer of interest in an LLP.

However, the authority put forth by the Respondent prevents the Tribunal from arriving at
a definitive view of the proper application of Article 33(3) to transactions voluntarily
notarized, and thus ultimately prevents the Tribunal from arriving at such a definitive view
in favour of the Claimant’s interpretation as to characterize such an application of Article

33(3) as flawed to an extent to trigger international law concerns.

Further, while not presented by either Party as a legal expert, the Tribunal takes note of
testimony given by Mr. Ogai that suggests, despite his opinion that such practice was
legally incorrect, Kazakh courts had fairly regularly been willing to invalidate these types

of transactions when spouses later complained of a lack of consent:

“We had a lot of internal discussions and fights about this, or disputes within
our group about this in particular, whether there was a mistake or not. There
were opinions of lawyers who are specialists in Kazakh law who say that
when there is an interest in a company, that the notarised spousal consent is
not required. Unfortunately, judicial practice has shown a different path,
and in actual fact the courts have all taken the same position, which is that

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 122 of 184

supposedly the spouses had been deceived. And in spite of the

consequences, in spite of the reasons, they therefore decided to withdraw

those agreements and to declare them invalid. So that’s what the practice

has shown. In this particular case we felt that those who were claimants,

they knew about this judicial practice. And it’s possible they said, ‘Hey, we

could take a look at this, and we could do this too and get our property back.”

We felt -- and I at that time, as a lawyer, felt -- that a notarised spousal

consent was not necessary. And even if the spouse had some kind of

complaint or some kind of claim -- so let’s say my wife sold something, and

I’m her spouse, I wouldn’t have anything to do with that. It’s my own

personal opinion. But practice at the time, the practice was the other way.

Now the practice may have changed a bit, but at that time the practice was

solidly on the other side.”**>
This testimony adds at least an additional layer of credibility to the view that, prior to the
Normative Resolution of July 10, 2008, the courts’ approach to this legal issue was in a
sense inconsistent and unclear. This makes it more difficult for the Tribunal to come to a
definitive conclusion as to the proper application of Article 33(3). The Tribunal agrees with
the Claimant that the timing of the Normative Resolution seems odd, with the Supreme
Court seeming to clarify/confirm a legal issue in a manner inconsistent with a recent ruling
of its own, but this does not change the fact that the pre-Normative Resolution application

of Article 33(3) was not uniform.

Further, it should be noted that Mr. Heysel testified that there was even a discussion at the
board level about filing legal action against their own legal representation for their failure
to obtain the notarized spousal consent.**° While Mr. Heysel ultimately testified that they
chose not to pursue legal action because of the belief that such notarized consent was
unnecessary,°®” the discussion about such a possibility highlights the fact that, given the
legal environment at the time, it could have arguably been foreseen that failing to obtain

such notarized consent could be problematic.

Because the Tribunal does not consider the application of Article 33(3) due to the voluntary

notarization of the 2003 SPA to be fatally flawed, it need not inquire as to whether the 2003

SPA was subject to mandatory registration. Such analysis is further unnecessary as the
Claimant correctly highlights that the relevant court decision alleged to have expropriated

the Claimant’s investment made no finding on this issue.***

(ii) Whether Article 33(2) applies to transactions falling under Article 33(3) of
the Matrimony Law
The Claimant contends that even if Article 33(3) applied to the 2003 SPA, Article 33(2)
still applied and thus the plaintiffs still had to prove that BSEK knew or should have known
of their alleged disagreement to the 2003 SPA.**?

While the Tribunal acknowledges that the Kazakh courts have not appeared to treat this
issue uniformly, it finds at least plausible the rather basic line of reasoning provided by the
Respondent and its experts. That is, if Article 33(3) explicitly requires notarized spousal
consent, such a requirement would appear to be inconsistent with the presumption of
spousal consent contained in Article 33(2) (i.e., unless it can be proven that the other party
knew or should have known of the disagreement).*”° It would not appear to follow that it
must be proven that the other party to a transaction lacked knowledge of spousal consent
if the applicable statute affirmatively requires notarized spousal consent. The mere lack of
the required notarized consent would seem sufficient to put the other party to the

transaction on notice that a consent issue is present.

This interpretation is bolstered by the remedy provided for in Article 33(3): “[t]he spouse
whose notarized consent to the said transaction was not obtained has the right to claim
invalidation of the transaction by court within a year from the day when he or she knew or
should have known about the transaction.”**! Such a remedy is based on the presence of
the required notarized consent and the spouse’s knowledge of such a transaction. This

remedy does not concern the knowledge of disagreement of the other party or the

transaction. Importantly, the plain language of the statute does not even require such a

disagreement — merely the lack of notarized consent.

Overall, the Respondent’s interpretation follows a logical flow — (i) notarized consent is
required; (ii) if no notarized consent it present, there is no issue of whether the other party
is aware of possible disagreement because the explicitly-required notarized consent is
lacking; and (iii) the spouse, whose notarized consent is required, can claim invalidation
of the transaction due to the lack of such notarized consent, within a specified period upon

learning of the transaction. The Tribunal finds this interpretation plausible.
Professor Abzhanov’s description of this interplay is not as persuasive. He contends that:

“Article 33(2) of the Matrimony Law is designed to protect the good faith
acquirer of property from the spouse’s claims. That protection comes in the
form of the presumption of the spouse’s consent to the transaction made by
the other spouse. When the spouse who disposed of the jointly owned
property failed to obtain spousal consent, including in the notarized form of
certain types of transactions stated in Article 33(3) of the Matrimony Law,
that does not automatically mean that the acquirer of that property shall bear
the adverse consequences. The acquirer can always rely on the presumption
of consent. It is only when the plaintiff spouse proves that the acquirer in
fact knew or should have known of the spouse’s disagreement to the
transaction (i.e. that the acquirer was not acting in good faith) that the
presumption of consent is not available (and consequently the transaction
can be invalidated by the court).”*°

The fundamental flaw in this reasoning is that the acquirer should be able to rely on the
presumption of consent despite the lack of notarized consent that is explicitly required by
statute. This is a far cry from the scenario where no such notarized consent is required and
an acquirer perhaps lacks any means of confirming spousal consent. In such a scenario, it
seems reasonable to permit the acquirer to presume consent, and to only risk having the
transaction invalidated if the acquirer knew or should have known the consent was lacking.
With Article 33(3) applying, the acquirer does not lack the means to determine whether the
requisite consent was present or lacking. If notarized spousal consent is provided, the

statute is fulfilled, and the acquirer does not risk having the transaction later invalidated on

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 125 of 184

these grounds. If notarized spousal consent is not provided, the acquirer is fully aware of
the risk — that the spouse from whom notarized consent was not obtained can seek
invalidation of the transaction within a year of discovering the transaction (or a within a

year from when the spouse should have learned of the transaction).

It thus does not follow that the presumption under Article 33(2) should also be a factor
when such a presumption is unnecessary due to the presence, or lack of, clear, affirmative

consent.

The Tribunal does note that the Kakazh courts have been inconsistent in their application
of the above principles. Professor Abzhanov highlights multiple cases where the court did
indeed apply Article 33(2) even when notarized consent was required under Article

33(3).°”? This was confirmed by the Respondent’s experts.**

Importantly, the Respondent’s experts highlight court decisions that came to the opposite
conclusion.*°> The Respondent’s experts thus properly characterize the pre-2008
Normative Resolution case law on the application of Article 33 as involving “difficulties,
mistakes and misinterpretation.”°°° Clarification of the law was the purpose of the

Normative Resolution.

While it is certainly not ideal for courts of a state to fail to apply a particular statute
uniformly, this is not unusual in a given legal system and is often the purpose of a
subsequent resolution, higher court decision, etc. When the application of a particular law
is unclear, and courts display varying means of interpretation, it cannot be said that one
side of the legal debate violates international law in its attempt to apply the relevant statute,

especially when there is at least some merit to the particular means of interpretation.

Here, the application of Article 33(2) in cases where notarized consent was required by

Article 33(3) was hardly clear during the relevant proceedings. While the Tribunal is not

called upon to interpret this particular statute, it is convinced that, at the very least, the
Respondent courts’ application of these articles contained sufficient merit as to prevent the

Tribunal from characterizing them in a manner as to violate international law.

g. Failing to consider or rule on dispositive evidence and arguments submitted
to the court demonstrating that the 2003 SPA Proceeding was brought in bad
faith

While the Claimant’s overall case is quite multifaceted, this particular point strikes at the
heart of the narrative of this dispute — whether the plaintiffs acted in bad faith in bringing
the claim. Ironically, however, the argument on bad faith was virtually absent from the

Claimant’s written submissions, as highlighted by the Respondent.

The Tribunal acknowledges that there is significant evidence in this arbitration suggesting
that the 2003 SPA Proceeding was indeed brought in bad faith. As summarized by Mr.

Ogai, whom the Tribunal found to be a credible witness:

“We were receiving information, and myself and the General Prosecutor’s
Office have come to understand that indeed the claims were unlawful.
Moreover, they were submitted with ill-intent, malicious intent, because
there were circumstances pointing to the fact that the spouses that took part
in this, the ones that submitted claims, had absolutely no involvement,
together with the nominal shareholders, in the management of the company.
They were not owners. And at the same time, I believe it was in 2006 or
2007, they have provided powers of attorney to one company —
Mr. Mukashev, if I am not mistaken — for him to file any claims on their
behalf. And subsequently it was used, and claims were filed about declaring
the transaction invalid. So when the discussion with my management was
taking place about the interim results of this inspection, we decided that in
all of this situation there were the indicia of the crime, the signs of crime
committed.”>"”

Mr. Ogai also highlighted during his testimony that:

“[the] spouses, their wives, were saying that they knew nothing at all about
the dispute. They said they were asked to sign a power of attorney to
Mr. Mukashey, they signed the power of attorney, and now they haven’t got
a clue what the dispute is about. So on the basis of this information, I
concluded that we are possibly dealing with a planned action that somebody

might be using the spouses to intentionally appeal the sales and purchase
agreements and deals to annul them’”*°*

Mr. Ogai further confirmed that the Joint Statements had been intended to show the court

that the claims had been brought in bad faith.*°°

The issue before the Tribunal is not, of course, whether it believes the plaintiff spouses did
indeed act in bad faith, but rather the role of the Respondent’s courts in dealing with this

matter.

At the Hearing, the Respondent highlighted not only the lack of focus on bad faith in the
written submissions of this arbitration, but also the minimal role bad faith played in the

2003 SPA Proceedings:

“Both Professor Abzhanov (Day 5, page 23, lines 6 to 17) and Professor
Tlegenova (Day 6, page 115, lines 1 to 10) confirmed that bad faith was not
raised by Big Sky in the 2003 SPA proceedings, with the sole reference to
bad faith being, of course — as you see on slide 26 — in the few paragraphs
set out in the prosecutor’s protest to the Supreme Court (C-210), themselves
without any reference to relevant law or evidence. It’s very important that
in due course the Tribunal focuses on those paragraphs, because the case on
bad faith here, such as it is, bears no resemblance to the bad faith case now
advanced by the Claimant at this hearing.”

While the Respondent notes the presence of only three paragraphs from the prosecutor’s

protest dealing with bad faith, one of those paragraphs can sum up the position. It reads,

“Thus, decision in favour of the plaintiffs will result in deprivation of
Company’s entitlement to the fruit (income) of investment and in transfer
of this entitlement to Mukashev, B., Faskhutdinov R., Kashchapov T.,
Asanova T., Baikenov K., which indicates that there is bad faith in the action
of plaintiff in making present claim. Meanwhile, according to paragraph 4,
Article 8 of the Civil Code of the Republic of Kazakhstan, citizens should
act in good faith, reasonably and fairly when exercising their rights, and
comply with requirements of law and moral rules of society. Non-

compliance with the aforementioned requirements may serve as a ground

for denial of legal protection of the right due to a citizen.”°!
While the Respondent incorrectly claimed in the Hearing that this discussion on bad faith
lacked any reference to relevant law, as Article 8 of the Civil Code was explicitly cited,
there was not any in depth legal analysis of this issue. Instead, the prosecutor notes that the

relevant actions indicate the presence of bad faith.

The Tribunal is ultimately convinced that there is a fairly strong argument in this case that
the spouses brought their claims in bad faith. Mr. Ogai’s description of his views, and the
subsequent attempt to obtain the Joint Statements to correct what he viewed as a wrong,
has credibility in the Tribunal’s opinion. The theory that a potential legal loophole was
sought (the interpretation of which was questionable) and that the spouses were used to
expose that loophole despite having no knowledge of what was being claimed on their
behalf, seems believable to this Tribunal. This is especially the case if the Joint Statements

are indeed considered.

However, the Tribunal’s role again is not to impose its interpretation of the events, or to
officially endorse or criticize Mr. Ogai’s theory. Ultimately, the role of bad faith in the
2003 SPA Proceeding was not emphasized in any fashion. With the discussion limited to
a brief note in the prosecutor’s protest expressing the indication of bad faith, absent any
substantial legal analysis under Kazakh law, it can come as no surprise that the Kazakh

courts’ disposition of the case ultimately did not depend on this theory.

The primary issue at hand was spousal consent, specifically whether notarized consent was
required and, regardless of whether notarized consent was required, whether invalidation
on the basis of lack of consent requires that the other party knew or should have known of
such a lack of consent. While the issue of bad faith was highlighted during this hearing, it
was simply not pressed in the 2003 SPA Proceeding, and thus the Tribunal is unable to
come to the conclusion that a failure of the court to dismiss the 2003 SPA Proceeding due

to bad faith was so flawed as to constitute a violation of international law.

Further, the Respondent correctly notes that the Claimant could have submitted its own
appeal against the lower court’s decisions to the Supreme Court, rather than relying on the

prosecutor’s protest, but chose not to.%? If it had chosen to do so, which Mr. Heysel

confirmed was an option that had been discussed, it would have permitted the Claimant to
present its case on bad faith based on what it discovered during the preliminary

investigation.°”

Additionally, as highlighted by the Respondent, the Claimant could have requested
reconsideration under Articles 404-406 of the Code of Civil Procedure.* In doing so, the
Claimant could have sought access to the relevant criminal file, and such evidence (if
obtained), together with the Joint Statements, could have been filed with the District Court
for reconsideration based on new circumstances, and this would have permitted Big Sky to

push the bad faith theory it emphasized in the hearing.©°>

The Claimant’s failure to exhaust local remedies is quite detrimental to its denial of justice
claim. Whether such remedies would have been successful is not the issue, and of course
cannot be known, and therein lies the problem. The Claimant now claims to be denied
justice when it failed to properly exhaust the local means by which it could have obtained

such justice.

h. Failing to consider or rule on dispositive evidence and arguments submitted

to the court demonstrating that the 2003 SPA Proceeding was time-barred
A primary factor for this contention was whether the District Court was required to
consider the statute of limitation issue despite BSEK admittedly failing to raise it in Part II

of the 2003 SPA Proceedings. The Claimant’s position is that the District Court was

The Respondent, on the other hand, contends that the District Court cannot be criticized
for choosing not to consider, swa sponte, an issue that BSEK chose not to raise in the second
set of proceedings.” The Respondent also stresses that BSEK failed to raise this issue in

the appeal it filed against the Second 2003 SPA Decision.°°*

After reviewing the expert reports, the Tribunal is not sufficiently convinced one way or
the other whether, under Kazakh law, the District Court should have considered the statute
of limitation argument in the second proceedings despite the issue not being raised. Since
the Tribunal is again not acting as a court of appeal, it need not arrive at such a legal
conclusion. The Tribunal is, however, convinced that there is enough merit in the
Respondent’s position as to reject the Claimant’s characterization of this aspect of the

proceedings as a violation of international law.

The Tribunal finds merit in the Respondent’s contention that, having been asked by the
District Court to file its statement of defense in the second proceeding, which was filed on
April 25, 2007, BSEK should have raised the statute of limitation issue if it in fact planned
to rely on this legal position. It is also reasonable to have expected BSEK to have raised
such an issue during the oral submissions on April 25 and 26, 2007. For whatever reason,

it failed to do so.

Further, the Claimant admits that the statute of limitation issue was not raised in the appeal,
arguing that the higher courts should have reviewed it anyway, as it was still an issue
pending before the District Court. The Tribunal does not find this argument convincing.
Again, the Tribunal is not asserting that the lower and appellate courts by law should not
have addressed the statute of limitation issue. However, with the statute of limitation issue

being omitted from the statement of defense in the second proceedings as well as from the

subsequent appeal, the Tribunal finds the courts’ lack of dismissal based on such statute of

limitations at least reasonable enough to withstand scrutiny in this context.

i. District Court’s failure to send BSEK a copy of the Second 2003 SPA
Decision in a timely manner

The Claimant alleges that it did not receive the Second 2003 SPA Decision in a timely
manner, requiring it to submit a “blind appeal” before the Court of Appeal on
May 10, 2007.° The Claimant admits, however, that it was permitted to file an amended
appeal after it claims to have received the decision.°' Because the Claimant acknowledges
that it was permitted to file an amended appeal, even if the Tribunal were to find that a
copy of the Second 2003 SPA Decision was not sent to the Claimant in a timely manner,
there appears to have been no injury and thus the Tribunal need not delve further into this

allegation.

j. The 2008 ABT Proceedings

The Claimant contends that multiple aspects of the 2008 ABT Proceedings ran afoul of the
BIT. As summarized during the Hearing, the Claimant primarily contends: (1) the District
Court’s decision to invalidate the 2004 Agreements and the 2006 Agreements on the basis
that the parties had failed to obtain MEMR approval for the transfer of the 45% interest in
the Morskoye field had no basis in Kazakh law;*!! (2) the District Court’s conclusion that
there had been “malicious collusion” was unfounded in fact and had no basis in Kazakh
law;°!? (3) the District Court’s failure to explain on what basis it reached its conclusions
was a major procedural violation rendering the decision unlawful;°'? (4) the District
Court’s decision to allow ABT’s claim that the Claimant had materially misled it regarding

the value of the 15 million Big Sky US shares issued by the Claimant under the 2006

Agreements had no basis in Kazakh law and was not supported by evidence;°'* (5) the
District Court should have applied the proper law to the invalidation of the 2006 Stock
Issuance Agreement;°!> and (6) the District Court’s decision to order Big Sky US to pay
USD 27,150,000 to ABT as a refund of the real value of the 15 million shares had no basis

in evidence or Kazakh law.°'°

The Tribunal need not engage in any in-depth analysis of the substance of the 2008 ABT

Proceedings because the Claimant admittedly failed to appeal the decision.

In its Reply, the Claimant “does not deny that no appeal of the 2008 ABT Decision was
made.”°!” It attempts to justify this failure to exhaust local remedies by three means: (i) the
2003 SPA Proceeding had destroyed the Claimant’s trust in the Kazakh legal system; (ii)
the Claimant may have had little concern about the 2008 ABT Decision at the time; and
(iii) the 2008 ABT Decision’s lack of basis in Kazakh law should have prompted the
Respondent’s prosecutor to exercise his power to appeal it.°'® These justifications will be

discussed in turn.

The Claimant argues that its lack of trust in the Kazakh legal system led it to “reasonably
conclud[e] that the commitment of any further of its (limited) resources to appealing the
2008 ABT Decision would be futile.”°!? The Tribunal does not find this argument
persuasive. To permit investors to successfully pursue investment treaty claims on what
they assume would have occurred had they pursued available local remedies would open
the floodgates to speculative claims based on what courts might have done if asked to

address alleged legal wrongs.

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 133 of 184

As the Respondent quotes from Amto v. Ukraine, “[t]he investor that fails to exercise his
rights within a legal system, or exercises its rights unwisely, cannot pass his own
responsibility for the outcome to the administration of justice, and from there to the host
State in international law.”°° The Tribunal agrees with this view, and does not agree that
the Claimant can justify a failure to pursue local remedies because of its assumptions
regarding the anticipated rulings. The Claimant must show that an appeal would have been

futile; the Claimant has not provided sufficient evidence to support such a contention.

Concerning its second justification, the Claimant argues that the 2008 ABT Decision “only
became of concern to the Claimant when the Kazakh courts later (and unbeknownst to the
Claimant) issued the shocking rulings that it could be enforced against Big Sky US’s
subsidiary (i.e, BSEK’s) remaining assets in Kazakhstan (namely, its 10% interest in

Kozhan and its interest in the IUE Award).”°!

While the Tribunal can understand the Claimant’s thought process at the time, it was still
ultimately the Claimant’s decision not to appeal the 2008 ABT Decision. The Tribunal
does not find it persuasive that a claimant should be permitted to challenge local court
proceedings in an investment arbitration when it strategically decided not to exhaust such
available local remedies. The importance of pursuing such local remedies before
submitting a dispute to investment arbitration is not based on a party’s subjective view as
to the importance of a particular decision/appeal at that time. This would also
impermissibly allow investors to pursue actions based on decisions that were not
challenged at the time due to a subjective analysis as to whether such challenges were

strategically called for.

Lastly, the Claimant argues that “the 2008 ABT Decision’s ‘manifest[]’ lack of basis in

Kazakh law should have prompted the Respondent’s prosecutor to exercise its power to

appeal it. Unlike the Claimant, the Prosecutor would not have to have paid the state duty

for filing an appeal.”°??

The Tribunal also finds this justification unconvincing. A party whose case relies on the
challenge of court proceedings cannot excuse the failure to pursue legal remedies on the
basis that someone else should have done so. The Claimant acknowledges it could have
appealed and chose not to. The fact that the Respondent’s prosecutor could have also

appealed is irrelevant.

In challenging the decisions made in the 2008 ABT Proceedings, the Tribunal finds fatal
to the Claimant’s case that it intentionally chose not to appeal those decisions with which
it disagreed. The Respondent’s courts were the proper forum for at least the initial attempt
to challenge those decisions. The Claimant cannot merely skip those available remedies

and expect the Tribunal to instead act as the appellate court.

k. Failing to notify the Claimant of the hearings in the 2009 or 2012 Set-Off
Proceedings

The Respondent correctly notes that these issues were given little attention by the Claimant

3

at the Hearing,® and the Tribunal fails to find any violation of international law as

concerns the notice at issue.

First, the Tribunal finds convincing the Respondent’s reliance on Article 134 of the Code
of Civil Procedure, which requires the court to be informed of any change of address while
relevant proceedings are pending before the court. While the Claimant contends that this
does not apply, as it abandoned its office before the 2009 Set-Off Proceedings had begun,
the Respondent is correct that as of the alleged abandonment date of August 2008, the 2005
SPA Proceedings were ongoing, with the 2008 ABT Decision, which led to the 2009 Set-
Off Proceedings, being issued in September 2008.°°+

Importantly, even if service was deemed insufficient with respect to the 2009 and/or 2012
Set-Off Proceedings, the effects of such defects do not constitute violations of international

law.

Concerning the 2009 proceedings, the evidence establishes that, at the very latest, the
Claimant was aware of the 2009 Set-Off Ruling in December 2011.°°° Accordingly, the
Claimant waited at least 10 months before seeking to restore the time period for filing an
appeal against the ruling in November 2012.°° This is despite the fact that the normal time

period for submitting an appeal is 10 days.”

Professor Abzhanov takes the position that this considerable delay is inconsequential, as
there is no definitive timeline for the filing of an appeal of this nature when service is
deficient and the relevant party was unaware of the initial proceedings, even if the normal
timeframe is clearly defined.®* The Tribunal is hesitant to adopt Professor Abzhanov’s
view that “such time periods do not exist”, as this could lead to rather concerning scenarios
where a party, being improperly served in the first instance, could wait several years after
learning of the relevant proceedings before deciding to appeal, even if the normal
timeframe is a matter of days or weeks. This is perhaps why, under questioning from Judge
Tomka, Professor Abzhanov ultimately conceded that “one must bear in mind that the court

should be reasonable, sensible” in determining the proper time allotted.©?

Even if Professor Abzhanov’s opinion is accepted, that there is no set timeframe but that
courts should be reasonable and sensible, the Tribunal finds it unreasonable that the
Claimant waited approximately 10 months after discovering the ruling before seeking to
restore the time period for filing an appeal against the ruling, when the time period for

submitting such appeals is 10 days.

Further, BSEK admits to failing to appeal the November 2012 Ruling, but justifies this
failure by arguing that any such appeal would have been bound to fail on the merits, and
that it would have been futile given the involvement of the Three Oligarchs who stood
behind Kozhan and manipulated the courts for their benefit.°° This statement does not
amount to sufficient evidence, as merely expecting failure is not an excuse for failing to

exhaust local remedies.

With respect to the 2012 Set-Off Proceedings, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent
that since BSEK’s application to restore the time period for appeal on the basis that it had
not been notified of the proceedings was granted, any alleged lack of proper notice was

inconsequential.°>!

L_ Setting off debts purportedly owed by Big Sky US against assets held by its
subsidiary, BSEK, and failing to give any legal basis for lifting of the
corporate veil

The Claimant’s main concerns on this issue are threefold: (1) the Bailiff’s petition to
change the method and order of the execution of the 2008 ABT Decision; (2) the principle
of corporate separateness; and (3) the Court’s failure to exclude USD 27,150,000 from the
set-off under the 2009 Set-Off Ruling on the ground that it had not been validly assigned
by ABT to Kozhan.

(i)  Bailiff’s petition to change the method and order of execution

The Claimant argues that it was improper for the District Court to rely on Article 240(1)
of the Code of Civil Procedure when, upon the petition of the bailiff, it changed the method
of execution, ordering that the court-ordered debt be used to offset BSEK’s 10% interest
in Kozhan.°” Professor Abzhanov argues that such a change in the method or order of
execution has no basis under Kazakh law, contending that no such change and order is
permitted with respect to decisions for payment of money, as “(i) they do not provide for

any specific method or order of performance and there is thus nothing to change in the first

place; and (ii) the bailiff is already authorised by law to execute such decisions against any
property of the debtor, so there is simply no need to substitute the ordered payment of
money with another method or order of execution.”°* Accordingly, he concludes that there
could be no change to the method and order of execution when the bailiff discovered that

Big Sky US had no cash or other property in Kazakhstan.°**

The Respondent highlights that Professor Abzhanov primarily relies on a Normative
Resolution of the Supreme Court dated June 29, 2009 in making his claims concerning the
legitimacy of the method and order of execution, meaning that he relies on a Normative
Resolution that was first published and entered into force on August 14, 2009, six weeks
afier the 2009 Set-Off Ruling.°*> The Claimant contends that this is irrelevant, as the
District Court would have seen a draft of the Normative Resolution before it was published,

and the Normative Resolution had merely summarized already existing court practice.°°

The fact that the District Court may have been sent a draft of a normative resolution which
could then theoretically undergo further discussions, amendments, etc. before eventually
coming into force” does not, in the Tribunal’s view, render such a normative resolution
binding in this scenario. At most, the Tribunal could grant that such a theoretical review of
the draft resolution could have provided guidance to the District Court as to what rules may
come down in the future, thus arguably providing guidance as to how the process should
work currently. Failing to adhere to a draft, before its finalization and publication, does
not, in the Tribunal’s opinion, amount to a violation of international law arising out of the

decision of the District Court.

Further, the Tribunal finds at least plausible Professor Tlegenova’s opinion that neither the
law preceding the Normative Resolution nor the Normative Resolution itself are clear,

arguing that the “[c]Jourts consider and, if appropriate, allow bailiffs’ petitions for changing

the method and order of execution of a court decision from collecting money to levying

execution against other property.”°*

Ultimately, with the Normative Resolution post-dating the relevant acts, and the lack of
clarity preceding such Normative Resolution (and possibly of the Normative Resolution
itself), the Tribunal does not find the bailiff’s petition to change the method and order of

execution to be manifestly flawed.

(ii) Lifting the corporate veil

The Claimant contends that the District Court:

“failed to adhere to the principle of corporate separateness in using shares
held by BSEK to pay off a debt purportedly owed by Big Sky US. The only
debtor under the 2008 ABT Decision was the Claimant. BSEK had no
obligations arising from the 2008 ABT Decision. As a result, the 2008 ABT
Decision could be executed only against the Claimant, not the assets of
BSEK."°?

The Claimant supports its position with analysis from Professor Abzhanov:

“Kazakh law expressly recognizes separate legal personality of a subsidiary
(here, BSEK) from its parent (here, Big Sky US). The assets of the former
are legally separate from the assets of the latter. Furthermore, Kazakh law
clearly provides that a subsidiary, even if 100% owned and controlled by
the parent company, is not liable for the parent’s debts.”*?

In response, the Respondent focuses more on the theoretical possibility of lifting of the

corporate veil in the manner prescribed under Article 8 of the Civil Code. Specifically, the

Joint Report of Professor Zhanaidarov and Dr. Daulenov states:

“The liability of the subsidiary for the debts of the parent company is also
based on Article 8 of the Civil Code, which (inter alia), establishes the
principle of good faith and the prohibition of abuse of civil rights. At the
same time, the general rule that ‘a subsidiary company is not liable for the
debts of its parent organisation’ (Article 94(1)(2) of the Civil Code) applies

only if this does not contradict the express norms and principles established

by Article 8 of the Civil Code [. . .]."!
Despite this theoretical means of lifting the corporate veil in the manner witnessed in the
set-off proceedings, the Respondent and its experts fail to provide any analysis
demonstrating that such a lifting was actually appropriate here or point to any justification
from the court. In fact, the Claimant is correct in highlighting that the Respondent’s own
expert, Dr. Daulenov, admitted that based on the available documents, he was “unable to
arrive at a conclusion as to the grounds on which the execution of the 2008 ABT Decision

against BSEK’s 10% interest in Kozhan was permitted under Kazakh law.”°?

Instead, the Respondent merely notes the possible lifting under Article 8 of the Civil Code
and then states the blanket conclusion that “the Kazakh courts were entitled to set off the

debt of Big Sky US against Big Sky Canada’s 10% interest in Kozhan.”°

Absent any actual connection between the set-off here and Article 8 of the Civil Code, the
Tribunal does not find this leap in reasoning particularly persuasive and has serious doubts
as to the appropriateness of these set-offs by the Kazakh courts. The possible lifting of the
corporate veil under Article 8 does not appear to be a routine legal maneuver, the legitimacy
of which should simply be assumed. This is especially the case without any legal analysis

even attempted.

However, the Tribunal again notes the significant gap between an arbitral tribunal having
doubts, even serious ones, about the ruling of a local court, and the tribunal characterizing

such a ruling as so flawed as to constitute a violation of international law.

The Tribunal acknowledges the contention made by Professor Zhanaidarov and Dr.
Daulenoy that the set-off in this case is at least possible under the laws of Kazakhstan, and
the Tribunal lacks sufficient evidence before it to affirmatively declare that such a lifting

of the corporate veil in this manner is a legal impossibility. Accordingly, rather than dealing

with a court ruling that can perhaps (or even likely) be labelled as objectively incorrect, the
Tribunal is in a position where, to find a denial of justice, it would have to substitute its
own interpretation for the local court’s subjective implementation of its own laws. This is
not the appropriate role of an international tribunal. As a result, while the Tribunal certainly
questions the strength of the supposed legal reasoning behind the decisions to set off debts
purportedly owed by Big Sky US against assets held by its subsidiary, BSEK, the Tribunal

does not find such decisions to constitute a denial of justice.

(iii) The exclusion of USD 27,150,000 from the set-off

The Claimant argues that the District Court should have excluded USD 27,150,000 from
the set-off under the 2009 Set-Off Ruling on the ground that it had not been validly assigned
by ABT to Kozhan.°#

First, the Claimant contends that the 2008 ABT Decision only partially invalidated the
2006 ABT Agreement, failing to invalidate Article 9.9, which prohibited a party (ABT)
from assigning any of its rights and liabilities arising thereunder without prior written
consent from the other party (Big Sky US). The 2008 ABT Decision arose pursuant to the

2006 ABT Agreement, and thus ABT required Big Sky US’s written consent to this

assignment agreement.

The Parties agree that the 2008 ABT Decision arose from the 2006 ABT Agreement.°
While the Claimant contends that the 2008 ABT Decision only partially invalidated the
2006 ABT Agreement, leaving Article 9.9 intact, the Respondent’s experts argue:

“Big Sky US’s obligation to pay the sum of US$ 27,150,000 to ABT results
directly from the ABT Decision, not from the 2006 ABT Agreement. It
follows that the requirement to obtain written consent under Article 9.9 of
the 2006 ABT Agreement does not apply. Professor Abzhanov’s statement
that the 2008 ABT Decision cannot be viewed separately from the 2006
ABT Agreement from which it arose has no basis in Kazakh law and we

noted previously that Professor Abzhanov does not refer to any law or
commentary to support this statement.”°47

In essence, the Respondent’s experts argue that because the debt arose from the 2008 ABT
Decision, the language in Article 9.9 of the 2006 ABT Agreement concerning the relevant
assignment, as well as the language in Articles 339(2) and 345(1) of the Civil Code which

govern the assignment of a creditor’s rights in the presence of limiting contractual

language, do not apply.°**

The Claimant and Professor Abzhanov have failed to provide a convincing legal basis for
clearly requiring adherence to Article 9.9 when dealing with a debt that, while connected
with the 2006 ABT Agreement in that the 2008 ABT Decision arose from it, is at least

reasonably framed as resulting directly from the ABT Decision.
The Tribunal instead finds plausible the following explanation by Dr. Daulenov:

“Big Sky US’s obligation to pay the sum of US$27,150,000 to ABT results
directly from the 2008 ABT Decision, not from the 2006 ABT Agreement.
[...] Article 9.9 of the 2006 ABT Agreement does not therefore apply.
According to Article 76(3) of the Constitution, decisions, sentences and
other rulings of the courts are binding throughout the territory of
Kazakhstan. Moreover, Article 21(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure
stipulates that all judicial acts, including judgments, which have entered into
force, are binding on all state bodies, local governments, public
associations, other legal entities, public officials and citizens and are subject
to rigorous execution throughout the territory of Kazakhstan. Therefore,
once the 2008 ABT Decision had entered into force, it became binding on
all parties to the dispute; Big Sky US’s prior written consent to the
Assignment Agreement was not required and Article 9.9 of the 2006 ABT
Agreement did not apply.”

At the very least the Tribunal finds this position plausible enough to prevent any

characterization of the District Court’s decision as legally problematic under international

law.

m. The Bailiff’s failure to obtain an independent and serious valuation of
BSEK’s 10% shareholding in Kozhan

The Claimant’s position here revolves around what it finds to be an improper valuation of

BSEK’s 10% shareholding in Kozhan. However, this issue is two-fold: (1) whether an

independent valuation was necessary; and (2) if so, whether the valuation in this case was

proper.

Regarding the first point, the Claimant contends that as part of any execution process, the

bailiff is required to arrange for an independent valuation of the debtor’s property.°?

The Respondent’s expert, however, argues that after the bailiff filed a petition for changing
the method and order of execution of the 2008 ABT Decision, the court ruled in the 2009
Set-Off Ruling for another method for order and execution of the 2008 ABT Decision,
namely “by transferring [...] the property in kind being the 10 per cent interest in order to
offset the debt obligations of the debtor [BSEK] to [Kozhan].”°*! The Respondent thus
contends that unlike when property is sold at public auction, with the proceeds to be paid
to the creditor, “where the creditor is awarded specific property pursuant to the writ of

execution, the bailiff shall seize the debtor’s property and transfer it to the debtor.”°?

The Tribunal is skeptical of the Respondent’s position that no valuation was necessary, as
the Respondent admits that the bailiff was correct in obtaining a valuation before the 2009
Set-Off Ruling “because the court had to be presented with evidence to confirm that the
amount awarded under the 2008 ABT Decision would be repaid fully or in part by
transferring 10% interest of Big Sky Canada in Kozhan.”° The Respondent therefore
acknowledges that the valuation of the 10% interest is relevant for execution of the 2008

ABT Decision, even if there is a discrepancy as to when the valuation should have taken

place. This of course makes sense as the value of property being used to satisfy a debt is

quite relevant.

Thus, assuming that an independent valuation was necessary, the Tribunal will consider

whether one was properly obtained.

The Claimant argues that the valuation obtained from Mirnykh Valuation was improper as
it was requested by Kozhan, a clearly biased party with an obvious interest in securing a
low valuation which would allow it to seek subsequent enforcement of the court-ordered

debt against additional BSEK assets (i.e., against the [US Award, which it duly did).°*

In response to the Claimant’s contention that the valuation was improper, the Respondent
argues that the Claimant should have challenged the valuation in a separate set of
proceedings and/or appealed the 2009 Set-Off Ruling within 10 days of learning of its
existence.°> The Claimant, however, contends that no notice of the Mirnykh Valuation
had been given to BSEK, and BSEK had been unable to challenge it in the 2009 Set-Off

Proceeding.°*°

The Claimant does not seem to doubt the Respondent’s claim that in the event of
disagreement with the valuation, it in theory had the right to file a claim challenging the
valuation carried out.°*’ Instead, the Claimant's position is that its failure to receive notice
of the valuation precluded it from filing the available challenge. For this contention, the
Claimant refers to Professor Abzhanov’s Second Expert Report, which merely notes that
the bailiffs resolution dated July 20, 2009 fails to mention any notice of the Mirnykh
Valuation being given to Big Sky or BSEK.®* This does not necessarily establish that the

Claimant was unaware of the valuation at the time.

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 144 of 184

This argument appears insufficient for the Claimant to be excused for having failed to
challenge the valuation at any stage. Even if the Claimant had been unaware of the
valuation at the time it was completed before the 2009 Set-Off Ruling, it could have
subsequently attempted to challenge that aspect in a timely appeal of that ruling. Instead,
as discussed above, the Claimant unnecessarily waited at least 10 months after learning of

the 2009 Set-Off Ruling before commencing its appeal attempt.

The Tribunal acknowledges that on its face, the Mirnykh Valuation does appear to be
highly questionable, and there is no doubt that there are credible arguments to be made
concerning the valuation itself and the fact that a clearly biased party was involved in the
selection of those responsible for the questionable findings. However, as is the case with
other aspects of the relevant proceedings, the Tribunal is unwilling to simply impose its
own judgment in place of the Kazakh court’s, especially when the Claimant has failed to

properly utilize local appellate remedies.

n. The Bailiff’s failure to make any attempt to sell the 10% shareholding at a

public auction
The Claimant argues that the bailiff’s execution of the 2009 Set-Off Ruling failed to
comply with Kazakh law because such laws mandated that the bailiff first attempt to sell
the 10% shareholding at a public auction. Specifically, Professor Abzhanov contends
that pursuant to a 2005 Normative Resolution of the Supreme Court the transfer of attached
property to the execution creditor without any attempt to sell that property at a public

auction was unlawful.°°

The Respondent’s position relies primarily on two arguments: (1) that the 2009 Set-Off
Ruling expressly called for the transfer of property in kind; and (2) that the 2005 Normative

Resolution explicitly permits this.

Concerning the first point, Professor Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin argue that pursuant

to Article 35(5) of the 1998 Enforcement Law, “where the creditor is awarded specific

property as specified in the execution document, the bailiff shall seize the debtor’s property

766:

and transfer it to the creditor.”**! A review of Article 35(5) reveals the following language:

“If creditor was awarded certain items under the execution document, the court bailiff

seizes such items from the debtor and transfers them to the creditor under act of transfer.”

The Tribunal finds this language to be supportive of the Respondent’s position and would
appear to follow the logical sequence of events of a court ordering a specific transfer of

property in kind and the bailiff executing such a transfer.

Concerning the 2005 Normative Resolution, Professor Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin
argue that paragraph 8 of the Normative Resolution, on which Professor Abzhanov relies,
calling for the sale of interest in Kozhan “on the commission basis through trading
organizations or at auctions” would necessarily contradict the express order present in the
2009 Set-Off Ruling.* Instead, they contend that paragraph 10 is the appropriate
paragraph to reference, which calls for the transfer of property when such property is

awarded to the creditor.°™*

The Tribunal finds at least plausible the position that paragraph 8 more appropriately
concerns “general issues of the sale of property when executing court decisions to recover
money”, as opposed to those explicit orders for the transfer of property in kind. Applying

paragraph 8 to such orders would necessarily present an unworkable contradiction.

With respect to the applicability of paragraph 10 of the Normative Resolution, the Tribunal

has its doubts. Paragraph 10 reads as follows:

“When hearing complaints on the actions of bailiffs related to the transfer
of property in kind, the court shall take into account that the debtor’s
property over which the bailiff has levied execution may be transferred to
the execution creditor in kind when:

- certain items were awarded to the execution creditor as specified in the
execution document;

- it was impossible to sell the attached property at an auction within two
months at the price of the property set at the time the action was announced;

- an auction was declared ineffective, then at the price reduced by twenty
per cent from the initial appraised price;

- a repeated auction was declared ineffective, then at the last announced
price which shall not be less than fifty per cent from the initial appraised
price;

- the court approves a settlement agreement between the execution creditor

and debtor which provides for the transfer of the property in kind.”°°
Professor Tlegenova and Dr. Mukhamedshin rely on the first sub-point, which would
indeed appear to support their position.’ However, the Tribunal notes the lack of any
inclusive “or” following the penultimate sub-point and finds it unclear whether the list is
indeed meant to be inclusive. Instead, the argument could be made that the sub-points
comprise a list of procedures to be carried out before execution of the transfer (i.e., the
attempted sale at full price, an ineffective auction at a 25% discount, an ineffective auction
at a 50% discount and an approved settlement). Because of the lack of clarity, the Tribunal
does not find that paragraph 10 of the Normative Resolution explicitly permits the transfer

in kind absent a public auction.

Despite this, the Tribunal finds sufficiently plausible the Respondent’s position that Article
35(5) of the 1998 Enforcement Law, which the Tribunal importantly acknowledges
predates the 2005 Normative Resolution, calls for the transfer in kind when the applicable
order calls for such a transfer. Because this law predates the 2005 Normative Resolution,
the Tribunal must also find at least plausible the Respondent’s position that paragraph 8
more appropriately applies to issues of sales of property to execute orders to recover money

as opposed to orders explicitly calling for the transfer of property in kind. Accordingly, the

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 147 of 184

Tribunal does not consider the failure to attempt a sale at auction of the 10% shareholding

to be legally problematic from the perspective of international law.

516. While the Tribunal admittedly finds questionable some of the numerous court actions at
issue in this case, it fails to find any of the relevant judicial conduct sufficiently flawed as

to constitute a denial of justice.

(2) Article III(1) of the BIT — Judicial Expropriation

517. To recall, Article II(1) of the BIT provides:

“Investments shall not be expropriated or nationalized either directly or
indirectly through measures tantamount to expropriation or nationalization
(“expropriation”) except: for public purpose; in a nondiscriminatory
manner; upon payment of prompt, adequate and effective compensation;
and in accordance with due process of law and the general principles of
treatment provided for in Article II(2). Compensation shall be equivalent to
the fair market value of the expropriated investment immediately before the
expropriatory action was taken or became known, whichever is earlier; be
calculated in a freely usable currency on the basis of the prevailing market
rate of exchange at that time; be paid without delay; include interest at a
commercially reasonable rate from the date of expropriation; be fully
realizable; and be freely transferable.”

518. As a factual matter, the Claimant’s judicial expropriation concerns the same conduct
discussed above with respect to the Claimant’s denial of justice claim. The Respondent
argues that the Claimant’s expropriation claim necessarily must fail if its denial of justice
claim fails. The Tribunal does not necessarily agree with this proposition as a matter of
law. On the facts of the case, however, which include the same factual allegations as the
allegations advanced under the denial of justice claim, the Tribunal arrives at a similar
conclusion — namely that the Claimant has failed to establish expropriation based on the

judicial conduct at issue in this case.

519. As detailed above, the Tribunal acknowledges that some of the substantive and procedural
decisions made by the Kazakh courts are questionable. On some of the challenged actions

or alleged failures to act, the Claimant and Professor Abzhanov have presented credible

critiques. However, as the Tribunal noted in its discussion of denial of justice, it was not
convinced that the conduct of the Kazakh courts was flawed to such an extent as to trigger

violations of international law.

To succeed on an expropriation claim based on the same judicial conduct, the Claimant
would have to convincingly articulate how the judicial conduct here that failed to amount
to a denial of justice could constitute unlawful expropriation. The Claimant has failed to
provide such a theory and has instead relied on its characterization of the judicial conduct

as wrongful.

The Claimant primarily relies on two arguments to support its expropriation claim in the
face of a potentially unsuccessful denial of justice finding: 1) that its case is not centred on
judicial misconduct;°® and (2) that the Tribunal is permitted to view its allegations in the
context of expropriation without reference to any standard relevant in a denial of justice

context.°”

With respect to the first point, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimant’s contention that
its case is not centered on judicial misconduct. A review of the Claimant’s allegations, as
laid out extensively above, makes it quite apparent that the Claimant’s case indeed focuses
on acts taken, and not taken, by the Kazakh courts. While it may be true that certain factual
allegations include State organs aside from the judiciary, such allegations are merely

supportive in nature to what is a court-based narrative of alleged treaty breaches.

As concerns the second point, the Tribunal acknowledges that the Claimant is free to allege
BIT violations other than denial of justice even if such allegations revolve around acts of
the judiciary. The Tribunal does not doubt that acts of the judiciary can amount to
expropriation. For judicial acts to amount to unlawful expropriation, however, the Claimant
must establish, as in the denial of justice context, that such acts were wrongful in such a
manner so as to constitute a treaty breach. Simply framing allegations as breaches other

than denial of justice does not satisfy that burden.

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 149 of 184

Here, while the Tribunal has questioned certain acts taken by the Kazakh courts, it has
failed to find any such acts to be wrongful as a matter of international law. It therefore
follows that the Claimant’s expropriation case fails unless it clearly articulates how acts of
the Kazakh judiciary can constitute an unlawful expropriation while failing to constitute
demonstrably wrongful acts or omissions. To be clear, within the denial of justice section
of this Award, the Tribunal obviously worked under the applicable burden for such a theory
of breach, but importantly it was not the case that the Tribunal found the relevant judicial
conduct wrongful, yet insufficiently wrongful to constitute a denial of justice. Instead,
while some of the judicial conduct was admittedly questionable, the Tribunal did not find
any of the alleged acts or omissions to be flawed to an extent actionable by an arbitral

tribunal on the plane of international law.

The Claimant has also failed to effectively place the role of the courts within a larger
alleged expropriation scheme involving other state organs in a manner that would permit
the Tribunal to find expropriation without labelling the conduct of the judiciary alone as

unlawful under international law.

Now, while not clearly articulated by the Claimant, the Tribunal notes that in distinguishing
between denial of justice and judicial expropriation, perhaps the argument could be made
that due to a flawed legal structure, the judiciary could expropriate an investment while
failing to engage in any “wrongful” conduct in its application of relevant laws. The
Claimant has not clearly articulated such a theory and the Tribunal in any case has been

provided no evidence that such a scenario existed here.

Accordingly, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has not established any judicial

expropriation.

The Claimant supports its FET contention by noting that this standard prohibits
arbitrariness and therefore due process and the predictability of the legal framework are
relevant for such analysis, while, unlike in the denial of justice context, such actions need

not be considered “outrageous” or “egregious”. In doing so, the Claimant labels the

relevant judicial conduct as “seriously flawe

violations of procedural norms,°*” representing a disregard of facts and evidence,°™ etc. In

essence, the Claimant again challenges the legitimacy of the Respondent courts’ actions.

In doing so, it is important to again review the “number of constitutive elements” of the
FET claim, apart from the denial of justice analysis. The seven elements listed by the
Claimant include: (i) the host State must act with procedural propriety and due process vis-
a-vis an investor; (ii) the host State must act in good faith towards an investor; (iii) the host
State’s conduct towards an investor cannot be arbitrary, unfair, unreasonable, unjust, or
idiosyncratic; (iv) the host State must not commit a “denial of justice” against the foreign
investor; (v) the host State must act consistently vis-a-vis the investor; (vi) the host State
must act transparently vis-a-vis an investor; and (vii) the host State must provide a stable

legal and business environment for an investor.°**

a denial of justice’ with the autonomous treaty-based FET standard’”®*° to find that the

conduct at issue fails to constitute a breach of FET. Even if a “holistic” approach is taken
in reviewing whether the Respondent’s conduct was fair and equitable, as advocated by the
Claimant,**’ its case still relies on the Tribunal declaring the relevant conduct to be

“arbitrary”,°* lacking in procedural fairness and due process,°*? lacking in transparency

6 or lacking in good faith.%! Crucially, the Claimant’s FET claim still necessitates a
finding that the Respondent’s conduct was “wrongful” in one of these ways, and it spends
significant time merely differentiating among the ways in which the acts could be declared

as such, in contrast to those present in a denial of justice context.

However, the issue here again is not the level of wrongfulness of the relevant judicial
conduct (i.e., whether such conduct is wrongful enough to be characterized as “outrageous”
or “egregious” or if it is instead “flawed”, “unjust”, “arbitrary” or lacking in due process).
Instead, in viewing the relevant judicial conduct that is at the heart of the Claimant’s case
as a whole and of the FET claim specifically, the Tribunal already failed to find any such
conduct to be objectively wrongful as a matter of international law. It is true that the
Tribunal’s analysis under denial of justice focused primarily on the claims of improper
application of relevant substantive and procedural laws, but in evaluating whether such
conduct amounted to a denial of justice, the Tribunal of course also took into account
whether decisions, actions and omissions were arbitrary, lacking in due process, lacking in
good faith, etc. Such consideration would quite clearly be necessary in evaluating whether
such conduct ran astray of international law both in the denial of justice and in the FET

context.

Aside from the individual examples of alleged misconduct highlighted by the Claimant, it
also contends that “the State’s collective wilful blindness to the illicit scheme carried out
through the Respondent’s courts and its failure to protect the Claimant’s investment from

the criminal enterprise (or ‘corporate raid’, as the Prosecutors described it) is the most

egregious example of the Respondent’s lack of good faith and failure to exercise due
diligence.”®? This overarching theme of the Claimant’s case is difficult to assess as an
actual example of the Respondent’s failure to afford FET, as it serves more as a legal
conclusion that must be based on underlying wrongdoing (i.e., the judicial conduct). The
possible contention that the Respondent had an affirmative duty to protect the Claimant’s
investment from the alleged “illicit scheme” is addressed in more detail below in the

analysis of full protection and security.

For the purpose of FET, the Tribunal is not convinced that, having failed to find the relevant
judicial acts and omissions to be wrongful, the Claimant has sufficiently established how,
when taking a holistic view, such acts and omissions, admittedly leading to results
considered unfavorable by the Claimant, constitute a lack of good faith and/or due

diligence.

With respect to the Claimant’s reliance on the most-favored nation clause in Article II(1)
of the BIT and the applicability of Article 4(2) of the Kazakhstan Investment Law which
provides a right for damages for the investor in case of the “enactment by a state body of
an act conflicting with legislative acts of the Republic of Kazakhstan or as a result of an
illegal action (a failure to act)”,? even assuming that the Claimant has established that it
applies, this claim fails for the same reason as the Claimant’s primary FET claim — the lack
of state actions that the Tribunal finds to be illegal. Furthermore, the Tribunal also finds
plausible the Respondent’s position that Article 4(2) “does not create any free-standing
entitlement to compensation capable of being invoked by the Claimant, but merely

guarantees the availability of any remedies existing under Kazakh civil law.”°*

In sum, the Claimant’s FET case is primarily a repetition of its denial of justice claim, with
the conclusion that such challenged court actions amount to a breach of FET when viewed
in the context of differing standards under which an act can be considered wrongful.

Because the Tribunal does not consider the relevant judicial conduct to be actionable, i.e.,

wrongful under international law, the Claimant’s FET contention under Article II(2)(a) of

the BIT fails.

(4) Article I1(6) of the BIT — Effective Means

To recall, Article II(6) of the BIT provides:

“Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing

rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment

authorizations.”°5
As with its other claims, the Claimant’s effective means case relies on the same challenged
judicial conduct. Specifically, the Claimant contends that this standard guarantees that “a
domestic court will (i) fairly and impartially consider its arguments and evidence; (ii)
render its decision on the basis of the rule of law and without undue delay; and (iii) make

the decision in an honest, independent, and impartial way.”°°

The Respondent relies heavily on its contention that the Claimant cannot select an effective
means theory when addressing judicial conduct as a way of avoiding a potentially higher
burden in the denial of justice analysis. Whether or not the Tribunal agrees with the
Respondent’s position, it need not address that particular issue here as it finds that the

Claimant’s case fails under the effective means standard as well.

Whether in the denial of justice context or effective means context, the Claimant’s case
again makes clear that it must establish wrongful conduct on the part of the Kazakh
judiciary to prevail. As noted throughout this Award, while the Tribunal finds certain acts
of the judiciary to be questionable in this case, it is not willing to characterize such conduct
as actionable as it finds no misapplication of the relevant law rising to the level of a

violation of international law.

Absent any theory as to how the Tribunal could find a breach of the effective means
standard despite failing to find wrongful the conduct on the part of the judiciary on which

this argument relies, the Tribunal rejects this claim under Article II(6) of the BIT.

(5) Article I1(2)(a) of the BIT — FPS.

To recall, Article II(2)(a) of the BIT provides:

“Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall

enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment

less than that required by international law.”°”
There are two primary issues at hand in the FPS aspect of this case: (i) whether the FPS
standard requires “legal protection” in addition to physical protection; and (ii) if FPS

requires legal protection, whether the Respondent is in breach of this requirement.
Both Parties agree that tribunals have been divided as to the scope of FPS.

The Respondent provides relevant language from the Liman v. Kazakhstan tribunal, which

articulated the more restrictive view of FPS by determining that:

“[w]ith regard to the standard of most constant protection and security, the
Tribunal holds that this provision, which must have a meaning beyond, and
distinct from, the standard of fair and equitable treatment, provides a
standard which does not extend to any contractual rights but whose purpose
is rather to protect the integrity of an investment against interference by the
use of force and particularly physical damage.”°*

As the Respondent notes, this excerpt explicitly found that the FPS provision must not be

read to merely provide the sort of legal protection contained in FET analysis.°°

While the Claimant’s FPS case relies almost exclusively on the same conduct as its position

on FET, which would seem thus to render the FPS “legal protection” redundant, the

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 156 of 184

Claimant does provide a theory by which “protection” could credibly differ from FET

without necessarily referring to physical force.

In this arbitration, the Claimant has alleged a scheme by private third parties to illicitly
deprive it of its investment. Within this context, the Claimant contends that the plain
meaning of “full protection and security” entails protection and security, in the legal
context, from such illicit conduct aimed at impermissible deprivation of a foreign
investment.’ In such a scenario, as the Claimant appears to argue, it would not be a matter
of the Respondent merely providing fair and equitable treatment in how it approaches the
Claimant, but rather acting appropriately when confronted with such an illicit scheme in

motion.

If the Claimant’s interpretation were accepted, this would of course beg the question as to
what sort of obligation would apply to the Respondent in the face of such an alleged
scheme. The Claimant contends, and the Respondent agrees, that Article II(2)(a) requires

the Respondent to “take all measures it could reasonably be expected to take” as part of its

“duty of due diligence.”7°!

The International Law Association, cited by both Parties, describes such due diligence in

the following manner:

“In international law obligations of conduct are far more common than
obligations of result. This means that international law tends to focus
primarily on the behaviour of States rather than the outcomes of that
behaviour. Due diligence standards preserve for States a significant measure
of autonomy and flexibility in discharging their international obligations.
Rigid application of international rules, mandating results, or imposing
liability in the event of breach in any circumstance cuts against the grain of
notions of State sovereignty and domains of non-interference.””°

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 157 of 184

The Claimant acknowledges that such a duty would be limited to a State taking “reasonable
care”? which includes “adopt[ing] all reasonable measures to protect assets and
property.”7°+
While not explicitly separated in such a manner, the Claimant appears to argue: i) that the
Respondent must provide reasonable legal protection with respect to the Claimant’s assets;
and ii) that the Respondent must proactively make sure an illicit scheme being perpetrated

by private parties fails.

As concerns the first theory, the Tribunal is not convinced that, assuming FPS were to be
interpreted as extending to legal protection, such protection would extend beyond the
existence of “a functioning system of courts and legal remedies to a foreign investor.”7°>
In this case, the functioning of the judiciary has already been examined at length and the
Tribunal has made clear it finds no international law implications with respect to such

conduct.

As concerns the second theory, the Claimant has failed to prove that the Respondent
“knew” of the alleged illicit scheme and therefore permitted it to succeed. It is undoubted
that certain government officials (e.g., Mr. Ogai) felt strongly that the original owners were
acting in bad faith, but this is far from the Respondent as a Party being objectively aware
of, and subsequently endorsing, such a “scheme”. In this case there was apparent
disagreement at various levels of the Respondent’s state organs regarding the nature of the

relevant proceedings, including their validity and the interpretation of applicable laws.

If the FPS standard provides for legal protection, such responsibility remains the same in
the face of allegations of fraud, as in this arbitration — that is, the availability of a
functioning court system to address such allegations. There is no sufficient evidence that
the Respondent failed to provide such a legal system here, with adequate available

remedies, and the Tribunal does not find that the Respondent’s conduct when confronting

the Claimant’s allegations was flawed in manner that would violate the legal protection

requirement under FPS.

Because the Tribunal finds that the Respondent would not have breached the sort of legal
protection requirement under FPS as described by the Claimant, it need not engage in the
ongoing debate as to whether, and to what extent, FPS extends beyond physical protection.

The Tribunal thus rejects the Claimant’s FPS claim under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

The Claimant also references Article 4(2) of the Kazakhstan Investment Law in the context
of its FPS contention. As was the case for the reliance on this law in the FET analysis, even
assuming it was applicable here through the MFN clause, the Claimant’s position fails for

lack of illegal action on the part of the Respondent.

(6) Article II(2)(b) of the BIT — Arbitrary or Discriminatory Measures

To recall, Article II(2)(b) provides:

“Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory
measures the management, operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment,
acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute
resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be arbitrary or
discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a Party has had or has exercised
the opportunity to review such measure in the courts or administrative
tribunals of a Party.”

The Claimant “accepts that there may be overlap between the non-impairment clause and
the FET clause,” but it argues that they are not repetitive claims in this arbitration because

it has highlighted “key examples of the Respondents arbitrary conduct [. . .].”7°°

However, in making such an argument, the Claimant refers to paragraphs 484-486 of its

Memorial on the Merits,”°”

repeating the precise conduct that permeates the Claimant’s
entire case: (i) invalidation of the 2003 SPA because of lack of spousal consent; (ii)
ignoring the Joint Statements; (iii) failure to provide sufficient reasoning for judicial

decisions; (iv) generally incorrect legal decisions; (v) deregistration of BSEK’s additional

10% shareholding following the Supreme Court judgment; (vi) the 2008 ABT decision;
and (vii) 2009 and 2012 set-off proceedings, including the dispute over corporate

separateness and proper notice. ”°°

These are acts that form the basis of the Claimant’s general allegation of improper conduct
amounting to a breach of the BIT. The Claimant attempts to reframe such conduct in the
context of each BIT provision, but it fails to establish how, once the Tribunal rules that
such acts were not wrongful, in that they did not constitute manifestly impermissible
interpretations and applications of the relevant laws, such conduct could then be considered
to constitute a treaty breach under a different title. The fundamental truth remains that the

Claimant must establish that the conduct at issue is actionable under the BIT.

As has been repeated in this Award, the Tribunal is not willing to act as a court of appeal
and is not willing to merely substitute its own interpretation of Kazakh law for the
interpretation provided by the Kazakh courts. The Tribunal confirms that it would be
permitted to find a breach of the BIT if the relevant judicial conduct was clearly flawed,
whether it be because interpretations were “outrageous or egregious”, whether there was

“blatant misapplication”””

of the applicable laws or whether the Respondent failed to
provide a functioning court system capable of providing sufficient legal remedies, as
argued by the Claimant within the varying allegations in this case. However, the Tribunal
finds no manifestly wrongful conduct that could be characterized as such. Accordingly, the
Tribunal rejects the Claimant’s allegation of impermissible arbitrary and discriminatory

measures under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.

DAMAGES

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITIONS ON DAMAGES

The Claimant claims that it is entitled to full compensation according to customary
international law, which requires the Respondent to re-establish the situation that would

have existed if the Respondent had not breached the BIT.”!°

According to the Claimant, if the Respondent had not unlawfully divested the Claimant of
its 100% interest in Kozhan by April 2008, it would have continued to operate Kozhan
until August 2015, at which point it would have sold the company to a third-party, Geo-
Jade — the same company to which the IMR sold Kozhan.’!! The Claimant therefore claims
compensation equal to: (i) the value of loss of profit that it would have made if it had
operated Kozhan from April 2008 to August 2015, and (ii) the proceeds it would have

gained from selling Kozhan to Geo-Jade in the counterfactual scenario.’

The Claimant instructed Mr. Paul Rathbone, an independent valuation expert, to value its
100% interest in Kozhan using the date of the award as valuation date.”!> Mr. Rathbone
estimated USD 519.2 million as the value of the Claimant’s investment in Kozhan as at

September 30, 2018 (a temporary proxy for the date of the award).7!+

To reach this estimate, Mr. Rathbone considered four elements: (i) Kozhan’s projected
cashflow between April 2008 to August 2015 in the “but-for” scenario, (ii) the projected
sum which would have been payable to the Original Owners under the 2003 SPA in the
but-for scenario, (iii) the sum which would have been received by the Claimant as
consideration for the sale of Kozhan to Geo-Jade on August 13, 2015 in the but-for
scenario, and (iv) the interest payable to the Claimant from the assumed date of Kozhan’s

sale (August 2015) to the date of the award.”5

Mr. Rathbone subsequently produced a revised valuation of Kozhan in the sum of USD
460.1 million, having considered some of the comments made by the Respondent’s
expert’s (Dr. Fisher) report which commented on Mr. Rathbone’s valuation.’!°
Mr. Rathbone also provided an expert opinion as to the ex-ante (date of breach) value of
Kozhan as at April 2008 based on the Claimant’s market capitalization,’!” which according
to the Claimant, demonstrates that the Respondent’s expert’s date of breach valuation of

Kozhan is not credible.7!*

The Claimant also relied on an oil industry expert, Mr. Andrew Spriggs, to value Kozhan’s
reserves and resources as at April 2008,’!° in response to the Respondent’s oil industry
expert’s (Dr. Hornbrook) analysis on a reserves-based valuation of Kozhan as at the date

of the alleged breach. ’?°

Relying on the Chorzow Factory case, the Claimant argues that in order to grant full
reparation, the Tribunal is required to compare the Claimant’s actual situation to the
situation that would have existed if the Respondent had not unlawfully deprived the
Claimant of its interest in Kozhan (i.e., the but-for scenario). The Claimant notes that this

approach has been endorsed in many recent awards. ”!

According to the Claimant, in this but-for scenario, it is assumed that the Claimant would
have continued to roll out exploration and development activities on a steady basis from
April 3, 2008 (the date of expropriation) through to August 2015, when the Claimant would
have sold Kozhan to Geo-Jade, an independent buyer, for the price of USD 326.1 million.
This sum was arrived at by reducing the actual sale price of USD 340.5 million which
Geo-Jade paid to the original owners in August 2015, in order to reflect the fact that there

would have been higher production in the counterfactual scenario, and therefore, less

record” as well as the testimony of its witness Mr. Heysel, in support of this counterfactual

scenario. ”>

In response to the Respondent’s criticism that the Claimant’s but-for situation is
unsustainable on evidence, ’** the Claimant argues that it achieved tremendous success with
Kozhan prior to the commencement of the 2003 SPA Proceedings.’”> Mr. Heysel listed
some of the milestones that the Claimant had achieved with Kozhan from 2003 to 2008,
which according to the Claimant, “are reflected in the Claimant’s contemporaneous SEC
filings.” These milestones include: (i) paying the signature bonuses which Kozhan owed
to the Kazakh government, (ii) confirming oil at Morskoye, despite the oil field being
submerged under water, (iii) commissioning a study by Schlumberger to identify potential
hydrocarbon accumulations, (iv) drilling three wells in the Morskoye A Pool, (v) receiving
MEMR approval for commercial production at Morskoye, (vi) drilling other accumulations
identified in the 2005 Schlumberger report and successfully discovering the Morskoye B
Pool and the Ogai Pool, (vii) drilling wells in the Karatal Oil Field and Dauleta Oil Fields,

and (viii) raising over USD 80 million to fund its investment in Kazakhstan.’7°

According to Mr. Heysel, as a result of these achievements, the Claimant’s market
capitalization grew from almost nothing to over USD 350 million.”?” The Claimant further
argues that these achievements also meant that in 2007 - the year of the 2003 SPA
proceedings — the Claimant made a profit of USD 12.5 million. Therefore, the
Respondent’s criticism that the Claimant achieved very little is not supported by the

evidence. 78

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 163 of 184

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITIONS ON DAMAGES

The Respondent’s primary position is that the Claimant’s claim for damages is unrealistic,
as it is designed not only to give the Claimant a “windfall” which the Claimant would not
have been able to get through any legitimate business means, but also to evade the key
question of whether the damages claimed represented “the situation that would, in all

probability, have existed if the Respondent had not breached the BIT.”7°

According to the Respondent, the Claimant’s approach to the calculation of damages is
unsupported by evidence and if indeed damages are due, they must be quantified on a
reserves-based valuation as at the date of breach, or with reference to Claimant’s sunken

costs.7°°

The Respondent instructed an accounting expert, Mr. John Fisher, to prepare a quantum
report and a petroleum engineer, Dr. John Hornbrook, to prepare a technical report on
Kozhan’s available oil reserves and other relevant aspects of the oil and gas industry in

Kazakhstan. ”>!

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s conclusions regarding its “but-for” scenario are
unsustainable on the evidence. According to the Respondent, the Tribunal should reach the
following conclusions on a proper analysis: (i) in a “but-for” situation, the Claimant would
either not have been able to operate Kozhan profitably, or at best, it only would have been
able to invest a fraction of what was invested in Kozhan by the actual owners in the actual
situation; and (ii) it would therefore be unrealistic to conclude that Geo-Jade would have
been willing to buy Kozhan from the Claimant in August 2015, on similar terms to those

negotiated between IMR and the Geo-Jade in August 2015.77

The Respondent asserts that the Claimant’s combination of a date of award valuation with
its assumption of how Kozhan would have operated between April 2008 — August 2015,

seeks not only to de-risk the inherently risky proposition that Kozhan represents, but also

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 164 of 184

to enable the Claimant to take advantage of the growth which Kozhan experienced under
the ownership of IMR - an affiliate of ENRC which is one of the world’s largest private

mining groups, and which brought significant “financial clout” to Kozhan.

The Respondent further argues that the Kozhan’s trajectory in the actual situation cannot
provide a realistic guide as to what Kozhan’s trajectory would have been if it was under
the Claimant’s control. Therefore, the Claimant’s damage case is an attempt to secure a

windfall and obtain through arbitration what it cannot obtain on its own.’

According to the Respondent, to determine the appropriate but-for scenario, two key
questions arise: (i) would the Claimant have operated Kozhan as profitably (or even, as it
claims, more profitably) as the actual owners did from April 2008 to August 2015, and (ii)
would Geo-Jade have been willing to purchase Kozhan from the Claimant in August 2015

on the terms asserted by the Claimant.7*+

To answer these questions, the Respondent refers to contemporaneous evidence as the most
important evidence as to how Kozhan operated under the Claimant’s control from August
2003 to April 2008.7 According to the Respondent, the available evidence does not paint
a positive picture, as the Claimant: (i) did not have a successful track record in exploiting
similar opportunities in Kazakhstan; (ii) had been delisted from OTC-BB; (iii) appeared to
face management retention issues; (iv) reported uncertainty as to its ability to continue as
a going-concern; (v) reported restrictions to additional funding; (vi) reported liquidity
issues; (vii) faced various title challenges; and (viii) had a declining trend on its share price

from early 2006.7°

The Respondent asserts that in a but-for situation, the Claimant would have continued to
incur losses and would not have been able to raise sufficient capital to operate Kozhan.”>”

Therefore, in the circumstances, it is not obvious if the Claimant would have been able to

continue as a going concern in the counter-factual scenario and even if it could be assumed
that the Claimant would have that ability, it is unrealistic to expect from such an
unpromising start that the Claimant would have been able to match the development of

Kozhan that took place in the actual scenario.7**

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant’s claim for compensation does not engage
with the possibility of a partial success of its claims. Thus, if for instance, the Tribunal
were to conclude that the Respondent did not breach the BIT in relation to the 2003 SPA
Proceedings, but that a breach occurred in relation to the 2008 ABT Proceedings, 2009 Set-
Off Proceedings or the 2012 Set-Off Proceedings, then there would be no basis for the

recovery of the Claimant’s 90% interest in Kozhan in the but-for scenario.”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

Because the Tribunal finds no breach of the BIT, it need not engage in issues of causation

and damages.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON Costs

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection
with the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses,
the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for
the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form
part of the award.

Case 2:22-cv-00509 Document 3-1 Filed 03/22/22 Page 168 of 184

This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including

attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

In this arbitration, both Parties have requested that the Tribunal order the other Party to pay
for all costs and expenses of the arbitration, including ICSID fees and expenses, fees and

expenses of experts and fees and expenses spent on legal representation.

It is fairly common practice to allocate costs and fees based on the principle that costs
follow the event. In these proceedings, however, neither party was fully successful in its
claims. That is, the Claimant prevailed on a jurisdictional objection while the Respondent

prevailed on the merits.

As a result of these mixed outcomes, the Tribunal feels a justified outcome requires a more

balanced approach.

The Respondent’s unsuccessful jurisdictional objection in this arbitration accounted for a
significant portion of the written and oral pleadings and the witness examinations at the
Hearing. While the proceedings were not bifurcated to address the jurisdictional concerns,
the Respondent requested such bifurcation, the resolution of which caused additional delay
and increased costs. The Respondent’s jurisdictional objection thus played a significant

role in this arbitration.

Concerning the merits, the Claimant’s case ultimately failed in its entirety, as the Tribunal
has dismissed all of the Claimant’s claims. This is the fundamental result of this arbitration,
and thus while the Tribunal acknowledges that the Respondent also failed in a major aspect
of its case, its success on the merits renders it the more successful party of the two opposing

sides.

As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant should bear a larger share of the
expenses associated with this arbitration than the Respondent, but that such an increased
share should be minimal, reflecting the substantial time and costs allotted to the

Respondent’s failed jurisdictional objection.

Accordingly, the Tribunal determines that the Claimant should bear all of the costs of the

arbitration, while each Party should bear its own legal and expert fees.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Arbitrators’ fees and expenses

Prof. Bernardo M. Cremades 470,030.45
Judge Peter Tomka 164,283.64
Professor Stanimir A. Alexandrov 113,400.00
ICSID’s administrative fees 210,000.00
Direct expenses (estimated) 187,411.33
Total 1,145,125.42

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.’°°

In addition, the Respondent paid USD 3,259 to cover expenses associated with the Parties’
Kazakh experts and witnesses at the Hearing.’*! As a result, the Parties’ respective shares
of the costs of arbitration amounts to USD 572,562.71 for the Claimant and to

USD 575,821.71 for the Respondent.

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent USD 575,821.71 for
the expended portion of the Respondent’s advances to ICSID. The Tribunal chooses to
apply the interest rules originally agreed upon by the Parties before the Respondent’s
alteration of its request in its Reply on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on the Merits and
Quantum. The Tribunal thus orders that this payment be subject to interest at a rate of
12-month USD LIBOR + 2.0%, compounded annually, which shall accrue from 60 days

after the date of the Award until the date upon which payment is made.

The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to
ICSID.

See Respondent’s Statement of Costs, fn. 2 and correspondence between the Centre and the Parties, dated
December 15, 2020.
