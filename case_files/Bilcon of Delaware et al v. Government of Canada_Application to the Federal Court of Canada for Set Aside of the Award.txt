This is an application to set aside the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability dated 17 March
2015 (the “Award”) made by an Arbitral Tribunal constituted under Chapter 11 of the North
American Free Trade Agreement (“NAFTA”), concerning an arbitration arising between
William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton (the
“Claytons”) and Bilcon of Delaware, Inc. (“Bilcon’”) and the Government of Canada
(“Canada”) in Permanent Court of Arbitration Case No. 2009-04. The Award is a final award
with respect to liability and jurisdiction. The damages phase of the arbitral proceeding is
pending.

The applicant, the Attorney General of Canada, makes application for:

e 1. An Order setting aside the Award;

e 2. An Order granting the applicant its costs of this application; and

e 3. Such further and other relief as counsel may advise and as to this Honourable Court
may seem just.

The grounds for the application are:

e 4. Bilcon is a corporation incorporated in the United States of America and the
Claytons are American citizens. Bilcon and certain of the Claytons own or control
Bilcon of Nova Scotia.

e 5. Bilcon of Nova Scotia is a limited liability company incorporated on April 24, 2002
for the purpose of developing a 152 hectare basalt quarry and marine terminal at
Whites Point, a community located on the Digby Neck in south-west Nova Scotia (the
“Whites Point project’).

e 6. On August 7, 2003 the Whites Point project was submitted for review by a Joint
Review Panel (“JRP”), a body constituted under the Canadian Environmental
Assessment Act (S.C. 1992, c. 37) (““CEAA”) and the Nova Scotia Environment Act
(S.N.S. 1994-95, c. 1) (“NSEA”) to gather information on the environmental effects of
the project, and to make recommendations to government decision-makers with
respect to the project.

e 7. On October 22, 2007, the JRP submitted a report to decision-makers in the
Governments of Nova Scotia and Canada setting out its recommendation that the
Whites Point project should not be approved. The Nova Scotia Minister of
Environment and Labour and the Government of Canada accepted the JRP’s
recommendation, respectively on November 20, 2007 and December 18, 2007.

e 8. On June 17, 2008, Bilcon and the Claytons commenced a claim under Chapter 11 of
the NAFTA, alleging that a number of measures taken over the course of the
environmental assessment of the Whites Point project violated Canada’s obligations
under NAFTA Articles 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment), 1102 (National
Treatment) and 1103 (Most-Favoured Nation Treatment).

9. On or about January 29, 2009, an Arbitral Tribunal (“Tribunal”) was constituted
under Chapter 11 of NAFTA to determine the claims of Bilcon and the Claytons.
10. The place of arbitration is Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

11. The applicable rules governing the arbitration are the United Nations Commission
on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules (“UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules”) of
1976, as modified by the provisions of NAFTA Chapter 11.

12. The governing law for the arbitration is NAFTA and applicable rules of
international law.

13. On March 17, 2015, the Tribunal issued the Award in which it unanimously
decided, among other determinations, that the acts of the JRP were attributable to
Canada at international law.

14. By majority decision the Tribunal further decided that Canada had breached its
NAFTA obligations on the following grounds:

o a. The JRP did not assess the Whites Point project in a manner that complied
with the requirements of the environmental assessment laws of Canada and
Nova Scotia, and of Canadian public administrative law; and

ob. The JRP’s non-compliance with the laws of Canada and Nova Scotia
violated NAFTA Articles 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment) and 1102
(National Treatment).

15. The Award contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to
arbitration, contrary to Article 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Commercial Arbitration Code as
enacted and set out in the Schedule to the Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c.
17 qa" Supp.) (the “Code”). In particular:

o a. The Tribunal erred in assuming jurisdiction over the complaints advanced by
Bilcon and the Claytons insofar as the methodology used by the JRP to
conduct the environmental assessment and the recommendations it made to
government decision-makers are not attributable to Canada and therefore not
measures adopted or maintained by Canada to which Chapter 11 applies;

ob. The Award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within
the terms of the submission to arbitration in that it determines the actions of the
JRP violated Canada’s domestic laws;

oc. The Award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the
terms of the submission to arbitration in finding breaches of NAFTA Articles
1105 and 1102 solely on the basis of the Tribunal’s determination that the
actions of the JRP violated Canada’s domestic laws.

16. The Award is in conflict with the public policy of Canada, contrary to Article
34(2)(b)(ii) of the Code insofar as it usurps the judicial review function of Canadian
courts. A determination of whether a JRP’s recommendations departed from the
requirements of Canadian law is one that only Canada’s courts, not NAFTA tribunals,
are authorized to make, and one for which the only prescribed remedies are those that
can be obtained through judicial review, not an award of NAFTA damages.

Treaties, enactments and rules relied upon:

17. The Applicant relies upon:
o a. The NAFTA, including without limitation Chapter 11, as implemented by
the North American Free Trade Agreement Implementation Act, S.C. 1993, c.
44;
ob. The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules of 1976;

o ¢. Commercial Arbitration Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 17 qa Supp.), sections 5 and
6, and the Commercial Arbitration Code, set out as a Schedule thereto; and
o d. Rules 300(f) and 324 of the Federal Court Rules, 1998.

This application will be supported by the following materials:

e 18. The Award, pleadings, exhibits and proceedings in the arbitration record.

e 19. The written submissions in the Mesa Power Group, LLC v. Government of Canada
NAFTA Chapter 11 arbitration made by Mesa Power Group and the Governments of
Canada, the United States, and Mexico, on the Award on Jurisdiction and Liability in
William Ralph Clayton, William Richard Clayton, Douglas Clayton, Daniel Clayton v.
Government of Canada.

e 20. Such further and other materials as counsel may advise and this Honourable Court
may permit.
