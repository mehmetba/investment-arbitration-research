COMPLAINT
OI European Group B.V. (“OIEG”), by its attorneys BAKER & McKENZIE LLP, as and for its
complaint against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela (“Venezuela”), alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION

1. OIEG brings this action, pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a and Article 54 of the
Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States (the “ICSID Convention”), to recognize a unanimous arbitration award for more than $400
million and to enter judgment thereon. !
' There is currently pending in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York a summary proceeding

involving the same parties and the same arbitration award, docket number 15 Civ. 2178 (ALC). Venezuela has argued in that
case that a summary procedure is not appropriate and that OIEG must bring a plenary action under the Foreign Sovereign

Case 1:16-cv-01533 Document1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 2 of 7

2. OIEG is a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the Netherlands.

3. Defendant is the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and, thus, falls under the
provisions of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. § 1602 et seq.

4. This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §
1330 and 28 U.S.C. § 1605 of the FSIA in that, (1), under 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(1), Venezuela
waived its immunity by becoming a party to the ICSID Convention (Mar. 18, 1965, [1966] 17
USS.T. 1291, T.LA.S. No. 6090), and (2) under 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(6), because this is an action
brought to confirm an award that is governed by a treaty, to wit, the ICSID Convention. This
Court also has subject matter jurisdiction over this matter under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a since Plaintiff
seeks to confirm an arbitration award rendered under the ICSID Convention.

5. Venue in the District of Columbia is appropriate under 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(4).

THE ARBITRATION AND THE AWARD

6. On September 7, 2011, OIEG filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID against
Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/11/25. The subject matter of the arbitration dealt with the
expropriation of OIEG’s investment projects in Venezuela.

7. The Request for Arbitration was officially registered on September 26, 2011. The
arbitral tribunal was constituted on March 30, 2012, and held its first session on May 20, 2012.

8. OIEG and Venezuela filed their respective submissions on jurisdictional issues
and the merits in 2012 and 2013. The ICSID tribunal convened a hearing in Paris at which
testimony and arguments were heard on September 16-21, 2013. Both parties provided post-

hearing submissions in November 2013. On March 4, 2015, the ICSID tribunal notified the

 

Immunities Act. OIEG does not agree. Nevertheless, because any action under the FSIA has to be venued in this Court, OIEG is
bringing this lawsuit but does so without prejudice to OIEG’s position that recognition and enforcement of ICSID arbitration
awards under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a may be brought by way of a summary proceeding.

Case 1:16-cv-01533 Document1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 3 of 7

parties that the proceeding was closed in accordance with Rule 38(1) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules, signifying that the ICSID tribunal sought no further submissions from the parties.

9. On March 10, 2015, the ICSID tribunal issued a final arbitration award (the
“Final Award”) in OIEG’s favor, finding that Venezuela expropriated OIEG’s property and was
therefore required to pay just compensation to OIEG.

10. The Final Award imposed pecuniary obligations on Venezuela and specifically
stated the manner in which interest would be computed on both the principal amount and the
award of costs and attorneys’ fees.

11. Consistent with Article 54(2) of the ICSID Convention, a certified copy of the
original Final Award is attached hereto as Exhibit 1. A certified English language
translation of the Final Award is attached hereto as Exhibit 2.

12. The ICSID tribunal awarded (i) US$ 372,461,982 as compensation for
Venezuela’s expropriation, (ii) interest thereon, from October 26, 2010, through the date of
payment, calculated at the LIBOR interest rate for one-year deposits in US dollars, plus 4%,
compounded annually, (iii) US$ 5,750,000 for OIEG’s costs and expenses in the ICSID
arbitration, and (iv) interest thereon, from March 10, 2015, through the date of payment,
calculated at the LIBOR interest rate for one-year deposits in US dollars, plus 4% compounded
annually. As of June 30, 2016, the amount owed under the Final Award is US$ 491,081,701.
This is made up of the following components:

item (i) above, US$ 372,461,982;
item (ii) above, US$ 112,503,490;
item (iii) above, US$ 5,750,000; and
item (iv) above, US$ 366,229.

The details of the interest calculation are provided in Exhibit 3 hereto.

Case 1:16-cv-01533 Document1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 4 of 7

13. No part of the Final Award has been paid.

14. _ As provided for in the ICSID Convention, Venezuela is seeking annulment of the
Final Award before what is known as an ICSID ad hoc Annulment Committee. On July 17,
2015, the ad hoc Annulment Committee entered a provisional stay of enforcement of the Final
Award. On April 4, 2016, the ad hoc Annulment Committee terminated that provisional stay.
The ad hoc Annulment Committee found, inter alia, that there is a question of the risk of
Venezuela’s non-compliance with the Final Award, as Venezuela’s high ranking officials had
stated that Venezuela would not comply with ICSID decisions or with the ICSID Convention. Jd.
at Ql 103-04. Further, the ad hoc Annulment Committee stated that Venezuela would not suffer
irreparable harm if the provisional stay was lifted, but that OIEG could suffer prejudice if the
provisional stay was maintained since “every day of delay that the Committee sanctions by way
of a continuation of the Provisional Stay directly reduces the likelihood of [OIEG] being able to
enforce the Award....” Id. at [{[ 122, 124.

FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION

FOR RECOGNITION OF ICSID ARBITRATION
AWARD PURSUANT TO 22 U.S.C. § 1650a

15. OIEG restates and incorporates all of the foregoing paragraphs of the Complaint
as if set forth fully herein.

16. The Final Award was properly issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention because
the Netherlands and Venezuela were both signatories to the ICSID Convention when the parties
provided their consent to submit the dispute to ICSID Arbitration.

17. The United States is a signatory to the ICSID Convention. The ICSID Convention
clearly states that an ICSID award “shall be binding on the parties and shall not be subject to any

appeal or to any other remedy except those provided for in this Convention.” ICSID Convention,

Case 1:16-cv-01533 Document1 Filed 07/27/16 Page 5 of 7

Art. 53(1). In addition, the ICSID Convention states that “each Contracting State shall recognize
an award rendered pursuant to this Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”
ICSID Convention, Art. 54(1).
18. | Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to automatic
recognition and enforcement in the United States under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, which provides:
(a) An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the
convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States.
The pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and
shall be given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final
judgment of a court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States. The
Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C. 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of
awards rendered pursuant to the convention.
(b) The district courts of the United States (including the courts enumerated
in section 460 of Title 28) shall have exclusive jurisdiction over actions and
proceedings under subsection (a) of this section, regardless of the amount in
controversy.
19. An arbitration award under the ICSID Convention has been issued in OIEG’s
favor.
20. Accordingly, OIEG is entitled to an order recognizing such arbitral award as a
judgment pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, and entering judgment thereon in the amount of
US$ 491,081,701, plus interest at the rates established by the Final Award until payment has
been made in full.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
WHEREFORE, OI European Group B.V. respectfully requests that this Court enter

a.

Ordering that the pecuniary obligations in the Final Award in favor of OI
European Group B.V. and against Venezuela be recognized and entered as

Convention;

dollars, plus 4%, from July 1, 2016 up to the date when payment is made
in full;

Awarding OIEG the costs of this proceeding, and attorneys’ fees as
permitted by law, in an amount to be quantified; and

Granting OIEG such other and further relief as this Court determines is

just and proper under the circumstances.
