Income Tax Act ( hereinafter referred to as the “act”) passed in
pursuance of directions under section 144 C(5) of the Act by Ld
Dispute Resolution Panel ( hereinafter referred to as the “DRP”)
dated 31/12/2015 given with respect to draft assessment
order dated 9/3/2015 passed by the Ld. AO.

When the appeal was called for hearing on 15/10/2016 the Ld.
authorized representative of the appellant submitted a letter
dated 15/10/2016 requesting for adjournment of hearing. It was
submitted that appellant along with its holding company Cairn
Energy PLC is currently engaged in the arbitration under article 9
of the agreement between government of the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the government of the
Republic of India for the promotion and protection of the
investment and proceedings are in progress. Therefore, it was
argued that the issue is already sub-judice before the
International Court of Justice. Therefore, it was argued that
considering the importance of the matter under appeal and its
significant impact, appellant must necessarily consult its
international counsel and due to the short extension previously

given it is not been possible to liaise between Indian and

international counsel in the time allowed. Therefore, the requests
said that appeal might be adjourned until January 2017.

This adjournment application was vehemently objected to by the
Ld. departmental representative stating that that the statement
made in the application that the issue is already sub judice is
factually incorrect. He submitted that assessee has invoked
arbitration under article 9 of the India UK BIPA and three-
member arbitral tribunal has been constituted with both the
claimants and India having appointed one arbitrator reach and
3" arbitrator having been decided by the two-party appointed
arbitrators. The process is ad hoc arbitration governed by the
UNCITRAL Rules, 1976. He further referred to the process of
appointment of the arbitrator in the above application filed by the
assessee and therefore he submitted that adjournment request
is not at all relevant but misleading as well. It was further
submitted that India has conveyed its position in clear terms to
the claimant and the tribunal that tax disputes are outside the
purview of the above agreement. Further, the India has filed on
07/10/2016 an application before the tribunal requesting
bifurcations of the arbitration proceedings whereby the tribunal

has been asked to hear India’s objection to jurisdiction and

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |4

admissibility before proceeding further. Therefore, India has
challenged the authority of the tribunal and the maintainability of
the arbitral proceedings as far as this dispute is concerned. He
therefore submitted that request made for adjournment by the
assessee is liable to be rejected. He further submitted that huge
revenue is locked in the above appeal and therefore it deserves
hear and quick disposal.

We have carefully considered the rival contentions. In addition,
we have noted that this appeal has been filed by assessee on 30°"
of March 2016 and was first listed for hearing on 17 of
October 2016, however, it was adjourned to 15/11/2016 at the
request of the Counsel of the assessee. Further, on the date of
hearing on 15/11/2016, this application was made. As
considerable revenue is locked in the present appeal, we
persuaded both the parties to argue the case irrespective of the
matter pending before the tribunal because the order of the
tribunal, whenever passed may be applied in arbitration
proceedings. It may not have any impact on the tax liability of
the company, as the claim of the assessee is reimbursement of
tax burden suffered in India on the impugned transaction. We

are of the view that keeping the issue unnecessarily pending for a

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

very long time where there is no timeline available about the
disposal of the application of the assessee for arbitration
proceedings, which is pending since 11/03/2014, is not proper.
Hence, we directed both the parties to argue the matter before us
and we have ensured that enough opportunity would be available
to both the parties for putting their case forward. Consequently,
on 15/11/2016, the matter was partly heard and the revenue was
directed to produce the original records and hearing was
adjourned to 18/11/2016. Further, on 18/11/2016, hearing was
further adjourned to 14/12/2016. On 14/12/2016, there was a
further adjournment request, which was acceded to, and the
matter was finally adjourned to 19/12/2016. On 19/12/2016,
matter was argued by both the parties and heard.
In this appeal following grounds of appeal are raised by
appellant: -

Grounds of Appeal

Without prejudice to ongoing international arbitration

proceedings involving Cairn Energy PLC, Cairn UK Holdings

Limited and the Government of India and all its claims,

rights and remedies therein, Cairn UK Holdings Limited

(hereinafter referred to as the "Appellant") craves leave to

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi

AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

prefer appeal against the order dated 25 January 2016
issued by the Learned Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax
(International Taxation) - Circle 1(2)(1), New Delhi
(hereinafter referred to as "AO") under Section 148 / 143(3)
/ 144C(13) of the Act in pursuance of the directions dated
31 December 2015 issued by the Hon'ble Dispute Resolution

Panel -New Delhi (herein referred to as "DRP").

1. The order passed by the AO pursuant to the
directions of the DRP is bad in law and facts and is
liable to be set aside on the grounds set forth below.

2. Assumption of Jurisdiction

2.1. The AO has erred in and the DRP has compounded
that error by confirming the action of the AO in
assuming jurisdiction under Section 147 of the Act,
even when there is no income chargeable to tax of
the Appellant and the conditions precedent for
initiation of reassessment proceedings and various
applicable time lines and requirements have not

been complied with.

ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |7

2.2. The initiation of reassessment proceedings, and
consequently the final assessment order, is without
jurisdiction, merit, is void ab initio and should be

quashed.

3. Levy of Capital gains tax amounting to Rs.

1,02,47,36,42,264

3.1. The AO has erred in and the DRP has further erred in
confirming the action of the AO by holding that the
gain, if any, arising to the Appellant on account of
the sale of shares of Cairn India Holdings Ltd.
("CIHL"), a Jersey Company, to Cairn India Limited
("CIL"), an Indian Company is deemed to accrue or
arise in India under Section 9(1 )(i) of the Act and is,
therefore, chargeable to tax in India.

3.2. The AO has erred and the DRP has further erred by
not appreciating the fact that CIHL is incorporated in
Jersey i.e. the situs of the shares of CIHL is outside
of India and, consequently, the gain, if any, on a

transfer of shares in CIHL is not even deemed to

3.3.

3.4.

3.5.

accrue or arise in India, and is not chargeable to tax
in India.

The AO's interpretation of Section 9 of the Act, as it
stood prior to the amendments pursuant to the
Finance Act, 2012, is ex facie contrary to the
interpretation thereof by the Hon'ble Supreme Court
in Vodafone Holdings B. V. v. Union of India and
Another.

The AO failed to appreciate that the purported
distinctions between the Appellant's case and the
Vodafone case (referred to in paragraph 9.3 of the
final assessment order) are of no consequence in
determining the chargeability of the transaction to
tax in India.

The AO has erred in and the DRP has further
erred in not appreciating the fact that the transaction
which gives rise to the assessment order at dispute
is purely an internal group restructuring, prior to the
listing of CIL's shares on stock exchanges in India. It
is submitted that the above — referenced

reorganisation resulted in new subsidiaries in the

corporate group but did not generate any real
income or crystallise any new value and is,
therefore, not chargeable to tax in India.

The AO has erred in and the DRP has further erred in
not considering the various decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court of India on the computation of real
income and in not appreciating the contention of the
Appellant that no real income or gain has accrued to
the Appellant on account of the transfer of shares to
CIL and a mere accounting entry cannot be income,
unless real income has actually been earned. Clearly,
there was no commercial transaction with any
outside third party and no gain \sas derived from
any outside third party. Accordingly, there was no
real income or gain realized by the Appellant in
connection with these transactions. The AO and the
DRP failed to appreciate that the essential elements
for imposing capital gains tax do not exist in the
present case.

In purporting to rely on the amount of goodwill in

CIL's consolidated financial statements as indicative

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

3.8.

Page |10

of the Appellant's gain on the transaction, the AO
and the DRP failed to appreciate that this is a mere
accounting entry mandated by Accounting Standard
21 on Consolidation of Accounts, and that such
goodwill is the difference between the value of the
investment in CIHL and the book value of the assets
acquired, and not the fair value.

Based on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the DRP and the AO erred in not accepting the
contentions of the Appellant that, in any event, by
virtue of transactions of "exchange", within the
meaning of Section 2(47) of the Act, which resulted
in the Appellant acquiring the impugned shares of
CIHL, the aggregate cost of acquisition of such
shares in the hands of the Appellant had to be
considered at Rs 26,681 crore, as per principles laid
down by the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India, being
equal to the ultimate sale price realized by the
Appellant on subsequent sale of the said shares in
favour of CIL; and therefore no capital gains exigible

to income tax under Section 45, read with Section 48

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |11

of Act, ever arose in the hands of the Appellant.
Even otherwise, the AO's computation of the cost of
acquisition of the CIHL shares in the hands of the
Appellant is incorrect.

3.9 Based on the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the AO and DRP failed to appreciate that there
was no transfer of, or change in control over, any
underlying assets in India, as even after the sale of
CIHL shares by CUHL to CIL, CIHL and the
companies under it remained subsidiaries of CUHL
and the ultimate parent company and control of the
group remained with the same person i.e. Cairn
Energy PLC. Accordingly, even the purported
Explanations 4 and 5 to Section 9(I)(i),introduced
with retrospective effect pursuant to the Finance Act,
2012, have no applicability and cannot be relied on.

3.10. The AO failed to appreciate that his reliance on the
‘separate entity’ approach necessarily precludes
reliance on the newly-inserted Explanation 5 to
Section 9(1 )(i) of the Act, which disregards the

separate entity approach in order to determine the

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |12

situs of shares in a foreign company based on the
location of the underlying assets.

3.11. Based on the facts and in the circumstances of this
case and on the premise of the grounds mentioned
above, the order under Section 147 of the Act dated
25th January 2016, levying income-tax on alleged
capital gains amounting to Rs 24,504 Crore in the
hands of the Appellant, is patently illegal and thus

liable to be quashed.

4. Erroneous findings of the AO

4.1. The AO has erred in concluding that "the money was
remitted out of the country bypassing or
circumventing all procedural requirements". The AO
failed to appreciate that all regulatory requirements
were complied with, and that it was these very
requirements that dictated the structuring of the
transaction. The AO erred in concluding that the
structuring of the transaction was to avoid paying

tax.

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |13

4.2. The AO has erred in concluding that the final
tranche of transfer of CIHL shares for cash was not
disclosed in the application to the Foreign
Investment Promotion Board, nor was any approval
taken for this. The AO failed to appreciate that this
final tranche is specifically referred to in the above
referenced application and no separate approval was
required in relation to such transfer of CIHL shares

for cash.

4.3. The AO has erred in concluding that the relevant
facts relating to the alleged income of the Appellant
were unearthed only because of the survey under
Section 133A of the Act by the Department on 15
January 2014. The AO failed to appreciate that all
relevant facts were available with the Department

several years prior to the above referenced survey.

5. Incorrect levy of interest under Section 234A and 234B of

the Act

5.1. The AO has erred in and the DRP has further erred
in confirming levy of interest under Section
234AoftheAct.

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016

AY 2007-08
http://www. itatonline.org

Page |14

5.2. The AO has erred in and the DRP has further
erred in confirming levy of interest under Section
234B of the Act. The AO has further erred in
incorrectly following the directions of the DRP
without providing any opportunity of being heard to

the Appellant.

5.3. The AO failed to appreciate that, having
acknowledged that the alleged liability to tax arose
pursuant to the amendments introduced by the
Finance Act, 2012, no interest ought to have been

levied.
6. Initiation of Penalty proceedings

6.1. The AO based on the directions of the DRP has
erred in initiating penalty proceedings under Section
271(I)(c) of the Act against the Appellant, failing to
appreciate that the Appellant has not concealed any
particulars of income nor has the Appellant furnished

inaccurate particulars of income.

6.2. The AO failed to appreciate that, having

acknowledged that the alleged liability to tax arose

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |15

pursuant to the amendments introduced by the
Finance Act, 2012, no penalty ought to have been

levied.

7. The Appellant reserves the right to add, amend,
alter or vary all or any of the above grounds of

appeal as they or their representative may think fit.

06. During the course of hearing appellant made an application for

admission of additional ground as under :-

“The Appellant prays for the admission and adjudication by the
Hon'ble Tribunal, of the following additional grounds of appeal,
which do not require investigation into, or examination of, any
new facts or evidence that were not already available before
the Assessing Officer and Dispute Resolution Panel; this merely
involves interpretation of the provisions of the Income-tax Act,
1961 (‘the Act') as furtherance or advancement of ground no
(2) of the memorandum of appeal (Pg. No. 4) which the
Hon'ble Tribunal is otherwise competent to do, in view of the
principles of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of National

Thermal Power Corporation Limited 229 ITR 383 (SC). Further,

the Appellant believes that the existing grounds are wide
enough to cover these grounds, however, as a matter of good

order it is filing these as additional grounds.

Below Ground No. 2.2, the following grounds are added:

“2.3 On the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the learned AO has erred in completing
reassessment proceedings under section 147 / 148 of
the Act based on the incorrect approval obtained
under section 151 (2) of the Act;

2.4 On the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the learned AO has erred in completing
reassessment proceedings under section 147 / 148 of
the Act based on the issue of an invalid notice under
section 143(2) of the Act which is the primary
requirement for initiation of any assessment

proceedings;”

Below Ground No. 3.11, the following grounds are added;

“3.12 On the facts and in the circumstances of the
case, the learned AO has erred in taxing the
Appellant by invoking the retrospective amendment
to Section 9(1X0 of the Act introduced in the Finance
Act, 2012, which was not on the statute when the
India - United Kingdom Tax Treaty entered into
force. It is therefore submitted that the taxability of
the Appellant should have been determined under
the provisions of section 9(I)(i) the Act which were
applicable when the India - United Kingdom Tax

Treaty was entered into force”.

Brief facts of the case is appellant is a company limited by shares
incorporated on 26" June 2006 in United Kingdom. On 15" of
January 2014, survey was conducted under section 133A of the
Income Tax Act by the director of investigation, New Delhi at the
office premises of Cairn India Ltd and report of the survey was
received by the investigation wing of the income tax Department.
According to that investigation report, there were certain
documents related to the assessee were found such as financial
statements, red herring prospectus of Cairn India Ltd, statement

of some officers of Cairn India Ltd, an agreement for conversion

of debt and subscription and share purchase agreement. Those
documents were analysed by the Ld. assessing officer and
pursuant to that notice under section 148 of the Income Tax Act
was issued on 21/01/2014. In response to that notice appellant
filed return of income on 03/04/2014 declaring nil income.
Appellant further requested for reasons for reopening of the
assessment vide its letter dated 10/06/2014 which was provided
to the assessee by the Ld. assessing officer vide letter dated
25/07/2014. Appellant objected to the reasons recorded by the
assessing officer and such objections were disposed of by order
dated 19/02/2015. On basis of that return, notice under section
143 (2) was issued. Also, Notice under section 142 (1) on
07/05/2014 and summons under section 131, dated 20/01/2014
and 22/01/2014 were issued along with the questionnaire.
Against all these notices and summons, assessee sought time.
The Ld. assessing officer gave a further opportunity vide letter
dated 08/10/2014 to the assessee requesting to furnish the
details against which the assessee submitted it on 16/10/2014.
As the Ld. assessing officer found that assessee has not
submitted details as required according to the earlier

questionnaire, further letter dated 19/11/2014 was issued

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi

Page |19

against which assessee further submitted adjournment
applications on these occasions for additional time for 4 weeks.
As the information was not forthcoming from the assessee. The
Ld. assessing officer exercised powers under section 133 (6) of
the act and asked details from Cairn India Limited , purchaser
of the shares of Cairn India Holdings Limited.

The facts of the impugned transaction, undisputedly are noted

by the Ld. assessing officer in para No. 7 of his order as under:-

“7. Analysis of the transaction of sale of shares of CIHL by
Assessee (CUHL) to CIL.

7.1 Transfer of the Indian Assets from Cairn Energy Plc to
CUHL

Cairn UK Holdings Ltd. (CUHL in short) was incorporated on
26.06.2006 in the United Kingdom as a 100% subsidiary of
Cairn Energy PLC (CEP). Cairn Energy PLC, a company
incorporated in Scotland was holding various oil and gas
assets in India through its direct/indirect foreign subsidiaries.
In the year 1995, CEP acquired participating interest in the
underlying Indian assets. On 30.06.2006, Cairn UK Holdings
Ltd. (CUHL) issued 22,14,44,034 ordinary shares of face value
of 1£ each to Cairn Energy PLC (CEP) in exchange for the
entire issued share capital of the subsidiaries of Cairn Energy
PLC which owned Indian assets in the form of Oil and Gas
blocks.

7.1.1 Debt Conversion Agreement

On 1 September, 2006 Cairn UK Holdings Ltd increased its
authorized share capital to 25,15,00,000 £ 1 ordinary shares
and further issued 2,97,80,710 £ 1 ordinary shares at par to
Cairn Energy Plc pursuant to a debt conversion agreement

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |20

between Cairn Energy Plc, Cairn UK Holdings Limited, Cairn
India Holdings Limited and Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited
(a subsidiary of Cairn India Holdings at this time).

In summary, this agreement provided that £ 2,97,80,710 due
to Cairn Energy Plc from Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Limited
was assigned to Cairn UK Holdings Ltd in exchange for an
issue of shares. Cairn UK Holdings subsequently assigned the
debt to Cairn India Holdings Ltd in exchange for 2,97,80,710 £
1 ordinary shares in Cairn India Holdings Ltd.

Basically Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Ltd. was under a debt of
£ 2,97,80,710 from Cairn Energy Plc. As per the debt
conversion agreement, the same was made due to Cairn UK
Holdings Ltd. (CUHL). In lieu of the same, CUHL issued
2,97,80,710 shares of £ 1 each to Cairn Energy Plc on
01.09.2006.

7.1.2 Transfer of the Indian Assets from CUHL to CIHL

On 02.08.2006, CUHL incorporated another 100% subsidiary
Cairn India Holdings Ltd. (CIHL for short) which was registered
in Jersey, Channel Islands. On 07.08.2006, CUHL transferred
its entire shareholding in the above-mentioned 26 companies
to Cairn India Holdings Ltd. (CIHL). In return, Cairn India
Holdings Ltd. (CIHL) issued 22,14,44,034 ordinary shares of 1
£ each to CUHL. At the same time, as per the debt conversion
agreement mentioned above, CUHL assigned the debt of £
2,97,80,710 to Cairn India Holdings Ltd. & Cairn India
Holdings Ltd. further issued 2,97,80,710 ordinary shares of 1
£ each in exchange to CUHL. Now the debt amount of £
2,97,80,710 became due to Cairn India Holdings Ltd. (CIHL)
from Cairn Energy Hydrocarbons Ltd. Thus as on 01.09.2006
CUHL was holding 22,14,44,034 + 2,97,80,710 =
25,12,24,744 ordinary shares of £ 1 each of Cairn India
Holdings Ltd. (CIHL).

On 15 September, 2006 Cairn UK Holdings Ltd entered into
the Subscription and Share Purchase Agreement with Cairn
India Limited and Cairn India Holdings Limited (both

Agreement provided for Cairn India Limited to acquire
approximately 21.85% of share capital of Cairn India Holdings
Limited in two tranches. Subsequently a new Share Purchase
Deed was signed on 12.10.2006 and the entire share holding
of Cairn India Holdings Ltd was acquired by Cairn India Ltd,
from CUHL.

By virtue of purchase of 100% shares of CIHL from CUHL, CIL
acquired the entire Indian business of the group. CIL acquired
(purchased) 25,12,24,744 shares of CIHL from CUHL for a
total consideration of Rs. 26,681,87,10,140. This transaction
was carried out in the following manner:

7.2.1 The Financial statement of Cairn UK Holdings Ltd as
on 31 Dec 2006 contains the following information (Report of

3 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
Operating segments;

The Group’s operating segments were revised following the
restructuring carried out in anticipation of the IPO in India to
reflect the revised organizational structure. During the year
ended 31 December 2006, the Group’s operating activities
were internally reported to the chief operating decision maker
based on two separable areas grouped into different subsidiary
entities:

a) Capricorn Energy Limited Group and
b) Cairn India Limited Group.

A third segment ‘Other’ exists to accumulate Cairn UK
Holdings Limited and Cairn Energy PLC company which will
include the administrative expenses of Cairn’s head office in
Edinburgh. This also includes taxation and interest expenses of
the Group which cannot be allocated to an operating segment.

In 2005 the operating segments were North Sea, South Asia
and Head Office Costs, Comparative information has been
restated to reflect the new operating segments. There is no
overall financial impact of this change.

The segment results for the year ended 31 December 2006 are
as follows:

7.5.1 Thus even the annual report 2006 of Cairn Energy
Plc makes it amply clear that the entire business of the Cairn
Energy Plc group was reorganized in two groups namely Cairn
India group and Capricorn Group. The assets owned by the
subsidiaries of Cairn India Holdings Ltd. were entirely Indian
assets. Moreover, it is also noticeable that even the Indian

operations, revenue from the Indian operations and Indian
assets formed a substantial part of the operations, revenues
and assets of the Cairn Energy Plc group as a whole.”

Based on the above facts, Ld. assessing officer examined the
taxability of the above transactions whether chargeable to tax in
India under section 4, 5 and section 9 (1) (i) of the Income Tax Act
and as per DTAA _ between India UK. He was further of the opinion
that appellant acquired the entire assets of the 26 subsidiaries of Cairn
energy group whose entire business operation is in India and therefore
the impugned assets, which were transferred, were located in India.
For this he referred to the notes on accounts of the financial
statements of the appellant for the year ending December 2006,
wherein in note No. 7 under the heading ‘Investment’, details of the
subsidiaries, country of operation and country of incorporation were
mentioned. Most of the companies operations were in India and even
the functional currency of the appellant was in Indian rupees. He
further referred to the red Herring prospectus issued by Cairn India
Ltd at the time of initial public offer. He further referred to the
valuation report obtained by Cairn India Ltd with respect to valuation
of shares of Cairn India Holdings Ltd from and M Rothschild and Sons
India private limited dated 18/09/2006 and 19/12/2006. Therefore

according to him, all the assets of cairn India Holdings Ltd and its

ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |36

subsidiaries are located in India alone. He further referred to the
various statements given by various employees of cairn India Ltd to
support his contention. In para No. 8.6 of his order he further referred
that none of the employees of the subsidiaries, which were subject to
transfer, was employed outside India and, therefore the entire
workforce of the PE of Cairn Group , was employed _ in India only.
Therefore, he further held that workforce is also located in India. In
para No. 8.8 of his order he referred to the certificate of incorporation
of cairn India Holdings Ltd issued by Jersey financial services
commission which shows that the company will act as a holding
company for a number of companies within the cairn group, which in
turn hold Indian oil and gas assets. Therefore he held that that the
shares of cairn India Holdings Ltd, which were acquired by cairn India
Ltd from appellant derive their value solely from the assets located in
India and, therefore, in accordance with the provisions of section 9 (1)
(i) of the Income Tax Act, it shall be deemed to have been situated in
India and consequently any capital gain arising from the transfer of
such shares are chargeable to tax under the Indian Income Tax Act,
1961. He further held that on transfer of shares of cairn India Holdings
Ltd from cairn UK Holdings Ltd (appellant) to cairn India Ltd, entire

control of oil and gas business of cairn group in India is transferred

Page |37

from appellant to cairn India Ltd, therefore, the liability to pay capital
gains tax in India arises. Applying the average conversion rate of I
GBP to Rs. 86.71, he held that total investment made by appellant in
acquiring 25,12,24,744 shares of cairn India Holdings Ltd is Rs.
2178,36,97,552/- which is cost of acquisition of those shares and as
Cairn India Ltd has paid Rs. 26,681,87,10,140/- to appellant for
acquiring these shares, which is the full value of consideration received
or accrued , it resulted into capital gain chargeable to tax as short-
term capital gain of Rs. 245,03,50,12,588/-.

Before the assessing officer, assessee contended vide its reply dated
21/4/2014 that the transaction does not give rise to any tax liability in
India based on the law that prevailed on the date of entering into the
transaction as such there was no liability to withhold any tax by the
Cairn India Ltd. Assessee relied on the certificate given by a chartered
accountant and submitted that that the transaction was also verified
by various tax authorities, including income tax authority. It was
further submitted that that the impugned transactions is a genuine
case of group restructuring, which is not subject to taxation in India. It
was further submitted that there was no change in the management
and control. Therefore, the conditions stipulated in the definition of the

term property is clarified by the The Finance Act, 2012 has not been

satisfied and therefore in view of the provisions of section 9 (1) (i), 2
(47) and 2 (14) of the Income Tax Act , it is clear that the purpose of
the amendment was only to tax those transactions wherein the shares
of the foreign company have been sold resulting into transfer of
management and control. Hence the above transaction is not
chargeable to tax in India.

The Ld. AO dealt with the submission of the assessee in para No. 9 of
his order. He first considered the legal structure of the assessee and
chronology of events of acquisition of those shares, which resulted into
transfer of control of Indian business from appellant to cairn India Ltd.
He further referred to the subscription and shares purchase
agreement dated 15/09/2006 and its amendment dated 05/10/2006
entered into between appellant , the seller of the shares, Cairn India
Ltd, the purchaser of the shares, along with the guarantor of the
transactions and the company, whose shares are transacted . He
further analysed the share purchase deed dated 12/10/2006 and the
red Herring prospectus of cairn India Ltd, through book building
process. Therefore, he held that all these agreements analysed with
chronological event of transactions, It resulted in changing the cairn
group structure. He also demonstrated that the whole transaction is

for transferring assets in India through various subsidiaries - holding

corporate structure. He further analyzed the business operation,
nature of income and location of country of operation of the 26
intermediaries companies whose assets are dealt with in_ this
transaction and held that the country of operation of the most of the
companies who are in operation is in India. He further referred to the
fact of initial public offering and held that the shareholding of the
appellant in the Indian company i.e. cairn India Ltd got reduced to
68.98% post-IPO as 31.02% _ is held by public post IPO. However,
the number of equity shares of appellant’s in the cairn India Ltd
remained the same pre-IPO and post-IPO i.e. 1226843785 shares. To
support his finding he also referred to the application dated
02/08/2006 filed by the Cairn India Holdings Ltd, incorporated in
Jersey , before the Jersey financial services commission wherein it is
submitted that cairn India Ltd will purchase 20% of the issued share
capital of the company from appellant with an option to purchase the
remaining 80% at a later stage. The cairn India Ltd (proposed
company) will be listed on the Bombay stock exchange in order to
raise funds to purchase the remaining 80% of the shares of the
company. Therefore, he held that that though cairn India Ltd was
incorporated only on 21/08/2006 the fact was submitted before the

Jersey authorities on 02/08/2006 itself. He further referred to the

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |40

various payments made in trenches by cairn India limited to the
appellant. Based on this he came to conclusion that the above
arrangement structured by the cairn energy group was to
systematically divest its stake in Indian oil and gas business. Therefore
he held that the affairs of the group were structured in such a manner
that the shares of companies which are operating, using and owning
the assets in India in oil and gas business were first transferred to
a UK-based holding company from where they were transferred to the
Jersey-based another holding company and then such shares are
ultimately sold to an Indian entity for substantial cash and share
consideration, all within a period of 3 months. He further held that all
these facts have been unearthed only because of the survey under
section 133A of the Income Tax Act by the revenue on 15/01/2014.
The fact was also noted that revenue has invoked provisions of
section 281B of the act provisionally attaching the shares to safeguard
its interest. Regarding the claim of assessee that these transactions
were already disclosed to revenue, he held that appellant has not filed
any return of income for assessment year 2007 - O08 and the
transactions were only disclosed in form No. 3 CEB before the Ld.
transfer pricing officer for determination of arm’s length price by the

Indian associated enterprise i.e. cairn India Ltd. He therefore held that

http://www. itatonline.org

[44

the issue there was only for determination of arm’s length price in
the hands of an Indian entity and not the chargeability of the capital
gain tax in the hands of appellant, therefore there was no disclosure
made by the assessee as no return of income was filed for the
impugned assessment year. He further referred to the disclosure of the
transaction made by the Indian entity in the Red Herring prospectus
and approval obtained from Foreign Investment Promotion Board and
held that there is no concept of ‘group taxation’ under the Indian
Income Tax Act and Indian entity and the appellant are two different
assesses. Hence, it cannot be said to be a disclosure at all. He further
referred to the provisions of section 47 (iv) rws 47A of the act and
held that same are not applicable to the impugned transaction, as the
appellant or its nominee did not hold the whole of the share capital of
the Indian subsidiaries companies on the date of transfer of capital
asset on 29/12/2006. According to him the conditions prescribed
under section 47A of the Income Tax Act of holding of the whole of
the share capital of the subsidiary company for a period of at least 8
years from the date of the transfer of the capital asset is not satisfied
and therefore the exemption under section 47 (iv) does not apply to
the appellant. Further, vide para No. 9.2, he analysed the various legal

provisions of section 2 (14), 5 and 9 of the Act and held that where

an asset or source of income, which is situated in India or where the
capital assets is situated in India, all income which accrues or arises
directly or indirectly through or from it shall be treated as income,
which is deemed to accrue or arise in India and therefore the gain
arising from the impugned transaction is chargeable to tax in India.
He further held that due to the amendment in the Income Tax Act by
the Finance Act, 2012, interpretation made by the Hon’ble Supreme
Court of India in Vodafone International Holdings BV versus union of
India and another (341 ITR 1) (SC) is not available to the assessee.
He therefore held that Cairn India Ltd, an Indian company, has taken
control of the assets and operations situated in India of cairn group
which was acquired indirectly through purchase of shares of the
holding company cairn India Holdings Ltd, which was incorporated in
jersey, hence the capital gains arising to the appellant are deemed to
accrue or arise in India and are taxable as short-term capital gain
under the provisions of the Income Tax Act.

The Ld. assessing officer then dealt with the reply filed by the cairn
India Ltd on 21% April 2014 , in response to notice under section 133
(6) of the Act , wherein it has been argued that amendments made to
the provisions of section 9 (1) (i) are prospective in nature as it is

substantive provision and cannot create a retro obligation on the tax

deductor who has taken a bona fide stand according to the law
prevalent on that date. With respect to this, the Ld. assessing officer
held that there is an amendment by The Finance Act, 2012 with
retrospective effect from 01/04/1962 which clearly mentions that all
income accruing or arising whether directly or indirectly through the
transfer of a capital asset situated in India is chargeable to tax as it is
deemed to accrue or arise in India. The Ld. assessing officer further
drew support from the memorandum of The Finance Act, 2012,
explaining the position of the legislature. Therefore he rejected the
contention of the cairn India Ltd that the amendments are prospective
in nature and further held that Cairn India Ltd made payment of Rs.
26, 6818710140/- to the appellant for acquiring Indian assets through
hundred percent shareholding of Cairn India Holdings Ltd and the
resulting capital gains for taxable in the hands of the appellant. The
Ld. assessing officer further drawing support from the decision of the
Hon’ble Supreme Court in CIT versus Vatika Township private limited
and held that the language of the expiration for an expression 5 which
is been inserted w.r.e.f. 01/04/1962, amendments are clarificatory in
nature and the operation is retrospective.

After holding that the capital gain arising in the hands of the appellant

on account of sale of 100% shares of Cairn India holding Ltd which

derive their value solely from the assets located in India, is taxable in
India as per the provisions of section 9 (1) (i) of the Income Tax Act,
he also applying the provisions of section 48 of the Income Tax Act
determined the actual ‘cost of acquisition’ of those assets. As
appellant acquired 100 % _ shareholding of Cairn India holding Ltd,
Jersey for GBP 251224444, from cairn energy plc, Scotland by issue
of shares @at UK pound 1/-. Applying the rate of Rs. 86.71 for UK
pound, total investment of Rs. 21783697552/- was determined. The
date of acquisition was also determined at 07/08/2006. Therefore, he
worked out the cost of acquisition of the asset at Rs. 2178.36 crores
and held that as the shares were held for less than 12 months on
transfer of appellant has derived short term capital gain chargeable to
tax of Rs. 245035012588/- and further the tax payable at the rate of
40% thereon was determined subject to applicable surcharge and
cess.

The Ld. assessing officer was also aware that the appellant was
resident of United Kingdom therefore the provisions of India United
Kingdom Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement are applicable to it
and if any beneficial treatment is available, shall be given to
appellant. Therefore he examined article 13 (sicl14) of India- UK

DTAA and held that capital gains are taxable as per the domestic laws

ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

Page |45

of respective countries, therefore, the Double Taxation Avoidance
Agreement does not contain any beneficial provisions for the assessee
but directs the chargeability of capital Gain according to the domestic
tax laws i.e. Income tax Act, 1961. Hence the amount is chargeable to
tax, according to the domestic laws of India. Based on this he
framed draft assessment order under section 143 (3) rws section 148
and section 144 C (1) of the Income Tax Act on 09/03/2015.

Assessee preferred its objection against the draft assessment order to
the Dispute resolution panel under section 144C of the act on which
the directions were issued under section 144C (5) of the Income Tax
Act, 1961 on 31%. December 2015. Certain facts were also noted at
page No. 4 and 5 of the direction wherein it has been mentioned that
a civil writ petition challenging retrospective application of amendment
was filed by Cairn India Ltd before the Hon’ble Delhi High Court, which
has been withdrawn, and thus stands dismissed as withdrawn. Ld
DRP also rejected claim of the assessee that transactions were part
of internal reorganization of the group and are revenue neutral. In
nutshell, it rejected all the contentions of the assessee about the
chargeability of capital gain in the hands of the assessee. On the
aspect of the computation, it also rejected all the contentions including

the decision referred before it of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in CIT

versus Gillanders Arbuthnot & co 87 ITR 407 (SC) and upheld the
computation of capital gains. Another objection raised before the Ld.
Dispute Resolution Panel about the pendency of international
arbitration and therefore requested to keep the proceedings pending
was rejected. It was further objected before the Ld. Dispute
Resolution Panel that interest under section 234A, 234B and 234C and
234D of the Income Tax Act is not chargeable because taxes required
to be deducted by the Indian entity who paid such sum u/s 195 of the
Act. Ld. DRP rejected the contention of the assessee with respect to
interest under section 234A and 234C, whereas for the purpose of
interest under section 234B Ld. AO is directed to reconsider the issue
with clear-cut finding in his order. Therefore, in nutshell all the
objections raised by the assessee were rejected by Id DRP approving
the draft assessment order confirmed in toto by the Ld. Dispute
Resolution Panel.

Consequently, Id AO framed order under section 143 (3) rws section
148 and section 144C (13) of the Income Tax Act final assessment
order on 25" January 2016 determining the total income of the
assessee at Rs. 245035012588/- as _ short-term capital gain
chargeable to tax in the hands of appellant taxable at the rate of 40%.

Subject to chargeability of surcharge and cess as applicable. Further,

with respect to chargeability of interest under section 234B of the
Income Tax Act Ld. assessing officer held that as assessee was liable
to pay advance tax on such income, which it has failed to do so, and
no tax was deducted at source, therefore it is chargeable. In view of
this, the Ld. assessing officer further passed an order that interest
under section 234A, 234B, 234C and 234D of the act is chargeable
according to the provisions of the Act. Therefore aggrieved by the
order of the Ld. assessing officer the assessee has preferred this
appeal before us.

With respect to additional grounds of appeal filed before us it was
submitted that that these additional grounds are with respect to
reopening of the assessment proceedings such as_ incorrect approval
obtained under section 151 (2) of the act as well as on the issue of an
invalid notice under section 143 (2) of the Income Tax Act. It was
further submitted that ground No. 3.12 raised is with respect to
invocation of the retrospective amendment to section 9 (1) (i) of the
act introduced in The Finance Act, 2012 which was not on the statute,
When the India United Kingdom tax treaty entered into force. Hence, it
is submitted that tax liability of the appellant should have been
determined under the provisions of section 9 (1) (i) of the act which

were applicable when the India United Kingdom tax treaty was entered

into force. It was submitted that all these grounds of appeal are
though covered under the ground No. 2 and 3 of the memorandum of
appeal, however, these are legal grounds and they do not require any
investigation into the facts are examination of any new facts or
evidence that are not available already before the assessing officer and
Dispute Resolution Panel, therefore, they may be admitted. The
assessee placed reliance on the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court
in the case of national thermal power Corporation limited to 29 ITR
383 (SC) to support its claim for admission of these additional
grounds.

Ld. departmental representative, vehemently objected to the
admission of additional ground and stated that as these grounds are
not raised before the Ld. Dispute Resolution Panel or before the Ld.
assessing officer the contentions are new and therefore same may not
be admitted.

We have carefully considered the rival contentions. We are of the
opinion that all these additional grounds of appeal raised by the
assessee are legal in nature and no further facts are required to be
investigated, therefore, in the interest of Justice these are admitted.
Now we come to the main grounds of appeal on which submission

made by the assessee. Ground No. 1 of the appeal of the assessee is

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |49

general in nature, arguing that the order passed by the Ld. assessing
officer pursuant to the direction of the Ld. Dispute Resolution Panel is
bad in law and facts and is liable to be set-aside on the ground set
forth below. No specific argument were led on this ground and as it is
a preamble to the other grounds of the appeal, it is general in nature,
hence, dismissed.

Ground No. 2 of the appeal of the assessee is with respect to the
assumption of jurisdiction u/s 148 of the Act. The main contention of
the assessee is that the Ld. assessing officer has erred and Ld. Dispute
Resolution Panel has compounded that error by confirming the action
of the Ld. assessing officer in assuming jurisdiction under section 147
of the act, even when there is no income chargeable to tax of the
appellant and which is the condition precedent for initiation of
reassessment proceedings and various applicable timelines and
requirements have not been complied with. It is further submitted
that the initiation of the reassessment proceedings and consequently,
the final assessment order is without jurisdiction, bad , is void ab-initio
and should be quashed.

The Ld. authorized representative of the assessee has challenged the
validity of the reassessment proceedings under section 147 of the

Income Tax Act, 1961 with respect to the approval granted under

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |50

section 151 (2) of the Income Tax Act which has not been correctly
provided. It is further contended that that the notice issued under
section 143 (2) of the act was issued before the disposal of the
objection against the reopened proceedings. It was the contention of
the Ld. authorized representative that the notice was issued under
section 143 (2) of the Income Tax Act on 06/06/2014, whereas the
objections were disposed of on 19/02/2015. It is further objected
that the recorded reasons provided by the Ld. assessing officer are not
signed. It is further contended that that information regarding the
share transfer of Cairn India Holdings Ltd was available with the Ld.
assessing officer of Cairn India Ltd during regular assessment
proceedings of the Cairn India Ltd, therefore, the revenue was always
aware about the transfer of the shares, hence the order passed by the
Ld. assessing officer is without application of mind. He further argued
that reasons for reopening were contrary to the law laid down by the
Supreme Court decision in case of Vodaphone International versus
union of India (2012) (341 ITR 1) (SC). It is further argued that
reopening of the assessment in the instant case is based on the survey
report conducted on the premises of Cairn India limited and in all
likelihood; the said survey report had been received by the Ld.

assessing officer after the issuance of the notice under section 148 of

ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

Page |51

the Income Tax Act. Therefore, the action of the reopening of the
assessment by the Ld. assessing officer has been attacked on several
counts by the Ld. authorized representative in ground No. 2 of the
appeal of the assessee. The assessee submitted on each of these

issues as under:-

1. Approval required under Section 151(2) of the Act is
not correctly provided

Relevant Facts under consideration;

1.1. In the notice issued under Section 148 of the Act,
there was no mention of the sanction / approval of the
higher authorities as required under section 151(2) of the
Act (refer page no. 7 of the Paper Book}. Further, on 25
July 2014, when copy of the recorded reasons for
reopening of assessment was provided by the AO to the
Appellant, the said reasons were neither signed nor was
containing any sanction / approval of the higher authorities
as contemplated under Section 151(2) of the Act (refer
page no. 22 to 30 of the Paper Book).

1.2. During the course of DRP_ proceedings, vide
submission dated 29 September 2016 the Authorized
Representative ('AR') raised an objection that the required
approval under section 151(2) of the Act is not obtained by
the AO. To the above, DRP Members referred the matter
back to the file of the AO and asked the AO to submit the
required approvals.

1.3. Further, since this approval was one of the important
documents, Appellant also wanted to see the records and
ensure that due process of law is followed and the
reassessment proceedings are not without jurisdiction. In
view of the same, during the course of DRP proceedings,
the Appellant, vide its letter dated 2 November 2015 and
15 December 2015, also filed a request before the AO to

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |52

provide access to the records which was not available with
the Appellant (refer page no. 48 and 49 of the Paper
Book).

1.4. Vide its letter dated 03 December 2015, AO replied
to the DRP members that "... administrative approval of
the Add/. CIT for issuance of notice under section 148 of
the Act has been taken on 21 January 2014 which was
within the prescribed time limit under section 151(2) of the
IT Act.” (refer page no. 50 of the Paper Book). Further, in
the said letter AO also mentioned that "A copy of the
reasons for reopening of assessment under section 148(2)
along with the copy of approval of issue of notice u/s 148
is enclosed herewith for your perusal (refer page no. 51 of
the Paper Book).

1.5. However, the Appellant would like to inform your
Honors that copy of the said approval was never provided
to the Appellant. Further, when during the course of
hearings before DRP when the AR requested Hon'ble DRP
Members that copy of the approval should be provided to
the Appellant, DRP members mentioned that the said
approval is the records of the AO and they cannot share
the same with the Appellant. If required, the Appellant
should obtain this document from the AO.

1.6. In view of the same, the AR of the Appellant again
filed a letter dated 15 December 2015 requesting the AO
to provide certain documents including copy of the
approval obtained under section 151(2) of the Act.

1.7. However, the AR was not provided with copy of this
approval before 22 December 2015. It was only on 22
December 2015, the AR got the copy of the sanction /
approval taken from the AO.

1.8. Your Honors may kindly note that the said approval
has been given by the Additional Director of Income-tax
(International Taxation), Range -1, New Delhi (‘the Addl
DIT') on the last page of the recorded reasons, (refer page
no. 31 of the Paper Book}

1.9. In this regard, the Appellant refers to the
provisions of Section 151(2) of the Act, which reads as
under -

"151. .

(1)...

(2) In a case other than a case falling under sub-
section (I), no notice shall be issued under section 148
by an Assessing Officer, who is below the rank of Joint
Commissioner, unless the Joint Commissioner is
Satisfied, on the reasons recorded by such Assessing
Officer, that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice.

(3) ...."" (‘Emphasis added)

1.10. Therefore, on perusal of Section 151(2) of the Act, it
is evident that no notice shall be issued by an Assessing
Officer who is below the rank of Joint Commissioner of
Income-tax ("JCIT"), unless the JCIT is satisfied on the
reasons recorded by such Assessing Officer that it is a fit
case for the issue of notice.

1.11. Hence, Section 151(2) of the Act gives
administration powers only to JCIT for sanction / approval
for issuance of the notice under Section 148 of the Act. .

1.12. In this regard, the Appellant also refers to the
definition of JCIT given in Section 2(28C) of the Act, which
reads as under:

"(28C) "Joint Commissioner" means a_ person
appointed to be a Joint Commissioner of Income-tax
or an Additional Commissioner of Income-tax under
sub-section (1) of section 117"

1.13. Based on perusal of the definition of JCIT, it is
evident that it does not include the Additional Director of
Income-Tax. In fact, Additional Director of Income-Tax has
been separately defined under Section 2(1D) of the Act,
which reads as under:

"(ID) "Additional Director " means a_ person
appointed to be an Additional Director of Income-tax
under sub-section (1) of Section 117"

AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 54

1.14. Therefore, approval / sanction given by the Addl.
DIT in the instant case is not in accordance with the
provisions of Section 151(2) of the Act.

1.15. The Appellant further submits that it is a settled
position of law that for the purpose of Section 151(2), only
approval / sanction of JCIT would be valid and even in a
case if CIT or any other higher authority grants an
approval then also the same would be invalid.

1.16. Further, the Appellant also submits that the format
of notice to be issued under Section 148 of the Act has
been prescribed by ITNS - 34. (It shall be noted that the
said form, being non-statutory form, is not available in
public. However, after basic google search, the Appellant
was able to get the prescribed form). The Appellant
submits that the form ITNS - 34 clearly mentions that the
fact that the notice has to be issued after obtaining
necessary satisfaction from the designated authority shall
be mentioned in the notice issued under Section 148 of the
Act. (refer page no. 1 and 2 of the Legal Paper Book)

1.17. Further, in order to further substantiate its
contention, the Appellant would also like to bring to the
notice of Your Honours that on 29 March 2014, similar
notice under Section 148 of the Act was issued to the
group company of the Appellant i.e. CPLC by the same AO
wherein the AO clearly mentioned that the said notice was
issued after obtaining the approval under Section 151 of
the Act (refer page no, 52 of the Paper Book}.

1.18. In light of the said inconsistency between the two
notices issued by the same AO and lapse of mentioning of
the same in the notice, as prescribed in ITNS - 34 in the
case of the Appellant, makes it very clear that the AO, in
substance, has failed to obtain the sanction from the
designated authority under Section 151 of the Act before
issuance of the notice under Section 148 of the Act.

1.19 In this regard, the Appellant relies on the following
judicial precedents, wherein it has been held that absence
of approval / sanction from JCIT for issue of notice under
Section 148, as contemplated under Section 151(2) of the
Act, renders reassessment invalid and therefore should be
quashed:

taxmann.com 336 (Delhi) Hon'ble Jurisdictional High
Court held as under -
"8. The Revenue's argument seems plausible and
even logical because the Commissioner or a Chief
Commissioner is unarguably ranked higher in
authority than a Joint Commissioner. Yet at the same
time, this Court has to give effect to plain words of
the statute which unambiguously states that the
competent authority in such cases is the Joint
Commissioner (and not the Chief Commissioner or
the Principal Commissioner). The Revenue's
submissions that all such cases, are covered under
proviso to Section 147(1), the competent authority
for prior approval would he four superior officers,
renders Section 151(2) superfluous. If anything the
Court is clear that it is not its job to render, in the
process of interpretation, an entire provision
academic or inoperative. This court is of the opinion
that accepting the Revenue's position would result in
that consequence. The Court also invokes the
principle enunciated by the Privy Council in Nazir
Ahmad v. Emperor AIR 1936 PC 253 : that if the
statute mandates that something be done in a
particular manner, should be in that manner or not
at all. In this case, since the original assessment was
completed "other than" the eventualities
contemplated in Section 151(1), i.e. it was processed
under Section 143(1). Thus, clearly Section 151(2)
applied. » .

"7. Section 116 of the Act also defines the Income
Tax Authorities as different and distinct Authorities.
Such different and distinct authorities have to
exercise their powers in accordance with law as per
the powers given to them in specified circumstances.
If powers conferred on a particular authority are
arrogated by other authority without mandate of law,
it will create chaos in the administration of law and

hierarchy of administration will mean nothing.
Satisfaction of one authority cannot be substituted
by the satisfaction of the other authority. It is trite
that when a statute requires, a thing to be done ina
certain manner, it shall be done in that manner alone
and the Court would not expect its being done in
some other manner... "(Emphasis added)

. Ghanshyam K. Khabrani vs. ACIT [2012] 20
taxmann.com 716 (Bom.)

In the said case, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court held as
under -

"6. ... Section 151(2) mandates that the satisfaction
has to be of the Joint Commissioner. That expression
has a distinct meaning by virtue of the definition in
Section 2(28C). The Commissioner of Income Tax is
not a Joint Commissioner within the meaning of
Section 2(28C). In the present case, the Additional
Commissioner of Income Tax forwarded the proposal
submitted by the Assessing Officer to the
Commissioner of Income Tax. The approval which
has been granted is not by the Additional
Commissioner of Income Tax hut by _ the
Commissioner of Income Tax. There is no statutory
provision here under which a power to be exercised
by an officer can be exercised by a superior officer.
When the statute mandates the satisfaction of a
particular functionary for the exercise of a power, the
satisfaction must be of that authority. Where a
statute requires something to be done in a particular
manner, it has to be done in that manner. In a
similar situation the Delhi High Court in CIT v. SPL'S
Siddhartha Ltd. [2012} 17 taxmann.com 138 held
that powers which are conferred upon a particular
authority have to be exercised by that authority and
the satisfaction which the statute mandates of a
distinct authority cannot be substituted by the
Satisfaction of another. We are in respectful
agreement with the judgment of the Delhi High
Court. "(Emphasis added)

1.20. Apart from the above, it is to be noted that the AO
vide its letter dated 3 December 2015, has informed
Hon'ble DRP that administrative approval of the Addl. CIT
for issuance of notice under Section 148 has been taken on
21 January 2014 (refer page no. 50 to 51 of the Paper
Book). Based on the perusal of the copy of the approval
obtained by the Appellant, it is evident that the said
approval was in fact given by Addl. DIT (refer page no. 31
of the Paper Book).

1.21. The Appellant would like draw the attention of Your
Honours that there is an inconsistency in the submission of
the AO before the DRP to the fact that the approval under
Section 151 of the Act has actually been given by Addl.
DIT and not Addl. CIT. This shows that even the AO was
aware of the fact that approval provided by the Addl. DIT
is not a valid approval for the purposes of section 151(2)
of the Act and hence he mentioned Addl. CIT in the
responses submitted before the DRP.

1.22. In the light of above facts and the binding decision of
the Hon'ble Jurisdictional High Court and other judicial
precedents relied upon, the Appellant prays before Your
Honours that the approval taken by the AO from the Addl.
DIT has not satisfied the statutory requirement of Section

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |58

151(2) of the Act, and, therefore, the reassessment made
by the AO under Section 147 of the Act, without assuming
proper jurisdiction to issue notice under Section 148 of the
Act, should be quashed for want of statutory approval of
the designated authority specified under Section 151(2) of
the Act.

2. Without prejudice, notice issued under Section
143(2) of the Act before disposal of the Objections

2.1 Without prejudice to the above submission in point
no. 24 to 77, the Appellant would like to place reliance on
the decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
GKN Driveshafts (India) Ltd. v. ITO |2002] 125 taxman
963 which has laid down the procedure in case of
reassessment proceedings. The relevant portion is
reproduced as under:

"We see no justifiable reason to interfere with the order
under challenge. However, we clarify that when a notice
under section 148 of the Income Tax Act is issued, the
proper course of action for the noticee is to file return and
if he so desires, to seek reasons for issuing notices. The
Assessing Officer is bound to furnish reasons within a
reasonable time. On receipt of reasons, the noticee is
entitled to file objections to issuance of notice and the
Assessing Officer is bound to dispose of the same by
passing a speaking order. In the instant case, as the
reasons have been disclosed in these proceedings, the
Assessing Officer has to dispose of the objections, if filed,
by passing a speaking order, before proceeding with the
assessment in respect of the abovesaid five assessment
years," (Emphasis added)

2.2 Based on the above, it is evident that notice under
Section 143(2) of the Act for proceeding with the
assessment can be issued by the AO only after disposal of
objections raised by the Appellant.

2.3 In the instant case, since the notice under Section
143(2) of the Act had been issued before disposal of
objections raised by the Assessee, the said notice is bad in
law and liable to be quashed. Considering this, the
Appellant further submits that once the notice issued

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

[59

under Section 143(2) of the Act is invalid, the
reassessment framed consequent thereto cannot sustain in
the eyes of law and liable to be quashed.

2.4 In this regard, the Appellant wishes to rely on the
decision of the Bombay High Court in the case of M/s
Premier Limited v. DCIT & Another (Writ Petition No. 2340
of 2008 - dated 22 December 2008). In this writ petition,
the Appellant has, inter alia, challenged the validity of
notices issued under Section 142(1) and 143(2) of the Act,
which had been issued by the Assessing Officer without
disposing off the objections raised by the Appellant. In this
case, the Hon'ble Bombay High Court, considering the
decision of the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of GKN
Driveshafts (discussed supra), has quashed the said
notices issued under Section 142(1) and 143(2) of the Act.

3. Recorded reasons provided by the Assessing Officer
(‘AO') were not signed

Relevant facts under consideration

3.1 On 25 July 2014, a copy of the reasons recorded for
reopening of the assessment were provided by the AO to
the Appellant (refer page no. 22 to 30 of the Paper Book).

3.2 Your Honor's may note that the said reasons were
not signed by the AO. (refer to Page 30 of the Paper
Book}.

Submissions of the Appellant:

3.3 In this regard, it is to be noticed that the reason
recorded for reopening forms a crucial base for
reassessment proceedings as prescribed under Section
148(2) of the Act. Hence, it is of paramount importance
that the copy of reasons recorded being provided to the
Appellant shall be legally enforceable. Thus, unsigned
reasons provided to the Appellant being not legally
enforceable, the reassessment framed in consequent
thereto shall be bad in law and liable to be quashed.

3.4 In this regard, the Appellant would like to bring
following provisions of the Act and judicial precedents to
the notice of your Honors:

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |60

a. Section 282A - Authentication of notices and other
documents

282A. (I) Where this Act requires a notice or other
document to be issued by any income-tax authority, such
notice or other document shall be signed in manuscript by
that authority,

(2) Every notice or other document to be issued, served or
given for the purposes of this Act by any income-tax
authority, shall be deemed to be authenticated if the name
and office of a designated income-tax authority is printed,
stamped or otherwise written thereon.

(3) For the purposes of this section, a designated income-
tax authority shall mean any income-tax authority
authorised by the Board to issue, serve or give such notice
or other document after authentication in the manner as
provided in sub-section (2)." (Emphasis added)

3.5 Thus it is amply clear that any document issued by
any Income-tax authority shall bear a signature of the
designated authority. Further, Section 282A(2) of the Act
provides for deemed authentication if the name and office
of a designated Income-tax authority is printed, stamped
or written there upon.

3.6 However, in the instant case, the reasons for
reopening provided by the AO neither bears the signature
of the AO nor is the name and office of the AO is printed,
stamped or written thereupon (refer to Page 30 of the
Paper Book).

3.7. Thus, in light of provisions of Section 282A, the
reasons for reopening provided by the AO are not correctly
provided and does not contain any statutory force.

b. In this regard, the Appellant would like place
reliance on decision of Hon'ble Mumbai Tribunal in case of
Mahendra C. Gala v. ACIT (ITA No. 6590/Mum/2013)
wherein it was held that supplying of unsigned reasons
renders the notice issued under Section 148 of the Act
without jurisdictional foundation under Section 147 of the

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 61

Act and hence the subsequent proceedings were also
without jurisdiction.

c. Further, reliance is placed on the following judicial
precedents in order to highlight the importance given by
the judiciary in relation to signature on documents /
notices issued by the income-tax authority and whereby
such statutory lapses were considered fatal to render the
entire reassessment proceedings to be bad in law. Though
these precedents are rendered in the context of issuance
of unsigned notice under Section 148, however the ratio /
observations of these decisions would certainly be
applicable in the instant case, where unsigned reasons
have been provided to the Appellant.

4. Information regarding share transfer of CIHL was
available with AO of CIL during regular assessment
proceeding of CIL

4.1 Without prejudice to the above submission
given in point no. 24 to 73, the Appellant would like to
submit that reassessment proceedings initiated by the AO
are contrary to the principles laid down by the Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of CIT v Kelvinator of India Ltd
[2010] 320 ITR 561 (SC). As mentioned above, in the case
under consideration the information was received by the
AO of the Appellant from the AO of CIL. However, the AO
of the CIL was always aware about the transfer of shares
of CIHL from the Appellant to CIL. The same is also
observed by the AO in the Transfer Pricing order of CIL for
AY 2007-08 (refer page no. 57 to 59 of the Paper Book).
In view of the above, the AO of CIL was always aware
about the transfer of shares of CIHL by the Appellant and
he could have passed on this information to the AO of the
Appellant during the assessment proceedings of CIL.
However, the AO of CIL has not passed on any such
information to the AO of the Appellant during the regular
assessment proceedings under section 143(2) of the Act.

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |62

4.2 The said principle is also supported by the case
of CIT v Kelvinator of India Ltd [2010] 320 ITR 561 (SC)
wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court confirmed the view of the
Delhi High Court that "We also cannot accept submission
of Mr. Jolly to the effect that only because in the
assessment order, detailed reasons have not been
recorded on analysis of the materials on the record by
itself may justify the Assessing Officer to initiate a
proceeding under section 147. The said submission is
fallacious. An order of assessment can be passed either in
terms of sub-section (!) of section 143 or sub-section (3)
of section 143. When a regular order of assessment is
passed in terms of the said subsection (3) of section 143,
a presumption can be raised that such an order has been
passed on application of mind. It is well-known that a
presumption can also be raised to the effect that in terms
of clause (e) of section 114 of I he Indian Evidence Act the
judicial and official acts have been regularly performed If it
be held that an order which has been passed purportedly
without application of mind would itself confer jurisdiction
upon the Assessing Officer to reopen the proceeding
without anything further, the same would amount to giving
premium to an authority exercising quasi-judicial function
to take benefit of its own wrong"

5. Reasons for reopening were contrary to the law laid
down by Supreme Court' decision

5.1 Without prejudice to the above submission in point
no. 24 to 75, the Appellant submits that if Section 9(1 )(i)
of the Act is to be interpreted without referring to
Explanation 5, then the law in relation to Section 9(1)of
the Act has been laid down by the decision of Hon'ble
Supreme Court in the case of Vodafone International v
Union of India [2012] 341 ITR 1 (SC). Indeed, until the
Revenue first began to pursue Vodafone in 2007 for tax
related to transfers of offshore shares by an offshore
company, Revenue had never sought to assess or collect
any such tax - and the 2012 decision of the Supreme Court
in Vodafone International made it abundantly clear that
the Income Tax Act 1961 did not provide the basis for any
such taxation. That is why the retrospective amendment
came to be passed shortly afterwards in 2012 - to create

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page | 63

the fiction that the basis for such tax existed prior to 2012.
The Shome Committee and other distinguished committees
constituted by the Government have made this point very
clearly as well.

5.2 In the reasons for reopening of assessment, which
were provided after being sought by the Appellant, the AO
has not referred to the Explanation 5 to Section 9(1 )(i) of
the Act. Without application of Explanation 5 to Section 9(1
)(i) initial reasoning of the AO was contrary to the decision
of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Vodafone
International (supra) and hence bad in law.

6. Reopening of the assessment in the instant case is
based on the survey report conducted on the premises of
C1L and in all likelihood, the said survey report had been
received by the A O after the issuance of the notice under
Section 148 of the Act,

6.1 Without prejudice to the above submission given in
point no. 24 to 90, the Appellant submits as under: .

On 15 January 2014, a survey was conducted under
Section 133A of the Act by Directorate of Investigation.
New Delhi at the premises of CIL.

6.2 As per the facts mentioned by the AO in the DAO,
the investigation wing has forwarded a report of this
survey along with certain documents to the Dy. Director of
Income-tax, Circle 1(1), International Taxation, New Delhi.
Relevant extract of the draft assessment order is as under:

"A survey u/s 133A of the Income Tax Act, 2961
(hereinafter "the Act") was conducted at the office
premises of Cairn India Ltd at 3rd and 4th Floor, Viper
Plaza, Sun City, Sector-54, Gurgaon-122002, Haryana by
the Directorate of Investigation, New Delhi on 15.01.2014.
The report of the survey action -was received from
Investigation wing which inter-alia contained following
documents "

6.3 It is further submitted that the Hon'bie DRP in its
order, on page no. 2, has also observed as under:

"DRP has carefully considered the objections, and
examined the draft assessment order as well as the

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page | 64

contents of the Report of the Survey u/s 133A carried out
by the Investigation Wing on 15.1.2014 and referenced by
the Assessing Officer..... "

6.4 Further, the AO himself in his letter dated 3
December 2015 has observed that the case was reopened
under Section 148 on the basis of the survey proceedings
under Section 133 A conducted on the office premises of
CIL on 15 January 2014.

6.5 Based on the above, the Appellant submits that it is
beyond doubt that the reassessment in the instant case
had been initiated, based on the report of the survey
conducted on the premises of CIL on 15 January 2014.
However, the Appellant also notes that no new documents
were uncovered by the survey proceedings on 15 January
2014 - all of the documents in question had previously
been provided to the FIPB (on which Revenue was
represented) and other branches of the government during
the course of 2006 in connection with the Cairn 2006
reorganisation transactions and the establishment of CIL.

6.6 Given the above background, the Appellant
would also like to bring to the notice of your Honors that
on 29 March 2014, a similar notice under Section 148 of
the Act was issued to the group company of the Appellant
i.e. CPLC by the same AO. Further, the same. AO had
also provided reasons for reopening of the said case vide
its letter dated 25 July 2014 (refer page no. 53 to 56 of
Paper Book}.

6.7 Based on the perusal of the said recorded reasons
for reopening of the assessment of CPLC, the Appellant
observe that the AO has mentioned about the date of
receipt of the - report of the survey conducted on the
premises of the CIL. Relevant extract is reproduced as
under:

"A survey operation u/s 133A of the Income Tax Act was
carried out on 15.01.2014 at the office premises of M/s
Cairn India Ltd at 3rd & 4th floor, Vipul Plaza, Suncity,
Sector-54, Gurgaon-122002, Haryana. A survey
report received from office of DDIT(inv.) Unil-IV(2)

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

| 65

vide letter F.No.DDIT(Inv.)/Unit-Iv(2)/2Q13-14/453
dated' 25.02.2014" (Emphasis added)

6.8 Further, in the said reasons, at various places
reference was given of the February 2014. This goes to
prove that the survey report was received by the AO in the
month of February 2014 only.

6.9 In view of the above, the Appellant submits that
since the survey report had been received by the AO only
in the Month of February 2014 i.e. after issue of notice
under Section 148, the reassessment had been initiated
without any basis and information and as such the same is
liable to be quashed. Furthermore, as noted above, no new
documents were discovered by the survey proceedings in
January 2014 - all of the documents in question had been
in the hands of the government in 2006. The reason that
no tax was levied in 2006 was that the transactions in
question were not taxable in 2006 - the only arguable
basis for taxing them (which Appellant in any event
rejects) arose in 2012 with the passage of the
retrospective amendment. This has been confirmed by
distinguished governmental commissions.

7. Rebuttal to the observations of the AO and DRP on
assuming mere territorial jurisdiction

In the final assessment order and DRP direction, the AO
and DRP has observed that AO has valid jurisdiction over
foreign companies on account of certain provisions of the
Act and based on the returns of income filed by the
Appellant for the subsequent years. However, such an
observation of the AO only purports to confirm the
territorial jurisdiction of the AO over foreign companies
under the Act. The Appellant has been challenging-and is
challenging - the validity of assumption of jurisdiction for
initiating reassessment proceedings without satisfying the
various condition precedent for the valid assumption of
jurisdiction as enunciated by the Supreme Court in several
decisions,

8. Rebuttal to judicial precedents relied upon by the
DRP

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |66

8.1 The DRP relied on the decisions of CIT v Mehak
Finvest P Ltd [2014] 52 Taxmann.com 51 (P&H) and
Majinder Singh Kang v CIT [2012] 344 ITR 358 / 25
taxmann.com 124 (P&H) contending that in view of
Explanation 3 to Section 147 of the Act. the AO shall be
empowered to make additions even to the extent of
grounds on which reassessment notice might not have
been issued during reassessment proceedings.

8.2 In this regard, the Appellant wishes to submit that
the issue in relation to Explanation 3 to Section 147 of the
Act was neither contended by the Appellant during the
assessment proceedings nor during the DRP proceedings.
The reliance placed by the DRP on these decisions, which
deal with Explanation 3 to Section 147 of the Act, is totally
irrelevant and baseless.

P. Prayer

In view of the above submission, the Appellant prays that
the proceedings under Section 147 / 148 of the Act are
invalid and hence the assessment framed consequent
thereto, is bad in law, void ab initio and liable to be
quashed.”

Ld. authorized representative further referred to page No. 7 of the
paper book, which is a notice under section 148 of the income tax act,
1961 dated 21/01/2014 issued to the assessee by the Ld. assessing
officer. He further referred to page No. 52 of the paper book wherein
assessee has placed another notice issued under section 148 of the
Income Tax Act dated 29/03/2014 to Cairn energy plc wherein it is
mentioned that that notices issued after obtaining the approval under
section 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. Therefore, he stated that the

notice issued under section 148 to the assessee appellant on 21%.

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

Page |67

January 2014 does not have any reference that notice is issued after
obtaining the approval under section 151 of the Income Tax Act as
stated in notice at page No. 52. He therefore submits that in the notice
under section 148 issued to the assessee there is no reference of any
sanction taken under section 151 of the Income Tax Act, hence, it is
invalid. He further reiterated that according to the provisions of
section 151 (2) of the Act the notice under section 148 of the act
shall be issued by the assessing officer on the satisfaction of the Joint
Commissioner on the reasons recorded by the assessing officer that it
is a fit case for issue of such notice. He referred to page No. 22-31 of
the paper book which are the reasons recorded for the issue of notice
under section 148 of the Income Tax Act and at page No. 31 the
satisfaction of Additional Director of Income Tax (International
Taxation), Range 1, New Delhi has been obtained. He therefore
submitted that there is no power available with the Additional Director
of income tax (international taxation) to record satisfaction that it is a
fit case for the issue of such notice. He further referred to the
provisions of section 2 (28C) and 2 (28D) of the Income Tax Act
wherein the definition of ‘Joint Commissioner’ and ‘joint director’ is
provided. Therefore he vehemently submitted that the power to give

sanction under section 151 (2) is only available with the Joint

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

Page |68

Commissioner and not with Additional Director. He further submitted
that these 2 authorities are quite different. He further referred to the
decision of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in case of CIT versus Pawan
Kumar Garg [2009] 178 Taxman 491 (Delhi)/ [2011] 334 ITR 240
(Delhi)/ [2009] 222 CTR 36 (Delhi) wherein it has been held that
manner in which expression ‘Joint Director’ has been used in section
132(1) requires same to be interpreted in its limited sense as meaning
only a Joint Director and not an Additional Director of Income- tax.

On the issue of reopening of assessment proceedings the Id
departmental representative vehemently contested the submission

of the assessee and also submitted on each of the issue as under :-

1) Regarding claim that approval does not meet the
requirements laid down u/s 151(2)

« The assessee applied for PAN on 8.11.2006. Based on the
information provided by the assessee it was assigned to the
jurisdiction of Circle 1(2)(1), Delhi, which came under the
jurisdiction of Addl DIT(IT), Range 1, Delhi.

. Vide notifications no. 263/2001 of 14.09.2001 and
250/2007 dated 28.09.2007 read with order of DIT (IT)-I
Delhi dated 11.10.2007 (copies enclosed), the Add DIT (IT),
Range 1, Delhi was empowered to exercise the powers and
the functions of Additional Commissioner of Income-tax.

. Therefore, the grant of approval for issue of notice
u/s 148 by Addl DIT (IT), Range-1, Delhi was as per law.

2) Regarding matter on Notice u/s 143(2) issued before
disposal of the objections

e Notice u/s 148 was issued on 22.01.2014 after obtaining
prior approval of the Addl. DIT(IT), Range-1, Delhi, in

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 69

response to which the assessee filed a NIL return on
03.04,2014. After filing of return, and till 07.05.2014 when
the first notice u/s 142(1) was sent, the assessee did not
make any request seeking reasons for issue of notice u/s 148

. Assessee still did not seek and reasons for re
opening till 06.06.2014 when another notice u/s 143(2} was
issued. It was only on 10.06.2014 that the assessee for the
first time sought reasons for issue of notice u/s 148. These
reasons were supplied to the assessee on 25.07.2014

. After obtaining reasons in July 2014, the assessee
filed a response on 16" October 2014. Even then, other than
raising general contentions, no specific objection was
conveyed with regard to the reasons recorded for issue of
notice u/s 148. This aspect has been highlighted by the AO in
his order dated 19.02.2015 disposing of the 'objections' (para
5 - 6 thereof, pages 43 - 44 of assessee's paper book).
Nevertheless, the AO diligently dealt with whatever objections
were raised by the assessee and finally disposed them off on
19" February 2015.

. The proposition canvassed by the AR that notices u/s
143(2)/142(1) cannot be issued till the disposal of objections
made by the assessee in response to the communication of
‘reasons to believe' -is an erroneous interpretation of the SC
judgment in 'GKN Driveshafts' case. After issue of notice u/s
148 the AO cannot be expected to remain idle waiting for the
assessee to seek reasons and then prefer objections at the
last minute. It is also worth noting that the time available
with the AO for passing draft assessment order was only up
to 31.03.2015. Under the circumstances, and keeping in view
that the assessee had not sought reasons for almost six
months even after receiving the notice u/s 148 on 21.03.2014
the action on part of the AO to issue notices u/s 143(2) and
142(1) before 10.06.2014 cannot be faulted upon.

. So far as the case of Premier Ltd v DCIT& Ors (WP
No. 2340 of 2008) of Bombay HC is concerned, the facts of
that case are completely at variance with the case in hand. In
that case, the AO had issued notices u/s 148,143(2) and
142(1) altogether. It was in these circumstances that the
High Court quashed notices issued u/s 143(2)/142(1) and

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 70

directed the AO to proceed with the matter afresh. The cited
case-law does not apply here.

3) Regarding claim of assesses that Reasons Recorded by
the AO were not signed

. This contention has never been raised before at any
stage. Not only that the assessee through letter dated
16.10.2014 responded to the reasons conveyed, but
continued to participate in the proceedings even after that
without raising any disagreement about the same, till now.

. Nevertheless, the fact that the AO not only recorded
reasons (and, of course, signed those) for reopening of
assessment, but also obtained approval of the competent
authority for issue of notice u/s 148 is undeniable.

. Moreover, the AO conveyed the 'reasons' for issue of
notice u/s 148 to the assessee on 25.07.2014 through a duly
signed covering letter of the same date. The office copy of the
signed letter along with the sticker of 'Speed Post' bar-code is
available in the assessment records (P-201/c). It is worth
noting that another similar letter addressed to Cairn Energy
PLC (a group company) was also sent on the same date to
the same address receipt of which is not denied. Proof of
dispatch of these letters is also available with the office (copy
enclosed).

. As desired by the Hon'ble Bench, the assessment
records in original were produced for kind perusal of Hon'ble
Members. The Bench also allowed the AR to inspect the
assessment file and verify that the AO had indeed sent the
reasons for reopening through a covering letter under his
signature.

4) Regarding claim that the Information on share transfer
was available with AO of CIL

. Even though information was available with the AO
of CIL, it reached the AO of the assessee much later. In any
case, the law does allow action against an erring assessee
(i.e. reopening of assessment in cases where income has
escaped assessment) within certain time frame. In this case
the action was taken within the prescribed time frame i.e.
within 6 years of income having escaped assessment.

. It is not clear as to how the ratio of the case CIT v.
Kelvinator of India [2010] 320 ITR 561 (SC) is being sought
to be applied here. That was a case where an order u/s
143(3) was passed and later the assessment was sought to
be reopened on the ground that the AO had passed the earlier
order without application of mind. The position is completely
different here. Even though the assessment of CIL was made
with full application of mind, income in the case of the
assessee had escaped assessment because, among other
aspects, the assessee had failed to file any return whatsoever
till the notice u/s 148 was sent.

5) Regarding claim that Reopening is contrary
to'Vodafone'Judgment e

. Post Vodafone judgment, to remove doubts the
Parliament clarified the law as it stood since 1962. Whether
the Parliament of the Country was competent to do so, it is
most humbly submitted, cannot be deliberated in this Hon'ble
Tribunal.

. At the time of issue of notice, the law was thus clear
and the AO had clearly stated (order disposing of objections;
Page 36 - 47 of assessee's paper book) that the conditions
laid down in section 9(1)(i) were satisfied and the capital gains
accruing to the assessee from transfer of CIHL shares which
derived all their value from the assets situated in India, was
taxable in India.

6) Regarding issue on Survey Report

. The insinuation, that while the notice u/s 148 was
issued on 21.01.2014, the 'Survey Report', based on which it
was purportedly issued, was received by the AO in the month
of February 2014, is completely unsupported by the facts on
record. As per the assessment records, a report marked
"URGENT MATTERS' was received from DDIT(Inv)-U-IV(2),
New Delhi on 16.01.2014. Based on the information provided
in that report, the AO recorded his reasons and obtained
approval of Addl.DIT(IT)-Range-l, Delhi on 21.01.2014 for
issue of notice u/s 148

. In any case, and more importantly, that the
assessee did not file the tax return voluntarily is a fact. In

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 72

such a scenario, whether the survey brought out any new
facts for the purposes of reopening is not material. That there
was income chargeable to tax in India and the assessee had
not even filed the tax return was sufficient reason to believe
that the income had escaped assessment. The survey only
confirmed the aspect of income accruing or arising in India
through the transfer of assets situate in India. Whether
survey report was received by the AO before or after issue of
notice u/s 148 does not come in the way of the legality of
such notice.

7) Issue regarding Territorial Jurisdiction “

. The assessee had obtained a Permanent Account
Number (PAN) on 08.11.2006, whereupon it was assigned to
the jurisdiction of International Taxation, Circle 1(2)(1) and
the assessment order in appeal presently was passed in the
same jurisdiction. Moreover, the assessee has been regularly
filing returns for AY 2010-11 onwards’ with’ the
Assistant/Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax (International
Taxation) Circle 1(2}(1}, New Delhi without raising any issue
on the jurisdiction. /-

. The notice u/s 148 was issued to the assessee on
21.01.2014 which was received on the same date by hand to
the AR, Mr. Sachin Bansal as well as by e-mail. In response,
on 20.02.2014 a request for adjournment of 8 weeks was
made. It was only vide letter dated 02.04.2014, that a
challenge was made regarding "assumption of jurisdiction" by
contending that "the Income Tax Department does not have
the jurisdiction to issue a SI 48 notice on CUHL". Essentially
the challenge to jurisdiction related to the arguments that
"the retrospective amendment was not valid" and that "no
capital gains accrued or were deemed to accrue or arise in
India". The jurisdiction of Assistant/Deputy Commissioner of
Income Tax (International Taxation) Circle 1(2)(1), New Delhi
over the assessee was never under challenge.

. In any case, the challenge to the jurisdiction was
made 72 days after the service of notice u/s 148, much after
the 30 days bar placed in that regard u/s 124 of the Income
Tax Act. Any challenge to the jurisdiction of the assessing
officer at this stage deserves to be rejected.

The Ld. departmental representative for the purpose of the jurisdiction
referred to the notification No. 250/2007 dated 28/09/2007 and
submitted that the Directors of Income tax referred to in this
notification to issue orders in writing empowered the Additional
Drectors of the income tax of Joint Directors of income tax, what
subordinate to them to exercise the powers to perform the function of
Additional Commissioner of income tax or Joint Commissioner of
income tax in respect of such territorial areas for of such person or
class of person of such income or class of income or of such class of
classes of the cases specified in the corresponding entries in that
notification. He therefore submitted that Additional Directors of the
income tax are equivalent to the Joint Commissioners of the income
tax therefore there is no infirmity in the sanction provided under
section 151 (2) of the Income Tax Act. He further referred to the
notification dated 11/10/2007 issued by the office of the director of
income tax, international taxation and notification dated 14/09/2001.

In rejoinder, Ld. authorized representative submitted that the
notification submitted by the Ld. departmental representative does not
specify that the powers of Joint Commissioner with respect to the
provisions of section 151 (2) are also with the Additional

Commissioner or the Additional Director of the Income Tax Act. He

therefore further relied upon his written submission made in this
behalf.
We have carefully considered the rival contentions. The assessee
appellant has challenged validity of reopening of assessment t on
several counts before us, including the two additional grounds raised
and we deal with each of them as under:-
a. The 1% challenge made by the Ld. authorized representative is
that the approval required under section 151 (2) of the Income
Tax Act has not been correctly provided. It is not in dispute
that the approval has been granted by the Additional Director of
income tax (international taxation), range - 1, New Delhi on
21/01/2014 as depicted at page No. 31 of the paper book.
According to the provisions of section 151 (2) it is provided that
in a case other than the case falling under subsection (1), no
notice shall be issued under section 148 by the assessing officer,
who is below the rank of Joint Commissioner, unless the Joint
Commissioner is satisfied, on the reasons recorded by such
assessing officer, that it is a fit case for the issue of such notice.
Now it is a moot question before us that whether the approval
accorded by The Additional Director of Income Tax

(International Taxation) is in compliance with the provisions of

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |75

section 151 (2) of the Income Tax Act or not. According to the
provisions of section 2 (28C) Joint Commissioner means a
person appointed to be a Joint Commissioner of income tax and
Additional Commissioner of income tax under subsection (1) of
section 117. Further, section 2 (28D ) of the act defines joint
director means a person appointed to be joined director of
income tax and _ Additional Director of income tax under
subsection (1) of section 117. Therefore, from the conjoint
reading of the above provisions it is amply clear that the word
Joint Commissioner does not include the Additional Director of
income tax. However, provisions of section 120 of the Income
Tax Act define the jurisdiction of income tax authorities.
According to that section all income tax authorities shall exercise
all or any of the powers and perform all or any of the functions
conferred on them or assigned to them by or under this act in
accordance with such direction as the board may issue for the
exercise of the powers and performance of the function by all or
any of those authorities. It further provides that the direction of
the board may authorise any other income tax authority to issue
orders in writing for the exercise of the powers and performance

of the function by all or any of the other income tax authorities

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |76

what subordinate to it. According to those powers notification

No. 250/2007 dated 28/09/2007 was issued by the Central

board of direct taxes wherein it is provided as under:-

"(b) the Directors of Income-tax referred to in this notification to

issue orders in writing empowering the Additional Directors of
income-tax or Joint Directors of Income-tax, who are
subordinate to them to exercise the powers and perform the
functions of Additional Commissioners of Income-tax or Joint
Commissioner of Income-tax, in respect of such territorial areas
or of such persons or classes of persons or of such incomes or
classes of income or of such cases or classes of cases specified

in the corresponding entries in column (4) of the Schedule;"

Therefore, the Central board of direct taxes has validly exercises

power conferred upon it as provisions of section 120 of the

Income Tax Act wherein they have also provided that that the

functions performed by Additional Commissioner of income tax

or Joint Commissioner of income tax may also be performed by

the Additional Director of income tax or joint directors of the

income tax. Further, the Ld. departmental representative

contested that the assessee has applied for permanent account

number on 08/11/2006 which was provided by the revenue,

which is assigned to the jurisdiction of circle 1 (2) (1), Delhi,

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |77

which came under the jurisdiction of Additional Director of
income tax (international taxation), range - 1, Delhi. Therefore,
necessarily the grant of approval for issue of notice under
section 148 of the Income Tax Act was also required to be given
by the Additional Director of income tax (International Taxation),
New Delhi. The appellant also could not say that the notifications
relied upon by the revenue are not in accordance with the law.
The decisions relied upon by the Ld. authorized representative
are not applicable to the facts of the present case as in this
particular case there is a notification issued by the Central board
of direct taxes conferring jurisdiction of the Joint
Commissioner/Additional Commissioner of income tax on the
joint director/ Additional Director of income tax. In view of this
we reject the contention of the Ld. authorized representative
that the approval does not meet the requirements laid down

under section 151 (2) of the Income Tax Act, 1961.

. The 2" contention raised by the Ld. Authorized representative is
that form number ITNS - 34 provides for the format of notice
under section 148 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. The above

notified form show that there is a specific mention is to be made

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |78

that the notice is being issued after obtaining the necessary
satisfaction of the deputy Commissioner, Commissioner, Chief
Commissioner of income tax. The Ld. authorized representative
also took us to page No. 52 of the paper book where the notice
under section 148 issued with respect to some other assessee of
Cairn Group was annexed, wherein there is a specific mention
that this notice is issued after obtaining the approval under
section 151 of the Income Tax Act, 1961. He referred to the
notice issued to the assessee, which is placed at page No. 7 of
the paper book, where’ there is no such mention of such
approval. Therefore, the contention of the Ld. authorized
representative that this non-mentioning of the fact of obtaining
necessary approval in the notice itself makes the notice invalid.
We have carefully perused the rival contentions. In fact, format
of the notice provided in ITNS - 34, is a non-statutory form,
which does not find place in the income tax rules, or any other
subsidiary rules relating to administration of the Income Tax Act.
However, we fully agree with the contention of the Ld.
authorized representative that the non-statutory format provided
by the Central Board of Direct Taxes clearly provides that there

has to be mention about the notice is being issued after

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |79

obtaining the necessary satisfaction of the higher authorities
prescribed therein. It is also apparent that the notice issued to
the assessee on 21%. January 2014 under section 148 of the
Income Tax Act does not contain any such statement with
respect to obtaining approval under section 151 of the Income
Tax Act. Undisputedly, in this case proper approval of Ld.
Additional Director of income tax (international taxation) has
been taken by the Ld. assessing officer under section 151 of the
Income Tax Act. Merely if the notice issued does not mention
some facts that are prescribed in a non-statutory form when
substantially the procedure laid down by the Income Tax Act has
been complied with cannot make the notice invalid. In view of
this we also rejected the contention of the Ld. authorized
representative of the assessee that the notice is not in the
prescribed format, it should be held to be invalid.

. The 3 contention of the assessee is that the notice under
section 143 (2) of the Income Tax Act has been issued before
the disposal of the objections filed against reopening of
assessment. The facts relating to this is that the objections filed
by the assessee against the issue of reopening were disposed off

by the Ld. assessing officer on 19/02/2015, whereas the notice

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |80

under section 143 (2) of the income tax was issued to assessee
on 06/06/2014. To support its case the assessee has relied upon
the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of GKN
Drive shaft (India) Ltd versus ITO [2002], 125 Taxmann
963,(SC) which has_ laid down certain procedure in case of
reassessment proceedings. The Ld. authorized representative
stressed that direction of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in that
decision in holding that the assessing officer is to dispose of the
objections, if filed, by passing the speaking order, before
proceedings with the assessment, were not complied with. The
Ld. authorized representative further relied on the decision of
the Hon’ble Bombay high court in case of M/s Premier Ltd versus
DCIT to support its contentions. The Ld. departmental
representative submitted that assessee has not sought any
reasons for reopening till 6" of June 2014 but the assessee has
sought reasons only on 10/06/2014. Therefore, there cannot be
any occasion for the Ld. assessing officer to dispose of the
objection filed by the assessee as there are no objections filed
before him before the issue of notice under section 143 (2) of
the Income Tax Act. We have carefully considered the rival

contentions. The Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of GKN

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |81

Driveshaft (India) Ltd versus Ito (2002) 125 Taxmann 963 (SC)
has laid down the procedure in case of reassessment
proceedings holding that , when notice under section 148 of the
income tax is issued, the proper course of action for the noticee
is to file return of Income and if he so desires, to seek reasons
for issuing notices. The assessing officer is bound to furnish
reasons within a reasonable time. On receipt of the reason that
noticee is entitled to file objection to issuance of notice and the
assessing officer is bound to dispose of the same by passing the
speaking order before proceedings with assessment. In the
present case, the notice under section 143 (2) was issued on 6"
June 2014, whereas the assessee has obtained reasons for
notice issued under section 148 of the act only on 10/06/2014,
therefore, apparently there is no objections pending before the
Ld. assessing officer to dispose before the issue of notice under
section 143 (2) of the act. Furthermore, there is specific time
limit applicable with respect to the issue of notice under section
143 (2) of the Income Tax Act, as per proviso contained therein.
It is the prerogative of the assessee to obtain benefit of the
guidelines laid down by Hon’ble Supreme Court in case of

reopened assessment. However, when the assessee does not

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |82

care to safeguard its own interest, it cannot hide behind his
inefficiency and claim that there is a flaw in assessment
proceedings. In the present case, the notice under section 148
was issued on 21/01/2014 where the Ld. assessing officer
granted time of 30 days from the date of service of the notice to
file a return. In response to that notice, assessee filed return
only on 03/04/2014, beyond the time limits provided by the Ld.
assessing officer. The assessee sought the reasons only on
10/06/2014, which were supplied on 25" July 2014 and
assessee filed its objection only on 16/10/2014. Therefore, we
do not agree with the contention of the Ld. authorized
representative that in this case there is any violation of the
guidelines laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court with respect
to disposal of the objection and then commencing the
assessment proceedings. Therefore the contention of the
assessee is rejected.

. The fourth contention of the assessee was that information
regarding share’ transfer of Cairn India Holdings Ltd was
available with the Ld. assessing officer of gain India Ltd during
the regular assessment proceedings of Cairn India Ltd., The

argument of the assessee is that reassessment proceedings

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page | 83

initiated by the Ld. assessing officer are contrary to the
principles laid down by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
CIT versus Kelvinator of India Ltd (2010) 320 ITR 561 (SC) for
the reason that information was received by the Ld. assessing
officer of the appellant from the Ld. assessing officer of Cairn
India Ltd, however, the Ld. assessing officer of Cairn India Ltd
was always aware about the facts of transfer of shares of Cairn
India holding Ltd from the appellant to Cairn India Limited. For
this it is argued that in the assessment proceedings of Cairn
India Ltd for assessment year 2007 -08. The Ld. assessing
officer of that company referred the matter for the determination
of arms length price of the transfer of the shares to appellant
and this information could have been passed on to the Ld.
assessing officer of the appellant. However, as the assessing
officer of Cairn India Ltd, has not passed on such information to
the Ld. assessing officer of the appellant during the regular
assessment proceedings under section 143 (3)of the act. Against
this, the Ld. departmental representative have argued that that
though the information was available with the Ld. assessing
officer of Cairn India Ltd, it reached the AO of the assessee

much later. In any case it was submitted that law does allow

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi

AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page | 84

action against any assessee within certain time frame in this
case the action was taken within the prescribed time frame. The
Ld. departmental representative also vehemently submitted that
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the present case, do
not apply at all. It was submitted that though the assessment of
Cairn India Ltd was made with full application of mind income in
the case of the assessee had escaped assessment because the
assessee has failed to file any return whatsoever till the notice
under section 148 of the Income Tax Act was issued. We have
carefully considered the rival contentions and we reject the
argument of the Ld. authorized representative of the assessee as
well as the reliance upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in case of CIT versus Kelvinator of India Ltd (supra). The
reasons for the same is that it cannot be argued that if
assessment in the case of some another assessee has been
made who was also a party to the contract, reassessment
proceedings in the hands of the other party cannot be initiated.
Here, the argument of the assessee is that that the information
could have been passed on to the Ld. assessing officer of the
appellant from the assessing officer of the Cairn India Ltd, and

such information has not been passed by the Ld. assessing

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |85

officer of the Cairn India Ltd to the Ld. assessing officer of the
appellant and therefore the reopening is invalid. Such an
argument is required to be rejected at the threshold only
because the assessment proceeding of one person is quite
different from the assessment proceedings of another person
and the provisions of the Income Tax Act should be applied fully
with respect to the records and information relevant to that
assessee only.

. The 5" contention raised by the Ld. authorized representative is
that that the reasons for reopening were contrary to the law laid
down by Supreme Court in case of Vodafone International versus
union of India (2012) 341 ITR 1 (SC). The main thrust of the
argument of the appellant is that in the reasons for reopening of
the assessment, the Ld. assessing officer has not referred to the
explanation 5 to section 9 (1) (i ) of the Income Tax Act.
According to assessee without application of explanation 5 to
section 9 (1) (i) reasoning of the assessing officer was contrary
to the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of
Vodafone, international (supra)and hence bad in law. The Ld.
departmental representative submitted that the post Vodafone

judgment and to remove doubts, the Parliament has clarified the

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page | 86

law as it stood since 1962. He further vehemently submitted that
it cannot be deliberated in this tribunal whether the Parliament
of the country was competent to do so or not. It was further
argued that at the time of issue of notice the law was very clear
that the conditions laid down in section 9 (1) (i) were satisfied
and the capital gains accruing to the assessee for transfer of
Cairn India holding Ltd shares which derived all the value of the
shares from the underlying assets situated in India, was taxable
in India. We have carefully considered the rival contentions and
also perused the reasons recorded by the assessing officer for
initiating reassessment proceedings. The Ld. assessing officer
has referred section 9(1) (i) of the act and at page No. 7 of the
reasons recorded. He has elaborately considered that provisions
of that section are applicable in the present case. Further at
page No. 8 it is also been mentioned that that S underlying
assets of such shares are situated India which is transferred and
capital gain thereon is chargeable to tax in India. He has
categorically held that all the subsidiaries are doing business in
India are having all the receipts in India and, therefore, the
shares of Cairn India holding Ltd derived all its value from the

assets located in India. He further held that the real effect of

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |87

transfer of the shares of Cairn India holding Ltd will be the
transfer of control of the assets of the subsidiaries in India.
Therefore, this transfer of shares would indirectly result in
transfer of assets situated In India. It situated in India, hence
the condition laid down in section 9 (1) (i) of the Indian Income
Tax Act are satisfied thereby making the capital gain taxable in
India, as per the domestic tax law. The argument of the Ld.
authorized representative is correct that Id AO ha not referred
to the explanation 5 while recording the reasons however he has
referred to provisions of section 9 (1) (i) of the act and
explanation 5 is part of that section. Therefore, merely because
no reference is made to explanation 5, reasons recorded by the
Ld. assessing officer cannot become invalid when he has referred
the overall section. Therefore this contention of the Ld.

authorized representative is rejected.

. The sixth contention of the assessee is that the recorded reasons

provided by the Ld. assessing officer were not signed. During the
course of hearing the assessment records were called for and
reasons recorded by the Ld. assessing officer were examined.
We found them duly signed by the assessing officer. The same

documents were also shown to the Ld. authorized

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

Page | 88

representative,Where he could not say that the reasons recorded
by the Ld. assessing officer are not signed. In view of this we
reject this contention of the assessee.

. The seventh contention of the assessee is that the reopening of
the assessment in the instant case is based on the survey report
conducted on the premises of the Cairn India Ltd and in all
likelihood the said survey report had been received by the Ld.
assessing officer after the issuance of the notice under section
148 of the Income Tax Act. The reasons for such contention of
the Ld. authorized representative is that survey was carried out
on 15/01/2014 and while recording the reasons for reopening of
the assessment in one of the group company cases, the Ld.
assessing officer of that company has stated that survey report
was received on 25 February 2014. Therefore it is the
allegation of the assessee that at the time of recording of the
reasons Id AO did not have any information of survey report. To
counter this argument, the Ld. departmental representative
submitted that as per assessment records report remarked as
‘urgent matters’ was received from DDIT (investigation), New
Delhi on 16/01/2014 and on that basis, the AO has recorded his

reasons on 21/01/2014 for issue of notice under section 148 of

the act. In view of the examination of records by bench and also
an opportunity of examination given to the Ld. authorized
representative at the time of hearing this argument does not
have any legs to stand, hence, rejected.

h. On the additional ground No. 2.3 raised before us with respect
to incorrect approval under section 151 (2) of the income tax
has already been dealt with by us in earlier paragraphs of this
order therefore ground No. 2.3 is rejected.

i. On the additional ground raised by ground No. 2.4 regarding the
invalidity of notice issued under section 143 (2) of the act, only
argument raised before us _ is that before disposal of objections
filed by the assessee such notice was issued. We have already
dealt with this issue and hence this additional ground is also
rejected.

In the result ground no 2 of the appeal of assessee is dismissed .

Ground No 3 & 4 of the appeal of the assessee are against
chargeability of capital gain and computation of the same under the
Income Tax Act 1961.

Ld AR submitted on this issue as under :-

to achieve more effective local management, to access Indian
capital market, and to allow equity participation by Indian and
Foreign investors in their Indian business.

Step-wise implementation of the reorganisation has been
detailed hereunder:

Step 1 - Share Exchange Agreement dated 30 June 2006
between CPLC and Cairn UK Holdings Limited ('CUHL' or
'Appellant') (refer Page No. 60 to 66 of Paper Book]

As part of the internal reorganisation, the Appellant was
incorporated on 26 June 2006. Thereafter, a Share Exchange
Agreement dated 30 June 2006 was entered into between
CPLC and CUHL, a company incorporated in United Kingdom,
whereby the entire issued share capital of nine (9) wholly
owned subsidiaries of CPLC ("the Subsidiaries'") were
exchanged with the CUHL.

In consideration for the aforesaid exchange, the CUHL issued
22,14,44,034 shares of GBP 1 each to CPLC. Consequently,
CUHL became a wholly owned subsidiary of CPLC and the
holding company of the Subsidiaries.

Step 2 - Share Exchange Agreement dated 07 August 2006
between CUHL and Cairn India Holdings Limited ('CIHL') (refer
Page No. 67 to 73 of Paper Book)

Post completion of Step 1, CIHL was incorporated in Jersey

on 2 August 2006. Thereafter, a Share Exchange Agreement
dated 07 August 2016 was entered into between the CUHL and
CIHL whereby the CUHL exchanged all the shares of the
Subsidiaries with CIHL.
As a consideration for the aforesaid exchange of shares, CIHL
issued 22,14,44,034 shares of GBP 1 each at par to CUHL.
Consequently, CIHL became the wholly owned subsidiary of
CUHL and the new holding company of the Subsidiaries.

Vide Debt Conversion Agreement dated 1 September 2006,
the debt of GBP 2,97,80,710 owed by Cairn Energy
Hydrocarbons Limited to CPLC was assigned by CPLC to CUHL
for a consideration of 2,97,80,710 ordinary shares of CBP 1
each issued by CUHL to CPLC, which debt was further assigned

by CUHL to CIHL for a consideration of 29,780,710 ordinary
shares of GBP 1 each issued by CIHL to the Appellant.
Accordingly, the total shares under consideration were
25,12,24,744 ordinary shares of GBP 1 each (22,14,44,034
shares plus 2,97,80,710 shares)

Step 3 - Subscription and Share Purchase Agreement between
CPLC, CUHL, CIHL and Cairn India Limited ('CIL') (refer Page
No. 75 to 168 of Paper Book)

As a final part of internal reorganisation, CIL was
incorporated in India on 21 August 2006 as a wholly owned
subsidiary of CUHL. In accordance with Indian regulatory
provisions, equity was injected into CIL by CUHL. Vide
subscription and share purchase agreement dated 15 Sep
2006 and share purchase deed dated 12 Oct 2006 entered into
by and among CPLQ CUHL, CIHL and CIL, the entire share
capital of CIHL was transferred from CUHL to CIL; The
consideration for this transfer was settled partly in cash and
partly as shares in CIL. For this purpose, initially funds were
infused in CIL on various dates by CUHL and from these funds,
on the same day, CIL purchased some part of the share capital
of CIHL from CUHL.

1.4. As a result, CIL, a subsidiary of CUHL, acquired 100
percent stake in CIHL from the Appellant.
1.5. With regard to the above transaction. Assessing

Officer ('AO'), in the Draft Assessment Order ('DRO') dated 09
March 2015, alleged the gains arising from the sale of shares
of CIHL by the CUHL to CIL are short term capital gains and
hence chargeable to tax in India at the rate of 40 percent.

1.6. Against the above DRO, CUHL filed objections before
the Hon'ble Dispute Resolution Panel ('DRP') vide application
dated 6 April 2015.

1.7. After series of hearings and filing of various
submissions, Hon'ble DRP issued its directions vide order
dated 31 December 2015. In the said directions, Hon'ble DRP
agreed with almost all the allegations of the AO and confirmed
the DRO. Pursuant to the directions of Hon'ble DRP, AO issued
Final Assessment Order ('FAO') dated 25 January 2016.

1.8. Against the above FAO, the Appellant has filed
captioned appeal before the Hon'ble Income-tax Appellate
Tribunal (‘ITAT'), Delhi and now the Appellant is placing all the
arguments before your Honors.

2. AO and DRP contentions and Appellants submission against
the said contentions

2.1. The AO and DRP have both raised various contentions
with regard to taxability of transfer of shares of CIHL to CIL.
Further, on the same issues, learned DRP has also provided its
contentions and observations at various places in the
directions issued. In this regard, detailed reasons of AO and
DRP along with the rebuttal of the Appellant are provided in
the subsequent paragraphs.

#-e

Retrospective Amendment to section 9(I)(i) of the Act by
Finance Act, 2012 is bad in law and ultra vires

1.1. At the outset the Appellant most respectfully submits
that the captioned proceedings were initiated on account of
retrospective amendment to section 9(1 )(i) by the Finance
Act, 2012 which has resulted in imposing substantial tax
liability on the Appellant. With the due respect to the
legislature, the Appellant submits that the said retrospective
amendment is bad in law and ultra vires provisions of Article
14 of the Constitution of India. Further, in the "Draft report on
Retrospective Amendment - Relating to Indirect Transfers"
issued in 2012 by the Expert Committee appointed by the
Government of India, under the Chairmanship of Dr.
Parthasarathi Shome also recommended that the said
amendment should be applied with prospective effect. In view
of the same, your Honors will appreciate that retrospective
applicability of the said law is not considered as good law.

2.3. The Appellant is already contesting validity of the said
retrospective amendment before the International Court of
Justice pursuant to Article 9 of the Agreement between the
Government of India and Government of United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the Promotion and
Protection of Investments. Further, the Appellant also reserves
its right to contest the validity of the above retrospective
amendment before the appropriate forum in India. However,
in the DRO and FAO and DRP Directions, it was observed by
the AO and DRP, that the retrospective amendment is a good
law. In view of the same, presuming that your Honors would
be dealing with the said observations of the AO and DRP, in
the subsequent paragraphs, the Appellant has provided its
submissions against the observations of the AO and DRP on
retrospective amendment.

2 -. During the course of the assessment, the learned AO has
placed reliance on the submissions filed by CIL during the
course of proceedings under section 201 of the Act, wherein it
was submitted that the amendment of section 9(1 )(i) of the
Act created new law and new obligations. It was submitted
that the legislature though while amending the law has
mentioned that the amendments are being made for removal
of doubts, however, in view of the settled law in the favorable
Supreme Court? judgment, this attempt is nothing but to
create substantive rights to tax a class of persons and
accordingly can only be prospective in nature (refer Para 9.4 -
Page 270 of Appeal Documents).

en. 4

2.5. Further, the learned AO has upheld the validity of
retrospective amendment by placing reliance oti the following
(refer Para 9.5 to 9.6 from Page 271 to 280 of Appeal
Document):

4

a. Memorandum to Finance Act, 2012 and interpretation on
the first principles which provides that the insertion of
Explanation 4 and 5 to section 9(1) will be applicable with
retrospective effect from 01 April 1962;

b. Reliance is placed on the decision of DTT v Copal Research
Ltd., Mauritius [2014] 49 taxmann.com 125 (Delhi)

c. Reliance is placed on the decision of CIT v Vatika
Township (P) Ltd., Civil Appeal No. 8750 of 2014.

2.6. Further, learned DRP has agreed with the above
conclusion of the AO and further relied on the followingjudicial
precedents:

a. National Agri Coop Mkg Federation v UOI [2003] 260 ITR
548 (SC); b. ACIT v Netley ‘B' Estate [2015] 56
taxmann.com 436 (SC);

c. Sony Ericson Mobile Communications India P Ltd v CIT

[2015] 55 taxmann.com 240 (Delhi HC);

d. CIT v Sati Oil Udyog Ltd [2015] 56 taxmann.com 285
(SC); and e. ShivDuttRai Fateh Chand v UOI [1983] 1984
AIR 1195 (SC).

2.7. With due respect to all the above contentions of the
learned AO and DRP, the Appellant most respectfully submits
rebuttal to all the above judicial precedents in the subsequent
paragraphs.

2.8. Reliance is placed by the learned AO on the amended
provisions of section 9(1 )(i) read with Explanation 4 and 5
inserted by Finance Act, 2012 is not at all a debatable issue.
At this point of time it is very clear that the Act is amended
retrospectively to bring transactions of indirect transfers of
overseas companies having Indian assets within the tax net of
Indian Income-tax Act. The issue which was to be debated is
whether the case of the Appellant is a case of indirect transfer
or it is a case of corporate reorganisation of holding
companies, with no transfer of assets to any outsider and no
true gain is realized. Another issue, if at all has to be
discussed before your Honors and

winch needs evaluation is whether amendment to section 9( 1
)(i) of the Act with retrospective effect which has an impact of
increasing tax liability on the Appellant is a good law.

Further, reliance placed on the decision of Copal Research
(supra) is completely irrelevant and out of the context.
Learned AO has very conveniently cherry picked certain
paragraphs from the decisions and quoted as per his
convenience. The main issue before Hon'ble Delhi High Court
was whether the transfer of 67 percent shares of Copal-Jersey
to Moody UK is chargeable to tax in India. The said transfer of
shares was having an effect of transfer of certain assets in
India. The main issue dealt by the Hon'ble Delhi High Court in
this case was interpretation of the word "substantially"
occurring in Explanation 5 to section 9(1 )(i) of the Act. In the
said interpretation. Hon'ble Delhi High Court just took note of
the provisions of Explanation 5. Such an observation’ of
Hon'ble Delhi High Court is presented by the AO in such a
manner that Hon'ble Delhi High Court has stated that
Explanation 5 is for removal of any doubts and hence
applicable with retrospective effect. The Appellant submits that
the observations of the Hon'ble Delhi High Court are not at all
approving the retrospective application of Explanation 5.

2.10. Without prejudice to the submission in Para 2.9
above, the Appellant would also like to submit that even if for
the time being one agrees with the observation of the learned
AO that Hon'ble Delhi High Court has approved the
retrospective application of Explanation 5 to Section 9(I)(i) of
the Act, the said observations should not have any binding
force of law. The Appellant would like to point out that the
main issue before the Hon'ble Delhi High Court was the

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 95

interpretation of the word "substantially" appearing in
Explanation 5. For the purpose of this interpretation, there
was no requirement of making any comment on the
retrospective applicability of Explanation 5. In view of the
same, the said observations are obiter dictu™ and does not
have the binding force of law.

2.11. Further, the decision of Vatika Township (supra) is also
applied totally out of the context. The main issue involved in
this case was whether proviso to section 113 of the Act, which
is introduced with effect from 1 June 2002 should be applied
retrospectively to the assessment years 1995 onwards or not?
In this case, the amendment is introduced from a specific date
and the issue was whether the said amendment should be
applied with retrospective effect or not. Whereas in the case
under consideration, amendment is already introduced with
retrospective effect from 1 April 1962. Hence, debate on the
issue whether said amendment should be applied with
retrospective effect or not? was not an issue before Delhi High
Court.

2.12. Further, the learned AO has very conveniently cherry
picked certain paragraphs which are favorable to the Revenue
and very conveniently ignored all the paras which are in favor
of the Appellant and ratio of the judgment. Hon'ble Apex Court
decided this case in favour of the Assessee and observed as
follows:

? Obiter Dicta is an observation by a court on a legal question
suggested in a case before it but not arising in such a manner
as to require a decision. Such an obiter may not have a
binding precedent as the observation was unnecessary for the
decision pronounced. Obiter Dicta is more or less presumably
unnecessary to the decision. It may be an expression of a view
point or sentiments which has no binding effect. It is also well-
settled that the statements which are not part of the ratio
decidendi constitute obiter dicta and are not authoritative. The
same is various judicial precedents such as KEC International
Ltd. v. Ad. CIT [2012] 20 taxmann.com 229 (Mumbai), CIT v
SAE Head Office Monthly Paid Employees Welfare Trust [2004]
141 Taxman 364 (Delhi), Saurabh Bansal v ITO [2010] 41
SOT 157 (AHD.), Roshanlal S. Jain (AOP) v. Dy. CIT [2009]
309 ITR 1741 (Guj.), Arvind Boards & Papers Products Ltd. v.
CIT [1982] 137 ITR 6352 (Guj.), etc.

The charge in respect of the surcharge, having been created
for the first time by the insertion of the proviso to Section 113,
in clearly a substantive provision and hence is to be construed
prospective in operation. The amendment neither purports to
be merely clarificatory nor is there any material to suggest
that it was intended by Parliament. Furthermore, an
amendment made to a taxing statute can be said to be
intended to remove ‘hardships' only of the assessee, not of the
Department. On the contrary, imposing a retrospective levy on
the assessee would have caused undue hardship and for that
reason Parliament specifically chose to make the proviso
effective from 1.6.2002."

In view of the above, the decision of Vatika Township (supra)
is supporting the case of thii Appellant and not the case of the
revenue.

 

 

°.i

2.13. Tn the case of National Agri Coop Mkg Federation
(supra), the main issue before the Hon'bHJ

Supreme Court ('SC') was validity of the retrospective
amendment introduced in sectior) 80P(2)(a)(iii) of the Act.
While dealing with the entire issue, learned DRP has very
conveniently picked up one statement which was favorable to
the Revenue. The Appellant would like to bring following
observation of Hon'ble Apex Court to the notice of your
Honors:

. "the retrospectivity must he reasonable and not excessive
or harsh, otherwise it runs the risk ofbelns struck down as
unconstitutional"

. "In real terms therefore there was hardly any
retrospectivity, but a continuation of the status quo ante. The
desree_and_extent_of the unforeseen _and_ unforeseeable
financial _burden_was,_in the circumstances, minimal_and
cannot he said to be unreasonable or unconstitutional. "

The above observation of the Hon'ble SC clearly indicates that
the amendment dealt in this case was neither having any
wider implications on the assessee nor was too harsh or
unreasonable. In the case of the Appellant, retrospective
amendment has levied a total demand amounting to INR
29,102 Crores. Consequently, given the degree and extent of
the unforeseen and unforeseeable financial burden, the
amendment cannot have retrospective effect.

2.14. In the case of Netley 'B' Estate (supra), the issue
involved was of retrospective operation of amendment made
to section 26(4) read with section 27 of Karnataka Agricultural
Income Tax Act, by the State Legislature held that assessment
of agricultural income could not be made in the hands of
assessee-firm after its dissolution in so far as said amount
pertained to period prior to dissolution of firm. On this issue,
Hon'ble Supreme Court decided the case against the Assessee
and upheld the retrospective application of the above section.
However, it is very much relevant to bring following
observations of Hon'ble Supreme Court before your Honors:

e No right or liability is created for the first time - the only
thing done in the present case is that a firm is by fiction of law
continued as such for certain purposes of assessment even
after its dissolution.

. There is no withdrawal of any right which has become a
vested statutory right which deprives an assessee of anything
in the present case.

The above observation clearly indicates that the only issue
involved was the taxability of income in the hands of the firm
after dissolution. The said amendment was not creating any
additional tax

liability in the hands of the Assessee or any other person. In
view of the same, ratio of this decision cannot be applied in
the case of the Appellant because a tax liability was imposed
for the first time.

2.15. The decision in the case of Sony Ericsson (supra),
relied on by the Hon'bleDRP Members, revolves around the
issue of marketing intangibles. The major portion of the ruling
dealt with the method to benchmark the transaction of excess
Advertisement, Marketing or Promotion ('‘AMP') expenditure
incurred by the assessee for its foreign counterpart. The
concept of adopting Bright Line Test ('BLT') as a legitimate
means of determining the arm's length price of the
international transaction has been discussed at length.
However while dealing with this issue in greater detail, the
Hon'ble Court also made an observation on the issue of
retrospective amendment of section 92CA introduced by the
Finance Act, 2012. The learned DRP, abruptly quoted those
findings without considering that the main issue raised by
assessee.

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |98

2.16. In the said ruling, the assessee itself considered the
excess AMP expenditure as an international transaction and
accordingly this question was not dealt in by the Hon'ble Delhi
High Court and remained unanswered. This indicates that the
decision of Sony Ericson (supra) cannot be considered as an
authority for interpretation of retrospective amendment.
Further, various subsequent rulings, discussed in subsequent
Paragraphs, by the Hon'ble High Court, have also not
considered the decision of Sony Ericson (supra) to determine
the basic question of whether the excess AMP expenditure
incurred would constitute as an international transaction.

2.17. In the case of Maruti Suzuki India Limited v
CIT[2015] 64 taxmann.com 150 (Delhi), Hon'ble Delhi High
Court held that "The result of the above discussion is that in
the considered view of the Court the Revenue has failed to
demonstrate the existence of an international transaction only
on account of the quantum of AMP expenditure by MSIL
Secondly, the Court is of the view that the decision in Sony
Ericsson Mobile Communications India (P.) Ltd. case (supra)
holding that there is an international transaction as a result of
the AMP expenses cannot be held to have answered the issue
as far as the present Assessee MSIL is concerned since finding
in Sony Ericsson to the above effect is in the context of those
Assessees whose cases have been disposed of by that
judgment and who did not dispute the existence of an
international transaction regarding AMP expenses [Para 51]”
2.18. In the case of Honda Siel Power Products Ltd. V DCIT
[2015] 64 taxmann.com 328 (Delhi),

Hon'ble Delhi High Court observed that "This court is of the
view that the above decision in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd,
(supra) holding that the decision in Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications India (P.) Ltd. (supra) wouldnot cover the
case of MSIL would also apply as far as the present Appellant
is concerned As noticed in Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (supra) the
facts of (he cases of the Assessees in Sony Ericsson Mobile
Communications India (P.) Ltd. (supra) did not give rise to a
dispute that there is no international transaction involving the
Assessee therein and its AEs. In fact each of the Assessees
were receiving subsidies/subventions from their respective
AEs." [Para 22]

2.19. From above, it can be concluded that the findings of
Sony Ericson were not considered in the subsequent ruling

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 99

pronounced by the Hon'ble Court for determining the basic
question of whether the said transaction of excess AMP
expenditure would constitute as an international transaction.
Accordingly, the said ruling'should not be applied on the facts
of the Appellant.

2.20. Decision of Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of Sati
Oil Udyog (supra) deals with the retrospective application of
section 143(1A) of the Act. The main issue was that section
143(1A) provides for an additional tax of 20 percent where the
amount of adjustment made under the first

proviso to clause (a) of sub-section (1) exceed the total
income. In this case, reduction of loss was not specifically
covered in the provisions of section 143(1 A). In the case of
the Assessee, where on account of adjustments there was
reduction of the losses, it was alleged that since reduction of
loss is not covered by the express provisions of the section
143(1 A) additional tax of 20 percent should not be applied in
the case of the Assessee. Thereafter, by Finance Act, 1993
provisions of section 143(1 A) of the Act were retrospectively
amended to include even the reduction of loss.

2.21. To the above, Hon'ble Supreme Court concluded that
the provisions of section 143(1 A) of the Act are for punishing
the assessee. Ultimately, taking a clue from Varghese? case,
Hon'ble SC concluded that section 143(1 A) of the Act can only
be invoked where it is found on facts that th£ lesser amount
stated in the return filed by the Assessee is a result of an
attempt to evade tax lawfully payable by the assessee. ;;

2.22. From the above, your Honors will appreciate that the
decision of Hon'ble SC was driven by the nature of the
amendment was for the purpose of punishing the willful
defaulters. The principles of the said decision cannot be used
to approve the retrospective application of amendment to
section 9(I)(i) of the Act which has an impact of the increasing
substantial tax liability of the Appellant. Especially in the case
of the Appellant, where this transaction was suo moto
disclosed before various Income-tax and regulatory bodies as
evident from various documents submitted before various
authorities*.

2.23. In the case of Shiv Dutt Rai (supra), the issue which
was dealt by Hon'ble SC was validity of retrospective penalty
provisions introduced by way of section 9(2A) of the Central
Sales Tax. In this case, the main issue was retrospective

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 100

applicability of section 9(2A) introduced in Central Sales
levying penalty for non payment of taxes collected.

-18'-" -

2.24, In the above, your Honors may kindly note that the
said judgment was dealing with the penalty provisions of
Central Sales tax where the mechanism and levy of penalty is
driven entirely by different parameters. Hence, this case law
cannot be used as binding precedent in the case of the
Appellant. - .. - -
Internal Reorganisation
2.25. During the course of the assessment proceedings, AO
relied on certain submissions filed by CIL during the course of
proceedings under section 201 of the Act. In the said
submissions one of the contentions raised by CIL was that the
above transaction was nothing but a case of internal
reorganisation without any involvement of the third party and
accordingly, the same should not come within the taxability of
the provisions of the Act. Reliance was also placed on the
decision of Vodafone? and it was argued that in the case of CIL
there is no change in the controlling interest as a result of
internal reorganisation (refer Para 8.15 to 8.18 - Page 240 to
241 of the Appeal Documents}.

2.26. To the above, AO has observed that the share
purchase deed provided for cash consideration for 24.31
percent shareholding in CIHL from the Appellant to CIL. To
finance this acquisition, CIL brought an IPO in the Indian
capital market and the proceeds of the IPO was paid to the
Appellant for acquiring shares of CIHL. In this way, Appellant
divested its stake in the Indian oil and gas business to CIL and
received adequate cash consideration for the same. Therefore
the claim of the Appellant that these transactions were part of
the internal reorganisation of the group and are revenue
neutral is not correct, (refer Para 9.1.7.2-Page 253 of the
Appeal Documents)

2.27. Further, learned DRP has also agreed with the above
observations of the AO (refer observations of the DRP at Page
No. 137to 140 of the Appeal Documents]

2.28. In this regard, we would like to bring to the notice the
flow of transactions as described in Page No. 294 and 295 of
the Paper Book. As already explained above, vide subscription
and share purchase agreement dated 15 September 2006 and
share purchase deed dated 12 October 2006, the Appellant

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 101

has infused funds into CIL and the same funds are used by CIL
to purchase shares of CIHL. The same is very evident from the
dates of funds infused by the Appellant in CIL and on the same
day CIL has purchased shares of CIHL and remitted back the
same funds to the Appellant.

2.29, Attention of your Honors is also invited to the table
provided at Page 295 of the Paper Book.

wherein in all the transactions of purchase of shares till 20 Dec
2006 are mentioned. Your Honors will appreciate that funds
are injected by CUHL on 12 October 2006 and 22 November
2006. On the very same day CIL purchased shares of CIHL
and used the funds injected to pay the Appellant for these
shares. Further, on 20 December 2006, 53.84 percent shares
were transferred to CIL by way of the share swap arrangement
i.e. in exchange for the transfer of shares in CIHL to CIL,
consideration was not received by the Appellant in cash, what
was received by the Appellant was again shares of CIL. Which
means that the assets which, the Appellant was holding,
namely shares of CIHL, got exchanged for the shares in CIL.
Thus no new funds were received or gains are generated by
the Appellant till the 3" tranche of purchase of shares by CIL.
2.30. The reason for the internal reorganisation was
operational i.e. to bring entire Indian business operations of
Cairn group under one Indian Company. This was followed by
listing the shares of CIL on various stock exchanges in India. If
one looks at the above arrangement this is nothing but an
internal reorganisation of Indian operations following which an
Indian company is listed on stock exchange and further capital
was received from qualified institutional investors and general
public in India as a result of a fresh issue of shares by CIL. It
is only in respect of this 41"! Tranche where consideration was
paid by CIL out of the funds received from the private
placement and public issue of new shares as part of IPO of the
CIL.

2.31. Under the above scheme your Honors will appreciate
that this is purely an internal reorganisation of the Indian
operations of the Cairn group. There can be no tax which can
be levied on the internal reorganisation where there is no
increase in the wealth of the Appellant.

2.32. In the DAO, after considering gist of the RBI Approval
dated 10 October 2016, the AO observed that the Appellant
presented the facts before the Foreign Investment Promotion

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 102

Board ('FIPB') in such a way that the Appellant is making an
investment in an Indian Company. In the view of the AO, the
cash component of the transferred shareholding for the 4"
Tranche was not disclosed in the FIPB application, neither was
any approval taken for the same. After considering the
approval issued by Reserve Bank of India ('RBI'), the AO has
further observed that only the share swap transaction was
approved by the FIPB and RBI, which followed that the first
two tranches of the

proposed transactions. According to the AO, there was no
mention of the approval of the 4" tranche in the application by
the Appellant (refer Para 9.1.10 - Page 255 and 256 of Appeal
Documents}.

2.33. Further, learned DRP has also agreed with the above
observation of the AO and further observed that "// is our
considered view that the assessee company >s statement to
FIPB were inaccurate / misleading by inter alia suppressing its
intention to remit the IPO and pre-IPO proceeds of the equity
floatation of Cairn India Limited" (refer Last Para - Page 128
of Appeal Documents).

2.34. The Appellant most respectfully submits that the
above issue of seeking an approval from RBI for share swap
arrangement does not have any bearing on taxability of
transfer of shares of CIHL to CIL. However, since it is alleged
that the Appellant has furnished inaccurate / misleading
information, the Appellant is rebutting all above observations
of the learned AO and DRP in the subsequent paragraphs.
2.35. At the outset, the Appellant would like to inform your
Honors about the purpose of filing of the Application before
FIPB. As per the Foreign Direct Investment regulations, no
approval is required for the investments which are covered
under the automatic route. Approval is required only for the
investments which are not covered by the automatic route but
covered by the approval route. In the case of the Appellant, in
2006, foreign investment in oil and natural gas exploration
was included in the so-called "automatic route" for approval,
which meant that FIPB approval under the Foreign Exchange
Management Act was not required for such investment. Hence,
there was no requirement of filing any pre-approval
application before FIPB for purchase of shares by Indian
Company in cash. Approval was required only for the share
swap arrangement. In view of the same, there was no

regulator)' requirement for filing any application before FIPB
for any investment which is made by way of cash.

2.36. Irrespective of the above submission on legal
requirement, the Appellant most respectfully submits that the
above observations of the AO and DRP referred to Para 2.32
and 2.33 are factually incorrect. Attention is invited to the
following paragraphs of FIPB Application wherein the Appellant
has clearly informed about the intention of the CIL to acquire
shares of CIHL in cash post completion of IPO. Relevant
paragraph is reproduced below (refer Para 2.5 - Page 203 of
Paper Book)"

"2.5 Upon completion of the above, CIL will make an Initial
Public Offer ("IPO ") in India with a view to list its shares on
the Bombay Stock Exchange and the National Stock Exchange.
. Under the IPO, CIL will offer a minimum 10 % of its post
issue capital to the public for cash. At the same time as the
IPO, CIL will issue up to 70 % of its post issue capital, to CUHL
in exchange for shares of CIHL. CUHL will subscribe for these
shares in exchange for the transfer of an additional stake of up
to 70 % in CIHL to CIL.

Since this subscription for shares of CIL by CUHL will take
place for consideration other than cash, it will require approval
of the FIPB.

. Subsequent to completion of the IPO, CIL would acquire
the balance equity shares (at leant 10%) of CIHL from CUHL,
for_a_cash consideration under the automatic route of the
Reserve Bank of India for overseas investments by Indian
companies"

 

 

 

 

2.37. From the above your Honors will appreciate that
following points were submitted before the FIPB:
a. Subsequent to completion of the IPO - The Appellant

clearly mentioned about the transactions

to occur after completion of IPO. / b. CJL would acquire the
balance equity shares fat least 10%) of CIHL from CUHL - The
Appellant clearly mentioned that CIL would acquire balance
equitv shares of CIHL from

CUHL. c. for a cash consideration - The Appellant clearly
mentioned that CIL will acquire the shares

for a cash consideration d. under the automatic route of the
Reserve Bank of India - The said shares will be acquired undet

automatic route. Since, these shares were acquired under
automatic route, there was nd

requirement of mentioning anything additional in the
application.

2.38. Further, approval was not required for acquisition of
shares in CIL for cash. Approval was sought only for shares
acquired by the Appellant in exchange of shares. This is also
evident from the following extract of the FIPB Application
(refer Para 2.7-Page 205 ofthe Paper Book}: '

"2.7.7 As per current Indian legal requirements, the inward leg
of a swap transaction, i.e., the investment in an Indian
Company by a foreign company requires approval from the
FIPB. Hence, the transaction for issue of equity shares by CJL
to_CUHL in exchange for shares of CIHL would require prior
approval from the FIPB"

2.39. From the above observations of the FIPB Application,
your Honors will appreciate that the allegations of the learned
AO and DRP are completely baseless and made without
appreciation of correct facts and regulatory requirements as all
the required facts were submitted before the FIPB for
approval. Further, the facts regarding 4'" tranche were also
mentioned in the FIPB Application.

No Real Income lias accrued to the Appellant

2.40. |The Appellant has argued before the learned DRP that
in the above transaction no real income has accrued to the
Appellant and no tax can be levied on the Appellant. In this
regard, reliance was placed on the following judicial
precedents before learned DRP and learned DRP has rejected
the same without correct appreciation of facts:

. CITv. Shoorji Vallabhdas & Co. [1962J46ITR 144 (SC)
wherein Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed that Income-tax
is a levy on real income and a mere book-keeping entry
cannot be income, unless real income has actually been
earned.

. Sanjeev Woollen Mills v. CIT [2005] 149 TAXMAN 431
(SC), the Hon'ble Supreme Court directly addressed the
inability of a company to profit, or to be taxed, on the basis of
internal accounting entries where no third party transactions
were conducted.

. CIT v Excel Industries Ltd. [2013] 38 taxmann.com 100
(SC), after setting out various decisions of the Hon'ble
Supreme Court which relied on the principles of real income,

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 105

the Hon'ble Supreme Court (while considering whether the
value of certain benefits against export obligations were
taxable) held that "Applying the three tests laid down by
various decisions of this Court, namely, whether the income
accrued to the assessee is real or hypothetical; whether there
is a corresponding liability of the other to pass on the benefits
of duty free import to the assessee even without any imports
having been made and the probability or improbability of
realisation of the benefits by the assessee considered from
realistic and practical point of view (the assessee may not
have made imports), it is quite clear that in fact no real
income but only hypothetical income had accrued to the
assessee and Section 28(iv) of the Act would be inapplicable to
the facts and circumstances of the case. Essentially the
Assessing Officer is required to be pragmatic and not
pedantic."

2.41. All the above judicial precedents are distinguished by
the learned DRP with the observation that ill the case under
consideration the Appellant has received full market
consideration for the same* which inter alia has been funded
by the pre-IPO private placement as well as the IPO funds
raised from the public during the course of the public issue by
the CIL. . j

2.42, The Appellant, most humbly submits that the above
analysis of the learned DRP is incorrect. While observing the
fact that the Appellant has eventually (post-IPO) received full
market consideration, as discussed in Para 2.29 to Para 2.32
above, DRP has lost sight of the fact that out of the total
consideration received more than 75 percent of the
consideration is received from the funds which are infused by
the Appellant or by way of share swap arrangement. From the
above, it is evidently clear that due to the corporate
reorganization itself, there was neither any increase in the
wealth of the Appellant nor any additional gain received by the
Appellant. In substance nothing has changed for the Appellant
as far as ownership of 75 percent shares is concerned.

2.43. Further, reliance is placed on the decisions of Hon'ble
Calcutta High Court in the case of Kusum Products Limited®
wherein it is observed that "The receipt shown in the profit
and loss account is an illusory receipt. The assessee has
communicated its reasons as to why it resorted to make to
such an illusory entry which includes that the Company has

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 106

sustained losses and in order to impress the bankers and to
please the shareholders the aforesaid entry was passed into
the profit and loss account. The learned Tribunal on facts was
satisfied with the explanation............ When the

learned Tribunal was satisfied that the entry did not represent
any real income or any real receipt of money, there is no
question of the same being taxable. Hon'ble High Court held
that we are as such of the opinion that the question raised by
the Revenue is to be answered in the affirmative. The appeal
is thus disposed of answering the question in favour of the
assessee."

2.44, In the case of the Appellant, though no illusory entry
is passed in the books of account, however, post internal
reorganisation in substance, no real income has accrued to the
Appellant. On account of all the steps mentioned above, all the
assets which Appellant was holding in India are now available
in different form.

Rebuttal on other observations of the learned AO and DRP
2.45. Learned AO has observed that in assessing the true
nature and character of a transaction, the label which parties
may ascribe to a transaction is not determinative of its
character. The nature of the transaction has to be
determinative of its character. The nature of the transaction
has to be ascertained from the covenants of the contract and
from the surrounding circumstances. It is relevant to note that
this observation is a verbatim reproduction of paragraph 140
of the judgment of the Hon'ble Bombay High Court in
Vodafone International Holdings B. Vv. Union of India and Anr.
(Writ Petition No. 1325 of 2010) and was not followed by the
Supreme Court.

2.46. Relying on the decision of SC in the case of National
Cement Mines Industries Ltd v CIT[1961]

42ITR 69 (SC) learned AO has observed that it is clear that
the intention of Legislature has always been to tax the income
arising out of any real commercial transaction. The use of
word "indirectly" in section 9(I)(i) makes the legislative intent
regarding inclusion of the income accruing or arising to any
person, in the income liable to be taxed in India, very clear.
2.47. With the above judgment, learned AO has explained
the intention of legislature has always been to tax the income
arising out of any real commercial transaction. The Appellant
hereby submits that the said case more than supporting the

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 107

case of the revenue is supporting the case of the Appellant. In
the case of the Appellant, as already discussed above, it is
merely corporate reorganisation of the holding structure and
no real gain has accrued to the Appellant because the internal
reorganisation did not result in a change of control. Hence,
there should not be any taxability irt the case of the Appellant.
>

2.48. Further, learned AO has distinguished the decision of
Vodafone International Holdings B. V V UOI& Another [2012]
341 ITR 1 (SC) on account of following reasons:

a. In case of Vodafone, it was payment from non-resident
to non-resident. But in present case, a resident company i.e.
CIL has made payment of INR 26,681.87 crores to the
Appellant. In the present case, money was actually remitted
out of India (as consideration) to purchase the shares;

b. In case of Vodafone, there was lot of confusion as to
whether the purchaser i.e. Vodafone International was able to
acquire controlling interest in HEL. However, in the present
case, it is quite clear that the purchaser i.e. CIL has acquired
100 percent controlling interest in CIHL and the downstream
companies which own their 100 percent assets located in
India; and s.

Cc. Vodafone transaction was a completely offshore
transaction. In the present case, an Indian Company has
made payment to a non-resident for purchase of shares of a
Company located in Jersey, which owned Indian Assets.

In view of the above, the capital gains arising to the Appellant
are deemed to accrue and arise in India and are taxable as
short term capital gains under the provisions of the Act.

2.49, The above points on which the decision of Hon'ble SC
is rebutted by the learned AO are completely irrelevant. The
basic issue before the Hon'ble SC was that whether transfer of
shares of overseas companies having any Indian assets is
subject to tax in India under the law prevailing then. All the
above points of distinction mentioned by the AO do not dilute
applicability of the decision on the principle of indirect transfer.
Also, unlike Vodafone, no indirect transfer of Indian shares
occurred pursuant to the internal reorganisation. Other than
CIL, there were no other Indian incorporated companies in the
group.

2.50. It is further submitted that the FAO reproduces the
findings of the Hon'ble High Court of Bombay in Vodafone

International Holdings B. V v. Union of India and Anr. (Writ
Petition No. 1325 of 2010) which were subsequently set aside
by the Supreme Court, including as set forth below;

However, despite such reproduction, it is categorically stated
in the FAO that "in fact the facts of the present case are
clearly different and distinguishable from the facts of Vodafone
International Holdings B.V. Vs. UOI& Another, 341 ITR P. This
indicates the self-contradictory and patently incorrect position
of the law stated in the FAO which forms the basis of the
assessment under challenge.

While computation capital gain in the hands of Appellant, cost
of acquisition stepped up to the fair value of the shares of
CIHL on the date of acquisition

Without prejudice to the above, assuming but not admitting,
that indirect transfer of shares of Company with Indian assets
is otherwise taxable in India, no capital gain has arisen in the
hands of the Appellant on transfer of shares of CIHL to CIL.
This is on account of the fact that, while computing capital
gains, cost of acquisition should be stepped up to the fair

ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 109

market value of the shares of CIHL on the date of acquisition
by the Appellant. The said argument is explained in the
subsequent paragraphs.

In the above internal reorganisation, following transactions
have taken place:

a) Vide*Sfr*sxcThange agreement dated 3(KJiine-2006
(refer Page No. 60 to 66 of the Paper Book)IC?LC exchanged
shares of nine subsidiaries with the CUHL in lieu of
22,14,44,034 shares of CtJHL at £ 1 each issued at par ('7"
transfer’);

b) Vide share exchange agreement dated 7 August 2006
(refer Page No. 67 to 73 of the Paper Book). CUHL exchanged
shares of the same nine subsidiaries with CIHL in lieu of
22,14,44,034 shares inCJ>IL-Of£ 1 each issued at par (‘2nd
transfer'},

Cl£U4ssued 2,97.80,710 shares vide debts conversion
agreement dated 1 September 2006 and hence the total
number of shares of CIHL increased to 25,12,24,744 shares
(22,14,44,034 plus 2,97,80,710 shares).

d) Vide subscription and share purchase agreement dated 15
September 2006 (refer Page No. 74 to 109 of the Paper Book)
and share purchase deed dated 12 October 2006 (refer Page
No. 110 to 168 of the Paper Book), the CUHL transferred
entire 100 percent shareholding in CIHL to CIL in 4 tranches
for a consideration amounting to INR 266,81,87,10,140 3"
transfer). The said consideration is paid by CIL partly in cash
and partly by way of issue of equity shares in CIL. It is this
transfer of shares which is subject matter of dispute and taxed
by the AO.

2.54. In the above internal reorganisation, assuming as per
the existing provisions of section 9(1 )(i) of the Act dealing
with indirect transfer of shares is a good law for the year
under consideration, all the above transfers (i.e. 15, 2™4 and
3 transfer) are taxable in India. However, 1% and 2"
transfer, is by way of exchange and 3" transfer is by way of a
sale.

2.55. At this stage, it is important to bring the difference
between the concept of'sale' and 'exchange' and its impact on
computation of capital gains. When any asset is transferred
and the amount of consideration is fixed by both the parties
i.e. seller and buyer, then it is a transfer of assets by way of
sale. Such fixed consideration for sale can be discharged either

 

 

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 110

by cash or by any other asset or both. In such a case, while
computing capita! gains in the hands of seller, full value of
consideration will be the amount of consideration fixed by both
the parties. Further, when any asset is transferred in lieu of
another asset and no specific amount for consideration is
agreed between the parties that) it is a case of transfer by
way of exchange. In such a case, while computing capital
gains, fair' market value of the asset received in consideration
for the asset transferred should be considered as full value of
consideration,

2.56. | The above principle is supported and explained by the
Hon'ble SC in the case of CITv. Gillanders P Arbuthnot & Co
/1973J 87ITR 407 (SC) and CIT v George Henderson and Co.
Ltd[1967] 66 Ih ITR 622 (SC). Ratio of these judicial
precedents is explained in the subsequent paragraphs. /

2.57. In the case of Gillanders Arbuthnot & Co (supra), the
assessee firm through its partners entered into an agreement
for sale of some of the shares and securities held by it in
favour of Gillanders Arbuthnot & Co for a sum of Rs. 75 Lacs.
The Income-tax officer was of the view that the market value
of the shares and securities sold was much more than Rs. 75
Lacs. According to him, the Company secured those shares
and securities at below market value and on that basis he
computed capital gains at a higher amount in the hands of
firm. The issue raised before the Hon'ble SC was ' e« whether
the transaction entered into is a sale or exchange or merely a
readjustment.

2.58. It was in light of this fact, that Hon'ble SC was of the
view that the transaction under consideration was of sale and
not of exchange it held that the sale price was fixed by the
parties for the shares and the securities sold is of Rs. 75 Lacs
and nothing more. It was further observed that because of the
allotment of the shares of the Company in satisfaction of the
sale price, the assessee firm got certain benefits but that does
not convert the sale into an exchange.

2.59, Hon'ble SC after considering the decision of CIT v R.R.
Ramakrishna Pillai [1967] 66 ITR 725 (SC) distinguishing an
exchange from a sale observed that "where the person
carrying on the business transfers the assets“to a company in
consideration of allotment _of shares, it would be a case of
exchange _and_not_of sale and the true nature of the
transaction will not be altered because for the purpose of

 

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

>age [111

stamp duty or other reasons the value of the assets
transferred is shown as equivalent to the face value of the
shares allotted. On the other hand, a person carrying on
business may agree with a conwany floate(] by him that the
assets belonging to him_shall be transferred to the company
for a certain money consideration and that in _satisfacrtoti_of
the liability to nay the money consideration shares of certain
face value shall be allotted to the transferor. In such a case
there are in truth two transactions, one transaction of sale and
the other a contract under which the shares are accepted in
satisfaction of the liability to pay the price. The fad that as a
result of the transfer of the shares of the "company" to the
assessee firm, the latter obtained considerable profits, will not
alter the true nature of the transaction"

2.60. It was further observed that "What exactly is the
meaning of the expression "full value of the consideration for
which sale is made? Is it the consideration agreed to be paid
or is it market value of the consideration? In the case of sale
for a price, there is no question of any market value unlike in
the case of an exchange"

2.61. In the case of CIT v George Henderson and Co (supra),
the Assessee sold shares at INR. 136 per share when the
market value of the shares was INR 620 per share. The
Income-tax Officer held that the respondent had sold the
shares at the book value of Rs. 136 per share whereas the
market value of the shares on that date was Rs. 620 per share
and the difference of Rs. 484 per share was capital gain
arising from the sale of the shares under section 12B of the
Income-tax Act, 1922.

2.62. As observed in this case the dispute was whether the
capital gain should be computed at INR 13$ i.e. the price fixed
in the agreement or at INR 620 which is the fair market value.
In which case, the Hon'ble SC concluded that the transaction
under consideration is a transaction of sale and further
observed that "In case of a sale, [he full value of the
consideration is the full sale price actually paid. The legislature
had to use the words "full value of the consideration " because
it_¢ was dealing not merely with sale but with other types of
transfer, such as exchange, where the consideration would be
other than money” If it is therefore held in the present case
that the actual price received by the respondent was at the

>age |112

rate of Rs. 136 per share the full value of the consideration
must be taken at the rate ofRs. 136per share."

2.63. The above observation of the Hon'ble SC gives a
dictum that in the case of transfer of capital asset, when
transfer is in the nature of sale, full value of consideration
should be taken to be the fixed amount of consideration
agreed between both the parties. Whereas in the case transfer
of capital assets is in lieu of another asset, is a transfer in the
nature of exchange and full value of consideration will be the
fair market value of the asset received by the transferor.
Capital gain in the case of the Appellant for the above
transfers should be computed as per the said principle.

2.64. Relevant clauses for 1% transfer of the "Share
Exchange Agreement" dated 30 June 2006, are as

under: " -. °,
"WHEREAS:-

(A) The Parties hereto have agreed that the Target Companies
beeen have an aggregate book value

ofGBP 221,444,034, being also the aggregate nominal value of
the Consideration Shares....: and

(B) The parties have agreed that the Vendor shall sell to the
Purchaser and the Purchaser shall purchase from the Vendor
the Sale Shares (as hereinafter defined) and that the
consideration for the Sale Shares shall be the issue by the
Purchaser of the Consideration Shares .... to the Vendor Upon
the terms and conditions specified and contained in the
agreement - (refer Page 61 of the Paper Book).

Consideration: -' "

The total consideration for the sale and purchase of the Sale
Shares shall be the allotment and issue of the Consideration
Shares at par (credited as fully paid) to the Vendor at
Completion " (refer Page 62 of the Paper Book)

2.65. As observed by the above agreement, consideration
was agreed as an allotment and issue of the consideration
shares. Which means that for the transfer of shares of nine
subsidiaries, the

consideration was paid by the CUHL to CPLC was by way of
issue of shares i.e. it was a transfer by way of exchange.
Hence, full value of consideration in the hands of the CPLC
should be the fair market value of the shares of CUHL on the
date of transfer.

2.66. As per the ratio laid down by Hon'ble SC, capital gain
in the hands of CPLC should be computed as under:

J

(a) Full value of consideration should be the fair market value
of the shares of nine subsidiarj companies. However, since the
valuation of the shares of CUHL was not available on the date
of transfer, value of the shares of CIHL transferred vide
agreements dated 15 September 2006 and 12 October 2006,
is considered for the purpose of fair value of shares.

(b) Though the capital gain has accrued in the hands of CPLC
and was covered under the provision of section 9(1 )(i) of the
Act. dealing with indirect transfers, in the assessment
proceedings of CPLC, the AO has not alleged to tax the same
in the hands of the CPLC.

2.67. In the case of 2™ transfer, Relevant clauses of the
"Share Exchange Agreement" dated 07 August 2006, are as
under:

'WHEREAS the parties hereto have agreed that the Vendor
Shall sell to the Purchaser and the Purchaser shall purchase
from the Vendor the Sale Shares (as hereinafter defined) and
that the consideration for the Sale Shares shall be the
Consideration Shares (as hereinafter defined), upon the terms
and conditions specified and contained in this agreement -
Refer Page 68 of the Paper Book.

Consideration:

3.1 The total consideration for the sale and purchase of the
Sale Shares shall be the Consideration.

3.2 The Consideration Shares shall be allotted and issued at
par (credited as fully paid) to the Vendor at Completion.

3.3 The subscriber shares shall be credited as fully paid at par
as from Completion " - Refer Page 69 of the Paper Book.

2.68. As observed by the above agreement, consideration
was agreed as an allotment and issue of the consideration
shares. Which means that for the transfer of shares of nine
subsidiaries, the consideration was paid by CIHL to CUHL was
by way of issue of shares i.e. it was a transfer by way of

exchange. Hence, full value of consideration in the hands of
the CUHL should be the fair market value of the shares of
CIHL on the date of transfer.

2.69. Capital gain on the 2™ transfer of shares i.e. transfer
of shares of nine subsidiaries by CUHL to CIHL on 7 August
2006 should be computed as under:

J

(c) Full value of consideration is taken as the fair value of the
shares of nine subsidiary companies. When the shares of CIHL
were transferred vide agreements dated 15 September 2006
and 12 October 2006, since there is not much time difference
between the two transfers, the valuation of shares which is
received on transfer of shares of CIHL is considered for the
purpose of fair value of shares.

(d) Full value of consideration in the hands of CPLC should be
considered as cost of acquisition in the hands of CUHL. nv

2.70. Capital gain on the 3 transfer of shares i.e. transfer
of shares of CIHL to CIL should be computed as under:

(e) Full value of consideration as considered by the AO in
computation of capital gains.

(f) Full value of consideration in the hands of CUHL in the
capital gain computed in Para 2.69 above, should be
considered as cost of acquisition in the hands of CUHL.

2.71. Relying on the rationale of the decision of Hon'ble SC
discussed above in the George Henderson (supra) and others
referred to above, for computing capital gains of these
transactions [i.e. Sr. 2.53(a) and 2.53(b)], full value of
consideration should be taken as fair market value of shares of
nine subsidiaries transferred. In view of the same, it was
argued that cost of acquisition of the CIHL shares in the hands
of the Appellant should be deemed to be the fair market value
of the shares of CIHL on the date of acquisition. .

2.72. However, both the transactions at Sr. No. 2.53(a) and
2.53(b) (i.e. transfer of shares of nine subsidiaries by CPLC to
Appellant and Appellant to CIHL) were not sought to be taxed
by the tax authorities. This, in the humble submission of the
Appellant, does not prevent the step up of cost of acquisition
in The hands of the Appellant-namely, the cost basis of the
shares of CIHL-from being deemed to be the fair market value
of the shares of CIHL in determining whether Appellant
enjoyed any capital gains.

2.73. Since, the capital gains for transactions at Sr. No.
2.53(a) and 2.53(b) will be computed by applying fair market
value, consequential cost of acquisition of shares of CIHL in
transaction at Sr. No. 2.53(d) should also be deemed to be the
fair market value of the shares of CIHL. -

2.74. Hon'ble Members will appreciate that, for the purpose
of computation of said capital gains, cost of acquisition is
incorrectly considered by the AO as only the nominal value of
shares issued by CIHL to CUHL i.e. £ 25,12,24,744 (i.e. £
221,444,034 plus £ 2,97,80,710). However, as demonstrated
above, £ 25,12,24,744 is only the nominal value of the shares
of CIHL and not the fair market value. In view of the above,
for the purpose of computation of capital gains in the hands of
Appellant, cost of acquisition should be the fair market value
of the shares of CIHL on the date of acquisition. . , ?:

2.75. However, above submission of the Appellant are not
accepted by learned DRP on account of various reason
mentioned at Page 145 and 146 of the Appeal Documents. For
the ready reference* the said contentions of learned DRP is
discussed in subsequent paragraphs. , ,

2.76. Decision of George Henderson (supra) is discarded on
account of the following reasons:

a. Hon'ble SC has merely remanded case back to the
Tribunal;

b. |The Judgment does not accord the assessee liberty to
transfer assets at less than the fair marketvalue to a related
entity;

c. Judgment was under the Income-tax Act, 1922;

d. The price at which the asset has been transferred in the
instant case is neither in dispute and or is the revenue
questioning the adequacy of the same; e. Various provisions
of Income-tax Act, 1961 pertaining to foreign Companies in

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016

| 116

respect of arms length pricing render this judgment totally
inapplicable in the instant case.

2.77. With due respect to the above observation of the
learned DRP, the Appellant most respectfully submits that
learned DRP has not been able to appreciate the correct
perspective from which this decision is quoted by the
Appellant. Though the case was remanded back by the Hon'ble
SC and was rendered in the context of earlier Income-tax Act,
1922. However, the principle of sale and exchange were
prevailing under both the laws (i.e. 1922 and 1961). In view
of the same, the principle dealt with by Hon'ble SC hold good
even today. Further, when the case is again remanded back to
the Tribunal after giving the principle of law does dilutes the
precedent value of the judgment.

2.78. Further, learned DRP has made a very generic remark
saying that various provision of Income-tax Act, 1961
pertaining to foreign Companies in respect of arm's length
price will render this judgment totally inapplicable in the
instant case. However, except for making a generic statement,
no specific provision of the Act is pointed by the learned DRP.
2.79. Decision of Gillanders Arbuthnot (supra) is discarded
on account of the following reasons:

a. Ratio decindendi deals with whether the sale of an agency
business and whether the consideration was essentially a
revenue receipt or a capital receipt;

b. Facts in this case were different from the case of the
Appellant. In the case of the Appellant, it is not the contention
of the Appellant to tax the sum received by the UK entity from
CIL as revenue receipt;

c. Judgement is an expression of interpretation of law as it
stood on that date;

d. Apex court laid down was that in case of sale of an asset
what is material is the actual price realized rather than a
notional market value. Undoubtedly provisions have been
introduced by the legislature since then with a view to prevent
evasion of Income-tax by undervaluing the sales consideration
particularly in relation of immovable property. In the instant
case, neither the quantum of the sales consideration not its
divergence from the notional sale price is in dispute.

e. When the sale price of the shares of the CIHL received by
the Appellant from CIL is not being questioned by revenue.

f. In the case before SC it was the case of long term capital
gain, whereas in the case of the Appellant it was a case of
short term capital gain.

2.80. Your Honors will appreciate that again learned DRP
has rejected the above decision on the various irrelevant and
incorrect grounds. The issue of capital or revenue receipt was
never before the Hon'ble SC. Further, though the judgment
deals with the law prevailing as it stood on that date, however,
sale and exchange were also included in the definition of
"transfer" under the old (i.e. 1922 law) and new law (i.e. 1961
law). Further, the other differentiating points of undervaluing
the immovable property, long term and short term, etc are not
at all a relevant factor for distinguishing these decisions. With
due respect to the learned DRP, the Appellant hereby submits
that by making all the above irrelevant observations, learned
DRP has very conveniently tried to avoid the actual issue
submitted before the them.

2.81. Without prejudice to the above, the AO has alleged
that, on sale of shares of CIHL, huge gain is accounted in the
books of accounts, by the Appellant. Your Honors will
appreciate that the gains accounted in the financial statements
of the Appellant does not determine the tax treatment while
offering any income for taxing in India. Taxability of such
gains will be determined as per the provisions of the Act,
which also includes interpretation of the law by the Hon'ble
SC’.

2.82. Reliance is placed on the decision of Hon'ble SC in the
case of Kedarnath Jute Mfg. Co. Ltd. v CIT [1971] 82 ITR363
(SC) wherein it was held that "Whether the assessee is
entitled to a particular deduction or not will depend on the
provision of law relating thereto and not on the view which the
assessee might take of his rights nor can the existence or
absence of entries in the books of account . be decisive or
conclusive in the matter,'"’ In view of the same, even if the
amount is recorded as gain in the books of CUHL, it will not
necessarily be taxable as per the provisions of the Act.

2.83. Reliance is further placed on the decision of Hon'ble
SC in the case ofTuticorin Alkali Chemicals & Fertilizers Ltd v
CIT [1997] 227 ITR 172 (SC) wherein it was held that It is
wherein it was that "// is true that this Court has very often
referred to accounting practice for ascertainment of profit

made by a company or value of the assets of a company. But
when the question is whether a receipt of money is taxable or
not or whether certain deductions from that receipt are
permissible in law or not, the question has to be decided
according to the principles of law and not in accordance with
accountancy practice."

During the course of hearing Ld. counsel further referred to the
additional ground raised vide ground No. 3.12 contesting that Ld.
assessing officer has erred in taxing the appellant by invoking the
retrospective amendment to section 9 (1) (i) of the act introduced by
The Finance Act, 2012, which was not on the statute, when the India
and United Kingdom tax treaty entered into force. Therefore it was
submitted that the taxability of the appellant should have been
determined under the provisions of section 9 (1) (i) of the act, which
were applicable when the India United Kingdom tax treaty was entered
into force. For this, the Ld. authorized representative took us to the
article 14 related to capital gains of Double Taxation Avoidance
Agreement entered into between India and United Kingdom wherein it
is provided that each contracting state may tax capital gains in
accordance with the provisions of its domestic law. He therefore
submitted that the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement between
India and United Kingdom entered into on 11". February 1994 and

therefore, the law of chargeability of capital gain under domestic tax

law is required to be looked into as it was prevailing on that date and
not incorporating the retrospective amendment thereto. In short his
arguments was that for the purposes of determining capital gain tax
on this transaction retrospective amendment made should not eb
considered. For this he relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Delhi
High Court in case of Director of Income Tax versus New Skies
Satellite BV (2016) 68 Taxmann.com 8 (Delhi). He further vehemently
contested that the design internal reorganization of Indian operation of
the Cairn group and there can be no tax which can be levied on the
internal reorganization where there is no increase in the wealth of the
appellant.

With respect to computation of the capital gain, he referred that
provisions of section 55 (2) do not apply to the facts of the case and
therefore he relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of
India in case of Miss Dhoon Dadabhoy Kapadia versus Commissioner of
income tax (1967) (63 ITR 651) (SC). He further referred to the
decision of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in CIT versus R R
Ramakrishna Pillai (1967) 66 ITR 725 (SC) and submitted that in the
present case, it is a case of exchange and not of sale as the
consideration has been settled by allotment of shares, therefore it was

not a transfer for a price but for exchange of assets and therefore the

fair market value of the assets shall be considered for working out
cpital gain in the hands of assesseee. Therefore in the present case of
the series of the transaction, There is no cost of acquisition which is
less than the exchange price and hence there is no capital gain. He
further relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Bombay high court in
case of Commissioner of income tax - 6 versus Bharat Bijlee Ltd
(2014) 46 Taxmann.com 257 (Bombay). His contention was that of
acquisition of those shares is the market value of those shares and
therefore the capital gain arising on these transaction is nil.

On Ground No 3 and 4 of the appeal, Id Departmental representative
vehemently contested the arguments of the assessee and supported
that the Income of the appellant is chargeable to tax in India in view
of the clear-cut provision of section 4, 5 and 9 of the Income tax Act

1961. His main arguments were as under :-

Preliminary submission '

The issue to be decided in this case is, whether any gain
accrued to CUHL in the financial year 2006-07 by acquiring
and selling 'CIHL shares'? If yes, whether such gain was
taxable in India?

On the basis of admitted facts and position of the law, the
Revenue's case is that: (i) not only substantial gain
accrued to CUHL by first acquiring and then selling 'CIHL
shares' in financial year 2006-07, and (ii) this short term
capital gain was taxable in India as the shares so sold
derived their value substantially from the assets situated in
India.

To this end in these submissions, in first part those facts
are enumerated which are undisputed. The second part
discusses a brief history of the transactions as ascertained
from the documents filed by CUHL or CIL at different
stages in different proceedings. In the third part, the legal
position in relation to the gains arising to CUHL from the
transactions undertaken by CUHL, and its taxability in
India is stated. In the next part, main contentious issues
are taken up, with the Revenue's position outlined on such
issues. Last part is the conclusions.

Part-1: UNDISPUTED FACTS

A Share Purchase DeedVas executed on 12" October 2006
between CEP, CUHL and CIL in respect of the
sale/purchase of the 'CIHL  shares'. The deed
unambiguously identified CUHL as "the Seller" and CIL as
"the Purchaser" with CEP being "the Guarantor". Prior to
this deed another Subscription and Share Purchase
Agreement” was also executed on 15" September 2006
between the same three parties, where also the said
parties were identified similarly i.e. CUHL being the "the
Seller", CIL being the "the Purchaser" and CEP as "the
Guarantor",

Pursuant to the Share Purchase Deed and the Subscription
and Share Purchase Agreement, CUHL "sold the 100%
investment in Cairn India Holdings Ltd"3i.e 251,224,744
shares of CIHL to CIL "for a total consideration amounting

to INK 266,818,710,140 partly in cash and partly by issue
of its [CIL] shares to CUHL"*. Thus a total consideration of
"INR 266,819 mn" or Rs 26681.9 crores was "paid for
acquisition of CIHL"® by CIL to CUHL

Altogether 251,224,744 CIHL shares of £ 1 each were
earlier acquired by CUHL in the following manner:

221,444.034 shares - acquired on 7 August 2006

Following the Share Exchange Agreement® CUHL
transferred shares of nine (9) group companies’ to CIHL.
In return, as a consideration CIHL issued 221,444,034 of
its own shares of £1 each to CUHL, and

29,780,710 shares - acquired on 1*t September 2006

Pursuant to a Debt Conversion Agreement®executed
separately, CUHL sold to CIHL a debt of £29,780,710
(which was due from CEHL)’. In consideration, CIHL issued
29,780,710 of its own shares of £1 face value each to
CUHL.

The shares of CIHL derived their value substantially from
the assets situate in India as being a holding company of
the nine (9) subsidiaries it was specifically incorporated
"within the Cairn group" to "hold Indian oil and gas
assets".

Part-11: BRIEF HISTORY

Since 1996 CEP has been acquiring oil and gas assets
situated in India through its subsidiaries, and as on 30"
June 2006 it was holding Indian oil and gas assets through
nine (9) wholly owned foreign subsidiary companies**.

On 30° june 2006, pursuant to a Share Exchange
Agreement” the entire share capital of nine (9) wholly
owned subsidiaries of CEP having "an aggregate book
value off 221,444,034"'° was transferred to CUHL In
exchange, CUHL issued 221,444,034 of its shares of £1
each to CEP.

On 7‘ August 2006, through yet another Share Exchange
Agreement*, CUHL transferred the shares of
aforementioned nine (9) subsidiary companies having an

Page |123

aggregate book value of £221,444,034 to CIHL. In lieu
thereof CIHL issued 221,444,034 of its shares to CUHL.

11. Then on 1% September 2006 two more transactions took
placeunder a separate 'Debt Conversion Agreement'*’. On
that date, CEP was owed from CEHL (a group company} a
debt of £29,780,710, which was first sold to CUHL which in
turn assigned to CIHL in the following manner:

. CEP sold the debt of £29,780,710 to CUHL. As a
consideration, CUHL issued 29,780,710 of its own shares
of £1 each to CEP;

CUHL in turn assigned the same debt of £29,780,710 to
CIHL. As a consideration CIHL issued 29,780,710 of its
own shares of £1 each to CUHL.

As a result, the debt of £29,780,710 due from CEHL to CEP
was finally vested with CIHL-for which CIHLissued
29,780,710 shares of £1 each to CUHL, who in turn issued
equal number of shares (of £1 each) to CEP.

All transactions leading to CUHL acquiring 251,224,744
CIHL shares can be seen as below:

Thus on 1% September 2006, CUHL was_ holding
251,224,744 shares of CIHL - having acquired
221,444,034 sharesin exchange of the shares of nine (9)
companies (book value £221,444,034)and 29,780,710
shares in lieu of the debt of £29,780,710 transferred to

CIHL.
12. It was these 251,224,744 shares of CIHL which when sold
to CIL resulted in total consideration of

Rs26681.87croresreceived in the hands of CUHL.The
transactions of sale/purchase/swap were effected in the

Thus, CIL had sufficient funds to pay the sale consideration of
Rs 26681 cr to CUHL for acquiring 251,224,744 CIHL shares
Part-Ill: LEGAL POSITION

14. CUHL being a non-resident, any income accruing or arising
to it, whether directly or indirectly, through the transfer of
a capital asset situate in India shall be deemed to accrue
or arise in India u/s 9(I}(i).

15. CIHL Shares' being the capital asset sold and transferred
to CIL, are deemed to be situated in India’® as they
derived their value substantially from the assets situated in
India even though CIHL was incorporated outside India’°.

16. CUHL being the transferor of a capital asset situated in
India was liable to tax in India on the capital gains
accruing from such transfer u/s 45. Even under the DTAA
between India and UK the capital gains is to be taxed in
accordance with the domestic law (Article 14).

17. Under section 48 the chargeable gain is to be computed by
deducting the cost of acquisition from the full value of the
consideration received as a result of the transfer of the
capital asset. The capital gains has been thus computed by
the AO as follows:

Part-IV: CONTENTIOUS ISSUES
18. Cost of acquisition of the capital asset i.e. 251,224,744
CIHL shares
251,224,744 CIHL shares were acquired by CUHL in two
tranches.

¥Y 221,444,034 shares of £1 face value each acquired (on 7‘

Sep'06) by selling a debt of £29,780,710 to CIHL”?.

The transaction of sale of debt of £29,780,710 by CUHL for
a consideration of equal number of shares from CIHL
clearly establishes the price that CUHL paid for each CIHL

share at the time of acquisition i.e. £1. The earlier
transaction of acquiring 221,444,034 shares was also by
paying in the form of nine (9) companies, whose book
value was £221,444,034, placing the cost of acquisition for
each CIHL share as £1. The cost of acquisition for
251,224,744 CIHL shares, which were eventually sold by
CUHL to CIL, was accordingly taken as £ 251,224,744 (i.e.
Rs 2178,36,97,552)°. Thus, for acquisition of 251,224,744
CIHL shares, CUHL parted with the assets worth
£251,224,744*4which has accordingly been taken as the
cost of acquisition. * -y-

19. Full value of Consideration received in respect of the
capital asset

i.e. 251,224,744 CIHL shares

It is undisputed that for selling 251,224,744 of 'CIHL
shares' CUHL received from CIL a sale consideration?® of
Rs26,681 cr, partly in cash (Rs 12,893 cr) and partly in the
form of shares of CIL (having market value of Rs 13,788
cr). The contention that no real money was paid or
received in the transactions of sale of shares to CIL is
fallacious and incorrect, considering that:

v Of the four transaction enumerated in para 12 above, at
least one transaction of sale of 61,073,032 CIHL shares
was for hard cash of Rs 6101 cr.

v The book entries of 5037 cr and 1755 cr of cash received
from CIL, for sale of 41,493,659 and 13,390,789 CIHL
shares respectively, were out of the amounts received by
CIL as subscription money for its 365,028,898shares.

v Even in the swap transaction, CUHL received 861,664,893
shares of CILhaving market value of 13,788 cr for selling
135,267,264 CIHL shares to CIL That the consideration
received in the form of CIL shares was of some value is
also evident from the fact that when CIL shares were sold
later in 2011-12 to Vedanta Group @ Rs 355, the cost of
their acquisition was claimed as Rs 160/190*° per share
and not zero, which would have been the case if receipt of
these shares was a mere paper transaction having no
money value. This clearly shows that even in a swap
transaction the valuable asset was parted with and the

equivalent value received in the form of shares having
money worth of Rs 13788 cr

Thus for selling 'CIHL shares' the consideration received by
CUHL was real, either as money orthe money's worth, and
not notional.

Applicability of Explanation-5 and constitutional validity of
the retrospective amendment

Explanation - 5 to section 9(I)(i) of the Income Tax Act,
was inserted vide Finance Act 2012w.r.e.f. 1/4/1962 as a
clarification to remove doubts concerning taxability of the
gains arising from indirect transfer of assets situated in
India.

It is not disputed that CIHL shares derived their value from
the assets situated in India. Any gain arising from sale of
such shares was always taxable in India.

Reopening of assessment u/s 148 pursuant to the
retrospective amendment Since in this case no return was
filed by the assessee for the relevant period despite the
despite having income chargeable to tax in India by way of
the capital gains arising from the transfer of the assets
situated in India, reopening of assessment u/s 147 within
the prescribed time limit was entirely valid.

Part-V: CONCLUSIONS

Through a series of transactions, CEP transferred the
assets it owned in India, first to CUHL and then to CIHL,
the companies incorporated outside India. Eventually, the
assets situated in India were transferred to CIL, an Indian
company, for a consideration of Rs 26681 cr. The final
transaction of selling Indian assets to an Indian company
was done after the market value of Indian assets was
ascertained by independent valuation and _ finally
established through the IPO. Through sale of Indian assets
to an Indian company, Cairn Group made stupendous
gains and paid no taxes anywhere.

23. Moreover, when asked to file tax returns and pay tax dues
in India, the Cairn Group has dragged Government of India
before an International Arbitration Tribunal by invoking
Bilateral Investment Protection Agreement between India
and UK. India is contesting the jurisdiction of the
Arbitration Tribunal in this matter of taxation, which is a
sovereign function. Presently, the matter remains pending
before International Arbitration Tribunal.

24. On the gains so earned from the sale of Indian assets,
Cairn Group has not paid a single paisa in tax till now,
despite Government giving every facility; including
assurance of waiver of interest and penalty under a
Dispute Resolution Scheme that is to run till 31 December
2016. The Department has also not pursued the demand
till now2’, to allow the assessee to avail the benefit of the
Scheme.”

Ld. departmental representative submitted a printout of presentation
made during the hearing. He further made a reference to page No.
106 of the paper book which is a debt assignment agreement dated
01/09/2006 amongst cairn energy plc, Cairn UK Holdings Ltd, Cairn
India Holdings Ltd and Cairn energy hydrocarbons Ltd. He referred
that by this agreement debt of GBP 29780710 was
assigned/transferred by which Cairn energy plc, the vendor and Cairn
energy hydrocarbons Ltd,the debtor, have agreed to sell it to Cairn UK
Holdings Ltd, the appellant. He further referred to the letter placed at
page No. 158 of the paper book submitted by assessee before Ld.
Dispute Resolution Panel wherein while describing step 3, being
subscription and share purchase agreement between cairn energy plc,

Cairn UK Holdings Ltd, appellant, Cairn India Holdings Ltd and Cairn

India Ltd, the assessee himself has stated that the consideration for
the transfer was settled partly in cash and partly in shares of Cairn
India Ltd. He further referred for this purpose, initial funds were
infused in Cairn India Ltd on various date by Cairn UK Holdings Ltd and
from these funds Cairn India Ltd purchased some part of the shares
capital of Cairn India holding Ltd from Cairn UK Holdings Ltd,
therefore, he stated that a sum of Rs. 6101 crores are in fact
consideration paid in cash and therefore the transaction stated by the
assessee is not of exchange, but it is a sale transaction. He further
stated that all the agreements placed by the assessee are described as
subscription and share purchase agreement except the agreement
dated 07/08/2006 and 30/06/2006. Therefore he submitted that these
are the transaction of clear-cut purchase and sale of shares and not
case of exchange. He further referred to the history of section 9 of the
act and submitted that the impugned transaction entered into by the
assessee is hit by the provisions of section 9 (1) (i) read with
explanation 5 of that section as there is a transfer of share or interest
in a company as its value is substantially derived from assets located
in India. He relied up on decision of privy council in case of Rohdesia
metals Ltd (liquidator) versus Commissioner of taxes [ vol. IX ITR (

Statutes) 45 to explain source-based taxation and submitted that

AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

| 130

where the source of income is residing the income is chargeable to tax
in that particular source country. With respect to the provisions of
section 2 (14 ) of the act, he referred to the explanation inserted
w.e.f. 01/04/1962 by The Finance Act, 2012 and submitted that
‘property’ includes right of management or control. In the present
case, the right of management and control has been transferred from
one entity to another entity and therefore the provisions of section 2
(14) is also satisfied. With respect to the argument of the assessee
that at the time of entering into force the double taxation avoidance
between India and United Kingdom, taxing provision as per the
domestic law prevalent on that day are required to be seen, he
submitted that the explanation 5 inserted by The Finance Act, 2012 is
clarificatory in nature and therefore as on that date also the
transaction under dispute are chargeable to tax.

The Ld. authorized representative vehemently contested the
arguments of the Ld. Departmental representative and stated that the
agreements of transfer of shares and submitted that agreement also
refers to exchange and merely because reference to the ‘vendor’ and
‘purchaser’ is mentioned in those agreements it does not become the
transaction of sale. He further stated that in all these share transfer

agreements there is no mention of any value and therefore these

AY 2007-08

transactions are merely for exchange of shares. With respect of
exchange of the debt, he submitted that the debt is also exchanged by
way of allotment of shares and therefore it is still an agreement of
exchange. With respect to the reliance placed by the Ld. departmental
representative on the decision of the privy Council in Rohdesia metal
Ltd versus Commissioner of taxes, he submitted that the facts of that
case are not applicable in the present case as in that particular case,
the only issue was where the source of mining rights are situated, in
the present case the issue is shares are situated where they are
registered. As the shares are registered in Jersey they are not
situated in India but in Jersey.

We have carefully considered the rival contentions. To put the facts
very simply in a narrow compass , the assessee company is a tax
resident of United Kingdom which was incorporated on 26" of June
2006. On 30/06/2006, it entered into the share exchange agreement
with Cairn energy Plc where the entire issued share capital of 9 wholly
owned subsidiary of Cairn energy plc were exchanged by issue of
221444034 — shares of appellant at the face value of GBP 1 each.
Thereafter the appellant entered into a share exchange agreement
dated 07/08/2016 with another company Cairn India Holdings Ltd

which was incorporated on 02/08/2006 in Jersey and appellant

exchanged all the shares of those 9 subsidiaries with that company for
issue to the appellant of 221444034 shares of GBP 1 each at par of
that co, further for a debt of GBP 29780710 of Cairn energy
hydrocarbons Ltd to Cairn energy plc was assigned to appellant for a
consideration of 2978 0710 ordinary share of GBP 1 each by appellant
to Cairn energy plc. It was further assigned by appellant to Cairn
India holding Ltd, Jersey for 29780710 ordinary shares of GBP 1 each
issued by Jersey company to the appellant. Thereby, in nutshell,
29780710 shares were acquired by appellant of Cairn India holding
Ltd on account of sale/ transfer/ assignment of debt. Therefore by
this stage appellant acquired ( 221444034 + 29780710) 251224744
of Cairn India holding Ltd. Subsequently the assessee sold all the
shares to a newly formed company in India i.e., cairn India Ltd,
through subscription and share purchase agreement dated
15/09/2006, and share purchase deed dated 12/10/2006. As per
submission of the assessee, consideration for this transfer was settled
partly in cash and partly by shares issued in cairn India Ltd in favour
of the appellant. It is an undisputed fact that Cairn India holding Ltd is
the holding company of 9 subsidiary companies in India who are
engaged in the business in oil and gas sector in India. Therefore the

transaction entered into by appellant of transferring 251224744 shares

of Cairn India holdings Limited to Cairn India Limited on 12/10/2006
is whether liable to tax in India or not is the precise issue before us.
We also examined the other connected issues raised before us arising
out of the about transaction as under:-

i. The 1% contention of the assessee is that lower authorities have
erred in holding that capital gains arising to the appellant on
account of the sales of shares of Cairn India Holdings Ltd to cairn
India Ltd is deemed to accrue or arise in India under section 9
(1) (i) of the act and is therefore, chargeable to tax in India. The
argument of the assessee is that retrospective amendment to
section 9 (1) (i) of the act by The Finance Act, 2012 is bad in law
and ultra vires. In view of the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in L. Chandra Kumar V Union of India 2002-TIOL-159-
SC-CB_ this is not the right forum to challenge validity of
provisions of the Income Tax Act. In view of this contention of
the assessee rejected.

ii. The 2"? contention raised before us by the assessee is that it is
an internal reorganization of the group, as there is no change in
controlling interest as a result of these internal or reorganization.
The contention of the assessee is that the reason for the internal

reorganization was with a view to bring entire Indian business

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

operations of Cairn group under one Indian company. This was
followed by listing the shares of this Cairn India Ltd on various
Stock exchanges in India. It is further contended that there is no
3 party involved in the whole transaction except the group
itself and there can be no tax, which can be levied on the
internal reorganization when there is no increase in the wealth
of the appellant. Explanation to section 2 (14) was a added by
The Finance Act, 2012 with retrospective effect from 1/4/1962
as under :-
“Explanation For the removal of doubts, it is hereby
clarified that “property” includes and shall be deemed to
have always included any rights in or in relation to an
Indian company, including rights of management or control
or any other rights whatsoever,”
Therefore according to the above provisions, right of
management and control is a property u/s 2(14) of the act.
In the present case the shareholders of 9 companies situated
in India which controls the oil and Gas__ sector in India are
having the ‘ property’ of the right to manage and control that
business by virtue of shareholding and further such rights
are ‘rights in or in relation to an India company’. Therefore any
income arising ‘through or from’ any property In India_ shall be

chargeable to tax as income deemed to accrue or arise in India

in terms of the provision of section 9 (1) (i) of the act. The cairn
India Holdings Limited is the holding company of those
subsidiary companies and appellant is holding company of
the Cairn India Holdings Limited. Therefore, it is apparent that
appellant is holding rights in control and management of the
shares of the 9 Indian subsidiary companies engaged in the
business of oil and gas Sector through holding subsidiary
structure. Now appellant has transferred this property to Cairn
India Limited partly in cash and partly in exchange of shares.
Appellant submits that it is a case of business reorganization and
there is no increase in wealth of the Group. According to us
there are series of transactions entered in to by the group, which
culminated in to the Initial Public Offering of 98639903 shares @
160 per share of Cairn India Limited. Part of the purchase
price of the share of Rs 6101 crores have been paid out of the
proceeds of the public issue by Cairn India Limited to the
appellant. In the IPO as per Annexure 1 to the letter
submitted before DRP placed at page no 159 of the paper book
of the revenue shows that in IPO, cairn India Limited has
divested 30.50 % of the stake to the General Public and

Institutional investors. The complete financial arrangement of

the Group has ended through series of transfer of shares from
U K Jurisdictions to Jersey Jurisdiction to India. On divesting 30
% stake in these oil and gas assets located in India and part of
IPO proceeds app. Rs 6101/- Crore paid to the appellant in U
K. Therefore, we are not convinced that these series of
transactions entered in to by the group is merely a business
reorganization process in consolidation of its oil and gas business
India. Furthermore arguments of the assess also do not have
any rational that there is no increase in the wealth of appellant
as the value of the holdings of the appellant in Cairn India
Limited has been unlocked due to IPO and value is derived by

the book building process.

The third arguments of the assessee is that there is no real
income accruing to the assessee and only real income can be
taxed . Relying on the decision of Honourable Calcutta High
court in case CIT V Kusum products Limited [2014] 49
taxmann.com 403 ( Calcutta) it was submitted that post these
internal organization is no real income has_ accrued to the
appellant as al the steps mentioned of _ internal

reorganization all the assets which the appellant was holding in

India are now available in different form. Whether assessee has
earned any gain or not to arrive at that decision one has to
look at the financial statements of the appellant for year ended
on 31%* December 2006 and 2007 which are placed at page no
254 to 285 of the paper book of the assessee. For the Year
ended on 31/12/2006 the note No 13 of the audited accounts
shows the transaction with related party. These transactions

shows the following details :-
“incorporation of cairn India limited and Sale of
Investments in cairn India Holdings Limited “
on 21/08/2006, the company incorporated Cairn India Ltd
(registered in India). On 15 September, 2006, the
company entered into the subscription and share purchase
agreement with Cairn India Ltd and Cairn India Holdings
Ltd (both subsidiaries of the company). The subscription
and share purchase agreement provided for Cairn India Ltd
to acquire approximately 21.85% of the share capital of
Cairn India Holdings Ltd into trenches.

On 12 October the company entered into a 2"! agreement
with Cairn India Ltd, the share purchase deed, which
provided for Cairn India Ltd to acquire the remaining
78.15% of the share capital of Cairn India Holdings Ltd.
53.84% was acquired through a share for share exchange
and 24.31% was acquired for cash. Total cash proceeds
were approximately GBP 677m. GBP 312 M was receivable
in Indian rupees and the company entered into an
currency exchange option over the year end to convert the
Indian rupees into GBP.

The sale of Cairn India Holdings Ltd to Cairn India Ltd
resulted in the company generating an exceptional gain on
sale of GBP1.36 1 billion.”

Further reading of note No. 6, which relate to taxation, It is
mentioned that no tax has been provided in respect of the
disposal of part of the company’s investment in its subsidiary is
the disposal is exempt from tax under schedule 7AC of the

Taxation of the chargeable Gains Act 1992.

In view of this, the argument of the assessee that there is no
increase in the wealth of the appellant and there is no real
income earned by the assessee does not deserve to be accepted.
In fact, the assessee has earned substantial gain on sale of the
shares and also has gained on account of taxes too as according
to the assessee itself such gain is not chargeable to tax.
Therefore, the assessee has earned the real income on account
of sale of its shares in Cairn India Holdings Ltd to Cairn India

Ltd.

The next argument of the assessee is that while computation of
the capital gain in the hands of the appellant is made, the cost of
acquisition should be stepped up to the fair value of the shares
of cairn India holding Ltd on the date of acquisition. Claim of the

assessee is that share exchange agreement dated 30

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi

AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

08/06/2006, share exchange agreement dated 07/08/2006 are
both transaction of exchange of share for the shares. Further,
the assignment of debt was also with respect to exchange of the
shares in lieu of debt. In the last impugned transaction, which is,
subject matter of dispute is also share purchase agreement
dated 15/09/2006 and share purchase deed dated 12/10/2006.
By this agreement shareholding in Cairn India holding Ltd was
transferred by appellant to Cairn India Ltd in for trenches for a
consideration of Rs. 2266,81,87,10,140/-— which was paid partly
in cash by Cairn India Ltd and partly by issue of equity shares in
Cairn India Ltd., Therefore, it is submitted that 1%¢ and 2"
transfer is by way of exchange and 3" transfer is by way of sale.
The main thrust of the argument of the assessee is that when
any asset is transferred in lieu of another asset and no specific
amount for consideration is agreed between the parties that is a
case of transfer by way of exchange. For this, Id AR tried to
substantiate it that in none of the agreements no specific
amount for consideration is mentioned. Therefore according to
the assessee while computing capital gains in such cases fair
market value of the asset received in consideration for the

assets transferred should be considered as full value of

consideration. The Ld. authorized representative of the assessee
has heavily relied upon the decision of the Hon’ble Supreme
Court in the case of CIT versus Gillander Arbuthnot and
company (1973) 87 ITR 407 (SC) and CIT versus George
Henderson and company limited (1967) 66 ITR 622 (SC). The
Ld. authorized representative also relied on the decision of
Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of CIT versus R.R.
Ramakrishna Pillai (1967) 66 ITR 725 (SC) wherein it has been
held that when a person carrying on the business transfers the
assets to accompany in consideration for allotment of shares it
would be case of exchange and not of sale. Therefore it was
submitted that in the case of the appellant for the above
transfer the capital gain should be computed in accordance with
those principle stating that where transfer of assets is in lieu of
another asset the full value of the consideration shall be the fair
market value of the assets received by the transferor. Further
assessee has submitted that the 1% and 2™ transfer of share as
per the stand of revenue is also chargeable to capital gain.
Therefore, it was submitted that

1. capital gain in the hands of Cairn energy plc who
exchange the shares in the 1° transaction receiving
a sum of Rs. 266818710140/- will have the cost of

AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page [141

acquisition of Rs. 21783697552/-and may be liable
to capital gain tax in the hands of that cairn Energy
PLC of Rs. 245035012588/-.

2. Similarly, in the case of 2™ transfer of shares on 7‘
of August 2006 when shares of 9 subsidiaries were
transferred by appellant to Cairn India holding Ltd
should be computed taking the full value of
consideration of Rs. 266818710140/-and the cost of
acquisition shall be taken at the same value being
the full value of consideration in the hands of Cairn
energy plc and therefore Nil capital gain shall be
chargeable. In the 2" trench of transaction full value
of consideration is taken as the fair value of the
shares of 9 subsidiaries company when the shares of
Cairn India holding Ltd were transferred by the
agreement dated 15/09/2006 and 12/10/2006, since
there is insignificant timing difference between the
two transfers the valuation of the shares which is
received on transfer of shares of Cairn India holding
Ltd is considered for the purpose of fair value of the
shares by the assessee.

3. Further, the 3™ transfer of shares where the shares
of Cairn India holding Ltd were transferred by
appellant to Cairn India Ltd, the computation of the
capital gain should be by taking the full value of
consideration of Rs. 266818710140/-and the cost of
acquisition should also be taken at the same value in

absence of any timing difference between acquitsion

and disposal and therefore the capital gain
chargeable to tax in the hands of the appellant is
Nil.

Against this, the Ld. departmental representative submitted that
it is not transaction of exchange, but it is a transaction of sale.
He referred to the sale purchase deed and subscription and
share purchase agreement according to which the appellant sold
the 100 % investment in Cairn India Holdings Ltd, of 25122474
for shares of cairne India holding Ltd, to cairn India Ltd for Rs.
266818710140/-and consideration is partly in cash and partly by
issue of shares of Cairn India Ltd to appellant. He further
submitted that appellant has acquired 221444034 shares in
exchange of the shares of 9 subsidiary companies and
29780710 shares in view of the debt transferred to Cairn India
Holdings Limited. | Therefore he submitted that the capital gain
is required to be computed as per section 48 of the Income
Tax Act. According to which the full value of the consideration
received is Rs. 266818710140/- and from this, the actual cost of
acquisition is required to be deducted. He submitted that there is
no dispute on this figure between the revenue as well as the
assessee. However, the cost of acquisition stated by the

assessee of the identical value is under dispute. He further

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi

Page | 143

submitted that earlier two transactions have not at all been
taxed. Therefore, assessee cannot say that earlier transactions
also have been charged to tax. Regarding cost of acquisition the
claim of the revenue is that shares of Cairn India holding Ltd was
acquired by appellant into trenches , i.e. 221444034 shares @
GBP 1 per share and 29780710 shares by selling debt of GBP
29780780710. Therefore actual cost of acquisition is GBP
25124744 which is converted by applying exchange rate of Rs
86.71 per GBP is Rs. 21783697552/- only. On careful
consideration on the argument of the both the parties, it is noted
that there is no difference between the full value of the
consideration determined by the both the parties received
accruing to the assessee as a result of the transfer of the capital
asset. Both have taken the same at Rs. 266818710410/-only. As
there is no difference between the full value of consideration
taken by revenue as well as the assessee, we do not find any
reason to go in to the controversy whether the transaction is of
exchange or sale. Further merely because the consideration is
not stated in monetary terms in the various agreements and
deed, it cannot be said that sales consideration as well as the

cost cannot be determined of the transfer of the property for

working capital gain. In the present case the price of the
shares in each of the agreement is identified and the amount
of acquisition recorded in the books of accounts also proves that
what the cost is paid for acquisition of the shares. The dispute is
with respect to the cost of acquisition of the above property.
Revenue has determined it at Rs. 21783697552/-whereas the
assessee has stated the it should be taken at Rs.
266818710410/-only. According to the provisions of the Income
Tax Act, the Capital gain is required to be computed as per
method provided under section 48 wherein it is to be computed
by deducting from the full value of consideration received
accruing as a result of the transfer of the capital asset by the
cost of acquisition of the assets and cost of improvement
thereto. Section 55 (2) and (3) provides that for the purpose of
section 48 and section 49, what the cost of acquisition with

respect to certain transactions as is under :-

(2) For the purposes of sections 48 and 49, "cost of acquisition",--

acquisition of his original membership of the exchange ;

Provided that the cost of a capital asset, being trading or clearing rights of
the recognized stock exchange acquired by a shareholder who has been
allotted equity share or shares under such scheme of demutualization or

deemed to be income chargeable under the head “Capital gains” by

virtue of the provisions contained in section 47A, the cost of
acquisition of such asset to the transferee company shall be the cost
for which such asset was acquired by it.

(4) Where the capital gain arises from the transfer of a property,
the value of which has been subject to income-tax under clause (vii)
or clause (vila) of sub-section (2) of section 56, the cost of
acquisition of such property shall be deemed to be the value which
has been taken into account for the purposes of the said clause (vii)
3or clause (viia).
The property on transfer of which capital Gain is required to be
computed are the shares of Cairn India Holdings Ltd, which is
incorporated in Jersey and therefore shares transferred are not
of an Indian company but Jerseey Company. On conjoint reading
of provisions of section 48, 49 and 55 of the Act it is apparently
clear that property held by the assessee and its mode of
acquisition do not fall in any of the clauses which provides for
taking the cost of acquisition in the hands of the assessee in
these transaction being cost to the previous owner. No such
provision has also been cited before us. We also do not agree
with the contention of the assesee that as there is no timing
difference between the acquisition and disposal of shares , the
full value of consideration and the cost of acquits ion is same.

Provision of section 48, 49 and 55(2) of the act does not allow

AY 2007-08

such treatment. Therefore the computation of capital gain in the
hands of the assessee is required to be made _ by deducting
from the full value of consideration cost of acquisition incurred
by the assessee for acquisition of the property. We do not find
any infirmity in the order of the Id AO in taking the cost of
acquisition, which is derived by issues of shares as well as by
sale of debt. In the result we confirm the order of the Ld AO in
working out capital Gain on sale of shares of Cairn India Holding
limited in the hands of appellant of Rs. 245035012588/-.

The ground No. 3.12 has been raised as an additional ground of
the appeal , which has been admitted, and therefore requires to
be adjudicated. This ground states that according to Article 14 of
Indian United Kingdom except as provided in Article 8 and 9
each contracting state may tax capital gain in accordance with
the provisions of its domestic law. This Double Taxation
Avoidance Agreement was notified on 11.02.1994. The
contention of the assessee is that for the purpose of taxability of
capital gain the domestic law should be seen as it was in
existence on the date on which India UK DTAA was notified.
Precisely the argument of the assessee is that on 11.02.1994 the

retrospective amendment to section 9 made by the Finance Act

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

2012 was not in existence and therefore, if the assessee is
eligible for the benefit of DTAA then the domestic tax law is
required to be read ignoring the retrospective amendment made
by The Finance Act, 2012. To advance his argument Shri Percy
Pardiwala relying upon the decision of the Hon'ble Delhi High
Court in case of New Sky Satellite BV (2016) 68 Taxmann.com 8
(Del) has specifically referred to Para No. 36 to 40 of that
judgment. In response to this Id Departmental Representative
submitted that the contention raised by the Id Authorized
Representative is not correct. He stated that the India UK Treaty
specifically Article 40 has simply provided that capital gain are
required to be dealt with in accordance with the domestic tax
law. He submitted that transaction has taken place of sale of
share by the appellant to Cairn India Ltd in 2006 then how the
domestic law prevailing for chargeability of capital gain as on
1994 can be applied to that transaction. With respect to the
decision of Hon'ble Delhi High Court in case of DIT Vs. New Sky
Satellite BV ( supra) he submitted that the law laid down by
that decision with respect to chargeability of fees for technical
services with respect to definition in DTAA as well as in the

domestic state law. There Hon'ble Delhi High Court has held that

unless there is an amendment in the treaty the amended
definition of royalty and fees for technical services in Finance Act
by The Finance Act, 2012 cannot be applied where the assessee
is eligible for DTAA. We have carefully considered the rival
contentions and we reject the argument of assessee for the
reason that (i) provision in the Double Taxation Avoidance
Agreement cannot make the domestic law static with respect to
taxability of a particular income when unequivocally both sates
have left it to the domestic laws of the countries . (ii) suppose if
there is an exemption provided with retrospective effect under
the domestic law can Non-resident assessee be also denied the
benefit as it was also not the law at the time of notification of
Double Taxation Avoidance argument, the answer is_ in negative
(iii) DTAA are mechanism of avoiding multiplicity of taxation
globally of an assessee. Therefore, if in the country of residence
taxes are chargeable then the assessee must not suffer the tax
burden in the country of source of income. We have referred to
the balance sheet of Cairn UK Holding Ltd which is at page No.
261 of the paper Book submitted by the assessee wherein note
NO. 6 itself suggests that the appellant has not provided for any

tax in respect of disposal of the part of the company’s

investment in its subsidiaries as the disposal is exempt from tax
under Schedule 7AC of the Taxation of changeable gain Act 1992
of United Kingdom. (iv) Coming to the decision of the Hon'ble
Delhi High Court in case of DIT Vs. New Skies Satellite BV
wherein the Hon'ble High court has held that in relation to
applicability of Article 3(2) of the relevant DTAAs, that it can
apply only to terms not defined in the DTAA. Since the relevant
DTAAs in the case before them defined “royalty”, Article 3(2)
could not be applied. For terms which are defined under the
DTAA, there is no need to refer to the laws in force in the
Contracting States, especially to deduce the meaning of the
definition under the DTAA. Further, the court has held that
neither act of parliament supply or alter the boundaries of DTAA
or supply redundancy to any part of its. Similarly, according to
us, the provisions of DTAA where it simply provides that
particular income would be chargeable to tax in accordance with
the provisions of domestic laws , such article in DTAA also
cannot the limit the boundaries of domestic tax laws. In view of
this, we do not find any force in the argument of the assessee

and dismiss ground No. 3.12 of the appeal.

In the result ground No. 3 with all its sub grounds are dismissed.

In ground No. 4 of the appeal the assessee has challenged certain
findings recorded by the Id AO, such as certain violations of regulatory
requirements, non disclosure of certain facts and availability of all facts
before the Id AO irrespective of action u/s 133 of the Act. No specific
arguments were made before us by both the parties on these issues
and we also find them irrelevant to decide the issue in appeal. Hence,
we dismiss ground No. 4 of the appeal.

Ground No 5 of the appeal of the assessee is against the levy of
interest u/s 234A and 234 B of the Act. The LD AR submitted on this

issue as under :-

2. Appellants submission against the said contentions
Levy of interest under section 234A and 234B of the Act is
bad in law

2.1. As discussed in the earlier submissions, it is only on
account of the retrospective amendment introduced by the
Finance Act. 2012 in section 9(1 )(i) of the Act vide
Explanation 4 and 5 Thai the transfer of shares of foreign
company incorporated outside India is chargeable to tax in
India.

2.2. However in the instant case, the Appellant had
undertaken the internal reorganization in AY 2007-08 and
Section 9(1 )(i) of The Act then prevailing, provided that
income deemed to accrue or arise in India shall be ...income
accruing or arising, whether directly or indirectly, through
teeee transfer of a capital asset situate in India. As per the law
prevailing at that point in time, income accrued on account of
transfer of shares of CIHL, i.e. foreign company was not
chargeable to tax in India. The said interpretation was also

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

>age | 155

upheld by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in the case of
Vodafone International Holdings B.V v UOI & Another [2012]
341 ITR 1 (SC).

2.3. As the Appellant had no income chargeable to tax in
India and the Appellant was not liable to file a return of
income in India in accordance with the law prevailing in India
for the AY 2007-08, interest under section 234A and 234B of
the Act cannot be levied. Furthermore, no new documents
were discovered by the survey proceedings in January 2014 -
all of the documents in question had been in the hands of the
government in 2006. The reason that no tax was levied in
2006 was that the transactions in question were not taxable
in 2006 - the only arguable basis for taxing them (which
Appellant in any event rejects) arose in 2012 with the
passage of the retrospective amendment. This has been
confirmed by distinguished governmental commissions.

2.4. The Appellant submits that in the instant case, the
legal dictum /ex non cogit ad impossibillia would be attracted
which in simple terms means that ‘law cannot compel to do
the impossible'.In this regard, the Appellant relies on the
following judicial precedents:

a. In case of CIT v. Revathi Equipment Limited. [2008]
298 ITR 67 (Mad.), wherein the Madras High Court held that.
"eeeeee Normally, new provisions are introduced with effect
from the next assessment year, but this provision under
section 35DDA was introduced by Parliament in its wisdom
with effect from April 1, 2001, ie., the same year and that is
why difficulty has arisen for visualizing the liability and the
assessee could not deduct such expenditure. In fact in
almost identical circumstances in the Third Member decision
by the Delhi Bench in the case of Haryana Warehousing
Corporation v. Deputy CIT [2001] 252 ITR (AT) 34 it was
held that in such situations the legal dictum lex non cogit ad
impossibillia would be attracted. The simple meaning of this
dictum is that ‘law cannot compel you to do the impossible’.
In the case before us also, the assessee could not have
visualized till the last instalment of advance tax, i.e., March
15, 2001, that it would not be entitled to deduct the VRS
payments. Therefore, the assessee could not have done
anything other than to estimate the liability to pay advance
tax on the basis of existing provisions. We are oj the

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

Page |156

considered opinion that in such situation, it cannot he said
that the assessee was liable to pay advance tax. Once we
come to the conclusion that the assessee was not liable to
pay advance tax, there is no question of charging tax under
sections 234B and 234C. In similar circumstances in the case
of Priyanka Overseas Ltd. v. Deputy CIT [2001] 79 ITD 353
(Delhi) where the assessee had treated the receipt of cash
assistance as capital receipts, which was subsequently
amended to be business receipt by the Finance Act, 1990, it
was held that in such cases interest under sections 234B and
234C was not chargeable. In these circumstances, we think
that the assessee was not liable to pay advance tax and
therefore levy of interest under sections 234B and 234C is
not justified. Further, it is pertinent to note that the assessee
by way of abundant caution deposited a sum ofRs. 90,00,000
on August 6, 2001. i.e.. much before the due date of filing of
the return, which also proves the bonafide credentials of the
assessee. In these circumstances, we set aside the order of
the learned Commissioner of Income-tax (Appeals) and
delete the levy of interest under sections 234B and234C."

From a reading of the above, it is clear that the Tribunal had
taken a view that the Finance 5/77 introduced was passed in
both the Houses of Parliament, receiving the assent of the
hon'ble President of India, on May 11, 2001. Till that time,
the assessee could not have visualized that the individual
liability would be fastened on him. It is also found by the
Tribunal that the assessee fairly deposited a sum of Rs.
90,00,000 by way of self-assessment on August 6. 2001,
before the date of filing the return which also proved the
bona fide credentials of the assessee. On the above two
grounds, the Tribunal accepted the case of the assessee that
the assessee is not subject to advance tax. Findings given by
the Tribunal are based on valid materials and evidence and
we do not find any error or legal infirmity in the order of the
Tribunal so as to warrant interference. "

b. In case of Ashok Leyland Ltd. v. DOT [2014] 47
taxmann.com 414 (Chennai. Trib), it was held that, "14. The
third issue raised by the assessee on merit is that the
Commissioner of Income Tax (Appeals) has erred in
confirming the levy of interest under Sections 234B and

 

Cairn U K Holdings Limited V DCIT ( International Taxation) New Delhi
ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

http://www. itatonline.org

>age | 157

234C, which were worked out on the basis of the tax
determined in the income escaping assessment. We are
inclined to allow this ground raised by the assessee. The
Hon'ble Madras High Court in the case of CIT v. Revathi
Equipment Ltd. [2008] 298 ITR 67 has held that when an
assessee could not have foreseen liability caused on account
of a subsequent legislative amendment, the assessee cannot
be liable for interest on the differential amount of tax in the
reason that the assessee could no! have paid the differential
amount of tax for the relevant previous year. Here also, the
income escaping assessment was passed because of the
retrospective amendment brought in by Finance Act, 2009,
The additional liability has been generated only in the
assessment. It was not possible for the assessee to foresee
the retrospective amendment. So, it was not possible for the
assessee to pay advance tax for the relevant previous year
against the differential demand of tax that would arise in
future. Therefore, we delete the liability of interest made
under Section 234B and 234C of the Income-tax Act, 1961.

c. Further the following judicial precedents have also
upheld that where it is not possible for the Appellant to
foresee the retrospective amendment, it was not possible for
the Appellant to pay advance tax for the relevant previous
year against the demand of tax that would arise in future.
Considering the same, interest under section 234A and 234B
cannot be levied:

. JWS Steel Limited v. AC1T [2010] 5 ITR (Trib.) 31
(Bang.) . -

e United Helicharters (P.) Ltd. v. ACIT [2013] 37
taxmann.com 343 (Mum-Trib)

. Sivagami Holdings (P.) Ltd. v. ACIT [2012] 20
taxamm.com 166 (Chennai)

d. From the above judicial precedents, it is very clear
that when any tax liability imposed on the Assessees on
account of retrospective amendment which cannot be
foreseen at the time of filing of return of income, interest
under section 234A and 234B of the Act cannot be levied on
the Appellant.

ITA No 1669/Del/2016
AY 2007-08

| 158

2.5. Without prejudice to above, the Appellant submits that
interest under section 234A cannot bd levied for the period
during which it was not possible on Appellant's part to file
return of income. Which means, the interest, if any, could be
levied only for the period for which the Appellant is permitted
to file the return of income. In the extant case, without
accepting the default of non-filing of return of income, even
if Appellant is construed to be in default, the interest undef
section 234A of the Act could be levied only for the period for
which the Appellant is permitted to file the return of income
i.e. 2 years. Just to explain it clearly, for the AY 2007-08,
even if the Appellant could have filed the return of income,
statutory time limit as per section 139 of the Act, was 31
March 2009. i.e. one year from the end of the assessment
year. Beyond 31 March 2009, as per the law the Appellant
was not able to file return of income. Even the Income-tax
department's infrastructure could not have allowed the
Appellant to file return of income.

2.6. In relation to above, the Appellant reliance is placed
on the case of Ms. Priti Pithwala v. ITO [2003] 129 taxman
79 (Mum.) (Mag) (SMC), it was held that:

"9. With a view to simplify the procedure, which had led to
litigation and consequent delay in realization of dues, the
Amending Act, 1987, has substituted the aforesaid provisions
by a simple scheme of payment of mandatory interest for
defaults mentioned therein. The aforesaid provisions
provides that where a return of income is furnished after the
due date or is not furnished, the assessee shall pay simple
interest at the rate of one and one-fourth per cent for every
month, or part of a month comprised in the period of default
on the amount of tax on total income determined on regular
assessment, as reduced by any advance tax paid or tax
deducted at source. As such, the word "regular assessment"
is used in the context of computation. It does not say that
the order passed under section 143(3)1144 of the Act shall
be substituted by section 147 of the Act. In terms of section
234A(I)(a)( b), the period for which the interest liability is
calculated is the period between the date on which the return
was due to be filed and ending on the date the same is
actually furnished and when no return is furnished ending on

AY 2007-08

Page |159

the date of completion of the assessment under section 144
of the Act.

10. In the present case the assessees did not furnish the
returns. As such, the case of the assessees is not coming
within the ambit of section 234A(I)(a) of the Act.

11. Section 234A(I)(b ) of the Act contemplates the situation
where no return has been furnished. In such a case the
period prescribed is ending on the date of completion of the
assessment under section 144 of the Act. In the present case
the assessments under section 144 were not completed. As
such, section 234A(I)(b) cannot be applied.

12. The aforesaid two conditions deals with the period for
which interest is to be charged. Once the period is
ascertained, the amount is to be fixed. The section prescribes
the modus of computation. It is to be computed on the
amount of the tax on the total income as determined under
subsection (I) of section 143 or on regular assessment as
reduced by the advance tax. if any, paid and any tax
deducted or collected at source. Explanation 3 is inserted for
the sake of clarification. An Explanation may cover a word, a
phrase or a concept. It brings out what is implicit in a word
or phrase. Nothing more. Therefore, it cannot be said that
Explanation 3 hasgot anything to do with the computation of
period for the calculation of interest. It is relatable to the
computation part of the interest.

13. Since the learned counsel for the assessees conceded his
liability to pay interest under section 234A of the Act, there
is no point in going further into that matter and to examine
whether interest is leviable or not.

14. The only dispute posed before me pertains’ to the period
for which the interest is to be charged. The contention of the
learned counsel was that the assessees should not be made
liable to pay interest for the period during which it was not
possible on their part to file the returns. Having regard to the
facts of the present case and considering the precedents
relied upon; I find sufficient force in the contention of the
learned counsel on this aspect. I direct the Assessing Officer
to recompute the interest in the light of the aforesaid
discussion. Accordingly on this aspect I set aside the
impugned orders and restore the matter to the file of
Assessing Officer, with direction to make fresh computation,

after providing adequate opportunity to the assessees of
being heard.

2.7. Further the following judicial precedents have also
upheld that interest under section 234A cannot be levied for
the whole period but restricted to the period for the Appellant
is permitted to file return of income under the Act:

. ITO v. Capt. H.R. Vinayak [2006] 9 SOT 322 (Mum.)

2.8. The learned AO has erred in incorrectly following the
directions of the DRP without providing any opportunity of
being heard to the Appellant.

2.9. Without prejudice to above, the Appellant wishes to
submit that the DRP in its directions observed that where a
"clear cut finding of fact’, duly supported by relevant
commercial contract clauses or other documentary evidence
from where an inference or presumption could be drawn that
Appellant had represented to the payer to deduct tax at a
lower rate and that a case is also made out on "equities that
need to be balanced in those peculiar facts" only then section
234B may be levied and the learned AO was directed to give
clear finding regarding this in the extant case of the
Appellant. The learned AO neither provided any opportunity
to the Appellant to provide any facts or details nor submitted
any clear findings in this regard to substantiate the above
direction of DRP. The learned AO held in the FAO that
interest under section 234B is mandatory and hence levied,
which is not a satisfactory compliance of the directions
provided by the DRP.

2.10. Considering the above facts, the Appellant humbly
submits before your Honors members to direct the learned
AO to delete the interest under section 234B as directed
even by the DRP as well.

2.11. Without prejudice of the above, interest under section
234B is payable on account of short fall and default in
payment of Advance tax. Under section 209(I)(d) of the Act,

the Income-tax calculated on the estimated current income
of the Appellant is to be reduced by the Income-tax which
would be ‘deductible’ at source. The Appellant submits that
as it is a non-resident, under the provisions of section 195 of
the Act, its entire income is subject to deduction of tax at
source and the person responsible for making payment to
the Appellant is obliged to deduct tax there from. In view of
the same, entire income of the Appellant is tax deductible in
India. Hence, there would be no liability, on the part of the
Appellant to pay advance tax and, consequently, interest
under section 234B of the Act are not applicable to the
Appellant.

2.12. In this regard, reliance is placed on the following
judicial precedents:

e DIT v GE Packaged Power Inc [2015] 56 taxmann.com
190 (Del HC)

"For the above reasons, this Court finds that no interest is
leviable on the respondent, assessees under Section 234B,
even though they filed returns declaring NIL income at the
stage of reassessment. The payers were obliged to
determine whether the assessees wer& liable to tax under
Section 195(1), and to what extent, by taking recourse to
the mechanist provided in Section 195(2) of the Act. The
failure of the payers to do so does not leave the. Revenue
without remedy: the payer may be regarded an assessee-in-
default under Sectioti 20 J. and the consequences delineated
in that provision will visit the payer. The appeal of the
Revenue is accordingly dismissed without any order as to
costs."

e DIT v.NGC Network Asia LLC [2009] 222 CTR 85 (Bom)
"8. We are in respectful agreement with the view taken In
the case ofCITv. Sedco Forex International Drilling Co. Ltd.
(supra), by the Uttaranchal High Court. We are clearly of the
opinion that when a duty is cast on the payer to pay the tax
at source, on failure, no interest can be imposed on the
payee assessee.

9. Considering the submissions of both parties and the
provisions of law, consequently the appeal is dismissed."

2.13. Further, post decision of Alcatel in the following
decisions various tribunals have ruled in favour of the
Appellant:

e ZTE Corporation v. ADIT (2016) 70 taxmann.com 1
(Delhi - Tribunal)

¢ Satellite Television Asian Region Ltd. v. DDIT (2016)
66 taxmann.com 247 (Mumbai - Trib.)

* Kawasaki Heavy Industries Ltd. v. ACIT (2016) 67
taxmann.com 47 (Delhi - Trib.)

2.14. The ratio of above rulings clearly suggest that since
the tax is deductible at source on all the payments made to
the Appellant, there is no liability on the Appellant to pay
advance tax . In absence of any liability to pay advance tax
by the Appellant, interest under section 234B of the Act
should not be levied on the Appellant.

2.15. Without prejudice to the above, interest under section
234A and 234B cannot be levied on the basis of the
retrospective amendment. In this regard, reliance is placed
on the following judicial precedents:

e Deversons (P.) Ltd. v. Chairman, Central Board of Direct
Taxes [2004] 140 TAXMAN 628 (GUJ.)

"7. Although the above observations were in the context of
levy of additional tax under section 143(1A), the same
reasoning would apply in the matter of waiver of interest
under section 234B of the Act. On the date when the
assessee was required to pay advance tax and even on the
date of filing of the return, the assessee could not have been
expected to pay tax on the Export Cash Assistance received
by him in the year ended 31-3-1989 nor to show the same
as income in the return filed on 29-12-1989. It was after
expiry of the assessment year that there was a statutory

amendment with retrospective _effect_making Export Cash”
Assistance _as taxable with effect from 1-4-1967, Under the

circumstances, the notification dated 23-5-1996. particularly
para (d) thereof, issued under section 119(2) (a) would be
applicable.

We are, therefore, clearly of the view that the present case
would squarely fall under clause (d) of the aforesaid
notification. Since the petitioner's tax liability arose
subsequently after filing of the return and after expiry of the
assessment year on account of retrospective amendment of
law. consequential levy of interest under section 234B was
clearly required to be dealt with as a fit case for reduction or
waiver of interest. "

. Emanii Ltd. v. Commissioner of Income-tax, Central-I,
Kolkata [2011] 12 taxmann.com 64 (Cal.)

"It appears that the learned Tribunal has not at all
considered the aforesaid aspect as to the liability of the
assessee to make payment of the advance tax on the last
day of the Financial Year. i.e... 31-3-2001 when its book
profit was nil according to the then law of the land. The
various decisions of the other High Courts and the Tribunals
relied upon by the Tribunal did not effectively consider the
question whether even in a case like the present one where
on the last date of the Financial Year preceding the relevant
assessment year, the assessee had no liability to pay
advance tax, he would be nevertheless asked to pay interest
in terms of section 234B and section 234C of the Act for
default in making payment of tax in advance which was
physically impossible. (Para 14) "

"P. Other common issues raised by the assessee in the
present Appeals related to the levy of interest under section
234B and 234C. As regards the levy interest under section
234B, the assessee in the present case is admittedly a Non
Resident in India and its entire income is liable for deduction
of Tax at source. As held by the Hon'ble Bombay High Court
in the case ofDIT (International Taxation) Vs. NGC Network

Asia LLC[2009]313 JTR187(Bombay), when a duty is cast
upon payer to pay tax ats source, on its failure to do so, no
interest can be imposed upon payee Assessee under section
234B. Respectively following the decision of Hon'ble
Jurisdictional High Court, we hold that interest under section
234B cannot be imposed on the Assessee on failure of payer
to deduct tax at source from the payments made to the
Assessee. Moreover the issues relating to levy of under
section 234B and 234C are consequential and the AO is
accordingly directed to allow consequential relief to the
Assessee on these issues. "

2.16. In view of the above, judicial precedents, your Honors
would appreciate that if in the relevant year under
consideration, the Appellant was not required to pay tax as
per the law then prevailing, subsequent retrospective
amendment in law cannot make Appellant liable to pay
advance tax and consequential levy of interest under Section
234A and 234B of the Act.

3. Prayer:

Based on the above submissions and judicial precedents, the
Appellant respectfully prayers before your Honors that
interest levied under section 234 A and 234B of the Act is not
applicable in the case of the Appellant and should be
deleted.”

The Id Departmental Representative relied upon the orders of the Id
Assessing Officer.

We have carefully considered the rival contentions. In the present case
the interest has been charged on the tax payable by the assessee
which has arisen because of retrospective amendment made by The
Finance Act, 2012. Therefore, it is correct on the part of the assessee
to submit that it could not have visualize its liability for payment of

advance in the year of transaction therefore, there cannot be any

interest payable by the assessee u/s 234A and 234B of the Act. the
chargeable of the interest in the present case squarely covered in
favour of the assessee by the decision of Hon'ble Madras High Court in
case of CIT Vs. Rewati Equipment Ltd (2008) 298 ITR 67 and M/s. MRF
Ltd Vs. DCIT TC(Appeal No. 234/2016) dated 04" August 2016.
Further, Hon'ble Delhi High Court also covers issue in favour of the
assessee in DIT Vs. GE Packaged Power Incorporation 373 ITR 65
wherein, it has been held that if tax is required to be deducted on the
income of the non-resident assessee under the provisions of section
195 of the Income Tax Act then no fault can rest on the shoulder of a
non-resident assessee and hence, he cannot be burdened with the
liability of interest u/s 234A, 234B and 234C of the Act. Recently,
Hon'ble Supreme Court in case of Ian Peter Morris Vs. ACIT (2016)
389 ITR 501 has held that when the salary income payable to a non-
resident is subject to tax deduction at source u/s 192 of the Act
question of payment of advance tax do not arise and consequently,
provisions of section 234B and 234C also have no _ obligation.
Admittedly in the present case , the income of nonresident appellant
has become chargeable to tax due to retrospective amendment in the
act and further the payments made to assessee was also subject to

withholding tax u/s 195 of the act and in view of the above judicial

precedents cited before us, we are of the opinion that assessee
cannot be burdened with interest u/s 234A and 234B of the Act on tax
liability arising out of retrospective amendment w.e.f. 01.04.1962 in
the provision of section 9(1) of the Income Tax Act. In the result
ground No. 5 of the appeal of the assessee is allowed.
Ground No. 6 of the appeal is against initiation of penalty proceedings
u/s 271(1) (c) of the Act. No specific arguments were advanced
before us and as such at present only penalty proceedings have
initiated by Id AO. The issue is premature according to us and
therefore ground No. 6 of the appeal is dismissed.
In the result, appeal of the assessee is partly allowed.
Order pronounced in the open court on 09/03/2017.
