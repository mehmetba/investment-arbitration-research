IL. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

1. On 15 May 2017, ICSID received a request for arbitration of the same date from Mabco
against Kosovo, along with exhibits C-1 through C-17 (the “Request’”).

2. On 2 June 2017, the Centre sent a first set of questions to Claimant.

3. On 16 June 2017, Claimant responded by submitting a letter supplementing the Request,
along with additional exhibits C-17! through C-21.

4. On 26 June 2017, ICSID sent a second round of questions to Claimant.

5. On 30 June 2017, the General State Attorney of Kosovo requested that the ICSID
Secretary-General refuse the registration of the Request as being manifestly outside the

jurisdiction of the Centre.

6. On 4 July 2017, the Centre acknowledged receipt of Kosovo’s letter of 30 June 2017 and

reminded Kosovo that:

Pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-
General shall register the Request unless she finds, on the basis of
the information contained in the Request, that the dispute is
manifestly outside the jurisdiction of ICSID. Therefore, the
Secretary-General’s power to consider any objections to a request
for arbitration is limited.
7. On 12 July 2017, Claimant responded to the Centre’s second set of questions and provided

comments on Respondent’s letter of 30 June 2017.

8. On 21 July 2017, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In

the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute

' The Claimant submitted a second part of Exhibit C-17 containing the original text in Albanian.

1

an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of

Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

On 31 July 2017, Claimant made a proposalas to the method of constitution of the Tribunal,
which Respondent accepted on 11 August 2017.

By letter dated 15 August 2018, the Centre noted that the Parties had agreed to constitute
the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, and that the

Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, to be appointed as follows:
1. Each party shall appoint one arbitrator;

2. The two party-appointed arbitrators shall, each in consultation
with the party that nominated him/her, appoint the Chairperson of
the Arbitral Tribunal within 90 days of the registration of the case;

3. None of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal shall be a national
of Switzerland or the Republic of Kosovo;

4. In case the party-appointed arbitrators and the parties cannot
agree on a Chairperson within the above-mentioned time limit, the
Chairperson shall be appointed by the Chairman of the
Administrative Council of ICSID.
On 24 August 2017, Claimant appointed Mr. Gianrocco Ferraro, a national of Italy, as

arbitrator in this case. Mr. Ferraro accepted his appointment on September 5, 2017.

On 20 September 2017, Respondent appointed Professor Dr. August Reinisch, a national
of Austria, as arbitrator in this case. Professor Dr. Reinisch accepted his appointment on

26 September 2017.

On 23 October 2017, the co-arbitrators informed the Parties that they had been unable to
reach an agreement on the presiding arbitrator within the 90-day period set forth in the
Parties’ agreement; and inquired whether the Parties would agree to a 2-week extension

for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator.

On 25 October 2017, Claimant agreed to the extension of the deadline for the appointment

of the presiding arbitrator until 2 November 2017.

22.

On 2 November 2017, the co-arbitrators inquired whether the Parties would agree to a

further 2-week extension.

By correspondence dated 3 and 6 November 2017, the Parties agreed to extend the deadline
for the appointment of the presiding arbitrator. The Centre took note of such agreement on

6 November 2017.

On 15 November 2017, the Centre informed the Parties that the co-arbitrators had
appointed Professor George Bermann, a national of the United States, as the presiding

arbitrator.

On 20 September 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the
Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mr. Francisco Abriani, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 29 November 2017, the Centre requested the Parties to make an initialadvancepayment
by 29 December 2017 in order to cover the cost of the proceeding, in accordance with

ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3).

On 6 December 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would be available to hold
the first session with the Parties by telephone conference on 17 January 2018 and invited
them to confirm their availability on this date. A draft Procedural Order No. 1 was also
circulated, and the Parties were invited to review its content, to agree on as many of the
issues addressed in the draft order as possible, and to submit their comments on the

proposed draft one week before the first session.
On 14 December2017, the Tribunal reiterated its request regarding the Parties’ availability.

On 18 December 2017, Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had initiated settlement
negotiations with Respondent and requested the stay of the proceeding and the extension

of the deadline for the payment of the advance on costs until 31 January 2018.

On 18 December 2017, Respondent informed the Tribunal of its intention to submit an
objection pursuant to Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules for “manifest lack of legal

merits within the deadlines set forth in the aforementioned rule.”

On 19 December 2017, the Tribunal invited Respondent to state, whether it agreed to
Claimant’s request that the proceeding be stayed until 31 January 2018. The Tribunal also
took note of Respondent’s intention to submit an objection pursuant to ICSID Arbitration
Rule 41(5), and reminded the Parties that the deadline to submit an objection pursuant to

Rule 41(5) was “30 days after the constitution of the Tribunal”, i.e. 20 December 2017.

On 22 December 2017, Respondent informed the Tribunal that there had been no official
settlement negotiations initiated to that date and therefore it could not comment on
Claimant’s request to stay the proceeding. Respondent also informed the Tribunal that it
had already filed on 18 December 2017, its objections under Rule 41(5) in hard copy via

express mail delivery.

On 27 December 2017, the Centre acknowledged receipt on 22 December 2017, of one
original hard copy of Kosovo’s Preliminary Objections under Rule 41(5) dated 18
December 2017, (the “Application’”), along with exhibits R-1 through R-10. The Centre
noted that the package did not contain the six additional copies mentioned in Kosovo’s
cover letter. The Centre also attached: (i) a copy of the shipment label which the Centre
received with Kosovo’s package; and (ii) the shipping information provided on the FedEx
website based on the package tracking number. According to these documents,
Respondent’s Application was dispatched on 20 December 2017, and was delivered at the

seat of the Centre on 22 December 2017.

By letter dated 29 December 2017, the Tribunal noted that, absent confirmation by both
Parties that settlement negotiations were underway, the stay of the proceeding as requested
by Claimant could not be granted at that stage. The Tribunal also noted that it appeared
that Respondent’s Application was not “delivered at the seat of the Centre [...] before the
close of business on the indicated date,” as required by ICSID Administrative and Financial
Regulation 29(2). The Tribunal however invited (i) Claimant to provide comments on the

timeliness of Respondent’s Application by 3 January 2018, and (ii) Respondent to respond

to Claimant’s comments, if any, by 5 January 2018. The Tribunal noted that it would then
decide whether it would entertain Respondent’s objections under Rule 41(5). Finally, the
Tribunal confirmed that the deadline to make the initial advance payment requested by the

Centre, was extended until 10 January 2018.

On 3 January 2018, Claimant submitted its comments on Respondent’s Application, to
which the Respondent replied on 4 January 2018. Respondent also requested a deferral of

the first session at least until 1 February 2018.

On 5 January 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not rule on the
timeliness of the Application until the advance on costs was paid and both the Tribunal and
Claimant had received copies of Respondent’s Application along with any attachments.
The Tribunal further invited Claimant to confirm its agreement to the extension of the 60-
day period set forth in ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1) as proposed by Respondent, and
invited both Parties to confirm their availability for a first session on any date during the

week of 5 to 9 February 2018.

By correspondence dated 7 and 9 January 2018, the Parties agreed to the extension of the
60-day period set forth in ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1) and to hold the first session by
telephone conference on 8 February 2018.

On 10 January 2018, the Centre acknowledged receipt of Claimant’s payment of its share
of the initial advance on costs and confirmed that the first session would be held on the

agreed date.

On 16 January 2018, the Centre informed the Parties of the default in the payment of
Respondent’s share of the advance requested, and invited either Party to pay the

outstanding amount by 31 January 2018.

On 17 January 2018, Respondent submitted an electronic copy of the Application via email,
along with exhibits R-1 and R-3 through R-10. Hard copies of the submission were

subsequently delivered to Professor Bermann and Mr. Ferraro.

On 30 January 2018, a draft agenda was circulated to the Parties for the first session.

On 1 and 2 February 2018, Claimant and Respondent, respectively, submitted their
proposed changes to the draft Procedural Order No. 1, indicating the items on which they

agreed as well as their respective positions regarding the items on which they did notagree.

On 7 February 2018, the Tribunal rendered its Decision on Respondent’s Preliminary
Objections under Rule 41(5) of the Arbitration Rules. The Tribunal decided “that
Respondent’s Application is untimely and declines to entertain the Application on the

”2

merits.

On 8 February 2018, the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties by telephone

conference.

On 15 February 2018, the Centre informed the Parties that ICSID’s Secretary-General
would move the Tribunal to stay the proceeding if the outstanding portion of the first

advance had not been received from either Party by 8 March 2018.

On 21 February 2018, Claimant submitted a draft provisional procedural timetable to the

Tribunal.

On the same date, the Tribunal invited Respondent to comment on Claimant’s proposal by

23 February 2018.
On 27 February 2018, Respondent submitted its draft provisional timetable.

On the same date, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of Respondent’s proposed procedural
timetable and reminded the Parties, inter alia, that the proceedings could only go forward

if the balance of the advance payment was paid by either Party.

On 6 March 2018, Claimant provided its comments on Respondent’s draft procedural

timetable.

On 12 March 2018, the Centre informed the Parties that the Tribunal, pursuant to ICSID
Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and the Centre’s motion, had decided to

suspend the proceeding for non-payment of the required advances.

On 14 August 2018, the Secretariat informed the Parties that they had not taken any steps
during five consecutive months, and that, therefore, pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule
45, if no steps were taken by them before 12 September, 2018, the Secretary-General, after

notice to the Parties, would move to discontinue the proceeding.

On 19 September 2018, the proceeding was resumed following Claimant’s payment of the

outstanding balance of the initial advance.

On 5 October 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | recording the agreement
of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the
applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the

November to submit the proposed timetable.

On 16 October 2018, Claimant agreed to the extension of the deadline for the submission

of the proposed timetable until 5 November 2018.

On 17 October 2018, the Tribunal took note of the Parties’ agreement to extend until
5 November 2018, the deadline for the submission of the proposed timetable by the Parties

and therefore granted the extension upon consent.

On 5 November 2018, both Parties submitted their respective proposed procedural
timetable, informing the Tribunal that they had not been able to agree on a joint procedural

timetable.

On 12 November 2018, the Tribunal transmitted the procedural timetable to the Parties.

Tribunal and requested the Tribunal to adjust it in accordance with the revised timetable

then submitted by Claimant.

On 15 November 2018, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit an agreed timetable by
22 November 2018, or their respective positions for the Tribunal to issue a new timetable

taking into account their respective views, absent an agreement between the Parties.

On 22 November 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they could not reach an

each other and the Tribunal which witnesses and experts of the opposing party it intends to
cross-examine at the hearing is 20 September 2019; and (iv) proposed that the conference
call scheduled for 18 September 2019, be cancelled and that it take place instead on
23 September 2019.

On 31 July 2019, Claimant confirmed its availability for a pre-hearing organizational
meeting on the proposed date while Respondent confirmed its availability on 5 August

2019.

On 15 August 2019, the Tribunal confirmed that the pre-hearing organizational meeting
would take place on 23 September 2019. The Tribunal also circulated a draft agenda and
invited the Parties to confer and submit their comments, indicating their points of

agreement and their respective positions on the points of disagreement.

On 23 August 2019, Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, along
with the witness statement of Mr. Shkelzen Lluka dated 23 August 2019, the witness
statement of Mr. Ahmet Shala dated 20 August 2019,? exhibits R-020 through R-046,

On 2 September 2019, Claimant requested an extension of the deadline for its Rejoinder
on Jurisdiction and Admissibility until 19 September 2019, to which the Respondent
objected on 5 September 2019.

On 11 September 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that Claimant’s request for an

extension of 2 September 2019 was granted.

On 12 September 2019, Respondent provided comments concerning the Tribunal’s
decision to grant extension requested by Claimant and informed the Tribunal that it
intended to request the postponement of the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility.

Claimant provided its comments on Respondent’s request on the same date.

On 13 September 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that in order to assess the
Respondent’s request, it would be relevant to know whether Claimant intended to submit
new witnesses or experts with its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, and therefore

invited Claimant to disclose this information by 16 September 2019.

On 16 September 2019, Claimant agreed to a postponement of the hearing on jurisdiction
and admissibility. Claimant indicated, however, that its next available dates for a hearing
were 30 Octoberto 1 November 2019, and therefore requested an extension of the deadline
to submit its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility until 27 September 2019.

Respondent provided its comments on Claimant’s request on the same date.

On 16 September 2019, the Tribunal confirmed that the deadline for the filing of the
Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility was 19 September 2019, and that the hearing
on jurisdiction and admissibility would take place on 2-4 October 2019. The Tribunal
further invited Claimant to answer its question regarding new witnesses. Finally, the
Tribunal advised the Parties that, should it become necessary to postpone the hearing, and
subject to finding a hearing room available in Paris, the Tribunal would be available to

reschedule it for 6-8 November 2019, with 9 November in reserve.

On 17 September 2019, Claimant responded the Tribunal’s inquiry of 16 September 2019.

Claimant made further comments on Respondent’s request and requested, inter alia, that:

In any case, if the Tribunal decides to keep the hearing dates, the
Claimant in its preparation of the Rejoinder having severely been
jeopardized by the Respondent's procedural conduct submitting an
unfair and ambiguous procedural request to which the Respondent
has to respond on a daily basis losing a significant amount of time,
the Claimant requests to submit its Rejoinder on Friday 20, 2019.
The Claimant, however, offers to submit its Witness Statements
before that date, if the Tribunal so requires.

On the same date, Respondent proposed that, in light of the extension until 19 September
granted to Claimant, the date for the Parties comments on the draft agenda be set to
25 September 2019 and that the pre-hearing organizational meeting take place on
25 September 2019. The Respondent also proposed that the new date for the Parties’

notification of witnesses to be heard be set for 24 September 2019.

On 18 September 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the one-day extension for
the filing of Claimant’s Rejoinder was granted, that the hearing dates were maintained, and
thatif the hearing were to be postponed, the only practicable dates were the early November

dates provided by the Tribunal.

On 20 September 2019, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility,
along with the second witness statement of Mr. Pacolli dated 20 September 2019, the
witness statement of Mr. Remzi Ejupi dated 20 September 2019 and the witness statement
of Ms. Lucina Maesani-Gaiatto dated 18 September 2019, exhibits C-045 to C-075, and
legal authorities CL-019 to CL-049 (the “Rejoinder”).

On 21 September 2019, Claimant informed the Tribunal of its agreement with

Respondent’s suggested extensions of the various deadlines.

On 22 September 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the pre-hearing
organizational meeting was postponed until 25 September 2019 upon agreement of the

Parties.

On 24 September 2019, Respondent requested, inter alia, that the hearing be postponed,

while Claimant suggested to discuss this during the pre-hearing organizational meeting.

On the same date, the Parties also submitted their comments on the draft agenda for the
pre-hearing organizational meeting as well as their respective lists of participants for the
pre-hearing organizational meeting, and notified the witnesses that they wish to cross-
examine at the hearing. In its notification, Respondent noted, inter alia, that it “[did] not
request the presence of any of the Claimant’s witnesses at the oral hearing, because the
written witness testimony does not contain statements of sufficient precision to be tested

by oral interrogation.”

On 25 September 2019, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the

Parties by telephone conference.

On 27 September 2019, Respondent, on behalf of the Parties, asked the Tribunal to
formally confirm the postponement of the hearing, which the Tribunal did on the same
date. The Tribunal also indicated to the Parties that it would revert to them regarding the

available dates to hold the hearing in late November 2019.

On the same date, Respondent informed the Tribunal that “as discussed during the pre-
hearing organizational meeting, the Parties [had] conferred and reached an agreement on
items 1.2., 1.5.,2.3., 3.3. and4 of the Agenda” and submitted their proposed wordings for

those items. Claimant confirmed its agreement on the same date.

On 30 September 2019, the Tribunal proposed that the hearing on jurisdiction and
admissibility be rescheduled for 25-26 November 2019, in Paris, and invited the Parties to

confirm their availability on the proposed dates.

On 1 October 2019, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was not available on the
proposed dates due to other engagements, and that its earliest period of availability would
be 16-20 December 2019. On the same date, Claimant confirmed its availability during the
week of 16-20 December 2019, but proposed that the hearing be rescheduled for 17-18

December 2019 due to travel arrangements.

On | October 2019, Respondent requested that the Tribunal confirm that the Parties were
requested to observe the 14-day deadline after the last submission (i.e. 4 October 2019) for

the notification of the witnesses to be cross-examined at the hearing.

On 7 October 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it preferred to hold the hearing
on 11-12 November 2019.

On the same date, Claimant indicated that it would not be available to hold the hearing on

the proposed dated but proposed to hold the hearing in Zurich on 12-13 November 2019.

On 8 October 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning the
organization of the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility, and reiterated its invitation to
Respondent to confirm its availability to hold the hearing on 12-13 November 2019 and to

indicate whether it would be agreeable to hold the hearing in Zurich.

On 9 October 2019, Respondent informed the Tribunal that it was not available on the
proposed dates and reiterated that both Parties, and their witnesses, were available during

the week from 16 to 20 December 2019.

On the same date, Claimant confirmed that it did not intend to cross-examine Mr. Lluka

and made some comments regarding Procedural Order No. 3.

On 10 October 2019, the Tribunal circulated an amended version of Procedural Order

No. 3.

On 22 October 2019, the Tribunal invited the Parties to confirm their availability to hold
the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility on 23-24 January 2020 at the World Bank in

Paris.

On 30 October 2019, following the Parties’ confirmations of 23 and 25 October 2019, the
Tribunal confirmed that the hearing on jurisdiction and admissibility would be held on 23-

24 January 2020 at the World Bank in Paris.
On 14 November 2019, the Claimants requested the Tribunal to:

witness testimony does notcontain statements of sufficient precision
to be tested by oral interrogation” before the Tribunal makes a
decision on whether the Claimant’s witness statements contain
statements of sufficient precision and

(ii) to inform the Parties whether the Tribunal wishes to question
Mr. Lluka not called upon by the Claimant for cross-examination.

On 21 November 2019, the Tribunal invited Claimant to confirm that it: (i) intended to
cross-examine M. Shala; (ii) did not intend to cross-examine Mr. Lluka; and (iii)
anticipated no further cross-examination. The Tribunal also informed the Parties that it did
not require that Mr. Lluka appear at the hearing for examination. The Tribunal further
invited Claimant to comment on Respondent’s 24 September 2019 contention that the
witness statements of Claimant’s witnesses Mr. Pacolli, Mr. Ejupi and Ms. Maesani-
Gaiatto were of insufficient precision to allow cross-examination. Finally, the Tribunal
asked Respondent to confirm that: (i) in the event that the Tribunal find those statements
to be sufficient, it intended to cross-examine all those witnesses; and (ii) it anticipated no

further cross-examination.

On 28 November 2019, Claimant responded to the questions that the Tribunal asked on
21 November 2019.

On 29 November 2019, the Tribunal gave Respondent the opportunity to reply to the
Tribunal’s questions by 2 December 2019.

On 2 December 2020, Respondent: (i) confirmed its intent to cross-examine Messrs.
Pacolli and Ejupi, and Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto; and (ii) informed the Tribunal that it was

coordinating with Mr. Shala whether he was able to appear in person at the hearing.

By letter dated 2 December 2020, the Tribunal noted that it found the witness statements
of Mr. Pacolli, Mr. Ejupi and Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto of sufficient precision to allow for
cross-examination and that Respondent anticipated no further cross-examination at the
hearing. The Tribunal further urged Respondent to do everything possible to enable
Mr. Shala to appear in person at the hearing.

references to particular documents that support the answer to that

3. The Tribunal would welcome any observations on the temporal
applicability of the BIT and the Kosovo foreign investment law to
the present dispute.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

In this Section, the Tribunal provides an account of the history of the dispute. The Parties
are in agreement on the majority of facts and circumstances reported here. Where a
pertinent fact is alleged by one party and disputed by the other, that will be briefly

indicated.

Claimant, Mabco, initiated the present proceedings against Kosovo over a dispute arising
out of the privatization and ownership of the Grand Hotel, a major hotel in Pristina,
Kosovo. Claimant brought its proceedings under both the Agreement between the Swiss
Confederation and the Republic of Kosovo on the Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments, which entered into force on 13 June 2012 (“the BIT”)* and Kosovo’s Law
on Foreign Investment. Due to the fact that claims asserted in this proceeding do not all
have the same dates of accrual, certain of them are subject to the Foreign Investment Law
No. 02/L-33, enacted on 21 November 2005 and entering into force upon promulgation by
the Special Representative of the United Nations Secretary-General in April 2006 (hereinafter
“2005 Foreign Investment Law”), and others are subject to the Foreign Investment Law

No. 04/L-220, which entered into force on 24 January 2014 (hereinafter “2014 Foreign

Investment Law’”).5 As appropriate, all references to the Foreign Investment Law will

indicate the applicable version. Claimant selected ICSID as the administering institution.

Claimant asserts that Respondent violated its obligations under both the BIT and the
Foreign Investment Law, primarily by unlawful expropriation of Claimant’s property,

denial of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice.®

By way of relief, Claimant requests compensation in the amount of EUR 4m, while
reserving the right to adjust that amount going forward.’ During the course of the
proceedings Claimantstated that itnot only lost its EUR 4m investment in the Grand Hotel,
butalso lost benefits of ownership of the shares it claims to have acquired, without however

quantifying that loss.

PRIVATIZATION AND THE TENDER OF SHARES IN THE GRAND HOTEL

The KTA, and thereafter the PAK, conducted the privatization of Kosovo’s SOEs through
a Special Spin-Off Privatization Procedure!! that entailed the creation of anew company
(hereinafter “NewCo”), to which an SOE’s assets were transferred, followed by a public
tender for bids for purchase of the NewCo’ s assets. The formal name of the NewCo holding

the Grand Hotel as an asset was the NewCo Grand Hotel L.L.C.

24

161.

163.

164.

Under the Special Spin-Off Rules adopted on 20 December 2005, the buyer of an asset was
obligated to maintain operation of the enterprise, while at the same time investing in it a
prescribed level of capital and retaining a minimum number of employees for a minimum
period of time following conclusion of the purchase agreement. These obligations were
spelled out in a commitment agreement annexed to the purchase agreement. Under a
commitment agreement, the KTA had a share call option, i.e., a right of withdrawal of
shares, in the event of non-compliance with the Special Spin-Off Privatization Procedure

obligations.

On 1 September 2005, the PAK issued a tender for bids, due in February 2006, for purchase
of the Grand Hotel. Among the bidders, and the eventual awardee, was UTC, which had
submitted a bid of EUR 8,160,000.00.!2 The award was announced in early April 2006.

AGREEMENT AMONG CO-OWNERS

Under the Tender Rules, UTC, as successful bidder, was required to deposit the purchase
price in the KTA’s designated escrow account within 20 days ofnotificationof the award.!3
According to Claimant, '!4 UTC did not have sufficient funds to purchase the shares of the

Grand Hotel for the bid price.

Accordingto Mr. Remzi Ejupi, in or around January 2006, Mr. Ahmet Shala contacted him
asking that he and Mr. Pacolli participate as bidders in the tender process. Mr. Pacolli
declined to do so, but Mr. Ejupi did make a bid, though he did not win. !5 Mr. Ejupi further
testified that Mr. Shala later contacted him again, informing him that the final winner of
the bid, Mr. Zelqif Berisha, did not have sufficient funds to pay the purchase price for the
Grand Hotel or to fulfill the commitments associated with the privatization, andaskinghim
to convince Mr. Pacolli to join him in investing in the hotel.!° Mr. Pacolli testified that Mr.

Shala’s reason for doingso was the need to avoid annulment of the procedure, which would

necessitate a retendering.'’ Also, according to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala was concerned that
having to launch a retendering process would reflect badly on the KTA, which already had
a poor reputation.'8 Further, according to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala assured him that he would
take care of everything and see to it that the shares were distributed in accordance with the

investors’ participation in the purchase price.!9

165. According to Mr. Pacolli, he then received a call from Mr. Ejupi informing him that
Mr. Shala had indeed sought to convince him to participate in lending UTC financial
support, and to enlist Mr. Pacolli in that enterprise.2° Mr. Ejupi recalls telling Mr. Pacolli
on that call that Mr. Berisha, whom Mr. Pacolli did notknow, wasa good businessperson,”!
and that Mr. Shala assured him that the purchase would be formalized and the shares
tegistered.?? Although Mr. Pacolli did not know Mr. Berisha, the prospect of investing in,
and renovating, a hotel as prestigious as the Grand Hotel, and thereby boosting tourism in

Kosovo, was attractive to him.3

166. Mr. Pacolli testified that there followed a meeting in Vienna with Messrs. Berisha and
Ejupi at which Mr. Berisha told him that he had already paid EUR 500,000 as a deposit for
being admitted to the tender but could not afford to pay the balance of the total price of
about EUR 8m. At that meeting, Messrs. Berisha, Ejupi and Pacolli decided by oral
agreement, allegedly as representatives of their respective companies, that they would
purchase the Grand Hotel shares, with Claimantand NTSH contributing EUR 4m and EUR
1m, respectively, to the purchase of the Grand Hotel. They did so on the understanding that

Mr. Berisha would manage the project for a period of two years and that he, Mr. Pacolli,

would make the investments to fulfill the owners’ commitments.” Mr. Ejupi supports this

account.?5

At any extraordinary meeting, the Claimant’s shareholders then approved the deal.”° It was
understood that, while Mr. Pacolli owned Mabetex, it was Mabetex’s affiliate Mabco, in

whose specialization, construction, the project fell.27

Mr. Pacolli testified that the arrangement was known to the KTA and to Mr. Shala in
particular.’ Mr. Ejupi testified that, during the year 2006, he had three meetings with Mr.

Shala, all on the subject of his and Mr. Pacolli’s participation. 2°

However, Mr. Shala testified that any suggestion that he invited or encouraged Messrs.
Pacolli or Ejupi to invest in the Grand Hotel is untrue.*° He denied inviting or encouraging
any potential investor to do so.*! He added that no one could qualify as a buyer of a

privatized NewCo without participating in the tender process.

TRANSFER OF CAPITAL

Pursuant to the agreement among Messrs. Pacolli, Ejupi and Berisha, Claimant transferred
EUR 4m to NTSH,?2 which forwarded the sum of EUR 4,000,600.00 that sum to UTC,33
which in turn paid the bid amount of EUR 8,160,000.00, including 4,011,000 EUR as

Claimant’s share, into the escrow account designated by the KTA. According to Claimant,

all of these transfers occurredon a single day, 28 April 2006.34(As explained below, paras.
353-355, infra, the payment did not proceed smoothly, but was ultimately received.)
According to Claimant, these arrangements enabled UTC, as winner of the tender, to enter
into an Agreement for the “Sale of Ordinary Shares in Grand Hotel” (hereinafter
“Purchase Agreement”) on 10 August 2006, whereby the SOE Sloga formally undertook
to sell the shares of Grand Hotel to UTC.**

Much controversy surrounds the EUR 4m payment. Claimant affirms that the EUR 4m
payment incontrovertibly represents Claimant’s contribution to the purchase of the Grand
Hotel shares. Respondent disagrees, arguing that the record contains no proper
documentation of the circumstances of, or reasons for, the transfer,*® though the wire
transfers mentioned, respectively, “Agreement”>’ and “Payment under the Contract.”38
The details of the Parties’ competing understandings of the EUR 4m transfer are examined

below (paras. 362-370, infra).

On 3 August 2006, shortly before the Purchase Agreement was signed on 10 August 2006,
Mr. Pacolli committed to providing to UTC’s bank a guarantee as required under the
Commitment Agreement attached to the Purchase Agreement.?? The guarantee, in the

amount of EUR 20.2m was actually given on 21 March 2012.4°

PURCHASE AGREEMENT

On 10 August 2006, the KTA on behalf of SOE Sloga and the Grand Hotel then issued a

Declaration of Transfer, providing for the transfer of the real property and other rights of
the Grand Hotel to Grand Hotel L.L.C., (hereinafter “Grand Hotel”)*! shares of which

became the object of the present dispute.

On the same day, a purchase agreement for the shares in the Grand Hotel was signed by

the KTA on behalf of the SOE Sloga and Mr. Berisha on behalf of UTC. *?

Article 5.1.3 of the Purchase Agreement provided:

The Buyer is purchasing the Shares for its own use and not as an
agent for a third party and, during the tender for this company, the
Buyer has not formed any informal or formal undisclosed
agreements or consortiums between two or more bidders or with
any undisclosed third party.

Attached to the Purchase Agreement was a Commitment Agreement (hereinafter

“Commitment Agreement”) among Mr. Berisha on behalf of UTC, KTA on behalf of

SOE Sloga and the Grand Hotel LLC. It contained the following stipulations:

a.

UTC committed, pursuant to para. 2 of the Commitment Agreement, to invest a
minimum of EUR 20,200,000.00 as capital by the end of the commitment period, ie.
two years after the entry into force of the Commitment Agreement (“Commitment
Period”).

UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.1.1 of the Commitment Agreement, to employ a
minimum of 270 full-time employees six months after entry into force of the
Commitment Agreement.

UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.1.2 of the Commitment Agreement, to maintain
the number of 270 employees for a period of twelve months after the entry into force
of the Commitment Agreement.

UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.2.1 of the Commitment Agreement, to employ
minimum 540 full-time employees twelve months after the entry into force of the
Commitment Agreement.

e. UTC committed, pursuant to para. 3.2.2 of the Commitment Agreement, to maintain
the number of 540 employees to the end of the Commitment Period.

177. Paragraph 6.2 of the Commitment Agreement gave the KTA an option to purchase the
entire issued share capital of Grand Hotel LLC in the event of UTC’s failure to honor its

commitments under the Commitment Agreement.

178. On 13 October 2006, the shares in the Grand Hotel were transferred to UTC, which
thereupon became the owner of the Grand Hotel, together with all the assets and rights

pertaining to it.

F. AGREEMENT OF GOOD UNDERSTANDING

179. Claimant maintains that in January 2007,* in order to formalize the prior arrangements
among UTC, NTSH and Claimant, Messrs. Pacolli, Ejupi and Berisha signed an
“Agreement of Good Understanding” (hereinafter “AGU”).44 Under the AGU, UTC
would become the formal owner of the shares of Grand Hotel fora period of two years.
Thus, according to paragraph 2 of the AGU, UTC was initially the “legal purchaser,” while
Messrs. Ejupi and Pacolli were the “actual purchaser[s].”45 When the two years passed,
Claimant, NTSH and UTC were to officially become joint owners of the shares, with the
shares distributed among the three owners as follows: UTC 40%, NTSH 20% and Claimant
40%.46 Under the AGU, Mr. Pacolli’s brother, Selim Pacolli was appointed as Mr.

Behgjet’s representative on the board of the Grand Hotel L.L.C.

180. Claimant maintains that when Messrs. Pacolli, Ejupi, and Berisha signed the AGU, they
did so on behalf of Claimant, NTSH and UTC, respectively. More specifically, Claimant
maintains that in all the discussions pertaining to the privatization, Mr. Pacolli, as President

of the Board of Claimant, acted as representative of Claimant.*7 According to Claimant,

4 Tn some papers, the date of execution of the AGU is given as 22/28 Dec. 2006.

47 Cl. Counter-Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 39-40. According to Claimant:

181.

182.

the three individuals were to be understood, and were understood, as acting on behalf of
the companies that they respectively owned, and Mr. Ejupi affirmed that this was their
understanding. *8 UTC, having paid the purchase price, and Mr. Berisha, having signed the
AGU, the latter thereafter was acting vis-a-vis the KTA on behalf of all three companies.
Mr. Selim Pacolli testified that his brother informed him of all the foregoing events and

understandings. *?

 

According to Behgjet Pacolli, the KTA knew about and approved of the agreement and the

 

source of funds.5° However, according to Mr. Lluka, the PAK was never made aware of
the AGU orany otheragreement between Mr. Berisha, on the one hand, and Messrs. Pacolli

and Ejupi, on the other.*!

Respondent maintains that Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi signed the AGU in their personal
capacities only.*? Respondent cites in support of this proposition the fact that the title page
of the AGU, the Recitals, Article III, Article XIII lit. b, and the signature page refer to the
Contracting Parties as “Co-owners” in their capacity as natural persons. In sum, Claimant
as such was not involved in any of the steps relating to the privatization of the Grand
Hotel.53 Claimant reads the record entirely differently, identifying numerous ways in which

Claimant manifested its involvement in the various transactions.*+

The facts as established clearly suggest that the AGU was concluded by the Co-
Owners with respect to the joint purchase of the shares of Grand Hotel. As
undisputed by Respondent, Mr. Behgjet Pacolli was at the time of the conclusion
of the AGU the president of the board of Claimant. In all the discussions
regarding the privatization of Grand Hotel, he always acted within its capacity
as representative, so didhe, when he concluded the AGU...

Respondent also claims that uncertainty surrounds the question of what exactly the term
“Hotel Grand Pristina” signified in the context of the AGU. 5 Respondent further notes that
the name of the Claimant is not mentioned in the AGU. Claimant strongly disagrees,
quoting at length from the AGU, to establish that the AGU’s import was entirely clear. In
fact, the Grand Hotel shares were not registered with the Kosovo Business Registration
Agency, and, when the two-year period elapsed, UTC failed to transfer the shares to

Claimant and NTSH, or to Messrs. Pacolli or Ejupi.
WITHDRAWAL OF THE SHARES
At this point, Claimant’s and Respondent’s narratives diverge even more markedly.

Claimant asserts that starting in 2008, UTC ignored Claimant’s and NTSH’s ownership in
the Grand Hotel, refused to accept Claimant’s offer of the funds needed to maintain the
investment and meet the owners’ commitments under the Purchase Agreement. Claimant
testified that UTC went so far as to deny Claimant access to the Grand Hotel,** thereby
preventing Claimant from making the required investments. According to Claimant, had
its proposal been accepted, the obligations under the Commitment Agreement would have
been performed.*” Claimant further asserts that it later learned that UTC had deliberately
taken these acts and omissions in collaboration with the PAK, for the purpose of either

extorting Claimant and NTSH or excluding them from the project. *8

Having determined that UTC had failed to comply with its obligations under the
Commitment Agreement, the PAK, pursuant to the Agreement, engaged an independent
auditor to conduct an inquiry into the matter. A first audit report, °° issued on 16 November
2009, and covering the period from 13 August 2006 to 13 August 2009, found that only
EUR 1,244,373.33 out of the required EUR 20,200,000.00 had been invested. As for

employment commitments, the report found that in the first year, UTC employed on
average 84.11 more employees than required; in the second year, on average 121.58 fewer
employees than required; and in the third year 1 more employee than required. The PAK
made it known that it was, as a consequence, contemplating withdrawal of the shares in the

Grand Hotel.

On 21 October 2011, Selim Pacolli, having learned of this possibility, sent a letter to the
PAK in his capacity as Claimant’s representative on the board of Grand Hotel L.L.C.,
urging that the shares not be withdrawn.°! Both Selim Pacolli® and Behgjet Pacolli®
affirm that the letter was written on behalf of Claimant. The letter reminded the PAK that
Mr. Pacolli had contributed EUR 4m for purchase of the Grand Hotel shares and, by virtue
of the AGU, formally acquired co-ownership of the Grand Hotel. It also informed the PAK
that UTC had undertaken works, without consultation of Messrs Ejupi and Pacolli, that did
not benefit the restoration of the hotel. Finally, it assured the PAK that it was prepared
itself to fulfill all the commitments made under the Purchase Agreement, provided it was

given access to the hotel, and it asked the PAK to allow it to do so.

The PAK replied to Behgjet Pacolli, rather than Selim Pacolli, asserting that “the sale
contract of the [Grand Hotel] was signed only with Mr. Zelqif Berisha, as the purchaser of
this new company.”® In the letter, the PAK reported that the necessary decisions, including
a potential withdrawal of shares, would be taken at an upcoming PAK Board of Directors

meeting.

Respondent further asserts that, by 2011, UTC had still not fully complied with its

commitment to invest at least EUR 20.2m or to employ and maintain at least 540

employees. Accordingly, the PAK continued to contemplate exercising its right under the

Purchase Agreement to withdraw the shares.®7

On 14 December 2011, Selim Pacolli wrote to the PAK once again, reiterating his view
that the PAK’s withdrawal of the shares would violate Claimant’s ownership rights.

Claimant asserts that, once again, Selim Pacolli was writing on behalf of Claimant.®®

Having received Claimant’s letters of 21 October and 14 December 2011, the PAK Board
of Directors met on 16 December 2011 to discuss the Grand Hotel matter. It decided that
the share call option should be exercised, but that UTC should be given a final chance to

find new investors who would commit to making the required investments.

According to Mr. Lluka, there followed a concerted effort to find external investors who
would make the investments in the Grand Hotel that were required. He testified that, in this

connection, the PAK held talks with a number of interested investors.”

Mr. Lluka testified that, in early January, the Board received a notice of claim by Mr.
Pacolli, in his individual capacity, and Mrs. Ejupi, as representative of NTSH, demanding
recognition of their rights as shareholders and reversal by the PAK of its 16 December
2011 decision.”! According to Claimant, the PAK then invited Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and
Ejupi to a January 2012 meeting at which they were informed that Mr. Naser Osmani, a
member of the Board of the PAK, had been appointed “commission chairman on the Grand
Hotel issue.” 72 According to Claimant, they were also advised that if they provided certain
documentation, the PAK would not withdraw the shares and would register UTC, NTSH
and Claimant as co-owners of the Grand Hotel in the Kosovo Business Registry. Such

documentation, according to Claimant was to include a bank guarantee for investments to

be made in the amount of EUR 20.2m, as well as a business plan.73 According to Selim

Pacolli, Claimant provided all the documentation that was requested. 74

194. Mr. Lluka testified that the PAK thereafter received several letters from Selim Pacolli
recounting the difficulties that they were having with Mr. Berisha.75 He stated that those
letters were sent in Mr. Pacolli’s personal capacity.” Eventually, Selim Pacolli, again in
his personal capacity, requested a meeting with the PAK to discuss the matter.” According
to Mr. Lluka, in agreeing to such a meeting, the PAK considered Selim Pacolli, as well as
Behgjet Pacolli and Mr. Ejupi, to be new interested investors havingno preexisting interest

in the Grand Hotel. ”*

195. Mr. Lluka does not testify as to what occurred at that meeting which was held on 12
February 2012. However, he testifies that he thereafter received a letter, for the first time,
from Behgjet Pacolli, reiterating the concerns that his brother had previously raised.”
According to Mr. Lluka, he responded to that letter on 5 March 2012 by insisting that the
Purchase Agreement had been entered into with UTC alone and that UTC alone was the
purchaser of shares in the Grand Hotel.8° Mr. Lluka also informed Mr. Pacolli that the
Board would meet once again on 12 March 2012 before makinga final decision on the

Grand Hotel on 15 March 2012.8! According to Claimant, the letter said the following:

196. Meanwhile, the PAK had commissioned a second audit, the report of which was issued on
8 March 2012 covering the period between 15 August 2009 and 8 March 2012.83 That
report concluded that by then only EUR 1,680,435.26 out of the required EUR 20.2m had
been invested, i.e., 8.32%, and that the employment commitments had been implemented

at a level of 79.52%. §4

197. According to Mr. Lluka, upon receiving a further letter from Selim Pacolli in his personal
capacity, *5 he reiterated that the PAK had norelationship with Behgjet Pacolli and was not
prepared to honor any change in ownership structure upon which Messrs. Berisha, Pacolli
and Ejupimay have agreed. 86 Mr. Lluka testified that the PAK never accepted Mr. Pacolli’s
claim that he was already an investor in the Grand Hotel based on an alleged agreement

with Mr. Berisha.

198. Mr. Lluka testified that at the 15 March 2012 meeting, the Board of the PAK decided to
suspend any withdrawal of the shares, due to the interest shown by potential investors, all
of whom, including Mr. Pacolli, the PAK viewed as new investors.” According to
Mr. Lluka, the PAK never acknowledged any pre-existing ownership by Behgjet or Selim

Pacolli, but merely asked them to supply various documents, including bank guarantees

and a business plan, a request that the PAK made to all potential investors. The purpose of

such documents was strictly to assess the applicants’ reliability as investors. 88

On 14 March 2012, the PAK wrote to Selim Pacolli reiterating its view that, while the PAK
was a party to the Purchase Agreement, the Agreement identified only one buyer, namely
UTC, so that Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi were third parties only.8 According to Claimant,
the PAK nevertheless postponed its decision on withdrawal of the shares that was initially

scheduled for 15 March 2012.%

According to Claimant, there followed a series of attempts at extortion on the PAK’s part.
First, certain persons with close links to the PAK and its then director, Mr. Dino Asanaj,
allegedly asked Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi to pay an additional EUR 4m in order for the
shares of the Grand Hotel to be registered, or else the shares would not be registered, and
would actually be withdrawn.®! Mr. Ejupi confirms that these extortion attempts were
made, and were arranged specifically by Mr. Asanaj.%? The so-called “intermediaries of
PAK” included Astrit Haraqija, former minister of finance; Uke Rugova, the son of the
former President and deputy in the National Assembly; and Gazmend Abrashi, a
businessman and former bidder for the Grand Hotel.% Mr. Pacolli says that he refused to

make the payment.

Claimant asserts that on 16 March 2012 a further meeting took place among Behgjet
Pacolli, Remzi Ejupi and Gazmend Abrashi, at which Mr. Abrashi asked for payment of

EUR 3.6m in order for the shares to be registered.°4 Selim Pacolli affirms that this is what

with information about the PAK’s alleged extortion attempts.

202. According to Claimant,” the PAK, under pressure from public opinion, wrote again to
Selim Pacolli and Mr. Ejupion 19 March 2012,% officially requesting further information

as follows:

[By] 21 March we should accept the agreement with Grand Hotel
Prishtina purchaser, along with a proposal how the new
shareholders will meet the conditions provided for in the
Commitment Agreement, which proposal should be supported by a
Bank Guarantee.

[T]herefore [by] 21 March you are kindly asked to submit:

- Agreement with Grand Hotel purchaser;
- Official request on change of structure of ownership/shareholders;

- Unconditional bank guarantee to be issued by acredible first class
financial institution; and an action plan or business plan on the way
of fulfilment of contractual obligations.”

203. Inaddition to characterizing the extortion charge as a merits rather than jurisdictional issue,
Respondent denies that any extortion attempts took place, observing that the only
documentary evidence consists of statements by Behgjet Pacollito the police anda witness
statement in this proceeding. Respondent points out that, upon investigation, the
prosecution found insufficient evidence to take the allegations any further, with no

indictment, much less trial. 10°

However, Claimant maintains that UTC’s earlier failures of performance under the
Purchase Agreement and its refusal of Claimant’s financial contribution were in fact part
of a plan by which UTC collaborated with the chair and deputy chair of the PAK to extort
both Claimant and NTSH through threats that their shares in the Grand Hotel would be

withdrawn if they did not make further payments. !0!

On 28 March 2012, Mr. Berisha, Mrs. Ejupi (representing Mr. Ejupi), and Mr. Selim
Pacolli entered into an Annex Agreement to the AGU (hereinafter “Annex
Agreement’). !2 Once again, Claimant insists that they entered into the Agreement on
behalf of their companies. However, according to Respondent, while Mr. Berisha
represented UTC and Mrs. Ejupi represented NTSH, Mr. Selim Pacolli represented only

Mr. Behgjet Pacolli and Mabetex, but not Claimant.!03

The Annex Agreement was submitted to the PAK on 29 March 2012, along with a business
plan setting out the planned capital investments and increase in the number of employees
over the following two years, ! as well as a performance guarantee dated 21 March 2012
issued by the National Commercial Bank Kosovo in the amount of EUR 20.2m in favor of
Mabetex (hereinafter “Performance Guarantee”).!°5 According to Claimant, this
submission complied fully with the PAK’s 19 March request for documentation.!0°
However, Respondent points out that, according to Article V of the Annex Agreement, the
Agreement was only to enter into force after approval by the PAK, and that the PAK never

gave its approval. !07

According to Claimant, there followed a meeting between Mr. Ejupiand Mr. Naser Osmani
of the PAK, in which Mr. Osmani assured Mr. Ejupi that all the papers were in order, but
that a payment of EUR Im still needed to be paid in order for the shares to be registered
and not withdrawn. !°8 Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi declined. Claimant maintains that still

another attempt at extortion was made on 25 April 2012, but likewise was unsuccessful. !°

On 31 May 2012, the PAK finally announced its decision to withdraw the shares of the
Grand Hotel.!!° According to Claimant, that announcement was made shortly after

Claimant and NTSH had refused to pay the above-mentioned bribes.!"!

Claimant reports then sending a letter of 14 June 2012 to the PAK requesting that it review
and cancel its decision to withdraw the shares.!!? Receiving no reply, Claimant sent a
further letter on 20 June 2012, claiming that the PAK had accepted Claimant’s ownership
of the shares, and warning the PAK that, unless the change in ownership structure was

registered, Claimant would initiate arbitration under the BIT.!3

On 22 June 2012, the PAK replied.!'4 According to Claimant, in its reply the PAK
acknowledged receiving the required documents, but stated that it would not register the
shares because it had been informed by UTC that Claimant and NTSH were not serious in

their intentions. !!5

211. Finally, Claimant and NTSH wrote to the PAK on 28 June 2012, reiterating their intention

to initiate arbitration if their request for registration of their shares was not granted. !!6

212. Claimant reports that in August 2012, the European Rule of Law Mission in Kosovo,

together with local authorities, initiated an investigation into the privatization of the Grand

Hotel.!!7 Mr. Pacolli testified that all of the 2011 and 2012 events surrounding ownership

and withdrawal of the shares are recorded in the resulting Police Reports of 22 August

2012 and 30 November 2012.!!8 According to the 22 August Report:

Based on analyzes of witness statements regarding this case, it is
suspected that Zylqif Berisha has been in close connection with
persons having access to NPA [PAK] decisions, and the breach of
contract by those claiming to have undergone damages in this case
was intentional and well-planned.

This case also involves second degree judge Sylajman Nuredini,
suspected of making a decision for retrial as a favour to Zylqif
Berisha, who managed to corrupt this judge.

Intermediators who continued to demand four million euros, or
three anda half million euros of the aggrieved party Behxjet Pacolli
[] in order to have the Hotel Grand privatization disengaged.
Intermediators of this case who are allegedly connected in a group
are Naser Osmani (ex-deputy of NPA [PAK]), Dino Asanaj, Astrit
Haragqija, Uké Rugova, Adelina Regica (Dino's ex-wife) and Burim
Gashi and Gazmend Abrashi.

All NPA [PAK] meetings that were postponed, andall decisions, put
offon the matter were allegedly part of the plan to extort the injured
parties in this case.

Regarding this situation, the above-mentioned group is suspected of
high-level, decision-making organized crime, assisted by their
intermediators and the businessman who privatized Hotel Grand.!!°

Mr. Ejupi also affirms the truth of the statements made to the police and recorded in the
Police Reports. !7°

On 17 July 2012, the PAK informed Claimant as follows:

[PAK has] undertaken the necessary legal actions to return the
ownership of the Grand Hotel and the same is now returned on the
name of the Agency. Therefore, all displeased parties may contact
competent bodies.'*!

According to its annual report for 2013, the PAK resumed direct administration of the

Grand Hotel on 20 July 2012.!”2

Although Respondent alleges that Claimant committed various breaches of the Tender
Rules (see paras. 339-345, infra), Claimant maintains that none of the PAK’s
communications to it over this entire period made reference to any breach of those Rules,

the Purchase Agreement or the Commitment Agreement on Claimant’s part. !23

Claimant states that, while declining to register the shares in Claimant’s name and in fact
withdrawing them, the PAK kept the paid purchase price for those shares, including the
EUR 4m that Claimant had contributed.!4 Claimant maintains that it received no

compensation from the PAK for the loss of its investment.

H. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN KOSOVO

217. In this case, there are two relevant sets of legal proceedings in the courts of Kosovo.

218. First, in 2007, Messrs. Pacolli, as president and CEO Mabetex Group, and NTSH brought
suit against Mr. Berisha in Municipal Court in Pristina,!?5 seeking recognition that the
plaintiffs were owners of 40% and 20% of the shares, respectively. The Municipal Court
ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, affirming their share ownership. However, the District Court
of Pristina then reversed that judgment. Claimant’s view is that the District Court made no
ruling on the merits, but merely remanded the case to the Municipal Court for clarification
of the question whether the suit was brought in the plaintiffs’ personal capacity or on behalf
of their respective companies.'*6 According to Claimant, on remand, the Municipal Court
never decided the ownership question because by that time the shares had already been
withdrawn.!27 Respondent takes a different view of the District Court judgment.
According to it, the Court found that Mr. Pacolli did not obtain any shares or other interest
in the Grand Hotel, !28 so holding on the ground that there was no written contract for the
transfer of ownership, !?? that the AGU lacked the required elements to constitute a

company statute, '*° and that the alleged shareholding was never registered. !3!

219. On 8 June 2012, UTC filed an action against the PAK in the Supreme Court of Kosovo,
and more particularly in the Court’s Special Chamber for Matters relating to the

Privatization Agency (hereinafter “SCSC”),'>? challenging the PAK’s decision to

withdraw the shares in the Grand Hotel and seeking an interim injunction restraining the
PAK from doing so. On 25 June 2012, a first instance panel of the Special Chamber denied
UTC’s request for interim relief, butthe Appellate Panel reversed that decision, and granted
the requested relief in part. On 20 March 2013, the Special Chamber rejected UTC’s claim

on the merits. !33

Meanwhile, on 19 November 2012, Claimant and NTSH likewise initiated proceedings in
the SCSC forannulmentof the decision by the PAK to withdraw the shares of Grand Hotel.
The court found that the action had not been brought within the 120-day limitations period

established by law, 4 and ruled it inadmissible. !35

On 15 April 2013, UTC appealed the decision rendered against it to the Special Chamber’s
Appellate Panel. On 20 January 2014, both Claimant and NTSH sought to intervene in
UTC’s appeal. '36 Both UTC and the PAK objected to the request, the PAK arguing that the
applicants had “no legal-material relation with [PAK].” On 26 June 2014, the Appellate
Panel rejected the petition to intervene.'37 According to Claimant, the Appellate Panel did
not address Claimant’s arguments, but rather based its decision on the mere fact that the
PAK and UTC objected to the requested intervention. !38 On the merits, the Appellate Panel
affirmed the lower court’s ruling, characterizing UTC’s non-compliance with the

investment commitments as an “egregious breach of contractual obligations.” 39

On 14 November 2014, UTC filed a complaint with the Constitutional Court of Kosovo,
but lost on the merits. '4° On 17 November 2014, Claimant and NTSH likewise filed a

complaint with the Constitutional Court, claiming a violation not only of the Constitution

but also the BIT. According to Claimant, the Court found the claims to be inadmissible on
the ground that it lacked competence to examine the compatibility of national law with

international agreements. !4!

223. It is on this basis that Claimant also charges Kosovo with denial of justice.

I. STATEMENT OF CL.

 

224. Claimant alleges that Respondent expropriated its investment and denied it fair and
equitable treatment, while also committing a denial of justice — all in violation of its

obligations under the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law. !42
225. With respect to expropriation, Claimant invokes Articles 5(1) and 5(2) of the BIT:
Article 5

(1) Neither of the Parties shall take, either directly or indirectly,
measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other measure
having the same nature or the same effect against investments of
investors of the other Contracting Party...

(2) [D]ue process of law includes the right of an investor of a
Contracting Party, which claims to be affected by expropriation by
the other Contracting Party, to prompt review of its case, including
the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation in
accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial
authority or another competent and independent authority of the
latter Contracting Party.

226. With respect to fair and equitable treatment, Claimant invokes Article 4(1) of the BIT:
Article 4

(1) Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to
investments and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party
at all times fair and equitable treatment as well as full protection

and security. Neither Contracting Party shall impair, by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, extensions or disposal of such investments.

227. The provision applicable to the expropriation claim under the 2005 Foreign Investment

Law is the following: !43
Article 8

8.1, [An investment in Kosovo made by a foreign investor] shall ...
not be subject to any act of expropriation by or attributable to
Kosovo.

8.2. Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Article 8.1,
Kosovo may take an act of expropriation affecting an asset of a
foreign investor, foreign investment organization or foreign person,
if the act of expropriation:

a. is for a clearly defined and legitimate public purpose;

b. is not inspired by any discriminatory objective;

c. is carried out in a non-discriminatory manner;

d. is carried out in accordance with due process of law; and

e. is accompanied by the prompt payment of adequate and effective
compensation.

228. Insofar as Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment claim relates to its claimed ownership of
the Grand Hotel shares, the 2005 Foreign Investment Law is applicable. '*4 The relevant

provisions follow:

'3 For reasons explained below in ion with R ’s objections ratio temporis objections (paras. 464-
469, infra), Claimant’s expropriation claim is subject to the 2005 rather than the 2014 Foreign Investment Law.

 

‘4 For reasons explained below in connection with Respondent's objections ratio temporis objections (paras. 470-
473, infra), Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment expropriation claim in connection with its alleged ownership of
the Grand Hotel is subject tothe 2005 rather than the 20 14 Foreign Investment Law.

46

Article 3

3.1. Kosovo shall accord fair and equitable treatment to foreign
investors and their investments in Kosovo. Kosovo shall also
provide foreign investors and their investments with full and
constant protection and security. In no case shall the treatment,
protection or security required by this Article 3.1 be less favorable
than that required by international law or any provision of the
present law.

3.2. Kosovo shall not impair by any unreasonable or discriminatory
action or inaction, the operation, management, maintenance, use
enjoyment or disposal of a foreign investment organization or other
investment by a foreign investor in Kosovo. Kosovo shall in
particular not interfere with the lawful activities, rights and legally
recognized interests of a foreign investor.

3.3. Any public authority that violates or otherwise fails to respect
the rights and guarantees provided by the present law to foreign
investors and their investments shall be liable to pay compensation ...
for losses and expenses incurred as a consequence of such violation or
failure...

229. Insofar as Claimant’s fair and equitable treatment claim encompasses its claim of denial of

justice, the 2014 Foreign Investment Law is applicable. '45 The relevant provisions follow:
Article 3

1. Republic of Kosovo shall accord fair and equitable treatment to
foreign investors and their investments in Kosovo with any local
investors and local investments.

2. Republic of Kosovo shall also provide foreign investors and their
investments with full and constant protection and security in
accordance with the applicable legislation.

law.

4. Republic of Kosovo shall not impair by any unreasonable or

maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of a foreign investment
organization or other investment by a foreign investor in the
Republic of Kosovo. Republic of Kosovo shall not interfere with the
lawful activities, rights and legally recognized interests of a foreign
investor.

5. Any public authority that violates or otherwise fails to respect the
rights and guarantees provided by the present law to foreign
investors and their investments shall be liable to pay compensation,
in accordance with Article 8 paragraph 2 of this law, for losses and
expenses incurred as a consequence of such violation or failure. No
type of legal immunity shall serve as bar to the liability created by
this Article.

CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT UNDER THE BIT AND THE FOREIGN
INVESTMENT LAW

In this proceeding, Claimant maintains that it has made a qualifying investment within the
meaning of the BIT, the Foreign Investment Law and the ICSID Convention. The
definitions of “investment” under the BIT, the Foreign Investment Laws and the ICSID
Conventions are different. For that reason, whether Claimant has made an investment must

be examined separately for each of these three instruments.

qd) “INVESTMENT” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE BIT

According to Article 2 of the BIT, its provisions apply to investments in the territory of
one Contracting Party established in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors
of the other Contracting Party, “whether [made] prior to or after the entry into force of [the
BIT].” However, the BIT does notapply “to claims and disputes arising out of events which

occurred prior to its entry into force.”

Article 1(1) of the BIT defines an investmentas “every kind of asset established or acquired
by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party that
has such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of
gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.” Such an asset may take the form of:

48

233.

234.

235.

(a) movable and immovable property as well as any related rights,
such as servitudes, mortgages, liens and pledges;

(b) a company, orshares, parts or any other kind of participation in
acompany;

(c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic
value, except claims to money arising solely out of commercial
contracts for the sale of goods and services, ... [and]

(e) rights conferred pursuant to law, contract or decision of an
authority such as concessions, licences, authorizations and permits.

Article 1(2) defines “investor” to include “(b) a legal entity, including companies,
corporations, business associations and other organisations, which are constituted or
otherwise duly organized under the law of that Contracting party and have their seat,

together with real economic activities, in the territory of the same Contracting Party.”

Article 11 of the BIT contemplates the arbitration of disputes “between an investor of a
Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former
made in the territory of the latter ... based on an alleged breach of obligations under [the

BIT].”

Claimant maintains that it has established all the requirements under the foregoing
provisions of the BIT that must be met in order to qualify as a foreign investor that has
made an investment in Kosovo. It maintains that both its shares in the Grand Hotel and its
claims to performance of Kosovo’s undertaking to transfer ownership of those shares are
assets that constitute investments within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the BIT.'46
Claimant specifically argues that legal title to shares is not required to constitute an
investment and that beneficial ownership suffices. Its ownership interest consisted of the

right to registration of the Grand Hotel shares, thereby formally acquiring ownership of

'46 Cl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., paras. 155-156.

49

236.

237.

238.

those shares. Thus, the fact that Claimant’s share ownership was not yet registered in

Kosovo does not prevent it from constituting an investment. !47

(2) “INVESTMENT” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE KOSOVO FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW

As explained above, '48 with respect to the Foreign Investment Law, the Tribunal must take
into account both the 2005 and 2014 Foreign Investment Laws, which are worded

somewhat differently:

(a) The 2005 Foreign Investment Law

Article 2(1) of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law defines “investment dispute” as “any
dispute between a foreign investor and a public authority relating (i) to an investment in

Kosovo made by such foreign investor ...” The provision continues:

An “investment dispute” includes, but is not limited to, such a
dispute that relates to:

a. any alleged inconsistency of an action or inaction of a public
authority with any international agreement that is binding on
Kosovo, the present law or any other law, regulation or normative
or sub normative act of Kosovo;

OF
c. the making or attempt to make an investment in Kosovo.

A “foreign investor” is defined under the 2005 Foreign Investment Law as “a foreign
person that has made an investment in Kosovo,” and a “foreign person” in turn includes,
among others, “b. a business or other organization, entity or association - with or without
legal personality - that has been established under the law of a foreign state or geographic

territory outside Kosovo.”

‘7 CL. post-hearingbr., paras. 66-68. citing Exh. CL-29: Mr. Saba Fakes v. Republicof Turkey, 1CSID Case No. ARB
07/20, Award, 14 July 2010, para. 134 (“The separation of lega| title and beneficial ownership rights does not deprive
such ownership of the characteristics of the investment within the meaning of the ICSID Convention or... the BIT.”)

148 supra, pata. 137.

50

239. An “investment” is defined under the 2005 Foreign Investment Law in part as:

[A]ny asset that has (i) been contributed to a Kosovo business
organization in return for an ownership interest in that business
organization; ...

The term “asset” is in turn defined in part as:

[A]ny item of value, whether tangible or intangible, and includes,
but is not limited to, the following and similar items:

a. movable and immovable property, including rights in and to such
property such as a mortgage, lien, pledge, lease or servitude; ...
[and]

d. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance
under contract, ...

(b) The 2014 Foreign Investment Law

240. Under Article 2.1.4 of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law, an investment is “any asset
owned or otherwise lawfully held by a Foreign Person in the Republic of Kosovo for the

purpose of conducting lawful commercial activities, including but not limited to”:

1.4.3. cash, securities, commercial paper, guarantees, shares of
stock or other types ofownership interests in the Republic of Kosovo
or foreign business organization; bonds, debentures, other debt
instruments

1.4.4. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance
under contract...

241. Article 16(1) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law requires that the claimant be a “foreign
investor,” defined as a “foreign person that has made an investment in the Republic of

Kosovo.”

242. In Claimant’s view, its claim to performance by Kosovo of its obligation to register those

shares and refrain from withdrawing them are assets qualifying as an investment under

51

both the 2005 and 2014 Foreign Investment Laws. Moreover, as a Swiss entity, it is a

foreign investor.

B. CLAIMANT’S INVESTMENT UNDER THE ICSID CONVENTION

243. Article 25(1) defines the jurisdiction of ICSID as follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State ... and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the
dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.

244. Claimant maintains that it satisfies the jurisdictional requirements set out in Article 25(1)

since:

a. the dispute is a legal one arising directly out of an investment (condition ratione
materiae);

b. the dispute is between a Contracting State and a national of the other Contracting State
(condition ratione personae); and

c. the parties consented to settlement of the dispute through ICSID arbitration (condition
ratione voluntatis).'\°
According to Claimant, Respondent gave its consent to arbitration under both the BIT and

the Foreign Investment Law. !5°

245. Claimant also asserts that its purchase of shares in the Grand Hotel meets all the criteria of
an investment under the ICSID Convention established by arbitral jurisprudence. '5! These
are a substantial capital contribution, entailing a certain risk, promising a regular profit and
return, and having a certain duration. !°? If an additional requirement— contribution to the

host State’s economic development — is imposed, Claimant meets that requirement as well,

due to the importance of the Grand Hotel, including its renovation and operation, to the

economy of Kosovo.

Accordingly, Claimant contends that its ownership interest in the Grand Hotel constitutes

an investment for purposes of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Claimant concludes from the above that it made a qualifying investment in Kosovo, within
the meaning of the BIT, the Kosovo Foreign Investment Law and the ICSID Convention.

It further claims that the present dispute arises directly out of that investment. !*3

STATEMENT OF DEFENSE

Respondent contests the jurisdiction of this Tribunal under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention on numerous grounds, '*4 including notably that it did not consentto arbitration

of the claims asserted by Claimant under either the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law. !55

First, Claimant cannot avail itself of either the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law because
it owns no qualifying asset, which is necessary, ratione materiae, in order for either of
those instruments to apply. It never acquired ownership of, or a right or interest in, the
asset at issue in this case. '5° Moreover, while the ICSID Convention does not itself define
an investment, arbitral jurisprudence has done so. According to the prevailing view, an
investment must exhibit the following characteristics: a substantial capital contribution, a
certain risk and a certain duration.'*” In addition, it may be required to make a substantial

contribution to the host State’s economic development.!** According to Respondent,

253.

Claimant fails to satisfy any of these requirements. It made no capital contribution, much
less a substantial one and, because of that, itassumed no risk, made no investment of the
requisite duration, and did not contribute substantially to the host State’s economic

development. !59

Second, Claimant does not qualify as a foreign investor. Since Claimant made no
investment, it is not an investor, much less a foreign investor. If any investment was made,
it would have been made by Mr. Pacolli in his personal capacity. Being a national of
Kosovo, he does not qualify as a foreign investor. Nor can Claimant itself be considered a
foreign national, in this case a national of Switzerland, due to the absence of any real
economic activity on its part in Switzerland. The Tribunal accordingly lacks jurisdiction

ratione personae.

Third, the alleged investment is not a protected one under either the BIT or the Foreign

Investment Law because, if made, it was made unlawfully under Kosovo law.

Fourth, because Respondent did not consent to arbitrate the present dispute, the Tribunal
also lacks jurisdiction ratione voluntatis. Respondent’s consent to arbitrate was subject
under Article 11(2) of the BIT and Article 16(2) of both the 2005 and 2014 Foreign
Investment Laws to an “election of remedies” requirement.' Under those provisions,
because Claimant first brought litigation over its claims in the courts of Kosovo, it could
no longer resort to arbitration over them. Also, under Article 11(1) of the BIT (although
not under the Foreign Investment Law), Respondent’s consent to arbitrate was conditional
upon Claimant’s engaging with the Respondentin an ef fortto settle their dispute “amicably

through consultations,” which Claimant failed to do.

Fifth, Respondent argues that, even if all of the BIT conditions were otherwise met, the

tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis. According to Article 2, while the BIT applies

'° Resp. Mem. on Jurisd., paras. 106, 118-122; Resp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 282-293.

1 Article 11(2) of the BIT: “[TJhe investor may submit the dispute either to the courts orthe administrativetribunals
of the Contracting Party concemed or to international arbitration.” (Exh. C-1); Article 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign
Investment Law: “... a foreign investor shall have the right to require that the investment dispute be settled either
through litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction in the Republic of Kosovo or through local and intemational
arbitration.” (Exhs. C-18/R-19).

54

254.

255.

256.

to investments made prior to the BIT’s entry into force, it does not apply “to claims and
disputes arising out of events which occurred prior to its entry into force.” (Neither the
2005 nor the 2014 Foreign Investment Law contains such a limitation. On the contrary, the
2014 Law specifically states that “[t]he present law — and the rights, guarantees, privileges
and protections established by the present law — shall apply equally to foreign investors
that invested in the Republic of Kosovo prior to the effective date of this law.”!°')
According to Respondent, the events giving rise to the dispute occurred on 16 December
2011, which is when the PAK decided to withdraw the shares of Grand Hotel or, at the
latest 31 May 2012, which is when the PAK made the decision to execute the withdrawal
of shares. Both dates precede the BIT’s entry into force on 13 June 2012.1

Sixth, the claim advanced in this proceeding is at variance with the scope and purpose of

the ICSID Convention.
Seventh, Claimant failed to establish a prima facie case on the merits.

Respondent accordingly challenges the jurisdiction of this Tribunal ratione personae,
ratione materiae and ratione voluntatis under the ICSID Convention, the BIT and the
Foreign Investment Law, as well as ratione temporis under the BIT. The Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections and Claimant’s responses thereto are dealt with in the following
sequence:

A. The claim does notarise out of or relate to an investment in Kosovo.

B. Claimant is nota foreign investor.

C. Claimant’s alleged ownership interest in shares of Grand Hotel LLC is nota “protected
investment”.

D. Respondent did not give its consent to arbitrate the present dispute.
E. The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis.

F. Claim falls outside the scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention.

258.

G. Claimant has failed to establish a prima facie cause of action.

Each of these challenges is taken up in turn below.

THE CLAIM DOES NOT ARISE OUT OF OR RELATE TO AN INVESTMENT IN
KOSOVO
Respondent maintains that Claimant did not make an investment in Kosovo, within the

meaning of the relevant instruments. It bases this contention on the following propositions:

(1) Claimant never held any assets relating to the Grand Hotel.

(2) Claimant’s payment of EUR 4m does not constitute evidence of an investment on
Claimant’s part.

(3) Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the AGU.

(4) Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the Annex Agreement.

The Tribunal examines each of these propositions in turn.

(1) CLAIMANT NEVER HELD ANY ASSETS RELATING TO THE GRAND HOTEL
(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent asserts that Claimant was involved in none of the steps of the tender process.
The successful bid was made by UTC, not Claimant.'® Claimant accordingly was a third
party and acquired no rights of ownership in the Grand Hotel. Respondent cites Article

5.1.3 of the Purchase Agreement by which UTC itself confirmed that:

[T]he Buyer is purchasing the Shares for its own use and not as an
agent for a third party and during the tender for this Company, the
Buyer has not formed any informal or formal undisclosed
agreements or consortiums between two or more bidders or with
any undisclosed third party.

261.

According to Respondent, whether the alleged investor was Mr. Pacolli or Claimant, it
would have been a secret investor in violation of the Tender Rules and the above-quoted

provision of the Purchase Agreement. !4

Respondent also contests that Mr. Ahmet Shala invited Claimant to participate in the
privatization of the Grand Hotel. It finds that in previous accounts of the transactions given
by Mr. Pacolli, including in his witness statement, no mention of Mr. Shala is made. '®5 Nor
is there any documentation to support Claimant’s contention. © Respondent also raises a
temporal doubt about Claimant’s contention because, while Mr. Pacolli represents that
Mr. Shala approached him and Mr. Ejupi about their possible interest in investing in the
Grand Hotel in early March 2006,'67 UTC was not declared the winning bidder until 27
March 2006. At that time, the KTA had no reason to doubt UTC’s ability to pay the
purchase price. Above all, in his witness statement, Mr. Shala denies Mr. Pacolli’s account,

testifying that no such contacts were ever made. !68

Mr. Shala testified that he met Mr. Pacolli for the first time in September or October 1999
at a conference in Switzerland on the future of Kosovo, where Mr. Pacolli proposed that
Kosovo transfer all public assets to a foundation of which he would be chair, a proposal
that Mr. Shala did not favor. '® Mr. Shala further testified that he could not possibly have
allowed Claimant to become owner of the shares without following the Tender Rules.
Given the public scrutiny of the privatization process, if he deviated from the Tender Rules

he would be killed; he testified in fact to having received death threats.!7

Accordingto Mr. Shala, he and Mr. Pacolli metduringa short conversation in Mr. Pacolli’s

office in Pristina in January 2019 and afterwards flew together to Rwanda on Mr. Pacolli’s

airplane, followed at a later time by a dinner at Mr. Pacolli’s home and eventually a
breakfast together in Berlin. !7! The first time the subject of privatization of the Grand Hotel
arose was afterwards, when Mr. Pacolli asked him to issue an invitation to him to invest in

Kosovo, which Mr. Shala said he could not do. !72

Mr. Shala testified that, some days before the hearing in this arbitration, he learned that
Mr. Ejupi had approached Mr. Shala’s son-in-law, who is also a cousin of Mr. Ejupi, asking
him to set up a meeting with him. That individual made the request, which Mr. Shala then
refused, deeming it inappropriate.!”3 Counsel for Respondent questioned Mr. Pacolli about
a statement made by Mr. Shala, according to which Mr. Pacolli met with him in June 2019
and asked him to confirm in this proceeding that he invited Mr. Pacolli to co-invest in the

Grand Hotel, !” an allegation that Mr. Pacolli flatly denied. !75

Respondent further contends that, even if an investment was made, it was made by Behgjet
Pacolli in his personal capacity and not as Claimant’s representative. It claims that the
funds were transferred to Mr. Berisha from Mr. Pacolli’s personal account. !76 Moreover,
over a six-year period, between 2006 and 2012, there was no mention of Claimant in any
of the relevant correspondence. Then, when suit was brought against Mr. Berisha in 2007
in Municipal Court in Pristina, '7” seeking recognition that Claimant was owner of 40% of
the shares, and NTSH owner of 20% of the shares, it was not brought in Claimant’s name,
but in Mr. Pacolli’s.!78 The relief sought in that suit was that Mr. Pacolli (not Claimant)

and NTSH (not Mr. Ejupi) be recognized as shareholders,'”? a fact that Mr. Pacolli

BIT came into force. '!8!

Respondent cites two letters, dated 29 May 2010'*? and 3 January 2012,'*3 in the first of
which Behgjet Pacolli’s lawyer, and in the second of which Selim Pacolli, state that Behgjet
Pacolli is owner of the shares. Counsel for Respondent observes that in the first of these
letters, Mr. Pacolli’s lawyer refers to the alleged shareholders as Behgjet Pacolli, on the
one hand, and NTSH, on the other, suggesting that, while Mr. Ejupi was acting as
representative of NTSH, Mr. Pacolli was acting in a personal capacity,'*4 a suggestion that
Mr. Pacolli denies. '85 Similarly, counsel for Respondent points out that in the 3 January
2012 letter, Selim Pacolli refers to Behgjet Pacolli as “the owner of 40% of [the] shares.”!86
Further, in a letter of 29 February 2012, Behgjet Pacolli expressly stated that “my
companies have not been involved in the purchase ofassets of Grand Hotel.”!87 Mr. Pacolli
testified that Respondent has distorted the import of that language because all that was
meant by that statement was the obvious fact that his companies never participated in the
tendering process and that only UTC entered into the Purchase Agreement. According to

him the statement meant only that, “[n]Jothing more, nothing less.” !88

Respondent adds that, even if Mr. Pacolli acted in a representative capacity, he could have
been representing any one of the 35 companies comprising the Mabetex Group, not

necessarily Claimant. '*?

Then, in a letter dated 13 March 2012, Selim Pacolli identified Mabetex as shareholder
alongside NTSH, ! and in a 15 March 2012 declaration, signed by Mr. Berisha (for UTC)
and Ms. Ejupi (for NTSH), Selim Pacolli signed not for Claimant, but for Behgjet Pacolli

and Mabetex. !9!

Respondent further observes that in a letter of 28 March 2012 to the PAK, sent jointly with
Ms. Ejupi and Mr. Berisha, Selim Pacolli identified himself as a representative of a
company by the name of “NPN Mabetex Project Engineering — Pristina” and asked that
that company be listed as shareholder of the Grand Hotel. !%? Further, on 21 May 2012,
Selim Pacolli wrote to the PAK stating that Mabetex Project Engineering was in contact
with a company called “HMG Hotel management Group” regarding a potential joint
management of the Grand Hotel. !%3 Neither of these letters indicated that Selim Pacolli was
acting as Claimant’s representative. (According to Claimant, Mabetex Project Engineering
had been established in Pristina strictly as a purpose vehicle for holding investments made

by Mabetex companies, including Claimant in Switzerland.!%)

According to Respondent, the letter of 20 June 2012,!9 para. 209, supra, is the first
correspondence specifically referring to Claimant, and not simply Mr. Pacolli, as involved
in the privatization project.'°° It was in response to that letter that the PAK, on 22 June

2012, wrote back, stating that the only funds it had received were those paid by UTC and

that it had never accepted Claimant as shareholder. The PAK reiterated that position ina

letter of 17 July 2012.197

269. Respondent observes that the evidence adduced by Claimant in support of its ownership of
shares in the Grand Hotel consists nearly exclusively of the witness statements of Behgjet
and Selim Pacolli, both of whom have a material financial interest in the outcome of the
proceedings and whose testimony should therefore be discounted. !°8 Respondent further
argues that neither witness statement is supported by documentation in the record. !%? For
example, Respondent finds no documentary evidence that Mr. Shala invited Mr. Pacolli to
invest in the project; that the KTA endorsed the investment; that Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha
and Ejupi concluded an agreement prior to the 28 April 2006 transfer of funds; or that that

transfer was made pursuant to that agreement.

270. According to Respondent, Claimant misrepresents the discussions that took place between
Messrs. Pacolli and the PAK in the first half of 2012. Respondent describes those
discussions as pertaining, not to any pre-existing interest in the Grand Hotel such as
Claimant asserts, but only to the possibility that it, along with NTSH, might become
involved as new investors so as to avoid a withdrawal of shares and a retendering?°!
Respondent cites the witness statement of Mr. Shkelzen Lluka in support of this
proposition, as well as the fact that the PAK was in touch in that period with several

prospective investors.2°2

271. Respondent maintains that, under the BIT, Kosovo law determines whether a legal right
has been created and in whom, while Article 17 of both the 2005 and 2014 Foreign
Investment Laws designates as applicable the law of in Kosovo and such rules of public
international law as may be applicable to the issues in dispute. Accordingly, the questions
whether Mr. Pacolli acted in a representative capacity and to the extent to which he and his
company enjoy distinct legal personalities are strictly governed by the law of Kosovo.
Under that law, Mr. Pacolli did not act in a representative capacity and has a legal
personality distinct from Claimant.?% Kosovo law also determines whether an investment

was made and when ownership comes into being. 7

272. As summarized in Respondent’s post-hearing brief, the difficulties with Claimant’s case

are that (a) the actions taken by Mr. Pacolli may not be attributed to Claimant, (b)

°° Tn its Reply on Jurisdiction, paras. 228-231, Respondent cites the following legal provisions:

(a) Article 26 of the Law ofContracts and Torts No. 29/1978 ofthe Social Federal Republic of Yugoskavia

Claimant’s alleged asset cannot properly be defined, (c) neither Mr. Pacolli nor Claimant
ever became shareholders of the Grand Hotel L.L.C., and (d) even the contribution alleged

to have been made cannot be established.”

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant seeks to refute Respondent’s representations on various levels. It maintains that,
despite the appearance of his name alone on much of the correspondence and other
documents, all actions that Mr. Pacolli took in connection with the purchase of the shares
of the Grand Hotel and the PAK’s withdrawal of them were taken in his capacity as
representative of Mabcoas partof the Mabetex Group.2° Mr. Pacolli testified that, because
of his individual prominence in Kosovo, he typically uses his name when acting in the
interest and on behalf of his companies, so that every transaction in which he engages
within Claimant’s business sector, even if bearing his name, is made on behalf of
Claimant.2°’ He asserts that everyone knows that he does not carry on construction
business as a natural person in his own name.?°8 Accordingly, Claimant maintains that the
PAK knew perfectly well that it was Mr. Behgjet Pacolli’s company that contributed the
capital and that it was on the company’s behalf that Mr. Behgjet Pacolli acted.?

Mr. Ejupi fully concurs, testifying that, whenever reference is made in Kosovo to a person
— not only Mr. Pacolli — making an investment or even owning a particular asset, it is
understood that it is that person’s company, if he or she has one, that made the investment
or owned the asset. Thus, when any one asks him — Mr. Ejupi — to invest, they are asking
NTSH to invest.?!° Indeed, according to Mr. Ejupi, the KTA itself contemplated that it
would be companies, not individuals, that invested in privatized assets.2!! Claimant’s chief

the terms “me” or “I” in connection with his business dealings, including construction
projects, he invariably has the relevant company in mind, and that it is not at all unusual
for the sole owner of a company to identify himself or herself with his or her company.?!?
When Mr. Pacolli decides to make an investment, he selects the specific Mabetex company
to make and conduct that investment.!3 Starting in 2000, Claimant was the company that
performed all the Group’s important construction projects.”!* In fact, Claimant was the
most active company within the Mabetex Group of companies.?!5 According to Ms.
Maesani-Gaiatto, since the term “Mabetex” has always been the Group name, and since it
has become a useful “brand,” its name is commonly used in connection with the

transactions in which its individual companies engage.?!6

Claimant concedes that it did not participate in the tender process, was nota party to the
Purchase Agreement, and has never been registered as shareholder. However, it points out
that its non-participation in the tender process by no means disqualifies its eventual
ownership of shares as a protected asset under the BIT or Foreign Investment Law.?!” It
became a holder of shares in the Grand Hotel because it was specifically invited by the
KTA to purchase part of the shares, paid close to half of the total purchase price of the
shares in the Grand Hotel (as KTA knew), and entered into the AGU with UTC and NTSH
to formalize the investment.?!8 (Claimant’s reliance on the EUR 4m payment and the AGU
are dealt with more fully in the sections that follow.) The reason that only UTC signed the

Purchase Agreement is that UTC was officially the successful bidder.

Claimant insists that Mr. Shala initiated discussion with Mr. Pacolli, along with
Mr. Gazmend Abrashi, owner of a large company called Makos Ltd., of a possible

investment in the Grand Hotel. According to Claimant, the privatization effort, launched

toward the end of 2005, ran into difficulties due to the paucity of potential investors, even
though the Grand Hotel was one of Kosovo’s “crown jewels.”?!9 Faced with this problem,
Mr. Shala invited Messrs. Pacolli and Abrashi to a meeting in Tirana, Albania, to discuss
the privatization, urging them to submit bids. 22° According to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala asked
him to seek to persuade Mr. Pacollito co-investand, in that context, assured Mr. Ejupithat,
upon closure of the privatization procedure, the share ownership would be registered.?7!

Mr. Pacolli declined to participate.

Claimantstates that the bidding phase, slated for 18 January 2006, then had to be postponed
to the following month due to only one prospective bidder having shown interest.” In the
postponed procedure, there were several interested parties, including Makos Ltd, as well
as NTSH and UTC. Makos won the bid, with UTC placing second. However in March
2006, Makos withdrew from the tendering process and UTC became the winning bidder.

However, UTC did not have sufficient funds to make the payment due on 24 April 2006.
Mr. Ejupi testified that during the period in which Mr. Berisha had been required to pay
the purchase price, Mr. Shala visited Mr. Ejupi in his office.?? At that meeting, Mr. Shala
asked him to join the tender process, make the needed payment and assume the obligations
set out in the Commitment Agreement but, knowing the difficulty of meeting a EUR 8m
purchase price, again urged him to persuade Mr. Pacolli to participate as well. According
to Mr. Ejupi, in that conversation, he received assurances from Mr. Shala that he would
assist them in completing the required documentation.?™4 Mr. Pacolli ultimately agreed to
participate. It is at that point, in early April 2006, that Messrs. Ejupi, Pacolli and Berisha

had the meeting in Vienna described earlier (para. 166, supra) and an agreement to co-

invest was reached.”25 Claimant maintains that it is not at all unusual that no written report

of that meeting was produced.

Mr. Ejupi further testified that Mr. Shala meanwhile invited Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi to
accompany him to Croatia in an effort to attract other businesspeople to take part in the
overall Kosovo privatization project. But while in Croatia, they learned that there had been
a bomb threat at the Grand Hotel in Pristina, where Mr. Ejupi had established an office.?7°
According to Mr. Ejupi, Mr. Shala assured him that he need not worry about it.227 Mr.
Ejupi referred in his testimony to there being a lot of pressure at that time from powerful
parties in connection with the privatization, stating that upon their return from Croatia he
learned that there was pressure for the Grand Hotel shares in particular to be acquired by
persons whom Mr. Shala favored.??8 Mr. Ejupi reports that he and Mr. Pacollli then began
facing pressure to abandon ownership in the hotel, and that the KTA took action to impede
efforts by Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupito satisfy the KTA’s documentation requirements.229
Mr. Ejupi eventually requested that the funds that had been transferred be returned and that

the KTA allow whoever it wanted to become owner.?*?

Claimant rejects Respondent’s contention that these representations by Claimant contradict
earlier statements on his part, notably statements made in connection with Mr. Pacolli’s
lawsuit in the Municipal Court of Pristina. Claimant argues that Mr. Pacolli omitted
mention of Mr. Shala in that proceeding because he did not want to publicly accuse Mr.
Shala of wrongdoing, which also explains why Mr. Shala was not mentioned in Mr.
Pacolli’s 29 February 2012 letter to the PAK. Even so, Claimant states that Mr. Ejupi had
already by that time declared publicly that Mr. Shala was the person urging Mr. Ejupi to

invest,”3! so that it was no secret. Claimant observes that, Mr. Shala, who had taken the

lead in the privatization effort during difficult times in Kosovo, would have had no choice
but to approach them for help.”22 Claimant also rejects as inconsequential the fact that Mr.
Pacolli’s witness statement says that Mr. Shala first contacted Mr. Ejupi who then
contacted Mr. Pacolli, while Claimant’s Counter-Memorial says that Mr. Shala contacted

both Mr. Ejupiand Mr. Pacolli.

According to Claimant, Respondent more generally misrepresents the litigation in the
courts of Kosovo. Although the District Court reversed the Municipal Court’s ruling that
confirmed the co-ownership of the Grand Hotel shares, it did so not on the merits, but only
for clarification, in light of an apparent inconsistency, of whether the litigant was Mr.
Pacolli or the Mabetex Group. In its ruling, the court specifically acknowledged the
existence of a power of attorney,”** but sought confirmation as to the issuer of the power
of attorney and the party in favor of whom it was issued. According to Mr. Pacolli, he gave
the power of attorney to counsel in the case as CEO of the Mabetex Group.” As previously
noted,?35 on remand, the Municipal Court never decided the ownership question because
by then the shares had been withdrawn.” Claimant also observes that, notwithstanding
the testimony of Mr. Lluka to the contrary,3’ the KTA was necessarily aware of the
litigation from the very beginning in mid-2007 and did not first learn of it, as testified to
by Mr. Lluka, in March 2012. Asked why he and Mr. Pacolli brought suit in 2007 against
UTC, and not the KTA, Mr. Ejupi explained that it was because the KTA refused to
recognize them as investors.?3* Mr. Pacolli explained that the reason why he, as CEO of
Mabetex, rather than Claimant, initiated the proceedings was that Claimant was not

registered in Kosovo.”39

Claimant maintains that the PAK’s decision of 16 December 2011 to withdraw the shares
was illegal.24° It maintains, based on the agenda of the 16 December meeting and the
absence of documents concerning the buyer’s alleged delinquencies or the possibility ofa
share call option, that the purpose of the 16 December meeting was not in fact to make a
decision about the withdrawal of the shares. Claimant suggests that the meeting was in
fact held to consider whether to demand additional payments from Mr. Pacolli as bribes.4!
In its view, the PAK withdrew the shares, not due to non-fulfillment of the investment

commitments, but due to Mr. Pacolli’s unwillingness to be bribed.

In this regard, Claimant calls into question the PAK’s eventual justification for the
withdrawal of shares. It observes that between 2005 and 2016, the PKA exercised its share
call option in only four cases, including the Grand Hotel, even though only 39% of

privatized special spin-offs actually met their investment commitments. 742

On cross-examination, Mr. Pacolli disputed Mr. Shala’s account of their travel to Rwanda.
Accordingto Mr. Pacolli, at Mr. Shala’s request, he hosted a dinner athis home fora prayer
group coming from Washington, D.C., to which Mr. Shala belonged. At that dinner, Mr.
Shala mentioned that the prayer group was going next to Rwanda, and asked whether Mr.

Pacolli would like to join them.

Mr. Ejupi was questioned about his efforts to communicate with Mr. Shala in the weeks
preceding the hearing. Mr. Ejupi testified that the reason for that contact had nothing to do
with the Grand Hotel. Rather, as president of a football club, he was trying to acquire land
for that club, and knew that Mr. Shala had landholdings that might be available.*4+

*° Resp. Reply on Jurisd., paras. 110 ef seq. Respondent contends that the legality or illegality of the decision to

286. Whenasked why there was so little documentationofthe communications among the KTA,
Mr. Shala, on the one hand, and Messrs. Berisha, Pacolli and himself, on the other, Mr.
Ejupi explained that here was very little communication by email in Kosovo at that time,
and that parties communicated predominantly by telephone, as well as by meetings in
person since distances in the city are minimal, relying fundamentally on trust and the word
of honor in dealings among themselves.*45 He reported disappointment in Mr. Shala in that

regard.

287. More generally, Claimant urges that the witness statements of Behgjet and Selim Pacolli
not be discounted on account of their supposed self-interest. In Claimant’s view, what
matters is the tribunal’s assessment of the relevance and credibility of their testimony.746
Claimant further questions Respondent’s assertion that their witness testimony is
unsupported by documentary evidence. Without conceding a lack of documentation,
Claimant rejects the notion that witness testimony must be corroborated by documentary

evidence. 47

288. Asa matter of law, Claimant rejects Respondent’s contention that Kosovo law determines
whether an investment was made and when ownership came into being.248 More
specifically, it is irrelevant whether, under Kosovo law, Mr. Pacolli’s actions were or were
not attributable to Claimant.249 According to Claimant, Mr. Pacolli’s authority to represent
Claimant is governed by Swiss law, and under that law he is authorized to do so.?50
Claimantalso disputes Respondent’s interpretation of the Kosovolegislation governing the

registration of shares and corporate charters.*5!

At the hearing, the Tribunal, in view of the contradictions between their testimony,

conducted witness conferencing between Messrs. Pacolli and Shala.

During that conferencing, Mr. Pacolli recalled Mr. Shala stating the following at their

meeting in Tirana:

You have a luxury hotel. The hotels are in privatization now, Grand
Hotel and Iliria Hotel. You have all the opportunity, because you
have money, you have the hotel management, you have the
experience, and I— we need investments, and I would ask you to
invest in this sector.?°?

In reply to this assertion, Mr. Shala stated that, while he met with Mr. Pacolli in 1999, he
did not recall meeting with him at all in 2005, and that, in any event, he never requested
that Mr. Pacolli invest in the Grand Hotel.?5> If he were ever to make such a request, it
would only be before the bidding process had begun.?54 Mr. Shala stated that it is
significant that Mr. Pacolli never followed up on the alleged meeting with any
correspondence, and did not participate in the tender process. ”5> He described the tender

process as “100% bulletproof [from] manipulation.”?°°

At the witness conferencing, Mr. Pacolli asserted that present at the meeting in Tirana was
also Gazmend Abrashi. According to Mr. Pacolli, Mr. Abrashi was the winner in the first
round of bidding, but lacked both money and management experience, which is why Mr.
Shala invited him to co-invest with Mr. Abrashi.257 Ultimately, Mr. Abrashi withdrew his
bid though he proceeded with the other bid he had won, viz. the bid for another hotel, the
Hotel Iliria. But to do so he needed a contribution by Mr. Pacolli of EUR 3.6m, which Mr.

Pacolli made.?58 Mr. Pacolli thereafter purchased Mr. Abrashi’s share of the Hotel Iliria

and became its sole owner. ?5?

(c) The Tribunal’s Findings and Analysis

As noted, Respondent makes the following contentions with respect to Claimant’s alleged

investment:

a. Claimant never held any assets relating to the Grand Hotel.

b. Claimant’s payment of EUR 4m does not constitute evidence of an investment on
Claimant’s part.

c. Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the AGU.

d. Claimant did not become an owner of shares by virtue of the Annex Agreement.

Respondent’s basic position is that Claimant made no investment within the meaning of
the ICSID Convention, the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law, and that if any investment
was made, it was made only by Mr. Behgjet Pacolli in his individual capacity and not on
behalf of Claimant. In addressing the question whether Claimant made an investment,
within the meaning of the BIT, Foreign Investment Law and the ICSID Convention, each

of these instruments, due to their distinctive language, mustbe considered on its own terms.

a. Doesa claim of entitlement to ownership of shares require proof of actual
ownership?

Claimant is not entirely clear or consistent as to the exact nature of the investment it claims
to have acquired in respect of the Grand Hotel shares. On numerous occasions, it claims
that it acquired ownership of the shares.” Elsewhere, it suggests that it has a “beneficial”
interest in the shares,?®! though it does not elaborate on that assertion. Still elsewhere, it
leaves its interest somewhat indeterminate. In sum, Claimant’s characterization of its

investment lacks the clarity or consistency one might expect.

In this case, it is therefore less easy to identify the nature of the alleged investment than is
usually the case in investor-State arbitration. However, it is uncontested that, while
Claimant allegedly paid for the shares, it never received them and its ownership of them
was never registered.?6? Reading the record as a whole, and reconciling as best it can the
not entirely consistent ways in which Claimant characterizes its putative investment, the
Tribunal considers that Claimant is best understood as asserting that it acquired pursuant
to its arrangements with UTC and NTSH and over the extended period of dealings with the
KTA and thereafter the PAK, a claim of entitlement to ownership of the shares, and
therefore a right to their registration in its name and protection from their withdrawal. An
initial question before the Tribunal at this stage of the analysis is therefore whether that
claim qualifies as an investment within the meaning of Article 25.1 of the ICSID
Convention, Article 1(1) of the BIT and the relevant articles of the 2005 and 2014 Foreign
Investment Laws. The Tribunal examines the status of the alleged investment under each

of these instruments in turn.

(i) The ICSID Convention

Jurisdiction overa dispute under Article 25.1 of the ICSID Convention requires that the
dispute “aris[es] directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State ... and a
national of another Contracting State, which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to
submit to the Centre.” The Convention does not however define the term “investment.” It
does not therefore offer in itself a solid basis for determining whether or not a claim of
entitlement to ownership of shares requires proof of actual ownership. To make that
determination, one must lookatarbitral jurisprudence on the definition of investment under

the Convention.

Under one well-established line of arbitral case law, an asset does not qualify as an
investment under the ICSID Convention unless, cumulatively, it represents a substantial
capital contribution, entails a certain risk, and presents a certain duration. The award most

closely associated with these criteria is Salini Costruttori Sip.A & Italstrade S.p.A v.

© Cl. oralargum.,tr.27:10-11.

72

Kingdom of Morocco.?® The Salini tribunal also posited a fourth criterion, viz.,
contribution to the economic development of the host State,” but this criterion has, for
various reasons, since fallen significantly out of favor.2> A common view is that
contribution to the host State’s economy is not part of the ordinary meaning of
“investment” and is best viewed not as definitional of an investment, but as, at best, its

desired consequence.” The Tribunal is of that view.

297. The Salini test has been criticized as unduly rigid, and has by no means been followed by
all tribunals.2°’ However, since the Salini test is on the whole more demanding than the
alternative approaches that have been followed, and the Tribunal, as will be seen (para.
300), considers that test to have been met, the Tribunal need not examine the case through

the lens of those alternatives.

298. Respondent predicates its position on two basic assertions. First, having not acquired
ownership of the shares and having no direct contract with either the KTA or the PAK,
Claimant cannot maintain that it made an investment. Second, even if an investment was
made, itwould have been made by Mr. Pacolliin his personal capacity rather than on behalf
of the Claimant — in other words, Claimant was not the investor. If Claimant was not the
investor, then by definition it cannot satisfy the Salini test. It contributed no capital,

incurred no risk, invested for no duration and made no contribution to Kosovo’s economic

2 Other tribunals have imposed a furthera dditional requirement that an investment hold a promise of regular profit
and return. The Tribunal sees little warrant for imposing this additional requirement. A contribution of capital to a
business enterprise invariably implies an expectation of a regular profit and return. Dolzer & Schreuer describe
regularity of profit as “seldom considered relevant.” Exh. RL-50: Rudolf Dolzer & Christoph Schreuer, Principles of

development. The Tribunal must therefore decide whether an investment within the
meaning of the ICSID Convention was made and, if so, whether it was Claimant that made

it.

Taking the second issue first, the Tribunal finds, for reasons explained in detail below
(paras. 339-345, infra), that Mr. Pacolli took his actions on behalf of Mabco. For that
reason, in the discussion that follows, the Tribunal will impute the investment, if one was
made, to Claimant rather than Mr. Pacolli. It now turns to the Salini criteria, namely,
whether there was a contribution of capital, whether that contribution entailed a risk,
whether the putative investment had the requisite duration and, if required, whether it

would contribute to the economic development of Kosovo.

The Tribunal leaves aside at this point the specific question of whether, as Respondent
suggests (paras. 362-370, infra), any payment that was made was for the purchase of the
shares in the Grand Hotel. That said, the Tribunal has no difficulty finding that, based on
the Eur 4m payment, a contribution of capital was made. Turning to the question of risk,
the Tribunal notes that, at the relevant time, Kosovo had virtually no tourism industry and
development of a successful tourism industry couldnotbe assumed. The purchase of shares
in the Grand Hotel therefore necessarily entailed a risk. Nor is there any reason to suppose
that Claimant’s investment, if made, would not have sufficient duration. If Kosovo’s
tourism industry were to develop successfully, there is every reason to believe, based on
the prominence of the Grand Hotel, that the investment would continue, entailing ongoing
maintenance and management of the hotel.°8 In sum, the Tribunal finds that all three
criteria for which the Dissent (para. 21) cites the cases of Clorox v. Venezuela and Saba

Fakes v. Turkey — contribution of capital, risk and duration — are met in this case.

As for contribution to the economic development of the host State, the Tribunal, as noted,
joins those that have rejected it as a requirement. However, even were contribution to the

economic development of a host State to be required, that requirement would appear to be

met in the present case. Claimant and Respondentalike have subscribed to the view that
promotion of tourism represents a prime component of Kosovo’s economic development
policy and that no single facility stood to contribute more importantly to that policy than
the Grand Hotel in Kosovo’s capital, Pristina.2°° Accordingly, though in the Tribunal’s
view the ICSID Convention does not make protection of investment contingent on that
investment making a contribution to the host State’s economic development, any such

requirement, were it to be imposed, would be satisfied.
(ii) The BIT

Article 1(1) of the BIT defines an investmentas “every kind of asset established or acquired
by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party that
has such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other resources, the expectation of
gain or profit, or the assumption of risk.” Among others, such an asset may take the form
of:

(a) movable and immovable property as well as any related rights,
such as servitudes, mortgages, liens and pledges;

(b) a company, orshares, parts or any other kind of participation in
a company;

(c) claims to money or to any performance having an economic
value, except claims to money arising solely out of commercial
contracts for the sale of goods and services; ... [and]

(e) rights conferred pursuant to law, contract or decision of an
authority such as concessions, licences, authorizations and permits.

Article 1(2) defines “investor” to include “(b) a legal entity, including companies,
corporations, business associations and other organisations, which are constituted or
otherwise duly organised under the law of that Contracting Party and have their seat,

together with real economic activities, in the territory of the same Contracting Party.”

Article 11 of the BIT contemplates the arbitration of disputes “between an investor of a
Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former
made in the territory of the latter ... based on an alleged breach of obligations under [the

BIT].”

It is well-established that an asset, within the meaning of a BIT, may consist of an
intangible right, and that intangible rights are capable of being expropriated.” The BIT
in this case identifies several different intangibles as assets: “a company, or shares, parts
or any other kind of participation in a company;” “copyrights, industrial property rights ...
know-how and goodwill;” and “rights conferred pursuant to law, contract or decision of an

authority such as concessions, licences, authorizations and permits.”

Admittedly, intangibles as covered investments typically take the form of contracts and the
rights they confer.27! But, a claim need not be rooted in contract in order to be cognizable
as an investment. As the language of BIT Article 1(1) itself shows, intangibles qualifying
as assets take numerous forms. Nor are the intangibles identified in Article 1(1) themselves

to be viewed as the only qualifying intangibles.?”?

There is no reason why, in logic or
practice, intangibles taking other forms cannot be covered investments. The intangibles
listed in the BIT do not constitute a “closed set.” In sum, the Tribunal is not prepared to
exclude the possibility that a claim of entitlement cognizable in investor-State arbitration
can arise other than by contract or other than in the form of the specific intangibles

enumerated in Article 1(1).

The question therefore is whether the particular intangible that Claimant asserts — namely,

a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares — may constitute a covered investment.

Although the case law is sparse, the notion that non-contractual claims of entitlement may

constitute investments is clearly supported in the literature. Rudolf Dolzer & Christoph

Schreuer identify as common formsof investment, not only “rights conferred by contracts,”
but also “rights granted by the general laws,”273 and in the present case Mabco precisely
bases its claim on its right to registration of shares under the law of Kosovo. According to
Zachary Douglas, a claim to money can qualify as an investment provided that it “entail[s]
a ‘transfer of resources into the economy of the host state by the claimant entailing the
assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial return.””?”4 As already found, the
investment claimed by Mabco satisfies these criteria: it entails a transfer of resources into
the economy of Kosovo with the attendant risk to which Douglas refers. The Tribunal is
accordingly not prepared to exclude fully the possibility that a claim of entitlement to
ownership of shares under certain circumstances is cognizable as a qualifying

investment.?75

In fact, Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT identifies a specific category of intangibles into which
the asset Claimant invokes in this case comfortably falls. Claimant is literally asserting a
“claim[] to [a] performance having an economic value.” within the meaning of BIT Article
1(1)(c). It not only claims an entitlement to ownership; it claims a performance, viz.
registration in its name of the shares it allegedly purchased. The Tribunal finds that this
constitutes a claim to a performance having an economic value, under Article 1(1)(c).
Significantly, the category of claims that Article 1(1)(c) specifically excludes from
coverage is “claims to money arising solely out of commercial contracts for the sale of
goods and services” (emphasis added). Mabco’s claim in this case is by no means reducible

to a claim based solely on a mere “sale of goods and services.”

It is useful, in assessing Mabco’s claim of having madea qualifying investment, to compare
the present case with a variation on it. Imagine that Claimant, under otherwise identical

circumstances, had participated in the tender process, had made the winning bid and, let

3 Dolzer & Schreuer, supra note 264, p. 64.

Turkey, Decision on Jurisdiction, 1 1 1CSID Reports 434 (4 June 2004) (Exh. CL-5). Douglascites the Germany Model
BIT which treats as a form of investment “claims to money which hasbeen used to createan economic value or chims
to any performance having an economic value.”

275 Tt is also somewhat troubling that a claim alleging a failure to register purchased shares can be defeated on the
ground that, precisely because the shares were unregistered, a claim of entitlement to their ownership cannot constitute
an investment.

us say, had made payment in full for the shares. Imagine further that the KTA or PAK
nevertheless refused to register the shares in Claimant’s name. Under that hypothesis, just
as in the present case, Claimant would not receive the shares and would not be officially
recorded as their owner. If Claimant then initiated arbitration, it would best describe its
asset precisely as a claim ofentitlementto ownership of the shares, and this Tribunal would
have little hesitation in treating that claim as a qualifying investment. The Tribunal does

not see any warrant in treating the present case any differently.

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that, depending on the circumstances, a claim of entitlement
to an asset is itself capable of constituting an investment under the BIT, provided that, as
the Dissent rightly says (para. 18), it was “established or acquired.” In the Tribunal’s view,

Mabco’s claim of entitlement was both established and acquired.

At the same time, a claim of entitlement, such as that advanced by Claimant, does not of
course in itself amount to an entitlement, any more than that an assertion of contractual
rights amounts to actual contractual rights. Whether Claimant actually has that entitlement

remains to be seen.
(iii) The Foreign Investment Law

Given the fact that both the 2005 and 2014 Foreign Investment Law have application in

part to this case, the Tribunal examines them both.

Under Article 2(1) of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law, an “investment dispute” is “any
dispute between a foreign investor and a public authority relating (i) to an investment in
Kosovo made by such foreign investor.” Article 2(1) specifies thatan “investment dispute”

includes, among other things, disputes relating to:
c. the making or attempt to make an investment in Kosovo.

An “investment” is defined in part under Article 2(1) the 2005 Foreign Investment Law as
any asset that has “been contributed to a Kosovo business organization in return for an

ownership interest in that business organization.” Assets in turn are defined in part as:

78

316.

317.

a. movable and immovable property, including rights in and to such
property such as a mortgage, lien, pledge, lease or servitude;

b. intangible and intellectual property, including rights in and to
such property, as well as goodwill, technical processes and know
how;

c. cash, securities, commercial paper, guarantees, shares of stock
or other types ofownership interests in a Kosovo or foreign business
organization; bonds, debentures, other debt instruments;

d. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance
under contract; [and]

e. concessions or licenses conferred by law, administrative action,
or contract, ...

In the Tribunal’s view, Mabco’s claim of entitlement in the case falls comfortably within
Article 2(1) of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law. This enumeration establishes that, like
the BIT, the Foreign Investment Law specifically contemplates intangibles as assets
amenable to treatment as investments. Moreover, Article 2(1) specifically identifies,
“claims ... to ... performance” as among the assets capable of constituting an investment.
While Article 2(1) specifically refers to “claims ... to ... performance under contract,” the
Tribunal, for reasons set out above in connection with the BIT, is not prepared to exclude

from coverage claims to performance on legal grounds other than contract stricto sensu.

The Tribunal refers back to its discussion, in connection with the BIT, of the support in the
literature for the proposition that investments may take the form, notonly ofcontractrights,
but more generally of rights granted under national law,?76 and may entail “a ‘transfer of
resources into the economy of the host state by the claimant entailing the assumption of
risk in expectation of acommercial return.’”2”7 As earlier observed, the investment claimed
by Mabco may fairly be characterized as a claim of right under law as well as a transfer of

resources into the economy of Kosovo with the attendant risk to which Douglas refers. As

321.

322.

noted, Article 2(1) also defines an “investment dispute” to include a dispute relating to “c.

the making or attempt to make an investment in Kosovo” (emphasis added).

The Tribunal accordingly considers a claim of entitlement to ownership of shares to be
cognizable as a qualifying investment, although once again that entitlement must

eventually be established as a merits matter.

Much the same analysis applies to the definition of an investment under Article 2.1.4 of
the 2014 Foreign Investment Law, which defines an “investment” to include, among other
things:

1.4.3. cash, securities, commercial paper, guarantees, shares of

stock or other types of ownership interests in ... the Republic of

Kosovo or foreign business organization; bonds, debentures, other
debt instruments;

1.4.4. claims or rights to money, goods, services, and performance

under contract...
Article 2.1.4.4 repeats verbatim Article 2(1)(d) of the 2005 Law (“claims or rights to
money, goods, services, and performance under contract’), which the Tribunal found to

be capable of encompassing Mabco’s claim of entitlement to shares in this case.?”8

The Tribunal thus finds that, depending of course on the circumstances, a claim of
entitlement to an asset is itself capable of constituting an investment. To borrow Zachary
Douglas’ phrase, it “entail[s] a ‘transfer of resources into the economy of the host state by

the claimant entailing the assumption of risk in expectation of a commercial return.””

b. Has Claimant adduced sufficient evidence of its entitlement to ownership
of the Grand Hotel shares for it to constitute a claim of entitlement worthy
of protection under the BIT and/or Foreign Investment Law?

Assuming an asset in the form of a claim of entitlement can under some circumstances
constitute an investment, as the Tribunal has found, the question then arises whether

Claimant, under the circumstances of this case, has established such a claim. It bears

278 Supra, para. 317.

80

323.

324.

repeating that it is not necessary that Claimant at this stage establish that it actually has an
entitlement to the Grand Hotel shares. That remains an open question. At the same time, it
certainly cannot suffice at the jurisdictional stage, for purposes of demonstrating a claim
of entitlement, merely to articulate such a claim. In the Tribunal’s view, any such claim
must be a colourable one, i.e., must be at the very least arguable. In the Tribunal’s view,
what may be demandedatthis stage is whatmay be called aprima facie showing, by which
is meant a showing sufficient to find the asserted claim sufficiently plausible. That

apparently is Respondent’s view as well.2”

The Tribunal finds that, by this standard, Claimant has made the necessary showing.
Claimant’s argumentation is admittedly less than linear. Neither the KTA nor the PAK
entered into any formal agreement with Claimant for its acquisition of the shares, and so
Claimant’s entitlement cannot be predicated on any agreement with Respondent or its
agencies. Rather, in orderto make a prima facie judgment on this score, the Tribunal in
this case must piece together words and conduct — in a word, circumstances — taking place
over a significant period of time, running between 2005/2006 and 2012 so as to produce a

reasonable claim of entitlement.

Claimant relies heavily on the proposition that Mr. Shala, upon finding that UTC, the
winning bidder, could not pay the required price, expressly invited Claimant to participate
in UTC’s acquisition of ownership of the shares.28° Mr. Ejupi testified that Mr. Shala
approached him twice in 2006 (once at the outset of the bidding process and later upon Mr.
Berisha’s failure to pay the share purchase price), specifically urging him to recruit Mr.
Pacolli as co-purchaser of Grand Hotel shares.?8! Even so, the Tribunal has difficulty
lending substantial credence to this assertion. Not only is there no documentary evidence

in the record of any such agreement, which one would normally expect, but Mr. Pacolli’s

327.

forceful assertion to this effect was met by Mr. Shala’s equally forceful denial.?*? In an
effort to arrive at a finding on this point, the Tribunal conducted a witness conferencing in
which Messrs. Pacolli and Shala were jointly examined and directly confronted one
another.?83 The Tribunal found that exercise to be inconclusive. 84 In any event, even if the
issuance of such an invitation could be established, it alone would not suffice to create a
colourable claim to entitlement to the Grand Hotel shares. A mere invitation to bid, whether
via a tender offer or otherwise, signifies little more than the inviting party’s willingness to

contemplate the possibility of an acquisition by the invitee.

Moreover, the Purchase Agreement for privatization of the Grand Hotel was concluded
between UTC and the KTA, not between Claimant and the KTA. Additionally, the
Purchase Agreement required UTC to declare that it was “purchasing the Shares for its
own use and notas an agent fora third party and [that], during the tender forthis Company,
the Buyer has not formed any informal or formal undisclosed agreements or consortiums

between two or more bidders or with any undisclosed third party.”285

These circumstances weaken Claimant’s assertion of a claim of entitlement to registration
of the shares. However, other circumstances of the case, viewed in their totality, point in

an opposite direction.

Most basic is the fact of Claimant’s transfer via NTSH and UTC to the KTA of the sum of
Eur 4m for the hotel shares. UTC, which had won the bid for the Grand Hotel but lacked
the resources necessary to pay the contract price, engaged Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi of
NTSH in discussions with a view to their participation in the acquisition of the shares. The

parties reached an agreement at a meeting in Vienna in early April 2006 devoted to the

MR. FERRARO: My first question is: have you two ever met to discuss the
opportunity of investment in the Grand Hotel in Pristina?

purchase of the Grand Hotel shares, specifically on the understanding that Claimant and
NTSH would contribute Eur 4m and Eur 1m, respectively, for that purpose, that Mr.
Berisha would manage the project fora period of two years, at which point Claimant and
NTSH would become legal owners of the shares, and that Mr. Pacolli, would make all
investments required to meet the owners’ commitments under the Purchase A greement.286
Claimant gave KTA a guarantee of payment of the Eur 20.2m that the KTA required prior
to signing the Purchase Agreement with UTC in August 2006,?87 and in January 2007 the
AGU formalized that undertaking. 288

328. Clearly, the KTA was nota party to the AGU and is not bound by it. However, the existence
and terms of the AGU do adequately establish the purposes of the transfer of Eur 4m to the
KTA (via UTC). Respondent calls attention to the fact, as discussed more fully below
(para. 348, infra), that the Eur 4m transfer was made prior to the meeting in Vienna and
conclusion of the AGU. But it is not unreasonable to suppose that that transfer was made
in anticipation of a formal agreement among UTC, NTSH and Mabco to be made

thereafter.

329. The question whether and to what extent this transfer in particular supports Mabco’s claim
of entitlement to share ownership in the Grand Hotel is discussed in greater detail in the
following section. As will be seen there (paras. 362-370, infra), the Tribunal finds that the

transfer was made by Mabco for purposes of acquiring the Grand Hotel shares.

330. There is no documentary evidence specifically establishing that, as Claimant maintains, the
KTA or PAK was aware at an early point in time of the transfer of moneys by Claimant
and the reasons for it,?8? and there are inconsistent assertions as to when the KTA or PAK

learned of the AGU in particular.?°° Respondent maintains that the KTA and PAK were

unaware that Claimant had invested Eur 4m in the Grand Hotel prior to 2012,29! and Mr.
Lluka testified in support of that contention.2°2 However, there are circumstances
suggesting otherwise. First, when Claimant’s first attempt to pay the EUR 4m failed, and
NTSH was required to return the funds to Mabco, the letter from the Kosovo Central Bank
(BPK) to Mabco reporting that its initial transfer of funds was unsuccessful was copied to
the KTA.?3 As far as the Tribunal can tell, the KTA did not express any question or
concern about the fact that the funds were being paid by a party other than the winning
bidder, much less give any other indication that it thought the payment was irregular or

ineffective.

Additionally, Claimantbroughtsuitagainst UTC in the Municipal Courtof Pristina in June
2007 and that court’s judgment in Claimant’s favour was the subject of appeal by UTC and
ultimately reversed on 28 May 2010. (Notably, the appeals court did not make a ruling on
the merits of Mabco’s claim. Rather, it remanded the case to the Municipal Court fora
determination of whether the Claimant or Mr. Pacolli had standing to sue. The Municipal
Court never made that determination because the case had been overtaken by events.) It is

improbable that the KTA was ignorant of that litigation or the identity of the parties to it.

It is not possible on the record to determine exactly when Claimant’s purchase of the shares
became known to the KTA or PAK. But the circumstances, taken together, suggest that the
KTA and PAK likely had knowledge of the transfer by 2007 or 2008. According to the
record, only in October 2011, when Selim Pacolli, upon hearing that the PAK was
considering withdrawing the shares, contacted the PAK urging it not to do so, did the PAK

deny that Claimant had any ownership interest in the shares.2°4

Over a period of several months early in 2012, years after receiving Claimant’s Eur 4m
contribution, the PAK had communications and held meetings with Mr. Pacolli, in which

it advised him that once he produced certain specific documents, the shares would be

officially registered under Claimant’s name.2°° It is uncontested that Mr. Pacolli provided

all the requested documentation.2%

Claimant did of course have a contractual relationship with UTC and, on that basis, a cause
of action against UTC. Indeed that was the basis for Mr. Pacolli’s litigation against UTC
in the Kosovo courts.?%7 On the other hand, it had no contractual relationship with the KTA
or PAK, and no basis for asserting a contract claim against them. When Claimant did bring
suit against the PAK, in the SCSC and later in the Constitutional Court, it did not argue
that PAK had a contractual obligation to register the shares, but rather effectively an
obligation in law. However, neither the existence of a contract claim against UTC nor the
absence of a contract claim against either the KTA or the PAK negates the existence of a
non-contractual claim against the PAK. Nor can the present dispute fairly be described as
purely “private” relationship to which the KTA and PAK were mere bystanders, and
therefore not cognizable under a BIT or foreign investment law. Although the agreement
among UTC, NTSH and Claimant is central to the present dispute, no less central is
Claimant’s relationship with the public authorities of Kosovo, if only because only the
KTA and thereafter the PAK had the public authority to take the actions that lie at the heart
of this dispute, namely, authority to register shares that had been purchased and authority
to withdraw shares in a company to which, through privatization, the State had transferred

public property.

It is not accurate to portray this case as one in which Claimant merely “sought” or
“attempted” to make an investment.’ In the Tribunal’s view, this is not an apt way of
characterizing Claimant’s position in this case. As will be developed more fully below,

Claimant actually purchased the shares in question, the KTA became aware of that fact and

eventually stated on several occasions stated that only certain documents, which Claimant
promptly supplied, were required in order for the shares to be registered in Claimant’s
name. (According to the allegations, the only thing that stood between that undertaking on
the PAK’s part and formal registration of the shares was Claimant’s refusal, on several
occasions, to pay a bribe.) Claimant did a great deal more than “attempt” to make an

investment.

Nor does the Tribunal’s finding of an investment in the present case by any means signify
that every trans-border capital movement suffices to qualify as an investment. The Tribunal
agrees with Counsel for Respondent in oral argument that “an investment is not just a
transfer of money,”%? but rather “an asset acquired by the investor as a result of [a]
contribution.”>°° However, this case cannot be reduced to a mere “transfer of money” or
characterized as “any claim to obtain whatever has been contractually stipulated,” as the
Dissent suggests (paras. 20, 29). This was no “garden-variety” contract, much less the
paradigmatic “one-off” sale transaction that all would agree cannot qualify as an
investment.*°! The relationship between Claimant, on the one hand, and KTA and PAK,
on the other, represented vastly more than that. What resulted from the relationships in this
case was nothing less than a joint venture entailing all the characteristics of an investment:
a contribution of capital in contemplation of gain or profit, an assumption of risk, a
significant duration and even, if necessary, a contribution to the economic development of
Kosovo. The Tribunal thus cannot agree with the Dissent’s suggestion (para. 41) that
findingas we do “render{s] the distinction between a contract obligation and an investment

largely meaningless.”

Insum, the Tribunal finds that, solely for the purpose of establishing jurisdiction ona prima
facie basis, and without prejudice to any decision on the merits, there is a colourable basis
for Mabco’s contention that it had a claim of entitlement against Respondent for

registration of the shares in its name and for reversal of the order of withdrawal of the

340.

shares, and that claim, under the circumstances of this case, may be regarded as an

investment.

c. Assuming a claim of entitlement in this case is sufficiently established, is it
a claim that can be asserted by Claimant?

In the preceding discussion, the Tribunal has, for simplicity, repeatedly referred to a claim
of entitlement to shares on Claimant’s part. But of course Respondent forcefully argues
(paras. 293-338, supra) that it is not Claimant that engaged with the KTA and PAK, on the
one hand, and with UTC and NTSH, on the other, with a view to ownership of the Grand
Hotel shares, but rather Mr. Pacolli in his individual capacity — with the result that any
investment that could possibly have been made would have been made by Mr. Pacolli

personally and not by Claimant. >

The Tribunal of course agrees that in order to establish jurisdiction, it must find that, in
taking his actions, Mr. Pacolli acted on behalf of Claimant. On this, the record is spotty. In
the great majority of the documents and communications relative to Mr. Pacolli’s
engagement either with the KTA or PAK, on the one hand, and with Messrs. Berisha and
Ejupi, on the other, Mr Pacolli signed and otherwise referred to himself in his own name.
That regularity has naturally created some doubt in the Tribunal’s thinking that he was

acting on these occasions in the name of Mabco.

That said, the Tribunal cannot ultimately conclude that, when Mr. Pacolli took the steps he
did, he did so on his own account. First, it is not the case that Mr. Pacolli invariably, over
the relevant period of time, wrote no correspondence and entered into no agreement in the
name of Claimant. In the lawsuit brought against UTC in 5 June 2007,°% the plaintiff was
identified as “Behgjet Pacolli from Prishtina, president of c.e.o MABETEX GROUP.”
Another example is the letter of guarantee — dated 3 August 2008 — sent by Mr. Pacolli to

UTC’s bank (which expressly refers to the Grand Hotel acquisition and mentions Mabco,

among other companies of Mabetex group).3°4 The 28 March 2012 letter to PAK35 was
signed by Mr. Selim Pacolli on behalf of Mabetex. Further, when Selim Pacolli signed the
Annex Agreement, dated 28 March 2012,3 he identified himself as “representing Mr.
Behxhet Pacolli, acting on behalf of the company ‘MABETEX’ and in his personal name.”
For reasons given below (paras. 382-383, infra), the Tribunal does not, as Respondent
urges,*°’ find the reference to Mabetex, rather than Mabco, disqualifying. Mabetex was
nothing more than a group of separate companies, among them Mabco, and among those
companies, Mabco was apparently the one that would have been charged with a project
such as the project in the present case.*°8 Thus, for all practical purposes, any reference to
Mabetex in the context of the present dispute signified a reference to Mabco. Indeed, if, as
Respondent suggests, Mr. Pacolli was at all times acting solely for himself, there would be

no reason to reference Mabetex at all.30

the correspondence plainly come in Mabco’s name as such. Notably, in the 20 June 2012
letter to PAK,#!° Mr. Pacolli is referred to as “a legal representative of MABETEX GROUP
—workingunit MABCO CONSTRUCTION S.A. headquartered in Lugano, Switzerland.”
Respondent suggests, and the Dissent agrees (para. 52), that this was done in order to make

of the BIT which had only just entered into force. The Tribunal agrees that that is no

coincidence. But it is nota suspicious one. The 20 June communication appears to be the
very first correspondence with the KTA or PAK that came from counsel for Claimant,
rather than Mr. Pacolli individually. According to Claimant, Mr. Pacolli engaged counsel
at that point in time because the PAK had then just announced its decision to execute
withdrawal of the shares.3!! It should come as no surprise that counsel appreciated, far
better than Mr. Pacolli in the past had, that in order for the action to be maintained, the
claim had to be presented in Claimant’s name. Therefore, in the Tribunal’s view, it does
not follow from the appearance of a reference to Mabco on 20 June 2012 that the claim
was not Mabco’s claim before that date and that it became Mabco’s claim only then. The
Tribunal cannot conclude that, in that correspondence, Mr. Pacolli and counsel were
suddenly “converting” a claim belonging at all times to Mr. Pacolli into a claim belonging

to Mabco.

The only testimony presented on whether Mr. Pacolli was acting on his own or in a
representative capacity, supports the Tribunal’s conclusion. Mr. Ejupi testified more
generally, but unequivocally, that the consistent practice in Kosovo was precisely for
individuals to use their own names in representing their companies, particularly
individuals, like Mr. Pacolli, of especially high prominence.*!? Mr. Ejupi was not cross-
examined on this matter, nor did Respondent adduce any evidence challenging Mr, Ejupi’s
account of the practice in Kosovo. Similarly, Mabco’s Chief Financial Officer, Lucina
Maesani-Gaiatto, testified that, as an objective matter, business was conducted in that way
in Kosovo, as a result of which, when Mr. Pacolli negotiated and signed agreements, he
was understood as doing so on behalf of the relevant entity within the Mabetex group,
which in the construction and engineering sector would have been Mabco.3!3 Again,
though it would have been possible, through witness testimony, to challenge Ms. Maesani-
Gaiatto’s account of business practices in Kosovo, no effort to challenge her testimony was
made. While the Dissent disagrees (paras. 43, 47), the Tribunal finds that, if in fact the

practice in Kosovo was for businesspersons to use their own name when speaking for the

business entities they own and control — and all the testimony in this case supports that
understanding — that practice cannot and should not be ignored. This is not altered by the

fact that Mr. Pacolli was “experienced.”

But there are more direct indications that, in the underlying transactions, Mr. Pacolli was
representing Mabco and not himself as an individual. Of none of these is there any dispute.
First, the Eur 4m transfer was made out of Mabco’s own bank account.?!4 Second, it was
reflected on Mabco’s balance sheets and confirmed by Mabco’s external auditor.3!5 Third,
the decision to invest in Kosovo a significant amount of monies was brought before and

voted upon by Mabco’s shareholders, which adopted a resolution to that effect.3!6

The Tribunal concludes that, notwithstanding Mr. Pacolli’s having very often used his own

name rather than Mabco’s, the investment was in fact Mabco’s.

(2) CLAIMANT’S PAYMENT OF EUR 4M DOES NOT CONSTITUTE EVIDENCE OF AN
INVESTMENT ON CLAIMANT'S PART

(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent contends that no link has been established between Claimant’s payment of
EUR 4m and its alleged investment in the Grand Hotel. It finds no reference, in connection
with the transfer, to the Grand Hotel privatization. Additionally, in the domestic court
proceeding referred to earlier (para. 218, supra,), Mr. Pacolli mentions that he made the

payment but makes no mention of Claimant in that connection.3!7

In that proceeding, evidence was introduced ofa transfer dated 27 April 2006 of EUR 4m
from Kosovo Airlines, not Claimant, to NTSH in connection with the privatization process,

for which no explanation was given. Respondent also asks why no evidence of a 28 April

2006 transfer was introduced in the Kosovo court actions. 3!8 Respondent concludes that
payments to the KTA for the shares were made only by UTC and NTSH, and not by
Claimant. Respondent also speculates that the EUR 4m transfer may have been made in
connection with a transaction having nothing to do with the Grand Hotel. It notes that, at
the time of the Grand Hotel privatization, the KTA was conducting a tender process for
privatization of Hotel Iliria, in which Behgjet and Selim Pacolli participated, as did Ms.

Ejupi on behalf of NTSH.3!9

Respondent also raises a question of timing. The EUR 4m payment was made in April
2006, but the AGU was only concluded in January 2007, i.e. 8 months later. Indeed, the
Purchase Agreement between UTC and the KTA, dated 10 August 2006, was not yet even
concluded.3”° Thus, the payment could not have had investment in the Grand Hotel as its
object. Moreover, the deadline set by the KTA for payment of the purchase price by UTC
and the date when that payment was made was 24 April 2006, a date that had already passed
by the time of the alleged 28 April 2006 transfer.32! Furthermore, in a letter of 29 February
2012,322 Mr. Pacolli stated that he met Mr. Berisha for the first time in Vienna in the
summer of 2006. That means that investment in the Grand Hotel cannot have been the
purpose of the 28 April 2006 transfer of funds on which Claimant relies as evidencing its

investment.3?3

Respondent observes a number of other peculiarities surrounding the transfer.324 Thus,
although Mr. Pacolli purports to have transferred EUR 4m in contribution to the purchase

price of the shares, the actual transfer was not in that amount, but rather in the amount of

EUR 5,014,876.00, in two instalments of EUR 4,01 1,676.00225 and EUR 1,003,200.00.32
The latter figures appear in various letters by Selim Pacolli,32” which, Respondent points
out, refer to the privatization of the Grand Hotel but not to a 28 April 2006 transfer. More
particularly, the transfers of 4,01 1,676.00 and EUR 1,003,200.00 are shownas having been
made to UTC by NTSH, not by Claimant. The alleged transfer of 28 April 2006 is
unmentioned either in Behgjet Pacolli’s 29 February 2012 letter orin the letters from Selim

Pacolli.

In short, Respondent’s position is that Claimant made no investment in the Grand Hotel,
whether for purposes of the ICSID Convention, the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law.
Fundamentally, Claimant made no capital contribution, as required to constitute an
investment, under all three instruments. Having made no capital contribution, Claimant
neither incurred any risk, nor made an investment of the requisite duration, nor generated
a profit or return, nor contributed to Kosovo’s economic development.?8 Thus, the

requirements for an investment under the ICSID Convention were unmet.

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant disagrees. It maintains that the factual link between Claimant’s payment of EUR
4m and its agreement to invest in the Grand Hotel is “evident.’”229 At the same time,
Respondent’s various representations and doubts concerning the transfer of funds are
baseless. It is untrue, according to Claimant, that UTC transferred the purchase price to the
KTA on the due date of 24 April 2006 and that by then the KTA had received all amounts
due. In truth, by 24 April, only part of the purchase price had been paid. The KTA received
payment in full only on 2 May 2006,3°°

Claimant explains the chronology more specifically as follows.

The Tender Rules required UTC, as winning bidder, to pay the purchase price to the
designated bank account within a very short period, i.e., 20 days after being notified that it
had won the bid.33! Having agreed with UTC and NTSH to co-invest, and knowing that
payment in full was due on 24 April 2006, Claimant paid its agreed upon contribution of
EUR 4m prior to that date, viz. on 20 April 2006. Claimant’s CFO, Lucina Maesani-
Gaiatto, testified that, in order to do so, Claimant asked its affiliate, Interfin, which owed
payment to Claimant ona loan in the amount of EUR 6,997,500.00 on an unrelated matter,
to make the EUR 4m payment to NTSH on its behalf.332 This Interfin did the following
day.333 NTSH then transferred the sum of EUR 4,011,676.00 by wire to UTC. The wire
contained the following notation: “PAY ACCORDING TO CONTR. DT. 18.04.06 FOR
PRIVATIZATION ACCORDING TO REFERENCE P-78.”334 Claimant notes that “P-78”
was a specific reference to the Grand Hotel share transactions. Again, on the same day,

UTC then ordered payment of a total sum of EUR 7,661,250 to the KTA (that sum

reflecting an advance deposit of EUR 500,000 already made). 335 On 24 April, the KTA
should have received payment in full. However, what the KTA received on 24 April was
not actually a transfer of that sum of money, but only a notice of a transfer order,”>*° and
the amount of money that the KTA actually received, as a result of the transfer, appears to
have been the sums of EUR 3,661,000 and EUR 196,656, as shown by the KTA’s statement

for the Grand Hotel account for the relevant period.**”

353. Claimant explains why the KTA received on 24 April a notice of transfer order in an
amount of EUR 7,661,250, but actually received only the sum of EUR 3,661,000.338 What
happened was that the Banking and Payment Authority had rejected the payment of EUR
4m that had been made by Interfin on behalf of Claimant. Ina letter to Claimant of 25 April
2006, copied to the KTA, the Authority attributed the rejection to the fact that Interfin did
not hold a license to perform financial activities in Kosovo.39 As a result, the EUR
4,01 1,676.00 was returned by NTSH to Interfin on 26 April 2006, and on the same day by

Interfin to Claimant. +40

354. On 27 April 2006, Claimant then reordered the transfer, this time from its own account,
but in this second attempt mistakenly had it sent to UTC not via NTSH, but via an NTSH
affiliate, viz. Kosova Airlines.*4! Upon receiving the funds back on 28 April 2006,

Claimant on the same day transferred them directly to NTSH,3? as reflected in the Swiss

Interbank Clearing (SIC) payment system3 and confirmed by Claimant’s account
statements, 344 as well as by Claimant’s external auditor.*45 Then NTSH in turn forwarded
the funds to UTC, a transaction confirmed by NTSH’s account statement.*° Finally, on
29 April 2006, UTC transferred the sum of EUR 4,011,000 to the KTA’s Grand Hotel bank
account.347 Due to an intervening bank holiday and weekend, the credit only appeared in
that account on 2 May 2006. Internal KTA communications confirm that the additional
EUR 4,011,000 was indeed received and credited on 2 May 2006.348 According to

Claimant, Mr. Berisha confirmed this entire chain of events by letter dated 19 June 2006.49

355. Accordingto Claimant, Respondentthus misrepresented this chronology, a chronology that
clearly establishes Claimant’s payment of EUR 4,011,000 as part of the Grand Hotel
purchase price. More specifically, at the time Claimant’s payment was made, the full
purchase price had notbeen fully paid. Itonly became fully paid when Claimant’s payment

appeared in the KTA’s Grand Hotel bank account on 2 May 2006.

356. The KTA could not have failed to know that Claimant was participating in the purchase of
shares so as to enable UTC to fulfill its obligations as successful bidder under the Purchase
Agreement. First, when the bank rejected the transfer of moneys made through Interfin, it
so stated in a letter to Mr. Pacolli, copied to Selim Pacolli and the KTA.*°° Also the
EUR 4m was thereafter, on 2 May 2006, credited to the KTA’s own account.35! The

chronology is also fully consistent with the AGU, the agreement by which Claimant

formalized its undertaking to make the necessary investment and comply with the

obligations under the Commitment Agreement.

As forthe source of the EUR 4m, Mr. Pacolli testified that though he arranged the payment,
the funds, as shown by Claimant’s balance sheets and bank account, came from Claimant’s
account.352 Further, the transaction had to be, and was, approved by resolution of the

Claimant’s Board of Directors.**

Also according to Claimant, in early August 2006 and days before the Purchase Agreement
was signed, Mr. Pacolli, on behalf of his group of companies, committed by letterto UTC’s
bank to guarantee the investments in the Grand Hotel in the amount of EUR 20,2m that
was required under the Commitment Agreement,3* stating that “[t]he required investment
and operating costs concerning Grand Hotel New Co located in Pristina will be provided
by me personally and the group of my companies ... as listed.” 355 The guarantee appears

to have been actually provided on 21 March 2012.356

Claimant calls attention to the negotiations that took place between Claimant and the PAK
in the period of January through March 2012.35” The correspondence surrounding those
discussions demonstrates that the PAK was quite aware that Claimant and NTSH had paid

part of the purchase price.

In his testimony, Mr. Ejupi describes as “absurd” Respondent’s suggestion that the

paymentmade by Claimant to NTSH was forany purpose other than purchase of the Grand

Hotel shares. 358 He affirms that the payment was unquestionably made for that purpose,
and, in doing so, confirms Mr. Pacolli’s account of the difficulties encountered in the

process of making the payment, as recounted in paragraphs 353-355, supra.>°?

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

In respect of the 2006 Eur 4m transfer, Respondent’s position is three-fold. First, though
there is no dispute that the Eur 4m payment was made by Mabco, there is insufficient
evidence that it was made for purposes of acquiring the Grand Hotel shares. Second, the
sequence of events casts serious doubt on the transfer of funds having the purpose that

Claimant attributes to it. Third, the process of payment itself was irregular.

a. Is the Eur4m payment attributable to the purchase of Grand Hotel shares?
Respondent casts doubt on the notion that the Eur 4m transfer was made for the purpose of
acquiring the Grand Hotel shares. Although the evidence of that could certainly have been
clearer, the Tribunal does not share Respondent’s doubts. Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto testified
without contradiction that when the BPK rejected Mabco’s initial transfer of funds to
NTSH, its explanatory letter to Mabco specified Mabco as the source of the funds, and that
letter was copied to the KTA.3® Moreover, the onward transfer from NTSH to UTC bore
the notation “PAY ACCORDING TO CONTR. DT. 18.04.06 FOR PRIVATIZATION
ACCORDING TO REFERENCE P-78.” 36! It is uncontested that “P-78” was a specific
reference to the Grand Hotel share transactions. (The record in the case does not appear to
contain an exhibit of the onward transfer from UTC to KTA.) This evidence cannot be

characterized, as the Dissent suggests (para. 41), as “circumstantial.”
Nor is there evidence to suggest that those moneys were thereafter transferred elsewhere.

These are good indications of the purpose for which the transfer was made, and Respondent

offers no serious alternative explanation for it. The closest it comes to doing so is to raise

366.

the possibility that the funds were transferred for the purpose of acquiring shares in a
different hotel, the Hotel Iliria. But this, by Respondent’s own admission, is without any

documentation, and represents sheer conjecture.

b. Is the chronology consistent with payment for purchase of the shares?
Second, Respondent regards the chronology of events as inconsistent with the notion that
Mabco made its payment for the purported purposes. However, the Tribunal cannot infer
from the fact that the Eur 4m payment preceded conclusion of the AGU by 8 months that
the payment had nothing to do with acquisition of the Grand Hotel shares. It is not
inconceivable that Mabco would make the payment before arrangements among UTC,
NTSH and Mabco became formalized, as long as those arrangements were in fact in place.
Noris it problematic thatthe paymentalso preceded conclusionof the Purchase Agreement
between UTC and the KTA. Once the Purchase Agreement was formally concluded, UTC
was immediately required to pay the purchase price into the KTA’s designated escrow
account. It is not remarkable that Mabco would seek to ensure that UTC immediately had

the requisite funds for the purchase.

Respondent observes that, in a letter dated 29 February 2012, Mr. Pacolli reported meeting
Mr. Berisha for the firsttime in Vienna in the summer of 2006,3 the suggestion being that
the April 2006 transfer could therefore have had nothing to do with purchase of the Grand
Hotel shares. The sequence of events is somewhat counter-intuitive. However, the Tribunal
notes Mr. Ejupi’s testimony that, prior to the meeting in Vienna, he (allegedly at Mr.
Shala’s request) engaged in conversations with Mr. Pacolli about the prospect, at the
KTA’s suggestion, of participating with Mr. Ejupiin UTC’s purchase of the Grand Hotel.
The possibility cannot be excluded that, on the strength of those conversations, Mr. Pacolli
made his contribution prior to actually meeting Mr. Berisha. This would be consistent with
the fact that, when Mabco made the Eur 4m transfer, it made that transfer in the first
instance to Mr. Ejupi’s company, NTSH, with which it was cooperating, rather than to

UTC directly.

Based on the positive evidence that Mabco made the transfer of funds in connection with

the Grand Hotel acquisition, the Tribunal cannot conclude otherwise.

c. Is the payment process consistent with purchase of the shares?
The apparent irregularities in connection with the actual payment of the funds are
considerable, but they were effectively explained by Claimant’s witness, Ms. Maesani-
Gaiatto.3+ The need for explanation was precipitated by Respondent’s assertion that
UTC’s deadline for payment of the purchase price was 24 April 2006, but the transfer was
actually made on 28 April 2006. Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto took the Tribunal through the precise
chronology of the payment, explaining the reasons for the delay in receipt of the funds to
the bank account that the KTA maintained at the BPK’s letter to Mabco of 25 April 2006
rejecting the initial transfer of funds and requiring NTSH to return the funds to Mabco was
copied to the KTA.3° The transfer that was eventually successful was made on 28 April
2006 and through successive transfers eventually credited to the KTA on 2 May 2006,
specifically referencing purchase of the Grand Hotel shares.3® While the story, detailed
above (paras. 353-355, supra), is indeed a convoluted one, and suggests a degree of

ineptitude on Claimant’s part, it adequately accounts for the delay in receipt of the monies.

In sum, the Tribunal concludes that the Eur 4m represented Mabco’s participation,
alongside UTC and NTSH, in acquisition of the Grand Hotel shares.
(3) | CLAIMANT DID NOT BECOME AN OWNER OF SHARES BY VIRTUE OF THE AGU

(a) Respondent’s Position

According to Respondent, Claimant acquired no rights in the Grand Hotel as a result of the
AGU because Claimant was neither a party to it nor its beneficiary. The AGU was entered

into by Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi in their personal capacities.3°7 Although Mr.

Pacolli was not only owner, but also CEO and authorized representative of the Mabetex
Group, he was not acting in connection with the AGU in the capacity of agent or
representative of Claimant.*°* Respondent also cites laws and regulations in effect at that
time for the proposition that if a party enters into a contract, its name must appear as either
the contracting party or the beneficiary in order to claim performance under the contract.36
Yet, Claimant’s name is unmentioned in the AGU or surrounding documents. Thus, even
if Mr. Pacolli entered into an agreement for co-ownership with Messrs. Berisha and Ejupi,
and even if the payment was forshares in Grand Hotel, that would not, under the applicable

investment law, constitute an investment by Claimant.>”

Respondent argues that, even if Mr. Pacolli was acting as Claimant’s agent in signing the
AGU, the AGU was insufficient to transfer any share because (i) it is unclear, even with
the presence of the word “Grand,” to what shares the AGU refers, (ii) the AGU imposed
no obligation on any party to transfer shares to another, and (iii) the shares were never in
fact transferred.37! On the last point, Respondent remarks that the Law on Business
Organizations of Kosovo requires that all changes to the information contained in a
registered charter of a limited liability company be publicly notified,?7 indicating the
names and addresses of the owners and their respective ownership interests.*”? Any such
amendments must then be registered with the Business Registration Agency.374 However,
neither Mr. Pacolli nor Mr. Ejupi was ever registered as an owner of the Grand Hotel.375
Accordingly, neither Mr. Pacollinor Mr. Ejupi had ownership of shares in the Grand Hotel,

even in their personal capacities.37° Moreover, in the Appellate Panel of the Special

least two years. Resp. Mem. on Jurisd., para. 90.

Chamber, UTC objected to the intervention of Claimant and NTSH on the ground that they

had no legal interest in the Hotel.

In addition, the AGU does not in any event purport to constitute a sale of shares, but refers
only to a “property purchased jointly.”377 But that prior purchase is not identified.
Respondent observes further that the AGU postdates payment of the EUR 4m, and that it
in itself imposes no further payment obligations. >”8 Respondent asserts, more generally,
that the AGU was nota contract for the transfer of shares, but only an internal agreement
establishing rules governing the relationship among the alleged stockholders. It therefore
presupposed that a transfer of shares had actually occurred, but did not constitute such a

transfer.37

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant concedes that the AGU mentions only the names of Messrs. Pacolli, Ejupi and
Berisha, rather than Claimant, NTSH and UTC, respectively, but considers that “one
cannot seriously come to the conclusion that the AGU had the purpose of conferring
ownership rights on the mentioned individuals.”>8° According to Claimant, these men all
knew, from their prior discussions, that each was representing the company that they
owned. Claimant also remarks that it was the respective companies that provided the funds
for purchase of the shares.8! Moreover, when the AGU was concluded, Mr. Pacolli was
registered in the Swiss Commercial Registry as director of Claimant with individual
signatory authority.382 Thus, Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi did not sign the AGU in

their personal capacities and for their personal interests. Even Mr. Berisha could not,

was “a legal person with limited liability that is now registered as a company with limited liability.” Presumably,
Claimant is arguing thatif Mr. Berisha signed the AGU in a representative as opposed to a personal capacity, there is
every reason to suppose that Messrs. Pa colliand Ejupi signed in their representative capacities as well.

through the AGU, agree to an allocation of shares in his personal capacity, since the shares
were registered, not in his name, but in the name of UTC.3*3 If he was not acting ina
personal capacity there is no reason to assume that either Mr. Pacolli or Mr. Ejupi was

doing so.

Claimant disputes that Law no. 02/L 123, requiring shareowners to be registered in the
Kosovo Business Register has any relevance, as it was not in force when the investment
was made or the AGU was concluded.384 More generally, Claimant cites academic
authority 385 and arbitral case law2°6 for the proposition that host State law does not govem
the definition of an investment or the question whether an investment was made, but only
the investment’s legality,38? which is a separate issue. Moreover, the fact, pointed out by
Respondent, that UTC objected to Claimant’s intervention in its lawsuit in Kosovo has no

bearing on whether Claimant did in fact acquire ownership of the shares.

In any event, Claimant’s contention is not that it acquired ownership of the shares through

the AGU. The AGU merely formalized Claimant’s ownership of the shares. 38%

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

Respondent calls into question Claimant’s reliance on the AGU as the basis of its claimed
entitlement. Although Respondent casts doubt on whether the AGU pertained to the Grand
Hotel shares at all, the Tribunal finds sufficient evidence that, although the AGU itself
imposed no obligations on the KTA, the subject of the AGU was acquisition of those

shares.389

Respondent is correct that the AGU did not itself effectuate a transfer of shares from UTC
to Claimant.3% The AGU notwithstanding, the shares in question were never in fact
transferred to Claimant and Claimant’s ownership of the shares is not publicly recorded,
with the names and addresses of the owners and their respective ownership interests, as
required by Kosovo’s Law on Business Organizations.3! Nor is it registered with the
Business Registration Agency.*** But, as the Tribunal has indicated,3? it views as the
fairest characterization of Claimant’s contention in this proceeding that it has an

entitlement to share ownership, not ownership as such.

(4) CLAIMANT DID NOT BECOME AN OWNER OF SHARES BY VIRTUE OF THE ANNEX
AGREEMENT

(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent observes that the Annex Agreement was not signed by any party acting as
representative of Claimant. Mr. Berisha signed the Agreement on behalf of UTC and Mrs.
Ejupi signed on behalf of Mr. Ejupi and NTSH, but Selim Pacolli signed on behalf of
Behgjet Pacolli and on behalf of Mabetex.3% Claimant was neither party to nor beneficiary
of the Annex Agreement. In fact, as in the case of the AGU, Claimant’s name is
unmentioned in the Annex Agreement. In short, Claimant derived no rights from that
Agreement or any property interest that could possibly constitute an investment.*9> In any

event, the Annex Agreement makes no reference to any payment of EUR 4m.

Finally, Respondent notes that under Article 5 of the Annex Agreement, the Agreement
“shall enter into force following its approval by [the PAK].” Since the PAK never approved

the Annex Agreement, it never entered into force.

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant replies that its assertion of ownership is not dependent on the Annex Agreement
but was established prior to the time that the Agreement was concluded. Moreover, no
significance should be given to the reference to Mabetex, since Mabetex is the group of
companies to which Claimant belongs.3% If anything, the fact that Selim Behgjet signed
the Annex Agreement on behalf of Mabetex refutes the proposition that Behgjet Pacolli

made the investment in his personal capacity.

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

The Tribunal does not linger over the 28 March 2012 Annex Agreement as a basis of
Mabco’s claim of entitlement to ownership of the Grand Hotel shares because Claimant
does not principally rely on that instrument. Also, by its terms, the Annex Agreement
required the PAK’s approval, which appears not to have been given.*°” Notably, however,
appended to the Annex Agreement were (a) a business plan setting out the contemplated
capital investments and increase in the number of employees over the following two years
and (b) the required performance guarantee dated 21 March 2012 issued by the National
Commercial Bank Kosovo in the amount of Eur 20.2m.3%8 Both submissions substantially
corresponded to the items in the PAK’s 19 March 2012 request for documentation.>” It
appears that the PAK at no time suggested that the submissions were inadequate. Claimant
states that in reply to a letter that it sent to the PAK in late June 2012, the PAK
acknowledged that the submissions were satisfactory, but justified its refusal to register the
shares on the ground that UTC had told it that its co-owners showed a “lack of

seriousness. 400

Respondent observes that, in the Annex Agreement, Mr. Berisha and Ms. Ejupi indicated
expressly that they were acting on behalf of UTC and NTSH, respectively, while Selim
Pacolli represented that he signed on behalf of Behgjet Pacolli and Mabetex.*°! The
Tribunal does not attach great significance to this fact. Having concluded that Behgjet
Pacolli acted throughout on behalf of Mabco, the fact that Selim Pacolli acted on behalf of
Behgjet Pacolli changes nothing. Nor, for reasons earlier explained,* does the reference
to Mabetex greatly assist Respondent’s contention that Mr. Pacolli acted throughout on his
own rather than Claimant’s behalf. If he was acting entirely in a personal capacity, Mabetex

would not warrant mention.

CLAIMANT IS NOT A FOREIGN INVESTOR

Respondent argues that, for two reasons, Claimant is not a foreign investor:

(1) Claimant is not an investor.

(2) Even if Claimant were an investor, it was not a foreign investor.

Under the ICSID Convention, as under the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law, it is
insufficient to establish jurisdiction that an investment was made. Claimant must, among
other things, have made the investment, i.e. qualify as an investor. It must be also have the
requisite foreign nationality. Under the BIT, Claimant must have Swiss nationality. Under
both the ICSID Convention and the Foreign Investment Law, Claimant must have a

nationality other than that of Kosovo.
(1) CLAIMANTIS NOT ANINVESTOR

(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent’s positionon this point follows directly from all thathas preceded. In its view,
forall the reasons previously set out, the alleged investment in Kosovo was never made,
and even if it was made, was made by Mr. Pacollias an individual, not by Claimant. Also,

according to Respondent, Mr. Pacolli lacked legal authority to represent it. As a

4 See paras. 341-345, supra.

105

386.

387.

388.

consequence, Claimant is not an investor, within the meaning of ICSID Convention, the

BIT or the Foreign Investment Law.

(b) Claimant’s Position

Similarly, Claimant’s position on whether Mabco is an investor, within the meaning of the
relevant instruments, has been fully set out above. It maintains that it constitutes an
investor, within the meaning of ICSID Convention and otherwise. In addition, it denies
Respondent’s suggestion that Mr. Pacolli lacked the requisite legal authority to represent
Claimant in his dealings in this case, suggesting that, if the matter were to be further
examined, it would need to be examined, not under the law of the host State, Kosovo, but
under the law of the State of incorporation, i.e., Switzerland,4°> whose requirements
Claimant satisfies.‘ It adds that, in any event, the question whether Mr. Pacolli validly
represents Claimant is not a jurisdictional issue, but rather one that is substantive in nature
and, if it is to be examined, is to be examined, not under the law of the host State, Kosovo,
butrather under the law of the State of incorporation, i.e. Switzerland, 45 which Respondent
has not adduced. It maintains that, under Swiss law, Mr. Pacolli was empowered to

represent it.4°

(c) The Tribunal’s Findings and Analysis

The Tribunal notes at the outset its disagreement with Claimant’s assertion that whether
Mr. Pacolli validly represented the Claimantis a substantive rather than jurisdictional issue.
Although Respondent claims that Mr. Pacolli lacked legal authority to represent Claimant,
neither Party has adduced evidence of either Swiss or Kosovan law on the subject, and the

matter was not pursued.

Otherwise, the arguments advanced by Respondent and Claimant under this heading are

largely ones that the Tribunal has already dealt with in other sections of this Decision (see

4°3 Cl. Rejoinder on Jurisd., para. 229.

4 Claimant maintains that Mr. Pacolli was registered in the Swiss Commercial Registry as director of Mabco with
individual signa tory powers in Mabco’s name. Cl. Rejoinderon Jurisd., para. 164; Cl. oralargum., tr. 40:8— 40:14.

391.

paras. 339-345, supra). The Tribunal reaffirms that, factually, Mr. Pacolli acted in his
dealings with the KTA and the PAK, as well as with UTC and NTSH, in a representative

capacity.

(2) EVENIF CLAIMANT WERE AN INVESTOR, IT WAS NOTA FOREIGN INVESTOR
(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that not only the BIT and the Kosovo Foreign Investment Law, but also
the ICSID Convention, under which this case is proceeding, imposes a nationality
requirement on an alleged investor. Under the BIT, the alleged investor must be a national
of the other Contracting State while; under the Kosovo Foreign Investment Law, it must
be a foreign national; and under the ICSID Convention, it must be a national of another

ICSID Contracting State. Claimant satisfies the requirements of none of these instruments.

According to Respondent, Claimant is indisputably a foreign entity. But Claimant’s Swiss
nationality is irrelevant because Claimant was not an investor in this case.4°7 Even if
Mr. Pacolli made the investment that is alleged, as a national of Kosovo, he lacks the
requisite nationality under ICSID, the BIT or the Foreign Investment Law. He is nota
national of another Contracting State (for purposes of the ICSID Convention), ora national
of Kosovo’s BIT partner (for purposes of the BIT) or any foreign nationality (for purposes

of the Foreign Investment Law). 4°8

Respondent further argues that even if Claimant, rather than Behgjet Pacolli acting in his
personal capacity, made an investment in Kosovo, Claimant cannot be considered a Swiss
national for purposes of the BIT. According to Respondent, Claimant performs no
economic activity in Switzerland, as the BIT specifically requires. It is not sufficient
that Claimant manages several projects from an office in Switzerland, a proposition for
which, according to Respondent, Claimant has in any event adduced no evidence.*!°

Counsel for Respondent suggests that only the place where a construction company

392.

393.

engages in its real economic activities is the place where the construction projects are

performed.*!!

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant advances several arguments in response. First, it insists that Mr. Pacolli acted
throughout the privatization process as Claimant’s representative, and that this was well
known to Respondent. Mr. Pacolli was known throughout Kosovo as having established
Claimant as a business entity and as a component part of Mabetex, which he was also
known to have founded.4!? Claimant observes more generally that, in any transaction, a
juridical person is necessarily represented by a natural person.*!3 The fact that the owner
of acompany is of a different nationality than the claimant company, andthus nota national
of the other Contracting State, is irrelevant. That situation is in fact extremely common.*!4

That is no less the case just because the owner is a national of the host State.

Claimant further disputes Respondent’s contention that Claimant conducts no real
economic activities in Switzerland.*!5 Claimant, as part of the Mabetex Group, conducts
project planning, development, and management in Switzerland for construction around
the world.4!® Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto testified that since 1999 the number of Claimant’s
employees based in Switzerland has ranged from 13 to 60, the latter being the number of
employees at this time.*!? As evidence of the increase in number of employees in

Switzerland, Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto cites Claimant’s balance sheets for 2006 and 2017.4!8

(c) The Tribunal’s Findings and Analysis

Respondentis correct that, if Mr. Pacolli was acting in a personal capacity, neither the BIT,
nor the Foreign Investment Law, nor the ICSID Convention*!? would be applicable to this
case, since Mr. Pacolliis a national of Kosovo. However, the Tribunal, having concluded
that Mr. Pacolli was acting on behalf of Mabco rather than himself, the relevant issue is the
nationality of Mabco. Mabco indisputably has Swiss nationality*2° and is therefore
presumably entitled, from a ratione personae point of view, to proceed under the ICSID
Convention and seek protection under both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law in

connection with an investment in Kosovo.

However, Respondent questions Claimant’s Swiss nationality and therefore its entitlement
to proceed under the Conventionand its eligibility to invoke the BIT. (As faras the Foreign
Investment Law is concerned, Claimant need not of course be Swiss; any nationality other
than that of Kosovo would suffice.) Respondent bases its challenge on the premise that,
under the BIT, it is insufficient that Claimant is a Swiss national. It must also engage in
economic activity in Switzerland.*?! Although Respondent does not contend that Claimant
is a “shell company,” it denies that Claimant engages in sufficient activity in Switzerland
to satisfy the BIT requirement. The Tribunal is unconvinced. Ms. Maesani-Gaiatto testified
that Claimant conducts all its project planning and managementactivity in Lugano and, for
those purposes, has at all times employed at those headquarters a significant number of
employees,*?? and her testimony was not refuted. Nor can the Tribunal accept
Respondent’s proposition that the economic activities performed by a construction
company suchas Mabco are to be considered by definitionas conducted only in the locales

where its construction projects are situated.

EVEN IF CLAIMANT HAD MADE AN INVES T IN KOSOVO, IT DOES
NOT CONSTITUTE A “PROTECTED INVESTMENT”

  

Respondent contends that, even if Claimant made an investment, it was not lawfully made.

It bases this contention on the following two arguments:

(1) The alleged investment was not made in accordance with domestic law.

(2) The alleged investment would not contribute to the economic development of Kosovo.
(dd) THE ALLEGED INVESTMENT WAS NOT MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH DOMESTIC LAW
(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent argues that both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law require that, in order
to be protected, an investment must be lawful, i.e., must have been made in accordance
with domestic law. According to Respondent, its consent to arbitrate under both the BIT
and the Foreign Investment Law is expressly conditional on the lawfulness of a claimant’s
investment.*?3 Thus, an investment’s lawfulness is a jurisdictional requirement, whether
stated in the definition of investment (as in the Foreign Investment Law) or in the clause

on scope of application (as in the BIT).424

Claimant cannot have lawfully acquired an investment in Kosovo, in the form of shares in
the Grand Hotel, because any arrangement that Mr. Berisha, acting on behalf of UTC, made
with undisclosed third parties, such as Claimant, would have been in breach of the Purchase
Agreement.*?5 Article 5.1.3 of that Agreement forbade a buyer to “purchase[e] ... Shares

. as an agent for a third party [or]... form[] any informal or formal undisclosed

agreements or consortiums ... with any undisclosed third party.”

399. Finally, even if Claimant had purchased the shares, Claimant would have violated the
Tender Rules governing the privatization process in numerous respects, *”¢ including the
supply of required informationand assurances. For example, Rule 4.4(ii)(dd) provides that,
if a bidder is a consortium of individuals or legal entities, it must submit certified copies of
the consortium’s founding documents, identification cards, passports, and registration
information, as well as identify all the beneficial owners and “Control Persons” — none of

which was done.

400. Ina reply to a Tribunal member’s question, counsel for Respondent stated that whether a
party complied with Tender Rules, which are part of Kosovo’s legal framework for
privatization, isa question of public law, notone of contract law.*2’ Violation of the Tender
Rules constitutes a violation of host State law, due to the special importance of
transparency in the tender process.*28 Respondent asserts that, through its covert action,
Claimant, even assuming it was the investor, circumvented the mandatory screening

process, including essential background checks.*2? Respondent specifically rejects

Claimant’s argument that Tender Rules are insufficiently fundamental to render an

investment unlawful for purposes of the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law.*3°

Respondentalso rejects any notion that it is estopped from contesting the lawfulness of
Claimant’s alleged investment due to Mr. Shala having actively solicited and approved
Claimant’s investment in the Grand Hotel. As noted (para. 259, supra), Respondent denies
that Mr. Shala took any such actions. More generally, Respondent denies the existence of
any evidence in the record to suggest that it endorsed or accepted Claimant’s alleged
investment.#3! Respondent made no representations about the validity of the alleged
investment under local law, nor did it ever rely upon the alleged investment agreement.*??

It consistently rejected Claimant’s assertions of ownership.*33

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant disputes these contentions on several grounds. First, Claimant contends that
Respondent misinterprets the legality requirement set out in the BIT. In its view, an
investment, for purposes of the BIT, is defined in Article 1 merely as a qualifying asset
established or acquired by a claimant, without reference to its legality, and Article 11 does
not make submission of a dispute to arbitration dependent on the legality of the underlying
asset. The legality of an investment is, in Claimant’s view a merits, not a jurisdictional,
issue.434 According to Claimant, the legality of an investment is a jurisdictional
requirement only if the definition of investment in the BIT so provides, which, unlike in

other BITs, is not the case here.*35 Accordingly, the lawfulness of an investment under the

49 Resp. post-hearing br., paras. 72, 75,77, 86-87. Respondent suggests that only non-compliance with formal legal
requirements can be overlooked in determining whether an investment is or is not lawful.

present BIT pertains to the scope of application of the BIT, rather than jurisdiction, and is

a merits issue.45¢

403. But, even if the legality of an investment were a jurisdictional requirement, it is satisfied.
According to Claimant, in order to be disqualifying, an illegality must consist of a breach
ofa fundamental principle of law,*3’ which is notthe case in a violation of a tenderingrule.
Moreover, an illegality, especially if not fundamental, may be excused where the claimant

acted in good faith, as is Claimant’s case.438

404. Moreover, the Tender Rules, and the possibility of a breach thereof, are irrelevant in this
case because Claimant was specifically engaged by the KTA as a prospective purchaser
well after the tendering procedure had ended. It was not a participant in that procedure and
therefore could not have violated it.44? According to Claimant, it is common practice that
ifa winning bidder cannotpay the purchase price, other investors may assist it.44° Claimant
refers to the fact that the KTA accepted and never questioned the investment made in
Mabetex’s name in the Hotel Iliria and the Pipeline Factory as co-owner even though
Claimant had not participated in the bidding process for those entities. #*! If any violation
of the Tender Rules was committed, it would in any event have been committed by the

bidder which was UTC.*?

Further, Respondent is estopped from invoking illegality as a barrier to jurisdiction,
inasmuch as it actively solicited Claimant’s participation in the investment.‘ In any
event, Respondent was well aware of the payment that Claimant made and the fact that it
was made as part of the share purchase price, which the KTA tacitly approved. “4 Claimant
observes that, between February 2008 and March 2012, the PAK received an entire series
of communications from the co-investors informing it that they had co-invested in the
Grand Hotel and were prepared to make the required investments.*45 Yet, no public
authority of Kosovo, including the KTA and the PAK, ever questioned that the payment
by Claimant was made or was legal, nor did it ever raise any breach of either the Tender
Rules or the Purchase Agreement. Finally, the PAK’s involvementin an attemptto bribe
Messrs. Pacolli and Ejupi in exchange for registration of their shares demonstrates that it

was aware of their participation in the purchase of the shares.44”

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

Article 2 of the BIT states by its terms that, in order to be protected, an investment must be
“established or acquired in accordance with its laws and regulations by investors of the
other Contracting Party, whether prior to or after the entry into force of this Agreement”
(emphasis added). Similarly, the 2005 Foreign Investment Law provides in Article 2(1)
that an investment may take the form of an asset that has been “contributed to, or leased or
otherwise temporarily provided under contract to, any other type of organization /awfiully

established in Kosovo foruse in such organization’s business or other activities in Kosovo”

Worldwide v. Republic of the Philippines, 1CSID Case No. ARB/03/25, Award, 16 August 2007, para. 346.

Principles of fairness should require a tribunal to hold a government estopped
from raising violations of its own law as a jurisdictional defense when it
knowingly overlooked them and endorsed an investment, which was not in
compliance with its law.

(emphasis added).*48 Article 2.1.4 of the Kosovo 2014 Foreign Investment Law extends
protection only to “[iJnvestments,” defined as “any asset owned or otherwise /awfilly held
by a Foreign Person in the Republic of Kosovo for the purpose of conducting /awfil

commercial activities” (emphasis added).

Claimant maintains initially that the lawfulness of an investment is a merits issue and
therefore not to be determined at this stage.*#? The Tribunal disagrees. According to well-
established jurisprudence,**° unless an investment is lawful, it cannot constitute an
investment within the meaning of an investment protection instrument, particularly when
the instrument specifically requires that an investment be lawful. The Tribunal’s
jurisdiction under the BIT and Foreign Investment Law thus depends on the alleged

investment being a lawful one.

Respondent’s assertionof unlawfulness turns on the fact that Claimant did not comply with
the rules of tender under Kosovo law.*5! That Claimant did not comply with those rules is
beyond doubt. Claimant makes two arguments in reply. First, it maintains that the tender
tules of Kosovo are insufficiently fundamental in order for non-compliance with them to
render its investment unlawful, within the meaning of the BIT or the Foreign Investment
Law. Second, it claims that, even if the rules are sufficiently fundamental for that purpose,

Respondent waived any objection based on the alleged investment’s unlawfulness.452

The Tribunal has no reason to rule on the question whether the tender rules are sufficiently
fundamental within the meaning of the lawfulness requirement. This is because, in the

Tribunal’s judgment, the PAK indeed waived any claim of unlawfulness. The recordshows

+48 However, under the 2005 Law, an investment can also take the fom of an asset “contributed to a Kosovo business
organization in return for an ownership interest in that business organization,” without expressly requiring that the
business organization must havebeen established lawfully.

that the PAK engaged in substantial negotiations with Claimant, in contemplation of
Claimant’s eventual acquisition of the Grand Hotel shares, well after the tender procedure
had concludedand without the PAK having launcheda new tender procedure. During those
negotiations, which continued well into the early months of 2012, as late as April, the PAK
voiced no concern over the legality of the manner in which Claimant was proceeding, As
late as 2012, the PAK indicated that all that remained to register the shares was production
by Claimant of certain documentation. Arbitral case law suggests that an illegality in an
investment that might otherwise disqualify the investment from protection cannot be raised
as a jurisdictional defense if the State was aware of the illegality and expressedno objection

on that basis. 45

Respondent accordingly cannot impugn Claimant’s putative investment in Kosovo on the

ground that it was unlawful.

(2) THE ALLEGED INVESTMENT WOULD NOT CONTRIBUTE TO THE ECONOMIC
DEVELOPMENT OF Kosovo

(a) Respondent’s Position

Although Respondent did not pursue this argument, it initially maintained thatcontribution
to economic development of a host State is a necessary element of an investment and in its
absence an investment is illegal. In this case, the alleged investment, even if made, was not
lawful because it failed to contribute to Kosovo’s economic development.*5+ The argument
is essentially that the successful bidder, UTC, had failed to fulfill its obligations under the
Commitment Agreement with regard, among other things, to levels of contribution of
capital and employment,**> and Claimant cannot therefore maintain that it substantially

contributed to economic development of the home State.

414.

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant rejects this argument on the ground that Kosovo’s withdrawal of the shares was
not precipitated by UTC’s alleged noncompliance with the Commitment Agreement,
assuming that would in itself render the investment unlawful, but rather by Claimant’s
refusal to pay a bribe.45 Mr. Ejupi testified that the only reason the shares were ultimately
withdrawn was indeed his and Mr. Pacolli’s refusal to pay any bribes. #57 Claimant also
maintains that UTC and the PAK made Claimant’s access to the hotel, and therefore

Claimant’s further contributions, impossible.458

More fundamentally, Claimant argues that, had its investment not been withdrawn by the
PAK, it would have contributed to Kosovo’s economic development, for the simple reason
that the Grand Hotel’s privatization was part of a project to privatize some 500 SOEs as a
major boost to the country’s economy and that the hotel was a particularly prestigious and

valuable element of the economy.**?

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

In a line of argument that it has not pursued, Respondent has argued that in order to be
protected an investment must contribute to the economic development of the host State.
The Tribunal does not find language in any of the instruments at issue in this case
suggesting that an investment is not lawful unless it makesa contribution of that kind. It is
also aware of no award standing for, or literature supporting, that proposition. In an earlier
portion of this Decision (see para. 296, supra), the Tribunal acknowledged that some
tribunals have treated contribution to the economic development of the host State as part
of the definition of an investment under the ICSID Convention but, for reasons explained
there, it joins the large number of tribunals that decline to do so. It would make little sense,
having dispensed with that requirement in connection with the definition of an investment,

to then reintroduce it as an element of an investment’s lawfulness.

Our consideration of this argument can stop there. But, in any event, the Tribunal finds,
again as stated earlier (para. 301, supra), that renovation and management of the Grand
Hotel represented a significant contribution to Kosovo’s tourism industry and thus to

Kosovo’s economic development more generally.

KOSOVO HAS NOT GIVEN ITS CONSENT TO ARBITRATE THE PRESENT
DISPUTE

Respondent maintains that, under both the BIT and the Foreign Investment Law, Claimant
could not conclude an agreementto arbitrate with Kosovo withoutsatisfy ing the conditions
to which Kosovo subjected its offer to arbitrate. Because Claimant did not fulfill those

conditions prior to initiating arbitration, no agreement to arbitrate came into existence.

There are three conditions required in order to acceptan offer to arbitrate under the relevant

instruments that, according to Respondent, Claimant failed to satisfy.4°

(1) Claimant failed to present an “investment dispute,” as required by both the BIT and the
Foreign Investment Law.

(2) Claimant failed to comply with the BIT’s and Foreign Investment Law’s election of
remedies clauses.

(3) Claimant failed to satisfy the BIT’s requirement of prior consultation.

Each of these assertions is discussed in turn below.

(1) CLAIMANT FAILED TO PRESENT AN “INVESTMENT DISPUTE, ” AS REQUIRED BY BOTH
THE BIT AND THE FOREIGNINVESTMENT LAW

Here Respondent reiterates that, having not acquired an ownership interest in shares of

Grand Hotel, Claimant did not make an investment, and therefore has not presented to the

Tribunal an “investment dispute.” This argumentand Claimant’s defense thereto have been

addressed earlier (see paras. 293-322, supra) and require no further elaboration here.

419.

420.

(2) CLAIMANT FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THE BIT’S AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW'S
ELECTION OF REMEDIES CLAUSE.

(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent next argues that, having brought suit in the courts of Kosovo, Claimant is
precluded by a “fork in the road” provision from thereafter initiating and maintaining this
proceeding. Respondent maintains thatboth the BIT and the 2014 Foreign Investment Law
require an election of remedies as between litigation and arbitration and that Claimant made

its election by having recourse to the courts. Article 11(2) of the BIT provides:

If ... consultations do not result in a solution within six months from
the date of the written request for consultations, the investor may
submit the dispute either to the courts or the administrative tribunals
of the Contracting party concerned or to international arbitration.
(emphasis added)

Article 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law is worded differently. It provides:

In the absence of ... an agreed procedure, a foreign investor shall
have the right to require that the investment dispute be settled either
through litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction in the
Republic of Kosovo or through local and international arbitration.
(emphasis added)

 

The Tribunal notes that 2005 Foreign Investment Law contains no such requirement. *°!

In Respondent’s view, use of the phrase “either ... or” in both provisions demonstrates that
Claimant could pursue either of the two mentioned avenues of relief, but not both. In other
words, both Article 1 1(2) of the BIT and Article 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law
constitute “fork in the road” provisions.‘ Prior to initiating arbitration, Claimant both

brought an action against the PAK for annulment of its exercise of the share call option

461 Article 16(2) of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law is silent on the availability of a remedy in the courtsof Kosovo.
It only addresses arbitration, providing that “[t]he foreign investor may chooseany ofthe following procedural rules
to govern the arbitration of the investment dispute,” specifying as available the ICSID Convention and ICSID
Additional Facility Rules, provided theirjurisdictional requirements are met, the UNCITRAL Rules and the ICC Ruks
(Exh. C-2).

and sought to intervene in the UTC’s action for annulment of the same decision.
Because Claimant first brought litigation over the dispute in the courts of Kosovo, it is
barred by the election of remedies provision from thereafter pursuing arbitration.4%4

Claimant’s choice to litigate its grievances was irreversible.

According to Respondent, it is of no consequence that Claimant based its litigation on
Kosovo’ s alleged undue interference with Claimant’s alleged shareholdingin Grand Hotel,
while basing this proceeding on unlawful expropriation and denial of fair and equitable
treatment, since the actions have the same subject matter.4®5 Both claims arise out of the
same factual circumstances, make the same allegations, and seek the same relief, viz.
protection from the withdrawal of shares. Atthe center of both the arbitration and litigation

is the legality of the PAK’s decision to withdraw the shares in the Grand Hotel.

Respondent argues that, under arbitral case law, application of a fork in the road provision
does not require satisfaction of the so-called “triple identity test” (identities of parties,
objectand cause of action), but merely a demonstration that the two claims are substantially

equivalent,*® which they are in this case.
(b) Claimant’s Position
Claimant advances several arguments in response.
First, Claimant disagrees with Respondent’s reading of Article 11(2) of the BIT and
Article 16(2) of the 2014 Foreign Investment Law. In Claimant’s view, the “either”/“or”

formulation simply gives an investor a choice of remedies, but does not by its terms forbid

resort to both.47

426.

Claimant further points to Article 11(4) of the BIT. In its estimation, Article 11(4) is not
a “fork in the road” provision either. Itexpressly provides that, once the investor has elected
to arbitrate its dispute, that choice of forum is final and the investor cannot thereafter have
recourse to a host State courton the same claim. However, it does not provide the converse,
namely that once the investor has elected to litigate its dispute in host State court, that
choice of jurisdiction is final and the investor cannot thereafter have recourse to arbitration
on the same claim. In other words, the clause in the present case is asymmetric. Claimant
points out that it is easy enough to drafta clause providing that whichever forum a claimant
chooses — whether litigation or arbitration — that choice is irreversible. Illustrative of the
several examples provided by Claimant, all of which are BITs concluded by Switzerland,

is the Colombia-Switzerland:

Once the investor has referred the dispute to either a national
tribunal or an international arbitration mechanism ..., the choice of
the procedure shall be final.*

Claimant further takes the position that, even if the provisions of the BIT and the 2014
Foreign Investment Law were to be read as “fork in the road” clauses, they would not bar
access to arbitration following litigation because the claims in the two fora are notthe same.
In the courts of Kosovo, Claimant invoked domestic law, which the Tribunal understands
as the law governing the registration of shares, which is most likely part of administrative
law, whereas in this proceeding, it asserts claims of expropriation and violation of fair and
equitable treatment, as well as denial of justice, under the BIT and the Foreign Investment
Law.*®? Accordingly, the triple identity test, widely adopted for “fork-in-the road”
purposes, is not satisfied. While there is an identity of parties and arguably an identity of
object, there is no identity of cause of action. So far as identity of cause of action is

concerned, the prevailing view among investment tribunals is that contract and investment

treaty claims are distinct.47° Although a “fundamental basis” test has recently emerged,*7!
itis notthe prevailing view. A leading case emphasized that itis “necessary ... to determine
whether claimed entitlements have the same normative source.”4”? That the litigation and
arbitration in this case do not share the same normative source is, to Claimant’s mind,

obvious.

427. Finally, according to Claimant, the fork in the road principle is in any event inapplicable
to this case because the courts of Kosovo declined to entertain on the merits any of the

claims advanced by Claimant.*73 Claimant cites precedent to this effect.474

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

428. Resolving this issue entails making potentially three determinations. First, do the BIT
and/or the 2014 Foreign Investment Law impose an election of remedies requirement?
Second, assuming that these instruments do contain a fork in the road requirement and that
Claimant did pursue litigation prior to initiating arbitration, are the claims in the two fora
substantially the same? Third, should the Tribunal so find, is it of consequence that, as

Claimant contends, the courts of Kosovo did not address or decide its claims on the merits.

429. As noted, Article 11(2) BIT invites foreign investors to submit their claims either to

litigation or arbitration:

If ... consultations do not result in a solution within six months from
the date of the written request for consultations, the investor may
submit the dispute either to the courts or the administrative tribunals

of the Contracting party concerned or to international arbitration.

(emphasis added)
For arbitration, the options are ICSID, the ICSID Additional Facility and the UNCITRAL
Rules.

BIT Article 11(4) goes on to provide that “[o]nce the investor has referred the investment
dispute to international arbitration ... the choice of jurisdiction shall be final.” Arguably
Article 11(4) modifies Article 11(2) by rendering it a “one-way” election of remedies
clause, barring a claimant from bringing litigation of a claim or claims previously
submitted to arbitration, but not, conversely, barring a claimant from initiating arbitration
overa claim or claims previously brought to the courts. Under this view, the BIT would
entitle an investor to pursue litigation over its claims without prejudice to its right to
thereafter submit them to arbitration. However, it seems to the Tribunal more plausible,
especially in view of its placement within Article 11, that Article 11(4) has a more limited
import, namely that if and when a claimant opts for arbitration and institutes proceedings
before one arbitral institution, it may not thereafter pursue its claim before a different
arbitral institution. So viewed, Article 11(4) would leave Article 11(2), and any limitation

that it imposes, fully intact.

The 2014 Foreign Investment Law similarly offers claimants both a litigation and

arbitration option:

In the absence of such an agreed procedure, a foreign investor shall
have the right to require that the investment dispute be settled either
through litigation before a court of competent jurisdiction in the
Republic of Kosovo or through local and international arbitration.
The foreign investor may choose any of the following procedural
rules to govern the arbitration of the investment dispute. ...
If a claimant opts for arbitration, its options are the ICSID Convention, the ICSID

Additional Facility Rules, the UNCITRAL Rules and the ICC Rules.

The question then is whether a treaty or statutory provision enabling a claimant to submit
a dispute either to the courts (or administrative tribunals) of the host State or international

arbitration constitutes a “fork in the road” provision.

123

433.

434.

435.

436.

It seems to the Tribunal quite reasonable to read a provision enablinga claimant to proceed
either in litigation or in arbitration as simply giving it two avenues of recourse against an
alleged BIT violation. It does not follow from the fact that a claimant has two options that
achoice once made is necessarilyan irreversible one, so that availing oneself of oneremedy
precludes it from thereafter resorting to the other. As the above examples show, there exists
standard language by which States, in drafting their BITs, can clearly require investors to
make an irreversible election of remedies. The Tribunal cannot comfortably conclude that

BIT Article 11(2), as written, operates to bar Claimant from proceeding in this forum.

In reaching its conclusion, the Tribunal is also influenced by comparing the language of
BIT Article 11(2) and the analogous provisions in other BITs. An example of a classic
“fork in the road” provision are Articles VII(2) and (3) of the Argentina-U.S. BIT,

according to which:

Provided that the [investor] has not submitted the dispute for
resolution under paragraph 2 (a) [the courts or administrative
tribunals of the host State] or (b) [any previously agreed dispute

settlement procedure] ... , he [investor] may choose to consent in
writing to the submission of the dispute for settlement by binding
arbitration...

By way ofa further example, Article VI(3) of the Czech-U'S. BIT provides:
[E]ither party to the dispute may institute [arbitration] provided:

(i) the dispute has not been submitted ... for resolution in
accordance with any applicable previously agreed dispute-
settlement procedures; and

the [investor] has not brought the dispute before the courts of justice
or administrative tribunals or agencies of competent jurisdiction of
the [host State].
These are the standard formulations. They demonstrate how an effective fork in the road

provision can be, and is, drafted.

In sum, Respondent’s objection based on BIT Article 11(2) must be rejected. That having

been decided, the Tribunal has no occasion to address Claimant’s two further arguments,

124

437.

438.

439.

namely that the claims advanced by Claimant in the courts of Kosovo and the claims
pursued here are not substantially the same, and that a “fork in the road” provision is not
triggered if the forum first seized does not address and decide the claims before it on the

merits.

Thus, under neither the BIT nor the 2014 Foreign Investment Law is an investor subject to

an election of remedies requirement.

(3) CLAIMANT FAILED TO SATISFY THE BIT’S AND THE FOREIGN INVESTMENT LAW'S
REQUIREMENT OF PRIOR CONSULTATION

(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent observes that the BIT requires that, prior to initiating arbitration, an investor
must engage in consultations with the host State with a view to achieving amicable

settlement of the dispute. Articles 1 1(1) and (2) provide as follows:

(1) [D]isputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the
other Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former
made in the territory of the latter, which are based on an alleged
breach of obligations under this Agreement, shall be, to the extent
possible, settled amicably through consultations by request in
writing of either of the parties to the dispute.

(2) If these consultations do not result in a solution within six
months from the date of the written request for consultations, the
investor may submit the dispute either to the courts or the
administrative tribunals of the Contracting party concerned or to
international arbitration.

Respondent lays emphasis on the word “shall” in paragraph 1.

Respondent maintains that Claimant has not performed the above steps. It rejects
Claimant’s suggestion that it complied with the consultation requirement through its letters
to the PAK of 23 February 2016475 and 30 March 2016.4” The first letter does not express

a request for consultations, but rather an intention to bring a legal action. While the second

441.

442.

letter does refer to amicable resolution of the dispute, it is insufficiently precise because it
failed to specify that the dispute concerned a BIT-protected investment and an alleged
breach of BIT obligations.47” Because Respondent’s consent to arbitrate was conditioned
on a claimant’s satisfaction of the prior consultation requirement, and because Claimant
did not satisfy that requirement, Respondent’s offer was not accepted and no agreement to

arbitrate came into existence.47*

Any assertion by Claimant that recourse to prior consultation should not be required
because it would have been futile should be rejected. A claim of futility in regard to
satisfaction of a condition precedent must be supported by clear evidence, and in this case
no evidence of futility was proffered, apart from Behgjet Pacolli’s own statement in his

interview with police investigators.*”

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant disagrees. It maintains, first, that prior consultation is not a jurisdictional
requirement, but simply a procedural or at most an admissibility one.*8° Thus, even if the
requirement is not met, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is intact. Claimant also accuses

Respondent of overlooking the phrase “to the extent possible” in Article 11(1).

More to the point, Claimant maintains that the letters of 23 February 2016 and 30 March
2016 do satisfy the BIT’s prior consultation requirement because they served the purpose
of thatrequirement, which is to enable the parties to enter into negotiation over the dispute.
In Claimant’s view, both letters served that purpose. **! In its Rejoinder, Claimant adduced

a third communication that, according to it, also satisfies the prior consultation

requirement. Claimant maintains that its letter of 27 August 20124*? clearly represents a
request for consultation, by stating the nature of the dispute, invoking BIT Article 11(1)

and specifically referencing its grounds of complaint under the BIT.

Claimant also suggests that, as awards have previously held,4* prior consultation is not
required where resort to it would be futile. It would be futile, in Claimant’s view, because
the authorities of Respondent were engaged in “serious high-level decision-making

organized crime.” 484 Under these circumstances, further negotiations were pointless.

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

Respondent observes that the BIT, though not the Foreign Investment Law, requires that,
prior to initiating arbitration, an investor engage in consultations with the host State with a

view to achieving amicable settlement of their dispute. Article 11(1) provides as follows:

[D]isputes between an investor of a Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party regarding an investment of the former made in

the territory of the latter, which are based on an alleged breach of
obligations under this Agreement, shall be, to the extent possible,

settled amicably through consultations by request in writing of
either of the parties to the dispute.

Respondentalleges that Claimant failed to comply with the precondition set out in BIT
Article 11(1). Claimant replies in part that the condition set out in Article 11(1) constitutes
an admissibility rather than a jurisdictional objection and that, in any event, itis inoperative
since efforts at amicable resolution of the dispute would have been futile. Should those
arguments fail, Claimant contends that it did in fact do what Article 11(1) requires. The
Tribunal can accept neither of these assertions. In its reading of the BIT, Kosovo’s offer to

arbitrate could not be accepted by Mabco until the stated consultations were held, or at

least requested, and failed. The condition is therefore jurisdictional in nature. Nor can the
Tribunal conclude that consultations would be futile. They might or might not have been

futile, but Respondent has adduced no evidence to that effect.

What remains then to be decided is whether Claimant did or did not satisfy the BIT’s
condition precedent. In maintaining that it did satisfy that requirement, Claimant relies on

two communications from it to the PAK, those of 23 February 2016 and 30 March 2016.

Upon a fair reading, the former communication cannot be regarded as a request for
consultations. In that short communication, Claimant’s attorney Gazmend Nushi simply
wrote: “I hereby notify [y]ou for the intention to file lawsuit against Privatization Agency
of Kosovo in relation with the protection of infringed interests of ‘Mabetex Group — Mabco
Construction’ in the process of privatization of NewCo ‘Hoteli Grand’ respectively on the
occasion of withdrawal of shares of this enterprise by the Board of Directors of PAK.485
This communication reflects no interest on Claimant’s part in engaging in further
discussions with the PAK in connection with their dispute. It announces Claimant’s

readiness to bring suit and nothing more.
Claimant’s 30 March 2016 communication to the PAK reads as follows:
Honorable President of Board of Directors,

On 23 February 2016, in the capacity of authorized representative
of “Mabetex Group — Mabco Construction”, I have submitted a
Request for amicable resolution of the disputes, registered with PAK
with protocol number 1600.

Through this submission, I would like to recall and reiterate that
that “Mabetex Group — Mabco Construction” yet remains in the
proposal filed by the Request of February 23rd 2016.

I hope that the Board of Directors will consider this request by
sending an invitation to the delegation of “Mabetex Group —
Mabco Construction” for discussions in finding an amicable

452.

resolution of the disputes and thus preventing the initiation of
respective legal proceedings.*®°

The Tribunal finds that, unlike the 23 February 2016 communication, the 30 March 2016
communication does satisfy the BIT’s requirement of prior consultation. The language
solicits an invitation from the PAK for “discussions in finding an amicable resolution of
the disputes.” The Tribunal finds that this expression of interest is sufficient to meet the
BIT’s requirement of prior consultation. Further, it cannot accept the suggestion that this
communication bore no relation to the present dispute. That argument must fail, if for no
other reason, because it refers back explicitly to the 23 February 2016 communication
which in turn refers explicitly to the “infringed interests of ‘Mabetex Group — Mabco
Construction’ in the process of privatization of NewCo ‘Hoteli Grand’ respectively on the
occasion of withdrawal of shares of this enterprise by the Board of Directors of PAK.” That

sufficiently identifies the dispute referenced in the 30 March 2016 communication.

In sum, Claimant has satisfied the prior consultation requirement set out in BIT Article

11(1).

THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION RA TIONE TEMPORIS

Respondentalso raises an objection ratione temporis, viz., that the BIT, by its terms applies
to investments made prior to the BIT’s entry into force, but that, according to Article 2, it
does not apply “to claims and disputes arising out of events which occurred prior to its

entry into force.”’487

(1) RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Respondent argues that, since Claimant challenges the validity of the decision to withdraw
the shares, #88 the event out of which the present dispute arose is precisely the PAK’s 16

December 2011 decision to withdraw the shares**? or, at the very latest the 31 May 2012

decision to execute that decision.‘ Both dates predate the entry into force of the BIT on
13 June 2012. Respondent describes the 31 May decision as “final, binding and
irreversible,” in a word, definitive, all subsequent steps amounting to nothing more than
formalities.49! Significantly, the measure that Mr. Pacolli challenged in the SCSC and in
the Constitutional Court was the decision of 31 May 2012.4%2

Respondent also disputes the notion that its conduct was a continuing action, extending
beyond the entry in force of the BIT.4%3 Similarly, Claimant’s denial of justice claim does
not constitute a new event within the meaning of BIT Article 2, because it relates back to
the 31 May 2012 decision. 4% Both claims arise out of events that precede entry into force
of the BIT on 13 June 2012. Respondent cites, among other things, Selim Pacolli’s 11 June

2012 letter to the PAK objecting to withdrawal of the shares.495

(2) CLAIMANT’s POSITION

Claimant insists that the present dispute arises out of events that postdate the BIT’s entry

into force.

Claimant notes that, as early as its correspondence with the ICSID Secretariat before
registration of the case, it stated that it only became aware of the withdrawal of shares on
14 June 2012, ie., one day after the BIT entered into force, and its claim was therefore

timely.

Claimant disagrees that the dispute arose either on 16 December 2016 or 31 May 2012. In
its view, the dispute did not arise either when the PAK decided to withdraw the shares or
when it decided to execute the withdrawal. Neither of these decisions wasa legally binding
measure or was definitive. The measure challenged in this dispute is the actual withdrawal

of the shares, not the prospect of it. The decisive event was the withdrawal itself, which

occurred on 20 July 2012,4% after the BIT had gone into effect. Before that time, Claimant
had suffered no losses.4#97 Had the withdrawal not actually been carried out, there would

have been no dispute. 48

Claimant maintains that, in any event, Respondent’s breach of its obligations was a
continuing or composite one.*9° The chain of events by which Respondent pursued its
wrongful purpose may have begun prior to the date of entry into force of the BIT, but it did
not crystallize and culminate in the deprivation of Claimant’s rights until after that date.

Withdrawal of the shares on 20 July 2012 was the decisive moment. 5

Claimant observes that the Foreign Investment Law, unlike the BIT, contains no exclusion
for disputes arising out of events prior to its enactment. Article 20 simply provides that
“the present law — and the rights, guarantees, privileges and protections established by the
present law — shall apply equally to foreign investors that invested in the Republic of

Kosovo prior to the effective date of this law.”

At the very least, Claimant’s denial of justice claim arose after the entry into force of the
BIT.*°! Claimant submitted its claim to the SCSC on 19 November 2012, many months
after the BIT’s entry into force, and the court never ruled on it and neither did the SCSC’s
Appellate Panel or, for that matter, the Constitutional Court. Accordingly, the courts of
Respondentnever afforded Claimant an opportunity to be heard. In sum, Claimant suffered

a denial of justice, and it did so after, not before, the BIT came into effect.

(3) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

The Tribunal notes at the outset that, unlike most BIT provisions to this general effect,
Article 2 excludes claims arising out of “events” that occurred prior to the BIT’s entry into
force, rather than “disputes” occurring prior to the BIT’s entry into force. This language
suggests that the exclusion from coverage may start at an earlier point than the time at

which the dispute as such emerged.

The 2005 Foreign Investment Law contains no such temporal limitation .5°? However, even
if it did, it would pose no impediment to the claims in the present case. The Foreign
Investment Law dates back to 21 November 2005, effective April 2006. While Claimant
made its contribution in 2006, it cannot be said that any of its claims arose before the 2005

Law came into force.
Accordingly, we are concerned here solely with Mabco’s BIT claims.

In applying BIT Article 2, and thereby determining when the operative events occurred, it
is necessary to distinguish clearly among Mabco’s various BIT claims. These are

expropriation, denial of fair and equitable treatment and denial of justice.

(a) Expropriation Claim

Under Article 5(1) of the BIT:

Neither of the Contracting Parties shall take, either directly or
indirectly, measures of expropriation, nationalization or any other
measures having the same nature or the same effect against
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party (hereinafter
referred to as “expropriation ”’) unless the measures are taken in the
public interest, on a non-discriminatory basis and under due
process of law, and provided that provisions be made for prompt,
effective and adequate compensation. Such compensation shall be
equivalent to the fair market value of the investment immediately
before the expropriation occurred or became public knowledge,

5 By contrast, the 20 14 Foreign Investment law introduceda provision according to which “[t]he present law - and
the rights, guarantees, privileges and protections established by the present law - shall apply equally to foreign
investors thatinvested in the Republic of Kosovo prior to the effective date of this law.” (Exhs. C-18/R-19).

132

465.

466.

whichever is earlier, as determined in accordance with recognised
principles of valuation.

Because the relevant events in connection with Mabco’s expropriation claim unfolded in
steps over a substantial period of time, identifying the events out of which that claim arose
is not an entirely straightforward matter. Assuming, as the parties do, that the operative
event, in terms of appropriation, is the withdrawal of the shares, a number of dates present
themselves for consideration. At numerous points in time between October and December
2011, the PAK indicated that it was seriously contemplating withdrawal of the shares.

However, an actual decision to do so was not taken until 16 December 2011 593

However, notwithstanding the 16 December 2011 decision, in the months that followed,
Claimant and PAK engaged in a number of communications and meetings which gave the
impression that that decision was not in fact definitive. The record indicates that the PAK
invited Messrs. Pacolli, Berisha and Ejupi to a January 2012 meeting to discuss the matter
and thereafter informed them that, subject to Claimant providing certain documentation
and a bank guarantee, it would not withdraw the shares.>"4 There ensued a further meeting
on 12 February 2012, following which Mr. Lluka informed Mr. Pacollithat the PAK Board
would meet again on 12 March 2012 before making a final decision on the Grand Hotel on
15 March 2012.5° In the interim, the PAK received a second audit report on management
of the Grand Hotel on 8 March 2012.5 Mr. Lluka himself testified that at the 15 March
2012 meeting, the PAK Board decided to suspend any withdrawal of the shares, due to the
interest shown by potential investors, all of whom, including the Pacollis, the PAK viewed
as new investors.5°7 PAK appears then to have postponed its decision on withdrawal of the

shares that was initially scheduled for 15 March 2012.5°8 On 19 March 2012, the PAK

contacted Selim Pacolli and Ms. Ejupi, requesting them to provide further information by
21 March 2012.59 In response, on 28 March 2012, UTC, NTSH and Mabetex Project
Engineering submitted to the PAK the Annex Agreement that has been agreed upon by
them,*!° along with a Business Plan and Performance Guarantee.5!! The last exchanges
between Claimant and the PAK occurred in April 2012, during which, in Claimant’s
contention, the PAK reiterated its prior requests for a bribe.>!? Under these circumstances,
the Tribunal cannot conclude with confidence that the operative event was the decision of

16 December 2011.

However, moving forward in time, it is uncontested that on 31 May 2012 the PAK took the
official decision to order execution of the withdrawal of shares. Without doubt, the dispute
itself, and not merely events leading up to it, had arisen by that time, which was some two
weeks prior to the BIT’s entry into force on 13 June 2012. The Tribunal cannot accept
Claimant’s suggestion that the operative date was 20 July 2012 (a date obviously well after
entry into force of the BIT) when the withdrawal of shares was actually executed.*!3 The

PAK’s decision of 31 May 2012 was already sufficiently definitive.

The Tribunal accordingly finds that, by virtue of BIT Article 2, it lacks jurisdiction over

Mabco’s expropriation claim ratione temporis.

As noted, the 2005 Foreign Investment Law contains no provision comparable to Article 2
of the BIT. There is therefore no reason, from a ratione temporis point of view, why

Claimant’s expropriation claim under the Foreign Investment Law cannot proceed.°!+

54 The provisions of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law mostrelevant to expropriation are these:

134

(b) Denial of Fair and Equitable Treatment Claim

470. The BIT’s fair and equitable treatment clause, Article 4(1), readsas follows:

Each Contracting Party shall in its territory accord to investments
and returns of investors of the other Contracting Party at all times
fair and equitable treatment as well as full protection and security.
Neither Contracting Party shall impair by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures the management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment, extension or disposal of such investments.

471. Claimant has not described in great detail what, apart from the alleged expropriation itself,
might constitute a denial of fair and equitable treatment. However, under a fair reading of
the pleadings, the purported unfairness and inequity appears to reside in the fact that,
according to the Claimant, the PAK, directly or through intermediaries, required Claimant
on more than one occasion to pay a bribe in order to have its ownership of the Grand Hotel
shares registered, an allegation confirmed by Mr. Ejupi,*!5 and that the PAK ultimately
withdrew the sharesas a result of Claimant’s refusal to pay any such bribe.*!° Accordingly,
the Tribunal understands Claimant’s position to be that, even if the KTA’s and PAK’s
actions and/or inactions are not found to constitute an expropriation, withdrawal of the
shares due to Claimant’s refusal to participate in the alleged bribes amounted to a denial of

fair and equitable treatment.

Article 8

8.1. The items described in Article 7.1 shall also not be subject to any act of
expropriation by or attributable to Kosovo.

8.2. Notwithstanding the prohibition contained in Article 8.1, Kosovo may take
an act of expropriation affecting an asset ofa foreign investor, foreign investment
organization or foreign person, if theact of expropriation:

a. is for aclearly defined and legitimate public purpose;

b. is not inspired by any discriminatory objective;

472.

473.

474.

475.

Assuming that to be the essence of the asserted denial of fair and equitable treatment, the
Tribunal’s task in connection with Mabco’s claim is, once again, to determine whether the
events giving rise to that claim occurred before or after the date of the BIT’s entry into
force. According to Claimant, the PAK’s attempts to bribe took place in the early months
of 2012, well before the BIT came into effect. However, the Tribunal does not consider the
alleged offers of a bribe to be the event that gave rise to Mabco’s fair and equitable
treatment claim. The event that gave rise to that claim would be PAK’s alleged decision to
withdraw the shares due to Claimant’s refusal to be bribed. However, as already determined
(paras. 464-468, supra), that event could have occurred as early as 16 December 2011 or
as late as 31 May 2012. But, under either hypothesis, the event or events that gave rise to
the dispute took place prior to the BIT’s entry into force on 13 June 2012. Mabco’s claim
of denial of fair and equitable treatment under the BIT therefore also cannot proceed

ratione temporis.

On the other hand, since the 2005 Foreign Investment Law, unlike the BIT, contains no
limitation ratione temporis, Mabco’s claim of unfair and inequitable treatment, absent any

other jurisdictional barrier, may proceed.5!7

(c) Denial of Justice Claim
Finally, Claimant states a denial of justice claim arising out of its treatment by the courts

of Kosovo.*!8

The BIT does not contain a freestanding denial of justice clause, but Article 5(2) does

guarantee access to the courts of the host State in connection with an expropriation claim:

*'7 The most pertinent provision of the 2005 Foreign Investment Law on fair and equitable treatment is as follows:

Article 3
3.1 Kosovo shallaccord fair and equitable treatment to foreign investors and their

[D]ue process of law includes the right of an investor of a
Contracting Party which claims to be affected by expropriation by
the other Contracting Party to prompt review of its case, including
the valuation of its investment and the payment of compensation in
accordance with the provisions of this Article, by a judicial
authority or another competent and independent authority of the
latter Contracting Party.

Also, even if Claimant does not prevail on its expropriation claim, it remains possible for

it to pursue a denial of justice claim in connection with its allegations of denial of fair and

equitable treatment.

476. Claimant found itself in the courts of Kosovo at several intervals, some of them prior to
the BIT’s entry into forces, others subsequentto it. Because the event out of which a denial
of justice arises is the action or inaction, as the case may be, of a court, the Tribunal looks

presumptively at the date on which Mabco’s claims were definitively resolved.

477. Claimant does not base its denial of justice claim on its 2007 litigation against UTC. The
legal proceedings in the courts of Kosovo of which Claimant complains and that might

potentially give rise to a denial of justice claim on Mabco’s part include the following:

a. the June 2012 action by UTC against the PAK in the Supreme Court of Kosovo,*!? in
connection with which Claimant and NTSH sought to intervene, a request that the

SCSC’s Appellate Panel denied on 26 June 2014;

b. the action in the SCSC that Claimant and NTSH brought on 19 November 2012 for
annulment of the PAK’s decision,°2° which was dismissed by an undated judgment as

time-barred;52!_ and

c. the constitutional complaint filed by Claimant and NTSH on 17 November 2014 which

the Constitution Court dismissed as inadmissible. 522 In either event, since the courts in

these proceedings only disposed of Mabco’s claims definitively after the entry into

force of the BIT on 14 June 2012, they are subject to it.

As concerns Mabco’s denial of justice claims under the Foreign Investment Law, since the
acts upon which those claims are based arose after the entry into force of the 2014 Law on
24 January 2014, they are subject to that law rather than the 2005 law. Though the 2014
Law does not specifically identify denial ofjustice as a cognizable claim, Article 8, paras. 1
and 3, guarantee due process of law. Also, as under the BIT, protection against denial of
justice may conceivably be read into and pursued under the rubric of the 2014 Law’s

guarantee of fair and equitable treatment.

Accordingly, the claims that Mabco attributes to the judgments in these proceedings fall
within this Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratio temporis, and are to be considered under both the

BIT and the 2014 Foreign Investment Law.

THE CLAIM FALLS OUTSIDE THE SCOPE AND PURPOSE OF THE ICSID
CONVENTION

Respondent’s next argument pertains to the ICSID Convention only, and neither the BIT
nor the Foreign investment Law. It maintains that the claim advanced here falls outside the

scope and purpose of the ICSID Convention in two respects:

(1) The claim is at variance with the purposes of the ICSID Convention.
(2) Mr. Pacolli’s involvement in this proceeding constitutes double-hatting and is

procedurally unfair.
(1) ‘THE CLAIM IS AT VARIANCE WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE ICSID CONVENTION

(a) Respondent’s Position

Respondent points out that the very first letters sent to the PAK in which Mabco was
identified as the alleged owner of the shares were dated June 2012, immediately after the
BIT between Switzerland and Kosovo went into effect.5?3 The suggestion is that Mr.

Pacolli acted in bad faith by transforminga claim that he had all along advanced in his own

483.

484.

name into a claim purportedly belonging to Claimant purely to take advantage of the

BIT.524 This amounts to an abuse of process.525

Also, in Respondent’s view, the claims being advanced in this arbitration are properly

directed to UTC, not Respondent.526

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant denies that it has in any way committed an abuse of process. Its submission of
the present dispute is in every respect legitimate and conforms to the requirements and
purposes of the BIT, the Foreign Investment Law and the ICSID Convention. Citing
arbitral jurisprudence, *7 Claimant underscores the heavy burden that a party bears in
establishing an abuse of process on the part of its opponent.*?8 It contends that Respondent

“has not even come close” to discharging that burden.*29

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and findings

Any argument that Mr. Pacolli acted in bad faith by transforming a personal claim of his
into a claim purportedly belonging to Claimant, purely to take advantage of the BIT,
naturally presupposes that, prior to the BIT’s entry into force, the claim belonged only to
Mr. Pacolli, and not to Claimant. The Tribunal has already determined (paras. 339-345,
supra) that, despite the fact that he signed the great majority of documents and
communications in his own name, Mr. Pacolli was at all times acting in a representative
capacity on behalf of Claimant. To the extent that the basis for Respondent’s assertion that

the Tribunal’s entertainment of the claims in this case does not comport with the ICSID

Convention’s purposes is that any investment that was made was made by Mr. Pacolli and

not Claimant, Respondent’s assertion must fail.

It seems to the Tribunal likely that Respondent also considers it contrary to the purposes
of the ICSID Convention for a member of the government of a host State to assert claims,
through a controlled foreign company, against his own government. That question is taken

up more directly in the next section.

(2) MR. PACOLLI’S INVOLVEMENT IN THIS PROCEEDING CONSTITUTES DOUBLE-
HATTING AND IS PROCEDURALLY UNFAIR

(a) Respondent’s Position

According to Respondent, the Tribunal must not entertain a claim by an individual against
the very government of which he or she is a member, which is the situation in the present
case. Admittedly, parties are generally free to structure their investments so as to avail
themselves of a BIT from which they would otherwise not benefit. Nor is a minister
generally barred from asserting an international claim against his or her own government
through a foreign-incorporated company. However, since Claimant is not a “real foreign

investor, its initiation of this arbitration represents an abuse of process.”>3°

Also, Mr. Pacolli, as a member of the Government of Kosovo, would have access to
documents and other information, including confidential information, that a party does not
ordinarily enjoy vis-a-vis its opponent in an adversarial proceeding. *3! Mr. Pacolli, again
as Government member, would also participate in decisions the Respondent will take in
this proceeding, including even the decision to advance payment to ICSID of the costs of
the arbitration that Mr. Pacolli has himself brought. The situation represents a form of

double-hatting. 532

490.

(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant rejects the notion that Mr. Pacolli’s involvement in this proceeding constitutes
double-hatting. In its view, Respondent once again fails to distinguish between Claimant,
a juridical person, and its owner, Mr. Pacolli, a natural person. A foreign corporate investor
is not defined in terms of its owner, even a controlling owner. According to Claimant,
there is neither in the text nor the purpose of the ICSID Convention any basis for denying
protection to a foreign investor on account of the fact that its owner is amember of the host

State’s government. 533

Claimant views the notion that Mr. Pacolli would be in a position to weaken or damage the
Government’s case before this Tribunal as implausible. Mr. Pacolli, being Foreign Minister
would have no access to the files and records of the Ministry of Justice, which is handling
this case.534 Moreover, on any occasion in which the present dispute would be the subject
of discussion or decision within the Government, Mr. Pacolli would be required to recuse
himself.535 More generally, Claimant posits that the very situation givingrise to the dispute
demonstrates that Mr. Pacolli’s position in the Government did not enable him to exert

influence over the actions of the PAK.

(c) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Findings

a. Maya member of the government of a host State maintain a claim against
that State under a BIT or the Foreign Investment Law?

The question thus raised assumes, by definition, that the claim in question belongs to and
is being asserted by a member of the host State’s government. That cannot be said to be
the case here. The Tribunal has already concluded that the putative investor is Mabco, not
Mr. Pacolli. That Mr. Pacolli owns and controls Claimant is of no consequence, at least as
long as the Claimant is not a “shell company” or otherwise purely fictional. Claimant,
which is duly incorporated in Switzerland and conducts its business there (see paras. 395-

396, supra), is entitled to be treated as a separate juridical entity. This would hardly be the

first instance of an investor-State claim properly brought by a foreign company owned and

controlled by a national of the host State.536

Is the situation altered in any way by the fact that the Claimant is not only a national of the
host State, but also a member of its government? (It will be recalled, supra para. 150, that,
at the time arbitration was initiated, Mr. Pacolli was First Deputy Prime Minister and
Minister of Foreign Affairs of Kosovo.) Although this scenario is highly unusual, possibly
unprecedented, the Tribunal sees no basis for treating a national of a host state any
differently on account of the fact that he or she is a member of that State’s government.
Neither the BIT nor the Foreign Investment Law, nor any case law of which the Tribunal
is aware, lends any support for a “carve-out” of this sort. The fact is that Mr. Pacolli was a
businessman at the same time as he held public office. He was entitled, as a businessman
legitimately operating through a foreign company, to the same protections as are available

to any other businessman.

b. Would Mr. Pacolli’s involvement in this proceeding constitute
impermissible “double-hatting” or otherwise be procedurally unfair?

The Tribunal cannot subscribe to the notion that Mr. Pacolli’s involvement in the present
case constitutes “double-hatting.” The term “double-hatting” is customarily used to denote
the situation in which an individual sitting as arbitrator in one case is acting at the same
time as advocate in another case and, more particularly, may be tempted to take positions
in his or her capacity as arbitrator that are designed to advance his or her case as advocate.

This is not an apt way of characterizing Mr. Pacolli’s posture in the present case. Mr.

536 See, e.g., Exh. CL-11: Tokios Tokeles v. Ukraine, Decision on Jurisdiction, 29 April 2004, para. 56; Waguih Elie
George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. The Arab Republic of Egypt, \CSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Decision on
Jurisdiction, 11 April 2007, para. 210.

Vandevelde writes:

Host-state investors potentially may ... obtain BIT protection for their investment
in their owncountry. These investors may incorporate a company under the laws
of the other BIT party and place ownership of their domestic investment in that
company. In the event that their government wrongfitlly injures their investment,
they can direct the company of the other BIT party that owns the investment to
submit a claim to investor-state arbitration against their own government for a
violation of the BIT.

Vandevelde, supra note 450, atpp. 162-163.

142

493.

494.

495.

Pacolli is performing no adjudicatory function whatsoever. As Claimant’s owner and chief

executive, his sole interest is advancement of Claimant’s case.

As for due process, the possibility cannot be excluded that Mr. Pacolli, and therefore
Claimant, possesses government documents, or access to government documents, of
assistance to Claimant that claimants in investor-State arbitration ordinarily do not have.
In the Tribunal’s judgment, however, this eventuality cannot bar the foreign company that
he owns from availing itself either of a BIT between the two countries or of the host-State’s
foreign investment law. It is not at all uncommon, in private litigation, for an officer of a
company to bring an action against that company and, in such capacity, similarly enjoy
access to documents and other information that some other claimant against that company
would not enjoy. To the Tribunal’s knowledge, it has never been held or even maintained,
that an officer of a company is on that basis disqualified from pursuing a claim against that

company that he or she would otherwise be in a position to pursue.

Nor does the Tribunal see how Respondent could be unfairly disadvantaged in this
proceeding by the fact that its opponent is or was owned by a member of Respondent’s
government. Respondent has ample means at its disposal, including removing Mr. Pacolli
from any discussions of the dispute within the government, to arrange its defense so as to
prevent Mr. Pacolli from interfering with or undermining it. Arguably, Claimant’s feltneed
to institute these proceedings suggests that he does not have undue influence over the

Government.

CLAIMANT HAS FAILED TO ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CAUSE OF
ACTION

(1) RESPONDENT’S POSITION

Lastly, Respondent maintains that Claimant’s Request for Arbitration, First Clarification
Submission and Counter-Memorial, taken together, fail to present a prima facie case on
the merits.537 It is neither a precise nora coherent exposition of the claim, including the

basis for alleging breaches of the BIT’s and the Foreign Investment Law’s standards of

557 Resp. oralargum., tr.24:16 — 25:3.

143

496.

497.

498.

499.

protection. The claim isalso insufficiently documented. In Respondent’s view, if Claimant
has any cause of action at all, it is a purely private cause of action against UTC and/or Mr.

Berisha. *38

In this connection, Respondent denies that any acts of extortion occurred, invoking in
support of that contention, the police investigation and decision not to prosecute. It even
denies that the so-called intermediaries (paras. 200, 471, supra) were ever affiliated with

or acted on behalf of the PAK. 53?

(2) CLAIMANT’s POSITION

Claimant asserts that, on the facts as presented, it has established a prima facie case. It has
demonstrated that Respondent expropriated its property without compensation in violation
of Article 5(1) of the BIT and denied Claimant fair and equitable treatment in violation of
Articles 4(1) and 4(2) of the BIT. It also committed a denial of justice in violation of Article

5(2) of the BIT.

Further, Respondenthas committed numerous breaches of its obligations under the Kosovo
Foreign Investment Law, including violation of fair and equitable treatment and national
treatment (Articles. 3 and 4); disappointment of investors’ good faith reliance on the
validity of host State law (Articles. 5(1) and 5(2)); and uncompensated expropriation
(Article 7).

As for the suggestion that Claimant’s action should be directed to UTC rather than the
Respondent, Claimant’s counsel disagrees, arguing that the violation essentially consisted
of Respondent’s refusal to register Claimant’s shares of stock in the Grand Hotel and its

withdrawal of the shares.540

502.

(3) THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS

As noted (para. 36, supra), on 22 December 2018, Respondent filed a preliminary objection
to the claim under Rule 41(5) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules on grounds of “manifest lack
of legal merit,” an objection that the Tribunal rejected on 7 February 2019. The Tribunal
now has the benefit of the Parties’ successive pleadings in this case as well as the
documentary and testimonial evidence they have adduced. In assessing whether Claimant
has established, with respect to its expropriation claim, a prima facie case — which of course
is a measurably higher standard than “manifest lack of legal merit” — the Tribunal recalls
that Claimant’s position in this proceeding is best understood as a claim of entitlement to
the Grand Hotel shares. Thus, it is not necessary at this stage for Claimant to prove
ownership. What Claimant must establish is that it has a colourable claim of entitlement to

those shares.

For reasons set out earlier in this Decision (see paras. 293-338, supra), the Tribunal finds
that Claimant has established a credible claim to the entitlement that it asserts in this
proceeding. While Mabco could have presented its claim more coherently than it did, its
showing is sufficient to defeat Respondent’s argument that Claimant has failed to establish

a prima facie case of expropriation.

It remains to determine whether Claimant has also made a prima facie case in support of
its claims of denial of fair and equitable treatment under the Foreign Investment Law and
denial of justice under the BIT and/or the Foreign Investment Law. As noted earlier (para.
471, supra), putting its expropriation claim to one side, Mabco’s claim that Respondent
denied it fair and equitable treatment rests essentially on the claim that the PAK withdrew
the shares to which Mabco claims entitlement on account of the fact that Mabco refused to
pay a bribe. An official police report of 22 August 2012 records an affirmation by Mr.
Pacolli of PAK authorities asking for bribes in exchange for registration of the shares, and
the truth of that affirmation is attested to both Selim Pacolli and Mr. Ejupi.54! Respondent

denies that any attempts at a bribe occurred, but given Mr. Pacolli’s affirmation to the

+4! Exh. C-30: Official Memorandum of the Republic of Kosovo, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Police General
Directorate, Crimes Investigation Directorate, 22 August2012.

145

503.

504.

authorities that such attempts occurred and Mr. Selim Pacolli’s and Mr. Ejupi’s
confirmation of that allegation, the Tribunal is reluctant to conclude that Claimant’s
assertion that Respondent violated its obligation of fair and equitable treatment has, for

jurisdictional purposes, no reasonable basis.

Mabco’s claim of denial of justice is considerably less well-developed. As best the Tribunal
can tell, Claimant does not object to the SCSC’s ruling that the claim brought before it by
Claimant and NTSH was time-barred under the applicable limitations period. Claimant
does, however, object to the SCSC Appellate Panel’s rejection of Claimant’s and NTSH’s
petition to intervene in UTC’s action against the PAK, as impermissibly based on the
rationale that UTC and the PAK objected to their intervention. Claimant also objects to the
Constitutional Court’s dismissal of its and NTSH’s complaint alleging violation by the
PAK of both the Constitution of Kosovo and the BIT on the basis of its claimed lack of
competence to examine the compatibility of national law with international agreements.*42
The Tribunal is not in a particularly good position to gauge the strength of Mabco’s claim
of denial of justice on these bases. However, Claimant has stated its strong objections, in
terms of principle, to the Appellate Panel’s and the Constitutional Court’s rulings, as well
as their basis — objections that Respondent has not yet addressed. Largely, on that basis the
Tribunal concludes that Mabco’s claims of denial of justice cannot be dismissed at this

stage.

CONCLUSION

In this Decision, the Tribunal has examined each of the jurisdictional objections raised by
Respondent. It has determined (a) that the claims advanced in this arbitration arise out of
or relate to an investment in Kosovo, (b) that Claimant is a foreign investor, (c) that
Claimant’s alleged ownership interest in shares of Grand Hotel LLC is a protected
investment, (d) that Respondent consented to arbitrate the present dispute, insofar as

Claimant was not subject to an election of remedies requirement and satisfied the BIT’s

requirement of prior consultation, (e) that the Tribunal has jurisdiction ratione temporis
over Mabco’s denial of justice claim under the BIT and over its claims of expropriation,

Convention, and (g) Claimant has established a prima facie case for its expropriation,

COSTS

CLAIMANT’S COST SUBMISSIONS

In its submission on costs, Claimant argues that Respondent “shall be ordered to reimburse
the Claimant for its payment of the advances in the amount of USD 137500,” and that,
“ijn an award all costs incurred, CHF 509’907.15 and USD 300’000.00 and EUR
5394.00, in relation to the jurisdictional phase of the proceedings shall be borne by the
Respondent.” Claimant also maintained its prayers for relief as stated in its post-hearing

brief.

Claimant’s legal fees and expenses totalling CHF 500,907.15, EUR 5,394 and USD

300,000, were broken down as follows:
Legal representation fee CHF 495,347.15
Travel costs CHF 5,660.00.
EUR 5,394.00.
Hotel fees and advances paid USD 300,000.

EUR 5,394.00.

USD 300,000.

Claimant makes it claim on the basis that all costs of the jurisdictional phase are solely due
to the Respondent’s meritless objections. It also argues that the length of the jurisdictional
proceedings and the costs thereby incurred are solely due to the Respondent’s conduct.
Claimant refers to Respondent’s failure to pay its share of the advance on costs, which
resulted in the proceedings being stayed for more than six months, and Respondent’s

requests for extension of time to file its submissions. *4

RESPONDENT’S COST SUBMISSIONS

In its submission on costs, Respondent submits that the Tribunal should order Claimant to
pay the Respondent’s full costs and expenses associated with defending against Claimant’s
claims including, in addition to the costs of the arbitrators and ICSID, the costs and
expenses for legal representation and of the Respondent’s own officials and witnesses in

an amount of EUR 505,433.36, together with interest thereon at a reasonable rate.

The Respondent’s legal fees and expenses totalling EUR 505,433.36 were broken down as

follows:
Legal representation fee EUR 490,000.
Counsel expenses EUR 7,390.73
Respondent’s own expenses EUR 4,388.24
Expenses of Mr. Shala EUR 3,654.39
Total EUR 505,433.36

Respondent argues that when a claimant’s claims are rejected for lack of jurisdiction,
numerous tribunals have followed the principle of “loser pays” or “costs follow the event”.

It also argues that Claimant’s claims are frivolous and abusive, and that Claimant should

be ordered to pay the costs occasioned by its faulty conduct in the proceedings, including

the postponement of the hearing and unnecessary procedural correspondence. *44

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON COSTS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including

attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

Because the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and this proceeding

shall continue into a merits phase, it defers a decision on cost allocation to a future date.
