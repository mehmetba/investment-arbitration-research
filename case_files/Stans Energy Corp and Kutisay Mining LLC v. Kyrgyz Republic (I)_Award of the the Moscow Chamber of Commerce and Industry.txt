Circumstances of the case

On October 30, 2013 the companies “Stans Energy Corp.” (the Province of
Ontario, Canada) and “Kutisay Mining” LLC (Kyrgyz Republic) (hereinafter
referred to as the Claimants) filed with the Arbitration at the Moscow Chamber of
Commerce and Industry (hereinafter referred to as the MCCI Arbitration) the
Statement of Claim against the Kyrgyz Republic (hereinafter referred to as the
Respondent), which stated the following.

The dispute between the Claimants and the Respondent is an investment
dispute; it arose out of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights
signed on March 28, 1997 in Moscow, and in accordance with Article 11 of the
said Convention it is a dispute related to investments made under this Convention;
the dispute is also based on the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in
the Kyrgyz Republic”.

Since 2010, the company “Stans Energy Corp.” had been making
investments into research of potential and development of reserves of rare and
rare-earth metals in Kemin region of Chui Oblast of the Kyrgyz Republic.
Investments are made through two of its subsidiaries registered as legal entities of
the Kyrgyz Republic “Stans Energy KG” LLC and “Kutisay Mining” LLC (earlier
JSC “Kutisay Mining”).

JSC “Kutisay Mining” was set up on December 9, 2009 as a joint-stock
company which sole founder was the company “Vesatel United Limited” (New
Zealand).

According to the Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
dated December 30, 2008 Ne 736, “Kutessay II” deposit was included into the List
of mineral deposits allocated on a competitive basis. On December 01, 2009 the
Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 725 (hereinafter referred
to as the Resolution Ne 725) was adopted amending this procedure. With para.1 of
the Resolution Ne 725 competitive procedures for granting rights to certain objects
of subsoil use (including “Kutessay II” deposit) were modified into the auction
stock-exchange procedures. With para.2 of the Resolution Ne 725 the Ministry of
Natural Resources was authorized to issue licenses for the objects of subsoil use to
legal entities, whose 100% of shares were managed by ZAO “Fund of
Development of the Kyrgyz Republic” (without holding a tender for a further
auction sale of shares of the mentioned legal entities).

On December 10, 2009 by Decision of the State Service for Regulation and
Supervision of Financial Markets under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
state registration of the inaugural issue of 19 million ordinary registered shares of
JSC “Kutisay Mining” at a face value of 1 som per share under No.
KG 0101202214 was made. The authorized capital stock of the company made up

2

19 million som. The owner placed the said shares into trust of ZAO “Fund of
Development of the Kyrgyz Republic”.

On December 21, 2009 the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and JSC “Kutisay
Mining” held negotiations formalized by the Minutes Ne 1736-N-09 and the
decision was made to grant to JSC “Kutisay Mining” the License Ne 2488 ME for
“Kutessay II’ deposit.

On December 29, 2009 the company “Stans Energy KG” LLC - a subsidiary
which sole participant is the company “Stans Energy Corp” — purchased from a
public auction (held at the instruction of ZAO “Fund of Development of the
Kyrgyz Republic” by the stock exchange "Central Asia Stock Exchange”) 100% of
shares of JSC “Kutisay Mining” (Contract Ne I 194), thus becoming its sole
shareholder.

On January 25, 2010 the said sole shareholder of JSC “Kutisay Mining”
made a decision on reorganization by way of transformation into a limited liability
company (“Kutisay Mining” LLC). Reorganization took place and the certificate
was issued. “Kutisay Mining” LLC became a legal successor of JSC “Kutisay
Mining”.

On June 26, 2012 the Committee for Development of Economic Industries
of the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic (Zhogorku Kenesh) passed a resolution
obligating the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to cancel the license agreement with “Kutisay
Mining” LLC in respect of “Kutessay IT” deposit.

This resulted into the following acts of the State Agency and the General
Prosecutor’s Office.

(1) Refusal to consider the programs of works at the deposit

In its letter dated March 12, 2013 the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic addressed to “Kutisay
Mining” LLC stated that “with a view to prevent violations of requirements of
regulatory acts governing industrial safety Gosgeolagency repeatedly refrains
from consideration of the submitted Program...”.

(2) Refusal to conduct state ecological expert examination

In its letter dated March 12, 2013 the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic addressed to “Kutisay
Mining” LLC set forth that “state ecological expert examination of the Project
“Repair of the access road “Open pit — Existing works” at the deposit “Kutessay
II” was suspended until the protest of the General Prosecutor’s Office against the
Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 725 dated December 1,
2012 has been finally considered.”

(3) Refusal to re-execute the license agreement

In its letter dated April 8, 2013 the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic addressed to “Kutisay
Mining” LLC specifically emphasized that “...the General Prosecutor’s Office of
the Kyrgyz Republic has filed with the Inter-district court of Bishkek the statement
of claim directly related to “Kutessay II” and “Kalessay” deposits. In light of the
recent events...Gosgeolagency sees no rationale for re-execution of the license
agreement ... and approval of the program of works without expert examination

(4) Judicial recourse

On April 04, 2013 the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic
filed an application with the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for invalidation of the Minutes of
direct negotiations between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company
“Kutisay Mining” dated December 21, 2009 Ne1736-N-09.

The Kyrgyz Republic declared that it was necessary to check to what extent
the regulatory legal act on which basis it granted the right to JSC “Kutisay Mining”
to obtain the license (Resolution Ne 725) before putting up its shares for sale at the
auction complied with the Kyrgyz legislation at the moment of its adoption.

Over three years had passed from the date of adoption of this act (December
1, 2009) till the date of filing of the application.

(5)Interim measures

On the basis of the application of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the
Kyrgyz Republic for injunctive measures aimed at securing the claim the judge of
the Inter-district court of the city of Bishkek Nurmanbetov E.B. ruled on April 15,
2013 that the following injunctive measures can be applied in respect of “Kutisay
Mining” LLC: “To bar “Kutisay Mining” LLC, private persons, state bodies and
their officials from making actions related to re-execution of the license agreement
as the supplement; extension thereof, issue of the next license supplement;
approval of projects, reports, work programs, feasibility studies; calculating the
payment for withholding the Licenses Ne 2488 ME and Ne 2489ME for the right to
use subsoil at the deposits “Kutessay II”, as well as the actions aimed at transfer or
alienation of the right of subsoil use at the deposit “Kutessay II” to third parties,
including alienation of a share in the charter capital of the company”.

The petition of “Kutisay Mining” LLC and Ak-Tyuz ajyil okmotu (rural
administration) to repeal the interim measures for securing the claim was

completely dismissed by Decision of the Inter-district court of the city of Bishkek
of May 29, 2013.

As became known in the course of the case hearings on April 29-30, 2014,
on March 19, 2014 the Inter-district court of Bishkek (judge Nurmanbetov E.B.)
satisfied the application of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic
and declared invalid the Minutes Ne1736-N-09 of direct negotiations between the
State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the
Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company “Kutisay Mining” dated
December 21, 2009.

“Kutisay Mining” LLC disagreed with the decision of the Inter-district court
of the city of Bishkek dated March 19, 2014 and filed an appeal against it which is
currently pending in the court.

The Statement of Claim further sets forth that the Claimants are Investors
making investments in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic in accordance with the
Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997 and the
Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”.

Investments of the Claimants are cash assets, purchased fixed assets and
intangible assets as well as the rights to carry out subsoil use activity transferred
under the license.

The actions of the Respondent described in the Statement of Claim (refusal
to consider the programs of works at the deposit, refusal to conduct state ecological
expert examination, refusal to re-execute the license agreement as supplement and
subsequent interim measures aimed at securing the claim) constitute a wrongful act
which resulted into unlawful expropriation of investments.

Besides in the course of making investments the Kyrgyz Republic
permanently violated the standard of fair treatment of investments.

It is underlined in the Statement of Claim that unlawful expropriation and
violation of a fair treatment of investments triggers international responsibility of a
state in form of full compensation for damages on the basis of Chapter 2 Part 2 of
the Articles “Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts” adopted
by the UN International Law Commission and approved by the UN General
Assembly at its 56 session in 2001 — Document A/56/10.

According to provisions of part 4 Article 9 of the Convention for the
Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28,1997, the investor is entitled to be
compensated for damages caused to him as a result of decisions or actions
(omissions) of the state bodies or officials which contradict the legislation of the
recipient country and the rules of international law. In line with Article 10 of this
Convention, in the case described in part 4 Article 9 of the said Convention the

5

damages shall be compensated in accordance with the rules of national legislation
of the recipient country.

Based on the foregoing the Claimants requested to obligate the Respondent:

- to compensate the Claimants for the value of investments in the amount
specified in the Appraisal Report as a measure of liability for expropriation of
investments as well as in connection with the fact that the investors and
investments were not granted fair treatment and unconditional protection.

The amount of 117 853 000 USD determined in the Appraisal Report is a
measure of liability for expropriation and at the same time the maximum amount of
liability for violation of the fair treatment;

- to pay compound interests on the amount of damages determined by the
arbitration, with monthly capitalization, as of the date of the award till the date of
payment at a refinancing rate of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic;

- to reimburse the Claimants for the arbitration costs, including the costs of
legal representation of the Claimants’ interests during examination of the present
dispute in arbitration.

On March 13, 2014 the MCCI Arbitration received from the Claimants the
linguistic opinion of experts L. Yu. Ivanov and M.F. Arkhipova dated March 6,
2014, the expert opinion of the Doctor of Law, Professor K.M. Ilyasova dated
March 12, 2014 and the legal opinion of D.E. Ubyshev dated March 9, 2014.

In particular, experts L. Yu. Ivanov and M.F. Arkhipova were to answer the
following questions:

- whether the term “arbitration” and the terminologically set phrase
“international ad hoc arbitration (commercial court) constituted under the
Arbitration Rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law” in subpara.

23

(b) para.2 Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic” dated February 07, 2003 (as amended and supplemented on
22.10.2009) are used as repetitions of one and the same notion or as different
notions;

- how the term “arbitration” in subpara. (b) para.2 Article 18 of the Law of
the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” should be
interpreted from the linguistic point of view.

In answering the first question, the experts pointed out that in the syntactical
’ and the terminologically set
phrase “international ad hoc arbitration (commercial court) constituted under the

structure of this sentence the term “arbitration’
Arbitration Rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law” are
homogeneous members of the sentence conjunct with an alternative conjunction
or. Russian grammar and explanatory dictionaries of the Russian language
stipulate that the conjunction or formalizes the relationship of partitioning (mutual
exclusion).

Thus, in the present context the conjunction or formalizes the relationship of
mutual exclusion of two notions, respectively expressed by the term “arbitration”
and the terminologically set phrase “international ad hoc arbitration (commercial
court) constituted under the Arbitration Rules of the UN Commission on
International Trade Law”. Hence, the term “arbitration” and the terminologically
set phrase “international ad hoc arbitration (commercial court) constituted under
the Arbitration Rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law” are used
to denote not identical but different, mutually excluding notions. This conclusion is
also confirmed by punctuation in this text (subpara. (b) para.2 Article 18 of the
Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”). No
comma is put in front of a single alternative conjunction or, which connects
homogeneous members of the sentence related to each other as mutually
excluding.

Answering the next question, the experts noted in particular that the term
“arbitration” in para. 2(b) Article 18 of the Law means any international
arbitration, save for the international ad hoc arbitration constituted under the Rules
of the UN Commission on International Trade Law.

Para.2 Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic” grants to investor the right to submit the dispute to:

1) international ad hoc arbitration constituted under the Rules of the UN
Commission on International Trade Law;

2) any other international commercial arbitration.

In her Opinion Doctor of Law, Professor K.M. Ilyasova stated the following.
She gave the following answer to the question: to which bodies for settlement of

24

investment disputes a foreign investor may have recourse on the basis of para. 2
Article 18 of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”. The
contents of para. 2 Article 18 of the said Law give rise to the question as to which
bodies are competent to examine investment disputes between a foreign investor
and state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic according to subpara. “b’”. In line with the
mentioned subparagraph, such bodies include arbitration or international ad hoc
arbitration (commercial court) set up in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of
the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law.

Such bodies for settlement of investment disputes as “arbitration” or
“{nternational ad hoc arbitration...” are denoted through the conjunctive “or”. In
the Russian language “or” is a disjunctive conjunction which expresses an
alternative. It connects homogeneous members of the sentence which are related to
each other as mutually excluding.

Therefore, in respect of resolution of investment disputes the legislator
provides in subpara. “b” para.2 Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” dated March 27, 2003 for the two categories
of arbitration as the bodies competent to settle investment disputes between a
foreign investor and the state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic: international ad hoc
arbitration under the Rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law
(commonly, it is called ad hoc arbitration in accordance with the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules) or any other arbitration. At the same time, in the opinion of the
expert, the phrase “only in the case of a dispute between a foreign investor and a
state body” included in para. 2 Article 18 is indicative of the fact that international
arbitration is concerned.

The expert has arrived at a conclusion that para. 2 Article 18 of the Law of
the Kyrgyz Republic dated March 27, 2003 “On Investments in the Kyrgyz
Republic” stipulates the right of a foreign investor to have recourse to any
international arbitration, along with the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID) and international ad hoc arbitration (commercial
court) set up under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law, for resolution of an investment dispute.

The expert gave the following answer to the question of whether Article 11
of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s rights contains specific
obligations or whether it is an “umbrella” clause containing blanket rules which are
to be specified in future. According to Article 11 of the Convention for the
Protection of Investor’s Rights, disputes related to investment making under the
present Convention shall be settled by the courts or arbitration courts of the
countries-parties to the disputes, by the Economic Court of the Commonwealth of

25

Independent States and/or other international courts or international arbitration
courts.

Article 22 of the mentioned Convention stipulates that the Convention may
serve as the basis for conclusion by the Parties of bilateral agreements protecting
the investor’s rights. If necessary, separate provisions of the Convention can be
specified in bilateral agreements.

The expert noted that, in her opinion, taking into account the subject of
regulation of this Article, provisions of Article 11 of the Convention for the
Protection of Investor’s rights need not be specified in bilateral agreements. Thus,
the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s rights does not cover disputes
arising between the Contracting Party and the investor of the other Contracting
Party in respect of investment (investor - state), whereas bilateral agreements on
promotion and reciprocal protection of investments contain provisions regarding
dispute settlement between the Contracting Party and the investor of the other
Contracting Party in respect of investment.

Besides, the expert noted that Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection
of Investor’s Rights, contains mandatory provisions in respect of the bodies which
are competent to examine investment disputes on the basis of the mentioned
Convention, and does not require further specification through other international
agreements or the agreement of the parties to a dispute. If, according to this article,
the arbitration body not named in this article were be specified, there would have
been a phrase “agreed by the parties to the dispute”, “by agreement of the parties”,
etc.

From the legal viewpoint, the wording of Article 11 of the Convention for
the Protection of Investor’s Rights represents a unilateral obligation included into a
multilateral international treaty of each state which applies this treaty. The core
essence of such unilateral obligation is the following: in case of a dispute between
the state applying this treaty and any investor falling under the requirements of the
Convention, the state will consent to the jurisdiction of any of the bodies for
settlement of investment disputes listed in Article 11.

The following answer was given to the question to which dispute settlement
bodies Investor may refer on the basis of Article 11 of the Convention for the
Protection of Investor’s Rights. The Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights provides for four alternative ways to settle the disputes arising in
connection with making investments by two or more investors to which the states-
participants to the Convention consent:

- a state court (arbitration court) of the country against which the claim is
filed (in the state against which the investor files its claim there will be one state

26

court or state arbitration court competent and having jurisdiction over the case.
Thus, a specific court is concerned);

- the Economic Court of the Commonwealth of Independent States (a
specific court with its seat in Minsk);

- other (along with the Economic Court of the CIS) international courts;

- international arbitration courts.

Article 11 contains the consent of the state to the fact that the Investor may
have recourse to any of the dispute settlement bodies listed in the article. It grants
the right to the Investor to refer to any international arbitration court (in the RF this
is an arbitration court to which the law on international arbitration will apply).
However this does not mean that any international arbitration court will accept the
statement of claim. In order for the application to be a success the investor may
refer only to that arbitration court which is competent by virtue of its Rules to
examine the disputes arising in the course of making investments and which will
initiate proceedings in the case. Thus, for instance, according to Article 1 of the
Law of the Kyrgyz Republic dated July 30, 2002 “On Arbitration Courts in the
Kyrgyz Republic”, the present Law will apply in the course of submission, by
agreement of the parties, to an arbitration court of the disputes arising out of civil
law relations, including investment disputes, falling within the jurisdiction of a
competent court, except for the disputes indicated by the present Law.

The expert gave the following answer to the question of whether
incorporation into Article 11 of the term “international arbitration court” means the
right of the state to refer to any international arbitration court and whether the
granting of such right is not “absurd”. The term “international commercial
arbitration” being incorporated into the treaty is subject to international law and
shall be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the 1969 Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties. A treaty is interpreted in accordance with
Article 31 and 32 of the mentioned Convention. The basic rule of interpretation
stipulated in paragraph | Article 31 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties reads: “A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context as well as in
view of the object and purpose of the treaty.”

The meaning of the expression “disputes ...shall be examined...by
international arbitration courts” should be interpreted basing on the presence (or
absence) of the qualifying, explanatory or otherwise specifying words related to
this expression. If such words and structures are missing, the meaning of the
expression shall be interpreted as including all components forming it (all
international arbitration courts).

27

Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights reads as
follows:

“Disputes related to investment making under the present Convention shall
be examined by the courts or arbitration courts of the states-parties to the disputes,
by the Economic Court of the Commonwealth of Independent States and/or other
international courts or international arbitration courts”.

There are no words or expressions in this text qualifying, explaining or
otherwise specifying the meaning of the phrase “disputes. ..shall be examined ...by
international arbitration courts.” This means that disputes arising in connection
with investment making shall be examined by any international arbitration courts
(without any restrictions).

At the same time there is a clear limitation of the term “arbitration court”.
Disputes may be settled only by those arbitration courts which are international.

In the preamble to the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights it is
noted that effective protection of the rights of an investor is a prerequisite for the
development of the Parties’ economies.

According to Article 8 of the mentioned Convention, investments in the
territory of the Parties shall enjoy “unconditional legal protection”. Effective and
unconditional legal protection can not be accorded to a foreign investor without
granting to it the right of recourse to international mechanisms of dispute
settlement, the most effective among which are international arbitration courts.

Article 24 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights sets
forth that for the purpose of resolution of eventual disputes and claims, including
pecuniary ones, the provisions of this Convention shall continue to apply in respect
of the withdrawn Party till final settlement of all issues in dispute.

Herewith it is underlined that the Convention creates an effective mechanism
of settlement of disputes and claims.

Basing on Article 32 of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,
recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, if determination of
the meaning on the basis of a general rule of interpretation: a) leaves the meaning
ambiguous or obscure; or b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or
unreasonable.

On the basis of the foregoing the expert arrived at a conclusion that
determination of the meaning of the term “international arbitration court” as a
result of interpretation of Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights in accordance with which investor has an opportunity to choose
any international arbitration court suitable to it for examination of an investment
dispute may in no way be called absurd. Moreover, this method can be described

28

as the optimal and most efficient method of protection of investments for the
investor.

On March 13, 2014 the Opinion of the Experts, Expert Opinion, Legal
Opinion received from the Claimants on March 13, 2014 were sent to the Embassy
of the Kyrgyz Republic (ref. Ne 85, delivered through the chancellery of the
Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic, received on March 13, 2014).

The Opinion of the Experts, Expert Opinion, Legal Opinion received from
the Claimants on March 13, 2014 were also sent:

On March 13, 2014 — to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic (ref. Ne 86),
sent by DHK, number of consignment note 7472496780, received on March 17,
2014;

On March 13, 2014 — to the Prime-Minister of the Kyrgyz Republic (ref.Ne
87), sent by DHK, number of consignment note 7472496776, received on March
17, 2014;

On March 13, 2014 — to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz
Republic (ref. Ne 88), sent by DHK, number of consignment note 7472496765,
received on March 17, 2014;

On March 13, 2014 — to the Director of State Agency for Geology and
Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (ref.Ne 89), sent
by DHK, number of consignment note 7472496662, received on March 17, 2014.

On March 20, 2014 the MCCI Arbitration received from the State Agency
for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
the Motion for postponement of the proceedings. It was stated therein that the time
limits of dispute examination do not allow the Respondent to choose a law firm for
protection of its rights, since they don’t take into account long internal terms of
approval of draft decisions related to selection of a law company with the
government bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic.

On March 20, 2014 the Motion of the State Agency for Geology and
Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic was sent to the
Claimants’ representatives per e-mail (received on March 20, 2014).

Having considered the Motion the Arbitral tribunal rendered the following
Ruling on March 25, 2014:

- after examination of the Motion submitted on March 20, 2014 and signed
by the Director of the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic D.T. Zilaliev for postponement of the
proceedings in the case for a later date (nor earlier than July 30, 2014), taking into
account formation of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic, responsibility for
violation of the legislation of Kyrgyzstan as well as preparation of the Statement of
Defence by the selected law firm,

29

- recognizing that the Statement of claim was filed with the MCCI
Arbitration in October 2013 and that, according to the Kyrgyz party, the work
related to selection of a law firm for representation of the interests of the Kyrgyz
Republic in the present proceedings was completed on January 30, 2014; having
understanding for the political situation in the Kyrgyz Republic as well as for the
rule-making procedures related to selection of a law firm which are in effect in the
Kyrgyz Republic, the Arbitral tribunal can not agree with the position expressed in
the Motion dated March 20, 2014 to the effect that the time limits for examination
and hearing in the case established by the MCCI Arbitration completely ignore the
internal deadlines of approval of draft decisions of the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic, different degrees of responsibility for their violation and actually incite
any public officer making a decision in connection with the present case to commit
a violation of the rules of law in effect in the Kyrgyz Republic, since it is exactly at
the request of the Kyrgyz Republic that the hearing in the case was repeatedly
postponed in order to afford the opportunity to properly represent the interests. On
the contrary, the Arbitral tribunal, basing on the requirement of a fair dispute
resolution and on the need to grant to each party the opportunity to state its case,
has repeatedly satisfied the motions of the Kyrgyz Republic and postponed the
case hearing for three times,

- recognizing that the Motion dated February 5, 2014 signed by the Director
of the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of
the Kyrgyz Republic D.T. Zilaliev contains a statement to the effect that the
Arbitral tribunal has no jurisdiction to examine the statement of claim filed by the
Claimants. It also sets forth as follows: for the purpose of saving the resources
related to the hearing on the merits (including carrying out of expert examination,
witness testimony and presentation of the case by the parties) we ask the Arbitral
tribunal to examine and resolve the issue of its jurisdiction as a preliminary issue
with rendering of respective ruling (decision), however, as we note and request
below, only after granting to the Kyrgyz Republic — the Respondent in the case —
the opportunity to prepare and submit detailed arguments proving that the Arbitral
tribunal has no jurisdiction and the resulting consequences thereof,

- recognizing that the Motion for postponement of the hearing and
examination of the issue of jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to resolve this
dispute was granted both in respect of resolution of the issue on jurisdiction as a
preliminary issue and in respect of postponement of the case hearing,

- taking into account that the Respondent was granted the time for
preparation of the position on this issue,

- taking into account the subjects of the dispute, one of which is the Kyrgyz
Republic, which state sovereignty is greatly respected by the Arbitral tribunal and

30

which has deep understanding for the issues covered in the Motion filed on March
20, 2014, and that the other party to the dispute is in particular a foreign investor
which referred to the MCCI Arbitration for protection of its rights,

- taking into account that in accordance with Article 18 of the Law of the RF
“On International Commercial Arbitration” dated July 07, 1993 each party shall be
granted every opportunity to state its case and taking into account that the hearing
in the case was postponed three times at the request of the Kyrgyz Republic, the
law firm for representation in the case was selected in January 2014, the Arbitral
tribunal holds that the Kyrgyz Republic was afforded every opportunity to state its
case,

- recognizing that about five months have elapsed since filing of the
Statement of Claim by the Claimants with the MCCI Arbitration, having respect
for the requirements of the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic regarding execution
of the contract with the chosen law firm and believing that for making any action
reasonable time periods meeting the requirements of the legislation of the Kyrgyz
Republic and at the same time not representing an insurmountable hindrance for
the Claimants to protect their rights are necessary,

- taking into account that the principle of equality of the parties is anchored
in Article 24 of the Arbitration Rules of the MCCI and that the generally
recognized principle of international arbitration is that the parties use their
procedural rights in good faith,

the arbitral tribunal ruled that the Motion of the Respondent for
postponement of the proceedings in the case for a later date (not earlier than July
2014) should be dismissed and the proceedings should be continued.

On March 25, 2014 the above Ruling was sent to the Claimants’
representatives per e-mail (received on March 26, 2014).

On March 25, 2014 the Ruling of March 25, 2014 was sent to the
Respondent per e-mail (received on March 25, 2014). On March 25, 2014 the
Ruling of March 25, 2014 was sent to the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (received on March 25,
2014).

On March 31, 2014 the Arbitral tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction of the
MCCI Arbitration to examine the dispute. Since the Respondent duly notified of
the date and venue of the hearing was not represented in the hearing the Arbitral
tribunal examined the possibility to conduct the hearing in its absence and heard
the position of the Claimants’ representatives.

Being guided by provisions of Articles 25 and 18 of the Law of the RF “On
International Commercial Arbitration” and Article 46 of the Arbitration Rules of
the MCCI, the Arbitral tribunal considered it possible to examine the issue of

31

jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration over the dispute in the absence of the
Respondent’s representatives.

The Arbitral tribunal examined the Claimants’ Statement of Claim and the
extended Statement of Claim and the above mentioned declarations made by the
Respondent on the lack jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to settle the dispute.
The representatives of the Claimants were also heard.

On the basis of Article 16 of the RF Law “On International Commercial
Arbitration” and paragraph 3 Article 3 of the MCCI Arbitration Rules the Ruling
was passed. According to paragraph | of this Ruling, the jurisdiction of the MCCI
Arbitration to examine the dispute was recognized. The Ruling set forth that the
reasons related to the jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration will be put forward in
the decision on the merits of the dispute.

The hearing on the merits was scheduled for April 29, 2014.

On April 10, 2014 the Ruling dated March 31, 2014 (ref. Ne 106) was
delivered personally to the Claimants’ representative on April 11, 2014.

2014;

On April 10, 2014 — notice of the date of the hearing set for April 29, 2014
(ref. Ne 112) was delivered to the Claimants’ representative personally on April 11,
2014.

The notice of the date of the hearing set for April 29, 2014 was sent to the
Respondent:

32

On April 10, 2014 - to the Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic in the Russian
Federation (ref. Ne 113), sent by DHL, number of consignment note 7472496916,
received on April 11, 2014;

On April 10, 2014 - to the President of the Kyrgyz Republic (ref. Ne 114),
sent by DHL, number of consignment note 7472496905, received on April 14,

115), sent by DHL, number of consignment note 7472496894, received on April

Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic (ref.Ne 117),
sent by DHL, number of consignment note 7472496872, received on April 14,
2014.

On April 26, 2014 the MCCI Arbitration received from the Centre of judicial
representation of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic the Motion dated April
25, 2014 for postponement of dispute resolution, by which the Respondent
informed the Arbitral tribunal that it had sent to the Moscow City Arbitration Court
the application for revocation of the ruling of the MCCI Arbitration dated March
31, 2014. In connection with the abovementioned the Respondent requested to
postpone the dispute resolution till examination by the Moscow City Arbitration
Court of the declaration on the lack of jurisdiction of the Arbitration court. The
original Motion was delivered to the MCCI Arbitration on April 28, 2014.

On April 28, 2014 the mentioned Motion for postponement of the arbitration
proceedings was sent per e-mail to the Claimants’ representatives. This motion was
received by them on April 28, 2014.

Since this Motion is dated April 25, 2014, it was sent to the MCCI
Arbitration on April 26, 2014 (in electronic form) and on April 28, 2014 (in paper
form), it was therefore considered by the Arbitral tribunal in the hearing on April
29, 2014.

As far as the postponement of the dispute resolution till examination by the
Moscow City Arbitration Court of the declaration on the lack of jurisdiction of the
Arbitral tribunal is concerned, the Claimants’ representatives told the following.
The Ruling of the MCCI Arbitration dated March 31, 2014 in the matter Ne A-
2013/09 is not “a ruling of the Arbitral tribunal on a preliminary issue”. As
provided for by paragraph 3 Article 16 of the Law of the RF “On International
Commercial Arbitration”, if the arbitral tribunal rules as a preliminary issue that it

33

has jurisdiction, any party may within 30 days upon receipt of the notice of such
ruling request the arbitration court to pass a decision on this issue. In this case no
such ruling was passed; on the contrary, the Ruling of March 31, 2014 stated that
the issue of jurisdiction will be dealt with in the award on the merits of the dispute
and the reasons related to jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration over this dispute
will be set forth in the award of the MCCI Arbitration. They emphasized that
according to para. 3 Article 16 of the RF Law “On International Commercial
Arbitration”, if either party requests a decision of the arbitration court on this issue,
“pending the decision over the request of the party, the arbitral tribunal may
continue the proceedings and render an award.” Therefore, the Claimants’
representatives insisted on examination of the dispute on the merits.

On jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to examine the present dispute

Existence of an arbitration agreement in the present case and specificity
of conclusion of an arbitration agreement in the State-Investor relations

In the Claimants’ opinion, the procedure of conclusion of an arbitration
agreement in investment arbitration, the parties to which are a state and an
investor, shall be determined in a multilateral or bilateral agreement on the
promotion and protection of investments or in the national legislation of the state.

A treaty or a national law contains a unilateral obligation of the state
(consent of the state to the fact that investor may file a claim against it with any
international body for settlement of investment disputes). Specific bodies or a
certain category of bodies may be designated. This is a unilateral public law
obligation of the state which is included into a treaty or a national law and is
subject to international public law.

At the moment of filing the statement of claim with the body chosen by an
investor the investor expresses its consent and in such a way concludes an
arbitration agreement.

Obligations of the Kyrgyz Republic in respect of settlement of
investment disputes in the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights
dated March 28, 1997

Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights provides

as follows:
“Disputes related to making investments under the present Convention shall
be settled by courts or arbitration courts of the countries — participants to the
34

disputes, by the Economic Court of the Commonwealth of Independent States
and/or other international courts or international arbitration courts.”

Based on this Article, Investors are entitled to apply to “international
arbitration courts”. Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights dated March 28, 1997 contains no reservation to the effect that the courts
which will be agreed upon by the states participating in the Convention are
concerned.

Contemporary international law does not contain any limitation in respect of
a degree of specification of the state’s obligations.

Provisions of Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights entitle the Investor to apply to “international arbitration court”.

The term “international arbitration court” should be interpreted in
accordance with the provisions of the 1969 Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (Article 31): a treaty shall be interpreted in accordance with the ordinary
meaning to be given to the terms of a treaty.

The Claimants have submitted the Linguistic Opinion prepared by the
candidate of philological sciences Ivanov L.Yu. and Master of Linguistics
Arkhipova M.N. The Opinion contains the conclusion to the effect that the text of
Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March
28, 1997 contains no words or expressions qualifying, explaining or otherwise
specifying the meaning of the expression (standardized cliche) “disputes...shall be
settled...by international arbitration courts”. This means that settlement of disputes
arising out of investments shall be examined by any international arbitration courts
(without any limitations).

The representative of the Claimants noted that this wording was not unusual
and cited excerpts from some treaties:

1) Agreement between the Government of the USSR and the Government of
the Republic of Korea on Promotion and Reciprocal Protection of Capital
Investments dated December 14, 1990

Article 9

“2. In case if any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of
the other Contracting Party in respect of investments of the latter, related either to
compensation provided for by Articles 4 and 5 of the present Agreement or to any
other issues resulting from the act of expropriation in accordance with Article 5 of
the present Agreement, or related to the consequences of non-performance or
undue performance of obligations under Article 6 of the present Agreement, can
not be settled amicably within three (3) months of the date when either party has

35

offered an amicable settlement of the dispute, it will be referred by the investor
to arbitration.”

2) Convention on settlement in arbitration of civil law disputes arising out of
relations of economic and scientific-technical cooperation dated May 26, 1972

Article IL.1.

“Disputes specified in Article I shall be settled in an arbitration court at
the chamber of commerce in the respondent country or, by agreement of the
parties, in a third country which is a participant to the present Convention”.

3) General terms of supply of goods between CMEA member countries 1968
/ 1988 (1968 / 1988 CMEA GTS)
Chapter XIV. ARBITRATION.

“All disputes which may arise out of the contract or in connection therewith
shall be subject, with the exclusion of the courts of general jurisdiction, to
examination by arbitration in an arbitration court set up for this purpose in
the country of respondent or, by agreement of the parties, in a third country-
member of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance”.

4) General terms of supply of goods from the member countries of the
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance to the Republic of Finland and from the
Republic of Finland to the member countries of the Council for Mutual Economic
Assistance (CMEA-Finland GTS)(November, 1978)

“16.1.2. In respect of arbitration the following procedure shall apply:

Where the seller is an organization of the CMEA member country, the
dispute shall be examined by an arbitration court at the chamber of commerce
(and industry) of the seller’s country, moreover the arbitration rules of the court
in which the dispute is examined shall apply”.

Obligations of the Kyrgyz Republic in respect of examination of
investment disputes fixed in the national legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic

Basing on para. 2 Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic dated March
27, 2003 “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, “an investment dispute
between an investor and state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic shall be settled by
judicial bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic, unless in case of a dispute between a
foreign investor and a state body either party requests to examine the dispute in

accordance with either of the following procedures by referral:
36

b) to arbitration or international ad hoc arbitration (commercial court) set
up in accordance with the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law. The bodies for settlement of investment disputes, such as
“arbitration” or “international _ad_hoc arbitration” are denoted through the
conjunction or.

The Claimants’ representative referred to the Linguistic Opinion prepared by
the candidate of philological sciences Ivanov L.Yu. and Master of Linguistics
Arkhipova M.N. In this Opinion the conclusion is made that the conjunction “or” is
a disjunctive conjunction in the Russian language expressing an alternative. It
connects homogeneous members of the sentence related to each other as mutually
excluding. Hence, in the opinion of the Claimants, the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic
“On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” provides for two categories of
arbitrations as the bodies competent to examine investment disputes:

1) international ad hoc arbitration in accordance with the Rules of the UN
Commission on International Trade Law (usually it is called ad hoc arbitration
under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules), or

2) any other arbitration.

In the opinion of the Claimants, this paragraph allows to apply to any
international arbitration.

A similar provision is contained in the Federal Law of the Russian
Federation dated July 9, 1999 “On Foreign Investments in the Russian Federation”.
As stipulated in Article 10 of this Law, “a dispute of a foreign investor which arose
in connection with carrying out investments and entrepreneurial activity in the
territory of the Russian Federation shall be settled in accordance with international
treaties of the Russian Federation and federal laws in the court or arbitration court
or international arbitration court (court of referees)”. In accordance with this article
investors from the states with which there are no treaties have the right to refer to
any international arbitration court “in accordance with the law”.

The Claimants’ representative noted that the MCCI Arbitration earlier
rendered the awards in two investment disputes — in the action of Mr. Lee Jong
Baek and “Central Asia FEZ Development Corporation” LLC, Kyrgyz Republic,
and in the action of “O.K.K.V.” LLC (developer) and participants of a shared-
equity construction (shared construction participants), the Kyrgyz Republic, the
Republic of Kazakhstan against the Kyrgyz Republic. In its awards in the above
mentioned cases the MCCI Arbitration also examined the issue of jurisdiction,
primarily proceeding from Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997 and taking into account the provisions of
Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz

37

Republic”. In these cases the jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to examine the
dispute was recognized.

In the opinion of the Claimants’ representatives, the investor is entitled to
independently choose an international arbitration court bearing in mind that such
court should have the right to settle international disputes (be an international one)
and the right to settle investment disputes.

According to Article 1 of the Regulations approved by the Order of the
President of the Moscow CCI dated July 20, 2012 Ne 20, the MCCI Arbitration is a
permanent arbitration institution (court of referees) operating in accordance with
the Federal Law “On Arbitration Courts in the Russian Federation“ and the Law of
the Russian Federation “On International Commercial Arbitration”. In this case the
Law of the Russian Federation “On International Commercial Arbitration” dated
July 7, 1992 shall apply.

According to Article 1 of the Rules, the MCCI Arbitration is a permanent
arbitration institution (court of referees) set up by the Moscow CCI for settlement
of disputes out of contractual and other civil law relations in accordance with its
jurisdiction. Basing on para. 1.3 Article 3 of the Rules disputes in the sphere of
investment activity can be referred to the MCCI Arbitration.

Basing on para.2 Article 1 of the Rules of the MCCI Arbitration this
arbitration court acts as “international commercial arbitration”. By virtue of Article
2 of the Regulations on the MCCI Arbitration, “any dispute arising out of
contractual and civil law relations may be referred to arbitration by agreement of
the parties to arbitration proceedings”, and by virtue of para. 1(3) Article 3 of the
Rules of the MCCI Arbitration “civil law relations” disputes out of which may be
referred to the court include “disputes in the sphere of investment activity”.

The documents which underlie the work of the MCCI Arbitration do not
contain a prohibition to examine the disputes with participation of the state.

Definition of investor

Definition of investor under the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights of March 28, 1997

In the Statement of Claim and explanations in the case the Claimants’
representative drew attention to the fact that according to Article 1 of the
Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights: “investor is a state, legal or
natural person investing its own, borrowed or raised funds in the form of
investments”.

38

In accordance with Article 3 of the Convention as investors may act states,
legal and natural persons of both the Parties and third states, unless otherwise
provided for by national legislation of the Parties.

As set forth in Article 2 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights, rules and norms laid down by the Convention shall apply in the case when
persons of law from two and more states participate in the investment process.

Thus, the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights is intended to
regulate the relations in which the investors from two or more states participate,
irrespective of whether they are persons of the parties-signatories to the
Convention or third states.

According to Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights relations connected with making investments and the related activity of
investors are governed by the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights
dated March 28, 1997, national legislation of the states-participants to the
Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights as well as by international
treaties parties to which are signatories to the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights.

Definition of Investor in the national legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic

The Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”
recognizes as foreign investors natural persons — foreign citizens, legal entities
incorporated abroad, Kyrgyz legal entities controlled by foreign persons, foreign
organizations which are not legal entities and international organizations.

Para. 3 Article 1 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic” reads as follows:

Investor is a subject of investment activity investing its own, borrowed or
raised funds as direct investments.

Domestic investor means a legal entity or natural person of the Kyrgyz
Republic, a foreign citizen and person without citizenship having the status of a
resident in the Kyrgyz Republic and engaged in investment activity in the territory
of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Foreign investor means any natural person or legal entity which is not a
domestic investor investing into the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic, including:

1) a natural person who is a foreign citizen or person without citizenship,
permanently living outside the Kyrgyz Republic;

2) a legal entity which is either:

founded and registered in accordance with the legislation of a foreign state; or

39

founded with foreign participation, i.e. established in compliance with the
legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic:
a) entirely owned by one or more foreign natural, legal persons; or
b) controlled and managed by one or more foreign natural, legal persons on the
basis of a written contract, by way of the right to dispose of the majority of
shares, the right to appoint the majority of members of the executive or
supervisory body, or
c) at least one third percent of shares or shareholders’ votes of which is held by
foreign citizens, persons without citizenship permanently living outside the
Kyrgyz Republic or legal entities as referred to in this Article;
3) a legal entity set up on the basis of an international treaty of the Kyrgyz
Republic;
4) a foreign organization which is not a legal entity;
5) an international organization.

More detailed definition of Investors in respect of the dispute concerned

In the dispute concerned the investment process was carried out with
participation of the companies from Canada and the Kyrgyz Republic.

The company “Stans Energy Corp.” is a legal entity under the legislation of
Canada and a sole founder of “Stans Energy KG” LLC organized in the Kyrgyz
Republic. The company “Kutisay Mining” LLC is a limited liability company
under the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic founded by “Stans Energy KG” LLC.
Thus, we have here the subjects of civil law relations of the two states — Canada
and the Kyrgyz Republic.

At the request of the Arbitral tribunal the Claimants have enquired into the
relationship between the above mentioned companies and cleared up that for this
reason the mentioned companies have no isolated claims.

There is a parent company (“Stans Energy Corp.”), subsidiary (“daughter”
company) (“Stans Energy KG” LLC) and a_= second-tier subsidiary
(“granddaughter” company) “Kutisay Mining” LLC. The parent company makes
investments. The “granddaughter” company owns assets in the Kyrgyz Republic
acquired at the cost of the parent company. The “daughter” company is intended
for redistribution of funds from the parent company to the “granddaughter”
company (and other “granddaughter” companies).

All investments in the Kyrgyz Republic are owned by the parent company
and “granddaughter” company, therefore only the parent and “granddaughter”
companies appear in this case. At the same time their interests coincide and the

parent company exercises full control over the “granddaughter” company.
40

The fact that the funds invested through the “daughter” company into the
“granddaughter” company belong to the parent company was proved, at the request
of the Arbitral tribunal, with publicly available documents (in particular, tax
reporting of “Stans Energy Corp.” publicly available in Internet). It was also
evidenced by Mr. Savchenko G.A. who is the head of both the “daughter” and
“granddaughter” companies and who attended the hearings held on April 29-30,
2014.

The Claimants’ representative stressed that in the present case they act as
one party, since their interests completely coincide. Therefore, they should be
considered as a single party when rendering the award. Such approach is a
common practice in the course of rendering decisions in investment disputes with
participation of several investors with no separate claims. As an example the
decisions of ICSID', of the Arbitration Court at the Stockholm Chamber of
Commerce” and the MCCI Arbitration*® were named.

Investments

The Claimants’ representative noted that according to Article 1 of the
Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997:

“Investments are financial and tangible assets invested into different objects
of activity as well as the transferred rights to material and intellectual property with
a view of gaining profit (income) or achieving a social effect, unless they are not
withdrawn from the circulation or unless their circulation is not limited in
accordance with the national legislation of the Parties”.

According to para. 1 Article 1 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”:

“Investments mean tangible and intangible contributions of all kinds of
assets owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by investor into the objects of
economic activity with a view of gaining profit and (or) achieving any other useful
effect in the form of:

- money;

- movable and immovable property;

- property rights (mortgages, liens, pledges and others);
- stock and other forms of participation in a legal entity;

- bonds and other debenture liabilities;

- non-property rights (inter alia, the right to intellectual property including
goodwill, copyrights, patents, trade marks, industrial designs, technological
processes, trade names and know-how);

- any right to activity based on a license or otherwise permitted by state bodies of
the Kyrgyz Republic;

- concessions based on the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, including
concessions for prospecting, development, mining or exploitation of natural
resources of the Kyrgyz Republic;

- profit and revenue received from investments and re-invested in the territory of
the Kyrgyz Republic;

- other forms of investments that are not prohibited by the legislation of the Kyrgyz
Republic.

A form in which property is invested, or any change in this form shall not
influence its nature as investments.”

In his comments the representative of the Claimants explained that the
Canadian company “Stans Energy Corp.” invested funds into the shares of the JSC
“Kutisay Mining” set up in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic. This open joint-
stock company was subsequently reorganized into the limited liability company —
“Kutisay Mining” LLC. Acquisition of shares of this company meant acquisition
of the company itself and at the same time acquisition of the license for mining of
the rare-earth metals issued to this company.

The money was also invested into the property assets. Mr. Savchenko G.A.
who was present at the hearing on April 29-30, 2014 confirmed that except for the
license the acquired company had no other assets. The funds were invested into the
activity of the company (salaries, etc.).

Thus, there were investments in monetary form as well as investments which
changed their form and were transformed into the assets in a tangible form or in a
form of the license. In line with para. 1 Article 1 of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” this does not change their legal
characteristics as investments.

At the request of the Arbitral tribunal the Claimants paid special attention to
the answer to the question about the international legal precedents of recognition of
licenses as investments. In this connection the Claimants dwelled on the ICSID
cases Tecmed v Mexico’ and Middle East Cement v Egypt’.

* See Award in Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. (Spain) v. The United Mexican States, May 29,
2003 (ICSID case No. ARB(AF)/00/2).
5 See Award in Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. v. Egypt dated April 12, 2002 (ICSID case
No. ARB/99/6).
42

Upon examination of these cases the arbitrators which resolved the
mentioned disputes arrived at a conclusion that the licenses were considered as
investments and that termination of the license (de jure or de facto) was considered
as expropriation and unfair treatment of foreign investments.

The total volume of investments of Investors - the Claimants - is assessed in
the Appraisal Report (which is produced below in more detail).

The market value of the right to use the “Kutessay II” deposit as of the date
of suspension of the license for mining of “Kutessay II” deposit (as of June 25,
2002) totaled to 5.087.042.000 som (equivalent of 107.781.000° USD):

After acquisition of the company together with the license investments in it
made up:

- in the period from January 1, 2010 till June 25, 2012 (till the beginning of
actual expropriation) 353.933.000 som (equivalent of 7.499.000 USD’);

- in the period from June 26, 2012 (after the beginning of actual
expropriation) till September 1, 2013 125.383.000 som (equivalent of 2.573.000
USD‘).

Thus, the total amount of Investments made up 117.853.000 USD.

Expropriation
Timeline of expropriation

Expropriation of the Claimants’ investments was carried out in the following
way. The company “Kutisay Mining” was set up on December 9, 2009 as an open
joint-stock company which sole founder was the company “Vesatel United
Limited” incorporated in New Zealand.

On December 10, 2009 by Decision of the State Service for Regulation and
Supervision of Financial Markets under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
state registration of the inaugural issue of 19 million ordinary registered shares of
JSC “Kutisay Mining” at a face value of 1 som per share took place (the authorized
capital stock of the company made up 19 million som). The owner placed the
shares into trust of ZAO “Fund of Development of the Kyrgyz Republic”.

On December 21, 2009 the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and JSC “Kutisay
Mining” held negotiations formalized by the Minutes Ne 1736-N-09 and the

° According to the data of the KR NB as of June 25, 2012 - 1 USD = 47, 198 som.
7 According to the data of the KR NB as of June 25, 2012 - 1 USD = 47, 198 som.
‘ According to the data of the KR NB as of September 1, 2013 - 1 USD = 48,7243 som.
43

decision was made to grant to JSC “Kutisay Mining” the License Ne 2488 ME for
“Kutessay II’ deposit.

On December 29, 2009 the public auction held on the instructions of ZAO
“Fund of Development of the Kyrgyz Republic” by the stock exchange "Central
Asia Stock Exchange” for the sale of 100% of shares of JSC “Kutisay Mining” was
held. The company “Stans Energy KG” LLC purchased the shares, thus becoming
its sole shareholder.

On January 25, 2010 the sole shareholder of JSC “Kutisay Mining” made a
decision on reorganization of the open joint-stock company by way of
transformation into a limited liability company (“Kutisay Mining” LLC).
Reorganization took place and the certificate was issued. “Kutisay Mining” LLC
became a legal successor of JSC “Kutisay Mining”.

In such a way “Stans Energy KG” LLC purchased JSC “Kutisay Mining”
together with the already issued license.

The Claimants believe that after the Claimants have invested substantial funds
into the development of “Kutessay II” deposit the Kyrgyz Republic initiated the
measures for expropriation.

On June 26, 2012 the Committee for Development of Economic Industries
of the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic (Zhogorku Kenesh) passed a resolution
obligating the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to cancel the license agreement Ne 3 dated
June 15, 2012 with “Kutisay Mining” LLC in respect of “Kutessay II” deposit.

Thereafter, the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic ceased to perform in violation of the rules of
the Kyrgyz legislation its obligations towards “Kutisay Mining” LLC and in such a
way paved the way for termination of operations of “Kutisay Mining” LLC in
respect of mining of “Kutessay II” deposit.

This resulted in the following acts of the State Agency and the General
Prosecutor’s Office.

Refusal to consider the programs of works at the deposit

In its letter dated March 12, 2013 addressed to “Kutisay Mining” LLC the
State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the
Kyrgyz Republic stated that “with a view to prevent violations of requirements of
regulatory acts governing industrial safety Gosgeolagency repeatedly refrains
from consideration of the submitted Program...”.

44

Refusal to conduct state ecological expert examination

In its letter dated March 12, 2013 addressed to “Kutisay Mining” LLC the
State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the
Kyrgyz Republic stated that “state ecological expert examination of the Project
“Repair of the access road “Open pit — Existing works” at the deposit “Kutessay
Il’” was suspended until the protest of the General Prosecutor’s Office against the
Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 725 dated December 1,
2012 has been finally considered.”

Refusal to re-execute the license agreement

In its letter dated April 8, 2013 addressed to “Kutisay Mining” LLC the
State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the
Kyrgyz Republic specifically emphasized that “...the General Prosecutor’s Office
of the Kyrgyz Republic has filed with the Inter-district court of Bishkek the
statement of claim directly related to “Kutessay II” and “Kalessay” deposits. In
light of the recent events...Gosgeolagency sees no rationale for re-execution of the
license agreement ... and approval of the program of works without expert
examination

Judicial recourse

On April 04, 2013 the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic
filed an application with the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for invalidation of the Minutes of
direct negotiations between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company
“Kutisay Mining” dated December 21, 2009 Ne1736-N-09.

The Kyrgyz Republic declared that it was necessary to check to what extent
the regulatory legal act on which basis it granted the right to JSC “Kutisay Mining”
to obtain the license (Resolution Ne 725) before putting up its shares for sale at the
auction complied with the Kyrgyz legislation at the moment of its adoption.

Over three years had passed from the date of adoption of this act (1
December 2009) till the date of filing the application.

Interim measures
On the basis of the application of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the
Kyrgyz Republic for injunctive measures aimed at securing the claim the judge of
the Inter-district court of the city of Bishkek Nurmanbetov E.B. ruled on April 15,
2013 that the following injunctive measures can be applied in respect of “Kutisay
Mining” LLC: “To bar “Kutisay Mining” LLC, private persons, state bodies and
45

their officials from making actions related to re-execution of the license agreement
as the supplement; extension thereof, issue of the next license supplement;
approval of projects, reports, work programs, feasibility studies; calculating the
payment for withholding the Licenses Ne 2488 ME and Ne 2489ME for the right to
use subsoil at the deposits “Kutessay II”, as well as the actions aimed at the
transfer or alienation of the right of subsoil use at the deposit “Kutessay II” to
third parties, including alienation of a share in the charter capital of the company”.

The petition of “Kutisay Mining” LLC and Ak-Tyuz ajyil okmotu (rural
administration) to repeal the interim measures for securing the claim was
completely dismissed by Decision of the Inter-district court of the city of Bishkek
of May 29, 2013.

In the opinion of the Claimants, prohibition to re-execute the license
agreement as supplement, prohibition to extend it, to issue the next license
agreement means nothing else than prohibition to carry out subsoil use operations
which can not be carried out without these documents.

In the present case there is an actual deprivation of the Investor of the right
to carry out subsoil use activity through factual denial to it of the license which
gives the right to carry out such activity. What we have here is the Investor’s loss
of control over its investments and the loss of future revenues from its investments.

On March 19, 2014 the Inter-district court of Bishkek (judge Nurmanbetov
E.B.) satisfied the application of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz
Republic and declared invalid the Minutes Nel736-N-09 of direct negotiations
between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company “Kutisay
Mining” dated 21 December 2009.

“Kutisay Mining” LLC disagreed with the decision of the Inter-district court
of the city of Bishkek of March 19, 2014 and filed an appeal against it which is
currently pending in the court.

Illegality of actions of the Kyrgyz Republic

In the opinion of the Claimants, illegality of actions of the Kyrgyz Republic
in the course of expropriation manifested itself in the following.

Biased behavior of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz

Republic
As was already mentioned, on June 26, 2012 the Committee for
Development of Economic Industries of the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic
(Zhogorku Kenesh) passed a resolution obligating the State Agency for Geology
46

and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to cancel
the license agreement Ne 3 dated June 15, 2012 with “Kutisay Mining” LLC in
respect of the “Kutessay II’ deposit.

Thereafter, the Kyrgyz Republic started searching for legal grounds for such
cancellation. This fact in itself is evident of a biased and bad-faith conduct of the
General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic.

The General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic applied to the court
and requested to declare invalid the Minutes Ne1736-N-09 of direct negotiations
between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company “Kutisay
Mining” dated December 21, 2009. The General Prosecutor’s Office proceeded
from the fact that a regulatory legal act on which basis JSC “Kutisay Mining” was
granted by way of the mentioned Minutes the right to obtain the license
(Resolution Ne 725), before putting up for sale its shares in the auction, does not
comply with the Kyrgyz legislation as of the moment of its adoption.

In reality:

1) The Minutes Nel1736-N-09 of direct negotiations between the State
Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company “Kutisay Mining” dated December
21, 2009 was not the basis for issuance of the license. The license was issued on
the basis of Resolution Ne 725 (paragraph 2 of this Resolution contains an
instruction to the Ministry of Natural Resources to issue the license). This
Resolution was invalidated by the Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic Ne 337 dated June 10, 2013 in connection with drafting the Resolution of
the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 350 dated June 13, 2013. It was in
effect till that moment. Hence, all actions made on its basis were legal and should
be recognized as valid.

2) Resolution Ne 725 was in full conformity with the Kyrgyz legislation
According to Article 16 of the Law of the Ne 42 “On Subsoil” dated June 24,
1997 (as in force in the period from November 29, 2006 till October 28, 2011), the
right to use subsoil is granted by way of holing an auction and direct negotiations.
The auctions are announced and held in respect of gold ore, oil, gas and other
objects of general national importance by resolution of the Government of the
Kyrgyz Republic.
A list of deposits of general national importance did not exist till adoption on
June 13, 2013 of the Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 350
47

“On the State of Affairs in the Mining Industry and its Development Outlook”.
Hence, till mid 2013 the auctions were to be held only in respect of gold ore, oil
and gas deposits. Therefore, both as of the date of the decision on issuance of the
license to use subsoil on “Kutessay II’ deposit - December 21, 2009, and the date
of issuance of the License Ne 2488 ME — September 20, 2010 in respect of other
objects the right to use subsoil could be granted in the sense of Article 16 of the
Law of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 42 “On Subsoil” dated June 24, 1997 (as in force
in the period from November 29, 2006 till October 28, 2011) by way of direct
negotiations.

Thus, under the law concerned there was a possibility to grant the right to
use subsoil in respect of deposits which were not gold ore, oil and gas deposits
without holding an auction. At the same time a specific procedure of granting the
rights to use subsoil was determined by the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
which was vested with authorities in the sphere of “development and improvement
of the system of fee-based subsoil use”, “development and implementation of
investment policy in the sphere of subsoil use, raising of investments for geological
study of subsurface and mining of minerals” (paragraphs 4 and 5 of Article 5 of the
Law of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 42 “On Subsoil” dated July 2, 1997).

In line with Article 408 of the Civil Code of the Kyrgyz Republic which
provided for the possibility (but not obligation) to conclude a contract for transfer
of subsoil use rights by way of bidding in the form of an auction or a tender, the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic passed separate decisions on granting the
rights to use subsoil by way of bidding in the form of either an auction or a tender.
At first the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic approved by Resolution Ne 736
dated December 30, 2008 the List of deposits allocated on a competitive basis and
the amount of bonuses. “Kutessay II” deposit was included into this list under
number “23”. Thereafter, on December 1, 2009 the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic changed its decision adopting Resolution Ne 725:

“For the purpose of accelerated development of the mining industry in
direction of prospecting and development of mineral deposits with introduction of
effective methods of maximization of state revenues from their use;

In view of the need to implement the programs for promotion of
development of the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic and its business environment
through intensification of investment activity of the closed joint-stock company
(ZAO) “Fund of Development of the Kyrgyz Republic” which requires increase of
its equity capitalization;

With the intention to effectively use the tools of ZAO “Fund of
Development of the Kyrgyz Republic” in respect of monetization of subsoil use

48

rights by way of application of stock exchange procedures and mechanisms, so that
the state could get maximum benefit from such rights;

Taking into account the need to facilitate the development of the securities
market of the Kyrgyz Republic in order to secure full access of the maximum
number of potential investors to the process of acquisition of the rights for
exploration and mining of minerals,

the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic resolves:

1. To accept the proposal of the Ministry of Natural Resources of the Kyrgyz
Republic for transformation of tendering procedures for granting the rights to
certain subsoil use objects according to Exhibit N3 (A list of mineral deposits
allocated on a competitive basis and the amount of bonuses) to the Resolution of
the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic N736 dated December 30, 2008 (as
amended by the Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic N410 dated
June 25, 2009) into the auction stock exchange procedures of ZAO “Fund of
Development of the Kyrgyz Republic”.

2. The Ministry of Natural Resources of the Kyrgyz Republic shall issue
licenses for the objects of subsoil use listed in Exhibit No3 (List if mineral deposits
allocated on a competitive basis and the amount of bonuses) to the Resolution of
the Kyrgyz Republic N736 dated December 30, 2008 (as amended by the
Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic N410 dated June 25, 2009)
to legal entities 100% of shares of which are managed by ZAO “Fund of
Development of the Kyrgyz Republic”, without holding an auction for further sale
from the auction of the shares of the mentioned legal entities on the stock-
exchange (with payment by such legal entities of bonuses established by the
legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic).

“Kutessay II” deposit fell under subpara. 2 of the Ruling Ne 725. It was
indicated in Exhibit 3 to the Resolution Ne736. 100% of shares of JSC “Kutisay
Mining” were placed in trust of ZAO “Fund of Development of the Kyrgyz
Republic”.

In pursuance of para.2 of the Resolution Ne 725, the State Agency for
Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
and JSC “Kutisay Mining” held on December 21, 2009 direct negotiations which
were formalized by the Minutes Ne1736-N-09 and the decision was passed to issue
to JSC “Kutisay Mining” the Licenses No2488 ME and Ne2489 ME;

On December 29, 2009 the public auction held on the instructions of ZAO
“Fund of Development of the Kyrgyz Republic” by the stock exchange "Central
Asia Stock Exchange” for the sale of 100% of shares of JSC “Kutisay Mining” was
held. The company “Stans Energy KG” LLC purchased the shares. In the

49

announcement of the auction it was indicated that JSC “Kutisay Mining” owns the
license.

Thus, when issuing the License Ne 2488 ME dated September 20, 2010 to
JSC “Kutisay Mining”, the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic acted in strict compliance with the
requirements of the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.

At the same time the Inter-district court of Bishkek (judge Nurmanbetov
E.B.) satisfied on March 19, 2014 the application of the General Prosecutor’s
Office of the Kyrgyz Republic and declared invalid the Minutes Ne1736-N-09 of
direct negotiations between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company
“Kutisay Mining” dated December 21, 2009.

The decision was based on the fact that a regulatory legal act on which basis
the right to obtain the license was granted to JSC “Kutisay Mining” (Resolution Ne
725) before putting up for sale its shares did not comply with the Kyrgyz
legislation at the moment of its adoption.

The decision of the court was rendered in favour of the General Prosecutor’s
Office of the Kyrgyz Republic (the Claimant) on that basis that the Respondent
(the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of
the Kyrgyz Republic) admitted in full the claim of the General Prosecutor’s Office.

Admission of the claim by the Respondent entails satisfaction of claims by
the court (see page 5 of the Decision).

Attempt to gain profit from its own unlawful actions

The Claimants drew attention to the following. Even if one assumes that the
license was issued contrary to law, such illegal actions were committed by the state
body of the Kyrgyz Republic (the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic).

The Investor had nothing to do with such actions.

Being guided by a general principle of law “nobody has the right to derive
benefit from its own unlawful actions”, the Kyrgyz Republic has no right to
deprive the Investor of the license on the ground that this license was unlawfully
issued through its fault.

The above mentioned principle is included into the “general principles of
law recognized by civilized nations” which, basing on Article 38 of the Statute of
the International Court of Justice, are recognized as sources of international law.
This principle found its reflection in particular in para.4 Article 1 of the Civil Code

50

of the Russian Federation “nobody has the right to derive benefit from its unlawful
or bad-faith conduct”.

Investor as a bona fide purchaser

In their pleadings the Claimants noted that they acquired the company which
already had the license (i.e. that they are bona fide purchasers).

On December 21, 2009 the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and JSC “Kutisay
Mining” held negotiations formalized by the Minutes Ne 1736-N-09, and the
decision was made to grant to JSC “Kutisay Mining” the License Ne 2488 ME for
“Kutessay II’ deposit.

On December 29, 2009 the public auction held on the instructions of ZAO
“Fund of Development of the Kyrgyz Republic” by the stock exchange "Central
Asia Stock Exchange” for the sale of 100% of shares of JSC “Kutisay Mining” was
held. The company “Stans Energy KG” LLC purchased the share, thus becoming a
sole shareholder.

Hence, the Investor is a bona fide purchaser.

The issues related to a bona fide purchaser are governed by Article 291 of
the Civil Code of the Kyrgyz Republic. Basing on para.2 of this Article, “a bona
fide purchaser is the owner of the property it acquired for value, unless the
effective judicial act recognizes that such property was transferred out of
possession of the initial owner or the person to whom such property was
transferred into possession on grounds listed in paragraph 1 of the present Article”.

The following grounds are indicated in paragraph | of the Article: “when the
property was lost by the owner or the person to whom the owner transferred the
property into possession or was stolen from the either or was transferred out of
their possession otherwise against their will”.

In purchasing the shares the Investor acquired the property complex of JSC
“Kutisay Mining” which sole asset was the license. This license was neither lost
nor stolen from the initial holder of the right to subsoil use — the Kyrgyz Republic
as the state. It was neither transferred out of its possession against its will.

Legal characteristics of expropriation
Definition of expropriation under the Seoul Convention

As follows from Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights dated March 28, 1997, legal protection of investments is carried out, inter
alia, based on international treaties of the parties and national legislation.

International law definition of the term “expropriation” in contemporary
international law is found in Article 11(a) of the 1985 Seoul Convention
Establishing the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency’:

“ii) Expropriation and similar measures

any legislative action or administrative action or omission attributable to the
host government which has the effect of depriving the holder of a guarantee of his
ownership or control of, or a substantial benefit from, his investment... .”

Thus, expropriation means the measures which:

1) come from the host state;

2) may take the form both of a regulatory legal act (legislative measures) and
an individual act (administrative measures);

3) deprive the Investor of his ownership of his investment, control over it or
a substantial benefit therefrom.

Further the Claimants’ representative drew the attention to the court practice
in respect of definition of expropriation.

According to this arbitration practice, decisions of state bodies by which the
licenses are directly or indirectly revoked and the permits necessary for a foreign
investor to carry out business in the territory of the state are canceled are
considered as expropriation

ICSID case Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. (Spain) v. The United
Mexican States'° (hereinafter referred to as Tecmed).

The circumstances of this case are in many ways similar to the situation in
the present case.

When examining the case, Tecmed Tribunal found that the refusal to extend
the license constituted an act of expropriation. The company Tecmed incorporated
under the law of Spain made investments in the territory of Mexico through the
Mexican company Cytrar which shares were owned by its Mexican subsidiary

° The Kyrgyz Republic is a participant to the Convention since 1993

2003 (ICSID case No. ARB(AF)/00/2)..

Tecmed Mexico. In February 1996 Tecmed Mexico won the public auction and
obtained the license for operation of the landfill for hazardous industrial waste. The
license was issued for a period of one year with the possibility of its further
extension every year.

Within the next two years the calls of a local non-governmental organization
to shut down the landfill won political support. On November 25, 1998 the federal
agency refused to extend the license anew and ordered Cytrar to prepare a plan for
closing the landfill. The decision to refuse to extend the license was substantiated
with alleged violations of the license terms.

As a result, the decision in that case became the subject-matter of
examination by ISCID. In its award the Arbitral Tribunal noted that not only
compulsory seizure of movable or immovable property of the investor but also the
actions and conduct not directly purporting the deprivation of investor of its
property or rights but having exactly such consequences in practice should be
recognized as expropriation. In order to determine whether the refusal to extend the
license was a measure equivalent to expropriation, it is necessary to answer first of
all the question of whether the claimant was substantially deprived, as a result of
such decision, of the possibility to use its investments, since the rights related to its
investments, such as the right to derive revenue from the landfill operation ceased
to exist. In other words, whether the respective property has lost its value for the
investor as a result of actions of the state, and if so, to what extent then?!!

The Arbitral tribunal in that case specifically emphasized that in accordance
with international law the owner is considered to be deprived of its property also in
that cases when its use or income generation from its use becomes impossible,
even if in purely legal terms the ownership to such property remains inviolable.’

The arbitrators in that case arrived at a conclusion that the actions of the
state resulted in refusal to extend the license and in the shutdown of the landfill
(i.e. they led to impossibility of further use of the landfill for storage of hazardous
waste). The company Cytrar was barred from continuation of its commercial
activity, and the investor was deprived of the opportunity to gain income which it
expected to get from the use of the landfill. Since in that case the landfill was
concerned on which hazardous industrial waste was stored during 10 years, it could
not be used for any other purposes and as a consequence the facilities located on
that landfill could not be sold on the real estate market’.

When purchasing this land plot the investor did that with a single purpose —
to carry out activity related to storage of hazardous waste and to get revenue from
this activity. As a result of the decision to refuse to extend the license and
termination of the landfill operation the economic and commercial value, which
the investor, directly or indirectly, associated with this activity and the property it
used to carry out this activity was irreversibly destroyed.

Based on the foregoing the Tecmed tribunal found that the decision to refuse
to extend the license, taking into account its consequences, constitute the act of
expropriation in accordance with international law.'*

The investor invested funds into the buildings, structures, plant, etc. This
was made for the purpose of carrying out economic activity for the sake of which
all this was planned. Revocation of the license led to the fact that the economic
activity became senseless and impossible. And since it became impossible all these
buildings and structures became redundant. They are unmarketable, even at a
residual value nobody needs them at the place on which they are located.

Another example is the ICSID award in the case Middle East Cement
Shipping and Handling Co. v. Egypt'°

By Order Ne 13 dated January 19, 1983 the Egyptian Agency for
Investments and Free Economic Zones issued to the Claimant (Middle East
Cement) the license for importation and storage of cement in bulk in floating silos
erected in the free economic zone named Badr Cement Terminal (without customs
clearance prior to sale).

On May 28, 1989 the Ministry for Construction of Egypt adopted Decree Ne
195 prohibiting import of cement which resulted in the termination of operations of
the subsidiary Middle East Cement in the territory of Egypt. The company Middle
East Cement retained the possibility to store cement in silos but lost the
opportunity to import it to Egypt which made senseless the activity of the
company.

The case was examined by ICSID. The Claimant declared that the Decree Ne
195 of the Ministry for Construction as well as the subsequent conduct of the
Respondent constituted an actual revocation of the license.'®

The Respondent, in its turn, objected that the Decree was issued only 4
months prior to the date of expiration of the license term (September 1989).

However the Respondent did not contest that the investor was deprived of the
rights granted to it by the license, even if for a short period of 4 months.

Having examined the issue of whether the Decree Ne 195 was a measure
which effect was tantamount to expropriation, the arbitral panel in that case noted
the following: in case of adoption by the state of the measures which result in
deprivation of the investor of the possibility to gain profit from its investments,
even if the investor remains pro forma their owner, these are the measures which
consequences are similar to expropriation. In fact, as a result of adoption of such
measures the investor lost the value of its investments. The arbitral panel held that
this was exactly what had happened in the case Middle East Cement.'”

Based on the foregoing, the Arbitral panel found that the effect from
adoption of Decree Nel95 was equal to expropriation. The state adopted the
measures which consequence was deprivation of the investor of the possibility to
gain benefit from its investments. Even if the investor remains pro forma their
owner, such measures are the measures which implications are tantamount to
expropriation (measures similar to expropriation).

Expropriation and compensation for damages

As far as legal consequences of expropriation are concerned the Claimants
noted as follows:

As provided in Article 9 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights dated March 28, 1997, “investments are not subject to nationalization and
can not be exposed to requisition”, except for the cases when such measures are
permitted with payment of an adequate compensation. According to Article 7 of
the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997,
legal regulation in this sphere takes place on the basis of international treaties of
the parties and their national legislation.

According to Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments
in the Kyrgyz Republic”, investments shall not be subject to expropriation —
nationalization, requisition or other equivalent measures, including action or
omission on the part of the competent state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic which
resulted in compulsory seizure of the investor’s funds or its deprivation of the
possibility to use the results of investments. Expropriation of investments suggests
“compensation for damages including lost profit”.

In 2001 the UN Commission on International Trade Law adopted the Draft
Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts. This

"” See para. 107 of the Award in Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co. v. Egypt, April 12, 2002

(ICSID case No. ARB/99/6).

document represents a codification of customary rules of law on international
responsibility of states (which gained wide support in the doctrine of contemporary
investment law’’).

In accordance with Chapter 2 Part 2 of this document’? the forms of
compensation for harm are restitution (reinstatement), compensation and
satisfaction. They are interrelated to a certain degree. Each of them can be used
either independently or in combination with other forms.

In international investment law restitution is generally replaced in practice
with an adequate compensation (compensation of the value of investments as of
the date of expropriation). Additionally compensation may be required which
allows for indemnification in full. Mainly the compensation for lost profit is meant
here. Additional compensation should come second and be in place if an adequate
compensation is not commensurate with the caused damage. This conclusion is
confirmed by the practice of investment arbitration. The most widely cited judicial
decision proving this conclusion is the Decision of the Permanent Court of
International Justice in the case Factory at Chorzow dated September 13, 1928.”°

Satisfaction in international investment law is compensation for moral harm.
The issue of compensation for moral harm arises where the claim for compensation
for damage in connection with the loss of goodwill, business opportunities, image,
creditworthiness is filed. As the case in which the loss of business opportunities
was recognized one can cite the ICSID case Benvenuti & Bonfant v Congo, where
the claimant stated that it had lost investment opportunities in Italy in connection
with the absence of capital which was invested in full volume in Congo, that he
had lost credibility, etc.”’

Fait treatment
As far as fair treatment of foreign investments and consequences of violation
of this treatment are concerned, the Claimants have clarified as follows.

Obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment
The Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28,
1997 proceeds from the fact that the effective protection of investor’s rights is a

necessary prerequisite for the development of the parties’ economies. Article 8 of
the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997 sets
forth that legal protection of investments shall be secured by national legislation
and international treaties to which the parties are participants.

The Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”
establishes in its preamble the basic principles of the state investment policy aimed
at improvement of investment climate in the Republic and encouragement of
domestic and foreign investments by according fair, equitable treatment to the
investors and the guarantees of protection of the investments into the economy of
the Kyrgyz Republic raised by them.

Para.1 Article 10 of the Energy Charter Treaty (hereinafter referred to as the
ECT) to which the Kyrgyz Republic is a participant and which, in the opinion of
the Claimants, is applicable in this case by virtue of the reference in the national
legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic to international treaties, requires from the
Kyrgyz Republic to grant to investments a fair treatment, to ensure their protection
and security as well as prohibits to its participants, including the Kyrgyz Republic,
to infringe upon investments by way of application of unreasonable measures.

Fair and equitable treatment: interpretation

Para.1 Article 10 of the ECT provides for that a “fair and equitable”
treatment shall be accorded to investments.

It is evident that the term “fair” includes the term “equitable”. So, if one
removes this tautology, it will concern simply a fair treatment (which includes as
its component the “equitable” treatment).

Equitable treatment means non-discriminatory. The investors from Canada
should be granted the treatment not less favourable than foreign investors (MFN)
and national investors (national treatment).

Basing on para.! Article 10 of the ECT, along with equitable component a
fair treatment also supposes stable and transparent treatment of foreign
investments.

Para. | Article 10 of the ECT further sets forth the guarantees (standards)
which are a part of fair treatment specifying this notion: investments shall “enjoy
the most constant protection and security”. The host party “shall not in any way
impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal.”

s7

Stability in respect of foreign investments

Stability suggests predictability of conditions for making investments in the
country. In the ISCID award in Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. (Spain)
v. The United Mexican States the Arbitral tribunal, having examined the issue of
Mexico’s violation of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, noted that the
mentioned obligation was an expression of the bona fide principle which is
generally recognized in international law.” This standard means that foreign
investments should be accorded treatment not violating legitimate expectations
which the foreign investor had when making a decision to invest.

A foreign investor expects that the actions of the state towards it will be
consistent, unambiguous and completely transparent, so that it could know in
advance all rules and procedures which would regulate the investments it makes as
well as the purposes of adoption of any policy, administrative practice or
regulatory acts in order for the investor to be able to plan its investments and
comply with such rules. A foreign investor expects that the state will act
consistently, that is without unreasonable revocation of the earlier made decisions
or the earlier issued licenses, which were taken into account by investor when
assuming the obligations as well as when planning and initiating its commercial
operations. The investor also expects that the state will use legal instruments
regulating the activity of the investor and its investments in accordance with the
functions usually attributable to such instruments and not with a view to deprive
the investor of its investments without payment of compensation.”

In the present case the Kyrgyz Republic acted contrary to legal expectations
of the Investor. When acquiring the company with the license the Investor could
not “legitimately expect” that after three years it would be actually deprived of the
license.

Publicity (transparency)

In the course of examination of the case Metalclad Corp. v. United Mexican
States” it was noted that the principle of transparency means that all necessary
legal conditions for establishment, completion and successful operation of

investments made in the state should be known in advance to investors. Moreover
there should be no doubts or uncertainty in respect of such conditions.”°

In the present case the state (Kyrgyz Republic) issued the License Ne 2488
ME for “Kutessay II” deposit on the basis of a legal act (Resolution Ne725) which
consequently was declared in court by the state itself as contrary to law.

Le. the state issued to a foreign investor the license on a fee-paid basis
relying on the non-effective and illegal (in the opinion of the state) act which was
officially presented as effective and legitimate.

Protection and security

The guarantee of maximum protection and security anchored in the Energy
Charter Treaty is a reflection of this standard treatment under general international
law. In the ICSID case Asian Agricultural Products Ltd. (AAPL) v. Democratic
Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka” the arbitral panel noted that “maximum
protection and security” and “full protection and security” have been used in
bilateral treaties since XIX century. The minimum standard of the treatment which
arose already in those days includes ensuring physical security.””

The arbitral tribunal in the case PSEG Global et al. v. Republic of Turkey **
concluded that this treatment should be primarily considered in the context of
ensuring physical security, however in exceptional cases it can go beyond
protection against physical violence and extend to obligations to secure safe
investment environment. Some court decisions say that the state is concurrently
obliged to take necessary measures for securing the protection of investments
against any kind of illegal actions both on the part of private persons and state
bodies, irrespective of whether such actions had a nature of physical violence.
Thus, what is concerned here is protection against unlawful intervention of any
kind of persons into investment activity as well as denial of justice.

As was already mentioned, in the course of examination of the case Técnicas
Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. (Spain) v. The United Mexican States it was held
that the investor expects that the state will use legal instruments which regulate the
activity of the investor and its investments in accordance with the functions usually

attributable to such instruments and not with a view to deprive the investor of its
investments without payment of compensation.”

The Claimants’ representative drew attention to the fact that in the present
case the Kyrgyz Republic did not use due process of law. As was already
mentioned, on June 26, 2012 the Committee for Development of Economic
Industries at the Parliament (Zhogorku Kenesh) of the Kyrgyz Republic passed a
decision (which it was not authorized to pass in accordance with the Constitution
of the Kyrgyz Republic, since the resolution of such issues does not fall within the
competence of the Parliament) obligating the State Agency for Geology and
Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to cancel the
license agreement with “Kutisay Mining” LLC for “Kutissay II” deposit.

On March 19, 2014 the Inter-district court of Bishkek (judge Nurmanbetov
E.B.) satisfied the application of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz
Republic and declared invalid the Minutes Ne1736-N-09 of direct negotiations
between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company “Kutisay
Mining” dated 21 December 2009. The decision was based on that fact that the
regulatory legal act on which basis the right to obtain the license (Resolution Ne
725) was granted to JSC “Kutisay Mining” before putting up its shares for sale at
the auction did not comply with the Kyrgyz legislation at the time of its adoption.
As was shown above, there was no incompliance.

The decision of the court was rendered in favour of the General Prosecutor’s
Office of the Kyrgyz Republic (the Claimant) on that basis that the Respondent
(the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of
the Kyrgyz Republic) admitted in full the claim of the General Prosecutor’s Office.
And admission by the Respondent of the claim entails satisfaction of claims by
court.

All these measures resulted in interim measures aimed at securing the claim
which led to actual expropriation of the Claimants’ investments.

The foregoing allowed the Claimants to conclude that there is a clear
violation of a fair treatment in the present case:

1) actions of the Kyrgyz Republic violate legitimate expectations of the
Investor;

2) actions of the Kyrgyz Republic are non-transparent;

?° See para. 154 of the Award in Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. (Spain) v. The United Mexican
States, May 29, 2003 (ICSID case No. ARB(AF)/00/2).
60

3) the standard of maximum protection and security is also violated — legal
security of Investments and protection from illegal interference of Zhogorku
Kenesh, General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic and the court was not
ensured.

Thus, the interests of the Investor were infringed through unreasonable
measures.

The Claimants proceed from the fact that responsibility of the state for
violation of fair treatment (with due regard to proportionality) is similar to
responsibility for expropriation.

Claims of the Claimants

The right to be Pp ted for d in the legislation of the
Kyrgyz Republic

The Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”
contains Article 6 “Guarantees of protection from expropriation and compensation
of investors for damages”.

In accordance with para.1 Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On

 

Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, in case of expropriation of investments a
“timely, proper and real compensation for damages, including lost profit” shall be
paid.

As provided for by para.2 Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, such compensation includes:

1) a fair market value of expropriated investment;

2) a fairly calculated lost profit.

Claims of the Clai related to comp tion for d

The Claimants claim compensation of a fair market value of their
expropriated Investments.

The Investments were initially made in monetary form, however
subsequently they substantially changed their form (a change in the form of
investments does not affect their characteristic as investments).

The investor claims compensation of three types of Investments:

1) a fair market value of the right to use subsoil (formalized as the license)
as of the date of expropriation;

2) a fair market value of the property of “Kutisay Mining” LLC (fixed assets
— paragraphs 1-5 in the Table on page 2 of Exhibit Ne2 to Appraisal Report), as

61

well as of the investments into acquisition of a 100% shareholding in the
authorized capital of “Kashkinsky Plant of Rare-Earth Elements” LLC (para. 12);

3) monetary funds which constituted expenses (industrial, general,
administrative, charitable), including tax (bonus) on acquisition of the license
(paragraphs 6-11 in the Table on page 2 of Exhibit Ne 2 to Appraisal Report).
These costs were directed at carrying out the activity under the license for
development of the deposit, i.e. they were invested.

The amount of the claimed compensation is determined in the Appraisal
Report and is substantiated by the Claimants below.

Evaluation date
General approach in determining the evaluation date

Basing on para.2 Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” compensation shall be calculated as of the
date of decision on expropriation. In order to determine the amount of the
compensated damage it is necessary to establish the date on which such damage
should be calculated.

“Creeping expropriation”

Article 6 of the mentioned Law does not answer the question about the date
of expropriation if such expropriation was carried out on the basis of a series of
actions (such expropriation is usually called “creeping expropriation’’), like in the
present case.

Starting point of the expropriation was the Resolution of the Committee of
Zhogorku Kenesh of the Kyrgyz Republic for Development of Economic
Industries dated July 26, 2012. In the first sentence the following is fixed: “The
fact of unlawful issue of the license agreement to “Kutisay Mining” ...was
articulated by the deputy Badykeeva”. Le. no inspections were yet conducted, no
court hearing was held, however the fact of illegal issue of the license was already
articulated and the decision was made to obligate the State Agency for Geology
and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to revoke
the license agreement.

Thereafter there was a letter dated March 12, 2013 addressed to “Kutisay
Mining” LLC in which the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic stated that “with a view to prevent
violation of the requirements of regulatory acts Gosgeologagency refrains from

62

examination of the submitted program”. The same letter said that state ecological
expert examination of the project was suspended.

This was followed by the letter dated April 8, 2013 in which the State
Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic informed that re-execution of the license agreement was unreasonable.
And, finally, it came to application to the court and adoption of interim measures
for securing the claim on April 15, 2013.

All this was taking place over a period of 9 months (from July 26, 2012 till
April 15, 2013). After April 15, 2013 the de facto expropriation was launched
which transformed into de jure expropriation (court decision in favour of the
General Prosecutor’s Office, appeal).

Date of the “creeping expropriation”

Considering the date of the “creeping expropriation”, the Claimants’
representative dwelled on Article 15 of the Draft Articles on the Responsibility of
States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, basing on which the breach of an
international obligation by a state through a series of actions or omissions occurs
when the first wrongful action or omission takes place. The state bears
responsibility over the entire period starting with the first of the actions or
omissions of the series for as long as these actions or omissions are repeated and
remain not in conformity with the international obligations of states.

The international law doctrine acknowledges that the breach of international
obligations occurs when the first wrongful act took place, though responsibility
extends to all wrongful acts of the state. *°

Commencement of the “creeping expropriation”

The Claimants believe that the starting point of the “creeping expropriation”
was the Resolution of the Committee of the Parliament (Zhogorku Kenesh) of the
Kyrgyz Republic for Development of Economic Industries dated July 26, 2012. In
the first sentence of the Resolution the following is fixed: “The fact of unlawful
issue of the license agreement to “Kutisay Mining” ...was articulated by the
deputy Badykeeva” (i.e. no inspections were yet conducted, no court hearing was
held, however the fact of illegal issue of the license was already articulated). And
the decision was made to obligate the State Agency for Geology and Mineral

°° See Crawford, The International Law Commissions Articles on State Responsibility, above, n 132, 143-4.

Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to revoke the license
agreement.

Substantiation of the amount of compensation

Right to be compensated for damages

According to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic” the right to compensation follows from Article 6.

In line with para. 1 of this Article, in case of expropriation of investments a
“timely, proper and real compensation for damages, including lost profit” shall be
paid.

As follows from para.2 Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, such compensation includes:

1) a fair market value of expropriated investment;

2) a fairly calculated lost profit.

According to the Statement of Claim the Claimants request the MCCI
Arbitration to examine the present dispute, to declare the Respondent’s conduct as
internationally wrongful and to obligate the Respondent:

- to compensate the Claimants for the value of investments in the amount
specified in the Appraisal Report;

- to pay compound interests on the amount of damages awarded by the court,
with monthly capitalization, from the date of passing the award till the date of
payment at a refinancing rate established in the Kyrgyz Republic by the National
Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic;

- to compensate the Claimants for judicial costs, including the costs of legal
representation of their interests in the course of dispute examination by the court.

The Claimants’ representative explained that the Claimants do not claim
interests because the arbitration fee was not paid on that amount.

Compensation of the value of investments

The Claimants claim solely the compensation of a fair market value of the
expropriated investments.

According to the Appraisal Report (with due regard to the exchange rate
difference at different valuation dates in respect of different amounts and the
admissible round-up ) this amount totals to 117.853.000 USD and is made up of
the following claims:

64

1) payment of compensation of a fair market value of the right to subsoil use
(formalized as the license) as of the date of expropriation. In line with the
Appraisal Report this amount totals to 107.781.000 USD.

2) payment of compensation of a fair market value of the property of
“Kutisay Mining” LLC as of the date of expropriation (fixed assets — paragraphs 1-
5 in the Table on page 2 of Exhibit Ne2 to Appraisal Report), as well as of the
investments into acquisition of a 100% shareholding in the authorized capital of
“Kashkinsky Plant of Rare-Earth Elements” LLC (para. 12);

3) compensation of monetary funds which constituted expenses (industrial,
general, administrative, charitable), including tax (bonus) on acquisition of the
license (paragraphs 6-11 in the Table on page 2 of Exhibit Ne 2 to Appraisal
Report). These costs were directed at carrying out the activity under the license for
development of the deposit, i.e. they were invested.

The amount of claimed compensation as per points 2 and 3 is determined in
the Appraisal Report and itemized in Exhibit Ne 2 to the Report and made up:

- for a period from January 1, 2010 till June 25, 2012 — 7.499.000 USD;
- for a period from June 26, 2012 till September 1, 2013 —2.573.000 USD.

The reason for breaking down these investments into two phases is
explained by the fact that theoretically the Arbitral tribunal may refuse to
compensate for the costs incurred after the date of commencement of the creeping
expropriation. Therefore, for the sake of convenience of the Arbitral tribunal these
amounts were singled out.

Thus, the total amount of claims makes up 117.853.000 USD.

Currency of compensation

In line with the fourth part of Article 9 of the Convention for the Protection
of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997, “an investor is entitled to be
compensated for damages caused to it by decisions or actions (omission) of state
bodies or officials contradicting the legislation of the recipient country and the
rules of international law”.

Basing on the second part of Article 10 of the Convention for the Protection
of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997, “compensation for damages in the case
stipulated in the fourth part of Article 9 of the Convention shall be made in
accordance with the rules of national legislation of the recipient country”.

Based on para. 3 Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, “compensation shall be paid in a freely

convertible currency”.
65

Based on the above provisions of the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights and the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic” the Claimants’ claims are calculated in US dollars.

Expert opinion

The expert appraiser and General Director of the “Al-Star” Center of
Property Appraisal and Expert Examination” LLC Ignatenko Nina Sergeevna took
part in the hearings on April 29-30, 2014.

Representatives of the Claimants explained that expert Ignatenko Nina
Sergeevna is the head of the best known national company in the territory of the
Kyrgyz Republic in the sphere of appraisal - the “Al-Star” Center of Property
Appraisal and Expert Examination” LLC. The appraisal submitted by the expert
meets international standards and is absolutely independent.

Nina Sergeevna Ignatenko is a certified appraiser, expert appraiser of the
first category, professor, author of the textbook “Course in “Real estate
economics”, which is the educational textbook in the educational institutions of the
Kyrgyz Republic, including the Kyrgyz University. In the Exhibit Ne | to the
Report of the “Al-Star’ Center of Property Appraisal and Expert Examination”
LLC respective documents were submitted, in particular: Certificate of State
Registration of a Legal Entity, series GR Ne 029116, Certificate of the KR CCI Ne
003, Certificate of compliance Ne ON-004/12, Qualification Certificate Ne 002,
Diploma Ne 30.

The expert Ignatenko Nina Sergeevna is a leading appraiser in the territory
of the Kyrgyz Republic and works almost with all major companies. Since under
the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic no appraisal company has the right to give
its own appraisal in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, the “Al-Star’ Center of
Property Appraisal and Expert Examination” LLC is the only company in the
territory of the Kyrgyz Republic which verifies the appraisal of all major world
appraisal companies. The expert Ignatenko Nina Sergeevna is the author of the
textbook “Real estate economics” under which the appraisal practice is taught in
the whole territory of the former Soviet Union. The “Al-Star” Center of Property
Appraisal and Expert Examination” LLC has been awarded high distinctions from
the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic.

The expert Ignatenko Nina Sergeevna stated the following.
Under the contract concluded between “Kutisay Mining” LLC and the “Al-
Star” Center of Property Appraisal and Expert Examination” LLC dated August
16, 2013 the works in respect of appraisal of a market value of the right to use the
66

“Kutessay II” rare-earth elements deposit and direct costs incurred by the company
in the course of implementation of the project of development of the “Kutessay II”
deposit were carried out.

In the course of carrying out the appraisal regulatory documents in effect in
the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic were applied. In particular, the Appraisal
Standards binding for application by the entities of appraisal activity in the Kyrgyz
Republic approved by the Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
Ne 217 dated April 3, 2006. Besides, due to the absence in the Kyrgyz Republic of
a national law on appraisal activity, Provisional regulations on the activity of
appraisers and appraisal organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic approved by the
Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 537 dated August 21,
2003 apply.

The current standards of property evaluation in the Kyrgyz Republic are
harmonized, they comply with international appraisal standards, inter alia, in terms
of basic concepts, terminology and methodology of appraisal.

Based on the results of the work the following documents were submitted:
Explanatory Note to the Report Ne 01-09/13 dated September 5, 2013 (ref. Ne 05-
09/13) and summarized Report Ne 01-09/13 dated September 5, 2013, with
Exhibits 1-3, where basic facts ascertained as a result of the appraisal are set forth.

Exhibit Ne 2 represents a complete report on evaluation and determination of
a market value of direct costs incurred by the company “Kutisay Mining” LLC
over the period of holding the license for the development of “Kutessay II” rare-
earth elements deposit as well as for the period after the commencement of actions
related to suspension of the license, i.e. for the period from June 26, 2012 till
September 1, 2013.

Exhibit Ne 1 to this Report which is the principal exhibit contains a report on
determination of the market value of the right to use “Kutessay II” rare-earth
elements deposit.

As mentioned on pages 3 and 4 of Exhibit Ne 1 to the Report, the value of
the right to use “Kutessay II” rare-earth elements deposit was calculated using the
discounted cash flow technique with application of the model of cash flow
calculation for the aggregate invested capital. The main point in this approach is to
forecast cash flows which were to be received in the process of development of the
deposit in the course of mining and ore processing into float concentrate. In order
to determine the value of the right to use the deposit, the discounted cash flows
were summed up in accordance with the appraisal methodology. The forecast was
made on the basis of the analyzed available data about prices for this product in the
period from 2010 till 2013 and on the basis of the forecast prepared by the Nordest
Financial (Asian Metal) international information centre.

67

In the Exhibit Ne 3 the main information which was used, including financial
documents of the company, is provided.

The calculations were performed in national currency, soms. Conversion
into US Dollars was made at the exchange rate of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz
Republic as of the respective evaluation date.

The market value of the right to use “Kutessay II” deposit as of the date of
beginning of the creeping expropriation of “Kutessay II” (June 25, 2012) made up
5.087.042.000 (equivalent of 107.781.000 USD).

The value of direct costs incurred by “Kutisay Mining” LLC over the period
of holding the license for the development of “Kutessay II’ deposit (from January
1, 2010 till June 25, 2012) totaled to 353.933.000 som (equivalent of 7.499.000
USD), and for the period after commencement of actions related to suspension of
the license for the development of “Kutessay II” deposit (from June 26, 2012 till
September 1, 2013) 125.383.000 som (equivalent of 2.573.000 USD).

Thus, the total amount of investments made by the Investor totaled,
according to the Appraisal Report (with due regard to the difference in exchange
rates as of different evaluation dates in respect of different amounts and the
admissible round-up) to 117.853.000 USD.

The Claimants’ representative explained that the evaluation method used by
the expert in determining the market value of the right to use the “Kutessay II”
rare-earth elements deposit is the method of discounted cash flow. Para. 26 of the
Comments to Article 36 of the Draft Articles on Responsibility of States for
Internationally Wrongful Acts recognizes the discounted cash flow technique as an
admissible method of evaluation:

“Since 1945 there have been developed the methods of evaluation for a more
systematic accounting for different elements of risk and probability. The method of
discounted cash flow (DCF) is now rather widespread, especially in the context of
calculations related with revenues over a limited period of time... although this method
was developed as an instrument for evaluation of a commercial value, it can prove to be
useful also in the context of calculation of value for the purposes of compensation”*'

Answering the issue of the arbitrators concerning determination of the
evaluation date the expert noted the following.

When calculating the market value of the right to use “Kutessay II” deposit,
the evaluation date was June 25, 2012 — the date of commencement of actions
related to suspension of the license for the development of “Kutessay II” deposit.

The value of direct costs incurred by “Kutisay Mining” LLC over the period
of holding the license for the development of “Kutessay II” deposit was calculated
from January 1, 2010 till June 25, 2012 (the date of creeping expropriation) and
from June 26, 2012 till September 1, 2013 (the end of the last quarter preceding the
filing of the statement of claim prior to submission of the Report). This was made
for convenience of the Arbitral tribunal in case of the decision of the Arbitral
Tribunal not to take into account the costs after the commencement of
expropriation.

In answer to the question of arbitrators concerning the source of information
about the costs of “Kutisay Mining” for the development of “Kutessay II’ deposit
the expert said that the information material she used in the course of calculations
was in particular the feasibility study for the development of the deposit concerned
from which she took capital expenditures for the development and mining volumes
as well as the method of ore production.

Answering the question of the arbitrators, in which context the forecast for
the period 2016-2021 was used for calculation of the market value of the right to
use “Kutessay II” rare-earth elements deposit, the expert told as follows.

Discounted cash flow method used in the calculations is based on the
evaluation of future revenues for each of several time intervals. When assessing the
right to use “Kutessay II” rare-earth elements deposit by way of discounted cash
flow method, the estimated future time period of operations related to the deposit
development was divided into two periods: forecast and post-forecast period.
“Kutisay Mining” LLC expected that the volumes of yearly ore production and
processing would amount to 100000 tons in the first year of completion of
infrastructure construction with subsequent increase of up to 1 000 000 tons in
2012. “Kutisay Mining” LLC holds the license for the deposit development till
December 21, 2029, i.e. its remaining term is 16 years. Duration of the forecast
period was chosen as 10 years in order to build a sufficient number of cash flows
(in order to get a most true picture of development of the company and its
outlooks, which is not insignificant for formation of the value). The starting point
for implementation of the project was chosen the year 2013 (the year of drafting
the project documentation). In more details see pages 16 and 17 of Exhibit Ne | to
the Report.

In answer to the question of the arbitrators of whether the calculations
account not only for the revenues for the last 10 years but also for the revenues
which could have been received till the end of the license term, the expert
explained as follows. Notwithstanding the fact that the license term would be over
in 2029, the forecast period for calculations was ending with the year 2023. The

69

chosen forecast period is sufficient, more lengthy forecasts are not used in the
evaluation due to a low level of accuracy.

In respect of the applied standards the expert additionally explained that in
the Kyrgyz Republic exists the standard of basic concepts and principles which is
approved by the Resolution of the Government Ne 217. Five standards are
distinguished: the standard of business evaluation, the standard of real estate
evaluation, the standard of machinery evaluation, the standard of equipment
evaluation, the standard of requirements to drafting an appraisal report. The
mentioned standard of basic concepts contains in para.1 full interpretation of the
terminology and key factors which are mentioned in the Report. In particular, this
paragraph includes definitions of the terms “cash flow”, “discounted cash flow”,
“income approach”.

The expert gave the following additional explanations in respect of Exhibit
Ne 2 to the Report in which the market value of direct costs incurred by the
company was determined. In this case a specific contribution into the project
implementation was concerned. In the course of preparation of this exhibit the
expert used the submitted financial documents containing the information about
costs. The market value of direct costs was calculated for two periods: (1) prior to
the beginning of suspension of the license term; (2) after the beginning of
suspension of the license term. At first calculation under each period was made.
Thereafter the bottom line was derived, i.e. the market value of direct costs for the
whole period of evaluation.

In answer to the question of the arbitrators concerning the correctness of use
of the name of the company and the deposit the expert explained the following.
The difference in the name of the company and of the deposit arose in connection
with their different spelling and pronunciation in the Russian, Kyrgyz and English
languages. Under the Company “Kutisay Mining” LLC is meant. Under the
“Kutessay II” deposit the deposit is meant for which the license was issued to
“Kutisay Mining” LLC.

Answering the question of the arbitrators concerning inclusion of point 11
“Charity” into the investment losses the expert elucidated that according to the
submitted financial documents the charitable help was recorded on the books
separately and included the company’s costs for the site improvement of the
settlement, school repair, purchasing of textbooks. These costs were formally
considered as charity, but they were indispensible.

The Claimants’ representative Savchenko G.A. added that from the very
beginning the policy of the company included as its integral element the
establishment of normal relations with the local community. Charitable assistance
includes a comprehensive list of works, in particular, construction of water

70

conduits. Among all companies currently operating in the Kyrgyz Republic only
“Kumtor” and “Kutisay Mining” LLC have no conflicts with local population due
to such help.

Answering the question of the arbitrators in respect of legal substantiation of
the Claimants’ claim for recovery of the funds spent for charity the Claimants’
representative Zenlin I.V. explained the following.

Subsoil legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic provides for the so-called social
package for a foreign investor (investment of funds into the social and economic
development of a local community as a mandatory condition for any kind of
foreign investments). In this case the Kyrgyz legislation means charitable activity
which is an indispensible part of an investment package. If there is no charitable
activity there will be no investments, an investor will not be admitted.

In answer to the question of the arbitrators concerning a gratuitous character
which the charitable activity should have the Claimants’ representative Zenkin I.V.
stated as follows.

There is a charity which is a charity as such, but there is also some related
activity which is an essential activity for making investments. In this case the
related activity which is a mandatory activity is concerned, i.e. if there were no
investment project there would have been nobody who would carry out such
activity, since this investment project suggests, just as all investment projects,
basing on the Law on Subsoil of the Kyrgyz Republic the so-called contribution
into the social and economic development of the community. Therefore, it is not
quite the charity. If an investor is deprived of its investments, then the question
automatically arises as to why did it make that contribution at all?

In answer to the question in respect of any benefits for the company from
charitable help to the local population, for instance, in the form of reduction of a
tax burden, the Claimants’ representatives Savchenko G.A. and Zenkin I.V.
explained that there was no such reduction. The benefits for the company consist in
establishment of normal relations with the local population.

Answering the question of the arbitrators concerning the calculation of direct
costs incurred by “Kutisay Mining” LLC the expert additionally explained that
Exhibit Ne 2 to the Report contains a summary table which includes itemized
accounts and costs. The result of produced calculations was that the value of direct
costs incurred by “Kutisay Mining” LLC over the period of holding the license for
the development of “Kutessay II” deposit (from January 1, 2010 till June 25, 2012)
totaled to 353.933.000 som (equivalent of 7.499.000 USD), and for the period after
commencement of actions related to suspension of the license for the development
of “Kutessay II” deposit (from June 26, 2012 till September 1, 2013) — to
125.383.000 som (equivalent of 2.573.000 USD).

71

Answering the question of the arbitrators in respect of evaluation of
buildings and structures the expert told as follows.

All real estate objects of “Kutisay Mining” LLC are located in the area of
“Kutessay II” rare-earth elements deposit and were inspected in an unbiased
manner by a group of specialists, including the expert personally. During the on-
site visit the structural scheme of all buildings and constructions was inspected in
particular.

For assessment of the value of the real estate property the cost method was
used. The cost method is the approach to evaluation of the property under which
the value of property is formed out of the costs for the acquisition and/or
reconstruction of all constituent parts of the property (adjusted for wear and tear).
In the present case the standards of evaluation of non-residential property were
used. For calculation of the market value the cost of reconstruction or replacement
value, as is it called, is evaluated at first.

The replacement value of buildings and structures is the current value of the
costs determined as of the evaluation date for building a new object similar to the
evaluated one, which may become its equivalent substitute. When determining the
replacement value of buildings/structures the method of a unit indicator of a
construction analogue is used.

In accordance with the standards of evaluation the aggregate wear and tear
shall be defined as decrease in the reconstruction or replacement value of buildings
and structures which may take place as a result of physical, functional and
economic (external) wear and tear. Physical wear and tear is determined basing on
the “Scale of expert evaluations for determination of physical wear and tear of the
evaluated object”. External wear and tear depends on a region of the Kyrgyz
Republic and is calculated on the basis of the market value decrease factor which is
used in taxation. In more detail the answer to this question is given in particular on
pages 6-7, 15-16 of Exhibit Ne 2 to the Report.

Answering the question of the arbitrators about the procedure of making
calculations during appraisal of buildings and structures and their value, the expert
explained as follows.

At first, the cost of a new construction will be calculated and after that
depreciation is deducted. Depreciation is expressed by facts of physical, functional
and external wear and tear.

In answer to the question of the arbitrators about the market value of the
buildings and structures the expert said that this is the book-keeping account 2130,
and that the total value of these objects in their present condition made up 78.119
USD.

72

Answering the question of the arbitrators as to why the value of these
buildings should be compensated to the company “Kutisay Mining” LLC the
Claimants’ representative I.V. Zenkin explained the following.

Without the license these objects as such are needless. This property had the
designated use. These objects are a part of the production process which no longer
exists in connection with de facto expropriation of the license. All this is a part of
the closed production process. In other words, all this is useless if the main thing is
missing — the right to develop the deposit. At present the company has found itself
to be the owner of the useless property which had the designated use.

In answer to the question of the arbitrators concerning production costs the
expert explained that production costs are the book-keeping account 7000. On page
19 of Exhibit Ne 2 to the Report there is a breakdown of production expenditures.
These expenditures include labour costs, social fund contributions, expenditures
for fixed assets repair and maintenance, as well as other operating expenditures.

In answer to the question of the arbitrators as to what is included into the
costs under the item “other long-term liabilities” the expert explained that they
include the costs of acquisition of the rare-earth elements plant (a copy of the
contract of sale is enclosed in the Exhibit Ne 3 to the Report).

Answering the question of the arbitrators of whether the company “Kutisay
Mining” LLC had undertaken measures for sale of the plant to third parties the
Claimants’ representative Zenkin I.V. told that the plant is located in the area of
the deposit, it represents a single production technological cycle of ore processing
at the deposit and was purchased specifically for the purpose of processing of ore
mined at the deposit.

When answering this question the Claimants’ representative Zenkin I.V.
noted that a similar question was a subject-mater of examination under the
investment dispute in the case Técnicas Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. (Spain) v.
The United Mexican States”, handled by ICSID

In the award in that case the arbitral panel “arrived at a conclusion that the
actions of the state resulted in the refusal to extend the license and in the shutdown
of the landfill (i.e. they led to impossibility of further landfill use for storage of
hazardous waste). The company Cytrar was barred from continuation of its
commercial activity, and the investor was deprived of the opportunity to gain
income which it expected to get from the use of the landfill. Since in that case the
landfill was concerned where hazardous industrial waste was stored during 10
years, it could not be used for any other purposes and as a consequence the

2003 (ICSID case No. ARB(AF)/00/2).

facilities located on that landfill could not be sold on the real estate market.
Extracts from that award together with the translation into Russian were enclosed
by the Claimants to the Statement of Claim.

In answer to the question of the arbitrators as to why the company after the
initiation of actions for suspension of the license (June 25, 2012) was incurring the
costs, the expert explained that the company paid in particular for the earlier
contracted works for elaboration of the concept of development of the rare-earth
metals of “Kutessay-II” deposit. In more detail the information on the incurred
costs is given on pages 18-19 of Exhibit Ne 2 to the Report.

Answering the question of the arbitrators as to whether the “Al-Star “Centre
for Property Appraisal and Expert Examination” LLC has the practical experience
of assessment of a market value of the right to use deposits, the expert pointed out
that only in the recent time the “Al-Star “Centre for Property Appraisal and Expert
Examination” LLC had carried out the works in respect of evaluation of four
quartzite deposits which were used as the mineral resources base for the operating
enterprise (cement plant). These works were accepted by international auditors,
with no comments made.

The expert explained that for the protection of domestic market the standard
of requirements governing the submission of the appraisal report was worked out
which sets forth that a report drafted by a non-resident of the Kyrgyz Republic is
not legitimate in the territory of the Republic. Therefore, the report of the “Big
Four” should be re-attested or should be prepared with participation of an appraiser
of the Kyrgyz Republic. The “Al-Star “Centre for Property Appraisal and Expert
Examination” LLC is included into the register of reliable partners of the Chamber
of Commerce and Industry of the Kyrgyz Republic as well as it is a supervisor of
the European Bank under all contracts which are subject to financial monitoring.

Reasoning of the Arbitral Tribunal

1. On the possibility to hear the case in the hearings on March 31 and
April 29-30, 2014 in the absence of the Respondent’s representatives

On the possibility to hear the case in the hearing on March 31 in the
absence of the Respondent’s representatives

Having examined the issue of possibility to hear the case in the hearing on
March 31, 2014 in the absence of the Respondent’s representatives, the Arbitral
tribunal found the following.

The notification of the Statement of Claim filed on October 30, 2013 with
the MCCI Arbitration and the Statement of Claim with exhibits was sent on the
same day to the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Kyrgyz
Republic in the Russian Federation B. Djunusov, to the President of the Kyrgyz
Republic Atambaev A.Sh (the notification was sent by DHL, number of
consignment note 7395219090 and was received on November 04, 2013);

On October 31, 2013 the Statement of Claim was sent to the Prime-Minister
of the Kyrgyz Republic Satybaldiev Zh.Zh. (the notification was sent by DHL,
number of consignment note 7395219101 and was received on November 01,
2013); to the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic Abdylbaev E.B.
(the notification was sent by DHL, number of consignment note 7395219112 and
was received on November 04, 2013); to the Director of the State Agency for
Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
Zilaliev D.T. (the notification was sent by DHL, number of consignment note
7395219123 and was received on November 04, 2013).

On November 12, 2013 the Arbitration at the MCCI received per e-mail
from the Embassy of the Kyrgyz Republic the Respondent’s Motion dated
November 12, 2013, signed by the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary
of the Kyrgyz Republic in the Russian Federation Djunusov B. with a request to
extend the time limit for consideration of the received materials in the case, as well
as to extend the deadline for nomination of an arbitrator.

On November 12, 2013 the Executive Secretary of the MCCI Arbitration
sent the answer to this Motion addressed to the Ambassador Extraordinary and
Plenipotentiary of the Kyrgyz Republic in the Russian Federation Mr. B. Djunusov
(ref. Ne 244). The Respondent was offered to submit to the MCCI Arbitration by
November 20, 2013 at the latest the information about nominated arbitrators on the
part of the Respondent (the notification was sent by DHL, number of consignment
note 7395219042 and was received on November 14, 2013).

75

Due to setting the date of the hearing for December 13, 2013 the Claimants
filed the application dated December 03, 2013 requesting to postpone the
examination of the case till the beginning of February 2014.

The above mentioned application was sent to the above mentioned addresses
together with notification that the issue of postponement of the case examination
shall be resolved in the case hearing. This notification was duly received, which is
confirmed by DHL receipts on file.

On December 13, 2013 the Arbitral tribunal passed a Ruling which granted
the motion of the Claimants for postponement of dispute resolution till February
06, 2014. This Ruling was sent to the above mentioned addresses and was duly
received, which is confirmed by DHL receipts on file.

On February 05, 2014 the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic submitted to the MCCI Arbitration
the Declaration on the lack of jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to examine the
present case and the Motion for postponement of the arbitration proceedings.

On February 06, 2014 the Arbitral tribunal passed Procedural Order Ne 1 and
the Ruling with which it granted the Motion of the Respondent for postponement
of the case hearing and its request to conduct a separate arbitration hearing on
jurisdiction. The Respondent was offered to produce the reasoning of its legal
position on jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration.

The hearing in the case on jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to handle
the dispute was set for March 03, 2014, and the hearing on the merits was
scheduled for March 31, 2014. This Procedural Order was sent to the Respondent
at all of the above mentioned addresses and was duly received by it.

On February 28, 2014 the MCCI Arbitration received from the Embassy of
the Kyrgyz Republic in the RF the Motion of the State Agency for Geology and
Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for
postponement of the proceedings due to the reason that the Kyrgyz Republic
physically had not enough time to make any decision on arising procedural issues.
The motion contained a request for postponement of the case hearing till the
decision of the Economic Court of the CIS to which the Kyrgyz Republic applied
on interpretation of Article 11 of the Moscow Convention and till the decisions of
the Moscow City Arbitration Court on the application of the Kyrgyz Republic for
cancellation of the earlier passed decisions.

In the hearing on March 03, 2014 this Motion was examined and the Ruling
was passed to dismiss the Respondent’s Motion for postponement of the
proceedings in the case till the end of the consultation process and/or rendering of
the decision by the Economic Court of the CIS on interpretation of Article 11 of
the Moscow Convention and till resolution in the Moscow City Arbitration Court

76

of the cases in respect of revocation of the earlier passed awards of the MCCI
Arbitration.

On March 20, 2014 the MCCI Arbitration received from the State Agency
for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic
the Motion for postponement of the arbitration proceedings taking into account the
breakdown of coalition of the majority in the Parliament (Zhogorku Kenesh) of the
Kyrgyz Republic. It was stated therein that the time limits of dispute examination
in the MCCI Arbitration do not allow choosing a law company for protection of its
rights, since they don’t take into account long internal terms of approval and
adoption of decisions related to selection of a law company by the government
bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic.

Having examined the submitted Motion, the Arbitral Tribunal passed on
March 25, 2014 the Ruling to dismiss the Respondent’s Motion for postponement
of the proceedings in the case for a later date and to continue the arbitration
proceedings. The hearing on jurisdiction was scheduled for March 31, 2014.

At the hearing on March 31, 2014 the Arbitral tribunal analyzed the
possibility to hear the issue on jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration in the absence
of the Respondent’s representatives.

Being guided by provisions of Articles 25 and 18 of the Law of the RF “On
International Commercial Arbitration” and para.1 Article 46 of the Arbitration
Rules of the MCCI, the Arbitral tribunal considered it possible to examine the
issue of jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration over the dispute in the hearing on
March 31, 2014 in the absence of the Respondent’s representatives.

In its Ruling the Arbitral tribunal declared that the Statement of Claim was
filed with the MCCI Arbitration in October 2013 and that, according to the Kyrgyz
party, the work related to selection of a law firm for representation of the interests
of the Kyrgyz Republic in the present proceedings was completed on January 30,
2014. Further the Ruling set forth that the Arbitral tribunal, proceeding from the
necessity of a fair dispute resolution and the necessity to grant to each party every
opportunity to state its case, had repeatedly satisfied the motions of the Kyrgyz
Republic and postponed the hearing in the case. Taking into account the subjects of
the dispute, one of which is the Kyrgyz Republic, which state sovereignty is
greatly respected by the Arbitral tribunal and which has deep understanding for the
issues covered in the Motion filed on March 20, 2014, and that the other party to
the dispute is in particular a foreign investor which referred to the MCCI
Arbitration for protection of its rights, and taking into account that the principle of
the equality of the parties is anchored in Article 24 of the Arbitration Rules of the
MCCI, the Arbitral Tribunal rendered the Ruling on dismissal of the Respondent’s

77

Motion for postponement of the case hearing for a later date and on continuation of
the arbitration proceedings.

On the possibility to hear the case in the hearing on May 29-30, 2014 in
the absence of the Respondent’s representatives

On April 26, 2014 the MCCI Arbitration received from the Centre of judicial
representation of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic the Motion dated April
25, 2014 for postponement of dispute resolution till examination by the Moscow
City Arbitration Court of the application in respect of the jurisdiction of the
arbitration court. The original Motion was delivered to the MCCI Arbitration on
April 28, 2014.

On April 28, 2014 the mentioned Motion was sent per e-mail to the
Claimants’ representatives and was received by them on the same date.

Since this Motion of the Respondent was dated April 25, 2014, it was sent to
the MCCI Arbitration on April 26, 2014 (in electronic form) and on April 28, 2014
(in paper form), it was therefore considered by the Arbitral tribunal in the hearing
on April 29, 2014.

As far as the issues covered by that Motion are concerned, the Claimants’
representative told the following. The Ruling of the MCCI Arbitration dated March
31, 2014 in the matter Ne A-2013/09 is not “a ruling of the arbitral tribunal on a
preliminary issue”. As provided for by paragraph 3 Article 16 of the Law of the RF
“On International Commercial Arbitration”, if the arbitral tribunal rules on the
issue of jurisdiction as a preliminary issue that it has jurisdiction, any party may
within 30 days upon receipt of the notice of such ruling request the arbitration
court to pass a decision on this issue. In this case no such ruling was passed; on the
contrary, the Ruling of March 31, 2014 stated that the issue of jurisdiction will be
dealt with in the decision on the merits of the dispute. This Ruling is not the ruling
on a preliminary issue in which respect in accordance with para. 3 Article 16 of the
RF Law “On International Commercial Arbitration”, “either party may request a
decision of the arbitration court on this issue”. “Pending the decision under the
request of the party, the arbitral tribunal may continue the proceedings and render
an award.” Therefore, the Claimants’ representatives insisted on examination of
the dispute on the merits.

The Claimants hold that the Respondent’s application to the Moscow City
Arbitration Court does not comply either with the provisions of Article 235 of the
Arbitral Procedural Code of the RF governing revocation of a preliminary ruling of
the arbitral tribunal on jurisdiction. There was no such ruling passed in the present

78

case. Therefore, the Claimants’ representatives believed that the Respondent’s
Motion should not be granted.

The Arbitral tribunal has considered the Respondent’s Motion dated April
25, 2014 for postponement of dispute resolution till examination by the Moscow
City Arbitration Court of the declaration on the lack of jurisdiction of the Arbitral
tribunal, has heard the explanations of the Claimants’ representatives and found the
following. At the hearing on March 31, 2014 the issue of jurisdiction of the MCCI
Arbitration over the present dispute was examined. In para. 1 the Ruling
recognizes the jurisdiction of the MCCI to settle the present dispute. The Ruling
sets forth that the reasons related to the jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration will
be laid down in the decision on the merits of the case. The arbitrators were guided
by para.l Article 16 of the Law of the RF “On International Commercial
Arbitration” according to which the arbitral tribunal may independently pass a
ruling on its jurisdiction, as well as by para.3 Article 3 of the MCCI Arbitration
Rules according to which the arbitral tribunal independently decides on its
jurisdiction over the dispute submitted for its examination, including where one of
the parties objects to arbitration proceedings due to the lack or invalidity of an
arbitration agreement.

Therefore, recourse of the Respondent to the Moscow City Arbitration Court
does not prevent the MCCI Arbitration from resolution of the dispute on the
merits. Moreover even if the ruling on the preliminary issue was rendered in the
present situation (which is not the case), according to para.3 Article 16 of the RF
Law “On International Commercial Arbitration”, pending the decision under the
party’s request, the arbitral tribunal may continue the proceedings and pass an
award. Thus, the Respondent’s motion for postponement of the dispute resolution
till examination by the Moscow City Arbitration Court of the declaration on the
lack of jurisdiction of the arbitration court should not be satisfied and the
arbitration proceedings can be conducted on the merits.

Analyzing the arguments of the Respondent concerning the choice of a law
firm for protection of its interests, the Arbitral tribunal holds that the Statement of
Claim which contains the entire claims of the Claimants with their legal and
economic substantiation was sent to the Respondent on October 30, 2013 and that
the Respondent had almost five months to prepare its Statement of Defence. The
extended Statement of Claim was sent to the Respondent on February 03, 2014. In
this statement additional evidence in support of the arguments adduced in the
Statement of Claim was produced, legal grounds and economic evaluation of the

79

raised claims were not changed. At the request of the Respondent examination of
the case was repeatedly postponed. The Arbitral tribunal stated that the Centre of
judicial representation was functioning under the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic which was set up by Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic dated February 12, 2014 Ne 89. The Centre is a single body which
coordinates the issues of protection of interests of the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic as well as of the Kyrgyz Republic in international and local judicial
bodies. The Centre is authorized to represent the interests of the Government of the
Kyrgyz Republic and of the Kyrgyz Republic in international and local judicial
bodies. Thus, beginning from February 12, 2014 the protection of interests of the
Kyrgyz Republic could be carried out by the mentioned Centre and did not depend
solely on the choice of the law firm.

Basing on the foregoing and being guided by para.1 Article 46 of the MCCI
Arbitration Rules, the Arbitral tribunal considered it possible to examine the case
on the merits in the hearings on April 29-30, 2014 in the absence of the
Respondent’s representatives.

2. The law applicable to establishment of the jurisdiction of the MCCI
arbitration to settle this dispute — Lex arbitrii

In view of the specificity of disputed relations which arose between the
parties to the present dispute and taking into account that the findings on the
jurisdiction of the Arbitration at the Moscow CCI should be made on the basis of
the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997 (the
Moscow Convention) and the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic dated March 27, 2003
the Arbitral tribunal considers it necessary to examine the issue of the law
applicable to the disputed relations. This is especially important in the context of
recourse of the Kyrgyz Republic to consultations between the states-parties to the
Moscow Convention and filing of the application for interpretation of the Moscow
Convention with the Economic Court of the CIS, as stated in the Respondent’s
Motion received by the Arbitration on February 28, 2014.

The Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights has been ratified by
the Kyrgyz Republic without any reservations or declarations which means that the
sovereign will of the Kyrgyz Republic was to recognize this Convention as binding
for it to the full extent. The Kyrgyz Republic has assumed the obligation to
implement this Convention in the whole territory falling under its jurisdiction.

80

The dispute between the parties arose between the Claimants - the company
“Stans Energy Corp.”, which commercial enterprise is located in Canada, and the
subsidiary “Kutisay Mining” LLC set up by the above mentioned company, which
commercial enterprise is located in the Kyrgyz Republic, - and the Respondent -
the Kyrgyz Republic.

When qualifying the Claimants as investors the Arbitral tribunal was guided
by the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated
March 28, 1997 and the norms of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” dated March 27, 2003 as subsequently
amended and supplemented.

Definition of Investor under the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997

According to definitions contained in Article 1 of the Convention for the
Protection of Investor’s Rights, investor is, at first, a state, legal or natural person
investing its own, borrowed or raised funds in the form of investments. Second,
investments are financial and tangible assets invested by investor into different
objects of activity as well as the rights to material and intellectual property with a
view to gain profit (income) or achieving a social effect, unless they are not
withdrawn from the circulation or unless their circulation is not limited in
accordance with the national legislation of the Parties. As defined in Article 3 of
the same Convention, as investors may act states, legal and natural person of both
the Parties and third countries, unless otherwise provided for by the national
legislation of the Parties.

As stipulated in Article 2 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights, the rules defined in the Convention shall apply in the case if the subjects of
legal relations of two and more states participate in the investment process.

Thus, the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights is intended to
regulate the relations in which the investors from two or more states participate,
irrespective of whether they are persons of the member states to the Convention or
the persons of third countries.

Definition of Investor according to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”

According to Article 1 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic, investor is a
subject of investment activity investing its own, borrowed or raised funds in the

form of investments.

81

Domestic investor means a legal entity or natural person of the Kyrgyz
Republic, a foreign citizen and person without citizenship having the status of a
resident in the Kyrgyz Republic and engaged in investment activity in the territory
of the Kyrgyz Republic.

A foreign investor means any natural person or legal entity which is not a
domestic investor investing into the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic, including: a
legal entity set up and registered in accordance with the legislation of a foreign
state or set up with foreign participation, i.e. incorporated under the legislation of
the Kyrgyz Republic, entirely owned by one or more foreign natural, legal persons.

Claimants in the present case as foreign investors

The Claimants in the present case are the company “Stans Energy Corp.”
which is a legal entity under the legislation of Canada as well as the Limited
Liability Company “Kutisay Mining” LLC which is a limited liability company
under the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic set up by a subsidiary of the first
Claimant — “Stans Energy KG” LLC. Since “Kutisay Mining” LLC is established
by the company “Stans Energy Corp.” through “Stans Energy KG” LLC and is
fully owned by the company “Stans Energy Corp.”, therefore due to Article 1 of
the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”,
“Kutisay Mining” LLC is recognized as a foreign investor. In confirmation of
ownership of “Kutisay Mining” LLC in the hearing dated April 29, 2014 the
documents were submitted at the request of the Arbitral tribunal, in particular tax
accounts of the company “Stans Energy Corp.” publicly available in Internet, and
this fact was attested by G.A. Savchenko who is the head of both the subsidiary
and the granddaughter company.

According to Article 3 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights, as investors may act states, legal and natural person of both the Parties to
the Convention and third countries, unless otherwise provided for by the national
legislation of the Parties. Since according to the national legislation of the Kyrgyz
Republic (Article 1 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic”) the company “Stans Energy Corp.” and the Limited Liability
Company “Kutisay Mining” LLC are foreign investors, therefore the law
applicable to determination of the jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration over the
present dispute will be the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights and
the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”.

82

The Claimants have applied to the MCCI Arbitration which, according to
Article 1 of the Regulations approved by the Order of the President of the Moscow
CCI dated July 20, 2012 Ne 20, is a permanent arbitration institution (court of
referees) operating in accordance with the Federal Law “On Arbitration Courts in
the Russian Federation“ and the Law of the Russian Federation “On International
Commercial Arbitration”.

In this case the Law of the Russian Federation “On International
Commercial Arbitration” dated July 1993 will be lex arbitrii.

3. The law applicable to resolution of the issues related to the merits of
the case

Since the dispute which arose between the parties is the dispute about
foreign investments, basic regulatory acts for its resolution are international
conventions and national legislation. Applicable in the present case are the
Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997 ratified
by the Kyrgyz Republic, and the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in
the Kyrgyz Republic” dated March 27, 2003 Ne 66 as subsequently amended and
supplemented.

4. On the jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to settle the present
dispute

In respect of the jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to resolve the dispute
which arose between the Parties the Arbitral tribunal has concluded as follows.
According to Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights dated March 28, 1997, relations connected with making investments and the
related activity of investors are governed by:
- the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March
28, 1997,
- the national legislation of the states-participants to the Convention
for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997,
- international treaties parties to which are signatories to the
Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28,
1997.
According to Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights disputes related to investment making under the present Convention shall be
settled by the courts or arbitration courts of the countries — participants to the

83

disputes, by the Economic Court of the Commonwealth of Independent States
and/or other international courts or international arbitration courts.

A similar procedure is provided for by the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”. According to Article 1 of the Law, an
investment dispute shall be settled according to any applicable procedure agreed in
advance between an investor and the state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic which
does not exclude the use by the investor of other remedies in accordance with
the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic. It follows from this provision that the
investor has the right to use other remedies provided for by the legislation of the
Kyrgyz Republic.

Para.2 Article 18 of this Law provides for the right of a party to the dispute
to have recourse to arbitration or international ad hoc arbitration constituted
under the Rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law (literal text of
para.2 Article 18: unless in the dispute between a foreign investor and a state body
either party requests to examine the dispute in accordance with one of the
following procedures by way of application to: ...b) arbitration or international
ad hoc arbitration (commercial court) set up in accordance with the arbitration
rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law).

Le. according to Article 18 of the Law “On Investments in the Kyrgyz
Republic” a party to the dispute may apply to arbitration or to the above mentioned
international ad hoc arbitration.

When interpreting Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights and Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” the Arbitral tribunal took into account the
Linguistic Opinion of the experts Ivanov L.Yu. and Arkhipova M.N. dated March
06, 2014 and the Expert Opinion of the Doctor of Law, Professor K.M. Ilyasova
dated March 12, 2014, which were submitted by the Claimants.

In the Linguistic Opinion the experts distinguish between the terms
“arbitration” and “international ad hoc arbitration (commercial court)” constituted
under the arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law and they arrive at the conclusion that the term “arbitration” used in
para.2 Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the
Kyrgyz Republic” means any international arbitration with exception of
international ad hoc arbitration set up in accordance with the arbitration rules of the
UN Commission on International Trade Law.

84

In respect of interpretation of Article 18 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic
“On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” in the Expert Opinion the conclusion is
made that this article provides for the right of an investor to apply, along with the
International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID) and
international ad hoc arbitration (commercial court) set up in accordance with the
arbitration rules of the UN Commission on International Trade Law, to any
international arbitration.

Concerning interpretation of Article 11 of the Convention for the Protection
of Investor’s Rights the Expert Opinion sets forth that the provisions of this
Convention are formulated mandatory and do not require further specification
through other international agreements or the agreement of the parties to a dispute.
Should the arbitration body not named in this article be specified under the
mentioned article, there would be a phrase “agreed by the parties to the dispute”,
“by agreement of the parties”, etc.

Thus, the international treaty to which the Kyrgyz Republic is a participant —
the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights — and the national legislation
— the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” —
provide for the possibility of recourse of an investor to international arbitration
leaving at its discretion the choice of such arbitration. Therefore, the application of
the Claimants to the Arbitration at the Moscow CCl is legitimate.

According to Article 1 of the Regulations approved by the Order of the
President of the Moscow CCI dated July 20, 2012 Ne 20, the MCCI Arbitration is a
permanent arbitration institution (court of referees) operating in accordance with
the Federal Law “On Arbitration Courts in the Russian Federation“ and the Law of
the Russian Federation “On International Commercial Arbitration”. The
Arbitration is a legal successor of the Arbitration Court at the Moscow Chamber of
Commerce and Industry established in 1993 and renamed from March 1, 1995 into
the Commercial Arbitration at the Moscow Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

According to Article 1 of the Regulations of the MCCI Arbitration the
MCCI arbitration is a permanent arbitration institution (court of referees) set up by
the Moscow CCI for settlement of disputes out of contractual and other civil law
relations in accordance with its competence.

The competence of the MCCI Arbitration is determined in para. 1.3 Article 3
of the Rules, according to which disputes in the sphere of investment activity can
be referred to the MCCI Arbitration.

The Arbitral tribunal was constituted in accordance with the Rules, in
accordance with Article 16 of the Rules all arbitrators submitted their declarations

85

of consent, impartiality and independence. The parties made no comments in
respect of formation of the Arbitral tribunal and the candidacies of arbitrators.

With this in view and being guided by Article 2 of the Regulations on the
MCCI Arbitration, the Arbitral tribunal concludes that the MCCI Arbitration has
jurisdiction to examine the present dispute.

5. Claimants’ claim for compensation of the investment value

Having examined the Claimants’ claim for compensation of the value of
investments, the Arbitral tribunal found the following:

The Claimants have made investments into the economy of the Republic of
Kyrgyzstan.

Investments are defined in Article 1 of the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997:

Investments are financial and tangible assets invested by investor into
different objects of activity as well as the transferred rights to material and
intellectual property with a view of gaining profit (income) or achieving a social
effect, unless they are not withdrawn from the circulation or unless their circulation
is not limited in accordance with the national legislation of the Parties.

According to Article 7 of the mentioned Convention, relations connected
with making investments and the related activity of investors are governed also by
the national legislation of the member states of the Convention.

According to para. 1 Article 1 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On
Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”:

“Investments mean tangible and intangible contributions of all kinds of
assets owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by investor into the objects of
economic activity with a view of gaining profit and (or) achieving any other useful
effect in the form of:

- money;
- movable and immovable property;
- property rights (mortgages, liens, pledges and others);
- stock and other forms of participation in a legal entity;
- bonds and other debenture liabilities;
- non-property rights (inter alia, the right to intellectual property including
goodwill, copyrights, patents, trade marks, industrial designs, technological
processes, trade names and know-how);
- any right to activity based on a license or otherwise permitted by state bodies of
the Kyrgyz Republic;
86

- concessions based on the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic, including
concessions for prospecting, development, mining or exploitation of natural
resources of the Kyrgyz Republic;

- profit and revenue received from investments and re-invested in the territory of
the Kyrgyz Republic;

- other forms of investments that are not prohibited by the legislation of the Kyrgyz
Republic.

A form in which property is invested, or any change in this form shall not
influence its nature as investments.”

In the present case the Canadian company “Stans Energy Corp.” invested
funds into:

1) the shares of JSC “Kutisay Mining” set up in the territory of the Kyrgyz
Republic. This open joint-stock company was reorganized into the limited liability
company — “Kutisay Mining” LLC. Acquisition of shares of this company meant
acquisition of the company itself and at the same time acquisition of the license for
mining of the rare-earth metals issued to this company.

The monetary funds were per se transformed into the license — the only asset
of “Kutisay Mining” LLC after its acquisition and reorganization.

The world law enforcement practice qualifies licenses as investments which
is evidenced by the ICSID cases Tecmed v Mexico™ and Middle East Cement v
Egypt’.

2) into the property. General Director of “Kutisay Mining” LLC Savchenko
G.A. confirmed that except for the license the acquired company had no other
assets.

3) into the activity of the company (salaries, etc.).

Thus, there were investments in monetary form as well as investments which
changed their form and were transformed into the assets in a tangible form or in a
form of the license, which does not change their legal characteristics as
investments.

Expropriation

Having examined the materials submitted by the Claimants and having heard
the explanations of the Claimants’ representatives, the Arbitral tribunal held as
follows.

Definition of expropriation

As provided for in Article 7 of the Convention for the Protection of
Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997, the relations in connection with making
investments and the related activity of investors are governed by this Convention,
the national legislation of the Parties and international treaties to which they are the
parties.

International law definition of the term “expropriation” is found in Article
11(a) of the 1985 Seoul Convention Establishing the Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency:

“ii) Expropriation and similar measures

any legislative action or administrative action or omission attributable to the
host government which has the effect of depriving the holder of a guarantee of his
ownership or control of, or a substantial benefit from, his investment... .”

Thus, expropriation means the measures which:

1) come from the host state;

2) deprive the Investor of the ownership of its investment, control over it or a
substantial benefit therefrom.

According to Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments
in the Kyrgyz Republic”, expropriation means nationalization, requisition or other
equivalent measures, including action or omission on the part of the competent
state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic which resulted in compulsory seizure of the
investor’s funds or its deprivation of the possibility to use the results of
investments.

Actions of the Kyrgyz Republic

On June 26, 2012 the Committee for Development of Economic Industries
of the Parliament of the Kyrgyz Republic (Zhogorku Kenesh) passed a resolution
obligating the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic to cancel the license agreement Ne 3 dated
June 15, 2012 with “Kutisay Mining” LLC in respect of “Kutessay II” deposit.

88

Thereafter, the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic ceased to perform its obligations towards
“Kutisay Mining” LLC and in such a way paved the way for termination of
operations of “Kutisay Mining” LLC in respect of mining of “Kutessay IT” deposit.

This resulted into the following acts of the State Agency for Geology and
Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the General
Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic.

(1) Refusal to consider the programs of works at the deposit

(the letter dated March 12, 2013 of the State Agency for Geology and
Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic addressed to
“Kutisay Mining” LLC);

(2) Refusal to conduct state ecological expert examination

(the letter dated March 12, 2013 of the State Agency for Geology and
Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic addressed to
“Kutisay Mining” LLC);

(3) Refusal to re-execute the license agreement

(the letter dated April 8, 2013 of the State Agency for Geology and Mineral
Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic addressed to “Kutisay
Mining” LLC);

(4) Judicial recourse

On April 04, 2013 the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic
filed an application with the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic for invalidation of the Minutes of
direct negotiations between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources
under the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company
“Kutisay Mining” dated December 21, 2009 Ne1736-N-09.

The Kyrgyz Republic declared that it was necessary to check to what extent
the regulatory legal act on which basis it granted the right to JSC “Kutisay Mining”
to obtain the license (Resolution Ne 725) before putting up its shares for sale at the
auction complied with the Kyrgyz legislation at the moment of its adoption.*°

5) Interim measures

On the basis of the application of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the
Kyrgyz Republic for injunctive measures aimed at securing the claim the judge of

3° On March 19, 2014 the Inter-district court of Bishkek (judge Nurmanbetov E.B.) satisfied the application
of the General Prosecutor’s Office of the Kyrgyz Republic and declared invalid the Minutes Ne1736-N-09 of direct
negotiations between the State Agency for Geology and Mineral Resources under the Government of the Kyrgyz
Republic and the Open Joint-Stock Company “Kutisay Mining” dated December 21, 2009.

“Kutisay Mining” LLC disagreed with the decision of the Inter-district court of the city of Bishkek of
March 19, 2014 and filed an appeal against it which is currently pending in the court.

89

the Inter-district court of the city of Bishkek Nurmanbetov E.B. ruled on April 15,
2013 that the following injunctive measures can be applied in respect of “Kutisay
Mining” LLC: “To bar “Kutisay Mining” LLC, private persons, state bodies and
their officials from making actions related to re-execution of the license agreement
as the supplement; extension thereof, issue of the next license supplement;
approval of projects, reports, work programs, feasibility studies; calculating the
payment for withholding the Licenses Ne 2488 ME and Ne 2489ME for the right to
use subsoil at the deposit “Kutessay II’, as well as the actions aimed at transfer or
alienation of the right of subsoil use at the deposit “Kutessay II” to third parties,
including alienation of a share in the charter capital of the company”.

The petition of “Kutisay Mining” LLC and Ak-Tyuz ajyil okmotu (rural
administration) to repeal the interim measures for securing the claim was
completely dismissed by Decision of the Inter-district court of the city of Bishkek
of May 29, 2013.

Legal qualification of the actions of the Kyrgyz Republic

As provided for in Article 8 of the Convention for Protection of Investor’s
Rights, investments in the territory of the Parties shall enjoy “unconditional legal
protection” which shall be secured by the present Convention, national legislation
of the parties and international treaties to which they are the participants. In Article
9 of the Convention the guarantees of protection of investments against
nationalization, requisition, decisions and actions (omission) of the state bodies
and officials infringing upon the rights of investors are fixed.

According to Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments
in the Kyrgyz Republic”, investments shall not be subject to expropriation -
nationalization, requisition or other equivalent measures, including action or
omission on the part of the competent state bodies of the Kyrgyz Republic which
resulted in compulsory seizure of the investor’s funds or its deprivation of the
possibility to use the results of investments.

Having analyzed the above mentioned acts and taking into account the
practice of international investment arbitration, the Arbitral tribunal has found that
prohibition to re-execute the license agreement as supplement, prohibition to
extend it, to issue the next license agreement means a prohibition to carry out
subsoil use operations which can not be carried out without these documents. In
other words, the mentioned actions mean an actual deprivation of the Claimants of
the right to carry out subsoil use activity, the Investor’s loss of control over its
investments and the loss of future revenues from its investments.

90

Thus, there is a violation of the guarantees of protection against
expropriation granted by the national legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic (Article 6
of the Law “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”).

This conclusion is confirmed by the investment arbitration practice
according to which the decisions of state bodies by which the licenses are directly
or indirectly withdrawn and the permits are cancelled which are necessary for a
foreign investor to do business in the territory of the state shall be considered as
expropriation.

The Arbitral tribunal considers reasonable to look at the case Técnicas
Medioambientales Tecmed S.A. (Spain) v. The United Mexican States*”, in which
it was found that a refusal to extend the license constituted an act of expropriation.
The arbitrators in that case noted that not only compulsory seizure by a state of
movable or immovable property of the investor but also the actions or conduct not
directly purporting the deprivation of the investor of its property or rights but
having exactly such consequences in practice should be recognized as
expropriation. In order to determine, whether the refusal to extend the license was
a measure equivalent to expropriation, it is necessary to answer first of all the
question of whether the claimant was substantially deprived, as a result of such
decision, of the possibility to use its investments, since the rights related to its
investments, such as the right to derive revenue from the landfill operation, ceased
to exist. In other words, whether the respective property had lost its value for the
investor as a result of actions of the state, and if so, to what extent then?*® The
arbitrators specifically emphasized that in accordance with international law the
owner is considered to be deprived of its property also in that cases when its use or
income generation from its use becomes impossible, even if in purely legal terms
the ownership to such property remains inviolable. (para. 115 of the Award).

When examining the case Middle East Cement Shipping and Handling Co.
v. Egypt” the arbitral panel noted: in case of adoption by the state of the measures
which result in deprivation of the investor of the possibility to gain profit from its
investments, even if the investor nominally remains their owner, these are the
measures which consequences are equal to expropriation. In fact, the investor is
deprived of the value of its investments as a result of such measures.”

Actions of the Kyrgyz Republic as violation of fair treatment

In the preamble to the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights
dated March 28, 1997 it is emphasized that effective protection of the rights of an
investor is a prerequisite for the development of the Parties’ economies.

Similarly, the preamble to the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic “On Investments
in the Kyrgyz Republic” defines the basic principles of the state investment policy
aimed at improvement of the investment climate in the Republic and
encouragement of domestic and foreign investments by according fair, equitable
treatment to the investors and the guarantees of protection of the investments into
the economy of the Kyrgyz Republic raised by them.

Having analyzed the above mentioned actions of the state bodies and
officials of the Kyrgyz Republic, the Arbitral Tribunal concluded that the
principles laid down in the Law “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” were
not complied with, which found its reflection in violation through the above
mentioned actions of legitimate expectations of the Claimants as Investors and in
the failure to secure fair treatment for the Claimants’ investments.

Claim for an adequate compensation of the investment value

Legal grounds of the claim for payment an adequate compensation of
the investment value

The principal legal basis for compensation of damages to investors are the
tules fixed in Article 9 of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s Rights
dated March 28, 1997 which stipulate that investments are not subject to
nationalization and can not be exposed to requisition, except for the cases where
such measures are permitted with payment of an adequate compensation.
According to Article 7 of the mentioned Convention, legal regulation in this sphere
takes place on the basis of international treaties of the parties and their national
legislation.

According to paragraphs 1-2 Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz Republic
“On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, investments shall not be subject to
expropriation — nationalization, requisition or other equivalent measures, including
actions or omission on the part of the competent state bodies of the Kyrgyz
Republic which resulted in compulsory seizure of the investor’s funds or its
deprivation of the possibility to use the results of investments with observation of a

92

due process of law and payment of a timely, proper and real compensation for
damages, including the lost profit.

Compensation should be equivalent to a fair market value of the
expropriated investment or a part thereof, including the lost profit, directly as of
the date of the decision on expropriation.

In 2001 the UN Commission on International Trade Law adopted the Draft
Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts which
represent a codification of customary rules of law on international responsibility of
states (which gained wide support in the doctrine of contemporary investment
law"').

In accordance with Chapter 2 Part 2 of this document® the forms of
compensation for harm are restitution (reinstatement), payment of compensation
equal to the value of investments as of the date of expropriation (adequate
compensation), payment of additional compensation (reimbursement for the lost
profit) and satisfaction (compensation for moral damages).

Basing on the provisions of the Convention for the Protection of Investor’s
Rights and the Law “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic” and taking into
account the available evidence on file, the Arbitral tribunal considers legitimate the
claim of the Claimants for compensation of damages as a result of the actions
committed by the Kyrgyz Republic in respect of the Claimants.

Pecuniary valuation of the Claimants’ claims

In the Statement of Claim the Claimants request the MCCI Arbitration to
examine the present dispute, to declare the conduct of the Respondent as
internationally wrongful and to obligate the Respondent:

- to compensate the Claimants for the value of investments in the amount
specified in the Appraisal Report as a measure of liability for expropriation of
investments as well as in connection with the fact that the fair treatment of
investments was violated.

The specified amount is a measure of liability for expropriation and at the
same time the maximum amount of liability for refusal of “unconditional

protection”. It should be recovered in case of establishment by the Arbitral tribunal
of any of the above mentioned facts or their totality;

- to pay compound interests on the amount of damages determined by the
Arbitral tribunal, with monthly capitalization, as of the date of the award till the
date of payment at a refinancing rate of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic;

- to reimburse the Claimants for the arbitration costs, including the costs of
legal representation of the Claimants’ interests during examination of the present
dispute in arbitration.

The Claimants did not raise the claim for payment of interests in the course
of arbitration proceedings due to fact that the arbitration fee was not paid on that
amount.

It follows from the materials of the case that initially investments were made
in a monetary form, however subsequently they substantially changed their form.
As provided for by para.1 Article | of the Law of the Republic “On Investments in

the Kyrgyz Republic”, “a form in which the assets are invested or a change of this
form does not affect the character as investments”.

Definition of the value of investments

The Arbitral tribunal found that according to Article 10 of the Convention
for the Protection of Investor’s Rights dated March 28, 1997 the procedure of
determination of the amount of compensation and its payment shall be established
by the national legislation of the recipient country.

As provided for by paragraphs 2 and 3 of Article 6 of the Law of the Kyrgyz
Republic “On Investments in the Kyrgyz Republic”, compensation shall be
equivalent to a fair market value of the expropriated investment or a part thereof,
including the lost profit, immediately as of the date of the decision on
expropriation. The compensation should be actually realizable and paid within the
time limits agreed upon by the parties and in a freely convertible currency.

As follows from the materials of the case, the Claimants claim compensation
of the following types of Investments:

1) a fair market value of the right to use subsoil (formalized as the license)
as of the date of expropriation. According to the Appraisal Report this amount
made up 107.781.000 USD.

94

2) a fair market value of the property of “Kutisay Mining” LLC as of the
date of expropriation (fixed assets — paragraphs 1-5 in the Table on page 2 of
Exhibit Ne2 to Appraisal Report), as well as of the investments into acquisition of a
100% shareholding in the authorized capital of “Kashkinsky Plant of Rare-Earth
Elements” LLC (para. 12);

3) monetary funds which constituted expenses (industrial, general,
administrative, charitable), including tax (bonus) on acquisition of the license
(paragraphs 6-11 in the Table on page 2 of Exhibit Ne 2 to Appraisal Report).
These costs were directed at carrying out the activity under the license for
development of the deposit, i.e. they were invested.

The amount of the claimed compensation under the second and third points
is determined in the Appraisal Report and is given in more detail in the Exhibit Ne
2 to the Report and made up: for the period from January 1, 2010 till June 25, 2012
- 7.499.000 USD; for the period from June 26, 2012 till September 1, 2013 -
2.573.000 USD.

Thus, the total amount of claims makes up 117.853.000 USD.

The market value of the right to use the “Kutessay II” rare-earth elements
deposit as of the date of the license suspension and of a total amount of direct costs
incurred by the company in the course of implementation of the project of
development of the “Kutessay II” deposit was determined by the “Al-Star” Center
of Property Appraisal and Expert Examination” LLC (the city of Bishkek) and
signed by the General Director N.S. Ignatenko.

In the course of carrying out their work the appraisers were guided by the
requirements of the following regulatory documents: the Appraisal Standards
binding for application by the entities of appraisal activity in the Kyrgyz Republic
approved by the Resolution of the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 217
dated April 3, 2006, Provisional regulations on the activity of appraisers and
appraisal organizations in the Kyrgyz Republic approved by the Resolution of the
Government of the Kyrgyz Republic Ne 537 dated August 21, 2003, and
International Appraisal Standards (IAS), 8" edition, 2007.

The Report Ne 01-0913 dated September 05, 2013 is drafted in accordance
with the requirements of the mentioned regulatory documents, on a high
professional level and does not raise any doubts as to reliability of the conclusions
contained therein.

However, in the opinion of the Arbitral tribunal, charity is a voluntary
gratuitous contribution and the charity related costs of “Kutisay Mining” LLC in
the amount of 114.059,70 USD can not be considered as investments into the
objects of economic activity and their value shall not be compensated.

95

Thus, 117.738.940, 30 USD should be paid to the Claimants as
compensation.

6. Claimants’ claim for compensation of costs related to arbitration fee

The Arbitral tribunal held that when filing the Statement of Claim the
Claimants paid the arbitration fee (including registration fee) in the amount of
159.128,00 USD.

Since in connection with violation by the Respondent of its obligations the
Claimants were forced to apply to the MCCI Arbitration for protection of the
violated right and since the claims of the Claimants are satisfied only partially, the
Arbitral tribunal is guided by para.1 Article 23 of the Rules, according to which the
arbitration costs shall be distributed between the Parties in proportion to the
satisfied and dismissed claims. Since the claims of the Claimants are satisfied not
in the amount claimed in the Statement of claim but in the amount of 117.853.000
USD, the Respondent shall pay the Claimants 158.975,24 as compensation for the
arbitration fee costs.

7. Claimants’ claim for compensation of costs related to payment for the
services of legal representatives

As far as the Claimants’ claim for compensation of costs related to payment
for the services of legal representatives in the present case in the amount
308.142,50 USD is concerned, the Arbitral tribunal found as follows.

As proof of the costs incurred by the Claimants for payment for the services
of legal representatives they have submitted the invoice and the acceptance
certificate dated September 19, 2013, payment order dated September 30, 2013;
the invoice and the acceptance certificate dated November 27, 2013, payment order
dated November 28, 2013; the invoice and the acceptance certificate dated
December 27, 2013, payment order dated January 22, 2014; invoice dated January

January 29, 2014; the invoice and the acceptance certificate dated February 28,
2014, payment order dated March 3, 2014; the invoice and the acceptance

LLC Ne 0000030/1 dated May 22, 2014, certificate dated May 5, 2014, cash
payment voucher Ne C0000000206 dated May 22, 2014; receipt Ne 0000373 dated
October 12, 2013, bill from the hotel “Silk Road Lodge” dated October 16, 2013,

2013, bill from the hotel “Mandarin” Ne 161336, cheque Ne 018424 dated July 24,
2013; receipt to cash receipt voucher Ne 0124 dated March 28, 2014, cheque Ne
00155315 dated March 28, 2014, bill from the hotel “Mandarin” Ne 172936,
cheque Ne 019482 dated April 8, 2014; invoice Ne 15926 dated April 22, 2014, bill
from the hotel “Mandarin” Ne 174204 and Ne 174205; invoice Ne 574 dated May
27, 2014 and payment order.

The right of a party in which favour the award was passed to claim that the
costs it incurred in connection with payment for the services of legal
representatives be imposed on the other party is provided for in para.2 Article 23 of
the MCCI Arbitration Rules and in para.4 Article 8 of the Schedule of Arbitration
Costs.

Having assessed the activity of legal representatives of the Claimants and the
volume of submitted materials in support of the raised claims, the Arbitral tribunal,
taking account of the complexity of the case, holds that basing on the criterion of
reasonableness and proportionality the Claimants’ claim for reimbursement of
costs, including those related to protection of its interests by legal representatives,
raised on the basis of Article 23 of the Rules and para.4 Article 8 of the Schedule
of Arbitration Costs, is reasonable and substantiated and should be satisfied in full
in the amount of 308.142,50 USD.

Within the time period fixed by the Arbitral tribunal the Respondent did not
submit any comments regarding the Claimants’ claim for reimbursement of costs,
including the costs for payment for the services of legal representatives.

In view of the foregoing and being guided by Articles 50 and 51 of the Rules
the MCCI Arbitration resolves:

97

Operative part of the award:

1. To dismiss the Motion dated April 25, 2014 for postponement of dispute
resolution till examination by the Moscow City Arbitration Court of the declaration
on the lack of jurisdiction of the arbitration court.

2. To acknowledge the jurisdiction of the MCCI Arbitration to examine the
dispute in the action of the company “Stans Energy Corp.” (Canada) and “Kutisay
Mining” LLC (the Kyrgyz Republic) against the Kyrgyz Republic for
compensation for the damages in the amount of 117.853.000 USD. In connection
with this award to consider void para.1 of the Ruling of the MCCI Arbitration
dated March 31, 2014.

3. To recover from the Kyrgyz Republic in favour of the company “Stans
Energy Corp.” (Province of Ontario, Canada) and “Kutisay Mining” LLC (the

principal claim, 158.975,24 USD (one hundred fifty eight thousand nine hundred
seventy five USD and twenty four cents) as reimbursement for the Claimants’

eight thousand one hundred forty two USD and fifty cents) as reimbursement of
the Claimants’ costs for administration of the case. To dismiss the rest of the claim.

4. To dismiss the Claimants’ claim for recovery of compound interests
