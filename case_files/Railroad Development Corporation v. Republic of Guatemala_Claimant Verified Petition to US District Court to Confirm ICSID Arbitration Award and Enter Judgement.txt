the substantive investment protections set forth in Article 10.5 of CAFTA.

14. Claims by an investor that a Party has violated CAFTA may be brought, inter
alia, under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules and Procedures for Arbitration
Proceedings (the “ICSID Rules”) if both the Respondent and the Party of the investor are parties

The Dispute

18. [n 1997. the Government of Guatemala awarded RDC a 50-year concession
(usufruct”) to revive, develop and operate and the State-owned national railway system. RDC,
through its local majority-owned subsidiary, Compafiia Dessarolladora Ferroviaria, S.A., also
known as Ferrovias Guatemala (“FYG"), subsequently invested millions of dollars in the
usutruct, renovated the railroad and reestablished commercial service.

19. After RDC had successfully operated the railway for a number of years, disputes
arose between the parties over Guatemala’s failure to remove squatters from the railway tine and
to make agreed payments to a railway trust fund, as well as over RDC’s alleged contractual

obligation to invest in and reopen the railway’s Pacific corridor. ‘These disputes led the President

of Guatemala to issue an executive decrce on August 25, 2006 stating that the usufruct contract
allowing RDC to use the State-owned rolling stock and railway equipment was “/esivo,” or
“harmful to the interests of the State,” based upon alleged technical illegalities in the contract’s
execution and ratification by the Government (the “Lesivo Declaration”). The Lesivo
Declaration was issued after RDC refused to give into the Government’s demands that RDC
Tenegotiate or surrender several of its key economic and legal rights under the usufruct contracts.

20. The Lesivo Declaration caused RDC’s railway business to collapse due to the
environment of commercial and political uncertainty it created with the railway’s customers and
potential business partners. RDC was ultimately forced to shut down its operations in Guatemala
in the fall of 2007.

The Arbitration

21. On June 14, 2007, RDC brought the Arbitration against Respondent under
CAFTA and the ICSID Convention, alleging breaches of CAFTA’s forcign investinent
protections. including the “minimum standard of treatment.” which requires each CAFTA state
party to provide, among other things, “fair and equitable treatment” to investors of the other
CAFTA parties.

22. Pursuant to CAFTA and the ICSID Rules, a Tribunal was constituted, consisting
of Dr. Andres Rigo Sureda, President, fon. Stuart E. Eizenstat and Professor James Crawford.
After resolving numerous jurisdictional objections posed by Guatemala, the Tribunal entertained
extensive pleadings from the parties and held public hearings on the merits of the dispute in
Washington, D.C. from December 8 through 16, 2011. At the hearings. RDC presented 11 fact
and four expert witnesses and Guatemala presented eight fact and two expert witnesses. The

parties submitted over 500 exhibits during the proceedings and the merits hearing transcript

extends to 2,179 pages, Subsequent to the hearings, the parties filed further pleadings and
Honduras, E] Salvador and the United States filed submissions concerning issues of treaty
interpretation.
The Award

23, On June 29, 2012, the Tribunal issued an Award, holding that the Respondent
had breached the minimum standard of treatment guaranteed to RDC’s investment by Article
10.5 of CAFTA. It ordered Respondent to pay RDC (a) $6,576,861 on account of its sunk
investment; (b) $1,350.429 for RDC’s expenses incurred in an orderly shutdown of the railroad
after the Lesivo Declaration: and (c) $3,379.450.93 for its 82% share of the net present value
(“NPV”) of the PVG real estate leases existing as of the date of the Lesive Declaration, minus
RIDC’s 82% share of rents paid to FVG under those leases since the Lesive Declaration.’ It also
ordered that Guatemala pay RDC interest on those sums from the date of the Lesivo Declaration
(i.e., August 25, 2006) at the rate of six-month LIBOR plus two percent until the date of payment
and to reimburse RDC for its [CSID administrative expenses relatcd to Guatemala’s
jurisdictional objections in the amount of $192,427, plus interest thereon at the above rate.’
Upon Guatemala’s payment of the foregoing sums, RDC is obligated by the Award to renounce
all its rights under the usufruct and to transfer to Guatemala all of its shares in FVG. A certified
copy of the Tribunal’s Award is attached as Exhibit A.

Rectification of the Award
24. On August 10, 2012, RDC filed a Request for Supplementation and Rectification

of Award under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Rules, asserting that the Tribunal had made errors in

2 award 49 277, 283(2). Because the date on which Guatemala would comply with the Award was unknown, the
Tribuna! noted that the computation of the credit for rents received by FVG and for interest owed by Respondent
would have to await 2 subsequent determination between the partics.

the Trihunal issued its Decision on Claimant’s Request for Supplementation and Rectification of
Award (“Rectification Decision”). A certified copy of the Rectification Decision is attached as
Exhibit B.

25. — Inits Rectification Decision, the Tribunal corrected a computational error in the
Award to increase the amount of RDC’s share of the NPV of real estate leases existing at the
time of the Lesivo Declaration from $3,379,450.93 to $5,591,469,30.' All other aspects of the
Award remained unchanged.
