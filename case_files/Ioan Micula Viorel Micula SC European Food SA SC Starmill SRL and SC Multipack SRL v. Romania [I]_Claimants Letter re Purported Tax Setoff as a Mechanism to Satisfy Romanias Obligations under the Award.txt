Re: Ioan Micula, et al. v. The Government of Romania, 15-mc-00107-P1

Dear Judge Schofield:

We represent Petitioners Ioan Micula, S.C. European Food S.A., S.C. Starmill S.R.L.
and S.C, Multipack S.R.L. and Intervenor Viorel Micula (collectively, “Claimants”) in the
above-captioned matter, and write on behalf of Claimants in response to the letter submitted
by Romania on March 1, 2016 (ECF No. 125) (“Romania’s Letter”). Claimants request that
the Court take note, under Rule 106 of the Federal Rules of Evidence, of the entire context of
paragraph 307 of the Decision on Annulment, which Romania selectively quotes in its letter:

In addition to the above, Romania contends that the decision regarding the
allocation of damages in the Award results in contradictory consequences
in its execution. In this respect, the Committee notes that: it is within
Romania’s power to avoid the contradictory consequences it considers the
Award enables. In the first place, the Award places Romania with both
the obligation and the right to pay the compensation awarded to the
Claimants and to decide how to discharge such obligation. In fact,
Romania could exercise such right by paying any of the five Claimants to

isch its obligation and to P such pay with the
Corporate Claimants’ fiscal obligations (those which Romania claims that
the Claimants are trying to avoid). Romania has already benefitted from
this right and has compensated part of the amount of the Award against
the tax obligations of some of the Corporate Claimants. This fact alone
disayows Romania’s reiterated arguments that the Award is contradictory
because it allows a result that runs afoul of the reasoning of the Tribunal.
It is, as has been seen, within Romania’s power, as well as a right
protected by the Award, to avoid contradictory consequences in the
application of the Award. This argument, in itself, is not a matter to be
dealt with as a ground for annulment.

Decision on Annulment, loan Micula, Viorel Micula and Others v. Romania, ICSID Case
No. ARB/05/20, at 1307 (Feb. 26, 2016) (italics indicate portion quoted in Romania’s
Letter).

Thus, contrary to the implication in Romania’s Letter, the ad hoc Committee did not
confirm the validity of Romania’s purported tax setoff as a mechanism to satisfy its
obligations under the Award. Rather, the ad hoc Committee merely used Romania’s attempt
to satisfy the Award through a purported tax setoff against some of Claimants as an example
to reject Romania’s argument in the annulment proceedings that the Award should be vacated
because it failed to allocate damages among the Claimants. Claimants respectfully refer the

Court to their opposition papers, which explain in detail why the purported tax setoff was
subsequently found to be invalid by a court of appeal in Romania.
