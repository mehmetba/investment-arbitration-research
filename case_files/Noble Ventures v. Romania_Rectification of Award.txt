THE TRIBUNAL
Composed as above,

After deliberation,

Makes the following decision:

1. On October 12, 2005, the Secretary-General of ICSID dispatched to the parties
certified copies of the Award rendered by the Tribunal in this arbitration (the “Award”).
On October 18, 2005, in accordance with Article 49 of the ICSID Convention and Rule
49 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, the Respondent Romania submitted a Request for
Rectification of the Award (the “Request”) dated October 17, 2005.

2. In its Request, Romania alleged that, due to a clerical oversight, Ms. Abby Cohen
Smutny was not listed in page 6 of the Award (which dealt with the representation of the
parties) as counsel for the Respondent. Romania thus, requested that page 6 of the

Award be rectified to reflect her name.

3. By letter of October 19, 2005, the Claimant indicated that it had no objection to
the rectification requested by the Respondent.

4, On October 26, 2005, the Secretary-General registered the Request, pursuant to
ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(a). On the same date, the Secretary-General, in accordance
with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(b), notified the parties of the registration of the
Request and, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(2)(c) and (d), transmitted

copies of the Request to Noble Ventures, Inc, and to each member of the Tribunal.

5. The Tribunal has taken note of Romania’s Request for Rectification and of the
Claimant’s lack of objections thereof. In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(3),
the members of the Tribunal have agreed that it would not be necessary for them to meet

in order to consider the Request.

6. The tribunal has taken into consideration Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention,

in accordance with which the Request is made, which reads, in pertinent part:

The Tribunal upon the request of a party made within 45
days after the date on which the award was rendered may
after notice to the other party decide any question which it
had omitted to decide in the award, and shall rectify any
clerical, arithmetical or similar error.in the award. Its
decision shall become part of the award and shall be
notified to the parties in the same manner as the award.

(...)

7. Having considered Romania’s Request and the Claimant’s lack of objections,
the Tribunal unanimosly decides to grant the Request for Rectification, thereby

sustituting page six of the Award for the enclosed revised page six.

8. Each party shall bear the entirety of the expenses incurred by it in connection
with the present Decision. The costs, including fees of the members of the Tribunal,

shall be borne by the parties in equal shares.

9. For the purpose of ICSID Arbitration Rule 49(4), the present decision refers to
the terms of the Award dated October 12, 2005, relating to the matters indicated in
Arbitration Rule 47(1)(a-g). In accordance with Article 49(2) of the ICSID
Convention, the present decision constifutes an integral part of the Award.
