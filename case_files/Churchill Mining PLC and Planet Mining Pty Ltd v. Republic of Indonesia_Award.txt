PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Introduction

The procedural history leading up to the Tribunal’s Decisions on Jurisdiction
of 24 February 2014 is set out in full in those Decisions, which are made
part of the present Award.’ However, prior to summarizing the procedural
history relevant to the document authenticity phase, the Tribunal will recall
the main procedural steps of the earlier phase of this arbitration.
Abbreviations used in the Tribunal's Decisions on Jurisdiction are equally
deemed repeated and incorporated into the present Award, to the extent not
explicitly set out.

As recorded in the Decision on Jurisdiction between Churchill Mining Plc
(“Churchill”) and the Republic of Indonesia (‘“Indonesia’),? the dispute in this
case was initially submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Agreement
between the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments dated 27 April 1976 (the “UK-
Indonesia BIT”, the “Treaty”, or the “BIT”), which entered into force on 24
March 1977, and the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on
14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”). As recalled below, another
ICSID proceeding was subsequently initiated on the basis of the ICSID
Convention and the Agreement between the Government of Australia and
the Government of the Republic of Indonesia for the Promotion and
Protection of Investments dated 17 November 1992 (the “Australia-
Indonesia BIT”, the “Treaty”, or the “BIT”).3

On 22 May 2012, Churchill filed a Request for Arbitration with ICSID
pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and the UK-Indonesia BIT.
The request concerned a dispute between Churchill and Indonesia arising
out of Churchill’s alleged investment in Indonesian companies in the coal
Decision on Jurisdiction in ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40 between Churchill
Mining Plc and the Republic of Indonesia (“Churchill Decision on Jurisdiction”), {J 48-

Mining Pty Ltd and the Republic of Indonesia (“Planet Decision on Jurisdiction”), J] 48-

mining industry. In the request, Churchill invoked Articles 3(2) and 5(1) of
the UK-Indonesia BIT. According to Churchill, Indonesia had taken
measures against its investment in violation of these provisions of the BIT.

On 22 June 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered Churchill's
Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention
under ICSID Case No. ARB/12/14. An Arbitral Tribunal comprised of Prof.
Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler (President), Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg, and
Mr. Michael Hwang S.C. was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b)
of the ICSID Convention, and the proceedings commenced on 3 October
2012.

On 26 November 2012, Planet Mining Pty Ltd (“Planet”) filed a Request for
Arbitration with ICSID pursuant to Article 36 of the ICSID Convention and
the Australia-Indonesia BIT. This request, which concerned a dispute
between Planet and Indonesia arising out of Planet’s alleged investment in
Indonesian companies in the coal mining industry, was expressly made in
connection with that filed by Churchill against Indonesia on 22 May 2012. As
noted in the Decisions on Jurisdiction, the facts upon which both requests
are based are essentially the same.*

On 26 December 2012, the Secretary-General of the Centre registered
Planet's Request for Arbitration pursuant to Article 36(3) of the ICSID
Convention under ICSID No. ARB/12/40. On 22 January 2013, pursuant to
the Parties’ agreement, an Arbitral Tribunal also comprised of Prof. Gabrielle
Kaufmann-Kohler (President), Prof. Albert Jan van den Berg, and
Mr. Michael Hwang S.C. was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(a)
of the ICSID Convention, and the proceedings commenced on that date.

Having agreed in principle that the two disputes would be heard in a
consolidated case, Churchill, Planet, and Indonesia agreed at a common
session on 1 March 2013 to join the two proceedings in all respects, but
disagreed as to whether the Tribunal should render one joint decision/award
in respect of both Churchill and Planet or two separate decisions/awards,
one in respect of each claimant. In Procedural Order No. 4 of 18 March
2013, the Tribunal confirmed the content of the common session and noted

Churchill Decision on Jurisdiction, § 48; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, § 48.
Churchill Decision on Jurisdiction, § 58; Planet Decision on Jurisdiction, 4 59.

that it would decide whether to render one or two decisions/awards at a later
stage, after consultation with the Parties.®

In paragraph 14.1 of Procedural Order No. 1, as amended by the Tribunal’s
letter of 21 February 2013, and recorded in Procedural Order No. 4, the
Tribunal set a schedule for the jurisdictional phase of the case.”

The Parties having filed their written submissions on jurisdiction, the
Tribunal held a hearing on jurisdiction in Singapore on 13-14 May 2013.8

On 24 February 2014, the Tribunal issued two Decisions on Jurisdiction, one
in respect of Churchill and Indonesia and the other in respect of Planet and
Indonesia. In both Decisions, the Tribunal decided that it had jurisdiction
over the dispute submitted to it in this arbitration and reserved its decision
on costs.°

By letter of 7 March 2014, the Parties were invited by the Tribunal to confer
and make their best efforts to agree on a schedule for the merits phase of
this arbitration and to revert to the Tribunal by 24 March 2014.

On 24 March 2014, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were unable
to agree on a schedule for the merits phase and each made a proposal.

On 27 March 2014, the Claimants filed an Application for Provisional
Measures, alleging that “Indonesia is seeking to usurp the jurisdiction of this
Tribunal and destabilise the Claimants' witnesses and potential witnesses by
the threat of criminal sanction”.'° Following an exchange of correspondence
between the Parties and the Tribunal,'! the Respondent was invited to

Procedural Order No. 4 that the procedural calendar under Annex 3 to Procedural
Order No. 1, amended by letter of 21 February 2013 and supplemented by letter of 1
March 2013, would govern; that the Tribunal’s orders issued as of the date of the
common session would apply to all three Parties, with the exception of Procedural
Order No. 3 dealing with Indonesia’s request for provisional measures in ICSID Case
No. ARB/12/14; and that the Centre would maintain only one case account, the case
number being ICSID No. ARB/12/14 and 12/40.

Claimants stated inter alia that, if the Tribunal were inclined to order the
inspection of any of the original documents identified by the Respondent, the
Tribunal should also order the Respondent to produce for inspection the
originals identified by the Claimants in its response.

On 18 June 2014, following an exchange of correspondence with the
Parties,'? the Tribunal issued a further amended schedule for the merits
phase of this proceeding. On the same date, the Claimants filed a second

upon by the Claimants’ experts on quantum,’ the Tribunal informed the
Parties of its finding that the Claimants had satisfactorily responded to the
Respondent’s request for documents, which the Respondent alleged were
missing from the Claimants’ filing of 18 June 2014.

On 22 July 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 10, which
recorded the Tribunal’s decision on the Parties’ Requests for Inspection of
Original Documents. The Tribunal ordered each Party to make the
requested originals available for inspection, and requested the Parties to
comply with the directions on the logistics of the inspection set forth in its
order.

On 18 August 2014, following an exchange of correspondence with the
Parties regarding the organization of the document inspection,’ the Tribunal

Respondent's request.

Pre-hearing phase

On 29 August 2014, a document inspection took place at Maxwell
Chambers, Singapore, under the supervision of ICSID.2°

On 2 September 2014, the Claimants filed an Application for Provisional
Measures, alleging that the Respondent had “sought to destabilise the
Claimants’ witnesses and access to evidence, circumvent the agreed
document disclosure process, and ultimately usurp the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal”.?*

On 15 September 2014, the Respondent submitted its Observations to
Claimants’ Request for Provisional Measures dated 2 September 2014,
together with the Second Forensic Handwriting Examination Report of

2014, the Claimants filed translations of certain exhibits and requested that
they be allowed to submit the remaining translations by 26 September 2014

premises on 29 August 2014.

On 25 September 2014, Indonesia filed an Application for Dismissal of
Claimants’ Claims Based on the Forged and Fabricated Ridlatama Mining

Messrs. Ishak, Noor, Ordiansyah, Armin, Ramadani, Sianipar, and
Ms. Nurohmah, as well as the preliminary expert reports of Econ One
Research and Bara Consulting.”? Indonesia requested that the Tribunal (i)
modify the procedural calendar to organize an immediate hearing (within
three weeks) to address the authenticity of the disputed documents, and
ultimately (ii) dismiss all of the Claimants’ claims as inadmissible.

On 26 September 2014, the Claimants provided their comments on the
Application for Dismissal, opposing the request for an immediate hearing.
On the same date, the Claimants also submitted the remaining translations
of their exhibits and their Reply to Indonesia's Observations of
15 September 2014 regarding the Claimants’ Application for Provisional
Measures dated 2 September 2014 (“Claimants’ Reply on Provisional

Measures”).

On 30 September 2014, the Respondent suggested that it would be helpful
for the Tribunal to receive the Claimants’ comments on the Respondent's
proposal of 15 September that the Claimants disclose the conclusions of
their forensic experts following the August document inspection. On 3
October 2014, the Claimants opposed the Respondent's “request for
information on the work that has been performed by the Claimants’ forensic
experts to date”, and indicated it would present its expert evidence in
accordance with the procedural calendar, with its case on the merits.2%

On 6 October 2014, the Respondent submitted its Rejoinder to the
Claimants’ Reply on Provisional Measures of 26 September 2014.

On 9 October 2014, Indonesia provided further comments on its Application
for Dismissal, reiterating its prior requests.
On 13 October 2014, the Respondent submitted Mr. Gideon Epstein’s Third
Forensic Handwriting Examination Report.
On 15 October 2014, the Respondent wrote to the Tribunal to reiterate its

award on costs if the Ridlatama mining undertaking licenses and other
documentation were found to have been forged and fabricated.”

On 17 October 2014, the Claimants submitted further comments on the
Respondent's letter of 9 October 2014 in connection with the Application for
Dismissal.

On 21 October 2014, the Tribunal held a hearing by telephone conference
on the Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures and the procedural
treatment of the Respondent's forgery allegations.

On 27 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 12 (“PO12”),
rejecting Indonesia’s request for the immediate adjudication of the forgery
issue. However, the Tribunal decided to bifurcate the proceedings between
a liability and a quantum phase, with the then-existing timetable applying to
the liability phase.

Following a request for reconsideration filed by Indonesia on 3 November
2014 and the Claimants’ comments thereon of 10 November 2014, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 13 (“PO13”) on 18 November 2014,
which granted Indonesia’s request for reconsideration, and decided to
address the authenticity of the disputed documents as a matter of priority.
The Tribunal determined that the scope of the authenticity phase would
extend to “all factual aspects relating to forgery as well as the legal
consequences of a finding of forgery”. PO13 added that this was not meant
to prevent the Parties from addressing other matters which they might deem
appropriate in connection with the forgery allegations and arguments. The
Tribunal also ruled that the decision in PO12 regarding bifurcation between
liability and quantum would remain in abeyance, and would be considered if
and when appropriate.

On 22 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 14, which
rejected the Claimants’ Application for Provisional Measures. However, in
light of the possibility of obtaining evidence through the Indonesian criminal
investigation, the Tribunal ordered Indonesia to request leave before filing
any evidence obtained by way of the criminal investigation into the alleged
forgery issue.

Following a request for reconsideration of PO13 filed by the Claimants on
23 November 2014 and the Parties’ comments thereon of 1, 8, and
12 December 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 15 (“PO15”)
on 12 January 2015, which reaffirmed PO13. The Tribunal set out a new
procedural calendar and contemplated a new document inspection. It also
specified the scope of the document authenticity phase as being limited to
(i) the factual question whether the impugned documents were authentic or
not (including especially who signed the documents and how) and (ii) legal
submissions on the positions in law in a scenario where there would be
forgery (including for instance the legal requirements for estoppel, as
opposed to the facts allegedly justifying a finding of estoppel).”>

Following correspondence from the Parties of 19 and 26 January 2015, the
Tribunal proposed hearing dates, amended the deadlines for document
production and denied the Respondent's request to be afforded additional
time to rebut the Claimants’ witness statements and expert reports prior to
the hearing.’

By letter of 3 February 2015, Clifford Chance informed the Tribunal that they
had been appointed as the Claimants’ legal representatives in these
arbitration proceedings, replacing the Claimants’ previous legal counsel,
Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP.27 By email of the same date, the
Claimants requested an extension of the deadline to file the Parties’
document production requests, and informed the Tribunal of their
unavailability on the proposed hearing dates. By letter of the same date, the
Respondent objected to the requested extension and reserved its right to
request an order for security for costs in light of what it perceived as a sign
of further deterioration of Churchill's finances. By letter of 4 February 2015,
the Claimants responded to the Respondent's letter of 3 February. By letter
of 6 February 2015, the Tribunal granted the requested extension of the
deadline to file the Parties’ document production requests and proposed
new hearing dates.

By email of 13 February 2015, the Respondent informed the Tribunal of the
Parties’ agreement to conduct a second document inspection the week of 13
April 2015.

By letter of 4 March 2015, the Tribunal confirmed the schedule for the
document authenticity phase of this arbitration.

By letter of 11 March 2015, the Respondent filed a request for leave to
submit new evidence — Recommendation No. 522.21/5213/Ek from the
Governor of East Kalimantan, H. Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Minister of
Forestry, dated 29 December 2009, regarding Utilization of Forest Area in
the name of PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (the “Recommendation”) — and
advised the Tribunal that it would file additional and supplementary witness
statements and an additional report from Mr. Epstein “in relation to two other
sets of suspicious documents on the record”.28

On 13 March 2015, the Parties exchanged their requests for document
production and physical inspection of original documents. On the same date,
pursuant to Article 43 of the ICSID Convention, the Claimants filed an
application for the production of certain stamps and ink pads, which they
requested should be made available for inspection and sampling at the
document inspection.

On 18 March 2015, the Claimants filed their comments on the Respondent's
letter of 11 March 2015. By letter of 20 March 2015, the Tribunal ruled inter
alia on the Respondent's 11 March request, granting the Respondent leave

to file the additional materials subject to certain conditions.

On 27 March 2015, the Respondent submitted comments on the Claimants’
application for the production of certain stamps and ink pads and on certain
specific observations made in their letter of 18 March 2015.

Having exchanged their responses to each other’s requests for document
production and physical inspection of original documents on 24 March 2015,
each Party submitted their replies on 30 and 31 March 2015.79

On 3 April 2015, further to its letter of 11 March 2015 and subsequent
correspondence, °° the Respondent submitted the Recommendation,
additional and supplementary witness statements,*' and other supporting
documents. The Respondent also reiterated its concern (in light of an interim
report from Churchill) that it would not be able to recover a potential award
of costs and again reserved its rights to request security for costs. On the
same date, the Respondent submitted further comments on the Claimants’
application for the production of certain stamps and ink pads.

On 6 April 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 16 (“PO16”),
which addressed the Parties’ document inspection and document production
requests. By letter of 15 April 2015, the Parties were also advised of further
rules that would apply to the document inspection.

On 8 April 2015, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent's
letters of 27 March and 3 April 2015 regarding the Claimants’ application for
the production of certain stamps and ink pads. The Claimants invited the
Respondent to “unequivocally” confirm that it no longer had in its
possession, custody or control any stamps and ink pads used by the
Regency of East Kutai or the Governor of East Kalimantan between
1 January 2007 and 30 June 2010. They also accepted the Respondent’s
offer to inspect current stamps and ink pads used by the Regency and
Governor's office since 2010. Upon the Tribunal’s invitation, the Respondent
submitted on 10 April 2015 its comments on certain matters raised by the
Claimants in their letter of 8 April. In view of the Respondent’s confirmation
that it no longer has any stamps and ink pads used during the relevant
period, the Tribunal considered that the issue whether such stamps and ink
pads should be inspected had become moot.

deadline to produce documents as ordered by the Tribunal, and subsequent

2015 the extension to 20 April of the time limit for document production
(other than documents for the inspection scheduled on 16-17 April), it being
specified that the Tribunal might allow the production of specific documents
until 27 April upon a reasoned request explaining why a given document
could not be produced within the extended time limit of 20 April.?

On 16-17 April 2015, a second document inspection took place in Maxwell
Chambers, Singapore, under the supervision of ICSID.%4

On 21 April 2015, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal order the
Claimants to enter into a confidentiality agreement covering the “Third Party

permit applications and other documents that, in the Respondent's view,
contain commercial information of third parties, on the terms proposed by
the Respondent or such other terms and conditions as the Tribunal deems
appropriate (“Respondent's Request for a Confidentiality Order”). °° The
Respondent also requested the Tribunal to order the Claimants to abide by
the terms of the Respondent's proposed confidentiality agreement pending
the Tribunal's decision on its other request.

On the same date, the Respondent also asked the Tribunal to reconsider its
order in PO16 requiring production of certain documents requested by the
Claimants or, in the alternative, not to draw any adverse inference against
the Respondent for failure to produce the requested documents
(‘Respondent's Request for Reconsideration of Certain Production
Orders”).36

On 24 April 2015, the Claimants submitted comments on the Respondent's
Request for a Confidentiality Order and Request for Reconsideration of
Certain Production Orders.

The Tribunal added that such request should only be filed if the Parties were unable to
agree on production after 20 April. If so, the request should be filed as soon as possible
and in any event prior to 20 April.

At the document inspection, the Claimants indicated, inter alia, that it would not
conduct an inspection of the stamps the Respondent brought to the document
inspection and noted that the stamps of the relevant period were unavailable.

Mr. Noor, who had given a witness statement on behalf of the Respondent
and whose cross-examination had been requested, did not appear. Having
heard the Parties on the Claimants’ application of 30 July 2015, “9 the
Tribunal informed the Parties at the hearing of its decision to disregard
Mr. Noor's witness statement in accordance with paragraph 16.9 of the
Procedural Order No 1 and, by analogy, Article 4.7 of the IBA Rules.*°

The hearing was recorded and transcribed in real time.

Post-hearing phase

After the hearing, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 20 (“PO20”) on
20 August 2015 dealing with post-hearing matters, setting time limits for the
submission of (i) corrections to the hearing transcript, (ii) two rounds of post-
hearing briefs, and (iii) costs submissions. In addition, the Tribunal put
various questions to the Parties to be addressed in the post-hearing briefs.
The Tribunal confirmed that the scope of the post-hearing briefs extended to

See Tr. (Day 1), 8-12; (Day 2), 1-8.

“(i) the factual question whether the impugned documents are authentic or
not and (ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery’. It further
specified that “[mlatter (i) includes the question whether, if they were not
handwritten, the impugned signatures were affixed with authority” and that
“[mlatter (ii) about the legal position in the event of forgery does not cover
the effect of the possible invalidity of the survey and exploration licenses on
the exploitation licenses”.

On 24 September 2015, the Parties jointly filed corrected versions of the
transcripts. On 2 October 2015, they filed further joint corrections to the
transcripts.

On 20 October 2015, the Parties simultaneously filed their first Post-Hearing
Briefs, and on 17 November 2015, their Reply Post-Hearing Briefs.

On 11 December 2015, the Parties simultaneously filed their Costs
Submissions and on 23 December 2015 their comments on the other
Parties’ Costs Submissions.

On 28 March 2016, following a request of 11 February 2016 by the Centre
addressed to both Parties for a fifth advance payment, and the receipt of the
Claimants’ share as confirmed by the Centre's letter of 9 March 2016, the
Centre notified the Respondent's default to the Parties and invited either
Party to pay the outstanding amount by 12 April 2016. On 13 April 2016, the
Centre informed the Parties that the Claimants had paid the fifth advance
payment in full.

By letter of 13 April 2016, the Claimants alleged that the Respondent's
failure to pay its share of the fifth advance was in violation of the ICSID
Convention, the Administrative and Financial Regulations, Procedural Order
No. 1, and the UK-Indonesia and Australia-Indonesia BITs and reserved
their rights as to these violations. The Claimants further invited the Tribunal
to infer from the Respondent's behavior that it had deliberately failed to pay;
sought leave to amend their Costs Submissions to take into account the
impact of the Respondent's default on the fifth advance; put the Respondent
on notice that if it “brings any further application in this arbitration, the
Claimants will ask the Tribunal to direct that the State pay the entirety of any
advance payment requested by ICSID in respect of such application’; and
invited the Respondent “to provide unequivocal confirmation that it is still
participating in these proceedings’. Finally, the Claimants stated that if no

95.

confirmation was provided by 20 April, the Claimants would put the
Respondent on notice that the Claimants “will bring an application under
Rule 42 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules” and “ask the Tribunal to fix a
schedule for the completion of this case without the participation of the
State”.

On that same date, the Tribunal granted leave to the Claimants to amend
and update their Costs Submissions by 20 April 2016, which they did. In
addition, the Claimants filed an Application under Rule 42, requesting the
Tribunal to notify the Respondent of the Claimants’ Application; continue to
proceed to render a “fully-reasoned decision” on the Respondent's
Application for Dismissal; order the Respondent to provide a written
explanation for its default on the fifth advance payment; failing which, grant
leave to file a request for “programming orders”; and make any further
appropriate orders.*'

By letter of 25 April 2016, the Tribunal indicated that the Respondent had
been given notice of the Claimants’ Application, confirmed that it was
deliberating and working on its ruling on the Respondent’s Application for
Dismissal, and invited the Respondent to provide an explanation for its
failure to pay its share of the fifth advance payment as well as to make any
comments it might have on the Claimants’ Application by 9 May 2016.

On 4 May 2016, the Centre confirmed receipt of the payment of the
Respondent's share of the fifth advance, and indicated that it would refund
to the Claimants the amount they had paid on behalf of the Respondent. In
addition, the Centre conveyed the Tribunal’s understanding that, in light of
the Respondent's payment of its share, the Claimants’ Application under
Rule 42 (as well as the invitation made to the Respondent to respond to this
Application by 9 May 2016) had become moot.

By email of 6 May 2016, the Claimants expressed their concern as to the
Tribunal’s understanding that their Application had become moot, since the
Respondent still had not provided any explanation for failing to pay its fifth
advance on time and the Claimants had incurred “considerable costs as a
consequence of the State’s default”. Accordingly, the Claimants requested
that the Respondent provide an explanation for its default and confirm that it
intended to continue to participate in this arbitration. The Claimants also

requested that the Tribunal make an order that, in any event and regardless
of the payment of the fifth advance, the Respondent pay the costs incurred
by the Claimants as a consequence of the Respondent’s default.

On 18 May 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to submit by 30 May
2016 any comments it may have had on the Claimants’ Application under
Rule 42. The Claimants were also invited to update within the same time
limit their costs submissions to the extent that additional costs were incurred
since their amended costs submissions of 20 April 2016.

The Respondent filed its comments on 30 May 2016 and the Claimants filed
their updated costs submissions on the same day.*?

On 9 September 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on
Minnotte v. Poland,®? a decision dealing with the consequence of third party
fraud, an issue which it considered potentially relevant to its decision. The
Tribunal further invited the Parties to state whether they would consent to

the issuance of one decision or award.

On 1 December 2016, the Tribunal drew the Parties’ attention to the discrepancy
between the total amount of the advance payments made by each Party as recorded
by ICSID (USD 800,000) and as reflected in the Parties’ costs submissions (USD
600,000). Noting that this discrepancy was most likely due to the timing of the cost
submissions and of the last advance payments, the Tribunal advised the Parties that it
would understand the costs submissions to refer to a total amount of USD 800,000 per
Party, unless advised otherwise by 5 December 2016. On 2 December 2016, the
Respondent confirmed that its advance payments to ICSID amounted to USD 800,000.
The Claimants did not advise the Tribunal of any different amount by the deadline set
by the Tribunal. For the sake of good order, the Tribunal recalls that the Secretariat
acknowledged receipt of the following payments from the Parties:

1. USD 100,000 from the Claimants on 18 October 2012;
USD 100,000 from the Respondent on 6 November 2012;
USD 150,000 from the Claimants on 2 May 2013;

USD 150,000 from the Respondent on 2 May 2013;

USD 200,000 from the Claimants on 31 March 2014;
USD 200,000 from the Respondent on 7 April 2014;

USD 150,000 from the Claimants on 7 July 2015;

USD 150,000 from the Respondent on 25 August 2015;
USD 200,000 from the Claimants on 9 March 2016; and
10. USD 200,000 from the Respondent on 4 May 2016.

The letters acknowledging receipt of the Parties’ advance payments were attached to
the Tribunal’s letter of 1 December 2016 for the Parties’ convenience.

On 23 September 2016, while the Claimants filed their first submission on
Minnotte with the Secretariat, the Respondent requested a one-week
extension to file its comments. On 24 September 2016, after having heard
the Claimants’ position, the Tribunal extended the time limit for the first
submission on Minnotte until 27 September 2016 and for the Parties’ second
submission until 11 October 2016. The Parties filed their submissions on
these dates* and gave their consent to the issuance of one decision/award.
The proceeding was closed on 6 December 2016.

REQUEST FOR RELIEF

Respondent’s Request for Relief

In the Application for Dismissal, which is the subject matter of this Award,
the Respondent has requested the issuance of an award:

(i) deciding that the Ridlatama Companies’ mining undertaking
licenses for general survey and exploration upgrades were forged,

(ii) deciding that the other impugned documents were forged,
(iii) dismissing all of the claims asserted by Claimants, and
(iv) ordering Claimants to pay the legal fees, expenses and other costs

incurred by the Respondent in connection with this arbitration.®>

In its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, the Respondent requested that the Tribunal:

(a) “find that the Ridlatama Companies’ mining undertaking licenses for
general survey and exploration are not authentic;

(b) find that the other impugned documents are not authentic;

(c) issue an award dismissing all of the claims asserted by Claimants;

(d) order Claimants to pay the legal fees, expenses and other costs
incurred by Respondent in connection with this Arbitration; and

(e) order such other relief as it deems appropriate”.5¢

Claimants’ Request for Relief
The Claimants have asked the Tribunal to:
(i) dismiss the Respondent’s Application, and

(ii) order the Respondent to pay the Claimants’ legal costs of
responding to its Application in full.”

Each Party's first submission on Minnotte was transmitted to the other Party and the

Tribunal on 27 September 2016, once both submissions had been received by the
Secretariat.

THE FACTS

The relevant facts are discussed in detail in the course of this Award. In
addition, the Tribunal refers back to the facts set out in the Decisions on
Jurisdiction, which are incorporated here by reference.

POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES

This section is meant to provide an overview of the Parties’ positions, which
are elaborated upon if and when useful in the context of the Tribunal’s
analysis (Section IV).

The Respondent’s Position

Indonesia requests that the Tribunal dismiss all of the Claimants’ claims on
the ground that the mining undertaking licenses and related approvals
allegedly constituting the basis of the Claimants’ investment in the EKCP
“were forged and fabricated”.** In addition, Indonesia submits that the
upgrading of these non-existent licenses to exploitation mining licenses was
secured through “deception and fraud”.°* For Indonesia, since the Claimants
rely on the validity of the mining licenses held by Ridlatama, a finding that
such licenses are invalid because they were forged would undermine the
Claimants’ entire case.

The Tribunal will first briefly summarize Indonesia’s position on the facts and
the evidence (1) and then continue with its main legal arguments (2).
1. On the facts

Indonesia disputes the authenticity of the following 34 documents, which are
set out in the following table prepared by the Tribunal for ease of reference
(the “Document Table”):

Furthermore, Indonesia contends that the PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral
(‘PT RTM”), PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo (“PT RTP”), PT Investmine
Nusa Persada (“PT INP”) and PT Investama Resources (“PT IR’)
exploitation licenses issued on 27 March 2009 (the “Exploitation
Licenses”),®* the authenticity of which is not challenged, were the product of
deception or fraud.

Indonesia contends that the authenticity of other documents is
“questionable”, such as the 2007 Staff Analysis prepared by Mr. Putra,
which reached the conclusion that Nusantara’s licenses had lapsed and that
the blocks were available.*”

The Respondent notes that the disputed documents bear two sets of
identical signatures of Mr. Ishak (as Regent and as Governor); one set of
identical signatures of Mr. Noor; and one set of identical signatures of
Mr. Bambang Setiawan. In addition, the signature of Mr. Ishak on the Gunter
Documents was copied and pasted from the PT RP Survey License.

The Respondent notes that documents nos. 1 to 18 in the Document Table
bear the identical signature of Mr. Ishak in his capacity as Regent of East
Kutai® and that documents nos. 19 to 24 in the Document Table bear the
identical signature of Mr. Ishak in his capacity as Governor of East
Kalimantan.

1.1. Method employed to forge the documents

For Indonesia, the signatures in documents nos. 1-32 in the Document
Table were produced “by a piece of very sophisticated technology, most
probably an autopen device”.®* Indonesia’s expert, Mr. Epstein, confirmed in
his reports and at the hearing that Messrs. Ishak, Noor and Setiawan did not
sign the disputed documents and that their signatures had been affixed with
a so-called “autopen”.”° An autopen uses a master signature that is
programed through a smart card or flash drive so as to produce identical
signatures in ink.7!

Indonesia notes that the Claimants admit that the disputed documents were
not signed by hand and that identical signatures were reproduced within
certain sets of documents.7 It notes that the Claimants’ expert, Dr. Strach,

The Respondent indicates that the 8 Mining Licenses contain 39 forged signatures, all
of which were generated by the same master signature. Tr. (Day 1), 28:17-19

accepted that autopen technology could be an explanation, although he was
more inclined to admit that a high quality stamping or printing technology
produced the signatures, he was unable to identify any technology that
could achieve such high quality stamp impressions.” In contrast to Mr.
Epstein, who has extensive experience with autopen technology, consulted
with senior personnel of the Autopen Company, and acknowledged that the
signatures might have been produced by a different technology, Indonesia
emphasizes that Dr. Strach has close to no experience with autopen
technology and only inferred from some dots and fine marks on the PT RTM
and PT RTP Survey Licenses (documents nos. 1 and 2 in the Document
Table) that all other signatures could not have been produced by autopen
technology. Mr. Epstein, so states Indonesia, explained that the dots and
fine marks were more likely the cause of a malfunction of the autopen.” In
any event, Indonesia emphasizes that both experts “agree that the re-
produced signatures were of a very high quality, which could not be
achieved by typical stamps”.’5

The Respondent further observes that the two Gunter Documents
(documents nos. 33-34 in the Document Table) contain identical signatures
of Mr. Ishak from the PT RP license of 12 February 2007.76 Both experts
confirmed that the signatures were affixed on the second version of the PT
RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses by using a “relatively unsophisticated
‘copy and paste’ method”.’” This leads Indonesia to conclude that this
“leaves little doubt that someone associated with Ridlatama, or someone

who had access to that unique license, had a hand in the forgery”.

For Indonesia, the fact that the disputed documents were not signed by
hand is “very strong evidence” that forgery occurred, notably because both
the Respondent's and the Claimants’ witnesses testified at the hearing that
mining licenses are signed by hand only.’? Mr. Gunter, a witness presented

by the Claimants, confirmed that the signature was the “last bastion of
power”, further stating that using digital signatures would be “dangerous”,
and concluding that “[i]t should have been all original signatures” .®° Similarly,
Mr. Benjamin, another of the Claimants’ witnesses, confessed that he was
not aware that the disputed signatures were not handwritten and that he
would have been concerned if he had known this to be the case.*!

Indonesia submits that the Claimants failed to provide any evidence
supporting their contention that Mr. Ishak did not always follow the practice
of signing official documents by hand.® In particular, the identical signatures
on the licenses of PT Swasembada Bara and PT Swasembada Energi dated
9 April 2008 are unhelpful, since these two companies are also controlled by
Mr. Mudjiantoro and other Ridlatama principals, thus reinforcing the
conclusion that Ridlatama is involved in the forgery.® In addition, Dr. Strach
was unable to identify any other identical signatures of Mr. Ishak (2849 pair
comparisons) or Mr. Noor (297 pair comparisons).®*

As to the “clerical errors” identified by the Claimants on the documents
produced by the Respondent for purposes of comparison, these are mere
typographical errors or results of an imperfect filing system, they do not
compare to the “grave defects” found in the disputed documents, in
particular the mining licenses.®°

1.2. Elements of forgery identified by Indonesia’s experts and
witnesses

Indonesia points to the following irregularities on the disputed documents
that support its claim that they were forged or fabricated.

a) Survey Licenses

As a general matter, Indonesia relies on Mr. Epstein’s expertise to argue
that Mr. Ishak’s signature on all disputed Survey Licenses was not
handwritten, but the product of autopen technology. In addition, Mr. Epstein
found that a master signature was used to produce documents 1 to 18 in the
Document Table. Finally, Indonesia submits that the PT RTM and PT RTP
Survey Licenses (document nos, 1 and 2 in the Document Table) contain
special features not otherwise present on documents 3 to 18 in the
Document Table. More specifically, Indonesia points to the following
irregularities with respect to each specific license.

(i) PT RTM Survey License

According to Indonesia, the protuberances, angular features, voids, width
variations, small spots and dots, smudge marks and faint marks are the
result of a malfunction of the autopen device.* In fact, the Claimants and
Dr. Strach fail to explain why these features reoccur in the same position,
whereas the marks associated with the stamp impressions vary. %”
Furthermore, the maps appear to have been produced by a “trickster”,®®
since they contain the following defects:*9 (i) the inset in the legend showing
the message “I Lover You” and “Oh yes/no”, % (ii) the map lacks
Mr. Ordiansyab’s initials, (iii) latitudinal and longitudinal numbers are only on
two sides instead of all four sides, in addition to being in the incorrect
numerical order,®' and (iv) the legend does not define “HP” (hutan produksi
or production forest).

Additional anomalies highlighted by Indonesia include: the draft decree was
issued on the same date as the license;%* the map attached to the draft
decree was not issued by the Planology Office (no longitudinal and
latitudinal graticules;9° Mr. Putra’s instead of Mr. Ordiansyah’s initials) and

differs from the map in the license;* the license and draft decree are based
on a 20 March 2007 application, but the records only contain a 23 February
2007 application; the area in the application is different from the area
granted in the license; and Mr. Kurniawan’s list contains no application
dated 20 March 2007.”

Indonesia also highlights that Mr. Ishak testified that he did not sign the
license and that the Regency never used an autopen, % which
Messrs. Armin, Ramadani and Ordiansyah confirmed. Mr. Armin testified
that the archives of the Mining and Energy Bureau contain no originals or
copies of the disputed license.°® Messrs. Ordiansyah and Ramadani further
confirmed that the Planology Office did not issue the map, and that the map
is not in the standard format for 2007 maps, and was never registered in the
SIG database. '°

(ii) PT RTP Survey License

Indonesia raises the same concerns about the PT RTP license as for the PT
RTM license, save for the following: (i) the map depicts a white area in the
south of the PT RTP block, although it is actually in a production forest;'°
and (ii) the map was designed by a certain Chand, and Mr. Gunter
conceded that it was generated by GMT.1°

(iii) PT INP Survey License

Indonesia observes that the PT INP license (i) is not registered in the
Regency’s registration book; '% (ii) the document number belongs to a
document issued in June 2007;'% (iii) the map attached was generated by

(vi) the map shows no forestry area; (v) the map’s inset covers all of East
Kalimantan when it should only cover the Regency of East Kutai; (vii) the
map is not properly oriented; (viii) the map was taken from PT INP’s
application; and (ix) the map legend contains a word in English.

(iv) PT IR Survey License

Indonesia has the same observations on the PT IR license as those raised
in connection with the PT INP license.1°°

b) Exploration Licenses

In general, Indonesia contends that the signatures on the disputed
Exploration Licenses were not freely handwritten and were affixed by using
autopen technology. More specifically, the Respondent raises the following
concerns:

(i) PT RTP Exploration License

The decree number does not comply with the official format for 2008
decrees, since it should be located in the middle, not at the beginning of the
document number, as other entries in the 2008 registration book show."'° In
addition, the document number belongs to a different document." Finally,
the “Having in Mind” section contains various irregularities, such as multiple
references to the same regulations, wrong names and years of
regulations."'2

With respect to the attached maps, they bear none of the characteristics of
official Regency maps, since (i) there are three maps instead of one; (ii) they
were compiled by “ADH” on 11 June 2007 and are copyrighted; (iii) they
show no forestry area; (iv) the legends are in English instead of Bahasa;

(iv) they do not contain Mr. Ordiansyah’s initials; (v) the Regent's signature
is outside the maps instead of inside the legend column; (vi) the graticules
are only on two instead of four sides; (vii) the maps are not properly
oriented; (viii) they contain insets whereas official maps of 2008 do not have
such insets; and (ix) the maps are scaled 1:50,000 instead of 1:250,000.1'2

(ii) PT RTM Exploration License

Indonesia makes the same comments on the PT RTM Exploration License
as those for the PT RTP Exploration License. In addition, it notes that the
decree number is the same as the one used for the April 2008 legality
explanation letter for PT RTM (document no. 12 in the Document Table).

(iii) PT INP Exploration License

The Respondent makes the same contentions about the PT INP license as
for the PT RTP and PT RTM licenses. With respect to the maps, it points out
that (i) there are two maps instead of one; (ii) the situation map is identical to
the one attached to PT INP’s application for general survey; and (iii) the
maps were compiled on 22 February 2008.

(iv) PT IR Exploration License

Indonesia puts forward the same concerns for the PT IR license as for the
PT RTP, PT RTM and PT INP licenses. With respect to the maps, Indonesia
states that the situation map is identical to the map attached to PT IR’s
application for general survey.

c) Payment Requests

Indonesia essentially claims that the signatures of Mr. Ishak were not freely
handwritten on the payment letters (documents nos. 5-6 in the Document
Table) and that they were produced using an autopen.''* Mr. Epstein
confirmed that the signature of Mr. Ishak stems from the same model as the
one in documents 1 to 18 in the Document Table.

The Respondent also emphasizes that Mr. Ishak gave evidence that he
never issued requests for payment of dead rents or seriousness bonds."'5

d) Cooperation and Legality Letters

Indonesia submits that Mr. Ishak did not sign the Cooperation and Legality
Letters (documents nos. 7-14 in the Document Table) by hand and that the
signature was produced by an autopen. It also insists that Mr. Ishak testified
that he had no knowledge of PT ICD or the Claimants at the time, and that
he was unaware of their cooperation with Ridlatama.''¢ Mr. Armin confirmed
that the Regency never issued Legality Letters, and that the Regency’s
archives contain no original or copy of these letters.''7 In addition, the
Respondent notes the following anomalies on these letters: (i) the decree
numbers are the same as the corresponding numbers of the disputed
Exploration Licenses; (ii) the decree numbers are not in the format of official
2008 decrees, since they should be placed in the middle and not at the
beginning.""®

e) Borrow-for-Use Recommendations

The Respondent further argues that the two sets of Borrow-for-Use
Recommendations are forged (documents nos. 19-24 in the Document
Table). Indonesia points to the fact that the 29 December 2009 and 11
March 2010 letters are essentially identical as to their content, that Mr.
Ishak’s signatures are identical and were produced using an autopen, and
that Mr. Ishak testified that he did not sign or authorize these documents.''9
In this context, Mr. Epstein clarified that Mr. Ishak’s signature is a different
master signature than the one used for documents nos. 1 to 18 in the
Document Table and that this second master signature was used to produce
his signatures on documents nos. 19 to 24 in the Document Table.

f) Technical Considerations

The Respondent further challenges the authenticity of four Technical
Considerations of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources (“MEMR’”)
dated 22 September 2010 (documents nos. 29-32 in the Document Table). It
relies on the following evidence to substantiate its position. The
Respondent's expert, Mr. Epstein, confirmed that Mr. Setiawan’s signature

Ishak WS1, 20.
Armin WS, § 26.

Ramadani WS, Annex.

Ishak WS1, 4 15; Epstein ER2.

37

138.

was affixed using an autopen.'?° He further testified that Mr. Setiawan’s
signatures on all the disputed technical consideration letters are identical
and were produced with the same master signature. Mr. Setiawan also gave
evidence that he did not recall signing these letters, but that he signed all
letters by hand.'2' Similarly, Mr. Djalil confirmed that Mr. Setiawan always
signed his letters by hand and that the MEMR does not use autopen
devices. Both Mr. Setiawan and Mr. Djalil further pointed to various oddities
in the Technical Considerations confirming that they were forged, such as
the use of an incorrect NIP, incorrect initials and an incorrect stamp.

g) Re-Enactment Decrees

According to the Respondent, the Re-Enactment Decrees dated 14 May
2010 were also forged (documents nos. 25-28 in the Document Table).
Indonesia contends that, in contrast to the revocation decrees dated 4 May
2010 containing Mr. Noor’s handwritten signature (the “Revocation
Decrees”),' the signature of Mr. Noor on the Re-Enactment Decrees was
not freely handwritten and was produced with an autopen. Mr. Epstein
confirmed that Mr. Noor’s signature was identical on all disputed documents,
since a master signature was employed. Mr. Epstein indicated that the small
dot appearing below the signature is “probably an ink spot on the master’”.123
Mr. Noor indicated in his witness statement that he did not sign or authorize
these documents,'** and that he always signs official documents by hand.'25

1.3. The use of Mr. Ishak’s signature was not authorized

It is the Respondent's submission that, since it is undisputed that the
signatures on the impugned documents were not signed by hand but applied
mechanically, the question boils down to whether these mechanical
signatures were authorized or not. For Indonesia, the evidence establishes
that Mr. Ishak did not authorize the placement of his signature on the
disputed documents (documents nos. 1 to 18 in the Document Table). 126
When Mr. Ishak was away, Mr. Noor would sign for him, but in his capacity
as Deputy Regent, not with Mr. Ishak’s name.'?” According to Indonesia, the
following elements corroborate this conclusion.

a) Numerous irregularities in the Licenses

In addition to the testimony of Mr. Ishak stating that he did not sign or
authorize the Survey and Exploration Licenses, Indonesia points to a series
of “glaring indicia” corroborating its case: (i) the insets on the maps attached
to the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses contain the inscriptions
“| Lover You” and “Oh Yes/no” in addition to other “nonsensical” words in
Indonesian such as “Del. Guablik Benga” and “Nganyuk’; (ii) the maps of the
PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses were copied and pasted from the
applications and their legends are in English; (iii) the Exploration Licenses
contain three copyrighted maps compiled by ADH and the maps are in
portrait instead of landscape format; and (iv) none of the maps contain
latitudinal and longitudinal numbers on all four sides.'28

b) Application process

Messrs. Ordiansyah and Armin gave evidence that they did not process the
PT RTM and PT RTP general survey applications, so insists Indonesia,
since they overlapped with Nusantara Wahau Coal (“NWC’) and Kaltim
Nusantara Coal (“KNC”) Exploration Licenses.'29

The Respondent also emphasizes that the spatial analyses contained in the
Gunter Documents (documents nos. 33-34 in the Document Table) show

145.

that NWC and KNC held valid exploration licenses, as indicated by the
abbreviation “Eks.”, which means eksplorasi and not “Ex” (i.e. former) as
suggested by the Claimants.'2°

Further, according to the Respondent, the 26 February 2007 Staff Analysis
is unreliable and does not support the contention that the areas applied for
by PT RTM and PT RTP were open and available. Most importantly, it refers
to the MEMR letter of 23 March 2007 which postdates the staff analysis,
suggesting that it was backdated. Mr. Ishak denied ever seeing it, it does not
contain any disposisi (orders/directions), and it is inconsistent with
Mr. Putra’s staff analysis of 19 May 2008 where Nusantara’s application was
deemed timely."3"

As for the 23 March 2007 MEMR letter, so adds the Respondent, it only
states that the concession areas would become open if Nusantara’s
concessions had expired and no extension had been requested, but it does
not say that the areas were open, a point conceded by Mr. Quinlivan at the
hearing.'%2

With respect to the draft decrees (Exh. C-383 and Exh. C-384), Indonesia
questions their authenticity for various reasons: (i) it is unclear how
Mr. Kurniawan obtained these documents; (ii) since they were issued on the
same date as the original decrees, it is unclear why Mr. Wirmantono
obtained these draft decrees if the purpose was to reassure him that the
process was progressing well; (iii) Mr. Armin testified that he did not prepare
the draft decrees, and Mr. Ordiansyah testified that the maps were not
issued or approved by the Planology Office; and (iv) Mr. Benjamin had no
knowledge of the draft decrees.’ Ultimately, the draft decrees do not prove
that Mr. Ishak authorized his signature to be placed on the PT RTM and PT
RTP licenses, since it was within Mr. Ishak’s discretion to sign or not, as
Mr. Quinlivan acknowledged.'% Mr. Ishak actually explained that he checked
whether Nusantara still had valid licenses, and “that is why perhaps | did not

sign the letter, because there was something there at the time that had not
been fulfilled, and | think — I'm certain it was that”."95

c) Maps attached to the Mining Licenses

According to Indonesia, maps issued by the Planology Office contain
handwritten signatures of the Regent. None of the maps attached to the
disputed licenses were signed by the Regent, as they contain the same
identical signature as on the other disputed documents. Other elements
prove that the maps were not issued by the Planology Office: (i) the PT RTP
Survey License map was designed by someone called “Chand”; (ii) the PT
INP and PT IR Survey License maps were copied and pasted from the
applications; (iii) Mr. Gunter confirmed that the Exploration License maps
were compiled by GMT and should not have been part of the official
licenses; (iv) the PT RTM and PT RTP map insets “I Lover You” and “Oh
Yes/no” are nonsensical;'%* (v) the PT INP and PT IR maps are upside
down; (vi) the PT INP and PT IR Survey License maps contain English text;
and (vii) the Exploration Licenses contain three types of maps prepared by
GMT instead of one map prepared by the Planology Office. In addition,
these peculiarities are unique to Ridlatama licenses and appear nowhere
else.197

d) Documents not registered

It is the Respondent's further submission that, save for the PT RTM and PT
RTP Survey Licenses, none of the disputed documents issued by the
Regency was properly registered, in addition to bearing decree numbers
assigned to other unrelated decrees.'%* With regard to the registration of the
PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, Mr. Ramadani testified that Mr.
Putra instructed the registrar to register them, promising her to provide the
originals, which he never did.'99 In the end, so writes the Respondent,

“[rlegistration of fictitious or falsified documents does not make them
authentic”,'4° but demonstrates “the extent and reach of the scheme”.'41

e) No handover ceremonies

For Indonesia, Mr. Quinlivan’s reliance on official ceremonies to deliver the
licenses was shown to be wrong at the hearing, Mr. Ishak denying ever
presiding over such ceremonies, a point that Mr. Kurniawan confirmed.
Mr. Quinlivan conceded that, if Mr. Mazak’s account of handover
ceremonies was untrue, then it could be possible that the licenses were
invalid after all.'42

1.4. Other circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Claimants was
created to establish a record of legitimacy
To support its case of a massive fraud scheme, Indonesia further argues
that Ridlatama produced and sought to obtain from various agencies a
series of documents so as to establish a record of legitimacy. Indonesia
points to the following elements: (i) the MEMR maps do not prove the
authenticity of the disputed mining licenses, and MEMR has no authority to
issue licenses;'* (ii) the acknowledgements on Ridlatama’s courier slips
only confirm receipt of documents sent by Ridlatama, but do not show that
the licenses were valid; ‘44 (iii) as Mr. Gunter testified, the dead rent
payments were insignificant and the seriousness bonds hardly ever paid;
(iv) as Mr. Armin confirmed, the MEMR checklist of April 2009 provides no
support for the valid registration of the purported licenses at the Regency,
since the MEMR officer's function was limited to checking documents

received by Ridlatama; ‘4° (v) the 2009 police investigation dealt with
trespass, not forgery, and, in any event, was conducted without knowledge
of the existence of duplicate PT RTM and PT RTP licenses (Gunter
Documents); '4”7 (vi) the Bawasda team did not conduct forensic
examinations and was generally unaware of the Gunter Documents as well
as other forged documents;'* (vii) legal advice from Sondong, Tampubolon
& Partners (“STP”), the “illustrative map” from Mr. Soehandjono, and the due
diligence report of DNC do not constitute evidence as to the authenticity of
the licenses since all the lawyers assumed the authenticity of the licenses;"49
(viii) Churchill's press releases have no bearing on whether Mr. Ishak
authorized the issuance of the disputed documents; and (ix) the process of
upgrades to exploitation licenses was not properly followed. "°°

1.5. The Claimants failed to prove that the ancillary documents are
authentic

Indonesia also highlights that the Claimants failed to address at the hearing
the authenticity of the so-called ancillary documents (i.e., 2007 Payment
Letters (documents nos. 5-6 in the Document Table), 2008 Legality Letters
(documents nos. 11-14 in the Document Table), and Cooperation Letters
(documents nos. 7-10 in the Document Table)) and admitted that a finding
that these documents were forged would support a finding that the licenses
were equally forged.'5"

To substantiate its contention that the ancillary documents were forged,
Indonesia points to the following elements: (i) Mr. Ishak gave evidence that
he did not sign them or authorize their issuance; (ii) none of the documents
was registered in the Regency Registration Books of Decrees and none
contains a unique number; (iii) Mr. Ishak testified that he never issued

payment or legality explanation letters; and (iv) these documents were
created by Ridlatama to appease the Claimants."

1.6. The Borrow-for-Use related documents were also forged

The Respondent further asserts that the Claimants also failed to address the
authenticity of the Borrow-for-Use related documents (i.e., 2009
Recommendation Letters (documents nos. 19-20 in the Document Table),
March 2010 Recommendation Letters (documents nos. 21-24 in the
Document Table), and September 2010 Technical Considerations
(documents nos. 28-31 in the Document Table)) and instead requested the
Tribunal to defer its decision on that issue. Indonesia recalls that these
documents “bear the same high quality reproductions of an official's
signature and other indicia of forgery”.'5%

According to Indonesia, the following elements support its contention: (i)
Messrs. Ishak and Setiawan testified that they did not sign or authorize
these documents; (ii) the two sets of Recommendation Letters are
“essentially identical’; (iii) the letter numbers on the Technical
Considerations belong to other documents issued by Mr. Setiawan; (iv) they
also contain the incorrect NIP of Mr. Setiawan; (v) they use the wrong font
and an incorrect stamp; (vi) they should contain either a signature and
stamp or a signature and initial, but not all three; (vii) Mr. Setiawan did not
recognize the initials; and (viii) the summaries of activities are identical when
they should relate to activities in separate blocks. '**

1.7. The Re-Enactment Decrees are not authentic

The Respondent insists on what it calls the Claimants’ “change of heart”
about the Re-Enactment Decrees when they stated at the end of the hearing
that they “don’t have a position either way’.'° According to Indonesia, the
Claimants provided no evidence of protest by Ridlatama or themselves
against the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses on 4 May 2010 and failed
to explain the need for local proceedings to revoke the Revocation Decrees,

if the licenses had been re-enacted.'®* Even if Mr. Noor’s testimony is
discarded, the identical signatures and Mr. Ramadani’s testimony that the
Legal Section did not draft the decrees are “strong evidence of forgery”. In
addition, the decrees were never registered and show decree numbers that
belong to other decrees. Finally, Indonesia argues that the Claimants had a
clear motive to generate the Re-Enactment Decrees in order to avoid public
disclosure of the license revocations and having to offer security. 157

1.8. Ridlatama is responsible for the forgery and Mr. Mazak was
aware of the scheme

For the Respondent, Ridlatama had the “means, motive and opportunity” to
forge the disputed documents. '®* Mr. Ishak testified that Ridlatama was
responsible for the forgery, which is corroborated by further evidence in the
record, including the two versions of PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, irregular
maps, the ancillary and forestry-related documents, and the Re-Enactment
Decrees. 1° In addition, Indonesia notes the following factors: (i) the
Claimants never contested that only Ridlatama could copy and paste
Mr. Ishak’s signature from the original PT RP license onto the Gunter
documents; (ii) Ridlatama was responsible for obtaining the relevant
permits, and Mr. Kurniawan’s testimony showed that he played a much
smaller role than Messrs. Mudjiantoro and Wirmantono who were not
presented as witnesses; (iii) Ridlatama lied about its control over the
Swasembada companies, PT Swasembada Energy and PT Swasembada
Bara, whose licenses bear the “same non-handwritten signature of
Mr. Ishak”; and (iv) Ridlatama had strong economic motive to secure the
licenses since it stood to gain more than USD 2 million.1©

Indonesia further accuses Mr. Mazak of being aware of Ridlatama’s
forgeries. In particular, Mr. Mazak (i) gave Mr. Gunter the PT RTM and PT
RTP licenses containing the copy and paste signature of Mr. Ishak taken
from the PT RP license; (ii) gave Ridlatama documents to Mr. Benjamin
without the “copy and paste licenses”; (iii) told Mr. Quinlivan of fictitious
handover ceremonies; (iv) sought STP advice on the bona fides of the

licenses; (v) failed to ensure that the licenses were attached to the
Cooperation Agreements; (vi) proposed the idea of seeking re-enactment
decrees; (vii) re-emerged in April 2015 to arrange for Mr. Kurniawan to
testify at the hearing and retrieve Ridlatama documents;'*' and (viii) stood

proved a disappointment. '? For the Respondent, these “damning”
revelations refute the Claimants’ assertions of good faith and reinforce the
argument that a finding of forgery would require the complete dismissal of
the case, since it would bar the Claimants from relying on “theories of

estoppel, acquiescence and the like”.

2. On the law
2.1. Burden and standard of proof

For Indonesia, the Claimants bear the initial burden of proving the existence
of an investment, including demonstrating the authenticity of the mining
licenses. '** Thus, the Claimants must “establish that the foundational
evidence supporting their claims [...] inspires at least a ‘minimally sufficient
degree of confidence in its authenticity”."® In view of the “glaring indicia” of
forgery and the numerous irregularities, the Claimants have failed to make a
prima facie case that the disputed licenses are authentic.'6

But even if it were to bear the burden of proving that the disputed
documents were forged, the Respondent submits that it produced “sufficient
evidence” to support its claims.'®7 Therefore, as case law confirms, the
burden falls once again on the Claimants “to adduce evidence rebutting

these allegations”.

Instead of being “pinned down” by “rigid expressions of the standard of
proof’, Indonesia invites the Tribunal to exercise its discretion to determine
the weight and probative force of the substantial body of evidence in the
record.'® In the end, Indonesia submits that under international law the
prevailing standard is flexible, requiring Indonesia only to demonstrate its
allegations by the “balance of probabilities” or the “preponderance of the
evidence”.'7° Accordingly, the application of a heightened standard of “clear
and convincing evidence” for the forgery allegations would not preserve due
process and equal treatment and is rightly opposed in arbitral case law.17!
But whatever test may apply, Indonesia submits that the “evidence as a
whole points directly to Ridlatama as the only party with the means, motive
and opportunity to forge the impugned documents”. '7? Contrary to the
Claimants’ assertion that Indonesia must prove intent to defraud, the latter
submits that it bears no such burden and that the use of copy and paste
signatures and of an autopen is in itself “evidence of an intent to mislead
and defraud”.173

2.2. The Claimants’ theories on authorization must be rejected

According to Indonesia, the Claimants’ good and bad faith authorization
theories are “implausible and unsubstantiated”. First, while their good faith

theory might serve to explain the issuance of the disputed documents
allegedly issued by Messrs. Ishak and Setiawan, they are of no assistance
with respect to the Re-Enactment Decrees. ‘7° Second, the Claimants’
contention that Mr. Ishak authorized the reproduction of his signature is
contradicted by the evidence, namely (i) witness testimony and comparator
documents show that decrees are always signed by hand, (ii) Mr. Ishak
testified that Mr. Noor was only authorized to sign documents in Mr. Noor’s
own name while Mr. Ishak was away, and (iii) witnesses confirmed that no
high quality stamps or autopen devices are used in the Regency apart from
the fact that the Claimants were unable to identify a high quality stamp
device being able to reproduce the signatures.'”6 Third, witness evidence
and comparator documents also showed that the MEMR did not have
mechanical devices to reproduce signatures.'7”

 

161. Indonesia further contends that nothing supports the Claimants’ bad faith
authorization theory, which effectively requires the Tribunal to “find that an
unidentified person at the Regency acquired an unidentifiable stamping
device to ‘subtly’ forge Ridlatama’s licenses and other documents so that
Ridlatama’s licenses could be revoked and the rights to the EKCP auctioned
to Nusantara or another party”.'78 Further, with respect to the Re-Enactment
Decrees, the Claimants’ theory is “rife with speculation”. Indonesia also
notes the evolution in the Claimants’ argumentation “moving from silence to
‘bemusement’ to ‘confusion’ to ‘no position’ and now to ‘bad faith
authorization”. 79 It finds that their theory is “inherently incredible”,
considering that (i) the revocations had been recommended by the Minister
of Forestry; (ii) internal procedures to revoke the Exploitation Licenses had
been followed; and (iii) Ridlatama initiated court proceedings to challenge
the revocations. 18°

2.3. A finding of forgery requires the dismissal of the claims

Since all of the claims rest on the assumption of the validity of Ridlatama’s
rights, a finding of forgery of the Survey and Exploration Licenses would
render the exploitation upgrades “null and void” and require that the claims
be dismissed. '*' In addition, Mr. Mazak’s “culpability” and the Claimants’
failure to conduct proper due diligence precludes the Claimants from
invoking alternative legal theories such as estoppel or acquiescence.

The claims in this arbitration relate to Churchill and Planet's purported
investment in the EKCP. As Mr. Quinlivan acknowledged, without valid
licenses there is no EKCP.'% While the Claimants argue that “the vast
majority” of their investments would remain legally valid notwithstanding a
finding of forgery, Indonesia argues that the Claimants have identified no
claim unrelated to the EKCP:

(i) | With respect to the claim for indirect expropriation, the Claimants
concede that the licenses were the only assets of value for PT ICD
and PT TCUP. A finding of forgery would render the licenses and thus
the companies worthless. Relying on case law, Indonesia submits that
no claim based on worthless interests may succeed;'83

(ii) | With respect to the claim that the Nusantara extensions were unlawful,
Indonesia argues that the extension of Nusantara’s licenses was valid
since Ridlatama had no rights over the area;'8*

(iii) With respect to the claim that Indonesia wrongfully engendered doubt
about license overlaps and forgery, Indonesia reiterates that the
Nusantara extensions were valid and that the Claimants acknowledge
that this claim would fall away if forgery is made out to have
occurred;18

(iv) With respect to the claim that forestry permits were wrongfully
declined, Indonesia responds that Ridlatama had no mining rights to
begin with;'26

(v) With respect to the claim of unreasonable, arbitrary and unjustified
measures, Indonesia retorts that the measures were related to mining
operations lacking valid licenses;'®”

(vi) With respect to the claim of threat of use of force, Indonesia responds
that it was proper to require Ridlatama to leave the mining area, since
the mining undertaking licenses were forged and Indonesia properly
revoked the upgrades;'88

(vii) With respect to the denial of justice claim, Indonesia argues that the
claim arises from the alleged failure to take into account evidence, and
thus would fail with a finding of forgery.1®°

According to Indonesia, the Claimants’ argument that their claims would
survive since the licenses were revoked for breaches of forestry law, not
forgery, fails since (i) forgery informed the decision to revoke the licenses,
and (ii) revocation for a different reason is no reason why forgery would not
lead to the dismissal of the claims.'*° Allowing the claims to proceed would
reward blatantly illegal conduct and would be contrary to international law,
Indonesian law or any other system of law, as well as international public
policy. '*' To avoid serious damage being done to the administration of
justice, the Tribunal should not allow an investment tainted with forgery to
form the basis of its decision.

2.4. The exploitation upgrades are null and void

According to Indonesia, since the Survey and Exploration Licenses were
forged, they are “non-existent”, which renders the exploitation upgrades
invalid.'%° Therefore, “the Regent's approval for upgrading of fake licenses to
exploitation status in 2009 could not cure the fundamental defect caused or
created by forgery of the original licenses’.'% This conclusion is supported

both by Indonesian and international law.'® While Mr. Noor testified that he
did sign the Exploitation Licenses, he did so on the assumption that all
proper steps had been taken by the Mining and Energy Bureau.'% In other
words, Mr. Noor was deceived into signing the exploitation upgrades. In
addition, since Ridlatama had no licenses capable of being upgraded to
begin with, Indonesia submits that Mr. Noor had “no power to issue the
upgrades”.197

Mr. Noor’s disposisi on the exploitation upgrade applications instructed
Mr. Putra to process the applications “in accordance with the prevailing
procedures”.'°8 Mr. Putra did not do so, according to Indonesia, indicating
that “something very serious went awry” in the process and that corruption
might be involved.'%° As regards the process, the Respondent emphasizes
the following discrepancies: 7° (i) Ridlatama submitted two sets of
applications (the first requesting upgrades for all areas and the second only
for a more limited area); (ii) the licenses referred to the second application,
but applied to the area requested in the first application; (iii) Mr. Noor’s
approval created an overlap with extant Nusantara exploration licenses; (iv)
the upgrades contain unusual (and inaccurate) language with respect to
forestry areas; (v) the maps were not issued by the Planology Office, which
is evidenced by the absence of Mr. Ordiansyah’s initials, the graticules only
on two sides, the wrong orientation, and the resemblance with those
generated by GMT; (vi) the upgrades “were picked up by a Regency
employee outside the Mining and Energy Bureau”; 2’ and (vii) the
attendance sheet for the Ridlatama feasibility study presentation “was dated
in a manner to suggest that it occurred prior to, rather than after, issuance of
the upgraded licenses”.202

2.5. The Claimants’ legal theories must be rejected

None of the Claimants’ theories to continue asserting claims have any merit.
These theories are: (i) estoppel, (ii) acquiescence, (iii) fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”), including legitimate expectations, (iv) unjust enrichment,
and (v) internationally wrongful composite act. As a general matter, the
Claimants’ lack of good faith, their awareness of the risks of corruption, their
willful disregard of corruption, and their continued endorsement of
Ridlatama’s probity precludes them to rely on estoppel, legitimate
expectations, acquiescence and other theories.” Finally, while there is “little
doubt” that Ridlatama had assistance from Mr. Putra, that would still not
change the ultimate conclusion that all of the claims must be dismissed,
because forged documents cannot form the basis of investment treaty
claims as this would be contrary to international law and international public
policy.2°* Moreover, the Claimants were not good faith investors, Ridlatama
could in any event not convey valid investment interests on them, and
through their beneficial ownership arrangements the Claimants stepped into
Ridlatama’s shoes and were the “beneficiaries of the forgery”.2°°

a) — Estoppel

The Claimants failed to meet the three criteria of estoppel, so says the
Respondent, namely (i) there were no clear and unambiguous
representations that the licenses were valid, and silence is not sufficient;
(ii) any representations were induced by error and the relevant officials were
not authorized to speak for the State; and (iii) the Claimants’ lack of due
diligence defeats their claim that they relied in good faith and to their
detriment on the alleged representations.2%°

The hearing, and in particular Messrs. Quinlivan’s and Benjamin's
testimonies, showed that the Claimants relied on  Ridlatama’s
representations, not those of the State.2°7 Finally, Mr. Mazak’s handling of
duplicate PT RTM and PT RTP licenses as well as his misrepresentations

regarding handover ceremonies “are sufficient by themselves to bar the
Claimants from invoking estoppel”.2°8

b) | Acquiescence

According to Indonesia, the conditions for acquiescence must be interpreted
strictly. Consequently, the State is deemed to have consented to a situation
“if it failed to object in circumstances where it was reasonably expected to
object”.2° Since Indonesia had no knowledge of the facts underlying the
forgery, and its purported consent was obtained by error, there can be no
acquiescence. 719 In any event, Indonesia’s commencement of police
investigations once it became aware of the forgery shows that there was no
“clear and consistent acceptance” to treat the forged licenses as valid.

c) Legitimate expectations

For the Respondent, the Claimants’ legitimate expectations argument fails
for the same reasons as their estoppel argument. Their lack of due diligence
negates any claim based on legitimate expectations.2"'

d) — Unjust enrichment

If the Claimants’ unjust enrichment claim is based on equitable relief
unrelated to any substantive protection in the BITs, so argues Indonesia,
then it falls outside the Tribunal’s competence for lack of ex aequo et bono
jurisdiction.?'2 Attempts to present unjust enrichment as part of the FET
standard must equally fail, since the BITs make no reference to unjust
enrichment, and “the ‘FET standard’ is not an amorphous point of entry for
any equitable remedy that the Claimants may wish to invoke”.?'3 In any
event, the Claimants have not shown that (i) Indonesia was enriched to the
detriment of the Claimants and (ii) there was no just cause for the
enrichment. There was just cause to revoke the mining licenses, namely

breach of forestry laws and forgery of licenses, which defeats any unjust
enrichment claim.?'4

e) Internationally wrongful composite act

The Respondent further submits that the theory on composite violation of
FET brought forward by Churchill and Planet must fail, because the notion of
composite act “is merely concerned with the time at which a breach occurs”,
thus adding nothing to Claimants’ “baseless FET claim’.215

2.6. The Claimants are not good faith investors and failed to exercise
due diligence

It is Indonesia’s primary case that Ridlatama forged the disputed documents
and that the Claimants were duped?"* and that, even if they were unaware of
the forgery, the Claimants bear the burden of engaging business relations
with unreliable partners.?'7 It is Indonesia’s secondary case that Ridlatama
forged the disputed documents and that the Claimants were aware of it. In
this case, the Claimants’ involvement evinces, at the very least, a lack of
due diligence, and, in fact, recklessness.?!8 Although Indonesia argues that
a finding of forgery and the dismissal of the claims does not require proof
that the Claimants were “culpable with Ridlatama’, it also points to the fact
that the Claimants are under investigation at the London Stock Exchange for
failure to disclose the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses.?'2

According to the Respondent, Mr. Mazak’s dissemination of forged
documents and dealings with Ridlatama “are prima facie evidence of
complicity on his part’.2° Until the hearing, Indonesia did not accuse the
Claimants of being involved in the forgery scheme. As a result of the
evidence taken at the hearing, Indonesia raised accusations with respect to
the involvement of Mr. Mazak in the handling of the disputed documents.
The hearing showed, so says Indonesia, that Mr. Gunter obtained the
second version of the Survey Licenses from Mr. Mazak, which raises

54

questions on Mr. Mazak’s role in the forgery. The fact that Mr. Ishak’s
signature from the PT RP license was copied and pasted onto the PT RTM
and PT RTP licenses in Mr. Gunter’s possession shows that the forgers of
the Gunter Documents were either associated with Ridlatama or had access
to that unique license (of PT RP).22"

176. The Respondent further submits that other instances demonstrate the
Claimants’ lack of good faith: (i) Mr. Gunter contradicted the Claimants’
representation that he verified the expiration of the Nusantara licenses; (ii)
Mr. Benjamin admitted he played no part in the Survey License applications
in 2007; (iii) the Claimants failed to include the Survey Licenses as
attachments to the Cooperation Agreements with Ridlatama; (iv) the 26
February 2007 Staff Analysis and the 23 March 2007 MEMR letter were only
received by the Claimants in 2009 or 2010; (v) the Claimants made no
attempt to verify the authenticity of the licenses when forgery allegations
were first raised in 2009; (vi) they failed to obtain relevant assistance to
understand how signatures are placed on mining licenses, despite Messrs.
Gunter and Benjamin having such knowledge; (vii) they also failed to verify
the accuracy of the 2009 report prepared by Ridlatama (and signed by the
Legal Team of PT ICD) to rebut the BPK report, which report did not
address the forgery indications and falsely portrayed the Swasembada
companies as unrelated to Ridlatama.?2 In sum, so argues the Respondent,
the Claimants failed to exercise due diligence to ascertain the soundness of
their investment. For Indonesia, “Mr. Quinlivan and Claimants’ principals no
doubt realized that nothing was to be gained from casting doubt on
Ridlatama’s probity”.223

The Claimants’ Position
1. On the facts

According to the Claimants, Indonesia failed to provide “clear and
convincing evidence” that the disputed documents were forged and
fabricated by Ridlatama, let alone to prove the existence of a “massive,
systematic and sophisticated scheme to defraud” the Respondent.2% For the
Claimants, Indonesia also failed to explain “why the means of signature is
probative of who applied the signatures”, or, in other words, why the
determination of the means of signature would allow concluding that the
signatures were generated by Ridlatama rather than the Regency.?25

1.1. The issuance of the disputed documents was authorized

For the Claimants, the most important issue is not “how” the signatures were
affixed on the disputed documents, nor “who” did so, but whether the

signatures were authorized.

The Claimants start by challenging Indonesia’s characterization of
Mr. Ishak’s testimony. Mr. Ishak did not testify that he did not sign the
documents, but made various odd statements casting doubt on his reliability
as a witness.26 For instance, Mr. Ishak’s statement that he could not have
signed the disputed Survey Licenses because he was not the Regent at the
time is clearly incorrect.” Further, his statement that “something must have
prevented him from signing” the licenses, such as Nusantara’s payment of
taxes and fulfillment of other obligations, was also incorrect since Nusantara
made no payments and fulfilled no obligations until November 2008 when it
obtained extensions of its exploration licenses. 8 Moreover, Indonesia’s
explanation that Mr. Ishak refused to sign as a matter of discretion is
speculative and undermined by Mr. Ishak’s assertion that “[i]f it is completed,
| will sign it’.229 Finally, Indonesia has not been forthcoming on the issue of
authorization and whether Mr. Noor would sign decrees in Mr. Ishak’s
absence. For the Claimants, Mr. Ishak’s testimony “illuminated the

183.

possibility” that Mr. Noor had authority to apply Mr. Ishak’s signature (good
faith authorization), or even that Mr. Noor exceeded his authority (bad faith
authorization).22°

In any event, the Claimants’ main submission is that the signatures were
authorized. Evidence gathered at the hearing establishes that decrees were
signed mechanically as “a matter of administrative necessity and
convenience”, due to Mr. Ishak’s frequent travels during his campaign for
governorship in 2006 to 2008.73"

Mr. Noor was “automatically responsible” when Mr. Ishak was absent,
having the authority to “make and sign decrees”.?? The Claimants dispute
Mr. Ishak’s testimony that Mr. Noor could only sign as Deputy Regent, since
the scope of Mr. Noor’s authority “is not clear’. 23° For the Claimants,
Mr. Noor’s authority increased during Mr. Ishak’s second term as Regent,
ie., during the relevant period and he “clearly had access to original
signatures of Mr. Ishak and all other apparatus needed for the creation and
recording of official documents”. 2% Mr. Noor’s wealth and “apparent
estrangement from Mr. Ishak” would suggest that he exceeded his authority
when personal gain was at stake.

Specifically, the Claimants make the following submissions in relation to
each category of disputed documents:

a) Survey Licenses

The authenticity of the Survey Licenses (documents nos. 1-4 in the
Document Table) is corroborated by the “broadest body of evidence” in the
record, including (i) the 23 March 2007 MEMR letter to PT RTM indicating
that, if Nusantara licenses expired, the area would become open;?* (ii) the

“March 2007256 Staff Analysis concluding that the Nusantara’s licenses had
lapsed and that the mining areas were open;?* (iii) spatial analyses of
21 May 2007 describing Nusantara’s permits as “Eks” (or former) licenses,
confirming the Staff Analysis according to which the areas were open;?38
(iv) the final draft decrees bearing the undisputed coordination initials of
senior Regency officials, none of whom provided evidence in this arbitration,
establishing that the internal approval process “progressed without
challenge to this penultimate stage” and evidencing that the issuance of the
licenses was duly authorized;?89 (v) the Garuda seal on the official licenses,
which, according to Dr. Strach, suggested that the seal was affixed after the
signatures were placed on the licenses;*4° (vi) 79 separate government
acknowledgements of the Survey Licenses;?*! (vii) the MEMR registration of
the Survey Licenses, about which the Claimants explained that the MEMR
relied on its own maps to issue official documents, and that Mr. Ishak
acknowledged the “key role” played by the MEMR, not the Regency, when
determining the status of mining areas.?42

In this context, the Claimants rebut Indonesia’s arguments on procedural
irregularities as follows: (i) the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses were properly
registered in the registration book of the Legal Section; (ii) the PT INP and
PT IR licenses were also registered albeit under an incorrect date, which
appears to be a clerical error also found on other decrees produced by
Indonesia; (iii) Indonesia’s account that Mr. Putra failed to provide the

Claimants explain the discrepancy in the dates by arguing that the Staff Analysis must
have been commenced on 26 February 2007, shortly after receipt of the Ridlatama
applications, but was finalized in March 2007 after the MEMR letter of 23 March 2007.

original licenses is based on “aged hearsay” of Mr. Ramadani, who was not
involved in processing mining licenses until 2012;?49 and (iv) with respect to
the duplicate PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, Mr. Gunter testified that it is not
unusual to have “different generations” of documents and that he saw “a
large variety of different types” of licenses, including internal documents, to
allow applicants to verify the correctness of the mining area coordinates,
which sometimes contained the page with the coordination initials.24

b) Exploration Licenses

An “expansive body of evidence” supports the contention that the
Exploration Licenses (documents nos. 15-18 in the Document Table) were
authorized: 5 (i) the official seal on the licenses; (ii) 16 official
acknowledgements of the existence of the licenses by the Regency and the
MEMR, including Mr. Aspan who had control over the Legal Section
register; 7° (iii) quarterly reports, work plans and budgets were
acknowledged 89 times by local, regional and central government
officials;247 (iv) MEMR maps show Ridlatama’s exploration areas;?#* (v) dead
rent and seriousness bond payments; 9 (vi) government awareness of
ongoing exploration activities, including through site visits and supervision
by officials, including police and army personnel stationed at the site
camp;%°° and (vii) the upgrade to Exploitation Licenses, whereby State
officials at least became aware of the existence of the Exploration
Licenses.?5'

In this context, the Claimants refer to various “key points”, including the
feasibility study presentation on 9 February 2009; the disposisi on the
exploitation applications (including a second disposisi on the PT RTM
application); Mr. Noor’s approval of the feasibility studies; the meeting at the
Regency on 27 March 2009; and the 29 April 2009 meeting for the re-
registration of the licenses under the new mining law which was attended by
Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah. Mr. Armin confirmed that, on that day,
Mr. Ariyadi compiled a checklist of Ridlatama’s documents confirming that
PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP, and PT IR had received general survey and

exploration licenses.252

c) Payment Requests

Various elements support the contention that the Payment Requests
(documents nos. 5-6 in the Document Table) are authentic:?* (i) the official
seals on the letters;?* (ii) the fact that the authenticity of the copy of the
Legal Section register book on record is questionable, since, on the date
when the seriousness bonds were presumably recorded, the register book
shows a large blank space;?* (iii) in any event, no other valid decrees have
been registered; (iv) Indonesia refused to produce the original of the register
book, thus rendering it impossible to know with certainty if the letters were
registered or not; and (v) Indonesia provided no explanation as to the motive
for forging such letters.°¢

d) Cooperation and Legality Letters

The Legality and Cooperation Letters (documents nos. 7-14 in the
Document Table) are not licenses with the result that it is less probable that
there would have been direct evidence of their authorization,?°” which is
compounded by the lack of comparator documents. Nevertheless, the
Claimants note that the disputed documents bear the official seal, and that
the certificates of legality have been acknowledged 38 times by three levels
of government (there is no such acknowledgement of the Cooperation

Letters).25* As to the absence of registration, the Claimants reiterate their
reason to doubt the reliability of the copy of the registration book produced
by Indonesia, further pointing to possible modifications in the entries on
8 and 9 April 2008.259

e) Borrow-for-Use Recommendations

The Claimants stress that the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations
(documents nos. 19-24 in the Document Table) bear the official seal of the
Governor of East Kalimantan.2°° The Claimants provide two explanations for
the identical signatures, namely the good faith authorization (different levels
of government use mechanical devices to reproduce signatures) and the
bad faith authorization (disputed documents are the product of an internal
scam created by the Regency to keep Ridlatama believing that the project
was progressing). 761 With respect to Indonesia’s argument that the
December 2009 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations are “virtually identical”
to the March 2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations,” the Claimants point
to Mr. Benjamin’s explanation that the two sets of recommendations dealt
with different subject matters, the former being for the “use of land above the
surface” and the latter for “the use (or lease) of the land above and below

the surface”.263

f) Technical Considerations

The Claimants also signal that the Technical Considerations (documents
nos. 29-32 in the Document Table) bear MEMR’s official seal.26* As with the
Borrow-for-Use Recommendations, the Claimants provide two explanations
for the identical signatures — good faith and bad faith authorization — and
argue that the Regency had access to a master signature of Mr. Setiawan,
since the Technical Recommendations the latter issued were systematically

copied to the Regency.6° The Claimants also indicate that Dr. Strach is
more inclined to a view that the signatures are the product of high quality
stamp or printing method, rather than an autopen, in particular because of
the “presence of the repeated fine marks”, for which Mr. Epstein provided no
explanation.26

g) Re-Enactment Decrees

The Re-Enactment Decrees (documents nos. 25-28 in the Document Table)
were not orchestrated by Messrs. Mazak and Basrewan?8” and Churchill is
not a fraudster. Circumventing the disclosure of the revocation at the AIM
would be extremely short-sighted, according to the Claimants. The Tribunal
should find that the Re-Enactment Decrees were authorized “but in the bad
faith sense”.26* Indeed, they are the only documents that favor Indonesia's
contention that Mr. Noor was deceived into signing the Exploitation
Licenses.

In addition, the Claimants insist on a number of corroborating elements
which the Tribunal should also keep in mind: (i) the findings of the 2009
Sangatta police investigation which held that the mining licenses had been
properly registered; (ii) the Bawasda report according to which the licenses
were “legal and accountable”; (iii) the draft due diligence report of DNC; (iv)
the review conducted by Mr. Soehandjono; (v) the due diligence of STP
concluding that the licenses were “valid, unencumbered and legally
enforceable”; and (vi) the fact that the licenses were revoked for alleged
breaches of forestry law, not for forgery.?7°

The Claimants further dispute Indonesia’s argument with respect to the
alleged irregularities on the various maps. Indeed, the Respondent failed to
produce a digital database of the Planology Office, despite Mr. Ordiansyah
having acknowledged that hard copies of all maps were kept in various
offices of the Regency. 2" For the Claimants, (i) the absence of

Mr. Ordiansyah’s initials is not peculiar to the disputed licenses, but is a
common “irregularity” in undisputed documents; 2” (ii) Mr. Ordiansyah
described an “ad hoc map-approval process” which indicates that not all
maps were generated by the Planology Office and that “as long as a map
was registered in the Planology Office’s database, it was an official map”;273
(iii) the English expressions in the maps attached to the PT RTM and PT
RTP licenses appear to be the work of high school students having joined
the Planology Office, rather than that of sophisticated fraudsters; and (iv)
other irregularities may be explained by the then “rudimentary systems” of
the Planology Office, as can be seen from the undisputed map attached to
the PT Bara Energi Makmur license which was “issued five months before to
the RTM and RTP general survey licenses”, and which bears no initial of
Mr. Ordiansyah, no legend, no scale, no indication of North, unusual insets,
no source, and no indication of production forests.2”

All the ancillary documents, which the Respondent misleadingly seeks to
discount as “peripheral documents”, are “evidence of process” confirming
that Ridlatama was operating with the “knowledge and consent” of
Indonesia.?”> Churchill and Planet therefore reject Indonesia's attempts to fill
gaps in its case with allegations of more crime either by an insider of the
Regency, or by Ridlatama or Churchill. This is especially true where
Indonesia did not produce any report of its police investigations and thus
puts the Tribunal in the position of being requested to make findings that
Indonesia’s own police have been unable to make.2”6

Finally, the Claimants submit that the clerical errors identified on the
disputed documents show the lack of “cohesive and administrative process”
in the Regency during the relevant period and cannot substantiate a finding
of forgery.277

According to the Claimants, this occurs in 4 out of 20 maps produced by Indonesia for
the years 2007-2008. C-PHB2, § 21(d), note 135. See also: C-Reply, § 139 and Annex

1.2. The copy and paste signatures on the Gunter Documents could
have been generated inside the Regency
The Claimants dispute Indonesia’s contention that only Ridlatama had
access to the original Ishak signature/stamp combinations found on the PT
RP license, which were copied and pasted onto the Gunter Documents
(documents nos. 33-34 in the Document Table). Indeed, Mr. Ordiansyah
testified that the Planology Office made digital copies of final licenses?”° and
other witnesses confirmed that the “group of custodians of the relevant Ishak

master signature” was much larger than portrayed by Indonesia.?72

The Claimants further highlight the contradiction in Indonesia’s case in
connection with the Gunter Documents, which are alleged to be both
“authentic and forged”.28 On the one hand, the Respondent presents the
Gunter Documents as forged and, on the other, it relies on the spatial
analyses which they contain to support the validity of the Nusantara
licenses.

2. Onthe law
2.1. Burden and standard of proof

The Claimants submit that it is for the Respondent to prove its forgery
allegations. In addition, the Claimants argue that the Respondent must
provide “clear and convincing evidence” that the disputed documents were
forged or fabricated by Ridlatama.

If the Tribunal were not minded to draw adverse inferences, it should
dismiss the Application for Dismissal “for lack of evidence”, Indonesia not
having proved its case under either standard: clear and convincing evidence
or balance of probabilities.28!

At the hearing, the Claimants also referred to the standard of “cogent
evidence” employed by the English High Court and referred to international
tribunals, in particular the US-lran Claims Tribunal.?@? In this context, the
Claimants accepted that the documentary record was not perfect, that

certain inconsistencies “cannot be explained”, notably because Indonesia
did not provide relevant evidence. The resulting “ambiguity or doubt” must
be decided against the Respondent, because the evidence as a whole
supports the validity of the disputed documents.?&

2.2. Adverse inferences

The Claimants request the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences with respect
to the documents that the Respondent was ordered but failed to produce?8+
and to Indonesia’s failure to present key witnesses, such as
Messrs. Zainuddin Aspan, Djaja Putra and Isran Noor.285

According to Churchill and Planet, since the Respondent has exclusive
control over the documents which it did not produce, the Tribunal should
adopt a liberal recourse to inferences of fact and circumstantial evidence, as
the ICJ did in Corfu Channel. In addition, out of 333 documents produced
by the Respondent, 251 were Nusantara documents. Further, for
15 categories of documents, the Respondent only produced 45 comparator
documents — out of which 25 related to Nusantara and 12 were already in
the record.?87

Moreover, so emphasize the Claimants, the testimony of the Respondent's
own witnesses confirmed the existence of documents responsive to certain
requests. This is particularly the case of the following 5 (sets of) documents:

i. Mr. Ishak confirmed the existence of the application book of the
Regent of East Kutai;28*

ii. Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed the existence of a hard copy of the maps
depicting forest and mining areas for the relevant time;?8°

iii. | Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that a copy of the digital database of the
Planology Office could be produced;28°

iv. Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that his office had the spatial analyses
created in relation to Ridlatama’s applications;2"

v. Although Indonesia claimed that the four 3 March 2009
Recommendation Letters did not exist, it belatedly produced them on
6 July 2015.292

As a consequence, Churchill and Planet request that adverse inferences be
drawn in respect of the following documents and facts:

i. Regency register books
a. Application book of the Regent: Mr. Ramadani indicated that
applications were registered in that book and Mr. Ishak confirmed its

existence at the hearing.

b. Registration book of the Mining and Energy Bureau: In light of Mr.
Armin’s confirmation of the book’s general nature, the Respondent’s
inability to locate it is “highly improbable”.

c. Legal Section register book: the “low-resolution copy” produced
causes concern that various relevant entries may not be reproduced
faithfully.295
Adverse inference: The production of the books just listed would have
proved (i) the existence of the Survey and Exploration Licenses,
(ii) the regular processing of the Exploitation Licenses and
(iii) Nusantara’s belated applications for extension.294

ii. Comparator mining licenses:

Indonesia only produced 22 documents for the years 2007 and 2008,
although it initially objected to the request as overly burdensome

because it involved some 150 documents per year.7° Of these 22,
only 2 were originals and 6 were Nusantara licenses. Mr. Ordiansyah
confirmed that a digital copy is made of every mining license, putting
to rest Indonesia’s excuse that it could not find hard copies.

Adverse inference: The production would not have assisted
Indonesia’s contention that “the Regent ‘always signed decrees by
hand or that the Ridlatama licenses are irregular in terms of their

form’ .296

ii. | Comparator legality and Cooperation Letters:

Indonesia’s “alternative submission of fact” (i.e., Mr. Ishak never
issued such documents, but if they were issued they would be
immaterial to forgery) is an admission that such letters were issued by
Mr. Ishak.27 In addition, the certificates that Mr. Noor signed by hand
(and which are “in substantially the same form” as the Cooperation
and Legality Letters bearing Mr. Ishak’s signature) further suggest that
the Regency issued such documents.?98

Adverse inference: The production would not support Indonesia’s
position that “such letters are never issued or that the Ridlatama
legality and cooperation letters were forged”.

iv.  Planology Office maps:
Indonesia only produced 18 maps attached to the Nusantara’s
licenses.2° Mr. Ordiansyah admitted that, for each map, three sheets
are produced, °°! that the Planology Office keeps copies of every
map,°? and that the Legal Section and Mining Bureau also keep hard

copies.2°3 He also conceded that a digital copy of the database could
be made.°°*

Adverse inference: The failure to produce existing documents allows
the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences that these maps would not
have assisted Indonesia’s case that “(i) all Planology Office maps
complied with the criteria set out by the State’s witnesses and (ii) that
an inference of forgery can be drawn from any map that does not”.°5

v. MEMR maps:
The significance of the MEMR maps lies in their display of the
evolution of title over the EKCP, showing in particular Ridlatama’s
valid title until 18 May 2010 and the appearance of an overlap with
Nusantara only on 13 October 2010.2 Beyond the maps already in
the record, Indonesia failed to produce any further MEMR maps or
materials generated by the MEMR in relation to the EKCP.%°7

Adverse inference: The production would not have supported the
Respondent's contention that “the Ridlatama licences were never
recognized by the State”.°8

vi.  Ridlatama spatial analyses:
Indonesia misled the Tribunal when stating that the Planology Office
did not write spatial analyses in relation to Ridlatama’s applications.
Mr. Gunter produced spatial analyses for PT RTM and PT RTP
(depicting Nusantara’s exploration permits as “Eks”, i.e. former),3°° and

Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that he prepared and signed them, and that

Adverse inference: Indonesia did not produce responsive documents
because it “considers their content — namely the description of
Nusantara permits as ‘Eks’ (or ‘former’) — is unhelpful to its case”.3"'

Nusantara spatial analyses:

Indonesia failed to produce any responsive documents, although
Mr. Ordiansyah admitted that the Planology Office carried out such an
analysis.

Adverse inference: The production would not have supported
Indonesia’s contention that “the areas for which Nusantara was
applying were not already held by Ridlatama’”.2'2

Police files:

While Indonesia has argued that secrecy governs the investigations of
its national police, it has not provided any documents from other police
agencies, such as the Sangatta police.

Adverse inference: The Tribunal may infer that it has obtained the best
evidence about Ridlatama’s involvement and that the content of the
police files would not support Indonesia’s case of a “massive,
systematic and sophisticated scheme to defraud the Republic”. 3"3
None of the investigations has led to any prosecution of Ridlatama
personnel.

State investigations into Messrs. Ishak and Noor:

The hearing revealed that corruption may have existed at the Regency
during the relevant period.

Adverse inference: The production of the Indonesian Corruption
Eradication Commission (Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi or “KPK”)

(Day 3), 128:7-10, 134:24-135:4 (Direct, Ordiansyah), 171:11-15 (Cross,

files would not have supported “Mr. Ishak’s credibility as a witness on
matters material to the State’s case”.2"4

Moreover, Churchill and Planet seek adverse inferences in relation to
Indonesia’s failure to offer the following witnesses:

i. Mr. Zainuddin Aspan: the hearing showed that Mr. Ramadani (who
worked in the litigation branch of the Legal Section until 2012) was not
involved in processing mining applications during the relevant period,
and that Indonesia should instead have presented the head of the
Legal Section, Mr. Aspan, since he (i) received draft licenses from the
licensing subdivision, (ii) put his coordination initials on the PT RTM
and PT RTP draft decrees, (iii) supervised the circulation of the drafts
to other sections, and (iv) acknowledged Ridlatama’s Exploration
Licenses by signing and stamping them. Had Mr. Aspan been called
as a witness by the Respondent, so say the Claimants, “his evidence
would not have supported the State’s forgery/fraud case”.3'5

ii. Mr. Djaja Putra: Mr. Ishak confirmed Mr. Putra’s central role as head
of the Mining Bureau in handling mining licenses during the relevant
period. Mr. Putra (i) drafted the 2007 Staff Analysis, (ii) co-signed the
PT RTM and PT RTP spatial analyses, (iii) initialed the draft PT RTM
and PT RTP decrees, (iv) drafted the 2008 Nusantara Staff Analysis,
and (v) directly liaised with Mr. Noor. Had Mr. Putra been called as a
witness by the Respondent, so say the Claimants, “his evidence would
not have supported the State’s forgery/fraud case”.3'6

Finally, the Claimants oppose the adverse inferences sought by Indonesia.
They did not present Mr. Mazak as a witness, since they offered the most
appropriate witnesses to respond to Indonesia’s case on authenticity as it
stood prior to the hearing, i.e. that the Claimants were dupes fooled by
Ridlatama, not that they were fraudsters as Indonesia now contends.*"7

2.3. Authorized licenses would prove the validity of all other disputed
documents

For the Claimants, if the Tribunal finds that the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey

Licenses were validly issued, then all other disputed documents bearing the

identical signatures would have been validly issued. This applies to the

Exploration Licenses, the Payment Requests, the Cooperation Letters and

the Legality Letters.3"8

By contrast, the Claimants acknowledge that a finding that the Re-
Enactment Decrees were not authorized would “add weight to the State’s
circumstantial case against the other disputed documents”.*'°

2.4. Good faith and bad faith authorization

It is the Claimants’ main submission that the Regency authorized the
issuance of the disputed documents, in particular of the Mining Licenses.27°
In support, the Claimants rely on two alternative theories, good faith and bad
faith authorization, both of which lead to the conclusion that the disputed
documents were authorized.22"

According to the first theory of good faith authorization, Mr. Ishak’s signature
was regularly applied by one of his subordinates (e.g. Mr. Noor or Mr. Putra)
using a high-quality stamp “or some other printing technology” with
Mr. Ishak’s knowledge and consent.%?2 The “natural progression” of the
application process supports such a finding (i.e., application, staff analysis,
spatial analysis, coordination draft, affixation of the chop, entry in
Registration Book of Decrees). The hearing also showed that Mr. Ishak
authorized his subordinates to “sign official documents on his behalf” when
he was travelling.2

Under the second theory of bad faith authorization, some insider in the
Regency engaged in a “design to make the licences being issued to

Ridlatama ‘plausibly deniable” so as to be able to “illegally revoke” them
later once Ridlatama would have found commercially viable quantities of

coal.°*4 In this scenario, Ridlatama and the Claimants are “victims” and
Indonesia is bound by the licenses it issued.*?5 Churchill and Planet insist in
this context that Indonesia has not established that Ridlatama was aware of
any such scheme.%6

2.5. The Tribunal should reject Indonesia’s accusations against
Mr. Mazak and Indonesia is estopped from further accusing
Churchill

For the Claimants, Indonesia’s contentions that new facts emerged at the

hearing justifying accusations against Mr. Mazak should be given short

shrift. In March and July 2015, Indonesia stated that it had no accusations
against Churchill. 7 Its own police investigations did not reveal any
wrongdoing by Mr. Mazak, thus allowing the Tribunal to “assume (logically)
or infer (adversely)” that Indonesia knew Mr. Mazak’s role in relation to the
disputed documents when it made its statements earlier in 2015.38 In
essence, Mr. Mazak is now accused as a result of a process of elimination,
since “he is the only person yet to give evidence’”.**9 In this context, the

Claimants highlight that Indonesia never raised issues about Mr. Mazak

prior to the hearing and did not put any of these new accusations to the

Claimants’ witnesses during cross-examinations.2°

Furthermore, Indonesia’s new allegation that Churchill structured its
investment to facilitate the alleged fraud is “ambush”, as the Claimants
prepared their defense on the basis of the record as it stood before the
hearing and of the representations which Indonesia made in March and July
2015. In this regard, the Claimants also point to Mr. Ishak’s apparent
apology to Churchill at the hearing.%3"

Indonesia’s fresh allegations are baseless and should not be entertained. In
light of Indonesia’s prior representations, the Claimants seek a declaration

that Indonesia is “estopped and precluded from pressing these new
allegations against the Claimants”.**? In any event, the coordination initials
on the draft decrees establish that the applications were processed until the
final stages, thus doing away with Indonesia’s contention that Messrs. Armin
and Ordiansyah declined to process the PT RTM and PT RTP
applications.23

2.6. Legal consequences of a finding of forgery

For the Claimants, the question of legal consequences is moot if the
disputed documents are found not to be forged or fabricated.%*4 In the event
of a finding of forgery, the Claimants argue that there are distinct legal
consequences of forgery or of fraud.%%5 In any event, the Claimants submit
that the legal consequences would be “very limited” under both scenarios
(forgery and fraud), as the “vast majority of the Claimants’ investments will
remain legally valid”.336

In this context, the Claimants refer to the description of their investments in
their Memorial on Jurisdiction and Merits, where they submit that their
investments are composed of (i) shares in PT ICD as well as in PT TCUP;
(ii) an indirect interest in Ridlatama’s shares in PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP
and PT IR; (iii) contractual and shareholding interests, through PT ICD, in
the Ridlatama Companies and the EKCP; (iv) Ridlatama’s mining licenses;
(v) feasibility studies and other intellectual property tied to the EKCP; (vi)
monies invested through PT ICD; and (vii) goodwill in the Indonesian mining
services market.3°” Thus, even assuming that the licenses were forged, “the
vast majority of these investments will remain legally valid investments’ ,**°
with the value of certain components changing.

Specifically, with the exception of the disputed mining licenses, (i) all shares
will remain legally valid securities, although their value might change; (ii) the
contractual interests are unaffected, although their value might change;

(iii) the feasibility studies and other intellectual property remain legally valid,
their value being susceptible to change; (iv) the amounts invested would not
change; and (v) the goodwill would also remain, subject to determining its
value, if the licenses were forged by someone other than the Claimants.%39

The Claimants argue that Indonesia failed to provide a cogent legal reason
why a finding of forgery would lead to the “drastic conclusion” of dismissal of
the entire case.*° More particularly, they submit the following arguments on
the legal consequences of a finding of forgery of the disputed documents:

i. If the Survey and Exploration Licenses are forged or unauthorized,
that would not dispose of the validity of the Exploitation Licenses as a
matter of Indonesian and international law. Although Indonesia initially
contended that a finding of forgery would be dispositive of the claims,
it admitted at the hearing that a factual finding of forgery would not
determine the legal question of the validity of the disputed licenses,
nor of the Exploitation Licenses.3*"

Whether an exploitation license can be issued if preceding licenses
were improper is a question of Indonesian law on which Indonesia
presented no arguments or expert evidence. *? As a matter of
Indonesian law, the Exploitation Licenses are “stand-alone
administrative acts” that perfected Ridlatama’s title to the EKCP and
superseded all other previous licenses (whether authorized or not).33
Indonesia's contention that the exploitation licenses are infected with
“procedural deviations’ is ill-founded since Indonesia’s argument rests
on an “established” procedure within the Regency, which has proven
not to exist. Indeed, Indonesia conceded that it lacked “a well

C-PHB2, {[ 26. The Claimants specify that Indonesia's reference to three articles in the
2009 Mining Law do not support Indonesia's proposition, while Law No. 11 of 1967 on
the Basic Provisions of Mining, which applied at the time the disputed licenses were
issued, contains not a single provision allowing to conclude that the validity of
exploitation licenses depends on the validity of prior licenses. C-PHB2, § 26;
Exh. CLA-5.

C-PHB1, 159.

74

established procedure” and Mr. Ishak even testified that “anything can
happen”.344

With respect to the procedural deviations mentioned by Indonesia, the
Claimants provide the following responses: (i) the fact that Ridlatama
filed multiple applications is irrelevant since Indonesia made no
submissions on whether such course of action was possible; (ii) the
fact that the upgrades created an overlap with Nusantara’s exploration
licenses is no proof of deviating procedures in light of Mr. Gunter’s
testimony that over 5000 overlaps of mining licenses exist in
Indonesia, a situation created exclusively by Indonesia and its officials;
(iii) Indonesia did not dispute that the Regency drafted and issued the
exploitation upgrades and therefore cannot rely on “unusual language”
therein to cast doubt on their validity; (iv) the fact that the attached
maps have some irregularities cannot be used against the Claimants
since other maps also have irregularities and Indonesia did not
produce a digital database of the Planology Office; (v) the fact that
someone outside the Mining and Energy Bureau picked up the
upgrades is irrelevant to the existence of deviations in the issuance of
the upgrades; and (vi) Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah confirmed that
they attended the feasibility study presentation on 28-29 April 2009 “in
circumstances in which they now say Ridlatama did not hold general
survey or exploration licenses for the area the subject of the
presentation” 245

In sum, for the Claimants, Indonesia’s contention that something went
awry in the processing of the exploitation upgrades is unsubstantiated,
just like its argument that corruption may be involved.*6 In addition,
Mr. Noor’s refusal to attend the hearing and the exclusion of his
evidence dispose of the Respondent’s case on the Exploitation
Licenses, which leads to the conclusion that these licenses must
stand.%47

ii. With respect to the Legality and Cooperation Letters, Indonesia did not
establish the legal consequences which the holder of a mining license
incurs in the event that no valid approval has been granted.**8 In any
event, it never argued that these ancillary documents have any “direct
consequences in terms of dismissal”.3*°

iii. Like the previous category, the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations
have “no direct value as investments” and no impact on the Claimants’
case. As a matter of Indonesian and international law, the absence of
borrow-for-use permits, or breaches of forestry law, in no event justify
the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses. 9° Ms. Nurohmah
confirmed this understanding of Indonesian law when she denied
having heard of license revocations as a result of lacking borrow-for-
use permits.°5!

iv. The same argumentation applies to the Technical Recommendations.

v. Finally, the Re-Enactment Decrees may well have been authorized in
a “bad faith sense” as part of a scheme of Mr. Noor aiming at denying
the validity of the Ridlatama licenses.%* If the Re-Enactment Decrees
were forged or unauthorized the only consequence would be that
claims for restitution of amounts spent between the re-enactments and
the dismissal of the Samarinda court actions would be barred.**? The
allegations that Churchill was implicated in the fraud and sought to
avoid disclosure before the AIM is “unbelievable”. Such short-sighted
conduct would readily be discovered, put the share value of the
Claimants at risk and expose their personnel to criminal liability.25* For

tights of the EKCP in the seven months before he notified the Secretary of the Region
Province of East Kalimantan that he never issued the Re-Enactment Decrees.

the Claimants, the “more plausible explanation” is that someone within
the Regency wanted to reverse Mr. Noor’s prior mistake of handing
the licenses back to Nusantara.2°>

In addition, the Claimants invoke various legal doctrines to justify their
position that a finding of forgery would not affect their case, in particular (a)
estoppel, (b) acquiescence, (c) legitimate expectations, (d) unjust
enrichment, and (e) internationally composite wrongful act.

a)  Estoppel

The Claimants submit that under international law, States are obliged to
adopt good faith conduct in their dealings with foreign investors, meaning
that they cannot disregard their own words and deeds or benefit from their
own inconsistencies.° In reliance on international case law and doctrine,
the Claimants submit that the “requirements for estoppel are (a) a clear and
unambiguous statement of fact; (b) which is voluntary, unconditional and
authorized; and (c) which is relied upon by the other party in good faith
either to its detriment or which provides an advantage to the party making
the statement”.%*” Silence and lack of protest, so say the Claimants, can also
found estoppel and representations need not be made directly to the party
relying upon them.%8 Conditionality and authority require case by case
analysis; actual authority is not the test, since representations made by a
person “cloaked with the mantle of Governmental authority” may bind the
State.59

The Claimants further submit that Indonesia is estopped from disputing the
validity of the licenses. Estoppel derives from the facts that the Regency
conducted itself “in a manner that communicated to the Claimants that the
Ridlatama licences were valid” and the Claimants detrimentally and

reasonably relied on the licenses to further invest in the EKCP.%© Indonesia
failed to exercise due care, management and control over the disputed
mining areas and the Claimants “relied in good faith on the representations
and assurances of the Regency and its officials as to the validity of the
licences”.26' If only Ridlatama is found to have engaged in forgery or fraud
(to the exclusion of the Claimants and of insiders within the Regency),
Indonesia would still be estopped from denying rights under the mining
licenses or be held to have acquiesced to their validity. On the other hand, if
Ridlatama is held to have operated with the assistance of a Regency insider,
the Respondent would have breached the FET standard in the BITs (bad
faith conduct, lack of transparency, and breach of legitimate
expectations) 362

b) Acquiescence

The Claimants stress that acquiescence and estoppel are not “the same
thing” although they are often linked. °° Thus, the two claims have
independent legal foundations.

For the Claimants, regardless any ex post finding of fraud, Indonesia
acquiesced during the relevant period by allowing “an existing legal or
factual situation to continue”, including by accepting rent payments and
being aware of the Claimants’ exploration activities in circumstances where
it could or should have objected. This is in particular so because Indonesia
argues that it allegedly “knew Nusantara was maintaining its title throughout
2007 and 2008”.35+

c) Legitimate expectations / FET

According to the Claimants, where an investor invokes estoppel (or
acquiescence), there often is a “concurrent (or consequential) claim” under
the legitimate expectations component of the FET standard. Relying on case

State’) that were voluntary, unconditional and authorized’.

law, the Claimants therefore argue that there is “commonality between the
way an FET-backed legitimate expectation is generated and the way an
estoppel arises” .365

d) Unjust enrichment

The Claimants further submit that the FET standard also accommodates “a
number of other general principles of international law’, including unjust
enrichment, as Saluka and other decisions confirmed. They concede that
illegality may be a bar to an unjust enrichment claim, but only where the
illegality is imputed to the party raising the unjust enrichment claim. To the
extent that the Respondent does not allege that the Claimants were involved
in the alleged forgery, Indonesia may not oppose an illegality defense to the
unjust enrichment.”

Since the Claimants discovered the seventh largest coal field in the world,
Indonesia evidently enriched itself by stripping them of their mining rights.26°
The Claimants also contest that an unjust enrichment claim can only be
adjudicated if the Tribunal were holding ex aequo et bono.3®

e) Internationally wrongful composite act

For the Claimants, Indonesia committed a “composite violation of FET”? in
the sense of Article 15 of the ILC Articles on State Responsibility. On this
basis, Churchill and Planet argue that Indonesia’s “pattern of misconduct —
including the conduct that underpins the denial of justice claim and the
threats of force claim — constitutes a composite internationally wrongful

act”.371

Analysis

This part first deals with preliminary matters (A). The Tribunal thereafter
goes into a detailed assessment of the Respondent's allegations of forgery
and the existence of a fraudulent scheme (B) and then draws the
appropriate legal consequences (C). Wherever appropriate, it first sets out
the Parties’ positions before going into the Tribunal’s analysis.

Preliminary issues

This section addresses whether one or two awards should be rendered (1),
the scope of this Award (2), the law applicable to this phase of the
proceedings (3), the burden and standard of proof (4), adverse inferences
(5), and the relevance of previous decisions or awards (6).

1. One or two award(s)?

Procedural Order No. 4 provided that the Tribunal would decide whether to
issue one or two awards after further consultation with the Parties. Lacking
an agreement on the number of decisions/awards, the Tribunal resolved to
issue two decisions on jurisdiction.

Following an invitation of the Tribunal to provide their views in relation to the
present ruling, the Parties consented on 27 September 2016 to the issuance
of a single decision/award. On this basis, the Tribunal renders a single
award.

2. Scope of this Award

In paragraph 5 of PO20, the Tribunal confirmed its prior directions in
paragraph 34 of PO15 and paragraph 28 of PO13, in the following terms:

“Having considered the positions set forth by the Parties at the
end of the hearing, the Tribunal confirms that the Parties are
to address matters falling within the scope of Procedural Order
No. 15 especially paragraph 34. In other words, the Parties
shall address (i) the factual question whether the impugned
documents are authentic or not and (ii) the legal
consequences of a finding of forgery. Matter (i) includes the
question whether, if they were not handwritten, the impugned
signatures were affixed with authority. Matter (ii) about the
legal position in the event of forgery does not cover the effect
of the possible invalidity of the survey and exploration licenses
on the exploitation licenses”.

80

233.

234.

235.

Accordingly, this Award deals with (i) the factual aspects of forgery (B) and
(ii) the legal consequences of a finding of forgery (C). It is structured
accordingly.

3. Applicable law

With respect to the law applicable to the merits, the Tribunal must rely on
Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention, which reads as follows:
“The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such
rules of law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence
of such agreement, the Tribunal shall apply the law of the
Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on

the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may
be applicable”.

The Parties have not agreed on the rules of law that govern the merits of the
Respondent's Application for Dismissal.2’”? Consequently, the Tribunal shall
apply, in addition to the two BITs, Indonesian law and international law when
appropriate. The Tribunal is of the view that the second sentence of Article
42(1) of the ICSID Convention does not allocate matters to either law. It is
thus for the Tribunal to determine whether an issue is subject to national or
international law.373

When applying the law (whether national or international), the Tribunal is of
the view that it is not bound by the arguments and sources invoked by the
Parties. The principle iura novit curia — or better, iura novit arbiter — allows
the Tribunal to form its own opinion of the meaning of the law, provided that
it does not surprise the Parties with a legal theory that was not subject to
debate and that the Parties could not anticipate.274

4. Burden and standard of proof

The Respondent submits that the Claimants carry the burden of making a
prima facie showing that the disputed licenses were validly issued. The
Respondent further argues that the appropriate standard of proof is the one
of balance of probabilities. By contrast, the Claimants reply that the
Respondent bears the burden of proving its allegation of forgery. Moreover,
for the Claimants, given the seriousness of the allegations, the applicable
standard of proof is “clear and convincing evidence”.

Starting with the burden of proof, the Tribunal deems it appropriate to apply
international law to this issue, since the claims brought in this arbitration
seek to establish the responsibility of a State for breach of the latter's
international obligations.” It is a well-established rule in international law
that each Party bears the burden of proving the facts which it alleges (actori
incumbit onus probandi).3”6 Since the Respondent alleges that the Survey
and Exploration Licenses and related documents are forged and that the
Exploitation Licenses were obtained through deception, the Respondent
bears the burden of proving its allegations of forgery and deception.

The Tribunal then turns to the standard of proof, about which the Parties
disagree as well. The Respondent considers that allegations of forgery and
of fraud must be shown on a balance of probabilities. By contrast, the

Claimants are of the view that the highest standard of clear and convincing
evidence must apply to prove forgery and fraud.

Some tribunals have applied the higher standard of clear and convincing
evidence due to the gravity of a finding of forgery or fraud.%’7 Others,
however, have considered that the common law standard of the balance of
probabilities or its civil law counterpart of “intime conviction” is sufficiently
flexible to assess an act of forgery or fraud in a commercial setting, it being
understood that the evidence must be commensurate with the seriousness
of the alleged conduct and the overall context. The Libananco tribunal for
instance manifested this view as follows:

‘[Allegations of fraud] may simply require more persuasive
evidence, in the case of a fact that is inherently improbable, in
order for the Tribunal to be satisfied that the burden of proof
has been discharged”.3”8

Lord Hoffmann expressed the same idea in an eloquent illustration:

“[S]ome things are inherently more likely than others. It would
need more cogent evidence to satisfy one that the creature
seen walking in Regent's Park was more likely than not to
have been a lioness than to be satisfied to the same standard
of probability that it was an Alsatian. On this basis, cogent
evidence is generally required to satisfy a civil tribunal that a
person has been fraudulent or behaved in some other
reprehensible manner. But the question is always whether the
tribunal thinks it more probable than not”.379

In this context, the Claimants assert that the Respondent must prove intent
and motive.%8° The Respondent rejects this proposition on the ground that

See, for instance: Waguih Elie George Siag and Clorinda Vecchi v. Arab Republic of
Egypt, \CSID Case No. ARB/05/15, Award, 1 June 2009, § 326 (Exh. CLA-225); EDF

there is no general requirement of mens rea or intent in investment treaty
practice where a party alleges that a document was forged.**!

While intent and motive may be required for a criminal act of forgery or
fraud, the present proceedings are not aimed at establishing criminal
liability. Here the Tribunal must determine whether the impugned documents
are authentic for purposes of an action seeking to engage the international
responsibility of a State. In this context, the Respondent is right that motive
and intent are not required, but may form part of the circumstantial evidence
to be considered in assessing authenticity.

In sum, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent carries the burden of
proving forgery and fraud, which proof will be measured on a standard of
balance of probabilities or intime conviction taking into account that more
persuasive evidence is required for implausible facts, it being specified that
intent or motive need not be shown for a finding of forgery or fraud but may
form part of the relevant circumstantial evidence. The Tribunal will assess all
the available evidence on record and weigh it in the context of all relevant
circumstances.

5. Document production and adverse inferences

Each Party requested that the Tribunal draw adverse inferences from the
other Party’s failure to produce certain documents contrary to the Tribunal’s
order or to present witnesses at the hearing. More specifically, the
Claimants assert that the Respondent failed to produce a large number of
documents. These documents are enumerated in paragraph 204 above, to
which the Tribunal refers. The Claimants further seek adverse inferences
from the Respondent's failure to present Messrs. Noor, Putra and Aspan as
witnesses, as set out in paragraph 205 to which the Tribunal refers.

The Respondent responded to the Claimants’ requests by stating that no
adverse inferences should be drawn and providing various reasons,
including the non-existence of certain documents, poor archiving
procedures, and privilege. The Respondent also stated that the Tribunal
“may draw such inferences as it deems appropriate” from the Claimants’
failure to produce a number of “significant documents that should have been

See, for instance: R-Answers, § 189.

84

247.

248.

249.

250.

in their possession” and to call Messrs. Basrewan and Mazak as
witnesses.22

The Tribunal starts by noting that Article 34(2)(a) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules empowers it to order the production of evidence, witnesses or experts
at any stage of the proceedings. The first sentence of Article 34(3) further
states that the Parties “shall cooperate with the Tribunal” in the production of
such evidence. Pursuant to the second sentence of Article 34(3), the
Tribunal “shall take formal note” of a Party's failure to comply with its
obligations in this respect and the reasons provided for such failure. Article
34(3) reads as follows:

“The parties shall cooperate with the Tribunal in the production

of the evidence and in the other measures provided for in

paragraph (2). The Tribunal shall take formal note of the

failure of a party to comply with its obligations under this

paragraph and of any reasons given for such failure”
(emphasis added).

As the Tribunal interprets this provision, it (i) enshrines a general obligation
to cooperate, (ii) and therefore does not aim at particular failures to comply
with particularized disclosure requirements, (iii) provides for the opportunity,
under certain circumstances to excuse non-compliance, such as the
invocation of privilege, and (iv) does not necessarily imply specific
consequences in cases of non-compliance, such as the drawing of adverse
inferences.

Except where otherwise stated and considering paragraphs 15.3 and 15.9 of
PO1 as well as Article 9 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence, the
Tribunal comes to its conclusions on the basis of the evidence on record
and does not deem it necessary to draw adverse inferences.

This being so, for greater clarity, the Tribunal adds that it accepts the
invocation of privilege by the Respondent in relation to the police files
concerning investigations into the alleged forgery, and in relation to
documents concerning investigations into Messrs. Ishak and Noor by the

According to the Respondent, the Claimants failed to produce the following documents:
PT RTM's application dated 20 March 2007 for a General Survey License; Ridlatama’s
requests for legality explanation letters dated 12 February 2008; Ridlatama’s requests
for cooperation letters dated 14 February 2008; Ridlatama’s requests for the
September 2010 technical consideration letters dated 27 May 2010; evidence of
protests to Mr. Noor following the Revocation Decrees; Ridlatama’s SKIPs; Ridlatama’s
29 October 2009 letter to the East Kutai Police; non-confidential documents from Credit
Suisse”. R-Comments 1, 9 39-44, 52-60, 69-71; R-Answers, § 142; R-PHB1, § 107,

anti-corruption agency KPK, since they are covered by the secrecy of
criminal investigations. Moreover, considering the evidence given by
Mr. Ramadani regarding the (bad) state of the archives at the Regency of
East Kutai (and in particular at the Mining and Energy Bureau), °*° the
Tribunal appreciates the Respondent's difficulties in locating various
documents. As concerns the Planology Office maps, while Mr. Ordiansyah
seemed to indicate that his office could produce various maps and a digital
database,?* the analysis below will show that the Tribunal primarily aimed at
determining the authenticity of the disputed documents by focusing on the
signatures, and that it was able to reach its conclusion on the basis of the
maps on the record.

Finally, the Tribunal does not deem it warranted to draw adverse inferences
from the fact that the Respondent did not present certain individuals as
witnesses. The fact that Mr. Noor did not appear for questioning resulted in
discarding his witness statement (see paragraph 84 above). As regards Mr.
Putra, the Tribunal notes that he is no longer employed by the Indonesian
Government. Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants did not request
that Messrs. Putra or Aspan be examined, which they could have done by
contacting these persons or asking the Tribunal to do so. The same holds
true for the fact that the Claimants did not present Messrs. Basrewan and
Mazak as witnesses.

6. Relevance of previous decisions or awards

Both Parties have relied on previous decisions or awards in support of their
positions, either to conclude that the same solution should be adopted in the
present case or in an effort to explain why this Tribunal should depart from
that solution.

The Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions. At the
same time, in its judgment it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions
of international tribunals. Specifically, it believes that, subject to compelling
grounds to the contrary, it has a duty to adopt principles established in a
series of consistent cases. It further believes that, subject always to the text
of the BITs and the circumstances of each particular case, it has a duty to
contribute to the harmonious development of international investment law,

with a view to meeting the legitimate expectations of the community of
States and investors towards legal certainty and the rule of law.

Factual aspects of document authenticity
1. Introduction

The Respondent disputes the authenticity of the 34 documents listed in the
Document Table. The Tribunal will review the allegations regarding each
disputed document in the following section. This review will lead to the
conclusion that the signatures in the disputed documents are not authentic
and not authorized. For greater clarity, the Tribunal already notes here the
essential reasons for such conclusion.

First, all the signatures in the disputed documents were mechanically
reproduced when the record establishes that officials at the relevant levels
of the Government signed documents of such nature by hand. Second, the
record shows that the Government did not use autopens or similarly
sophisticated mechanical devices to reproduce signatures. Third, the same
technology was used to reproduce the disputed signatures in documents
allegedly issued at three different levels of the Government.

Fourth, the record contains three different versions of the PT RTM and PT
RTP Survey Licenses of 24 May 2007. The first contains identical signatures
of Mr. Ishak most likely reproduced through the use of an autopen; the
second comprises “draft decrees” with coordination initials but without any
signature from Mr. Ishak; and the third comprises copied and pasted
signatures of Mr. Ishak taken from a previous license belonging to PT
Ridlatama Power (“PT RP”). The existence of these three different versions
of the same documents undermines the Claimants’ argument that the
application process for the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses was
brought to a successful end. It also casts serious doubt on the validity of the
other disputed documents. Finally, the circumstances surrounding the Re-
Enactment Decrees which contain identical signatures of Mr. Noor and were
inexplicably issued ten days after the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses
further buttress the Respondent's case of a scheme to forge documents.

Since the Respondent's allegations primarily rest on the lack of authenticity
of the licenses, the Tribunal will first deal with these (2.1) and address the
remaining or ancillary documents thereafter (2.2). Last, the Tribunal will

87

258.

259.

ascertain the Parties’ involvement in the authorship of the disputed
documents (2.3).

2. Survey and Exploration Licenses
2.1. Main features of the disputed documents

The Tribunal will address the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses and the
PT IR and PT INP Survey Licenses separately, because they were issued
on different dates and because there are three versions of the PT RTM and
PT RTP Survey Licenses which requires a particular analysis. The Tribunal
will deal with certain other particular features (such as the signature blocks
and the maps) in the course of its analysis, whenever appropriate.

a) The PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses

The PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses (documents nos. 1-2 in the
Document Table) were allegedly issued on 24 May 2007 and bear identical
signatures of the then-Regent of East Kutai, Mr. Awang Faroek Ishak. There
are three versions of decrees in the record for each license, namely (i) the
best copies (and originals inspected during the first document inspection of
29 August 2014) of the licenses originally produced by the Claimants (Exh.
C-40 and C-41; Exh. P-18 and P-19), bearing a decree number, signatures
identical to those on the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses as well as on
the four Exploration Licenses, and the official Garuda seal (chop) partly
overlapping with the signatures,°* (ii) the draft decrees without the signature
of the Regent but bearing coordination initials (Exh. C-383 and C-384) taken
from the so-called Kurniawan archive (see paragraph 74 above) and put on
the record in June 2015,%86 and (iii) decrees, which bear copied and pasted
signatures of the Regent taken from the PT RP Survey License issued on 12
February 2007 (Exh. R-264 and R-265; documents nos. 33-34 in the
Document Table) and provided by Mr. Gunter to the Claimants on 27 July
2015, a few days before the hearing.%°”

The original versions of these decrees were inspected by the Parties’ forensic experts
during the first document inspection on 29 August 2015. See: Epstein ER2, Annex 1,
items 1-2.

The first set, i.e. the versions originally filed by the Claimants (Exh. C-40 and
C-41), contain four distinct elements, namely (i) a decision letter granting a
General Survey License for a period of one year, (ii) an attachment setting
out the obligations of the holder of the mining license, (iii) an attachment
specifying the coordinates of the mining concession, and (iv) a map
indicating the borders of the concession area and applicable land uses. The
decision letters contain a letterhead with the emblem of the Regency, bear a
decree number, refer to an application letter of PT RTM and PT RTP
respectively, and bear the signature of the then-Regent, which partly
overlaps with the Garuda seal. The decree numbers are mainly typewritten,
except for the first three numbers which were inserted by hand. Similarly,
the date is partly written by hand (day) and otherwise typewritten (month
and year). The decree number and date are not added to the attachment
containing the map.

The signatures of the then-Regent are affixed at the end of all four elements
and they partly overlap with the Garuda seal. It is undisputed that they are
all identical.2** The following is an image of the signature block taken from
the decision letter in the PT RTM Survey License:3%9

The map attached to each license in the first set shows the mining area and
the different land uses. The legend column contains five different sections: a
general description, an inset showing East Kutai, the legend proper, a
signature block containing Mr. Ishak’s signature partly overlapping with the
official Garuda seal, and the designation of the responsible office in the
Regency. All entries are in the Bahasa Indonesian language. The Tribunal
will revert to specific features of these maps, and in particular to the
“anomalies” on the basis of which the Respondent argues that these maps
“have the earmarks of having been produced by a trickster” .3*"

The second set, namely the draft decrees (Exh. C-383 and C-384), were
also allegedly issued on 24 May 2007. They also contain the four elements
mentioned above in respect of the first set. The decision letter does not
contain a decree number and, in contrast to the original licenses, the date is
completely handwritten. In addition, the draft decrees are not signed by the
Regent but bear the initials of Mr. Putra next to the Regent's typewritten
name. Finally, the decision letter contains a box with the coordination initials
of Mr. Putra, the then-Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau, Mr. Zainuddin
Aspan, the then-Head of the Legal Section, Mr. Idris Yunus, the then-
Assistant 1, Mr. Sjafruddin, the then-Regional Secretary, and Mr. Noor, the
then-Deputy Regent.292

267. The attachment setting out the obligations of the license holder contains a
handwritten decree number, a handwritten date, and the initials of Mr. Putra
next to the typewritten name of the Regent, but not the signature of the
Regent. The attachment setting out the coordinates of the mining
concession contains only a handwritten decree number and date. Both
elements bear the same decree number as the licenses analyzed above

map only has the initials of Mr. Putra, next to the typewritten name of the
Regent, but not the Regent’s signature:395

Finally, the third set of licenses found in the Gunter Documents also
reproduce the content of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses,
although they show some important differences. First, in addition to the four
elements mentioned above, the documents contain a spatial analysis dated
21 May 2007, prepared by the Planology Office of the Regency, specifying
the various land uses in the concession area, and signed by Messrs.
Ordiansyah and Putra. Second, the decree number and date are always
handwritten. Third, the maps are different in significant respects from the
ones attached to the documents analyzed above. In particular, the column
on the right of the maps does not contain a legend or a box for the Regent's
signature, but contains three signatures (of Messrs. Ordiansyah, Putra and
Ishak), one identification number (the NIP of Mr. Ordiansyah), and the
official Garuda seal partly overlapping with Mr. Ishak’s signature. The
following image depicts the signature block next to the map in the version of

The Claimants did not dispute the Respondent's allegation that these
signatures were copied and pasted from the PT RP license.*°? The forensic
experts from both sides conducted their own examinations prior to the
hearing and confirmed this fact.4°3 Indeed, this appears quite clearly from the
version of the PT RTP license where some printed text below Mr. Putra’s

name is partly cut off by the overlaying signature block containing
Mr. Ishak’s signature and the Garuda seal:4%

b) The PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses

275. The PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses (documents nos. 3-4 in the
Document Table) were allegedly issued on 29 November 2007, and bear
identical signatures of Mr. Ishak (Exh. C-65 and C-66). The originals were
inspected by the Parties’ forensic experts during the first document
inspection on 29 August 2014.

276. The main features of these licenses are similar to those of the PT RTM and
PT RTP licenses analyzed above, i.e. they contain four distinct elements
(decision letter, attachment with obligations of license holder, attachment
with coordinates, and map); bear a decree number of which the first
numbers are handwritten; refer to the respective application letters of
PT INP (20 November 2007) and PT IR (19 November 2007); bear identical
signatures of the Regent which partly overlap with the Garuda seal; and
bear a date of which the day is handwritten.4°°

c) The Exploration Licenses

The Exploration Licenses of PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and PT IR
(documents nos. 15-18 in the Document Table) were allegedly issued on
9 March 2008 and bear identical signatures of Mr. Ishak (Exh. C-99 to C-102
and Exh. P-49 to P-52). The originals were inspected by the Parties’ experts
during the first document inspection on 29 August 2014.

The Exploration Licenses also contain four elements, namely the decision
letter, an attachment setting out the obligations of the license holder, an
attachment with the coordinates of the mining area, and a section with
maps. The first two numbers of the decree number and the day of the date
were inserted by hand. The signatures of Mr. Ishak partly overlap with the
Garuda seal. It is undisputed that the Regent's signature in all four
Exploration Licenses are identical and that they are identical with those in
the four Survey Licenses just described that were originally filed by the
Claimants.*1°

The following is the signature block of the decision letter in the Exploration
License of PT RTM:41

The Claimants did not dispute that the maps are copies of those attached to the PT
INP and PT IR application letters, specifically the Application for General Survey
License made by Investama Resources of 19 November 2007, p. 4 (Exh. C-54) and
the Application for General Survey License made by Investmine Persada of 20

the PT INP Exploration License has two maps, there being no outcrop
map.*'® Consequently, the first three Exploration Licenses bear six and the
PT INP Exploration License bear five identical signatures of Mr. Ishak.*7

General features of the maps attached to the Exploration Licenses are, inter
alia, that the map and legend are in portrait format, the Regent's signature
and the official Garuda seal are below and outside the map, all descriptions
are in English, and they use different scales, all of which appear to be
different from the one employed in the Survey Licenses.‘18

2.2. How were the disputed documents signed?

It is undisputed that Mr. Ishak did not sign the Survey and Exploration
Licenses by hand.‘9 Indeed, the Claimants did not challenge Mr. Ishak’s
testimony that he did not sign those decrees. 4? More importantly, the
experts agree that all the signatures of Mr. Ishak in these eight documents
are identical and are therefore reproductions.‘?' They also agree that the
signatures are high quality reproductions. 422 On this basis, the Tribunal

The Claimants did not dispute the Respondent's position that the maps are scaled
1:50,000 instead of 1:250,000 (R-Answers, § 88). The Tribunal notes, however, that
the situation maps in the exploration licenses use a different and larger scale than the
one in the topographic and outcrop maps.

The Claimants stated that they and “their expert, Dr. Strach, agree with the State and
Mr. Epstein that the signatures on the disputed documents cannot be the product of
human handwriting as they are, essentially, identical”. Reply, § 51. See also: Strach

The Claimants did not challenge the two “well-established principles” put forward by
Mr. Epstein that (1) no two people write alike and (2) no one person produces a
signature or writing in exactly the same way twice (e.g., Epstein ER2, p. 7). Dr. Strach
stated as follow: “These documents contain ink signatures in the name of H. Awang
Faroek Ishak which (other than in some very fine detail) are essentially identical to
each other. Individually they lack the variation in pen pressure and associated variation
in ink line width and impression that is characteristic of handwritten signatures (the ink
lines are almost constant width). Collectively their identical nature indicates that they
cannot be the product of human handwriting as people cannot and do no replicate their
signature exactly from one signature to another” (Strach ER1, {| 7).

cannot but find that Mr. Ishak’s signatures in the Survey and Exploration
Licenses were not written by hand, that they were affixed on the documents
by some other means, and that the reproductions are of high quality.47

The position is less clear-cut when it comes to establishing what technology
or method was used to affix Mr. Ishak’s signatures on the disputed licenses.
The Parties have different views on this issue and each expert could not
fully rule out the position adopted by the other. The Respondent relied on
Mr. Epstein’s evidence to argue that the signatures were affixed through an
autopen, while the Claimants relied on Dr. Strach, who was inclined to find
that the signatures were produced through a high-quality stamping device.
The Claimants also relied on evidence given by Mr. Kurniawan who stated
that the Regency was using purple color ink stamps to reproduce the
signature of Mr. Ishak, for instance, for “invitations and announcements”.474

In his second report, having confirmed that Mr. Ishak’s signatures were not
written by hand, Mr. Epstein opined that they were the product of a
mechanical process referred to as an autopen signature and defined as
follows: “This process uses a master signature that has been programmed
into the autopen through a smart card or flash drive. The signature is then
reproduced, in ink, exactly the same way each time”. Mr. Epstein
concluded that one master signature was used to reproduce Mr. Ishak’s
signature in all eight licenses.47°

By contrast, Dr. Strach considered that “it is not possible to make a definitive
or probabilistic determination of the technology or technologies used to
produce these signatures”.‘2” While Dr. Strach conceded that the signatures
present some characteristics of an autopen, such as uniform pen pressure,
blunt ends and generally smooth appearing lines,4?8 he indicated that the

ends of some ink lines”, further conceding that “literature indicates that extra ink at the
ends of ink lines is sometimes a characteristic of Autopen writing rather than reduced
ink”.

use of high quality stamp impressions or other types of printing technology
“are other explanations” of the origin of the disputed signatures.*7°

In respect of the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses, in particular,
Dr. Strach observed that certain features speak in favor of stamp
impressions or other printing processes rather than autopen: specifically an
angular feature at the bottom left of the relatively long rounded feature in the
lower center part of the signature (marked as E in the reproductions below),
a slight downward protuberance near the right end of the lowest almost
horizontal line of the signature (marked as D in the reproductions below), the
width of a small spot to the left of the signature which is smaller than the
main signature ink lines (marked as C in the reproductions below),*°° and
strings of faint marks near the top right and lower left of the signature
(marked as A and B in the reproductions below).*3! The following images
depict these features in the PT RTM license:4%2

Strach ER1, App. C, Chart 17. Dr. Strach provides the following explanations: “The
repeating fine features associated with many of the signatures on document 1 to 16 are
marked C to E [...]. Strings of faint marks that recur with varying degrees of visibility on
eight signatures on pages of documents 1 and 2 are marked A and B”.

Dr. Strach further noted that the blue ink of the circular stamp impression
(i.e., the Garuda seal) is strongly visible on the back of the signature page,
suggesting “substantial soaking” into the front of the paper, while the
signatures present “less substantial soaking”.*°° He also observed that, at
the intersection between the stamp and the signature, the blue ink of the
stamp impression “is either not visible or has substantially reduced visibility”,
possibly indicating that the stamps were placed on the documents after the
signature.*4

With respect to the specific features identified by Dr. Strach, Indonesia
responded that protuberances, angular features, voids, width variations,
small spots and dots, smudge and faint marks are also associated with

autopens.*% In particular, Indonesia argued that Dr. Strach failed to explain
“why the marks associated with the signatures always recur in the same
position” and “why the marks associated with the circular stamp impressions
do not”.436

The Tribunal notes that autopens have been commonly used in the United
States for several decades, particularly by government agencies, including
to reproduce the signature of the President of the United States such as the
one of President Eisenhower.‘*’ By contrast, autopens are much less known
in other parts of the world, in particular in South-East Asia and Australia.49°
Dr. Strach, who practices in Australia, stated that such devices are rare in
his country and that he personally had never come across one.“*9 Although
the Claimants dispute the reliability of Indonesia's witnesses on this point, a
matter to which the Tribunal will revert, it notes that all the Indonesian
witnesses testified that they never heard of autopens and that such devices
were not used by the Indonesian authorities, including the Regency of East
Kutai, the Governorship of East Kalimantan, and the MEMR.“° It is also
noteworthy that there is no indication in the record whether the Autopen
company had sold its devices to the Indonesian Government."

Dr. Strach stated the following during cross-examination:

“Q. Are autopens utilized in Australia?

A. | don’t know the answer to that question.

Q. But in your 25 years of working as a document examiner, you haven't run across
autopen signatures or documents in your work?

“never utilizes an electronic signature, stamp or any mechanical or automated method
of affixing the Regent's signature” (Ramadani WS, { 17). The Tribunal further notes
that the Claimants’ witness, Mr. Kurniawan, had not either heard of autopens until the
present proceedings and that he did not know whether such devices were used at the
Regency (Kurniawan WS1, § 53).

At the hearing, Mr. Epstein testified that he had not enquired whether the Autopen
company had sold its machines to the Indonesian Government (Tr. (Day 2), 115:9-13
(Cross, Epstein)). The Claimants do not appear to have made such inquiry either.

106

296.

The Tribunal further notes that Dr. Strach conceded that the signatures on
all eight mining licenses are identical in the sense that the same master
signature was used.*4? While he opined that the signatures in the PT RTM
and PT RTP Survey Licenses might have been produced through a different
technology than the other disputed signatures of Mr. Ishak as Regent, he
also admitted that the recurrent spots and features “rather strongly” suggest
that one single technology was used.**? Dr. Strach further accepted that the
uniform pen pressure, the blunt ends, the smooth lines and extra ink at the
end of ink lines are characteristic of autopen technology.‘** He also could
not rule out that a faulty autopen produced the specific features he
identified.“** Because the signatures are of such high quality, Dr. Strach
ruled out regular stamp impressions, including  self-inking stamp
impressions, or pre-inked stamps. Asked about self-inking stamp
impressions, he answered as follows:

“Q. Would they fall within what you would call a self-inking or high

quality stamp?

A. In terms of the high quality we're seeing in these particular
signatures, it is a bit hard to reconcile what I’m seeing with these
signatures with a regular stamp impression, including a self-inking
stamp impression”.“4¢

And Dr. Strach also seemed to rule out pre-inked stamps:

Strach ER1, § 11.

Strach ER1, § 11. Dr. Strach provided the following explanations at the hearing
regarding paragraph 11 of his first expert report: “In that paragraph 11 I’ve put a
hypothesis that documents 1 and 2 [in the Document Table above, i.e., the PT RTM
and PT RTP Survey Licenses] may have been produced using a different technology
used for documents 3 to 18 [in the Document Table above], but then I've sort of self-
criticized that by saying that the recurrent spot which occurs on all these signatures,
and the other features referred to, the detail within those signatures, recurs throughout
all these signatures, so that rather strongly suggests that the one technology or device
has been used”. Tr. (Day 2), 183:4-12 (Cross, Strach). See also: Tr. (Day 2), 203:21-22
(Tribunal, Strach).

Strach ER1, 8. At the Hearing, Dr. Strach stated the following with respect to the
disputed signatures:

“Q. At the time you examined the documents in Singapore, what were your initial
observations concerning the signatures in terms of their quality and what their
provenance might be?

A. That they were remarkably similar and uniform, many produced with what appeared
to be uniform pen pressure. But one of the first things | also observed was some of
these extra marks that have gone into the first report”. Tr. (Day 2), 156:7-14 (Cross,

“There are other forms of stamp impressions. Pre-inked stamps, for
example, can produce quite reproducible signature images. But
again, from what I've seen, not as reproducible as what I’m seeing
with these signatures”.447

It is striking that the Claimants’ expert was unable to identify any technology
able to generate such high quality reproductions, other than autopen
devices.“48 After counsel for the Claimants suggested during the cross-
examination of Mr. Epstein that metallic stamping devices could possibly be
the source of these high quality reproductions, counsel for the Respondent
put the same possibility to Dr. Strach, who answered that he was unable to
identify any such device and that he was unfamiliar with metallic stamping
devices. Dr. Strach could not have been clearer:

“I've not found anything that reproduces the quality of these

particular signature reproductions”.““9
And further:

“Q. So my question is, as someone who is very familiar with

this area [i.e., stamp impressions], can you identify today a

high quality stamp that would produce a signature with this
quality?

A. | can’t specifically state which make of stamp could produce
this quality”.4°°

Moreover, the Tribunal is of the view that there are insufficient elements in
the record to follow Dr. Strach when he sought to discard an autopen
signature based on the fine outline marks. Indeed, Indonesia pointed to
literature demonstrating that the autopen signatures of U.S. Presidents also
contain similar fine detail, including reduced amount of ink at the ends of
some ink lines, protuberances, angular features, voids, smudge marks, faint
marks, spots and dots, and width variation.‘*' For instance, the following

Strach).

Tr. (Day 2), 158:23-159:2 (Cross, Strach). And Dr. Strach added: “So, | mean, there
are so many varieties of print technology that all such print technologies would have to
be considered. And print technology can reproduce in fine detail aspects of an original
image, but | can't be more specific as to what technology”. Tr. (Day 2), 163:6-10
(Cross, Strach). See also: Tr. (Day 2), 49:18-23 (Direct Epstein).

“There are many reasons why ‘variants’ can be produced from the same matrix. Minute
differences will appear from the same pattern when the operator moves the paper or
item placed on the Autopen. If the pen is not placed tightly in the machine or when a
pen runs out of ink, and a different type of pen replaces the old one a ‘variant’ type of

not conduct research into autopens. 4% In contrast, Mr. Epstein was
confronted throughout his career with autopens, in particular as the Chief
Forensic Document Examiner at the Forensic Document Laboratory of the
Immigration and Naturalization Service of the United States of America
between 1980 and 2000. In that capacity, he regularly reviewed fraudulent
signatures that should have been generated by autopens but were instead
signed by hand.** It is true that he has not kept up with developments in the
autopen technology since he left the U.S. Immigration Service. In light of his
experience and expertise and considering that there appear to have been no
new developments, this is not susceptible of affecting the weight of this
evidence. Indeed, Dr. Strach confirmed that most of the scientific literature
on autopen was “definitely older’, meaning pre-dating the year 2000.*°

In sum, on the basis of the facts and evidence in the record and having
assessed the weight of the expert evidence before it, the Tribunal gives the
preference to Mr. Epstein’s expert opinion according to which Mr. Ishak’s
disputed signatures on the Licenses were most likely reproduced by an
autopen or similarly sophisticated devices. In reaching this conclusion, the
Tribunal is mindful that Mr. Epstein indicated a 70% probability that an
autopen had been used and that, therefore, no 100% certainty can be
asserted.“®” Yet, having pondered all the circumstances, the Tribunal has no

Dr. Strach stated the following during cross-examination:

hesitation concluding in favor of the view of the Respondent's expert, which
it finds clearly more reliable and robust than the evidence of the Claimants’

expert.

2.3. Was the signature of the disputed licenses in Mr. Ishak’s name
authorized?

It is the Respondent’s primary case that forgery is established by the very
fact that the disputed licenses were not signed by hand. Therefore, so
Indonesia contends, the question does not even arise whether there was
authority to mechanically reproduce Mr. Ishak’s signature. In any event, the
Respondent relies on witness evidence to argue that there was no such
authority. It also submits that the elements of process highlighted by the
Claimants do not support a finding of authorization.

The Claimants argue that authorization is the key question in the present
context. For them, the record shows that the application process for the
Survey and Exploration Licenses was brought to a successful end, and that
Mr. Ishak authorized the issuance of the licenses and the mechanical
reproduction of his signature (good faith authorization). In the alternative, the
Claimants submit that someone within the Regency (possibly Mr. Putra
and/or Mr. Noor) conspired to generate fake or “plausibly deniable” licenses
in order to preserve the possibility of auctioning off the mining area in favor
of a higher bidder once mining deposits would be discovered (bad faith
authorization). In particular, the Claimants argue that Mr. Noor was playing
off Ridlatama against the Nusantara companies, and vice-versa, so as to
obtain the best bargain from the highest bidder for the vast newly discovered
coal reserves.

The Tribunal will first address the practice of signing mining licenses by
hand (a) and then review whether the signature of such licenses in the
Regent's name was authorized (b), including the elements of process
invoked by the Claimants to support their contention that there was
authorization (c).

Subdivision of the Mining and Energy Bureau,**? and Mr. Ordiansyah, Head
of the Planology Office,“ confirmed that Mr. Ishak always signed decrees
by hand. They also testified that the Regency did not use mechanical
devices to reproduce the Regent's signature.**'

In his witness statements, Mr. Ishak referred to the “Regulation of Minister of
Domestic Affairs Number 3 Year 2005”, which provides that Regency
documents must be signed by the Regent or a duly authorized official,4°? and
testified that: “[m]y understanding, and the understanding of all other officials
with whom | have dealt in my capacity as Regent of East Kutai, has always
been that this regulation requires official documents to be signed by
hand”.463

The Claimants’ witnesses Benjamin and Gunter also stressed the
importance of signing mining licenses by hand. Mr. Benjamin said that he
would have been “concerned” had he known that the mining licenses were
not signed by hand.** Mr. Gunter, for his part, called the signature the “last

than with the approval process for decrees (he only became Head of the Legal Section
in 2012), he too gave evidence that the “Regent would sign the originals [i.e., the three
versions of final draft decrees of each mining license] by hand”. He further stated that
the Regency “never utilizes an electronic signature, stamp or any mechanical or
automated method of affixing the Regent's signature”. Ramadani WS, § 17. With
respect to signature stamps, see also: Tr. (Day 4), 147:1-5 (Direct, Ramadani).

bastion of power’”.46 Questioned by the Tribunal, he responded that “a
physical signature is [...] the only way it would happen”:

“Q. In your experience, and what | see from your GMT you

have lots of experience in Indonesia, in this type of licensing,

have you ever seen a license signed by a Bupati, or another

official, not in handwriting but by a stamp or some other
means?

A. Unfortunately, | only deal with photocopies [...] But | know
that a signature, a physical signature is, | would think would be
the only way it would happen. I’ve never heard of stamps
being used and I’ve never heard of any other reproduction
techniques used by the Bupati himself, because he is
presented with a document for signing”.4®

The evidence of Mr. Ishak, Regent of East Kutai at the relevant time and
presently Governor of East Kalimantan, deserves a mention. While he was
clear on the fact that he signed documents by hand, he appeared at times
confused about dates and chronology of events during his cross-
examination. For instance, he first stated that “at the [relevant] time | was
not the Regent” and thereafter that “[t]here must have been something that
might have prevented me from signing” the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey
Licenses.‘*” The Tribunal does not consider that this diminishes the value of
this evidence on his signing practice. That evidence is largely corroborated
by other witnesses as just described. Moreover, it is recalled that Mr. Ishak
attended the hearing while still recovering from a stroke, which may explain
his difficulties of situating himself in time and remembering details.‘

Tr. (Day 3), 17:15-16 (Direct, Ishak). At times, Mr. Ishak also had difficulty
remembering the dates of his different offices, stating at one point that he “withdrew
from being Regent in 2003, while the licensing and permit was only processed in 2008,
if I'm not mistaken”, and then later on when confronted with the draft decrees for PT
RTM and PT RTP: “How is it possible that — wait a second — 24 May 2007, | signed the
document? Because at the time | was not the Regent. That would be impossible. | was
already governor. How would it be possible for me to sign a decree based on my
position as a Regent?” Tr. (Day 3), 12:6-8, 15:13-18 (Direct, Ishak). According to the
information provided in Mr. Ishak’s first witness statement, he was Regent of East Kutai
for a first term between 1999 and 2003 and for a second term between late 2005 and
December 2008, when he was elected Governor of East Kalimantan for a first term. He
was reelected for the 2013-2018 term and presently still holds that office. Ishak WS1,

b) The scope of delegated authority to issue decrees

Since the licenses bear Mr. Ishak’s signature and it is established that
Mr. Ishak signed documents by hand, the question arises whether Mr. Ishak
authorized someone to sign his name in his stead.

It is common ground that duly authorized officials at the Regency could sign
official documents. It is also common ground that, during Mr. Ishak’s
absence, his deputy, Mr. Noor, would sign official documents such as mining
licenses. In this context, the Claimants point to Mr. Ishak’s frequent travels
during his campaign for the position of Governor of East Kalimantan
between 2006 and 2008.

Nothing in the record shows that Mr. Noor, as Deputy Regent, would have
signed on behalf of Mr. Ishak using Mr. Ishak’s name and signature.
Mr. Ishak was clear that Mr. Noor was only authorized to sign official
documents using his own signature:

“Q. The question is not what he did. The question is whether

he had the authority to sign. [Unclear — simultaneous
speaking]

A. He had the authority as deputy, yes, he could.

Q. How would he sign? Would he sign “Isran Noor” or would
he sign something else?

A. As Deputy Regent. As Deputy Regent.

Q. He would sign his name?

A. As Deputy Regent, Isran Noor.

Q. He would not have authority to sign your name?

A. Not possible. Not possible”.4°°
At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal specifically asked the Parties what
evidence showed that the issuance of the impugned documents was
authorized or not.47? The Claimants put forward the following elements:
(i) Mr. Ishak authorized his subordinates to sign official documents on his
behalf, in particular when he was away campaigning for the Governorship of
East Kalimantan between 2006 and December 2008; (ii) his deputy at the
time, Mr. Noor, was “automatically responsible” during his absence to look
after the affairs of the Regency and Mr. Noor had authority to make and sign
decrees; (iii) although Mr. Ishak testified that Mr. Noor would sign as Deputy

472

Regent, Isran Noor, “the scope of Mr. Noor’s authority as Deputy Regent is
not clear’,47' especially since Mr. Ishak was evasive on that point; and that
therefore (iv) “it seems possible that, in his second term as Regent (which
included the Relevant Period), Mr. Ishak was more preoccupied with his
campaign than serving as Regent, and that he delegated a significant
amount of authority to Mr. Noor”; or (v) that Mr. Noor exceeded his
delegated authority “when he saw opportunities for personal gain”, which
would explain his wealth and estrangement from Mr. Ishak.472

In the Tribunal’s opinion, none of these elements show that Mr. Ishak
authorized Mr. Noor to issue official documents by reproducing Mr. Ishak’s
signature or that Mr. Noor exceeded his delegated authority, by affixing Mr.
Ishak’s signature on the disputed documents. While Mr. Ishak may well
often have been away on his election campaign, the record does not show
that he was absent at the relevant time, i.e. on 24 May 2007 for the PT RTM
and PT RTP Survey Licenses, on 29 November 2007 for the PT INP and PT
IR Survey Licenses, and on 9 April 2008 for the Exploration Licenses. More
importantly, the Tribunal sees no reason to doubt Mr. Ishak’s testimony that,
during his absence, Mr. Noor would sign official documents using his own
name, not that of Mr. Ishak. There is also nothing in the record suggesting
that, in respect of the disputed PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, Mr. Noor
exceeded his authority by mechanically reproducing Mr. Ishak’s signature.
The only evidence in the record showing Mr. Noor’s involvement with the
disputed PT RTM and PT RTP licenses are his initials affixed, in his capacity
as Deputy Regent, in the last line of the coordination box on the draft
decrees (see image in paragraphs 265 and 266 above). If anything, this
would show that he used his own name or initials rather than the Regent's.
The Tribunal notes in this context that the initials of Mr. Putra, not Mr. Noor,
appear next to the printed name of Mr. Ishak (see image in paragraph 267
above).

The Claimants invited the Tribunal to draw adverse inferences from the fact
that the Respondent only produced 22 mining licenses issued in 2007 and
2008. According to the Claimants, “it is impossible to confirm whether
Mr. Ishak regularly authorized his subordinates to issue decrees on his
behalf, but the adverse inference to be drawn is that, if these documents

317.

318.

were produced, they would indicate that such a procedure was common at
the Regency”.‘”? The Tribunal is unable to draw such adverse inference in
the absence of any indication that Mr. Noor would mechanically reproduce
Mr. Ishak’s signature instead of signing decrees on behalf of the Regent.

In fact, the experts concur that all the licenses produced by the Respondent
for purposes of comparison bear non-identical handwritten signatures of
Mr. Ishak, as opposed to identical mechanically reproduced signatures such
as the ones at issue here. There are two exceptions, however, namely two
licenses granted to a company by the name of Swasembada, which is
controlled by Ridlatama, a fact to which the Tribunal will revert (see
paragraphs 363-364). 44 Dr. Strach examined a total of 2,849 pair
comparisons of Mr. Ishak’s signature (both on originals and copies) and
came to the conclusion that “[nJo further examples of repeating signatures
were found in the numerous pair comparisons | have made”.475

c) Elements of process

The Claimants rely on several elements of process both predating and
postdating the issuance of the licenses to support the contention that the
licenses were issued with proper authorization. These include the Ridlatama
applications for mining licenses, staff analyses prepared by the Mining and
Energy Bureau, spatial analyses prepared by the Planology Office, draft
decrees with coordination initials, register books, actual survey and
exploration activities on the ground, compliance with reporting obligations,
dead rent payments, various acknowledgments of receipt, and other
subsequent conduct of Indonesian officials.*”

The Tribunal will primarily focus on the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey
Licenses, since most of the allegations and evidence of process relate to
these licenses. Thereafter, it will review the PT INP and PT IR Survey
Licenses and the Exploration Licenses. In view of the fact that the same
master signature of Mr. Ishak was employed in all cases, a finding of
authorization (or lack thereof) with respect to the PT RTM and PT RTP
licenses is likely to apply equally to the other disputed licenses. Before

turning to the elements of the licensing process invoked by the Claimants, it
is useful to set out the main steps of such process.

(i) The licensing procedure in the Regency of East Kutai

A mining application is usually submitted to the Regent, with a copy to the
Mining and Energy Bureau, or directly to the Mining and Energy Bureau, in
which case it will forward the application to the Regent. A mining application
addressed to the Regent is first received by the General Affairs Bureau,*’”
which Mr. Ramadani accepted to describe as the Regency’s mailroom
managing the “circulation of destination of letters’.‘”® The General Affairs
Bureau registers the incoming letter in the register book‘’? and then forwards
it to the Regent, *®° without, however, opening the letter.‘*’ The General
Affairs Bureau only provides a stamped receipt if the applicant so
requests.‘

Upon receipt of the application, the Regent writes by hand his instructions
(disposisi in Indonesian) on the application for the attention of the Mining
and Energy Bureau.“®? The Head of the Licensing Subdivision of the Mining
and Energy Bureau reviews the documentation accompanying the
application and coordinates with the Planology Office to verify, through a
spatial analysis, any potential overlap with preexisting mining areas and the
specific land uses in the area for which the license is applied.4®*

A staff analysis by the Mining and Energy Bureau is prepared if a specific
issue requires the Regent's attention.‘®° If there is no such issue and the
application fulfills all the requirements, the Licensing Subdivision of the

Mining and Energy Bureau prepares a draft decree,‘ while the Planology
Office issues a new map that is initialed by the Head of the Planology
Office.48” The draft decree is then passed on to the Legal Section.

Together with the application and related documents, the draft decree is
received by the Head of the Legal Section, who passes it on to the Laws
and Regulations Subdivision.*** The latter reviews the legal aspects of the
draft decree.** If the draft is approved and finalized (dated and numbered),
the Head of the Laws and Regulations Subdivision prepares “several
originals as required and/or necessary”.4°° Mr. Ramadani actually explained
that this office prepares three originals. The last page of the decision letter
or decree of the first original contains a box for the coordination initials of
various departments within the Regency," and is ultimately kept in the
archives of the Legal Section. The Secretariat of the Mining and Energy
Bureau registers the receipt of the remaining two originals and keeps one of
them in the archives of the Mining and Energy Bureau.‘ The third original is
delivered to the applicant.49¢

For instance, Mr. Ordiansyah provided the following explanations with respect to
instructions of the Regent to generate a map: “Q. So you said you will develop a new
map when the license is granted? A. Yes, if the Regent gave me an order to do that.
After our input on the spatial matters, the Regent gives an order whether or not we
should follow up on the issuance of the permit. If it is issued, it means that we will
develop a new map, where there is a column for the Regent, and | just provide my
initials. Q. When you say an order from the Regent, do you mean a disposisi, you will
have to receive a disposisi from the Regent to then produce the map? A. Yes. If I’m
ordered to do that and have a disposisi to issue the license”. Tr. (Day 3), 134:1-15

involved, if the draft decree “related to matters that have been handled by legal
assistance subdivision as the lawyer of the regional government”. Tr. (Day 4), 162:5-14
(Cross, Ramadani). In this context, Mr. Ramadani explained that the Legal Section
comprises three subdivisions, the Legal Documentation Subdivision, the Laws and
Regulations Subdivision and the Legal Assistance Subdivision (Ramadani WS, § 11;
Tr. (Day 4), 159:25-160:8 (Cross, Ramadani)).

The Head of the Laws and Regulations Subdivision circulates the first
original to various departments in the Regency for approval and keeps the
second and third originals in his custody in the meantime.**° The first original
with the coordination box is circulated to the Head of the Mining and Energy
Bureau, the Head of the Legal Section, the Assistant | of the Regency, the
Regional Secretary of the Regency, and the Deputy Regent. Once the
heads of all these departments have approved the decree by affixing their
initials in the coordination box, the three originals are presented to the
Regent who signs them, starting with the first original which contains the
coordination box. Mr. Ramadani provided the following descriptions of this
particular process in this respect:

“After all the coordination initials are complete, then Mr. Aji

Rahida, as head of the laws and regulations subdivision,

would directly bring the three bundles to the Regent for

signing. The coordination initials is on the top. Therefore, if the

Regent signs a documents [sic], the first one which is signed

by the Regent is the coordination initials, then the second
original then the third original. It would be that way”.4%°

Following signature by the Regent, the three originals are returned to the
Legal Section where they are stamped with the official Garuda seal.49” The
decree is then entered in the register book of the Legal Section.4% Finally,
the third original is handed over to the successful applicant by an official of
the Regency, but not by way of an official handover ceremony where the
Regent is present.499

Bearing these steps in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the process
concerning the disputed Ridlatama licenses, mainly the PT RTM and
PT RTP licenses.

(ii) The PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses

The Claimants rely on the following elements predating the issuance of the
disputed licenses to support their contention that the licenses were validly
issued: the application for Survey Licenses by the Ridlatama companies; the
staff analysis dated 26 February 2007 prepared by Mr. Putra; the MEMR
letter of 23 March 2007; the spatial analyses of 21 May 2007 prepared by
Mr. Ordiansyah, the draft decrees dated 24 May 2007; and the formal
signing and stamping of the draft decrees.*°° They also note that these two
licenses were entered in the register book of the Legal Section, and argue
that “this last step is an essential feature of the footprint of a general survey
licence”. °° Finally, the Claimants also point to “extensive
acknowledgements and recognition from various governmental authorities of
the validity of the Ridlatama general survey licenses’, including
acknowledgements of receipt of various agencies in East Kutai, °°? East
Kalimantan,5° and the MEMR;54 the payment of dead rent to the MEMR;
and the compliance with reporting obligations such as the submission of
quarterly reports, final survey reports, and work and budget plans. Churchill
and Planet finally invoke a letter sent by the Mining and Energy Bureau to
PT RTM and PT RTP “welcoming’ them to East Kutai and inviting them to
coordinate with relevant government agencies”.5°5

According to the Respondent, none of these elements demonstrate that the
impugned PT RTM and PT RTP licenses were authorized. In particular, the
Respondent relies on evidence given by Messrs. Ordiansyah and Armin that
they never processed the general survey applications of PT RTM and PT
RTP, since the requested mining areas overlapped with the mining licenses

of the companies Nusantara Wahau Coal and Kaltim Nusantara Coal.5°° For
Indonesia, the spatial analyses prepared by Mr. Ordiansyah supports this
conclusion, considering that the abbreviation “Eks.” preceding the names of
the Ridlatama companies means eksplorasi, or exploration, and does not
mean “former” as the Claimants erroneously argue (see also paragraph 335
below).5°7

The Tribunal observes that the applications for the Survey Licenses of PT
RTM and PT RTP were processed within the Regency and reached the
penultimate stage in the process, all the relevant departments having
approved the licenses. This being so, for the following main reasons, these
facts do not prove that the signatures of Mr. Ishak were affixed on the
disputed licenses with his approval.

For the Tribunal, the most relevant elements of process in this context are
the 26 February 2007 staff analysis, the 21 May 2007 spatial analyses, and
the three versions of licenses in the record. The staff analysis dated 26
February 2007 was prepared by the then-Head of the Mining and Energy
Bureau, Mr. Djaja Putra. ** It analyzes whether the concession areas
requested by PT RTM and PT RTP overlap with the mining areas conceded
to Nusantara and reaches the following conclusions: (i) the concession
areas requested by PT RTM and PT RTP overlap to 100% with “previous”
locations of the mining areas of the two Nusantara companies KNC and
NWC, respectively;5° (ii) the KNC and NWC exploration licenses expired on
9 March 2006;5"° (iii) Nusantara sent its first requests for extensions on 20
November 2006 which were received on 29 November 2006;5"' and (iv) the
Nusantara extension applications were “eight months and 26 days late from
the expiry of the IUP which is 7 March 2006”.512 On that basis, Mr. Putra
reached the conclusion that the KNC and NWC licenses had “expired”, that

“the concession areas become open to other companies”, and that the
Regent had “the authority to make any decisions on locations”.5'3

Assuming the content of the staff analysis to be correct, the latter only
shows that the Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau did assess potential
overlaps of the requested mining areas with other concessions. His
assessment supports the Claimants’ contention that the mining areas in
question were “open” at the relevant time and that they could apply for a
mining license. It does not show that Mr. Ishak’s non-handwritten signature
on the decrees was authorized. It does so even less if one considers that
the staff analysis specified that the ultimate decision to grant a mining
license rested with the Regent. Moreover, there is no indication in the
analysis that Mr. Putra coordinated his analysis with Mr. Ordiansyah from
the Planology Office (at the time called the Geographic Information System),
which coordination was necessary to verify the existence of potential
overlaps. In fact, Mr. Armin, the staff member in the Licensing Subdivision of
the Mining and Energy Bureau who was in charge of processing the
Ridlatama applications,*'* gave evidence that he was not involved in the
preparation of the staff analysis, and was unable to find the original or a
copy of this analysis.5'5 In addition, the staff analysis does not contain any
instructions (disposisi) from the Regent, and Mr. Ishak denied having seen
this analysis.51

In this context, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent questioned the fact
that the Claimants were in possession of an internal Regency document.
Messrs. Benjamin and Kurniawan testified that Regency officials routinely
shared internal documents with applicants in order to keep them informed
about the progress of this application. Hence, the Tribunal attaches no
particular significance to this point.5'”

As a last point in respect of the staff analysis, the Respondent argued that
its reference to the MEMR letter of 23 March 2007 casts doubt on the

reliability of the staff analysis which is dated from 26 February 2007. While
there may be explanations, *'® it is true that this discrepancy is odd.
However, the Tribunal does not see what can be inferred from this oddity for
present purposes.

The Tribunal now turns to the spatial analyses of 24 May 2007 prepared by
the Head of the Planology Office, Mr. Ordiansyah. These analyses were
prepared in respect of the PT RTM and PT RTP applications and are
attached to the versions of such licenses contained in the Gunter
Documents.*'? Mr. Ordiansyah explained that a spatial analysis is an internal
document drawn up for the Regent and the Mining and Energy Bureau,
which always consists of a table and a map.°” The table contains five
columns that determine (i) the status of the forest area, (ii) the status of the
land, (iii) the forest concessions, (iv) the location of permits for plantation,
and (v) the location of mining permits.5?' Mr. Ordiansyah further specified
that the map is not the one that is ultimately attached to a mining license,
when an application is ultimately approved by the Regent.522

Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed at the hearing that he had prepared the analyses.
In these documents, he concluded that the mining areas for which PT RTM
and PT RTP had applied overlapped with the exploration licenses of the two
Nusantara companies KNC and NWC.§®3 These two spatial analyses are
signed by Mr. Ordiansyah, Head of the Planology Office, and Mr. Putra,
Head of the Mining and Energy Bureau.***

Mr. Ordiansyah pointed in particular to the abbreviation “Eks.” (with a dot)
which precedes the names of the Nusantara companies (see also paragraph
327 above). He explained that “Eks.” was the abbreviation used by the
Planology Office to signal the existence of an exploration license. He added

that an abbreviation was needed because “the column is so small”.55 By
contrast, the Claimants understand “Eks’ as meaning “former” in reliance on
a Bahasa Indonesian dictionary definition without corroborating evidence of
actual practice. Faced with these two meanings, the Tribunal is inclined to
accept Mr. Ordiansyah’s explanation that the term “Eks.” within the
Planology Office was used as an abbreviation for exploration. The spatial
analyses therefore confirm Mr. Ordiansyah’s evidence that “[d]ue to the
overlapping issue, the Planology Office never issued any maps for RTM
[and] RTP [...] as we understood that general survey licenses would not be
approved for those Ridlatama companies” .56

In contrast to the table in the spatial analyses which, in addition to the
signature of the Head of the Planology Office, is co-signed by the Head of
the Mining and Energy Bureau, Mr. Ordiansyah gave evidence that only the
Head of the Planology Office was supposed to sign the map attached to a
spatial analysis.5?” He therefore signified his perplexity when seeing that the
signatures of both Mr. Putra and Mr. Ishak appeared on the maps of his
spatial analyses. 58 It should be mentioned here that the signatures of
Mr. Ishak are copy-pasted from another document, i.e. the PT RP General
Survey License of 12 February 2007 (see paragraphs 268-270 above).

Mr. Ordiansyah further expressed his skepticism about the fact that the
spatial analyses had been provided to the Ridlatama companies and the
Claimants. Mr. Ordiansyah explained that a new map is generated within the
Planology Office if the Regent decides to approve a mining application,
which map would then be attached to the original licenses:

Mr. Ordiansyah provided the following explanation: “Q. So is that correct if | say the
‘Eks.’ stands for ‘eksplorasi’; that’s what you are saying? A. Yes, it's because the
column is so small and we cannot write down the full word, so we tried to abbreviate it,
‘exploration’, in accordance with the latest status of PT Nusantara Wahau Coal whose
license we have in our database. So — it's because the column is too small and won't fit
if | wrote down that entire word. So there is a dot there, and that means that it is an
abbreviation of the work ‘eksplorasi”. Tr. (Day 3), 136:8-17 (Direct, Ordiansyah).

Ordiansyah WS, 26.

Tr. (Day 3), 132:6-9 (Direct, Ordiansyah). Mr. Ordiansyah further stated that “this is my
analysis and only | can sign it, and there will not be a signature of the head of mining
bureau and the Regent's signature. So this is solely my report, the result of our
analysis for the Regent; so if it is from me, there shouldn't be a signature from the head
of the mining bureau as well as the Regent’. Tr. (Day 3), 132:15-22 (Direct,
Ordiansyah).

“After the analysis has been submitted to the Regent and
carbon copied to the head of mining bureau, then there will be
an order from the Regent, whether or not it will be followed
upon the form of license, then we will make another map for
license”.529

The Tribunal notes that Mr. Ordiansyah confirmed that he prepared the
maps attached to the two spatial analyses in the Gunter Documents.5° The
Tribunal has no reason to question Mr. Ordiansyah’s evidence that only the
Head of the Planology Office was meant to sign these maps. Accordingly,
the fact that these maps additionally bear the signatures of Messrs. Ishak
and Putra and that Mr. Ishak’s signatures are copied and pasted tends to

show that these maps were doctored.

The Tribunal now turns to the three versions of mining licenses PT RTM and
PT RTP, namely (i) the Survey Licenses which bear identical signatures of
the Regent affixed, as was seen earlier, by an autopen or other similarly
sophisticated mechanical device (see paragraph 302 above),**' (ii) the so-
called draft decrees provided by Mr. Kurniawan, which bear no signature of
the Regent, %? and (iii) the Gunter Documents, which bear identical
signatures of the Regent that were copied and pasted from the PT RP
mining license of 12 February 2007.53

The Tribunal is troubled by the co-existence of these three different versions
of the same licenses for which no cogent explanation is offered. It is true
that Mr. Gunter stated that he frequently saw different versions of the same
licenses. However, his statement did not extend to circumstances like the
present, where none of the licenses contain a handwritten signature of the

Tr. (Day 3), 133:20-25 (Direct, Ordiansyah).

Mr. Ordiansyah stated the following: “So this map, if [sic] from our side, from my office,
planology office, and together with the table, only | can sign the map. You can see my
signature there. And that is the one that | sent to the mining bureau and the Regent's
office. Only my signature will be there, because this is an analysis and it is part of my
duties — the one that is responsible for the spatial matters to the Regent. And | sent it to
the mining bureau and also to the office of the Regent”. Tr. (Day 3), 132:1-10 (Direct,

Regent. He indeed confirmed that he assumed that his documents
contained the handwritten signature of the Regent (something he could not
verify since Mr. Mazak from Churchill only provided him photocopies).5%4

Further, as was discussed in connection with the approval process,
Mr. Ramadani explained that, once the first original license with the
coordination box is returned to the Legal Section, the Regent is presented
with three originals. He signs all three starting with the first original
containing the coordination box. In the draft decrees provided by
Mr. Kurniawan, the coordination boxes do appear but they feature no
signature of the Regent. Next to the latter’s printed name, one only finds the
initials of Mr. Putra. If Mr. Ishak had authorized the reproduction of his
signature, the process was such that it would first have been applied to the
first original.

Moreover, Mr. Armin, who had worked on the Ridlatama applications of PT
RP and PT Ridlatama Steel (“PT RS”), gave evidence that he did not
prepare the draft decrees.®?5 Similarly, Mr. Ordiansyah indicated that the
maps attached to the draft decrees were not issued or approved by the
Planology Office.536

In addition, the Claimants’ explanation that these draft decrees were
provided to Ridlatama to verify the coordinates of the mining area is not
convincing. The Tribunal does not question the Claimants’ statement that
internal documents of the Regency were provided to Ridlatama staff. What
is questionable, however, is the fact that the draft decrees are dated 24 May
2007, the day when the disputed licenses were supposedly signed by the
Regent. It is implausible that the following steps all occurred on the same
day: (i) the issuance of draft decrees, (ii) their unofficial transmittal to
Ridlatama staff to verify the coordinates of the mining areas, and (iii) the
formal signing of the original mining licenses, which would normally occur
once the verification was completed. The Tribunal also notes that
Mr. Benjamin stated that he had no knowledge of these draft decrees, and
had never seen them prior to the hearing.5°7

As a further troubling aspect, the forensic experts confirmed that the
signatures of Mr. Ishak in the Gunter Documents were copied and pasted
from the PT RP license of 12 February 2007.5%* The Gunter Documents also
comprise the spatial analyses of Mr. Ordiansyah mentioned above. These
include maps with copied and pasted signatures of Mr. Ishak, as well as the
signature of Mr. Putra, when Mr. Ordiansyah explained that none of these
signatures should be there in a normal process.

Additionally, the originals inspected by the forensic experts of both Parties
show additional troubling oddities. In particular, the maps attached to the
disputed PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses do not contain
Mr. Ordiansyah’s initials; they are not registered in the database of the
Sistem Informasi Geografis (which was the former name of the Planology
Office); and they are not in the format of the 2007 official maps of the
Regency (Mr. Ordiansyah pointed in particular to the absence of graticules
on all four sides of the map).539

In other words, the existence of three different versions of licenses casts
serious doubt on the authenticity of the licenses on which the Claimants now
seek to rely. To these considerations one must add the evidence of
Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah, who testified that they never processed the
mining license applications of PT RTM and PT RTP, except for
Mr. Ordiansyah’s spatial analyses concluding that the mining areas
overlapped with Nusantara’s exploration licenses.

To summarize, if the approval process had been completed, there would
have been two original decrees within the Regency (the first original in the
archives of the Legal Section and the second original in the archives of the
Mining and Energy Bureau). The third original would have been provided to
the applicant. In the present case, the Respondent stated that it could not
find the two originals in its archives, be it in the Legal Section or the Mining
and Energy Bureau. More importantly, the Claimants should be in
possession of only one original of each license, when they produced three
different versions. The first versions (the Gunter Documents) contain copied
and pasted signatures of Mr. Ishak, and are therefore clearly doctored; the
second versions contain the signature of Mr. Ishak most likely reproduced

with an autopen; and the third versions containing the coordination box
show no signature of Mr. Ishak. These elements, together with other oddities
identified in the three versions, lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that the
PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses are not authentic, and that their
issuance was not authorized.

In contrast to the elements of process assessed above, the Tribunal does
not attach much importance to the PT RTM and PT RTP mining application
letters, since they merely show that Ridlatama started the application
process. That said, the Tribunal notes that the application letters bear the
date of 27 February 2007, while the disputed licenses refer to application
letters of 20 March 2007.%° The Tribunal further notes that the coordinates
for the applied mining areas do not completely overlap with those set out in
the mining licenses.*' Finally, the Tribunal also notes that the application
letters do not bear any instructions (disposisi) from the Regent.*?

In this context, the Tribunal does not attribute much relevance to the MEMR
letter of 23 March 2007. This letter was sent to Ridlatama in response to a
request dated 20 March 2007 for a confirmation of the availability of a
general survey concession area. In that letter, the MEMR indicated that the
status of the mining area contemplated by the two Ridlatama companies
would become “open” and could be applied for “if the Concession Area of
Exploration held by PT. Nusantara Kaltim Coal of PT. Nusantara Wahau
Coal has expired, and no extension [has been] requested by them’.*° It
therefore does not support an interpretation that the mining areas in
question were open at the relevant time. For present purposes, it merely
shows that Ridlatama was interested in obtaining mining rights in the EKCP,
but it is otherwise irrelevant to the assessment of whether the disputed
licenses were issued with authorization or not.

The fact that the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses were registered in the
Register Book of the Legal Section does not change the Tribunal’s
assessment. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that “[rlegistration of
Compare the PT RTP and PT RTM applications for General Survey Licenses dated

fictitious or falsified documents does not make them authentic”. In any
event, the Tribunal cannot follow the Claimants’ argument that registration
“points very strongly to the affixation of the Bupati signature and the stamp
was authorized”.® In this regard, Mr. Ramadani testified that the registrar
told him that Mr. Putra requested the registration, and that he promised that
he would thereafter deliver the signed original license with the coordination
box. While the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that this evidence is
“aged hearsay”, it is a plausible explanation that would rather confirm that
the disputed licenses were not signed.

Neither does the subsequent conduct of Indonesian officials change the
Tribunal’s assessment of the facts. This is particularly so with respect to the
ancillary documents whose authenticity is also disputed by the Respondent
and which contain signatures identical to the ones in the disputed licenses,
such as the payment letters, for instance. The acknowledgements of receipt
by different government agencies at various levels are equally incapable of
rendering the mining licenses authentic, since they were issued on the
(presumably misguided) assumption that the licenses were authentic.

Finally, the Parties extensively argued whether the coordinates of the areas
granted in the disputed mining licenses overlapped with the mining areas of
two Nusantara companies. The Tribunal does not deem it necessary to
delve into this issue in any detail, since it is immaterial to resolve the issue
of document authenticity, that is the question whether the signatures in the
disputed licenses were affixed with authorization or not. Even assuming,
arguendo, that the Nusantara licenses had expired at the relevant time and
that the mining area called EKCP was “open” and available for other
applicants such as Ridlatama, this would still provide no convincing proof
that the disputed documents are authentic. At any rate, as will be seen
further below, the disputed PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses created an
overlap with two mining areas of another Indonesian company named Bara
Energi Makmur (“BEM”), a fact which the Claimants did not address at all in
their submissions and therefore further undermines their case.

R-PHB1, 43.

The Claimants stated the following: “I would put most weight on the register, that if
there is a document that is recorded in the register on the Regency, even though we
can't answer how and who, one can nevertheless conclude that in all the
circumstances, the circumstantial evidence points very strongly to the affixation of the
Bupati signature and the stamp was authorized”. Tr. (Day 7), 175:11-18 (Closing,

In conclusion, the Tribunal finds that the disputed Survey Licenses of PT
RTM and PT RTP are not authentic, and that Mr. Ishak did not authorize the
reproduction of his signature through mechanical means.

(iii) The PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses

In light of the fact that the disputed PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses
(documents nos. 3-4 in the Document Table) contain the same signatures of
Mr. Ishak as the ones reproduced in the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses, the
analysis conducted and the conclusions reached above apply equally here.
To reach this conclusion in the present context, the Tribunal reviewed the
following additional elements.

First, there is nearly no paper trail regarding the application process of these
licenses. The application letter of PT INP is dated 20 November 2007 and
that of PT IR 19 November 2007. The Survey Licenses were allegedly
issued on 29 November 2007. There is no evidence of any staff analysis or
spatial analyses, and Mr. Ramadani stated that he did not locate the
originals in the archives of the Legal Section. Messrs. Armin and Ordiansyah
indicated that they never processed any aspect of these applications.

Second, the maps attached to the PT INP and PT IR Survey Licenses were
not generated by the Planology Office, but were copied and pasted from the
application letters.5“* In addition, these maps were not signed by hand by
Mr. Ishak but contain the same disputed signature of Mr. Ishak that appears
on the other challenged licenses.

Third, Mr. Ramadani indicated that the decree numbers on the licenses
pertain to other decrees issued in June 2007 and confirmed that the maps
are not registered in the Planology Office’s database and do not comport
with the format of the 2007 official maps.*7 In addition, the Respondent
pointed to the fact that the licenses were only registered on 28 December
2007 in the Register Book of the Legal Section and with a different decree
number.*8 The Respondent further explained that the “improper registration”

Ramadani WS, Annex, item 4.

R-Answers, § 81; R-PHB2, note 56. The decree number of the PT INP license is
247/02.188.45/HK/X1/2007, but it is registered under the number
753/02.188.45/HK/XII/07; and the decree number of the PT IR license is
248/02.188.45/HK/XI/2007 and registered under the number 754/02.188.45/HK/XII/07.
See: Registration of General Survey Licenses for INP and IR in the 2007 Registration
Book of the Legal Section of the Regency of East Kutai, p. 3 (Exh. C-456).

360.

of these two licenses “cannot be chalked up to incompetence or mere
mistake”, since “[t]heir decree numbers did not correspond at all to the
registration entries and the date of registration (28 December 2007) was
more than a month after their supposed issuance (29 November 2007)”.548

Fourth and importantly, the mining areas allegedly granted to PT INP and
PT IR in November 2007 partly overlap with the mining area of the company
BEM, which obtained its Exploration License in October 2007.5 Therefore,
the disputed licenses created an overlap with existing licenses that had
been issued shortly before. The Claimants focused on the partial overlap of
the PT INP and PT IR mining areas with those of the Nusantara companies
BNK and NWC, but kept silent on the BEM licenses. The lack of plausible
explanation for this overlap is an additional element pointing towards a

fraud.

On this basis and taking into account the main features of the PT INP and
PT IR Survey Licenses described above (see paragraphs 275-279), the
Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the licenses under scrutiny are not
authentic and that the reproduction of Mr. Ishak’s signature was not

authorized.
(iv) The Exploration Licenses

For essentially the same reasons, the Tribunal also reaches the conclusion
that the signatures of Mr. Ishak in the disputed Ridlatama Exploration
Licenses of 9 April 2008 (documents nos. 15-18 in the Document Table)
were mechanically reproduced without his authorization.®*' Indeed, the four
Exploration Licenses bear the same non-handwritten signature of
Mr. Ishak.®5? This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the Exploration
Licenses were not registered in the register book of the Legal Section and
that there is no paper trail at all regarding the application process.*

363.

In addition, it is noteworthy that the Exploration Licenses contain three
different maps generated by GMT (a situation map, a topographic map and
an outcrops map), instead of a single map prepared by the Planology
Office.5* In this context, the Tribunal notes that Mr. Gunter stated that the
maps attached to the Exploration Licenses were generated by Mr. Harahap,
who was the supervisor of GIS systems at GMT. Mr. Gunter further testified
that never before had he seen GMT maps being attached to mining
licenses:
“Q. Just to make sure we understand your answer, you have

not seen it before that your maps are attached to permits
issued by the Regency? Is that what you're saying?

A. Yes, that’s correct. Our maps may be used as a support to
the application, but should not normally [be] included [in] a
kabupaten [i.e. Regency] document”.555

The Respondent called attention to the following other oddities in these
maps: they were compiled on 11 June 2007 and are copyrighted; they do
not show forestry areas; the legends are in English, instead of Bahasa
Indonesian; the Regent's signature is located outside the maps, instead of
inside the legend column; the graticules are only on two sides instead of all
four; the maps are improperly oriented in portrait format instead of
landscape format; there is an inset of East Kalimantan although maps from
2008 did not have insets; the source of the maps is different from the source
of official Regency maps produced by the Respondent; and they are in a
different scale (1:50000 instead of 1:250000).5°

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the disputed signature of Mr. Ishak that
appears on the Exploration Licenses is also reproduced on the mining
licenses granted on the same day to two other companies, namely
Swasembada Energy and Swasebada Bara. *” In this connection, the
Claimants argue that “[t]he existence of identical signatures on mining
licenses granted to unrelated parties on the same day” supports the
Claimants’ view that “the method of application of the signatures on

Ridlatama’s Exploration Licenses was not irregular”.5® The Tribunal cannot
accept the Claimants’ contention, because the Swasembada companies are
related to Ridlatama. Indeed, Mr. Mujiantoro, the Managing Director of the
four Ridlatama companies under scrutiny here, is a shareholder and director
of the two Swasembada companies.*?

Taking into consideration that no other third party mining licenses in the
record contain the same non-handwritten signature of Mr. Ishak, the fact that
the two Swasembada companies are related to Ridlatama, that the
Swasembada licenses were allegedly issued on the same day as the
disputed Exploration Licenses, and that they contain the same identical
signatures of Mr. Ishak, the Tribunal finds that these are further significant
elements corroborating that the reproduction of Mr. Ishak’s signature was
not authorized.

Having reached the conclusion that the reproduction of identical signatures
appearing in the disputed mining licenses was not authorized by Mr. Ishak
and that therefore these licenses are not authentic, the Tribunal now turns to
the authenticity of the remaining disputed documents, namely the ancillary
documents.

2.4. The ancillary documents

The ancillary documents contain disputed signatures issued at three levels
of the Indonesian Government, the Regency of East Kutai, the Province of
East Kalimantan, and the central Government in Jakarta. More specifically,
the ancillary documents comprise: (i) the Payment Letters issued at the
Regency level (see from paragraph 369 below); (ii) the Cooperation and
Legality Letters issued at the Regency level (see from paragraph 369
below); (iii) the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations issued at the provincial
level (see from paragraph 383 below); (iv) the Technical Considerations
issued by the MEMR at the level of the central government (see from
paragraph 409 below); and finally (v) the Re-Enactment Decrees issued at
the Regency level (see from paragraph 427 below).

Reply, § 111.

The Respondent further pointed out that Mr. Wirmantoro was also a director of PT IR,
while at the same time being shareholder and director of the two Swasembada
companies. R-Answers, § 94. See also: Company Data - PT Swasembada Energy
(Exh. R-215); Company Data — PT Swasembada Bara (Exh. R-216).

At the outset, the Tribunal notes that the Claimants did not address these
documents during the hearing in the same detail as the others. They
observed, however, that if the Tribunal were to find that the mining licenses
were validly issued “then the style of signature that one finds in the ancillary
documents, was very likely authorized as well”.5° They also confirmed that
the reverse would be equally applicable:

“Q. If we find that those documents here which are called

ancillary documents were forged, that we may then also

conclude that the survey license and the exploration license
are also forged?

[-]

A. [I]f you felt that the same style of signature, that however it
was affixed, had been affixed by a forger, without
authorization on the ancillary documents, that would be a
factor that you might give serious consideration to when you
came back to look at the licenses. And the reality is that that is
an argument that is made against us. They are the same
signatures, and you have heard the evidence of Bupati Ishak,
something you obviously have to give some weight to [...]”.5°!

The Tribunal will first assess the authenticity of the documents issued at the
Regency level (a), followed by those at provincial level (b) and at the level of
the central Government (c). Finally, it will turn to the Re-Enactment
Decrees (d).

a) Ancillary documents at the Regency level

The ancillary documents bearing the signature of Mr. Ishak as Regent
comprise the Payment Letters, Cooperation Letters and Legality Letters.
After briefly setting out the Parties’ positions, the Tribunal sets out the main
features of these disputed documents and concludes on their authenticity.

Tr. (Day 1), 154:5-13 (Opening, Sheppard). During Closing Statements, counsel for the

Claimants similarly stated the following: “If we then turn to the ancillary documents.
These are not relied on as establishing the claimants’ rights, but they are relied on by
the respondent as evidence of a fraudulent scheme. There are the requests for
seriousness bond payments, the certification letters, the certificates of legality. | don't
have time to go through those in the same detail, and indeed there is not the same
amount of evidence for and against in relation to them. If you find that the general
survey licenses and the exploration licenses were validly issued, then it’s very likely
that these documents were validly authorized as well”. Tr. (Day 7), 185:17-186:4

(i) Parties’ positions

The Respondent asserts that the forged documents also include (i) two
Payment Letters dated 4 December 2007 for PT INP and PT IR;°® (ii) four
Cooperation Letters dated 8 April 2008 for PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and
PT 1R;58 and (iii) four Legality Letters dated 8 April 2008 for PT RTM, PT
RTP, PT INP and PT IR.5

The Respondent pointed to the following evidence of forgery. First, Mr. Ishak
did not sign the documents “or otherwise authorize them”. Second, none
of these documents are entered into the Regency Registration Books of
Decrees. °° Third, none contain a unique decree number. °7 Fourth,
Mr. Ishak testified that he never issued any Payment or Legality Letters.5®°
Fifth, Ridlatama created these ancillary documents “to appease Claimants”,
in particular because the Legality Letters “were needed because of the co-
operation agreements”, as the Claimants admitted.5*

The Claimants reply that there is necessarily less evidence of authorization
because the ancillary documents are not licenses.5” With respect to the
Payment Letters, the Claimants submit that the “main evidence” that the
signatures of Mr. Ishak were authorized is that they also bear the official
Garuda seal.57' Since the Respondent did not provide the original of the
register book of the Legal Section, the Claimants further argue that “it is not
possible to determine with any certainty whether the payment request letters
were recorded or not”.5’2 With respect to the Legality and Cooperation
Letters, the Claimants call attention to the fact that the Respondent failed to
produce comparator documents, and thus invite the Tribunal to draw an

Letter from the Respondent to the Tribunal dated 11 March 2015, p. 5.

adverse inference from that failure. More specifically, the Claimants stress
that these letters bear the official Garuda seal, and that the Legality Letters
“were received and acknowledged a total of 38 times by three levels of

government”.573
(ii) Main features of the disputed documents

With respect to the Payment Letters (documents nos. 5-6 in the Document
Table), the Respondent disputes the authenticity of the letter dated
4 December 2007, with decree number 173/02.188.45/XII/2007, requesting
from PT IR the payment of “provisioning of territory”, a fixed contribution of
general survey and a seriousness security. 5* The Respondent also
challenges the authenticity of another letter of 4 December 2007, with
decree number 174/02.188.45/XII/2007, requesting the same payments
from PT INP.*’5 Both these letters are on letterhead with the emblem of the
Regency of East Kutai with the date just below that letterhead. They bear
the signature of Mr. Ishak, which partly overlaps with the official Garuda
seal. The following depicts the signature in the PT IR Payment Letter:576

7H. AWANG FAROEK ISHAK

The Legality Letters (documents nos. 11-14 in the Document Table)
addressed to the four Ridlatama companies are dated 8 April 2008. They
refer to letters sent by Ridlatama of 12 February 2008 requesting certificates
of legality. They are all on letterhead with the emblem of the Regency, bear
a decree number, a date below the letterhead, and the signature of
Mr. Ishak partly overlapping with the official Garuda seal.

Finally, the Cooperation Letters (documents nos. 7-10 in the Document
Table) are also dated 8 April 2008 and refer to the Ridlatama application
letters of 14 February 2008 regarding the implementation of cooperation
between the four Ridlatama companies and PT ICD, the local investment
vehicle of the Claimants.%78 It is noteworthy that the letterhead does not
show the emblem of the Regency, and that the date is not below the
letterhead but above the signature of Mr. Ishak. They contain a decree
number. The signature of Mr. Ishak again overlaps with the official Garuda
seal.

(iii) Assessment

For essentially the same reasons as for the mining licenses, the Tribunal is
of the view that the reproduction of Mr. Ishak’s signature was not authorized.
First, similar to their findings on the disputed mining licenses (see above
paragraphs 288-302), both forensic experts agree that the signatures of
Mr. Ishak were not handwritten. They further agree that they are high quality
reproductions. The experts also agree that the signatures are identical and
were reproduced using the master signature for the mining licenses. The

Tribunal has therefore no hesitation to find that these signatures were
reproduced with the same device as the signatures on the mining licenses.

Second, Mr. Ishak confirmed that he never signed or authorized his
signature to be placed on these documents.*”° More specifically, he stressed
that he never issued any payment letters or legality letters:5®° “While | was
Regent, | never provided instructions to mining companies to pay a
seriousness bond or other payment obligation in a mining area. The holder
of a mining license is under an obligation to comply with any payment
obligations. The Regent does not separately instruct them to comply with
these obligations”. ®*' This was corroborated by the Claimants’ witness,
Mr. Benjamin, who stated that payment letters were usually sent by the
Mining and Energy Bureau, and that he never saw such letters being issued
by the Regent.5#

The record indeed contains payment letters signed by Mr. Putra, the Head
of the Mining and Energy Bureau,%®? thus confirming the evidence above.
There is no explanation why the Regent himself would have sent similar
requests to Ridlatama. In addition, the Payment Letters of 4 December 2007
are not registered in the Registration Book of Decrees and the entries for
that date show a different sequence of decree numbers.*®

Third, the oddities described above, in particular the fact that the
Cooperation and Legality Letters issued on the same date by the same
Regent's office use different letterheads, buttress the finding that the

The decree numbers of the Payment Letters addressed to PT INP and PT IR are
173/02.188.45/XII/2007 and 174/02.188.45/XII/2007, respectively. The Registration
Book of Decrees shows for the date of 4 December 2007 a numbering sequence going
from 659/02.188.45/HK/XII/07 to ~=674/02.188.45/HK/XII/07. Furthermore, the
Respondent provided a photograph of page containing a “large blank space” around 4
December 2007, confirming that there were no entries other than the numbers 655 to
658, which otherwise do not correspond to the numbers of the impugned payment
letters. See: R-PHB2, note 56 and Annex B, p. 3; Resubmitted Pages from Regency

signatures of Mr. Ishak were not placed on these documents with his
authorization.

As a result, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the ancillary documents
at the Regency level, namely the Payment Letters of 4 December 2007, the
Cooperation Letters of 8 April 2008 and the Legality Letters of 8 April 2008,
are not authentic. Mr. Ishak did not sign them nor authorize anyone to place
his signature on them.

b) Ancillary documents at the level of the Province of East
Kalimantan
The ancillary documents bearing Mr. Ishak’s signature when he was
Governor of East Kalimantan are constituted of six Borrow-for-Use
Recommendations, two of December 2009°*° and four of March 2010.56

(i) Parties’ positions

According to the Respondent, a borrow-for-use permit must be obtained
from the Ministry of Forestry if a mining area falls within a production forest
area.**’ The related application for a mining area in East Kutai must include
a recommendation letter from the Governor of the Province of East
Kalimantan and a technical consideration letter from the Director General of
Mineral, Coal and Geothermal of the MEMR.*®#

In this context, the Respondent signals that the Ridlatama companies
submitted two sets of applications to the Ministry of Forestry. The first was
filed on 9 September 2009, and did not contain any recommendation letter
from the Governor or a technical consideration from the Director General at
the MEMR.*° The second was filed in March 2010 with copies of the March
2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations, but without technical consideration
letters.59°

For the Respondent, the March 2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations are
forged, since they contain identical signatures of Mr. Ishak. The Respondent
also points to two other Borrow-for-Use Recommendations dated 29
December 2009, which are essentially identical to the March 2010 letters,
and which, too, contain forged signatures of Mr. Ishak.

The Respondent sees the following indications of forgery. First, Mr. Ishak
testified that he did not sign or authorize that his signature be affixed on
these documents.*' Second, Mr. Epstein determined that the signatures in
these documents are identical, that they were reproduced using the same
master signature, different from the one used to reproduce the disputed
documents analyzed above and issued at the Regency level, and that they
are the product of an autopen.®” Third, the additional strokes next to the
signature are another indication that Mr. Ishak did not sign these
documents, since they are “more consistent with the behavior of a person
forging a signature than an official properly utilizing ‘high quality stamp
impressions’”.5°3 Fourth, the December 2009 and March 2010 Borrow-for-
Use Recommendations are “essentially identical”, ®°* and Ms. Nurohmah
stated that there is no copy of the 2009 Recommendations in the archives of
the Directorate of Utilization of Forest Area in the Ministry of Forestry.5°

For the Claimants, the recommendation letters are not forged. The
Claimants’ witness, Mr. Benjamin, stated that Churchill and PT ICD
requested that Ridlatama apply for borrow-for-use permits “out of any [sic]
abundance of caution’.°°° The Claimants note that the Borrow-for-Use
Recommendations bear the seal of the Governor of East Kalimantan.5%” In
addition, they argue that Mr. Epstein’s failure to address additional ink
strokes added at the end of the signature lines, and which Dr. Strach
addressed in his reports, “casts doubt on the reliability” of Mr. Epstein’s

methods and his conclusion that the signatures are the product of an
autopen.5°2

The Claimants believe that there are two possible explanations for the
identical signatures on these documents. First, “officials at a number of
levels within the Indonesian government used some form of mechanical
process to apply signatures to documents”, thus supporting the Claimants’
good faith authorization theory.5°° Second, these documents are the product
of a “scam” orchestrated within the Regency “as a means of making
Ridlatama think they were progressing”.®° This would have been possible,
so say the Claimants, because Regency officials had access to a master
signature of Mr. Ishak, since many documents issued by the Governor's
office were copied to the Regency.®

(ii) Main features of the disputed documents

The December 2009 and March 2010 Borrow-for-Use Recommendations
relate to the applications for the Ridlatama companies for borrow-for-use
permits. Two recommendation letters dated 29 December 2009 concern PT
RTM and PT RTP.*®? Two further letters dated 11 March 2010 were issued
in respect of PT INP and PT IR.® In addition, two letters concerning PT
RTM and PT RTP are dated 22 March 2010.5

(ii) Assessment

The Tribunal notes that both experts agree that these signatures were not
handwritten, and are the product of some mechanical reproduction. They
also agree that the signatures are essentially identical to each other, but
differ from the signatures of Mr. Ishak in the licenses and ancillary
documents dating from the time when Mr. Ishak was Regent of East Kutai.®°¢
But while Mr. Epstein concluded that the signatures are the product of an
autopen, Dr. Strach expressed the view that “a machine driven fluid ink pen
would be unlikely to replicate such fine detail’, signaling the greater width
variation of the main ink lines of the signatures and some edge detail, small
spots and smudge marks that are replicated on the signatures of the March
recommendation letters.°°”

The following image depicts the fine detail identified by Dr. Strach in the
March 2010 recommendation letters:°°

documents 17 to 20 are marked A, B, C and E. The repeating spot is marked D on
each signature image. Smudge marks adjacent to the signature on document 20 (only)

Dr. Strach further called attention to the presence of several ink lines added
to the ends of the “lowest, almost horizontal strokes of the signatures, and
which are not identical in form to each other and are in a different ink than
the one appearing on the rest of the signature”.°°° The following images

of the signature on document 18”. See also: Strach ER1, ¥ 15.

According to Dr. Strach, the smoothness of the slight curves and tapered
ends suggests that these strokes were written with “some fluency” (to the
exception of the left side of the signature on document 19 (in the image
above) “which appears to have been written more hesitantly (from its non-
smooth shape)”.*'' For the expert, these additional strokes suggest “a
degree of attention to fine detail in the final appearance of the signatures”.
He was, however, unable to assess whether these strokes support a finding
that the signatures are authentic. At any rate, Dr. Strach opines that these
strokes put into question Mr. Epstein’s view that the signatures were
produced using an autopen.®'2

The Parties’ experts also inspected the two 29 December 2009
recommendation letters. Specifically, they inspected the original of the letter

Strach ER1, § 16.

Dr. Strach stated that Mr. Epstein’s “definitive determination of the use of Autopen
technology becomes more questionable particularly in regard to these four signatures
which contain small handwritten additional strokes”. Strach ER1, § 19.

146

concerning PT RTP and only a copy of the letter concerning PT RTM.®'?
Mr. Epstein here again concluded in favor of an autopen.®'* He also added
that these two signatures “are from the same Autopen model that produced
the previously identified disputed signatures” in the March 2010

recommendation letters.6'5

For his part, Dr. Strach agreed that the signature in the 29 December 2009
PT RTP letter “matches the general form of the signatures” found in the
March 2010 recommendation letters, including the fine detail, an extra dot,
and the additional strokes in different ink form.'® This additional ink is
“optically indistinguishable” from the ink additions in the 2010 March letters,
although this “does not mean that one pen or ink type has been used as
many pens would be in existence with such indistinguishable ink”.®'7 Dr.
Strach also pointed to a faint string of ink marks at the upper left of the main
signature line, which was not observed in the 2010 March letters. On that
basis, Dr. Strach opined that “it is probable that the signature was produced
by some form of inked impression (such as a high quality stamp impression
or other form of printing)”. As to autopen technology, he deemed it unlikely,
but did not rule it out.61

With respect to the PT RTM recommendation letter dated 29 December
2009, Dr. Strach only inspected a .pdf reproduction, but confirmed that the
“general form of the signature corresponds to the form of signatures” on the
March 2010 recommendation letters. However, Dr. Strach stressed that the
ends of the lowest stroke “differ from most of the corresponding ends” on the
other five recommendation letters. While he could not identify the same fine
detail as in the PT RTP recommendation letter, he found that the small spot
in the PT RTM recommendation letter is “in the same position relative to the
signature” observed in the other five recommendation letters.*'9 Because the
document is a reproduction, Dr. Strach stated that he could not determine
whether the same technology was used to reproduce the signature in the PT

RTM recommendation letter as in the other disputed recommendation
letters. However, he conceded that it seemed “plausible that the actual
original ink signature which has been reproduced and observed on the PDF
image may have been produced using the same technology as was used to
produce” the other signatures in the recommendation letters. The expert
again was inclined to find that the signature was produced by “some form of
inked impression (such as a high quality stamp impression or other form of
printing)” and that autopen was possible “but considered unlikely” .°°

For largely the same reasons as for the disputed documents at the Regency
level, the Tribunal concludes that the signatures under scrutiny here were
not authorized and are the product of a mechanical device. The Tribunal has
already weighed the evidence of the Parties’ experts in relation to the
identical signatures at the Regency level, and prefers the evidence of the
Respondent’s expert Mr. Epstein. That conclusion seems to apply equally
here (see paragraph 302 above).

Mr. Ishak also confirmed that he did not sign these letters and did not
authorize the reproduction of his signature.®' It is further striking that there
are two versions of recommendation letters for PT RTM and PT RTP, one
from December 2009 and the other from March 2010. Mr. Benjamin’s
explanation that the former concerned land use above the surface and the
latter land use above and below the surface ®? was rebutted by Ms.
Nurohmah who stated that, for borrow-for-use permits, the Ministry of
Forestry does not “differentiate whether it’s activity above the surface or
activities for below the surface”.*3 Neither is there any explanation in the
record for the fact that only one series was submitted to the Ministry of
Forestry.64

It is also striking that both the Regency and the Province would have used
the same technology, especially when one considers that the witnesses
concur that such technology was unknown within these administrations.

These facts rather point to forgery carried out outside the administrations,
hence to unauthorized documents. The Claimants’ explanation that the
documents were generated within the Regency, since officials at the
Regency had access to the master signature of Mr. Ishak in his capacity as
Governor, is speculation.

Finally, the strokes, which were manually added at the end of the signature
lines, show that Mr. Ishak did not produce those signatures. The Tribunal
tends to agree with the Respondent that such strokes are rather “consistent
with the behavior of a person forging a signature than an official properly
utilizing ‘high quality stamp impressions’ to impart Mr. Ishak’s signature to a
document in the ordinary course of business” .®5

In conclusion, the Borrow-for-Use Recommendations buttress the Tribunal’s
finding that Mr. Ishak’s signatures were reproduced without his
authorization. This finding also supports the theory of the existence of a
scheme to produce false official documents.

c) Ancillary documents at the level of the central Government

The Respondent also disputes the authenticity of four Technical
Considerations dated 22 September 2010 bearing the signature of the
Director General of Mineral, Geothermal and Coal at the MEMR,
Mr. Bambang Setiawan.*6 A technical consideration letter from the MEMR is
required in addition to a recommendation letter from the Governor of East
Kalimantan, if a mining company wishes to obtain a borrow-for-use permit
from the Ministry of Forestry in order to conduct mining activities in a forestry
area located, as it were, in East Kutai. After setting out the Parties’ positions
(i), the Tribunal will assess the features of the disputed documents (ii) and
conduct its assessment (iii).

According to the Respondent, the Technical Considerations are not
authentic, which confirms that a scheme to defraud the Republic of
Indonesia was put in place. ®7 The Respondent mainly relies on

Mr. Epstein’s report according to which the signatures of Mr. Setiawan are
identical and were produced by an autopen using the same master
signature.© It also invokes the testimony of Mr. Setiawan that he always
signed official documents by hand and “never authorized anyone to sign or
place my signature on any such letters”.©? These facts were confirmed by
Mr. Djalil, former Head of the General Affairs and Employment Division of
the Directorate General of Mineral and Coal, who stated that Mr. Setiawan
“always personally signs letters by hand” and that the MEMR does not use
autopen devices.®° Mr. Epstein’s review of other signatures of Mr. Setiawan
showed “the natural variation of Mr. Setiawan signing his name’.®"

The Respondent further stresses the following elements: (i) the letter
numbers belong to other authentic letters signed by Mr. Setiawan with a
different subject matter and date;®? (ii) the letters contain an incorrect civil
servant identification number (NIP) of Mr. Setiawan;® (iii) the Claimants’
reference to a letter in English signed by Mr. Setiawan without his NIP is
unhelpful since, under the prescribed MEMR format, letters written in
English must not include the NIP;§* (iv) the letters use the wrong font
(Times New Roman instead of Arial) and the stamp refers to MEMR as
Department (Departemen) rather than Ministry (Kementarian), the latter
being employed after May 2010;85 (v) the letters contain a signature, stamp

indicated that the technical consideration letter was not included in
Ridlatama’s 9 September 2009 and 13 March 2010 borrow-for-use permit
applications.®°

The Respondent also calls attention to the fact that Mr. Setiawan stated that
he did not recognize the two initials appearing near Mr. Setiawan’s
signature.®° According to his testimony, the initials should be those of the
then-Secretary of the Directorate General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal,
Dr. Ir. Soemarno Witoro Soelamo, and the then-Director responsible for
MEMR’s_ technical considerations in forestry matters, Ir. Tatang
Sabaruddin.*° This is corroborated, so the Respondent argues, by the fact
that Messrs. Witoro and Tatang’s initials appear in other letters (for instance,
number 2690) from the same day (22 September 2010).

Lastly, Indonesia refers to Dr. Strach, who acknowledges that the signatures
in these documents have some characteristics of autopen signatures,
including the uniform pen pressure, blunt ends and smooth lines. The expert
also did not rule out a faulty autopen type process to explain the relatively
large deposit of ink with a faint ink trail to the left of the signature in three of
the four letters.®? Indonesia further emphasizes that Dr. Strach failed to
identify any stamp or printing method able to generate such high quality
reproductions.*

Similarly to the recommendation letters, the Claimants provide two possible
explanations for the identical signatures on the consideration letters. First,

mechanical devices are used at various governmental levels to reproduce
signatures of officials, including the signature of Mr. Setiawan at the MEMR
(good faith authorization). ** Second, having access to Mr. Setiawan’s
master signature, the Regency orchestrated a “scam” and fabricated the
consideration letters “as a means of making Ridlatama think they were
progressing” (bad faith authorization).®5

While the Claimants agree that Mr. Setiawan’s signatures on the disputed
documents “cannot be the product of human handwriting as they are,
essentially, identical”, © they dispute Mr. Epstein’s opinion that the
signatures are the product of an autopen.®” They further stress that the
Respondent did not dispute the authenticity of the seal partly overlapping
with Mr. Setiawan’s signature.*® According to the Claimants, Mr. Epstein’s
“cursory conclusions” fail to provide the Tribunal “with the means by which to
assess objectively his conclusions that the signatures were a result of an
Autopen device” .&9

In particular, the Claimants argue that Mr. Epstein does not address the
discrete features of the signatures, such as the fluidity of the ink, the tip-
width of the alleged writing instrument, the pressure and density of the
writing and any alterations or artefacts on or around the writing.®° The
Claimants also cite to the “detailed report” of Dr. Strach, which, in addition to
such aspects as pen pressure, ink-line width, microscopic appearance, and
infrared properties, identified “incidental marks” which are marked as “A”,
“B”, “C”, and “D” in the images below:®'

a faint ink ‘trail’ and share the same ink characteristics as the signature and
its surrounding artefacts” .%2

The Claimants also point to the Respondent's failure to produce additional
consideration letters to test the testimony of Messrs. Setiawan and Djalil.6?
However, for the Claimants, the six Nusantara consideration letters in the
record suffice to “raise real questions” about the reliability of the evidence
given by Messrs. Setiawan and Djalil, especially because they contain
“several of the same irregularities” identified with respect to the disputed
MENMR letters.

First, the letterheads of the Nusantara consideration letters also use the
word Kementarian (Department), while the stamp uses the word
Departemen. ®> Second, Mr. Djalil is wrong when he states that from
December 2009 Mr. Setiawan affixed the Kementarian stamp since the
document he relies on, dated 21 December 2009, also uses the
Departemen stamp. ®¢ Third, a letter signed by Mr. Setiawan on
21 September 2010 does not contain his NIP at all.8°’ Fourth, Mr. Djalil did
not dispute the authenticity of the initials next to Mr. Setiawan’s signature
and the Respondent failed to provide an explanation “for whose initials these
are or how these apparently authentic initials were placed on supposedly
fabricated documents”.®58

Fifth, the copies of the MEMR register produced by the Respondent “appear
to be missing key information”.*°° Two entries on 21 September 2010 appear
to have been covered and five entries on 22 September 2010 are
completely blank.®° Therefore, the Claimants argue that “it may be that the
disputed MEMR Letters are recorded elsewhere in the MEMR register”.®' In

addition, other notations in the 21-23 September 2010 extract do not include
recipient names.*2 Moreover, the Respondent failed to produce documents
signed by Mr. Setiawan on 23 September 2010 and “numerous documents
in the 21-22 September register extract”.*? Sixth and finally, the Claimants
note that the maps attached to the Nusantara technical letters depict the
four Ridlatama blocks and do “not show any Nusantara companies

overlapping with the Ridlatama blocks”.®*+
(ii) Main features of the disputed documents

The four disputed letters dated 22 September 2010 from Mr. Setiawan,
Director General of Mineral, Coal and Geothermal at the MEMR, relate to
Technical Considerations for PT RTM, PT RTP, PT INP and PT IR’s borrow-
for-use forestry permit applications.®*° Each letter comprises a decision letter
and a summary of the application for borrow-for-use permits submitted by
the respective Ridlatama company. The decision letter refers to an
application letter of the respective Ridlatama company and supports the
company’s application. It is drafted on the letterhead of the Ministry
(Kementarian) of Energy and Mineral Resources. The decree number and
the issuance date are shown below the letterhead. The signature of
Mr. Setiawan is at the end of the decision letter and, as seen in the image in
paragraph 416 above, partly overlaps with the official seal, which refers to
the Department (Departemen) of Energy and Mineral Resources. There is
also a personal identification number (NIP) below Mr. Setiawan’s signature.
Finally, two initials are located to the right and left of Mr. Setiawan’s
signature.
(iii) Assessment

The Tribunal starts by noting that the Parties’ experts agree that the
disputed signatures were not handwritten and that they are identical high
quality reproductions.

As to the technology employed, the Tribunal favors Mr. Epstein’s view of an
autopen, also because Dr. Strach was unable to name another method

C-Answers, ¥ 42.

424.

425.

resulting in high quality reproductions and could not rule out that the ink
deposits and faint ink trails were the product of a faulty autopen.®°

The ink marks which Dr. Strach highlighted do not seem to justify a contrary
conclusion. Dr. Strach does not draw clear inferences from such marks
identified as “A” to “D” in image in paragraph 416 above. In particular with
respect to mark “D”, Dr. Strach confirmed that the ink properties were
“different from those of neighbouring stamp impressions, print and
(handwritten) ink initials’, and that it was “similar to that of the signature ink
line apart from being darker/more intense near the centre of the larger dark
mark”. 67 In the end, Dr. Strach conceded that he did “not have a full
explanation of mark ‘D”, but that a “feasible explanation” is that it is “the
edge or matrix edge effect of an otherwise high quality stamp impression”.6*°
By contrast, as was discussed earlier, the Respondent provided evidence
that autopens may produce such marks.

Furthermore, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt Mr. Setiawan’s testimony,
which was confirmed by Mr. Djalil, that he always signs official documents
by hand. The Tribunal also finds that the anomalies identified on the
disputed documents further corroborate the Respondent's case. This is
particularly so in respect of (i) the outdated NIP number of Mr. Setiawan,%?
(ii) the incorrect designation of the MEMR as a Department (Departemen),
whereas the term Ministry (Kementarian) was used after May 2010 when the
transitory period ended, and (iii) the two initials which Mr. Setiawan did not
recognize in combination with the absence of the initials of Messrs. Witoro
and Tatang. In contrast to Mr. Setiawan, Mr. Djalil did not mention in his
witness statement that he failed to recognize the two initials surrounding
Mr. Setiawan’s signature, but the Tribunal notes in this respect that the
Claimants did not question Mr. Djalil on this issue during cross-examination
and provided no further explanations in this regard in their subsequent
submissions. Therefore, the Tribunal has no reason to doubt Mr. Setiawan’s
testimony on these initials. The Tribunal further notes that, in the same way

outdated and that a new NIP had been issued since 2008. Tr. (Day 5), 72:23-73:15,

as with the recommendation letters addressed further above, the Claimants’
explanation that the documents were generated within the Regency as part
of a “scam” to mislead the Ridlatama companies is speculative.

Finally, the fact that an autopen or similarly sophisticated device was used
to reproduce signatures at yet a third level of Government reinforces the
probable existence of a scheme to fabricate official documents to provide a
mantle of legitimacy to Ridlatama’s operations in the EKCP. This
assessment is further supported by the review of the last set of disputed
documents, namely the Re-Enactment Decrees.

d) The Re-Enactment Decrees

The Respondent also claims that the four Re-Enactment Decrees of 14 May
2010 are forged (documents nos. 25-28 in the Document Table). After
setting out the Parties’ positions (i), the Tribunal will detail the main features
of the disputed documents (ii) and proceed to its assessment (iii).

(i) Parties’ positions

For the Respondent, the Re-Enactment Decrees “never made sense”, as
they were allegedly issued just 10 days after Mr. Noor revoked the
Ridlatama exploitation upgrades. The Respondent also notes that the
Claimants have been reluctant to address these Re-Enactment Decrees.
When they did, their position changed multiple times “moving from silence to
‘bemusement’ to ‘confusion’ to ‘no position’ and now to ‘bad faith
authorization’””.67°

The Respondent invokes the following elements in support of forgery,
irrespective of the fact that Mr. Noor’s evidence is disregarded because he
did not appear at the hearing.®’' First, the forensic experts agree that
Mr. Noor’s signatures were not handwritten and that they are identical.®72
Second, Mr. Ramadani testified that he prepared the Revocation Decrees,
but that the Legal Section did not prepare Re-Enactment Decrees.*73 Third,
Mr. Ramadani also stated that Mr. Noor did not authorize his signature being

placed on the disputed documents,®”4 a fact corroborated by a letter from
Mr. Noor dated 7 October 2010.75 Fourth, the Re-Enactment Decrees bear
numbers that belong to other documents and are not registered in the 2010
Regency Registration Book for Decrees. ®’ Fifth, Mr. Ordiansyah called
attention to the fact that the decrees have no maps and that the PLTR
Spatial Planning database shows that the mining areas belong to
Nusantara.®”’ Sixth, as Mr. Ramadani explained, the practice of the Regency
was to issue new licenses to reinstate a revoked license, as opposed to
issuing re-enactment decrees. ®® Seventh, the Claimants’ witness,
Mr. Benjamin, testified that he had never heard of or seen the Re-Enactment
Decrees. °° Eighth, the Claimants provided no evidence of protests by
Ridlatama or the Claimants, which allegedly caused Mr. Noor to revoke the
Revocation Decrees and re-enact the exploitation upgrades.®° Ninth, the
Claimants started proceedings in the Samarinda Administrative Court to
seek a revocation of the Revocation Decrees, and provided no cogent
reason for doing so when the Re-Enactment Decrees expressly stated that
the revocation was no longer valid.®'

The Respondent also submits that the Claimants had a clear motive to forge
the Re-Enactment Decrees, since Churchill would have been under an
obligation to publicly disclose the revocation under the London Stock
Exchange rules, which would have jeopardized Churchill's offering of
securities and caused a collapse of the share price.*®?

Finally, the Respondent argues that the Claimants’ bad faith authorization
theory is “rife with speculation” and that they provide “no evidence” to
corroborate their position.

For the Claimants, once Mr. Noor’s testimony is struck out or disregarded,
the only evidence on record to impugn the Re-Enactment Decrees is (i) the
undisputed expert evidence that Mr. Noor’s signature was not applied by
hand, (ii) Mr. Ramadani’s evidence that the numbers on the Re-Enactment
Decrees are used on other decrees, and (iii) Mr. Noor’s letter of 7 October
2010.8 According to the Claimants, these elements are insufficient for a
finding of forgery. The Claimants contend that with respect to (ii), wrong
decree numbers “could be attributable to simple clerical error’, and with
respect to (iii), that the evidentiary value of the 7 October 2010 letter is
“severely compromised” by Mr. Noor’s refusal to attend the hearing.*®+

In the alternative, the Claimants submit that there is a basis for finding that
the Re-Enactment Decrees were authorized “but in the bad faith sense”.®®>
The Re-Enactment Decrees were mainly favorable to Mr. Noor; he could
“play both sides” by inducing Ridlatama and the Claimants to believe that
their rights were safe, while assuring Nusantara that “for the right price, the
re-enactment decrees could be denied and the EKCP could be given to
them”.®6 The Re-Enactment Decrees provided a means to Mr. Noor to delay
passing the mining areas to Nusantara “while he tried to extract improper
payments from Ridlatama’”. Indeed, the 7 October 2010 letter was issued six
months later, providing Mr. Noor “more than enough time to hold an ‘auction’
of rights to the EKCP”.®87

The Claimants further argue that, even if the Re-Enactment Decrees were
found not to be authorized, this would only affect their claim for restitution of
amounts spent between the Claimants’ receipt of the Re-Enactment
Decrees and the dismissal of their action in the Samarinda Administrative
Court.588

(ii) Main features of the disputed documents

revoked by Mr. Noor on 4 May 2010.%° Through these decrees, Mr. Noor
purported to (i) re-enact the four Ridlatama exploitation upgrades of 27
March 2009, (ii) declare all other related licenses to be valid again, and (iii)
revoke the Revocation Decrees of 4 May 2010. The letters are drafted on
letterhead with the emblem of the Regency of East Kutai and a decree
number on the first page. The signature block with Mr. Noor’s signature and
the date are on the last page.

Dr. Strach called attention to the variation in width of the signature lines,
including a “pronounced taper at the right end of the main component of the
signature”.® He also identified “very small spots” towards the left of each
signature and two “closely spaced fine small strokes” to the right and below
the tapered end of the main part of each signature.®' Dr. Strach further
mentioned a “repeated sudden narrowing” near the top of the second arch of
an “m” like feature, and “repeated smudge like marks above and below the
left extremity of the rising lower line associated with each signature” .°°2

(ii) Assessment

The record shows that the Re-Enactment Decrees are neither authentic nor
authorized, which significantly reinforces the Respondent’s case that a

scheme was put in place to fabricate documents.

Several facts are undisputed. The Parties agree that Mr. Noor signed the
Revocation Decrees dated 4 May 2010. Their experts agree that Mr. Noor
did not sign the Re-Enactment Decrees, that the signatures in all four
decrees are identical, and that they are high quality reproductions.5% The
Re-Enactment Decrees were issued just ten days after the Revocation
Decrees.

Beyond these established facts, the record is less clear cut. As to the
technology employed, Dr. Strach is again unable to identify one, other than
autopen, that could produce such high quality signatures.

Further, the date of the Re-Enactment Decrees raises serious doubts. Why

should a government revoke a license one day and reinstate it ten days
later? If the Claimants’ re-enactment theory were to reflect reality, one would

Epstein ER2, p. 8; Strach ER1, 9 21.

161

442.

443.

expect to find cogent evidence for the reasons of such an unusual fact
pattern. However, the record reveals none. While the Tribunal has
insufficient facts to link the Re-Enactment Decrees to the disclosure
obligations for companies quoted on the London Stock Exchange, it is struck
by the fact that Mr. Benjamin, a witness presented by the Claimants who at
the relevant time was PT ICD’s Director/President and was in regular
contact with the Claimants’ partners from Ridlatama, knew of the revocation
but had never heard of the re-enactment. ®° Had it been real, the re-
enactment would have been a major development for the Claimants’
business, certainly worth reporting to close friends and associates, and in
particular to Mr. Benjamin who was managing the Claimants’ local
investment vehicle.

Another aspect weighing against the Claimants’ argumentation lies in
Mr. Ramadani’s assertion, confirmed by Mr. Sianipar, that new licenses, not
re-enactment decrees reviving revoked licenses, would have been issued, if
at all.°°° This statement seems plausible and there is nothing in the record to
contradict it.

Finally, the Claimants’ bad faith authorization theory, according to which
Mr. Noor sought to “play both sides” is speculative and unsupported by
facts.°°” The Claimants also argued that Mr. Noor acted “inconsistently at
times”, notably when sending a letter on 3 September 2009 to the
Alternative Investment Market of the London Stock Exchange (“AIM”)
informing that Ridlatama’s licenses had been forged, while sending letters to
the Ministry of Forestry on the same day supporting Ridlatama’s forestry
permits.6°® Due to Mr. Noor’s failure to appear at the hearing, the Tribunal
has no further information on the circumstances surrounding Mr. Noor’s
conduct on that occasion. However, the Tribunal simply notes that this
allegedly inconsistent conduct, even if assumed to be true for present
purposes, is insufficient to prove “erratic decision-making” by Mr. Noor in
May 2010. ® Indeed, the Claimants failed to provide any credible

explanation why the Revocation Decrees were signed by hand while the Re-
Enactment Decrees were signed with a mechanical device.

On that basis, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that the disputed Re-
Enactment Decrees are neither authentic nor authorized. Their existence
significantly weakens the Claimants’ position on all other documents.
Indeed, the Tribunal specifically asked the Parties about the effect on the
Claimants’ overall case if only the signatures in the Re-Enactment Decrees
were unauthentic or unauthorized. In their response, the Claimants accepted
that, if the Tribunal were to find that the Re-Enactment Decrees were not
authorized, it “could add weight” to the Respondent's case “against the other
disputed documents”. While a finding that the Re-Enactment Decrees are
unauthentic and unauthorized is not necessary to reach the same
conclusion for the other impugned documents, the fact that the Re-
Enactment Decrees were most likely generated through the same
technology shows a recurrent pattern of forgery.

2.5. Who forged the disputed documents?

The Tribunal now turns to the factual question of the authorship of the
disputed documents, starting with the Parties’ positions (a) followed by its
assessment (b).

a) Parties’ positions
The Respondent argues that “evidence of ‘how’ the impugned documents
were signed is clear and goes a long way to answering ‘who’ did so”.7°' For
the Respondent, Ridlatama signed the documents.’ Only Ridlatama had,
so says the Respondent, the “motive, means or opportunity to fabricate”
these documents.”

Prior to the hearing, the Respondent's primary contention was that
Ridlatama was the sole responsible party and that the Claimants were
duped. According to the Respondent, Ridlatama fabricated the disputed
documents and disseminated them to various government agencies to
create a mantle of legitimacy in a larger scheme to defraud the Republic of

Indonesia. The Respondent thereafter argued that the hearing revealed that
Mr. Mazak, Churchill's Managing Director, was involved in the fraud, which
demonstrated the Claimants’ complicity. * For the Respondent, “the
testimony of Claimants’ witnesses describing the actions of Mr. Mazak
undercut any notion that he was an unwitting dupe of Ridlatama”.7°5

The Respondent explains that it was Mr. Mazak who built up the relationship
with Ridlatama and was responsible for Churchill’s day-to-day operations in
Indonesia through PT ICD.7° Following the disappointing results in the
Sendawar Coal Project, by 2007 he was under pressure to come up with a
viable project in the EKCP.7°7

More specifically, Indonesia highlighted the following facts allegedly showing
Mr. Mazak’s participation in the fraud scheme: (i) he forwarded the “copy
and paste” PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses to Mr. Gunter in May

Agreements concluded between PT ICD and Ridlatama.’'*

By contrast, the Claimants dispute that the documents were fabricated by
Ridlatama and that they were involved in a fraud. As a primary argument,
they rely on their theory of good faith authorization, namely that the disputed
documents were generated with authorization within the respective

government agencies. Alternatively, the Claimants put forward their bad faith
authorization theory, which implies that someone within the Regency applied
Mr. Ishak’s signature “as part of a design” to make the licenses “plausibly
deniable”.7'5

In connection with the argument of bad faith authorization, Churchill and
Planet allege that Mr. Putra’s involvement in processing the disputed
licenses was “extensive”, as he (i) drafted the 2007 staff analysis; (ii) co-
signed the spatial analyses for the PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses;
(iii) coordinated and initialed the draft decrees for PT RTM and PT RTP; (iv)
drafted the Nusantara staff analysis of 19 May 2008; and (v) liaised with Mr.
Noor in processing and issuing the Exploitation Licenses.’'® The Claimants
also stress that the authenticity of the official Garuda seal partly overlapping
with the disputed signatures is unchallenged, which further corroborates that
the contentious documents were produced within the government agencies.

According to the Claimants, this bad faith scenario would allow the Regency,
if the Claimants and Ridlatama later discovered commercially viable coal
reserves (which they did), to “deny it ever granted Ridlatama exploration
rights and offer to re-licence the proven ground to Nusantara (or any other
party) — for a price”.7'7

This scam, so the Claimants say, includes the fabrication of the documents
from other agencies, such as the Technical Recommendation “as a means
of making Ridlatama think they were progressing”.’'"® The Claimants further
argue that the Re-Enactment Decrees made it possible for Mr. Noor to “play
both sides” by letting Ridlatama and the Claimants believe that their rights
were safe, while at the same time assuring Nusantara that the Re-
Enactment Decrees could be denied and the EKCP given to it “for the right
price”.”'9 Finally, even if Ridlatama was involved in a fraudulent scheme, so
say the Claimants, Mr. Ishak’s testimony implicating “some kind of

corruption” between Mr. Putra and Ridlatama shows that there is no basis
“for a finding that Ridlatama acted alone”.”2°

b) Assessment

The signatures not being authentic, it mainly remains now for the Tribunal to
determine who generated the contentious documents, including whether
they were created within or outside the relevant governmental agencies and
what role Ridlatama and the Claimants played, if any.

On the Respondent's side, three possible explanations are advanced. First,
the disputed documents were fabricated by Ridlatama and the Claimants
were duped victims, who must bear the risks inherent in the choice of their
business partners. Second, the Claimants themselves were involved in the
fraud. The third explanation was added by Mr. Ishak at the hearing when
envisaging a corrupt official within the Regency of East Kutai.72' On the
basis of facts which emerged at the hearing, Indonesia insisted on the
second scenario as being the one which should be accepted by the
Tribunal.

For their part, the Claimants deny being involved in any fraud and
essentially argue that the documents were generated within the Regency
either with the authorization of Mr. Ishak or as a result of an official
exceeding his powers. According to them, there is no evidence of fraud or
corruption by Ridlatama. At any rate, Mr. Ishak’s apologies to Churchill
during the hearing show that the Claimants are victims and not offenders in
the event that there was corruption.722

For the Claimants, the Respondent's new accusations that Churchill
structured its investments to facilitate fraud are “ambush”.’2 They explain
that they prepared their defense on the basis of the Respondent's
allegations prior to the hearing that only Ridlatama was involved in the fraud,
not the Claimants or PT ICD.724 In any event, the Claimants argue that even
if Ridlatama were found to have engaged in forgery, this would leave their

claims unaffected since the evidence suggests an “inside job” within the
Regency, the actions of the Regency being attributable to the State.’

The Tribunal has already determined above that there was insufficient
evidence to uphold the Claimants’ bad faith authorization theory. Indeed,
there is no proof that someone within the Regency issued “plausibly
deniable”’s licenses and fabricated the other disputed documents to satisfy
the expectations of Ridlatama and the Claimants that the approval
processes were properly advancing. There is no evidence that the Regency
or any Regency official was in possession of an autopen or similarly
sophisticated technology. It is not established either that Regency officials
requested payments from Ridlatama to keep the disputed mining rights or
from Nusantara to obtain rights to the EKCP. Moreover, there is no evidence
that Nusantara conspired to strip Ridlatama of its mining rights, for instance,
by inducing Regency officials to revoke the mining licenses. Nor are there
indications that Mr. Noor was seeking to “play both sides” ”” so as to auction
off the mining rights to the highest bidder. Therefore, the Tribunal finds that
this bad faith scenario does not assist in ascertaining the author of the
forgery.

Although the record does not support the Claimants’ bad faith authorization
claim, a number of facts demonstrate that someone within the Regency
assisted in the process of introducing the fabricated documents into the
Regency’s databases and archives, thereby assisting in creating an
appearance of legitimacy to the fraudulent scheme. Various elements, such
as the staff analysis prepared by Mr. Putra, the spatial analyses prepared by
Mr. Ordiansyah and signed by Mr. Putra, and the draft decrees, show that
the mining applications of PT RTM and PT RTP were processed within the
Regency until the penultimate stage. In particular, the draft decrees were
circulated to the five heads of departments who affixed their initials in the
coordination box. However, as was seen above, Mr. Ishak never signed
these draft decrees, although his signature should have been affixed first on
these draft decrees, as Mr. Ramadani convincingly explained.728

730

Even more significant for present purposes is the fact that, in addition to
Mr. Putra’s initials in the coordination boxes of the two draft decrees, his
initials also appear in three other places in each draft decree (i.e., in the
decision letter, the attachment setting out the obligations of the license
holder, and the attached map) next to the space where Mr. Ishak was
supposed to affix his signature.

Another element pointing towards Mr. Putra’s involvement is the fact that the
disputed Survey Licenses for PT RTM and PT RTP were entered in the
register book of the Legal Section. A similar indication can be seen in Mr.
Ramadani’s testimony according to which the registrar told him that it was
Mr. Putra who requested the registration and promised to provide the signed
decrees at a later time, which he never did.

By contrast, the official Garuda seal which partly overlaps with the fabricated
signatures does not appear a conclusive element. The Claimants relied on
Dr. Strach’s expertise to argue that the Garuda seal was applied after the
disputed signatures and thus showed that the disputed documents were
generated within the Regency. The Respondent replied that anyone could
fabricate these seals until 2012, when the Regency introduced heightened
security measures following various instances of abuse. In reality, Dr. Strach
stated that he was unable to ascertain the exact sequence of the placement
of the signatures and the seal without further tests. On that basis and
considering Mr. Kurniawan’s testimony on the recurrent falsification of the
Garuda seal prior to 2012, the Tribunal is unable to draw any useful
conclusion from the presence of the Garuda seal in the disputed documents.

In this context, the Tribunal must address the possibility of corruption.
Corruption only came up at the hearing, when Mr. Ishak was presented with
the staff analysis drawn up by Mr. Putra. The Governor reacted by saying
that there could have been some form of nepotism or corruption between
Mr. Putra and Ridlatama in relation to the EKCP.7% A little later in this
examination, he called the EKCP a “major corruption case in our country”.72°
Mr. Ishak even implied that Mr. Noor was involved in the scheme. On a
follow up question from the Tribunal, he answered as follows:

“Q. [...] You were asked about Mr. Noor and your answer was
not entirely clear, that also Mr. Noor would also possibly be
involved in corruption here. | would like to be clear whether or
not that is the case.

A. | do not know what happened after | left, but what is clear,
one difficulty | have, suddenly the Regent has a private jet. It
doesn’t make sense. An official suddenly has a private jet.
How much it [sic] price for a private jet?”.73"

Mr. Gunter also mentioned that the payment of facilitation fees was
commonplace in Indonesia. He stated, however, that he had no direct
knowledge of any such payments by Ridlatama. Specifically, he stated that
“there is always a facilitation fee that applies to most things here [i.e., in
Indonesia], unfortunately”. While he did not know any specifics regarding
Ridlatama, he “would consider there would need to be” such payments.732

In this context, the Tribunal also recalls that the Claimants sought to obtain,
and the Tribunal ordered, the production of documents relating to
investigations conducted by Indonesia’s Corruption Eradication Commission
("KPK”) with respect to Messrs. Ishak and Noor. The Respondent refused to
produce these documents by invoking privilege, a claim addressed above
(see paragraph 250). Finally, with respect to the Re-Enactment Decrees, the
Tribunal notes that the Claimants have alleged that Mr. Noor was trying to
“play both sides” to auction off the EKCP to the highest bidder.

In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence on record is insufficient to establish that
the issuance of the disputed documents involved corrupt practices. It is true
that corruption is inherently difficult to prove. However, even taking such
difficulty into consideration, there must be facts on the record, at least in the
form of some circumstantial evidence or so-called red flags, that signal the
corruption. General statements such as Mr. Gunter’s testimony, or
suppositions and implications such as Mr. Ishak’s assertions are insufficient.
On that basis alone, the Tribunal is unable to make a finding of corruption.

Having discarded this possibility, the Tribunal goes on reviewing the role of
Ridlatama and the Claimants. In the Tribunal’s view, a number of facts point
to the involvement of an outsider. First, the Respondent's witnesses,
Messrs. Ishak, Armin, Ordiansyah, Ramadani, Djalil and Setiawan, all stated
that they had never heard of an autopen and that official documents were

471.

472.

always signed by hand. The Tribunal has no reason to doubt these
statements, especially since the Claimants’ witnesses confirmed the practice
of hand signatures.733

Second, the same technology, most likely an autopen, was used to
reproduce the disputed signatures at three different levels of the Indonesian
Government, namely the Regency of East Kutai, the province of East
Kalimantan, and the central Government in Jakarta, when none of these
offices used mechanical devices to reproduce signatures on official
documents.

Third, the existence of three different versions of PT RTM and PT RTP
Survey Licenses, including one version with signatures of Mr. Ishak
reproduced with an autopen and another one with his copied and pasted
signatures, strongly suggests that these latter two versions were generated
outside of the Regency. Indeed, it is undisputable that the Gunter
Documents bearing the copied and pasted signatures of Mr. Ishak were
doctored. Further, the use of an autopen, when it has been established that
government offices did not have such a device available, indicates that the
autopen signatures were affixed by an outsider.

Fourth, the exact same signatures of Mr. Ishak which appear on the
disputed mining licenses and other ancillary documents at the Regency level
are also found in two mining licenses granted to Swasembada, a company
which happens to be controlled by directors of Ridlatama. This comes in
addition to the absence of identical signatures in comparator licenses
produced by the Respondent.

Fifth, the existence of the Re-Enactment Decrees, bearing unauthentic
signatures issued ten days after the Revocation Decrees which the then-
Regent Mr. Noor had signed by hand, significantly undermines the
Claimants’ contention that the disputed documents came from within the
Regency. Indeed, the Claimants have provided no credible explanation for
the Re-Enactment Decrees.

Sixth and last, Ridlatama, not the Regency, circulated the disputed licenses
and related documentation to governmental agencies allegedly to ensure
that they received all relevant documentation in case the Regency failed to

474.

provide it. Under normal circumstances, this element would appear neutral,
but in the present context of fabricated signatures, it would support a finding
that Ridlatama was involved in this fraudulent scheme.

The last question which the Tribunal must answer here is whether the
Claimants participated in or had knowledge of the fraud. As mentioned
earlier, until the hearing, the Respondent did not seek to implicate the
Claimants in the fraud, but argued that they must suffer the consequences
of partnering with fraudsters. The Tribunal also notes that Indonesia’s police
initiated criminal investigations on forgery in March 2014, including by
searching PT ICD’s premises, seizing relevant documentation and hard
drives, and interrogating Mr. Benjamin. These investigations have not led to
evidence used by the Respondent in the present proceedings proving that
the Claimants were directly involved in the fraud. With respect to Mr.
Mazak’s alleged involvement, the Tribunal sees no conclusive proof of his or
Churchill's involvement in the fact that he transmitted the “copy and paste”
PT RTM and PT RTP Survey Licenses to Mr. Gunter in May 2007, or that he
gave Ridlatama’s documents to Mr. Benjamin without including the “copy
and paste” license. There is also insufficient evidence that he
“masterminded” the Re-Enactment Decrees, as the Respondent alleges.73+
Finally, the Tribunal fails to see the relevance of the fact that he contacted
Mr. Kurniawan in 2015 in order to obtain the Ridlatama documents in his
possession.

On the other hand, the record shows that the Claimants and Ridlatama were
closely associated and that they liaised regularly during the relevant time.
First, PT ICD was initially established by Ridlatama and then acquired by
Churchill in 2006.75 Second, the Claimants chose their partners because of
their “good connections” with the Indonesian Government, and in particular
with the Regency of East Kutai.”° Third, PT ICD ensured that Ridlatama
circulated the disputed licenses and related documentation to governmental
agencies.”%” Finally, the Tribunal cannot lose sight that the Claimants, and in
particular Churchill, which is quoted on the Alternative Investment Market of
the London Stock Exchange, stood most to gain from the Re-Enactment

Decrees, since they obviated the need to publicly disclose the revocation of
the mining licenses which had occurred ten days earlier.

While these elements suggest that the Claimants may have been involved,
they are insufficient to reach a definitive finding that the Claimants were the
authors or instigators of the forgeries and the fraud.

In summary, the Tribunal is of the view that the forgeries and the fraud were
orchestrated by author(s) outside of the Regency, most likely Ridlatama,
who benefited from the assistance from an insider to introduce the
fabricated documents into the Regency’s databases and archives. While the
record points towards Ridlatama rather than the Claimants in relation to the
forgery of the contentious documents, the Tribunal does not need to make a
definitive finding to draw the proper legal consequences as the analysis
below will show. It suffices for present purposes that, on the basis of the
record, there is no conceivable author other than Ridlatama.

Bearing these facts in mind, the Tribunal now turns to the legal
consequences, and in particular, to the Respondent's request that all of the
Claimants’ claims be dismissed.

Legal consequences
1. Parties’ positions

The Respondent requests that the Tribunal issue an award dismissing all of
the claims brought by the Claimants.7°* In short, the Respondent asserts that
“Claimants cannot bring claims on the basis of forged documents”.7°9 In
addition, the Respondent argues that a finding of forgery of the mining
undertaking licenses has the consequence of “rendering the exploitation
upgrades null and void and thereby eliminating any basis” for the claims
before this Tribunal.’4° This follows, so the Respondent says, from the fact
that all the claims are based on the validity of Ridlatama’s mining rights in

R-PHB1, § 147; R-PHB2, § 50; R-Comments on Minnotte, § 2; R-Reply on Minnotte,

481.

the EKCP.”' In other words, the Respondent argues that there was no
EKCP if the licenses were forged.742

Relying on the maxim nemo dat quod non habet, the Respondent argues
that the Claimants cannot assert claims “on the basis of rights that are non-
existent’’ and that “the beneficiary of a forgery can be in no better position
than the person who committed the forgery.’ Claims arising from the
purported interference with an alleged right obtained by forgery cannot find
substantive protection under the BITs “whether asserted by the culpable
party or its assignee”, even if the Claimants had acted in good faith.’4* To
the Claimants’ argument that the “vast majority” of their investments would
remain legally valid and unaffected by a finding of forgery, the Respondent
objects that the Claimants raised no claims arising from investments
unrelated to the EKCP.74

The Respondent further stresses that the forgery of the disputed licenses
“informed the decision to revoke the exploitation upgrades”.”4” But even if
the upgrades were revoked for a reason other than forgery, these forgeries
must lead to the dismissal of the claims. Indeed, allowing the claims to
continue in these circumstances “would be tantamount to rewarding conduct
that is blatantly illegal and to endorsing Ridlatama’s strategy of laundering
forged documents”.’48 According to the Respondent, such a result would be
incompatible with “international law, Indonesian law and any system of law’,
contrary to international public policy, and seriously damaging to the
administration of justice.”

The Respondent also submits that the Claimants were not good faith
investors and did not exercise “a reasonable level of due diligence in
investigating the forgery of the impugned licenses”; nor did they behave like

a “reasonably prudent investor in the circumstances”. ° They were aware of
the risks involved in investing in the Indonesian mining sector and “forgery
was not an implausible risk” in view of the problem of overlapping
licenses. 75' Moreover, there is prima facie evidence, according to the
Respondent, that Mr. Mazak was complicit in the fraudulent scheme.’ At
the very least, “Mr. Mazak was reckless or negligent in his dealings with
Ridlatama and shut his eyes to what would have been obvious”.’5? For the
Respondent, Mr. Mazak’s role evinces that the Claimants were either
“complicit in the forgeries or deliberately ignored evidence of wrongdoing
and resisted further bona fide inquiries into it”.75+

In addition, so says the Respondent, the Claimants did nothing to
independently verify the authenticity of the disputed documents when
allegations of forgery were first uttered in 2009 and “deliberately chose not
to address this issue”.’> The Claimants deliberately closed their eyes to a
number of red flags, which should have alerted them to “the very probable
fact of forgery”.’°° Therefore, the Claimants should not be entitled to raise
any “additional claims” against the Respondent.’5”

Finally, the Respondent considers that the alternative legal theories invoked
by the Claimants, namely estoppel, acquiescence, legitimate expectations,
unjust enrichment, and international wrongful composite act, have no
merit. 78 According to the Respondent, the evidence at the hearing
“effectively precludes Claimants from meeting the legal criteria applicable”
under these theories.”°°

By contrast, the Claimants reply that a finding of forgery would not be
dismissive of the entire case. The effect of a finding of forgery on the validity

of the exploitation licenses would still need to be determined. 7° The
Claimants consider these licenses to be “stand-alone administrative acts”
that “perfected title” to the EKCP,’*' and are therefore “prima facie lawful
and efficacious”.”*? The Claimants further argue that, even if the Tribunal
held that the exploitation upgrades were invalid, it would have to decide
which of the claims remain unaffected.

For the Claimants, a failure to investigate third-party wrongdoing does not
automatically deprive an investor of treaty protection. 76 The Claimants
submit that they are good faith investors, that they conducted “extensive”
and “exhaustive” due diligence of “foreseeable risks’.’* They did not
perceive any evidence of forgery when they made their investment and did
not deliberately close their eyes to allegations of forgery when they were first
put on notice in September 2009. To the contrary, they “responded quickly
and effectively to every indication of forgery or fraud that was brought to
their attention”; they held meetings with and requested comments from
Ridlatama, met with the then-Regent Mr. Noor, and cooperated with the
Bawasda investigation, which ultimately concluded that the Ridlatama
licenses were “legal and accountable”.’& Because the acts of fraud and
forgery are not their own and they are bona fide investors, the Claimants
assert that they “should be able to have their claims against the State

heard”.766

In addition, the Claimants assert that the Tribunal would still need to
determine whether, as a matter of law, the Claimants have “surviving,
substitute causes of action” on the ground of estoppel, acquiescence,
preclusion, legitimate expectations, unjust enrichment, and internationally
wrongful composite acts.’6’ The Claimants also submit that, if they have

unaffected claims and surviving causes of action, the Tribunal would have to
establish the underlying facts and the compensation payable to the
Claimants. 7° Finally, the Claimants argue that their claims for denial of
justice and threats of force would in any event survive a finding of forgery.”

2. Assessment

The Tribunal will first set out the applicable legal framework (2.1) and then
discuss the admissibility of the claims (2.2).

2.1. Applicable legal framework

Neither the ICSID Convention nor the BITs contain substantive provisions
addressing the consequences of unlawful conduct by a claimant or its
business associate during the performance of an investment. The BITs only
contain admission requirements applying at the time of establishment of an
investment, which are jurisdictional in nature. Therefore, the Tribunal will
have recourse to principles of international law to determine the
consequences of the forgeries established above.

As stated in Venezuela Holdings v. Venezuela, all systems of law, including
the international legal system, contain concepts designed to avoid misuse of
the law.’ With respect to international investment arbitration and ICSID
proceedings more specifically, the tribunal in Phoenix v. Czech Republic
insisted on the duty of arbitral tribunals not to protect an abuse of the system
of international investment protection under the ICSID Convention or

bilateral investment treaties.7”!

Similarly, the tribunal in Europe Cement v. Turkey stated that “conduct that
involves fraud and an abuse of process deserves condemnation’. 77
Likewise, the tribunal in Hamester v. Ghana held that no protection is
afforded to investments made in violation of “national or international

principles of good faith”, such as corruption, fraud or deceitful conduct, even
absent any specific legality requirement in the BIT:
“An investment will not be protected if it has been created in
violation of national or international principles of good faith; by
way of corruption, fraud, or deceitful conduct; or if its creation
itself constitutes a misuse of the system of international
investment protection under the ICSID Convention. It will also

not be protected if it is made in violation of the host State’s
law’.773

And the tribunal added:
“These are general principles that exist independently of
specific language to this effect in the Treaty”.77*
As the quotation of Hamester just illustrated, international tribunals have
found fraudulent behavior to breach the principle of good faith, to constitute
an abuse of right or, under certain circumstances, an abuse of process.’
Various tribunals have underlined the fundamental nature and the long-
standing recognition of the principle of good faith as a matter of domestic
and international law, including investment law.776

The theory of abuse of process, which is a variation of the prohibition of
abuse of rights and, like the latter, an emanation of the principle of good
faith also found application in the context of inadmissible corporate
restructurings. That theory is another manifestation of the general principle

“untrustworthy, if not utterly misleading” documents amounted to an abuse
of process precluding the tribunal's exercise of its jurisdiction over the
dispute.”””

Moreover, particularly serious cases of fraudulent conduct, such as
corruption, have been held to be contrary to international or transnational
public policy.7”8 The common law doctrine of unclean hands barring claims
based on illegal conduct has also found expression at the international level,
although its status and exact contours are subject to debate and have been
approached differently by international tribunals.7”°

The legal consequences of fraudulent conduct depend to a large extent on
the circumstances of each case, which may include the applicable treaty,
the seriousness of the fraud, the role of the disputing parties or third parties
in relation to the fraud, the nexus between the fraud and the claims, and the
time when the fraud was committed. A review of international cases shows
that fraudulent conduct can affect the jurisdiction of the tribunal, or the
admissibility of (all or some) claims, or the merits of a dispute.7®°

In Phoenix v. Czech Republic, the tribunal stated that “States cannot be
deemed to offer access to ICSID dispute settlement mechanism to
investments not made in good faith” and thus held that it lacked jurisdiction
under the ICSID Convention and the Israeli-Czech BIT.78

In Inceysa v. El Salvador, the tribunal held that access to international
arbitration was barred where investments were secured through fraud.’ It
also affirmed the existence of a “meta-positive provision” prohibiting the
attribution of effects to “an act done illegally’’®* and ultimately held that it
lacked jurisdiction since the claimant had acted improperly in the bidding
process leading to the investment.7®

In Europe Cement v. Turkey, the tribunal deemed the copies purportedly
supporting the ownership of share certificates to be fraudulent and denied
jurisdiction because the claimant failed to provide originals:
“In the present case, the Tribunal has concluded that the claim
to ownership of shares in CEAS and Kepez was based on
documents that on examination appear to have been back-
dated and thus fraudulent. Since the Claimant either had no
original documents to produce or no intention of producing
original documents because they would not withstand forensic
examination, the continual requests for extensions of time for
over a five month period could only be seen as a cynical
attempt to postpone the inevitable, further contributing to the
abuse of process”.785

Other tribunals dealt with fraudulent conduct as a matter of admissibility. In
Plama Consortium v. Bulgaria, for instance, the arbitral tribunal was
confronted with a “deliberate concealment amounting to fraud” in the making
of the investment. It held that the Energy Charter Treaty “should be
interpreted in a manner consistent with the aim of encouraging respect for
the rule of law” and concluded that the treaty’s substantive protections
“cannot apply to investments that are made contrary to law’.’® It therefore
held the claims inadmissible.7°”

Finally, a number of tribunals have treated fraudulent conduct in the course
of the assessment of the merits. In Cementownia v. Turkey, the tribunal

dismissed all claims as amounting to an abuse of right compounded by an
abuse of process through procedural misconduct.788

In Malicorp v. Egypt, the respondent argued that the claimant could not
benefit from investment protection since it had entered into a contract based
on forgery. The tribunal dismissed the claims on the merits, because the
contract had been concluded on the basis of a mistake.’° It considered that
conduct contrary to good faith, such as a “veritable abuse of the law’,
undermines the substantive rights of the investor as well as his right to
arbitrate the dispute.7°°

In Minnotte v. Poland, the tribunal held that, notwithstanding the absence of
an express legality requirement in the BIT, “it is now generally accepted that
investments made on the basis of fraudulent conduct cannot benefit from
BIT protection”. 7°" In that case, the respondent had failed to provide
evidence of “deliberate fraud on the part of the Claimants”. Therefore, the
tribunal assessed whether its jurisdiction was vitiated “by reason of the
alleged negligent failure of the Claimants to investigate the factual
circumstances surrounding the making of their investment”. The tribunal
rejected the proposition that principles of international law, such as ex turpi
causa non oritur actio, barred jurisdiction in the event of “a negligent failure
to make inquiries which might (or might not) have unearthed evidence of
fraud” .798

However, on the merits, the Minnotte tribunal contemplated the possibility
that a claim may be vitiated where the claimant unreasonably failed to

perceive evidence of serious misconduct or crime by a third party:

“There may be circumstances in which the deliberate closing
of eyes to evidence of serious misconduct or crime, or an

unreasonable failure to perceive such evidence, would indeed
vitiate a claim”.7%*

The Claimants suggested, and the Respondent did not object, that in an
admissibility context Minnotte spells out a three-step analytical inquiry of
whether a wrongdoing was committed by a third party, whether that
wrongdoing is connected to the investor’s claims, and the “nature of this
connection and the extent to which it impacts upon the investor's good
faith’. The Parties further agreed that the standard of willful blindness
sheds light on the meaning of “deliberate closing of eyes” or “unreasonable
failure to perceive”, although the Respondent sees no justification in
investor-State arbitration in having resort to American criminal law doctrines

of willful blindness.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the passage in Minnotte quoted above addresses the
so-called “head-in-the-sand problem’, also sometimes referred to as
“Nelsonian knowledge”, where a claimant knew or should have known of
third-party wrongdoing in connection with an investment and still chose to do
nothing (as opposed to just failing to take due care). Considering the specific
circumstances of the present case, the Tribunal will assess the standard of
willful blindness — also referred to as “conscious disregard” or “deliberate
ignorance” — by focusing on the level of institutional control and oversight
deployed by the Claimants in relation to the licensing process, whether the
Claimants were put on notice by evidence of fraud that a reasonable
investor in the Indonesian mining sector should have investigated, and
whether or not they took appropriate corrective steps.

Other cases denied protection to investments tainted by the fraud of a third
party, be it under the heading of jurisdiction, admissibility or merits. For
instance, in Anderson v. Costa Rica, the tribunal denied jurisdiction for lack
of an investment, since the assets acquired by the claimant had been
secured by a third party that had engaged in “aggravated fraud and illegal
financial intermediation” .7°”

Investment tribunals also held that investors must exercise a reasonable
level of due diligence, especially when investing in risky business
environments. In Anderson v. Costa Rica, for instance, the tribunal stated
that “prudent investment practice requires that any investor exercise due
diligence before committing funds to any particular investment proposal”.798
The scope of the due diligence depends on the particular circumstances of
each case, such as the general business environment, 7° and includes
ensuring that a proposed investment complies with local laws,®° as well as
investigating the reliability of a business partner and that partner's

representations before deciding to invest.2'

2.2. Inadmissibility of claims related to the EKCP.

On the basis of the facts discussed above, the Tribunal found that a
fraudulent scheme permeated the Claimants’ investments in the EKCP. As
the Respondent correctly put it, the forgeries of the disputed document were
“essential to the making and conduct of the EKCP from which all of the
Claimants’ claims arise”.%°? The question is thus whether, on the ground of
the legal principles just set forth, the claims can still deserve protection or
whether they must be dismissed. The Tribunal views this question as a
matter of admissibility. Indeed, if it dismisses the claims, it will do so on the
ground of a threshold bar, without entering into an analysis of the alleged

treaty violations.

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that claims arising from rights
based on fraud or forgery which a claimant deliberately or unreasonably
ignored are inadmissible as a matter of international public policy.®° For the
reasons set out below, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants’ contention
that they conducted “extensive” and “exhaustive” due diligence in verifying
the authenticity of the disputed mining licenses, both when the licenses were

purportedly issued and when forgery allegations were first brought to their
attention.

In reviewing the circumstances of their case in light of the legal standards
set out above, the Tribunal is struck by the seriousness of the fraud that
taints the entire EKCP (a) and by the Claimants’ lack of diligence overseeing
the licensing process and investigating allegations of forgery (b).

a) The seriousness of the forgeries and fraud

The facts established above reveal the existence of a large scale fraudulent
scheme implemented to obtain four coal mining concession areas in the
EKCP. The forgeries are directly linked to the claims raised by the Claimants
which all relate to the EKCP. The record contains 34 forged documents
including ten mining licenses and four decrees purporting to re-enact the
revoked Exploitation Licenses. With the exception of four of these forged
documents,® all of them were filed by the Claimants in support of their
case.

The Tribunal has no hesitation in finding that the scheme was put in place
intentionally. The record shows repeated acts of forgery, starting with the
fabrication of the Survey and Exploration Licenses to gain access to the coal
reserves. The record also shows that Ridlatama sent copies of these
licenses to “affected governmental departments” so as to “ensure that our
licenses were officially recognized at all government levels”.®° By doing so,
a facade was built that would provide legitimacy to an illegal enterprise.2°¢

The PT RTM Recommendation Letter was obtained by the Indonesian police during the
raid of PT ICD’s office on 29 August 2014 and was filed by the Respondent.
Recommendation No. 522.21/5213/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimantan, H.
Awang Faroek Ishak, to the Minister of Forestry, dated 29 December 2009, regarding
Utilization of Forest Area in the name of PT Ridlatama Tambang Mineral (Exh. R-144).
See further: Letter from the Respondent dated 11 March 2015 |, p. 2; Letter from the
Tribunal dated 20 March 2015, p. 2. The PT RTP Recommendation Letter was
produced by the Claimants and filed by the Respondent as a result of the document
production phase. See: Procedural Order No. 16, Annex B, DPR No. 35;
Recommendation No. 522.21/5214/Ek from the Governor of East Kalimanatan, H.

Utilization of Forest Area in the name of PT Ridlatama Trade Powerindo (Exh. R-145).
The Gunter Documents (documents nos. 33 and 34 in the Document Table) were
produced by the Claimants on 27 July 2015 and filed by the Respondent. See:
Respondent's email of 30 July 2015 ; Claimants’ email of 30 July 2015.

Quinlivan); C-Comments on Minnotte, ¥ 13.

In this context, the Claimants’ reliance on acknowledgements of receipt and maps
generated by the MEMR, obtained on request of Ridlatama, is to no avail. Indeed, the

183

512.

513.

514.

As a final step in that enterprise, the Re-Enactment Decrees evince an
intention to perpetuate the fraud and further mislead affected parties.

The facts suggest that the motive driving the fraud was to extend
Ridlatama’s mining rights in the EKCP beyond the unpromising tenements
of PT RP and PT RS, and especially to access the PT RTM block which
contains 95% of the coal reserves discovered in the EKCP.®” To this end,
forged licenses and related documents were fabricated to give an
impression of lawful entitlement. That false impression was then used to
obtain hand-signed Exploitation Licenses issued on the misguided
assumption that the entire operation rested on valid mining rights. The fraud
was then later perpetuated with the forgery of the Re-Enactment Decrees
after the Exploitation Licenses had been revoked.

The following facts confirm the motivation behind the forgery. The Sendawar
project that preceded the EKCP, in which Churchill and Planet, through PT
ICD, first partnered with Ridlatama in 2006, was unsuccessful. 9° The
surveys in the concession areas of PT RP and PT RS, the first two
tenements of the EKCP for which Ridlatama obtained valid and undisputed
licenses, were also disappointing. As a consequence, Ridlatama never
applied for exploration licenses for these blocks.®°

The circumstances of the initial field work in the PT RP block are particularly
telling. Ridlatama conducted this work in the “nose”®'° or “beak”®"' of what
Mr. Quinlivan called the “bird tenement’,®’? i.e. the northern part of the PT
RP mining area. It concentrated on the southern border of the beak along a

 

licensing process for mining in East Kutai was within the competence of the Regency at
the relevant time, not the MEMR. In addition, the MEMR did not have the necessary
procedures to verify the existence of overlapping concession areas or to validate
information received from license holders prior to the institution of the “Clean and
Clear” program in 2010. The Tribunal further notes that the MEMR maps on which the
Claimants rely reveal various oddities, thereby reinforcing the conclusion that they are
unreliable. For instance, the 21 May 2008 map shows the PT RP tenement with an
exploration status, although no exploration upgrade had been requested by Ridlatama
for that area. Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources, Map of Kutai Mining Area, 21
May 2008 (Exh. C-105). See also: R-PHB1, § 48, item 1; R-Reply on Minnotte, § 10,

stream of coal reserves extending southwards into the concession area held
by Kaltim Nusantara Coal.®"? That concession later became the block of PT
RTM, an area that contains huge coal reserves. Thus, contrary to Mr.
Quinlivan’s statement, the areas to the south of the beak were not an “empty
bank” or a “moose pasture”.8'4 In other words, the fraud was designed to
gain access to the coal reserves located in the areas to the south of the
beak of the PT RP mining area.

In sum, the Tribunal finds that the acts of forgery brought to light in these
proceedings are of a particularly serious nature in light of the number and
nature of forged documents and of the aim pursued, namely to orchestrate,
legitimize and perpetuate a fraudulent scheme to gain access to valuable
mining rights.

b) The Claimants’ lack of diligence

The seriousness of the fraud just discussed is compounded by the
Claimants’ lack of diligence, which is evidenced by the following facts.

First, the Claimants were aware of the risks involved in investing in the coal
mining industry in Indonesia. Indeed, as Mr. Quinlivan confirmed at the
hearing, the Claimants knew that investing in the coal mining sector in
Indonesia entailed serious risks.°'> According to Mr. Quinlivan, Churchill was
aware of the risks resulting from the disorganization in governmental
agencies, in particular due to the devolution of power in the context of
decentralization since 2001 and to the absence of experienced staff in the
Regency administering mining activities. °® Mr. Quinlivan qualified the
situation in the Regencies as resembling the “Wild West’. °'7 He also
confirmed that Churchill was aware of the risk of overlapping mining

licenses.®'8 Churchill was moreover well aware of the “endemic problem” of
corruption in the Indonesian mining sector. Mr. Quinlivan regarded
corruption as an “acceptable risk”, and insisted that, as a publicly listed
company, Churchill was unwilling to engage in such practices.®'?

Second, one would expect an investor aware of the risks of investing in a
certain environment to be particularly diligent in investigating the
circumstances of its investment. Yet, the Claimants did not engage in proper
due diligence in their dealings with their partners. In particular, they failed to
exert due diligence when choosing Ridlatama. Mr. Quinlivan stated that he
relied on Mr. Mazak’s judgment and did not investigate the reliability of that
company and its directors.8?° Mr. Kurniawan, for his part, testified that in
2007 Ridlatama only had a small shop in Jakarta with no proper
infrastructure or staff in East Kutai.®' It further appears that the Claimants
chose their partners essentially because of Ridlatama’s alleged “good
connections” with government officials, in particular in the Mining and
Energy Bureau of the Regency.®? Mr. Kurniawan indeed stated that he was
hired by Ridlatama because he “knew many officials in the local
government”, ®*3 having previously been a director of a regional company
owned by the Regency of East Kutai.84 In addition, there is no evidence on
record that the Claimants verified the representations made by Ridlatama.®5
While connections with the Government may be a legitimate reason for
selecting a business partner, this reason does not dispense with the
investor's duty to investigate that partner's reliability, especially in a risky
environment.

Third, because the environment was risky and because the chosen business
partner showed no record of proven reliability, one would expect the investor

to exercise a heightened degree of diligence. This is so in particular in
respect of the supervision of the licensing process, since the mining licenses
form the indispensable basis of a successful investment. However, the
record shows that the Claimants’ supervision of the licensing process was
deficient in several aspects. For instance, Mr. Benjamin, who became
Director of PT ICD in July 2007, stated that he relied upon the information
given to him by Ridlatama, believed that what Ridlatama conveyed was true,
and never took independent steps to ascertain the veracity of such
information.®?6 Mr. Quinlivan also stated that he relied on, and did not double
check, Ridlatama’s representations that the Nusantara licenses had expired
or that Ridlatama had confirmed in a meeting with Nusantara that the latter
no longer held an interest in the EKCP.®27 He also relied on Mr. Kurniawan’s
information that the disputed licenses had been hand-delivered by the
Regent during official ceremonies.®8

Furthermore, Mr. Benjamin stated that prior to his arrival no one within PT
ICD performed any oversight function in relation to licensing or permitting
during the application process for the mining rights for PT RTM and PT RTP
in 2007:

“Q. [...] Who within PT ICD was responsible for performing the

oversight function that you came to assume in relation to
licensing or permitting?

A. At that time no one of PT ICD was actually responsible for
the obtaining of those licenses mentioned.

Q. Was there anyone within PT ICD who performed the
coordination or oversight function that you came to assume?

A. Not that | can think of”.828
Moreover, although Mr. Benjamin was the person at PT ICD responsible for
the oversight of the licensing process, he said that he only received copies
of the licenses and did not otherwise seek to verify whether the licenses
were properly signed or stamped:

“Q. Did there come a time when you realized that the

signatures on the general survey licenses, and on the

exploration licenses, purporting to be handwritten signatures
of Mr. Ishak, were identical?

“Q. Okay. Can you tell me what, if anything, you did while you

were employed by ICD to ascertain whether the signatures of
Mr. Ishak appearing on those licenses were identical.

A. | never take any effort or time to look at the signatures or
compare signatures between documents”.®!

Similarly, the Claimants did not seek to ascertain the means of signing
mining licenses in Indonesia. Mr. Quinlivan stated that “[wJe didn’t know how
Bupati [i.e., the Regent] or various people fit their signatures to various
documents’, although that information would have been readily available.
Indeed, Messrs. Benjamin and Gunter testified that they would have been
very concerned had they known that the licenses were not hand-signed by
Mr. Ishak, which shows that they knew that mining licenses were hand-
signed.®3

In the same vein, the Claimants’ conduct was not diligent in ensuring that
Nusantara was no longer interested in its mining rights. Although the
Claimants stated that Mr. Gunter had verified that Nusantara’s licenses had
expired,® he testified that his company GMT “was not involved at all in
checking on the Nusantara licenses”.®°5 Mr. Quinlivan further stated that
Ridlatama had sought and obtained assurances from Nusantara in June
2007 that it had no interest in the mining rights anymore. However, seeking
such assurances in June when the PT RTM and PT RTP licenses had been
issued in May makes no sense, if the disputed licenses had been validly
issued.®°6 Mr. Quinlivan’s explanation that the meeting took place to “make
sure that there was no issues with these licenses” “that were granted” is

hardly convincing.®*” At best, it shows an awareness of possible issues that
should have led to increased caution.

Fourth, the Claimants failed to exercise due diligence when “indications of
forgery” first came to light in the BPK report of 23 February 2009. *8
Mr. Quinlivan gave evidence that he relied on Ridlatama’s representations
that there was no merit to the “indications of forgery’, as well as on the
police report dated 6 May 2009, the Bawasda report dated 18 March 2010,
the due diligence conducted by the law firm Sondang Tampubolon &
Partners (“STP”) in 2007, and Mr. Kurniawan’s account of the Regent
handing over the mining licenses in person.®*9 On this basis, he reached the
conclusion that the “indications of forgery” were “not an issue”. %° The
Claimants also pointed to an evaluation report of 2 October 2009 of the BPK
report which first raised the issue of indications of forgery," the assessment
conducted by DNC Advocates (“DNC”) in 2010 on the instruction of Hari
Kiran Vadlamani, a shareholder of Churchill,8? as well as the due diligence
conducted by Mr. Soehandjono in 2011.89

However, none of these elements warranted Mr. Quinlivan’s conclusion that
there was no issue with the “indications of forgery’. The reliability of
Ridlatama’s affirmations was not established. The police report only related

Mr. Quinlivan provided the following response:
“Q. Why did that meeting take place after the licenses had been granted?

A. It was, | guess, to make sure that there was no issues with these licenses over this
ground, which we understood to have the license over which had expired, so that there
would be no complications with the licenses that were granted”. Tr. (Day 6), 63:23-64:4

Finally, the Claimants’ absence of diligence became apparent in the present
proceedings when they filed or produced 34 forged documents to support
their claims. These notably included two different versions of the PT RTM
and PT RTP Survey Licenses and the “copy and paste” signatures in the
Gunter Documents that were provided to Mr. Gunter by Mr. Mazak®° and
must therefore have been in the archives of PT ICD. In fact, the record
reveals that the first time the Claimants engaged in their own forensic
assessment of the disputed signatures was through its expert Dr. Strach for
the purposes of the present arbitration.2°

Conclusion

In conclusion, the Tribunal cannot but hold that all the claims before it are
inadmissible. This conclusion derives from the facts analyzed above, which
demonstrate that the claims are based on documents forged to implement a
fraud aimed at obtaining mining rights. The author of the forgeries and fraud
is not positively identified (although indications in the record all point to
Ridlatama possibly with the assistance of a Regency insider).
Notwithstanding, the seriousness, sophistication and scope of the scheme
are such that the fraud taints the entirety of the Claimants’ investment in the
EKCP. As a result, the general principle of good faith and the prohibition of
abuse of process entail that the claims before this Tribunal cannot benefit
from investment protection under the Treaties and are, consequently,
deemed inadmissible.

The inadmissibility applies to all the claims raised in this arbitration, because
the entire EKCP project is an illegal enterprise affected by multiple forgeries
and all claims relate to the EKCP. This is further supported by the
Claimants’ lack of diligence in carrying out their investment.

Tr. (Day 7), 23:1-3, 15-17 (Cross, Gunter).

The Tribunal notes that the evaluation report of 2 October 2009, which analyzes the
BPK report did not involve a forensic assessment of the disputed signatures, although
the BPK report specifically raised the issue of identical signatures. Instead, the
evaluation focused on translation issues, discrepancies in registration numbers and
irregularities in maps. Analysis and Evaluation Report of the BPK Report by the
Ridlatama Group, 2 October 2009 (Exh. C-516). See further: BPK Audit Report on the

Soehandjono in 2011 consists of an illustration map depicting the licensing process
and did not consist of a forensic analysis of the signatures of the disputed documents.

The conclusion reached by the Tribunal is within the scope of the present
phase of the arbitration as it was circumscribed in Procedural Orders Nos.
13, 15 and 20. In this context, the Tribunal notes in particular that it arrived
at this outcome without there being a need to address the validity of the
Exploitation Licenses as a matter of Indonesian law (see above paragraphs
232-233). 8' Indeed, whatever their validity under municipal law, the
Exploitation Licenses were embedded in a fraudulent scheme, being
surrounded by forgeries. Forged documents preceded and followed them in
time with the Re-Enactment Decrees, which under a non-authentic signature
purported to revoke the revocation of the Exploitation Licenses. The
accumulation of forgeries both before and after the Exploitation Licenses
show that, irrespective of their lawfulness under local law, the entire EKCP
was fraudulent, thereby triggering the inadmissibility of the claims under
international law.

The Tribunal further observes that, in light of the declaration of
inadmissibility of all the claims, it can dispense with ruling on the Claimants’
alleged substitute causes of action. Such causes of action exclusively relate
to the Claimants’ investments in the EKCP. Since the latter are tainted by
the fraud, so are the substitute claims by force of consequence.

Since all the claims are held inadmissible, the Tribunal considers that these
proceedings have reached their conclusion and therefore turns to the
allocation of costs.

COSTS

The Respondent's incurred costs in connection with these proceedings
amounting to USD 12,328,704.18, comprising legal fees and expenses of
USD 11,528,704.18 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 800,000.82

USD 9,077,863.18 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 550,000,8% and
(ii) costs incurred during the jurisdictional phase of USD 2,700,841,
comprising legal fees and expenses of USD 2,450,841 and advance
payments to ICSID of USD 250,000.84

The Respondent requests that the Tribunal order the Claimants to pay the
legal fees, expenses and other costs incurred by the Respondent in
connection with this arbitration. According to the Respondent, ICSID
tribunals have, in the exercise of their discretion under Article 61(2) of the
ICSID Convention, not strictly adhered to the “loser pays” principle, but
taken into account a variety of factors, such as the relative success of the
Parties’ claims, the good faith of a Party in advancing unsuccessful claims
and the Parties’ conduct during the arbitration.®5

Since the Claimants persisted in asserting claims based on “obviously
forged documents”, without making a “genuine effort” to discover the truth in
addition to mischaracterizing relevant evidence, the Claimants should bear
all the costs of these proceedings.® In addition to factoring in the “public
relations campaign” orchestrated by the Claimants against Indonesia, the
Respondent calls attention to the following conduct of the Claimants. First,
the Claimants deliberately withheld presenting Mr. Mazak as a witness,
whom the Respondent characterizes as the person with “the most direct
knowledge of the facts in dispute”.*57 Second, they misled the Tribunal and
the Respondent in connection with the so-called Kurniawan archive and the
non-production of other documents held by Ridlatama. ® Third, the
Respondent submits that the Claimants knew all along that the disputed
signatures were identical without ever investigating these signatures. In this
context, Indonesia argues that the Claimants “stonewalled” its efforts to

obtain the production of the original versions of the disputed documents.®
Fourth, the Claimants withheld documents from their own expert, Dr. Strach,
and refused to let him confer with Mr. Epstein.2®° This conduct led to the
Respondent having to incur “significant additional expenses”.®*' Finally, the
Respondent calls on the Tribunal to reject the Claimants’ complaints about
Indonesia’s conduct during the proceeding.®*

The Claimants’ total costs amount to USD 4,084,021.34, comprising legal
fees and expenses of USD 3,284,021.34 and advance payments to ICSID of
USD 800,000. These costs are split as follows: (i) costs in relation to the
Document Authenticity phase of USD 2,198,795, comprising legal fees and
expenses of USD 1,648,795 and advance payments to ICSID of
USD 550,000, ** and (ii) costs during the jurisdictional phase of
USD 1,885,226.34, comprising legal fees and expenses of
USD 1,635,226.34 and advance payments to ICSID of USD 250,000.85

For their part, the Claimants ask that the Tribunal order the Respondent to
pay the Claimants’ legal costs of responding to its Application in full,
including costs incurred as a result of the Respondent's late payment of the
fifth cost advance.*° They further argue that the Respondent's claimed
costs are “extraordinary” .8”

While acknowledging the Tribunal’s discretion to make awards of costs, the
Claimants argue that the starting point should be that the costs follow the
event®* and that in cases of multiple claims, the Tribunal should weigh the
success or failure of each party and allocate costs proportionately to the

outcome of the case.%° In applying the principle that costs follow the event,
the Claimants further argue that the Tribunal should consider the
reasonableness with which the Parties pursued their respective claims and
defenses, as well as the Parties’ cooperation in achieving cost effective
results. °° On that basis, the Claimants submit that their costs are
reasonable “given the intensity with which the State prosecuted its

allegations of forgery, fraud and criminal conversion”.®7"

During the jurisdictional phase, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal
order the Respondent “to pay all fees and costs incurred in connection with
the respective arbitration proceedings”, including arbitration costs and the
Claimants’ legal and other expenses, “plus interest accrued thereupon at a
rate to be determined by the Tribunal from the date on which such costs are
incurred to the date of payment”.®72

With respect to the Document Authenticity phase, the Claimants argue in the
first place that they should be awarded all costs if the Respondent's
Application for Dismissal is dismissed. * In this context, the Claimants
stress that Clifford Chance operated on the basis of a capped fee, although
its fees significantly exceeded that cap. Therefore, the Tribunal should not
further discount this cost item.

In the event that the Respondent's Application for Dismissal is upheld in full
or in part, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should separately consider
the Respondent's two limbs of forgery and fraud.® As to forgery, the
Claimants argue that the Respondent should “pay (at the very least) a
portion” of the Claimants’ costs if only some of the 34 disputed documents
are held to be forged.®’5 The Tribunal should also consider whether the
forgeries occurred with or without wrongdoing on the part of the

Claimants.” As to fraud, the Claimants argue that the Respondent could
only succeed in full if the Tribunal were to find that the Exploitation Licenses
were obtained through deceit by “Ridlatama and the Claimants’.*” Since
they were only victims, so the Claimants argue, the Tribunal should “make
no order as to costs against them”.®8

While claiming that their conduct has been “reasonable and cooperative” ,879
the Claimants assert that the Respondent's conduct was not reasonable.
They in particular refer to the document production phase, the refusal of
Mr. Noor to attend the hearing, and the variations in the Respondent's case
before and after the hearing.®° In any event, the Claimants are of the view
that the Tribunal should verify whether there is no unreasonable duplication
in the fees of the two law firms that represented Indonesia and whether
these fees have actually been paid.®*'

B. Analysis

As a preliminary comment, the Tribunal notes that, whereas the
Respondent’s submissions on costs of December 2015 include its costs and
expenses for the entire arbitration, the Claimants’ submissions of December
2015 and April-May 2016 only relate to the Document Authenticity phase.
The Tribunal thus also took into consideration cost submissions which the
Claimants filed in respect of the jurisdictional stage.

Each side requests that its opponent be ordered to bear the entirety of its
own costs and expenses, as well as the entirety of the Tribunal’s and the
Centre’s expenses.

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall,
except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses
incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings,
and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees
and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges

for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such
decision shall form part of the award”.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 47(1) provides that the Award “shall contain [...] (j)
any decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceeding”.

The Parties agree that Article 61(2) of the Convention grants the Tribunal
discretion in allocating the ICSID arbitration costs and the Parties’ costs,
including legal fees.®82

Two approaches have been adopted by ICSID tribunals in awarding costs.
The first consists in apportioning ICSID costs in equal shares and ruling that
each party shall bear its own costs.®° The second applies the principle
“costs follow the event”, such that the losing party bears the costs of the
proceedings, including those of the other party,®* or that the parties share in
the costs proportionately to their success or failure.

In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal considers it appropriate to
adopt the second approach of “costs follow the event”. Indeed, this is a case
where investors started two arbitrations on the basis of a large number of
documents that turned out to be forged and revealed a large scale
fraudulent scheme. As a result, the Tribunal considers that the costs of
these proceedings should fall on the Claimants, subject to the
considerations below.

First, it is true that the Claimants prevailed on the jurisdictional objections.
Accordingly, one might argue that the costs of that phase must be imposed
on the Respondent for having raised unsuccessful defenses. The Tribunal
does not think so. These proceedings based on forged documents should
not have been brought in the first place. Moreover, the objections to
jurisdiction raised by Indonesia were far from frivolous. While they were not
sustained, they raised legitimate questions about the significance of the
BITs, as the Decisions on Jurisdiction show.

Second, the Tribunal is struck by the disparity in the level of expenses
incurred by both sides. The Claimants’ expenses amount to USD 4,084,021
(including the advances made to ICSID) and the Respondent's expenses
amount to USD 12,328,704, i.e. approximately 3 times more (including
advances to ICSID). Differences in fee levels between disputing parties are
natural as they are a function of a number of variables, including the
complexities of each party's case and a series of choices that a party makes
in its best judgment in relation to the conduct of the proceedings. Here,
Indonesia had the burden of establishing the forgeries and fraudulent
scheme on the basis of a factual matrix that was indeed complex. At the
same time, the magnitude of the disparity in fees does not appear entirely
justified by these elements. One additional factor may lie in the fact that the
Claimants’ last counsel worked on the basis of a capped fee. Another factor
which may have added to the costs of the Respondent may be the poor
state of its own archives,®*° which made the retrieval of relevant documents
difficult, a factor for which the Claimants can certainly not be held
accountable.

Having pondered all of these elements and exercising its discretion in
matters of allocation of costs, the Tribunal deems it reasonable that the
Claimants pay 75% of the Respondent’s expenses incurred in these
proceedings. This result may seem harsh to the Claimants considering that
they sought to keep their own costs down. Yet, as the foregoing analysis
shows, this is a case of forgery and fraud, which in the Tribunal’s mind
justifies this result.

As for the direct costs of the proceedings which were funded with the
advances paid to ICSID, there is no reason for an abatement and, thus, the
Claimants shall bear 100% of these costs.

As indicated above, the direct costs of the proceeding include (i) the fees
and expenses of each Member of the Tribunal and the Tribunal’s Assistant;
(ii) payments made by ICSID for other direct expenses, such as those
related to the conduct of document inspections and hearings (e.g., court
reporting, audio visual, interpretation, the charges of Maxwell Chambers in
connection with hosting the hearings), courier services, as well as estimated

charges related to the dispatch of this Award; and (iii) |CSID’s administrative
fees.

The direct costs of the proceeding have been paid out of the advances
made to ICSID by the Parties. Once the case account balance has been
finalized, the ICSID Secretariat will provide the Parties with a detailed
financial statement.

In sum, the Claimants shall bear the direct costs of these proceedings,
ie. USD 1,600,000 (subject to ICSID’s final financial statement) of which it
has already paid USD 800,000. It shall therefore pay to the Respondent
USD 800,000 or any lower amount that may arise from ICSID’s final
financial statement. Further, the Claimants shall bear 75% of the
Respondent's costs, i.e. USD 8,646,528.
