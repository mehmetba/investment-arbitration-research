THE DISPUTE

The dispute concerns the annulment of a contract, entitled Agreement for the Lease of Space
Segment Capacity on ISRO/ANTRIX S-Band Spacecraft (the “Devas Agreement” or the
“Agreement”),' concluded on January 28, 2005 between Devas Multimedia Private Limited
(“Devas”), an Indian company, and Antrix Corporation Limited (“Antrix”), an Indian State-
owned company. The annulment of the Devas Agreement followed a policy decision taken by the

Government of India to reserve a part of the electromagnetic spectrum known as the S-band “for

Agreement for the Lease of Space Segment Capacity on ISRO/ANTRIX S-Band Spacecraft between Antrix
Corp. Ltd, and Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (Agreement No. ANTX/203/DEVAS/2005), January 28,
2005 (the “Devas Agreement”) (Ex. C-16/JCB-37).

national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military forces, railways and other public
utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country’s
strategic requirements.”? Part of that spectrum had originally had been leased to Devas under the
Devas Agreement for the purpose of offering broadband wireless access and audio-video services

throughout India.

The Claimants, who are shareholders of Devas, maintain that this policy decision taken by the
Government of India amounted to an expropriation of the Claimants’ investments in India and
was not accompanied by payment of fair and equitable compensation, in breach of the Treaty.

They also allege other breaches under Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty.

The Respondent argues that its policy decision was intended to satisfy the national security needs
of the nation; that Devas had no right to proceed with the Devas Agreement uninterrupted by any

governmental action; and that the Claimants have no claim under the Treaty.

ADOPTION OF THE TERMS OF APPOINTMENT AND THE FIRST PROCEDURAL
MEETING

By letter dated February 4, 2013, the Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on certain matters,
including, inter alia, the need for the Respondent to appoint counsel; administration of the
arbitration by the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”); and an outline of steps to be taken in

the conduct of the proceedings.

In response, the Claimants urged the Tribunal, by letter dated February 5, 2013, to convene an
initial conference whereas the Respondent, by letter dated February 13, 2013, sought to defer

addressing these issues until the process of engaging counsel was concluded.

By letter dated February 14, 2013, the Claimants noted that the Respondent’s position was
“completely unsatisfactory and appears purposefully calculated to compound the already
extensive delays that the Respondent’s conduct has engendered in this proceeding,” by reference
to the case record. In any case, the Claimants stated that there was “no basis for further delay,”
citing the Respondent’s good faith obligations to promptly participate, and proposed possible

venues for an initial conference on a date to be fixed by the Tribunal.
On March 14, 2013, the Respondent notified the appointment of Khaitan & Co. as counsel.

By letter dated April 2, 2013, the Tribunal requested that the Parties advance an initial deposit
and designated the PCA to administer the initial case deposit. The Tribunal further proposed that

the PCA act as registry and administer the arbitral proceedings, which was accepted by the Parties.

On April 16, 2013, the PCA wrote to the Parties regarding the details of the first procedural
meeting to be held on May 15, 2013, at the Peace Palace in The Hague.

Following an exchange of views upon the Tribunal’s invitation, the Parties submitted a draft

Proposed Terms of Appointment and a draft Proposed Procedural Timetable on May 10, 2013.

On May 10, 2013, the Respondent informed that it had engaged Curtis, Mallet-Prevost, Colt &
Mosle LLP as counsel along with M/s Khaitan & Co.

On May 15, 2013, a first procedural meeting was held at the Peace Palace in The Hague, the
Netherlands (“First Procedural Meeting”), in which the Parties agreed to and signed the Terms of

Appointment.

By e-mail dated May 11, 2013, the Respondent notified the Claimants and the Tribunal of its
intention to challenge the appointments of the Hon. Marc Lalonde as Presiding Arbitrator and

Professor Francisco Orrego Vicuiia as Co-arbitrator.

Following the First Procedural Meeting, at which the Respondent again raised its intention to
bring the challenge, the Tribunal circulated an unsigned Procedural Order No. 1 “to be used as a
guide for the Parties in their preparation of their upcoming submissions during the pendency of

the challenge.”

By letter dated May 20, 2013, the Respondent submitted the challenge to H.E. Judge Peter Tomka,
then President of the International Court of Justice and Appointing Authority pursuant to Article

8(2)(d)(i) of the Mauritius-India BIT.

On June 3, 2013, the Appointing Authority made two disclosures and invited the Parties to submit
their comments on them by June 10, 2013. By letters dated June 5, 2013, the Claimants and the
Respondent indicated that they had no comments with regard to the Appointing Authority’s

disclosures.

Between May and June 2013, the Claimants and the Respondent made submissions in respect of
the challenge in accordance with the agreed timetable. The Hon. Mare Lalonde and Professor
Orrego Vicufia also submitted comments on the challenge by letters dated June 5 and 6, 2013,

respectively.

On September 30, 2013, the Appointing Authority issued his decision on the challenge—
upholding the Respondent’s request to disqualify Professor Orrego Vicufia, and rejecting the

Respondent’s request to disqualify the Hon. Marc Lalonde.

Following the Appointing Authority’s decision on the challenge, the Claimants appointed
Mr. David R. Haigh, Q.C., as Co-arbitrator on October 9, 2013. The Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 1 on October 16, 2013.

By letter dated May 23, 2015, the Respondent submitted a challenge to Mr. David R. Haigh, Q.C.
to H.E. Judge Ronny Abraham, the current President of the International Court of Justice and
Appointing Authority pursuant to Article 8(2)(d)(i) of the Mauritius-India BIT. By letter dated
June 3, 2015, the Claimants opposed the challenge.

Notwithstanding this, the Respondent stated that, in connection with the Claimants’ application,
it had located “a few additional documents that [were] arguably responsive” to their requests.

the tribunal in that case, the Respondent noted that it was “prepared to provide the same materials

regarding the redacted documents that Antrix will be providing Devas in the ICC case.”

In a further communication dated June 9, 2014, the Respondent provided the Tribunal with the
text of the direction given by the ICC tribunal in respect of the redacted documents, which was

THE NEW DOCUMENTS PRODUCED BY THE RESPONDENT ON DECEMBER 20,
2014

On September 22, 2014, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would not be necessary for them
to produce post-hearing briefs on the questions raised by the Tribunal during the Hearing on
Jurisdiction and Liability. The Tribunal also stated that, if it wished “to obtain additional

information, it [would] communicate with the Parties in due course.”

On December 20, 2014, the Respondent submitted two additional exhibits that had been referred
to in a related ICC arbitration: (i) the “Norms, Guidelines and Procedures for Implementation of
the Policy Frame-work for Satellite Communications in India” (the “Norms, Guidelines and
Procedures”); and (ii) the Technical Statement from the Joint Wireless Advisor posted on the
official website of the Wireless Planning & Coordination Wing of the Department of

Telecommunications (the “JWA Technical Statement”, and, together, the “New Documents”).

On December 23, 2014, the Claimants argued, inter alia, that the Respondent’s December 20,
2014 submission was unsolicited and thus contravened the Tribunal’s September 22, 2014
directive. It further submitted that it would be procedurally unfair to allow the record to be added

to.

On December 26, 2014, the Respondent submitted a response to the Claimants’ objection on the

Additional Documents.

On January 6, 2015, the Claimants submitted a further response to the Respondent’s December

26, 2014 communication.

On January 7, 2015, the Respondent submitted some brief comments to the Claimants January 6,

Documents Submitted on December 20, 2014. The Tribunal admitted the Norms, Guidelines and
Procedures into the record, while the JWA Technical Statement was admitted into the record by
a majority, with reservations. The Tribunal also invited the Claimants to submit a written
statement with their views on the New Documents, and granted the Respondent an opportunity to

provide responsive comments.

On March 2, 2015, the Claimants submitted a written statement as directed by Procedural Orders

No. | and 4.

THE LAUNCHING OF GSAT-6

On August 31, 2015, the Respondent submitted six news articles and a video by public service
broadcaster Doordarshan reporting the launch of a satellite named “GSAT-6” on August 27,
2015.

On September 21, 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5. In that Order, the Tribunal
conditionally accepted the Respondent’s submission of August 31, 2015 without ruling on the
significance or probative value of the Respondent’s submission. The Tribunal also invited the
Respondent to explain, within two weeks from the Order, the relevance and probative value of its
submission and invited the Claimants to submit, within two weeks of the receipt of the

Respondent’s explanation, any comment they may wished to make.

The Respondent, on October 5, 2015, submitted a further article published by the Institute of
Defence Studies and Analyses entitled “GSAT-6: India’s Second Military Satellite Launched” in
Annex A, “which reviewed the launch and its significance for the military.” In its letter, the
Respondent stated inter alia that “the video of the event and accompanying press reports attest to
the event’s significance and leave no doubt that what Respondent told this Tribunal about the
reconfiguration of the satellite for military use and the reservation of the S-band capacity for non-

commercial, strategic use was completely accurate.”

On October 19, 2015, the Claimants submitted to the Tribunal their comments on the documents
newly submitted by India relating to satellite lanch. The Claimants argued that the Tribunal

should focus on contemporaneous evidence to the events of February 2011 and that the new

BACKGROUND TO THE DEVAS PROJECT

The Devas Agreement forms the contractual framework to enable and facilitate the Devas project,
which proposed to utilize part of the S-band capacity previously allocated to India by the

International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”).!"

L The S-band and Its Allocation within India

The S-band is a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum found at 2500-2690 MHz (the “S-
band”).?° The S-band is a scarce and highly desirable spectrum due to its specific characteristics—
its frequencies have low attenuation (i.e. the signal does not fade) and the signal can be sent and
received by small units, such as mobile phones and laptop computers, without requiring the

antenna on such units to be pointed directly at the satellite.”!

Of the capacity allocated to India, further allocations were made internally by India pursuant to

)?? and broadcast

its national planning, for example, to enable mobile satellite services (“MSS”

satellite services (“BSS”).

The Parties disagree with regard to the allocation and utilization of S-band capacity in India.
According to the Respondent, both the S-MSS and the S-BSS frequencies, from the outset of

India’s space program until the early part of the last decade, were utilized solely for non-

commercial, national strategic and societal purposes at all relevant times.” It adds that, in the
early 2000s, 40MGz of S-MSS capacity were assigned to the Department of Telecommunications
for use in the terrestrial communications industry, leaving the Department of Space with 80MGz
of S-BSS and 70MGz capacity. The Claimants, however, contend that in 2001, the DOS was left
with that latter capacity, which was not utilized at the time and that it needed to find ways of
making commercial use of its allocated S-band spectrum in order to retain that allocation which

would otherwise, under the ITU regulations, expire by September 2010 if it remained unused.”°

2 The Proposed Devas Satellite-Terrestrial Communications System

Early discussions concerning the proposed Devas project took place in 2003 between Antrix and
Forge Advisors LLC (“Forge Advisors”), a U.S. company headed by Mr. Ramachandran
Viswanathan,” which led to a signed Memorandum of Understanding “to explore mutually

beneficial opportunities in the area of digital multimedia services.”?”

The Devas project envisaged the establishment of a hybrid satellite-terrestrial communications
system involving both satellite and terrestrial transmission”* due to certain perceived advantages
over a satellite-only communications system.” This system would enable Devas to offer two main
services to customers in India: broadband wireless access (“BWA”) and audio-video (“AV”)
services, to facilitate the delivery of video, multimedia and information services across India to

mobile users (together, “Devas Services”).*°

According to the Claimants, this hybrid communications system required the construction of a
network of Complementary Ground Components (“CGC”), often referred to as ‘towers’ or

‘repeaters’, on the surface of the earth that use the same frequency as a satellite.*! Satellite

transmission would be augmented by terrestrial transmission to enable the reuse of satellite signals

seamlessly.*”

It was proposed that ISRO would be responsible for developing the satellite segment by building,
launching and operating two satellites and leasing transponder capacity on these satellites to
Devas.** In turn, Devas would be responsible for the terrestrial segment by, among other things,
building the CGC elements of the network,* notwithstanding the fact that the Devas Agreement

did not address this latter aspect.*°

One critical component of the hybrid communications system was sufficient S-band capacity,
since the S-band signal could be received and sent from units in motion using compact omni-
directional antennae.*” As a practical matter, any S-band capacity allocated for Devas’ use could
not be simultaneously used by another operator as this could cause significant interference with

the system or the total unavailability of the service. **

3. Negotiations Leading to the Devas Agreement

In May 2004, at the direction of the chairman of ISRO, a High Power Committee was constituted
to review the “technical feasibility, risk mitigation, time schedule, financial and organizational
aspects” of the Devas project. This committee was chaired by Dr. K.N. Shankara (the “Shankara

Committee”).*°

The Shankara Committee concluded that the contemplated system of “satellite transmission [...]

augmented by terrestrial transmission so as to reuse the signals seamlessly in Indian environment’

was “technically sound and reliable” as well as “quite attractive.” After further discussions, the
Antrix Board “approved the draft agreement negotiated with Devas [and recommended by the

Shankara Committee].’°

The Respondent attaches significance to a “definitive binding Term Sheet” proposed by Devas
on September 20, 2004 (the “Term Sheet”),*! particularly with respect to the grounds for
termination and its consequences, which will be addressed in greater detail below. The Claimants,
however, emphasize that the provisions of the Devas Agreement have superseded these

negotiations, and consider them irrelevant as a matter of law.*?

THE DEVAS AGREEMENT

The operative version of the Devas Agreement between Devas and Antrix was concluded on

January 28, 2005.**

As a preliminary matter, the Claimants emphasize that this is not a case based on a breach of
contract, but rather a treaty claim.** Accordingly, the Claimants focus on the rights ensuing to
Devas from the Agreement. The Respondent also closely examines the nature of Devas’ rights
but place additional significance on Antrix’s corresponding obligations—arguing that they are

limited in nature. The Parties discuss at length the following aspects of the Devas Agreement:

1. Leased Capacity

The Devas Agreement provided for the lease of transponder capacity on a first satellite (identified
as “PS1” or “GSAT-6”) and it also gave Devas the option to lease transponders on a second

satellite (“PS2” or “GSAT-6A”), which it exercised.>

In essence, the Devas Agreement provided for the lease of 75% of India’s S-BSS allocation
(30 MHz for each satellite, for a total of 60 MHz of India’s total of 80 MHz of S-BSS) and
10 MHz of the S-MSS allocated for use by DOS.“° Overall, it was agreed that 90% of the total

bandwidth of the satellites was allocated to Devas, and the other 10% was allocated to DOS.*7

The Claimants stress that the Devas Agreement provided that the Leased Capacity would be a

“Non-Preemptible service, except as specifically provided for in Article 7,”

which gave Devas
the exclusive right to the Leased Capacity.*® The Claimants also highlight that, under the Devas
Agreement, Devas could assign the Leased Capacity at its sole discretion upon sixty days’

0

advance notice to Antrix,*” which enabled Devas to undertake a range of transactions with

investors.*!

2 Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees

Under the Devas Agreement, Devas was required to pay Antrix an upfront capacity reservation
fee of the INR equivalent of USD 20 million, to be paid in three equal instalments, in order to
reserve transponder capacity on the first satellite.*? The first such instalment was due upon notice
from Antrix that it had received all necessary approvals for the capacity lease service for the

satellite.*?

Within 30 months of payment of the first installment of that fee (with a 6-month grace period),
ISRO was required to deliver a fully operational and ready PS1.*4 Devas had to pay an upfront
capacity reservation fee of the INR equivalent of USD 20 million to reserve transponder capacity

on the second satellite as well.** In addition to these upfront fees, Devas was also required to pay

Antrix an ongoing annual lease fee for the transponders of the INR equivalent of USD 9 million,

rising to the INR equivalent of USD 11.25 million once Devas became cash flow positive.*°

3. Regulatory Approvals

The activities contemplated by the Devas Agreement were subject to a number of approvals and
licenses to be obtained in part by Devas and in part by Antrix. Under the Devas Agreement, Antrix
was obligated to acquire “all necessary Governmental and Regulatory Approvals relating to
orbital slot and frequency clearances, and funding for the satellite to facilitate DEVAS services.”*”
Antrix also undertook “through ISRO/DOS” to obtain clearances of all relevant international and

9958

national agencies”** and to “provide appropriate technical assistance to Devas on a best effort

basis for obtaining required operating licenses and Regulatory Approvals.”*?

What is significant in the Respondent’s view is that no governmental body of India was party to
the Devas Agreement or gave any commitment to grant the necessary approvals to Devas. The
role of the Government of India in connection with the Devas Agreement was limited to that of a
regulator,*! and, accordingly, the Devas Agreement contained a comprehensive set of provisions
allocating risks and responsibilities in the event that the governmental approvals required for full

implementation of the project were not obtained.

4. Delay Damages

The Devas Agreement provided for “Delay Damages” of USD 416,666 per month (for a cap of
USD 5 million after 12 months’ delay) if Antrix failed to deliver PS1 within three years of the

first upfront capacity reservation payment. It also provided that the failure to deliver PS1 within

four years from the first payment would be a material breach of the agreement.“

S Termination

94. The Respondent places special emphasis on Article 7 of the Devas Agreement, setting forth the
rights and obligations of the parties upon termination, which could be triggered by either party to

the Agreement on a series of grounds:®°

Article 7. Termination
a. Termination for convenience by DEVAS

DEVAS may terminate this Agreement in the event DEVAS is unable to get and retain the
Regulatory Approvals required to provide the Devas Services on or before the completion of
the Pre Shipment Review of PS1. In the event of such termination, DEVAS shall forfeit the
Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees made to ANTRIX and any service or other taxes paid by
DEVAS and those outstanding to be paid to ANTRIX till such date. Upon such termination,
neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other Party under this Agreement.

b. Termination by DEVAS for fault of ANTRIX

DEVAS may terminate this Agreement at any time if ANTRIX is in material breach of any
provisions of this Agreement and ANTRIX has failed to cure the breach within three months
after receiving notice from DEVAS setting out the nature of breach and reasons for
considering the same as material breach. In such event, ANTRIX shall immediately
reimburse DEVAS all the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees and corresponding taxes if
applicable, received by ANTRIX till that date. Upon such termination, neither Party shall
have any further obligation to the other Party under this Agreement nor be liable to pay any
sum as compensation or damages (by whatever name called).

c. Termination for convenience by ANTRIX

ANTRIX may terminate this Agreement in the event ANTRIX is unable to obtain the
necessary frequency and orbital slot coordination required for operating PS1 on or before the
completion of the Pre Shipment Review of the PS1. In the event of such termination,
ANTRIX shall immediately reimburse DEVAS all the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees
and corresponding service taxes received by ANTRIX till that date. Upon such termination,
neither Party shall have any further obligation to the other Party under this Agreement nor be
liable to pay any sum as compensation or damages (by whatever name called).

d. Termination by ANTRIX for fault of DEVAS

ANTRIX may terminate this Agreement at any time if:

i. DEVAS is in material breach of any provisions of this Agreement and DEVAS has failed
to cure the breach within three months after receiving notice from ANTRIX regarding such
breach or,

ii. Non payment of (a) the Lease Fees and other charges (such as spectrum monitoring
charges) by DEVAS for a continued period of twelve (12) months, or if such accumulated
delays from recurrent non payments exceed 60 (sixty) months, whichever occurs earlier or,
(b) Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees, already due

iii. In the event that:

a. A liquidator trustee or a bankruptcy receiver or the like is appointed by a competent court
and such appointment remains un-stayed or un-vacated for a period of 90 (ninety) days after
the date of such order by a competent court in respect of DEVAS, or

b. Ifareceiver or manager is appointed by a competent court in respect of all or a substantial
part of the assets of DEVAS and such appointment remains un-stayed or unvacated for a
period of 90 (ninety) days after the date of such appointment, or

c. Ifall ora substantial part of the assets of DEVAS have been finally confiscated by action
of any Governmental Authority, against which no appeal or judicial redress lies.

It is expressly agreed that ANTRIX shall have no right to terminate this Agreement if
DEVAS enters into any scheme or arrangement with its creditors, a corporate re-organization
or restructuring of its debt and liabilities as long as DEVAS continues to make the Annual
Lease Payments to ANTRIX.

In the event of such termination, DEVAS shall forfeit the Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees
made to ANTRIX and DEVAS shall be liable to pay any outstanding dues to be paid to
ANTRIX by DEVAS. Upon such termination, neither Party shall have any further obligation
to the other Party under this Agreement nor be liable to pay any sum as compensation or
damages (by whatever name called).

The Respondent emphasizes that, under these provisions, the only consequence arising from the
termination of the Devas Agreement is either the retention or the refund of the upfront capacity

reservation fees paid by Devas to Antrix.®

The Respondent notes that the termination provisions of the Devas Agreement were heavily

negotiated.®’ The Respondent relies on the Term Sheet,“ which contains a set of termination

provisions that are, in the Respondent’s view, substantially different from those agreed by the

parties in Article 7 of the Devas Agreement.® The Term Sheet provided (i) that Antrix would

“not be entitled to terminate [the agreement] except for non-payment of fees by DEVAS;”” and
(ii) that Antrix would have to pay liquidated damages, in addition to refunding amounts that may
have been paid by Devas to Antrix, in case of termination for any reason other than Devas’ non-

payment of fees.”!

Moreover, the Respondent points out that there was nothing in Devas’ proposed binding term
sheet that provided for liquidated damages running from Devas to Antrix in the event that Devas

were to terminate the agreement for its convenience, or in the event of breach by Devas.”

Ultimately, the Term Sheet was never executed, and Article 7 of the Devas Agreement, which

provides for a single remedy in the event of termination for any reason, was agreed instead.”

The Respondent argues that this difference between the termination provisions proposed by Devas
and those agreed to by the parties in Article 7 of the Devas Agreement is significant. As a result

of the negotiations, the parties’ mutual intention and agreement at the time of entry into the Devas

Agreement was to limit liability in the event of a termination. The maximum liability was either
the retention (or refund, as the case may be) by Antrix of the upfront capacity reservation fees

paid to date.”

The Claimants contend that Antrix never properly invoked the termination regime in Article 7 of
the Devas Agreement. Moreover, it argues, even if those provisions operated to shield Antrix
from damages for its unlawful renunciation and/or repudiation of the Agreement (which is

denied), Article 7 still would not provide a ‘safe harbor’ for India in this proceeding.”*

6. Force Majeure

Article 11 of the Devas Agreement provided that neither Devas nor Antrix was “liable for any
failure or delay in performance of its obligations” in the event of a force majeure as defined in

this Article.”

A force majeure event was limited to matters “beyond reasonable control of the party affected”
which prevented performance “despite all efforts of the Affected Party to prevent it or mitigate
its effects.” In the Claimants’ view, this notion of force majeure cannot be reconciled with
Antrix’s eventual declaration of force majeure, which was premised upon a Union Cabinet policy
decision and was purposefully procured by Antrix/ISRO/DOS in an effort to extricate Antrix from

the Devas Agreement.”

In turn, the Respondent highlights that Article 11 of the Devas Agreement defined “Force Majeure
event” to include “acts of or failure to act by any governmental authority acting in its sovereign
capacity.”” It is obvious, in the Respondent’s view, that the Government of India had the power

to take action to prevent the performance by either or both parties to the Devas Agreement.*°

THE INITIAL DEVELOPMENT OF THE DEVAS PROJECT
I. Establishment of Corporate Infrastructure and Initial Financing

According to the Claimants, shortly after the conclusion of the Devas Agreement in early 2005,
Devas formed its management team and established its company infrastructure, including an

office in Bangalore.*!

On December 1, 2005, the Union Cabinet formally approved the construction and launch of
satellite PS1,°* and the Devas Agreement became effective on February 2, 2006, upon the
issuance of a letter by Antrix informing Devas that it had obtained all required approvals for the
Devas project® including all the necessary frequencies and the orbital slots in which the satellites

PS1 and PS2 were to operate.**

The Claimants consider as significant that the Government of India worked continuously to

protect its rights at the ITU in furtherance of the Devas Agreement after it came into effect.**

On March 16, 2006, CC/Devas and Telcom Devas made a first round of investment of
approximately USD 7.5 million each,*° part of which was used by Devas to pay the first
instalment of the upfront capacity reservation fee for PS1 on June 21, 2006, pursuant to the Devas
Agreement.*”

A second round of investment, of approximately the same amount, was made on June 18, 2007,

to pay the first instalment of the upfront capacity reservation fee for PS2.** The Claimants also

no

art hybrid satellite and terrestrial telecommunication services across India.
The Respondent dismisses the Claimants’ recitation of these factual matters as irrelevant or

THE PARALLEL REVIEW PROCESS OF THE DEVAS AGREEMENT AND ITS
SUBSEQUENT ANNULMENT

Both Parties acknowledge that several Indian authorities undertook a unilateral review of the
terms of the Devas Agreement in parallel with the initial performance of its provisions, ultimately
culminating in its annulment. What follows is a summary of key events that were unbeknownst
to the Claimants at the time, but occurred in parallel to the initial performance of the Devas

Agreement, from 2005 to February 2011.

I. India’s Internal Discussions on Security Needs for S-band Capacity

In 2005, India’s military and paramilitary agencies started expressing a demand for S-band
capacity for non-commercial purposes.!!? In the period 2005-2007, these demands took the form

of reviews and projections of future S-bandwidth requirements. !'>

However, in September 2007,
a concern emerged that if S-band spectrum was “not safeguarded against the bid of commercial
operators in India, this spectrum [would] not be available for any future utilization for the military
applications...,” which would “severely jeopardize the future Defence services plans of providing

SATCOM connectivity.”!"*

The armed forces’ needs for S-band spectrum continued to be reviewed in the following years.!'°
The Claimants remained unaware of the existence of any needs for S-band spectrum of the Indian
military until the Government of India announced that the CCS had decided to annul the Devas
Agreement in February 2011. According to Claimants, they were not made aware of “competing

demands for S-band capacity” until the date of Antrix’s termination notice.”!!

2. The Suresh Report

The Respondent explains that, in November 2009, Mr. A. Vijay Anand, the new Joint Secretary
of the Department of Space and Chief Vigilance Officer, learned of possible irregularities relating
to the Devas Agreement.!'” These irregularities, notably the allegedly unauthorized amendment
to the minutes of a January 6, 2009 meeting of a review committee of the Technical Advisory
Committee (“TAG”) of the Indian Satellite Coordination Committee (“ICC”), had the effect of
eliminating significant comments that had been made by the representatives of the Wireless
Planning and Coordination Wing (the “WPC”), a body responsible for the issuance of an

operating license and frequency allocation.''*

The Respondent contends that the disclosure of potential irregularities and the information
obtained at the preliminary stage of this internal investigation led Dr. Radhakrishnan to institute
a comprehensive review of the Devas Agreement on December 8, 2009. The review was to be
conducted by a committee established through the Department of Telecommunications (“DOT”)
and chaired by Dr. B.N. Suresh, Director of the Indian Institute of Space and Technology (the

“Suresh Committee”).!'°

existing policy, yet that is precisely what it wanted to do; See Statement of Defence, para. 39; Anand I,

The Suresh Committee acted on its mandate to review the “legal, commercial, procedural and

technical aspects” of the Devas Agreement!”°

and produced a report dated May 2010 (the “Suresh
Report’).'?! However, its existence was not made public until the February 8, 2011 press

conference. '””

While the Suresh Report made certain suggestions concerning future contractual negotiations by
Antrix and ISRO, the Claimants highlight that it did not find any fault in Devas’ conduct in

reaching the Agreement.!7°

In particular, the Suresh Report noted that there was “absolutely no
doubt on the technical soundness of the digital multimedia services as proposed in this hybrid
satellite and terrestrial system.”'** Nor did the Suresh Report suggest that the Devas Agreement
should be annulled because there was an overwhelming military need for S-band spectrum. '?5
Instead, say the Claimants, the report contradicts India’s case that there was a military need for

all available S-band:

Considering the fact ISRO/DOS has developed these complex technologies to start a new
service in the national interest it is noted that the agreement does not make any mention of
preference being offered explicitly to ISRO in case there is a demand on ISRO/DOS for
use of this service under emergent conditions for strategic or any other essential
applications. !2°

 

In response, the Respondent submits, Dr. Suresh remarked that only 10% of the capacity to be
leased under the Devas Agreement would be available for ISRO, which “would bring in certain
limitations on the availability of spectrum for any essential demands in future.” Moreover, he

recommended that:

The utilization of the S-band frequency spectrum allotted for satellite based services to
ISRO/DOS for satellite communications is extremely important. Therefore this aspect has to
be critically examined considering all usages including GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A by a

country should also be considered. !””

In any event, the Respondent notes that the Devas Agreement was ultimately cancelled for

national security reasons based on the nation’s strategic requirements for the spectrum, which had

crystallized by the end of 2009.18

3 The Space Commission’s Determination to Annul the Devas Agreement

The Parties disagree as to why DOS decided to pursue the review of the Devas Agreement after

the Suresh Report was issued.

In this regard, the Claimants emphasize that, towards the end of May 2010, the media in India
had begun making assertions that DOS had given away valuable S-band spectrum to Devas “on
the quiet” and calling on the Government of India to annul the Agreement.'” However, according
to the Claimants, despite the negative press reports, in the numerous meetings held with various
Indian governmental ministries during the summer and autumn of 2010, in particular with the
Advisor to the Prime Minister and the National Security Advisor where Devas delivered
presentations on its history, accomplishments and progress on collaboration with the Government
of India,'*° no concerns about the Devas Project or about Devas’ allocation in the S-band were

raised.'*!

In the Claimants’ perspective, it was the prospect of a further government scandal that caused
Dr. Radhakrishnan to seek to cancel the Devas Agreement and execute his “termination plan,”
and not any “crystalized” need of the military.'*? To support this contention, the Claimants rely
on a number of communications from DOT to Mr. Balachandhran, Additional Secretary of ISRO,

and to Dr. Radhakrishnan dated June 4, 2010 and June 14, 2010, respectively enclosing two

Statement of Defence, para. 42, citing Suresh Report, para. 15.1 (Ex. R-24/JCB-146) (emphasis by the

systems”; See Transcript, Day 1, 64:25-65:3.

newspaper articles and asking both officials to expedite their comments on them.'*? Following
such ications, Mr. Balachandk q d Antrix i diately to provide six copies of
the Devas Agreement, which was done the same day.'™ The allegation of the Claimants is that,
“within two days of receiving the unwelcome news of another potential government scandal,” '*°
on June 16, 2010, Dr. Radhakrishnan sought ways of annulling the Devas Agreement by sending
two memoranda to the DOT and the Ministry of Law and Justice seeking advice as to how to
annul the Devas Agreement.'*°

In reply, the Respondent produces a letter from the Ministry of Defence addressed to the ISRO
dated April 23, 2010 in which the latter provided its estimated bandwidth requirements in respect
of Army, Airforce and Navy up to year 2022.'*” In accordance with the letter, the demand for S-
band in particular would increase up to 52.5 MHz by 2017 and to 102.5 MHz by 2022. The
Respondent further cites the letter from Dr. Suresh to Dr. Radhakrishnan dated June 7, 2010 to

prove the delivery of the Suresh Report to the latter on the same date.'**

The Respondent explains that the two memoranda from Dr. Radhakrishnan on June 16, 2010 only
followed the letter from the Ministry of Defence and the receipt of the Suresh Report, rather than
the two newspaper articles as the Claimants assert.'*° The purpose of these memoranda, contrary
to the Claimant’s allegation, was to consult DOT and the Ministry of Law and Justice regarding

whether, rather than how, the Devas Agreement needed to be annulled in order firstly, to preserve

the S-band spectrum for the strategic requirements of the nation and, secondly, to ensure a level
140

playing field for the other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.
In a note responding to Dr. Radhakrishnan’s memorandum, Mr. Viswanathan, Advisor to the
Minister for Law and Justice, indicated that, during a discussion with Dr. Radhakrishnan, it was
mentioned that after the conclusion of the Devas Agreement new strategic needs emerged which
required accommodation in the S-band.'*! He noted that, given that Devas Agreement would give
Devas 90% of the capacity of the satellites in the S-band, the result was that there would be little

142

space available in the satellite for catering for strategic demands.'** The Advisor also gave his

opinion as to how the Agreement could be annulled through the invocation of its termination

provisions. 43

On the other hand, DOT advised Dr. Radhakrishnan that “the spectrum planned by DOS for

strategic use is not to be shared with commercial applications as in the case of [Devas].”'*

Considering that the Devas Agreement would allow Devas to offer BWA services in India, DOT
further noted that in India, in accordance with the 2008 National Frequency Allocation Plan, only
a part of the S-band “has been enabled for BWA applications in view of the satellite based

strategic requirement projected by DOS.”'5 Regarding the potential terrestrial use of the S-band,

DOT mentioned the recommendation of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (the “TRAT”’)
that “spectrum other than the band 800, 900 and 1900 should be auctioned.” '"°

Following DOS’ consultations with DOT and the Ministry of Law and Justice, DOS requested
from Antrix the reports of its financials since inception and those of Devas and was provided
therewith. '*” Through Dr. Radhakrishnan, DOS brought the Devas Agreement to the attention of
the Space Commission, in the form of a note during a regularly scheduled meeting,'* and sought

guidance on a further course of action.’ In this note, DOS referred to three reasons for examining

 

 

the Devas Agr the d ds of strategic requi the of of the A

which did not observe the principle of non-exclusiveness when allotting S-band to private players;
and the lack of consultation with DOT over a service that includes terrestrial connectivity. '*° The
Claimants point to a statement in this note to the effect that, on June 16, 2010, when
Dr. Radhakrishnan approached the Ministry of Law and Justice for the above reasons, he did so
“to request Ministry of Law and Justice to give its opinion as to how to annul the contract.”!*!
After its deliberations, the Space Commission concluded that DOS, “in view of priority to be
given to nation’s strategic requirements including societal ones may take actions necessary and
instruct [Antrix] to annul the [Devas Agreement],”!*? and that “Department may evolve a revised
utilization plan for GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A satellites, taking into account the strategic and societal

imperatives of the country.” !**

for strategic requirements of [India] and (ii) to ensure a level playing field for other service
providers using terrestrial spectrum.”'** The ASG issued his Opinion on July 12, 2010 (the
“Opinion of the ASG”).

The Opinion of the ASG revisited the background of the Devas Agreement and India’s need of
the S-band spectrum “for strategic and societal applications” of several Indian agencies, including
the armed forces and Indian Railways.'*° Thereafter, the Opinion of the ASG reviewed the terms
oo157

of the Devas Agreement to identify “justifiable or legal grounds existing for [its] termination,

namely Article 11(b) of the Agreement, containing the force majeure clause.

The Opinion of the ASG concluded that “any policy taken by the Government of India with regard
to allocation and use of S bandwith [sic] [...] would fall within the doctrine of force majeure, as
envisaged in the [Devas Agreement],” and it considered “more prudent” that such decision be
taken by means of “a policy decision having the seal and approval of the Cabinet,” and not by
DOT, since “to disable one of the parties to perform its obligations under the contract, the act

must be an act by the governmental authority acting in its sovereign capacity.” !**

In the Claimants’ view, the Opinion of the ASG suggests that the Respondent was to concoct a

force majeure event based on a “policy” decision having the “seal and approval of the Cabinet,” !*°

and on India’s new alleged needs for national strategic requirements for the S-band spectrum that
had been allocated to Devas, even though no such need was ever expressed to Devas in its many
meetings with India’s government agencies and officials.'

The Respondent rejects the Claimants’ characterization of the Opinion of the ASG, maintaining
that there is no indication that the security reasons motivating the decision were contrived,
concocted, engineered or fabricated or that the Devas Agreement should be terminated for

commercial reasons. According to the Respondent, the Opinion of the ASG merely reflects the

Opinion of Mr. Mohan Parasaran, Additional Solicitor General of India, to Secretary, Department of Space,
July 12, 2010 (the “Opinion of the ASG”), p. 3 (Ex. R-30/JCB-165).

view that the Government of India had the absolute right to terminate the Devas Agreement for

5. DOS’ Note for the CCS and the CCS’ Decision to Annul the Devas Agreement

The Respondent explains that, as mandated by the Space Commission in its decisions taken at its
July 2, 2010 meeting, the Additional Secretary of the Department of Space, Mr. G.
Balachandhran, was asked to review the Suresh Report and provide his comments so that

appropriate internal actions could be taken.'°

Mr. Balachandhran issued his report on January 9, 2011 (the “Balachandhran Report”).'®
According to the Balachandhran Report, the allocation of S-band spectrum to Devas under the
Devas Agreement would not “leave enough spectrum for ISRO/DOS use if required”! and
expressed views that “[s]trategic and other essential needs of [India] should be the first priority”!
in any such allocation. In this regard, the Balachandhran Report noted that Antrix had failed to
consult with the ICC regarding the national needs of S-band spectrum prior to the conclusion of
the Devas A 166 The Balachandhran Report luded that the termination of the Devas

Agreement ordered by the Space Commission “need[s to] be expedited.”'”

On February 8, 2011, at a press conference initiated by Dr. Radhakrishnan together with
Dr. Kasturirangan, then senior member of Antrix, the Space Commission’s decision to annul the
Devas Agreement was announced.'®* Dr. Radhakrishnan revealed that DOS had instituted a
review of the Devas Agreement in December 2009, and that the decision to cancel the Devas

Agreement had been taken in July 2010 by the Space Commission in light of the “high priority

for the country’s strategic requirements and the societal applications which have to be met using

the S-band spectrum that is in the possession of ISRO.”!©

DOS also commissioned Mr. Balachandhran with the preparation of a Note for the CCS, which
was finalized on February 16, 2011 (the “Note for the CCS”).'”

The stated purpose of the Note for the CCS was to seek approval of the CCS for the annulment
of the Devas Agreement “in view of priority to be given to nation’s strategic requirements
including societal ones.”'7! This Note also identified a number of demands for S-band spectrum

2

from several defence and security agencies in India'’* and summarized the deliberations of the

July 2010 meeting of the Space Commission. !°

On February 9, 2011, the Indian Prime Minister constituted a “High Powered Review Committee”
chaired by Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi (the “Chaturvedi Committee”).'”* The Chaturvedi Committee’s
mandate was the same as for the Suresh Committee (i.e. “review the technical, commercial,
procedural and financial aspects of the [Devas Agreement]”),!” but it was also required to “tak[e]
into account the report of internal review conducted by [DOS],” as well as the “review mandated

by the Space Commission at its [...] meeting, held on July 2, 2010.”!

On February 17, 2011, the CCS took the decision to annul the Devas Agreement. On the same
day, the Government of India issued a press release announcing that the CCS had decided to annul

the Devas Agreement. The press release reads in full:

CCS Decides to Annul Antrix-Devas Deal

Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has decided to annul the Antrix-Devas deal. Following
is the statement made by the Law Minister, Shri M. Veerappa Moily on the decision taken
by the CCS which met in New Delhi today:

“Taking note of the fact that Government policies with regard to allocation of spectrum have
undergone a change in the last few years and there has been an increased demand for
allocation of spectrum for national needs, including for the needs of defence, para-military
forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having
regard to the needs of the country's strategic requirements, the Government will not be able
to provide orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities, including for those which
are the subject matter of existing contractual obligations for S band.

  

In the light of this policy of not providing orbit slot in S Band to Antrix for commercial
activities, the ‘Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-Band
spacecraft by Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd.’ entered into between Antrix Corporation and
Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd. on 28th January, 2005 shall be annulled forthwith.”!77

Citing the decision of the CCS, Antrix, on February 25, 2011, gave notice to Devas that the Devas

Agreement was terminated.!”°
On March 12, 2011, the Chaturvedi Committee issued its report (the “Chaturvedi Report”).!”

According to the Claimants, the Chaturvedi Report implies that the foreign ownership of Devas
was a further motivating factor in the Government of India’s decision to annul the Devas

Agreement. '*°
The Respondent submits that two further commissions of enquiry reviewed the Devas Agreement.

First, following the issuance of the Chaturvedi Report, Mr. K.M. Chandrasekhar of the Cabinet
Secretariat was asked to examine its findings and to submit recommendations to DOS, which took

the form of a report issued on April 12, 2011 (the “Chandrasekhar Report”).'*!

reads: “The shareholding in Devas and changes in it subsequently have also been a serious cause of
concern..... The original proposal, which had envisaged development and innovation by some former ISRO
scientists, seem to have been diluted with the entry of major foreign players. While technically this was
permitted, the entry of foreign telecom companies with huge premiums indicated that they had used this as
an opportunity for entering the telecom market, which had in the meanwhile expanded rapidly in India
during 2005-10. This was not an intended purpose of the original agreement.”

The Respondent notes that the Chandrasekhar Report questioned Devas’ need for “such a huge
bandwidth;” and mentioned that the Chaturvedi Report characterized the allocation of S-band to
Devas as “an unjustified risk from the security point of view;” and signaled that full discussion
of Devas’ proposal at the ICC'*? would have enabled a well-considered assessment of how the

national interests of India could have been best served.'*?

Second, in accordance with a recommendation of the Chaturvedi Committee, a High Level Team
Committee was constituted by the Government of India to review the technical, commercial,
procedural and financial aspects of the Devas Agreement, which noted, in its September 2, 20011
report, several irregularities with Devas’ financing and recommended consideration of sanctions

against some officials. '**

3 THE ANNULMENT OF THE DEVAS AGREEMENT
1. Initial Reactions of Devas and Antrix to the Annulment of the Devas Agreement

According to the Claimants, following the announcement regarding the annulment of the Devas
Agreement,'* Devas attempted to communicate several times with Dr. Radhakrishnan without

success. '8°

On February 25, 2011, Antrix issued a letter to Devas giving notice of termination of the Devas

Agreement.'*”

In response, Devas objected to the validity of the termination notice'** and attempted,
unsuccessfully, to hold “senior management” consultations in conformity with the pre-dispute

procedures in Article 20 of the Devas Agreement.'*

On April 15, 2011, Antrix tendered Devas a check for the INR equivalent of USD 13 million as
reimbursement of the upfront capacity reservation fees that Devas had already paid to Antrix
pursuant to Article 7(c) of the Devas Agreement.’ In a matter of days, Devas returned Antrix’s
check, arguing that Antrix had failed to state a proper basis for terminating the Devas Agreement

and that the events allegedly giving rise to Antrix’s claim of force majeure were self-induced. '*!

Finally, the Claimants allege that, since 2011, Devas has been subject to a range of harassing
measures from various parts of the Indian government, including its Registry of Companies,
India’s enforcement directorate, tax authorities and other government entities.!°? The Claimants
characterize these measures as retaliation in response to the exercise of rights by Devas and the

Claimants, respectively. !°*

2 The Satellites

According to the Respondent, DOS has made alterations to the two satellites to conform them to
defence needs,'”* and the GSAT-6 satellite was scheduled to be launched at the end of 2014.! A

successful launch was achieved on August 27, 2015.'°°

On August 31, 2015, the Respondent submitted a set of documents in connection with the launch
of the GSAT-6 satellite. The documents consist of five newspaper articles and a note from Mr.
V.K. Pant, Assistant Wireless Adviser, in DOT. The articles refer to the launch of a military

satellite but simultaneously indicate that the satellite is utilized to serve the “strategic sector” and

“various government purposes”. The note contains an extract of the document issued by the
Cabinet to the Ministry of Defence on March 12, 2015 which reads: “The band segments (a) 2500-
2635 MHz (35MHz) (b) 2555-2535 MHz (80 MHz) and (c) 2655-2690 MHz (35 MHz) will be

used for Defence, security and societal applications.”

The Respondent further submitted an article published by the Institute of Defence Studies and
Analyses on October 5, 2015 which, according to the Respondent, “reviewed the launch and its

significance for the military.”

3. Related Arbitration Proceedings

As noted above, on June 29, 2011 Devas commenced an arbitration under the ICC rules pursuant
to Article 20 of the Devas Agreement, captioned Devas Multimedia (Private) Limited v. Antrix
Corp. Ltd. (No. 18051/CYK), in which Devas sought both specific performance of the Devas
Agreement and/or damages.'®’ On 14 September 2015, a final award was issued in this
Arbitration, which was communicated, by agreement of the Parties, to the present Tribunal on
October 2, 2015. Under that award, Antrix was ordered to pay USD 562.5 million to Devas
Multimedia Private Limited for damages caused by Antrix’s wrongful repudiation of the Devas

Agreement, plus interest.

The Respondent also notes that DT Asia (Devas’ other major shareholder together with the
Claimants) has instituted a third arbitration against India arising out of the same facts but under

the bilateral investment treaty between Germany and India.'**

Pursuant to mutual agreement, the Parties made simultaneous submissions on October 9 and 19,
2015 as to what significance, if any, the ICC final award might have on the deliberations of this
Tribunal. While drawing different conclusions from various parts of the ICC award, both Parties

recognized that the two arbitrations involve distinct claims, parties, and remedies.

Reference was made by the Claimants to the final award of the ICSID tribunal in Mobil v.

Venezuela.’ In that instance, one of the claimants, Mobil Cerro Negro, had brought separate ICC

proceedings against two State-owned companies, under one of their agreements providing for

indemnity in the event of certain alleged discriminatory government measures.
When considering the effects of the prior ICC arbitration, the ICSID tribunal observed:

It is clear that the ICC Award and the present case concern the liability of different parties

under different normative regimes. The State was not a party to the ICC arbitration. Neither

are PDVSA and PDVSA-CN parties to this case. These proceedings concern the

responsibility of the State for breach of the Treaty and international law, a matter that was

not (and could not) have been resolved by the ICC tribunal, which jurisdiction was limited

to the contractual dispute.?”
Similarly, in the present case, there are major differences with the ICC case. First of all, the parties
are different; neither Devas Multimedia (Private) Limited (the claimant in the ICC case) nor
Antrix (the respondent) are parties to this case. Secondly, the proceedings in this case relate to the
responsibility of the State of India for alleged breaches of the Treaty and international law, while
the ICC tribunal was strictly concerned with Antrix’s contractual liability under the Agreement.
It dealt more specifically with the actions of Dr. Radhakrishnan in his capacity as Chairman of
Antrix. It also referred to some of his activities in his other functions. In that respect, it considered
some of the same facts as those submitted to this Tribunal; in fact, the Tribunal was informed by
the Claimants in their response of October 19, 2015 that, during the ICC proceedings, the
Respondent had provided the tribunal with the whole transcript of the hearing in this case.
However, what this Tribunal is called upon to address is not whether Antrix breached its
contractual obligations but whether the State of India, acting in its sovereign capacity and through
the appropriate authority, properly invoked the protection of its essential security interests when
it decided to annul the Devas Agreement or whether, in doing so, it breached its obligations under
the Treaty and international law. This is the issue which this Tribunal will be addressing in the
rest of this award. While the Tribunal should “attempt to avoid inconsistent outcomes whenever

possible,”?"!

one can readily conceive situations where Antrix’s liability would be incurred under
the Agreement and some where the Respondent’s would be exempt of liability under the Treaty

and vice-versa.

(c) Declaring that Respondent has failed to accord fair and equitable treatment to the

(d) Declaring that Respondent has engaged in unreasonable and/or discriminatory

(g) | Ordering that these proceedings continue for the purposes of determining the

The Respondent requests that “all claims raised by [the] Claimants should be dismissed and all
costs arising of this proceeding should be assessed against [the] Claimants.”?”

In addition, the Respondent raises a series of objections to the Tribunal’s consideration of the
merits of the Parties’ dispute. First, the Claimants’ alleged investments fail to meet the definition
of an investment under the Treaty and constitute “pre-investment” activities that are not protected
by the Treaty. Secondly, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over the
claims in this case by operation of the “essential security interests” (“ESI’) provision of the
Treaty. The Claimants reject all of these objections and submit that the Tribunal has jurisdiction

over its claims.

  

” FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE
TREATY

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty defines an “investment” as “every kind of asset established or
acquired under the relevant laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment is made.” Moreover, Article 2 of the Treaty restricts the scope of the Treaty to
“investments made by investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other

Contracting Party, accepted as such in accordance with its laws and regulations.”

L The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s primary contention is that this case “only involves pre-investment activities
that are outside the scope of protection afforded by the [Treaty].”?" In support, the Respondent
relies on the “admission clause model” adopted in its BITs, which only extends protection to

“assets invested and admitted in accordance with the laws and regulations of the host State,” and

99205 206

not to “pre-investment activities,”*”’ and advances authorities to that effec

According to the Respondent, the Devas Agreement is clear that certain essential governmental
licences and approvals were prerequisites to the project, including the orbital slot frequency
allocation for the satellites and the WPC License.” Accordingly, Devas’ failure to apply for the
WPC License rendered all activities conducted by Devas as being properly characterized as “pre-

investments.”?

The Respondent refers to the WPC, the body within DOT from which, it says, Devas would have
been required to seek its operating license and frequency allocation (the “WPC License”).””
According to the Respondent, the policy decision of the CCS not only meant that the Devas
Agreement would be terminated, but it also left no doubt that no license could be issued to Devas
to operate the Devas System and therefore Devas would be unable to obtain the requisite licenses
under the Devas Agreement.?!°

The Respondent focuses on a terrestrial spectrum license to be issued by the WPC.?"! In this
regard, the Respondent refers to Devas’ Statement of Claim in the ICC arbitration, wherein Devas
acknowledges that it “fully expected that it would be granted a [WPC License] once the GSAT-6

satellite had been launched,” that Devas was preparing a license application to the WPC and that

Devas “was [...] in a position to submit this application just as soon as the satellite launch date

and vehicle were identified by ISRO.”?!?

In this regard, the Respondent argues that any preparatory steps cannot be equated with the grant
of a license, which Devas needed, did not have, and had no legal right to obtain, as it was for the
Government of India to determine whether a license could be issued.?"*

The Respondent submits that the Statement of Claim plainly demonstrates Devas’ awareness that
it had no right to obtain the WPC License.”!4 The Respondent claims that Devas was deliberately
deferring the submission of its WPC License application until after the satellites were launched
in order to place itself in the position of being the only alternative, “as a practical matter,” capable
of using the S-band spectrum allocated to it.7!* Devas would have then been in a position to force

the Government of India (i.e. the TRAJ) to change its policy?!®

regarding BSS, which would have
been necessary to obtain the specific WPC License for BSS that Devas needed in order to provide

Devas Services.7!”

According to the Respondent, other items in the record also demonstrated Devas’ knowledge that
it had no acquired right to obtain the WPC License.”!* First, the negotiating history of the Devas

Agreement shows that Antrix went from being required to obtain “clearances, licenses, and other
approvals” for “frequency allocation” (including terrestrial augmentation) in the Term Sheet,?!”

to providing “appropriate technical assistance...on a best efforts basis” in the Devas

upon launch of PS1, Devas would have been in a position to commence its A/V broadcasting. In addition,
Devas (as the only entity with the right to lease transponder capacity on that satellite, or to use the 70 MHz
of S-Band spectrum allocated to it in the Devas Agreement) would, immediately upon launch of PS1, have
filed for a WPC license. As the sole holder of the Leased Capacity, as a practical matter, Devas was the
only operator capable of using the S-band allocated to it, and because Antrix had promised to assist in
obtaining any needed governmental license necessary for the Devas System, Devas had every reason to
expect to obtain a WPC license promptly, and, indeed, expected to receive such license for a nominal fee.”

Agreement.” Also, Devas itself acknowledged that ISRO’s support would be critical in the

license application,””' which suggests that obtaining such authorization was not a matter of

certainty.?”?

Moreover, regardless of the policy decision of the CCS and of the fact that Devas had no acquired
right to obtain the WPC License, the Respondent notes that Devas would still have had to
participate in a public auction of all the S-band spectrum to be used for terrestrial services, as the
TRAI recommended in July 2008 and the WPC confirmed in 2010.7? According to the
Respondent, this poses a significant hurdle as the auction price for the terrestrial use of the
spectrum would have been USD 1.24 billion, which would have substantially diminished the net
present value of Devas.”*

Also, the Respondent alleges that, under a long-standing TRAI policy, new terrestrial services
such as those proposed by Devas would have been subjected to review and analysis by the TRAI.
Moreover, other stakeholders would have been notified and given an opportunity to comment,”
including the terrestrial operators of telecommunication services who, as conceded by the
Claimants, had been clamoring for more spectrum—including the S-band—for the expansion of

their services.”

In this regard, the Respondent rejects the Claimants’ argument that, had the satellites been

launched, and assuming that the Devas Agreement had not been annulled, terrestrial operators

would not have been able to use the S-band frequencies that Devas would have been using for its

space-to-earth transmissions because of interference.””” In Mr. Sethuraman’s words:

If Devas was using a 10 MHz segment of S-band, say 2560-2570 MHz, in a particular region
for space-to-earth transmissions, a terrestrial operator could certainly use a different 10 MHz
segment (as in the CGC of the Devas system), say 2600-2610 MHz, in the same region. So
long as there is enough of a separation between the frequencies, interference is not an issue
for diverse services. It is only if Devas had been using these two 10 MHz segments in the
region, the first for space-to-earth transmissions and the second in its CGC, that terrestrial
operators could be “*boxed-out’ of that spectrum,” as Mr. Parsons claims.?28

 

  

The Respondent denies that Devas could have rolled out any satellite-based service without the
WPC License.” According to the Respondent, Mr. Sethuraman detailed during the Hearing on
Jurisdiction and Liability, how, even on the basis of the ISP and IPTV licenses, Devas would still
have required additional licenses or additional telecommunications media to provide any kind of

service,?*°

and how, in any event, obtaining the WPC License would have been the last step of a
well-structured process that Devas still had to follow.”*! For instance, the ISP License makes clear
that it could not prevail over national security concerns, and that its effectiveness would be subject
to any government regulation on satellite communication policy.”

In addition to the failure of the Claimant to obtain the WPC License, the Respondent also criticizes
the Claimants’ failure to “identify precisely the investment in question,” which it argues is not the
Claimants’ shares in Devas,”** but the allegedly binding right to proceed with the Devas project
pursuant to the Devas Agreement.?* To this end, the Respondent considers that the critical and
dispositive issue is that the relevant approvals were not obtained; without them the project could

not proceed; and that Devas had no contractual right to obtain those approvals.”**>

2 The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, the Respondent misconstrues both Articles 1 and 2 of the Treaty and
fails to take into account the actual facts concerning the Claimants’ investments.” The Claimants
argue that “the facts show that the investments indeed were admitted in accordance with Indian
law.”?57

The Claimants recall that the relevant “investments” comprise their respective shareholding
interests in Devas; and partial indirect ownership of Devas’ business assets.”** In arguing that
their shareholding interests qualified as “investments” falling within the scope of Articles 1 and
2, the Claimants rely on the general and specific definitions of “investment” pursuant to Article
1(a)(1) and the prior approval obtained from the Foreign Investment Promotion Board as
evidencing acceptance “in accordance with [India’s] laws and regulations.”?*? On the Claimants’
submission, the statement in Article 2 of the Treaty that an investment must be “accepted as such”
under Indian law means only that the investment must comply with laws governing admission of

foreign investments.”

Turning to the indirect ownership of Devas’ assets, the Claimants’ assert that the contractual rights
under the Devas Agreement and the proprietary Devas System satisfy the general and specific
definitions of “investment” contained in Article 1(a)(1).™! The Claimants do not dispute the need
for a license from the WPC in order for Devas to operate the terrestrial portion of the hybrid Devas
System.” However, the Claimants reject India’s attempt to characterize its activities as “pre-

investment” by reference to the approvals obtained from DOS officials and the Shankara

Committee and confirmation by Antrix dated February 2, 2006, that ISRO had the “necessary

approval for building, launching and leasing the capacity of S-band satellite.”*4*

In the Claimants’ view, the record shows that India—including through Antrix, DOS, ISRO and
the WPC—had consistently and proactively supported the Devas Agreement and System for
approximately six years. Had India continued to deliver on Antrix’s commitment, the Claimants
consider it inconceivable that the WPC License would not have been granted.” In this regard,
the Claimants point out that Devas started preparing its application for the Licence; however it
did not receive any answer. Relevantly, the Claimants point to the obligation of
DOS/ISRO/Antrix to provide technical assistance under the Devas Agreement, which included
jointly approaching the WPC with Devas when applying for this license."

The Claimants also reject the Respondent’s argument that a BSS license in the S-band was not
authorized under Indian policy and therefore could not have been granted to Devas.” Neither the
2002 nor the 2008 NFAP prohibited BSS licenses outright, as claimed by Mr. Sethuraman.™*
According to the Claimants, the text of the NFAP is clear: there is no per se rule precluding the
WPC from granting terrestrial licenses in the S-band.” Even more so, the license to re-use
satellite spectrum terrestrially for which Devas would have applied was perfectly consistent with
the 2002, 2008 and 2011 NFAPs.?*° If such a re-use license could never have been granted without
a change in policy, the Claimants contend that there would have been prior mention and
experimental licenses would not have been granted to Devas.”*! In this regard, it bears noting the
complete absence of any reference in the Note to the CCS that the terrestrial component was not

authorized under existing Indian policy.”

The Claimants also rely on the practice of other countries, including the United States, Europe

and Korea, which impose low or no fees for re-use of satellite spectrum.

Devas expected that
the advantages of efficiency and public benefit acknowledged by regulators in other countries
would also persuade the WPC to issue a frequency authorization and operating license to Devas,
and would be fully supported by ISRO/Antrix due to their “best efforts” obligation. Moreover,

the Claimants expected that such license would be issued to Devas for a reasonable fee in line

54

  

with international norms that had by then been established in other countries

In any event, the Claimants do not accept that the auction rule applicable to the allocation of
terrestrial spectrum would be indiscriminately applied to satellite spectrum that is used
terrestrially since the two types of spectrum are not comparable.”* In particular, the potential for
interference as a result of uncoordinated spectrum use would not have been completely
disregarded. Devas’ terrestrial re-use of the allocated S-band satellite spectrum would have
“boxed-out” any other potential user of terrestrial S-band spectrum.?© In such circumstances, the
Claimants submit, the reality is that an auction of S-band terrestrial spectrum would have been
moot as Devas would have been the sole bidder and operator capable of using the relevant portion

of S-band satellite.?*”

Finally, the Claimants argue that, even if Devas had not obtained the WPC License, it still had an
absolute right to receive the Leased Capacity from the ISRO satellites under the Devas
Agreement.”** Upon launching the satellites, Devas would have been in a position to roll out

satellite-only services, therefore providing the very societal applications proposed by India.”*°

All this shows, the Claimants submit, that Devas had secured a binding contract, obtained capital

and was established as a company in India at all relevant times from 2005 to 2011.7

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal will first address this threshold question to determine whether it has jurisdiction

over the present dispute between the Parties.

L. The Devas Agreement

There is no disagreement between the Parties with regard to the fact that the Devas Agreement

261

was concluded on January 25, 2005,*°' nor with regards to the fact that, at the Respondent’s
insistence, the Agreement was signed by Antrix, “the marketing arm of [the] Department of Space
and [...] the entity through which ISRO engages in commercial activities.”*°? Under the
Agreement, a number of approvals and licenses had to be obtained in part by Devas and in part

by Antrix.

The Respondent argues that no governmental body was party to the Agreement or gave any

commitment to grant the necessary approvals and licenses required under the Agreement.”® In its
view, as long as the WPC License was not obtained, the only recourses that the Claimants might

have were the ones against Antrix provided for under the Agreement.”

The present case is not a recourse against Antrix but a recourse against the State of India for
alleged breaches of the applicable Treaty. It is under the provisions of that Treaty that the Tribunal

must determine whether the Claimants qualify as investors.

2. Investment Under the Treaty

The question that the Tribunal has to address is a double-barreled one. It is whether the Claimants
are investors under the Treaty and, if so, whether they have made qualifying investments under

it.

The Respondent does not dispute that the Claimants are “investors” as defined under Article
1(1)(b) of the Treaty, being corporations “incorporated or constituted in accordance with the law

of [a] Contracting Party,” i.e. Mauritius.

The disagreement between the Parties is whether the dispute is in relation to an investment as
defined in Article 1(1)(a) of the Treaty. This Article, as in many other investment protection
treaties, contains a very broad definition of “investment.” It covers:

every kind of assets established or acquired under the relevant laws and regulations of the

Contracting Party in whose territory the investment is made, and, in particular, though not
exclusively, includes:

(i) movable and immovable property as well as other rights in rem such as mortgages, liens
or pledges;

(ii) shares, debentures and other form of participation in a company;

(iii) claims to money, or to any performance under contract having an economic value;

(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill, technical processes, know-how, copyrights, trade-
marks, trade-names and patents in accordance with the relevant laws of the respective

Contracting Parties;

wv

business concessions conferred by law or under contract, including any concessions to
search for, extract or exploit natural resources.
The Tribunal does not agree with the Respondent’s contention that this case “only involves pre-

investment activities that are outside the scope of protection afforded by [the Treaty].”

First, the Claimants’ “shares, debentures and any other form of participation” in Devas and their
indirect partial ownership of Devas business assets are assets “established or acquired under the
relevant laws and regulations” of the Respondent. The Claimants received the approval of the
Foreign Investment Promotion Board prior to their share subscriptions.”°* Moreover, the Tribunal
has received no evidence to the effect that the Claimants’ investment was not properly made

“under the relevant laws and regulations.”

Secondly, the Tribunal finds deficient the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants’ activities
were “only pre-investment activities” because their investment was the alleged right to proceed

with the Devas project pursuant to the Devas Agreement and because said project could not

proceed without the WPC License, which Devas had no right to receive under the Devas

Agreement.”

The Devas Agreement was a valid contract between Devas and Antrix, a State-owned commercial
corporation. It provided that Antrix was leasing to Devas space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix
S-band spacecraft. That leased capacity was on a non-pre-emptible basis, which meant that it
could not be “utilized or repurposed for use by another party during life of the satellite and when
this Agreement is effective and when Devas is not in default of its obligations or payments.”?°7
The Agreement spelled out, among other provisions, the period of the lease and its terms and
conditions, the contributions to be made as well as the circumstances and consequences of
termination by each party, including in the case of force majeure. It also provided that it would
become effective “on the date that ANTRIX is in receipt of all required approvals and
communicates to DEVAS in writing regarding the same.”?**

On February 2, 2006, Antrix informed Devas that “it has received the necessary approval for
building, launching and leasing capacity of S-band satellite, henceforth designated as INSAT-
4E,” adding that it “is now in a position to go ahead with the building and launch of the INSAT
4-E spacecraft and lease the capacity on the same to Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd, as per Agreement
No. Antrix/2003/DEVAS/2005 dated 28 January 2005.” The Agreement thereby became
effective on February 2, 2006.

Under the Agreement, the Claimants had to pay Upfront Capacity Reservation fees for the first
and the second satellites. They paid the first instalments as per the Agreement on June 21, 2006
for the first satellite (GSAT-6)°” and on June 18, 200777 for the second satellite (GSAT-6A);

these payments represented a total of about USD 13 million.

The Agreement also provided that Antrix was responsible for obtaining certain governmental
authorizations?” (which it did) and that Devas was responsible for obtaining others, with best
effort support from Antrix?” (which it obtained for two licenses but did not reach the point of
obtaining the third). But there is nothing in the Agreement which makes its validity dependent on
Devas obtaining such permits, and at no time during the course of the Agreement or at the time
of its annulment by Antrix was it argued by Antrix or any governmental authority that it was not
in full effect. The non-issuance of a governmental license may pertain to the quantum of damages
that may be claimed against the Respondent, if there was a breach of the Treaty, but it does not

pertain to the validity of the Agreement or whether an investment was made by the Claimants.

The lease was binding on both Antrix and Devas and, by itself, it was an investment with
significant value as was shown by the additional investment of some US$ 75 million in March

It has been established that the Claimants made significant investments in time and money in
Devas and that Devas honoured its obligations under the Agreement until its annulment by Antrix,

including the payment of Upfront Capacity Reservation Fees of some US$ 13 million.

As to the Respondent’s argument that the Claimants had no acquired right to obtain the WPC
License and that they had no guarantee that they would obtain such license, it is a matter that does
not go to the definition of investment for jurisdictional purpose but rather to the value of that
investment. On the basis of the evidence received by the Tribunal, it is satisfied that, even without
a WPC license, Devas could have rolled out satellite-only services. The Tribunal also notes that
it has been satisfactorily established that, because of problems of interference, it would not have
been possible for competing services to operate in the same spectrum. The lack of a WPC license
would be a matter to be considered when deciding on the quantum of damages, if the Respondent

is found in breach of the Treaty.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that not only were the Claimants qualified investors under
Article 1(1)(b) of the Treaty but that they also made qualifying investments under Article 1(1)(a)
of that Treaty.

CHAPTER VI - THE “ESSENTIAL SECURITY INTERESTS” PROVISION

A.

INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE 11(3) OF THE TREATY IN CONTEXT

Article 11(3) of the Treaty provides:

The provisions of this Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting
Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is
directed to the protection of its essential security interests, or to the protection of public health
or the prevention of diseases in pests or animals or plants.

 

The Respondent’s defence in this case rests on the “essential security interests” of the State, as
defined in this Article. The Parties have raised both legal and factual issues in connection with
this defence and before analyzing the facts relating to this issue, the Tribunal will first set out its
views on the legal interpretation to be given to Article 11(3) of the Treaty and other matters raised
by the Claimants relating to Articles 11(1) and 11(4), which can be summarized in the following

questions:

(a) | What constitutes “essential security interests”?

(b) Does Article 11(1) of the Treaty allow for the introduction of customary international law

restrictions imposed on a state of necessity defence?

(c) Can the Claimant invoke Article 11(4) of the Treaty?

(d) Does Article 11(3) preclude an entitlement to compensation?

L What Constitutes “Essential Security Interests”?

a. Can “Essential Security Interests” Be Construed as a Matter of Self-
judgment by the Respondent?

i. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent submits that Article 11(3) of the Treaty is of “central importance [...] on the facts

99275

of this case’ as it entitles India “to take measures directed to the protection of its essential
security interests without incurring responsibility under any substantive provision of the [...]

Treaty otherwise providing protection to investors.”?”°

The Respondent considers that the Tribunal may only examine whether a measure is related to
national security matters. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal may not “sit as a supranational
regulatory or policy-making body to review the policy decisions of the Cabinet Committee on
Security” as national authorities “are uniquely positioned to determine what constitutes a State’s

essential security interests in any particular circumstance and what measures should be adopted

277

 

to safeguard those intere:

The Respondent refers to an UNCTAD study on a clause of the Peru-Singapore investment treaty
which contains language identical to Article 11(3) of the Mauritius-India BIT. That study

considers that this provision “establishes objective conditions for invoking the (security)

exception, (but its) practical effect comes very close to a self-judging clause.”?”*

ii. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants do not accept India’s argument, which is premised on a characterization of Article

11(3) of the Treaty as “self-judging,”’” by reference to the consistent and emphatic rejection of

280

this notion by the International Court of Justice,*® and universally reaffirmed by arbitral

tribunals.?8!

Moreover, the Claimants submit that the language of this provision affords no basis for inferring

that its application is self-judging. Such an application, according to the Claimants, requires “clear

99282

and specific language,”*** which is notably absent in the present case.

iii. The Tribunal’s Analysis

This first question can be disposed of quickly in this case as the Respondent itself has stated that
it is not arguing that “India (or Peru, or any other State having a treaty with a similar provision

[to Article 11(3) of the Treaty]) can dismiss any case simply by saying that it considers the actions

forming the basis of the claim to be in its ‘essential security interests.’”?**

Indeed, it is well established by judgments of the International Court of Justice (the “ICJ”)*** and

investment arbitration awards”** that, unless a treaty contains specific wording granting full

discretion to the State to determine what it considers necessary for the protection of its security

286

interests,**° national security clauses are not self-judging. Turning to the text of Article 11(3) of

the Treaty, it plainly does not contain any explicit language that the Tribunal would regard as

granting discretion of that nature to the State.

Self-judging “essential security interests” provisions are far from being unknown in international law. See,
for instance, Article XXI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1947 (“GATT”): “Nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed: (a) to require any contracting party to furnish any information the disclosure
of which it considers contrary to its essential security interests; or (b) to prevent any contracting party from
taking any action which it considers necessary for the ion of its essential security interests...
(emphasis added); Article 6.12 of the Comprehensive Economic Cooperation Agreement between the
Republic Of India and the Republic of Singapore, signed on June 29, 2005: “1. Nothing in this Chapter
shall be construed: (a) to require a Party to furnish any information, the disclosure of which it considers
contrary to its essential security interests; or (b) to prevent a Party from taking any action which it considers
necessary for the protection of its essential security interests...” (emphasis added); Article 18 of the Treaty
between The United States of America and The Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the

Treaty shall be construed: 1. to require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the disclosure
of which it determines to be contrary to its essential security interests; or 2. to preclude a Party from
applying measures that it considers necessary for the fulfil of its ot i with respect to the
maintenance or restoration of international peace or security, or the protection of its own essential security
interests” (emphasis added); Article 18 of the Treaty between The Government of The United States of
America and The Government of The Republic of Rwanda Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal
Protection of Investment, signed on February 19, 2008: “Nothing in this Treaty shall be construed: 1. to
require a Party to furnish or allow access to any information the disclosure of which it determines to be
contrary to its essential security interests; or 2. to preclude a Party from applying measures that it cons
necessary for the fulfillment of its obligations with respect to the maintenance or restoration of international
peace or security, or the of its own essential security interests” IE added).

However, while the Parties agree that the Tribunal may examine whether the preconditions to
invoke the essential security clause have been met, they disagree as to the meaning or content of
the preconditions laid down in the clause. The Tribunal must therefore address the following

question.

b. What Conditions Must the Respondent Meet to Show that its Measures
Were “Directed to the Protection of its Essential Security Interests”?

i. | The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that the determinations by national authorities as to what constitutes

”"?87__a view that it

“essential security interests” should be afforded “a wide measure of deference
says is supported by commentators and international jurisprudence.”** Essentially, the Respondent
cautions against “second-guessing” by international tribunals of national security determinations
made by national authorities.” The Respondent refers again, in that respect, to the UNCTAD
study on the Peru-Singapore investment and notes that “only in extreme cases will an arbitral
tribunal conclude that the host country measure has no relation whatsoever to the national security
interests of a party.”?°°

In the present case, the Respondent contends that the policy decision of the CCS, in its capacity
as the highest authority in India for matters of internal and external security and defence, takes
into consideration the growing demands of the Indian military for S-band capacity, which
undoubtedly form part of the Respondent’s essential security interests.?°' Furthermore, the
Respondent refers to the express terms of the decision of the CCS and the extensive record, which

plainly reflect the strategic needs for spectrum capacity.””? Moreover, the fact that the Claimants

were not included in the national security deliberations, of which the Claimants complain, is not

significant given the sensitive nature of such issues.?**

The Respondent criticizes the Claimants’ failure to engage directly on this provision and
characterizes its only submission as a suggestion that the Tribunal “disregard all [...] evidence and
hold that the entire national security establishment of the Government acted in bad faith and with
no motive other than to cause damage to Devas and its shareholders.”?** Such an argument, the
Respondent contends, “cannot be countenanced under well-established principles of both Indian

and international law.”?°°

ii. The Claimants’ Position

Given that India’s claim to essential security is not self-judging, the Claimants submit that an
international tribunal has the power to conduct “an objective inquiry into whether an essential
security clause was validly invoked and whether its conditions are satisfied.” The Claimants
do not accept that India has made out the requisite elements by reference to the evidentiary record,

99297

which has not established that the measures were “directed at any security interest”*”’ and, in any

event, the “disproportionate and gratuitous nature” of these measures “fails to meet the standard

of necessity observed by customary international law.”?**

As to the Claimants, they consider that two objective preconditions need to be fulfilled for the

essential security clause to be triggered.

. The Tribunal must first verify whether a measure was aimed at the protection of the

Respondent’s security interests. In their view, the measure must be specifically directed at

299

  

the State’s essential security intere:

. Additionally, the Claimants construe a requirement of necessity from the words “essential
security interests.” In other words, the Tribunal must verify that the security interest in

question is so “vital...absolutely necessary; extremely important” that protection must be

warranted, and that such interest is actually under a threat that warranted the asserted

measures of protection.*”
The Claimants engage in a word-by-word analysis of the essential security clause to define the

meaning of the objective conditions that are required to invoke the security exception.

First, according the Claimants, the use of the words “directed to” in the Article 11(3) implies that
the Respondent’s measures in question must have been “aimed at the protection of India’s security
interests.” Measures that are not actually directed at the protection of such interests do not
qualify.*°!

Second, the use of the word “essential” implies that the security interest in question must be so
“vital...absolutely necessary; extremely important” such that protection is warranted. According
to the Claimants, the literal meaning of the term “essential” is “important...absolutely necessary,
indispensably requisite...unavoidable;”*? The Claimants invoke several legal authorities in

support of this statement, including the following:

. In the Nicaragua case, it had been claimed that the various actions directed against the
Nicaraguan government were justified on “essential security” grounds. Rejecting this

claim, the ICJ held that:

No evidence at all is available to show how Nicaraguan policies had in fact become a threat
to “essential security interests” in May 1985, when those pol:
consistently criticized by the United States, for four years previously, the Court is ‘unable to

find that the “embargo” was necessary to protect those interests. *°”

 

   

. In a similar vein, the Claimants rely on the Oil Platforms*™ and the Total v. Argentina*®
cases to argue that the nature of the security interest to be protected must be “absolutely
necessary, extremely important,” and that such interest was actually under a “threat” that

warranted the asserted measures of “protection.”

. Finally, the Claimants argue that, in any event, the customary standard of necessity
appearing in Article 25 of the Articles on State Responsibility adopted by the International
Law Commission (the “ILC Articles”) applies to Article 11(3) of the Treaty by operation
of Article 11(1).*” In the Claimants’ view, there exists in customary international law a
regime governing the same issue dealt with by Article 11(3), i.e. the extent to which a State
may respond to the alleged threats to the “essential interests” of the State. And, if these
customary rules impose a “stricter” set of requirements on the host State, then the
customary rules also qualify under Article 11(1) because they afford the Claimants

treatment more favourable than that provided for by Article 11(3).

iii. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal faces two distinct issues. The first issue concerns the interpretation of the terms of
Article 11(3) of the Treaty, which vies to determine the exact conditions that are required by this
provision to trigger an “essential security interests” exception, including in particular, whether
Article 11(3) includes a requirement of necessity to display its effects. A separate question
concerns whether the standard of necessity under customary international may apply, regardless

of the terms of the Treaty, in invoking the “essential security interests” clause.

As to the first issue, the Tribunal is faced with elucidating the meaning of Article 11(3) of the
Treaty within the framework of Articles 31 and 32 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of

Treaties (the “WCLT”).

Article 31 of the VCLT makes clear that any interpretation must rest primarily on the ordinary
meaning of the text of the treaty, only to be supplemented by considerations of content, object
and purpose if the ordinary meaning of the text is not clear. In performing this exercise of
interpretation, the Tribunal must be particularly cautious not to rephrase or otherwise alter the

plain meaning of the text, which is considered to reflect the common intention of the Contracting

Parties.*** In the words of the El Paso v. Argentina tribunal, “the content of the treaty’s provisions

is paramount, and what is not there cannot be read into them.”*”

Also, pursuant to Article 32 of the VCLT, the Tribunal may only resort to supplementary means
of interpretation if the outcome of an interpretation conducted under Article 31 of the VCLT
“Jeaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure, or...leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or

unreasonable.”

The first condition laid down in Article 11(3) of the Treaty that the Tribunal must consider
concerns the nexus that must exist between the State measures at stake and the essential security
interests of the State for the exception to be triggered, which is embodied in the terms “directed

to.

In that respect, the Tribunal is mindful of the broad terms of Article 11(3) of the Treaty. It clearly
provides that the Treaty “shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply
prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or to take any action which is directed to the protection of

its essential security interests...” [Tribunal’s underlining.]

In the Tribunal’s view, while these terms provide the State with considerable freedom as to the
action it can take, it is important to note that such action must be directed not to any security
interest but only to “essential security interests.” Measures that would not actually be directed to

the protection of the essential security interests would not qualify.
This parameter will guide the Tribunal when applying the law to the facts of this case.

However, the Parties disagree on the existence of a requirement of necessity in Article 11(3) of
the Treaty, such that the “essential security interests” exception could only be triggered when the

State measures are “necessary” for the protection of the State’s national security.

It is worth noting that the word “necessity” or any reference thereof is absent in the ESI clause.
By contrast, all of the cases on which the Claimants rely to advance a requirement of necessity

are based on a Treaty in which the relevant ESI clause expressly contains the word “necessary”

See R.K. Gardiner, Treaty Interpretation (Oxford University Press 2008), p. 145, citing R.H. Berglin,

and therefore included necessity as an objective precondition for provoking the exception. In
particular, CMS,*!° Enron,*"' Sempra,*"? LG&E,*° Continental Casualty*'* and El Paso! were
all brought under the aegis of the 1991 Argentina-U.S. BIT which reads at Article XI: “(t)his
treaty shall not preclude the application by either Party of measures necessary [Tribunal’s
underlining] for the maintenance of public order, the fulfilment of its obligations with respect to
the maintenance or the restoration of international peace or security, the protection of its own

essential security interests.”

The UNCTAD study mentioned above identifies four basic approaches relating to the issue of
necessity in international investment agreements (“IIAs”): (1) self-judging clauses; (2) necessity

as objective precondition; (3) no reference to necessity; and (4) exclusion of judicial review.

That study clearly brings the Mauritius-India BIT under the third category where there is no
mention of the requirement of necessity and it is sufficient that the measures be “directed to the
protection of its essential security interests.” As an example, it refers specifically to the Hungary-
India BIT (2003) which contains a national security clause practically identical with the present
one. Article 12 of that BIT reads in part as follows: “[...] nothing in this Agreement precludes the

host Contracting Party from taking action for the protection of its essential security interests or in

 

circumstances of extreme emergency in accordance with its laws normally and reasonably applied
on a non-discriminatory basis.” [Tribunal’s underlining.) The Study also mentions the Peru-
Singapore BIT (2003) which uses wording similar to the Mauritius-India BIT. Its Article 11 reads
as follows: “The provisions of this Agreement shall not in any away limit the right of either
Contracting Party to apply prohibitions or restrictions of any kind or to take any other action
which is directed to the protection of its essential security interests, or to the protection of public

health or the prevention of diseases and pests in animals or plants.” [Tribunal’s underlining.]

The UNCTAD study concludes as follows: “Although the two examples above establish objective
conditions for invoking the exception, their practical effect comes very close to a self-judging
clause. Only in extreme cases will an arbitral tribunal conclude that the host country measure has

no relation whatsoever to the national security interests of a party.” This would caution against

imposing a requirement of necessity in ESI clauses unless it can be clearly inferred from the terms
of the clause. In the words of the El Paso v. Argentina tribunal: “... the content of the treaty’s
provision is paramount, and what is not there cannot be read into them.”*!°

The study would appear however to go too far in stating that such clauses are “very close to self-
judging clauses.” In situations like the one in this case or in those mentioned in the UNCTAD
study, a tribunal is called upon to assess whether the measure adopted by the State is not only
directed to the protection of its security but that it must also be for the protection of its essential
security interests. In the case of self-judging clauses, it suffices for the State to declare, in its
discretion, that it considers the adopted measure necessary for the protection of its security
interests.*!”

While, in the present case, the Respondent does not have to demonstrate necessity in the sense
that the measure adopted was the only one it could resort to in the circumstances, it still has to
establish that the measure related to its essential security interests; it cannot therefore be any
security interest but it has to be an “essential” one. In that respect, the Tribunal has no difficulty
endorsing the definition of that word proposed by the Claimants and taken from the following
dictionaries: “Essential” definition (meanings 3(b), 4(a)), Oxford English Dictionary (2014)
(“important (...) absolutely necessary, indispensably requisite (...) unavoidable”);*'* “Essential”
definition (meaning 1), The Random House Dictionary of the English Language (1966)
(“absolutely necessary; indispensable”)*! “Essential” definition (meanings 2(a), 2(b)), Webster’s

Third New Int’l Dictionary (1976) (“necessary, indispensable, or unavoidable”).*”°

In performing this analysis, however, the Tribunal has also no difficulty in recognizing the “wide

measure of deference” mentioned by the Respondent.*”!
An arbitral tribunal may not sit in judgment on national security matters as on any other factual
dispute arising between an investor and a State. National security issues relate to the existential

core of a State. An investor who wishes to challenge a State decision in that respect faces a heavy

burden of proof, such as bad faith, absence of authority or application to measures that do not

relate to essential security interests.

2. Does Article 11(1) of the Treaty Allow for the Introduction of Customary International
Law Restrictions Imposed on a State of Necessity Defence?

a. The Claimants’ Position

246. In addition to invoking a “necessity” requirement into Article 11(3) of the Treaty, the Claimants
argue that, by virtue of Article 11(1), the Respondent must demonstrate that it meets the

conditions of a state of necessity defence under customary international law.
Article 11(1) of the Treaty reads as follows:

If the provisions of the law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international law
existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties, in addition to the
present Agreement, contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments and
returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to treatment more favourable than that
provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall, to the extent that they are more
favourable, prevail over the present Agreement.
247. According to the Claimants,*” Article 11(1) applies to Article 11(3), thereby allowing them to
claim the more restrictive standards imposed upon the Respondent by Article 25 of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility concerning a state of necessity defence. These Articles are

considered as a consolidation of current customary international law.
248. Article 25 reads as follows:

1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an
act not in conformity with an international obligation of that State unless the act:

(a) is the only way for the State to safeguard an essential interest against a grave and
imminent peril; and

(b) does not seriously impair an essential interest of the State or States towards which the
obligation exists, or of the international community as a whole.

2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a State as a ground for precluding
wrongfulnes:

 

(a) the international obligation in question excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or

(b) the State has contributed to the situation of necessity.

In the Claimants’ view, these strict requirements on a host State invoking a state of necessity must
be applied in the interpretation of Article 11(1) of the Treaty which allows them to make a claim
on the basis that they are entitled to a “treatment more favorable than that provided for by the
present Agreement,” including Article 11(3). Relying in particular on EDF International,*
Suez/AWG*> and Gabcikovo-Nagymaros,**° they argue that the Respondent must demonstrate
that “the wrongful act was the only way to safeguard (India’s) essential interest under Article

25(1)."5?7

b. — The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that Article 11(1) of the Treaty is not a vehicle which allows bringing
Article 25 of the ILC Articles into this case. According to it, Article 11(1) is nothing but a
“preservation of rights” clause—which provides that the Treaty is not designed to take away
substantive protections offered by international law—but “has nothing to do with the state of
necessity defence incorporated in Article 25 of the ILC Articles, which does not confer benefits
on private investors, but rather outlines a defence available to States under customary
international law.”*°8

Moreover, pointing out the clear and categorical text of Article 11(3) which states that “(t)he
provisions of this Agreement shall not limit in any way the right” of the State to protect its
essential security interests, the Respondent argues that Article 11(1) cannot negate the

applicability of Article 11(3).*”?

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal is of the view that Article 11(1) does not result in a restrictive application of Article
11(3). It is true that, when a State was invoking a “state of necessity” defence, the ICJ and a
number of arbitral tribunals**° have recognized the right of international investors to challenge
such defence under customary international law, on the basis that it was not the only way for a
State to safeguard its essential interests or that the State was at least partly responsible for the
situation which led a State to invoke a state of necessity situation (These are the only two

restrictions mentioned in Article 25 of the Articles that might apply in this case).

However, in face of the very clear and strong wording of Article 11(3), it would be strange to give
Article 11(1) preponderance over it. Indeed, Article 11(3) provides that “(t)he provisions of this
Agreement shall not in any way limit the right of either Contracting Party to apply prohibitions
or restrictions of any kind or take any other action which is directed to the protection of its

essential security interests [...]” [Tribunal’s underlining.]

Secondly, the Respondent is right in pointing out that the “preservation of rights” under
Article 11(1) of the Treaty has nothing to do with the “state of necessity” defence which, under
customary international law, is available to a State as a ground for precluding the wrongfulness

of an act which would otherwise be in breach of an international obligation of that State.

Finally, the Respondent in the present case is not invoking a state of necessity defence under
customary international law but, instead, the specific provision of Article 11(3) of the Treaty
concerning the protection of its essential security interest and it is the analysis of that provision
which will guide the Tribunal in determining whether or not the Respondent is in breach of the

Treaty.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the conditions attached to the state of necessity defence

under customary international law are not applicable in the present situation. The Tribunal

observes that this approach is consistent with that taken by the tribunal in Continental Casualty

v. Argentina*' and the annulment committee in CMS v. Argentina.**”

3. Can the Claimants Invoke Article 11(4) of the Treaty?
Article 11(4) of the Treaty provides:

Each Contracting Party shall, however, honour any obligation it may have entered into with
regard to investments of investors of the other Contracting Party.

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants advance two arguments based on Article 11(4) to preclude the Respondent from
invoking the “essential security interests” provision. First, the Claimants argue that the language
of Article 11(4) is intended to restrain the Respondent from acting inconsistently with its own
obligations. According to the Claimants, the Respondent owes obligations under the Devas
Agreement, which preclude the Respondent from now terminating its contractual

commitments. **

The Claimants maintain that the policy decision resulting in the annulment of the Devas
Agreement is affirmed by the Opinion of the ASG as “an act by the governmental authority acting
in its sovereign capacity.” In view of this statement, the Claimants do not consider it necessary to
reach the issue of whether Antrix’ actions are attributable to the State in order to conclude that
there has been an expropriation by India.** Yet, the Claimants advance a notion of agency and

rely on the “inseparability” of Antrix, DOS and ISRO in practice.**

Secondly, in the Claimants’ view, India is also precluded from invoking “essential security” to

“excuse situations of its own making” as evidenced by statements of a rule of general international

law to that effect in El Paso,*° Continental Casualty*” and LG&E.** In the present case, the
Claimants interpret the factual record as showing that “the allocation of the S-band to DOS for
‘commercial operations—the scenario that led to Devas signing the Devas Agreement—was the
result of conscious and deliberate policy-making on its part.’”*? Having recalled India’s
assessment of its national priorities from 1999 to 2008*”° and its conduct in allowing the Devas
Agreement to proceed, the Claimants submit that the Respondent cannot now “claim that it was
‘essential’ that these commercial uses be terminated” because it “supposedly formed a different

assessment of its “national needs at a later time.”

b. — The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent contends that the Claimants’ first argument proceeds on the flawed basis that
“the obligations under the Devas Agreement are the obligations of the Government, not Antrix”

when the factual record establishes that the Government had no such obligations.*”

The Respondent argues that Devas knew that the Government of India was not a party to the
Devas Agreement and maintained a distinct personality from Antrix for the purposes of the Devas

8 As to allegations that Antrix and the Government of India are “inseparable,”*“ the

Agreement.
very fact that the Claimants identify Antrix as the entity which entered into and annulled the
Devas Agreement upon the instructions of several governmental bodies shows that Antrix and the
Government of India are not “inseparable,” and Antrix did not enter into the Devas Agreement

“on behalf of the Government.” Rather, the negotiating history of the Devas Agreement shows

that Devas wanted ISRO to be its counterparty in the deal, which was not accepted and Antrix

ultimately signed the Agreement.*°

The Respondent then refers to what it characterizes as a “unanimous line of Indian authority”

rejecting conflation of the legal personalities of State-owned companies and the government,™°

as well as international authorities following the same trend.’ These authorities suggest that a
clear distinction must be drawn between Antrix, a “private company limited by shares” within the

meaning of the Indian Companies Act,**

and the Government of India. The Respondent notes the
Claimants’ failure to bring any Indian authority to support their position.” Moreover,
international authorities such as the ILC Articles lend further support to the Respondent's position
that the acts of Antrix are not attributable to the State, save in certain circumstances that are

inapplicable in the present case.*°°

See Transcript, Day 5, 1223:11-1224:22; 1227:15-20; Term Sheet (Ex. R-12/JCB-23). According to the
Respondent, the fact that Devas and Antrix (and not ISRO or DOS) were the parties to the Devas Agreement
is an undisputed material fact of the case; See, inter alia, Transcript, Day 5, 1268:20-1269:15.

In any case, even if Article 11(4) was applicable (which the Respondent denies), the Respondent
argues that the “essential security interests” provision would prevail on its clear and unambiguous

terms.**!

As to the Claimants’ second argument, the Respondent submits that the authorities and principle
relied upon, even if accepted as correct, are “totally irrelevant” for two reasons: India had no

contractual commitment of any kind to Devas nor did it “contribute” to any “crisis.”*°?

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis

In order to invoke Article 11(4), two requirements must be satisfied. First, the obligation
mentioned in Article 11(4) has to be one which the Respondent has itself entered into. Second,

the Respondent must fail to honour such an obligation.

The task of the Tribunal will therefore be to determine whether the Agreement constitutes such
an obligation and whether the annulment of the Agreement constitutes failure of the Respondent

to honour the obligation.

The Tribunal notes that, although stating that it is not necessary to decide on the attribution of
Antrix’s actions to the Respondent in order to conclude that there has been an expropriation, the
Claimants nonetheless rely on the “inseparability” of Antrix, DOS and ISRO in practice. This
latter claim is made particularly in connection with a breach of the FET standard, the Claimants
arguing that the Respondent cannot evade liability for its various bad faith actions by claiming

that they were solely attributable to Antrix.

Articles 4, 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles containing the applicable principles of attribution read as

follows:

Article 4. Conduct of organs of a State

. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State under international
law, whether the organ exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions,
whatever position it holds in the organization of the State, and whatever its character as
an organ of the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.

N

. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in accordance with the
internal law of the State.

Article 5. Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements
of governmental authority

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State under Article 4 but which
is empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental authority
under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in the capacity in the particular
instance.

Article 8. Conduct directed or controlled by the State
The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State under

international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the instructions of, or
under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct.

  

Article 4(2) of the ILC Articles makes clear that the legal personality of a State-owned company
is governed by domestic law. The acts of such a company can only be attributed en bloc to the

State when it is considered a governmental body under domestic law.

This view was confirmed by the ICJ in the Ahmadou Sadio Diallo case. The Court ruled that:

 

As the Court recalled in the Barcelona Traction case, “(t)here is ...no need to investigate the
many different forms of legal entity provided for by the municipal laws of States (I.C.J.
Reports 1970, p.34, para.40). What matters, from the point of view of international law, is to
determine whether or not these have a legal personality independent of their members. (...).
In determining whether a company possesses independent and distinct legal personality,
international law looks to the rules of the relevant domestic law.”**
In the present instance, the Respondent has provided clear evidence that Antrix cannot be
considered an organ of the State under Indian law. Antrix’s constituent documents make clear
that it is a “private company limited by shares” within the meaning of the Indian Companies

Act.

Even if the determination of the legal status of a State-owned company is a matter governed by
domestic law, the actions of such company may still engage the international responsibility of the
State. The acts of the company will have to be examined on a case-by-case basis, in light of ILC
Articles 5 and 8, to determine whether they constitute a breach of international law that may be

attributed to the State.

The Claimants however hold a different position. They rely on a notion of agency to argue that
“in assessing the Respondent’s liability, Antrix’s various actions ... should be directly attributed

to India.”**5 However, most of the authorities relied upon by the Claimants do not support the

existence of a notion of agency in international law, such that every act of an agent (including the
repeated assurances of Antrix’s support for the Devas System, referred to by the Claimants) may

be attributed to the State.

Thus, the Claimants rely on the Wintershall arbitration, in which the tribunal decided that the
State-owned company at stake operated “as an arm or agent of the Government” but only “as a

2356 ie. agency was found to exist on the basis of domestic law. The ICC

matter of Qatari law,
case Deutsche Schachtbau v. United Arab Emirates was a purely commercial case that concerned
the extension of an arbitration clause from a contract signed by a State entity to the State itself
through a multiplicity of contracts.**’ Moreover, in the Nykomb ICSID award, the tribunal decided
that, in the circumstances of the case, Latvia had to “be considered responsible for (the State’s
entity) actions under the rules of attribution in international law.”>** Finally, in Maffezini v. Spain,
the tribunal concluded that, for the exclusive purpose of determining the jurisdiction of ICSID, it
is sufficient if the investor is able to make a prima facie case that the relevant company/entity is
a State-entity acting on behalf of the Respondent State.*” Attribution matters were actually left

to be decided for the merits phase.*°°

Suffice it to say that ILC Articles 4, 5 and 8 do not provide general rules of attribution meaning
that any act can be attributed to the State if the requirement of structure, function or control is
met. The scope of these provisions is, rather, limited to conduct which constitutes a violation of
international law, and should not be confused with rules on agency as they exist under private
law.**!

There remains the provision of Article 8 of the ILC Articles concerning the conduct of a person
or group of persons directed or controlled by the State. In that circumstance, that conduct “shall

be considered as an act of a State under international law if the person or group of persons is in

fact acting on the instructions of, under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the

conduct.”

The Tribunal is of the view that “a person or group of persons” includes any corporation legally
created. One may wonder why Article 5 of the ILC Articles refers to “conduct of a person or
entity” while Article 8 mentions instead “persons or group of persons” but it is generally
recognized in modern legal systems that “person” includes not only a natural person but also a
legal person, such as a corporation. Moreover, the Mauritius-India BIT itself defines “investor”

362

as covering both a natural person*” and a legal person.*

The Tribunal notes in this regard that treaties concluded in the area of international investment
protection appear generally to include juridical entities, such as corporations, within the definition
of a “person.” To cite only two conspicuous examples, pursuant to Article 25(2) of the ICSID
Convention a “national of another Contracting State” is defined to include “any natural person”
and “any juridical person.”** Similarly, Article 13 of the MIGA Convention includes “any natural
person” and “any juridical person” within the ambit of “eligible investors.”**°

Finally, it would make no sense to impose a restrictive interpretation that would allow a State to
circumvent the rules of attribution by sending its direction or instruction to a corporate entity
rather than a physical person or group of physical persons. Even when addressed to a corporation,
the direction or instruction has to be received and acted upon by a person or a group of persons,

be they the chairman, the president or the board of directors of that corporation.

In the present case, having regard to the circumstances leading to the Devas Agreement as they
emerge from the pleadings of the Parties, the Tribunal concludes that, when entering into the
Agreement, Antrix was not acting as an organ of the Respondent, whether under the provisions
of Articles 4 and 5 of the ILC Articles. The Agreement itself does not constitute an obligation the

Respondent has entered into within the meaning of Article 11(4).

A question arises however as to whether, when Antrix served the Claimants with a notice of force
majeure, Antrix was acting “on the instructions of, or under the direction or control” of the

Respondent,*® as described in Article 8 of the ILC Articles.

It is important to note that Article 2 of the ILC Articles states that two conditions must be met for
the attribution to a State of an internationally wrongful act: (i) the act must be attributable to the
State under international law; and (ii) it must constitute a breach of an international obligation of
the State. The answer to these questions has nothing to do with the liability of Antrix for breach
of its contractual obligations under Indian law, a matter which has been dealt with by the ICC

tribunal referred to in the present award.
As stated by James Crawford and Simon Olleson:

It is important that international law, and in particular the law of State responsibility, should
not be made to do too much. In particular, international law should not be applied to decide
issues to which it is not properly applicable and a fortiori, should not be applied to decide
sues which, on analysis, are properly governed by a particular system of domestic law. As
will be seen, this is a particular danger with the rules of attribution, which are often prayed
in aid in relation to issues which in reality have nothing to do with questions of State
responsibility.

  

A similar line of thought was expressed by Michael Feit when he observed:

The basic difference between the principle of “piercing the corporate veil” and the rules of
attribution as reflected in the ILC Articles is that under the former, the contract itself is
attributed to the state, while under the latter, only the act which constitutes the breach of
international law is attributed for the purpose of state responsibility.*°

The interpretation of Article 8 of the ILC Articles has been the subject of helpful analysis in the
recent award and the decision on annulment relating to the Tulip Real Estate and Development
Netherlands B.V. v. Republic of Turkey case.*” In that case, the tribunal, by majority, ruled that
“while Emlak (the Turkish joint-venture partner of the claimant) was subject to TOKI’s (a State

Commission and under the direction of the Department of Space.” See Letter from B.S. Anantharamu,

maintenance and termination of the Contract is not attributable to the State under Article 8 of the

ILC Articles due to an absence of proof that the State used its control as a vehicle directed towards

 

achieving a particular result in its sovereign interests.”*”° The tribunal also concluded that purely
contractual claims were not covered by the relevant BIT.*”! Moreover, it unanimously decided
that the challenged actions, including those of TOKI, the Supreme Audit Board, the Prime

Ministry and the police, did not constitute violations of the relevant BIT.*””

Quoting the award approvingly, the annulment committee had this to say:

Relying thus on Article 8 and its Commentary, the Tribunal stated that:

The relevant enquiry remains whether Emlak was being directed, instructed or controlled by
TOKI with respect to the specific activity of administering the Contract with Tulip JV in the
sense of sovereign direction, instruction or control rather than the ordinary control by a
majority shareholder in the company’s perceived commercial interests.

 

The Committee has no doubt that the Tribunal correctly interpreted Article 8 of the ILC
Articles and applied the relevant test, that of effective control.”>7

The Tribunal endorses the analysis of Article 8 contained in the Tulip case; however, based on
the factual situation, the end result is quite different. While in the Tulip case, the tribunal
concluded that there was no evidence supporting attribution of Emlak’s acts to the State, there
can be no doubt that, in the present case, Antrix, in invoking force majeure, was “acting on the
instructions of, or under the direction or control of that State in carrying out the conduct,” to quote

Article 8.

Secretary of DOS advised Antrix that it would be unable to lease any transponders in the S-band

and that the Agreement “shall be annulled forthwith.”*”°

Having found that Antrix’s notice of annulment is attributable to the Respondent under Article 8
of the ILC Articles, it remains however to be determined whether, in the continuum of activities
which led to the annulment of the Devas Agreement, the Respondent breached the provisions of

the BIT—a question that the Tribunal will address in Chapters VII, VIII, IX and X of this Award.

4 Does Article 11(3) Prevent Entitlement to Compensation?
a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that “Article 11(3) merely provides that certain sovereign powers are
unimpaired; it does not purport to suspend compliance with co-existent obligation of international
law (including as stated in Articles 4, 6 and 7) regarding the treatment of investors nor does it
override other obligations of international law. Accordingly, even if the annulment of the contract
was authorized by Article 11(3),” the Claimants submit that their right of—and India’s
corresponding obligation to provide—compensation as a result of measures supposedly

authorized by Article 11(3) “remains fully operative.”*””

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent, however, argues that there could be no basis for compensation if the “essential
security interests” provision of Article 11(3) is found to apply in this case. To support its
argument, the Respondent refers to the Continental Casualty case*”* and the CMS annulment
committee decision,” which in effect conclude that there is no possibility of compensation when

the “essential security interests” provisions are invoked.*°

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal has no doubt that, if a State properly invokes a national security exception under an
investment treaty, it cannot be liable for compensation of damages going forward. This is made
clear in the CMS annulment committee decision when it opines in relation to the Article of the
relevant treaty relating to state of necessity: “Article XI [NB: the security interests clause under
the Argentina-United States BIT], if and for so long as it applied, excluded the operation of the
substantive provisions of the BIT. That being so, there could be no possibility of compensation
being payable during that period.”**! It added: “Article XJ is a threshold requirement: if it applies,
the substantive obligations under the Treaty do not apply.”** Similarly, the Continental v.
Argentina award noted that “if Art. XI is applicable because the measure at issue was necessary
in order to safeguard essential security interest, then the treaty is inapplicable to such measure.”**?
It has to be noted that, in the CMS case, Argentina argued that the economic measures adopted by
Argentina were to be of a temporary nature and, as such, did not imply a permanent expropriation.
However, the fact that in the present case the expropriation was of a permanent nature does not

justify a different conclusion.

However, this does not resolve the question as to what happens if a State has engaged in treaty
breaches during the period preceding the invocation of national security. In such a case, a State
could not, by invoking national security at a certain moment, simply erase the effect of previous

wrongful actions.

It will therefore be for the Tribunal to decide whether, even if national security interests were
properly invoked by the Respondent, the Respondent breached provisions of the Treaty during
the period previous to the invocation of Article 11(3) and, if so, whether damages resulted from

such action.

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE FACTS

The Parties fundamentally disagree as to whether there was a real need on the part of the military
and security agencies of India to reserve S-band capacity, such that the intended uses could not

be reconciled with the terms of the Devas Agreement.

L The Parties’ Arguments
a. Historical Analysis of Demands for S-band Spectrum in India
i. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants first note that at all times prior to Dr. Radhakrishnan’s announcement of the
annulment of the Devas Agreement on February 8, 2011 they remained unaware of any claim that

any governmental user had a need for the S-band spectrum that had been allotted to Devas.***

According to the Claimants, it was partly because DOS/ISRO was not making effective use of the
allocated S-band spectrum that India caused DOS to give back 40 MHz of S-MSS spectrum to
DOT.** The Claimants contend that in 2003, when Mr. Viswanathan first met Dr. Kasturirangan,
the then Chairman of the Space Commission, Secretary of DOS and Chairman of ISRO and
Antrix, Dr. Kasturirangan, indicated that DOS/ISRO was looking to explore ways of making
commercial use of its allocated S-band spectrum in order to ensure that it retained that

spectrum. **°

In the Claimants’ view, India conveniently ignores that by 2008 terrestrial cellular operators had
their eyes firmly fixed on the S-band, and were seeking to have DOS vacate the S-band spectrum
that had been allocated to it for space services.**’ These claims were reviewed by the TRAI, which
recommended that “DOT/WPC should coordinate with [DOS] and ascertain the feasibility of

vacation of additional spectrum” in the S-band.*** Nonetheless, India’s policy in this regard

Id., para. 23, Viswanathan I, paras 36-39. The Claimants also rely on a note from DOS to the Space
Commission, which reads: “ISRO initiated serious discussions in early 2003 for introduction of Satellite-
based Digital Multimedia in the country, especially taking note of the fact that the allocation of the S-Band
spectrum for ISRO/DOS [...]. would expire by September 2010 unless [DOS/ISRO] placeS-Band Satellites
in the orbit and demonstrate that necessary advance actions to build the Satellites have been taken.” Note

2008, the Cellular Operators Association of India (the “COAI”) has requested DOT that India’s National
Frequency Allocation Plan (“NFAP”) be revised to reorient the S-band for purely terrestrial cellular
operations; See COAI’s Proposal for Review of Draft NFAP 2008, March 10, 2008, pp. 4-5 (Ex. C-43/JCB-

remained unchanged, and there was no suggestion that the performance of the Devas Agreement

might be interrupted because of alleged competing demands for S-band capacity.**°

Notwithstanding the fact that Devas was never informed of competing demands from the Ministry
of Defence, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s claims that India’s military needs for all
available S-band capacity started to emerge in 2003*” and had crystallized by December 2009.
According to the Claimants, the only evidence of early “competing demands” is that
DOS/ISRO/Antrix willingly pursued an agreement with Devas with full knowledge of these
competing “demands”, and that Antrix represented to Devas that it could provide 70 MHz of S-

band through the satellites on a “Non-Preemptible” basis.*”!

According to the Claimants, if the military had genuine demands for the S-band allocated to Devas
under the Devas Agreement, then this fact would prominently feature in key documents produced
during the review of the Devas Agreement by several Indian governmental agencies and

officials.”

Instead, Dr. Radhakrishnan’s Note for the CCS does not mention any “crystallized”
military needs,*”* and the policy decision of the CCS merely notes that Antrix was not going to
use an orbital slot for commercial purposes. Moreover, it makes no decision regarding
spectrum.*” In any event, the Claimants contend that the CCS did not have the power to reserve
S-band spectrum for the “crystallized needs” of the military, which would have had to be taken

up at the ICC.**

In the Claimants’ view, the formulations used in these documents to refer to these “national

needs” are intentionally non-exhaustive and indeterminate, and are drafted in order for the

Government of India to “back and fill” whatever post-hoc justification might suit its convenience

in subsequent litigation that surely would follow.*°°

The true motivation behind the cancelation of the Devas Agreement, in the Claimants’ view, was
the prospect of a government scandal, which could end up lying at the feet of the Prime Minister

(and Minister of Space) himself, and not any “crystallized needs” of the military.*””

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent contends that, even prior to the conclusion of the Devas Agreement, the need for
S-band had already been the subject of discussion within the agencies charged with national

security and defence.*°* The Respondent recounts a lengthy record of facts to support this

9

contention,*”” spanning from 2003 to 2011. What emerges from this record, the Respondent

submits, is that the needs and demands arising from military and defence purposes were

Ministry of Defence,*”? and warranted the creation of expert committees of military leaders,”

and a taskforce at the ISRO“ to address these issues.

The Respondent avers that, as a consequence of a detailed review of capacity requirements for
strategic purposes, it became clear that the national security requirements far exceeded India’s S-
band capacity, assuming that the orbital slot and frequency allocations necessary for the Devas

Agreement were to be granted to Devas.“

It was this fact that motivated the policy decision to
reserve the S-band for strategic use, and not a bad faith conspiracy, as argued by the Claimants.*°°
In any event, the Respondent notes, referring to a meeting that took place in 2014, that “the
reservation of S-band capacity for strategic purposes was made in 2011 and continues in effect
today, with the satellites being configured for strategic use and the defence agencies picking up

the tab.""407

b. | MSS Demands Versus BSS Demands
i. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants assert that India’s defence suffers a fatal lacuna: the military’s stated desires all
involved MSS frequency, whereas the Devas Agreement pertained to the use of the BSS

spectrum.*°* In the Claimants’ view, this fact disproves the Respondent’s contention that there

satellite for the Navy that was ordered in 2004 and launched in August 2013, a number of additional military
and paramilitary needs had been identified, including 17.5 MHz for immediate requirements of the armed
forces, another 40 MHz during the five year period from 2012 to 2017, another 50 MHz during the
subsequent five year period (2017-2022) and requirements for security agencies and India Railways. See

were genuine military or strategic needs for the portion of the S-band spectrum that had been

allocated to Devas.

To support this contention, the Claimants rely on a “Note for the Empowered Group of Ministers
(“EGoM”)*” on Vacation of Spectrum,” authored by DOT and dated March 1, 2012 (the “Note
for the EGoM”).*"° This note and its annexures were all issued more than a year after the Devas

Agreement was annulled.

First, the Note for the EGoM clarifies that the “strategic and government” need of S-band
spectrum is for MSS, and that DOS was seeking to convert the existing BSS spectrum (including
the 60 MHz of BSS spectrum allocated to Devas) to MSS.*"' In the Claimants’ view, this
demonstrates that there was no existing military need for BSS spectrum.*!? The Claimants also
note that the EGoM and DOT were aware that this conversion would contravene the ITU’s

regulations.*!?

Secondly, the Note for the EGoM and Annexure 10 thereto, as well as a letter dated February 21,
2012 from Mr. Chandrashekhar to Dr. Radhakrishnan,*" state that DOS was requested to vacate
part of the 80 MHz of S-BSS spectrum assigned to it if DOS had no plan for BSS applications in
this band. The Claimants argue that such a recommendation would not have been made to the
EGoM, of which the Minister of Defence is a member, if the crystallized military plans for BSS
existed. A similar remark is made with regard to the minutes of the EGoM meeting held on March
5, 2012, which reflect that DOS was asked to apprise the EGoM as to its plans for using BSS

spectrum.‘!5

In the Claimants’ view, the documents above disprove Mr. Anand’s unsupported statement that

the military demanded BSS spectrum “due to the limitations of the MSS.”4'°

According to the Claimants, an EGoM is “virtually a mini cabinet” that may decide on issues normally
reserved to the Indian Union Cabinet. See Transcript, Day 1, 86:15-87:8.

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent emphasizes the intensifying discussions within the Government of India over the
use of the S-band as the military learned of the limitations of MSS frequency for their data
communication.*!” These limitations arose from the fact that two-way communications such as
MSS cannot support sending large amounts of data to multiple users simultaneously, as opposed

to satellite broadcasting, which is the case of BSS.*"8

The Respondent characterizes the Claimants’ argument that the Note for the EGoM disproves the
existence of genuine military needs for the S-band‘! as a “quantum leap” that suffers a twofold

deficiency:

First, it is undisputed that the CCS reserved the S-band for non-commercial, strategic use, and
such reservation remains in effect.*”° This is true notwithstanding any debates taking place before,
during or after the policy decision of the CCS, which are legitimate and inherent to the democratic
spirit of India.*?! The Note for the EGoM proves nothing as to the continued effectiveness of the

policy decision of the CCS.*”?

Secondly, the Claimants overlook a number of documents produced to them together with the

Note for the EGoM, including:

i. A March 1, 2012 letter from Dr. Radhakrishnan, as Secretary of DOS, to the Secretary
of DOT,“ referring to the letter dated February 21, 2012 from Mr. Chandrashekhar to
Dr. Radhakrishnan,‘ which makes clear that the strategic, non-commercial needs for
S-band continued to exist and that, in light of those needs, it would not be possible to

vacate S-band spectrum for commercial BWA purposes;*”° and

2 The Tribunal’s Analysis

The Tribunal will first consider whether there was a genuine need on the part of the military and
security agencies of India to reserve S-band capacity. The Respondent contends that that is the
case. The Claimants, on the other hand, question that the S-band demands expressed by the Indian
military between 2003 and 2009 were genuine. They insist that all the references to “national
needs” featuring in the documents produced during the review of the Devas Agreement are
intentionally non-exhaustive and indeterminate, and were merely used as a pretext by India to
concoct a force majeure event that would enable Antrix to terminate said Agreement on

advantageous terms.

The Tribunal did not have the benefit of testimonies from senior officials who were directly
involved in the process leading to the CCS decision of February 17, 2011, such as Dr. K.
Radhakrishnan who, since late 2009, was Chairman of the Space Commission, Chairman of
ISRO, Secretary of DOS and, until July 2011, Chairman of Antrix, or Mr. G. Balachandran,
Additional Secretary of DOS from April 1, 2009 to January 11, 2011, or Mrs. Geeta Varadhan,
Director of Special Projects at DOS, who appears to have had long exposure to the needs of the
military concerning the S-band and who, according to Mr. Anand, was the person who, at a
meeting of senior officials of DOS in June 2010, raised the issue of the needs of the military over
the S-band.*?* Nor was the Tribunal provided with any testimony from any member of the

Department of Defence.

Messrs. Sethuraman and Anand were cooperative and helpful witnesses but a large part of their
testimony consisted in presenting their interpretation of many documents in the preparation of

which they had no participation whatsoever.

As far as the Claimants are concerned, they produced a number of witnesses and experts who
provided considerable information concerning the negotiation and the implementation of the
Agreement as well as expertise on the allocation and management of spectrum. However, in spite
of over a dozen meetings with government officials between June 2010 and the end of January
2011, none of the Claimants was informed of the internal government process which led to the
CCS decision of February 17, 2011, until Dr. Radhakdrishnan’s press conference of February 8,
2011 at which he announced for the first time the Space Commission’ s decision of 2 July 2010 to
annul the Agreement. They therefore were in no position to shed light on the deliberations of

governmental authorities during the most relevant period.

The Tribunal finds itself having to rely very much on the documents submitted by the Parties in
reaching its own conclusion as to the Respondent’s decision to annul the Agreement and reserve

the GSAT-6 and 6A satellites “having regard to the needs of [India’s] strategic requirements.”*”?

The Tribunal has summarized above the events surrounding the decision to annul the Agreement.
The Tribunal is faced with the difficult task of assessing whether that decision was based on
genuine security needs of the State or whether these alleged needs were a mere pretext to annul a
contract which was becoming a political embarrassment and to meet the wishes expressed by

other groups in the communications industry providing terrestrial services.

The Tribunal is left with no doubt that, inside the Indian administration, during the discussions
leading to the request to the CCS for the annulment of the Devas Agreement, a mix of factors was

at play.

First and foremost, the fear of a political scandal similar to the previous one relating to the
attribution of G2 licenses and arising out of the publication of some articles on the subject in
Indian media is a likely explanation of the sudden frenzy in June 2010 of the DOS, and of Dr.
Radhakrishnan in particular, in agitating for and obtaining from the Space Commission in less

than a month the decision to annul the Devas Agreement.

All this occurred in a context where at no time between the signing of the Agreement in 2006 and
the decision to annul it in 2011, and in spite of alleged repeated requests since 2006 by the military
for the allocation to it of at least part of the S-band, did the Respondent give any indication to the

Claimants that the Agreement might be in jeopardy because of such needs.

After the publication of press articles on May 31 and June 1, 2010**° suggesting that there might

 

have been some inappropriate dealings in cc ion with the A DOT, by letter of June
4, 2010%! requested the Additional Secretary of ISRO “to provide your comments [...]
immediately;” this was followed by another letter of June 14, 2010** to the same effect addressed
to Dr. Rhadakrishnan. These letters initiated a flurry of actions by ISRO aimed at annulling the

Agreement.

On the same date, Dr. Rhadakrishnan requested from Antrix six copies of the Agreement which
were immediately provided.** On June 16, 2010 in a letter to DOT, after pointing out that two
issues were confronting the Respondent, he sought DOT’s “opinion on whether ANTRIX-Devas
contract need be annulled invoking any of the provisions of the contract in order (i) to preserve
the precious S band for the strategic requirements of the nation and (ii) to ensure a level playing
field for the other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.”4** On the same date,
Dr. Rhadakhrisnan wrote to the Advisor to the Law Minister, raising the same two issues and
seeking a legal opinion “on whether ANTRIX-Devas contract need be annulled invoking any of
the provisions of the contract [...].’”**5 He also flew from Bangalore to New Delhi to discuss the

matter with the Advisor. Two days later, on June 18, 2010 the Advisor produced a note**®

stating
that “the Central Government (Department of Space), in exercise of its sovereign power and
function, if so desire and feel appropriate, may take a policy decision to the effect that due to the
needs of strategic requirements, the Central Govt/ISRO would not be able to provide orbit slot in

S-band for operating PS1 to the ANTRIX for commercial activities. In that event, ANTRIX in

terms of Article 7(c) read with Article 11, of the agreement may terminate the agreement and
inform M/s Devas accordingly.”**” He added: “As far as the second issue relating to terrestrial
supplementation and level playing field since the Department of Telecom is administratively
concerned that Department may also be consulted.’4*

Following the submission of an extensive note by DOS to the Space Commission, that
Commission decided, among other things, at its meeting of 2 July 2010, that the Department of
Space “in view of priority to be given to nation’s strategic requirements including societal ones
may take the actions necessary and instruct Antrix to annul the ANTRIX-Devas contract” and
“may evolve a revised utilization plan for GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A satellites, taking into account
the strategic and societal imperatives of the country.”4?

Subsequent to that decision and following a request from DOS, the Additional Solicitor General
stated in a letter of 12 July 2010 that his opinion had been sought as to whether the Agreement
“can be annulled by invoking any provisions of the contract in order to (i) preserve precious S
band spectrum for strategic requirements of the nation and (ii) to ensure a level playing field for
other service providers using terrestrial spectrum.” He advised that, instead of a mere decision
by the Department of Space, “it would be more prudent that a decision is taken by the Government
of India, as a matter of policy, in exercise of its executive power or in other words, a policy
decision having the seal and approval of the Cabinet and duly gazetted as per the Business Rules

of the Government of India.”"““!

Finally, in its Note for the Cabinet Committee on Security of February 16, 2011, DOS, after

odd

describing the need of “S-band spectrum for vital and societal applications,”*** again refers to its

concerns about ensuring “a level-playing field for the other service providers using terrestrial

spectrum.”“43

329. This, by itself, however cannot be a basis for the Tribunal to conclude that the decision of the

Respondent to annul the Agreement was invalid.

330. First, it is a regular phenomenon in public administration that decisions are influenced by a

number of factors including, sometimes, purely political ones.

331. Second, and more important, while records of deliberations at senior levels of the Respondent’ s
public administration might be helpful to understand the context in which a particular decision
was reached, what should guide the Tribunal is the actual decision taken by the highest authority
of the Government, i.e. its Cabinet, which had delegated to the Cabinet Committee on Security
decisions concerning that subject, a Committee which was presided by the Prime Minister

himself, who was also the Minister responsible for the DOS.

332. The decision of the CCS concerning the Devas Agreement was communicated in the form of a

press release of February 17, 2011 which reads:

Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) has decided to annul the Antrix-Devas Deal.
Following is the statement made by the Law Minister, Shri M. Veerappa Moily on the
decision taken by the CCS which met in New Delhi today:

Taking note of the fact that the Government policies with regard to the allocation of spectrum
has undergone a change in the last few years and there has been an increased demand for
allocation of spectrum for national needs, including the needs of defence, para-military forces
and other public utility services as well as for societal needs, and having regard to the needs
of the country’s strategic requirements, the Government will not be able to provide orbit slot
in S band to Antrix for commercial activities, including for those which are the subject matter
of existing contractual obligations for S band.

In the light of this policy of not providing orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial
activities, the “Agreement for the lease of space segment capacity on ISRO/Antrix S-Band
spacecraft by the Devas Multimedia Pvt. Ltd” entered into between Antrix Corporation and
Devas Multimedia Pavt. Ltd. on 28" January, 2005 shall be annulled forthwith.

333. In fact, the decision of the CCS as reported in the statement of the Law Minister replicates word

for word the approval sought by the DOS in its Note to the CCS of February 16, 2011.**

Nothing in that decision implies that it was reached in whole or in part to accommodate the
concerns expressed by other service providers using terrestrial spectrum or to deal with the risk

of a political scandal in connection with the Antrix-Devas Agreement.“

Moreover, the fact that the CCS did not make a specific allocation of the spectrum cannot be
considered as a deciding element in considering whether the CCS decision was taken for the
protection of the Respondent’s essential security interests. As the Claimants themselves have
argued, such function came under the authority of the ICC. This fact does not restrict the power
of the CCS to decide that any particular activity be “directed to the protection of (the) essential
security interests” of the State. In the present case, if such a decision was taken, there was nothing
inappropriate in leaving it to the proper administrative authorities to decide how the spectrum

would be allocated between the various interested parties.

The Tribunal has received uncontroverted evidence that, starting as early as 2004, officials in the

Ministry of Defence were concerned about the needs of the Indian military for S-band capacity.

On April 5, 2004, the Naval Headquarters wrote to ISRO regarding the requirement of the Navy

for a dedicated satellite. In this communication it was stated as follows:

The importance of reliable, secure, real time and uninterrupted tactical as well as strategic
communications, in the Navy can never be over emphasised. Ship shore communications
serve command and control functions, need to be global in nature and are therefore termed
strategic communications.**”

The importance of space capabilities for the Defence forces was brought out in a note of the Vice
Admiral, Headquarters Integrated Defence Staff dated October 14, 2005. The relevant extract of

the note reads:

1. Space Systems are beginning to become an integral component of the total combat
potential of many nations. It is but imperative that our Defence Forces do not lack in
the exploitation of Space for War fighting. Till 2008 Indian Space capability and
programmes have been defined and there is no alternative but to exploit available
assets except for minor up gradations where feasible, during this time frame.

In a note of April 12, 2011 to the Prime Minister (Ex.R-44/JCB-229, para.36) concerning the Report of
March 11, 2011 by the High Powered Review Committee which was appointed after the CCS decision to
study various aspects of the Agreement (Ex.C-137/JCB 227), Mr.Chandrashekhar, the Cabinet Secretary,
writes as one of his conclusions that “seem to emerge from the analysis of the HPRC report and other
evidences” is that “[...] since the agreement has now had to be cancelled on account of reasons related to
non-transparency and one-sided skew in risk sharing arrangements, ISRO/DOS are left with a satellite [...]
which has no immediate commercial application.”. However, there is no indication in the HPRC Report
that such concerns were a factor in the CCS decision; such concerns do not appear either in the reasons
invoked by the CCS in support of its February 17, 2011 decision.

However, beyond that period our Defence Forces should be able to examine and
specify the needs to enable our technologists to support our requirements. Space
capabilities are vital tools of the Information Revolution and critical to activities of
the Defence Forces. Space is emerging as a centre of gravity for information
dependent forces and it is highly probable that continued and assured access to Space
will be a major determinant of national power [...].

2. Lack of Policy with respect to exploitation of Space Systems, which are now a
universally accepted phenomenon, by the Armed Forces, could lead to a void in Space
related research and the Defence Forces, could miss the opportunity for early
involvement and influence over Space Programmes. This has possibly occurred till
2008 as a fait accompli and we must plan our strategy for space asset accruels beyond
2008. This document would prima facie address our broad technology requirements
based on mission statements of our Defence Forces.

4. Defence Space Vision 2020 is intended to be futuristic in content and would be the
Base Document for formulating the Space Strategy and Space Doctrine for the Armed

2005.
Para. 2 of the aforementioned note talks about planning strategy for space. Para. 4 refers to the
Defence Space Vision, 2020, intended for formulating the space strategy. An appendix to the

document, inter-alia, reflects the requirement of S-band for strategic use:

 

 

 

2010 86 MWZ
2015 151 MWZ
2020 208 MWZ

 

 

 

 

The minutes of the third task force meeting between various representatives of the Army, Air
Force, Navy and Department of Space held on February 21, 2006 recorded a concern about the
rapid build-up of the Chinese Space Programme and need to take cognisance of this aspect and
develop a space programme to effectively combat the proliferation. The minutes also point out
the inescapable necessity of S-band for the armed forces for interference free communications.

The required projection of S-band required for armed forces was mentioned as under:

86MHZ-151 MHZ-208 MHZ for short, medium and long term respectively.”

bandwidth in the S-band and in some other bands specified therein for satellite communications

of the three services as per requirements envisaged in DSV 220.4

The minutes of the integrated space cell meeting held on February 19, 2007 projected the
requirement of S-band based on the number of satellite projects already operational and planned
in the future. From the bandwidth projections worked out, it was expressed that the present series
“INSAT” and “GSAT” cannot meet the army’s futuristic requirement of bandwidth and it was

proposed to have a Dedicated Army Communication Satellite.**!

On August 30, 2007, the Chiefs of Staff Committee directed that an Expert Committee be formed
by HQ Integrated Defence Staff, which was to be guided by the following terms of reference:

a. Spectrum uses by various services in Band 2.5GHz and 2.69 GHZ.
b. Present and planned satellite uses by the services on satellite bands by DoS.

c. Defence services support to DoS or otherwise at various national and international
forums for protection of band 2.5GHz and 2.69GHz in favour of DoS without laying
under constitution to satellite services.”**?
While directing that the Expert Committee be formed, it was recorded that the Defence Services
had present and future applications in the band from 2.5 GHz to 2.69 GHz on various satellites
launched by the DOS and representatives of the DOS were actively involved in the protection of

said bands at various national and international forums.

Pursuant to the direction of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the Expert Committee on Spectrum
and Satellite Uses of Frequency Band 2.5 to 2.69 GHz (S-band) was constituted. The following

observations of the Expert Committee dated September 7, 2007 need to be noticed:

11. If this spectrum (2.5-2.69 GHz) is lost to commercial operators, it would severely
jeopardize the future Defence services plans, of providing mobile SATCOM
connectivity.

12. In view of the above, it is strongly recommended that the ‘S’ band Spectrum be
safeguarded from being poached by the commercial operators for meeting the future
requirements of the Defence Services. Proposal from the IAF for a dedicated satellite
to utilize the ‘S’ Band spectrum, which is under finalization, would also strengthen

the case for retention of spectrum. The non availability of the Spectrum could stymie
the future operational plans of the Defence services.**

On November 19, 2008 a special meeting was held, which was attended by representatives of the
Army, Air Force, Navy and ISRO to address satellite-based communication issues. A
representative of ISRO proposed that the HQ Integrated Defence Staff need to consolidate the
requirement of S-band for various services to enable an optimal utilisation by way of the dedicated

S-band-specific satellite.

On December 15, 2009 at a meeting in ISAC, Bangalore, between ISC, HQ Integrated Defence
Staff, Ministry of Defence and ISRO, the military presented details concerning the national
security requirements for satellite services. At this meeting, the armed forces set forth their
requirements for S-band as follows: “(i) to cater for requirements up to 2012—120 Carriers, 17.5
MHz. out which 50 Carriers are being used by the armed forces;(ii) Additional in 12" Plan—40
MHz.; (iii) Additional in 13" Plan—S0 MHz.”**5

Joint Communications Electronic Staff of HQ Integrated Defence Staff, by its letter dated April
23, 2010** informed ISRO of the bandwidth requirements of the Army, Navy and Airforce. As
per the Appendix attached to the letter, the requirement of the three wings of the armed forces for

S-band were specified:

The note of the Additional Secretary, Department of Space dated June 30, 2010 referred to the
meeting between the Integrated Space Cell and ISRO. The note not only projected the need for

S-band by the armed forces but it also referred to the demands of other security agencies such as

the BSF, CISF, CRPF and the police for S-band transponders. The requirement for S-band was

also projected by the railways for tracking of trains.”

The Tribunal has also received evidence that, subsequently to the CCS decision of February 2011,
significant changes have been made to GSAT-6 to accommodate the specific needs of the armed
forces** and that the Defence Research and Development Organization was made responsible for

the ground segment development of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A.*°

But this is not the end of the matter. While the events related above provide helpful information
concerning the administrative process followed both before and after the CCS decision, what is
the determinant factor for the Tribunal is that decision itself and whether it was directed to the

protection of the Respondents essential security interests.

The Tribunal does not question the right of the Respondent to terminate the Agreement and to
decide that the S-band would be reserved in the future for non-commercial activities. Two avenues
were opened to it; one under Article 6 of the Treaty whereby the Respondent could expropriate
for public purposes the rights of the Claimant under the conditions enunciated in that Article and
the other one under Article 11(3) when, among other things, the Respondent’s decision was
“directed to the protection of the essential security interests” of the State. Each of these avenues

however leads to very different conclusions in terms of liability and compensation.

Article 11(3) constitutes an important exception to the provisions of the Treaty and, while proper
deference must be given to State authority in defining what its essential security interests are, it

must be interpreted in accordance with the provisions of the VCLT.

The problem in the present case is that the decision of the CCS itself contains a mix of objectives.
Even though there is nowhere in the CCS decision any specific reference to the Respondent’s
“essential security interests,” the Tribunal, by majority, has no difficulty concluding that the
reservation of spectrum for the needs of defence and para-military forces can be classified as
“directed to the protection of its essential security interests”, coming under the exclusion covered
in Article 11(3) of the Treaty; however, the same cannot be said when it comes to taking over the

spectrum allocated to the Claimants for “railways and other public utility services as well as for

societal needs, and having regard to the needs of the country’s strategic requirements,“ as stated

in the CCS decision.

While it could quite properly expropriate the Claimants’ rights under Article 6 of the Treaty for
“public utility services as well as for societal needs,” it could not have recourse to Article 11(3)

for such purposes and confiscate their rights.

Even the reference to “the country’s strategic requirements,” unless made specific, such as for the
military and para-military needs, would not be restricted to the meaning of the provisions of
Article 11(3). That Article does not refer to strategic needs but to essential security interests and
the expression “strategic requirements” can cover a whole range of government activities;
governments all over the world pursue a number of different policies which they describe as
strategies essential to the attainment of public interest objectives (economic strategies, public
health strategies, energy strategies, etc.) and the situation does not appear to be different in the
case of the Respondent. That expression can be found not only in the CCS decision of February
17, 2011, but also in a number of documents produced by the Respondent, such as the Space
Commission Note to the CCS of February 16, 2011 and in the Suresh Committee Report and there
is no indication in the evidence received by the Tribunal, except the say-so of Messrs. Sethuraman
and Anand, that this expression should be interpreted exclusively for “the protection of essential

security interests.”

Messrs. Sethuraman and Anand, in their oral testimony,*°! argued that, in India, “strategic” means
the armed forces. However, their interpretation appears to be contradicted by the words of the
Space Commission itself which, in its direction of July 2, 2010, read: “Department, in view of
priority to be given to nation’s strategic requirements including societal ones may take action
necessary and instruct ANTRIX to annul the ANTRIX-DEVAS contract.” Similarly, in its Note
to the CCS of February 16, 2011, the Space Commission stated that the purpose of the Note was
“to seek approval of the Cabinet Committee on Security for Annulling” the Devas Agreement,
“in view of priority to be given to nation’s strategic requirements including societal ones.”*? The
same document, in the Approval Sought from the Cabinet Committee on Security, states that due
to an “increased demand for allocation of spectrum for national needs, including for the needs of

defence, para-military forces, railways and other public utility services as well as for societal

needs, and having regard to the needs of the country’s strategic requirements, the Government

will not be able to provide orbit slot in S band to Antrix for commercial activities (...).’4°

It is therefore clear to the Tribunal that the expressions “strategic needs” or “strategic
requirements” covered a range of activities which went far beyond the military or paramilitary

sectors or the “essential security interests” of the Respondent.

As to the reference to railways mentioned in the DOS Note to the CCS, the Tribunal was told that
it had to do with train tracking (train safety and signaling).** The Tribunal does not see how such

function could come within the ambit of essential security interests.

As to “societal needs,” the Respondent itself has recognized that these words cover a wide range
of government activities which clearly have no relationship with the essential security interests of
the State. When asked by the Claimants to describe the meaning of these words, Mr. Anand,
appearing on behalf of the Government of India, stated: “I told you that societal requirements is
a pretty wide spectrum. It covers the whole gamut of services which goes under societal tele
education, tel dicine, crop i disaster rural cc ications—there is
a huge gamut of activity which goes on the societal applications”.“*° The DOS Note to the Space
Commission also refers to “other national societal requirements for emergency communication,
dissemination of disaster warnings, tele-education, tele-health and rural communication.“

In the view of the Tribunal, the inclusion of “other public utility services and for societal needs”

covers a lot more than the “essential security interests” mentioned in Article 11(3) of the Treaty.

It is important to note that the CCS, in its February 17, 2011 decision, did not proceed to any
allocation of the spectrum but referred the matter to the ICC, a dormant institution which was
revived for the purpose. The Tribunal was informed that, by the time of the hearing, that no
decision had been taken by the ICC.*”’ The Tribunal received no information that a decision was

taken in that regard even subsequently to the hearing.

It is striking in this respect that the uncertainty in that respect has continued right up to the time

of the launch of GSAT-6 on August 27, 2015.

In a note of March 28, 2014,to the Space Commission for its 128" meeting of April 12, 2014,
Mr. Prahlad Rao, Director SCNP, mentions that, following discussions by the Department of
Space “with the user agencies to arrive at a revised utilization plan for GSAT-6/6a,” it was now
proposed to utilize the space segment capacity of GSAT-6 and GSAT-6A spacecrafts for meeting
the communication needs (Broadcast and Mobile Applications) of strategic sector including
Defence, Paramilitary forces and societal sector including Disaster Management Support and
Indian Railways.”**

At the meeting of the Space Commission on April 12, 2014, the Chairman “stated that there is an
issue of spectrum (BSS) for GSAT-6/6A[.] DOT wants ISRO to vacate the spectrum and auction
it. The subject matter was discussed in EGoM and ISRO was asked to provide S-BSS usage to
por."

Subsequently, in a letter to the Tribunal on August 31, 2015, the Respondent submitted a group
of documents in connection with the launch of GSAT-6, the submission of which the Tribunal
conditionally accepted. Although there are occasional references to the launch of a military
satellite in the headlines or the core of some newspaper articles, none of these assertions are based
on any reported statement by a public official and the Tribunal cannot consider such references
as reliable evidence; in fact, the submitted documents tend to demonstrate that the GSAT-6

satellite continues to be planned for a multiplicity of purposes.

Thus, the Chairman of ISRO, Mr. Kiran is quoted as saying that “(t)he users for this will be the
strategic sector as it gives a tremendous opportunity for using very small handheld devices in the
remotest places.”*” The same person is reported by the Times of India to have said on the same

day that the satellite would be used for various government purposes.*’! The Respondent, who

produced these press articles, gave no indication to the effect that the statements attributed to the

Chairman of ISRO were not accurate.

Even more significant is Annex 6 of the documents submitted by the Respondent on August 31,
2015.4” The note from Mr. V.K. Pant, Assistant Wireless Adviser, in DOT, states that “(b)ased
on the decisions of the Cabinet a document on Defence Band and Defence Interest Zone has been
issued to Ministry of Defence on 12" March 2015. The relevant extract relating to the S band is
enclosed, as desired.” That extract reads as follows: “The band segments (a) 2500-2635 MHz
(35MHz) (b) 2555-2535 MHz (80 MHz) and (c) 2655-2690 MHz (35 MHz) will be used for
Defence, security and societal applications.” It therefore appears that, right up to the time of the
launch of the satellite, GSAT-6 was destined to a mixed application, some of it coming under
wording of Article 11 (3) and some of it being clearly for the pursuit of a public purpose under

Article 6 of the Treaty.

The Respondent has submitted evidence showing substantial requirements by the Department of
Defence for S-band spectrum (17.5 MHz up to 2012, an additional 40 MHz up to 2017 and SOMHz
up to 2022).4? The evidence submitted to the Tribunal demonstrates that these requests covered
both the MSS and the BSS parts of the spectrum. As to the Claimants’ argument that, in
reallocating a BSS part of the spectrum to MSS spectrum, the Respondent would have
contravened the ITU’s Radio Regulations*, Mr. John Lewis, an expert retained by the Claimants,
has clearly answered in his oral testimony that, once a particular international frequency table has
been allocated to a country by the ITU, the decision as to the re-allocation between BSS and MSS
applications is a matter of “national decision, and the ITU has no role to monitor or overview
decisions of this nature.”*”° In addition, Mr. Sethuraman testified that the two satellites 6 and 6A.
would not be sufficient to meet the requirements of the military.*7 However, if the Respondent
was willing to approve the large allocation requests of the armed forces, it would have simply
done so by reserving the S-band to meet its essential security needs. The Tribunal has received
no evidence of any specific assignment of spectrum to the military and paramilitary sectors and,

as indicated above, there were even debates inside the administration in 2014 as to the possible

Memo from V.K. Pant, Department of Telecommunications, to Member (Finance), Department of Space,
April 1, 2015 (Annex 6 submitted by the Respondent on August 31, 2015).

auctioning of some part of the S-band spectrum to the private sector, notwithstanding the CCS

decision of 2011 to exclude commercial activities from that spectrum.

Although the requests of the military for part of the S-band spectrum are large, the Tribunal notes
that no specific allocation has been made by the Respondent, and the Tribunal cannot assume that
such requests will be approved in full by the Respondent. All around the world, governments are
faced every year with very large demands for funds for various projects from their military

establishment and, just as regularly, governments grant only a percentage of such requests.

The Tribunal, by majority, therefore concludes that, although the CCS decision of 2011 appears
to have been in part “directed to the protection of its essential security interests,” that part
remained undefined and several other objectives were included in that decision, which had
nothing to do with national security. In the circumstances, the Tribunal rules that, although the
Respondent was fully entitled to reassign the S-spectrum to non-commercial use, the part which
was not reserved for military or paramilitary purposes would be subject to the provisions of

Article 6 of the Treaty concerning expropriation.

Moreover, in the present case, the request by the armed forces for the attribution of spectrum is
spread over a number of years (up to 2022) and, looking at the past performance of the space
program, it is extremely doubtful that the envisaged schedule could be realistic. In fact, the
requirement of 17.5 MHZ up to 2012 had not even been allocated by the time of the launch of
GSAT-6 in 2015.

On the basis of the evidence submitted to it as described above and bearing in mind that the
Respondent had already reserved to itself 10% of the spectrum in question,*” the Tribunal, by
majority, is of the view that a reasonable allocation of spectrum directed to the protection of the
Respondent's essential security interests would not exceed 60% of the S-band spectrum allocated
to the Claimants, the remaining 40% being allocated for other public interest purposes and being
subject to the expropriation conditions under Article 6 of the Treaty. It will be up to the Tribunal,
in the next phase of this arbitral process (damages), to establish the compensation due to the

Claimants in that respect.

This is independent of any liability Antrix may have incurred for contractual breach of the Devas

Agreement.

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

The Claimants contend that, as a result of the measures of India’s various governmental agencies

leading to the annulment of the Devas Agreement, the Respondent has unlawfully expropriated

their investments in India in violation of Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty.*”*

The Respondent’s primary contention is that no identifiable right or asset of the Claimants was

expropriated,” but in any event, rejects the Claimants’ analysis of this claim.**°

Article 6 of the Treaty provides as follows:

(1) Investments of investors of either Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or subjected to measures
having effects equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation except for public
purposes under due process of law, on a non-discriminatory basis and against fair and
equitable compensation. Such compensation shall amount to the market value of the
investment expropriated immediately before the expropriation or before the
impending expropriation became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier, shall
include interest at a fair and equitable rate until the date of payment, shall be made
without unreasonable delay and shall be effectively realizable and be freely
transferable.

(2) _ The investor affected by the expropriation shall have the right, under the law of the
Contracting Party making the expropriation, to review, by a judicial or other
independent authority of that Party, of his or its case and of the valuation of his or its
investment in accordance with the principles set out in this paragraph.

(3) Where a Contracting Party expropriates, nationalises or takes measures having effect
equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation against the assets of a company which
is incorporated or constituted under the laws in force in any part of its own territory,
and in which investors of the other Contracting Party owns shares, it shall ensure that
the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article are applied to the extent necessary to
ensure fair and equitable compensation as specified therein to such investors of the
other Contracting Party who are owners of those shares.

Article 7, which deals with transfer of investment capital and returns, provides that “(a)Il transfers
shall be effected without reasonable delay in any freely convertible currency at the market rate of

exchange prevailing on the date of transfer.”

L The Existence of an Expropriation
a. The Claimants’ Position

According to the Claimants, whether or not there is an expropriation for the purpose of Articles 6
and 7 of the Treaty turns on whether an investment is “subjected to measures having effects
equivalent to nationalisation or expropriation.”“*' In this context, the Claimants argue that
“expropriation” includes “covert or incidental interference with the use of property which has the
effect of depriving the owner, in whole or in significant part, of the use or economic benefit of
99482

property; and “direct or indirect interference with intangible assets including contract

rights.”483

Accordingly, the Claimants’ assets and rights, such as its interest in Devas, indirect ownership of
the Devas Agreement and indirect ownership of the Devas system and business and pre-emptive
right to an allocation of the S-band under the Devas Agreement were capable of being and, in fact
were, directly and indirectly expropriated and/or nationalized by the Government of India.*** Such
an expropriation, the Claimants submit, is evident from the factual record demonstrating that the
coordinated measures adopted by the CCS, DOS, the Space Commission and ISRO/Antrix during
the review process of the Devas Agreement,*** which led to the annulment of the Devas
Agreement and rights therein, plainly had the deliberate and objective effect of depriving the
Claimants of the use or reasonably-to-be-expected economic benefit of their investments in

Devas."

b. — The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ expropriation claim is fundamentally flawed in that
no identifiable right or asset was expropriated,**’ a point which the Respondent says the Claimants

do not dispute.***

The Respondent criticizes the Claimants’ failure to identify precisely the scope of the rights or
assets at issue, but in any event, argues that the Claimants’ claim is deficient as they seek
compensation for rights that they never had. Notably, the assets and interests identified by the
Claimants as being expropriated are (i) not rights or assets of any kind belonging to the Claimants
themselves; and (ii) entirely dependent on Devas acquiring rights under the Devas Agreement

that could not be affected by governmental action.**”

The Respondent denies that the Claimants’ shareholdings in Devas have been expropriated*”’ and
insofar as Claimants’ investments derive from the Devas Agreement,*”! the Respondent argues
that the only right acquired by Devas was the right to a refund of the upfront capacity reservation

fees paid prior to the date of termination of the agreement.*”

Moreover, the Claimants are not assisted by their survey of expropriation cases, which the

Respondent submits are not applicable as they have no bearing on the issues in this case.*°°

2. Lawfulness of the Expropriation

The Claimants argue that India’s expropriation was unlawful because it does not satisfy the four

494

conditions set out in Article 6 of the Treaty.*”* In fact, they say, none of those conditions are

satisfied, such that India’s expropriation was unlawful in every respect.‘°>

The Respondent, by contrast, maintains its primary argument that the Claimants did not possess
any “acquired rights” such that no expropriation occurred,*”° and, in any case, rejects the

Claimants’ allegation of unlawful expropriation.*””

a. Public Purpose
i. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants contend that the “public purpose” condition within the Treaty**

requires the
Respondent to demonstrate that (i) its measures were actually for public purposes, and not based
on a mere assertion;*”” (ii) the expropriation was proportional to the purported public purpose;*””
and (iii) the expropriatory measures must not be “financially motivated,” either in favor of the
State itself or other investors.*

In the Claimants’ view, the facts of the case dispel any notion of a taking for “public purposes,”*”

especially as the “purpose” admitted by Dr. Radhakrishnan was to terminate the contract “without

causing much of embarrassment and damage and financial loss to the government.”°*’ As a matter

of law, the Claimants do not accept that a desire to escape a commercial arrangement, or avoid

political outcomes, is a “public purpose.”*™*

Furthermore, the Claimants rely on the following to challenge the alleged “public purposes:”

(a) _ the lack of involvement of any agencies that purportedly had “needs” of S-band spectrum

throughout Dr. Radhakrishnan’s process to annul the Devas Agreement;*°>

(b) the state of disuse of the S-band spectrum for any purpose, including for those purported

“needs” of any agencies;*°°

(c) the continuing call for the S-band spectrum to be made available to other commercial

507

operators,*”” which first began in 2008 and were evident at the time of Dr. Radhakrishnan’s

“review” of the Devas Agreement;***

(d) _ the contrast*® between India’s covert and ad hoc “policy” to extricate itself from the Devas

p10

Agreement in 201 and the careful analysis performed by the Shankara Committee prior

to the initial decision to enter into the Devas Agreement in 2004.5"!

Even if a “public purpose” could be ascribed to the expropriation, the Claimants contend that the

Respondent’s actions were not “proportional” to that purpose.*!? In support, the Claimants refer

of Law and Justice, but does not refer to any agencies concerned with “defence, paramilitary forces,
railways or other public utility services,” whose “needs” supposedly animated the policy decision of the
ccs.

expropriatory measure and give it the opportunity to be heard and/or mitigate the impact of the
threatened measures;*!° and (ii) the conduct of the expropriation with “reasonable advance notice

can also be denied substantively, i.e. when a host State ignores and violates its own and/or
international law in the conduct of an expropriation.*”°

According to the Claimants, India’s clandestine conduct leading up to the cancellation of the
Devas Agreement is a classical denial of due process.*! The whole review process of the Devas
522

Agreement and the decision to cancel it’? were made behind closed doors, and were presented

without any prior notice to Devas or Claimants as a fait accompli, with no opportunity to present

 

objections to India’s decisions***—a fact acknowledged by the Respondent.°** All this is
exacerbated by India’s public indications of support for the Devas system and Devas’
performance of the Devas Agreement, in reliance upon those indications of support.*” As the
Kardassopoulos tribunal remarked, “[b]ack-door press reports are the opposite of due process.”*7°
Moreover, the Claimants aver that the decision to fabricate a force majeure event was carried out
in contravention of the contractual requirement that a force majeure event must be “beyond the
reasonable control of the party affected” and have only have occurred “despite all efforts of the

Affected Party to prevent it or mitigate its effects.”°””

ii. The Respondent's Position

The Respondent argues unequivocally that due process does not require consultation with the
Claimants as to national security matters, and the Claimants simply had no vested right to be

consulted on this issue.°**

3. Potential Discrimination in the Expropriation
a. The Claimants’ Position

In the Claimants’ view, discrimination in the expropriation context occurs when an investment is
nationalised “for reasons unrelated to the host State’s legitimate regulatory objectives;” such that
expropriation of a foreign investment solely due to foreign ownership would violate this
condition.*”?

According to the Claimants, the measures in question were discriminatory because they were
aimed exclusively at extinguishing the interests of Devas, and were motivated in part by the fact

that Devas had foreign ownership interests by the Claimants and DT Asia.*?

b. — The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent denies that the Government of India’s policy decision to reserve the S-band for
non-commercial, strategic use was discriminatory in any way, as there was no differentiation in
the treatment accorded to the Claimants as compared to other entities or sectors.**! Regarding the
Claimants’ argument that India’s “attacks” on the Devas Agreement “were motivated in part by
the fact that the Claimants were non Indian,” the Respondent points out that the CCS did not
reserve S-band for commercial use of Indians; it reserved S-band for non-commercial, strategic

use, preventing any private use of S-band by anyone, irrespective of nationality or ownership.***

scientists, seem to have been diluted with the entry of major foreign players. While technically this was
permitted, the entry of foreign telecom companies with huge premiums indicated that they had used this as
an opportunity for entering the telecom market, which had in the meanwhile expanded rapidly in India
during 2005-10. This was not an intended purpose of the original agreement.” See also Statement of Claim,

4. Fair and Equitable Compensation
a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants note that Article 6(1) of the Treaty mandates that “fair and equitable

compensation” “made without unreasonable delay” is a condition of any expropriation.** The
failure to pay “market value” compensation alone constitutes a breach of the Treaty, and is no

different from a complete failure to make any payment.

In this instance, the Claimants emphasize that the Respondent has not even attempted to pay the

Claimants the fair market value of their lost investment,” and has in fact repudiated its duty to
do so.**5 The purported tender by Antrix of a refund of the upfront capacity reservation fee, even
assuming that the tender could be attributed to India, manifestly does not correlate to the fair

market value of the Devas system and business at the time of the taking.**°

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent argues that India did not offer to pay compensation because the Claimants had
no right to compensation.>*” Antrix tendered a check to Devas to reimburse the upfront capacity
reservation fees paid by Devas prior to the termination of the Devas Agreement, which was
rejected by Devas.*** The Respondent characterizes this conduct by the Claimants as an
unjustified attempt to claim additional compensation from the State in circumstances where their
claim is dependent on and limited by the Devas Agreement.*” In any event, the Respondent
submits that the fair market value would be less than the amount tendered to and rejected by

Devas.*"°

s The Pendency of a Breach of Contract Claim
a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants aver that, regardless of the outcome of the ICC arbitration, the provisions of the
Devas Agreement do not preclude a finding of expropriation or obviate the Respondent’s

obligation to pay damages for such expropriation.*!

According to the Claimants, “the fact that a breach may give rise to a contract claim does not
mean that it cannot also—and separately—give rise to a treaty claim. Even if the two perfectly
coincide, they remain analytically distinct, and necessarily require different enquiries.”*”
Accordingly, although “a mere failure to comply with a contractual obligation [would not]
constitute expropriation,” a violation of a contract “which was the result of use of sovereign
power, such as a decree annulling the contractual rights, may amount to an expropriation.”*7
Therefore, the Respondent cannot escape liability for expropriation by relying on the provisions
of the Devas Agreement.*“*

In this instance, the Claimants assert that the force majeure clause** of the Devas Agreement
cannot justify the expropriation. Notwithstanding the results of the contractual dispute in the ICC
arbitration,™° nothing in this agreement or in the Treaty insulates the Respondent from its own
State responsibility under the Treaty for the action it took gua sovereign to “annul” a contract.”
In the same vein, the Respondent cannot escape liability for expropriation by relying upon Article
7(b) and (c) of the Devas Agreement, governing the termination of this contract.** To accept the

Respondent’s position would give “Antrix carte blanche to terminate the contract on any basis it

wanted and then cap its contractual liability by refunding Devas the Upfront Capacity Reservation

Fees.”*”

In any event, the Claimants argue that the Respondent acknowledges that the provisions of Article
7(b) and (c) are not operative.’ The ASG recognized that Article 7(c) was inoperative by July
2010, once the frequency and orbital slot coordination was obtained.**! The Respondent’s
invocation of Article 7(b) fares no better, as its effects could have only been triggered if Devas
had exercised its option to terminate the contract under this Article—and not Antrix, as it actually

happened.**?

Finally, even if, as the Respondent asserts,**

Article 7 were construed as limiting Antrix’s
contractual damages in the event of improper termination, the Claimants submit that this cannot
operate to insulate the Respondent from liability for violations of the Treaty, especially in light
of the fact that Antrix would have been obliged to perform the contract had the expropriation not

554

occurred.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ argument regarding the pendency of a breach of
contract claim responds to a non-issue in this arbitration.’ The Respondent agrees that a
distinction exists between a breach of contract by a State acting in a commercial capacity and a
breach effected through the exercise of sovereign powers.**° Nonetheless, in the Respondent’s
view, the Claimants’ discussion is relevant only to a case where the State has breached its
contractual obligations through the exercise of sovereign authority, whereas no claim has been
raised that India breached the Devas Agreement.*”” Rather, the issue is whether the State exercised

its sovereign authority to abrogate any commitment it had to the Claimants, and, on that score,

Page 112 of 141

there can be no genuine dispute.*** The Respondent contends that, in a case where the State has
no contractual obligation, adopting the Claimants’ theory would mean that any exercise of
sovereign authority having an adverse impact on a private party would constitute an expropriation,

which is untenable.*?

In the Respondent’s view, nothing in the Claimants’ discussion on the force majeure clause and
the termination provisions of the Devas Agreement has any bearing on these basic points. The
Respondent first denies that it could have ever stated, as the Claimants submit, that “the
expropriation was justified merely because the contract contemplated a ‘Force Majeure

999561

Event, since it has always been the Respondent’s position that no expropriation occurred in

this case.5

The relevance of the force majeure clause, as well as all other provisions of the Devas
Agreement reviewed in the Statement of Defence,*® is that they all make clear that Devas did not
have an acquired right to proceed with the Devas Agreement uninterrupted by any governmental
action, and that implementation of the project required a number of governmental approvals

which the Government of India had no commitment whatsoever to issue.**

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal will address seriatim the arguments raised by the Parties. In light of the above
conclusion of the Tribunal establishing the Respondent’s partial liability, any liability under
Article 6 of the Treaty would only apply to the 40% of the value of the Agreement resulting from
the application of the CCS decision to matters other than the essential security interests of the

State.

L. The Existence of an Expropriation

The Tribunal has already ruled above*® that the Claimants were qualifying both as investors and

having made an investment under the Treaty, and that part of the CCS decision opened the door

to claims for expropriation under the Treaty. There is no need to repeat here the considerations
which led the Tribunal to that conclusion. The Claimants therefore had property which could be

the subject of expropriation.

2 The Lawfulness of the Expropriation

The Tribunal will proceed to analyze the five elements covered by the Parties in that respect.

a. Public Purpose

The Tribunal is of the view that the expropriation by the Respondent was made for a public
purpose. Even leaving aside the military and paramilitary needs which the Tribunal has found to
come under Article 11(3) of the Treaty, the reference by the Respondent in the CCS decision to
“other public utility services as well as for societal needs” clearly indicate that the annulment of
the Devas Agreement was made for public purposes. Article 6 of the Treaty does not require the
Respondent to spell out in detail what these specific public purposes are but, in any event,
Mr. Anand, in his testimony referred to above,* has described the wide spectrum of services
which could come under that definition and which are clearly coming under the public purpose

condition mentioned in Article 6.

As to the Claimants’ argument that the Respondent’s actions were not “proportional” to that

purpose, the Tribunal recognizes that, as stated in Deutsche Bank AG v. Sri Lanka, “

(a) number
of tribunals, including Tecmed v. Mexico, Azurix v. Argentina and LG&E vy. Argentina have
adopted a proportionality requirement in relation to expropriatory treatment.” On the basis of the
evidence submitted, the Tribunal is of the view that the measure adopted by the CCS was justified

by a substantial public interest.

b. Due Process

The difficulty in the present case is the dual purpose of the decision of the CCS, which acted in
part for reasons of national security under Article 11(3) and for general public purposes covered

by Article 6 of the Treaty.

See supra, para. 360, fn. 467.

PCA Case No. 2013-09
Award on Jurisdiction and Merits
Page 114 of 141

As to the argument of the Respondent that due process does not require consultation as to national
security matters, the Tribunal agrees that such circumstances absolve the Respondent from

following the principles of international due process enunciated above by the Claimants.

As to the non-security purposes of the CCS decision, the Tribunal considers that the principles of
international due process mentioned by the Claimants should apply. In that respect, the

Respondent breached that condition of Article 6 of the Treaty.

c. Potential Discrimination in the Expropriation

Although there is passing reference to foreign parties or foreign investment in the DOS Note for
the Cabinet Committee on Security of February 16, 2011, none of these references give any
indication that the participation of foreign parties or foreign investment was a factor that played
any role in the recommendation of DOS to the CCS. Furthermore, nothing in the decision of the

CCS can lead to the conclusion that such factors were taken into account in any way.

The argument of the Claimants in this respect is therefore rejected.

d. Fair and Equitable Compensation

The Tribunal, by majority, has concluded that the Claimants would be entitled to compensation
for the part of the decision of the CCS that does not relate to “the essential security interests” of

the State.

The fact that Antrix tendered a check to Devas to reimburse the upfront capacity reservation fees
paid by Devas under the Agreement is irrelevant for this matter. As indicated above, the Parties
agree that a distinction must be made between the contractual obligations between Devas and

Antrix and the obligations of the Respondent under the Treaty.

In the present instance, it is uncontested that the Respondent paid no compensation whatsoever
to the Claimants when it expropriated the Claimants’ investment for purposes other than its

“essential security interests.”

e. The Pendency of a Breach of Contract Claim

The debate between the Parties on this subject has been in good part been overtaken by events,
the ICC tribunal having found that Antrix was in breach of its contractual obligations and that it

must pay USD 535 million plus interest to Devas.

PCA 159163

424.

425.

PCA Case No. 2013-09
Award on Jurisdiction and Merits
Page 115 of 141

In the present case, there was no contractual obligation between the Claimants and the Respondent
and the Tribunal is only called upon to decide whether there has been a breach of obligations

under the Treaty.

3 Conclusion

On the basis of the above analysis, the Tribunal has come to the conclusion that the Claimants are
entitled to claim compensation under Article 6 of the Treaty for the expropriation of their
investment for the part of the Respondent’s decision which relates to matters other than national

security, as discussed above.

CHAPTER VIII - FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

569

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS
Article 4(1) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:

(1) Investments and returns of investors of either Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party.
According to the Claimants, the expropriatory nature of the Respondent’s actions, as well as its
violation of the Claimants’ “legitimate expectations” as investors in India mandate the conclusion
that the Respondent has breached the fair and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard embodied in
Article 4(1) of the Treaty. According to the Claimants, such breach exists regardless of the actual

content of the FET standard applicable under the Treaty.**

The Respondent’s primary contention is that the FET standard embodied in the Treaty does not
go beyond the minimum standard required by customary international law, and, even if an

expansive FET standard were applicable, the Claimants’ claims would still be untenable.*®

L The Applicable Standard of Treatment
a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants’ position is that a broad standard of FET applies to the present case. This standard
of treatment is construed as “an obligation to treat a foreign investor’s investment in a way that
does not frustrate the investor’s underlying legitimate and reasonable expectations,”*”° and not in
a way that is manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable...or discriminatory....”*7!
This standard also includes “the exercise of good faith or the absence of manifest irrationality,
arbitrariness or perversity by [the host State],”*”* and “a proportionate relationship” between the

supposed governmental aims and the State measures in question.*”*

For the Claimants, the Respondent’s argument that no broad FET standard applies is negated by
the White Industries award,°" in which the equivalent clause in the Australia-India BIT was
interpreted as “a mainstream treaty FET clause, protecting an investor’s ‘legitimate

o99575

expectations. Accordingly, the Respondent’s submission that the FET clause in India’s BITs

should be interpreted differently than other similarly-worded clauses fails.*”°

Moreover, the Respondent’s invocation of the “customary minimum treatment” standard,*”” is at

odds with two decades of jurisprudence and commentary.*” The Claimants note that “[t]he

customary international law minimum standard of treatment may evolve in accordance with
changing State practice, manifesting to some degree expectations within the international
community.”°” In this regard, the Claimants contend that there is presently no material distinction

in practice between the FET standard and the obligations owed by India under customary

international law.**°

Even if the 1969 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection on Foreign Property (the “OECD

Draft Convention’)**' treats a treaty-based FET clause as equivalent to the customary

international law level of protection,** the Claimants contend that the manifest intention of this

Draft Convention was to buttress the customary international law minimum standard by

583

emphasizing that it already required FET.

The Claimants also consider the excerpts and authorities relied upon by the Respondent to reject
an expanded FET standard beyond the minimum standard of treatment provided by customary
international law and argue that they do not support the Respondent’s case.*** According to the
Claimants, these are all post-2001 NAFTA authorities, which are not useful in an analysis of the

FET provision in the Treaty*** because of specific Notes of Interpretation by the three NAFTA

equating FET with the customary standard appear to be an attempt to promote both standards, not weaken
them.

standard (see supra, fn. 603).

States pursuant to which the NAFTA FET standard was defined as not requiring “treatment in
addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary minimum standard of treatment.”**°
Whatever the answer to the relationship between the FET standard and customary international
law, the Claimants argue that the Neer standard cited by India is inapposite to the present case.**”
Notably, (i) Neer is not an investment protection case, as it concerned the host State’s alleged
failure to punish criminals responsible for the killing of a U.S. citizen;>** (ii) Neer does not discuss
the words “fair and equitable” that the Tribunal must interpret;**? (iii) the so-called Neer test—
which turns on whether conduct has fallen below “international standards”—is ultimately a
circular standard that leaves those standards undefined.*” Finally, even under NAFTA’s 2001
revision, only Glamis Gold has expressed the “customary international law minimum” in terms
of the Neer standard.*°' A majority of cases follows the Mondev view that customary international

law has moved on since Neer and now sustains a broader concept of FET.*”

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the applicable standard is the minimum standard of FET under
customary international law, the content of which is to be construed from a number of decisions

following the 1926 Neer v. Mexico decision,’ which provides that “the threshold [for the

insufficiency.” See L.F.H. Neer and Pauline E. Neer v. Mexico, Mexico-U.S. General Claims Commission,

Moreover, attempts to expand the FET concept beyond the minimum standard of treatment

provided by customary international law in the absence of evidence evincing such intention of the

Contracting Parties have been severely and widely criticized.*° The Respondent also notes that

neither the language of the Treaty nor its travaux préparatoires indicates that anything beyond

the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law applies.*°

As a general proposition, the Respondent further argues that the FET clause of Indian BITs was
inspired by the OECD Draft Convention,*” which provides for the application of this minimum
standard of treatment.’ The Respondent submits that this position is reinforced by other

countries, such as the three NAFTA States by their interpretive statement confirming that the

concept of FET has never been intended to reach beyond this minimum standard of treatment,*”

and that arbitral tribunals upholding an expansive interpretation of FET were acting contrary to
their intentions.™ In the Respondent’ s view, its authorities’ disprove the Claimants’ contention
that “customary international law has moved on considerably since Neer...and the modern

customary minimum now approaches, if not equals, the full scope of the modern FET

602

standard.”*” First and foremost, the Claimants’ view is not supported by the consensus necessary

to constitute a rule of customary international law as established in the North Sea Continental
Shelf case. Also, the Respondent explains that if there was no difference between the
Claimants’ broad concept of FET and the minimum customary standard, there would have been

no reason for the NAFTA countries to enter an interpretive statement clarifying that such is not

the case.

According to the Respondent, even if the Claimants’ broader FET standard applied, in the absence
of a specific commitment by the State, this could not deprive the State of its inherent sovereign
right to regulate the conduct of business within its borders, and an investor cannot assume that

there will be no adverse changes in law or policy affecting its investment. A similar approach

the broad FET standards are promoted, by highlighting that no such affirmation is made (see Statement of
Reply, fn. 296, citing Opinions of the Public International Law Directorate of the Swiss Federal Political
Department (Mémoire de la Direction du Droit International Public du Département Politique Fédéral),
in L. Caflisch, La pratique suisse en matiére de droit international public, p. 178 (Ex. R-74). Likewise, the
Respondent is critical about the Claimants’ reliance on Professor Mann to contend that the minimum
treatment envisaged by FET goes beyond the minimum standard (see Statement of Reply, para. 153, citing
F.A. Mann, ‘British Treaties for the Promotion and Protection of Investments’ (1981) 52 The British
Yearbook of International Law 241, p. 244 (Ex. CL-56). According to the Respondent, Professor Mann’s
subsequent writings directly contradict this view. See Respondent's Rejoinder, para. 121, citing F.A. Mann,

is taken by Indian law, which governs the Devas Agreement.” As the Supreme Court of India
has held, there is a distinction between “legitimate expectations” and “a wish, a desire or a
hope.”® Accordingly, no claim for violation of legitimate expectations can be made where the

009

Government’s decision is a matter of policy in accordance with public interes! ‘unless, in a

given case, the decision or action taken amounts to an abuse of power.”°!°

2 The Alleged Violation of the FET Standard
a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that, throughout DOS’ approval and repeated endorsement of the Devas
Agreement, which carried the full imprimatur of the Government of India,°!' the Respondent
created the legitimate expectation that Devas had a non-pre-emptible, exclusive right to use the
S-band and operate the Devas system, and therefore that the State would not seek to undermine
the Devas Agreement.°'? Many of these assurances were made directly to the Claimants, and were
thus plainly intended to induce the Claimants to inject capital.°!

According to the Claimants, the Respondent thereafter fabricated a force majeure decision to try

1,514

to mask a deliberate revocation of the Devas Agreement making only abrupt, “ambush”

announcements regarding its intentions.°' The Claimants allege that their legitimate expectations

in connection with their investment in Devas were completely subverted by these actions.°!° Such
conduct, the Claimants argue, constitutes an abuse of regulatory discretion seeking to destroy the

1,017

agreed legal framework for the investment,°'’ not only in violation of the duty to act transparently

and consistently®'® but also against good faith.°!°

The Claimants also argue that the Respondent’s conduct unjustly enriched the State at the expense
of the investor—a recognized indicia of unfair and inequitable conduct.%° The Claimants
underline that the bad faith conduct of the Government of India has been compounded by
harassing measures in order to punish Devas and the Claimants for exercising their respective
rights.!All of these actions undertaken by the Respondent constitute a violation of the FET

standard embodied in Article 4(1) of the Treaty.

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s stance is that the Claimants’ FET claims would not have merit even under their

623

broad interpretation of the FET provision of the Treaty°” and are an attempt to fill pro forma the

hole in their expropriation case.°*

The Respondent avers that the Claimants’ “legitimate expectations” are based on a number of

625

mistaken assumptions®~ and ignore various key facts. First, the Government of India was not a
party to the Devas Agreement, but a regulator, and no commitment or stabilization clause

prevented it from taking policy decisions that might affect the Devas Agreement.°° Second, the

S-band spectrum could not be used for terrestrial communications under current Indian
regulations and policies.©” Third, the Government of India could not issue a license for the
terrestrial component of the proposed Devas Services without auction, in contravention of TRAI
policy.®* Finally, the Devas Agreement itself set forth a comprehensive scheme for its potential
termination, which had been thoroughly negotiated and provided for nothing but the refund of the
paid upfront capacity reservation fees if it were invoked.”

The Respondent then denies that the Government of India fabricated “a sham ‘force majeure’
decision to try to mask a deliberate revocation of the [Devas Agreement].”°° Such an allegation
ignores the extensive documentary record recalling the extensive deliberation process!
establishing the basis for the Government of India’s decision to reserve S-band for national

52 ag well as the terms and conditions of the Devas Agreement itself. It would

security purposes,’
also require the Tribunal to assume the mala fide of the Government of India when acting in its

official capacity, which is improper as a matter of law.°*

Furthermore, the Respondent notes that the Claimants do not point to any fact to support the
allegation that its conduct “unjustly enriched the state at the expense of the investor.”®*° The
Claimants stance cannot prevail because (i) the Claimants had no acquired rights in this case; and
(ii) the State did not take the policy decision to enrich itself, as the S-band was reserved for non-

commercial, strategic purposes.°°

The Respondent finally argues that Government officials requesting corporate information or
conducting tax audits cannot be legitimately said to be acting “in bad faith.”®*” Also, the Claimants
have shown that they are perfectly capable of exercising the right to seek a remedy for such

allegedly improper investigations in the appropriate courts of India.°**

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

The Tribunal has concluded that the Claimants made a qualifying investment under the Treaty
but that the Respondent was partly justified in invoking Article 11(3) of the Treaty and thereby

ordering Antrix to annul its contract with Devas.

This being said, Devas had between February 7, 2006 and February 17, 2011 a valid and effective

contract with Antrix, and the Claimants were entitled to the protections of the Treaty.
Article 4(1) of the Treaty reads:

Investments and returns of investors of either Contracting Parties shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Neither
Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the

j or disposal of i in its territory by investors

 

of the other Contracting Party.

For the purpose of this section of this Award, the Tribunal will concentrate on the first sentence
of this Article. The question therefore is: were the Claimants granted fair and equitable treatment

between February 7, 2006 and February 17, 2011?

The Parties spent some considerable time debating whether the FET clause under Article 4(1) was

limited to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law.

According to the Respondent, there is nothing in the language of the Treaty or in its travaux
préparatoires which would incorporate anything beyond the minimum standard of treatment
under customary international law. It refers to the 1969 OECD Draft Convention on the Protection
of Foreign Property which in one of its comments states that “the standard required conforms in
effect to the ‘minimum standard’ which forms part of customary international law.” The
Respondent also quotes a number of commentators and arbitral awards criticizing an expansive

interpretation of the FET concept beyond the minimum standard provided under customary

international law.* It also notes that some countries have introduced a clear statement in their
model BITs to the effect that FET is to be determined in accordance with the customary

international law minimum standard.

In the Respondent’s view, the standard expressed in the 1926 Opinion of the Mexico-US General
Claims Commission in the Neer v. Mexico case“! remains valid at least in terms of requiring an
extremely high threshold.“? The Neer standard was to the effect that, in order to constitute a
breach of customary international law, the treatment of an alien “should amount to an outrage, to
bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of
international standards that every reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its

insufficiency.” It quotes, in support, a few (mainly NAFTA) arbitral awards.

In any event, says the Respondent, no violation of the FET standard occurred in this case, even
under an expansive interpretation of it. Citing a number of authors, arbitral awards and Indian
judgments, it argues that (i) an FET obligation cannot, absent a specific commitment by the State,
deprive the State of its inherent sovereign right to regulate the conduct of business within its
borders; (ii) the mere existence of a BIT is no substitute for such a commitment; (iii) absent such
a specific commitment, an investor cannot assume that there will be no adverse changes in law or

policy affecting its investment; and (iv) hopes and dreams are not legitimate expectations.“

As to the Claimants, they counter, referring also to a number of arbitral awards and commentaries
that (i) the FET obligation means more than the minimum standard of treatment under customary
international law as presented by the Respondent; (ii) that the Respondent’ s invocation of the
customary minimum treatment standard is unavailing, as it assumes a material distinction in

practice between the FET standard and the obligations it owes under customary international

law;®® and (iii), on any view, Article 4(1) creates a higher level of investment protection than the

1926 Neer standard invoked by the Respondent.”
On this debate, the Tribunal shares the view expressed in El Paso:

The Tribunal considers this discussion to be somewhat futile, as the scope and content of the

minimum standard of international law is as little defined as the BIT’s FET standard, and as

the true question is to decide what substantive protection is granted to foreign investors

through the FET. The issue is not one of comparing two undefined or weakly defined

standards; it is to ascertain the content and define the BIT standard of fair and equitable

treatment.“
The Tribunal does not subscribe to the view that, today, a violation of the customary minimum
standard was frozen as defined in Neer “to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or
to insufficiency of governmental action so far short of international standards that every
reasonable and impartial man would readily recognize its insufficiency.” It is now generally
recognized that customary international law has evolved since 1926, some awards giving the
required minimum treatment a wider interpretation than others.°° FET in the Treaty, as in most
other treaties, is not defined and the Treaty contains no wording limiting its scope and content to
some external standard, whether it be international customary law or something else. In
determining that scope and content, the Tribunal must rely on Article 31 of the VCLT,®! which
requires a treaty to be “interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be

given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.”

from the international law minimum standard and its evolution under customary international law”; Azurix

and security permits an interpretation setting “higher standards than required by international law,” goes
on to say that the Tribunal “considers that its content is substantially similar whether the terms are
interpreted in their ordinary meaning, as required by the Vienna Convention, or in accordance with
customary international law.” However, it is now well established that the concept of the minimum standard
of customary law cannot be equated with the Neer description of it.

As stated in E/ Paso, “the legitimate expectations of the investors have generally been considered
central in the definition of FET, whatever its scope.”°? There is an overwhelming trend to
consider the touchstone of fair and equitable treatment to be found in the legitimate and reasonable
expectations of the parties, which derive from the obligation of good faith. This has been aptly
stated by the tribunal in Waste Management II: “In applying this standard it is relevant that the
treatment is in breach of representations made by the Host State which were reasonably relied on

99653

by the claimant. And the tribunal in Saluka reiterated the same idea, when stating: “The

standard of ‘fair and equitable treatment’ is therefore closely tied to the notion of legitimate
expectations which is the dominant element of that standard.”*
A number of cases mentioned by each Party (quoting different sections) reached a similar

conclusion.

In Suez/AWG,°™ the tribunal, by majority, held that the FET standard is breached when a State

“frustrates or thwarts” the “legitimate expectations” on which an investment was based.

In Bayindir,°* the tribunal stated that the FET imposes the “obligation to act transparently and
grant due process, to refrain from taking arbitrary or discriminatory measures, from exercising
coercion or from frustrating the investor’s legitimate expectations with respect to the legal

framework affecting the investment.”

In CMS,°" the tribunal described the FET standard as “inseparable from stability and
predictability” and held that “this is an objective requirement unrelated to whether the Respondent
had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the measures in question.” The annulment

committee in that case®® addressing this part of the award, declared that “it was adequately

founded on the applicable law and the relevant facts” and added that “legitimate expectations ...

may be relevant to the application of the fair and equitable treatment clause.”

The Tribunal need not enter into a lengthy discussion of the concept and scope of the FET standard
in general. Suffice it to say for the purpose of this case that, whatever the scope of the FET
standard, the legitimate expectations of the investors have generally been considered central to its
definition. That concept however is not unlimited. Thus, the Claimants could not have had
legitimate expectations that Article 11(3) of the Treaty would never be invoked. That provision

was in full effect at the time of the signing of the Agreement in 2006 and no clause in that

 

A or any by the Respondent would indicate that the Claimants

would be protected from the invocation of that provision of the Treaty. In that respect, the Tribunal
has already found that 60% of the Respondent’s decision validly relied on the protection of its
essential security interests under Article 11(3) of the Treaty, while 40% would come under the

expropriation provision of its Article 6.

As mentioned in the El Paso case, FET is an objective concept; it is the result of interests and
rights of both the investor and the State and the result of such balancing may vary with the

circumstances. In that context, transparency and good faith are key factors.

Independently of the text of the Devas Agreement, the Claimants were entitled to legitimate
expectations that, in accordance with the text of the Treaty as well as under a general obligation

under international law, the Respondent would deal with them in good faith.

The preamble of the Treaty mentions the desire of the Contracting Parties “to create favourable
conditions for greater flow of investments.” In Article 3(2), it states that “[e]ach Contracting Party
shall in accordance with its laws render assistance to the investors of the other Contracting Party,
whose investments were made in its territory, for obtaining the required clearances and

permissions.” To these general statements must be added the provisions of Articles 4 and 6 of the

El Paso Energy International Co. v. Argentina, ICSID Case No. ARB/03/15, Award, 2011, paras 356-365
(Ex. CL-I1).

Article 21 of the Devas Agreement states: “The Parties hereby agree that they intend to discharge their
obligations in utmost good faith. They therefore agree that they will, at all times, act in good faith and make
all attempts to resolve all differences however arising out of or in connection with this Agreement by
discussion.” Similarly, Exhibit B of the Devas Agreement states in Articles 3.1.1.1 and 3.1.1.2: “However,
immediately following the launch failure or total satellite failure, if ANTRIX has sufficient reasons to
believe that the implementation of accelerated schedule is not feasible, both parties will discuss in good
faith to arrive at a mutually acceptable solution.” (Ex R-1/JCB -37).

Treaty dealing with the treatment of investments and expropriation which have already been

extensively considered in this award.

If one searches for a general obligation of good faith under international law, one need not go
further than the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties in which one can find no less than five
mentions of the requirement of good faith.' This principle of good faith is not only self-standing,
but it also stems from the concept of FET. In this regard, the Tribunal agrees with the Tecmed
panel that “the commitment of fair and equitable treatment... is an expression and part of the bona

fide principle recognized in international law.”®?

However, this does not mean that every
violation of FET by a State requires bad faith.° The good faith principle may simply require that
the foreign investment must be treated in a manner such that it “will not affect the basic
expectations that were taken into account by foreign investor to make the investment.”°*

Reviewing the facts of this case, the Tribunal must conclude that, if the Respondent had acted in
good faith, it would have informed the Claimants about the decision of the Space Commission of
2 July 2010 to annul the Agreement. Unfortunately, nothing of the sort occurred; in fact, the
evidence shows that right up to February 8, 2011, the Claimants were completely left in the dark
about the Space Commission’s decision and the alleged growing needs of the military and their
possible impact on the Agreement; apart from notices that there were delays in the launching of
the satellite, there were no signals from the Respondent, all along, that the Agreement might be
challenged or modified. This includes a number of meetings with senior officials (including one
with the National Security Advisor to the Prime Minister on June 22, 2010) and Government
Ministers and various correspondence, as well as the assurance given by Dr. Radhakrishnan

during a meeting in Prague on September 29, 2010, that the GSAT-6 satellite would be shipped

in early December 2010.5 The Tribunal has unchallenged evidence that at none of those
meetings did the Respondent indicate that the Space Commission had decided to annul the Devas
Agreement or that that there were competing military or other societal needs for the S-band

spectrum which had been allocated to Devas.

It would be to no avail for the Respondent to argue that such strategic information could not be
communicated to the Claimants. Indeed, the required disclosure would not entail informing the
Claimants of the nature of those needs or revealing any secret information. The Respondent could
and should have simply informed the Claimants that the Agreement was in jeopardy because of
societal and strategic needs; it would then have been up to the Claimants to decide how much
financial and other resources they were willing to put at risk in that context or to propose to the

Respondent possible alternative solutions.

Leaving aside the requirement of “utmost good faith” contained in the Agreement, the
Respondent’s conduct constitutes a clear breach of the simple good faith required under
international law and the FET clause of Article 2 of the Treaty; the Respondent must be liable for
this wrongful behavior and must compensate the Claimants for damages that they may have
suffered thereby from July 2, 2010 to February 17, 2011, the date of the CCS decision. The

Respondent's liability subsequent to that decision has been addressed earlier in this award.

As to the Claimants’ argument that, by its conduct, the Respondent’s unjustly enriched itself, it
need not be separately addressed, taking into account the Tribunal’s decision concerning

expropriation and the breach of good faith under the FET provision of the Treaty.

As to the alleged harassing measures that the Respondent would have taken, the Tribunal has not
received sufficient evidence to conclude that these measures were taken to punish the Claimants
or Devas for exercising their respective rights. There is a world of difference between this case
and the Desert Line Projects LLC v. Yemen upon which the Claimants rely, where the Tribunal
held that a settlement agreement “was imposed onto the Claimant under physical and financial

duress.”°%

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

Article 4(1) of the Treaty provides, in relevant part:

...-Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by unreasonable or discriminatory
res the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments in its
territory by investors of the other Contracting Party.

 

LL The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants aver that “the determination of reasonableness is in its essence a matter for the

arbitrator’s judgment,”°”

but they also identify a number of elements from which
unreasonableness may be derived. First, a finding of unfair and inequitable treatment may derive
in unreasonableness.°* Second, reasonableness requires that the State’s conduct “bears a
reasonable relationship to some rational policy.”°® Third, “withdrawal of undertakings and
assurances given in good faith to investors as an inducement to [them] making an [investment] is
by definition unreasonable....”°” Fourth, unreasonableness is a synonym for arbitrariness, as is
also pleaded by the Respondent.®”' On these grounds, the Respondent’s measures—consisting of
the nullification of an investment on specious grounds through a fabricated and self-made force
majeure in direct contravention of numerous prior State approvals and assurances of support—

are plainly “unreasonable.”

The Claimants further argue that, separately and independently, the Respondent’s measures also
violated Article 4(1) of the Treaty because they were “discriminatory,” in that they deliberately

targeted investors®’ precisely on the grounds of them being foreigners standing to gain from the

investment. The Claimants stress that the Respondent has failed to respond to the documented

evidence that has been submitted in support of this contention.°”°

2 The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent submits that the term “unreasonable” in Article 4(1) of the Treaty is
interchangeable with “arbitrary,” which appears to be agreed by the Claimants.°”* In turn, the
standard definition of arbitrariness is a “wilful disregard of due process of law, and act which

”°677 or a “manifest impropriety.”°”* The

shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety,
threshold of proof for arbitrary conduct is high, and the burden is on a claimant to meet that
standard.*” Conversely, a measure is reasonable when there is a rational policy to which the
measure in question is reasonably related.*° On this basis, the Respondent concludes that there
was nothing improper, shocking or unreasonable in the Government of India’s decision to reserve
the S-band spectrum for non-commercial, strategic requirements in light of the nation’s
burgeoning security needs.°*!

Further, the Respondent denies that these measures were discriminatory, since no “capricious,
irrational or absurd differentiation in the treatment accorded to [the Claimants] as compared to

99682

other entities or sectors”®** was present. The CCS reserved S-band for non-commercial, strategic

use, prohibiting its use by all private parties, Indian and foreign.

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

According to the Claimants, its case—‘featuring covert action to undermine a contract, a bogus
‘policy’ decision engineered towards commercial ends, and an insincere after-the-fact attempt to
justify these self-interested actions under the mantra of ‘security’—overwhelmingly proves a

breach of Article 4(1)’s prohibition on ‘unreasonable’ actions.”

The Tribunal, by majority, has already concluded that, although extraneous factors may have
played a role in the Respondent's decision, the Respondent had reasonable justification of military
and other societal needs to take that decision partly under Article 11(3) and partly under Article

6 of the Treaty.

The Claimants also argue, quoting the BG Group award“ that this case involves the “withdrawal
of undertakings and assurances given in good faith to investors as an inducement to their making
investments” and that such action is “by definition unreasonable and a breach of the Treaty.”°*°
In that particular respect, the Claimants are on more solid ground and the Tribunal has already
covered this issue above when discussing good faith and transparency. As demonstrated in a
number of arbitral awards, while FET may have a broader meaning than “unreasonable or

discriminatory measures,” such measures would automatically constitute a breach of FET.*°

As to the argument about discrimination, the Claimants refer to statements made by officials after
the nullification of the Agreement, in which they sought to justify their actions on the grounds
that foreigners might have profited from the Devas system and some reference to that argument

can be found in documents anterior to the Government decision.

However, looking at the Space Commission Note for the Cabinet Committee on Security,” o

ne
can find a few references to foreign ownership but there is no suggestion that the Devas
Agreement should be annulled because of that fact. Thus, in Article 2 of that Note, the

Commission refers to the SATCOM policy approved by the Government of India on June 24,

1997, which authorized foreign parties to lease INSAT capacity. In Article 37, there is a mention
that, among other subjects, the Commission, at its July 2, 2010 meeting, deliberated on foreign
equity in Devas but the minutes of that meeting merely state that the Chairman answered these

various queries.** Elsewhere in these minutes, it is stated:

Noting that ICC has not met since 2004, Commission suggested for reviving the ICC
mechanism immediately. Also, as the activities of the Antrix have grown in the recent past
involving execution of several contracts, and many of them with foreign parties, Commi
suggested to set up a mechanism to review the structure and functioning of Antrix with a
view to enhance the efficiency and to ensure due diligence of financial, contractual and legal
aspects.

 

That suggestion is restated in the Space Commission Note to the CCS. The same
recommendation is made in the Note to the Space Commission. But, even more significantly,
nowhere in the publication, on February 17, 2011,°! of the CCS decision is there any indication
that foreign ownership may have played any role in its conclusion that the S-band should be

reserved for non-commercial purposes and that the Devas Agreement should be annulled.

The claim under Article 4(1) of the Treaty is therefore rejected.

THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS

The Claimants’ position is that, pursuant to the most favored nation (“MFN”) clauses in
paragraphs 2 and 3 of Articles 4 of the Treaty, they are entitled to the protections set forth in
Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT,°” which provides as follows:

(2) Investments and returns of investors of each Contracting Party shall at all times be
accorded fair and equitable treatment in the territory of the other Contracting Party
and shall enjoy full legal protection and security.©”

The Respondent’s main contention is that the MFN clauses in the Treaty cannot be relied upon
by the Claimants to create an entirely new right as the one embodied in Article 3(2) of the Serbia-
India BIT. Even if it were possible, there would be no breach of the full legal protection and

security clause of the Serbia-India BIT on the facts of the case.

L The Possibility of Importing the ‘Full Legal Protection and Security’ Clause of the
Serbia-India BIT

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit, following the reasoning of the tribunal in White Industries v. India, that
the “full legal protection and security’ clause of Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT, which they
seek to import, is a ‘more favorable substantive provision...in a third party treaty,’ which, by
the plain terms of Article 4(2) and (3), is importable.®° According to the Claimants, this approach

is fully consistent with numerous arbitral decisions,” and must be distinguished from importing

of the Treaty, they would rely on several provisions of BITs signed between India and third countries. Their
final position, recalled in this award, is different from the one expressed in the Notice of Arbitration. See

“an entirely new provision from another treaty,” which is what the Respondent alleges the

Claimants are attempting.°*

In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent’s claim that relying on the ‘full protection and security’
clause of the Serbia-India BIT would entail creating wholly new rights is based on selective
quotations and misreading of a number of decisions, including Paushok®” and Hochtief.”
Whereas Paushok is of no assistance to India because the MFN clause at stake only extended
MEN treatment in respect of the obligation to afford fair and equitable treatment,”"' Hochtief is,
according to the Claimants, helpful to their own position. The claimant in Hochtief sought to rely,
by means of an MEN clause, on a dispute resolution clause in a third party treaty which, unlike
the applicable BIT, did not require the parties to litigate in the Argentine courts for 18 months
before resorting to arbitration. The Hochtief tribunal allowed this importation because “the 18-
month pre-arbitration litigation requirement should be regarded as a matter of the treatment of
investors in exercising their rights in relation to dispute settlement and not as the subject of a
distinct right.”? Equally, the Claimants contend that, the ‘full legal protection and security’
clause of the Serbia-India BIT can be imported because both this BIT and the Treaty cover the
same subject matter, i.e. the treatment of investments, meaning that the rights in the Serbia-India

BIT are not “wholly distinct” from those in the Treaty.”

b. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent avers that the Claimants’ attempt to import an entirely new provision from
another treaty would be improper because it would entail creating a standard that is not present in

the applicable Treaty.” Investor-State tribunals, such as the ones in Hochtief v. Argentina,

Paushok v. Mongolia and Accession Mezzanine v. Hungary” have recognized that an MFN

clause cannot be relied upon to create wholly new rights.””°

2 The Respondent’s Alleged Violation of the ‘Full Legal Protection and Security’
Provision

a. The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that the Respondent has breached the ‘full legal protection and security’
clause of Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT, and, in turn, Article 4(2) and (3) of the Treaty.”””
This clause obligates the host State “to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions
of its administrative bodies is the agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign
investor’s investment withdrawn or devalued.” This standard has been violated by (i) the Indian
Cabinet’s actions, and other affirmative acts, which caused a “withdrawal and devaluation” of the
investment, and (ii) the several government acts that served as a pretextual basis for annulling the

Devas Agreement.””

The Claimants argue that AES v. Hungary, cited by India, does not lead to a different
conclusion.”"” In that case the tribunal held that the respondent State had not breached the “most
constant protection and security obligation” because it had acted “with a view to achieving
objectively rational public policy goals.” By contrast, the Respondent’s measures leading to the
annulment of the Devas Agreement were not aimed, in the Claimants’ case, at a legitimate and
objective policy goal.7!!

Finally, the Claimants argue that it is no answer to the Respondent to claim that, because the
Devas Agreement contained a force majeure clause applicable in the case of “sovereign action,”

there was no “withdraw[al]” or “devaluat[ion]” of the “agreed and approved security and

protection” applicable to the Claimants’ investment.”!? That clause did not give a license to Antrix

to rely upon a self-generated force majeure defence.’

b. The Respondent’s Position

According to the Respondent, even if the Tribunal disregarded its argument that the ‘full
protection and security’ clause of Article 3(2) of the Serbia-India BIT cannot be imported into the
Treaty, there would still be no breach of such clause on the facts of the case because it cannot

operate as a legal stabilization clause.”* In the words of the AES v. Hungary tribunal:

To conclude that the right to constant protection and security implies that no change in law
that affects the investor’s rights could take place, would be practically the same as to
recognizing the existence of a non-existent stability agreement as a consequence of the full
protection and security standard.”!°
The Respondent then denies that the ‘full security and protection’ clause obligates the host State
“to ensure that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the
agreed and approved security and protection of the foreign investor’s investment withdrawn or

devalued.””'®

In the Respondent’s view, it is unclear what “agreed and approved security” the
Claimants refer to because the Devas Agreement made clear that the Government of India could

take decisions in its sovereign capacity, without being limited by a stabilization clause.’!”

THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

As to the possibility of importing the “full protection and security” clause of the Serbia-India BIT,
the Tribunal shares the views expressed by the Claimants concerning the possibility of importing
the “full protection and security” clause of the Serbia-India BIT. The numerous arbitral awards
mentioned by the Claimants and referred to above confirm that conclusion. Moreover, the three
cases mentioned by the Respondent do not support its argument that accepting the importation of
the relevant provision of the Serbia-India BIT would entail creating a standard that is not present

in the applicable Treaty.

As far as the alleged violation by the Respondent of the “full legal protection and security

provision” is concerned, the Tribunal disagrees with the Claimants’ conclusion.

As to the State obligation under the FPS standard, it is generally described as an “obligation of
vigilance and due diligence”’'* and it has generally been applied in the context of “use of

force.”79

The nature of that provision has been aptly described in the E/ Paso award as “no more than the
traditional obligation to protect aliens under international customary law and (that) it is a residual
obligation provided for those cases in which the acts challenged may not in themselves be

9720

attributed to the Government, but to a third party. Tf, on the other hand, the acts can be

attributed to the Government, then the FET standard would apply.

The Tribunal has already decided that the invocation of force majeure by Antrix is attributable to
the State under Article 8 of the ILC Articles. The Claimants’ claim under full protection and

security is therefore rejected.

CHAPTER XI - DECISIONS

501.

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides and awards as follows:

(a) Unanimously, that the Claimants’ claims relate to an “investment” protected under

the Treaty;

(b) Unanimously, that the notice of termination of the Devas Agreement sent by Antrix

to Devas constituted an act of State attributable to the Respondent.

By majority, that the Tribunal lacks ju ‘ion over the Claimants’ claims insofar
as the Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas Agreement was in part directed to

the protection of the Respondent’s essential security interests;

By majority, that the Respondent has expropriated the Claimants’ investment insofar
as the Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas Agreement was in part motivated by
considerations other than the protection of the Respondent’s essential security

interests;

By majority, that the protection of essential security interests accounts for 60% of the
Respondent’s decision to annul the Devas Agreement, and that the compensation
owed by the Respondent to the Claimants for the expropriation of their investment

shall therefore be limited to 40% of the value of that investment;

Unanimously, that the Respondent has breached its obligation to accord fair and

equitable treatment to the Claimants between July 2, 2010 and February 17, 2011.

Unanimously, that the Claimants’ other claims shall be dismissed;

Unanimously, that any decisi

 

nm regarding the quantification of compensation or
damages, as well as any decision regarding the allocation of the costs of arbitration,

shall be reserved for a later stage of the proceedings.
