FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The present dispute arises out of several contracts entered into between the parties for
electrical power generation in Ecuador. For the sake of clarity and expediency, the
Tribunal will address the factual background thematically, each topic being developed

chronologically, whenever possible.
The energy crisis in Ecuador

In 1973, the Government of Ecuador established the /nstituto Ecuatoriano de
Electrificacién (“INECEL”) pursuant to the Basis Electricity Law of 1973, as a state-
owned entity under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy, to carry out the
functions of power generation, transmission, and distribution (Exh. C-11 RforA; Cl. Exh.

028). INECEL was the only entity authorized to produce and provide electricity.

The electricity sector began to deteriorate and, in 1992, a crisis resulted in a national
power shortage (Exh. C-10 RforA). This event prompted Ecuador to issue the First
Emergency Decree No. 3071 (the “First Emergency Decree”) on 7 February 1992,
declaring a state of emergency “because of the shortfall in power generation, due to
the scarcity of rainfall” (Art. 1) and ordering the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds to
enable INECEL to purchase energy (Cl. Exh. 002).

“In the midst of and in response” to the electricity crisis (RforA, J 18), Electroquil was
created on 10 January 1992 (Exh. C-5 RforA, R. Exh. 003). It was the first private
power generator established in Ecuador and the only private generator in the
Guayaquil area. Mr. Gustavo Larrea Real became Electroquil’s Executive President in
1992 upon the request of his former employer, La Cemento Nacional, which was a

large electricity consumer and a stakeholder of Electroquil.

In the month following its creation on 9 February 1992, Electroquil established the first
non-hydro thermal power generation facility in Ecuador, located in the city of

Guayaquil.

Three and a half years later, on 3 October 1995, the President of the Republic of
Ecuador issued a Second Emergency Decree No. 3099 (the “Second Emergency
Decree”). The Second Emergency Decree, in particular, reinstated the state of
emergency and authorized INECEL to execute power purchase agreements on an
emergency basis with private power generators to respond to the pressing demand for
electricity (Exh. C-15 RforA; Cl. Exh. 004).

2.2

20.

The Ecuadorian Parliament enacted the Ley de Régimen del Sector Eléctrico on 10
October 1996, providing inter alia that INECEL be liquidated within a certain time
period. As explained by Dr. Juan Larrea Holguin and Dr. Alejandro Ponce Martinez in
their legal report, this liquidation resulted from the process of liberalization of

contracting in the electricity sector (ER, § 3.7).
The subscription of the PPAs and other related agreements

On 31 October 1995, INECEL and Electroquil entered into a power purchase
agreement (the “PPA 95”) for the importation, assembly, installation, and putting into
service by Electroquil of two new Stewart & Stevenson branded gas turbine generators
(‘Units 1 and 2”) of 42 megawatts each on Electroquil’s Guayaquil plant (the “Plant”) in
order to remedy the power supply shortage (Clauses 2 and 5; Exh. C-18 RforA and Cl.
Exh. 005/R. Exh. 006). Units 1 and 2 were to be put into service no later than the end
of December 1995.

The PPA 95 was valid for a duration of five years from the commencement of
commercial operation of the units (Clause 6.01).

As a fixed cost for the power it supplied to INECEL, Electroquil was to be paid a fixed
amount of USD 12 per kilowatt provided as a charge for ISO capacity and a monthly
energy payment of USD 0.0045 per kilowatt hour provided applicable to the monthly
rounded-off amount of 433 hours of operation at ISO capacity, ie. 5,200 hours per year
(Clause 7.1 of PPA 95).

As a variable cost, at the end of each year, INECEL was to pay for the supply of power
in excess of 5,200 hours at the rate of USD 0.0045 per kilowatt hour (Clause 7.2 of
PPA 95). Furthermore, should the contract administrator not approve Electroquil’s
invoices with regard to variable costs within five days, the invoice in question was to be
considered approved and paid by INECEL within 30 days. On the other hand, if an
invoice was disputed, the corresponding amount was to be transferred into a pending
account awaiting final approval or denial, and any portion of the invoice which was
accepted was to be processed and paid within 15 days. Electroquil was then to provide
INECEL with all supporting documents pertaining to the disputed amounts, failing
which, INECEL would deny the disputed amounts. If the disputed amounts were
justified to INECEL’s satisfaction, the latter was to pay the invoice within 15 days.

Fuel was to be supplied by the Empresa Estatal de Comercializacién y Transporte de
Petrdleos del Ecuador (“Petrocomercial”) for the plant operation and payment was to

be reimbursed by INECEL on a monthly basis, within 30 days of receipt of the related

invoice, based on the fuel consumption measured at the inlet to the turbines (Clauses
7.4 and 15.3 of PPA 95).

Prior to signing the PPA 95, Electroquil was to submit an unconditional, irrevocable and
immediately collectible performance bond issued by a bank or surety company payable
to INECEL in the amount of USD 3,052,800, representing 5% of the total value of the
PPA 95 estimated at USD 61,056,000 (Clause 8).

The PPA 95 also provided for several warranties and penalties in the event that such
warranties were not met. In particular, if the availability of Electroquil’s generating units
was less than the warranted 7,500 hours per year (Clause 10.3), INECEL was entitled
to impose a fine of USD 500 per hour of difference between the warranted and actual
availability (Clause 12.1).

Furthermore, if the number of kilowatt hours generated with a gallon of fuel was less
than the amount warranted in Electroquil’s offer, INECEL could impose a penalty
equivalent to the cost of fuel required to produce the energy not generated for this
reason during the month in question (Clause 12.2). The warranted performance was to

be based on the fuel characteristics attached to PPA 95.

Moreover, in the event that the actual energy provided was less than the amount
warranted in Electroquil’s bid, INECEL could impose a monthly penalty of USD 250 per
percentage point below the amount warranted from the time operations commenced
until the difference was corrected (Clause 12.3).

These penalties could not be imposed if Electroquil’s defaults were due to force
majeure, or to an act of God, as provided in Article 3 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, or to
other reasons not attributable to Electroquil. Furthermore, within the same month, the
penalties could not exceed the amount of the payment that Electroquil received
monthly for the availability of the warranted power. If during a given month the
penalties exceeded the latter amount, INECEL could take action to remedy such
default depending on its seriousness, without prejudice to its right to terminate the PPA
95 if appropriate (Clause 12.4).

The penalties were to be calculated once a year and paid within 15 days of INECEL’s
notice, failing which INECEL could partially call up the performance bond (Clause
12.5). Furthermore, the amount of the penalties was limited to 5% of the total value of
the PPA 95 (Clause 12.6).

The PPA 95 also provided for penalties for delay in the commencement of the
commercial operation of each unit. Electroquil was to pay INECEL a penalty of USD
5,000 for each day of delay, beginning 150 days from the execution of the PPA 95,
except if it was not possible to continue the functional tests for safety reasons, in which
case the testing period was to be extended by an equal number of days (Clause 12.7).

Patricio Burbano de Lara of INECEL was designated as contract administrator under
the PPA 95 on 12 February 1996 (the “Contract Administrator”; R. Exh. 009).

On 3 May 1996, a letter of intent was signed between INECEL and Electroquil
regarding the installment of an additional power generation unit by Electroquil and the
selling of the additional energy generated to INECEL (the “LOI”; R. Exh. 011 and 066).
This LOI was followed by an offer to INECEL, dated 17 May 1996, to install two new
gas turbines, that later materialized in the signature of a second purchase agreement
(Cl. Exh. 06).

The commercial operation of Units 1 and 2 began on 10 May 1996 (R. Exh. 012).
However, on 26 June 1996, a technical failure occurred on Unit 2 leading to its

replacement (R. Exh. 018).

An issue arose around that time regarding the payment by Electroquil of the fuel
provided by Petrocomercial and its corresponding reimbursement by INECEL. To
resolve this issue, the parties agreed that INECEL would buy the fuel directly from
Petrocomercial and would then deliver it to Electroquil (Cl. Exh. 22). On 2 August 1996,
a fuel supply agreement (the “Fuel Supply Agreement”) was entered into between
Petrocomercial and Electroquil, under which Petrocomercial was to supply fuel from the

Libertad-Pascuales fuel pipeline to Electroquil’s plant (Cl. Exh. 048).

As foreseen in the LOI and the subsequent Electroquil offer, INECEL and Electroquil
entered into a second power purchase agreement on 8 August 1996 (“PPA 96”; PPA
95 and PPA 96 will be jointly referred to as the “Agreements” or “PPAs”) for two
additional generating units (“Units 3 and 4”; Clause 2 of PPA 96; Cl. Exh. 006).

INECEL agreed to pay Electroquil a monthly payment for both capacity and power for a
60-month period for Units 3 and 4. Rather than relying upon the ISO capacity to
determine capacity payments like in PPA 95, the PPA 96 contemplated the invoicing of
capacity based upon a contracted rate of 80 MW. The monthly capacity rate was set at
US$ 9 per kW while the rate for power was set at US$ 0.0055 per kWh (Clause 8).

Unlike the PPA 95, the PPA 96 did not provide or guarantee Electroquil a payment for
a minimum number of kWh (i.e. take or pay). Instead, the PPA 96 contemplated that
Units 3 and 4 would provide a probable 250 hours per month of power. Actual

payment for power would be based upon actual power delivered.

The terms and conditions of PPA 96 with respect to the penalty system (Clause 13)
were similar (but not identical) to those of PPA 95. To avoid lengthy repetitions in this
section, the relevant provisions will be referred to in more detail or quoted in the
Chapter entitled “Analysis” when and where appropriate.

The commercial operation of Units 3 and 4 began on 19 June 1997.
The payments under the PPAs and the constitution of the Payment Trusts

Fixed costs for the supply of energy were to be paid under Clause 7.1 of PPA 95 within
30 days of the invoice date through a payment trust established at the Central Bank of
Ecuador in Electroquil’s name. To establish such a trust, INECEL was to execute the
corresponding payment trust agreements prior to the commercial operation of the Plant
(Clause 7.1 of PPA 95). Variable costs for power in excess of 5,200 hours followed a
different regime and were paid directly at the end of each year pursuant to Clause 7.2
of the PPA 95.

PPA 96 provided primarily for the payment of a fixed monthly charge (Clause 8.1),
energy charges (Clause 8.2), and fuel costs (Clause 8.4). Payments were to be made
on a monthly basis through a payment trust at the Central Bank of Ecuador in
Electroquil’s name which was also to be established before the commencement of the
commercial operation of the plant. In addition, PPA 96 provided that the Minister of
Finance would take part in the trust on behalf of the Ecuadorian State in order to make
payments to Electroquil of funds from the Ministry’s account at the Central Bank in the
event that INECEL’s or the trust's funds were insufficient (Clause 8.5 of PPA 96; Cl.
Exh. 006).

By the time the Plants had entered into commercial operation, none of the payment
trusts had been established. Payments under the PPAs were partial, irregular and
made using different means such as cash and State bonds (R. Reply, Jf 171-172).

The first step towards establishment of the payment trusts was the issuance by the
President of the Republic of the Payment Guarantee Decree No. 804 (the “Payment
Decree”) on 10 November 1997. This Decree authorized the Minister of Finance to act

on behalf of the State and create the guarantees of payment for the trusts to be

1

established at the Central Bank by INECEL and Electroquil. These guarantees
empowered the Central Bank to transfer from the Ministry of Finance to the trusts the
necessary funds to pay Electroquil’s outstanding invoices in the event that INECEL
failed to make payments under the PPAs (Cl. Exh. 007). In addition, the Payment
Decree stipulated that INECEL should authorize the trusts to retain from its accounts
the necessary funds in order to assure payment of the monthly invoices submitted by
Electroquil under the PPAs. As the Tribunal understands it, payment trusts and
collateral trusts are often used in project finance transactions, as the trust allows a
single lender to control all the security interests, reducing administration and

transaction costs, and facilitating the enforcement of the security interests.

Subsequently, on 17 February 1998, the Ministry of Finance, INECEL and the Central
Bank of Ecuador executed two identical payment trusts under the PPAs (the “Payment
Trusts”, the “Payment Trust Agreements” or the “95 Payment Trust” and the “96
Payment Trust”). Clause 5 of each Payment Trust provided that, as authorized by the
Payment Decree, the Ministry of Finance grant INECEL a “guarantee to secure
compliance with the payment obligations assumed by” INECEL to Electroquil under the
PPAs. To this end, the Payment Trusts authorized the Central Bank of Ecuador to debit
the Ministry of Finance’s accounts in the event that INECEL were unable to meet its
obligations (Cl. Exh. 010, Cl. Exh. 011, R. Exh. 054).

The fines imposed during the execution of the PPAs

As of mid-1996, INECEL started levying a series of fines against Electroquil under the
PPAs for years 1 to 4 of operation. Six fines were levied against Electroquil prior to
Duke Energy’s investment from July 1996 to late 1997 in relation to the supply of
energy and the delay in starting commercial operations. Electroquil was then fined five
times in 1998. No fines were imposed during the next three years. However, a series of
new fines were imposed from August 2001 to June 2002. In total Electroquil was fined
15 times for USD 8.18 million. Eleven of these fines are now discussed in this

arbitration for a nominal amount of USD 7,292,114 million.

The following chart sets out the disputed fines, the dates on which they were imposed
and settled (by set-off or otherwise), and the date on which Electroquil objected to their

imposition.

The determination of the payment date of the fine or rather the date on which it was set-off or

liquidated proved to be critical. The Claimants did not address this issue. The date indicated by
the Respondent in Annex A attached to its 1*' PHB are not always consistent with the exhibits.
Therefore, the Tribunal has based itself on the information contained in Annex 5 of the first
witness statement of Mr. Tumbaco, controller and CFO for Electroquil since 2000, to which the
Respondent also referred.

Objections
Electroquil had failed to reach the

during years 2 to 5 of PPA 95.
(Exh. C-33 RforA, Cl. Exh. 109, R. Exh.
047).

3 and 4 during October and November
2001.
(Exh. C-34 and C-35 RforA, Cl. Exh. 113, R.
Exh. 100)
On 24 July 2002, the Contract Administrator
revised Fine No. 11 and reduced it to
USD 560,913.68 with respect to the month
of October 2001 and to USD 173,452.74
with respect to the month of November
2001, i.e. a total of USD 734,366.42.
(Cl. Exh. 114, R. Exh. 104).
2.5 Duke Energy’s indirect involvement in the PPAs through its investment in
Electroquil
44. Duke Energy entered the scene, on 12 November 1997, when it signed a letter of intent
for the acquisition of a controlling interest in Electroquil (CI. Exh. 017). A few months
later, on 23 February 1998, it indeed acquired a 51.5% ownership of Electroquil for an
amount of USD 45 million through its wholly-owned subsidiary, DEI (Exh. C-17 RforA,
Cl. Exh. 008, Annex NAV-15 to 1* ER Kaczmarek). Allegedly, Duke Energy's actual
investment represented only USD 38.5 million due to certain trade receivables on the
books of Electroquil (Cl. 1** PHB, | 208). Duke Energy’s share of Electroquil’s capital
increased over time. At the time of the Request for Arbitration, DEI owned 72.3% of
Electroquil’s share capital, which later went up to 79.7% (Cl. Exh. 026, Cl. Exh. 027).
2.6 Ecuador's direct involvement in the PPAs
45. The Ecuadorian Parliament provided in “Ley 98-14" of 30 September 1998 that
INECEL was to enter into a liquidation process and would cease to exist as of
31 March 1999 (Cl. Exh. 015), as envisaged under the Ley de Régimen del sector
Eléctrico of 16 October 1996.
46. As a consequence of INECEL’s liquidation, the President of Ecuador ordered, by

Executive Decree No. 506 of 28 January 1999, that the Ecuadorian State, through the
Ministry of Energy and Mines (“MEM”), assume the rights and obligations of INECEL

 

47.

48.

2.7

49.

50.

51.

52.

53.

under the PPAs as of 1 April 1999 (CI. Exh. 016). INECEL was accordingly dissolved
on 31 March 1999.

INECEL and Electroquil then signed an agreement, on 31 March 1999, setting out the
amounts owed by INECEL to Electroquil for capacity and energy payments under the
Agreements in order to “settle the outstanding payment figures and to establish in a
transparent and accurate manner all those areas that have been the subject of
administrative claims from Electroquil S. A. until March 31, 1999” before the State’s
subrogation of INECEL’s obligations (the “Interim Liquidation Agreement”; Cl. Exh. 103;
R. Exh. 116).

Later that year, on 25 May 1999 and 1 June 1999, the State of Ecuador, through the
MEM, entered into two subrogation agreements with Electroquil (the “Subrogation
Agreements”). Through these agreements, the Ecuadorian State assumed the rights
and obligations of INECEL under the PPAs (Exh. C-12 RforA, C-13 RforA, Cl. Exh.
017, Cl. Exh. 018).

The Med-Arb Agreements

On 30 May 2000, the MEM and Electroquil entered into two identical arbitration and
mediation agreements (the “Med-Arb Agreements”) in connection with the disputes
over fines and the first year of performance of the PPAs (Exh. C-37 and Exh. C-38
RforA, Cl. Exh. 019, Cl. Exh. 020).

Electroquil and the MEM entered into mediation on 19 December 2000 under the
auspices of the Center for Mediation of the Office of the State Attorney-General. The
mediation failed, as evidenced in the related certificate (Cl. Exh. 105).

As a consequence, on 29 January 2001, Electroquil commenced arbitration against the
MEM before the Arbitration and Mediation Center of the Guayaquil Chamber of
Commerce (CI. Exh. 106; the "local arbitration").

In March 2001, the Attorney-General submitted to the local arbitrators that the Med-Arb
Agreements were null and void for breach of Article 4 of the Arbitration Law (Exh. C-44
RforA).

The local arbitral tribunal suspended the proceedings on the merits to review its
jurisdiction on 27 July 2001 (Tr., Vol. 3, 26 April 2006, Dr. Alvarez Grau, pp. 762-763,
Cl. Exh. 120).

54.

60.

On 3 August 2001, the local arbitral tribunal dismissed the Attorney-General’s objection
to jurisdiction and asserted jurisdiction after having heard the observations of the MEM,
the Attorney-General and Electroquil (Exh.C-43 RforA). The Attorney-General filed a
motion for reconsideration on 27 August 2001 (Cl. Exh. 110). The local tribunal
reiterated its denial of the jurisdictional objection in an order of 20 September 2001
(Exh. C-45 RforA). The president of the local arbitral tribunal, Mr. Alvarez Grau,
confirmed during his examination that the August and September orders were "firm
decisions" (Tr. Vol. 3, 26 April 2006, pp. 728-729).

Nonetheless, the local arbitral tribunal issued a final award on 11 March 2002,
declaring that, pursuant to Ecuadorian Arbitration Law, the arbitration was null and void
due to the invalidity of the arbitration clause (Cl. Exh. 023).

The liquidation of the PPAs and related agreements

The MEM and Electroquil entered into a liquidation agreement on 27 November 2001
(the “95 Liquidation Agreement’) in connection with the termination of PPA 95, which
inter alia identified the disputes pending between the parties. This agreement showed a
final balance in favor of Electroquil of USD 4,173,718.65 (Clause 6.2.2) (Exh. C-46
RforA, Cl. Exh. 022, R. Exh. 052).

In connection with the termination of PPA 96, the MEM and Electroquil entered into a
liquidation agreement on 28 August 2002 (the “96 Liquidation Agreement’), which also
set out the disputes pending between the parties and the amounts due. This second
agreement showed a final balance in favor of Electroquil of USD 96,980.64 (Clause
6.2.2) (Exh. C-47 RforA, Cl. Exh. 024, R. Exh. 105).

Both Liquidation Agreements expressly acknowledged the existence of pending arbitral
proceedings under the Med-Arb Agreements (Clause 7 of the 95 and 96 Liquidation
Agreements).

By letter dated 3 September 2002, the MEM requested from the Ecuadorian Central
Bank that the liquidation amount of USD 96,980.64 be paid to Electroquil (R. Exh. 108).

Other contractual relationships were also liquidated at that time. The MEM, Electroquil
and Petroecuador (the state-owned oil and gas monopoly which had sold the fuel to
operate and maintain the power plant through its subsidiary, Petrocomercial) entered
into the so-called Convenio de Reconocimiento y Extincién Reciproca de Obligaciones
(the “Reciprocal Obligations Agreement”) on 30 May 2003. This agreement provided
for (i) the extinction of the payment obligation in favor of Electroquil, which had been

16

61.

62.

2.9

63.

64.

65.

recognized by the MEM in the 95 Liquidation Agreement, of USD 4,173,718.65; (ii) the
extinction of Electroquil’s payment obligation towards Petrocomercial of
USD 4,173,718.65 for outstanding payments for fuel purchases; and (iii) the extinction
of Petroecuador’s obligations towards the Ecuadorian State of USD 3,693,190 (R. Exh.
059) for the payment of due financial obligations.

Almost a year later, on 23 April 2004, an agreement was signed for the offset of the
reciprocal interest accrued on the delayed fuel payments between Electroquil, the
Ecuadorian Government and Petrocomercial (the “Undisputed Amount Interest
Agreement’; R. Exh. 063).

Finally, Duke Energy and Electroquil, both referred to as the “Investors”, and Ecuador
entered into an arbitration agreement (the “Arbitration Agreement”; Exh. C-1 RforA, Cl.
Exh. 025) on 26 April 2004 to submit to the jurisdiction of ICSID certain disputes that
had not been addressed by the Liquidation Agreements. The relevant provisions of the

Agreement will be described and analyzed below.
The proceedings relating to customs duties exemptions

On 23 June 1989, the Ecuadorian Government passed “Ley Numero 30 de
Exoneraci6én de Impuestos a Importaciones del Sector Publico para Obras y Servicios
Prioritarios” (Law Number 30 on the Exoneration of Taxes for Imports of the Public
Sector for Primary Works and Services; “Law Number 30”). According to Law Number
30, goods imported into Ecuador were entitled to duty exemptions if (a) the goods were
needed for an industry or activity that CONADE (Consejo Nacional de Desarrollo — the
National Council for Development) had listed as a priority for the country, and (b) the

Ministry of Finance had specifically authorized their exemption.

Responding to a request from Electroquil, CONADE declared on 8 November 1995 that
goods needed for the generation of electricity were a priority for the country and,
therefore, were eligible for duty free importation under Law Number 30. In addition, on
23 November 1995, the Ministry of Finance of Ecuador confirmed that the turbines
imported under PPA 95 were tax and duty exempt in light of Clause 23.01 PPA 95.

Upon Electroquil’s request, CONADE reaffirmed its view, on 19 September 1996, that
goods required to generate electricity were a national priority and were thus eligible for
tax-free importation. On 11 December 1996, the Ministry of Finance of Ecuador
confirmed that the turbines under PPA 96 were tax and duty exempt in light of Clause
24.1 PPA 96.

In May 1998, after several months of operation, one of the turbines that Electroquil had
imported in connection with PPA 96 (‘Turbine 185-209”) broke down and had to be
shipped back to its manufacturer in the United States for repair.

The Ecuadorian State passed “Ley Organica de Aduanas” (the “Customs Law”) on
13 July 1998. This law established inter alia that a public body (Corporaci6n Aduanera
Ecuatoriana, “CAE”) had exclusive competence over customs-related matters. Under
the Customs Law, only certain public institutions were eligible for duty exemption. The
Customs Law did not provide for duty exemption for private companies.

Turbine 185-209, which had been repaired in the United States, was loaded on a
vessel to be shipped back to Ecuador on 30 July 1998. Two days later, the vessel sank
in the port of Houston and the turbine was lost. Consequently, the turbine manufacturer
offered to ship a spare turbine 185-207, identical to the lost Turbine 185-209, to
Ecuador at no additional cost to Electroquil. Electroquil agreed and the manufacturer
shipped turbine 185-207 on 31 August 1998.

On 1 September 1998, Electroquil requested from the CAE a duty exemption of USD
1,008,614, for the replacement turbine. Having received no response, it filed a second
request before the Ministry of Finance on 24 March 1999. On 14 May 1999, the latter
replied that as a consequence of the entry into force of the Customs Law, this was a
matter to be resolved by the CAE, thus declining to deal with the duty exemption
request.

One month later, on 17 June 1999, the CAE denied the duty exemption requested by
Electroquil.

In November 2001, Electroquil then filed a claim before the Ecuadorian district tax court
on the grounds of denial of duty exemption. This claim was dismissed on 28 January
2004 (R. Exh. 125 and R. Exh. 126). Electroquil appealed this decision before the
Ecuadorian Supreme Court (R. Exh. 127) on 5 March 2004.

The Ecuadorian Supreme Court declared Electroquil’s appeal admissible on 15 July
2004. A hearing was scheduled for 27 January 2005, which Electroquil did not attend
(R. Exh. 128).

In April 2005, the President of Ecuador dismissed all justices on the Ecuadorian
Supreme Court. The Supreme Court was re-established on 30 November 2005. The

parties have not rendered evidence as to any later events in this respect.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

INITIAL PHASE

On 25 August 2004, Duke submitted its Request for Arbitration to ICSID accompanied
by 48 exhibits (Exh. C-1 to C-48).

On 30 August 2004, the Centre, in accordance with Rule 5 of the ICSID Rules of
Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (“Institution
Rules”), acknowledged receipt and transmitted a copy of the Request for Arbitration to
Ecuador and to the Ecuadorian Embassy in Washington D.C.

On 7 October 2004, the Secretary General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration and notified the parties of the registration in accordance with Rules 6 and 7
of the Institution Rules. The Secretary General further invited the parties to proceed to
the constitution of an Arbitral Tribunal.

In the absence of an agreement between the parties, on 9 December 2004, Duke
elected to submit the arbitration to a panel of three arbitrators pursuant to Article
37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention and appointed Dr. Enrique Gomez Pinzon, a national
of Colombia, as arbitrator. On 10 January 2005, Ecuador appointed Prof. Albert Jan
van den Berg, a national of the Netherlands, as arbitrator. On 4 May 2005, the parties
agreed to appoint Prof. Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland, as the

President of the Tribunal

In accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration
Proceedings (“Arbitration Rules”), the Secretary General of ICSID notified the parties,
on 18 May 2005, that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the
Tribunal was therefore deemed to be constituted and the proceedings to have begun
on that date. The same letter informed the parties that Mr. José Antonio Rivas, ICSID
Counsel, would serve as Secretary to the Tribunal. By letter of 27 December 2005 from
the Centre, the Tribunal was informed that Mr. Gonzalo Flores, ICSID Senior counsel,

would replace Mr. Rivas as the Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Arbitral Tribunal and the parties held the first session of the Arbitral Tribunal at the
seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C., on 15 June 2005. During the first session, the
parties in particular agreed to the constitution of the Tribunal and to the application of
the Arbitration Rules which came into force on 1 January 2003, and of certain
additional procedural rules. The Minutes of the First Session further provided for two

alternative procedural timetables depending on whether jurisdictional objections were

19

80.

81.

82.

83.

84.

raised by the Respondent. In the event that jurisdictional objections were raised, the
timetable provided for further alternatives depending on whether the proceedings on
jurisdiction and on the merits would be joined. It was also specified that the language of
the proceedings would be English and Spanish and that the Tribunal would render its

decision and award in both languages.

PRE-HEARING WRITTEN PHASE

In accordance with the timetable agreed on during the first session and revised upon
the parties’ request on 9 January 2006, the parties filed the following written briefs with

accompanying submissions.

On 2 September 2005, the Claimants submitted their Memorial in Chief accompanied
by supporting documents (Cl. Exh. 001-117), as well as the witness statements of
Messrs. Gustavo Larrea Real, Mickey John Peters, John Theodore Sickman, Ramiro
Tumbaco, Dr. Jacinto Velazquez Herrera, Dr. Santiago Velazquez Coello, and the
expert reports of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek, Prof. Dr. Rudolf Dolzer, Dr. Juan Larrea
Holguin and Dr. Alejandro Ponce Martinez.

The Respondent informed the Tribunal by a letter of 1 November 2005 that it would
raise objections to jurisdiction that could be joined to the merits. On 2 November 2005,
the Arbitral Tribunal thus confirmed that the objections to jurisdiction would be joined to
the merits and that the timetable provided in the Minutes of the first session for such

situation would be followed.

On 22 November 2005, the Respondent filed its Answer to the Memorial in Chief
accompanied by supporting documents (R. Exh. 001-115) and legal authorities (R.
Exh. D-001-075), as well as the witness statements of Messrs. Hernan Salgado
Pesantes, Galo Garcia Feraud, Walter Spurrier Baquerizo, Edgar Santos Jativa and
Ms. Ximena Cardenas Yandun, and the expert reports of Messrs. Nico Schrijver, Luis

Parraguez Ruiz, Juan Pablo Aguilar, Alfredo Mancero Saman.

On 18 January 2006, the Claimants submitted their Reply Memorial and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction accompanied by Exhibit 118, the witness statement of
Mr. Wilson Vergara, the rebuttal witness statements of Messrs. Gustavo Larrea Real
and Ramiro Tumbaco, and the rebuttal expert reports of Mr. Brent C. Kaczmarek,

Prof. Dr. Rudolf Dolzer, Dr. Juan Larrea Holguin and Dr. Alejandro Ponce Martinez.

The Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO 1”) on 24 February 2006,
denying the Respondent's request of 6 February 2006 regarding the alleged broad
scope of the Claimant's rejoinder.

On 6 March 2006, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Rejoinder on the
Merits accompanied by supporting documents (R. Exh. 116-124) and legal authorities
(R. Exh. D-076-097), as well as the witness statements of Messrs. Pablo Teran
Ribadeneira, Ratl Baca Carbo, Fidel Jaramillo, the rebuttal witness statements of
Messrs Edgar Santos Jativa and Ms. Ximena Cardenas Yandun, and the rebuttal
expert reports of Messrs. Nico Schrijver, Luis Parraguez Ruiz, Juan Pablo Aguilar,
Alfredo Mancero Saman. On 6 March 2006, the Secretary of the Tribunal informed the
Arbitral Tribunal and the parties that it was distributing a written statement submitted by
Dr. Viadimiro Alvarez Grau.

On 14 March 2006, the President of the Arbitral Tribunal and the parties held a pre-
hearing telephone conference pursuant to Article 12 of the Minutes of the first session,
in order to discuss any outstanding organizational matters. Decisions made during the
pre-hearing telephone conference were restated in Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO 2”) of
23 March 2006.

On 31 March 2006, the parties simultaneously exchanged their lists of witnesses and
experts for the hearing.

On that same date, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, together with
supporting documents (Cl. Exh. 119) and the rebuttal expert opinion of Prof. Dr. Rudolf
Dolzer.

HEARING

The Arbitral Tribunal and the parties held the hearing on jurisdiction and the merits
from 24 to 27 April 2006 at the seat of the Centre in Washington, D.C.

The following witnesses and experts testified on behalf of Duke at the hearing:

An audio-recording and a verbatim transcript of the hearing were made and later
distributed to the Tribunal and the parties (‘Tr.”).

POST-HEARING WRITTEN PHASE

On 4 May 2006, the Arbitral Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 (“PO 3”) in which it
confirmed and supplemented the decision made at the end of the hearing. Specifically,
it granted both parties time limits for their post-hearing briefs and, without limiting the
parties’ freedom to put forward any aspect deemed appropriate, it invited the parties to

address certain specific matters.

On 30 June 2006, the parties simultaneously submitted their First Post-Hearing Brief

and their submissions on costs.

On 21 July 2006, the parties simultaneously submitted their Second Post-Hearing Brief

and further submissions on costs.

On 30 August 2007, counsel for the Claimants submitted a letter to the Centre, calling
the Tribunal’s attention to certain “new facts.” By email of 31 August 2007, counsel for
the Respondent requested the ICSID Secretariat not to transmit the above letter to the
Tribunal “until the parties have been heard on the question of further submissions on
points of fact and law.” By letter of 4 October 2007, the Secretary, acting on behalf of
the Tribunal, invited the parties to state their position on this matter and informed them

that the Tribunal was close to completing its task and to communicating its findings to

22

101.

the parties. By letter of 12 October 2007, the Claimants withdrew their letter of 30
August 2007.

On 11 June 2008, the Tribunal declared the proceedings closed pursuant to Rule 38(1)

of the Arbitration Rules.

PARTIES’ POSITIONS

The positions of the parties are summarized in this Chapter and will be further
elaborated upon in the Chapter entitled “Analysis” as and when a specific issue is
reviewed.

PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON JURISDICTION

The Claimants invoke the ICSID arbitration provision contained in the Arbitration
Agreement and alternatively Article VI of the “Agreement between the United States of
America and the Republic of Ecuador Concerning the Reciprocal Promotion and
Protection of Investments”, dated 27 August 1993 (the “BIT” or “Treaty”), which entered
into force on 11 May 1997 (Exh. C-48 RforA and Cl. Exh. 003) to support their

complaint regarding the following conduct of the Respondent:

(i) late and inappropriate implementation of the Payment Trusts;
(ii) non-payment of interest on late payments;

(iii) wrongful imposition of fines and penalties;

(iv) disregard of customs duties application; and

(v) _ failure to entertain the Claimants’ suits under local arbitration.
Ecuador’s objections to jurisdiction

Ecuador acknowledges the Tribunal’s jurisdiction for disputes regarding fines and
penalties pursuant to the Arbitration Agreement but objects to the Tribunal having
jurisdiction over claims relating to the Payment Trusts, interest on late payments and

customs duties. Ecuador’s argument can be summarized as follows:

The scope of the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, as defined in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the
Arbitration Agreement, does not cover claims regarding the Payment Trusts, interest on
late payments and customs duties.

23

102.

103.

24

104.

The Claimants cannot bring additional claims before the Arbitral Tribunal pursuant to
the BIT. The parties have agreed that the present proceedings would be based
exclusively on the Arbitration Agreement. Therefore, failing express consent by the
parties to proceed otherwise, Treaty claims cannot be combined with claims arising out

of the Arbitration Agreement.
Duke’s response to Ecuador’s objections to jurisdiction

In response to Ecuador's objections, the Claimants put the following arguments

forward:

(i) The Arbitration Agreement, at paragraphs 2 and 3, extends the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction over all of the claims.

(ii) In the event that the Tribunal were to consider that its jurisdiction does not extend
to matters of Payment Trusts, interest on late payments and customs duties
under the Arbitration Agreement, the BIT provides a parallel basis for jurisdiction
and the Claimants would thus be entitled to submit these three claims pursuant to
the BIT. Neither the Arbitration Agreement nor the ICSID Convention prevent
parties from combining their claims in a single arbitration. The Arbitration
Agreement was not meant as a waiver of the Claimants’ right to pursue any

potential claims under the BIT.

PARTIES’ POSITIONS ON THE MERITS

Duke’s position

2.1.1. Duke’s arguments

Duke has made the following main contentions:

(i) | Ecuador failed to meet its obligation to establish the Payment Trusts prior to
commercial operation. It has generally breached the payment regime of the PPAs
by not complying with the calendar and manner of performing payments —
including poor implementation of the Payment Trusts — and with the penalty
regime, by assessing fines both without justification and in violation of the agreed
time frames. It has also breached the customs duties regime of the PPAs in

violation of the PPAs, Ecuadorian law and its general obligation of good faith.

(ii) Article II(3)(c) of the BIT constitutes an umbrella clause, which entails that

Ecuador is bound to observe any and all obligations — including contractual ones

24

— with regard to the investment and, namely, its payment obligations and the

penalty and customs duties regimes under the PPAs.

(iii) Ecuador has failed to treat Duke’s investment fairly and equitably pursuant to
Article 11(3)(a) of the BIT.

(iv) Ecuador has breached Article II(3)(b) of the BIT and impaired the Claimants’

investment by arbitrary conduct.

(v) Ecuador has failed to provide the Claimants with effective means of asserting
claims and enforcing rights with respect to their investment, in violation of Article

\l(7) of the BIT, which amounts to a denial of justice.

105. As a result, the Claimants request the Tribunal to declare that Ecuador has breached
the PPAs, the Payment Trust Agreements, Ecuadorian law and the BIT and that they
are therefore entitled to damages for the impairment of their investment and the losses

suffered by Electroquil.
2.1.2 Duke’s prayers for relief
106. In their Reply, the Claimants request the following relief:

Claimants hereby respectfully request the following relief, which reflects,
inter alia, supplemental damage calculations performed since the time of
Claimants’ initial filing:

1. a. The amount of US$ 24,720,904, representing Electroquil’s damages
as a result of Ecuador's unlawful conduct. This amount includes
interest, compounded annually, through December 31, 2005. See
Table 2 to Expert Reply Report of Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA

b. In the alternative to the amount stated in (1)(a), the amount of US$
19,263,434, representing the impairment to the value of DEI'’s
investment in Electroquil as a result of Ecuador's unlawful conduct.
This amount includes interest, compounded annually, through
December 31, 2005. See paragraph 67 to Expert Report of Brent C.
Kaczmarek, CFA

2. The amount of US$ 358,954, representing the damages incurred
based on Ecuador's denial of justice, measured by the costs incurred
in arbitration in Guayaquil. This amount includes _ interest,
compounded annually, through December 31, 2005. See Table 5 to
Expert Reply Report of Brent C. Kaczmarek, CFA

3. All costs and attorneys’ fees associated with this arbitration

4. Post-December 31, 2005 pre-award and post-award interest, as
appropriate in light of the other items of relief requested, at the highest
lawful rate

5. Such other and further relief as the Tribunal may deem appropriate

(Cl. Reply, pp. 121-122)

25

107. In their 1*t PHB, the Claimants make the following final request:

Claimants respectfully request that their claims be heard in their entirety, that
their requested relief be granted, that they be awarded interest at the
applicable rate until the time of payment, that all costs and attorneys’ fees
associated with this arbitration be awarded against Respondent, and that the
Tribunal award such other and further relief as the Tribunal may deem
appropriate.

(Cl. 1% PHB, p. 121)

2.2 Ecuador's position on the merits
2.2.1. Ecuador’s arguments
108. In its written and oral submissions, Ecuador has raised the following main contentions:

(i) | The facts of the case do not establish any violation of the Payment Trusts, of the

PPAs, nor more generally, any violation of Ecuadorian Law or the BIT.

(ii) The scope of the umbrella clause in Article II(3)(c) of the BIT does not cover
Ecuador's conduct in the present case, as such a provision requires that the host
State breach its obligations in its sovereign capacity. At any rate, Ecuador denies
any breach of its obligations under the PPAs, whether with respect to payment or

fines, and in relation to customs duties.

(iii) Ecuador has not violated its obligation to provide fair and equitable treatment
guaranteed in Article II(3)(a) of the BIT. This obligation cannot be extended
beyond the standards provided by customary international law; it does not protect
the investor from commercial risk.

(iv) Ecuador denies any discriminatory or arbitrary conduct within the meaning of
Article 11(3)(b) of the BIT.

(v) Ecuador has not violated its duty to provide an adequate and impartial dispute
resolution forum as set forth in Article II(7) of the BIT.

(vi) Duke is not entitled to any damages for the impairment of its investment.
2.2.2 Ecuador’s prayers for relief

On the basis of the evidence submitted throughout this proceeding, the

Republic of Ecuador ratifies its request to the Tribunal:

a) To uphold the objections to jurisdiction, limiting its ruling on the merits
to the dispute over the fines;

113.

114.

b) To reject the Claimants’ request for reimbursement of the value of the
fines with their respective interest, as it is a purely contractual matter
over which no conduct from the Republic of Ecuador that can be
considered in breach of the BIT has been proven; and

c) To order the Claimants to pay the costs and expenses associated to
this proceeding, for having advanced a frivolous claim. In no other
way can be qualified the attempt to bring before the Tribunal matters
that clearly fall outside the scope defined by the Arbitration
Agreement, with the obvious purpose of increasing the value of a
claim that should have been brought before the courts envisaged in
the contract.

(R. 2" PHB, § 137, Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation)
ANALYSIS

Before turning to the analysis of the jurisdiction (2), the applicable law (3), and of the
merits (4), the Tribunal wishes to briefly address certain preliminary matters (1).

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS

. The Tribunal is faced with two complex issues: first, the potential combination of two

different bases for ICSID jurisdiction: the Arbitration Agreement and the BIT, and
secondly, the dual invocation of the BIT as a basis for jurisdiction and as the applicable
law under the Arbitration Agreement.

The Claimants invoke the Arbitration Agreement as the primary basis for the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction. Only as an alternative option — in the event of lack of jurisdiction under the
Arbitration Agreement — they rely on the BIT for the rest of their claims. They have not
invoked the BIT as a general basis for jurisdiction, nor has it been discussed as such

by the parties.

In addition, in their Memorial in chief, the Claimants initially distinguished between
violations of the PPAs and Ecuadorian law on the one hand, and violations of the BIT
on the other. In their subsequent submissions, however, they focused on violations of
the BIT, while stating in general terms, in a footnote in their first PHB, that they did not

waive prior arguments.

While the Respondent opposes the invocation of the BIT as a basis for jurisdiction, it
expressly acknowledges the application of the BIT as part of the “substantive
framework” of the disputes covered by the Arbitration Agreement. It insists, however,

that the principal source of law be, in any event, Ecuadorian Law.

27

115.

116.

117.

118.

119.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will first determine the proper basis for its jurisdiction (2) and
the applicable law (3). It will then proceed to examine the Claimants’ claims in light of
the contractual provisions and Ecuadorian law (4.1), to then determine whether
Ecuador’s conduct breached the BIT (4.2). Finally the Tribunal will analyze the
arguments regarding damages and decide whether the Claimants are entitled to
compensation.

Before turning to its analysis, the Tribunal would like to comment on the relevance it
will accord to ICSID precedents in this case since both parties have relied extensively
on previous ICSID decisions and awards in support of their position, either to conclude
that the same solution should be adopted in the present case or in an effort to explain
why this Tribunal should depart from that solution.

While the Tribunal considers that it is not bound by previous decisions, it is of the
opinion that it must pay due consideration to earlier decisions made by other
international tribunals. It believes that, subject to compelling contrary grounds, it has a
duty to consider the solutions consistently established in prior similar cases. Subject to
the specifics of a given treaty and of the circumstances of the case under review, it has
a duty to seek to contribute to the harmonious development of investment law, and
thereby to meet the legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors
towards establishing certainty in the rule of law’.

JURISDICTION

There is no dispute as to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal to decide the jurisdictional
challenges raised by Ecuador (Art. 41 of the ICSID Convention). The issue of
jurisdiction has been joined to the merits of the dispute with the result that the Tribunal
will deal with it as a preliminary matter within the present award (Art. 41(2) of the ICSID
Convention).

Given that the principal basis for jurisdiction invoked by the Claimants is the Arbitration
Agreement, the Tribunal will analyze its jurisdiction under the agreement and will
determine which of the claims are encompassed by it (2.1.1). Having done so, it will
proceed to verify whether the conditions imposed by the ICSID Convention are fulfilled
with regard to these claims (2.1.2). The Tribunal will subsequently examine whether the

Claimants can rely upon the BIT as an additional basis for jurisdiction for the claims not

covered by the Arbitration Agreement (if any) and, in the affirmative, whether the

requirements for jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention and the BIT are met (2.2).

Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the Arbitration Agreement

The Arbitration Agreement (CI. Exh. 025) contains the following relevant provisions:

2.

If the Parties fail to reach an agreement within 70 days, as provided in
Item 1, following the date this Agreement is signed, the RDE and the
Investors agree to submit the differences described in Item 3 of this

pursuant to the 1965 Convention on the Settlement of Investment
Disputes Between States and Nationals of Other States (“ICSID
Convention’) and the Treaty between the United States of America
and the Republic of Ecuador on Promotion and Protection of
Investments signed on August 27, 1993, in effect since May 11, 1997
(the “Treaty’).

The forowing a differences are defined as the ‘aifferences related to or

a)

Differences regarding Investment. (Emphasis added, Spanish original,
English translation provided by the Claimants)

The scope of the Arbitration Agreement

Definition of the issue

As noted above, the Claimants object to the following conduct of the Respondent:

(i) late constitution and poor implementation of Payment Trusts; (ii) non-payment of

interest on late payments; (iii) wrongful imposition of fines and penalties; (iv) disregard

of customs duties application; and (v) failure to entertain the claims made in the local

arbitration. The Respondent contends that the only basis for jurisdiction is the

Arbitration Agreement and that it only covers claims relating to fines and penalties.

The Tribunal must establish whether it has jurisdiction to consider all of the Claimants’

claims. In order to do so, it must first determine the scope of the Arbitration Agreement:

Does it cover only claims relating to fines and penalties and, if so, which claims relate

to fines and penalties?

The starting point for its analysis are the relevant clauses 2 and 3 of the Arbitration

Agreement, mentioned above, that read:

2.

If the Parties fail to reach an agreement within 70 days, as provided in
Item 1, following the date this Agreement is signed, the RDE and the
Investors agree to submit the differences described in Item 3 of
this ii to the Center for of I

(the “Treaty’).

127.

b) Parties’ positions

It is the Respondent's view that the phrase “originating from or in connection with”
contained in paragraph 3 of the Arbitration Agreement must be interpreted restrictively
and relates only to the claims for fines and penalties. Neither the claim for customs
duties nor the claim for interest on late payments relate to fines and penalties. The
former has been awaiting a decision of the Ecuadorian Supreme Court since March
2004, meaning a contrario, that it was not covered by the Arbitration Agreement
entered into in April 2004 (Counsel for the Respondent, Tr. pp. 98-100). The
Respondent finds support in Electroquil’s letter of 26 April 2004, which it reads as
confirmation that the parties intended to exclude such claims from the scope of the
Arbitration Agreement.

By contrast, the Claimants argue that the Arbitration Agreement should receive a broad
interpretation and that the parties had intended to arbitrate the entirety of their disputes
before an ICSID tribunal. The phrase “any and all claims, controversies, complaints
and causes of action arising out of or in connection with” is the result of due
consideration and negotiation. It was included to ensure that any differences could be
submitted to an ICSID tribunal. In this respect, the Claimants evoke the same letter of
26 April 2004 from Electroquil to the Ecuadorian Government, in which they state that
their understanding of the Agreement was disclosed to Ecuador at the time the
Arbitration Agreement was entered into. In addition, the Claimants allege that
Mr. Larrea, Electroquil’s Executive President, explicitly required that the words “matter

and/or agreement’ be added to the wording of paragraph 3.

The Claimants insist further that claims for interest on late payments are connected
with the claims related to fines and penalties, as Ecuador improperly used fines and
penalties to offset Ecuador's outstanding payment obligations. The Claimants have
never waived their rights nor released their claims regarding delayed payment interest.
Similarly, customs duties were paid in connection with the importation of a turbine,

which was needed to implement the PPAs.
c) Tribunal’s determination

In view of the parties’ divergences as to the scope of the relevant provisions of the
Arbitration Agreement, the Tribunal first needs to determine the applicable principles
for their interpretation (i). On the basis of its findings, it will then proceed to interpret
these provisions (ii).

(i) Principles governing the interpretation of the Arbitration Agreement

The parties have specified in paragraph 9 of the Arbitration Agreement that “fajny issue
concerning the validity, efficacy, construction, scope or interpretation of this [Arbitration]
Agreement shall be decided by the Tribunal in accordance with International Law’.

Must consent to arbitration be interpreted restrictively, as the Respondent claims, or
broadly, as the Claimants submit? Numerous decisions — ranging from Holiday Inns v.
Morocco to Tradex v. Albania, including Amco v. Indonesia, SOABI v. Senegal and
SPP v. Egypt, to which Ecuador refers — have insisted on the need to interpret the real
intentions of the parties in light of the circumstances and have refused to consider

sovereignty as a factor limiting a State’s consent to arbitrate.

Without addressing the details of these decisions, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the
middle ground approach advocated in SPP v. Egypt is appropriate when interpreting a
State’s consent to ICSID jurisdiction:

, are to be rp neither nor
expansively, but rather objectively and in good faith, and jurisdiction will be
found to exist if — but only if — the force of the arguments militating in favor of
it is preponderant’.

This middle ground approach is echoed by other ICSID Tribunals, such as the tribunal
for CSOB v. The Slovak Republic’:

[ln determining how to interpret agreements to arbitrate under the ICSID
Convention, the Tribunal is guided by an ICSID decision [Amco v. Indonesia]
which held that ‘a convention to arbitrate is not to be construed restrictively,
nor, as a matter of fact, broadly or liberally. It is to be construed in a way
which leads to find out and to respect the common will of the parties [...]
Moreover [...] any convention, including conventions to arbitrate should be
construed in good faith, that is to say by taking into account the
consequences of the commitments the parties may be considered as having
reasonably and legitimately envisaged’. (footnote omitted)

In ascertaining the parties’ real intentions, a tribunal looks inter alia to the expectations
of the parties in light of the agreement seen as a whole’. The importance of the parties’

135.

reasonable and legitimate expectations in interpreting arbitration agreements has, for

instance, been emphasized in SOABI v. Senegal’:

In other words, the interpretation must take into account the consequences
which the parties must reasonably and legitimately be considered to have
envisaged as flowing from their undertakings. It is this principle of
interpretation, rather than one of a priori strict, or, for that matter, broad and
liberal construction, that the Tribunal has chosen to apply.

(ii) Interpretation of the relevant provisions of the Arbitration Agreement

Having identified the relevant principles of interpretation under the applicable
international law, the Tribunal will now examine whether the parties’ intent, expressed
in paragraph 3 of the Arbitration Agreement, was to submit all of the claims at stake to
ICSID arbitration.

In order to establish their intent, the parties have taken recourse to contemporary
documents relating to the Agreement. Two of these documents appear to be of
particular relevance. First, the authorization of the Attorney-General to sign the
Arbitration Agreement dated 26 April 2004, which is attached to the Agreement as
“supporting documentation” (in the Claimants’ translation) or “documentos habilitantes”
in the original Spanish version. In his authorization, the Attorney-General states that
“[...] the State Attorney General authorizes submitting the dispute, related exclusively
to fines or penalties arising from the execution of the mentioned contracts, to
international arbitration” (Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation). As a “documento
habilitante”, this authorization sets the limits on the State’s consent to arbitration. It is
therefore clear that the State did not intend to give its consent to arbitrate disputes
other than those related to fines and penalties.

Second, the Claimants invoke a letter from Mr. Larrea, Executive President of
Electroquil, to the Minister of Energy and Mines of the same day as the Attorney-
General's authorization, i.e. 26 April 2004, which is also the date of the execution of the
Arbitration Agreement. On such date, Mr. Larrea wrote to the MEM regarding the
amendments to be made to the draft Arbitration Agreement that had been submitted to
Electroquil (Cl. Exh. 118). The pertinent parts of this letter read as follows:

The following disputes are defined as the “disputes related to or arising from
an investment” for the purposes of this Agreement, the consent of the
Parties established in Paragraph 2, the ICSID Convention, and the Treaty:
Any and all claims, controversies, demands and causes of action arising
from or in connection with (i) the fines and penalties imposed by the RDE
based on the Power Purchase Agreement entered into on October 31, 1995

with ELECTROQUIL S.A. (PPA 95), and any interest thereon and any other
matter and/or agreement related to such items, (ii) the fines and penalties
imposed by the RDE under the Power Purchase Agreement entered into on
August 8, 1996 with ELECTROQUIL S.A. (PPA 96), and any interest thereon
and any other matter and/or agreement related to these items.

[Led

In addition to the foregoing, and independently thereof, Duke notes for the

record that the exclusion in Paragraph 3 of the Agreement proposed by the

Government of any reference to the subject of customs duties payable for

the importation of the turbines as well as any other matter related to the

investors’ business operation in Ecuador, may not be interpreted as either

an agreement or acquiescence by Duke or its subsidiary ELECTROQUIL to

the effect that any dispute related to such subjects is not arbitrable.

(Emphasis added, English version provided by the Claimants)
Electroquil’s addition of the words “and/or agreement’ just quoted features in the final
executed version of the Arbitration Agreement. The Claimants argue that Electroquil
made this addition specifically to ensure that the Liquidation Agreements and the Med-
Arb Agreements would be covered (Cl. Mem., § 56). In his witness statement,
Mr. Larrea also explains that the second paragraph of his letter of 26 April 2004
concerning customs duties insisted for such claims to become subject to the same

arbitration (WS, § 81).

The Tribunal cannot follow these arguments. First, they run contrary to the clear
wording of the letter of the Attorney-General of the same date. Second, they are
inconsistent with the Tribunal’s understanding of the second paragraph of Mr. Larrea’s
letter. Indeed, it understands this passage to mean that, while Duke accepted that
claims for customs duties would not be covered by the Arbitration Agreement, it did not
acknowledge that they may not be submitted to arbitration at all. As a result, the
Tribunal interprets the parties' intent to be that the Arbitration Agreement covers only
claims relating to fines and penalties.

This said, the language referring to “fines and penalties” is broad. Terms such as “any
and all claims, controversies, complaints, and causes originating from or in connection
with” as well as “any other matter and/or agreement related to said concerns appear to
include a wide range of claims, provided these claims relate to “fines and penalties”.
The Tribunal must thus determine whether the claims regarding late payment, the
Payment Trusts, the Med-Arb Agreements, and the customs duties are covered by the
Arbitration Agreement because they bear a connection with fines and penalties and/or

any agreement related to these items.

First, the Tribunal considers that the late payment of Electroquil's invoices was indeed
connected with the imposition and disbursement of penalties. In this context, it notes

the Claimants’ contentions that Ecuador improperly used the fines and penalties to

34

140.

141.

142.

143.

offset Ecuador's outstanding payment obligations, that only 37 out of 122 invoices
issued by Electroquil were paid within 30 days, and that, in any event, payment rarely
covered the entire invoiced amount (1% ER Kaczmarek, §§ 49 and 50). More
importantly, it observes that the 96 Liquidation Agreement refers to the “fines deducted
from the amounts invoiced by Electroquil’ (Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation).
Similarly, the opinion of the attorney of the MEM on the Arbitration Agreement states
that fines of USD 7,982,187 were imposed on Electroquil and that this amount was
“deducted from Electroquil’s outstanding invoices” (R. Exh. 117, Spanish original,
Tribunal’s translation).

Second, the Tribunal turns to the connection between the fines and the Payment
Trusts. The Claimants argue that Fines No. 1 and No. 2 were unfairly imposed as the
delay in starting the units was caused by the late establishment of the Payment Trusts.
To this extent, there is a relation between the claims regarding the establishment of the
Payment Trusts and the fines. The same is not true with respect to the implementation
of the payment guarantee, which the Claimants also allege to have been violated.
Indeed, none of the fines shows a link to the implementation of the Payment Trusts.
Therefore, the Tribunal is of the opinion that, in accordance with the parties’ intent, it
has jurisdiction under the Arbitration Agreement over any claim in connection with the
establishment of the Payment Trusts but not their implementation. It will review below

whether it has jurisdiction over such latter claims on the basis of the BIT.

Third, the Tribunal finds that the Med-Arb Agreements were directly related to fines and
penalties. They were the initial recourse used by the Claimants to settle the disputes
concerning fines levied from 1996 to 1998 (i.e. fines Nos. 1 to 7). This is recognized in
the 95 and 96 Liquidation Agreements and further acknowledged by the Respondent in
its Reply: “The proper understanding is that there must be a direct relationship with the
fines [footnote omitted], as is the case of the claims submitted to local arbitration” (R.
Reply, 33, Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation).

By contrast, the Tribunal does not see any connection between the customs duties and
the fines and penalties. The customs duties are connected with the imposition of taxes;
they are not related to any contractual mechanisms for the imposition of fines and
penalties.

On the basis of these considerations, the Tribunal considers that it has jurisdiction
under the Arbitration Agreement to decide over the claims presented in this arbitration,
except those relating to the implementation of the Payment Trusts and to the customs

duties.

35

144.

145.

146.

147.

148.

149.

The Tribunal must now consider whether the requirements of the ICSID Convention are
met in connection with the claims for which it has jurisdiction under the Arbitration
Agreement (2.1.2). It will subsequently determine whether it has jurisdiction over the
claims regarding the implementation of the Payment Trusts and the customs duties on
the basis of the BIT since the Claimants have relied upon the Treaty in the event that
the Tribunal denies jurisdiction under the Arbitration Agreement (2.2).

2.1.2 _ ICSID jurisdictional requirements

The jurisdictional requirements are set forth in Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention in

the following terms:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising directly

out of an investment between a Contracting State (or any constituent

subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by

that State) and a national of another Contracting State, which the parties to

the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre. When the parties have

given their consent, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.
Ecuador does not challenge the fact that (i) the disputes regarding fines and penalties
are of a legal nature; (ii) they arise directly out of an investment; (iii) they exist between
a contracting State and a national of another contracting State; and (iv) they have been
submitted in writing to ICSID arbitration within the meaning of Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention (R. Answer, § 48). Moreover, the Tribunal assesses that, in paragraph 4 of
the Arbitration Agreement, the parties agree that they would not challenge the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the disputes described in its paragraph 3.

The Tribunal notes, in particular, that the parties have agreed, in paragraph 5 of the
Arbitration Agreement, that the Claimants would be treated as nationals of the United
States of America. It further observes that, at the time of the Arbitration Agreement,
there was no doubt that Electroquil was under foreign control and thereby meeting the

requirement established by Article 25(2)(b) of the Washington Convention.

The Arbitration Agreement also specifies, in paragraph 5, that the PPAs and the
interest which Duke Energy Electroquil holds in Electroquil constitute an investment for
the purpose of the ICSID Convention. Hence, the Tribunal will assume here that, for
the purposes of the ICSID Convention, both Duke Energy and Electroquil have an

investment.

The Tribunal is therefore satisfied that the requirements of Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention are met with respect to the disputes regarding fines and penalties which
include:

36

2.2

150.

151.

152.

- claims regarding the establishment of the Payment Trusts;
- claims for interest on late payments of Electroquil’s invoices;
- claims for fines and penalties stricto sensu; and

- the claim regarding the Med-Arb Agreements.

Alternative jurisdiction under the BIT

The Claimants have invoked the BIT as an additional basis for jurisdiction should
certain claims not be covered by the Arbitration Agreement. The Tribunal will now
consider whether the BIT can in fact be invoked in the present case.

2.2.1 Parties’ positions

The Respondent raises three fundamental objections to the Claimants’ invocation of
the BIT. First, it contends that treaty claims cannot be combined with claims arising out
of the Arbitration Agreement. In its view, the Claimants cannot bring claims under the
BIT in these proceedings because (i) they failed to invoke such basis in their Request
for Arbitration; and (ii) the terms of the Agreement expressly exclude the possibility of
cumulating contract-based proceedings with arbitration based on the BIT. Second, the
Respondent alleges that customs duties, in any event, relate to tax matters that are
outside the scope of the BIT pursuant to Article X(2)(c). Finally, it argues that the
Claimants have not met the jurisdictional and procedural requirements under the BIT
and the ICSID Convention.

To defend their claim for alternative jurisdiction under the BIT, the Claimants argue first
that they had expressed their consent under the BIT in their Counter-Memorial (Cl.
Reply, § 99) and that claims would, in any event, be admissible as ancillary claims
under Article 46 of the ICSID Convention and Arbitration Rule 40. In addition, they
assert that nothing in the Arbitration Agreement or the ICSID Convention limits the
number of instruments by which consent can be expressed, the sole requirement being
that consent be “in writing”. Second, the Claimants deny that they request the review of
a matter of taxation within the meaning of Article X(2)(c) of the Treaty and state that,
even if it were the case, claims for customs duties would fall within the exceptions of
Article X(2). Finally, the Claimants submit that the jurisdictional and procedural
requirements under both the ICSID Convention and the BIT are met.

37

2.2.2 Tribunal’s determination

153. The Tribunal must first address whether the Claimants properly invoked the BIT (a). It
must then consider whether it can assert jurisdiction both under the Arbitration
Agreement and the Treaty (b). Finally, the Tribunal must determine whether the claims
regarding the implementation of the Payment Trusts and customs duties fall within the
scope of the BIT dispute resolution mechanism and, if so, whether the requirements for
jurisdiction under the Treaty and the ICSID Convention are met (c to e).

154. Article VI of the BIT reads as follows:

1. For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a
Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out of or relating to
(a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or company;
(6) an investment authorization granted by that Party's foreign investment
authority to such national or company; or (c) an alleged breach of any right
conferred or created by this Treaty with respect to an investment.

2. In the event of an investment dispute, the parties to the dispute should initially
seek a resolution through consultation and negotiation. If the dispute cannot be
settled amicably, the national or company concerned may choose to submit the
dispute, under one of the following alternatives, for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Party that is a party to the
dispute; or

 

(b) in with any pl ly agreed dispute
procedures; or

(c) in accordance with the terms of paragraph 3.

3. (a) Provided that the national or company concerned has not submitted the
dispute for resolution under paragraph 2 (a) or (b) and that six months have
elapsed from the date on which the dispute arose, the national or company
concerned may choose to consent in writing to the submission of the dispute for
settlement by binding arbitration:
(i) to the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes
("Centre") the ic of Ii
Disputes between States and Nationals of other States, done at
Washington, March 18, 1965 ("ICSID convention"), provided that the Party
is a party to such Convention; or

 

(ii) to the Additional Facility of the Centre, if the Centre is not available; or

(iii) in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or

(iv) to any other arbitration institution, or in accordance with any other
arbitration rules, as may be mutually agreed between the parties to the
dispute.

(b) once the national or company concerned has so consented, either party to
the dispute may initiate arbitration in accordance with the choice so specified in
the consent.

4. Each Party hereby consents to the submission of any investment dispute for
settlement by binding arbitration in accordance with the choice specified in the
written consent of the national or company under paragraph 3. Such consent,
together with the written consent of the national or company when given under
paragraph 3 shall satisfy the requirement for:

(a) written consent of the parties to the dispute for Purposes of Chapter II of
the ICSID Convention (Jurisdiction of the Centre) and for purposes of the
Additional Facility Rules; and

(b) an "agreement in writing" for purposes of Article II of the United Nations
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral
Awards, done at New York, June 10, 1958 (“New York Convention").

5. Any arbitration under paragraph 3(a) (ii), (iii) or (iv) of this Article shall be held
in a state that is a party to the New York Convention.

6. Any arbitral award rendered pursuant to this Article shall be final and binding
on the parties to the dispute. Each Party undertakes to carry out without delay
the provisions of any such award and to provide in its territory for its
enforcement.

7. In any proceeding involving an investment dispute, a Party shall not assert, as
a defense, counterclaim, right of set-off or otherwise, that the national or
company concerned has received or will receive, pursuant to an insurance or
guarantee contract, indemnification or other compensation for all or part of its
alleged damages.

8. For purposes of an arbitration held under paragraph 3 of this Article, any
company legally constituted under the applicable laws and regulations of a Party
or a political subdivision thereof that, immediately before the occurrence of the
event or events giving rise to the dispute, was an investment of nationals or
companies of the other Party, shall be treated as a national or company of such
other Party in accordance with Article 25 (2) (b) of the ICSID Convention.

a) The late invocation of the BIT

The Tribunal believes that the fact that the Claimants had not invoked the BIT as basis
for jurisdiction until their Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction should not preclude them
from relying upon it and agrees with the Claimants that holding otherwise would be
excessively formalistic. Indeed, the Claimants have since invoked the BIT as an
alternative basis for jurisdiction in response to the Respondent’s objections. The
Claimants cannot be considered to have waived this basis for jurisdiction by not
mentioning it in their Request for Arbitration given that there would have been no

grounds for raising such an argument at that point.

b) Combined jurisdictional bases

. The Tribunal sees nothing in the ICSID Convention that would prevent it from pursuing

proceedings relying upon a cumulative basis for jurisdiction. What matters is the
“consent of the parties’. Consent by the parties for ICSID arbitration can take the form
of an arbitration clause, or of a general offer by a State in a BIT, or in its national
legislation followed by acceptance of this offer by the investor. The only requirement is

that such consent be stated in writing’. If consent can be verified in both cases, nothing

International, pp.21 et seq.

161.

seems to prevent cumulative reliance upon the diverse instruments for which such

consent is expressed.

In the present case, consent for claims relating to fines and penalties is encompassed
within the Arbitration Agreement. With regard to other matters relating to the Claimants’
investment, Ecuador made an open and general offer for ICSID arbitration in the Treaty
that was later accepted by the Claimants when instituting these proceedings and, in
particular, when invoking the BIT as a basis for the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

As a second objection against cumulative jurisdiction, the Respondent contends that
the terms of the Agreement expressly rule out any reliance upon the BIT. It views
paragraph 12, which provides that “/t]he Arbitration held pursuant to this Agreement will
be the exclusive means for resolving all Differences related to the Investment’ as
proscribing the Claimants from commencing ICSID proceedings on the basis of the
BIT. The Claimants reply that they did not waive their rights to invoke the BIT by
entering into the Arbitration Agreement and that paragraph 12 was included simply to
prevent potential conflicts with any other dispute resolution arising out of the parties’

relationship.

The Tribunal finds that the fact that the parties agreed to submit some of their
investment disputes to ICSID arbitration in the Arbitration Agreement, does not in and
of itself preclude the Claimants from availing themselves of the Treaty for additional
claims outside the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. It is true that the situation would
be different had the Claimants specifically waived their right to invoke the Treaty.
However, such a waiver, as the Claimants’ expert, Professor Dolzer, notes, would have

to be explicit and this is not the case’.

Moreover, paragraph 12 of the Arbitration Agreement and the exclusivity of
proceedings contemplated therein only apply to claims encompassed in such
Agreement. As neither the customs duties claim nor the claim concerning the poor
implementation of the Payment Trusts are encompassed by the Arbitration Agreement,
they cannot be affected by this exclusivity.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that the Respondent does not generally oppose the
submission of these claims to ICSID proceedings under the BIT. It merely objects to
their submission in this arbitration, as stated in the Reply: “Of course the Claimants
may submit other claims under the BIT, but not in this proceeding” (R. Reply, ¥ 40,
Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation).

167.

Consequently, the Tribunal concludes that there is no reason to rule out reliance upon
different bases of jurisdiction for different claims brought in the same ICSID arbitration
and that the Claimants have not waived their right to invoke the BIT for claims not
covered by the Arbitration Agreement.

c) The implementation of the Payment Trusts and the scope of the BIT

The Tribunal held above that the implementation of the Payment Trusts does not relate
to fines and penalties and that it thus lacks jurisdiction under the Arbitration Agreement
over claims arising out of such implementation. It follows that the Tribunal must
therefore now examine whether it has jurisdiction over this claim on the basis of the BIT
following the Claimants’ general contention that the BIT could be used as a basis for
jurisdiction for any claim not falling under the purview of the Arbitration Agreement. The
Tribunal does not ignore that the Claimants did not invoke jurisdiction on this basis with
respect to this particular claim. However, assessing jurisdiction in this fashion is in line
with their general argument that the BIT constitutes an alternate basis for jurisdiction
over claims not within the scope of the Arbitration Agreement. It is also in line with the
methodology adopted by the Tribunal above ( 119) and the duty to ascertain
jurisdiction under a treaty ex officio.

Article VI of the BIT provides that a dispute “arising out of or relating to” an investment
between a party to the Treaty and a national of the other party which “cannot be settled
amicably’ may be submitted to ICSID arbitration provided it has “not been submitted for
resolution to [other mechanismsJ’ and “six months have elapsed from the date on
which the dispute arose”. These requirements have been met.

There is no doubt that Duke Energy qualifies as a national of the United States for the
purpose of the BIT. Similarly, Electroquil may be deemed a national of the United
States for the purpose of the BIT since it can be considered as an“ investment” of Duke
Energy under Article VI(8) of the BIT.

The Tribunal is further satisfied that there is a dispute arising out of or relating to an
alleged breach of a right conferred by the Treaty with respect to an investment. In this
respect, it notes that Article I(1) of the BIT defines “investment” as including “a claim to
money or a claim to performance having economic value and associated with an

investment’ and “any right conferred by law or contract’.

The Tribunal is also satisfied that the dispute could not be settled amicably and that it
was not previously submitted to the other resolution mechanisms provided in the

Treaty. Indeed, the Med-Arb Agreements do not deal with the implementation of the

41

168.

169.

170.

171.

172.

173.

Payment Trusts. In addition, the dispute related to the implementation of the Payment
Trusts arose more than six months before the Claimants consented to submit it to
ICSID arbitration. It follows that the Claimants validly consented to submit the dispute
to ICSID, Ecuador’s consent being contained in Article VI of the BIT.

The Tribunal also notes that the dispute relating to the implementation of the Payment
Trusts arose after the Trusts were established, i.e. after 17 February 1998, and thus
falls within the scope ratione temporis of the BIT.

The Tribunal further finds that the requirements of the ICSID Convention are met with
regard to this claim as well as in accordance with its earlier findings ({ 145-148).

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that it has jurisdiction over the dispute

arising out of the implementation of the Payment Trusts under the BIT.
d) Customs duties and the scope of the BIT on matters of taxation

The Respondent alleges that the claim for customs duties is outside the scope of the
BIT since it is a matter of taxation excluded by virtue of Article X(2)(c). The Claimants
contend that this claim does not involve a matter of taxation within the meaning of
Article X(2) of the Treaty, but arises out of the Respondent's failure to reimburse the
Claimants for customs charges paid in connection with the importation of a turbine for
the power plant pursuant to the PPAs (Cl. 2°? PHB, 4 46). The Claimants further argue
that, even if the claim were to be considered a matter of taxation, it would fall within the
exceptions of Article X(2) since the PPAs are “investment agreements” following the
ruling rendered in OEPC v. Ecuador (Cl. 2° PHB, 9 47).

Article X(2) of the BIT reads as follows:

Nevertheless, the provisions of this Treaty, and in particular Article VI and
VII, shall apply to matters of taxation only with respect to the following:

(a) expropriation, pursuant to Article III;
(6) transfers, pursuant to Article IV; or

(c) the observance and enforcement of terms of an investment
agreement or authorization as referred to in Article VI (1) (a) or (b), to
the extent they are not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of
a Convention for the avoidance of double taxation between the two
Parties, or have been raised under such settlement provisions and are
not resolved within a reasonable period of time.

Therefore, the Tribunal must answer the following questions: (i) whether the claim for
customs duties is a matter of taxation within the meaning of Article X; and, if so, (ii)

whether such claim falls within the exceptions provided in paragraph 2 of this Article.

42

174.

175.

176.

The Tribunal will take recourse to the rules on treaty interpretation of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties, in particular to Article 31, which provides that, “fa]
treaty shall be interpreted in good faith and in accordance with the ordinary meaning

given to the terms of the treaty in their context [...]”.

The Treaty does not define the term “matters of taxation”. In seeking to elucidate its
meaning, the ruling in EnCana v. Ecuador appears to be of particular relevance. In
connection with a provision of the Canada-Ecuador BIT referring to the exclusion of
“taxation measures” the tribunal noted that “[ijt is in the nature of a tax that it is imposed
by law” and added that “a taxation law is one which imposes a liability on classes of
persons to pay money to the State for public purposes”.

The exemption from customs duties, which is the subject of this claim, was instituted by
Ley No. 30 de Exoneracién de Impuestos a Importaciones del Sector Publico para
Obras y Servicios Prioritarios allegedly modified by Ley Organica de Aduanas of
13 July 1998. These statutes provide for the exemption from duties on goods imported
for the needs of an industry that is considered to be a national priority. They also detail
the means for determining the scope of such exemptions and nominate the competent
authority for their application. From their title and even more from their purpose, Ley
No. 30 and Ley Organica de Aduanas must be deemed to constitute taxation
legislation. Indeed, as stated by the EnCana tribunal, “[a] measure providing relief from
taxation is a taxation measure just as much as a measure imposing the tax in the first
place”. It is therefore clear that the claim for customs duties relates to matters of
taxation.

The Claimants further allege, in this context, that their claim stems from the application
of the terms of the PPAs. The Tribunal is not persuaded by this argument. Although the
Claimants cite provisions of the PPAs in their Memorial in Chief, the current dispute
relates to the modification of the customs regime established by Law Number 30. To
claim an exemption from customs duties, the Claimants have themselves relied upon

Ecuadorian tax laws, not upon the PPA 96. In their Memorial in Chief, they note:

[...] based on a request from Electroquil, CONADE reaffirmed its view that
goods required for the generation of electricity were a priority for the country
and therefore eligible for tax-free importation under Law Number 30.
Electroquil relied upon these representations that all goods that it needed to
import in order to comply with the PPAs would be duty exempt.

(Cl. Mem, 4 157)

Op.cit.

177.

178.

181.

The Claimants have never explained how the provisions of the PPA 96 applied nor how
they interacted with the taxation laws. The Respondent has not provided its views on
these provisions either. It appears that it was not a disputed point. Consequently, the

Tribunal concludes that the customs duty claim must be deemed a matter of taxation.

Further, the Tribunal notes the open wording of Article X(2), which excludes all taxation
matters except for those expressly included within the scope of (a) to (c). The scope of
Article X(2) was specifically discussed in OEPC v. Ecuador, in the award rendered by
the LCIA tribunal under the US-Ecuador BIT"', and in the subsequent decision by
Justice Aikens of the Queen’s Bench Division dismissing Ecuador's application against
the award". This later decision stated that the wording of Article X(2) “makes it clear
that, apart from matters of taxation that come within the three identified exceptions, all

matters of taxation are outside the ambit of the BIT’.

Having found that the claim on customs duties relates to matters of taxation, the
Tribunal will now examine whether it falls under any of these exceptions. The
Claimants allege that their customs duty claim falls under the exemption detailed in
Article X(2)(c) of the BIT since it relates to Ecuador's obligation under the PPAs to
reimburse Claimants and because the PPAs are investment agreements. The Tribunal
notes that the Claimants do not explain how the PPAs are investment agreements and
merely refer to {J 71-72 of the OEPC award.

According to Article X(2)(c), claims on matters of taxation are covered by the BIT if they
relate to the:

[...] observance and enforcement of terms of an investment agreement or
authorization as referred to in Article VI (1) (a) or (b) to the extent they are
not subject to the dispute settlement provisions of a Convention for the
avoidance of double taxation between the two Parties, or have been raised
under such settlement provisions and are not resolved within a reasonable
period of time.

The Tribunal is faced with two questions: (a) whether the PPAs are indeed investment
agreements, as referred to in Article VI(1)(a) or (b); and (b) as put by the tribunal in

OEPC “whether the observance and enforcement of the terms of an investment
td

agreement concerning matters of taxation is at issue in this dispute”"”.
While the Treaty offers no definition for “investment agreement”, Article X(2)(c) points
to the type of agreement referred to in Article VI(1)(a) in its definition of “investment
dispute”:

For purposes of this Article, an investment dispute is a dispute between a

Party and a national or company of the other Party arising out or relating to

(a) an investment agreement between that Party and such national or

company [...]
Accordingly, Justice Aikens notes that, for the purposes of Article VI, an investment
agreement has to be one that “is between a State Party and a national or company of
the other State Party”’*. In this case, the PPAs were entered into by INECEL — a state-
owned entity — and Electroquil, a company incorporated in Ecuador that, at the time of
subscription of the Agreements, was not owned by foreign investors. It appears
therefore that, for the purpose of Article VI(1)(a) — as required by Article X(2)(c) — the

PPAs cannot be considered as investment agreements.

In addition, the Claimants’ reference to the OEPC award is not sufficient to
demonstrate the existence of an investment agreement. In fact, the OEPC award leads
to the opposite conclusion. The OEPC case concerned a concession agreement
signed between a foreign investor (OEPC) and Petroecuador, an Ecuadorian State-
owned corporation. The tribunal in that case accepted Ecuador’s argument that the
concession contract qualified as an investment agreement in accordance with the
Lanco Decision “in so far as this decision identified a concession contract [...] with an

investment agreement”®.

The same is not true here. First, the PPAs are not concession contracts, but contracts
for the installation of certain equipment and the sale and purchase of electricity to
INECEL. Second, even if the PPAs were concession contracts, they would still not
qualify as investment agreements in the terms of the BIT. The Lanco decision did not
equate concession contract with investment agreement in general. Applying a clause of
the Argentina-USA BIT identical to the one at issue here, it reviewed the position of the
parties and their obligations and held as follows:

This [the existence of an investment for the purposes of applying the
Argentina-U.S. Treaty] does not make the Concession Agreement an

investment agreement, since not all parties are legally situated in like
manner. However, it is also clear that insofar as LANCO is a party to this
agreement as awardee and guarantor, the Concession Agreement, with
respect to the foreign investor, can be characterized as an investment
agreement [. J”.

Duke Energy did not sign the PPAs nor did it acquire any obligations under their terms.
Further, the Ecuadorian State was not a party to such agreements. Accordingly, the
Tribunal concludes that the PPAs cannot be deemed investment agreements for the

purposes of Article VI(1)(a) — as required by Article X(2)(c).

Finally, the Tribunal notes that, even if the PPAs were regarded as investment
agreements because of the later involvement of the State and the acquisition of the
majority of Electroquil’s stake by Duke Energy, the claims on customs duties would still
be outside the scope of Article X(2). Indeed, the Tribunal is not satisfied that the
dispute relates to the “observance and enforcement” of the terms of the alleged
investment agreements. As discussed above, the dispute relates to the modification of

the customs regime established by Law Number 30.

For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the claim for customs duties does not
fall within the scope of the BIT. Therefore, it lacks jurisdiction to decide over such

claim.

In light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to examine the third objection raised by the
Respondent as to the lack of compliance with the jurisdictional requirements under the
BIT and the ICSID Convention. As a result, the Tribunal will now turn to analyzing the
second of the two questions arising from the particular circumstances of this dispute,

which is the question of the applicable law.

APPLICABLE LAW

The BIT is not only invoked as a basis for jurisdiction but also as the applicable law
under the Arbitration Agreement. This distinction does not appear to have always been
clearly drawn by the parties during the proceedings, resulting in a certain confusion.
The Tribunal has sought to discern the arguments of the parties dealing with the

applicable law to reach its conclusion.

Parties’ positions

According to the Claimants, the parties unambiguously agreed in the Arbitration
Agreement that their disputes would be decided in accordance with the BIT and that
the Tribunal would determine the investment dispute “under the laws of Ecuador and
the applicable principles of international law [...] the standard of review being based on
the terms of the BIT’ (Cl. Reply, § 204).

The Claimants request the application of the substantive standards of the BIT and “in
any event protection and guarantees no less than the minimum standards guaranteed
under customary international law’ (Cl. Rejoinder, § 44). In their view, in assessing
whether the substantive protections contained in the BIT have been breached, the
Tribunal may make reference to Ecuadorian law to the extent that it is not inconsistent
with international law (Cl. Reply, | 44). The Claimants’ position as to the law governing
damages is more complex and has evolved throughout the proceedings. The Tribunal

will revert to it in the discussion on damages.

The Respondent agrees that the Arbitration Agreement provides that the disputes be
resolved in accordance with Ecuadorian law and the principles of international law. The
Respondent also acknowledges that the BIT applies as part of international law
pursuant to paragraph 9 of the Arbitration Agreement (R. Answer, {| 441). Nonetheless,
the Respondent considers that the Claimants seek to circumvent the application of
domestic law by solely invoking the provisions of the BIT. Like the Claimants, the
Respondent's position with respect to the law governing damages will be set forth in

the discussion on damages.

Tribunal’s determination

3.2.1 Applicable law

Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention contains the following rule:

The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of
law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement,
the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute
(including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of international law
as may be applicable. (Emphasis added)

The parties acknowledge that their agreement in respect of the applicable law is
contained in Article 9 of the Arbitration Agreement, which reads as follows:
9. The Court will rule on the Differences regarding Investment in

accordance with the laws of the Republic of Ecuador and the
applicable principles of International Law. All matters related to the

47

196.

197.

198.

199.

validity, efficacy, application or interpretation of this Agreement will be

resolved by the Court in accordance with International Law. The Court

is not authorized to, nor may it, rule on the Differences, either ex

aequo et bono or as amiable compositor, or based on any other

doctrine or principle other than this Agreement or Applicable Law.

(Spanish original, English translation provided by the Claimants)
The Tribunal finds that the parties’ choice of law is clear: both Ecuadorian law and the
principles of international law should apply. The question is whether the reference to
the “applicable principles of international law’ includes the provisions of the BIT. The
Claimants allege that the parties unambiguously agreed to such inclusion. The
Respondent accepts the application of the BIT as the “substantive framework’ for the
resolution of the disputes covered by the Arbitration Agreement (R. Reply, § 35). In
addition, when asked by the Tribunal to explain the reference to the BIT in paragraph 2
of the Arbitration Agreement, counsel for the Respondent answered that “the BIT helps
the parties in defining the precise formulation of the principles of international law that
the Tribunal may apply’ (Tr., p. 106). As a result, the Tribunal concludes that the
parties intended the reference to “applicable principles of international law’ to include
the BIT standards.

Having reached this conclusion, the Tribunal observes that the parties agree, in
practice, first to the application of the PPAs and their provisions in light of Ecuadorian
law, and second, to the application of the BIT standards. The Tribunal considers this to
be the right approach and will consequently follow it in its analysis of the merits.
Accordingly, the Tribunal will first review the contractual issues under Ecuadorian law
and then the compliance with the BIT standards. The standards which apply to the
damages will be addressed if and when the issue arises.

3.2.2 Application ratione personae/temporis of the BIT

Before turning to the examination of the Respondent’s conduct, the Tribunal will
address the question of the application ratione temporis and ratione personae of the
substantive provisions of the Treaty"®.

While the Claimants apply the BIT standards to all of their claims without distinction,
the Respondent's position has evolved during the proceedings. It initially claimed that
the BIT should apply only to investments made after 23 February 1998, i.e. after Duke
Energy acquired ownership in Electroquil (R. Answer, {| 441). Later, in its discussion on
damages, the Respondent argued that only acts subsequent to the entry into force of

This issue was not discussed in the analysis on jurisdiction as the Tribunal preferred examining
it after having made a determination as to the applicable law.

200.

the BIT, on 11 May 1997, could be taken into account (R. Answer, § 563). In its Reply,

it noted’®:

[...] The Arbitration Agreement considerable broadens the scope of
jurisdiction that the tribunal would have had, should the Claimants have
instituted proceedings solely under the BIT [footnote omitted]. In particular:
the Arbitration Agreement submits to arbitration disputes that arose before
the entry into force of the BIT. The first fines under each PPA were levied
before May 11, 1998 date in which the BIT entered into force, Without the

and of the e Claimants
would have ‘heen unable to submit to the jurisdiction of. the  Thibunal its
claims for the initial fines. (R. Reply, {§ 83-84, Spanish original, Tribunal’s
Translation)

 

The Respondent further noted in its first Post Hearing Brief, when addressing the
Tribunal’s question regarding the reference to the BIT in the Arbitration Agreement:

It is important to mention, in second place, that, as demonstrated by the
RDE, a number of the fines were imposed prior to the entry into force of the
BIT and also prior to the existence of the Claimants’ investment. Therefore,
have the Arbitration Agreement not been signed, the Claimants could not
rely, as they do now, on the TBI regarding several of the fines and penalties
under PPA95 and PPAQ6. The second meaning of the reference to the BIT,
therefore, is to cover a certain conduct of the RDE which would otherwise
have fallen outside the ratione temporis scope of the BIT.

[Footnote No. 12 stated: Regarding the fines imposed before Duke's
investment, it is still doubtful that they could give rise to a dispute in the
ratione personae terms of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention. The RDE
however, does not seek to challenge what she herself has agreed in the
Arbitration Agreement, but precisely to enforce it] (R. 1" PHB, § 29, Spanish
original, Tribunal’s translation)

01. On this basis, the Tribunal has but to conclude that the parties agreed to the

202.

application of the BIT standards to all of the claims covered by the Arbitration
Agreement: (i) claims related to fines and penalties, including fines imposed before the
entry into force of the BIT and the acquisition of Duke Energy’s investment in Ecuador;
(ii) claims related to the establishment of the Payment Trusts; and (iii) claims related to
the implementation of the Payment Trusts covered by the BIT.

MERITS

According to the Claimants, Ecuador violated the PPAs and Ecuadorian law by
delaying the establishment of the Payment Trusts, poorly implementing them, and
failing to comply with the contractual regime agreed upon in connection with fines and

penalties. The Claimants argue that these violations amount to a violation of the

stated by the Claimants.

206.

principle of good faith under Ecuadorian law and give rise to breaches of the BIT. The

Respondent denies being responsible for any breach of Ecuadorian law or the BIT.

In light of the parties’ claims and in accordance with its finding on the applicable law to
the dispute, the Tribunal will first examine the position under the provisions of the PPAs
and Ecuadorian law (4.1) starting with the payment obligations under the PPAs and the
Payment Trust Agreements (4.1.1), continuing with the interest on late payments
(4.1.2), the fines and penalties (4.1.3), the Med-Arb Agreements (4.1.4), and ending
with the claims of bad faith (4.1.5). It will subsequently evaluate the Respondent's
compliance with the BIT standards (4.2). In this context, it will define the issues to be
determined (4.2.1) and review the umbrella clause (4.2.2), fair and equitable treatment
(4.2.3), impairment of the investment (4.2.4), and the application of Article II(7)(4.2.5).

Before doing so, the Tribunal notes that the PPAs were entered into by INECEL, an
entity separate from the State. It also notes that, as mentioned above ({ 45-48), the
MEM, acting under Executive Decree No. 506 (Cl. Exh. 016), entered into the
Subrogation Agreements in May and June 1999. Through these agreements, the
Ecuadorian State assumed the rights and obligations of INECEL under the PPAs (Cl.
Exh. 017, Cl. Exh. 018). Therefore, unlike with respect to many other investment
disputes, the issue of whether Ecuador is responsible for INECEL’s (contractual) acts
and omissions does not need to be discussed, and was actually not discussed. This is
so because the Respondent's responsibility derives clearly from the terms of the
Subrogation Agreements. This position does not, however, rule out the possibility of an

independent assumption of responsibility of the State in relation to the Payment Trusts.
Did Ecuador breach the PPAs and Ecuadorian law?

Respondent complied with the contractual payment mechanism (b).

First, the establishment of the Payment Trusts was a condition precedent to
commercial operation identified in the PPAs, i.e. 31 March 1996 in the PPA 95 (Clause
12.7) and 5 January 1997 in the PPA 96 (Clause 13.1) (Cl. Mem., 4 112). According to
the Claimants, the guarantee provided by the Payment Trusts was necessary in order
to secure loans to finance the acquisition of the turbines generating the electricity to be
supplied by Electroquil under the PPAs. As a matter of fact, the turbine manufacturer
Stewart and Stevenson delayed shipment until it received confirmation that the
Payment Trusts had been put in place. Despite the numerous reminders sent to
INECEL, the Ecuadorian Government failed to set up the Payment Trusts, which
almost led to Electroquil’s insolvency (Cl. Mem., §§ 112-116; Cl. 1° PHB, 49 13-20).
The Claimants further contend that fines No.1 and 2 were imposed as a result of the

late start-up caused by the non-implementation of the Payment Trusts.

Second, both with and without the Payment Trusts in place and both prior to and after
Duke Energy’s investment, Ecuador consistently failed to pay Electroquil as required
under the PPAs. Only 37 of the 122 invoices submitted by Electroquil were paid within
30 days. Furthermore, when Ecuador made payment to Electroquil, it rarely settled the
entire amount of the invoice. INECEL had no right to offset unpaid fines and penalties
against amounts it owed to Electroquil in connection with the regular monthly or annual
payment required under the PPAs (Cl. 1** PHB, | 39).

Third, Ecuador failed to provide the guarantee of payment it undertook in the Payment
Decree and the Payment Trust Agreements. For the Claimants, the Payment Trusts
were envisioned as payment guarantees of INECEL’s payments to Electroquil under
the PPAs. Ecuador's obligation was not only to establish the Payment Trusts but also
to comply with them and guarantee their implementation (Cl. Reply, ¥§ 119-120). Once
established, the Payment Trusts should have ensured the full and timely payment of all

amounts due by Ecuador.
(ii) Respondent's position

The Respondent alleges that it put the Payment Trusts into place on 17 February 1998,
once all the essential requirements under Ecuadorian law had been satisfied and that
there was no harmful intention or negligence in their delayed establishment (R.
Answer, § 293).

. In response to the Claimants’ argument based on the exceptio non adimpleti contractus

with respect to the delay in putting the Payment Trusts into place, Ecuador points out

that the constitution of the Payment Trusts was not an essential obligation like the one

51

212.

213.

214,

related to the provision of energy and that the exceptio does apply to obligations of a
different nature, as set out in Article 1568 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code. Finally,
Ecuador denies that “reasons not attributable to Electroquil’ constitute grounds for

separate and distinct exemption.

It further submits that Electroquil’s invoices were not paid in a timely manner due to
catastrophic and unforeseen economic conditions in the country. The Respondent
submits that Electroquil was aware of the country’s financial difficulties due to
successive political and economic events, such as the armed conflict with Peru, the
drop in fuel prices, the effects of El Nifio, the shutdown of external credit, the collapse
of the financial sector, and the change in the monetary system. The delays in the
payments were due to these difficulties and were not attributable to negligence or bad
faith. All payments were nevertheless eventually made to Electroquil’s satisfaction
without any reservation (R. Answer, J§ 384-389). In addition, offset was authorized
under the PPAs and INECEL did not breach the PPAs in that regard.

Finally, the Payment Trusts were not meant to serve as a guarantee but were merely
understood as a payment mechanism for the PPAs, an understanding which Electroquil
never opposed. By the Payment Decree, Ecuador undertook to be INECEL’s guarantor
(‘aval’). However, INECEL, which was a separate and distinct entity from the State
(R. Reply, {| 160), remained the direct debtor of the payment obligation until March
1999, when Ecuador assumed INECEL’s rights and obligations upon INECEL’s
liquidation. Accordingly, Ecuador met his obligation under the Payment Decree by
setting up the Payment Trusts which enabled the invoices to be paid on a monthly
basis. In addition, the Payment Trusts excluded the State’s liability should the funds be
insufficient to make the relevant payments.

b) Tribunal’s determination

The Tribunal will now examine whether (i) the Payment Trusts had been established in
accordance with the timetable set by the PPAs; (ii) the Payment Trusts were properly
implemented; (iii) the payment of Electroquil’s invoices was delayed; and whether
(iv) offset was allowed under the PPAs. It will review in subsequent sub-sections below
whether interest for late payments is due and whether INECEL complied with the
penalty regime of the PPAs.

(i) Establishment of the Payment Trusts

The provisions of the PPAs relating to the Payment Trusts read as follows, starting with
PPA 95:

Fixed costs: a) INECEL shall pay the Contractor a fixed monthly amount of
twelve American Dollars (US$12.00) per kilowatt as a charge for ISO
capacity. In addition, INECEL shall pay the Contractor a monthly energy
charge of US$0.0045 per kilowatt hour, applicable to the monthly rounded-
off amount of four hundred thirty-three (433) hours of operation at ISO
capacity (five thousand two hundred (5200) hours annually). b) The
amounts indicated in the preceding section shall be paid through a
payment trusts account in the Central Bank of Ecuador in the Contractor's
name, for the purposes of which INECEL shall process and execute the
appropriate payment trusts agreement payable to the Contractor or its
designated beneficiary, which shall be signed prior to commercial
operation by the plant. INECEL shall have thirty days (30) to make the
payment.

(Clause 7.1 PPA 95; Cl. Exh. 010, emphasis added, Spanish orginal, English
translation provided by the Claimants)

And continuing with PPA 96:

The amounts indicated in Sections EIGHT.ONE, EIGHT.TWO and
EIGHT.FOUR shall be paid monthly within thirty (30) days after the date of
delivery and receipt of such invoices and those indicated in Section
EIGHT.FIVE, if any, shall be paid annually and shall also be paid within thirty
(30) days after the date of the delivery and receipt of each invoice. Payment
shall be made through a payment trusts account in the Central Bank of
Ecuador in the Contractor's name, for the purposes of which INECEL
shall process and execute the appropriate payment trusts agreement
for the benefit of the Contractor or its designated beneficiary, which shall be
signed prior to commercial operation by the Plant. The Minister of
Finance and Public Credit shall also be a party to such payment trusts
agreement, on behalf of and representing the Republic of Ecuador, in
accordance with Order number three thousand ninety-nine, dated the
twenty-seventh of September of nineteen ninety-five, and it shall provide
that the accounts that the Ministry has with the Central Bank of
Ecuador will be debited, providing the necessary funds, on the
required dates, in the event that the funds in INECEL’s accounts, or in
the payment trusts account, are insufficient. To implement this
mechanism, it will be sufficient for INECEL to send the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit a notice seven days in advance of the date of payment to
make the p: in with the pi of Sub: b) of
Section seven point zero point one of the clause of the power purchase
agreement (PPA) [ie, PPA 96].

(Clause 8.6 PPA 96; Cl. Exh. 011, emphasis added, Spanish original,
English translation provided by the Claimants)

 

The commercial operation of Units 1 and 2 started on 10 May 1996, i.e. approximately
one and a half months after the scheduled dates. The commercial operation of Units 3
and 4 began on 19 June 1997, i.e. approximately six months after the scheduled dates.

As of January 1996, Electroquil drew INECEL’s attention to the Payment Trust required
under Clause 7.1 of the PPA 95 (CI. Exh. 039, Cl. Exh. 040, Cl. Exh. 045). In response,

53

219.

220.

221.

222.

on 13 March 1996, INECEL sent a request to the Central Bank of Ecuador to initiate
the necessary procedures to put the Payment Trusts in place (CI. Exh. 040). It was not
before 10 November 1997, however, that the Payment Decree requiring the Central
Bank of Ecuador to constitute the Payment Trusts was issued, and not before 17

February 1998 that the Payment Trusts were established accordingly.

Therefore, it is clear that the Payment Trusts were not established prior to commercial
operation of Units 1, 2, 3 and 4.

(ii) Failure to implement the Payment Trusts

The issue before the Tribunal is twofold: first, did INECEL — until 1999 — and Ecuador —
thereafter — breach the PPAs and the Payment Trust Agreements by not properly
implementing them? Second, did Ecuador, through its Ministry of Finance, guarantee
the timely payment of Electroquil’s invoices under the Payment Decree and the
Payment Trusts?

In addition to the above quoted provisions contained in the PPAs, it is useful to

examine the wording of the Payment Decree and the Payment Trusts.
The Payment Decree reads:

Art. 1.- The net of Finance and Public Credit is hereby authorized to
f payment
guarantee, (GUARANTEE), of “the Prien: State in ihe two trust
agreements that INECEL, as Grantor, Central Bank of Ecuador as Trustee,
and ELECTROQUIL, S.A., as Beneficiary, will subscribe, by means of which
INECEL expressly and irrevocably authorizes the trustee to monthly retain,
in the proportions deemed appropriate, the funds from the account or
accounts that INECEL may hold in Central Bank of Ecuador, as well as the
income that INECEL may posses or that in the future may be assigned
through the Issuer Institute to it, in order to pay the monthly invoices, in
accordance with the amount, term and financial conditions determined in
each bulk power purchase agreements signed between INECEL and the
company ELECTROQUIL S.A. on October 31, 1995, and August 8, 1996
respectively.

Art. 2.- This payment guarantee that it will be included in the two trust
agreements, enables Central Bank of Ecuador, in the event INECEL
does not have sufficient resources to face the payments it must fulfill
in accordance with the bulk power purchase agreements signed with
ELECTROQUIL S.A., to debit from the accounts the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit could have in Central Bank of Ecuador, the sufficient
amounts, and in the required dates, for the full payment of the
respective invoices, and to deposit such amounts in the special Trust
that may be established for that purpose, in order to fulfill payments to
ELECTROQUIL S.A. (CI. Exh. 007, emphasis added, Spanish original,
English translation provided by the Claimants)

54

223. The 1995 Payment Trust (Cl. Exh. 010) reads, in relevant parts, as follows:

[Recital] 1.4 As a result of the approval granted by the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit in Ministerial Order No. STCP-97-124, dated September
12, 1997, Executive Decree No. 804 was issued, which was published in
Official Register No. 190 on November 10, 1997, under which said Ministry
was authorized to sign the guarantee of payment of the obligations arising
under the aforementioned contract, such guarantee to be provided by the
Republic of Ecuador in the trust agreement to be entered into with the
Central Bank of Ecuador.

TWO. FORMATION OF THE TRUST AND PROCEDURE: Based on the
foregoing recitals, the Ecuadorian Institute of Electrification (INECEL)
expressly and irrevocably authorizes the retention, on a monthly basis,
and in the proper proportions, of a debit from the funds in account No.
01310016 that the Ecuadorian Institute of Electrification (INECEL)
maintains with the Central Bank of Ecuador or any other account that it
has with such institution, as well as from any income that it holds or that is
allocated to it in the future through the Issuing Institute, to make the
payment of the dividends, according to the amount, the time and
financial terms and conditions determined in Clause Seven "Prices and
Manner of Payment" of the Bulk Power Purchase Agreement executed
on October 31, 1995, before Notary Thirty-five of the Canton of Guayaquil.

To make this mechanism operational, the Ecuadorian Institute of
Electrification (INECEL) shall provide the Central Bank, fifteen days in
advance of the date of payment, a copy of the invoices, duly legalized,
in order for the payment procedures to be carried out.

The amounts retained pursuant to the preceding paragraph shall be
deposited by the trustee Bank in a special account that shall be named:
“TRUST-INECEL-ELECTROQUIL S.A." The payment shall be made to
Electroquil S.A. from this account in accordance with the instructions issued
for such purpose by such company, which are set out in Letter No. PEJ-97-
12-1124, dated December 11, 1997.

The Central Bank of Ecuador agrees to provide the trust services under the
terms and itions of this in with the provisions of
Article 120 of the Monetary System and State Bank Law.

FIVE. GUARANTEE OF PAYMENT: The Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit, duly authorized by Article 2 of Decree No. 804, published in
Official Register No. 190 on November 10, 1997, hereby grants, on
behalf of the Republic of Ecuador, for the benefit of the Ecuadorian
Institute of Electrification (INECEL), the guarantee to secure
i with the igatic by the ie
Institute of Electrification (INECEL) to Electroquil S.A. under the Bulk
Power Purchase Agreement executed on October 31, 1995 before Notary
Thirty-five of the Canton of Guayaquil, Roger Arosemena Benites, Attorney
at Law.

 

For the purposes thereof, the Ministry of Finance and Public Credit
irrevocably authorizes the Central Bank of Ecuador, in the event that
the Ecuadorian Institute of Electrification (INECEL) does not have
funds sufficient in its accounts to comply with the aforementioned
payment obligation, to debit any accounts that the Ministry of Finance
and Public Credit maintains in the Central Bank of Ecuador for
sufficient amounts, on the dates on which they are required for the total
payment of the specific invoices, and to make the deposits in the
special trust account that is established for such purpose by this
instrument.

SIX. THE TRUSTEE'S LIABILITY: The obligations that the Central Bank of
Ecuador assumes by this agreement shall terminate if the resources in the

55

224.

225.

226.

227.

228.

special trust account or in the accounts of the Ministry of Finance and Public
Credit, as the case may be, are insufficient and, in general, in the event that
it is physically or legally impossible for the Central Bank of Ecuador to
comply with the commitment assumed hereby.

In addition, the Central Bank of Ecuador does not assume any liability for the
obligations assumed under the Bulk Power Purchase Agreement between
the Institute of ion (INECEL) and Eke lS.
executed on October 31, 1995 before Notary Thirty-five of the Canton of
Guayaquil. (R. Exh. 054, emphasis added, Spanish original, English
translation provided by the Claimants)

The 1996 Payment Trust contains similar provisions (Cl. Exh. 011).

Upon the reading of Clause 7.1 of PPA 95 quoted above, INECEL’s monthly payment
for fixed costs was to be made through a payment trust. Under Clause 8.3 of the PPA
96, it appears that all INECEL’s monthly payments were also to be made through a
payment trust. Clauses 2 of the Payment Trust Agreements do not appear to condition
INECEL’s payment in any way. The Tribunal therefore understands the Payment Trusts
to be the main contractual mechanism for payment of Electroquil’s invoices with regard

to energy supply.

In order for the payments to be carried out through the Payment Trusts, INECEL was to
approve Electroquil’s invoices pursuant to the provisions of the PPAs, and provide a
copy to the Central Bank fifteen days prior to the date of payment (Clause 2 of the
Payment Trusts; Tr. G. Larrea, p. 277).

Mr. Larrea states in his first witness statement “[oJn few occasions, we were able to
draw some money from the Trusts, as had been promised under the Payment
Guarantee Decree. Usually though, we would be told that there was simply no money
on INECEL’s account.” (1* WS G. Larrea, § 51). In his second statement, he
mentioned that, at the end of 1998, INECEL’s general manager delayed the delivery of
Electroquil’s invoices to the Central Bank to prevent the payment (2° WS G. Larrea,
27). Mr. Larrea also wrote that, at the beginning of 1999, INECEL transferred its funds
from the Central Bank to a private bank (2 WS, § 28). At the hearing, Mr. Larrea
stated “instead of sending the invoices to the Central Bank, simply they didn’t send.
They kept the invoices” (Tr. p. 277). For his part, the Claimants’ expert assumed that
the Payment Trusts were not used before March 2000. He notes that eventually, after
INECEL’s liquidation, the Trusts were used between March 2000 and March 2001 for a
payment of USD 8.6 million (1 ER Kaczmarek, 47).

Be this as it may, it is undisputed that the Payment Trusts did not function as provided
for under the PPAs. Electroquil’s invoices were nevertheless sometimes paid within the
relevant time but, more often, with delay, both prior to and after the establishment of

56

229.

230.

231.

232.

the Payment Trusts. The Tribunal notes that payment of the invoices that were actually
settled was made by the Ministry of Finance which handled the invoice payment (E.
Santos, INECEL’s contract administrator from 1999 to the Liquidation, Tr. p. 492).

The Tribunal further understands that the Payment Trusts also contain a guarantee
from the Ministry of Finance that, in the absence of sufficient funds in INECEL’s trust
account, payment would be made through the Ministry of Finance account with the
Central Bank. A provision to that effect was already included in the PPA 96. The
Tribunal cannot concur with the Respondent that the Ministry of Finance’s responsibility
terminated with the establishment of the Payment Trusts, nor that the Payment Trusts
Agreement excluded the State’s liability. The Tribunal notes that no specific procedure
to implement the State’s guarantee was included in the Payment Trust Agreements.
While it is unclear from the record as to whether this guarantee was ever triggered by
the Central Bank, it seems that it was not. This said, the record does not contain any

letter from Electroquil sent to the Ministry of Finance in this regard.

The Payment Trusts were thus a significant mechanism of a mixed nature: they
provided for a contractual payment mechanism and also for a guarantee of the State if
the contractual mechanism was not complied with. The latter is a contractual obligation
undertaken by the State vis-a-vis Electroquil in its sovereign capacity. Under the
Payment Trust Agreements, this obligation did not extend to Duke Energy, which was
not party to the Agreements. These elements will be further discussed below in the BIT

analysis.

It appears therefore that the conditions for the payment of Electroquil’s invoices as set
out in the PPAs and in the Payment Trust Agreements were not complied with by
INECEL and the Respondent, which in turn led to late payment of Electroquil’s
invoices.

(iii) The late payments

The Claimants have produced an expert report with several tables analyzing Ecuador's
alleged failure to pay Electroquil’s invoices, together with copies of such invoices,
extracts from Electroquil’s accounting system showing date of payment, letters from
Electroquil acknowledging receipt of payment and/or documents from INECEL
regarding payment (Annex NAV-18, NAV-19 to 1 ER Kaczmarek). The Claimants’
expert report and the documents appended thereto establish late payments of
Electroquil’s invoices and show the number of days of delay under each PPA (Annex
NAV-6 to 1 ER Kaczmarek). The late payments can be illustrated by the balance due

57

234.

235.

236.

237.

238.

to Electroquil. For example, when the Payment Trusts were signed, the overdue
balance owing to Electroquil was approximately of USD 7.2 million (1° ER Kaczmarek,
{ 43). In March 1999, such balance amounted to USD 20.7 million before being
partially settled and reduced to USD 11.3 million through the issuance of government
bonds. The overdue balance owing to Electroquil was reduced to USD 9.2 million as of
March 2000 when payment in dollars was made through the Payment Trusts (1° ER
Kaczmarek, {| 47). The payments of certain invoices were also divided in installments.
Overall, the Tribunal understands that Electroquil’s total invoices amounted to USD
124,224,305 million (1S' ER Mancero Saman, § 44).

. The Claimants’ expert report also contains a computation of interest on such late

payments in the amount of USD 8,421,050. The Tribunal notes that no capital is
claimed on any invoices (Table 13 and Annex NAV-1 to 1S* ER Kaczmarek).

The Respondent does not challenge the delays in payment. It argues, however, that
the late payment of Electroquil’s invoices is excused because it was attributable to

events over which Ecuador had no control.

As opposed to the provisions of the PPAs on fines and penalties (Clause 12 of PPA 95
and Clause 8 of PPA 96), the clauses regarding INECEL’s payment obligations do not
stipulate any grounds for liability exemption (Clause 7 of PPA 95 and Clause 8 of PPA
96). Under the PPAs, INECEL was thus bound to effect payment on time irrespective of

the prevailing political or economic conditions.

The question remains whether the delays may be excused by force majeure. The
occurrence of the political and economic events referred to in paragraph 212 above is

not disputed. Nor is it disputed that the Claimants knew about them (R. Exh. 55).

While acknowledging the burden which these events may have represented for the
country, the Tribunal cannot but note that Ecuador has not demonstrated that they
amount to force majeure, nor that any of the conditions for its application were met. Nor
has it shown what impact they may have had on INECEL’s payment obligations under
the PPAs. The Tribunal notes, in particular, that the testimony of Mr. Spurrier, one of
the witnesses for Ecuador, has shown that the financial crisis was foreseeable.

(iv) Was set-off admissible?

It seems that one of the reasons lying behind certain late payments was INECEL’s
practice to set-off certain fines against Electroquil’s invoices as established in Section
2.4 above in the factual part of this Award.

58

239.

240.

241.

242.

243.

244,

The parties debated the validity of such practice. Ecuador submits that there was no
impediment to set-off pursuant to Article 1671 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code to the

extent that the invoices and the fines are both monetary claims that are due.

The Claimants do no dispute that Article 1671 of the Civil Code is relevant to the issue,
but argue that the PPAs did not allow the Respondent to offset the fine amounts from
invoices due and payable to Electroquil, although it could have offset them from the
performance bonds.

Interpreting Clause 12 PPA 95 and Clause 13 PPA 96 on penalties (which will be set
out in more details below) beyond their wording and within their context pursuant to
Clause 4 PPA 95 and Clause 4 PPA 96 and Title XIII of the Ecuadorian Civil Code
referred to therein, the Tribunal does not consider that these specific contractual

provisions were meant to exclusively govern claims and debts under the contracts.

As a matter of fact, set-off was expressly provided for in Clause 18.1 PPA 95 and
Clause 19.1 PPA 96 at the PPAs’ liquidation phase. Hence, the PPAs envisaged the
principle of set-off and there is no reason why set-off could not be used during the term
of the PPAs, provided the legal requirements, i.e. two monetary claims mutually due,
were met (Art. 1672 and 1673 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code). This said, the Tribunal
does not consider that INECEL’s set-off practice could justify the late payments; in
other words INECEL still had to comply with the other contractual provisions.

(v) Conclusion

It follows that (i) INECEL breached the PPAs by not establishing the Payment Trusts
prior to the commercial operation of Units 1 to 4; (ii) INECEL and the Respondent failed
to operate satisfactorily the Payment Trusts; (iii) INECEL and the Respondent
proceeded to late payments under the PPAs; and (iv) set-off was allowed under the
PPAs.

4.1.2 Claims for interest on late payments

Having ascertained that INECEL and the Respondent were late in the payment of
Electroquil’s invoices, the Tribunal will determine whether interest is due (a) prior to

deciding if Electroquil has waived its claim to interest (b).

59

245.

246.

247.

248.

249.

a) Is interest due?
(i) Parties’ positions

The Claimants argue that the accrual of interest in Electroquil’s favor as a result of
Ecuador's persistent late payments constitutes customary business and legal practice.
It claims that Electroquil reserved its right to claim late interest on several occasions
and that Ecuador cannot reasonably argue that such a claim be excused on the
grounds of force majeure or that it has been waived, settled or released by virtue of the
Interim Liquidation Agreement, the 95 and 96 Liquidation Agreements, the Subrogation
Agreements, the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement and/or the Undisputed Amounts
Interest Agreement.

Ecuador relies on Article 1611 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code to argue that, since
Electroquil did not make any reservations with respect to the non-payment of interest,
interest on late payments is presumed to have been paid. It also argues that it is for the
party opposing this presumption to prove that reservations were made, which the
Claimants have not done.

The Respondent further argues that interest has, in any event, been waived or settled
with respect to the Interim Liquidation Agreement, the 95 and 96 Liquidation
Agreements, the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement and the Undisputed Amounts
Interest Agreement. Indeed, all pending payment obligations, except those related to
the fines, were subject to liquidation pursuant to such agreements, and Electroquil

never objected to the liquidation.
(ii) Tribunal’s determination concerning right to interest

Both parties have relied upon Article 1611 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, which

provides as follows:

Art. 1611. If principal and interest are both due, payment shall be applied
first to interest, unless the creditor expressly consents that it be applied to
principal.

If the creditor gives a letter of acquittance of the principal, without mentioning
interest, the interest is presumed paid.

(Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation)
On the one hand, the Claimants argue that a presumption exists pursuant to which
interest was to be paid when principal and interest were owed, the debtor was to make
a partial payment, and the creditor approved the payment without expressly reserving

its interest claim. They allege that these requirements were not fulfilled, as Electroquil

60

250.

25

252.

254.

255.

never approved the payments made by the Ecuadorian Government, nor issued any
receipt of payment in this respect. Further, they submit that Electroquil made several
clear reservations of rights with respect to its interest claim, thus leaving any
presumption without effect (Cl. 1% PHB, 459, Cl. 2°? PHB, 4 39).

On the other hand, Ecuador submits that the presumption laid in Article 1611(2) of the
Ecuadorian Civil Code does apply and that no interest for late payment is owed. It
contends that Electroquil did not make any reservations when it received and endorsed
payment (R. 1° PHB, §f 173-174, R. 2" PHB, 4 11).

. In order to determine whether the presumption of Article 1611(2) of the Ecuadorian

Civil Code applies, the Tribunal must primarily examine whether there is a right to
interest and whether the Claimants made any reservations with regard to interest when

INECEL and Ecuador paid the invoices.
Article 1575 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code reads as follows:

Art. 1575. If the obligation is one to pay a sum of money, damages for delay
in performance are subject to the following rules:

1. Conventional interest continues to run, if the conventional interest is
higher than the legal interest, or the legal interest begins to apply in
the contrary situation; saving the special rules authorizing the
collection of interest at the current rates in certain cases.

2. The creditor is not required to show prejudice when he collects
interest only; the fact of the delay is sufficient.

©

Delayed interest does not produce interest.

x&

The preceding rules apply to all kinds of incomes, land rents, and
periodic payments.

(Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation)

. Ecuador's legal expert has submitted that interest is only payable in the event of a

complete failure by the debtor to perform its obligation, not in the event of a mere delay
in payment. In addition, he holds that the delays were excused on the grounds of force
majeure, and that, in any case, public entities are not held to paying interest on delayed

payment, except if the delays disrupt the economic balance of the contract.

By contrast, Duke’s legal expert has submitted that interest was due as soon as a

delay was evidenced, and that the rule applied equally to public entities.

Having reviewed the legal opinions and Article 1575 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the
Tribunal comes to the conclusion that Ecuadorian law provides for a right to interest for
late payment irrespective of the public or private status of the debtor. The parties
themselves were well aware of this right when they acknowledged that the question of

61

256.

257.

258.

259.

260.

interest was disputed in the different agreements seeking to resolve their

disagreements”.

Moreover, the Tribunal finds no indication that interest would only accrue in the event
of a complete non-performance by the debtor and not already in the event of delayed
performance. Finally, as noted above, the Respondent has failed to demonstrate the

occurrence of force majeure.
(iii) Tribunal’s determination on reservation of interest

The Claimants argue that Clause 7 in fine of the 95 Liquidation Agreement and Clause
7.6 of the 96 Liquidation Agreement constitute a reservation of interest for late payment

of invoices. In their original versions, these provisions read as follows:

The parties reserve their right to claim their interests under the law.
(Cl. Exh. 22 and 24, English translation provided by the Claimants)

According to the Claimants, the Liquidation Agreements specifically enumerate each
party’s pending obligations and the corresponding amounts owed. The reference to
interest included after such enumeration is clearly designed to cover interest related to
the obligations listed in the Liquidation Agreements, not interest related to obligations
which are not the subject matter of the Liquidation Agreements (R. 1" PHB, 175).

The Respondent denies that these provisions constitute a reservation of the right to

claim interest for late payment.

The purpose of the Liquidation Agreements was to implement Clause 18.1 of PPA 95
and Clause 19.1 of PPA 96 which, in their relevant parts, read as follows:

After the expiration of [the term of] this Agreement, or if it has not been
possible to continue with the relationship created by this instrument, the
parties shall prepare and execute a Certificate of Settlement of Accounts
[...] stating in detail the technical and financial-accounting aspects thereof,
and also stating the volume of capacity and energy supplied during this
period, the amounts that INECEL has paid to the Contractor, and any
that remain to be paid to it, those that must be deducted or repaid, for any
reason, and applying the appropriate adjustments. For the purposes thereof,
any appropriate setoffs may be made. (Cl. Exh. 010 and 011, emphasis
added, Spanish original, Tribunal's translation)

The Tribunal is comforted in its decision by the MEM's acknowledgment that Electroquil had a
right to interest for non-payment by the State of its obligation, interest “that was legally
established in favor of that company” “ (Clause 7 “De /os intereses”, Reciprocal Obligations
Agreement, R. Exh. 059, Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation). This was further confirmed in
the Undisputed Amounts Interest Agreement (see infra 61).

Specifically, the 95 Liquidation Agreement states that the Contract Administrator had
authorized payment of Electroquil’s invoices, detailed in the appended financial
settlement, which inter alia took the Interim Liquidation Agreement (CI. Exh. 103, R.
Exh. 116) into consideration (Clause 6.2, Cl. Exh. 22). After calculating the balance for
fuel and transportation and the balance for power separately, the parties agreed upon a
final balance of USD 4,173,718.65 in favor of Electroquil (Clause 6.2.2). Clause 7 of
the 95 Liquidation Agreement went on to specify that it did “not resolve or settle any of
the matters submitted to arbitration’, i.e. the fines imposed under PPA 95. Clause 7 in
fine of the 95 Liquidation Agreement added the parties’ reservation of rights to claim

interest.

As for the 96 Liquidation Agreement, it followed in substance the same structure as the
95 version and determined that the final balance in favor of Electroquil amounted to
USD 96,980.64 (CI. Exh. 24).

The Liquidation Agreements were entered into to liquidate the PPAs. It is clear that the
liquidation included invoices unpaid or partially paid. Such invoices were taken into

account for the calculation of the final balance.

In light of the parties’ agreement upon the invoices paid by INECEL and Ecuador and
those pending within the liquidation phase of the PPAs, the Claimants’ argument
according to which Electroquil never approved payments or acknowledged receipt of
payments is unpersuasive. As a matter of fact, even prior to the Liquidation
Agreements, Electroquil had sent letters to INECEL acknowledging receipt of payment
of certain invoices although not systematically (see Annex NAV-18 and NAV-19 to
18'ER Kaczmarek).

At the same time, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that they expressly reserved
in the Liquidation Agreements the right to claim interest on the final balance owed after
settling the obligations pending under the PPAs, whether such obligations were the
payment of Electroquil’s invoices for the provision of power or the payment of fuel costs

and transportation.

As the Respondent rightly points out (R. 2" PHB, { 20), the reservation of interest was
only made with respect to the final amounts of USD 4,173,718.65 and USD 96,980.64
respectively set forth in the Liquidation Agreements. This view will be confirmed upon
examining the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement in conjunction with the Undisputed
Amounts Interest Agreement (see infra J 60-61).

271.

Since the Respondent accepts that a reservation of the right to claim interest was
made in the Liquidation Agreements, the Tribunal can dispense with examining the
Claimants’ additional arguments, i.e. that a reservation was made by way of the claim
brought to local arbitration and that the payment of late interest constitutes ordinary

business practice.
b) Alleged “waiver” to claim interest

The next issue that arises for determination is whether Duke’s claim for interest was
waived or settled by way of agreement, as the Respondent argues. The Tribunal will

proceed to examine in turn each of the agreements to which the parties referred.

First, the Interim Liquidation Agreement (Cl. Exh. 103, R. Exh. 116) was entered into
between the parties in 1999 for the purpose of settling the outstanding payment
obligations under the PPAs as a result of the liquidation of INECEL and the subrogation
of rights and obligations under the PPAs by the Ecuadorian Government through the
MEM (Recitals Interim Liquidation Agreement, point 6, p. 2).

The Claimants submit that the Interim Liquidation Agreement was not intended to deal
with interest. Had the parties wished to do so, whether by way of settlement or waiver,
they would have stated it. By contrast, the Respondent contends that the absence of
any mention of interest implies a waiver and that the presumption of Article 1611 of the

Civil Code applies.

In other words, the parties concur that interest is not mentioned in the Interim
Liquidation Agreement, but draw different consequences from that fact. As was set out
in connection with the Liquidation Agreements, if the creditor does not expressly
reserve the right to claim upon interest payment of the principal, interest is presumed to
be paid’. In the present instance, the Interim Liquidation Agreement contains no
reservation of interest. Therefore, the Tribunal will apply the presumption and conclude
that the Claimants lost their right to interest by not making an express reservation,
unlike what they did in the Liquidation Agreements with regard to the final balance. In
this latter respect, the Tribunal finds that the fact that interest was reserved for the final
amounts due under the PPAs in the Liquidation Agreements cannot reasonably be

overruled by a lack of reservation in prior agreements.

Although the parties have used the terms waiver, the Tribunal notes that Article 1611 contains a
presumption of payment of the interest when the creditor provides a receipt of payment without
reserving the right to claim for the interest.

64

272.

273.

274.

275.

276.

The latter reasoning equally applies to the Subrogation Agreements entered into
between the parties in 1999 (Cl. Exh. 17 and 18).

Further, the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement entered into between the parties and
Petroecuador provided for the extinction of Ecuador's obligation in favor of Electroquil
in the amount of USD 4,173,718.65 resulting from the 95 Liquidation Agreement, as
well as for the extinction of Electroquil’s obligation in favor of Petrocomercial in an
amount of USD 4,173,718.65 (Clause 4 of Reciprocal Obligations Agreement). In other
words, upon Electroquil’s request, the amount that Ecuador owed Electroquil was to be
transferred to Petrocomercial - which had a claim against Electroquil - with the effect of
extinguishing in part both Electroquil’s and Ecuador’s debts (Clause 1.11, Clause 2.1
and Clause 4 of Reciprocal Obligations Agreement). The Reciprocal Obligations
Agreement provided for the payment of interest in the amount of USD 4,173,718.65.

The Claimants contend that the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement did not lead to a
settlement or a waiver of any of their claims against Ecuador which are the subject
matter of the present arbitration. They assert that Duke’s claim for interest has been
preserved by virtue of Clause 7 of the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement. The
Respondent does not deny that the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement provided for the
payment of interest in the amount of USD 4,173,718.65. It alleges, however, that such
interest was paid under the Undisputed Amounts Interest Agreement (R. 2"? PHB,
423).

Clause 7 of the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement provides as follows:

The Ministry will recognize in favor of ELECTROQUIL the interest generated
by the untimely payment of the obligation specified in the first paragraph of
numeral 2.1 of the Second Clause of this agreement, which was legally
established in favor of that company.

In any case, interest will be stipulated in a separate agreement in
conjunction with those referred to in paragraph 2.3 of the Second Clause of
this agreement, in exactly the same terms as to the type of interest rate
applicable.

(Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation)

Clause 2.1, to which Clause 7 of the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement refers, reads
as follows:

In accordance with numeral 6.2.2 of the Sixth Clause of the Liquidation
Agreement of Contract No. 020/95, signed on November 27, 2001 between
representatives of the MINISTRY and ELECTROQUIL, the latter states
owing Electroquil the amount of US$ 4,173,718.65 [...].

For its part, the STATE manifests that, pursuant to Executive Decree No.
506, and in consideration to the Payment Trust referred to in numeral 6 of

278.

279.

280.

281.

282.

the First Clause, is a guarantor of payment of the MINISTRY'S obligations
with ELECTROQUIL.

(Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation)
Finally, the Undisputed Amounts Interest Agreement (R. Exh. 63) sought to implement
Clause 7 of the Reciprocal Obligations Agreement. In the former agreement, the
parties expressly agreed that interest was due to Electroquil (Clause 2.1 of the
Undisputed Amounts Interest Agreement). They also agreed upon the liquidation and
extinction of all interest claims in favor of Electroquil for late payment of the invoices for
fuel costs as referred to under Clause 7.4 of PPA 95 (Clause 3 of the Undisputed

Amounts Interest Agreement).

The Undisputed Amounts Interest Agreement makes it clear that no interest can be
claimed for the amounts pending under PPA 95 in accordance with the 95 Liquidation

Agreement.

It follows that interest is only due upon the amount of USD 96,980.64 set forth in the 96
Liquidation Agreement. Indeed, the presumption of Article 1611 is rebutted with respect

to this Agreement as a result of an express reservation (see supra {| 265).

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that interest for late payment of Electroquil’s invoices
cannot be claimed in light of the presumption of Article 1611, subject to interest on the
amount of USD 96,980.64 arising out of the 96 Liquidation Agreement.

4.1.3 Fines and penalties imposed during the execution of the PPAs

The Tribunal will begin by reviewing the parties’ general allegations in respect of the
imposition of fines and penalties (a) and the applicable provisions of the PPAs (b). It
will subsequently analyze the arguments raised in connection with each of the

contested fines (c).
a) Parties’ positions

According to the Claimants, both PPAs expressly excused technical breaches by
Electroquil under specific circumstances. While certain circumstances may have
permitted the imposition of a fine, in almost every instance, other circumstances were
also present which justified not imposing the fine. Ecuador's imposition of fines under
circumstances where its own contractual breaches caused Electroquil’s technical
defaults was clearly improper and runs contrary to the spirit of Clause 12.4 of PPA 95
and Clause 13.4 of PPA 96.

66

283.

284.

285.

286.

287.

288.

289.

The Claimants further argue that, aside from the clauses referred to above and the
general provisions of the PPAs governing the settlement of contractual disputes, the
PPAs were silent with regard to how fines were to be imposed and collected. Ecuador
was not entitled to offset the fine amounts from invoices due and payable to Electroquil.
Furthermore, the PPAs did not contemplate any lump sum imposition and collection of
fines at the expiry of the PPAs.

For its part, Ecuador argues that INECEL’s right to impose fines upon Electroquil was
granted to INECEL in order to ensure the proper performance of the PPAs. The PPAs
set out specific situations that would justify the imposition of the fines, especially
insufficient energy supply within a certain time limit and under certain technical
circumstances. Thus, as soon as the relevant facts justifying imposition of a fine
occurred, INECEL was entitled to exercise its rights, which were in no way limited or
time-barred, under the PPAs.

Furthermore, as already indicated Ecuador submits that there was no impediment to

set-off pursuant to Article 1671 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code.

Before examining the parties’ arguments and each fine in detail, the Tribunal considers

it of use to briefly review the grounds for penalties set forth in the PPAs.
b) Contractual regime
Pursuant to Article 12 of PPA 95, INECEL can impose a fine for:

. shortfalls between the availability guaranteed in the contract and the actual

availability for each unit (Clause 12.1);
. excessive fuel consumption (Clause 12.2);
. failure to reach the guaranteed output (Clause 12.3); and
. delays in start-up (Clause 12.7).

The penalties under PPA 95 were to be calculated once a year and paid within 15
days. They could not exceed 5% of the value of PPA 95 (Clause 12.6). Clause 12.4 of
PPA 95 specified that no fine could be imposed if Electroquil’s defaults were due to

force majeure, an act of God or for duly proven reasons not attributable to Electroquil.
Pursuant to Article 13 of the PPA 96, INECEL can impose a fine for:

. delays in start-up (Clause 13.1);

67

. failure to meet the energy generation quotas or excessive fuel consumption
(Clause 13.2); and

. shortfall in availability (Clause 13.3).

290. The penalties under PPA 96 were to be paid on a monthly basis and could not exceed
5% of the total value of PPA 96 (Clauses 13.5 and 13.6). No penalty could be imposed
under PPA 96 in the event that the defaults were proven not to be attributable to
Electroquil (Clause 13.4).

291.

Taking the main arguments and contractual provisions referred to above into
consideration, the Tribunal will examine each fine and the specific objections thereto in

the table below.

Based on the foregoing, the
Claimants submit that Electroquil’s
failure to commence operations
under PPA 95 on time is excused
due to (i) the existence of “events not
attributable to Electroquil’; and (ii) the
Ecuadorian Government's own failure
to fulfill its obligations under PPA 95
(“exceptio non adimpleti contractus’).

It is undisputed that Units 1 and 2 commenced commercial
operation on 10 May 1996 instead of 31 March 1996 as
provided for under the PPA 95. That is 40 days later than the
contract date. Under Clause 17.7, 40 days of delay results in a
USD 200,000 penalty for each unit and to USD 400,000 for
both.

2. The fine imposed amounted to USD 400,000. The Claimants
contend that the USD 200,000 balance was offset against
Electroquil's invoice No. 002 which was inadmissible.

Notwithstanding the fact that set-off is deemed admissible, the
Claimants have not demonstrated how Fine No.
improperly set-off or what the ensuing amount would be, had
there been ineffective set-off.

Furthermore, the record does not show that the Claimants
objected to set-off at the time Fine No. 1 was imposed.

3. The Claimants further argue that Electroquil’s failure to
commence operations under PPA 95 on time was excused due
to force majeure and the existence of “events not attributable to
Electroquil’, i.e. an alleged snow storm in Washington, D.C.

Clause 19 of PPA 95 provided that force majeure was to be
defined under Article 30 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (i.e.
unforeseeable event, which is not possible to resist, such as
shipwreck, earthquake, seizure by enemies, acts of authority,
etc) and that any such event should be notified to the other
party within 10 days following its together with an

explanation as to how it affected the performance of PPA 95
and supporting documents. It appears from a letter of 31 July
1996 (R. Exh. 14) that Electroquil initially referred to the event
in a letter dated 25 January 1996. However, there is no
convincing evidence on record that the Claimants explained
how such an event affected the performance of PPA 95.

4. With respect to the Claimants’ objection to Fine No. 1 based
upon the exceptio non adimpleti contractus, Clause 5.0.1 of the
PPA 95 and 5.1 of the PPA 96 make it clear that Electroquil
had exclusive responsibility for the timely start-up of the
generation units. It was Electroquil’s risk and duty to import,
assemble, install, operate and maintain the turbines. Electroquil
committed in its offer of 16 August 1995 to the installment of
two new generation units by 31 December 1995 (PPA 95,
Clause 2.0.2). Electroquil’s obligation in this respect does not
appear to be directly linked to the Payments Trusts. There
seems to be no correlation between INECEL's obligation to pay
for the energy provided by Electroquil and the latter's
obligations to start the commercial operations of the units under
the PPAs.

In addition, contrary to the Claimants’ assertion, the record
does not show that the manufacturer refused to ship the
turbines because the 95 Payment Trust was not set up. The
evidence shows that Electroquil and the manufacturer
corresponded regarding the delay in shipment, but it does not
establish any causation with the failure to constitute the 95
Payment Trust prior to commercial operation (Cl. Exh. 034,
035, 037, 039, 041 and 042). The testimony of Mr. Tumbaco, of
Electroquil’s accounting division, does not alter this finding. His
mere recollection of an alleged document evidencing the
manufacturer's insistence as to the establishment of the 95
Payment Trust does not convince the Tribunal, absent any
such document on record (Tr. pp. 442-444). As for Mr. Larrea’s
testimony, his analysis of the Claimants’ Exhibits 034, 037 and
039 does not prove that the manufacturer actually subordinated
shipment to the constitution of the 95 Payment Trust (Tr. pp.

 

 

 

 

 

 

235-237). Upon reading Claimants’ Exhibit 037 in

Claimants

Respondent

Findings of the Tribunal

 

with Claimants’ Exhibit 039, it cannot be established that the
manufacturer made the shipment conditional upon the Payment
Trusts. Actually, the Minutes of the Board of Directors of
Electroquil, dated 4 October 1995, and attached to PPA 95,
mention under point 4 that the contract with Stewart and
Stevenson would become effective after the 15% down
payment, which was delayed because of Stewart and
Stevenson itself. The latter was to make a loan for the turbines
in the event the financing could not be obtained from
Eximbank. To accelerate the process, Electroquil decided to
make the 15% down payment through a bridge loan. No
mention was made of any Payment Trust in this document,
which was issued prior to the conclusion of PPA 95. As a
result, the bridge loan referred to in Claimants’ Exhibit 039 had
no connection with the absence of the Payment Trust. Mr.
Larrea confirms in his testimony that “a manufacturer can't
impose such conditions” (Tr. p. 206).

The Tribunal is of the view that the PPAs did not permit
Electroquil to delay commencement of commercial operations
on the grounds of the belated constitution of the Payment
Trusts. In addition, the Claimants have not shown that the
failure to put the 95 Payment Trust into place actually led to the
delay in the start-up of Units 1 and 2. Accordingly, the exceptio
non adimpleti contractus does not apply.

On the basis of the foregoing considerations, Fine No. 1
was justified under the circumstances.

the result of its lack of cash flow in
view of Ecuador's late payments
under PPA 95 and the difficulties to
obtain financing to purchase Units 3
and 4, which stemmed from the
Government's failure to implement
the Payment Trusts.

 

 

2. Fine No. 2 was allegedly offset against Electroquil’s invoice
No. 137. Given that set-offs are considered admissible within
the framework of the PPAs (see above), the Claimants’
argument in this respect does not succeed. At any rate, the
Claimants fail to demonstrate how set-off was improperly
implemented in that particular instance and what the ensuing
amount would have been had it not been offset.

3. The Claimants also argue that Electroquil’s failure to
commence commercial operation on time was caused by its
lack of cash flow, itself the result of Ecuador's late payments
under PPA 95 and the Government's failure to implement the
96 Payment Trust.

In this respect, the record shows that Electroquil advised
INECEL several times of its financial difficulties and the need
for the 96 Payment Trust (Cl. Exh. 052, 061 and 062).

A first letter of 2 September 1996 from Electroquil to INECEL
related to the lack of payment of certain invoices under PPA 95
leading to cash flow concerns and the necessity to implement
the 95 Payment Trust. Such document cannot per se constitute
evidence of events not attributable to INECEL within the
meaning of Clause 13.1 of PPA 96, as it relates to PPA 95 and
circumstances arising thereunder.

On the other hand, two other letters dated 6 January 1997 and
3 April 1997 from Electroquil to INECEL, indicate that
Electroquil informed INECEL of the risk of encountering
financial difficulties, bringing the performance of Units 3 and 4
to a standstill.

As seen above, irrespective of the fact that actual financial
difficulties have not been established, the Tribunal is of the
view that the PPAs do not permit Electroquil, as contractor, to
delay performance on the grounds of the belated of

the Payment Trusts.
Fine No. 2 is thus justified because no delay attributable to
INECEL within the meaning of Clause 13.1 of PPA 96 has been
established.
4. Finally, the Claimants argue that Fine No. 2 was time-barred,
because Clause 13.5 provided that the penalties were to be
paid monthly by Electroquil. In the Tribunal’s view, this
provision cannot be interpreted as barring the assessment of a
penalty at a different time during the performance of PPA 96.
Therefore, under the circumstances, Fine No. 2 was
justified.

without explaining how the set-off affected that amount. The
Claimants’ argument is essentially that Ecuador arbitrarily
interrupted Electroquil’s cash flow by offsetting the fines, which
has not been substantiated (Cl. 1°" PHB, pp. 46-48).

3. The Claimants further argue that the imposition of Fines No.
3 and 4 was ill-founded, because the low generation quotas
were due to force majeure or to events not attributable to them,
i.e. to the poor quality of the fuel causing turbine corrosion.

Clause 8.4 of PPA 96 provided that INECEL would bear the
fuel costs but Electroquil would purchase the fuel, in the
present instance, from Petrocomercial in accordance with the
Fuel Supply Agreement (Cl. Exh. 048).

Clause 13.4 of PPA 96 provides that a fine could not be
imposed if reasons for the fuel shortage not attributable to
Electroquil could be proven.

Clause 21 of PPA 96 provides that force majeure was to be
defined by reference to Article 30 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code
(i.e. unforeseeable event, which is not possible to resist, such
as shipwreck, earthquake, seizure by enemies, acts of
authority, etc) and that any such event should be notified to the
other party within 10 days following its occurrence together with
an explanation as to how it affected the performance of PPA 95
and supporting documents.

The record shows that Electroquil warned INECEL about the
poor fuel quality and the impact on the corroded turbine (Cl.
Exh. 079 and 082), which it regarded as a force majeure event.
The Tribunal would tend to agree with INECEL’s response in
this respect (Cl. Exh. 085). The interruption of the plant
operation cannot constitute force majeure within the meaning of
Clause 21 of PPA 96, since the corroded unit was still under
the manufacturer's warranty and repairable (Cl. Exh. 079).

Having said that, one should consider the underlying cause of
corrosion, i.e. the poor fuel quality. The record shows that
Electroquil was not in a position to test the fuel, as INECEL was

of availability: Unit 1 was available for
over 8,500 hours that year and Unit 2
was available for over 8,200 hours.

Notwithstanding the unambiguous
language governing hours of
unavailability under PPA 95, a self-
serving definition of unavailability was
applied. Indeed, INECEL interpreted
unavailability under PPA 95 to be
those periods in which units were
requested and were not able to
operate, regardless of compliance
with the 7,500 hours of guaranteed
availability. INECEL consequently
pointed to 140.4 hours (Unit 1) and
408.7 hours (Unit 2), as periods
during the first year of operation, in
which the turbines needed to be
operable, but were not. INECEL's
interpretation of the contract
misreads the plain meaning of the
terms of PPA 95.

Moreover, even if this Tribunal allows

performance of PPA 95 (Cl. Exh. 090). On one hand, INECEL
alleged that unavailability time corresponded to periods in
which units were not able to operate upon request, regardless
of the 7,500 hours of guaranteed availability. On the other
hand, Electroquil considered that Clause 12.1 of PPA 95 was
clear in that the penalty was to be based upon the difference
between guaranteed and actual availability.

2. Clause 4.1 of PPA 95 provides in substance that the terms of
PPA 95 were to be interpreted literally or in the context thereof
so as to determine the intent of the parties.

Availability was defined under PPA 95 as the number of hours
annually during which each unit was available for commercial
operation (Clause 4.3 PPA 95).

In light of the above, it is clear that Clause 12.1 referred to the
difference between the guaranteed and actual available hours
of commercial operation, irrespective of any request, as the
Respondent alleges. INECEL's interpretation of unavailability
cannot be followed.

The Claimants have established that the hours of availability for
the first operating year were 8,580.3 for Unit 1 and 8,213.9 for
Unit 2 (Cl. Exh. 090).

attached to PPA 95, namely diesel No. 2 at an unsubsidized

the definition provided under Clause 4.3 of PPA 95.

use its influence in connection with the execution of an
agreement between Petrocomercial and Electroquil in order to
guarantee the timely provision of No. 2 diesel fuel, which
eventually led to the Fuel Supply Agreement (Cl. Exh. 048).
INECEL was to reimburse Electroquil for the cost of the
purchased fuel (Clause 7.4 PPA 95).

However, from September 1996 until 31 March 1999, INECEL
took over the purchase of fuel from Petrocomercial and
delivered it to Electroquil (Clause 6.2.1 95 Liquidation
Agreement; Cl. Exh. 022).

During that period, Electroquil informed INECEL of the poor
quality of the fuel, that it was contrary to contract specifications
and of the related consequences (CI. Exh. 064; Exh. R-24; Tr.
507;16-21).

In light of the above, Electroquil was not in a position to check
the quality of the fuel Petrocomercial provided to INECEL.

As to Ecuador's arguments that Electroquil could have taken
measures to remedy the deficient fuel quality or that such fuel
could have been purchased elsewhere, the record shows that
on the one hand, certain remedial measures (e.g. centrifuging),
which were taken pursuant to Clause 15.2 of PPA 95, could not
fully correct the problem, and on the other hand,
Petrocomercial had a de facto monopoly over the fuel in
Ecuador (Tr. 190:16-191:2, 509:2-511:3).

As a result, the Tribunal considers that the poor fuel
quality leading to the excessive fuel consumption was not
attributable to Electroquil, and that Fine No. 6 was not
justified under the circumstances.

Respondent fails to acknowledge,
however, its role in preventing
Electroquil from installing the chillers

defaults which prevented the timely
acquisition and installation of the
chillers. Moreover, Electroquil was
unable to install the chillers on time
due to circumstances beyond its
control, specifically the failure of the

at the time operations commenced until the difference was

The Claimants do not challenge the calculation of Fine No. 7
but dispute the alleged set-off operated in the fine itself against
invoices No. 135, 149 and 150.

2. Set-off being considered as admissible (see above), the
Tribunal may dispense with examining the Claimants’ argument
in this respect. At any rate, the document the Claimants rely
upon (Cl. Exh. 091) does not reflect such set-off. Further, the
Claimants do not provide any explanation or documentation to
show how set-off was improperly operated.

3. The Claimants further argue that it was INECEL's payment
default which prevented the timely acquisition and installation
of the chillers. In addition, Electroquil was unable to install the
chillers on time due to the manufacturer's failure to deliver the
chillers on time.

Commercial operation of Units 1 and 2 began on 10 May 1996
(R. Exh. 12), with the result that the chillers were to be
operational five months later, ie. on 10 October 1996, pursuant
to Clause 5.1 of PPA 95.

The record shows that, on 22 April 1996, Electroquil informed
INECEL of the delay in the delivery of the chillers (Cl. Exh.
043).

On 28 October 1996, Electroquil informed INECEL that the
chillers were available at the Plant but could not be installed in
the absence of sufficient funds due to INECEL's payment
defaults. Electroquil added that it would proceed to install the
chillers as soon as INECEL made the required payment (R.
Exh. 33).

The record shows that the Respondent failed to make timely
payments of some of Electroquil’s invoices (see supra Section
D(b)(cc)(b) above). Having said this, causation with the alleged
ensuing delay in installing the chillers has not been

Electroquil’s breaches at the end of
each operating year. The Claimants
claim, however, that the delays in
imposing these fines — over three
years in the case of the operating-
year-2 fines — were attributable to the
time it took for the parties to fully
discuss those fines. In view of the
fact that the operating-year-5 fines
were discussed, disputed, and
imposed all within four months
following the end of that operating
year, it is clear that the delay with
Tespect to the fines for the other
operating years was arbitrary, as well
as retaliatory, in light of the local
arbitration between the parties. In
addition, the fines for operating years
2 and 3 ran contrary to the Interim
Liquidation Agreement settling all
accounts for the first operating year
fines up to 31 March 1999.

Further, Electroquil’s unavailability of
Unit 2 was directly attributable to
Ecuador, as a result of the low quality
fuel it supplied to Electroquil, which in
tum caused, as Ecuador has
acknowledged, corrosion on Unit 2
and its discontinuance, as well as
excessive fuel consumption.

 

Pursuant to the parties’ common
liquidation of operating years 2 to
5, a 4,487.35-hour unavailability
was determined giving rise to Fine
No. 8 in the amount of USD
2,243,675. In this respect, the
Respondent further alleges that
Electroquil was expected to test
the quality of the —_ fuel
Petrocomercial provided and was
in a position to take measures in
order to remedy the alleged poor
fuel quality. In addition, the fuel
could have been purchased from
entities other than Petrocomercial.

According to Ecuador, the account
liquidation also established an
excessive fuel consumption during
operating years 2 to 4, giving rise
to Fine No. 9 in the amount of
USD 1,019,033, as well as the
failure to reach the warranted
output, giving rise to Fine No. 10
in the amount of USD 204,542.

None of those fines were, in
Ecuador's view, untimely. The
PPAs contemplate _ specific.
circumstances that justify the
imposition of fines, which is not in

 

the timing of such fines. Fines No. 8 to 10 were imposed on 14
August 2001.

Clause 12.5 of PPA 95 provides:

Penalties shall be calculated once a year and shall be paid
by the Contractor within fifteen (15) days after notice from
INECEL. If a penalty is not paid within the stipulated period
of time, the appropriate portion of the performance bond
shall be enforced.

The record shows that the parties jointly drafted tiguidatlon
reports at the end of operating years 2 and 3 (R. Exh. 42, R.
Exh. 43). Such reports, together with the one relating to
operating year 4, were in turn approved by the operation
committee in January 2001 (R. Exh. 44).

Even though the reports were only approved in 2001, Ecuador
was in a position to assess the fines based upon the elements
contained in the reports at the end of each operating year.
However, Ecuador did not do so until 14 August 2001, that is
after expiration of the term of PPA 95.

2. As for the Claimants’ argument based on the Interim
Liquidation Agreement, the Tribunal fails to see how it settled
the accounts for the first operating year fines up to 31 March
1999, given that the parties agreed to refer the then current
claim for penalties to local arbitration (Cl. Exh. 103).
Furthermore, the Claimants have not established that the fines
were in fact retaliatory, in view of this local arbitration.

3. Finally, the Claimants argue that the underlying events were
not attributable to Electroquil given the poor fuel quality. The

that there is

October and November 2001 was the
result of a countrywide fuel shortage,
which directly affected Electroquil’s
ability to operate during those

amounts in R. Exh. 104 is equal to that imposed in R. Exh. 100
so that the issue of reduction raised by the Respondent (R. 1*
PHB, p. 44) becomes moot.

2. On the other hand, the Claimants dispute the alleged set-off
operated in the fine itself against certain invoices, without
providing any indication as to specifically which invoices are
involved. Since set-off was deemed admissible, this argument
fails.

3. The Claimants further rely on Clause 13.4 of PPA 96,
providing that a fine could not be imposed if reasons not
attributable to Electroquil could be duly proven.

First, there is no element on record evidencing the alleged
countrywide fuel sroraoe

Second, Fine No. was imposed in 2001, with the
consequence that tne folowing provisions of PPA 96 govern
the issue.

Clause 8.4 of PPA 96 provides that, while INECEL would bear
the fuel costs, Electroquil would purchase the fuel, in the
present instance, from Petrocomercial, in accordance with the
Fuel Supply Agreement.

Further, Clause 15.6 stipulates that, in addition to installing all
equipment for fuel supply and storage, Electroquil was to
maintain a reserve sufficient to allow the operation of the plant
for 7 days at base load.

As for the Fuel Supply Agreement, it provides that Electroquil

fuel and the maintenance of the related equipment (Clause 3.1

Therefore, considering that Electroquil was responsible for
the fuel supply at the time of Fine No. 11 and that no
grounds for exoneration have been established, Fine No.
11 was justified.

the other fines.

4.1.4 The Med-Arb Agreements and the local arbitration
a) Parties’ positions

The Claimants consider that a final and binding award on the matter of jurisdiction and
on the validity of the Med-Arb Agreements was rendered on 20 September 2001 (Exh.
C-45 RforA) and was reversed on 11 March 2002 (Exh. C-44 RforA, Cl. Exh. 23). They
submit that there was no legitimate reason for the local arbitral tribunal to revisit sua
sponte its decision on jurisdiction. Further, the Claimants assert that the Attorney-

General failed to honor the State's arbitration commitment.

Ecuador asserts that the arbitration proceedings under the 2000 Med-Arb Agreements
constituted a local proceeding subject to local law, and that the Attorney-General was
thus entitled to raise the nullity of the Med-Arb Agreement. The Attorney-General's
previous statement that the disputes between INECEL and Electroquil could be
submitted to arbitration was conditional upon compliance with the rules governing
arbitration and mediation. The Respondent further submits that international law does
not prohibit a State from invoking the nullity of an arbitration provision pursuant to
national law, as provided in the New York Convention and the UNCITRAL Model Law.

In addition, the Respondent denies any involvement in the making of the award of
March 2002. It emphasizes that the local arbitral tribunal conducted the proceedings
under the auspices of the Guayaquil Chamber of Commerce, a private entity which has
no connection with the State.

b) Tribunal’s determination

The Tribunal will first examine whether INECEL and/or Ecuador have violated any of
the provisions of the PPAs, Ecuadorian law or the Med-Arb Agreements.

By letter dated 18 August 1998, INECEL asked Ecuador's Attorney-General for an
opinion as to its capacity to submit any disputes with Electroquil to local arbitration (Cl.
Exh. 013, R. Exh. 039). On 9 September 1998, the Attorney-General answered:

The arbitration agreement may be made independently of the contract, or it

judgment in the ordinary judicial process, in which case the opinion of the
Office of the Attorney General of the State is required.

Pursuant to Rule 18 of the Article 7 of the Civil Code, the laws in effect at the
time of executing the contract are understood to be part and parcel thereof,
except for laws concerning the manner of bringing forth a legal claim with
regard to the rights acquired in the contract.

The Law of Arbitration and Mediation having been issued with specific
procedures and without establishing any limitation on extra-judicial resolution
of controversies, provided that there is no pending trial on the matters about
which you have consulted me, | consider it pertinent to proceed pursuant to
the regulations of that Law.

(Cl. Exh. 014, R. Exh. 040, Spanish original, English translation provided by

the Claimants)
This letter is expressly quoted in paragraph 1.5 of the Med-Arb Agreements entered
into one and a half years later on 30 May 2000. It appears from the record that the
parties did not consult the Attorney-General on the text of the agreements at that time.
They rather relied upon the answer given by the Attorney-General in 1998 before the
disputes had fully arisen. As noted by the local arbitral tribunal in its award,
“[c]onsequently, in this proceeding, it has not been demonstrated that any consultation
or opinion whatsoever, with respect to the texts of the arbitration agreements signed on
May 30, 2000 have been carried out’ (Cl. Exh. 023, Spanish original, English
translation provided by the Claimants).

Article 4 of the 1997 Mediation and Arbitration Law of Ecuador requires that the parties
seek the determination of the Attorney-General prior to submitting an existing dispute
with a public sector entity to arbitration. Article 4 reads as follows:

Art. 4.- All individuals and legal persons with capacity may submit to
arbitration under this Law and the requirements herein established. In
addition to the requirements addressed in this Law, public sector entities
shall meet the following requirements to be entitled to submit a dispute to
arbitration:

they shall have entered into an arbitration agreement before the dispute
arises;

where the arbitration agreement is to be signed after the dispute arises, the
Attorney-General shall be requested to render an opinion and
compliance with such opinion shall be complulsory;

the legal relationship to which the arbitration agreement refers, shall be of a
contractual nature;

the arbitration agreement shall include the method by which arbitrators are
to be appointed;

the arbitration agreement by which the public sector Institution waives its
right to recourse to the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts shall be
signed by a person authorized to contract on behalf of said institution.

Failure to comply with the above requirements shall result in the invalidity of

the arbitration agreement.

(Cl. Exh. 071, Spanish original, Tribunal's translation)

83

300.

301.

303.

The parties did not consult the Attorney-General prior to proceeding to arbitration. As a
result, the local tribunal ruled that the arbitration agreement was invalid. It did so in
reliance upon Article 1724 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, which provides that “any act or
contract which lacks any of the requirements prescribed by law for the validity of the act
or contract itself, according to its type and the capacity of status of the parties, is null
and void” (Cl. Exh. 023, Spanish original, English translation provided by the
Claimants). It is true that the procedure followed by the local arbitral tribunal which first
accepted jurisdiction by two “firm decisions”, to later dismiss the case for lack of
jurisdiction, is at best surprising. Be this as it may, it is not disputed that the local
arbitral tribunal was a private body acting under the aegis of the Guayaquil Chamber of
Commerce, which is a private entity as well. There is no indication on record that the

conduct of the local tribunal may be attributed to the State.

By contrast, the acts of the MEM or the Attorney-General are attributable to Ecuador.
Did they breach the PPAs, Ecuadorian law or the Med-Arb Agreements by raising a
defense of lack of jurisdiction and thus negating the consent given by the MEM?

Article 4 of the Mediation and Arbitration Law is clear when it subjects the conclusion of
an arbitration agreement with a public sector entity after a dispute has arisen to the
prior mandatory consultation of the Attorney-General. This requirement was not met
when the MEM and Electroquil entered into the Med-Arb Agreements in 2000. The
Tribunal does not understand the Attorney-General’s opinion of 1998 to lift the
requirements of the Arbitration Law. Hence, on the face of Article 4 of the Mediation
and Arbitration Law, the Tribunal cannot identify a violation of Ecuadorian law. It does
not observe a violation of the PPAs either as the PPAs contained no arbitration clause.
Similarly, it finds no violation of the Med-Arb Agreements, which provided for arbitration
in Ecuador and were thus subject to Ecuadorian law, specifically to the Arbitration Law

including its Article 4.

Having said that, the Tribunal has asked itself whether it should go further and review
whether Ecuadorian law contains other provisions which would lead to a different
conclusion. In this respect, it notes that it has not been alleged by the Claimants that
Ecuadorian law contains any provision to the effect that the State or a State entity
cannot object to the validity of an arbitration clause to which it has agreed. While the
Claimants briefly mention in their Memorial the doctrine of venire contra factum
proprium or common law estoppel (Cl. Mem., § 236), they do not allege that it applies
under Ecuadorian law in the context of a local proceeding. Indeed, it is critical to note
here that the arbitration at issue was a domestic and not an international arbitration.

84

304.

305.

306.

307.

Because of the parties’ contractual choice of law, which includes “the applicable
principles of International Law’, the Tribunal has further asked itself whether it should
resort to the widely accepted international principle that a State cannot invoke its own
law to resist international arbitration’. The parties’ choice of law leaves broad
discretion to the Tribunal to determine which of the chosen legal systems shall govern
a specific issue**. In the present instance, the issue hinges upon the validity of an
arbitration clause providing for domestic arbitration under municipal law. It appears in
conformity with the nature of the issue to submit it to Ecuadorian rather than to
international law.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that the Attorney-General and the MEM did not
breach the PPAs, Ecuadorian law and the Med-Arb Agreements. This conclusion does
not foreclose the possibility of a violation under the BIT discussed below (J 384-404).

4.1.5 Did Ecuador fail to act in good faith?
a) Parties’ positions

The Claimants allege in their Memorial in Chief that by not implementing the Payment
Trusts in a timely manner, by breaching the PPAs’s penalty regimes, by defaulting on
its payment obligations, by imposing customs duties and by breaching the Med-Arb

Agreements, Ecuador at the same time breached its obligation of good faith.

The Claimants argue that Article 1562 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code provides for
performance of contracts in good faith. This obligation to perform in good faith also
stems “from a general duty of the administration and the government to comply with the
social policies that support the activities conducted or obtained through contracts” (Cl.
Mem., 4 165, referring to the legal opinion filed by Mr. Ponce Martinez). Therefore, the
Claimants contend that the duty of good faith is a primary and independent duty under
international and Ecuadorian law. The duty to perform in good faith is heightened when
the State undertakes obligations towards a private party in furtherance of a public
purpose since it is the custodian of the public interest. Accordingly, the PPAs were a
See e.g, Framatome SA et al. v. Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, (Prof. Berthold Goldman,
Pres., Prof. Jacques Robert, Prof. Pierre Lalive), Award on Jurisdiction, 30 April 1982, ICC Case
No. 3896, J.D.I. 72 (1984); Benteler v. Belgium, Award, 18 November 1983, 1989 Rev. arb. 239

ICCA New York Arbitration Congress 1986, at p. 295. See also Veijo Heskanen, May a State
invoke its domestic law to evade its international obligations?, TDM, Vol. 2, November 2005.

The Tribunal need not discuss here the application of Article 42 of the ICSID Convention since
the choice of law of the parties includes both Ecuadorian law and the applicable principles of
international law.

means for the State to carry out its legal, social and economic obligations to provide

adequate levels of electric power to the people of Ecuador.

While its legal expert, Dr. Parraguez Ruiz, acknowledges the existence of the principle
of good faith in the Ecuadorian Civil Code, the Respondent denies having breached its
duty to act in good faith.

b) Tribunal’s determination

With regard to the performance of the PPAs and the subsequent agreements pursuant
to Ecuadorian law, the Tribunal found no indication in the record according to which

Ecuador would not have complied with the principle of good faith.

The position is less evident with respect to the Med-Arb Agreements. The conduct of
the Attorney-General could be deemed an improper interference in Ecuador's
performance of the Agreements. However, since it concluded that the Attorney-General
acted in accordance with Ecuadorian law and did not breach the Med-Arb Agreements,
the Tribunal rules out any bad faith conduct in this context as well.

Did Ecuador violate the BIT?

4.2.1 Issues to be determined

. The Tribunal has found that INECEL and Ecuador violated the PPAs provisions and

Ecuadorian law by the late establishment and the poor implementation of the Payment
Trusts, the irregular imposition of certain fines and penalties, and the non-payment of
interest in connection with the amounts due under the 96 Liquidation Agreement. In this
section, the Tribunal will determine whether such violations, together with Ecuador's
conduct in relation to the claims covered by the Arbitration Agreement, constitute
breaches of the applicable principles of international law and, in particular, of the BIT
standards.

In doing so, the Tribunal will pay close attention to the State’s conduct in light of its
contractual and international undertakings. Accordingly, the Tribunal will establish
whether said conduct resulted in (i) a breach of Ecuador's obligations with regard to the
Claimants’ investments pursuant to Article II(3)(c) of the BIT (4.2.2); (ii) unfair and
inequitable treatment of the investment pursuant to Article II(3)(a) of the BIT (4.2.3); (iii)
arbitrary treatment pursuant to Article II(3)(b) of the BIT (4.2.4); and (iv) a denial of
justice for having failed to arbitrate disputes locally pursuant to Article II(7) of the BIT
(4.2.5).

86

313.

314.

315.

316.

Before turning to the analysis of these issues, the Tribunal will recall the content of the
relevant provisions of the BIT, i.e. Articles II(3) and II(7):
3. (a) Investment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment,

shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be
accorded treatment less than that required by international law.

(b) Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory
the ‘ -

acquisition, expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of
dispute resolution under Articles VI and VII, a measure may be
arbitrary or discriminatory notwithstanding the fact that a party has
had or has exercised the opportunity to review such measures in the
courts or administrative tribunals of a Party.

(c) Each Party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with
regard to investments.

Le]

7. Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and
enforcing rights with respect to investment, investment agreements,
and investment authorizations.

4.2.2 Did Ecuador violate the duty to observe obligations entered into with
respect to the investment (Art. II(3)(c) of the BIT)?

a) Parties’ positions

The Claimants submit that Ecuador has breached the Payment Guarantee Decree, the
Payment Trusts, the PPAs and the Med-Arb Agreements and that these instruments
embody obligations in connection with the investment within the meaning of Article
11(3)(c) of the BIT.

According to the Claimants, the Tribunal must identify Ecuador’s obligations in
connection with their investment. For the purpose of such identification, the Claimants
rely on Eureko B.V. v. Republic of Poland to claim that any and all obligations entered
into with regard to the investment fall under the umbrella clause. They add that cases
concerning the scope of an umbrella clause, such as Noble Ventures, Inc. v. Romania,
uphold the view that all host-State obligations are covered by the umbrella clause, not
only acts performed in the exercise of sovereign powers. Such conclusion is said to be
further supported by the interpretation of umbrella clauses derived from the 1992 US
Model BIT.

By contrast, Ecuador contends that mere contractual disputes should not be decided in
accordance with the principles of international law by virtue of an umbrella clause such
as Article II(3)(c) of the BIT. For the latter to apply, the Claimants would have to show
that Ecuador either interfered with the contractual obligations at stake in its sovereign

capacity and thus altered the legal framework of the investment, or disregarded in any

87

317.

318.

319.

320.

way such obligations. In light of E/ Paso v. Argentine Republic, Ecuador denies any
extensive interpretation of the BIT umbrella clause and thus of its obligations (R. Reply,
49. 217-218, R. 2 PHB, § 46).

b) Tribunal’s determination
Art. Il(3)(c) reads as follows:

Each party shall observe any obligation it may have entered into with regard
to investments.

On its face and bearing in mind Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, which requires
interpretation to be “in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given
to the terms of the treaty’, the conditions for a breach of this article are that (i) there
exists an “obligation” of the State which is (ii) “entered into with regard to investments”

and which (iii) has not been observed.

The significance of umbrella clauses has been heavily debated since SGS Société
Générale de Surveillance SA v. Pakistan and no consistent view has emerged from
cases so far. Whether an umbrella clause in a BIT necessarily elevates any breach of
contract by a State to the level of a breach of treaty is a controversial question. Indeed,
some tribunals have included into the scope of an umbrella clause contractual
obligations such as payment™ when others have favored obligations assumed through

law or regulation’®.

Another open question is whether sovereign interference is needed to constitute a
breach of an umbrella clause. While, as indicated by Respondent, language to that
effect appears in some cases such as CMS v. Argentina®® and Pan American Energy &
BP v. Argentina and El Paso v. Argentina’’ a majority of decisions do not formulate

such distinction.

See e.g. Fedax N.V. v. Venezuela, ICSID Case No. ARB/96/3, Award, 9 March 1998, § 29 and

323.

324.

Given the circumstances of this case, this Tribunal need not address such issues here.
First, it notes that the wording of Article II(3)(c) is broad as it refers to “any obligation”.
Second, there is an express agreement by the parties in the Arbitration Agreement that
the BIT applies to contract disputes relating to the imposition of fines and claims during
the execution of the PPAs.

Third, an executive decree was specifically issued when Ecuador decided to assume
INECEL’s rights and obligations under the PPAs. By Presidential Decree No. 506 of
28 January 1999, the Ecuadorian State, through the MEM, subrogated INECEL in the
sales agreements concluded with Electroquil, EcuaPower and Energy Corp. The
preamble of such decree insists on the existence of an obligation of the State:

It is an obligation of the State to honor the obligations contracted with the

generators described in this Decree, concerning the performance bonds of

the state of Ecuador contained in the trust agreements that were signed as

backup for the power and electric energy purchase agreements executed
with each of these companies.

(Cl. Exh. 016, emphasis added, Spanish original, English translation

provided by the Claimants)
Accordingly, there is no doubt that there exists an obligation of the State vis-a-vis
Electroquil in the present case. The first requirement for the application of Article
Il(3)(c) is thus met. Having said that, the Tribunal notes that Ecuador's obligation under
Decree No. 506 was towards Electroquil and not towards Duke Energy, as Ecuador
had not undertaken any obligation, be it of a contractual or another nature, to the

benefit of the latter.

Turning to the second requirement, i.e. that the obligation of the State relates to an
investment, the words “with regard to [an investment]’ in their ordinary meaning denote
a link, a relation between the obligation and the investment that also seems broad in
effect. In this case, the link between the obligations assumed by the Respondent and
the investment is clear. For the purpose of the ICSID Convention and the Arbitration
Agreement, an investment is defined at paragraph 5 of the Arbitration Agreement as
including the PPA 95 and the PPA 96”. The primary obligation of the parties, including

Article | of the BIT further defines investment as:

(a) investment" means every kind of investment in the territory of one Party
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by nationals or companies of the
other Party, such as equity, debt, and service and investment contracts; and
includes:

(i) tangible and intangible property, including rights, such as mortgages,
liens and pledges;

(ii) a company or shares of stock or other interests in a company or
interests in the assets thereof;

89

325.

326.

327.

328.

INECEL and later the State, is to perform the PPAs in accordance with their terms. It

follows that the second requirement is equally met.

In connection with the third requirement, the Tribunal finds that the Respondent
violated its obligations vis-a-vis Electroquil under the PPAs and Ecuadorian law in
respect of the late establishment of the Payment Trusts, their poor implementation, the
irregular imposition of fines and the non-payment of interest for late payment arising
under the 96 Liquidation Agreement. In this manner, the Respondent breached its
obligations under the umbrella clause of Article II(3)(c).

4.2.3. Did Ecuador violate the duty of fair and equitable treatment (Art. II(3)(a)
of the BIT)?

After recalling the position of the parties (a), the Tribunal will determine the standard it
will apply to assess whether Ecuador breached Article II(3)(b) of the BIT (b), and
decide if there is a breach thereof (c).

a) Parties’ positions

According to the Claimants, it is obvious that Ecuador failed to act fairly and equitably
with regard to their investment. This is whether the Tribunal concludes that Ecuador
failed to maintain a stable and predictable framework for the Claimants’ investment, or
failed to act transparently and in accordance with the Claimants’ reasonable and
legitimate expectations. The Claimants submit that they made their investment with the
reasonable and legitimate expectations that the Government of Ecuador would act
strictly in accordance with its laws and contractual obligations. Ecuador's commitments
to the Claimants were echoed in written and oral assurances which were provided by

high-ranking government officials prior to the investment and were not complied with.

The legal framework for the Claimants’ investment encompassed Ecuador's 1997 Law
on the Promotion and Guarantee of Foreign Investments, the Payment Decree, the
Payment Trusts, the PPAs, the Ecuadorian Constitution and the Civil Code. Ecuador’s
failure to implement the law by refusing to act in accordance with its contractual
commitments or its own Payment Decree constituted a change in the applicable legal

structure in violation of international law. Ecuador’s failure to pay Electroquil in

 

(iii) a claim to money or a claim to performance having economic value, and
associated with an investment;

(iv) intellectual property which includes, inter alia, rights relating to [...]; and
(v) any right conferred by law or contract, and any licenses and permits
pursuant to law.

90

329.

330.

331.

332.

333.

334.

accordance with the Payment Decree, the Payment Trusts and the PPAs, as well as its
failure to adhere to the contractually-prescribed penalty regime, and the Med-Arb
Agreements, clearly constitutes unfair and inequitable treatment in violation of

international law.

Ecuador denies any such violation of Article II(3)(a) of the BIT. It submits that the facts
of the case do not establish that it took any regulatory measures in its sovereign
capacity which altered the legal framework surrounding the investment and maintains

that it observed its contractual commitments.

As to the investor's alleged expectations, the Respondent argues that the Claimants
distort the conditions imposed by international law in order to protect the Claimants
against commercial risk. The Claimants have neither shown that their expectations
were based upon the State’s conduct, nor that such expectations were destroyed as
opposed to merely upset, nor that this was the result of obscure State conduct, nor that

the Treaty seeks to protect against the consequences of poor business decisions.

The Respondent claims that, during and after the performance of the PPAs, it
maintained a stable framework for the Claimants’ investment and adopted a
transparent approach. In any event, the Respondent alleges that the duty to grant fair
and equitable treatment under the BIT cannot be extended beyond what customary

international law provides with respect to foreign investment.
b) Applicable standard

The Tribunal will first address whether the standard contained in the Treaty is an
autonomous standard or merely reflects customary international law (i). It will then

determine its content (ii).
(i) Nature of the standard

As to this first aspect, the Tribunal is of the opinion that the discussion about the
autonomous character of the standard is irrelevant given the circumstances of the
case. It also appears overtaken by the evolution in the latest ICSID decisions.

As a first element, the Respondent's reliance on Occidental v. Ecuador, in which the
same provision of the US-Ecuador BIT was at stake, is of little assistance. The
Occidental tribunal found Ecuador in breach of Article II(3)(a) of the US-Ecuador BIT
for not refunding VAT whilst such refund was a legitimate expectation of the Claimant.

The Occidental tribunal further determined whether the relevant legal and business

91

335.

336.

337.

29

at

framework met the requirements of stability and predictability under international law. It
found that “there is certainly an obligation not to alter the legal business environment in
which the investment has been made” leaving aside the question of whether a treaty
standard may be more demanding than customary law. The Respondent's arguments

based on Occidental are therefore of no help.

Second, the Tribunal finds useful guidance in Azurix v. Argentina®. The Azurix tribunal
analyzed Article II.2(a) of the US-Argentina BIT, which is similar to Article II(3)(a) of the
BIT and reads as follows: “/nvestment shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment, shall enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded
treatment less than required by international law”. It thus sought to determine whether
such language entailed obligations additional to those required by the minimum

standard of treatment of aliens under customary international law.

In proceeding to this determination, it considered the treaty language as a floor and not
a ceiling and held that the standards under the treaty and under customary

international law were substantially similar:

361. [...]. The last sentence ensures that, whichever content is attributed to
the other two standards, the treatment accorded to investment will be no
less than required by international law. The clause, as drafted, permits to
interpret fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security as
higher standards than required by international law. The purpose of the third
sentence is to set_a floor, not a ceiling, in order to avoid a possible
interpretation of these standards below what is required by international law.
While this conclusion results from the textual analysis of this provision, the
Tribunal does not consider that it is of material significance for its application
of the standard of fair and equitable treatment to the facts of the case. As it
will be i below, the i requirement to satisfy this standard
has evolved and the Tribunal considers that its content_is substantially
similar whether the terms are interpreted _in_ their ordinary meaning, as
required by the Vienna Convention, or in accordance with customary
international law. (Footnote omitted, emphasis added)

The Tribunal concurs with this statement and with the conclusion that the standards are
essentially the same*’. This conclusion was also reached by the CMS tribunal in the

following terms:

284. While the choice between requiring a higher treaty standard and that of
equating it with the international minimum standard might have relevance in
the context of some disputes, the Tribunal is not persuaded that it is relevant
in this case. In fact, the Treaty standard of fair and equitable treatment and
its connection with the required stability and predictability of the business
environment, founded on solemn legal and it is not

338.

339.

340.

different from the international law minimum standard and its evolution under
customary law”. (Emphasis added)

(ii) Content of the standard

Turning to the content of the standard, the Preamble of the Treaty specifies that “fair

 

 

and ble of i is desirable in order to intain a stable

 

k for it and i ffecti ilization of ic resources”.

The Tribunal concurs with the findings of the tribunals in CMS, Tecmed, Occidental v.
Ecuador, discussed by the parties, pursuant to which a stable and predictable legal and
business environment is considered an essential element of the fair and equitable
treatment standard. It is also in agreement with the decision in LG&E v. Argentina® and
finds that a standard of fair and equitable treatment in international law has indeed
emerged in the following terms:

125. Several tribunals in recent years have interpreted the fair and equitable
treatment standard in various investment treaties in light of the same or
similar language as the Preamble of the Argentina - U.S. BIT. These
tribunals have repeatedly concluded based on the specific language
concerning fair and equitable treatment, and in the context of the stated
objectives of the various treaties, that the stability of the legal and business
framework in the State party is an essential element in the standard of what
is_fair_and equitable As_such, the Tribunal_considers_ this

ion to be an ing standard of fair and equitable in
international law. (Footnotes omitted, emphasis added)

 

The stability of the legal and business environment is directly linked to the investor's
justified expectations. The Tribunal acknowledges that such expectations are an
important element of fair and equitable treatment. At the same time, it is mindful of their
limitations. To be protected, the investor's expectations must be legitimate and
reasonable at the time when the investor makes the investment™. The assessment of
the reasonableness or legitimacy must take into account all circumstances, including
not only the facts surrounding the investment, but also the political, socioeconomic,
cultural and historical conditions prevailing in the host State. In addition, such

342.

343.

344,

expectations must arise from the conditions that the State offered the investor and the
latter must have relied upon them when deciding to invest®*.

The Tribunal also notes that it appears from a consistent line of cases that a breach of
fair and equitable treatment does not presuppose bad faith on the part of the State®.

In the present case, most of the Claimants’ allegations under Article II(3)(a) deals with
the non-compliance of the Respondent's contractual obligations. At least in the context
of provisions other than the umbrella clause, it is now a well-established principle that
in and of itself the violation of a contract does not amount to the violation of a treaty.
This is only natural since treaty and contract breaches are different things, responding
to different tests, subject to different rules. This is true even in this case, in which the
parties have agreed on the BIT as the law governing their contractual relationship.

Numerous tribunals have held that a State may breach a contract like an ordinary party
without incurring international responsibiity. As a consequence, as was for instance
held in RFCC v. Morocco”, “[pjour que la violation alléguée du contrat constitue un
traitement injuste ou inéquitable au sens de I’Accord bilatéral, il faut qu’elle résulte d’un
comportement exorbitant de celui qu’un contractant ordinaire pourrait adopter’ or, in
English, “in order for the alleged contract violation to constitute unfair or inequitable
treatment within the meaning of the bilateral Agreement, it must result from conduct
exorbitant from the one which a regular contractor could have adopted” (Tribunal’s

translation).

Similarly, when the /mpregilo® tribunal reviewed a claim in respect of unforeseen
geological conditions, it stressed that the claim did not raise issues beyond the

application of a contract:

268. Claims in Respect of Unforeseen Geological Conditions: Applying the
approach outlined above, the Tribunal considers that Impregilo’s claims in

not capable of constituting “unfair or inequitable treatment” or “unjustified or
discriminatory measures” for the purposes of Article 2 of the BIT. These are
matters that concern the implementation of the Contracts, and do not involve
any issue beyond the application of a contract, and the conduct_of
contracting parties. In particular, the matter does not concern any exercise of
‘puissance publique’ by the State. (Emphasis added)

The Tribunal concurs with these statements. Establishing a treaty breach is a different
exercise from showing a contract breach. Subject to the particular question of the
umbrella clause, in order to prove a treaty breach, the Claimants must establish a
violation different in nature from a contract breach, in other words a violation which the

State commits in the exercise of its sovereign power.
c) Tribunal’s determination

The Tribunal will review whether Ecuador was in breach of the guarantee of fair and
equitable treatment from three perspectives: in the context of the PPAs (i), in the
context of the poor implementation of the payment guarantee (ii), and with regard to the
Med-Arb Agreements (iii).

The Tribunal will examine whether Ecuador failed to secure a stable and predictable
legal framework and whether the expectations held by the Claimants when making
their investment were reasonable. To identify such expectations and to assess their
reasonableness, it may be useful to recall that the investment was made in the political

and economic context of Ecuador’s energy crisis and national shortage.

(i) Did Ecuador violate the fair and equitable treatment in the context of the
PPAs?
* The performance of the PPAs

The Tribunal is of the opinion that the delay in the establishment of the Payment
Trusts, their poor implementation, the irregular imposition of contract fines and the non-
payment of interest on late payments due under the PPAs did not involve the exercise
of sovereign power on the part of INECEL or of the State. These acts constitute
conduct which any contract party could adopt; they are thus not capable of amounting

to a breach of fair and equitable treatment.
* Duke Energy and the penalties

Duke Energy argues that it had reasonable expectations regarding the fines which

were deceived and that it was denied its right of due process.

95

outstanding penalties under the PPAs when it made its investment. As pointed out by
the Respondent's expert, it is clear that Duke Energy knew that Ecuador's payments
were regularly delayed when it made the investment. At that time, the PPAs for the
years 1995 and 1996 had already reached 46.7% and 30% completion respectively
and substantial delays in payment had already occurred (1° ER Mancero Saman, { 43-
44). Equally, Electroquil had already been fined six times for a total of USD 1.5 million
(idem, § 45). In other words, Duke Energy was aware of past penalties when it
invested. The Claimants’ expert Mr. Kaczmarek testified that “the fines that had been
imposed prior to the investment were taken into account in the capital subscription
agreement’ (Tr., p. 904). Mr. Larrea, for his part, stated that at the time of the
negotiation “Duke had already done the complete due diligence of the company, and
so it was aware of the situation and how things stood financially, technically with the

contracts, so everything entered into the negotiation package” (Tr., p. 289).

Duke Energy was thus aware of the risk that Electroquil could be fined for non-
performance and it assumed the related business risk®. It appears, however, to have
expected that no fines were yet to be imposed on account of facts that predated the
investment®. The Tribunal does not believe that this expectation can be viewed as
reasonable when one bears in mind the manner in which payments were handled and
the opacity that prevailed in the administration of the contract prior to Duke Energy’s
investment. In view of the contract history, the expectation could only have been

deemed reasonable if it had been based on clear assurances from the Government.

See cross-examination of Mickey Peters (PanEnergy’s Project Manager (a company
acquired by Duke Power Corporation) and Duke Energy's Managing Director of
Business Development of Northern Latin America and Vice President of North Latin
America responsible for Ecuador), Tr. pp. 362-363:

Q: Your economic model does allow, however, for penalties to be imposed
after your investment?
A: The assumption that we make is that we never assumed that you're not
going to be able to comply with your contractual commitments. You assume
that you will be able to comply, and you don’t assume penalties. We knew
the contract. We didn't assume that we were going to incur penalties.
Q: But there was a risk that you could incur penalties for non performance?
A: Yes, of course.

Ibid., Tr. pp. 362-363:

Q: So, this would have been a condition precedent of your investment, that
there were no penalties outstanding?

A: I'm not sure we had that as a condition precedent to our investment,
specifically that there were no penalties outstanding, but we made the
assumption in our economic model there were no penalties outstanding, no
penalties that were yet to be assessed.

96

355.

The Tribunal has found no assurances on record concerning outstanding penalties. It is
true that the Claimants refer to assurances given in meetings held with the Government
(see Reply, § 177, 2"? WS Gustavo Larrea Real, § 6-16; 1°" WS Mickey Peters, 4 22
and WS John Sickman, § 26). However, the former Minister of Energy and Mines, as
well as the Minister of Finance, categorically deny having given such assurances. In
the meetings they only explained the economic difficulties faced by Ecuador and
expressed their satisfaction with Duke’s intention to invest in the country. (WS Raul
Baca Carbo, former Minister of Energy and Mines and WS of Fidel Jaramillo, former
Minister of Finance). In view of such contradictory declarations and of the lack of
contemporaneous written evidence, the Tribunal cannot but conclude that the

existence of assurances is not established.

Second, Duke Energy also argues that the State violated its obligation of fair and
equitable treatment when the contract administrator imposed fines for alleged past
wrongdoing after the Liquidation Agreements had been executed (Cl. Mem., 197). It
does not develop this argument further.

In the two instances just referred to, it has not been established that either INECEL or
the State imposed the fines under the PPAs in a capacity other than that of a “normal”
contract partner. Indeed, the record does not show any use of sovereign power in the
fine process. Private contract parties can agree to empower one of them to impose
sanctions on the other for unlawful performance of the contract. Such mutually agreed
delegation of power derives from the parties’ autonomy under the law of contracts. It
must be distinguished from the power of the State to impose sanctions in the exercise
of its sovereign power. The Tribunal thus concurs with the Respondent when it states
that there was no use of the State's "imperium" in this context (R. Answer, § 465).
Accordingly, such a contract breach is not susceptible of rising to the level of a violation

of fair and equitable treatment.

(ii) Did Ecuador violate the fair and equitable treatment by not implementing the

payment guarantee?

It is correct that Ecuador did not take any regulatory measures or legislative actions in
its sovereign capacity that altered the existing framework. The State did not interfere
directly with the contract. On the contrary, the Claimants complain of Ecuador's lack of

intervention, which allegedly destroyed the Claimants’ expectations*'. To assess the

The Claimants do complain, however, of active measures taken by INECEL (Cl. Reply § 131).

These are, however, irrelevant in the present context.

merits of this claim, one must distinguish between the expectations of Electroquil and

those of Duke Energy, as they are not necessarily identical.

Electroquil’s expectations

According to the Claimants’ expert, Electroquil posted losses until 1995“. It then
signed the PPAs with INECEL with guaranteed revenues of USD 114 million.
Electroquil’s expectations can thus be said to be embodied in the text of the PPAs.

At the time of the PPA 95, Electroquil’s expectations were that INECEL would establish
and implement the 95 Payment Trust. Contrary to what the Claimants assert, the text of
the PPA 95 does not contain any undertaking of a payment guarantee on the part of
the Ministry of Finance. The Tribunal understands that the undertaking of the Ministry
of Finance applied to payments under the PPA 985 at a later date. It did not apply at the
time when Electroquil made its first investment.

In addition, here again, it does not appear that INECEL behaved vis-a-vis Electroquil in
a manner different from a “normal” contract party. The establishment of the Payment
Trust did not imply the exercise of sovereign power. As the Tribunal understands it, any
private contractor can undertake to establish a payment trust. It results from these
considerations that Electroquil's expectations under the PPA 95 must be regarded as

"mere" contractual expectations which are not protected under the BIT.

The issue is different with respect to the PPA 96. Indeed, here it appears that
Electroquil entered into the PPA 96 with the expectation that the Ministry of Finance
would comply with the payment mechanism provided in Clause 8.6 of PPA 96. The
Ministry of Finance was to take part in the 96 Payment Trust and to provide a payment
guarantee. In the Tribunal's opinion, the Ministry of Finance engaged the responsibility
of the State at this juncture and it was reasonable for Electroquil to rely on the

Ministry's express commitment.

The expectations which this commitment created cannot be deemed "mere" contractual
expectations. The Ministry of Finance was not Electroquil’s regular contract
counterpart. It intervened in the contract framework for the sole purpose of providing
the State’s payment guarantee. That guarantee entailed the exercise of sovereign
power as it implied that funds would be drawn from the Ministry and Public Credit’s
account.

1®' ER Kaczmarek, page 7.

98

361.

364.

One could ask whether Electroquil’s expectation that the Ministry comply with the
guarantee was reasonable, considering that payments required INECEL's approval.
The Claimants' expert considers that the risk involved in the payment procedure was nil
since the invoicing system was “fairly simple” (Tr. p. 950). Be this as it may, the
Tribunal finds that Electroquil could reasonably rely on the State’s representation that it
would guarantee INECEL’s payments under the 96 Payment Trust. Accordingly, the
Tribunal is of the opinion that the Respondent failed to grant fair and equitable

treatment to Electroquil’s investment by not implementing the payment guarantee.

Duke Energy’s expectations

Duke Energy invested in a different context than Electroquil. It was aware of the
circumstances surrounding the performance of the PPAs, in particular of the late
payments and the imposition of heavy fines. As a result, it appears that Duke Energy
requested certain guarantees from the State as a condition precedent to its investment,
notably the Payment Decree and the establishment of the Payment Trusts (M. Peters,
Tr. p. 305). In fact, it was only after the adoption of the Payment Decree on
10 November 1997 that Duke signed the Letter of Intention on 18 November 1997.
Thereafter, it was only after the Payment Trust Agreements had been executed on
17 February 1998 that Duke acquired its stake in Electroquil on 23 February 1998. The
Payment Trust Agreements included the express guarantee that the State would pay
Electroquil’s invoices should INECEL’s funds be insufficient.

Duke Energy’s alleged expectations were that the overdue balance of USD 7.2 million
would promptly be "eliminated" through the establishment of the Payment Trusts (Cl.
Mem., 4 71, 1% ER Kaczmarek, § 43). When seeking to determine whether these
expectations were reasonable in the circumstances, one might ask whether an
experienced investor such as Duke Energy should not have paid closer attention to the
procedure set up to implement the payment guarantee. In light of the clear terms of the
Payment Trust Agreements and of the Payment Decree, which Duke Energy
considered as conditions precedent to its investment, the Tribunal finds that the latter
was reasonably entitled to rely on the commitment of the Government. In other words,

Duke Energy's expectations must be deemed reasonable’.

The Tribunal therefore reaches the conclusion that, by not implementing the payment

guarantee, the Respondent deceived Duke Energy’s reasonable expectations and thus

Whether Duke Energy made a prudent business judgment is a distinct issue that will be
discussed in the damages section.

breached the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment with respect to the Payment

Trusts.
(iii) Claimants’ expectations with regard to the Med-Arb Agreements

In the context of the Med-Arb Agreements, one could question that the conduct of the
Attorney-General and the MEM was in line with Electroquil’s legitimate expectations.
This being said, it is true that such conduct was adopted in conformity with Ecuadorian
law. It is also true that there is an agreement to say that the Claimants should have
been more cautious in their interpretation of the terms of the Mediation and Arbitration
Law. Be this as it may, the legitimate expectations which are protected are those on
which the foreign party relied when deciding to invest“*. The Med-Arb Agreements were
concluded more than two years later and can thus in no event give rise to expectations

protected under the fair and equitable treatment standard.

Hence, the Tribunal holds that there has been no breach of the guarantee of fair and

equitable treatment in relation to the Med-Arb Agreements.

4.2.4 Did Ecuador violate the duty not to impair the investment by arbitrary
conduct (Art. II(3)(b) of the BIT)?

After recalling the position of the parties (a), the Tribunal will determine the applicable
standard under Article II(3)(b) of the BIT (b), before deciding whether Ecuador
breached such standard (c).

a) Parties’ positions

The Claimants submit that Article II(3)(b) of the BIT is a stand-alone provision
independent from the fair and equitable treatment guarantee. They claim that the
Respondent breached Article II(3)(b) because it impaired the Claimants’ management,
operation, maintenance, use, enjoyment, acquisition, expansion, or disposal of the

investment through arbitrary measures.

To support such claim, the Claimants put forward that the ordinary meaning of the term
“arbitrary” is “lacking in proper foundation or restraint” (Cl. Mem., § 201) and refer to
the ELSI case to further define the concept of arbitrariness. They further explain that
impairment consists of an interference with an investment, or a disruption which

proximately causes an injury to the investment (idem, § 202, Cl. Reply, § 193), but

See citations in footnote 34 above.

100

371.

372.

373.

374.

375.

which does not require complete dispossession of the investment. They add that the

impairment standard provides far greater protection than general law.

The Claimants contend that Ecuador's capricious and persistent conduct was arbitrary
under the BIT. Late payments, imposition of fines and failure to provide an adequate
and impartial dispute resolution forum demonstrate a blatant disregard for domestic
and international law. Ecuador’s conduct was also arbitrary because the Respondent
acted outside the scope of any discretion. Further, the Respondent's behavior, both in
the local arbitration and before this Tribunal, where it challenged the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal, demonstrate that Ecuador did not believe that it had to honor its
commitments.

The Respondent's acts hampered Duke’s management, operation, maintenance, use
and enjoyment of its investment and caused Electroquil to make losses of nearly USD
19 million for Duke. Such acts cannot be excused on the ground of the energy crisis.

The Respondent considers that there is no separate impairment standard. Relying inter
alia on Saluka, it argues that the concept of impairment is part of the fair and equitable
treatment standard.

Ecuador denies having engaged in any arbitrary conduct. It argues that it observed its
contractual commitments at all times and used its prerogatives in good faith in reliance
on clear and legitimate public purposes, including in the context of the energy crisis. It
also observes that the fact that the Claimants agreed to the method of payment in the
Liquidation Agreements, except for the fines, shows that there was no arbitrariness or
discrimination on the part of the Respondent (R. Reply, ] 226).

It further submits that impairment requires complete dispossession, as illustrated in
Occidental v. Ecuador where no impairment was found because the Claimants
continued to exercise their rights in a manner fully compatible with the rights to property
({ 161 of the award, R. Answer, § 497 and seq.).

b) Applicable standard
Article II(3)(b) of the BIT reads as follows:

Neither Party shall in any way impair by arbitrary or discriminatory measures
the pi , i use, je , itic
expansion, or disposal of investments. For purposes of dispute resolution
under Articles VI and Vil, a measure may be arbitrary or discriminatory
notwithstanding the fact that a party has had or has exercised the
opportunity to review such measures in the courts or administrative tribunals
of a Party.

 

101

376.

377.

378.

379.

45

The Tribunal notes that no discrimination has been alleged by the Claimants as such. It
will thus limit its inquiry to the issue of arbitrariness.

In view of the structure of the provisions of the BIT, the Tribunal has difficulty following
Ecuador's argument that there is only one concept of fair and equitable treatment
which encompasses a non-impairment notion. The Tribunal will thus make a separate
determination to decide whether the contested measures were arbitrary and have
impaired the Claimants’ management, operation, maintenance, use, or enjoyment of
the investment.

For the sake of its determination, the Tribunal will rely on the ICu’s definition of
arbitrariness set forth in ELS/ as being “not so much something opposed to a rule of

law, as something opposed to the rule of law [...] willful disregard of due process of

law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety”.

It will also refer to the decision rendered in the ICSID case RFCC v. Morocco“, in
which the tribunal considered the articulation between arbitrary conduct and contract
breaches in the following terms:

Le Tribunal n’a pas a procéder a l'examen détaillé des inexécutions
contractuelles dont s‘accusent mutuellement les parties. II doit vérifier si le
Royaume du Maroc a respecté ses obligations au titre de I'Accord bilatéral.
Dans cette perspective, il releve que le refus par ADM de prolonger les
délais d’exécution et, partant, application des pénalités de retard, ne sont
pas des décisions prises en l’'absence de tout motif objectif, de fagon
unilatérale et arbitraire.

En réalité, le désaccord des parties, en fait et en droit, ne dépasse pas le
cadre normal d'un litige purement contractuel entre le maitre de l’ouvrage et
entrepreneur. (§ 104)

and in English

The Tribunal does not need to proceed to a detailed analysis of the
contractual non-performance alleged by each party against the other. It must
check whether the Kingdom of Morocco complied with its obligations under
the Bilateral Agreement. In that sense, it notes that ADM's refusal to extend
the time period for the performance of the contract, and, hence, the
application of penalties for late performance, are not decisions that were
taken without objective grounds, in a unilateral and arbitrary manner.

In fact, the parties’ factual and legal disagreement does not go beyond a
normal contractual dispute between an owner and a contractor. (Tribunal’s
translation)

c) Tribunal’s determination

The Tribunal cannot share Duke’s view that the Respondent breached Article II(3)(b) of
the BIT.

It is true that INECEL and the Respondent breached the PPAs in certain instances and
did not implement its payment guarantee. But contractual breaches do not amount, in
themselves, to arbitrary conduct and the Claimants have shown no differences going
“beyond a normal contract dispute” to use the words of the RFCC tribunal. With respect
to the payment guarantee of the State, the Tribunal does not consider that Ecuador's
behavior “shocked a sense of juridical propriety’, especially since Electroquil’s invoices
were paid, albeit late.

With respect to the local arbitration and the Med-Arb Agreements, it has not been
established that the actions of the local arbitral tribunal could be attributed to the
Respondents. In addition, the conduct of the Attorney-General and the MEM, though
attributable to Ecuador, complied with local law and can thus not be regarded as
arbitrary.

Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that Ecuador has not breached Article II(3)(b) of the
BIT.

4.2.5 Did Ecuador violate the duty to provide effective means of asserting
claims (Article II(7) of the BIT)?

Prior to determining this issue (b), the Tribunal will summarize the positions of the
parties (a).

a) Parties’ positions

The Claimants allege that Ecuador committed a denial of justice by failing to entertain

their claims in the local arbitration as well as their tax claims in a timely fashion.

With respect to the local arbitration, the Claimants essentially put forward the following

arguments:

- Their “hopes to avail themselves of a fair dispute resolution mechanism
were crushed” (Cl. Mem., § 226) when the local arbitral tribunal rendered its
final award on 11 March 2002, denying jurisdiction and reversing two earlier
decisions under the pressure of the Government.

103

387.

388.

- The argument on which the Government relied to “obtain the nullification of
the Med-Arb Agreements, was that the Attorney-General never authorized
the execution of the Med-Arb Agreements” (Cl. Mem., § 228). This
argument shocks the conscience because authorization was not required,
and even if authorization had been required, it had in reality been given,
and had it not been given, the Attorney-General could have remedied the
fault.

- The State participated in the pre-arbitration mediation without raising the
issue of the nullity of the Med-Arb Agreements. Any objection to jurisdiction
was thus untimely and contrary to the doctrine of venire contra factum
proprium (Cl. Mem., ¥ 236).

- As a matter of international law, “once the Government agreed to arbitrate
its dispute with Claimants [sic] through the Med-Arb Agreements, [...] it was
required to uphold that promise” and its failure to do so is “a textbook
example of the denial of justice” (Cl. Reply, 4 212; see also Cl. 1° PHB,
225).

- Ecuador's counterargument that the Claimants failed to exhaust local
remedies is irrelevant because the international wrong consisted in the
State’s frustration of the arbitration agreement. Moreover, no remedies
were available in any event.

With respect to the tax claims, the Claimants recall that on 16 November 2001
Electroquil filed a petition before a local tax court to claim the reimbursement of
customs duties (Cl. Exh. 112). That petition was dismissed and Electroquil appealed on
5 March 2004 to the Ecuadorian Supreme Court which was dismantled by a
presidential decree in April 2005 and was not reformed by the time of the filing of the
ICSID request (Cl. Mem., 241). The Claimants argue that this delay is in itself a
denial of their tax claims. They further submit that the fact that Ecuador's judicial
system was decapitated by a presidential decree and left without the ability to fully
administer justice, is contrary to the host State’s obligation to provide an adequate

system of justice to foreign investors under the BIT.

The Respondent denies any violation of Article II(7) of the BIT. With respect to the local

arbitration, it submits essentially the following main arguments:

104

389.

390.

391.

393.

- It was not involved in the making of the award of March 2002. The local
arbitration was conducted under the auspices of the Guayaquil Chamber of

Commerce, a private entity which has no connection with the State.

- Relying on Waste Management, the Respondent submits that a defense raised in

local proceedings cannot amount to a denial of justice.

- In any event, the local arbitral tribunal observed the standards of due process.
The award of 20 September 2001 was only a preliminary decision and the
Claimants could have sought the annulment of the award of March 2002, a
remedy existing under Ecuadorian law, of which the Claimants chose not to make
use. The Claimants thus failed to exhaust local remedies and cannot allege any
denial of justice. In any event, the dispute is now submitted to this Tribunal by
consent of both parties, which rules out a denial of justice.

With respect to the customs duties claim, the Respondent contends that any alleged
delay in the local proceedings was due to Electroquil, whose counsel did not appear at
the hearing set on 29 January 2005. It further explains that the Ecuadorian Supreme
Court was reinstated on 30 November 2005 and that a delay between April and

November 2005 cannot amount to a denial of justice.
b) Tribunal’s determination
Article II(7) of the BIT reads as follows:

Each Party shall provide effective means of asserting claims and enforcing
rights with respect to investment, investment agreements, and investment
authorizations.

Such provision guarantees the access to the courts and the existence of institutional

mechanisms for the protection of investments. As such, it seeks to implement and form

part of the more general guarantee against denial of justice.

. As a preliminary comment, the Tribunal notes that the existence and availability of the

Ecuadorian judicial system and of recourse to arbitration under the Mediation and
Arbitration Law are not at issue here. What is at issue and must be reviewed by the
Tribunal is how these mechanisms performed, as well as the alleged failure of the

State to respect its promise to arbitrate.

The Tribunal will examine these issues with respect to the local arbitration, which was
between the MEM and Electroquil (and not Duke Energy as the Claimants seem to

suggest in their Reply, § 212). It will not entertain the same issues in connection with

105

394.

395.

396.

the tax claims as it has determined that it has no jurisdiction over tax matters.
Admittedly, one might argue that the present claim deals with access to courts primarily
and with taxation only secondarily and that it is therefore covered by the BIT. The
Tribunal is disinclined to follow this avenue. It is of the opinion that jurisdiction should
not be accepted unless the related intent of the Contracting States can be clearly
proven, which is not the case here.

It appears not to be seriously disputed, and rightly so, that the acts of the local arbitral
tribunal and of the local arbitral institution cannot be attributed to Ecuador. These are
private actors whose conduct does not engage the responsibility of the State. The
Tribunal will thus focus its inquiry on the behavior of the MEM and of the Attorney-
General. In this respect, it notes that it has not been established that the Government
exercised pressure on the local arbitrators to reverse the decisions on jurisdiction. It is
true that the sequence of events in the local arbitration is puzzling. After having
dismissed the Attorney-General's objection to jurisdiction in two decisions on 3 August
2001 and upon reconsideration again on 20 September 2001, the local arbitral tribunal
issued a final award denying jurisdiction six months later on 11 March 2002. The
evidence given by the president of the tribunal in the present arbitration failed to
convince the Tribunal of the merits of such a course of action. This said, the Tribunal
does not find that there are sufficient elements on record to conclude that undue

influence was exerted.

Turning now to the behavior of the MEM and the Attorney-General, the Claimants’
argument that the State had participated in the mediation without raising an objection
as to the validity of the Med-Arb Agreements does not appear relevant in the present
context. Indeed, the rule which is generally accepted in comparative law pursuant to
which a defense of lack of jurisdiction must be raised in limine litis does not apply to

pre-arbitral stages.

The Claimants argue that it is widely accepted under international law that a State
which refuses to respect its promise to arbitrate with a foreign party commits a denial of
justice. Doing so, it fails to recognize that Ecuador’s promise related to a domestic
arbitration with a local company. The arbitration had its seat in the country, was
governed by the local arbitration law, and conducted under local institutional rules. The
alleged ground for nullity arose under the law governing the arbitration. This situation
differs from that in which a State agrees to international arbitration with a foreign party
and then raises a defense of lack of jurisdiction arising from an incapacity under its own
law while the arbitration agreement is valid under the law governing the arbitration.

106

397.

398.

399.

400.

By contrast, the Respondent asserts that the mere fact that a State raises a defense of
lack of jurisdiction in a proceeding does not amount to a denial of justice. It relies on
Waste Management II. As aptly summarized by Paulsson: “The City [of Acapulco] was
clearly entitled to raise jurisdictional objections without being deemed to commit an
international delict. Even if the objection had been absurd, the delict would have arisen
only if the Mexican legal system had upheld it’. The question therefore is whether the
Ecuadorian legal system has upheld the Attorney-General’s objection.

The short answer is that Electroquil did not challenge the final award of 11 March 2002
issued by the local arbitral tribunal before the courts of Ecuador and that, as a
consequence, the Ecuadorian legal system never came into play to rule on the award

of the local tribunal.

The Claimants contend that their claim for denial of justice is founded even though they
did not challenge the local award because the requirement to exhaust local remedies
does not apply when a State reneges on its promise to arbitrate and when no effective
and adequate remedies existed in any event. Citing Paulsson, they state that the
“victim of a denial of justice is not required to pursue improbable remedies” (Cl. Reply,
4 217). By contrast, the Respondent insists on the exhaustion of local remedies and
contends that Article 31 of the Ecuadorian Mediation and Arbitration Law contains

remedies in the event of excess of power or violation of due process.

The Claimants are right to point out that there is no obligation to pursue “improbable”
remedies. Article 31 of the Mediation and Arbitration Law provides for an action for
annulment of arbitral awards on several grounds**. The Respondent contends that this

provision permits challenges on the ground that a tribunal exceeded its powers by
declining jurisdiction (R. Reply, | 247). On the face of the text, none of the grounds
expressly address jurisdiction. They appear to deal with instances of breach of due
process (a-c) and of excess of powers (d). The decision of the Superior Court of Quito,
which the Respondent cites in support of its contention, also deals with an excess of
power, the tribunal having ruled on a claim not before it, a situation different from the

one at issue.

In other words, it is established that an award may be annulled on grounds such as
excess of power and breach of due process. It is unclear from the record, however,
whether Ecuadorian courts would assimilate an erroneous decision dismissing
jurisdiction to an excess of power, as would be for instance the case under Art. 52(1)(b)
of the ICSID Convention. Yet, lack of clarity it is not sufficient to demonstrate that a
remedy is futile. In other words, the Claimants have not established to the satisfaction
of the Tribunal that it was improbable that the Ecuadorian courts would have made
such an assimilation.

On this basis, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have failed to show that no
adequate and effective remedies existed.

For all these different reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Ecuador has not breached
Article II(7) of the Treaty.

Damages

The Tribunal has held that Ecuador did not comply with the payment mechanism
provided under the PPAs nor with the Payment Trust Agreements, that it owed
Electroquil interest on late payments on the amount of USD 96,980.64, and that it
imposed certain unjustified fines, i.e. Fines Nos 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10.

The Tribunal has also held that such violations resulted in the breach of the umbrella
clause with regard to Electroquil and of the principle of fair and equitable treatment with
regard to both Claimants.

Prior to determining whether the Claimants are entitled to compensation, as a result of
such violations, the Tribunal will summarize the positions of the parties (4.3.1). It will
then establish the applicable principles and assess the amounts due (4.3.2), starting
with the Applicable law (a), the consequences of the violation of the PPAs and
Ecuadorian law (b), continuing with the consequences of the violation of the BIT (c),

and ending with the choice of the currency (d) and with the beneficiary of the award (e).
4.3.1 Parties’ positions

a) Claimants’ position

(i) Applicable law and measure of damages

The position of the Claimants has evolved throughout the proceedings. In their
Memorial, the Claimants stated that the amount of damages was dictated by the terms
of the applicable law upon which the affected investor relied ‘[...) namely, in this case,
the U.S.-Ecuador BIT and Ecuadorian law, as well as the general principles of
international law’ (Cl. Mem., § 244). In addition, they invoked Article 2229 of the
Ecuadorian Civil Code that provides that “any damage that can be attributed to malice
or the negligence of another person must be repaired by the latter’ (Cl. Mem. 4 246).
However, at the hearing and in their final post-hearing brief, the Claimants submitted
that damages must be determined according to international not municipal law (Tr.p.
38, 1° PHB, § 233).

In any event, and in reliance on Chorzow Factory in particular, the Claimants
essentially submit that damages should make them whole (Cl. Reply, § 228). With
regard to the measure of damages, they note that there is no “universally accepted
measure of damages” for breach of the standards of fair and equitable treatment or for

arbitrary treatment and that the Treaty does not articulate a standard either (Cl. Reply,

109

409.

410.

51

{ 225). In their view, this gap should be filled by international law (Cl. Reply, { 226, Cl.
1° PHB, 233) and the measure of damages should be determined in accordance with
international law principles. They conclude that “whatever measure of damages is
used”, the damages should make them whole and “should be fair, and not result in an
unfair outcome” (Cl. Reply, {| 228). On this basis, the Claimants request prompt, full
and adequate compensation in US dollars, the currency used in the PPAs.

(ii) Compensation for losses suffered

The Claimants present two alternative methods of calculation: (i) the losses caused to
Electroquil; and (ii) the impairment of Duke Energy’s investment. They note that these
two measures of economic loss are not “mutually exclusive”. Since Duke Energy’s
investment losses are essentially a component of the losses sustained by Electroquil,
an award for Electroquil’s losses would compensate both Duke Energy and Electroquil
for the loss they have collectively suffered (CI. Mem., § 247, 1S ER Kaczmarek, § 81).

Losses caused to Electroquil

In their Memorial, the Claimants requested USD 24,061,426, which they amended to
USD 24,720,904, in their Reply of 31 December 2005. The initial amount of USD

24,061,426 was composed of the following sums (1*t ER Kaczmarek, Table 13)*°:

« USD 8,421,050 for interest on late payments.

e USD 14,425,051 for the 11 unjustified fines, ie. USD 7,292,114 for nominal
amount of the fines and USD 7,233,936 for the interest®. Fines of USD
4,615,368.83 were imposed under the PPA 95 and fines of USD 2,676,745.35
under the PPA 96”.

« USD 1,113,326 for customs duties, i.e. USD 1,008,614 for the duties and USD
105,712 for the interest.

. These amounts are said to reflect Electroquil’s losses under a commercial damages

analysis for breach of the PPAs and of the umbrella clause, which can be summarized

as follows:

No breakdown was given with respect to the second figure advanced.

In total, Electroquil was fined USD 8.18 million. USD 883,703 of those fines was settled for USD
523,881 in the Liquidation Agreements and USD 7,292,114 remained in dispute (1*' ER
Kaczmarek, {| 98).

148" ER Kaczmarek, Table 12.

110

First, to estimate the amount of interest owed, the Claimants’ expert adopts a
corporate perspective (a commercial damages analysis) rather than an investor
perspective (a diminution of value analysis) (1% ER Kaczmarek, § 70).
Accordingly, the expert builds an invoicing and payment model taking into
account all PPA invoices, accounts receivable records and remittances from
Electroquil’s accounting department to provide a daily record of the amounts
invoiced by Electroquil and the amounts paid to it under the PPAs. The model
also computes the daily outstanding receivables owed by Ecuador as well as
the daily receivables expected from Ecuador. The difference between the
receivables represents the overdue balance owed by Ecuador (1* ER
Kaczmarek, {| 72). To determine the interest accrued on the overdue balance,
the expert computes the weighted average active rate (i.e. the lending rate by
opposition to the borrowing rate) in US dollars (currency stipulated in the
PPAs), as quoted monthly by the Central Bank of Ecuador (i.e. an average of
13.9% between 1996 and 2005) (Cl. Mem., § 75). The overdue balance with
interest is then carried forward throughout the effective period of the PPAs,
accounting for payments made and invoices issued until 10 September 2002.
The resulting overdue balance, with interest, reflects the balance of interest
owed due to late payment. To calculate its current value, the balance of interest
is then carried forward to 31 August 2005 (the date of filing of the first report).

Second, to calculate the damage resulting from the imposition of the fines, the
expert uses the same invoice and payment model and subtracts each fine from
the model. This subtraction increases the overdue balance with interest amount
as of 31 August 2005. The Claimants insist that the relevant date from which to
calculate interest on fines is the date of assessment because Ecuador
improperly used the fines to set off its outstanding payment obligations to the
Claimants (Cl. Reply, 232, 2° ER Kaczmarek, § 40). The Claimants apply a
single interest rate to all the items claimed, namely the Ecuador active US dollar

rate.

Third, in order to estimate the harm caused by the imposition of the USD
1,008,614 customs duty charge, the Claimants’ expert applies the same
weighted average monthly active rate to this amount from the period beginning
1 July 2004 through to 31 August 2005.

Impairment model

As an alternative, with reference to the violations of Article II(3)(b) and (c) of the BIT,
the Claimants seek to recover the value of the impairment of their investment as of
31 December 2005 in an amount of USD 19,263,434.

This claim is based on an impairment damage analysis based on a scenario of timely
payment and absence of fines. The Claimants’ expert chose not to apply the standard
formula for determining damages by merely calculating the decrease of the fair value of
the investment because the amount which Duke Energy invested in Electroquil did not
represent the fair market value of the shares acquired (2% ER Kaczmarek, § 48 and
seq.)™.
The formula retained for determining impairment damages is based on the funds
committed by Duke Energy to its investment in Electroquil. In other words, it is based
on the value of the conditions precedent confirmed by Ecuador prior to Duke’s
investment (2% ER, 9 52). It relies on the “difference between Duke’s contemporaneous
18 for the i and Duke’s ions for the i had Duke
known INECEL, MEM, and Ecuador would not pay Electroquil’s invoice on 30-day

 

terms and would improperly impose penalties and duties on Electroquil’ (Cl. Mem., 4
203, 1 ER Kaczmarek, | 60). This computation is made by comparing Duke’s
Electroquil investment model (the Base Expectation Model which yields a 12.95% rate
of return) and the Adjusted Expectation Model (which yields a 11.68% rate of return)**®
to determine the loss of return on investment caused by the Respondent's misconduct
(Cl. Mem., § 108, 1% ER Kaczmarek, {] 60-64). “To account for Ecuador's late
payment of invoices, we incorporated the actual net charge in the receivables and
payables balance from Electroquil’s audited financial statements into the Adjusted
Expectation investment Model” (1° ER, § 62).

This led the Claimants’ expert to the following conclusions:

62. [...] Prior to 2000, invoices were paid so late that Electroquil suffered
negative cash flows. Part of the negative cash flow was offset by withholding
payment to suppliers. However, in 1998 and 1999, Electroquil was unable to
stretch its suppliers as much as Ecuador stretched Electroquil. This
imbalance created a negative impact on Electroquil's cash flows and Duke's
expected return on investment. In 2000 and 2001, this pattern reversed itself
because Ecuador began to pay down the overdue amount owed to
Electroquil. Therefore, the working capital impact is essentially a shift of

If the fair market value were to apply, the Claimants’ expert acknowledges that it should be
reduced to the 51.5% interest held by Duke Energy (2" ER Kaczmarek, 47).

That model includes the unexpected fines after Duke Energy’s investment, the unplanned
working capital requirement due to late payments, and the duty charge.

112

416.

417.

419.

420.

cash flow from earlier years to later years. The shifting of cash flow to later
years, however, does have an overall negative impact on Duke's expected
return on investment.

63. After adjusting the Base Expectation Model for 1) unplanned and
disputed penalties and duties, and 2) actual working capital requirements
created by Ecuador's untimely payment of invoices, the return on investment
drops from 12.95 percent to 11.68 percent. Therefore, it can be concluded
that the penalties, duties and late payment of invoices lowered Duke's
expected investment returns by 1.27 percent.

(18 ER Kaczmarek, footnotes omitted, emphasis added)
According to the Claimants’ expert, two logical methodologies can be employed to

calculate the economic impact of the lower rate of return.

The first approach is based on the assumption that Duke Energy would have reduced
its US$ 38.5 million investment if it had known that the Payment Guarantee and the
Trusts would not ensure timely payment and that Electroquil would be improperly fined
and charged duties. The reduction of the amount invested would have increased the
rate of return on the investment (1 ER, § 66). A reduction of the investment of USD
7,271,832 would have restored Duke Energy’s expected rate of return of 12.95%
(1*ER, § 67). Brought to the value of 31 December 2005, this methodology results in
an amount of USD 19,263,434 (1°' ER Kaczmarek, § 67).

The second methodology that can be employed to measure the impairment to Duke
Energy's investment due to the lower expected rate of return is an alteration of the
Adjusted Expectation Model to include a cash inflow or payment at the end of 2005 that
would restore the expected return on investment to 12.95%. In application of this
method, a payment of USD 19,274,106 at the end of 2005 would have restored the
expected rate of return. The difference between the two approaches of USD 10,672
being due to a rounding error, as both approaches should yield the same result
mathematically (1S ER Kaczmarek, 68).

The Claimants’ expert considers that the sum of USD 19,263,434 represents
approximately 91% of Duke’s total loss (2° ER Kaczmarek, {| 54). The portion of the
loss not accounted for relates to risks which Duke Energy willingly took, such as the

risk involved in converting the plant from diesel to natural gas (Tr., p. 925).

In the event that the Tribunal decides that certain fines were justified, the Claimants
submit that the value of each justified fine can be subtracted from the impairment
model (Tr., p. 871).

113

421.

422.

423.

424.

(iii) Law applicable to and computation of interest

With respect to interest, the Claimants argue that it is international law, not Ecuadorian
law, which ultimately governs the principle, type, and rate of interest. Accordingly, the
Claimants consider that an award of compound interest at the active rate would make
them whole (Cl. Reply, 4 239, Cl. 1° PHB, {| 237). In response to the question posed by
the Tribunal during the hearing as to whether the active US dollar interest rate applied
equally to Electroquil and Duke, the Claimants answered in their first PHB that such
rate applied to the commercial damages analysis, while Duke Energy's rate of return
applied to the impairment model computation:

If the Tribunal awards damages based on Claimants’ Umbrella Clause claim,
which utilizes a commercial damages analysis, the active US dollar interest
rate is appropriately applied for this award, which is directed to the company
Electroquil as a whole (including Duke Energy's ownership interest in
Electroquil). If the Tribunal awards damages based on Claimants fair and
equitable treatment claim and/or arbitrary impairment claim, which utilizes an
impairment model damages analysis, the multiplier for rendering a present-
day value for Duke Energy's losses is not based on a general interest rate,
but rather, the IRR for Duke Energy’s investment — 12.95%. (| 249)

(iv) Claim relating to the local arbitration proceedings

Regarding the claim relating to the local arbitration proceedings, the Claimants request
an award of USD 271,532.78 plus annual compound interest, i.e. USD 358,954. This
amount represents the costs incurred by the Claimants for their participation in the local
arbitration proceedings (see Table 5 to 2" ER Kaczmarek).

b) Respondent's position
(i) Applicable law and measure of damages

The Respondent contends that damages must be assessed pursuant to Ecuadorian
contract law because the Claimants’ allegations fall within the contractual framework
and because the BIT contains no standards as to assessment of damages, except for
cases of expropriation, which are inapplicable here. They add that Ecuadorian contract
law also governs damages for breach of treaty based on the umbrella clause (R.
Answer, 9 548, R. Reply, {| 256-257, R. 2" PHB, {| 84 and seq.).

As to Ecuadorian law, the Respondent alleges that the relevant provisions are those of
contractual responsibility and not those wrongly invoked by the Claimants relating to
extra-contractual responsibility, notably Article 2229 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code (R.
Answer, ¥ 548).

114

425.

426.

427.

428.

429.

In any event, the Claimants cannot obtain higher compensation under the BIT than
under Ecuadorian law (R. 2° PHB, 458). The Respondent also asserts that no claims
can be raised under the BIT which arose before the Treaty entered into force, such as
the customs duties (R. Reply, § 563 (a)).

(ii) Compensation for losses suffered
Electroquil’s losses

First, in the Respondent's opinion, the Claimants’ expert report is irrelevant and lacks
impartiality because it fails to consider the facts and legal arguments presented by the
Respondent and wrongly quantifies the Claimants’ claims, assuming that they are all
well-founded (R. Answer, § 549).

The Respondent's second objection deals with the interest claims. The Respondent's
expert argues that damages based on improper fines and customs duties should not
include an award of interest since these claims cannot give rise to default interest
(intereses de mora) but only to an adjustment of the face of the amount of the fine or to
a duty to compensate for the loss of value during the time of retention. Indeed, they
cannot be considered as a commercial debt paid late but must be deemed a revocation
of penalty (2 ER Mancero Samén, § 21.1). Therefore, the interest rate should be
different.

If any of the fines had been unjustified, the compensation would be:

An adjustment of their nominal amount to compensate for the loss of value
during the time of retention, and, accordingly, the application of the active
interest rate in dollars and the calculation of interest over interest would be
inapposite. This adjustment of the nominal amount of the fines, with the
dollar inflation rate, would amount to US$ 1,125 ,433 and the present value
of all retentions would amount to US$8,417,546 (at 31 Dec 2005).**

(R. 2" PHB, Annex D, § 1.2, Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation)

As it is evident from the quotation above, the Respondent also objects to the use of the
active interest rate (tasa activa), which only applies to loans by private banks to the

Corporate sector (Annex D, R. 2” PBH, § 3.2). The application of an active interest

This position was also explained by the Claimant's expert during his expert report (Tr., vol 4, 27
April 2006, p. 984-985).

115

431.

432.

rate would result in another unjust enrichment on the part of the Claimants (R. 2d PHB,
q 124). Under Ecuadorian law, unless the parties agree otherwise, the applicable rate
is the “legal interest rate” (R. Answer, § 558). This rate corresponds to the “risk free
rate” established weekly by the Central Bank on the basis of the “basic rate” of the
average return of public bonds (2% ER, § 25.3), or in other terms to the passive rate
(‘tasa pasiva preferencial’). “Tasa pasiva preferencial’ was available before and after
the dollarization of the Ecuadorian economy; it generally exceeds the inflation rate of
the US dollar (Annex D, R. 2"? PHB, 4 6.4). Indeed, the applicable rate should at least
maintain the value of the disputed amounts and should reflect the lost value caused by
the passing of time. Since the PPAs were to be paid in US dollars and damages are to
be calculated in the same currency, the inflation of the US dollar is therefore the best
measure of such deterioration. In the Respondents’ view, the preferential passive rate
is the rate that most accurately reflects the deterioration caused by the inflation and, in
consequence, should be the applicable rate (2m ER Mancero Saman, {1 24, 25, R. and
PHB, 125). Indeed,

If there is something to reimburse with interest, the rate to be used, should

reflect value for money, in terms that at least the capital value of the

judgment remains intact, i.e. the interest rate chosen shall not be less than

the inflation rate that best reflects the deterioration of the value of the
currency.

(R. 2nd PHB, {| 125, Spanish original, Tribunal's translation)
In the event that the Tribunal decides that fines have been wrongly imposed, the
Respondent considers that interest should be calculated as of the date of payment
collection rather than the date of assessment, as held by Claimants (R. Answer, § 554).

As for interest on late payment, the Respondent argues that it can give rise to default
interest (R. Answer, 560), which should be capped at 10% as provided by the Central
Bank’s regulations (R. 15" PHB, Annex D, 11.1).

Finally, the Respondent objects to the use of compound interest on the ground that it is
prohibited under Ecuadorian law. (R. Answer, § 559, R. Reply, § 261, R. 1° PHB, q
207). It adds that, even under international law, an award of compound interest would
not be in conformity with earlier decisions in investment disputes. In reliance on Santa
Elena, in particular, as well as on Aucoven and Marvin Feldman, it notes that
compound interest may be awarded for expropriation but not for contract claims. With
reference to writings by John Gotanda, it also argues that an award of compound
interest would result in unjust enrichment (R. 2° PHB, ¥ 105 and seq.). In addition,
compound interest may only apply as of the date of the Request for Arbitration (R. 2"?
PHB, 117).

116

433.

434.

435.

436.

The Respondent's last objection refers to the currency of the debt. It contends that the
claim computation fails to distinguish between "the period within which the obligation to
pay must be fulfilled in sucres [...] and a second period beginning with the substitution
of the monetary regime and the adoption of the dollar as legal currency [...]’ (R. Reply,
{ 556, Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation). Indeed, prior to the dollarization in
January 2000, Electroquil collected its invoices at the conversion rate of the date of
payment. Considering the loss of value of the sucre vis-a-vis the dollar, this payment
system resulted in an advantage to Electroquil (R. Reply, 557). Moreover, certain of
the fines at stake were imposed under the sucre regime (44.08%), while the rest were
assessed after the dollarization in January 2000 (1S ER Mancero Saméan, § 32). If any
of the fines should be held unfounded, the damage calculation should take account of

the effects of the abandonment of the sucre in favor of the dollar.
Impairment of Duke Energy's investment

The Respondent further contests the impairment model used by the Claimants’ expert
in terms of methodology and underlying assumptions. It especially disputes the
assumption about Duke Energy's expectations, since the latter had knowledge of the
administration of the PPAs.

For the Respondent's expert, there is no impairment related to the fines and the arrears
accumulating in paying the invoices and there is therefore no need to provide an
alternative calculation (Tr., p. 976). Duke Energy should have calculated its expected
rate of return on the basis of the then current contingencies, including fines and delays
(Tr., p. 981). The Respondent's expert recalls that in its letter of intent for the
acquisition of a controlling interest in Electroquil of 12 November 1997, Duke Energy
had mentioned a rate of return of 11.79% for an investment of USD 45 million (1% ER
Mancero Saméan, { 40). He also puts forward that no further loss of profits could arise

after the liquidation of the PPAs since there were no further operations.

In addition, Ecuador contends that Duke Energy’s entitlement is limited to its
participation in the share capital of Electroquil at the time when the acts that were
complained about occurred, which amounted to 51% (R. Reply, 4 563 (b)). Any
compensation in excess of this amount would be speculative and would make Ecuador

liable for commercial risks which Duke Energy had assumed.

(iii) Law applicable to and computation of interest

For the Respondent, interest is governed by Ecuadorian law, which allows only simple
interest. As already mentioned in detail above (429), Ecuador contends that the
relevant rate is the tasa pasiva preferencial.

(iv) Damages arising out of the local arbitration proceedings

Aside from its general objection against compound interest, the Respondent has not

expressed a position as to the quantum of this particular claim.
4.3.2 The Tribunal’s analysis

The determination of damages will follow the analysis of the claims on the merits. The
Tribunal will first address the issues relating to the breach of the PPAs and Ecuadorian
law (b) and subsequently the breaches of the BIT standards (c). It will first deal with the
applicable law (a).

a) Applicable law

Having reviewed the parties’ arguments, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from its
ruling on the law governing the merits of this dispute in general. Hence, it will assess
the damages by application of the law of Ecuador as well as by application of the
relevant principles of international law. It will discuss which rules to apply if and when

the issue arises, including with regard to interest.

The question is not about the preeminence of one rule over the other but about
applying the relevant rule depending on the type of norm that has been breached. It is
the Tribunal’s task to identify the specific rules that dictate the consequences for each
of these breaches. Once these rules have been identified and their consequences
established, the Tribunal will address the question of possible overlapping claims for

reparation in such a fashion as to avoid double recovery.
b) Consequences of the violation of the PPAs and Ecuadorian law

The Tribunal found that the Respondent has violated its obligations with regard to the
Payment Trusts and the imposition of certain fines and owes Electroquil interest on late
payments. As rightly noted by the Respondent, these breaches primarily derive from
the PPAs and it is therefore the contractual regime that applies to determine the
consequences of such breaches. In light of the PPAs’ silence in this respect, the

general contractual regime of the Ecuadorian Civil Code applies.

118

443.

444,

445.

446.

447.

The starting point is Article 1599 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code, which provides that

compensation for unlawful contract performance includes actual costs and lost profits:

Art. 1599.- Compensation for damages includes damages and loss of profits,
whether they arise from not having performed the obligation, or from faulty
performance, or from delay in performance.

(Spanish original, Tribunal's translation)

Accordingly, the failure to fulfill an obligation or its late fulfillment entitles the creditor to
compensation (“indemnizacion”). This compensation includes damnum emergens and
lucrum cessans. Additional provisions of the Ecuadorian Civil Code provide that the
debtor is only responsible for the damages that were or could have been foreseen at
the time of conclusion of the contract if the inobservance of the obligation does not
result from willful misconduct (“dolo”)**. Further, when the obligation is an obligation to
pay an amount of money, the creditor need not provide proof of any harm. The harm is
presumed by the passage of time and reflected in the rate of interest agreed by the
parties. If the rate has not been agreed, “legal interest” is due from the date when the

wrongful conduct occurred”.

The Tribunal also notes that this regime includes the notion of “mora”, a notion that has
been extensively discussed by the parties. It refers to the situation in which the debtor
has not fulfilled its obligations on time. When the compensation is owing to late

performance, it must be paid as from the time when the “mora” occurs®”.

After careful examination, the Tribunal reaches the conclusion that to quantify the
contractual damages, the Tribunal will resort to the method based on commercial

losses incurred by Electroquil, which is the most appropriate method at this juncture.
(i) Payment Trusts

The Tribunal has found that the Payment Trusts were not established prior to
commercial operation and were poorly implemented. Having said that, the Tribunal

must review whether this caused any injury to Electroquil.

Art. 1601.- If wrongful conduct (dolus) cannot be attributed to the debtor, he will only be
responsible for the damages that were foreseen or could have been foreseen at the time of the
contract. (Spanish original, Tribunal's translation)

Art. 1600.- Compensation for damages is owed from the time of the debtor's default or, if the
obligation is to refrain from doing something, from the moment of the contravention. (Spanish
original, Tribunal's translation)

Ibid.

448.

449.

450.

451.

452.

It should be borne in mind that the establishment of the Payment Trusts and their
subsequent implementation were substantial obligations on the part of INECEL and the
State. The record shows that the violation of this obligation resulted in the late payment
of Electroquil’s invoices. Indeed, according to Mr. Tumbaco, the poor operation of the
Payment Trusts and the late payment of the invoices significantly reduced the income
and cash flow of Electroquil, which resulted in the latter posting losses in all fiscal years
from 1996 to 1999 (1% WS, 31). Mr. Tumbaco alleged that the late payments resulted
in four specific categories of damages (i) expenses incurred to refinance the liabilities,
(ii) loss of income, (iii) imposition of additional fines on behalf of the Government, and
(iv) outstanding interest (idem, § 51). The Tribunal notes that part of these four
categories of damages is compensated by interest for late payments and by the
repayment of unjustified fines (see (ii) and (iii) below). For the rest, no corresponding
figures were presented in the report of the Claimants’ expert. Indeed, Electroquil’s
additional working capital costs incurred due to late payments have not been claimed
by Electroquil but by Duke Energy in the form of a claim of reduced return on its
investment. These items will thus be analyzed when assessing the alleged impairment

of Duke Energy's investment.

Beyond these damages, the record contains no evidence of other damages resulting
from the late establishment and subsequent inadequate implementation of the
Payment Trusts.

(ii) Compensation for late payments

The Tribunal has held that no interest was due for late payment except on the amount
of USD 96,980.64 arising out of the 96 Liquidation Agreement (see {| 279 above).

The Tribunal must now determine the applicable interest rate, whether interest must be

simple or compound, and the period during which interest accrues.

With respect to the applicable interest rate, pursuant to Article 2110 of the Ecuadorian
Civil Code, interest is to be paid at the rate quoted by the Central Bank. The
Ecuadorian Central Bank quotes weekly an active and a passive rate. The Tribunal is
of the opinion that the applicable rate should be the active rate of the Ecuadorian
Central Bank quoted in dollars. Indeed, the active rate was the one to apply to the
Claimants’ borrowings and the Tribunal does not see any reason to choose the passive
rate in such circumstances. The Tribunal is mindful that the rate of conversion in US
dollars is high but it is the rate that applied in Ecuador before and after the dollarization
to local companies (see Annex D, R. 2° PHB, 44.2).

In its second post hearing brief, the Respondent invoked Article 5 of the Regulaciones
del Directorio del Banco Central de Ecuador, Titulo VI, Sistema de Tasas de Interés;
Capitulo VI, Tasas de interés de mora y sancién por desvio (Spanish original,

Tribunal’s translation) which reads as follows:

Article 5 .- For acts or contracts that have been agreed outside the financial
system, incurred in arrears, the rate of arrears will be obtained by applying
a surcharge of up to 10% (0.1 times) to the stipulated rate. Such surcharge,
plus the agreed interest rate, will constitute the arrears to be applied from
the date of maturity of the obligation, which will run only until the date on
which payment is made.

(Annex D, R. 2nd PHB, Spanish original, Tribunal's translation)

The Respondent concluded that “if the Tribunal decides to grant compensation with
default interest, it should consider that the maximum surcharge of "up to 10%" would
apply to the TPR stipulated in the award, as from the expiration date of the obligations”
(R. 2"? PHB, Annex D, 4 11.4, Spanish original, Tribunal’s translation).

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent's allegations were made in its last written
pleading and thus remain unanswered, a situation which may raise concerns of due
process. It further recalls that the Parties had not agreed on an interest rate in the
PPAs. Hence, in this case, there is no "tasa estipulada" or "tasa convenida" to which
the maximum 10% "recargo" may apply. As a result, the Tribunal will not rely on Article
5 of the Central Bank Regulation quoted above.

The Respondent also argues that the appropriate interest rate should be equivalent to
the correction of the inflation on the U.S. dollar (R. 2" PHB, Annex D, q 1.2). The
Tribunal cannot follow this argument. The inflation in the U.S. does not appear to be
the appropriate measure of late interest for debts owing in Ecuador even though the
Ecuadorian economy is dollarized. Indeed, mere compensation for inflation would not
make the creditor whole for the deprivation of the money unduly withheld. To
compensate for the lack of funds, the creditor will have to borrow at a rate that includes

an inflation component but also comprises a price for the use of the funds lent.

The Tribunal must further decide whether simple or compound interest should be
awarded. It agrees with the Respondent’s argument in favor of simple interest. Indeed,
Ecuadorian law prohibits compound interest in the present case. Specifically, Article
244 of the Ecuadorian Constitution prohibits compound interest in the context of
credits. Similarly, Article 2140 of the Civil Code provides that “it is prohibited to stipulate
interest on interest’ (Spanish original, Tribunal's translation). The same prohibition is
contained in the Code of Commerce (R. 2" PHB, Annex C, § 2.3).

463.

Finally, the Tribunal must establish the date from which interest is to be applied. It
considers that interest on late payments should begin to be applied as from 28 August
2002, i.e. from the date of execution of the 96 Liquidation Agreement, until payment of
that sum had been made. Whilst the payment is said to have been made (R. Answer.,
| 278) -and this has not been disputed — the exact date of the payment of that sum
does not appear to be on record. The only recorded mention of such payment seems to
appear in a letter of 3 September 2002, in which the MEM requested the Central Bank
of Ecuador to proceed with that payment (R. Exh. 108).

(iii) Fines and penalties

While the parties are in agreement as to how to calculate compensation for the wrong
imposition of fines, which is to be determined by the nominal amount of the wrongly

imposed fine plus interest, they disagree on the type and rate of interest.

The wrongful imposition of fines and penalties resulted from the wrongful application of
the contractual provisions. Therefore, the consequences must be measured by
application of the contractual regime. The compensation for the non-compliance with
the contractual provisions must thus include the amount of the fine imposed and the
interest on such amount from the date on which the fine was set off by INECEL, i.e.
from the date on which the Claimants were effectively deprived of the use of the
monies.

Principal

According to the Claimants, the principal amount of the alleged damages based on
fines and duties was USD 8,300,727 (1° ER Kaczmarek, Table 13, p. 30).

Taking into account its determinations on liability, the Tribunal considers that the
principal amount due is USD 5,578,566. It reaches this amount by deducting from the
amount claimed the claims for customs duties (USD 1,008,614) and the fines which it
deemed unjustified, namely fines No. 1 (USD 400,000), No. 2 (USD 550,000), No. 7
(USD 29,181) and No. 11 (USD 734,366).

Interest

Having established the principal amount owing, the Tribunal must now determine the
applicable interest, specifically the rate, whether interest must be simple or compound,

and the period during which interest must accrue.

122

464.

465.

466.

467.

468.

The total amount of interest claimed amounts to USD 7,233,936 (1*' ER Kaczmarek,
Table 13, p. 30).

The considerations set forth above with respect to the calculation of interest on late
payments apply equally to the computation of interest on the fines.

As for the starting date, interest must run from the date on which INECEL proceeded to
setting off the fines, when the date of set-off can be established, or from the date of the
liquidation of the fines when the alleged set-off date cannot be established on the basis

of the record. Thus interest shall run from:

- 15 March 1998 for fine No. 3;

- 20 May 1998 for fine No. 4;

- 29 June 1998 for fines No. 5 and No. 6;

- 27 November 2001 for fines No. 8, No. 9 and No. 10.

c) Ce of the violati of the BIT st

 

(i) Standard of reparation

The Claimants are correct in stating that the consequences of the breach of an
international obligation should be determined by recourse to international law. Under
international law, it is well established that the principal consequence of committing a
wrongful act is the obligation for the party to repair the injury caused by that act®.
However, controversy remains regarding the applicable standard and measure of

compensation as well as the proper method of calculating such compensation.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal considers that the principle of the Factory at
Chorzéw according to which any award should “as far as possible wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed” constitutes good
guidance. The Tribunal notes that the principle of “full” compensation has been further
codified in Article 31 of the International Law Commission Articles on Responsibility of
States for Internationally Wrongful Acts and sees no reason not to apply this provision
by analogy to investor-state arbitration. Having said that, the Tribunal wishes to

473.

emphasize that compensation will only be awarded if there is a sufficient causal link
between the breach of the BIT and the loss sustained by the Claimants.

(ii) Compensation

The Claimants have asked this Tribunal to provide compensation rather than
restitution. The Tribunal will thus proceed to determine the principles applicable to
determine the measure of compensation. The BIT contains no guidance for evaluating
damages arising from breaches other than expropriation. In accordance with relevant
case law®, the Tribunal must therefore identify the measure of compensation which is

most appropriate in the circumstances of this case.
Umbrella clause

The Tribunal must examine which damages Electroquil is entitled to in respect of the

breach of the umbrella clause.

The Tribunal has decided above that the Respondent has violated its obligations vis-a-
vis Electroquil under the PPAs and Ecuadorian law in respect of the late establishment
of the Payment Trusts, their poor implementation, the irregular imposition of fines and
the non-payment of interest for late payment arising under the 96 Liquidation
Agreement. On this basis, it has held that Electroquil is owed compensation with
regard to (i) its payment of interest on late payments and (ii) its payment of unjustified
fines (see JJ 450-466 above).

The Tribunal is of the opinion that compensation for the breach of the umbrella clause
is subsumed in the compensation already awarded. Indeed, Electroquil has suffered
the same financial consequences from the violation of the PPAs and Ecuadorian law

and the breach of the umbrella clause.

More precisely, as far as payment of interest on late payments is concerned, the
Tribunal finds no reason to depart from the determination it made above as to the
applicable rate of interest (see {J 455-457 above). It considers that the prohibition of
compound interest contained in local law must be enforced especially considering
Article VIII of the BIT which specifies that the Treaty shall not derogate from the laws
and regulations of the host State. In addition, although increasingly common in ICSID
practice, the award of compound interest is not a principle of international law.

See for instance CMS v. Argentine Republic, 409. See also S.D. Myers, Inc v. Government of
Canada, UNCITRAL Rules, Second Partial Award, 21 October 2002, § 309; Marvin Feldman v.
United Mexican States, |CSID Case No. ARB(AF)/99/1, 16 December 2002, § 195.

124

474,

475.

476.

477.

478.

479.

In addition to the amount of the unjustified fines, the Tribunal also awarded to
Electroquil interest at a simple rate (457). The Tribunal considers that this award also
adequately compensates Electroquil for the breach of the umbrella clause. The

reasoning applied in the foregoing paragraph with regard to interest applies here too.

As already indicated (| 449 above), the only financial consequence that has been
claimed with regard to the late establishment of the Payment Trusts and their
subsequent inadequate implementation, including the non-implementation of the
State’s payment guarantee, is working capital costs incurred due to late payments. This
said, Electroquil has not claimed any damages in this respect. Indeed, Duke Energy
has claimed the additional working capital costs incurred by Electroquil due to late
payments in the form of a claim of reduced return on its investment, which will be
reviewed below ( 482).

The Tribunal thus concludes that, what was awarded under the PPAs and Ecuadorian
law, encompasses the compensation owed with regard to the violation of the umbrella
clause of the Treaty, and represents full reparation in light of the Factory at Chorzow. In
addition, the Tribunal is satisfied that such a decision avoids the risk of double

recovery.

Fair and equitable treatment

The Tribunal must now examine the financial consequences of the violation of fair and
equitable treatment under Article II(3)(a) of the BIT with regard to the late
establishment of the Payment Trusts, their poor operation and the resulting late

payments.

Electroquil incurred additional working capital costs that have been claimed by Duke
Energy in the form of a claim of reduced return on its investment. As seen above, the
Claimants’ expert concluded that “the penalties, duties, and late payment of invoices
lowered Duke's expected investment returns by 1.27 percent’ (1° ER Kaczmarek,
63). This allegedly yielded an economic loss of USD 19,263,434 million measured at
the end of December 2005 (1° ER Kaczmarek, | 69).

The Tribunal cannot rely on the Claimants’ figures to assess the damages claimed. The
1.27% decrease of the rate of return is caused by three compounded factors: the
penalties, customs duties, and late payments. Now, it has held that Ecuador did not
breach the guarantee of fair and equitable treatment with respect to the penalties and it
has declined jurisdiction over the customs duties. Hence, the only remaining factor

causing the reduction is that of the late payments.

125

480.

481.

482.

483.

484.

According to the evidence of the Claimant's expert, prior to 2000, invoices were paid
so late that Electroquil suffered negative cash flows. These delays altered Electroquil’s
working capital requirements significantly. This pattern was reversed in 2000 and 2001
with the result that “the working capital requirement impact is essentially a shift of cash
flows from earlier to later years” (1"' ER Kaczmarek, 62). To account for such a
reversal, the Claimants’ expert incorporated “the actual net change in the receivables
and payable balances from Electroquil’s audited financial statements” into his adjusted
expectation model (1% ER Kaczmarek, {| 62), which is one of the tools used to compute
the impairment of Duke Energy’s investment. This said, the evidence does not show
what proportion of the 1.27% reduction in the rate of return was due to the increased
working capital requirements. In addition, the Tribunal also stresses that no element on

record establishes Duke’s Energy’s alleged expected rate of return of 12.95%.

Moreover, when monies are paid late, interest is generally meant to compensate the
creditor for the lack of the funds. Admittedly, the creditor may, under certain
circumstances, show that its actual damage exceeds the amount of interest incurred
and claim additional compensation. Unlike interest, such compensation requires proof
of the excess damage. For the reasons stated in the foregoing paragraph, the Tribunal
is of the opinion that the excess damage resulting from the late payments and their
impact on the working capital and the rate of return has not been proven. At the same
time, it recalls that it has found that interest for late payments is due on the amount of
USD 96,980.64 on the basis of the 96 Liquidation Agreement entered into between the
MEM and Electroquil. The contractual limitations to which Electroquil consented during
the course of the performance of the PPAs cannot but apply to Duke Energy’s claims
under the Treaty.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that Electroquil has not claimed the additional working
capital costs it incurred in relation with late payments, which were claimed by Duke
Energy.

For all the reasons set forth in the preceding paragraphs, the Tribunal concludes that
Duke Energy is not entitled to compensation for the alleged impairment of its

investment in relation with the late payment of Electroquil’s invoices.
d) Currency of the Award

Paragraph 11 of the Arbitration Agreement provides that the award shall be in US
currency.

126

485.

486.

487.

488.

44

489.

490.

Moreover, the contract currency for accounting purposes was the US dollar. Pursuant
to Clause 7.3 of the PPA 95, the “dollar amounts determined in the preceding sections
shall be paid by INECEL to the Contractor in sucres, for the purposes of which the rate
of exchange for the purchase of such currency established by the Central Bank of
Ecuador on the date of payment shall be used”. Clause 8.7 of the PPA 96 contains a
similar provision. Accordingly, amounts were accounted for and invoiced in US dollars
but were payable in local currency at the spot market exchange rate according to the
Central Bank of Ecuador on the date of payment (1° ER Kaczmarek, footnote 83). In
addition, the claims have been formulated in US dollars.

For these reasons, the Tribunal will award the amounts due in US currency.
e) Beneficiary of the Award

The amounts deriving from the fines and penalties and the non-payment of interest due
to late payment arise originally out of the PPAs to which Electroquil, not Duke Energy,
was a party. Similarly, the violation of the umbrella clause only related to obligations

owed to Electroquil.

In these circumstances, the Award will only be payable to Electroquil. This does not
mean that Duke Energy will not be compensated. It rather means that Duke Energy will
be made whole through its shareholding in Electroquil, a fact that Duke Energy has
impliedly acknowledged when it stated that “[bJecause the loss suffered by Duke (US$
19,263.434) is a component of the loss suffered by Electroquil (US$ 24,061.426), an
award of US$ 24,061.426 would compensate both Duke and Electroquil for the loss
they have collectively suffered due to late payment and improper penalties and duties.”
(Cl. Mem., ¥ 247, 48" ER Kaczmarek, q 81).

Costs

Paragraph 11 of the Arbitration Agreement provides that the provisions of the ICSID
Convention and the Arbitral Award will govern with respect to costs and professional

fees incurred in connection with the arbitration.

In the exercise of its discretion in matters of allocation of costs and considering all
circumstances of this case, the Tribunal finds it fair that the parties bear the costs of the
arbitration equally and that each party bears its own legal and other costs.

127

491.
