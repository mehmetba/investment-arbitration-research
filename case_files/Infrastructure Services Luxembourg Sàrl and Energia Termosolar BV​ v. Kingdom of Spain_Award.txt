October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

 

 

The claimants are Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.a.rl. (“Antin

and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. (“Antin Termosolar”), a company incorporated on 27
June 2011, under the laws of the Netherlands (together, the “Claimants”). Antin
Termosolar is directly and wholly-owned by Antin Luxembourg. Antin Luxembourg and

The Respondent is the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimants and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On | November 2013, ICSID received from the Claimants a Request for Arbitration dated
29 October 2013 (the “Request for Arbitration”).

On 22 November 2013, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the
Parties of the registration. In the notice of registration, the Secretary-General invited the
Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with

Claimants’ Memorial, 2.

Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration
Proceedings.

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties on the method of constituting the
Tribunal, the Tribunal was constituted in accordance with the procedure set forth in
Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention.

The Tribunal is composed of Professor Francisco Orrego Vicufia, a national of Chile,
appointed by the Claimants on 14 February 2014; Mr. J. Christopher Thomas QC, a
national of Canada, appointed by the Respondent on 26 February 2014, and Dr. Eduardo
Zuleta Jaramillo, a national of Colombia, President of the Tribunal, appointed by the
Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council on 1 August 2014 in accordance with
Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.

On7 August 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the Parties that
all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was therefore
deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Natali Sequeira, ICSID Legal Counsel,
was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the
Parties on 23 September 2014 at the World Bank offices in Paris.

On 6 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | recording the agreement
of the Parties on procedural matters and the decisions of the Tribunal on disputed issues.
Procedural Order No. | provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be
those in force as of 10 April 2006, that the procedural languages would be English and
Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be Washington D.C., United States of
America. Procedural Order No. | also provided different procedural scenarios and agreed
timetables as well as the number, sequence and dates of pleadings. These timetables were
included in Annex A of Procedural Order No. 1.

On 28 November 2014, the Claimants filed their Memorial (“Claimants’ Memorial”) with
accompanying documentation.

On 30 January 2015, the Respondent filed a Request for Bifurcation to address the

On 2 March 2015, the Tribunal rendered its “Decision on Respondent’s Request for
Bifurcation” rejecting Respondent’s request to address the objections to jurisdiction as a
preliminary question, joining the preliminary objections to the merits and confirming the
procedural timetable.

On 31 July 2015, the Respondent filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial
on Jurisdiction (“Respondent’s Counter-Memorial”), with accompanying documentation.
On the same date, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to amend the
procedural timetable for the document production phase of the arbitration. The Parties
agreed that the remaining dates of the procedural timetable would remain as scheduled.
The Tribunal approved the amended timetable on 3 August 2017.

On 29 September 2015, in accordance with the agreed procedural timetable, the Parties
submitted their respective document production requests to the Tribunal.

On 14 October 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, addressing the Parties’
respective requests for document production and confirming the agreed procedural
timetable for the following stages. In Section III of Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal
requested the Respondent to provide the Tribunal with the documents corresponding to the
Claimants’ document production requests under Categories 29 and 30 and indicated that it
would “decide on the production of such documents after receiving and reviewing the
aforesaid documents in camera.”

Tribunal with digital copies of the requested documents.

On 6 November 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, dealing with the
Claimants’ document production requests under Categories 29 and 30.

On 18 December 2015, the Claimants submitted their Reply on the Merits and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Claimants’ Reply”) along with supporting documents.

On 21 December 2015, the Parties agreed an extension (until 1 March 2016) for the filing
of the Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Jurisdiction, as well as an
extension (until 15 April 2015) for the filing of the Claimants’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.

On 23 December 2015, the Respondent sought the Tribunal’s authorization to adduce six
exhibits submitted in the context of the present proceeding, in the arbitration Eiser

Case No. ARB/13/36) (“Eiser v. Spain’).

On 7 January 2016, the Claimants objected to the Respondent’s request on the grounds that
five out of six of the requested exhibits were confidential and commercially sensitive in
nature.

On 28 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 deciding on the
Respondent’s request and the Parties’ submissions on confidentiality of the six exhibits.
The Tribunal further requested the Claimants to inform the Tribunal on or before 2
February 2016 whether they had obtained consent to submit Exhibit C-0092 in this
arbitration, and if not, the reasons therefore.

On 2 February 2016, Claimants confirmed that they had obtained the consent to submit the
referred as Exhibit C-0092 in this arbitration and sought an order from the Tribunal
declaring its confidentiality. In Procedural Order No. 5, dated 5 February 2016, the
Tribunal declared the relevant document confidential.

On 1 March 2016, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on
Jurisdiction (“Respondent’s Rejoinder”).

On 15 April 2016, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction (“Claimants’
Rejoinder”).

On 19 July 2016, the Claimants requested leave from the Tribunal to submit additional
documents to the record in this arbitration, and to correct a document and some data that
they had previously filed. On 26 July 2016, the Respondent replied to the Claimants’
request and also sought authorization to submit additional documents. On 2 August 2016,
the Claimants replied to the Respondent’s request. On 8 August 2016, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 6 deciding on both Parties’ requests.

On 12 September 2016, the President and the Secretary of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing
organizational telephone conference with the Parties.

agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions on procedural matters concerning the organization
and logistical arrangements of the hearing.

THE NON-DISPUTING PARTY APPLICATIONS

On 14 November 2014, the European Commission filed an Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party (the “Commission’s First Application’).

On 5 December 2014, the Parties filed their observations on the Commission’s First
Application.

On 15 December 2014, the Tribunal issued its “Decision on Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party”. The Tribunal found that the Commission’s First
Application was premature considering that the Respondent had not yet submitted its
jurisdictional objections to the Tribunal and therefore dismissed the First Application
without prejudice to the Commission’s making a new request in due course.

On 9 December 2015, the Commission submitted a Second Application for Leave to
Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party pursuant to Arbitration Rule 37(2) (the “Commission’s
Second Application”).

On 21 December 2015, the Parties submitted their observations on the Commission’s
Second Application.

On 5 February 2016, the Tribunal adopted its “Decision on the European Commission’s
Second Application for Leave to Intervene as a Non-Disputing Party”. In its Decision, the
Tribunal authorized the Commission to make a written submission by | March 2016, upon
the submission of a written undertaking that it would comply with any decision on costs
ordered by the Tribunal. The Decision further established that the written submission
should be limited to 15 pages and be focused on the interpretation of European Union law
regarding the issue of jurisdiction. The Tribunal denied the Commission access to the
record of the arbitration, to the Parties’ pleadings, and to any hearings. The Commission
would have to bear its own costs for its participation as non-disputing party.

On 5 February 2016, the Centre sent a communication to the Commission informing it of
the contents of the operative section of the Tribunal’s Decision.

On 18 February 2016, the Commission submitted a request for the Tribunal to alter the
above-referenced Decision on the point of the costs undertaking. The Commission
informed that it was not in a position to submit the required written undertaking on costs
and requested the Tribunal to “reconsider its Decision on that point, and to drop the
condition set out in paragraph 44, under (f).”

On 18 February 2016, the Tribunal invited the Parties to submit their comments on the
Commission’s reconsideration request. On 22 February 2016, both Parties filed their

10

68.

observations. On 26 February 2016, the Tribunal rejected the Commission’s request for
reconsideration and maintained its earlier decision of 5 February 2016.

By letter of 29 February 2016, the Commission notified the Tribunal that it was not in a
position to provide the costs undertaking and therefore informed the Tribunal that it would
not file a written submission.

Iv. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

7.

This dispute relates to certain measures undertaken by the Respondent in the renewable
energy (“RE”) sector and the alleged breaches of its obligations under the ECT and
international law with respect to the Claimants and their investments.

The investments made by the Claimants, as will be further addressed below, consisted of
the acquisition of shareholding participations in Andasol-1 Plant and Andasol-2 Plant, two
operational concentrated solar power (“CSP”) plants located in Granada, southern Spain
(together, the “Andasol Plants”) in 2011.

CSP technology has been in use since the 1980’s and exploits sunlight with minimal
environmental impact. It is a form of solar thermal technology, where energy from the sun
is captured onto a liquid carrier fluid which heats a thermo-oil heat transfer fluid (“HTE”)
inside absorber tubes. The HTF converts water into steam by using a steam generator, or,
alternatively, the heat is transferred into a thermal storage system for later use. The steam
generated then drives a turbine, which in turn is connected to a generator that produces
electricity.> The Andasol Plants use a parabolic-trough design, where solar radiation is
concentrated on receptors by cylindrical-parabolic mirrors or collectors.

CSP plants may also use fossil fuels in order to boost their power-generation capacity. By
using natural gas, CSP plants increase their solar-to-electric conversion efficiency and the
reliability of their production. This was the case of the Andasol Plants, which were
equipped with three heaters and a liquefied natural gas reservoir to allow them to use
natural gas in their electricity production.*

Since the Spanish Constitution of 1978, Spain has adopted four laws which govern the
Spanish Electrical System (“SES”), with the aim of maintaining a unified and integrated
electrical system.* The SES is composed of the generation, transmission, distribution and

supply of electricity, the consumers of electricity and the State’s various regulating
authorities.

74. On 27 November 1997, Spain enacted Law 54/1997, partially opening up the electricity
sector to competition (with both regulated and liberalised activities) and putting an end to
the previous State-controlled system. This law established the overall legal framework for
the electricity sector in Spain, including its governing principles.° In its preamble, Law
54/1997 set out that it created

“an energy policy based on the gradual liberalisation of the market
compatible with the achievement of other objectives which also
belong to it, such as the improvement of energy efficiency, reduced
consumption and environmental protection. The special electricity
generation regime, the demand management programmes and, above
all, the promotion of renewable energy improve the way in which it
fits into our legal system.”

75. In order to encourage the production of energy from renewable sources, Law 54/1997
distinguished between an “Ordinary Regime” appl. to conventional sources of energy
production (such as coal-fired power plants) and a “Special Regime” applicable to
electricity production facilities of less than SMW which generated electricity from non-
consumable renewable energy sources. Pursuant to Article 27 of Law 54/1997:

“1. Electrical energy production shall be approved for operation
under the special regime in the following cases, and when said

activity is carried out in power plants with an installed power
capacity_that does not exceed SOMW: [...]

b) When used as a primary energy source, any of the no -cc
renewable energy, biomass or any kind of biofuel, providing the
owner does not operate electricity production activities under the
ordinary regime. [...]

2. Energy production under the special regime shall be governed by
its specific guidelines and, in matters not covered by them, general
applicable electrical production rules shall apply.”’

76. Generation of energy, with the exception of the activity of generation under the Special
Regime was specified to be a liberalised activity.*

Spain explains that the reason for this double regime rests on the need to encourage energy
production from certain sources in which “the price that they can get in the competitive
generation market is insufficient to cover its installation costs with a reasonable return on
investment, so that additional emoluments are required to be profitable.”? It seems
undisputed that due to their high investment costs, CSP power-generation projects require
government-backed incentives to be cost-competitive with conventional energy projects.!°

The application of the Special Regime was subjected to the fulfilment of a series of
requirements.!!

Law 54/1997 also provided for a “tasa de rentabilidad razonable” (a “reasonable rate of
return”) to energy producers. To that regard, Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 stated the
following:

“In order to establish premium quotas the following factors shall be
considered: the tension level of delivery to the grid, the actual
contribution to the improvement of the environment, to the saving on
primary energy and energy efficiency as well as the costs incurred
from investment, in order that reasonable rate of return may be
established related to the cost in assets on the capital market.”
[Tribunal’s Translation]

The Parties disagree as to the meaning and legal consequences of the term “reasonable rate
of return” in Law 54/1997 and as generally used in other regulations and policy statements,
and by Spanish courts.!?

In development of Law 54/1997, Spain enacted Royal Decree (“RD”) 2818/1998 on the
production of electrical energy by facilities supported by renewable energy, wastes and
cogeneration resources. RD 2818/1998 provided for the possibility for RE generators to
sell electricity under either a regulated tariff (some technologies did not have this option)
or a premium paid over its wholesale market price.'? It also provided for the periodical
updating and review of tariffs and premiums applicable to RE producers.'*

The promotion and development of RE had also come to be an important goal for the
European Union (“EU”). EU targets and objectives have been set by reference to the global
objectives agreed in the Kyoto Protocol. In turn, the Spanish regulatory regime for
renewables “...must be understood within [...] the policies of the European Union, both in
the field of energy and the environment...”!> Spain does not dispute that the Special
Regime for RE producers was introduced and also maintained based on the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Kyoto Protocol.

On 27 September 2001, the EU adopted Directive 2001/77/EC “on the Promotion of
Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources in the Internal Electricity Market”
(the “2001 Renewables Directive”). The 2001 Renewables Directive recognized the need
for public support in favour of RE sources, including mechanisms such as green
certificates, investment aid, tax exemptions or reductions, tax refunds and direct price
support schemes.' It further required EU Member States to take appropriate measures to
meet targets on the reduction of emission of greenhouse gasses, as well as to increase the
proportion of electricity produced using renewable resources and to set national indicative
targets consistent with the global indicative target of 12% of gross domestic energy
consumption from renewable sources by 2010.'7

Moreover, the 2001 Renewables Directive required members to bring into force the laws,
regulations and administrative provisions necessary to comply with the directive no later
than 2003,'* and to ensure that the charging of transmission and distribution fees did not
discriminate against electricity from RE sources.'? The targets set out in the 2001
Renewables Directive for RE production and consumption became a key driver behind the
Respondent's actions to encourage investments in RE projects.” Spain’s indicative target
was to draw 29.4% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2010.7!

On 12 March 2004, the Respondent introduced RD 436/2004.” Spain intended to establish
a lasting economic regime for RE facilities eligible under the Special Regime, through RD
436/2004 (and later through RD 661/2007).> RD 436/2004 sought to unify the existing
regulation developing Law 54/1997, particularly regarding the economic regime applicable

to Special Regime producers. It also sought to promote investment in RE production by
offering security and stability in the calculation of the compensation offered to Special
Regime producers. RD 436/2004 established the possibility for Special Regime
producers to sell the energy produced either (i) at a regulated fixed tariff, or (ii) at market
price plus a premium payment per unit of electricity.°> The exact value of both the fixed
tariff and the premium would be tied to market fluctuations and subject to change on an
annual basis.”

RD 436/2004 further established that the tariffs, premiums and incentives provided therein
would be reviewed and modified periodically. Also, tariffs, premiums, incentives and
complements resulting from any such revisions would be applicable only to facilities
commencing operations after the date of entry into force of the corresponding
modifications.””

The Claimants explain that RD 436/2004 did not provide for a fixed level of remuneration;
rather, “the regulated tariff and premium it provided were calculated as a percentage of the
yearly average tariff paid by all electricity consumers, which was itself set by reference to

> 28

market prices”.

The Instituto para la Diversificacion y Ahorro de la Energia (“IDAE”, for its acronym in
Spanish), an advisory body to the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Commerce
(the “Ministry”), set out a series of recommendations to assist in further increasing
investment in the RE sector in Spain through the Plan for the Promotion of Renewable
Energies in Spain 2005-2010 (the “2005-2010 Plan”).” The 2005-2010 Plan states that RD
436/2004 set out an economic framework sufficiently favourable for the development of
the thermosolar electricity sector.*” However, it limits the conditions for retribution by
setting up a maximum of 200MW. It also expressly acknowledged that due to the
technologies’ low profitability, higher premiums were necessary to secure the
sustainability to the project. It identified a series of economic, technological and normative

third of electricity demand will be covered by high energy efficient technologies and by renewable energies
without any increase in the production cost of the electricity system compared to the forecasts used to set the tariff
methodology in 2002. With this contribution of the special regime, it will be possible to reach the goal set out in
the 1997 Electricity Act, ie. to ensure that by the year 2010 renewable energy sources cover at least 12% of total
energy demand in Spain.”).

barriers to developing thermoelectric projects, including the need for investment assistance
or subsidies for early projects, little regulation for thermoelectric plants, and limitations on
current premiums and tariff for plants within the 200MW threshold.*!

On 23 June 2006, the Respondent introduced Royal Decree Law (“RDL”) 7/2006, on the
adoption of urgent measures for the energy sector. RDL 7/2006 provided that any revisions
made by the Government to the medium tariff paid would not be applicable to the prices,
premiums, incentives and tariffs granted to RE producers subject to the Special Regime,
until the provisions of RDL 7/2006 were further regulated.*? Additionally, RDL 7/2006
amended Article 30 of Law 54/1997, in order to provide “priority access to transport and
distribution networks” to the energy produced by producers subject to the Special
Regime.** However, this priority of access was subject to the “maintenance and safety of
such networks.”

Although the growth experienced as a result of the Special Regime had been considerable,
the objectives sought were still far from being reached.*> Specifically, there was a need to
modify the compensation regime available to Special Regime producers to take into
consideration certain variables that had not been considered by RD 436/2004, and de-link
such compensation from the reference tariff used to date, as well as to regulate certain
technical aspects and thus contribute to the growth of RE technologies.**

As a result, on 25 May 2007, RD 436/2004 was repealed and replaced by RD 661/2007.
RD 661/2007 sought to develop the principles in Law 54/1997, “guaranteeing the owners
of [Special Regime] facilities... a reasonable return on their investments, and the
consumers of electricity an assignment of the costs attributable to the electricity system
which is also reasonable.”>” Hence, RD 661/2007 sought to grant RE producers stability in
time, allowing them to do medium and long-term planning while obtaining a sufficient and
reasonable return.** Moreover, by the adoption of RD 661/2007, the Respondent sought to
achieve its national target set by the 2001 Renewables Directive.*? In accordance with the

“The aim of this Royal Decree is to increase remuneration for
facilities using newer technologies, such as biomass and solar-
thermal, in order to comply with targets outlined under the [2005-
2010 Plan] and those agreed upon between Spain and the European
Union. As these renewable energy technologies are developed,
renewable energy shall cover 12% of Spain’s energy needs by 2010.
[...] With regard to technologies in need of a boost in view of their
limited development, such as biogas or solar-thermoelectric,
profitability shall rise to 8% for facilities that choose to supply
distributors and between 7% and 11% return for those participating
in the wholesale market. Tariffs shall be reviewed every 4 years,
taking into account compliance with the established targets. Such a
revision shall allow for adjustments to be made to the tariff in virtue
of new costs and the level of compliance with the targets. Future tariff
revisions shall not be applied to existing facilities. This guarantees
legal certainty for the electricity producer and stability for the sector,
thereby favouring development. [...]””

Article 2 of RD 661/2007 provided that the Special Regime would be applicable to
“facilities which employ any non-consumable renewable energies, biomass, or any type of
biofuels, as their primary energy, upon condition that the owner does not carry out any
production activity under the ordinary regime.”"!

RD 661/2007 established a fixed tariff or premium system where Special Regime
producers could sell electricity, subject to certain floors and caps, either a) selling
electricity to the system through the transportation or distribution grid, receiving in
exchange a regulated tariff, fixed for all the programming periods, expressed in Euro cents
per kilowatt/hour (“Fixed Tariff’), or b) selling the electricity in the electric energy
production market, in which case, the sale price of the electricity would be the price
obtained in the organized market or the price freely negotiated by the owner or
representative of the facility, supplemented, where applicable, by a premium in Euro cents
per kilowatt/hour (“Premium”).”” The choice between these two options of feed-in-tariff
mechanisms provided in RD 661/2007 (“FIT”) applied for a one-year term. For
technologies such as CSP, the Premium option was subject to lower and upper thresholds.
According to the Claimants, generators were incentivised to opt for the Premium option,
since the Fixed Tariff had been set close to the floor level of the Premium.*?

Additionally, RD 661/2007 offered the following features:

which the deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1
January of the second year following the year in which the revision
shall have been performed.’”*5

The Parties disagree as to the interpretation of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007.

After RD 661/2007 entered into force, the EU approved the 2009/28/EC Directive “on the
promotion and use of energy from renewable sources and amending and subsequently
repealing Directives 2001/77/EC and 2003/30/EC” on 23 April 2009 (the “2009 EU
Directive”). After reaffirming the EU’s commitment to the promotion of RE, this Directive
established the objective that by 2020 the EU would seek to obtain 20% of its total energy
consumption requirements from RE sources.

Meanwhile, between 2007 and 2009 Spain prepared and displayed several promotional
materials, including brochures and presentations, where it touched upon the stability of its
investment framework and the incentives provided by RD 661/2007.*°

Spain explains that costs of the SES and the electricity bill for Spanish consumers have
grown exponentially since 2003.4” Spain further argues that despite raising tolls and
charges permanently over the years, a growing tariff deficit has arisen from the difference
between the regulated tariffs set by the Government and paid by consumers and the real
costs associated with said tariffs (the “Tariff Deficit”).** Thus, in the midst of the global
financial crisis, which severely affected Spain’s finances, the Respondent enacted
RDL 6/2009, intended to address such Tariff Deficit.4” RDL 6/2009 established maximum
tariff deficit limits for the years 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012, and provided that the Tariff
Deficit should be eliminated by 2013.*°

100. Additionally, in order to limit the number of facilities that would benefit from the Special

Regime and to thus have a greater control over the costs borne by the SES, RDL 6/2009
also introduced a pre-assignment process, requiring all RE facilities to register with the
Pre-Assignment Register before registering with the RAIPRE. This was a mandatory
requisite for facilities to be eligible for receiving the benefits granted under the Special
Regime.*! After having obtained the Pre-Assignment Register, the plant had a deadline of

36 months to be finally registered with the RAIPRE in order to benefit from the
RD 661/2007 economic regime.

101. As of 7 May 2009, date on which RDL 6/2009 was introduced, CSP facilities registered

with the RAIPRE had a total installed capacity of 81 MW.*? However, this was far from
the 500 MW target set forth in RDL 661/2007.% Later, by 19 November 2009, 104
registration requests representing 4.499 MW from CSP technology had been filed pursuant
to RDL 6/2009, seeking to qualify under the Special Regime pursuant to RD 661/2007.4
Accepting such requests would result in a total installed capacity exceeding the objectives
set forth in RD 661/2007 for the year 2010. The Government thus analysed the technical
and economic impact that the entry into operation of an installed capacity significantly
exceeding the established goal would have.*> On 19 November 2009 the Government
approved the progressive registration of all such new facilities with the Pre-Assignment
Registry and with the RAIPRE, as well as their progressive entry into operation, until 1
January 2014.°°

102. CSP and wind RE associations entered into discussions with the Ministry regarding future

modifications to be made to the remuneration framework applicable to them. On July 2010,
the Ministry issued a press release announcing that the parties had reached an agreement,
including “short-term measures, which will allow the impact of the price of electricity from
these technologies to be reduced, as well as long-term measures, which will guarantee
future stability for both sectors.”5” This agreement (the “July 2010 Agreement”) covered
the following issues:

(a) The CSP plants waived access to the Premium option during their first year of
operations.

(c) The number of hours with a right to compensation above market prices would be
limited, in accordance with the provisions of the 2005-2010 Plan regarding
calculation of the facilities’ profitability.

103. The press release asserted that the measures agreed did not jeopardize the profitability of

existing facilities and guaranteed that RE generation above the expected amount would
benefit consumers and not compromise the system’s economic sustainability. Likewise, it
provided that the agreement reached entailed “the reinforcement of the visibility and
stability of the regulation of these technologies in the future, guaranteeing the current
incentives and rates of RD 661/2007 for the facilities in operation (and for those included
in the [Pre-Assignment Registry]) starting in 2013.”5*

104. On 19 November 2010, the Respondent introduced RD 1565/2010, which regulated and

modified certain aspects related to electrical production under the Special Regime.
RD 1565/2010 limited to 25 the number of years during which photovoltaic (“PV”)
installations would be subject to the regulated tariffs set forth in the RD 661/2007 regime.*°
Importantly, RD 1565/2010 was only applicable to PV producers and did not refer to CSP
or wind producers.

105. Spain then enacted RD 1614/2010 on 7 December 2010, regulating and modifying certain

issues related to the production of energy from CSP and wind sources. RD 1614/2010 was
intended to “resolve certain inefficiencies in the application of... RDL 6/2009,” in line
with the July 2010 Agreement. Specifically, RD 1614/2010 limited the number of hours
per year during which installations were entitled to payment under the FIT pursuant to
RD 661/2010.*! It further provided that CSP facilities would not be eligible for selling
electricity under the Premium option during their first year of operation or during the first
12 months after the entry into force of RD 1614/2010, if the plant had already obtained its
final commissioning certificate.°? However, during this first year, CSP installations were
allowed to increase the percentage of electricity generated from secondary fuel, including
gas, up to 15%, and still benefit from the Fixed Tariff for their entire electricity output.
Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 expressly provided the following:

“For solar thermoelectric technology facilities that fall under RD
661/2007 [...] revisions of tariffs, premiums and upper and lower
limits referred to by article 44.3 of the aforementioned Royal Decree,

4.8, extended until 31 December 2013 for those facilities associated
to phase 4 envisaged in the Agreement of the Council of Ministers of
13 November 2009.”

106. On 23 December 2010, Spain enacted RDL 14/2010 implementing measures which sought
to address the Tariff Deficit and ensure the economic sustainability of the SES.“ RDL
14/2010 introduced cuts to the number of hours for which PV facilities would benefit from
the tariffs of the RD 661/2007 Special Regime,® and created access tolls to be paid by
producers (both from the Ordinary Regime and the Special Regime) and consumers for the
use of the transportation and distribution grids.®° A few days later, on 29 December 2010,
Ministerial Order No. ITC /3353/2010 was passed which, inter alia, increased the lower
and upper caps under the Premium option for CSP plants.°”

107. RDL 14/2010 was understood by PV producers as being a retroactive modification of the
remuneration regime to which they were entitled. As a consequence, claims were filed
before the Spanish Supreme Court, questioning the validity of RD 1565/2010 and RDL
14/2010. The Supreme Court issued a series of judgments rejecting such claims,
establishing that the remuneration regime applicable to RE producers could be validly
modified, in accordance with the principle of reasonable return (the “2012 Judgments”).
The Respondent considers these judgments to be a reiteration of the Supreme Court’s
jurisprudence on the limits and scope of the principle of reasonable return, which should
have been taken into account by the Claimants when analysing the legal framework of their

sector, and that the outcome of these judgments is irrelevant to assess the Claimants’

expectations, since they made their investments in the Andasol Plants in June 2011.

fundamental element in determining the specific extent of investors’ rights and obligations
under Spanish law.’! Consequently, it is an element that has to be considered in
determining any legitimate expectations that the Claimants might have had. The Claimants
argue to the contrary that the Supreme Court’s case law cannot have been understood to
override the clear and unambiguous statements made by Spain concerning the meaning of
RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010.” They also assert that the fact that measures might be
considered valid as a matter of Spanish law does not render the measures legal under
international law and that, in any event, the Supreme Court judgments on which Spain
relies do not support its arguments.”

109. The Claimants first became aware of the Spanish conglomerate Actividades de

Construccién y Servicios, S.A.’s (“ACS”) intention to sell a large part of its RE generation
assets in the autumn of 2010.” Later, in February 2011, Antin was approached by RREEF
Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited (“RREEF”), a company in the Deutsche Bank group, to
consider a possible investment in certain assets owned by ACS.” The specific assets
concerned were shares owned by ACS in the Spanish companies Andasol-1 Central
Termosolar UNO S.A. and Andasol-2 Central Termosolar DOS S.A. (jointly, the “Andasol
Companies”), each one of which owns and operates each of the Andasol-1 Plant and the
Andasol-2 Plant.”

110. Construction of the Andasol Plants, located in the province of Granada, southern Spain,

were finished in 2008 and 2009. The Andasol-1 Plant received its final commissioning
certificate on 25 November 2008 and registered with the RAIPRE on 24 April 2009, while
the Andasol-2 Plant received its commissioning certificate on 5 June 2009 and registered
with the RAIPRE on 22 December 2009.”’ The Andasol-2 Plant also registered with the
Pre-Assignment Registry and started selling energy within the 36 months following the
date of notification of said registration.”* The Andasol-1 Plant, however, did not have to
register with the Pre-Assignment Registry, since it was already in operation by the time
RDL 6/2009 came into force. Spain does not dispute that, as a consequence, both Andasol

Plants were qualified to receive Special Regime benefits under RD 661/2007 and RD
1614/2010.

111. Between March and June 2011, Antin and RREEF carried out a due diligence process

regarding a potential investment in the Andasol Companies. In March 2011, the Antin
Investment Committee discussed the investment opportunity and authorized a preliminary
due diligence.” The Antin project team received contractual and financing documents, as
well as due diligence reports provided by ACS, authored by Clifford Chance LLP,
Deloitte S.L. and Alatec Ingenieros Consultores y Arquitectos (“Alatec”).*°

112. The 9 March 2011 Antin Investment Committee meeting minutes note that:

“CSP technology was discussed. A more detailed presentation will
be made in subsequent IC. The technology emerged commercially in
the 1980s in California but few plants were built post 1990s. This
was because there is a high investment cost which requires state
support in the form of subsidies or tax breaks. In the 1990s, as a result
of low gas prices, there was a focus on building CCGTs to satisfy
electricity demands. CSP development has restarted in Spain and the
US as a result of government support schemes.

Spanish regulation for renewables has recently changed, in particular
affecting solar PV. The CSP sector is dominated by large Spanish
contractors and their association has negotiated changes to regulation
which did not have a significant negative impact on the projects (i.e.
fixed tariff for 2011 and limitation of hours of production). Spain is
a world leader in CSP and Spanish contractors are involved in
exporting their technology to many countries abroad. Therefore it is
expected that CSP will be more sheltered from regulatory change.”*!

113. An Antin PowerPoint presentation also dated 9 March 2011 described the thermosolar

regulation in Spain, and in regard to RD1614/2010, stated that “in order to contribute to
the economic sustainability of the system, the Government introduced temporary
modifications to the remuneration framework” and that the “new Royal Decree 1614/2010
prevents plants from choosing the market option during their first year of operation,”
“[t]hey are forced to choose the regulated tariff option” and “[t]hose facilities with COD

prior to December 9, 2010 will move on to the tariff option from January 1, 2011 until
December 31, 2011.”*?

114. Later, in a 17 March 2011 Antin Investment Committee meeting, a due diligence budget

was approved with the intention to “carry out a limited amount of market, technical and
legal due diligence over a period of 2 weeks to provide ACS with a firmed up indicative
offer subject to confirmatory due diligence.”*? The Antin Investment Committee thus
approved the formation of a consortium with RREEF to potentially bid for the ACS’ CSP
plants, subject to discussion with RREEF.

115. The due diligence process carried out by Antin involved legal counsel (Herbert Smith

Freehills in Madrid (“Herbert Smith”), market analyst (Péyry Management Consulting
(“Péyry”), financial advisors (Deutsche Bank and Lazard Limited) and technical experts
(Altermia Asesores Técnicos, S.L. (“Altermia”).** It was focused on the following:
“Review of VDD (technical, legal, accounting & tax). Herbert Smith review of project
contracts (EPC and P&M) and finance agreements. Altermia review of solar resource and
production.”*°

116. Péyry submitted three reports: an “off the shelf’ report in March of 2011 (“Péyry’s First

g

Report”), a market analysis focusing on Spain’s Tariff Deficit in May 2011 (“Péyry’s
Second Report”), and a “capture price analysis” report for purposes of determining
projections of market prices*® Péyry’s First Report analysed the differences between the
PV and CSP sectors in Spain and the Tariff Deficit. Regarding RD 1614/2010, it concluded
that “[t]he CSP industry has essentially remained unaffected, apart from the first year of
operation with no real damage inflicted on its project economics”, and that “[t]he major
concern from the CSP industry is the absence of a regulatory framework beyond 2014,
although given the lobbying power of the companies involved we feel that the industry is
in a far safer position than PV.”*”

117. Also, according to Péyry’s First Report, considering the increase in Brent prices at the
time, the political will to mitigate the impact of rising electricity costs to end-users would
increase, potentially leading the Government to avoid introducing the required increases in
third party access charges (these represent the tariff to access the electricity network, and
form part of the electricity bill). The zero-tariff deficit would thus be unlikely to be met by
2012, while in a realistic scenario such target would be met by 2014-2015 through yearly
10% tariff to access increases.** Péyry then concluded that:

“If the zero tariff deficit target by end of 2012 is postponed, it will
open up the opportunity to more deficit generation. Considering the
Government behaviour, it is likely that future changes might be
implemented if considered needed. RDL 14/2010 is aimed at tackling
the lack of funds in the electricity system, reducing the revenue of
renewable generators as well as introducing additional revenue
sources (i.e., grid tolls). We feel that the Government is in a position
to continue with the same energy policy, if considered a requirement,
including implementation of further reductions in remuneration to
renewables and non-renewable technologies.”*?

118. Two months later, in Péyry’s Second Report, it added that the trend was for subsidies in
the electricity system to be reduced or disappear. For Poyry, the risk was being driven by
the interaction of factors inherent to the SES and the power of different lobbying groups,
noting that “[iJ]n this regard, CSP is quite a safe market place as major Spanish construction
companies are involved in this business, which certainly implies a smaller risk exposure
than other RES technologies.”””

119. Altermia’s technical due diligence report of July 2011 states that the design criteria for the
type of plants considered allowed for an average working lifespan of 30 years, providing
preventative, predictive and corrective maintenance procedures were followed, in
compliance with good engineering practice.°! Altermia also covered the plants’ thermal
storage system and their use of natural gas.””

120. Antin instructed Herbert Smith to analyse the regulatory regime for CSP plants. In its due
diligence report dated 25 March 2011 (the “ HS Report’), Herbert Smith stated that Article
44(3) of RD 661/2007 provides that “reviews to the tariff and the caps and floors would
only affect installations placed into operation after 1 January of the second year after the
review”, and that this provisions sets out the “untouchability of the regulated tariff and the

26

caps and floors.”*? It noted, however, that this provision mentions only the tariff and the
caps and floors, not the premium. The Ministry of Industry has therefore interpreted RD
661/2007 in meaning that it does not protect the premiums enjoyed by installations, and
that future legislation could alter and reduce premiums without altering the tariff or the
caps and floors.” In contrast, according to Herbert Smith, RD 1614/2010, “guarantees that
the current premiums, tariffs and the floors and caps will not be modified” for installations
that have either achieved definitive registration in the RAIPRE by 7 May 2009 or been
registered in the RAIPRE.

121. The HS Report added that “the Supreme Court has, in three judgments [...] expressly
acknowledged the possibility of retroactively changing the remunerative regime applicable
to electricity generation installations subject to the special regime, provided that this
remains within the limits established by the LSE, i.e. provided that an investor is able to
obtain a reasonable return on its investments, which would therefore not be in violation of

legitimate confidence and legal protection [...].”°°

122. However, according to the HS Report, “all the Supreme Court’s case law in this regard has

related to the wording of RD 661/2007, without taking into account the new elements
introduced by RD 1614/2010. In effect, this more recent Royal Decree introduced
substantial new elements, and for the first time acknowledges that the current premiums,
tariffs and the upper and lower limits will not be modified for installations (i) that have
achieved definitive registration in the [RAIPRE] by 7 May 2009, and (ii) registered in the

[Pre-Assignment Registry].”°°

123. The HS Report concluded that “the Government could (although highly improbable) in the

ge 8

future approve a new provision having the same (Royal Decree) or a higher rank (Act) to
modify the protection currently afforded in RD 1614/2010. Nevertheless, precisely due to
the explicit and strong protection contained in RD 1614/2010, in the unlikely event that the
Government were to change the regulation to the detriment of the aforementioned
installations, the owner of the installation would have a very strong case before the
Courts.”””

124. Spain takes issue with certain aspects of the HS Report, including its analysis of the effects

and applicability of Supreme Court judgments.*

125. At the 13 April 2011 Antin Investment Committee meeting, Antin discussed the due

101

diligence carried out thus far, and pointed to the following as some of the key investment
considerations: the CSP plants were best in class and developed by the world leader in the
sector; their storage capacity enabled the plants to be the only renewable producers able to
provide dispatchable electricity;°” the “[a]ttractive regulatory regime has been sheltered
from any significant changes and benefits from the support and lobby power of major
Spanish corporates,” and there were “[s]table and predictable cash flows underpinned by
floor and cap of market premium over pool electricity prices.”!°° The transaction then
under consideration concerned the sale of up to 100% of seven CSP plants, of which Antin
would acquire two or three. At the time, the plants were “valued at a 15% IRR resulting in
a 1.7x-2.0x MoM” and an “[a]verage yield in the low-to mid-teens”!°'. It was further stated
that:

“Spain has a tariff deficit as a result of regulated electricity prices not
reflecting the actual cost of producing electricity. This deficit has
been accumulating over the past few years. The government has a
plan to reduce the tariff deficit to zero by 2013. The regulatory
changes in renewables last year were in part motivated by this desire
to reduce the tariff deficit. The project team will carry out a more in
depth analysis of the tariff deficit and its potential impact on CSP
plants during the next phase of the process.

The CSP sector has not been significantly affected by recent
regulatory changes (see slides 14 and 15). A key reason for this is the
involvement of large Spanish corporates in the sector and their lobby
power with the government. Additionally, Spain is a world leader in
CSP and it has become a very relevant export industry.

Further comfort on the future stability of regulation would be
obtained from the involvement of major Spanish utilities. Today the
Spanish CSP market is dominated by large contractors, although

system. — Energy storage allows CSP plants to be dispatchable and provide electricity during demand peaks
(receiving therefore higher prices). — The steam turbine can produce electricity using gas, allowing the plants to
provide electricity during demand peaks, cloudy days or during the night.” [footnote omitted].

some like Acciona could be considered a utility. Iberdrola owns an
operational plant and one that is pre-registered. The project team will
find out if they have further projects in the pipeline, underpinning
their support to the sector.”!

126. An Antin PowerPoint presentation also dated 13 April 2011 described the recent changes

to the Spanish regulatory framework in RDL 1614/2010 stating that the “regulatory
framework is now more robust against retroactive changes” and the “[l]imited impact of
recent changes over thermo solar industry in Spain which clearly show the commitment
and support of this technology by the Government (contrary to the PV sector).”!°°

127. The Claimants met with certain Government officers as part of their due diligence process.

On 20 May 2011 Mauricio Bolafia, an Antin partner, together with Mr. Francisco Cabeza
(on behalf of RREEF), Herbert Smith and Lazard representatives, met with Mr. Miguel
Vizcaino, head of the legal department at the Ministry. The Parties disagree as to the
content and consequences of said meeting. The Claimants allege, based upon Mr. Bolaiia’s
witness statement and an email prepared by him, that during the meeting Mr. Vizcaino
confirmed that RD 1614/2010 provided a long-term, stable regulatory framework for CSP
producers, specifically mentioning that any future changes would not affect the existing
facilities, such as the Andasol Plants.!° According to Mr. Bolafia’s Statement, Mr.
Vizcaino also affirmed that the Tariff Deficit was a manageable issue, and explained that
the CSP and PV sectors were different since the former produces more electricity using
less subsidies than the latter, which explained the retroactive changes affecting PV
facilities.'°°

128. An email sent by Mr. Cabeza after the meeting on 20 May 2010 included the following

remarks: “[c]onfirmation that the current decree provides a long term, stable regulatory
framework for Termo Solar (“TS”). Obviously, this has to be taken with some caution
(“nothing is written in marble”) but any changes/adjustments in the future would not be to

the detriment of current investors.”!°°

Court doctrine on “reasonable return” and notes that the capital basis for a returns
calculation is unclear, but Spanish courts recognize a legal protection for investors in
regulated assets, which cannot be breached by the Government.'”

130. The Respondent does not deny that the meeting took place. However; Spain argues that

there is no evidence as to its contents, except for an email with subjective and ambiguous
conclusions drawn by a meeting attendant.!!° Moreover, the Respondent points out that,
even as per said email, Mr. Vizcaino explained that the Supreme Court had established the
doctrine of reasonable return on investments, and that it could not be breached.!!! In any
event, according to the Respondent, no commitments to petrify the legal system in the
sense alleged by the Claimants could come from a public official, and no legitimate
expectations could arise from an individual lacking the capacity or competence to fulfil
them.!!?

131. According to the Claimants, Mr. Bolafia also met with the General Secretary, the Chief

Legal Advisor and the Assistant Director for Special Regimes of the Spanish National
Energy Commission (“CNE”, for its acronym in Spanish), on behalf of Antin on 25 May
2011. According to the Claimants, the CNE confirmed during the meeting the information
that had been previously provided by the Ministry, i.e. that the CSP sector was subject to
a stable regulatory regime.''? The Respondent alleges that there is no evidence on the
content of such meeting and that, in any event, the opinions allegedly expressed therein by
the CNE’s officers were contrary to the official opinion expressed by the CNE in its report
of 7 March 2012.''*

132. At Antin Investment Committee meetings in June 2011, presentations made considered

107

that there was strong Government support for the CSP sector, as evidenced from the recent
regulatory changes and as communicated in meetings with the Ministry and the CNE. It

was acknowledged that “[w]hilst changes to regulation can never be ruled out, the
representatives met considered the CSP regulation review closed” and that changes to
Article 54 of RD 1614/2010 for CSP would be very difficult from a legal, litigation or
reputational standpoint, since the protection given under Article 4 is unique in Spanish
regulatory history.''® The PowerPoint presentation also mentioned that in the May 2011
meetings with the Ministry and the CNE it was discussed that there were significant
differences between the PV and CSP sectors: PV plants were owned by thousands of small
operators with no lobby power; the PV sector was involved in widespread fraud; and while
in 2010 CSP plants generated 0.8% of electricity and received 3% of Special Regime
subsidies, PV plants generated 7% of the electricity and received 37% of the Special
Regime subsidies.!!® On RDL 1614/2010, it was noted that for the first time in Spanish RE
regulation, the fixed tariff, premium, cap and floor could not be modified for CSP and
wind, and therefore, a retroactive change was hard to implement as operators would have
a much stronger case in court than before.!!7

133. Additionally, the presentation noted that even though the Tariff Deficit existed prior to the

widespread deployment of renewables, such tariff has grown significantly over the past
few years in part due to the increasing contribution of Special Regime generators, and
mainly the PV sector.''* In order to reduce the Tariff Deficit, the Spanish government had
announced temporary modifications to the Special Regime (mainly for the PV sector).
However, alternatives which might be considered to deal with the Tariff Deficit included
increasing third-party access charges (but there was a political reluctance to significantly
increase electricity bills), reducing special regime subsidies, imposing a windfall profit tax
on nuclear or hydroelectric energy producers or increasing the amount of tariff deficit to
be securitised.!"”

134. Antin asserts that, based upon the findings of its due diligence process, it decided to

19

120

proceed with the investment in the Andasol Companies. Thus, on 27 June 2011 Antin
Termosolar was incorporated and on 30 June 2011 a share purchase agreement was
concluded, by which Antin Termosolar would acquire 45% of the issued share capital of
the Andasol Companies.'?° The acquisition became effective on 31 August 2011 once the

conditions precedent in the share purchase agreement were met.'?! Antin Termosolar and
REEFF also agreed to take on a proportionate share in the existing shareholders’ loans and
to an earn-out mechanism in favour of ACS, should the Andasol Plants sustain certain
performance levels.'7*

135. The Claimants explain that by 2010 and 2011 Spain was broadly in line with the target of

sourcing 22.1% of its electricity from renewable sources, and by 2012 with a total of 1,950
MW, with about 2,300 MW in 2013, Spain had more CSP capacity than any other country
in the world.'

136. On 27 January 2012, a few months after the Claimants had completed their investment in

the Andasol Companies, Spain enacted RDL 1/2012. This RDL suppressed the application
of the economic incentives granted by the RD 661/2007 Special Regime (i.e. regulated
tariffs, premiums and upper and lower limits) for RE production facilities that had not been
registered with the Pre-Assignment Registry as of the date of entry into force of
RDL 1/2012.!*4 Additionally, RDL 1/2012 suspended registration of new facilities with
the Pre-Assignment Registry.'2* However, the provisions of RDL 1/2012 were not made
applicable to Special Regime facilities that had already completed registration with the
RAIPRE, as was the case for the Andasol Plants.

137. On 27 January 2012, the Secretary of State for Energy wrote to the President of the CNE

requesting that the CNE prepare a report on proposing regulatory measures to address the
Tariff Deficit.'2° Some of the measures eventually proposed by the CNE included the
“harmonisation” of the premium of solar thermoelectric energy, by way of reducing the
premium of pre-registered CSP plants by 12%. In accordance with the report issued by the
CNE in 2012, correcting the Premium in such a way that it maintains the principle of a
reasonable return provided by law.'2”

138. The Tariff Deficit was also addressed in the National Reform Programme of 27 April 2012,

which sets out a broad economic strategy to address the economic and financial crisis in
Spain and the growing public debt.!"* Regarding the SES, the 2012 National Reform
Programme noted that there was an imbalance between the costs and the revenues of the

SES, the Government was committed to eliminating the tariff deficit by equally distributing
amongst consumers and the public and private sectors the costs of the cost-reduction
measures, and the Special Regime Premiums was identified as one of the most significant
costs of the SES.'?° Such an energy reform was briefly mentioned in other documents or
reports issued by the Government in 2012.'°

139. On 28 December 2012, Spain enacted Law 15/2012, introducing certain changes to the

Special Regime applicable to CSP producers. Particularly, it added a new numeral to
Article 30 of Law 54/1997, which provided the following:

“The electricity that is attributable to the use of a fuel in a generation
facility that uses as its primary energy any non-consumable
renewable energies shall not be subject to the premium economic
regime, other than in the case of hybrid facilities which use non-
consumable and consumable sources of renewable energy, in which
case the electricity attributable to the use of the consumable source
of renewable energy is subject to the bonified economic regime.”'>!

140. The above provision eliminated the application of the RD 661/2007 economic regime (and

particularly the right to receive a FIT) to the electricity produced using fossil fuels (such
as natural gas, in the Andasol Plants), starting as of 1 January 2013.'°? According to
Claimants, this lead to a substantial reduction of the amount of electricity produced and a
consequential reduction in the revenues of the Andasol Plants. '*4

141. Law 15/2012 also created a tax on the value of the production of electrical energy (the

129

130

“TVPEE”), imposed on the total revenue coming from the production and feeding of
electricity into the national grid. The TVPEE, which amounts to 7% of such revenue, was
made applicable to all energy producers, both conventional and renewable, including those
subject to the Special Regime.'** The Parties disagree as to the nature of the TVPEE: while
the Respondent considers that it is a tax of general application under both Spanish law and
international law,'*> the Claimants contend that, in practice, the TVPEE amounts to a

measure of general application.'*°

142. A month later, on | February 2013, Spain introduced RDL 2/2013, in order to reduce the
costs of the Special Regime and hence avoid an increase in the access tolls paid by
consumers.'*” For such purpose, through RDL 2/2013, Spain introduced several measures
that are contested by the Claimants in these proceedings.

143. First, in accordance with its Article 1, with effect as of 1 January 2013, all compensations,
tariffs and premiums of the electrical system that were previously updated in accordance
with the CPI —including those applicable to producers under the Special Regime— would
now be updated in accordance with a CPI at constant tax rates, excluding unprocessed
foods and energy products. '3*

144. Second, under Article 2 of RDL 2/2013, where Special Regime producers chose the market
price plus Premium remuneration scheme, such Premium would be reduced to the amount
of EUR 0.0 cent/kWh, for both existing and future facilities. The Claimants argue that, in
practice, the Premium option for Special Regime producers was effectively eliminated.'*
Those Special Regime facilities that up until that moment had opted to sell their energy
under the Premium option would be deemed subject to the Fixed Tariff option as of 2
February 2013 with effect from 1 January 2013, unless they notified the Government that
they desired to opt for the Premium option, in which case such decision would be definitive
and they would not be allowed to opt for the Fixed Tariff option subsequently.'4° Antin

57 Exhibit C-0025, RDL 2/2013, 1 February 2013 (“RDL 2/2013”), Preamble (“In recent years, the growing
evolution of the cost elements of the electricity system has given rise to the appearance of imbalances between
said costs and the revenue obtained from regulated prices, In order to correct these imbalances, a series of urgent
measures during 2012 were adopted which affected both elements. [...]Data made public by the National Energy
Commission in its report 35/2012, of 20 December, concerning the proposal which established access fees as of
1 January 2013 and tariffs and premiums for special regime facilities, made manifest the appearance of new
deviations in the cost and revenue estimates caused by different factors, both for the closure of 2012 and for 2013
which, in the current economic context, would make it almost unfeasible to fund such costs with the electricity
fees and the elements expected to derive from the General State Budget. To a great extent these deviations are
due to a greater increase in the cost of the special regime on account of an increase in operating hours which was
greater than expected, to an increase in remuneration values due to their being indexed to the Brent price, and to
a decrease in revenue from fees due to a very marked fall in demand which was consolidated during this tax year.
The alternative that was raised would be a new increase in the access fees paid by consumers of electricity. This
measure would directly affect household economies and company competitiveness, both in a delicate situation
given the current economic situation. Faced with this scenario and in order to palliate this problem, the
Government has considered adopting certain urgent cost-reduction measures which avoid consumers having to
bear a new burden, thereby contributing to their being able to also collaborate in the economic recovery through
consumption and investment. [...]”

alleges that under such circumstances, no installation (including the Claimants’) had any

interest in opting for the Premium option.'*!

145. According to the Respondent, this measure was introduced in order to avoid an over-

remuneration of Special Regime producers while guaranteeing them a reasonable rate of
return, and preventing consumers from having to bear a new increase in the tariffs.'4? In
any event, the Respondent argues, the effects of this measure disappeared with the
adoption, a couple of months later, of the new subsidies model introduced by the global
reform of the SES, initiated with Law 24/2013.'3 To the contrary, the Claimants argue that
Spain’s claim of over-remuneration is baseless, and constituted an abrupt and
unprecedented departure from the RD 661/2007 basic legal framework.“

146. On 26 April 2013, the Claimants sent a letter to the President of the Spanish Government,

Mr. Mariano Rajoy, making reference to the changes to the legal regime applicable to CSP
plants. Said measures included RDL 12/2012, Law 15/2012, Law 16/2012 and RDL
2/2013. In that letter, the Claimants requested negotiations with the Spanish Government
and reserved their right to submit their claims to international arbitration.'*5 In response,
on 7 May 2013, the Spanish Government requested the Claimants to submit their request
for negotiations in Spanish.'#° On 15 May 2013, the Claimants complied with the
Respondent’s request.!47

147. On 12 July 2013, Spain introduced RDL 9/2013 amending Law 54/1997. Claimants

consider RDL 9/2013 a complete overhaul of the regulatory framework for the RE sector
and to have “wiped out” the entire RD 661/2007 economic regime.'** Specifically,
Article 1 of RDL 9/2013 amended Article 30(4) of RD 661/2007 in the following terms:

“4. Additionally, subject to the terms that the Council of Ministers
might adopt pursuant to Royal Decrees, in relation to the
remuneration for the generation of electricity calculated according to
market price, installations may receive a specific remuneration [the
Special Payment] composed of an amount per unit of installed
capacity. Such amount shall cover, as appropriate, the investment
costs of a standard installation that cannot be recovered through the

sale of energy, as well as an amount for the operation of the
installation to cover, as the case may be, the difference between
exploitation costs and the revenues obtained from the participation
of such a standard installation in the market.

For the calculation of that specific remuneration, the following
elements shall be considered, based on the installation’s regulatory
useful life and by reference to the activities carried out by an efficient
and well administered business:

a) The standard revenues for the sale of the generated energy valued
at market price of production;

b) The standard exploitation costs; .

c) The standard value of the initial investment. [...]

This remuneration regime shall not exceed the minimum required
level to cover the costs that are necessary for installations to compete
on an equal footing with the rest of the technologies in the market in
order to allow those installations to obtain a reasonable return, by
reference to the standard installation [...]

Such reasonable return will be based on, before taxes, the average
returns in the secondary market of the State’s ten-year bonds plus the
adequate differential.

The parameters of the remuneration regime can be revised every six
149

years.
Under amended Article 30(4), facilities under the Special Regime could only enjoy a
payment additional to the market value of electricity (the “Special Payment”), rather than
choosing between the Fixed Tariff and Premium options, which were eliminated.
Moreover, the Special Payment (i) would be calculated by reference to the costs of a
standard facility, as determined by the Government, and by reference to the activity carried
out by an efficient and well managed business, and (ii) would in no case surpass the
minimum level required for facilities to obtain a reasonable rate of return, based on the
return on State bonds in the secondary market. Furthermore, the entire remuneration regime
may be reviewed every six years.

Since RDL 9/2013 applies to both existing and new facilities, according to Antin, it
modifies considerably the Special Regime to which CSP facilities, including the Andasol
Plants, were subject prior to its entry into force. Its adoption gave rise to further protests
by the Claimants, which on 30 July 2013 sent a letter to the President of the Spanish

4 Exhibit C-0029, RDL 9/2013, 13 July 2013 (“RDL 9/2013”), Article 1.

Government asserting that RDL 9/2013 modified the regulatory framework applicable to
Antin’s investments and foreseen that such modifications would cause serious additional
damages thereto.'*° Claimants thus reiterated their request to hold a meeting with the
Government in order to discuss the dispute between the Parties.'*!

150. Spain continued to adopt further amendments to the regulation of the electricity sector. On

26 December 2013, the Respondent adopted Law 24/2013 which superseded Law 54/1997
and formally eliminated the distinction between the Ordinary Regime and the Special
Regime.'*? Thus, under the regime created by Law 24/2013, conventional and RE
generators were now subject to equal conditions, being the latter entitled exclusively to the
Special Payment created by RDL 9/2013.'* It also eliminated RE installations’ right of
priority of grid access and priority of dispatch.'™ By the time both RDL 9/2013 and
Law 24/2013 were adopted, Spain had not yet adopted a comprehensive regime on the
legal and economic regime of RE installations.'** For the following months, the Fixed
Tariff continued to apply (but not the Premium, which had been removed by RDL 2/2013),
and the payments received during such time would be discounted from any Special
Payment to be received once such Special Payments were defined at some later date.'*¢

151. The Respondent began the implementation of Law 24/2013 on 6 June 2014 by introducing

150

152

RD 413/2014, which regulated the production of electricity from renewable sources of
energy, cogeneration and waste. RD 413/2014, however, did not set out the parameters of
compensation for Standard Installations. Later, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, enacted
on 20 June 2014 as the second measure implementing Law 24/2013, set out the
remuneration parameters applicable to RE producers under the Law 24/2013 regime.
Under Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 the reasonable rate of return applicable to facilities
existing prior to the entry into force of RDL 9/2013 was set at 7.398%. '°7

152. Finally, on 14 October 2014, the Respondent introduced Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014,
for calculating the electricity produced by solar installations attributable to the use of fossil
fuels. As previously mentioned, pursuant to Law 15/2012, such electricity would not be
subject to the Special Payment applicable to RE. Order IET/1882/2014 provided that it
would apply to electricity produced from 1 January 2013, date of entry into force of
Law 15/2012, and thus any payments received as premiums or tariffs since that date for
electricity produced by using fossil fuels would have to be returned.'**

153. According to the Claimants, under the new regime applicable to RE facilities, which
includes the Andasol Plants, RE producers are entitled to obtain a Special Payment in
addition to the market price of the electricity produced by them, rather than being able to
choose between the Fixed Tariff and Premium options. CSP facilities are entitled to the
Special Payment only during a regulatory useful life of 25 years, rather than for the entire
operational life of the installations. Moreover, the Special Payment is calculated by
reference to a standard facility, without considering the specific circumstances of each
particular facility nor taking into account the costs incurred or investments made as a
consequence of local laws or regulations. Finally, the Special Payment is intended to be no
more than the minimum necessary to allow RE producers to obtain a reasonable rate of
return, calculated at 7.398% for existing facilities.

154. As a consequence of the above, Claimants claim that the regulatory regime applicable to
the Andasol Plants has changed considerably since the moment when Antin made its
investment in the Andasol Companies. According to the Claimants, these changes have
had_ significant harmful effects on the Andasol Companies, and thus on_ their
investments.'® In particular, according to the expert report submitted by the Claimants,
Premium payments expected under RD 661/2007 considerably exceeded the Special
Payments provided to RE producers under the new regime.'®° Additionally, according to
the Claimants, their free cash flows and their equity cash flows were also sensibly
reduced.'*! Thus, the Claimants intend to recover in this arbitration the damages they allege
to have suffered as a consequence of the regulatory changes introduced by the Respondent.

Vv. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS AND PRAYERS FOR RELIEF

155. The Claimants’ request for relief as stated in the Claimants’ Memorial (and reiterated in
the Claimants’ Reply) is as follows:

“537. For all of the foregoing reasons, the Claimants respectfully
request that the Tribunal enter an award in their favour and against
the Kingdom of Spain as follows:

(a) DECLARING that Spain has breached Article 10(1) of the ECT;
and

(b) ORDERING that Spain:

(i) provide full restitution to the Claimants by re-establishing the
situation which existed prior to Spain's breaches of the ECT, together
with compensation for all losses suffered before restitution; or

(ii) pay the Claimants compensation for all losses suffered as a result
of Spain's breaches of the ECT; and

in any event:

(iii) pay the Claimants pre-award interest at a rate of 2.07%

(iv) pay post-award interest, compounded monthly at a rate to be
determined by the Tribunal on the amounts awarded until full
payment thereof; and

(v) pay the Claimants the costs of this arbitration on a full-indemnity
basis, including all expenses that the Claimants have incurred or will
incur in respect of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, ICSID,
legal counsel, experts and consultants; and

(vi) any such other and further relief that the Tribunal shall deem just

and admissibility objections and order that the Respondent bear the cost of bringing said
objections.'%

157. In turn, in its Rejoinder, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:
“a) Declare its lacks of jurisdiction to hear the claims of the
Claimants, or if applicable their inadmissibility, in accordance with

what is set forth in section III of this Document, referring to

b) Secondarily, for the case that the Arbitral Tribunal decides that it
has jurisdiction to hear this dispute, that it dismiss all the claims of
the Claimants on the merits because the Kingdom of Spain has not
breached in any way the ECT, in accordance with what is stated in
paragraphs (A) and (B) of section IV of this Document, on the
substance of the matter;

c) Secondarily, that all rescionary claims of the Claimants are
dismissed inasmuch as the latter are not entitled to compensation in
accordance with what is set forth in paragraph (C) of section IV of
this document; and

d) Sentence the Claimants to pay all costs and expenses derived from
this arbitration, including ICSID administrative expenses,
arbitrators’ fees, and the fees of the legal representatives of the
Kingdom of Spain, their experts and advisors, as well as any other
cost or expense that has been incurred, all of this including a
reasonable rate of interest from the date on which these costs are
incurred and the date of their actual payment.”'

APPLICABLE LAW

Claimants consider that the relevant provisions to determine the law that applies to the
merits of this dispute are Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention and Article 26(6) of the
ECT, and that therefore the Tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance with the rules
of law agreed upon by the parties and, in the absence of such agreement, the Tribunal shall
apply “the law of the Contracting State party to the dispute (including its rules on the
conflict of laws) and such rules of international law as may be applicable" (Article 42(1)
of the ICSID Convention).!5

Claimants add that under Article 26(6) of the ECT, the parties have agreed the rules of law
applicable to the merits of the dispute, and therefore the Tribunal shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with the ECT and applicable rules and principles of international
law. Therefore, the ECT is the primary source of law and where the ECT is silent, the
Tribunal should apply customary international law and general principles of international
law.!©°

Respondent does not seem to contest that the Tribunal shall decide based on the ECT and
that the applicable law to the merits of the dispute is the one provided for under Article
26(6) thereof. According to the Respondent, EU law, including the treaties creating the

of the CJEU, constitute “applicable rules and principles of international law” for purposes
of Article 26(6).'°’ The Tribunal refers to this contention in paragraph 223 et seq. of this
Award. As to Spanish law, even though the Respondent invokes a series of domestic
provisions and decisions of Spanish courts, it does so in the context of facts that the
Claimants should have considered when making the investment and facts that the Tribunal
should consider in making its decision, particularly as regards to the alleged legitimate
expectations of the Claimants.

JURISDICTION
The Respondent submitted the following objections to jurisdiction:

(a) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae: since the Claimants are nationals
of EU Member States and the Respondent is a EU Member State, the Claimants are
not investors “of another Contracting Party” under Article 26(1) of the ECT.
Additionally, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, as well as Spain, were already
members of the EU at the time they ratified the ECT; therefore, they could not
“contract between them obligations within the internal Energy Market, harmonised
by the EU.”

(b) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae since the Claimants do not own or
control, directly or indirectly, the assets identified by them as their investment, and
therefore the only protected investment under ECT Article 1(6) is the shareholding
that Antin Termosolar owns in the Andasol Companies and the loans granted by it
to the Andasol Companies.

(c) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae to hear any claims related to the
TVPEE, given that Spain did not grant its consent to arbitrate disputes regarding
alleged violations of ECT Article 10(1) arising from tax measures.

(d) The Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear any claims related to Law 24/2013,
RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, since the Claimants did not
comply with the cooling-off period set forth in ECT Article 26.

In their Reply and in their Rejoinder, the Claimants submitted their arguments for rejecting
these objections.

A. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL LACKS JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

1. Respondent's Position

163. Spain argues that the Claimants are not investors “of another Contracting Party”, as

required by Article 26(1) of the ECT.'®

164. According to Article 26(1) of the ECT, the dispute submitted to arbitration must arise

between “a Contracting Party” and an “investor of another Contracting Party.” The
Respondent argues that the ECT does not apply to a dispute between an investor from the
EU and a Member State of the EU (“intra-EU dispute”), in relation to an investment made
in the territory of the EU (“intra-EU_investment”). For purposes of the ECT, intra-EU
investments cannot be considered foreign investments; this would be contrary to the
context, object and purpose of the ECT and to EU law. In this case, Luxembourg and the
Netherlands (countries of nationality of the Claimants), and the Respondent are Member
States of the EU and also Contracting Parties to the ECT.'”

165. Furthermore, the Respondent claims that since Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Spain

were Member States of the EU before ratifying the ECT, they could not acquire obligations
related to the internal energy market amongst themselves, specifically those set out in
Part III of the ECT.'7!

166. According to the Respondent, the Claimants’ investment within the internal electricity

market of the EU grants the Claimants a specific and preferential protection over that
conceded by the ECT. EU law is thus to be applied in preference to or prevailing over any
other law —including the law of the ECT— and displacing other national or international
provisions. Preferential application of EU law does not require proving that such other
treaty is more or less favourable.' Spain further notes that there is no incompatibility
between the ECT and EU law.'?

167. Spain alleges that the EU is an area of economic integration that includes in its rules

relating to the internal market an integral system for the promotion and protection of intra-
EU investments.! Energy policy forms part of the EU policies since before signing the

ECT.!” Spain’s promotion of investment in renewable energy is embedded within its
obligations as an EU Member State, assumed so as to reach the objectives established by
the EU Directives, including the protection of investors.!”° These Directives allowed Spain
to encourage investments through the concession of public aids allowed by the EU, subject
to certain limitations. The standard of EU protection forbids any type of regulation that
dissuades an EU investor from establishing itself in a specific Member State.'’’ Of note,
the text of the ECT itself recognizes the EU’s process of superior economic integration in
its Article 25(2) and in the corresponding Declaration incorporated by the European
Communities and their Member States in the ECT.'*

Furthermore, compliance by States with the EU legal system is guaranteed by the EU
jurisdictional system, which has a monopoly on the final interpretation of EU law and
which offers an appropriate forum for investors’ claims whose rights are breached.!” This
investment promotion and protection system makes no distinction within the EU between
EU investors from Member States, but only between EU investors and investors from other
States.'®° The Claimants’ statement that EU law does not grant investors a complete system
of investment promotion and protection is foolhardy. Spain notes that the Claimants have
not argued how the protection that investors receive through the EU judicial system could
be less favourable for them or for their investments than the protection they would receive
through arbitration.'*! It cannot be alleged that the rights granted to investors under the
ECT are in addition to those granted to them by EU law.'*?

169. Spain argues that, pursuant to the principle of primacy, the preferential application of the
EU’s protection system is reflected in the literality, context and purposes of the ECT.'*

170. The EU is a member of the ECT and the EU is the only Regional Economic Integration
Organization (“REIO”) which is a party to the ECT.'*4 The ECT thus recognized the special
nature of the EU as an international organization and that certain matters governed by the
ECT should be negotiated by the EU since its Member States do not have the competence
to do so. This is reaffirmed by Article 36(7) on voting rights, since the EU and its Member
States may not vote simultaneously, and each will vote within the scope of their own
competences.'** The Respondent explains that Article 25 of the ECT prevents the
application of the intra-EU investment protection system to non-EU parties of the ECT via
the most favoured nation clause.'** This further supports the argument that the EU system
is to be preferentially applied.

171. Moreover, pursuant to Article 26(6) of the ECT, EU law must be taken into account as
applicable international law in disputes arising under the ECT. It is Spain’s position that
Article 26(6) of the ECT prevents an intra-EU investor from initiating arbitration
proceedings against an EU Member State, since such possibility would go against EU law.
Particularly, this would be contrary to Article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the
European Union (“TFEU”), which prevents EU Member States from submitting
controversies related to the interpretation or application of the EU treaties to dispute
resolution procedures other than those foreseen therein.'’’ According to the Respondent,
“[a]dmitting the arbitration would mean that the Arbitral Tribunal would have to decide on
the rights of the European investor in the Internal Market,”!** while the CJEU has flatly
rejected such an interference in Opinion 1/91.'*°

 

172. The Respondent alleges that, at the moment of signing the ECT, EU (then European
Community) Member States could not undertake obligations between themselves
surrounding the internal market, an area over which they had turned over their sovereignty
to the European Community. The EU is a contracting party to the ECT precisely for this

reason. Therefore EU Member States such as Spain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg
could not bind themselves under Part III of the ECT, which includes Article 26 on
settlement of disputes.'*° Hence, Article 26 of the ECT does not create obligations between
EU Member States, and the only arbitration possible under the ECT, in a harmonious
interpretation with EU law —as stated by the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary— is that
between a non-EU investor and an EU Member State or between an EU investor and a non-
EU Member State.'*!

173. According to the Respondent, the object and purpose of the ECT confirms its interpretation

on the impossibility of having an arbitration between an intra-EU investor and an EU
Member State.'

174. Also, “[uJnderstanding that the intra EU controversies are included in the area of protection

of the ECT [...] would assume that the EU and its Member States, as determining actors,
promoted the creation and conclusion of the ECT to cover an area, that of intra EU
investments, that was being covered since many years, exhaustively and in a widely
superior manner, through EU Law.” Based on Articles 1 and 2 of the ECT, its preface, and
Article 2 of the European Energy Charter, Spain argues that the fundamental purpose of
the ECT was to create conditions throughout Europe that guarantee the principle of non-
discrimination and market-oriented price formation.'°? The ECT intended to promote
cooperation between Eastern Europe and the European Community following the fall of
the Berlin Wall, without giving away Commission or CJEU competences.'* The Treaties
Constituting the European Communities, —signed 43 years (in the case of the Treaty
Constituting the European Coal and Steel Community) and 37 years (in the case of the
Treaties Constituting the European Economic Community and EURATOM) before the
ECT—aimed at creating, within their respective scopes, a common market based on the
principles of non-discrimination and market-oriented price formation, and thus, surpassed
the aims of the ECT.'> The Respondent argues that, if one is to compare the object and
purpose of the ECT with the object and purpose of the EU Treaties —especially the Treaty

of Lisbon— and applied Articles 30 and 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties (“VCLT”), the EU Treaties would prevail.!°° However, it notes that this exercise
is proposed for dialectical purposes and to counter the Claimants’ allegations. In Spain’s
position, there is no incompatibility between the ECT and EU Law. '°”

175. Spain further alleges that the Commission, guardian of the EU Treaties and promoter of

the negotiation of the ECT, further supports Spain’s position. In the Commission’s view,
the ECT does not create obligations among EU Member States, but only between the EU
and its Member States, on the one hand, and each of the other Contracting Parties, on the
other.'°* Spain notes that the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary recognized the important
role of the Commission regarding this subject matter!”’. Furthermore, the position of Spain
and the Commission on the preferential application of EU law is confirmed by doctrine.”

176. According to the Respondent, the Claimants have made a dialectical effort to deviate from

EU law and claim the exclusive application of the ECT. However, the Claimants’ argument
is contradictory since “if we are to adhere exclusively to the ECT, the Claimants would not
receive the protection that they claim pursuant to [the ECT].”?°! The ECT has not achieved
its maximum objective of non-discrimination as regards the “making of Investments,” as
deduced from the first four sections of Article 10 of the ECT. After having made the
investment, while the investor is guaranteed national treatment and most favoured nation
treatment, an important exception applies. Article 10(8) of the ECT does not extend
national treatment regarding aids or subsidies granted by the State to foreign investors, as
they shall be reserved for the supplementary treaty described in Article 10(4), which has
not yet been signed.” The amount claimed by the Claimants in this arbitration is a subsidy,
whose classification as State aid is beyond dispute since the Judgement of the CJEU in

Elcogas?°

177. Spain responds to the Claimants’ arguments regarding Article 26 of the ECT specifically

200

noting that none of the articles of the ECT cited by the Respondent deprive the Tribunal of

refer to disputes regarding the alleged breach of obligations in Part III of the ECT. Neither
Spain, Luxembourg nor the Netherlands could acquire obligations under Part III of the
ECT at the moment of signing the Treaty because at the time they did not have the
competence to do so. Spain argues that this competence had been ceded to the European
Communities and that not a single BIT was signed by EU Member States after entering the
EU."°> If EU Member States could not acquire any obligations amongst themselves under
Part III of the ECT, consequently, the dispute resolution mechanisms therein do not apply
to intra-community disputes.” Furthermore, Article 26 of the ECT does not provide that
arbitration is the only available dispute resolution mechanism, nor does it establish an order
of preference between them — for instance, stating that arbitration is more favourable to an

investor.?””

178. Also, regarding the “[p]reliminary observations on the relevance of previous awards and

other legal precedents” as argued by the Claimants, Spain claims that the awards cited by
the Claimants do not resolve the issues before the Tribunal in the present case. Not all
awards are “subject to being extrapolated to the ECT,” since “the ECT is a multilateral and
mixed treaty, promoted by the former European Communities (now the EU) and signed by
the EU as one more Contracting Party.””°* Also, regarding the Decision on Jurisdiction,
Applicable Law and Liability in Electrabel v. Hungary, the Respondent states that Hungary
signed the ECT before having joined the EU. Therefore, Hungary, unlike Spain,
Luxembourg and the Netherlands, was able to contract obligations under Part III of the
ECT. Also, regarding the awards in PV Investors v. Spain and Charanne v. Spain, Spain
claims that they both fail to consider the principle of primacy of EU law, which is the
essential element of this jurisdictional objection.” Finally, regarding the Claimants’
argument that there were matters resolved by awards in which the respondent State did not
invoke the intra-community objection, Spain counters that in none of those cases the
respondent State involved was already a member of the EU when signing the

corresponding investment treaty.?!°

a Japanese or Russian investor within the EU would be protected by the ECT ina case such
as this, they would not be entitled to national treatment, to which the Claimants are entitled

under EU law.23

180. Finally, Spain clarifies that it does not claim that an explicit or implicit disconnection

clause exists.?!*

181. In conclusion, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants fail to comply with the

requirement set out in ECT Article 26(1), since the dispute does not arise between a
Contracting Party and investors from different Contracting Parties.

2. Claimants’ Position

182. The Claimants argue that each of the requirements in Article 26 of the ECT has been

satisfied in the present case, since Spain is a “Contracting Party” to the ECT, and each of
the Claimants is an “Investor of another Contracting Party.” Spain signed the ECT on 17
December 1994 and it entered into force with respect to Spain on 16 April 1998.7!> Also,
pursuant to Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT an “Investor” of a Contracting Party is “a
company or other organization organized in accordance with the law applicable in that
Contracting Party.” The Claimants are companies incorporated under the laws of
Luxembourg and the Netherlands, each of which is a “Contracting Party” to the ECT.?!¢

183. The Claimants first respond to the Respondent’s objection noting that every arbitral

tribunal and national court that has considered the intra-EU objection, including where
there have been submissions under the ECT, has rejected it.?!? Notably, three tribunals
constituted under Article 26 of the ECT have rejected said objection in cases against Spain,
concluding that intra-EU disputes are not excluded from their jurisdiction: PV Investors v.
Spain, Charanne v. Spain, and RREEF vy. Spain (Decision on Jurisdiction).”!* The tribunal
in PV Investors v. Spain, for instance, concluded that intra-EU disputes are not excluded
from the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal constituted under Article 26 of the ECT.2!? Two
of the most recent decisions on the intra-EU issue involved the ECT and were brought
against Spain, and both Electrabel v. Hungary and EDF v. Hungary, cases cited by Spain,

were brought pursuant to the ECT. There have been numerous ECT cases involving

disputes between Member States and EU investors where no intra-EU objection was even

raised by the respondent State, and not a single arbitral tribunal has found that it lacked
jurisdiction due to the intra-EU nature of the dispute.?”!

184. Contrary to Spain’s allegation, the Claimants maintain that the energy sector is not an area
where EU Member States have given over their sovereignty to the EU. Regulation of the
energy sector is a shared competence under EU law.” Also, the Claimants note that the
Disputed Measures are clearly national measures taken by Spain, and not at the insistence
of or mandate of the EU.

185. Even if it is assumed that the two treaty regimes (the EU and the ECT) have the same
subject matter, the ECT would take precedence over any conflicting provision of the EU
founding treaties, based on Article 16 of the ECT and Articles 30 and 59 of the VCLT.?3
Spain’s argument entails that Article 26 of the ECT applies to an intra-EU dispute so long
as either the home State of the claimant-investor or the respondent-host State was not a
Member State at the time the ECT was signed and/or ratified, but that it does not apply to
intra-EU disputes if both of the relevant States were Member States at the time the ECT
was signed. The Claimants maintain that this position is absurd and that it would amount
to impermissible discrimination.?*

186. Additionally, the ordinary meaning of the ECT demonstrates Spain’s unconditional
consent to arbitrate disputes with investors from Luxembourg and the Netherlands. First,
Article 26(1) of the ECT conveys a clear meaning, and it cannot be construed in such a
way as to deprive EU investors of the right to bring a claim against EU Member States
under the ECT.?** “In this arbitration, the First Claimant [Antin Luxembourg] is a company
incorporated in Luxembourg and the Second Claimant [Antin Termosolar] is a company
organised in accordance with the law applicable in the Netherlands. The First and Second
Claimants have made investments in Spain. Both Luxembourg and the Netherlands are
Contracting Parties to the ECT, as is Spain. The present dispute is therefore a dispute
between a Contracting Party (Spain), and two investors, each from another Contracting
Party (Luxembourg (the First Claimant) and the Netherlands (the Second Claimant)).”?”°

187. The Claimants allege that it is difficult to see how the fact that Article 26 of the ECT

provides for different dispute resolution mechanisms would assist Spain’s case.?”’ Article
26 of the ECT leaves the choice between different dispute resolution mechanisms to the
investor, but it also provides that each Contracting Party unconditionally consents to
arbitration. 7%

188. Furthermore, the object and purpose of the ECT does not confirm Spain’s interpretation of

Article 26 of the ECT. Spain argues that permitting intra-EU arbitration would assume that
the EU and its Member States promoted the creation of the ECT to cover an area (intra-EU
investments) that had been covered for many years exhaustively and in a widely superior
manner through EU law.

189. The Claimants first indicate that “the fundamental objective of the ECT is to facilitate

232

233

234

transactions and investments in the energy sector by reducing political and regulatory
risks.”??? However, Spain unjustifiably adopts a narrower interpretation, claiming that the
object of the ECT as being the promotion of East-West energy cooperation and the
economic recovery of Eastern Europe, which would lead to sustaining the impossibility of
intra-EU arbitrations.° The fact that the ECT initially promoted an East-West trade
gateway does not alter the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT, and that as stated in
the introduction of the treaty, the ECT is a “legally-binding multilateral instrument, the
only one of its kind dealing specifically with inter-governmental cooperation in the energy
sector.”3! Spain also attaches significant interpretative weight to the European
Commission’s view of Article 26 of the ECT. The Claimants nonetheless allege that what
matters is the intentions of the parties as expressed in the text, and the intention of one
party to a treaty, on its own, is irrelevant to determining its proper interpretation.?*?
Moreover, various tribunals have found that most EU Member States do not support the
European Commission’s position. Spain’s intra-EU objection is premised on the false
assumption that the tribunal must resort to supplementary means of interpretation of the
ECT. Since the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the ECT is clear and unambiguous, there
is nothing that would justify resorting to such supplementary means.*4

190. The Claimants also argue that even if it were permissible to interpret Article 26 of the ECT

by looking into the intentions of the European Commission and certain Member States
regarding EU law, there is nothing within the provisions of EU law that could be
understood to override the rights granted in Article 26 of the ECT. The provisions of the
ECT do not contradict EU law nor are the investor protections contained in the EU’s
Internal Market superior to those under the ECT.7** The Claimants maintain that the EU
system does not provide for a widely superior system to that of the ECT, as claimed by the
Respondent. EU treaties cover a different subject matter, since investment protection under
EU law is primarily focused on ensuring access to the market of other Member States,
rather than providing a comprehensive system of promotion and protection of investments,
as the ECT does.”*° The EU system does not provide recourse to investor-State resolution,
nor does it allow an investor to bring claims for illegal governmental action against a
foreign investment in an international arbitration (a neutral and independent forum).

191. Since the ECT grants EU investors rights that are different from and additional to those

provided by EU law (and particularly the right of action through arbitration), rather than
contradicting them, there is no inconsistency between the two systems. This has been
recognized by certain tribunals, including the tribunals in Electrabel v. Hungary and
Eastern Sugar v. Czech Republic.>*" Even if there were a contradiction, Article 26 of the
ECT should be held to prevail due to the application of the principle of /ex posterior”** and
of Article 16 of the ECT.”® To this regard, the fact that Article 26 of the ECT provides for
other possible dispute resolution mechanisms is irrelevant, since it does not deprive an

investor of its right to international arbitration.“

192. According to the Claimants, EU law does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction under the

235

236

240

ECT. The protection of foreign investments is not part of the CJEU’s competences and the
pursuit of protection of investor rights as is sought in this arbitration is not an option under

EU law. The CJEU itself has acknowledged that an international dispute settlement
mechanism established by an international treaty to which the EU is a party is compatible
with EU law, and decisions arising therefrom are binding on the CJEU.™"' It is only
decisions on the distribution of competencies between the EU and its Member States, or
on the legality of acts of European institutions, that are considered by the CJEU as falling

within its exclusive jurisdiction.?

193. Furthermore, Article 26(6) of the ECT, which provides that ECT disputes be decided in

accordance with the ECT and “applicable rules and principles of international law”, does
not prevent an EU investor from bringing a claim against another EU Member State under
the ECT. The Respondent relied on the tribunal on Electrabel v. Hungary, which stated
that notwithstanding harmonization efforts, if the ECT and EU law remained incompatible,
“EU law would prevail over the ECT’s substantive protections and that the ECT could not
apply inconsistently with EU law to such a national’s claim against an EU Member State.”
However, the Claimants note that the findings of the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary on
this regard were in respect of the law applicable to the merits, and not a matter of
jurisdiction. The tribunal found that it had jurisdiction and dismissed the intra-EU
objection.”* The Claimants’ position is that the fact that EU law is part of international
law bears no relevance to the question of jurisdiction.“ In any event, Article 16 of the
ECT makes clear that to the extent that the ECT and EU law are in conflict, the ECT
prevails.

194. Spain maintains that Article 26 introduces a model of consent to restricted arbitration,

limited by certain provisions of the ECT, namely Articles 1(2), 1(3), 16, 25 and 36(7). The
Claimants respond arguing that the fact that the EU is a party recognized as a REIO under
the ECT does not deprive investors of their rights under Article 26 nor does it imply that
the EU system be preferentially applied. According to the Claimants, Articles 1(2), 1(3)
and 1(10) of the ECT simply recognise the existence of REIOs amongst the ECT’s
Contracting Parties and identify the Area of the REIO that is a Contracting Party as
meaning the Areas of the member states of such REIO.”*° It only ensures that claims can
be brought against such REIO regarding disputes arising out of an investment made in the
corresponding area.”“° In accordance with Articles 26(6) and 1(10) of the ECT, the relevant
Area is that of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, in this case, Spain. For
instance, the tribunal in PV Investors v. Spain found that the relevant area, as is the case in

the present dispute, is not the EU but the territory of Spain.?*” If the EU itself were the
respondent, the relevant Area would be the entire EU Area. Also, the Claimants maintain
that the simple reference to the existence of a regional organization that is also a party to
the same multilateral treaty, as in the ECT, does not establish that the multilateral treaty
does not apply within the regional organisation absent a disconnection clause.”

195. In addition, Articles 16, 25 and 36(7) of the ECT in no way support Spain’s argument that

the EU system must be preferentially applied to the ECT, therefore depriving investors of
the possibility of bringing claims under Article 26 of the ECT.”

 

196. The ordinary meaning of Article 16 of the ECT provides that in the event of a conflict

between the ECT and either a prior or subsequent international agreement, the provision
more favourable to the investor shall apply. Article 26 of the ECT reflects a more
favourable treatment since the ECT confers to investors a right of action, through
arbitration, against the offending State.*°° The Claimants explain that they have brought
their claims under the ECT because it depoliticises the dispute by removing it from the
purview of Spain’s national courts.

197. Regarding Article 25 of the ECT, the Claimants note that it indeed provides that the

obligation to accord most-favoured nation treatment does not require a Contracting Party
from an Economic Integration Area (EIA) to accord investors from outside the EIA the
preferential treatment that may be applicable inside the EIA. Most-favoured-nation
treatment does not oblige Member States to extend the rights of the Internal Market to
investors from outside the EU.”*! Regarding the EU, Article 25 of the ECT protects against
any claim that EU law advantages should be extended to non-EU investors. However,
Article 25 of the ECT does not state that EU Investors cannot bring claims against Member
States under Article 26 of the ECT, nor recognize the primacy of EU law.?*?

198. Article 36(7) of the ECT is a procedural provision that purely relates to the voting

procedure of ECT Contracting Parties in reference to the Energy Charter Conference, and
in no way does the recognition of voting rights of a REIO support Spain’s view that the
EU system applies preferentially over the protection afforded by Article 26 of the ECT.

Article 36(7) does not concern the dispute-resolution procedure in Part V of the ECT. It
merely provides, as Spain has accepted, that the EU and its Member States may not vote

simultaneously.?™4

199. There is no indication in the text of the ECT that the Contracting Parties have limited their

consent to arbitration on the basis that some of the Contracting Parties belong to the same
REIO, such as the EU.?** On the contrary, Annexes ID and IA of the ECT, which provide
certain specific exceptions to the consent of contracting parties to arbitration under Article
26, include no provisions regarding such issue.”* Hence, “a good faith interpretation of the
ordinary meaning of Article 26 leads to the conclusion that there is no intra-EU exception

to the Contracting Parties’ ‘unconditional consent’ to arbitration.”?57

200. The Claimants further argue that Article 344 of the TFEU is irrelevant to the present case

since it does not prevent EU Member States from submitting disputes that are not related
to EU law to other fora, nor does it prohibit the submission of disputes between other actors
to a different method of settlement not contemplated in the EU treaties.?** The Claimants
maintain that Spain’s argument confuses the concepts of substantive protections offered
under EU law, applicable to the merits of a dispute under EU law, and the question of
jurisdiction of the Tribunal.?*? Moreover, since there is no provision in any of the EU
Treaties dealing with investor-State arbitration, Article 344 of the TFEU does not affect
the operation of Article 26 of the ECT nor does it modify the States’ consent under said
article.

201. The Claimants note that this has been confirmed by investment tribunals, such as Eureko

v. The Slovak Republic, EURAM v. The Slovak Republic, Electrabel v. Hungary and
Charanne y. Spain2® Furthermore, the Claimants maintain that Spain’s argument that
intra-EU investor-State arbitration is contrary to EU law is not contradicted by Opinion
1/91 of the CJEU. The Claimants admit that the CJEU concluded that the creation of a
European Economic Area court would violate the monopoly of the CJEU as it concerned
judgments on the interpretation of EU treaties and the validity of decisions of EU organs

Parties to this Treaty; provided that such an Organization shall not exercise its right to vote if its member states
exercise theirs, and vice versa.”).

and institutions. However, Opinion 1/91 did not deal with the interpretation of the rights
of investors under the ECT. The Claimants also argue that their position is supported by
the fact that arbitration is permissible even between EU Member States, as is shown by the
Jron Rhine arbitration where the tribunal noted that although it had to consider EU law,
this did not deprive it from its jurisdiction.7°!

202. Article 344 of the TFEU, agreed in the 2009 Lisbon Treaty, cannot be considered a relevant

instrument for interpreting Article 26 of the ECT according to Article 31(3)(a) of
the VCLT, since it is not an agreement regarding the interpretation of the ECT, or the
application of its provisions.” Article 344 cannot serve as subsequent practice under
Article 31(3)(b) of the VCLT as “it is not the practice followed ‘in the application’ of the
ECT, nor does it establish the consent of all the Contracting Parties to the ECT regarding
its interpretation.”?*

203. Finally, the Claimants argue that the ECT contains no implicit or explicit disconnection

clause concerning intra-EU disputes. This can be affirmed since (i) prior to the conclusion
of the ECT, the EU had used disconnection clauses where they were intended to apply, (ii)
the ECT contains disconnection clauses where they are intended to apply, as is the case
regarding the Svalbard Treaty,” and (iii) given the ordinary meaning of Article 26 of the
ECT, if such a clause had been intended, its inclusion would have been eminently
necessary.” As Spain clarified its position in its Rejoinder, in that it does not hold to the
existence of an express or implied disconnection clause, this is a point on which the Parties
are in agreement.?°

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

204. Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction is based on Article 26 of the ECT, and specifically

on the text related to disputes between “a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party.”

Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area

the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of

either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting
Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with

the provisions of this Article. [...]”

206. The aforesaid article must be interpreted in accordance with the rules of the VCLT and
particularly Articles 31 and 32 thereof which provide:

“Article 31. General Rule of Interpretation
1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context

and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall
comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all
the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in
connection with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other
parties as an instrument related to the treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the
interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions;

(b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which
establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations

Article 32. Supplementary Means of Interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation,
including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of
its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the
application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the
interpretation according to article 31:

(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
(b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”

207. The rule of Article 31 VCLT is an integral single rule, i-e., the Tribunal should not analyse
the text, context, object and purpose as separate elements of interpretation, but rather start
with the ordinary meaning of the words of Article 26 in their context and considering the
object and purpose of the Treaty. In addition, Article 32 is a subsidiary rule, applying to
confirm an interpretation reached under Article 31 or where the interpretation according to
Article 31 (a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is
manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

208. ECT Article 1(2) defines “Contracting Party” as “a state or Regional Economic Integration
Organization which has consented to be bound by this Treaty and for which the Treaty is
in force.””*’ In turn, Article 1(7)(a)(ii) of the ECT defines “Investor” with respect to a
Contracting Party as “a company or other organization organized in accordance with the
law applicable in that Contracting Party.”?**

209. Spain signed the ECT on 17 December 1994, ratified it on 11 December 1997,7° and the
ECT entered into force with respect to Spain on 16 April 1998. The ECT entered into force
with respect to each of Luxembourg and the Netherlands on 16 April 1998, after
Luxembourg signed the ECT on 17 December 1994 and ratified it on 7 February 1997, and
the Netherlands signed the ECT on 17 December 1994 and ratified it on 11 December
1997.

Spain is therefore a Contracting Party and both Luxembourg and the Netherlands, the
States of nationality of the Claimants, satisfy the definition of Article 1(2) and are therefore
Contracting Parties under the ECT. The Claimants are companies or organizations
organized in accordance with the laws of the Netherlands and of Luxembourg and thus are
investors of a Contracting Party under Article 1(7)(a)(ii).

The ECT’s Article 10 imposes substantial obligations on each Contracting Party with
respect to “Investors of other Contracting Parties” and their Investments and Article 13
adds that “Investments of Investors of a Contracting Party in the Area of any other
Contracting Party” shall not be nationalized or expropriated, unless certain requirements
are met.” ECT Article 26 provides for the consent of the parties to arbitration of
“[d]isputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another Contracting Party
[...J227!

The ordinary meaning of the above texts, in their context, provide the Tribunal with
jurisdiction to entertain claims against Spain (a Contracting Party) by investors of
Luxembourg and the Netherlands (both a Contracting Party) related to “Investments” made
by the Claimants in the Spanish RE sector.

However, the Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal arguing that an
interpretation of the aforesaid Article 26 in the context of the ECT results in a limitation
that would bar any claim by “Investors” of EU Member States against another EU Member
State that is party to the ECT. In other words, the Respondent considers that the context of
the ECT results in the exclusion of intra-EU investor-State disputes based on the ECT.

The Tribunal notes that this objection has already been presented by the Respondent and
rejected by arbitral tribunals in three cases that the Parties included as legal authorities in

273

this arbitration: Charanne v. Spain;?” Isolux v. Spain;?” and Eiser v. Spain?"

The ECT does not include a limitation that provides for a wide exclusion such as the one
alleged by the Respondent. Such an exclusion would have to be express and clear and the
Tribunal is not persuaded that it results from an interpretation such as the one submitted
by the Respondent. The Tribunal agrees with the Ziser v. Spain award in that:

Framework for International Energy Cooperation”, September 2004, Article 2, 10, and 13.

“Tt is a fundamental rule of international law that treaties are to be
interpreted in good faith. As a corollary, treaty makers should be
understood to carry out their function in good faith, and not to lay
traps for the unwary with hidden meanings and sweeping implied
exclusions. In this regard, the RREEF tribunal, in a case much like
the present, concluded that international law would require some
form of express warning to make such a broad exclusion evident:

“84. [...] [W]hen the very essence of a treaty to which the EU is a
party is at issue, such as it would be for the ECT if the interpretation
proposed by the Respondent were correct, then precisely because the
EU is a party to the treaty a formal warning that EU law would
prevail over the treaty, such as that contained in a disconnection
clause, would have been required under international law.

85. This follows from the basic public international law principle of
pacta sunt servanda. If one or more parties to a treaty wish to exclude
the application of that treaty in certain respects or circumstances,
they must either make a reservation (excluded in the present case by
Article 46 of the ECT) or include an unequivocal disconnection
clause in the treaty itself. [...]’.”°”°

216. The ECT’s purpose does not support the Respondent’s interpretation. Article 2, captioned
“Purpose of the Treaty,” declares that “[t]his Treaty establishes a legal framework in order
to promote long-term co-operation in the energy field, based on complementarities and
mutual benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter.”?”°
Nothing in this wording suggests the exclusion of claims by investors who are nationals of
an EU Member State who is also a party to the ECT against another EU Member State.
Moreover, such context does not call into question the ordinary meaning of Article 26.

217. As regards to the specific provisions of the ECT invoked by Spain to support its objection,
the Tribunal is not persuaded that such provisions lead to the result of excluding a
significant group of investors from the jurisdictional provisions of the ECT:

(a) _ Itis true that the definition ofa REIO in Article 1(3)°”’ implies that a REIO’s member
can transfer competence over some matters to the organization. However, there is
nothing in such provision that may be construed as the transfer of all competence by

59

EEC member countries over energy investments to the EEC when the ECT was
signed in 1994, and there is nothing that suggests that this position was
communicated to or accepted by other ECT Contracting Parties.

(b) It is also true that Article 36(7)°”* could be said to recognize the possibility of divided
competence by giving a REIO votes equivalent to the number of its member States
when voting on matters over which it has competence. But this does not provide for
the particular allocation of competence that, according to the Respondent, existed at
the time of the ECT’s conclusion, nor does it incorporate into the Treaty an exception
such as the one claimed by Spain or otherwise contradict the clear language of the
ECT.

(c) Article 25 indeed contains provisions that eliminate or prohibit discriminatory
treatment among members of an “Economic Integration Agreement” from the ECT’s
most-favoured nation obligations. But such provisions do not support the
Respondent’s interpretation. The possibility that the parties have to agree on a regime
limiting discrimination among themselves does not prevent such parties from
agreeing to other obligations under a different treaty regime.

218. Moreover, the Tribunal considers that the fact that the EU is also a Contracting Party and
a “Regional Economic International Organization” as defined in Articles 1(2) and 1(3) of
the ECT does not bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Neither does the use of the terms “relating
to an Investment of the latter in the Area of the former” in Article 26 of the ECT, nor the
definition of “Area” in Article 1(10) of the Treaty. The ordinary meaning of Articles 1(2),
1(3) and 1(10) recognize the existence of REIOs as possible Contracting Parties and
identify that the “Area” of a REIO, such as the EU, to mean the “Areas of the member
states of such [REIO].”?”? Under the terms of the ECT, a claim could thus be brought
against a REIO, regarding a dispute arising out of an “Investment” made by an “Investor”
in that REIO’s defined “Area.”

219. The simultaneous existence of Spain, the Netherlands and Luxembourg as Contracting
Parties to the ECT, together with the EU, where each would have obligations under the
Treaty, results from their separate ratifications of the Treaty. The act by which the EU

if its member states exercise theirs, and vice versa.”)

2° Exhibit C-0001, Energy Charter Secretariat, “The Energy Charter Treaty and Related Documents: A Legal
Framework for International Energy Cooperation”, September 2004, Article 1(10). Furthermore, Article 36(7) of
the ECT on the voting procedure of ECT Contracting Parties does not imply that EU law or the EU system applies
in preference to the protection afforded by Article 26 of the ECT.

“gives its unconditional consent” to arbitration does not supersede or eliminate the specific
consent granted by each sovereign EU Member State that is also a Contracting Party to the
ECT.

The same applies to the understanding of the “Area” in which an “Investment” is made and
relating to which a dispute arises. The Tribunal agrees with the following analysis
articulated by the tribunal in PV Investors v. Spain:

“The phrase ‘in the Area of the former [Contracting Party] in Article
26(1) of the ECT refers to the particular dispute initiated by the
investor. If the investor commences arbitration against a member
state of the EU (rather than against the EU itself), then ‘Area’ means
‘with respect to a state that is a Contracting Party’ the territory of that
particular member state, in accordance with the first sentence of
Article 1(10). In other words, the relevant area is that of the
Contracting Party that is party to the dispute. In this case, the relevant
Area is the territory of Spain (not of the EU), and thus the diversity
of area requirement is complied with where the investors are of a
Contracting Party other than Spain and the investment has been
carried out in the territory of Spain. The situation may be different
where the EU itself is a Respondent. In that case, ‘with respect to a
[REIO]’ (Article 1(10), second sentence), the relevant Area would be
the entire EU Area and the diversity of area requirement would have
to be satisfied with respect to that territory. This is, however, not the
scenario before the Tribunal.””*”

Therefore, the recognition that a REIO may have standing as a respondent under the terms
of the ECT does not alter the entitlement of an “Investor” from Luxembourg (such as Antin
Luxembourg) and/or an “Investor” from the Netherlands (such as Antin Termosolar), to
bring claims against Spain regarding “Investments” made in the “Area” of Spain.

In connection with the Respondent’s claim that the Claimants cannot invoke arbitration
under the ECT Article 26 because both the Claimants and the Respondent are located
within the geographical territory of the EU, which is itself party to the ECT and thus
Claimants are not from the territory of another Contracting Party,”*! the Tribunal disagrees
and recalls, as did the Charanne and Eiser tribunals, that:

“{...] while the EU is a Contracting Party to the ECT, so too are its
Member States. ‘[A]lthough the EU is a party to the ECT, EU
Member States also remain contracting parties to the ECT. Both the
EU and [its] Member States can have legal standing as respondents
in a claim under the ECT.’ Investors organized in accordance with

the law of any Contracting Party satisfy Article 1(7)(a)(ii)’s literal
requirement to be an ‘Investor’ of a ‘Contracting Party.’ And, a
dispute involving such an Investor and another Contracting Party
regarding an Investment in that Contracting Party’s ‘Area’ satisfies
the literal requirements for compulsory dispute settlement under ECT
Article 26(1) and (2).

Respondent’s analysis, however, imposes an unstated limitation
upon any Investor hailing from an EU Member State. For
Respondent, such an Investor loses its national character and
becomes predominantly an Investor of the EU, because its home
country is also an EU Member State and subject to EU law.
Accordingly, the Investor and the putative respondent State are found
in the same “Area” — the area of the EU — so that the diversity
required by Article 26(1) and (2) does not exist.

A difficulty with this analysis is that it is not evident how there can
be an ‘Investor of the EU’ satisfying Article 1(7)(a)(ii) definition.
There is no trans-national body of European law regulating the
organization of business units, a matter that remains subject to
member countries’ domestic law. Thus, within the framework of the
definition, there can be no ‘EU Investors.’ Investors exist only as
‘Investors’ of a ‘Contracting Party.’?*?

223. ECT Article 26(6), which defines the law to be applied in disputes between “Investors”

283

284

285

and ECT Contracting Parties, provides that tribunals “shall decide the issues in dispute in
accordance with this Treaty and applicable rules and principles of international law.”?*?
According to the Respondent, EU law, including the treaties creating the EEC and the EU
and allocating competences among European institutions and their member countries, EU’s
internal legislation, and decisions of the CJEU, constitute applicable rules and principles
of international law for purposes of Article 26(6).?** Further, pursuant to Article 344 of the
TFEU and mandatory principles of European law defined by the CJEU, only European
courts, in particular, the CJEU, are competent to pass upon the meaning and content of
European law. Therefore, according to the Respondent, the relevant principles of
international law referred to in Article 26(6) do not allow this Tribunal to address the
Claimants’ claims, because EU law does not permit the existence of a mechanism for
dispute resolution between EU investors and EU Member States other than that provided
for under EU treaties.?**

224. The Tribunal disagrees. First, the jurisdiction of this Tribunal derives from the express

terms of a treaty —the ECT— that is binding under international law on the State parties
thereof and on the EU. Second, the ECT is a multilateral treaty to which the EU itself is a
party.?*° Third, the EU and each EU Member State granted its consent to submit to
arbitration any claim against it. Fourth, nothing in the text, context, purpose and object of
the ECT suggests that the inclusion of the reference to “rules and principles of international
law” in the applicable law clause was intended to mean that the treaties creating the EEC
and the EU and allocating competences among European institutions and their Member
States, the EU’s internal legislation, as subsequently interpreted by the CJEU, could be
interpreted in a manner such that a development in the EU’s acquis could be employed to
undermine the prior consents to submit to arbitration under the ECT given by each of the
EU Member States and the EU itself. The alleged problem of incompatibility between EU
law and the ECT, if there is one, is to be sorted out by the EU and the EU States
counterparties to the ECT.

225. Under Article 32 of the VCLT treaties are to be interpreted in good faith, and as mentioned

by the Ziser tribunal “treaty makers should be understood to carry out their function in
good faith, and not to lay traps for the unwary with hidden meanings and sweeping implied
exclusions.””*” If the arbitration clause, which is at the very heart of the Treaty to which
the EU consented, were to exclude the variety of treaties and legislation mentioned by
Spain, then the EU, which the Tribunal must assume acted in good faith when it negotiated
and signed the ECT, would have, under international law, provided a formal warning, or
an express exclusion or a reserve.

226. In sum, the Tribunal does not find anything within the provisions of EU law, as invoked

and pleaded by Spain, that overrides the rights granted in Article 26 of the ECT regarding
the settlement of disputes.

227. Central to Spain’s argument is also Article 344 of the TFEU:

“Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for therein.”

228. Relying on Opinion 1/91, Spain further argues that Article 344 of the TFEU would be

infringed if intra-EU disputes were to be allowed. The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants
in that the different concepts of substantive protections under EU law, which would apply

°8° The EU signed the Treaty on 17 December 1994, ratified it on 16 December 1997 and the ECT entered into force
with respect to the EU on 16 April 1998.

to the merits of a dispute brought under EU law, should not be confused with the
jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

Finally, the Tribunal finds it relevant that Opinion 1/91 does not deal with the analysis of
“Investors’” rights under the ECT, and that the present case, unlike Opinion 1/91, does not
concern the validity of decisions of EU organs and institutions.

In conclusion, Spain made a standing offer to “Investors” of other “Contracting Parties” to
settle disputes through international arbitration. The Claimants in this case, as “Investor[s]
of another Contracting Party” accepted such an offer, and submitted their consent to
arbitration, by filing their Request for Arbitration. The Tribunal thus rejects Spain’s

jurisdictional objection.

B. WHETHER THE TRIBUNAL HAS JURISDICTION OVER THE CLAIMS SUBMITTED BY
THE CLAIMANTS REGARDING THE “INTERESTS” IDENTIFIED AS PROTECTED

INVESTMENTS UNDER THE TREATY

1. Respondent's Position

The Respondent claims that certain of the assets invoked by the Claimants as
“Investments” should be excluded from this arbitration since they are not investments to
the effect of Article 1(6) of the ECT.

Spain argues that the Claimants neither own nor control, directly or indirectly, certain
assets identified as investments in their Memorial. Article 1(6) of the ECT requires that the
asset which constitutes the investment be either owned or controlled, directly or indirectly,
by an investor. According to the Respondent, when the ECT alludes to the term indirect
ownership, it refers to the real and ultimate possession of the asset.***

In the case at hand, the Claimants argue that their investment consists of direct and indirect
shareholding and debt interests in the Andasol Companies that own and operate the
Andasol Plants, as well as interests in the said plants and claims to money, returns and
rights conferred by RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010.° However, according to the
Respondent, the only assets that qualify as investments under Article 1(6) of the ECT are
Antin Termosolar’s shareholdings in the Andasol Companies and the loans granted by
Antin Termosolar to the Andasol Companies.””°

234. First, none of the other assets invoked are controlled by the Claimants, which are simple

vehicle entities. Said control corresponds to Antin Fund | or Antin IP, none of which has
brought a claim against the Respondent.””!

235. Second, Antin Luxembourg does not directly own the shares in the social capital of the

Andasol Companies and the loans granted to the Andasol Companies, since possession of
these assets is channelled indirectly through Antin Termosolar, while the rest of the assets
are channelled through Antin Termosolar and the Andasol Companies.”

236. Third, Antin Termosolar directly owns the shares in the Andasol Companies as well as the

loans granted to these companies, but it does not have direct ownership over the interests
in the plants and claims to money, returns and rights conferred by law, since said assets are
owned by the Andasol Companies themselves.7>

237. Spain explains that the Claimants argue for the existence of an indirect ownership over

many of the assets identified by them as their investment.?** However, the existence of
indirect ownership under the ECT can only be alleged by the real and ultimate owner, i.e.,
the final beneficiary. This interpretation is consistent with previous decisions of tribunals
regarding the denial of benefits clause contained in Article 17 of the ECT, since such
decisions have accepted that “ownership” refers to the final beneficiary of the ownership
chain.?*> Likewise, different tribunals have found that indirect ownership of assets under
Article 1(6) of the ECT should be interpreted as referring to the final beneficiary.?”
Considering the preparatory work of the ECT, signatory States to the ECT accepted the
idea that indirect ownership referred to “actual ownership of assets, held through a chain
of entities”, which is clearly a reference to the final link in each chain of ownership.”

238. The Respondent maintains that the indirect ownership of the assets identified by the

291

293

295

296

207

298

Claimants as their investment belongs not to them but to the Limited Partners, the final
beneficiaries.”* Since Antin Luxembourg does not own either directly or indirectly any
such assets, it does not have an “investment” under Article 1(6) of the ECT. The same
conclusion applies to Antin Termosolar regarding the assets whose direct ownership

corresponds to the Andasol Companies. Previous tribunals have held that shareholders of
a company can claim for alleged damages caused to the value of their shares in a company,
but not for damages caused to the assets of a company in which it has a shareholding.””
Therefore, this Tribunal only has jurisdiction to decide on the claims regarding the
shareholding that Antin Termosolar owns in the Andasol Companies, and receivables from
loans granted to the Andasol Companies by Antin Termosolar.*°°

2. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants submit they hold numerous direct and indirect interests that qualify as
“Investments” under the ECT.

The Respondent argues that, regarding ownership, it is the Limited Partners making up the
Fund that are the ultimate beneficial owners; and regarding control, it is Antin Fund | or
Antin IP that control the Interests: consequently, the Claimants cannot bring forth such
claims"!

According to the Claimants, Spain’s interpretation of indirect ownership under Article 1(6)
ECT, pursuant to which intermediate companies such as the Claimants can never bring a
claim under the ECT, goes beyond the ordinary meaning of the ECT and finds no support
in the treaty’s language.

First, the Claimants argue that they satisfy Article 1(6) by directly and indirectly owning
the Interests.

Regarding both Antin Luxembourg and Antin Termosolar, it is clear that a shareholder’s
interest in a company comprises an interest in the assets of that company, including its
rights under law, claims to money or economic performance. This is particularly true under
Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT, which covers “every kind of asset”, including those “owned or
controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor’, and including not only shares but also a
company or business enterprise, returns and any right conferred by law. Therefore,
according to the ordinary meaning of the ECT, Claimants’ qualifying Investments under
the ECT include both the indirect shareholding in the Andasol Companies and the share in
the entire underlying business units, including the returns that the Andasol Companies were
entitled to receive under the RD 661/2007 economic regime.*

244. Previous tribunals have confirmed this interpretation, in making no distinction between
direct ownership rights of the shareholders and shareholders’ indirect rights in the assets
of the local company suffering the host-State measures, and also recognizing that a
shareholder can have indirect investments in the underlying assets of a company.*” Neither
of the cases cited by Spain*™ contradict this position. To the contrary, the tribunal in ST-
AD vy. Bulgaria expressly admitted that a foreign shareholder has standing to bring a treaty
claim regarding measures which, although directed at the local company in which the
shareholder holds shares, violate the relevant treaty and cause damage to the shareholder.*°>
The tribunal in PoStova v. Hellenic Republic indicated that the claimant had no right to the
assets of its subsidiary that qualified for protection under the BIT because it had based its
claim solely on the government bond interests held by said subsidiary, rather than in its
shareholding in it, situation that is clearly different from the case at hand.3°°

245. The Claimants argue that Antin Luxembourg indirectly owns the Interests. Spain’s
suggestion that the indirect possessory link between Antin Luxembourg and the Interests
somehow distorts the ownership chain and deprives it from the ability to claim in respect
of the Interests makes no sense, since there is nothing in the wording of the ECT to suggest
that ownership hinges on any “possessory” requirement, as Spain claims. In addition,
Spain’s suggestion that the existence of intermediary companies in the corporate chain
deprives Antin Luxembourg of protection —unless it is the beneficial owner— is without
merit and unsupported by the wording of the ECT’ Antin Luxembourg, the first
Claimant, owns a 100% stake in Antin Termosolar, second Claimant, which in turn owns
a 45% stake in the Andasol Companies (together with RREEF and ACS). The Andasol
Companies own the Interests. It is therefore unclear to the Claimants in what way they
have failed to establish the necessary “link” of ownership, as suggested by the Respondent.

246. The Claimants further argue that Antin Termosolar indirectly owns the Interests.
According to Spain, Antin Termosolar can claim only regarding its shareholding in the
Andasol Companies and the loans granted to them. However, the definition of investment
under the ECT includes every kind of asset directly or indirectly owned or controlled,
including returns and any rights conferred by law. Antin Termosolar does indirectly own

a stake in the Interests, and the presence of the Andasol Companies between it and the
Interests does not affect the establishment of ownership for the purposes of the ECT.*°*

247. There is nothing in the text of the ECT to support Spain’s interpretation that the only

relevant indirect owner who can qualify as an Investor under the ECT is the final
beneficiary or the “last or actual holder”. In Spain’s argument, an investor must be a direct
owner (here, the Andasol Companies) or an indirect owner, being the last link in the
corporate chain (the Limited Partners).

248. However, Article 1(6) of the ECT expressly acknowledges that a qualifying investment

can be either direct or indirect, with no mention of any ultimate owner requirement. Spain
seeks to import words into the ECT. None of the five legal authorities cited by Spain in
this regard support this view, and the fact that any indirect owner, regardless of its position
in the chain of ownership, may qualify as an investor under the ECT, is uncontroversial *°°
If Spain’s argument were accepted, a corporate entity that indirectly owns an investment
could never qualify as an investor under the ECT, since a natural person or a State will
always be the ultimate beneficial owner.>!° Article 17(1) of the ECT further supports this
position, since it contemplates the possibility that a claimant entity may not be the ultimate
beneficial owner, limiting the protections offered by the ECT in those circumstances only

to entities that are owned or controlled by an entity from a non-Contracting Party.*!!

249. In any event, the Limited Partners could not be the proper claimants in this arbitration.

Under French Law, Antin Fund 1 is a fonds commun de placement with no legal
personality, but which is the legal owner of Antin’s 45% stake in the Andasol companies,
and thus the ultimate owner of the assets of the Andasol Companies. The Limited Partners
are characterized under French Law as “unit-holders”, and do not have ownership rights
over the assets of Antin Fund 1. Since Antin Fund 1 has no legal personality, it is
represented by Antin IP, a management company, which can defend the rights and interests
of its unit-holders. Therefore, even though the Limited Partners have subscribed the units
issued by the Fund, they do not have direct ownership rights nor control over the assets of
Antin Fund 1. Also, if one were to adopt Spain’ position, the chain of ownership would not
stop at the Limited Partners; it would be necessary to peel all layers of ownership until the
natural person or State at the top.3!

Second, the Claimants allege that they control the Interests.

The Claimants assert that they exercise control over the Interests, and in any event, Antin
Fund | and Antin IP are not the proper claimants in this arbitration, as Spain implies.
Moreover, the Claimants in this arbitration are bringing the claims on their behalf, and not
on behalf of the Fund.

The Claimants maintain that the relevant test for control is the broad test set out in
Understanding No. 3 of the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference, which
is a question of fact to be determined on a case-by-case basis. The list of factors set out in
Understanding 3 is not exhaustive, the demonstration of the capacity to control is sufficient
to meet the test, and the Claimants meet such a test.>'3

The Claimants have both the capacity to control and actually control the Interests, rather
than being simple vehicle entities: both Claimants exercise influence over the management
and operation of the Andasol Plants and make their own investment decisions taking into
account the best corporate interests of each./4 Moreover, Antin Fund 1, which Spain
argues exercises control over the Interests, cannot bring a claim since it is not a separate
legal person. Antin IP, its managing company, does exercise control over the “Interests”,
but this does not prevent other entities in the Antin structure from bringing a claim.*'5

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

According to the Claimants, Antin Luxembourg and Antin Termosolar directly and
indirectly own and control the “Interests”, and therefore, the Tribunal has jurisdiction
ratione materiae. Such “Interests” comprise: (a) direct and indirect shareholdings and debt
interests in the Andasol Companies that own and operate the Andasol Plants (Article
1(6)(b) of the ECT); (b) interests in the Andasol Plants (Article 1(6)(b) of the ECT); (c)
claims to money (Article 1(6)(c) of the ECT); (d) returns (Article 1(6)(e) of the ECT); and
(e) rights conferred by law, including those conferred by RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010
(Article 1(6)(f) of the ECT).*'°

Spain has taken issue with the link between the Claimants and the “Interests” they have
identified as being protected investments under the Treaty. The Respondent argues that the
only investments for purposes of Article 1(6) of the ECT, and therefore, the only
investments on which the Tribunal holds jurisdiction, consist of the shares on the Andasol

Companies owned by Antin Termosolar and the receivables from loans granted to the

Andasol Companies by Antin Termosolar.>!”

256. Spain does not dispute:

(a) that Antin Termosolar may bring a claim for any deterioration in the value of its
shares as a result of the Disputed Measures or for the loss of value of the receivables
from loans granted by Antin Termosolar to the Andasol Companies;

(b) _ that the Interests for which the Claimants advance their claims in this arbitration fall
under the non-exhaustive categories of assets listed in Article 1(6) of the ECT, or
that these qualify as investments under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention; and

(c) that the investment is “associated with an Economic Activity in the Energy

Sector.”3!8

257. Article 1(6) of the ECT provides:

“(6) “Investment” means every kind of asset, owned or controlled
directly or indirectly by an Investor and includes:

(a) tangible and intangible, and movable and immovable, property,
and any property rights such as leases, mortgages, liens, and pledges;

(b) a company or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms
of equity participation in a company or business enterprise, and
bonds and other debt of a company or business enterprise;

(c) claims to money and claims to performance pursuant to contract
having an economic value and associated with an Investment;

(d) Intellectual Property;

(e) Returns;

(f) any right conferred by law or contract or by virtue of any licences
and permits granted pursuant to law to undertake any Economic

Activity in the Energy Sector.”

258. Article 26(1) of the ECT on the settlement of disputes between an Investor and a
Contracting Party also requires that such a dispute be “relating to an Investment of the

latter in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of the
[Contracting Party] under Part III.”3!?

259. The Tribunal recalls that, according to Article 31 of the VCLT, a treaty is to be interpreted

in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to its terms in their
context and in the light of its object and purpose.

260. Based on the terms of Article 1(6) of the ECT, the Investment must be either: (i) owned by

the Investor, directly or indirectly; or (ii) controlled by the Investor, directly or
indirectly.*°°

261. It is common ground between the Parties that Antin Luxembourg owns 100% of the shares

in Antin Termosolar, Antin Termosolar in turn owns 45% of the shares in each of the two
Andasol Companies —the remainder of the shareholdings of the Andasol Companies are
owned by RREEF (45%) and ACS (10%)—, and the Andasol Companies own and operate
RE power-generation facilities in Spain.*?! Since Antin Termosolar directly owns 45% of
the shares in the Andasol Companies, Antin Luxembourg —owner of 100% of the shares
of Antin Termosolar— owns or controls such shares in the Andasol Companies
indirectly.*?

There is nothing in the text or context of the ECT that supports Spain’s position. Article
6(1) refers to direct or indirect control or ownership, but nowhere in its text or in the context
of the ECT is there a requirement that only the real and ultimate owner or beneficiary may
submit claims to arbitration.

Spain’s seeks support for its proposed concept of “indirect ownership” in the preparatory
works of the ECT, and particularly in the preparatory work of a Sub-Group of the ECT.*4
The Tribunal is not persuaded by Spain’s allegations.

First, the preparatory works, under Article 32 of the VCLT, constitute a subsidiary means
of interpretation that serves to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of
Article 31 or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to Article 31
(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) leads to a result which is manifestly
absurd or unreasonable. There is nothing resulting from the application of VCLT Article 31
to the interpretation of Article 6(1) of the Treaty that suggests that only the ultimate
shareholder can claim in respect of the investment, much less obscurity or ambiguity in
Article 6(1) that requires resorting to the subsidiary means of interpretation of VCLT
Article 32.

Second, the Contracting States, contrary to the suggestion of the ECT Sub-Group,*?>
decided that it was not necessary to include a definition of indirect ownership. Thus, even
if the preparatory works were to be considered for the purposes of the interpretative
exercise as Spain proposes, they suggest that the Contracting States considered the
definition of Investor, and the concept of indirect ownership or control, as finally reflected
in the ECT, to be sufficiently clear.

Therefore, there is nothing in the ECT that requires the Tribunal to perform an analysis of
“indirect possession” up until the last “possessory stage,” to find such “real and ultimate
owner.”*”° Furthermore, nothing in the ECT suggests that the presence of intermediary
companies in the corporate chain between Antin Luxembourg and the Andasol Companies
deprives Antin Luxembourg of protection.

Spain has further argued that the Claimants may not bring claims in this arbitration for
alleged damages caused to the assets of a company (i.e., interests in the Andasol Plants,
claims to money, returns and rights allegedly conferred by RD 661/2007 and
RD 1614/2010).*?” According to Spain there is a “lack of jurisdiction ratione materiae of
the Arbitral Tribunal to hear the Claimants’ claim for alleged damages to the renewable

energy production plants, given that the legitimation for such claim corresponds
exclusively to the Spanish companies that own these production plants [...].”>7*

According to Spain, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is limited to the direct ownership of shares
and loans by Antin Termosolar in the Andasol Companies and therefore the assets of the
Andasol Companies should be excluded from this arbitration because they are not
investments protected by the ECT.

The Tribunal recalls that the definition of “Investment” under ECT Article 1(6)(b) covers
“every kind of asset owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor,” and includes

“shares;” “a company” or “business enterprise;” “Returns,” and “any right conferred by

law.”

Spain does not seem to dispute that Antin Luxembourg indirectly owns shares in the
Andasol Companies and that Antin Termosolar directly owns shares and loans in the
Andasol Companies.*”? Therefore, under the ordinary meaning of the ECT, Antin
Luxembourg has an investment consisting of an indirect shareholding in the Andasol
Companies and Antin Termosolar has an investment consisting of a direct shareholding in
the Andasol Companies and a direct interest in the loans to the Andasol Companies. It is
by reason of such shareholding (direct and indirect) that Claimants are claiming an Interest
in the Andasol Companies,>**° in other words, the Claimants are claiming “damages caused
to the value of their shareholding interests in the Andasol Companies.”**!

Spain does not contest the decisions of different arbitral tribunals invoked by the Claimants
and that support their position, but relies instead on the decisions of the tribunals in S7-AD
v. Bulgaria and PoStova v. Hellenic Republic to support its allegation that claims for the
so called “reflective losses” by shareholders are not permitted under investment treaties.
The Tribunal disagrees. In the ST-AD case the tribunal held that although the rights of a
subsidiary are not the same as the rights of the parent company, the latter is entitled to bring
claims under the treaty for actions directed at the subsidiary and affecting the assets of the
subsidiary that cause loss to the value of the shares held by the claimant parent company.**?
Ultimately, the ST-AD tribunal found that it lacked jurisdiction ratione temporis and
jurisdiction ratione voluntatis,>® not jurisdiction ratione materiae. In the Postovd case the
tribunal declared that an investor had not made an investment because the investor based
its claim not on its shareholding in the corresponding company, but rather on an alleged

direct interest on the asset itself.>*4 The facts of the two cases are thus substantially different
from the case before this Tribunal and do not support Spain’s objection.

272. Finally, the Respondent claims that Article 17(1) of the ECT on the denial of benefits
supports its view that only an “Investor” that is the last link in the possessory chain qualifies
for protection under the ECT.

273. Article 17(1) provides that the benefits of the ECT are to be denied to a legal entity if that
entity is owned or controlled by nationals of a “third state.” Therefore, Article 17(1), on
the one hand, confirms that a claimant entity need not be the ultimate beneficial owner,
and on the other hand, denies the protection to claimant entities that are owned or controlled
by an entity from a non-Contracting Party. The provision contains no limitation on claims
brought by intermediary companies that are owned or controlled by “Investors” of
Contracting Parties.

274. The Claimants have sought restitution of the legal and regulatory regime under which they

made their investments. In the alternative, the Claimants seek damages “for the lost fair
market value of their investments, comprised of lost historical and future cash flows”:**°
first, compensation in the form of Antin’s share of the extra cash flows Antin’s CSP plants

matters of liability and any damages for breach will be dealt with below, with respect to
the foregoing jurisdictional objections to the application of the ECT, the Tribunal
concludes that the Claimants have standing under the Treaty to bring claims in respect of
Spain’s measures which, although directed at the Andasol Companies and its assets,

275. The Tribunal thus rejects Spain’s objections.

Cc. WHETHER THERE IS A LACK OF JURISDICTION TO HEAR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS

ARISING FROM THE TVPEE

1. Respondent's Position

276. Spain submits an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the Claimants claims in respect

of the TVPEE. The Claimants argue that the adoption of the TVPEE amounts to a breach
of Article 10(1) of the ECT. However, Article 21(1) of the ECT establishes that “nothing
in this Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation Measures
of the Contracting Parties” (the “taxation carve-out”) and provides an exhaustive list of
exceptions to this general principle that does not include Article 10(1) of the ECT.
Consequently, according to the Respondent, Article 10(1) of the ECT imposes no
obligations to Contracting Parties regarding taxation measures.*”

277. Spain further argues that, under Article 26 of the ECT, it has only consented to submit

disputes to arbitration related to alleged breaches of Part III of the Treaty. While Article
10 is included in of Part III of the Treaty, no obligations arise under Article 10(1) regarding
taxation measures, and therefore there is no obligation which would have allegedly been

application of the Original Regulatory Regime under RD 661/2007. The Actual scenario reflects the “mid-stream
switch” described in the Regulatory Report, introduced by RDL 9/2013, RD 413/2014 and the Ministerial Order
of June 20, 2014. [...] We conclude that in the Actual world the alleged violations reduced the fair market value

breached by Spain through the introduction of any taxation measures, and particularly the
TVPEE. Consequently, Spain has not granted its consent to arbitration in respect of any
dispute related to the alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT arising from the
introduction of the TVPEE.*”°

278. Taxation measures are defined in Article 21(7)(a) of the ECT as including any provisions

relating to taxes of the domestic law of the Contracting Party. According to Spain, whether
a provision relates to taxes should be determined in accordance with the national law of
the corresponding Contracting Party, as may be derived from the wording of Article
21(7)(a)(1) of the ECT. Certain terms of international treaties may be defined in accordance
with national law, as it has been recognized by previous tribunals**!
as by double taxation agreements concluded by Spain with the Netherlands and
Luxembourg, which can be used to interpret the ECT in accordance with Article 31(3)(c)
of the VCLT.*” Also, it could be argued that a determination on the nature of a taxation
measure should be adopted in accordance with international law, pursuant to Article 26(6)
of the ECT. Although Spain believes the first approach to be correct (taking into account
Spanish domestic law), both lead to the conclusion that the TVPEE is a tax measure, since
(i) Law 15/2012 is part of the national legislation of Spain and (ii) the provisions of Law
15/2012 regarding the TVPEE are provisions on taxes.*“° The latter is true both according
to national law and to international law.**

and doctrine, as well

279. Under domestic law, there is no doubt that the TVPEE is a direct tax over the production

and incorporation of electrical energy in the SES.**° This has been ratified by the Spanish
Constitutional Court and is clearly established in Article 1 (“Nature”) of Law 15/2012.54
The Institute of Accounting and Account Audits has also recognized the taxable nature of
the TVPEE, explaining that it is an expense fiscally deductible from the Corporations Tax,
which has been confirmed by the Spanish General Directorate of Taxes.**’ The relevance
of these statements is undisputable, as stated by the ad hoc committee in Soufraki v. United

Arab Emirates (Annulment).**

280. Likewise, according to Spain, there is no doubt that the TVPEE is a tax from the

perspective of international law. This is a question of the legal operation of the measure,

rather than its economic effect. Other tribunals have set out the characteristics of a tax as
follows: (i) it is established by law, (ii) said law imposes an obligation on a category of
people, and (iii) this obligation entails payment of money to the State for public
purposes.*“? These elements are all present in the case of the TVPEE.** Additionally, the
European Commission has ratified the taxable nature of the TVPEE and its conformity
with EU law.*!

281. Spain further argues that it is not appropriate to carry out any additional examination on

the TVPEE, as sought by the Claimants. First, the good faith analysis carried out by the
tribunal in Yukos v. Russia (Award)>* is not applicable in this case. Such analysis was
carried out due to extraordinary circumstances not present in the case at hand, namely that
the alleged taxation measures pursued a purpose entirely unrelated to obtaining revenue
for the State, such as the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political
opponent.**? According to the Respondent, as opposed to the Yukos arbitration, in this case,
the Parties’ dispute concerns a law of general application and not specific actions for tax
collection and inspection —freezing and liquidation of assets— carried out by the Russian
tax administration in respect of one specific taxpayer.***

282. Second, the analysis proposed by the Claimants entails an examination of the economic

effects of the tax rather than its legal operation, which was discarded by the tribunal in
EnCana v. Ecuador °°

283. In any event, even if such an analysis were to be carried out, the TVPEE is a bona fide

taxation measure.**° First, it applies to all energy producers, both conventional and
renewable, without any distinction, and it cannot be argued that it is not a bona fide measure
because it grants equal treatment to all without including tax benefits for renewable
producers.**’ In this sense, the Spanish Constitutional Court stated that the Spanish
Constitution does not grant a right to unequal regulatory treatment and that the generalized
application of the TVPEE corresponds to a valid choice made by the legislator, which has
a wide margin for establishing and configuring the tax.*** Besides, the fact that TVPEE is

established for all electric power generation facilities, regardless of the technology used, is
linked to the environmental nature of the tax, as laid down in the preamble to
Law 15/2012.5°

284. Second, the TVPEE does not discriminate against RE producers.** Law 15/2012 grants

the same treatment to all TVPEE taxpayers, whether they are renewable or conventional
energy producers.**! Since the TPVEE is one of the costs remunerated to renewable
producers through the regulated regime applicable to them, the economic effect of the
TVPEE on said producers is neutralized.** The specific remuneration set for renewable
producers allows them to recover certain costs that, unlike conventional producers, they
cannot recover in the market, including the TVPEE.*”

285. Third, the objective of the TVPEE is to raise revenue for the Spanish State for public

purposes. Said revenue is integrated into the General Budgets of the State and an amount
equivalent to the estimated annual revenue arising from the taxes included in Law 15/2012,
included the TVPEE, is allocated to financing the costs of the electricity system concerning
the promotion of renewable energy.** Law 15/2012 also created other taxes, for instance,
on nuclear energy producers. An amount equivalent to that levy is also assigned to finance
the costs of the RE system. However, the Claimants are not arguing that those taxes on
nuclear energy producers are not bona fide>°*

2. Claimants’ Position

286. The Claimants allege that the taxation carve-out set out in Article 21 of the ECT does not

apply if the challenged measure is not a bona fide tax. Therefore, the Tribunal must
determine whether the TVPEE contained in Law 15/2012 is a bona fide tax or whether it
is a measure implemented under the guise of taxation. This assessment requires a factual
enquiry.*°°

287. According to the Claimants, Spain implemented the TVPEE as part of a series of measures

designed to strip away and dismantle the incentive regime upon which the Claimants were
induced to invest. It was a backdoor tariff cut labelled as a tax to scale back even further
the incentives provided for under RD 661/2007, in breach of Spain’s obligations under the

ECT, and has had an unfair direct economic impact on installations that qualified under the
RD 661/2007 economic regime.>*”

288. The requirement that taxation measures be bona fide follows from the principle of good
faith, reflected in Article 26 of the VCLT. It follows from this principle that Spain cannot
avoid liability by framing a measure as a tax and then pointing to the literal wording of the
carve-out in a manner that amounts to an abuse of rights, calculated to frustrate the object
and purpose of the Treaty.*°* One of the objects and purpose of the ECT is to ensure that
qualifying foreign investors are accorded FET. Hence, Spain must not use its tax powers
to frustrate the rights of the Claimants to FET by stripping away their rights in a way
calculated to fall within the taxation carve-out of the ECT.*® It was not the object or
purpose of Article 21 of the ECT to enable States to frame their conducts under the guise
of taxation measures in order to achieve an unlawful end with impunity.3” As a
consequence, the taxation carve-out only applies concerning bona fide taxation measures.

289. Good faith obliges States not to violate the requirement of consistency, linked to the
principle of estoppel, and therefore, when seeking to avail itself of an exemption in an
international investment agreement, a State must not act in a way that is manifestly
inconsistent nor flout the principle of estoppel. Likewise, a State cannot implement a
measure with a declared purpose that is in fact mada fide in nature. As applied to the present
case, this principle entails that Spain cannot benefit from its own inconsistencies by making
specific commitments to investors and then implementing a disguised tariff cut to avoid
honouring those commitments and investor protections under the ECT.*”!

290. Determining whether a taxation measure is bona fide must be inferred from the conduct of
the State and determined on the balance of probabilities. Therefore, it is necessary to look
behind the State’s labelling of a measure as a tax, as determined in the Yukos v. Russia
case.>” Here, the Claimants argue that they are not making factual comparisons between
the specific conduct of Russia, as referenced in the Yukos arbitration; rather, the Claimants’
case is that the Yukos v. Russia tribunal analysis of the taxation carve-out under the ECT
and its finding that a tax must be bona fide applies generally.” The Tribunal must
determine whether the implementation of the TVPEE is “more consistent with” the

conclusion that it forms part of a scheme to deprive the Claimants of the rights they were
granted under RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010, despite the stabilization provisions
included therein. Moreover, where, as in this case, there is prima facie evidence that the
TVPEE is arbitrary or wherever Spain’s explanation for the measure is inconsistent or
contradictory, the Tribunal may draw inferences in favour of the Claimants, and the burden
of proof switches to the respondent State to provide rational explanation for its conduct.”

291. In the present case, it is apparent from Spain’s conduct that the TVPEE is not a bona fide

tax, but a measure designed to strip away the rights of the Claimants’ installations under
the RD 661/2007 regulatory regime.>”°

292. First, the Government’s conduct reveals that the TVPEE was intended as a tariff cut. By

applying the so-called “tax” to all revenues generated by the plants, the measure would be
equivalent to a tariff cut or a reduction in the amount of incentives RE installations were
entitled to, since (i) RE generators operate in a regulated environment where most of the
revenues were fixed by the Government, and therefore they had no chance but to absorb
the decrease in those revenues as a result of the levy, since they cannot pass it on to
consumers as conventional producers can,>”° and (ii) in all cases, the taxable basis would
be higher for RE installations, requiring them to pay a higher cost per MWh produced
compared to ordinary installations. Therefore, the TVPEE has a discriminatory effect on
RE producers when compared to conventional producers.*””

293. It is not true, as Spain argues, that the economic effect of the TVPEE on renewable

producers is neutralized because the TVPEE is one of the operating costs taken into account
in calculating the specific remuneration for such renewable producers under the New
Regime. The Claimants have suffered extensive losses as a result of both the TVPEE and
the New Regime, and the fact that the damages caused by the TVPEE alone are now
subsumed within the greater damage caused by the New Regime does not mean the
Claimants did not suffer losses as a result of the former.*”

294. These concerns were raised several times by the Claimants to the Government,>” which

through several comments acknowledged that the TVPEE was designed as a means to cut
the incentives it had committed to provide under RD 661/2007 and 1614/2010, since it was

conscious the same result could be achieved by cutting the applicable tariffs.**° Moreover,
the measure was implemented at a time in which Spain was already facing several claims
under the ECT arising from its retroactive cuts to RD 661/2007 and concerning RDL
14/2010.**! Therefore, Spain was on notice that further changes affecting international
investors were likely to provoke additional ECT claims. In this context, it may be inferred
that the TVPEE was framed as a tax with the purpose of avoiding liability for breaching
investors’ rights under the ECT and does not constitute a bona fide taxation measure.
Consequently, Spain cannot avail itself of the taxation exemption at Article 21 of the
ECT3*2

295. Second, the mala fide nature of the TVPEE is further evident for two reasons. On the one

hand, it goes against its proffered aim, i.e., to harmonize the tax system with a more
efficient and respectful use of energy resources with the environment and stability, as it
disproportionately impacts RE installations by its design, intending to cut the FIT
specifically designed to increase investment in the RE sector in Spain. This is evidenced
by the fact that (i) Spain considered no other alternative for achieving the alleged purpose,
(ii) Spain did not even consider the potential negative effects of the measure over RE
installations, (iii) the set tax rate was arbitrary and unsupported, and (iv) the TVPEE was
intended to be predominantly financed by RE installations, even though these installations
produce less than half of the electricity generated and sold to the market by the Ordinary
Regime. This shows that the TVPEE targeted the premiums and incentives that the
Government had committed to pay to RE installations. This discrimination is in direct
contradiction to Government commitments that induced foreign investors to invest, a
situation that the ECT tax carve-out was not intended to permit.**

296. Spain alleges that the objective of the TVPEE is to raise revenue for the State, included in

380

381

the General Budgets of the State, for public purposes. However, this fact on its own does
not mean it qualifies as a bona fide measure.*** The money raised by the TVPEE is directed
to reduce the costs of RE incentives in the electricity system and increase the income of
said electricity system rather than to encourage the development of RE, and thus it achieves
the same result as a tariff cut.*** The fact that Law 15/2012 also introduced two other taxes
on nuclear fuel and radioactive waste is irrelevant to this regard.>*°

297. Third, the TVPEE is not an isolated measure, but part of a chain of connected legislative
measures that deprived the Claimants of the rights to which the Andasol Plants were
entitled under RD 661/2007. These included the deprivation to the Andasol Companies of
their right to receive a FIT for the electricity produced using natural gas, the elimination of
the Premium and the change in inflation adjustments established under RD 661/2007, the
dismantling of the entire RD 661/2007 regime and an 11-month transitory period of
uncertainty before the establishment of the economic parameters under the New Regime
in June 2014.°*” All of these measures were adopted despite repeated assurances by Spain
that the Andasol Plants would be entitled to the benefit of the RD 661/2007 tariffs for their
operational lifetime.*** This factual context must be considered in analysing whether a tax
measure amounts to a breach of a treaty obligation, as clarified by previous tribunals.**°

298. Finally, it is necessary to clarify that a State’s labelling of a measure as a tax under its
domestic law or in accordance with international law, is not determinative as to whether
Article 21 of the ECT is applicable, as stated by previous tribunals.*°° Compliance with
domestic law is also irrelevant to this regard, since a State cannot rely on its own law to
evade international liability. Therefore, the ruling of the Spanish Constitutional Court, on
which Spain seeks to rely, and that determined that the TVPEE does not discriminate RE
producers, is irrelevant. So is the annulment decision in Soufraki v. United Arab
Emirates.*”' There, the ad hoc committee analysed whether the nationality of the claimant
was determined on the basis of national, rather than international law, which is a
completely different context from the one in the case at hand.*

299. Likewise, the characterisation of a measure as a tax in accordance with international law
is in no way determinative as to whether the taxation carve-out is applicable. The
European Commission decision relied on by Spain is also irrelevant, since said decision
did not examine the nature of the TVPEE as a tax nor ratified its conformity with EU law.
Consequently, the Claimants’ claim regarding the TVPEE falls within the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction.

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

300. Spain has advanced an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide the Claimants’

claims in respect of the TVPEE. According to the Respondent, given the taxation carve-
out in Article 21 of the ECT, Article 10(1) of the ECT does not apply to taxation measures.

301. The Claimants allege that Spain breached its obligation to accord FET to their investments

under Article 10(1) of the ECT, in part, by adopting the TVPEE introduced by
Law 15/2012. According to the Claimants, the ECT indeed gives rise to obligations
concerning non-bona fide taxation measures; the taxation carve-out in the Treaty does not
apply if the challenged measure is not a bona fide tax.

302. Law 15/2012, which applies from 1 January 2013, imposed a 7% levy on the income of all

electricity produced and fed into the national grid during a calendar year.>”°

303. The Claimants consider that this is a back-door tariff cut to the RD 661/2007 economic

regime because the levy applies on all revenues of the Andasol Plants, which come from
the FIT, rather than on their profits. Therefore, by taxing all revenues, “the Government
simply cut the tariff."°°° According to the Claimants, the measure is more akin to Spain
unilaterally imposing a royalty on gross income. The purpose of the TVPEE was to obtain
additional resources from generators in order to “balance the budget” of the Electricity
System.” The Claimants argue that the Minister of Industry, Energy and Tourism
expressly acknowledged that Spain could have reached the same result through a direct cut
to FITs, but chose instead to do so by means of the levy.*°* The Government’s conduct
would thus reveal that the TVPEE was intended as a tariff cut, notwithstanding the fact
that it was labelled and presented as a tax.

304. The Claimants also allege that the TVPEE is not a bona fide taxation measure, and that it

400

401

is part of a chain of connected legislative measures that deprived the Claimants of the rights
to which the Andasol Plants were entitled under RD 661/2007.* The TVPEE achieves
the opposite of its official aim —“harmoni[sing] [the] tax system with a more efficient and
respectful use of energy resources with the environment and sustainability —"*”° Instead,
it unfairly targets and has a disproportionally impact on RE installations.*°' Contrary to

what has been argued by Spain, the effect of the TVPEE is not neutralised:*°? “[t]he fact
that the damages suffered by the [TVPEE] alone are now subsumed within the greater
damage caused by the New Regime (as one of the costs that is covered by the Special
Payment) does not mean that the Claimants did not suffer losses as a result of the
[TVPEE].”"> According to the Claimants, the measure constitutes a cut to the FIT, which
was an incentive especially designed to increase investment in the RE sector in Spain and
which, according to the Claimants, the government had committed not to modify for the
lifetime of the investments.’ The funds from the TVPEE pay for the cost of RE incentives.
The Claimants argue that a measure that does the opposite of what it claims to achieve is
not only arbitrary, but mala fide.4°°

305. Central to Spain’s jurisdictional objection are Articles 21 and 10 of the ECT. In accordance

with Article 21(1) of the Treaty:
“TAXATION

(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this
Treaty shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to
Taxation Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the
Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.”

306. Although the term “Taxation Measures” is not comprehensively defined in the Treaty,

402

403
404

405

paragraph (7)(a) of Article 21 notes that “Taxation Measures” “include”:

“(i) any provision relating to taxes of the domestic law of the
Contracting Party or of a political subdivision thereof or a local
authority therein; and (ii) any provision relating to taxes of any
convention for the avoidance of double taxation or of any other

Regime. Also, Special Regime installations, such as the Andasol Plants, cannot pass on part of the 7% Levy to
consumers since their revenues are fixed by the Government. Ordinary Regime installations may raise the price
at which electricity is sold to the market, thereby increasing revenues. See Claimants’ Rejoinder, $f] 98-100. See
also Exhibit R-0144, Documentation relating to pilot proceedings 5526-13-TAXU conducted by the European
Commission regarding the TVPEE, Report submitted by the Spanish Ministry of Finance, and Public
Administration, 17 February 2014, p. 32 (“Renewable energy generators cannot pass through the [7% Levy] to
the market, because they may not determine the price they receive in exchange for the energy produced and
incorporated into the grid, but a premium which is regulated.” [Claimants’ translation]).

Respondent’s Rejoinder, {] 228-233. Spain argues that the 7% Levy is one of the RE producers’ operating costs,
that are taken into account in calculating their specific remuneration.

international agreement or arrangement by which the Contracting
Party is bound.”4%°

307. Spain argues that, by virtue of Article 26 of the ECT, it has only consented to submit
disputes to arbitration related to alleged breaches of obligations derived from Part III of
the Treaty. According to the Respondent, Article 10(1) of the ECT —although included in
Part III of the Treaty— does not generate obligations regarding “Taxation Measures” of
the Contracting Parties, and only paragraphs (2) and (7) of Article 10 would apply to such
measures. Spain goes on to conclude that no obligation arises from Article 10(1) in respect
of taxation measures, particularly through the introduction of the 7% Levy; and that
therefore, Spain has not given its consent to refer the dispute regarding the 7% Levy to
arbitration.4°”

308. The Claimants maintain that Spain’s position that “it is ‘not possible’ to have breached
Article 10(1) through the implementation of the [TVPEE] because it has ‘not given it[s]

consent to submit this controversy to arbitration’”
408

is incorrect and no issue of consent
arises.

309. Whether or not it is characterized as an issue of consent, the Claimants concede that if the
measure meets the bona fides requirement for which they contend, it will qualify as a
“Taxation Measure” under Article 21 of the ECT and will fall outside of the scope of
application of the ECT. As noted by the tribunal in Plama v. Bulgaria, and quoted by Spain
in its Counter-Memorial:

“{...] Article 21 of the ECT specifically excludes from the scope of
the ECT’s protections taxation measures of a Contracting State, with
certain exceptions [...]4

310. In this arbitration, the Claimants allege that Spain has breached the FET treatment
protection, included in Article 10(1) of the ECT. The Claimants have not submitted claims
under Articles 10(2) and 10(7), or 13 of the ECT. This is of importance, since Article 21

which provides for certain
claw-backs to the taxation carve-ou

311. The Tribunal must therefore determine whether the TVPEE is a taxation measure which

falls under the carve-out to the ECT provided for in Article 21(1) of the Treaty.

312. There is no doubt that the TVPEE is a tax under Spanish Law. Law 15/2012, which

introduced the TVPEE, is a domestic law adopted by the Congress of Spain.‘!? Article 1 of
Law 15/2012 expressly states that “[t]he tax on the value of the production of electricity is
a levy of a direct and real nature [...]” which applies throughout Spain.*'> Even, the
Claimants concede that the TVPEE falls within the “literal” definition of the word “tax.”4!4
However, they argue that “Spain’s labelling of a measure as a ‘tax’ cannot deprive
investors of protection under the ECT” and that “[i]f it were otherwise, then any taxation
measure by a State —no matter how egregiously abusive in nature— would be exempt
under the ECT.”!> The Tribunal concludes that the fact that the TVPEE is a tax under
Spanish law (and not merely the labelling of any type of State measure) is confirmed by
the manner in which the 7% Levy is accrued, declared and paid, and by statements of the
General Directorate of Taxes and the Institute of Accounting and Account Audits.*!¢

313. The Claimants also accept that the TVPEE meets the three-prong test advanced by Spain

regarding the characteristics of a tax under international law: (i) that the tax be laid-down
by law; (ii) that such law imposes an obligation on a class of people; and (iii) that such
obligation involves paying money to the State for public purposes.*!” It is the Claimants’
argument that this is not sufficient for the purposes of this dispute.

314. In this respect, the Claimants contend that the TVPEE, which bears the characteristics of a

410

tax at international law, is nevertheless not a bona fide taxation measure. The Tribunal
considers that if a measure bears the hallmarks of a tax under the applicable domestic law
and under the general approach taken by international law, it is very likely that the measure

will be excluded by operation of ECT Article 21. However, in exceptional circumstances
a measure that bears such hallmarks could not benefit from the taxation exclusion if a
claimant is able to demonstrate a lack of good faith on the part of the respondent.

315. While Spain considers that it is not appropriate to carry out the additional examination on

the TVPEE as alleged by the Claimants,*'* it argues further that even if the Tribunal did
so, the Tribunal would be bound to find that the TVPEE is a bona fide taxation measure.

316. As accepted by Spain at the Hearing —specifically in the context of this jurisdictional

objection—, “Article 26(6) of the ECT makes it compulsory upon arbitral tribunals to hear
cases not just under the ECT but taking into account also the rest of international law.”*!”
As such, in application of the general principle of good faith, parties are not allowed to
abuse their rights. The Tribunal recalls the words of Hersch Lauterpacht, quoted in Phoenix
v. The Czech Republic:

“There is no right, however well established, which could not, in
some circumstances, be refused recognition on the ground that it has
been abused.”4”°

317. It is well established in international law that at an abuse of right claim is subjected to a

high threshold of proof. The Tribunal must therefore determine if the TVPEE was adopted
by Spain with the precise aim of abusing its rights under the ECT, by strategically creating
the TVPEE to curtail the investors’ alleged rights under the Treaty, in a manner that
abusively sought to employ the taxation exclusion. Here, the Tribunal finds that the
Claimants’ evidence is lacking.

318. The Claimants point especially to the explanatory statements to a 2012 draft bill

introducing the levy,‘?! to communications sent by RE generators and investors to the
Spanish government and to certain statements made by Mr. José Manuel Soria, the Spanish
Minister of Industry, Energy and Commerce, as government conduct revealing that the
TVPEE is not a bona fide measure.

319. The Tribunal, however, does not find it to be even a close call that, on the totality of the

evidence before it, the TVPEE forms part of a “scheme” to deprive the Claimants of their
rights while precluding the Tribunal from examining the measure by way of Article 21 of
the ECT. Minister Soria’s interview to La Gaceta shows that the Spanish government
considered adopting a series of general measures to the energy sector, and that it opted to

first introduce taxation measures to address the deficit in the Electric System, and then it
would introduce certain regulatory changes.*”? These statements by Minister Soria are not
evidence that “Spain was intent on stripping away the rights afforded under the Original
Regime and implementing a tariff cut,” as argued by the Claimants.*?>

320. The Tribunal considers that Law 15/2012 and the TVPEE specifically is not merely a

measure /abelled as a taxation measure, but rather plainly it is a tax of general application
to all companies in the RE and conventional energy sector, in the pursuit of a public
purpose identified and pursued by the Respondent. As set out by the Secretariat of the ECT:

“The issue of taxation has great significance both for the private
economic agents in the energy sector and the involved states. While
foreign companies have a keen interest that they are not fiscally
discriminated, host_countries may wish to retain some discretion
concerning their tax treatment.”*?* [Emphasis added]

321. For the TVPEE, Spain has deemed it appropriate to apply as tax base the amount due by

the tax payer for the production of electricity and its incorporation into the electricity
system, measured at power station bus bars. As explained by Spain at the Hearing, the
TVPEE taxes “the income of the conventional and renewable producers for producing
energy and feeding it into the system.”*?° It is not uncommon for a State to tax income
received for carrying out an economic activity. And, as is the case with any income tax,
the greater the income, the greater the levy.

322. The Tribunal finds it appropriate to contrast the facts of the present case with the

apparatus decided to take advantage of [the investors’] vulnerability [...] by launching a

its assets while, at the same time, removing Mr. Khodorkovsky from the political arena.”4”°
In contrast to the Yukos tribunal’s findings on the facts before it, there is evidence on the
record of this arbitration showing that Law 15/2012 and the taxation measures it introduced
were designed with a general public purpose, rather than with the aim of employing a tax
for the entirely unrelated purpose of destroying the Claimants’ investments.*”’ The strong

contrast with the facts before the Yukos tribunal which led it to reject that respondent’s

the present case that provides any evidence of abuse of right.

323. Based on the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal accepts Spain’s jurisdictional objection
regarding the Claimants’ claims based on the TVPEE.

D. WHETHER THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE COOLING-OFF PERIOD WERE MET

1. Respondent's Position

324. According to the Respondent, the Claimants failed to request an amicable solution from
Spain or to observe the three-month cooling-off period, as required by Article 26 of the
ECT, in relation with Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 and
Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014.*?* Therefore, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear any
claims regarding these measures.*””

325. Article 26(1) of the ECT requires investors to attempt to settle any dispute amicably for a
period of three months, starting from the date of request of amicable settlement, before
submitting such dispute to arbitration. Thus, under the ECT, Contracting States have only
consented to resort to arbitration once amicable resolution has been requested and after the
three-months period has elapsed without reaching a resolution to the dispute. Failing to
meet these circumstances excludes jurisdiction of the Tribunal to hear the dispute.**°
According to Spain, this issue is a matter of jurisdiction, and not a matter of
admissibility.43!

326. The Claimants sent letters to the President of the Spanish Government on 26 April 2013
and 30 July 2013, requesting a friendly solution regarding potential disputes arising out of

purpose (such as the destruction of a company or the elimination of a political opponent)” are not shielded by
ECT Article 21.

jurisdiction regarding Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014 in Respondent’s Counter-Memorial because the
Claimants had not listed it as a disputed measure in the Claimants’ Memorial. Respondent’s Rejoinder, 4253 (“It

Law 15/2012 and RDL 2/2013, and RDL 9/2013, respectively. However, Law 24/2013,
RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 (jointly, the “Further Measures”) were
all enacted after the remission of such letters, and no request of amicable settlement was
ever submitted to the Government regarding these measures.**? Consequently, Spain has
not granted its consent to arbitration over disputes related to said measures, and the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear any claims related thereto.

Spain alleges that the Further Measures “cannot be considered to be part ofa single dispute
between the parties’**> According to Spain, Law 24/2013 is a law of the same hierarchy as
RDL 9/2013, its purpose is much broader than that of RDL 9/2013, and the Claimants’
allegation that Law 24/2013 was issued to develop and confirm RDL 9/2013 is incorrect.
RD 413/2014 is a regulation issued by the executive branch, developing Law 24/2013, and
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, also a regulation issued by the executive branch,
complements RD 413/2014.**> The Claimants’ reading of Article 26 of the ECT makes it
“useless” because it leaves the subject matter of the arbitration indefinitely open regarding
any regulation issued after RD 661/2007.4%

Spain argues, in the alternative, that such claims are inadmissible.” Furthermore, Article
26 of the ECT requires the communication of the dispute and the observance of the cooling-
off period regardless of the belief of its usefulness.***

2. Claimants’ Position

The Claimants allege that they complied with the three-month negotiating period under
ECT Article 26(1) before exercising their right to pursue remedies through arbitration by
serving their Request for Arbitration on 29 October 2013.4

According to the Claimants, Spain’s preliminary objection has no merit for three reasons.

First, the Claimants have complied with the cooling-off period because all the Disputed
Measures, including the Further Measures, are part of a single ongoing dispute between
the Parties regarding Spain’s failure to honour its commitments to the Claimants in relation

to RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010. This single on-going dispute has already been notified
to Spain, and the cooling-off period has expired without settlement.

332. Spain adopted a series of measures (Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013 and RDL 9/2013) between
December 2012 and July 2013 (the “Initial Measures”). The Claimants put Spain on notice
of the present dispute by letters dated 26 April 2013 and 30 July 2013 and filed their
Request for Arbitration on 29 October 2013.44

333. Although RDL 9/2013 completely withdrew the RD 661/2007 regime, it only established
a transitory regime and did not set out the specific economic parameters that would be
applied to the Claimants’ investments going forward.“"! The further legislation that set such
parameters, i.e., Law 24/2013, RD 413/2014, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 and
Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014—the Further Measures— were adopted after the
Claimants put Spain on notice of the present dispute and after they had filed the Request
for Arbitration. Both the Initial Measures and the Further Measures constitute a series of
related measures that rolled back and eventually withdrew the economic incentives of the
RD 661/2007 regime, and the fact that Spain issued further legislation defining the
parameters of the New Regime after the dispute was notified does not create a jurisdictional
(or even admissibility) hurdle that would shield Spain from responsibility for its illegal

acts.4?

334. According to the Claimants, it cannot be disputed that the Further Measures are
supplemental to RDL 9/2013. Both RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013 required implementing
legislation and the Further Measures fulfilled those requirements, as recognized by Spain
itself. In fact, Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, which completed the New Regime,
refers explicitly to RDL 9/2013 and the Government’s task of establishing a new legal and
economic framework, clarifying that this new framework would apply retroactively to the
date of RDL 9/2013.**4 Moreover, the Claimants clearly stated in both letters sent to the
Government and in their Request for Arbitration that they would include in this arbitration
any additional measures implemented against the CSP sector concerned with overhauling
the regime laid down by RD 661/2007.** There are further several other references in each
of the Further Measures that demonstrate how these measures are clearly inter-linked
between them and related to RDL 9/2013."

335. The Claimants further argue that their approach does not result in an open-ended arbitration

which would leave Spain defenceless against new claims. This dispute concerns
exclusively measures adopted by Spain as part of its decision to scale back and withdraw
the RD 661/2007 regime, which were already announced in RDL 9/2013. That the
Disputed Measures have been implemented over a long period of time is of Spain’s own
doing, and this cannot be a relevant criterion in determining the admissibility of the claims.
Spain’s argument is thus tantamount to saying that it would prefer the Claimants to

commence a new arbitration for each new measure, which is absurd.*4”

336. Numerous previous tribunals have held that where measures introduced by a host State

after the investor has requested arbitration are within the scope of the dispute outlined in
the request for arbitration, compliance with cooling-off periods is rendered moot.“* In
those cases, further measures adopted by the respondent States after the request of
arbitration was submitted were considered to be new elements of a same ongoing
dispute.*”” That is exactly the case at hand.

337. In any event, even if the Tribunal considers that the Claimants should have complied with

an additional cooling-off period, Spain’s objection would still fail, since the negotiations
would be futile. As stated by tribunals in previous arbitrations, non-compliance with a
cooling-off period would not justify refusing to hear the dispute, since such periods should
not be misused to obstruct arbitration proceedings.**°

338. In the case at hand, Spain has provided no indication that it is even willing to engage in

amicable settlement discussions with the Claimants. On the contrary, since the Claimants
filed their Request for Arbitration, Spain has continued to adopt further harmful measures
against the Claimants, causing additional losses to their investments. Hence, the futility of
any negotiations is self-evident. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to take the filing
of the Memorial as the relevant date for the first notification of a dispute regarding the
Further Measures, the cooling-off period has long expired and there is no reason to dismiss
any claims on that basis.**!

339. In addition, the Claimants maintain that even if the Tribunal does not agree with the

previous arguments, it should nonetheless accept jurisdiction, since the cooling-off period
objection goes to the admissibility of claims relating to the Further Measures rather than

to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction or competence to rule on those claims. This is supported by
(i) the ordinary meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, (ii) several investment-
treaty decisions, and (iii) the rationale of cooling-off periods, which is to facilitate
settlements, not obstruct arbitrations.**

340. Spain’s position that compliance with a cooling-off period is a precondition to consent

which failure precludes jurisdiction is not the prevailing view.‘ The three authorities
relied on by Spain to support such position do not advance its case, since they concern
specific factual situations that cannot be generalized and do not represent the current state
of investment-treaty jurisprudence.** Moreover, Spain’s interpretation is not supported by
Article 26(3) of the ECT, which makes it clear that consent to arbitration is not predicated
on compliance with the cooling-off period.** Therefore, failure to comply with this period
is not a jurisdictional hurdle.

3. Tribunal’s Analysis

341. Spain’s preliminary objection deals with the requirement set out in Article 26 of the ECT

that an investor and the Contracting Party to the Treaty attempt to reach a settlement of the
dispute amicably for a period of three months, prior to having the dispute submitted to
arbitration.

342. According to Article 26 of the ECT:

452

453

454

455

“(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of another
Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter in the Area
of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an obligation of
the former under Part III shall, if possible, be settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes cannot be settled according to the provisions of
paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date on which
either party to the dispute requested amicable settlement, the Investor
party to the dispute may choose to submit it for resolution:

(a) to the courts or administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party
to the dispute;

(b) in accordance with any applicable, previously agreed dispute
settlement procedure; or

(c) in accordance with the following paragraphs of this Article.

(3) (a) Subject only to subparagraphs (b) and (c), each Contracting
Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration or conciliation in accordance with
the provisions of this Article. [...]”4°

343. The Parties do not dispute that the Claimants sent two communications to Spain, dated 26

April 2013 and 30 July 2013, requesting negotiations with an aim of reaching an amicable
settlement, nor that such letters refer to the Initial Measures.

344. Indeed, in their 26 April 2013 letter, the Claimants stated that their investments “were made

in accordance with, and in reliance on, [RD 661/2007].”45” The Claimants alleged that the
Spanish Government had made numerous changes to the legal regime for CSP plants,
including, but not limited to RDL 12/2012, Law 15/2012, Law 16/2012 and RDL 2/2013,
and that “[t]hese and other measures taken by Spain substantially alter the legal framework
for the investments that Antin has made in the Spanish CSP sector.”*°* Such actions,
according to the Claimants, are not in compliance with the ECT.“°

345. In the Claimants’ letter dated 30 July 2013, they referred to RDL 9/2013 issued on 14 July

2013, describing it as a further measure which results in greater uncertainty, and which
constitutes an additional breach of the ECT, aggravates the dispute, and is expected to
cause further material harm to the Claimants’ investments. Both the April and July 2013
letters expressly requested that negotiations be carried out with a view to reaching an
amicable resolution to the dispute.

346. Of note, the Claimants’ allegation that Spain has not responded to their request to

460

commence negotiations has not been challenged by the Respondent. Indeed, the Claimants’
30 July 2013 letter informs that as of that date, the Claimants had not received any response

to their previous letter.“*! Spain only replied to the 26 April 2013 letter requesting that the
Claimants submit the letter in Spanish.4

347. Spain objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction —or to the admissibility of the claims, in the
alternative— arguing that the following measures —the Further Measures— were not
submitted for negotiation by the Claimants:

(a) Law 24/2013, adopted on 26 December 2013, and published in the BOE on 27
December 2013;

(b) RD 413/2014, adopted on 6 June 2014, and published in the BOE on 10 June 2014;

(c) Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, adopted on 16 June 2014, and published in the
BOE on 20 June 2014; and

(d) Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014, adopted on 14 October 2014, and published in the
BOE on 16 October 2014.

348. Spain also argues that requesting the amicable settlement and waiting for the expiry of the
term of the cooling-off period is a precondition for consent. In the alternative, it requests
that the Tribunal decide that the claims regarding the Further Measures be declared
inadmissible.

349. The Claimants respond by stating that: (i) they have complied with the cooling-off period,
since the Further Measures are part of a series of measures implemented by Spain and
which form part of one single dispute; (ii) further attempts to settle would be futile, and in
such circumstances, compliance with the cooling-off period would be unnecessary; and
(iii) in any event, the non-compliance with the cooling-off period does not prevent the
Tribunal from exercising jurisdiction of a dispute, as this is a procedural and not a
jurisdictional requirement.

350. The Tribunal finds that the Claimants’ 26 April 2013 and 30 July 2013 letters calling for
negotiations describe the dispute between the Parties as one concerning Spain’s alleged
breach of its obligations under the ECT, where after the Claimants made their investments
in accordance with, and in reliance on, RD 661/2007, Spain made numerous changes to the
legal regime for CSP plants, substantially altering the legal framework for their
investments. These measures, according to the Claimants, have caused serious and

substantial harm to their investments. The Tribunal’s reading of the Claimants’ description
of the dispute in their 26 April 2013 and 30 July 2013 letters is in line with the Claimants’
characterization of the dispute in the arbitration: “Spain’s failure to honour its
commitments under RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 that constitutes a breach of the
EcT."°

351. The Tribunal is thus tasked with determining whether the dispute, as communicated to

Spain, and for which the Claimants sought an amicable settlement, could be seen to include
both the Initial Measures and the Further Measures. The Claimants maintain in this respect
that the Initial Measures and the Further Measures constitute a series of related measures
that rolled back and ultimately withdrew the economic incentives upon which the
investments were made, specifically RD 661/2007.

352. The Claimants state that they invested in Spain in reliance of the regime established in

RD 661/2007, which was strengthened by RD 1614/2010. The Initial Measures which,
according to the Claimants, scaled-back and ultimately withdrew such an economic regime
consist on Law 15/2012 (which would include limitations to the RD 661/2007 regime in
the form of a tariff deficit), RDL 2/2013 (which would scale back the FITs in the RD
661/2007 regime even further), and RDL 9/2013 (applying “urgent measures [...] to
guarantee the financial stability of the electricity system,” and which would have
overhauled completely the RD 661/2007 economic regime for present and future
installations).“** Notably, RDL 9/2013 repealed RD 661/2007 in its entirety and directed
the Government, through the Ministry to adopt a new legal and economic regulation for
renewable energy production facilities.“°° This new regime for renewables was soon to
come, and RD 661/2007 continued to apply in a transitory manner until such new
regulation was approved. The Claimants indeed pointed out in their Request for Arbitration
that “[t]he New Regime under RDL 9/2013 is to be implemented” and that “[t]hese

implementing measures are currently the subject of legislative debate.”

353. The Tribunal considers that this objection by the Respondent must be rejected.

354. First, the Respondent itself acknowledges the inseparable relationship between the Initial

Measures and the Further Measures. It is undisputed that Law 24/2013 further developed
the principles set out in RDL 9/2013. It is true that Law 24/2013 is much broader than
RDL 9/2013, but Law 24/2013 repealed and replaced sections of RDL 9/2013. In turn,

RD 413/2014 developed Law 24/2013*7 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 itself

complements RD 413/2014.** None of these measures could thus be considered as
separate, much less as unrelated to the others.

355. Second, the dispute submitted by the Claimants for purposes of exhausting the cooling off
period refer to “Spain’s failure to honour its commitments under RD 661/2007 and RD
1614/2010 that constitutes a breach of the ECT.“ The Further Measures introduced
additional changes to the RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 regime and therefore, are clearly
related to the dispute submitted by the Claimants.

356. Third, Spain did not respond to the letters filed by the Claimants (except to request that the
letters be submitted in Spanish, which the Claimants did), and therefore the Respondent
could not claim that a cooling off period should have been exhausted with each measure,
when its lack of response suggests that such exhaustion would have been futile.

357. The Tribunal thus finds that the Initial Measures and the Further Measures are part of a
single, on-going dispute between the Parties, as communicated by the Claimants in their
26 April 2013 and 30 July 2013 letters. The Request for Arbitration was submitted well
after the negotiation period provided for in the Treaty had expired. Consequently, the
Tribunal does not find it necessary to address in its decision the remainder of the arguments
raised by the Parties, including whether the cooling-off period is a jurisdictional or a
procedural requirement.

358. In conclusion, the Claimants complied with the requirements set out in Article 26 of the
ECT in respect of requesting the initiation of negotiations regarding the dispute, and the
expiry of the three-month cooling-off period prior to commencing the arbitration.

VIII. MERITS OF THE CLAIMS
A. CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

359. The Claimants allege that they invested approximately EUR 139.5 million in the Spanish
RE sector, based on the expectation that their CSP plants would generate regular and
sustainable income that would allow the Claimants to service their debt and obtain a return
on their investment. However, contrary to these expectations, Spain adopted various
wrongful measures that have caused substantial losses to the Claimants’ investments in

“8 Respondent’s Rejoinder, § 250.
* Claimants’ Reply, 701.

97

Spain, due to the fundamental alteration of the applicable legal and regulatory framework
in reliance upon which said investments were made.*”

360. Consequently, according to the Claimants, Spain’s measures violate Article 10(1) of the

ECT, namely (i) the obligation to accord FET to the Claimants’ investments, (ii) the
obligation not to impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of the Claimants’ investments, and (iii) the
obligation to observe obligations it had entered into with the Claimants or their

investments.‘7!

1. Spain’s violation of the FET standard

361. The FET standard in the ECT is an independent and autonomous standard, which is

additional to the international minimum standard under customary international law.‘”

When interpreted in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, in their context
and in light of the object and purpose of the treaty, it may be concluded that the FET
standard is an absolute standard and, in its analysis, the Tribunal should consider whether
Spain’s conduct was conducive to the provision of a stable, transparent legal framework
for foreign investments in the energy sector. Because of the specific long-term nature of
energy investments, this article imposes a high level of protection.‘ This interpretative
approach is well established in arbitral practice.‘

362. Regarding the application of the FET standard, the preferred method in arbitral practice

470

an

has been the evaluation of the State’s conduct against non-cumulative criteria including
(i) whether the host State breached the investor’s reasonable and legitimate expectations
when the investment was made; (ii) whether the State failed to provide a stable and
predictable legal and business framework in relation to the investment; (iii) whether the
State’s conduct was transparent; (iv) whether the State acted in an arbitrary and
unreasonable manner; and (v) whether the actions of the State were disproportionate.*”>
Bad faith from the host State is not required in order to find a breach of the FET standard,
and good faith on the State’s part does not excuse such breach.*”°

a. Breach of Antin’s legitimate expectations

(i) — Antin’s legitimate expectations under the ECT

363. Spain breached Antin’s legitimate expectations on the application and stability of the

RD 661/2007 regime. The protection of such legitimate expectations, and particularly the
obligation to provide for the stability of the legal and business framework on which an
investor reasonably relied upon making its investment, is a central feature of the FET
obligation.*” This is particularly true in the energy sector where, as in the present case, a
substantial amount of capital is usually committed at the outset so as to generate a long-
term return.*”

364. Hence, Spain cannot alter the regulatory framework applicable to the Claimants’

investments in ways that would be unfair, unreasonable and inequitable, including by
undermining Antin’s legitimate expectations, based on the legal framework at the time of
the investment and on any undertakings made implicitly or explicitly by the host State.
Particularly, Spain cannot dispense with the entire legal framework it has put in place in
order to attract investments into its renewable sector and is instead required to honour its
commitments with respect to foreign investors.*”

365. The State’s conduct, which may contribute to the creation of a reasonable expectation and

upon which an investor is entitled to rely, may take the form of the legal framework in
relation to, or surrounding, the investment.** In the case at hand, Antin’s expectations were
twofold. First, at the time it made its investments, Antin expected that the Andasol plants
would be subject to the FIT regime for their entire operational life, since they complied
with all applicable registration requirements.**! Spain’s undertakings to this regard were
sufficiently specific to generate legitimate expectations, since (i) it provided stabilization
commitments in Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 for CSP plants and (ii) repeatedly confirmed
(including specific representations addressed to Antin in face-to-face meetings) that its
intention was for the FIT to apply for the lifetime of the plants without any retroactive
changes.***

366. Second, Antin expected that any future changes to RD 661/2007 would only apply to new

installations, while existing installations would remain unaffected. Spain had expressly

made such stability commitment in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and later confirmed this
interpretation by issuing RD 1578/2008, which introduced reductions of tariffs payable to
PV installations, but only to those that did not qualify for FITs under RD 661/2007.*3
Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 further reinforced these stability commitments, and the
Claimants’ expectations were enhanced by specific assurances by Spain’s public officials
that the economic regime would not be changed to the detriment of existing CSP
installations.**

367. Legitimate expectations are to be assessed at the time of the investment, rather than based

on ex-post interpretations.“*> Spain was aware that the stability and predictability of the
regulatory regime was essential to attract the investments it needed in order to develop its
RE sector, and the Ministry had made clear that “stability” meant that new legislation
should not be applied retroactively.**° Spain did not make any warning to investors that
they could face future tariff cuts if the Government changed its mind regarding what it
considered to be “reasonable profitability.”“*” In this sense, Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007
clearly provided for the non-modification of the FIT regime for facilities that had already
obtained their start-up certificate as of the date of any future reforms.***

368. Moreover, Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 specifically established that no tariff reviews would

apply to CSP facilities that had obtained definitive registration with the RAIPRE on or
before 7 May 2009, nor to any facilities that at the time of entry into force of RDL 6/2009
met the requirements for registration with the Pre-Assignment Registry and were
effectively registered in the RAIPRE on or before 31 December 2013. The Andasol Plants
met such requirements, since they were both registered with the RAIPRE by 22 December
2009.4

369. RD 1614/2010 was the direct result of an agreement between the CSP sector and the

Ministry (the July 2010 Agreement), as expressly confirmed by the Government, and was
thus seen by many investors, including the Claimants, as strengthening the stability of the
regime for CSP plants. This was especially important given the important retroactive
regulatory changes that had been adopted by Spain affecting PV facilities.4°° Moreover,
RD 1614/2010 offered stronger stabilization commitments than RD 661/2007, as expressly
recognized by the Ministry by extending such stabilization commitments to the Premium

option.””! Therefore, the Claimants legitimately expected that the FIT would apply for the
entire operational life of the Andasol Plants.“””

370. Spain alleges that there was no stabilization clause under Spanish law. However, Spain

provides no logical alternative interpretation to Article 4 of RD 1614/2010. Spain also
contends that the Claimants could not have legitimately expected the freezing of the
regulatory regime. However, the Claimants recognize that Spain had the possibility to
amend the regulatory regime, but honouring the commitments made to existing
investors.*°°

371. However, the Claimants’ expectations were not limited to the applicability of the FIT. The

Claimants also expected (i) to be allowed to use natural gas in combination with solar
energy; (ii) that the FIT would be updated annually in accordance with a CPI adjustment;
and (iii) that the Andasol Plants would enjoy priority of dispatch for the electricity
produced.4*

372. First, regarding the use of natural gas in combination with solar energy, it is clear that,

contrary to Spain’s allegations, Article 2 of RD 661/2007 allowed the production of
electricity under the Special Regime through natural gas. EU law context, including the
definition of “electricity produced from renewable energy sources” under the 2001
Renewables Directive, does not serve to exclude the existence of legitimate expectations
on the use of gas as expressly set out in RD 661/2007.** Likewise, contrary to Spain’s
allegations, RD 661/2007 does not contain any limitations regarding the circumstances on
which CSP plants could burn natural gas,‘°° and there was no indication at the time that the
incentive allowing for the use of natural gas while enjoying the FIT would be limited in
time. Had there been such a limitation, the Claimants would have acquired differently-
equipped plants.*””

373. Spain alleges that, as a result of their due diligence analysis, the Claimants’ knew that the

right to use natural gas could be withdrawn. However, none of the arguments set forth by
Spain demonstrate that Spain had any expectation different than that some gas usage,
around the percentages set out in the regulation applicable at the time, would always be
permitted for existing plants.*°* Moreover, Spain’s position regarding the Claimants’

legitimate expectation on the use of natural gas is entirely inconsistent with the
Government’s public statements, which make clear that this was one of the strong
incentives that the RD 661/2007 regime provided.4”

374. Second, Article 44(1) of RD 661/2007 established a mechanism to update the FIT pursuant

to the CPI (the “CPI Formula”). This mechanism applied to all facilities, regardless of the
date on which they started operations.*° Spain suggests that the Claimants should have
known that there could be a change to the CPI Formula, based upon a Supreme Court
decision from 2015, which therefore could not have been the basis for the Claimants’
expectations at the time the investments were made. In any event, Spain’s arguments are
irrelevant since Spain’s measures changing the CPI Formula only affected the
remuneration that the Andasol Plants received before Spain approved RDL 9/2013; under
the New Regime, remuneration is not subject to update in accordance with any CPI-related

formula.*°!

375. Third, the Andasol Companies enjoyed priority of access to the transmission and

distribution network, pursuant to RDL 7/2006, as well as priority of dispatch, pursuant to
RD 661/2007. Spain admits that the right to priority of dispatch was part of the original
regime under which the Claimants made their investments, but it is uncertain whether the

Andasol Plants would continue to enjoy such priority under the New Regime.*

376. Antin specifically relied upon the abovementioned guarantees and representations

provided for in the legislation, together with the additional assurances made by Spanish
public officials. In this sense, prior to investing in the Andasol Plants, the Claimants
rigorously analysed the associated risks by means of a thorough due diligence process.°
This process included an analysis of the legal, technical and market issues surrounding the

investment.°™*

377. First, the legal analysis included an assessment carried out by Herbert Smith and the

499

500

meetings held directly by Antin with Government representatives. As concerns Herbert
Smith, its assessment concluded with a legal memorandum which, although not creating
the Claimants’ expectations regarding the regulatory regime applicable to CSP generation,
did demonstrate the reasonableness of such expectations.*°> This memorandum did not

overlook the importance of the principle of reasonable return, but rather adequately
understood the unprecedented level of protection offered by Article 4 of RD 1614/2010.5°%

Regarding the meetings held directly by Antin with Government representatives, Spain
made direct representations to Antin reinforcing its legitimate expectations during two
meetings: one with Miguel Vizcaino, head of the legal department at the Ministry on 20
May 2011, and one with the General Secretary, the Chief Legal Advisor and the Assistant
Director for Special Regimes of the CNE, on 25 May 2011.°°

During the first of such meetings, Mr. Vizcaino confirmed that RD 1614/2010 provided a
long-term, stable regulatory framework for CSP, specifically mentioning that any future
changes would not affect existing facilities, such as the Andasol Plants. He also mentioned
that CSP facilities produced more electricity than the PV sector while using less subsidies,
which explained the retroactive changes affecting PV installations.*°*

The discussions held in this meeting are reflected in an email that clearly recorded the
representations made therein, and there has been no misrepresentation by the Claimants as
to what they were told there (i.e., that the regulatory regime applicable to CSP plants was
stable). Further, it is clear that legitimate expectations may arise therefrom, since the
meeting was formal, the assurances given were definitive and unambiguous and they
confirmed the representations included in RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010. Even if
Mr. Vizcaino was not authorized under Spanish law to make binding representations, this
does not allow for the denial of the Claimants’ legitimate expectations.*!° The Claimants
do not allege that Mr. Vizcaino committed to “petrification” of the Spanish legal system,
but rather that he expressly reassured the Claimants that any changes to the CSP regulatory
regime would not be retroactive.*!!

In the second meeting held with Government representatives, the CNE confirmed what
Mr. Vizcaino had said, i.e. that there was a stable regulatory regime in place for the CSP
5!2 Tt is undisputed that this meeting took place, and it is absurd to suggest that the
Claimants cannot derive any legitimate expectations from what was said in that meeting

sector.

because it contradicted the CNE report of 7 March 2012, since the investment decision was
made in June 2011.54

382. Second, Antin’s market analysis was conducted by Péyry.*!* The reports issued by Péyry

concluded, among others, that (i) the CSP industry was in a far safer position than the PV
industry; and (ii) the Spanish Tariff Deficit was not the result of the development of the
RE sector in Spain, since it already existed in 2007, and it could be managed without the
need to make retroactive changes to the RD 661/2007 economic regime for existing
facilities. Thus, such reports concluded that CSP was quite a safe market place to invest
in.5!> They did not, however, suggest (and Claimants do not argue) that Spain could not
change the regulatory regime applicable to CSP, but rather that it would not change such
regime for existing facilities.*"°

383. And Third, Antin’s technical analysis was conducted by Altermia, with the help of the

University of Seville and the Centro Nacional de Energias Renovables (CENER). Thanks
to this analysis, Antin gained confidence in the CSP technology and in the Andasol Plants,
concluding that they would be running efficiently. Antin was particularly interested in (i)
the thermal storage system that allowed the Andasol Plants to produce dispatchable
electricity, and (ii) the possibility of supplementing electricity production by using natural
gas.5!7

384. Thus, as a result of its due diligence process, Antin obtained certain guarantees and

representation in which absence it would not have invested in the Spanish CSP sector.

Antin’s expectations on the continued application of the RD 661/2007 economic regime

were perfectly legitimate for several reasons:*'*

(a) The FIT which Antin relied on had been offered under a royal decree that provided
the specific applicable tariffs.

(b) The RD 661/2007 regime was part of a wider international and domestic policy that
sought to develop RE power-generation infrastructure, under which Spain had
actively encouraged investment in RE projects.

385.

386.

(c) | Antin conducted a thorough due diligence process that confirmed that its investments
would be subject to the RD 661/2007 economic regime for the entire operational
lifetime of the facilities.

(d) The FIT was sufficiently attractive to encourage the necessary investments in RE
projects, which would not have been possible without it.

(e) RE power-generation projects raise debt project financing to fund part of their
investments, and the RD 661/2007 regime encouraged such debts, since lenders
could rely on the fact that the underlying assets would generate sufficiently high,
predictable and stable revenue streams.

(f) Spain continued to encourage investments in CSP during 2008 and 2009, confirming
that its expectations on the application and stability of the RD 661/2007 regime were
consistent with those of Antin.

(g) At a time when the PV sector was being hit by tariff cuts, RD 1614/2010 was
adopted, guaranteeing the CSP sector would not be affected.

(h) At the time Antin was finalizing its investments, Spain gave specific oral
commitments to it that the RD 661/2007 regime would not be altered.°!”

Additionally, contrary to Spain’s allegations, the Claimants’ investment in the Andasol
Plants is by no means speculative: the price paid was not unusually high, the level of returns
expected by Antin was not out of the ordinary, the lead-time for the investment was
determined by the provisions of the Antin Fund | bylaws and the project did not have an
unusually high-risk level.

Finally, Spain submits that it has made no specific commitments favouring the Claimants,
and that the regulatory framework could not create a legitimate expectation on the future
immutability of the regime. However, Spain did make specific undertakings regarding the
application of the FIT for the lifetime of the plants without any retroactive changes, in both
RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010, and repeatedly confirmed these intentions. Spain
deliberately offered a favourable, long-term economic regime that enabled capital-
intensive investments where the upfront capital costs are significant and can only be
recovered in the long-term, and its withdrawal is inconsistent with the object and purpose
of the ECT.*”° In this sense, several tribunals have determined that legitimate expectations

52 Claimants’ Reply, §f] 284-288.

may arise from the legal and regulatory framework, as was the case at hand, even if there
is no direct and specific undertaking in a contract between the State and the investor.*7!

(ii) The principle of reasonable return does not support Spain’s case

387. Spain’s defence is built upon the concept of “reasonable return”, arguing that the Claimants

ought to have been aware that the Government could change and entirely withdraw the RD
661/2007 regime as long as a reasonable return was guaranteed. However, the majority of
Spain’s arguments are an ex post and novel interpretation of the key statutory provisions
and core elements of the Spanish regulatory framework, developed solely for the purposes
of evading international responsil

 

388. Spain’s position on this regard is based on a misinterpretation of Article 30(4) of Law

54/1997 and the regulation that implemented it. This article did not define the concept of
reasonable return nor did it limit an RE producer’s entitlement to a reasonable return, but
rather served as a basis for the Government to set out the specific remuneration that would
provide a reasonable return through further regulation, which it did through RD 436/2004
and RD 661/2007.*73 The RD 661/2007 regime guaranteed a particular FIT, which the New
Regime did not respect, rather than a reasonable return on a fixed cost target,*” and the
Claimants could hardly have relied on anything other than the precise FIT set in the

applicable regulation in order to understand the concept of “reasonable return.”°”5

389. In this sense, both RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 set out a fixed remuneration and not a

521

percentage return based on a balance between incentives and consumer protection. The
preamble of RD 661/2007 expressly confirmed that the remuneration offered to qualifying
installations represented what Spain believed to be a reasonable return and would impose
an assignment of those costs attributable to the electricity system that was also reasonable,
therefore confirming there were no potential imbalances under the RD 661/2007 economic
regime.*”° Even if the 2011-2020 Renewable Energy Plan provided the possibility that the
Government might make changes to prevent compensation imbalances, and Spain was
obviously at liberty to change the regime for new facilities, it had expressly promised it
would not do so for existing ones.*?”

390. Spain further contends that the principle of reasonable return (i) imposes a balance between
the costs of the incentives and the return generated; (ii) has a dynamic character; (iii)
represents a guarantee for the investor; (iv) has a referenced character; and (v) imposes on
the regulator an obligation of result. However, these allegations do not support Spain’s
case, as follows. *7

391. First, the existence of a balance between costs and returns implies that (i) the Government
has unfettered discretion to change the FIT whenever it considers that returns are
unreasonable; (ii) returns can change over time; and (iii) the investor should take the blame
for the Government not dealing with the Tariff Deficit. All of this is inconsistent with
Spain’s stability commitments and with the nature of RE projects.°”?

392. Second, Spain argues that the dynamic character of the principle of reasonable return
entails that the Original Regime would be adjusted as investment costs are reduced. The
Claimants recognize that costs have come down and therefore subsidies may legitimately
be scaled back, but only for new facilities, since investments already made do not benefit
from the decrease in costs. This is the approach the Claimants legitimately expected Spain
to adopt, which makes economic sense and is consistent with the spirit of creating a “level
playing field” for investments made in the energy sector, as referred to in the ECT. Spain
argues that the Claimants ought to have known that the Special Regime was flexible, but
the preamble to Law 24/2013 asserts that such law was introduced precisely because the
remuneration system set forth in Law 54/1997 lacked the flexibility desired by Spain.**°

393. Third, Spain argues that the principle of reasonable return operates as a guarantee for the
investor, reducing the risk faced by him. However, Spain ignores the significant risks
incurred by investors like Antin, which the Original Regime (not the principle of
reasonable return) reduced to a minimum.**!

394. Fourth, Spain suggests that, under Law 54/1997, the reasonable return is necessarily
referenced to the cost of money in the capital market. However, the cost of money is only
one of the numerous factors to be taken into account in defining the remuneration of
qualifying facilities.**

395. And fifth, Spain argues that the principle of reasonable return must be taken into account
when putting in place a level of remuneration, therefore imposing an obligation of result.
However, Spain turns this into an unfettered discretion to introduce retrospective changes

without regard to the fact that expected returns are determined at the time the investments

are made.>*?

396. Additionally, Supreme Court decisions on the principle of reasonable return relied on by

Spain to support its position, cannot reasonably have been understood to override the close
and unambiguous statements made by Spain concerning the real meaning of RD 661/2007
and RD 1614/2010, since they either do not concern the Original Regime, refer to a
different sector or were rendered after Claimants’ investments were made.>** In any event,
whether the Disputed Measures are legal as a matter of Spanish law is irrelevant, since
domestic law is not a valid defence to international law claims.°*°

397. Spain relies on three categories of Supreme Court judgements: judgements issued prior to

the introduction of RD 661/2007, judgements issued on December 2009, and judgements
issued on 2012.**° Firstly, the judgements issued prior to the introduction of RD 661/2007
do not address the Original Regime at all and could not have been understood to derogate
from the numerous express assurances given by Spain concerning the continued
application of the Original Regime. Spain decided to make those stabilization
commitments notwithstanding such previous judgements, intending to protect investors
from the governmental regulatory discretion described in those judgements. In any event,
those judgements did not address the issue of whether a complete withdrawal of a
regulatory regime, such as the one resulting from RDL 9/2013, is in conformity with
Spanish law.*57

398. Secondly, the judgements issued on December 2009 pre-date RD 1614/2010, through

which the Government introduced express and binding stabilization commitments
notwithstanding previous Supreme Court decisions regarding the Government's discretion.
Moreover, at the same time when those judgements were issued, Spain made a statement
explicitly ensuring that future revisions of the RD 661/2007 tariffs would not affect
existing installations.*** Spain’s position is based on the premise that the judgements issued
on December 2009 are relevant because they dealt with detrimental changes introduced by
RD 661/2007 to the RD 436/2004 regime. However, RD 661/2007 actually improved the
conditions for CSP technology and most RE technologies, only marginally affecting the
wind sector, which in any event benefitted from appropriate transitory provisions that
contrast with the immediate effects of the Disputed Measures.**? These were the changes

accepted by the Supreme Court, which are fundamentally different from the immediate and
complete withdrawal of the RD 661/2007 economic regime carried out through RDL
9/2013.

Thirdly, the judgements issued in 2012 are completely irrelevant to the CSP sector, since
none of them dealt with the stabilization commitments of Article 4 of RD 1614/2010.
Additionally, the outcome of these judgements is irrelevant for assessing the Claimants’
expectations, since they were rendered after the investments were made.**!

Spain further alleges that the Claimants were aware that a reasonable return was provided
only regarding funds used for the construction of facilities, and not for funds used for the
acquisition of existing assets.*4? However, there is no indication in RD 661/2007 or
RD 1614/2010 that the FIT would be limited in such way, and this distinction between
investors does not make sense from a regulatory and economic point of view and is
contrary to the position of the EC on the matter.*“7

In the alternative, even if all the Claimants could reasonably expect was a “reasonable
return”, such return should not be lower than what Spain promised under the Original
Regime. As expressly recognized by the CNE, the rate of return Spain considered at the
time it approved RD 661/2007 was only indicative, and producers could obtain higher
returns.*4#
Further, Spain’s argument that royal decrees are subject to change while laws are stable is
irrelevant and false. The key issue is whether the subject-matter of the regulatory changes
can be applied retroactively to pre-existing situations, when those changes are in breach of
Spain’s international obligations. The replacement of the Original Regime for the New
Regime could perfectly have been done by royal decree, and there was no need for the
Government to resort to a royal decree-law, such as RDL 9/2013.5°

(iii) Spain’s measures frustrated Antin’s reasonable and legitimate expectations

Spain’s measures frustrated Antin’s reasonable and legitimate expectations dismantling the
existing legal and business framework after its policy goals regarding investment in CSP
facilities had been met.

404. First, the withdrawal under Law 15/2012 of the FIT for electricity production using natural
gas frustrated Antin’s expectations that the Andasol Companies would be entitled to
payment under the FIT for all the electricity produced. Moreover, through Ministerial
Order IET/1882/2014, the Government capped the use of natural gas only for essential
technical purposes, thus obliging CSP plants that used more natural gas than implied by
the formula under said Ministerial Order to reimburse the associated financial incentives
received between January and July 2013.*°

405. Contrary to Spain’s allegations, the fact that the cost of purchasing gas and the investment
costs incurred in building installations capable of operating using natural gas are taken into
account in the costs of a standard installation under the New Regime is not equivalent to
saying that electricity produced using a limited percentage of gas will be subject to the FIT.
Had the Claimants known that Spain was going to withdraw the economic incentives for
electricity produced using natural gas, they would likely have not invested in the Andasol
Plants at the same price.*“”

406. Second, the introduction of the TVPEE constitutes a disguised and unjustified cut of the
FIT, frustrating Antin’s expectations on the level of FIT the Andasol Companies would be
entitled to.“* Spain argues that the impact of the TVPEE has been neutralized since this
levy is one of the costs covered by the Special Payment under the New Regime. However,
even if the TVPEE is subsumed within the overall damage caused by the New Regime, the
Claimants have still suffered damages as a result of this measure.*””

407. Third, the elimination of the Premium through RDL 2/2013 frustrates Antin’s expectations
to choose between selling at a fixed tariff or at the market prices plus Premium. Spain’s
decision to eliminate the Premium was abrupt and unprecedented, which contrasts with the
transitory adjustments introduced by RD 661/2007 to the Premium applicable to existing
wind parks under RD 436/2004.5°

408. Fourth, the replacement of the CPI-linked updating mechanism for the FIT by a lower
index, adopted by RDL 2/2013, frustrates Antin’s expectations that the FIT would be
updated to reflect variations of CPI.**! Contrary to Spain’s allegations, there is no evidence
that the Claimants are better-off under the new formula, under which the FIT would now
be updated in accordance with a CPI at constant tax rates, excluding unprocessed foods
and energy products, than under the CPI Formula. Moreover, the new formula only applies

to remuneration of the Andasol Plants between January and July 2013, not under the New
Regime, and therefore it is irrelevant that the adjusted CPI happened to be higher than the
general CPI for some months in 2014 and 2015. It is also irrelevant whether the new
formula is in line with price index calculation standards, since Spain’s legislative
commitment was to adjust the FIT in accordance with CPI. Depriving the Claimants from
a remuneration updated in accordance with the CPI Formula makes their investments
subject to greater instability and unpredictability, since they now have to bear the inflation
risk.5°?

409. And fifth, by eliminating the RD 661/2007 economic regime entirely through RDL 9/2013

and introducing a substantially less favourable regime without FIT, Spain violated the basic
foundations upon which Antin made its investments, namely stable and predictable
revenue streams at levels that sufficed for servicing the debt acquired, providing a return
on their investments and justifying the significant risks they incurred.***

410. In the New Regime, the concept of reasonable return has also been changed and the

framework provided under Article 30(4) of Law 54/1997 has been withdrawn. In fact,
(i) the Special Payment under the New Regime is exceptional in nature, in contrast with
the FIT under the Original Regime; (ii) Spain has used hindsight to set the Special Payment,
set by reference to the investment costs of a standard installation, thus comparatively
penalizing efficient investors; (iii) Article 30(4), as amended by RDL 9/2013, introduced
a cap on the return of a standard facility based on what the Government considers
“reasonable” for the regulatory life of the plant, thus taking into account the returns
obtained by the facility during the time the Original Regime was in place and clawing back
what investors earned then; (iv) the Special Payment is calculated based on ex post
determinations of what investment and operation costs should have been; and (v) under
RDL 9/2013, contrary to the Original Regime, the Government can revise every six years
the reasonable rate of return that a plant is entitled to receive.*** The New Regime has been
so controversial that Spain currently faces several domestic and international challenges
against it, including 27 arbitrations under the ECT.*°°

411. In this sense, the tribunal in Micula v. Romania confirmed that the termination of an FIT

regime may result in a breach of the FET standard, **° and such is the case at hand. Spain
eviscerated all the key characteristics of the RD 661/2007 regime after having made

specific compromises to the Claimants, thereby frustrating their legitimate expectations
and breaching its obligation to provide FET.**”

412. Furthermore, even on Spain’s case, the New Regime does not provide a reasonable return.

Spain claims that the New Regime offers a mean annual benefit of 7.398% on the
investment taken. However, there is no indication as to whether this rate of return will
continue to apply in the future, and the concept of reasonable return is in itself subject to
change under the New Regime.*** Moreover, this is a pre-tax return, which is equivalent
to an after-tax return of only 5.2%, significantly lower than the return to which producers
were entitled under the Original Regime and only marginally above return on Government
bonds.>*? Spain considers that efficient investors will achieve higher returns; however, the
costs considered for such standard calculation are determined by reference to data compiled
from 2011, thus being significantly lower than those originally faced by the Andasol
Companies and hence unfavourable for investors such as the Claimants, who invested in
plants with higher investment and operating costs in return for a higher production

capacity.5°

413. Finally, contrary to Spain’s allegations, retroactivity for the purposes of this arbitration

means that changes in regulations affect installations already in operation, which is clearly
the case for the Disputed Measures. This was the position evidenced in Spain’s statements
prior to the adoption of said measures.*°' Further, the Disputed Measures are also
retroactive insofar as they claw back monies already paid by offsetting those revenues
against future revenues.°°

b. Spain has failed to provide a stable and predictable regulatory regime

414. Spain’s obligation to provide a stable legal environment is an essential element of FET,

particularly in the ECT context. However, stability cannot exist in a situation of continuous
and endless change of the legal regime regulating an investment, and therefore such a
situation will entail a breach of the FET standard.*® In the case at hand, Spain, after having
expressly committed to maintain the full RD 661/2007 regime in place in order to attract
investors like Antin, wrongfully subjected the Claimants to constant and drastic changes

in the applicable legal and regulatory framework. As stated by the Commission,*™ such
changes alter the legitimate expectations of business and discourage investment, which
cannot be considered conducive to the provision of a stable, transparent legal framework
for foreign investments, as sought by the ECT.*® Spain is permitted to change its regime
under the ECT, but those changes must be predictable and in line with the investors’
expectations.

415. Inline with the above, the stabilization guarantees under Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and

Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 have to be assessed in the light of Spain’s stability obligations
under the ECT.*®” Any changes made to the applicable regulation must be consistent with
such guarantees, as well as with the specific promises and representations made by Spain
that it would not change the Original Regime to the Claimants’ detriment. Even on Spain’s
own case, Spain has not respected the stability and predictability of the legal framework
by respecting the principle of reasonable return. Moreover, the ongoing uncertainty means
that the full scale of the negative impact of Spain's measures on the Claimants' investments
is not yet apparent.°°

c Spain’s conduct was not transparent

416. The FET standard requires States’ conduct towards investors and the applicable legal

environment to be transparent, i.e. free from ambiguity and uncertainty.*® In the case at
hand, Spain dismantled the RD 661/2007 regime in a manner that was not transparent.

417. First, RDL 9/2013 was followed by a transitory regime lasting more than 11 months,

during which the Government gave no indication regarding the precise remuneration that
any qualifying facilities, including the Andasol Plants, would be entitled to. This
constituted a major departure from the stability and predictability provided by the previous
regime. Although RDL 9/2013 provided that during this transitory period the Original
Regime would continue to apply, the New Regime takes into account payments received

during this period and deducts them from future amounts due under the New Regime,
which produces greater uncertainty.>”° This uncertainty was even criticized by the EC.°7!

Second, neither RD 413/2014 nor Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 provided any
transparent analysis explaining the underlying criteria behind the Special Payment or
whether there will be any future updates. Particularly, the Government, despite being
requested to do so, refused to disclose the reports prepared by Roland Berger and Boston
Consulting Group for preparing the standard assumptions applicable to the New Regime,
making clear that it had relied on its own calculations and analysis. Further, it appears that
both companies were retained to give recommendations that were compliant with the thesis
of the Government.>””

Third, the fact that the Special Payment is calculated by reference to a standard facility
which parameters may be discretionally altered by the Government, every three or six
years, creates further uncertainties.°”°

Fourth, this is aggravated by the fact that the Government also retains the right to review
the Special Payment in order to make sure that the prevailing yield on ten-year Spanish
bonds plus a spread continues to apply, but has not established any methodology for such
adjustments.°”4

Finally, the New Regime does not provide any clear indication as to the timeframe during
which the remuneration for installed capacity (one of the two elements of the Special
Regime, together with a remuneration per MWh of electricity produced) will apply.°”>

Spain contends that a public consultation opened in February 2012 regarding the measures
that would affect existing facilities, but this was unsatisfactory for investors like Antin
which, given the size of their investment, should have had the opportunity to provide its
views directly to the officials in charge of implementing the regulatory changes.*”°
Moreover, as acknowledged by the CNE, due to the urgency with which the consultation
was made, the effective participation of the different players involved could not be
guaranteed, and the CNE reports issued in February and March 2012 referred to by Spain

did not provide any visibility as to the scope of the changes that would be adopted and did

not satisfy any transparency requirements.*””

d. — Spain’s measures were unreasonable

423. Fora State’s conduct to be reasonable it must be related to a rational policy, and the State’s

acts of implementation of that policy must have been appropriately tailored to pursue such
policy with due regard for the consequences imposed on investors.*”* Spain does not satisfy
this test. Its justifications for the Disputed Measures were (i) the overcapacity of RE
infrastructure; (ii) the Tariff Deficit; (iii) ensuring consumer protection; (iv) dealing with
the economic crisis; and (v) complying with EU State aid rules. However, these are either
problems resulting from Spain’s own regulatory decisions, and the burden of fixing them
cannot be attributed to foreign investors in violation of their legitimate expectations, or
issues that do not justify dismantling the Original Regime.°”

424. Regarding the first alleged justification, such overcapacity is the consequence of Spain’s

own failure to locate sole central control over access to the economic benefits of RD
661/2007. This control was instead granted to the Autonomous Communities which, in a
context of crisis, were willing to accept all qualifying applications. Spain acknowledged
this regulatory misjudgement when enacting RDL 6/2009.°*°

425. Concerning the second alleged justification, which appears to be the primary purpose of

the Disputed Measures, addressing the Tariff Deficit is not a valid excuse for implementing
such measures. First, the measures are not reasonably correlated to a rational policy goal.
The Tariff Deficit existed long before the development of CSP in Spain due to the failure
by Spain to raise regulated tariffs (network access tolls) to the level necessary to cover the
costs of the system, despite being obliged to do so by its own laws, particularly
Law 54/1997, RDL 6/2009 and Supreme Court decisions.**!

426. Spain’s own documents acknowledge that, as of 2011, the tolls had remained unchanged

and would continue to be at those levels notwithstanding the costs of the regulated
activities. The CNE warned the Government that the insufficiency of fees was endangering
the economic financial sustainability of the electrical system.*** When Antin specifically
inquired with the government and the CNE about the Tariff Deficit, concerned that this

could entail retroactive changes to the economic regime applicable to CSP plants, it was
expressly told that the issue was not a problem.***

427. Moreover, Spain subsequently reduced the charges, one of the elements of the regulated

system revenues, in breach of Law 24/2013 and contributing to broadening the Tariff
Deficit** The contribution of CSP to the Tariff Deficit is very limited, and there were
other available measures that were less harmful for the Claimants’ investments, such as

introducing a tax on CO: emissions or raising electricity tariffs.**°

428. Second, a unilateral withdrawal by the State of the undertakings and assurances given in

good faith to the Claimants as an inducement for them to make an investment, including
an entire repeal of the RD 661/2007 regime, is by definition unreasonable and a breach of
the ECT.

429. Third, since the root cause for the Tariff Deficit was not the RD 661/2007 regime but

Spain’s failure to set regulated tariffs (network access tolls) at a level necessary for
covering the costs, the removal of said regime is not a reasonable response to addressing
the Tariff Deficit. In any event, since the contribution of CSP to the Tariff Deficit is very
limited, the measures cannot be said to be reasonably correlated to addressing Spain's
stated policy goal, or to have been enacted with due regard for the consequences imposed

on foreign investors such as the Claimants.**°

430. Concerning the third alleged justification, Spain contends that it changed the regulatory

regime applicable to CSP projects to protect consumers’ interests by avoiding further rises
in the cost of electricity and reducing the excessive burden they had to bear as a result of
the incentives granted by the Original Regime. To this regard, Spain argues that the
Claimants were receiving excessive or windfall profits. However, the Claimants were not
enjoying any profits beyond the reasonable rewards provided by the Original Regime.**”
Moreover, the stated object and purpose of the Disputed Measures was not to protect
consumers but to address the Tariff Deficit, for which purpose a modest increase in the
network access tolls would have sufficed.***

431. Spain’s claim is further not credible since it has imposed a high burden on consumers

through taxation on the consumption of electricity which is used to increase the funds of

the Spanish State.**? In any event, Spain’s desire to protect consumers by preventing a
remuneration higher than the reasonable is not a valid justification under the ECT or
international law. Spain intended to maintain artificially-low electricity costs by reneging
on its commitments to RE investors, for political purposes.°”°

432. Concerning the fourth alleged justification, Spain alleges that the disputed measures were

justified due to the economic crisis scenario, without raising a state of necessity defence.
However, Spain does not substantiate this claim nor explains precisely how any
unspecified economic difficulties justify the disputed measures. Spain is unreasonably
arguing that the Original Regime would only apply in times of economic prosperity, which
is not indicated anywhere in the legislation and is not what the Claimants relied upon.*”!

433. Finally, concerning the fifth alleged justification, the disputed measures were neither

adopted as a response to EU law nor required by it. First, EU law did not require Spain to
withdraw the RD 661/2007 regime, particularly with respect to facilities that were already
operating under that regime, since it is an established principle of European State aid law
that beneficiaries of an existing support scheme should be allowed to continue to rely upon
astable legal framework.*” Second, there is no indication whatsoever that the New Regime
was being put in place for this purpose.*”? And third, Spain’s failure to notify the Original
Regime to the EC, as it did with the New Regime, suggests that it believed such regime to
be in compliance with EU State aid rules. This is further supported by the fact that the
European Commission never saw fit to investigate or even criticize the Original Regime
for State aid, while criticizing Spain for the introduction of the Disputed Measures.°™*

 

  

e. Spain’s measures were disproportionate

434. For a measure to be proportionate there must be a reasonable relationship between the

burden imposed on the foreign investor and the aim sought by the measure. This test is not
satisfied in the present case.°°

435. First, since the contribution of CSP to the Tariff Deficit is limited, eliminating the

RD 661/2007 economic regime is not a suitable or proportionate solution to the problem.
Given the harmful effect of the measures on Antin’s investments, Spain’s actions are
entirely disproportionate. Second, a State’s measure is not proportionate unless it is

necessary to achieve the goals pursued, as upheld by the tribunal in AWG v. Argentina.”
Spain’s own organs recognized there were many other alternatives available that were less
harmful to investors. Therefore, Spain’s measures are not proportionate and breach the
FET standard.*

436. Spain alleges that the disputed measures are reasonable and proportionate since they
(i) guarantee a reasonable rate of return, and (ii) guarantee reimbursement for all the
operational costs and that no losses are incurred. However, the Disputed Measures do not
guarantee a reasonable rate of return, as explained above and, due to the high risks incurred
by the Claimants under the expectation that they would obtain reward, it is not enough for

them to simply recover operational costs.°”

2. Impairment of the Clai as_a_result_of un

measures

437. Article 10(1) of the ECT prohibits Spain from impairing investments by unreasonable or
discriminatory measures. As with FET, the standard of reasonableness requires Spain to
show that its measures were taken in pursuance of a rational policy goal and were carefully
tailored to achieve that goal. As explained above, the Disputed Measures do not fulfil these
conditions. Moreover, they have caused damages to the Claimants’ investments in the
amount of EUR 148 million. Therefore, in addition to a violation of the FET standard under
the ECT, Spain's actions violate the obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to refrain

from impairing Antin's investments through unreasonable measures.°°

3. Violation of the umbrella clause

438. Article 10(1) of the ECT establishes an umbrella clause by providing that “each
Contracting Party shall observe any obligations it has entered into with an Investor or an
Investment of an Investor of any other Contracting Party.” The obligations encompassed
under this broad provision may include contractual obligations, unilateral obligations,
legislation and government acts, and any host State laws or regulations relating to the
investor’s investment, as provided in the decisions of several previous tribunals.°°! Even
the legal authorities cited by Spain either confirm that umbrella clauses are not limited to

contractual obligations or refer to different discussions, such as the distinction between
contract claims and treaty claims, which is not relevant in the case at hand.”

439. Spain expressly recognized the application of the FIT to the Andasol Companies for all the

electricity produced by the Andasol Plants and for the entire operational lifetime of the
installations pursuant to RD 661/2007 (particularly Article 44(3)) and RD 1614/2010
(particularly Article 4), and further confirmed its regulatory undertakings in direct
discussions with Antin. These clear and specific commitments are binding obligations on
Spain towards the Claimants, which Spain must honour. However, Spain breached said
obligations by introducing legislation departing from those commitments, and thus
breached the umbrella clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT.°°

B. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

1. Spain has respected the standard of FET of Article 10(1) of the ECT

440. The Claimants’ legitimate expectations under the ECT do not include the freezing or

impossibility to modify the RD 661/2007 regime. There is no stabilization clause in this
sense in Spanish law, and specifically in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007.% As stated by the
tribunal in Charanne v. Spain,®® this provision contains no specific commitment to
stability, and the registration of the Andasol Plants in the RAIPRE cannot create any
expectations towards the stability of the Original Regime. Article 4 of RD 1614/2010
does not confirm the immutability of RD 661/2007, since its literal wording demonstrates
that it simply extends the provisions of Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 to plants not covered
by the latter.%’ Further, RD 1614/2010 itself entailed a reduction of profitability of CSP
plants in order to ensure the economic sustainability of the SES and the principle of
reasonable return, and Spain adopted measures resulting in a reduction in the profitability
of CSP facilities after the entry into force of RD 1614/2010 but before Claimants’

investments.°*

441. The SES only guarantees the right to obtain a “reasonable rate of return” to certain

the possibility that the RD 661/2007 economic regime could be modified.*” Spanish
legislation has always maintained a clear support to Special Regime energy production,
but what must be analysed under the FET standard is whether the “right to a reasonable
return” principle has been respected, as it in fact has.°!° For this purpose, RD 661/2007 and
RD 1614/2010 cannot be analysed, as Claimants intend, as an independent regulatory
framework, but must rather be interpreted in the context of the entire regulatory framework
of the SES, particularly the principle of economic sustainability, and in the light of
Supreme Court precedent, which complements such framework.*!!

442. Moreover, under Spanish law, the principle of hierarchy of rules provides that regulations

issued in development of a law cannot contradict the provisions of such law. Such is the
case with the SES: RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010 cannot contradict or nullify the
provisions of Law 54/1997, and therefore the provisions of this law must be taken into
account when interpreting such two decrees.°'? Particularly, RD 661/2007 and
RD 1614/2010 cannot be understood to be contrary to (i) the obligation to set out
reasonable rates of return with reference to the cost of money on the capital market, and
(ii) the principle of sustainability of the SES, set out in Law 54/1997.53

a. Object and purpose of the ECT

443. Article 10(1) of the ECT obliges States to grant investors only the minimum standard of

protection guaranteed by international law. The maximum aspiration a foreign investor can
thus have under the ECT is to receive national treatment, in case that treatment is more
favourable than said minimum standard of protection. This is so because the main objective
of the ECT is to achieve non-discrimination.°'+ However, there is no obligation under the
ECT for States to grant national treatment to foreign investors regarding programs that

provide grants or other financial assistance.°!*

444. The fact that the ECT limits regulatory risks does not entail that the State’s regulatory

powers regarding macroeconomic control are blocked.°'® Moreover, contrary to the
Claimants’ position, the ECT does not establish that the way to achieve its objectives is
requiring Contracting Parties to maintain a stable, predictable and transparent legal and
regulatory framework for investments. It is not true that the latitude of regulatory action

accorded to the States under the ECT is extremely limited, and the ECT does not prevent
the adoption by States of macroeconomic control measures, even if this entails loss of
profits by investors.°!’ The ECT sets no more limits on the regulatory power of States than
the minimum standard of international law, and this standard has not been breached by
Spain.*!*

b. No legitimate expectation of the Claimants has been violated.

445. To establish whether there has been a violation of the FET standard, the expectations the

Claimants had at the moment of making their investments regarding the treatment of said
investments must be considered. Such expectations must be reasonable and legitimate in
light of the existing regulatory framework. In this sense, previous tribunals®!” have stated
that, at the moment of undertaking an investment, an investor must know and understand
the applicable existing regulatory framework, including the potential risks. In the case at
hand, the Claimants had total knowledge of several issues that will be explained below.®”°

446. Therefore, in order for legitimate expectations under the ECT to exist regarding the

immutability of the regulatory framework, (i) specific commitments must have been made
to an investor that the regulation in force is going to remain immutable; (ii) the investor’s
expectations must be reasonable and justified in relation to any changes in the laws of the
host country; (iii) a comprehensive analysis of the applicable regulatory framework must
have been completed; and (iv) the investor must consider the due diligence exercised and
the circumstances surrounding its investment, and structure the investment so as to adapt
to potential changes of the legal framework that may be anticipated.‘?! For this purpose,
contrary to the Claimants’ allegations, Spanish law may not be ignored, since it is a
fundamental fact in order to determine the creation and scope of the rights invoked by the
Claimants and the expectations that may have arisen after making their investment.
Supreme Court case-law is highly relevant for this purpose.©

447. In addition to the Spanish regulatory framework, the circumstances surrounding the

620
621

623

investment should also be considered to determine whether an investor could or should
have reasonably anticipated that the applicable regulatory framework could change.

448. As will be explained below, Spain has made no promises or specific commitments

favouring the Claimants or any investors, and therefore the existing regulatory framework
could not create a legitimate expectation for the Claimants on the future immutability of
the remuneration system established under RD 661/2007.°™ This position has been adopted
by several tribunals which have nuanced and corrected the strict position established by
the tribunal in Tecmed v. Mexico, recognizing the existence of certain circumstances that
require States to justifiably adopt legislative measures.°”°

(i) | Reasonable return is the cornerstone of the remuneration system for the
production of energy from renewable sources

449. As mentioned above, the applicable regulatory framework is not limited to RD 661/2007

and RD 1614/2010. To the contrary, these regulations are only a part of the broader
regulatory framework of the SES, which includes Law 54/1997, all regulations issued
under this law and Supreme Court jurisprudence regarding thereto. To this regard, it must
be taken into account that the SES is an interconnected legal, economic and technical
system for the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity, created to
ensure that a power supply will be maintained under conditions that are affordable for
consumers and that supply is sustainable in the long term.°”°

450. The principle of economic sustainability of the SES involves the technical, environmental

and financial viability of the SES. Pursuant to Law 54/1997, RE producers, as part of the
SES, are also subject to this general principle, and the subsidies granted within the Special
Regime are a cost of the SES.’ Hence, these subsidies required detailed planning, which
is developed through renewable energy plans where a reasonable level of profitability is
determined based upon a specific scenario of foreseeable electricity demand.

451. RD 661/2007 was issued based upon the economic scenario set-forth in the 2005-2010

624

626

28

Plan. Therefore, if-as happened in Spain between 2009 and 2013, a major alteration
occurred regarding such economic scenario, no investor could have held the expectation
that the subsidies established in RD 661/2007, which constituted costs of the SES, would
remain petrified.°** This was expressly recognized by the Supreme Court, which
jurisprudence plays an essential role as precedent, complementing the Spanish legal system

and therefore should be taken into account as a fact by the Tribunal in determining the

existence of any legitimate expectations held by investors.°?

452. Considering the above, pursuant to Law 54/1997 and repeated Supreme Court

jurisprudence, the only legitimate expectation the Claimants could have, was to obtain a
reasonable return, since this principle is the cornerstone of the remuneration system for RE
producers within the general framework of the SES.°°

453. This principle entails that (i) Special Regime producers have the right to obtain

profitability, that is, recover the amounts invested and the operating costs and obtain an
industrial profit; (ii) such industrial profit must be reasonable, i.e. not disproportionate or
irrational; and (iii) reasonableness must be assessed with reference to the cost of money on
the capital market.°*' Rather than establishing a specific figure as reasonable return,
Law 54/1997 established two limits for Special Regime remuneration: (i) that receiving
the market price plus a subsidy allowed producers to obtain a reasonable return, and (ii)
that such subsidies were contingent upon the economic sustainability of the SES.°*

454. Due to its dynamic nature, reasonable return is an end that can be achieved in various ways.

Therefore, the Special Regime does not guarantee a determined level of profits or revenues,
nor the invariability of the formulas used to set the premiums.** The dynamic nature of
the principle of reasonable return is imposed by the wording of Article 30(4) of
Law 54/1997, which establishes the cost of money on the capital market as the benchmark
for determining the reasonability of a determined profit level,°** and it has been further
confirmed by Supreme Court decisions and acknowledged by the tribunal in Charanne v.
Spain.

455. This is in line with the expectations of Spanish companies, and particularly Iberdrola

629

630

632

which, contrary to the Claimants’ assertions, understood that the only legitimate
expectation of investors in the RE sector was to a reasonable return.*° Such was also the
case with Protermosolar, an association of the Spanish solar thermal industry, which knew
and expressly invoked the principle of reasonable return while RD 661/2007 was still in
force.’ Moreover, the reports issued by Péyry further informed the Claimants that the

Government could potentially adopt regulatory amendments that could affect them in order
to tackle the Tariff Deficit, and the Claimants themselves admitted that the reduction of
Special Regime subsidies was one of the measures the Government could adopt in order
to tackle the Tariff Deficit. °**

456. As explained above, the 2005-2010 Plan is essential to understanding the setting of the

reasonable return established in RD 661/2007, as required by Law 54/1997 and further
confirmed by the fact that RD 661/2007 itself links its content to the 2005-2010 Plan.°*?
The 2005-2010 Plan establishes a profitability target by reference to a standardized facility,
established for CSP projects at approximately 7%, to which the premiums granted should
be subject. This rate is set according to the standard costs of a standardized facility and its
operating and maintenance costs, rather than based upon the individual costs of each
investor. It is in accordance with this system that the profitability target to which the
subsidies deriving from RD 661/2007 aimed was set, therefore guaranteeing, contrary to
the Claimants’ allegations, a reasonable return on a fixed cost target rather than a particular
FIT.%*!

(ii) | The Claimants knew that the legal principle of “reasonable return” admits
changes both in the way of setting support subsidies for renewable energies
and in the amounts of such subsidies

457. During their due diligence process, Claimants had been warned and were fully aware of

the possibility of future regulatory changes affecting their investments, including the
reduction of Special Regime subsidies.”
classified the possibility of a regulatory change in Spain as “medium” during its June 2011
meeting.“ This assessment, however, was mitigated because of two circumstances: first,
the belief that the permanence of ACS as a shareholder in the Andasol Companies would
provide regulatory insurance due to its lobby power and, second, a wrong legal evaluation
of the Spanish regulatory framework.“

The Claimants’ Investment Committee itself

458. Regarding the first issue, the Claimants could not have any legitimate expectations that

ACS’s lobby power could help maintain an unbalanced situation caused by the generous
subsidies granted to renewable energy producers in detriment of Spanish consumers, and

of the SES in general. In that sense, despite said lobby power, the Government adopted the

measures it considered necessary to protect the SES and the Spanish consumers.°*5

459. Concerning the second issue, the Claimants’ legal evaluation of the Spanish regulatory

framework came from two sources: the legal report prepared by Herbert Smith and certain
ambiguous subjective conclusions obtained by representatives of the Claimants during
informal meetings held at the Ministry. No expectations can be derived from these two
sources. The Claimants allege that Herbert Smith’s memorandum states, regarding Article
4 of RD 1614/2010, that “[t]his is the first time that Spanish legislation on renewable
energy has established a provision affording this level of protection.” However, such
statement is not justified in the memorandum and does not correspond to the truth, since
every regulatory norm developing the principle of reasonable return enacted since 2004
has introduced similar provisions.°°

460. Moreover, this statement does not correspond with the literal wording or with the purpose

of Article 4 of RD 1614/2010, which simply extended the provisions of Article 44(3) of
RD 661/2007 to plants not covered by it.” This, since RDL 6/2009 provided for a gradual
initiation of operation of CSP plants until 2013, and a literal interpretation of Article 44(3)
of RD 661/2007 led to the possibility that plants entering into operation after 1 January
2011 could be affected by the revision of the applicable regime to take place in 2010.
Therefore, the purpose of Article 4 of RD 1614/2010 was not to give broader protection to
plants, but to correct unintended inefficiencies in the application of RDL 6/2009.°*

461. Additionally, the Claimants were aware of the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court

regarding the scope and content of the principle of reasonable return, which clearly
evidences the mistake committed by Herbert Smith’s report when asserting “the
untouchability of the regulated tariff and the caps and floors.”°? Supreme Court case-law
is a key component of the RE regulatory framework and no investor in Spain can expect
to have any expectations on an interpretation that disagrees with the one previously
established by the Supreme Court in a consolidated manner.°°

462. The Claimants further rely on “specific guarantees given by Spanish public workers” to

645

justify their legitimate expectations on the immutability of the RD 661/2007 regime.
However, their only source for such expectations is an email with subjective conclusions
proposed by an attendant to a meeting with a State attorney of the Ministry, from which no

legitimate expectation can be derived.*! The email’s content is so ambiguous that
extracting a conclusion from it would be naive. Even if the statements of the public worker
do correspond to the content of the email, such workers are not formal representatives of
the Government and their opinions cannot be considered as guarantees made by the State.
In any event, the public worker allegedly explained that the Government can modify the
received remuneration as long as such change does not prevent the investor from obtaining
a reasonable return on the investment.°*

463. A commitment to petrify the legal system in the sense alleged by the Claimants would

require a review of the legal principle of reasonable return, which could only be undertaken
by means of a law. Since a legitimate expectation cannot be generated by individuals
lacking the capacity to comply with their statements, a State attorney cannot create
legitimate expectations regarding the Ministry’s goals or other regulatory functions
corresponding to the Ministry, and specifically regarding the petrification of remuneration
under RD 661/2007.°* Moreover, statements contradicting the legal system of the State
receiving the investment cannot be granted any value. Such is the case for statements that
directly contradict the principle of reasonable return and the jurisprudence of the Supreme
Court.

(iii) The Claimants knew that the principle of reasonable return requires the
maintenance of a necessary balance between remunerations to be received by
producers and the sacrifice they imply to consumers

464. The Claimants were familiar with the functioning and objectives of the SES. Hence, they

must have been aware that there must be a balance between the return they can expect,
which must be reasonable, and the cost this entails for consumers, as set forth in the
preambles of RD 436/2004 and RD 661/2007 and confirmed by the 2005-2010 Plan.
Therefore, the Claimants should have foreseen that the Government could not shelter
situations of economic imbalance in the system and would therefore maintain continued
scrutiny over the applicable economic regime. °°

465. The Claimants were aware that the Government had already adopted measures to eliminate

the imbalance created by other technologies, such as the PV sector, in order to ensure a
reasonable return for the facilities. These measures were backed by the Supreme Court.
Despite these warnings, the Claimants designed and undertook a speculative investment

based exclusively on the generosity of the existing subsidies, as revealed by the return
predictions set out by the Claimants.°”

466. Moreover, the Claimants were fully aware of the imbalance created by the subsidies and

knew the regulator would act when this situation was discovered, but erroneously assumed
they would be protected by the lobby power of certain companies in Spain. Therefore, the
Claimants could not expect their purely speculative investment model to be perpetuated by
a regulated system based on the principle of reasonable return.°*

467. Inresponse to the existing imbalance in the solar thermal energy sector, Spain first adopted

measures under the existing subvention model and then established a New Regime that
solved the problem. The regulatory changes adopted by Spain regarding the Special
Regime responded to either situations of over-remuneration that needed to be corrected or
to strong alterations of the economic data that served as the basis for the initial
determination of the amount of the Premium, in accordance with the 2005-2010 Plan, as
explained above.*? However, all measures respected the only legitimate expectation the
Claimants could have: maintaining a reasonable rate of return on their investments.°

468. On the one hand, two measures were first adopted under the existing subvention model.

First, through RDL 2/2013, remunerations, fees and premiums from the electrical sector
that were linked to the CPI were subsequently linked to the CPI at constant taxes without
considering non-elaborated food or energy products.*' As acknowledged by the Supreme
Court, price indexes used in the regulation of the energy sector do not have to remain
inalterable through time, and the use of consumer price indexes subjacent to constant taxes
is widely accepted in the global economic doctrine. The methodological change introduced
by RDL 2/2013 responds, in general, to the usual consumption price indexes calculation
standards in the global economy, and its purpose is to avoid distortions in the consumption
price index that are unrelated to the bases of the economy. Moreover, the measure has even
been beneficial for plants in certain periods in which the adjusted CPI has surpassed the
CPI.

469. The adoption of adjusted CPI was further justified by the distortion caused to CPI as a

consequence of the introduction of important tax increases through RDL 20/2012,°° and

it had been previously proposed by the CNE.°* Moreover, since only an insignificant part

sector in Spain, and it is proportional to the goals it intends to achieve.°

470. Second, by means of RDL 2/2013, the sum of the premium available in the Premium option

existing under the RD 661/2007 regime was reduced to a value of EUR 0. The object of
this measure was to guarantee a reasonable rate of return for facilities and at the same time
avoid an over remuneration that would revert on the rest of the system, taking into account
the evolution of the economic scenario under which the Premium option had been
introduced. The Premium option had already been criticized by the CNE in its report of 7
March 2012, alleging it should be reduced.°”

471. The adoption of this measure did not affect the Claimants’ expectations of obtaining a

reasonable rate of return for their investment, since all of their financial studies were
developed based on the option of the regulated tariff, rather than on the Premium option.**
Moreover, before RDL 2/2012 was enacted, not all renewable technologies had access to
the Premium option, and RD 1614/2010 had temporarily suspended this option for solar
thermal technology itself.5°

472. On the other hand, after the adoption in 2012 of the two partial measures described above,

a new remuneration model had to be adopted to comply with European regulations,
particularly with the prohibition to grant State aid imposed by the TFEU.°” Additionally,
the new model had to be adapted to comply also with the internal Spanish legal system,
and particularly with the principle of reasonable return.*7!

474. This reform was based on the criterion that had historically motivated the different
regulatory changes in Spain: costs incurred by investors. However, its novelty is the
limitation of the costs that will be recoverable through the subsidy, through the concept of

in “efficient and well-managed company”, to prevent consumers from paying the high
costs borne by an inefficient company.°” Since 83% of the Claimants’ income would come
from direct contributions from Spanish consumers, it is in accordance with any investor’s
expectations that efficiency and good management are required from him. With such
purpose, the investment and operation costs of an efficient and well-managed company
were determined, resulting in the assignment of a reasonable return at a rate of 7,398% on
the totality of the project per facility type. The remuneration obtained will therefore depend
on the efficiency of the investor.“

475. Likewise, the plant’s regulatory lifetime is established to avoid the granting of subventions
for a period that exceeds the plant’s useful life. This measure does not prevent the investor
from recovering its investment and obtaining a return of 7.398% or higher during said
regulatory lifetime.°”

476. In conclusion, the New Regime has not affected any expectations, since the provision of a
reasonable return based on investment costs continues to be a fundamental element. The
fact that the costs and investments on which the New Regime is based are those of an
efficient and well-managed company cannot be deemed to harm any expectation.”

(iv) The Claimants knew that the “reasonable return” extends exclusively to the
investment undertaken in the plants

477. The Claimants knew that a reasonable return was granted exclusively to funds used in the
construction of plants, while funds used for the acquisition of existing assets in the form of
premiums have never been covered by said principle.*”’ Such exclusions arise both from
the regulatory framework and from the funding agreement concluded between Andasol-2
Central Termosolar Dos, S.A. and certain credit entities from the year 2006. Therefore, the
Claimants were aware that the “reasonable return” guaranteed did not extend to the
premiums paid by them to the companies selling the plants, nor to the capital gains that
Antin intended to obtain through the operation. *

478. The decision to build the Andasol Plants was adopted before the entrance into force of RD

661/2007 and their funding was obtained under the validity of RD 436/2004, which
allowed for the recovery of the sums invested in the development of the project and of the
operation costs of the plants, while also allowing the investor to obtain a reasonable return.
However, RD 436/2004 did not allow for the recovery of premiums paid for the acquisition
of already existing plants. The Claimants were aware of this, and they nevertheless require
in this arbitration the reimbursement of 100% of the funding contribution paid to ACS and
its subsidiaries for the acquisition of the assets.°”

(v) The Claimants knew that there could be changes in the application of the
subsidized regime to energy production with gas

479. At the time of undertaking their investment, the Claimants knew that there could be

changes in the application of the subsidized regime to energy produced with gas in solar
thermal plants, as evidenced by several documents.°*° This assessment stems from a correct
understanding of the legal regime applicable at the time. In fact, the use of gas in the
production of renewable energy under the Special Regime, a possibility that was
introduced by RD 436/2004, has always been limited to those cases meeting two
circumstances: that it is necessary to compensate the lack of solar radiation and that the
lack of gas usage might affect the foreseen energy delivery. Such limitations exist under
the RD 661/2007 regime.**!

480. This regulation was introduced at a time when the implementation of solar thermal

technology facilities was beginning, and their promotion and development advised
promoting the use of this technology in optimum conditions.**? However, in 2012, in light
of the need of a comprehensive reform to the energy sector, the CNE pointed out the
problem of incentivizing the production of energy from fossil fuels under the protection of
renewable energies, when the ultimate purpose was promoting energy supply security,
reducing dependence from fossil fuels and guaranteeing the protection of the
environment. This purpose was enshrined in the preamble of Law 15/2012 and is
consistent with EU guidelines on the issue, under which only the electricity produced from
RE sources shall be taken into account for calculating the RE implementation targets
created by EU law. The Claimants could not have any expectations to the contrary.°

481. Law 24/2013 also followed this path. However, the lack of any premium remuneration of
renewable energies produced with the use of gas does not mean that the use of this fuel in
the process of energy generation does not receive any economic compensation.**> Such use
of gas has been considered in the estimation of costs of each facility type under the New
Regime, as developed in Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014. Likewise, the larger investment
costs incurred by an investor to allow the use of gas in a facility have been considered in
establishing the investment cost of the corresponding facility type.°*°

c Spain has complied with the commitment to establish a stable and
predictable regulatory regime

482. The Claimants confuse the stability of the economic regime with the unaltered maintenance
of the specific tariffs set forth under the RD 661/2007 regime. However, the guarantee of
stable conditions under the FET standard does not entail a right to the freezing of States’
legislation nor is it equivalent to a stability clause, and regulatory amendments that are
reasonable in light of the circumstances or respect the investment’s economic balance,
guaranteeing a reasonable rate of return, do not result in a violation of this standard.
Previous tribunals have supported this position.°*”

483. Contrary to the Claimants’ allegations, the relevant regulatory framework cannot be
limited to two specific regulations, and the assessment of the adopted measures must be
made in accordance with the entire regulatory framework. This includes Law 54/1997,
which stated the principle of reasonable return, and case law interpreting this principle.°*
Therefore, any analysis regarding this issue must consider that, throughout Spanish
regulatory history, the cornerstone of the system has been the principle of reasonable return
on investments, which must be respected by the specific remuneration regimes established.
Since all changes in the Spanish legal system have sought precisely to underpin and apply
this same principle, no instability can be alleged. Consequently, the subvention regime to
renewable energies has always kept its essence: guaranteeing the investor a reasonable
return on investment costs.”

484. Moreover, no retroactive measures have been adopted. For a regulation to be retroactive it
must affect acquired rights, and the Claimants never had an acquired right regarding a
future fixed and unchanging FIT that was not subject to potential macroeconomic control

measures or reforms of the SES.° Rather than retroactively affecting rights already
acquired, RDL 9/2013 applies only to future events, and hence it cannot be considered a
retroactive measure.®! Both international? and Spanish precedent confirm this view.°>

d. The conduct of Spain has been transparent

485. The Claimants allege that Spain has not acted in a transparent manner since (i) it dismantled

the RD 661/2007 regime in a manner that was not transparent, and (ii) it has not offered
any guidelines on many key aspects of the New Regime and has denied access to the reports
issued by Roland Berger and Boston Consulting Group regarding remuneration
parameters. This is false. The need for a reform to the Spanish electrical sector was
announced and publicly explained several years before its implementation, as have been
the announcements of a new law for such purpose and the general features of said reform,
basically intended to correct and eliminate the Tariff Deficit and its causes.°*

486. The development of legal regulations has also been transparent. Even if the enactment of

RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 has extended in time due to
requirements set forth in Spanish law, this process has been transparent and open to
opinions from all interested parties.°* Drafts were circulated before their enactment, and
the Claimants were already familiar with them four months after the publication of RDL
9/2013.°°

487. Regarding the reports issued by Boston Consulting Group and Roland Berger, the first one

was never received given that the corresponding contract was terminated by Spain due to
performance failures, and the second one was received by the Government after the
enactment of both RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014. Thus, it was not
requested before the development of the parameters included in Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014.7

488. The Claimants claim that the New Regime is unstable due to the existence of different

regulatory periods. However, since these periods are perfectly delimited, they constitute an
element of security for the investor, especially given that Law 24/2013 establishes that
neither the investment value nor the regulatory useful life of a plant can be modified. Such

periods include updating parameters to maintain a reasonable return for investors and they
do not necessarily entail a decrease in the parameters currently set. Contrary to the
Claimants’ allegations, both Law 24/2013 and RD 413/2014 include specific and concrete
measures determining the methodology used for determining the applicable parameters.°”*
The remuneration period system guarantees the attainment of a reasonable return for
investors, and the standards included therein enable determining when such reasonable
return has been obtained.°”

489. Finally, the Claimants argue that there has been uncertainty regarding the reception of

income during the time elapsed before the approval of the applicable regulation, namely
RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET 1045/2014. However, the system has never
stopped fulfilling its obligations, and RDL 9/2013 clearly established remuneration
regulations. Afterwards, the Government has progressively paid the sums corresponding
to facilities benefitted by the New Regime, and those who received funds in excess have
returned such excess. The Claimants have not proven any damages suffered due to this
procedure nor claimed any sums regarding remuneration received for energy produced
prior to 14 July 2013.7”

e. The measures of Spain have been reasonable

arbitrariness or discriminatory nature of its actions, since (i) the measures served a
legitimate purpose, since they intended to prevent Spanish consumers from paying

guaranteed by law; (ii) the reform has fully respected existing legal regulations and the
jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, underpinning the principle of reasonable return, and
is not discriminatory regarding any investors; (iii) the reasons for the adoption of the reform
were clearly exposed by the President since 2011; and (iv) Spain has fully complied with
the formally applicable procedures.” This test is especially relevant since the main

objective of the ECT is to ensure the principle of national treatment or non-
discrimination.”

492. Second, Spain complied with the test set forth in AES SUMMIT v. Hungary” for

determining whether a measure is reasonable and in compliance with the FET standard set
forth in the ECT. According to this test, for a measure to be reasonable (i) it must respond
to a rational policy, i.e., it must have been adopted with the aim of addressing a public
interest matter, and (ii) it must be reasonable, which means there must be an appropriate

correlation between the State’s public policy objective and the measure adopted to achieve
it.79°

493. Regarding the first element, Spain intended to correct the imbalance that existed due to an

excessive remuneration of investors which, besides creating an excessive charge for
Spanish consumers, was contributing to the generation of Tariff Deficit, in the context of
an acute economic crisis that affected the economy as a whole.””’ This is a valid rational
public policy according to the criteria established in AES Summit v. Hungary.”* Absent a
regulatory reform, the increase in costs for the SES arising from the CSP sector would have
been exponential in 2014. This increase was the one the disputed measures intended to
prevent, and therefore the Claimants’ figures regarding 2012 costs, when the CSP sector
had phased its entry into operation, are not relevant.” Moreover, the existence of an
economic crisis and the difficulty of obtaining international financing also forced Spain to

adopt several macroeconomic control measures in different sectors, including energy.’!°

494. In this context, the rational policy was to amend the regulatory framework to protect

consumers, rather than raising rates for consumers, which would have led to less energy
consumption and further aggravation of the Tariff Deficit. Likewise, raising taxes on fuels
as proposed by the Claimants is a measure that has no support and would not be feasible

in the circumstances.”!!

495. Regarding the second element, the reform had an impact on all persons integrating the SES,

™m

seeking to raise income and reduce SES costs to cope with the Tariff Deficit. From the
perspective of producers, the measures are equally proportionate, since they can still obtain

a reasonable return of 7.398% on their investment while the existing imbalance is
corrected.”

496. Third, Spain complied with the test established in Total v. Argentina’? regarding respect

towards the economic balance of the investment. The tribunal in that case established that,
for sectors requiring long-term investments that involve large sums of capital, any
modification by the State to the corresponding legal framework must be done in a way that
allows the investor to recover its operational costs, amortize its investment and obtain a
reasonable rate of return during such period of time.’ The tribunal in this test ruled on the
basis of the minimum standard of protection guaranteed by international law, the same one
granted by the ECT, and therefore this case is relevant for the present analysis.’!°

497. The New Regime allows for investors to recover their operation costs, amortize their

investments and obtain a reasonable return over time. The costs necessary for the electrical
generation activity to be performed in an efficient and well-managed manner, which are
listed (in a non-exhaustive manner) in the preamble of Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014,
are remunerated; in case revenue from energy sales does not cover operation costs, these
are complemented with a compensation to the operation, so that the result of income minus
expenses is at least equal to zero every year. This guarantees remuneration to the
investment that allows recovering such investment during the regulatory useful lifetime of

the plant.7!°

498. Additionally, this system also guarantees a reasonable return of 7.398% on the undertaken

investment from the commissioning of the facility and until the end of its regulatory useful
lifetime. This return rate is reasonable, determined objectively and not modifiable until six
years after the coming into force of RDL 9/2013.7!”

499. Because of the above, the disputed measures do not breach the FET standard established

in the ECT.

2. Inexistence of an umbrella clause

10(1) of the ECT. This subparagraph refers to obligations that the State has “entered into”
with an investor or an investment, which clearly refer to concrete, specific, bilateral

obligations assumed by the State regarding an investor through an express, concluding,
unequivocal and individualized commitment that cannot normally be thought of except by
signing a contract. This leaves outside the scope of said subparagraph cases in which States
assume binding obligations through unilateral acts.”!* This interpretation is further
confirmed by the Reader’s Guide of the ECT,”'’which in explaining the last subparagraph
of Article 10(1) of the ECT refers specifically to “contracts”.””°

501. However, the Claimants interpret the words “any obligation” as including within its scope

not only contractual obligations, but also legislative or regulatory commitments. Thus, the
Claimants intend to include the erga omnes provisions of a Royal Decree as specific
commitments adopted towards them.”*! This interpretation ignores the essence of the
umbrella clause itself and would mean that States would renounce to their legislative
powers, which was not the intention of the ECT signatory States.”

502. In all the LG&E v. Argentina, Enron v. Argentina and Sempra v. Argentina cases quoted

by the Claimants there was a previous contractual link between the claimants and the State,
and therefore the State’s obligations arose from such contracts rather than from the law.
Regulatory changes were only analysed in those cases to determine the extent to which
previously assumed contracted obligations had been breached by the State.’”3

503. Therefore, for a claimant to invoke the application of an umbrella clause, it must

demonstrate the essential prerequisite for the application of such clauses: a consensual
relationship through which the State has assumed a specific obligation, which it must
legally respect, regarding that specific investor. Regulations, due to their nature, do not
create such vis-d-vis relationships.”** Neither does the press release of the Government
dated 2 July 2010 nor the conversations held by Antin with the representatives of the
Ministry and the CNE.”° Therefore, the Claimants cannot validly invoke the umbrella
clause on their behalf.

504. Additionally, umbrella clauses do not alter the nature or the content of the invoked

718

obligation. Therefore, demonstrating the existence of a legal obligation is not enough to
invoke such a clause; it is also necessary to demonstrate which is the applicable domestic

law and, additionally, whether there has been any failure to comply with such an obligation
that is attributable to the State according to such national law. However, the Claimants do
not make any allegations regarding these issues.’”°

505. To this regard, the Supreme Court has stated that no statutory provision can establish the

intangibility of a certain level of specific benefits nor the indefinite permanence of the
formulas used for such purpose. Therefore, the obligation that the Claimants want to raise
to the international field by virtue of the umbrella clause does not even exist in Spanish

law.727

506. Jn arguendo, even in the event Spain had assumed any specific compromises with the

Andasol Plants, that commitment would be limited to applying the existing legal regime in
its entirety rather than applying two single articles of two specific regulations. In this
regard, the only obligation Spanish law has created in favour of RE producers is to obtain
a reasonable return for their investment at all times, and this is guaranteed by the New
Regime.”** Therefore, an umbrella clause in Article 10(1) of the ECT would still have been
respected by Spain.’

507. Finally, not any breach of any obligation entails a violation of an umbrella clause. A breach

of a contractual obligation would only entail a violation of an investment treaty if such a
breach implied a violation of the substantive standards of the treaty. In the case at hand,
the FET standard has been fully respected by Spain, and therefore an umbrella clause has

not been breached.”*°

Spain’s conduct was conducive to the provision of a stable, transparent legal framework

sector where a substantial amount of capital is typically committed at the outset in order to
produce a long-term return.”>

509. The Claimants claim that they invested in Spain in reliance of the regulatory framework

set forth under RD 661/2007 —as reinforced by RD 1614/2010—, which was purposely
designed to attract foreign investment in Spain’s RE sector.”** Specifically, the Claimants
expected that because the Andasol Plants complied with all the registration requirements,
they would be subject to the FIT regime for their entire operational life.”*° Relying on
Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007, the Claimants further expected that any future changes to
RD 661/2007 would apply only to new installations, while existing installations —such as

the Andasol Plants— would remain unaffected.”*°

510. The Claimants further claim that their expectations regarding the stability of the

RD 661/2007 economic regime —and specifically of the FIT— were legitimate, as they
were based on an offer made by the Spanish Government under a “royal decree”
(RD 661/2007) which sought to encourage investments in the capital-intensive RE sector
by providing the necessary incentives to attract investors.’ The Claimants’ own due
diligence process, Respondent’s campaign to promote investments in the Spanish RE
sector, the adoption of RD 1614/2010 implementing the July 2010 Agreement and specific
assurances made by Spain’s public officials that the RD 661/2007 would not be materially

altered, all confirm that the Claimants’ expectations were legitimate.”**

511. It is the Claimants’ case that notwithstanding these specific compromises, Respondent

m3

nM

eviscerated all the key features of the RD 661/2007 regime thereby frustrating the
Claimants’ legitimate expectations and breaching its obligation to provide FET under the
ECT.” In particular, Spain (i) withdrew the FIT for electricity production using natural
gas under Law 15/2012 and then capped the use of natural gas for essential technical
purposes though Ministerial Order IET/1882/2014;"° (ii) introduced the TVPEE which
constitutes a disguised and unjustified cut of the FIT;™! (iii) eliminated the Premium
through RDL 2/2013;” (iv) replaced the CPI-linked updating mechanism for the FIT by
a lower index also through RDL 2/2013; and finally, (v) eliminated the RD 661/2007

economic regime in its entirety through RDL 9/2013 and introduced a substantially less
favourable regime without FIT.™

512. The Respondent contends that it has not breached the FET standard under Article 10(1) of

the ECT. While agreeing that the ECT must be interpreted in accordance with Article 31
of the VCLT™ and recognizing that it provides a level of protection that limits the
regulatory power of the signatory States,”° the Respondent submits that the ECT neither
cancels nor extremely curtails the State’s regulatory power.” According to Spain, the ECT
sets no more limits on the regulatory power of States than the minimum standard of
international law, and this standard has not been breached by Spain.”**

513. Regarding the Claimants’ allegation that Spain frustrated their legitimate expectations, the

Respondent submits that the Claimants’ expectations were neither legitimate nor protected
by the ECT. The Respondent argues that the Claimants could not reasonably expect that
the RD 661/2007 regime remained frozen or unmodified. There is no stabilisation clause
in this sense in Spanish law, and specifically in Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007,”° and Spain
did not make any promises or commitments to the Claimants as to the immutability of the

regime.’°°

514. Moreover, the Respondent asserts that when the Claimants made their investment in Spain,

they were fully aware of the possibility of future regulatory changes affecting their
investments.”*! It also states that the Claimants could not derive any expectations from the
HS Report, which was superficial and flawed,’? or from unverifiable representations
allegedly made by public officials lacking authority to bind Spain.”

515. According to the Respondent, the Claimants were only entitled to a reasonable return.

Thus, what must be analysed under the FET standard is whether the “right to a reasonable
return” principle has been respected.’** The Respondent affirms that the New Regime does

main piece.
516. The issues before this Tribunal concern the alleged breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT. In
its relevant part, this provision reads as follows:

“Each Contracting Party shall, in accordance with the provisions of
this Treaty, encourage and create stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to
make Investments in its Area. Such conditions shall include a
commitment to accord at all times to Investments of Investors of
other Contracting Parties fair and equitable treatment. [...]”

517. The Parties agree that Article 10(1) of the ECT must be interpreted in accordance with
Article 31 of the VCLT, which contains the general rule of customary international law for
the interpretation of treaties. The Tribunal has already set the criteria for the application of
Article 31 of the VCLT in paragraph 207 supra.

518. The ordinary meaning of the words “fair” and “equitable” is commonly found in the
dictionary. According to the Oxford English Dictionary “fair” means “just, unbiased,
equitable, impartial, legitimate.”’°° In turn, “equitable” is defined as “characterised by
equity or fairness”, where “equity” means “fairness; impartiality; even-handed dealing.””*”

In Spanish, another official language of the ECT and the language of the Respondent, the

dictionary of the Spanish language of the Real Academia Espanola defines “fair” as “in

accordance with justice and reason””**

and “equitable” as “having equity”, i.e., “equality
of disposition”, and, more specifically, “disposition that moves to give each one what he
deserves.””*? These terms, however, cannot be interpreted in separation from the treaty’s

context, object and purpose.
519. Pursuant to Article 2 of the ECT, the purpose of the Treaty is to:

“{establish] a legal framework in order to promote long-term co-
operation in the energy field, based on complementarities and mutual

benefits, in accordance with the objectives and principles of the
[European Energy] Charter.”

520. As noted by the tribunal in Ziser v. Spain, the ECT’s stated purpose emphasises the
Treaty’s role in providing a legal framework that promotes long-term cooperation,
suggesting that the ECT is conceived as enhancing the stability required for such
cooperation.”

521. This is further confirmed by the objectives and principles of the European Energy Charter
(the “Charter”), a political declaration that formed the basis of the ECT and to which
Article 2 of the ECT expressly refers.

522. Title I of the Charter, labelled “objectives”, provides that the signatories will engage, inter
alia, in cooperation in the energy field, which entails the “formulation of stable and
transparent legal frameworks creating conditions for the development of energy
resources.””°! Similarly, Title II.4 of the Charter, which specifically deals with the
implementation of the Charter’s objectives regarding the promotion and protection of
investments, provides as follows:

“In order to promote the international flow of investments, the
signatories will at national level provide for a stable, transparent legal
framework for foreign investments, in conformity with the relevant
international laws and rules on investment and trade.

They affirm that it is important for the signatory States to negotiate
and ratify legally binding agreements on promotion and protection of
investments which ensure a high level of legal security and enable
the use of investment risk guarantee schemes.”

523. These provisions of the Charter thus confirm that the legal framework referred to in
Article 2 of the ECT is one that is stable, transparent, and compliant with international
legal standards. The Tribunal shall therefore observe the objectives of legal stability and
transparency in interpreting the FET standard under the ECT.

524. The stability of the legal regime is reinforced in the first sentence of Article 10(1) of the
ECT which requires that the Contracting Parties “encourage and create stable, equitable,

favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments in its Area.”

525. The Tribunal notes that the language of Article 10(1) of the ECT is not merely a suggestion

or a recommendation for the Contracting Parties. It provides that each Contracting Party
“shall, in accordance with the provisions of this Treaty, encourage and create stable,
equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties
to make Investments in its Area” (emphasis added). The modal verb “shall” expresses an
instruction, command or obligation’ and therefore, compliance with the ECT requires
that each Contracting State shall not only encourage but also create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make
Investments in its Area.

526. The Tribunal further notes that, as mentioned in the preceding paragraphs, the stability of

the conditions for Investors of other Contracting Parties to make Investments in another
Contracting Party’s Area is a /eitmotiv in the text of the ECT and is clearly reinforced in
the Charter.

527. The Parties disagree as to the scope and extent of the obligation contained in the ECT to

encourage and create stable conditions. The Claimants suggest that stability implies that
the regime contained in RD 661/2007 should have been maintained for the entire life of
operation of those plants that were already registered. The Respondent holds that stability
does not mean freezing the legal regime and that even though the ECT limits the regulatory
power of the signatory States, it neither cancels nor extremely curtails the State’s regulatory
power.” According to the Respondent, if it maintains a “reasonable rate of return”, the
obligation of stability is complied with.

528. As already indicated, and as the Parties agree, the ECT must be interpreted in accordance

with Article 31 of the VCLT. As regards the text, the term “stable” means “[n]ot likely to
change or fail; firmly established.””° In Spanish, “stable” is “something that is maintained
with no peril of changing, falling or disappearing.””® Stable, therefore, neither means
something close to immutable or something unlikely to change at any time.

529. Referring to the context, other arbitral tribunals interpreting Article 10(1) of the ECT have
concluded that stability is part of or is related to the FET standard under the Treaty. For
instance, the tribunal in Plama v. Bulgaria observed that “stable and equitable conditions
are clearly part of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT.” Similarly,
the tribunal in Electrabel v. Hungary asserted that “[flair and equitable treatment is
connected in the ECT to the encouragement to provide stable, equitable, favourable and
transparent conditions for investors.””°* Recent decisions in investment arbitration cases
under the ECT involving Spain endorse the same conclusion.”

530. Based on the text and context of the ECT, the Tribunal agrees with the Respondent in that
the ECT limits the regulatory power of the signatory States, but does not cancel or
“extremely limit” the State’s regulatory power.’”” However, the Tribunal does not agree
with Spain in that the ECT sets no more limits on the regulatory power of States than the
minimum standard of international law. The ECT provides for specific obligations to the
Contracting States regarding stability, and the FET standard of the ECT, as in the quote
provided by Respondent:

“requires a balancing process. Investment treaties as international
law disciplines interfere in domestic regulatory and administrative
sovereignty; that is their very purpose. They are meant to do so in
order to upgrade the quality of governance. But they must also not be
operated in order to become an excessively interventionist
instrument.”77!

531. As anticipated by the tribunal in Charanne v. Spain and reaffirmed by the tribunal in Ziser
v. Spain, the specific obligation of stability of the conditions for investors under the ECT
does not eliminate or strictly limit the regulatory powers of States nor does it prevent
Contracting States from amending existing regulations, provided that the given State does
not “suddenly and unexpectedly eliminate the essential features of the regulatory
framework in place.”””

532. In sum, considering the context, object and purpose of the ECT, the Tribunal concludes
that the obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT to provide FET to protected investments
comprises an obligation to afford fundamental stability in the essential characteristics of

the legal regime relied upon by the investors in making long-term investments.’” This does
not mean that the legal framework cannot evolve or that a State Party to the ECT is
precluded from exercising its regulatory powers to adapt the regime to the changing
circumstances in the public interest.’” It rather means that a regulatory regime specifically
created to induce investments in the energy sector cannot be radically altered —i.e.,
stripped of its key features— as applied to existing investments in ways that affect investors
who invested in reliance on those regimes.

533. The Tribunal deems it important to emphasize that the content and scope of the FET

standard must be assessed within the context of the Treaty in which it is found. Reference
to decisions on the stability of a regime based on treaties whose text is substantially
different and where no specific obligation of stability is contained may be of no assistance
in the interpretation of this specific feature of the ECT. Not only does the ECT expressly
state that its purpose is to provide a legal framework to promote long-term cooperation in
the energy field in accordance with the objectives and principles of the Charter —which
stresses the need for a stable and transparent legal framework,— it also contains a specific
obligation —as opposed to a mere declaration in the preamble, and with language that
suggests and imperative and not merely a recommendation— to encourage and create
stable conditions for investments. Regardless of how the relationship between stability of
the legal framework and the obligation to accord FET is conceived, it seems clear that, in
the context of the ECT, the concepts are associated in a manner that merits their joined
assessment.’”° In fact, it seems undisputed that the ECT’s FET standard includes the
obligation to provide a stable and predictable legal framework for investments.’”°

534. In the present case, the Claimants argue that the Respondent breached the FET standard

under the ECT, inter alia, because it adopted measures that frustrated their legitimate

™3 See Eiser v. Spain (Award), § 382; Charanne v. Spain (Final Award), § 517.
™ See Electrabel v. Hungary (Decision on Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability), 7.77. (“While the investor

is promised protection against unfair changes, it is well established that the host State is entitled to maintain a
reasonable degree of regulatory flexibility to respond to changing circumstances in the public interest.
Consequently, the requirement of fairness must not be understood as the immutability of the legal framework, but
as implying that subsequent changes should be made fairly, consistently and predictably, taking into account the
circumstances of the investment.”)

Several tribunals interpreting the ECT have referred to the relationship between stability of the legal framework
and the FET standard under the Treaty. See Plama v. Bulgaria (Award), § 173 (“In addition, the conditions are
dependent on their accordance with the other standards. For instance, stable and equitable conditions are clearly
part of the fair and equitable treatment standard under the ECT.”); Electrabel v. Hungary (Decision on
Jurisdiction, Applicable Law and Liability), 7.73 (“The first part of Article 10(1) ECT refers to the
encouragement and creation of ‘stable, equitable, favourable and transparent conditions for investors’, which is
said to include a commitment to accord at all times fair and equitable treatment to investments. Fair and equitable
treatment is connected in the ECT to the encouragement to provide stable, equitable, favourable and transparent
conditions for investors.”) Charanne y. Spain (Final Award), § 477 (“From Article 10(1) it can be inferred that
the duty to provide fair and equitable treatment is included within the broader obligation to create stable, equitable,
favourable and transparent conditions.”)

expectations as to the continued application of the Original Regime.””” The Claimants’
allegations in this regard are thus closely related to their claims about the stability of the
legal framework.

The Parties concur that the protection of the legitimate expectations held by an investor
forms part of the FET standard under the ECT. However, they disagree over the content of
the Claimants’ expectations and whether those expectations were breached in the present
case. The Parties have invoked various decisions from international arbitration tribunals in
support of their respective positions. The Tribunal agrees with some of these decisions to
the extent explained below.

First, the expectations of the investor cannot be analysed in the abstract nor can they be
based on the investor’s subjective beliefs. On the contrary, the finding that there has been
a violation of the investor’s legitimate expectations must be based on an objective standard,
which must be assessed on a case-by-case basis.””*

Second, the investor’s expectations must be assessed at the time of the investment’s
making.” Accordingly, the Tribunal must consider when the investment was made, what
the circumstances were at that time and the information that the investor had or should
reasonably have had, had it acted with the requisite degree of diligence (considering its
expertise). In carrying out this assessment, tribunals must attempt to place themselves at
the time of the investment and consider the information and conditions available at such
time, and to refrain from appraising the investor’s expectations with the benefit of
hindsight.

Third, the expectations of the investor need to originate from some affirmative action of
the State, either in the form of specific commitments made by the host State to the investor
—as several international investment tribunals have recognized—™® or in the form of
representations made by the host State, for example, with respect to certain features of a
regulation aimed at encouraging investments in a specific sector. In other words, legitimate
expectations cannot arise from subjective considerations of the investor absent an
affirmative action of the State which, objectively determined, evidences that the State
intended to describe a particular treatment or regime on which the investor could rely when
making its investment.

Accordingly, the Tribunal will assess the legitimacy of the Claimants’ expectations against
the existing conditions at the time of the investment, the background of information that

the Claimants had or should reasonably have had at the time of the investment and of
Spain’s conduct prior to, and at the time of, the investment. This examination is based on
the facts of this case, as pleaded by the Parties and evidenced in the record of this
arbitration.

540. Itis undisputed that investments in the capital-intensive RE sector —including CSP power-

generation projects— require economic incentives from the State because such
technologies at least initially cost more than conventional power generating facilities.”*!
The purpose of subsidization in this context is to allow the technologies to be developed in
the hope that over time the costs associated therewith will decline, thus making RE
technologies more competitive. It is undisputed in the present case that through the
compensation system offered in RD 661/2007, Spain sought to encourage further
investments in its RE sector to meet the targeted growth in certain technologies, including
CSP systems.”*?

542. Similarly, a press release from the Ministry dated 25 May 2007 stressed that the recently

146

543. Beyond Spain’s statements regarding the need for regulatory stability and predictability in
reports, press releases and presentations, the Tribunal observes that the Respondent
expressly referred to these principles in royal decrees concerning the RE sector.

544. For instance, the preamble of RD 661/2007 states that:

“{...] [In order to safeguard the security and quality of the supply of
electricity in the system, and in order to minimise the restrictions on
production in those technologies which are today considered not
manageable, certain reference installed power targets are established
which coincide with the targets of the Renewable Energy Plan 2005-
2010 and the Strategy for Energy Saving and Efficiency in Spain
(E4), for which the compensation system set out in this Royal Decree
shall be applicable.””*5

545. The 2005-2010 Plan analysed barriers to the development of CSP capacity in Spain and
provided recommendations for increasing investment in the Spanish RE sector that had
been thus far insufficient. Notably, the 2005-2010 Plan recognized that investments in RE
installations require large sums of upfront capital which are typically obtained through
third-party financing. To encourage investments in the Spanish RE sector, the 2005-2010
Plan recommended, inter alia, that regulated remuneration for RE installations be
retained.’*° The 2005-2010 Plan thus recognised that, to meet its policy goals regarding the
CSP sector, Spain needed to provide incentives that would ensure long-term and stable
cash flows. It is undisputed by the Parties that the incentives provided for in RD 661/2007
fulfilled those requirements.

546. Similarly, the preamble of RD 1614/2010, recognizes that:

“This growth [in electricity from renewable sources] has arisen
thanks to the existence of a solid, stable and predictable economic
and legal support regime, and the contribution of all players involved
therein: Public Administration Bodies, the system’s technical and
economic operators and companies.

Worth special mention is the growth in wind, solar thermoelectric
and photovoltaic technologies, the objectives for 2010 for installed
power having been equalled and indeed exceeded.

Therefore the support regime, as set forth in the formulation thereof,

must adapt, while ensuring the legal security of investments and the
principle of fair return, to the dynamic reality of the learning curves

of the different technologies and to the technical constraints that arise

785 Exhibit C-0020, RD 661/2007, Preamble.

due to the increased penetration of such technologies in the
generation “mix”, to thus maintain a necessary and adequate support
that is consistent with market conditions and with the strategic
objectives in the area of energy and to contribute to the transfer to
society of the profit from the suitable development of these
technologies.”’*’ [Emphasis added]

547. The preamble of RD 1614/2010 thus recognises that the stability and predictability of the
regime were key to attaining Spain’s policy goals regarding RE technologies and further
provides that any changes to the regime must ensure the legal security of the investments.
From its preamble, RD 1614/2010 iterates Spain’s representations regarding the stability
and predictability of the regulatory regime applicable to RE installations.

548. The requirement that acts of the State be reasoned is common to most legal systems and,
in any event, exists under Spanish law. The reasoning of an administrative act —as
reflected in its preamble— exposes the motives for the State’s actions. In the present case,
the preamble of the royal decrees enacted by the Spanish Government —specifically
RD 661/2007 and RD 1614/2010— reflect the Respondent’s intention to provide for and
guarantee the stability of the legal and economic regime applicable to RE projects. Previous
and subsequent acts by State entities, including reports from the CNE, press releases from
the Ministry and advertising material prepared together with InvestInSpain, all emphasise
the stability of the regulatory regime set forth under RD 661/2207.”** The stability of the
regulatory regime for investments in the RE sector was thus the /eitmotiv of Spain’s acts at
the time of the Claimants’ investment.

549. In addition to the above-noted statements, Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 provided that:

“The revisions to the regulated tariff and the upper and lower limits
indicated in this paragraph shall not affect facilities for which the
deed of commissioning shall have been granted prior to 1 January of
the second year following the year in which the revision shall have
been performed.””*

“For solar thermoelectric technology facilities that fall under Royal

extended until 31 December 2013 for those facilities associated to

551. The Claimants claim that Article 44(3) of RD 661/2007 and Article 4 of RD 1614/2010

clearly guarantee that any future changes to the FIT regime would not affect existing
installations that had satisfied the registration requirements referred to therein.””' Invoking
the award in Charanne v. Spain, the Respondent contends that “registration in the RAIPRE
was simply an administrative requirement to be able to sell energy, and did not imply that
the facilities registered had an acquired right to a particular remuneration.”””*

552. The Tribunal is not persuaded that registration in the RAIPRE is simply an administrative

requirement to sell energy without any further legal consequences. The Respondent’s
explanation is not only inconsistent with the wording of the provisions reproduced above,
but it is also at odds with Spain’s contemporary representations that “[fluture tariff
revisions shall not be applied to already functioning facilities””> Given the precision and
detail exhibited in the royal decrees, particularly the contemplation that the treatment
would be accorded for a defined period of time, the Tribunal has no difficulty in concluding
that this falls squarely into the type of State conduct that was intended to, and did, give rise
to legitimate expectations of the Claimants.

Andasol Plants would remain completely unchanged, said provisions did reflect Spain’s
commitment to ensuring the stability and predictability of the existing economic regime.

554. To summarize, the Tribunal finds that at the time of the Claimants’ investment in the
Andasol Plants, Spain (i) recognised that RE projects required high upfront capital
investments; (ii) understood that to foster investments in that sector, in line with its policy
goals, it needed to create more appropriate incentives; (iii) issued RD 661/2007 providing
incentives to encourage investments in certain RE technologies, including CSP projects,
and (iv) represented, through its acts and regulations, that the economic regime applicable
to RE projects would remain stable and predictable.

555. Relying on Charanne v. Spain, the Respondent argues that the Claimants could not have
had the legitimate expectation that the regulatory framework established by RD 661/2007
would remain unchanged throughout the useful life of its plants, as admitting the existence
of such an expectation would amount to the freezing of the regulatory framework.”4 The
Tribunal agrees with this contention. The requirement of stability under the Treaty does
not equate to the immutability of the legal framework. The State is certainly entitled to
exercise its sovereign power to amend its regulations to respond to changing circumstances
in the public interest.””° However, any such changes must be consistent with the assurances
on stability of the regulatory framework provided by the State and required by the ECT.

556. The Tribunal’s opinion regarding the legitimate expectations of the investor is consistent
with Charanne v. Spain in that such expectations may be defeated if the host State
eliminates the essential features of the regulatory framework relied upon by the investor in
making a long-term investment. In this regard, the tribunal in Charanne v. Spain reasoned
as follows:

“In their Memorial on the Merits, the Claimants submit in this regard
that ‘the investor’s legitimate expectations [...] are defeated, even in
the absence of specific commitments, when the host State carries out
actions that are incompatible with a criterion of economic
reasonableness, with the public interest, or with the proportionality
principle.’

As a matter of principle, the Arbitration Tribunal accepts this
approach. Indeed, an investor has the legitimate expectation that,

The Arbitration Tribunal considers that the proportionality
requirement is fulfilled as long as the modifications are not random
or unnecessary, and that they do not suddenly and unexpectedly
eliminate the essential features of the regulatory framework in
place.”’*° (Emphasis added)

557. The tribunal in Charanne v. Spain concluded that the claimants in the said arbitration had
not proved that the Respondent violated its obligation to grant FET due to the modifications
to the regulatory regime undertaken in 2010. In summarizing its findings, the tribunal
observed:

“In sum, the Tribunal considers that the 2010 regulations cannot be
considered to be in violation of the ECT. Indeed, said rules introduce
modifications _that_are restricted _to the regulatory framework
applicable at the time of the investment, without eliminating its
essential features, and_in particular, the existence of _a_tariff
guaranteed during the entire lifespan of the facilities. The Claimants
have not proved that the 2010 regulations defeated their legitimate
expectations under the ECT due to being unreasonable, arbitrary,
contrary to the public interest or disproportionate. Neither is there
any proof whatsoever that such provisions were unfair or
inconsistent. Finally, the Claimants have not proved that the 2010
regulations were adopted in violation of the due process requirements
under Spanish law.””°’ (Emphasis added)

 

558. It warrants noting that the Charanne tribunal’s analysis was restricted to the 2010
regulations and did not extend to RDL 9/2013, or any other provision issued in 2013 or
afterwards.” Within such limited scope, the tribunal found that it “[could not] draw the
conclusion that Spain breached its obligation to provide regulatory stability.” By
contrast, the disputed measures in the present case include RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013 and
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014.°” Therefore, the Tribunal must determine whether the

straightforward manner, that ‘they do not request the Tribunal to decide on RDL 9/2013 and its implementing

amendments to the regulatory regime applicable at the time of the investment introduced
by Spain through the Disputed Measures eliminated the essential features of such regime,
thus defeating the Claimants’ legitimate expectations regarding the stability of the
regulatory framework.

559. Pursuant to RD 661/2007, energy producers under the Special Regime had a right to obtain

a fixed tariff or a premium over market price, at their choice, for their electricity
production.**! This royal decree specified the amounts of both the fixed tariff and the
premium in euros per kilowatt hour that would be payable in respect of each hour of
production, subject to a cap and a floor. RD 661/2007 further provided qualifying
installations with priority of access and priority of dispatch to the transmission and
distribution networks.

560. According to the tribunal in Charanne v. Spain, the essential features of the regime set

forth under RD 661/2007 were the offering of a guaranteed tariff and the granting of
privileged access to the electricity transmission and distribution grid.*” In this case, it is
undisputed that through RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013, Spain (a) replaced the FIT system
by a remuneration system that allowed certain RE installations to obtain a special payment
by reference to a standard installation*® and (b) withdrew the right of priority of grid access
and priority of dispatch for RE installations.*°* Moreover, RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013 and
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 dismantled all the regime and therefore all the features
of the regime provided for under RD 661/2007. Thus, whether the Tribunal were to adopt
the opinion of the Charanne tribunal regarding the essential features of the RD 661/2007
regime, or whether it was to consider that only the FIT system was the key feature of the
regime, it would necessarily conclude that Spain breached its obligations under Article
10(1) of the ECT by eliminating those features through RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013.

562. In the Tribunal’s view, considering the Parties’ respective contentions and the terms of the

ECT as explained above,***

“reasonable return”, but rather how such “reasonable return” is determined. To comply
with the stability and predictability requirements under the ECT, the methodology for
determining the payment due to CSP installations must be based on identifiable criteria.

the issue at hand is not whether the New Regime provides a

563. Based on the Parties’ submissions and the evidence submitted in this arbitration, the

Tribunal is not persuaded that the methodology for determining the “reasonable return”
under the New Regime complies with the requirements of the ECT and is sufficiently
aligned to the representations previously made by Spain regarding the stability of the legal
and economic regime applicable to RE projects in order to induce investments in the CSP
sector.

564. First, the New Regime fixes the “applicable rate for reasonable return” at 7.398% before

taxes. Such rate is based on the average yield in the secondary market of 10-year Spanish
government bonds, plus a differential of 3%.* The evidence in the record does not point
to an identifiable basis for determining such adjustment. On the contrary, during cross-
examination, Mr. Montoya —manager of the solar department at IDAE— conveyed that
the 3% adjustment is simply what he considered to be an appropriate spread.*!°

565. Second, the Special Payment is calculated considering the costs of a standard installation.

808

809

810

According to Mr. Montoya, “each standard installation represents a group of installations
that share the same technical characteristics and that share the same year of
commissioning.”*'! The determination of whether the plants are sufficiently similar was
undertaken by the IDAE, according to their calculations.*!? Mr. Montoya claims that his
calculation “covers practically all installations that have been put into service, including
operating costs and other costs.”*'? However, the Respondent has offered no further
evidence in this arbitration to show the parameters used by the IDAE to determine the
features of a standard installation. There is no evidence on the record as to which
parameters were considered in determining what is a standard installation. Other than the
testimony of Mr. Montoya, the Respondent provided no evidence as to which studies —

basis points? A. Well, I was calculating for the standard installations and the remuneration. So those data are
scenarios for me. On a regulated market, normally the spread is 200 basi points. So if you get 50% more in the
spread, it is taking into account the risks, which may be higher in this kind of operation. So I think it is the standard
spread that is used for that kind of regulated activity. Q. So you decided that that was the appropriate spread to
apply in order to determine the reasonable return in this case? A. Yes.”)

technical, financial or otherwise— were made or considered to determine the criteria for
grouping the installations and to determine which installations shared the same technical
characteristics and the same year of commissioning.

566. Third, the “reasonable rate of return” is subject to a mandatory revision every three years

and a possible revision every six years.*' At the three-year point, the forecast of the market
price is adjusted to the actual market price, which could go up or down.*!> After six years,
Spain could revise the figure for the “reasonable return” and apply a different
adjustment.*!® When asked about these possible revisions, Mr. Montoya acknowledged that
the Government was entitled to either increase or decrease the spread, but failed to explain
the criteria under which an adjustment would be made.*!” There is thus no evidence in the
record that shows that the Government has established an identifiable set of criteria for the
revision of the remuneration for RE installations.

567. Fourth, determination of the special payment under the New Regime is subject to the

7.398% rate.*'* As explained by Mr. Montoya, the Government considers the revenues
obtained by a group of installations under the same standard installation and, on that basis,
it estimates “how many subsidies they need to achieve a reasonable rate of return, which
is 7.398%.”*!” As a result, the already reduced “reasonable rate return” may be lowered
considering previous payments to the relevant installation. Moreover, if the revenues
obtained by a group of installations under the same standard installation exceeds the
7.398% rate of return, future compensation under the New Regime will be reduced
accordingly so that the rate of return does not exceed the aforesaid 7.398%.*”° This means
that the rate of return under the New Regime may apply to periods preceding the
establishment of the New Regime.

568. Based on the evidence on the record of this arbitration, the Tribunal concludes that the

814

sis

19

methodology for determining the “reasonable rate of return” under the New Regime is not
based on any identifiable criteria. On the contrary, what Spain labels a “reasonable rate of
return” seemingly depends on governmental discretion. This is in plain contrast with the
relative precision of the Original Regime —in force when the Claimants made their
investment— which provided for objective and identifiable criteria for determining the

possibility.) [Emphasis added]

Finally, Spain contends that the disputed measures were adopted to address the Tariff

indicates that the main purpose of these measures was to address the said deficit

It is undisputed that the Tariff Deficit poses a legitimate public policy problem for Spain.
However, the experts of both Parties agree that the Tariff Deficit originated before Spain
had any significant RE capacity.**4 The Respondent’s suggestion that the incentives offered
under the Original Regime caused the deficit is therefore unattainable.

Moreover, Brattle showed that, “Spain provided cumulative financial support of €0.6
billion to CSP from 2000 to 2011, which was less than 0.6% of €118 billion in cumulative

persuaded that the FIT for CSP plants played a significant role in the accumulation of the

costs of regulated activities other than generation.

Under these circumstances, the Tribunal cannot agree that the Tariff Deficit justified the
elimination of the key features of the RD 661/2007 regime and its replacement by a wholly
new regime, not based on any identifiable criteria.

For the reasons stated above and based on the facts credited in the record of this arbitration,
the Tribunal cannot conclude that Spain complied with its obligation under Article 10(1)
of the ECT.

REPARATION

A. CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

1. Spain’s international r ibility for violations of the ECT

Since Spain has breached its obligations under Article 10 of the ECT, the Claimants are
entitled to full reparation in accordance with principles of customary international law, as

codified in the International Law Commission’s Articles on the Responsibility of States
for Internationally Wrongful Acts (“ILC Articles”).**° Thus, Spain is under an obligation
to make restitution to or, alternatively, compensate the Claimants for its internationally
wrongful acts. Accordingly, Spain must, as far as possible, put the Claimants in the position
they would have been in but for Spain’s wrongdoing.*?”

575. Spain is obliged to effect restitution by withdrawing all the harmful laws and regulations
disputed by the Claimants (namely the relevant articles of Law 15/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL
9/2013, Law 24/2013, Order IET/1045/2014 and Order IET/1882/2014), while also
compensating the Claimants for all losses suffered prior to the reinstatement of the original
regulatory regime. In the alternative, if the Tribunal were to believe that restitution is either
materially impossible or wholly disproportionate, the Respondent must pay the Claimants

loss of profits insofar as this

ion for any fi ially ible damage includi

is caused by the Disputed Measures.*?*

576. The ECT does not provide for a measure of damages for a breach of Article 10. Thus, the
standard of damages applicable to a breach of Article 10 is the fair market value standard,
specifically the difference in the fair market value of the investments with and without the
Disputed Measures.*” The fair market value is the standard applicable under Article 13 of
the ECT in the event of a lawful expropriation and has been held by previous tribunals as
the appropriate standard for compensation for a breach of the FET clause in the Argentina-
U.S. BIT which, like the ECT, has no standard of compensation applicable to the FET
clause but establishes that lawful expropriations must be compensated through the fair
market value standard.**° Likewise, the tribunal in Anatolie Statie v. Kazakhstan**' held
that the standard of damages for a breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT should not be lower
than the fair market value standard prescribed by Article 13 of the ECT.**

2. Valuation methodology and valuation date

577. The removal of the FIT has significantly affected the Claimants’ investments. It threatened
the Claimants’ ability to operate the Andasol Plants in accordance with their loan
obligations and exposes Andasol-2 SA to a possibility of default on its debt. The Disputed
Measures have also created significant regulatory risk in the Spanish RE market, which

has had a negative impact on Antin’s investments, and thus Spain must compensate the
Claimants for the lost fair market value of their investments, comprised of lost historical
and future cash flows.**?

578. Brattle values the fair market value of Antin’s investments in the Andasol Plants using a

discounted cash flow (“DCF”) analysis. Brattle compares two scenarios: the “But For”
scenario, in which the Disputed Measures were never implemented, and the “Actual”
scenario, which takes into account the full effect of the Disputed Measures. This comprises
lost cash flows, both historical and future. The amount of damages due to the Claimants is
the difference in the net present value between the Claimants’ cash flows with and without
the Disputed Measures.***

579. A DCF approach, which involves looking forward from the valuation date and projecting

the most likely revenues and expenses of the going concern, is the approach that most
accurately captures the Claimants’ lost future cash flows, since it recognises that future
cash flows have less value than current cash flows due to market risk and the time value of
money. The DCF method is considered to be theoretically the strongest of the valuation
methods frequently chosen by tribunals.**>

580. In the present case, a DCF analysis is appropriate since (i) it can be used to explore the

impact of different scenarios on the Claimants’ cash flows and enables regulatory risk to
be properly accounted for; (ii) it is particularly appropriate for the valuation of power
stations and has come to dominate such valuations, and (iii) CSP projects have a relatively
simple business model whose demand and long-run value can be analysed and modelled
in detail based on readily available data.**°

581. Asa general principle, damages resulting from a breach are valued as at the date of harm.

In cases of breach of an FET clause where the State has implemented multiple measures,
tribunals have drawn on the test applied in cases of indirect expropriation. In such cases,
there is growing recognition that the appropriate date for determining liability and valuing
damages should be the date of culmination of all the events, i.e., the point of irreversible
deprivation of the property, rather than the date of the first event.**”

582. This test has been adapted for breaches other than expropriation, including the obligation

to provide FET.*** In the case at hand, the Tribunal should thus consider when the

585.

Claimants suffered harm by reference to the irreversible deprivation test, taking into
account when the most serious damage was caused to the Claimants. For such purpose, the
relevant date is 20 June 2014, on which Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, the final act of
the Spanish measures, was published.

To this regard, there are seven potential dates for valuation, corresponding to the different
dates on which the Disputed Measures were adopted. Two of these dates may be considered
to be the relevant date for valuation purposes. First, 12 July 2013, date on which Spain
introduced RDL 9/2013, which was a complete overhaul of the RD 661/2007 economic
regime. And second, 20 June 2014, date on which the Government published Ministerial
Order IET/1045/2014, which set out the precise parameters for calculating the Special
Payment under the New Regime. It is 20 June 2014 the date that is the most appropriate
valuation date since (i) it was only then that Spain defined the parameters of the New
Regime, confirming the total departure from the RD 661/2007 regime and thus, prior to
that date, irreversible deprivation had not taken place; (ii) taking a valuation prior to 20
June 2014 is artificial and would require using hindsight, since from 12 July 2013 until that
date the Claimants were unable to assess the extent of the impact of the New Regime and
could not value their investments and (iii) 20 June 2014 represents the ultimate act of a
two-year legislative backlash against RE, and on that date over 71% of the value of the
Claimants’ investments was wiped out.*°

By applying certain assumptions, Brattle calculated the difference in the total lost historical
cash flows in the Andasol Plants to be EUR 25 million. Pursuant to its percentage
shareholding in the Andasol Companies, Claimants’ portion of those lost cash flows is
EUR 11 million.“

Regarding the lost future cash flows, Brattle calculates the Base Net Present Value (“Base
NPV”) of the reasonably-expected cash flows of the Andasol Plants. In the But For
scenario, the Base NPV of the two CSP projects is EUR 935 million, while in the Actual
scenario the Base NPV is EUR 498 million. Thus, the Disputed Measures have decreased
the Base NPV of the CSP projects by EUR 437 million, which represents the lost net
present value of the equity held in the CSP projects. Brattle then adjusts the Base NPV in
both scenarios to take into account the positive “financing side-effects” of holding debt
(“Adjusted NPV”). In the But For scenario, these effects amount to EUR 34 million and
the Adjusted NPV is EUR 970 million, while in the Actual scenario they amount to EUR

4! Claimants’ Memorial, §{] 504-506.

158

43 million, corresponding to an Adjusted NPV of EUR 541 million. Thus, the impact of
the Disputed Measures is reduced by EUR 8 million to EUR 429 million.*

586. Brattle then subtracts from each scenario the net present value of the debt held by the

Andasol Companies, obtaining the “Final Equity Value”. In the But For scenario, the net
present value of the debt is EUR 376 million, resulting in a Final Equity Value of EUR 593
million, while in the Actual scenario the present value of the debt is EUR 366 million,
resulting in a Final Equity Value of EUR 175 million. Hence, the Disputed Measures have
reduced the Final Equity Value by EUR 419 million. Brattle then assigns a percentage of
the Final Equity Value to the Claimants, in proportion to the Claimants’ 45% shareholding
in the Andasol Companies, and subsequently applies an illiquidity discount of 18%, since
the Claimants’ CSP assets are difficult to trade. This results in lost future cash flows to the
Claimants, as of 20 June 2014, amounting to EUR 155 million.*4? Together with the lost
historical cash flows, Antin’s damages amount to EUR 166 million, excluding interest and
tax gross-up. After taking into account scheduled maintenance at the Andasol Plants and
the lifetime of the storage and non-storage components of the plants, the Claimants’ lost

cash flows amount to EUR 148 million.“4*

587. The Claimants request that the Tribunal award both pre-award and post-award interest on

the amounts due. In this regard, Article 13 of the ECT provides that interest will be
calculated at a commercial rate established on a market basis from the date of expropriation
until the date of payment. Although this article is only applicable to expropriation, this is
also the appropriate benchmark for the assessment of damages arising out of breaches of
the ECT other than expropriation.**>

588. Interest intends to achieve full reparation, as required by Article 38 of the ILC Articles,

and to re-establish the situation that would have existed if the illegal acts had not been
committed. Thus, interest is an integral part of any award of compensation.*° Since pre-
award and post-award interests serve different purposes, the Tribunal may and should
adopt different rates for each.*4”

589. As regards to pre-award interest, a rate that affords full reparation and is a commercial rate

842

843

845

a7

established on a market basis within the meaning of the ECT, is Spain’s borrowing rate
(based on the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds) which for the relevant period is 2.07%,
compounded monthly. Awarding compound interest reflects the commercial reality of the

situation and is consistent with the most recent practice of investment treaty tribunals.***

Concerning post-award interest, they serve the dual purpose of ensuring prompt
compliance and preventing unjust enrichment. The Tribunal should order post-award
interest at a rate higher than 2.07%, also compounded on a monthly basis.*””

590. Finally, to achieve full reparation, damages should be subject to a tax gross-up, since they
are calculated to place the Claimants in the same position they would have been in, net of
tax. Any amounts received by the Claimants will be subject to a corporate tax at a rate of
29.22%, the Luxembourg corporate tax rate, and the Tribunal should therefore order a
compensation including a tax gross-up of 29.22%.8°

591. Contrary to the Respondent’s allegations, the Brattle Quantum Reports do not lack
transparency. They provided the underlying detail for all of the adopted assumptions, and
thus BDO had all the information it needed to construct its own model of damages or,
alternatively, if it disagreed with Brattle’s assumptions, to adopt its own and devise a
different damages calculation.**!

 

3. The Re dent's criticisms to the d Iculati bmitted by the
Claimants
a. The Claimants’ damages are not speculative

592. Even if the Tribunal were to find, as requested by the Respondent, that the Claimants’
legitimate expectations were limited to obtaining a “reasonable return” (which is denied)
the Claimants have not received and will not receive a reasonable return under the New
Regime. The New Regime has reduced the rate of return that was implicit in RD 661/2007
and thus Spain still incurs liability and the Claimants have suffered losses for which they
must be compensated.***

593. Moreover, Spain assumes that a decision of the Spanish Supreme Court which allegedly
takes issue with the DCF method is relevant to this arbitration. However, the internal law
of the host State has limited relevance to the wrongfulness of an act attributable to that
State under an international instrument such as the ECT. Thus, the appropriate method for

reparation is a question to be determined solely by reference to public international law
and the ECT standard of fair market value.**

b. The DCF method is appropriate

594. Spain asserts that the DCF method should be rejected in this case. However, Spain has

itself adopted the DCF method in this same context in order to (i) develop cash flow
forecasts for attracting investors in its RE sector in 2005, (ii) design the tariff regime
applicable under RD 661/2007, and (iii) design the New Regime.*** Moreover, whether or
not a DCF method is appropriate reduces to the single consideration of the certainty of
future cash flows, and hence issues of duration (of both the existing track record and the
projection) and financial viability, to the extent they are relevant at all, all go to the question
of whether the future cash flows determined by the expert are likely to eventuate.**

595. The DCF method is almost universally used and accepted by both the business and

academic community in valuing income-producing assets, and it has been confirmed by
numerous tribunals to be the standard approach for calculating the fair market value of an
investment for purposes of compensation of breaches of international law.*** Tribunals
adopting the DCF approach expressly acknowledge that projecting future cash flows
requires a degree of conjecture, but minimize speculative elements by carefully analysing
the underlying assumptions and parameters. Moreover, DCF discounts more distant cash
flows more severely than near-term cash flows, assigning distant cash flows lower value
to reflect the way that uncertainty compounds over time.*°”

due to uncertainties regarding future cash flows, that is clearly not the case at hand.*** As
of the valuation date, the Andasol Plants were well-established and had been operating and
producing electricity for the national grid since 2009. In addition, the projects were fully
financed and, without the Disputed Measures in place, the Andasol Companies would not
have had trouble servicing their loans. Moreover, the DCF method has come to dominate
the valuation of power stations, and it was used by all the relevant parties who have valued
the Spanish CSP assets, including the Claimants, the lenders providing project finance and
Spain itself.°?

597. Spain argues that there is too much uncertainty regarding the future cash flows due to the

Claimants and that the DCF method is therefore unreliable. This is contradictory with
Spain’s own argument that under the New Regime investors are still obtaining a reasonable
return of approximately 7.4% pre-tax, implying that their investments are at low risk. In
any event, the future cash flows have been estimated with sufficient certainty by Brattle to
warrant the use of a DCF calculation.*

598. First, concerning the standard of proof for the certainty of cash flows, the general tendency

in investment-treaty jurisprudence has been to assess said standard as being akin to the
balance of probabilities, that is, the claimant only needs to provide a basis upon which the
tribunal can, with reasonable confidence, estimate the extent of the loss.**! A smaller
number of tribunals, to the contrary, consider that a claimant must meet a rather high
standard when demonstrating that projected cash flows are likely to be realized. Whatever
the standard adopted by the Tribunal, the Claimants easily meet their burden of proof, since
Brattle’s DCF calculation is based on mostly objective data. That is the case, firstly, for
the Base NPV, which is based on predominantly objective inputs, including data regarding
production, electricity prices, natural gas prices, inflation, financial support, operations and
maintenance costs, lifetime of the plants, the regulatory risk and the discount rate used.*°

599. As concerns Adjusted NPV, Brattle’s accounting for financing side-effects, including the

discount rate applied, is based on objective or actual data. Likewise, the Final Equity Value

of the debt is calculated based on objective third-party data.*°

600. Second, contrary to Spain’s allegations, the Andasol Companies have sufficient operating

860

history to warrant the adoption of a DCF methodology. Even though certain tribunals have
considered the duration of an investment’s operating history in this context, not all tribunals
adopt that approach. Some do not consider operational history to be a particularly
persuasive factor, and others award damages with regards to assets with a very short or no
operational history.* Even those tribunals that have ultimately rejected the DCF method
on the facts of the case have expressly recognized the possibility of adopting such method
notwithstanding a short operating history.** This is so given that even without any history
of performance, future cash flows can be estimated using other evidence such as business

plans, feasibility studies or analyst reports that contain analyses of projected costs and
revenues, validated with market indicators and industry forecasts.**

601. The relevance of a history of operational performance will depend on other factors, such

as the volatility of cash flows; in circumstances where the revenues are stable, such as the
case at hand, the duration of such history is less important.**’ However, even if the Tribunal
were to consider the length of operating history as a relevant factor, there is sufficient
historical evidence to support a DCF method: the Claimants acquired their stake in the
Andasol Plants in August 2011 and thus Brattle had almost four years of data on which to
base its future estimated cash flows.**

602. Third, Spain argues the lack of financial viability of the Andasol Companies, allegedly a

consequence of their own financial choices, in order to suggest that a DCF method is
inappropriate. However, this is not true: if the Andasol Companies, particularly Andasol-
2 SA, suffer any financial difficulties, it is due to the reduction of cash flows stemming
from the Disputed Measures. In fact, the Andasol Companies had conservative debt: equity
ratios as compared to other similar projects in the RE sector. In this regard, Spain
acknowledged that a large percentage of RE investment would require leverage.
Additionally, the Andasol Companies were making windfall profits, which suggests their
viability is not in question.*

603. In any event, very few tribunals have considered the financial state of a claimant as being

relevant to assessing the future prospect of the investment. Where this has been an issue, it
is because such financial state has undermined the ability for the investment to be profitable
in the future.'”°

604. Fourth, Spain argues that the volatility of pool prices renders the use of the DCF method

inappropriate due to its uncertainty. However, such volatility is precisely one of the reasons
for implementing a FIT regime, and thus under RD 661/2007 the pool price has only
minimal impact on the remuneration received by CSP facilities, further limited by the
established caps and floors.§7!

605. Fifth, Spain objects to how the long-term predictions are forecasted, to 37 years. However,

871

standard practice is to forecast cash flows far out into the future. Moreover, contrary to

Spain’s allegations, the useful lifetime assumptions of the Andasol Plants made by Brattle

are reasonable.*”*

606. Sixth, Spain argues that the DCF approach is inappropriate since the solar thermal industry

is in evolutionary phase and lacks the necessary maturity. However, the uncertainty
surrounding investments in RE in Spain are of the Respondent’s own doing. Likewise, any
technology risks that may have existed at the time the Claimants invested have since largely
been resolved and do not affect Brattle’s ability to forecast future cash flows. Power
stations have a relatively simple business, and future revenues and cash flows for CSP
power stations are well-defined.”

607. Finally, Brattle’s assumptions are not inherently subjective nor produce speculative

damages, as alleged by Spain. To the contrary, Brattle’s DCF calculation is conservative

and consistent with recent market transactions.‘

608. In addition to the above, the argument raised by Spain that there is a disparity between the

amount that Antin invested and the amount it claims in damages is irrelevant. However, in
neither of the cases (Wena Hotels v. Egypt and Tecmed v. Mexico) cited by the authors in
which Spain bases its allegations was the “disparity” factor a relevant consideration for
rejecting the DCF method. In those cases, the tribunal’s primary concern was the certainty
of future cash flows, which is not in doubt in the case at hand. Moreover, the disparity
between the amount claimed and the amount invested in both cases was significant and
much greater than the difference in the present case, although it was not in itself a sufficient
reason for rejecting the DCF method.*%

c The investment-based method is inappropriate

609. Spain alleges that Antin should only be entitled to the recovery of its investment costs (the

“regulatory asset base” or “RAB”) together with a reasonable return on those costs.
However, contrary to Spain’s allegations, the investment-based approach is inappropriate.
First, it is not less speculative and easier than an income-based approach like the DCF
method, since the assumptions underlying Brattle’s calculation are mostly objective and
simplicity cannot be assessed when BDO has not calculated the Claimants’ damages based
on the investment-based method.*”° Second, the investments were not acquired near the
valuation date, but nearly three years before, and in any event Spain cites no authority for
how the temporal proximity of an investment with the valuation supports the adoption of

the investment-based method. And third, Spain alleges that the Claimants’ investments are
a capital-intensive business with an important asset base, with no intangible assets to
assess; however, it is unclear what the basis of this assertion is, and thus it may not be
addressed in detail.'””

610. In addition to the above, the Claimants are not aware of a single ECT award where the
tribunal has opted for an investment-based method to assess the fair market value under
Article 10 or Article 13. Moreover, the specific kind of investment-based method
suggested by BDO, the RAB method, is not an appropriate measure of fair market value in
the circumstances. First, BDO’s reliance on this approach is highly unusual and without
support from investment-treaty jurisprudence. In fact, the RAB is not used to value the fair
market value of assets, the value of a company can differ from its RAB and this method is
only used in the context of distribution monopolies.*”* Second, the RAB is not a bona fide
alternative to assessing the fair market value of the Claimants’ investments since it does
not account for the regime change that took place, but simply assumes that a different
regime was in place at the time Antin made its investment.5”

611. The Respondent further argues that the Andasol Plants will obtain a better return than the
corresponding standard facility. This argument is irrelevant to the Claimants’ damages and
it appears to be a further manifestation of Spain’s submissions concerning the reasonable
return, questioning its liability. In any event, BDO has used the wrong capital expenditure
figures for the Andasol Plants, understating the actual cost outlay incurred, and it has
overlooked production at the Andasol Plants, which is approximately 10% lower than
production assumed for the comparable standard installation, which leads to a lower
operating incentive. Thus, it is incorrect to conclude that the Andasol Plants would earn
more than the reasonable return set by the New Regime.**°

d. Spain's prejudicial allegations

612. First, Spain alleges inconsistencies regarding asset impairments. As Brattle explains, there
is no such inconsistency, and, on any view, asset impairments are irrelevant to damages
since they are based on fundamentally different considerations.**!

613. Second, BDO opines that the Claimants were speculators. Such commentary does not fall
within the scope of an expert report on damages and, in any event, it does not withstand
scrutiny. Firstly, the price the Claimants’ paid for their investment, their contemplated exit

in 2017 and the construction costs incurred in the Andasol Plants have no bearing on the
fair market value of the Claimants’ investment with and without the Disputed Measures.
Secondly, BDO’s speculation claim comparing the price paid by the Claimants to the price
of ACS Cobra’s equity investment is flawed. Thirdly, BDO fails to address the relevance
of the Claimants’ cash flow expectations or its possible exit at a higher price than it
originally invested; in any event, the Claimants’ expectations were not unreasonable or
consistent with a speculative investment. Fourthly, BDO’s interpretation of the medium
tisk of regulatory change does not assist BDO’s argument regarding speculation and, in
any event, regulatory risk has been taken into account by Brattle in its report. Finally,
BDO’s assertion that the Claimants are speculators is contrary to the evidence on the record
in this arbitration, including the Fund’s investment strategy and its decision-making
process. **?

4. The Claimants’ alternative damages calculation

Even if the Tribunal were to find that the Claimants’ legitimate expectations were limited
by a reasonable return, the Claimants have still suffered damages. In this alternative
hypothetical scenario, the Claimants would only be entitled to earn the reasonable return
that was implicit in the FIT originally offered by the Original Regime. Three principles
underpin this alternative scenario. First, the retroactivity of the New Regime is removed.
For such purpose, Brattle assumes that (i) the Andasol Plants were entitled to earn what
Spain considered reasonable at the time (9.5% after-tax for the premium option under RD
661/2007); (ii) all CSP plants would be entitled to the same levels of financial support
regardless of their past gains; and (iii) Spain is prevented from retroactively imposing
lower cost and efficiency targets on plants that turned out to be cheaper and/or perform
better.

Second, the reasonable return that allegedly underpinned RD 661/2007 was not expressly
identified at the time. Based upon contemporaneous documents, Brattle has determined
that a 9.5% after-tax return is a reasonable target. And third, Spain never published the cost
target underpinning RD 661/2007. Brattle has used the marginal plant concept and assessed
the Claimants damages under three possible interpretations of the marginal plant,
highlighting that in the most logical scenario levelised costs are EUR 500/MWh with a
9.5% after-tax return, in contrast to approximately EUR 350/MWh with a 7.4% pre-tax
return, representing a loss of EUR 150 for each MWh of production.***

4 Claimants’ Reply, {f[ 873-882.

617.

618.

With these principles in mind, Brattle adopts the DCF method to assess the Claimants’
damages under the alternative scenario, taking the difference between the fair market value
of the Claimants’ investments under the But For and Actual scenarios as at June 2014 to
estimate the Claimants’ damages. Brattle applies a series of assumptions to each of the
three levelised cost targets identified and calculates the Claimants’ damages as follows:
(i) in scenario 1, which considers the most expensive tower system as the marginal plant,
the Claimants’ damages are EUR 196 million; (ii) in scenario 2, which considers the most
expensive parabolic trough scenario as the marginal plant, the Claimants’ losses amount to
EUR 105 million; (iii) in scenario 3, which computes the Claimants’ damages by reference
to the actual construction costs at the Andasol Plants, the Claimants’ damages amount to
EUR 100 million, all such amounts net of interest and tax.**°

B. RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Claimants have no right to compensation, since (i) the legal regime has always, since
1997, granted a reasonable return, and thus the Claimants have not suffered any deprivation
or damages, and (ii) Spain has not violated any ECT provisions. Notwithstanding the
above, in an ancillary manner, (i) the alleged damages are totally and absolutely
speculative, (ii) the DCF method is inappropriate in light of the circumstances, (iii) the
standard established for the Andasol Plants in Order IET/1045/2014 covers the investment
costs undertaken, and (iv) the Brattle Report has serious flaws.**°

1. The alleged de are totally and absolutely lative

The distinction made by Brattle between historical cash flows and future cash flows must
be rejected since it ignores the concept of useful regulatory life, as well as the joint
consideration of past flows and future flows, which are relevant in order to guarantee the
reasonable return of investments undertaken. The parameters used by the Claimants in their
Actual and But For scenarios, including the time frame used and the assumption that the
actual retribution system will remain petrified in the next decades, are hypothetical and
illusory and ignore the fact that the guiding principle of the system is the guarantee of a
reasonable return, which is a dynamic concept. Such a reasoning has been repeatedly
rejected by the Spanish Supreme Court in decisions regarding modifications to the
remuneration regime applicable to RE, where it has established that forecasts for long
periods into the future, such as the one used by Brattle, lack rigor and security. Thus, the

calculation of damages undertaken is speculative and such damages have not even been

minimally proven.**”

2. The DCF method is inappropriate in light of the_circumstances, in

accordance with the doctrine

Arbitral doctrine and case law are clear in banning the application of the DCF method
when its application is excessively speculative. In such cases, greater credibility has been
granted to more reliable methods, such as those based on assets.*** DCF will oftentimes
result in an overvaluation of the impacts suffered by the Claimants, and in the case at
hand it is unfair and impossible to apply such method since (i) there is not sufficient
financial record sustaining a minimally solid future forecast on cash flows; (ii) almost all
of the costs are investment costs in tangible infrastructures recently completed, and there
are no significant intangible assets to be assessed; (iii) the solar thermal industry is in an
evolutionary phase, and lacks the necessary maturity; (iv) there is a high dependence on
cash flows stemming from volatile and unpredictable exogenous sources, such as pool
prices; (v) the agreed project finance structures are financially weak and the plants are
excessively leveraged, compromising and conditioning their viability; (vi) the long term
predictions are calculated up to 37 years; (vii) there is a contradiction between such time
horizon and the Andasol Plants’ official useful life, as registered in their official
accountability, i.e., between 15 and 20 years; (viii) there is an evident disproportion
between the historical track record (less than five years) and the forecast time frame (37
years); and (ix) there is a disproportion between the alleged investment (and the alleged
assumed risk) and the sum claimed.**°

 

In particular, it must be underscored that the useful life of the Andasol Plants would be, as
a maximum, 25 years, and not 40 years as considered by Brattle. In fact, Claimants never
expected the Andasol Plants to have a useful life exceeding 25 years. As mentioned before,
the official useful life, as registered in the official accountability of the Andasol
Companies, varied between 15 and 20 years. Likewise, both the Draft Law Report for
RD 661/2007 and the 2005-2010 Plan estimated a useful life of 25 years. This conclusion
has been supported by both the expert report prepared by Dr. Thomas R. Mancini (the
“Mancini Report’) and the expert report prepared by Dr. Jorge Servert (the “Servert
Report), which show that the Andasol Plants will have a useful life of 25 years or less.”

Moreover, the calculations made by the Claimants have not taken into account the
necessary renovations that, according to said reports, will have to be made, nor did they
consider that the storage system will probably be inoperative before 25 years, leading to a
substantial reduction in the number of operating hours. This could entail that the Disputed
Measures actually had a favourable impact on the Andasol Plants. Moreover, Brattle has
not considered that a substantial modification of the components of the Andasol Plants
would entail a new date of entrance into service under Article 4.3 of RD 661/2007, which
would in turn cause RD 661/2007 to be inapplicable.*?!

In this sense, the DCF method has been rejected by tribunals on several grounds, including
lack of sufficiently long performance record, failure to establish future profitability of the
investment, lack of sufficient funds to complete and operate the investment and large
disparity between the amount actually invested and the amount claimed. Hence, due to the
unfairness of DCF, tribunals have often used methods based on the costs of assets in order
to assess damages, analysing whether such assets have been recovered and whether a
reasonable return has been obtained on them. These methods are less speculative and easier
to apply and are particularly appropriate when the date of acquisition of the assets is close
to the date of valuation, since on that date the price paid for the asset normally represents
its market value. A valuation based on DCF should thus be discarded in the present case.*°

3. The 's dard blished_for_the Andasol Plants in Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014 covers the investment costs undertaken

The standard established for the Andasol Plants in Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 covers
the investment costs undertaken by the Claimants. In fact, said Order established a standard
investment cost applicable to facilities with the characteristics of the Andasol Plants that
is between 12% and 14% greater than the investment actually declared by the Andasol
Companies. Hence, the specific return received by the Andasol Plants pursuant to
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 will be much higher than the reference return set forth
therein.*>

4. Serious flaws of the Brattle Quantum Report

The Brattle Quantum Report has serious flaws that totally and absolutely invalidate its
conclusions. Particularly, the report is opaque and does not provide the information used,
and hence it cannot be checked or verified.*”*

5, Subsidiary calculations using DCF render positive cial impacts for the

Claimants

In the alternative, BDO has calculated the financial impact of the Disputed Measures in
accordance with the DCF method, adopting two different alternatives for the But-For
scenario: first, by a But-For scenario calculated by reference to the provisions of
RD 36/2004, which was in force at the time the greenfield investment was made in the
Andasol Plants; and second, a But-For scenario calculated in accordance with
RD 661/2007. Under the first scenario, the Disputed Measures, as compared with
RD 436/2004, render a positive financial impact of EUR 11 million for the Claimants.
Under the second scenario, BDO calculates a negative impact of only EUR 18 million for
the Claimants, 88% less than the impact calculated by Brattle.*”*

Such a difference arises from the different DCF models used and the different parameters
considered: BDO, contrary to Brattle, has considered a useful life of the plants of 25 years,
and it has taken into account that the conditions of the But-For scenario would entail a
greater risk and greater uncertainty than those existing under the Actual scenario.
Moreover, BDO carried out a sensitivity analysis of the financial impacts before the
changes in the level of indebtedness or leverage, considering that the decision on the degree
of indebtedness of a company is an individual decision freely adopted by each economic
agent. Such analysis shows that the financial impact is very sensitive to the degree of
leverage: even in the second scenario, reducing the debt ratio to 50% reduces the financial
impact to less than half, and further reducing it to 25% would eliminate the negative
financial impact of the measures.*°°

Moreover, all of these calculations were made by applying the models used by Brattle,
which were flawed since they did not take into account different issues related to the useful
life of the technical components of the Andasol Plants. Considering such issues would
affect the cash flows and further reduce the impact claimed by the Claimants. Likewise,
any pre-award interest to be granted between the valuation date and the date of the Award

4 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, {ff 959-961.

630.

should not be calculated based on the interest rate adopted by Brattle (10-year bond), but
on a rate that has a temporal correlation with the time gap between the valuation date and
the estimated date of the award (2-year bond). Thus, even when using the speculative DCF
method proposed by the Claimants, the hypothetical financial impact of the Disputed
Measures is either positive or quantitatively negligible in relative terms.*°”

6. The inappropriateness of the tax gross-up proposed by the Clai

The Claimants request the Tribunal to include within the amount granted as compensation
a tax gross-up, in order to compensate the hypothetical tax payable by the Claimants in
Luxembourg over such amount. However, this request is inadmissible. First, the tax gross-
up proposed by the Claimants is vetoed by Article 21 of the ECT which establishes a tax
gross-up carve out, by providing that nothing in the ECT shall create rights or impose
obligations with respect to taxation measures of the Contracting Parties to the ECT. This
carve out applies to taxation measures adopted by both the host country and the home
country, since both are Contracting Parties. Moreover, the second sentence of Article 21
provides that said article will prevail in the event of any inconsistency with any other
provisions of the ECT, including Articles 10, 13 or 26. Thus, under the ECT no taxation
measures of the State of Luxembourg could create any obligations for Spain.*°*

Second, any hypothetical compensation granted in the Award would be exempt from
taxation in Luxembourg, under both the domestic fiscal regulation of Luxembourg and the
international tax regulation applicable.‘ And third, even if this were not the case, there
are certain circumstances that would qualify the claim for a tax gross-up due to tax
regulations in the home country as inappropriate, since it is essentially speculative,
contingent and uncertain. Such was the rationale exposed by the tribunal in Mobil v.
Venezuela, when it dismissed as speculative and uncertain a claim for the recognition of
further damages that could arise from other jurisdictions imposing taxes on the sum
awarded.””°

C. TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

the ECT to accord the Claimants FET. Accordingly, the Tribunal must consider the
appropriate standard of reparation.

631. In their prayer for relief, the Claimants requested that the Tribunal enter an award ordering

the Respondent to:

“(i) provide full restitution to the Claimants by re-establishing the
situation which existed prior to Spain’s breaches of the ECT, together
with compensation for all losses suffered before restitution; or

“(ii) pay the Claimants compensation for all losses suffered as a
result of Spain’s breaches of the ECT;”°"!

632. Regarding their request under (i) above, the Claimants assert that “Spain is obliged to effect

restitution by withdrawing all the harmful laws and regulations complained of in this
Memorial (namely the relevant articles of Law 12/2012, RDL 2/2013, RDL 9/2013, Law
24/2013, RD 413/2014 and the June 2014 Order) and placing Claimants under the same
legal and regulatory framework that existed at the time they made the investments.”°

633. In response to the Claimants’ request for reparation, the Respondent contends that “the

legal and regulating regime, since 1997 until today, has always granted the same, a
reasonable return. Therefore, there is no reason to claim what we have never been deprived
from, not to talk about any type of damage.”°°>

634. The Tribunal observes that neither Party engaged with the Claimants’ rather summary

request that the Respondent provide reparation in the form of restitution of the legal and
regulatory regime in force when the Claimants made their investment in Spain. While the
Claimants merely devoted two paragraphs of their Memorial to their claim for
restitution,” the Respondent did not offer a response to such claim beyond the statement
from its Counter-Memorial quoted above. Neither was this claim fully discussed in the
Parties’ subsequent pleadings or in the Hearing.

635. However, to the extent that the Claimants maintained such request for restitution in their

901

902

prayer for relief, the Tribunal must render a decision on the matter. In the present case and
based on the Parties’ pleadings and in consistency with the Tribunal’s own findings, the
Tribunal will not grant the Claimants’ request that the Respondent be ordered to “[re-

636. Based on Article 35 of the ILC Articles, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal shall order

by the Claimants disproportional to its interference with the sovereignty of the State
compared to monetary compensation.

637. As previously mentioned, the Respondent is entitled to exercise its sovereign power to

amend its regulations to respond to changing circumstances in the public interest to the
extent that any such amendments are consistent with the assurances on the stability of the
regulatory framework provided by the State and required by the ECT.” Failure to adhere
to these commitments triggers the Respondent’s obligation under the ECT to pay
compensation for damages ensued. The Tribunal’s finding in this regard is consistent with

the decision in Eiser v. Spain.°*

638. In view of the above, the Tribunal turns to the Claimants’ alternative claim that the Tribunal

order Spain to pay monetary damages resulting from its breaches of the ECT.

639. Having found that the Respondent breached its obligation under Article 10(1) of the ECT

to accord the Claimants FET, the Tribunal must now decide (i) the appropriate standard
for determining any compensation due for that breach; (ii) whether the Claimants suffered
damages and are entitled to compensation as a result of the aforesaid violation, and (iii) if
so, the amount of any such compensation.

640. At the time of the Hearing, the Claimants retained a shareholding interest in two solar

Is not materially impossible; (b) Does not involve a burden out of all proportion to the benefit deriving from

See § 532 supra.

The tribunal in Eiser v. Spain reasoned as follows: “In their Memorial and Reply, Claimants sought ‘restitution
of the legal and regulatory regime under which they made their investments or, in the alternative, damages.’ The
Tribunal does not regard restitution in the form of restoring the RD 661/2007 regulatory regime as an appropriate
remedy in this situation. As indicated earlier, the Tribunal does not question Respondent’s sovereign right to take
appropriate regulatory measures to meet public needs, potentially including revision of the RD 661/2007 regime.
However, it must do so within the international legal framework it accepted when it adhered to the ECT, including
the obligation to provide compensation for any breach of its commitments under the Treaty.” Eiser v. Spain

though the plants continue producing cash flows, it is far less than what they expected on
the basis of the regime contemplated under RD 661/2007. The Claimants have calculated
their damages based on the reduction in past and future cash flows said to result from the
Disputed Measures. The Claimants claim the amount of EUR 148 million for lost and
future cash flows resulting from the comparison between the But For and Actual scenarios,
i.e. the comparison between the cash flows that the Claimants would have obtained absent
the Disputed Measures and the ones they would obtain under the New Regime (excluding
interest and a tax gross-up).”!°

641. Brattle, the Claimants’ valuation experts, start from the premise that alleged violations

commenced on 27 December 2012, when Law 15/2012 withdrew support for the MWh
generated by natural gas and imposed a 7% levy on electricity production by CSP, wind
and other types of power stations,?!' that RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013 fundamentally
changed the regulatory regime for CSP, and that Spain left several parameters of the new
regime unspecified until June 2014 when it issued RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014.?!?

642. Based on the above premises, Brattle calculates, as a first step, the so-called “historical

cash flows” corresponding to the difference between the actual cash flows from December
2012 up until June 2014 and the estimated during this same period had the RD 661/2007
regime remained fully in force.?'> The second step in Brattle’s valuation is to estimate the
fair market value of the Claimants’ investments. In doing so, Brattle forecasts the
reasonably expected cash flows of the Andasol Plants under the But For and Actual
scenarios.°'* In this second step the But For scenario assumes the continued application of
the RD 661/2007 regime and the Actual scenario reflects the cash flows resulting from the
introduction of RDL 9/2013, RD 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014.°'5

valuators forecast production levels with reference to historical performance and
contemporaneous forecasts prepared by the Claimants; assume that annual average pool
prices grow with inflation over the long-run from a base of EUR 48 per MWh in 2015/16,
and assume that Spanish gas prices move similarly. Brattle forecasts inflation with
reference to the traded prices of Spanish inflation swaps and projects future O&M costs by

reference to the contractual arrangements with O&M suppliers existing on the date of
Brattle’s Quantum Report I.°!

644. Brattle applies a DCF approach that discounts the projection of future cash flows in the

But For and Actual scenarios. In such approach, Brattle discounts the future cash flows to
reflect risk and for purposes thereof considers “discount rates and techniques for the

relatively low-risk But For scenario, as compared to the higher risk Actual scenario.”?'7

645. To assess the risk for purposes of the calculation, Brattle examines a sample of publicly

traded renewables companies to estimate a discount rate reflecting market risk and adds a
further discount to reflect the presence of regulatory risk in Spain. Brattle quantifies the
regulatory risk by reference to the performance of securitised debt linked to the Spanish
Tariff Deficit. Brattle considers that the performance of these securities provides the basis
for additional regulatory risk discounts in both the But For and Actual scenarios.*!* The
June 2014 valuations performed by Brattle also consider the financial structure of the
Claimants’ investments, and particularly the fact that the Claimants hold shares and
shareholder loans in the Andasol Companies which themselves have borrowed substantial
sums.°!° Brattle first estimates the value of the relevant Andasol Companies as a whole,
and then deduces the value of the outstanding liabilities of the Andasol Companies to
derive the value of the Claimants’ investments interests. Finally, Brattle reduces the value
of the Claimants’ investment interests “by a further 18% to account for their relatively
illiquid nature.”?”

646. As a third and last step, Brattle calculates the amount of pre-award interest and the tax

gross-up resulting from the requirement to pay Dutch income tax on any damages awarded
by the Tribunal.°”!

alleged that the damages claimed by the Claimants are “totally and absolutely speculative”;

investment costs undertaken; and “other serious defects of the Brattle Report.”

Even though Spain submitted with its Counter-Memorial expert reports prepared by BDO,
in BDO Quantum Report I, the Respondent’s experts did not respond to the calculations
made by Brattle, and it was only in their second report that the Respondent’s experts
addressed all the calculations made by Brattle and proposed an alternative calculation
method.

In their second quantum report, BDO expanded upon their prior objections and presented
their own calculations of the value of the Claimants’ investment. Even though, considering
the timing of the presentation of these new valuations, the Claimants did not have an
opportunity to respond in the written phase, at the Hearing and in their post-Hearing briefs
the Parties debated their respective valuations.

The Respondent’s objections to the calculation of damages presented by the Claimants are,
therefore, fundamentally the same submitted by BDO particularly in BDO Quantum
Report II.

The Respondent claims that the distinction between historical and future cash flows should
be rejected, on the one hand because the date of 20 June 2014 is a date arbitrarily chosen
by the Claimants, and on the other because it ignores “the essential concept of regulatory
useful life as well as the joint consideration of past flows and future flows, in order to
guarantee the reasonable return of investments undertaken”.?”3

The Respondent also takes issue with the DCF method used by Brattle. First, because in
Spain’s view generally the use of the DCF method is speculative and, in addition, even if
acceptable generally, it has been banned by case law and the doctrine in circumstances
such as the ones prevailing in this arbitration.°”4

Specifically, the Respondent considers that the DCF method cannot be applied in the
calculation of the alleged damages suffered by the Claimants because:

(a) The lack of sufficient financial record (less than five years) sustaining a minimally
solid future forecast on cash flows and the evident time disproportion between the
said financial track record and the predictions (37 years).

(b) The long-term predictions in the forecast (37 years) and the contradiction of such
time horizon and the plants’ official useful life declared in the official accountability
of the plants (between 15 and 20 years).

°3 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, {ff 935-936.
4 Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, {ff 942-948.

176

(c) The fact that it is a capital-intensive business, with an important asset base. Almost
all its costs are investment costs in tangible infrastructure performed recently (plants
finished in 2008-2009). There are no significant intangibles to be assessed.

(d) The nature of the thermosolar industry itself: it is in an evolutionary phase, lacks the
necessary maturity and has a high dependence on cash flows of volatile and
unpredictable exogenous elements, such as the pool prices, amongst others.

(e) The financial weakness of agreed project finance structures without recourse, which
excessively leveraged thermosolar plants, compromising and conditioning their
viability.

(f) The disproportion between the alleged investment (and the pretended assumed risk)

and the claimed sum.°”°

654. The Respondent concludes that the appropriate method applicable in this case, according

to the case law and the doctrine, is the asset-based method and that the DCF method should
be discarded by the Tribunal.°?°

655. The Respondent also argues that the standard provided for under Ministerial Order

TET/1045/2014 results in a return that is higher than the one provided under the Original
Regime and that Brattle Quantum Report I is opaque, as it does not reveal nor provide the
information used and therefore it cannot be checked or verified. Quoting the BDO
Quantum Report II, the Respondent asserts that Brattle has not provided with their financial
impact report a breakdown of the calculations used and this has made it extremely difficult
to analyse the report, and to determine whether the data are arithmetically accurate or not,
and whether it is consistent with the assumptions on which it is based.°?7

656. The Tribunal further notes that BDO in both quantum reports submits that the investment

925

926

927

made by the Claimants is speculative. Particularly in BDO Quantum Report II, the experts
argue that the speculative nature of the purchase made by Antin Termosolar results from
the striking scenario where it paid almost 3 times the investment made by the initial
investor and provided for a hypothetical sale of its stake six years after its acquisition for
2.02 times the amount paid.°?* This argument was not developed by Spain in its Counter-
Memorial.

Finally, the Tribunal notes that in paragraphs 634 and following of its Counter-Memorial
and in paragraphs 421 and following of its Rejoinder, the Respondent briefly addressed the
limitations on the granting of State aid and the alleged illegality of the remuneration
provided for under the Disputed Measures in light of EU regulations. The Respondent
asserted that it was “obliged, under the provisions of Articles 107 and 108 TFEU, to notify
the European Commission of the existence of support measures for renewable energy and
cogeneration in Spain, through Order IET/1045/2014. To this effect, the Commission has
opened proceedings No. SA.40348 2014/N.” °°

In principle, the issue of whether an investor in an EU Member State that provides state
aid to RE investors should, when making the investment, consider that the State’s RE
subsidy programme is governed not only by the applicable national regime, but also by EU
state aid rules which are legally binding on Member States under EU law, could be relevant
to determine the legitimate expectations of the investor. In the instant case, however, the
Respondent did not analyse the impact, if any, of the alleged illegality of the Disputed
Measures on the legitimate expectations of the investor at the time of the investment; nor
the impact of such alleged illegality under EU law in the protection granted by the ECT;
nor did it explain the effects of the alleged illegality under EU law of measures that Spain
considered legal at the time of issuance; nor did it seek to estimate the impact of an alleged
illegality resulting from EU state aid rules on any potential award of damages.

1. The applicable standard for compensation

Article 10 of the ECT does not provide for a standard of compensation for breaches of its
obligations. No other provision of the ECT establishes a standard for compensation in case
of violation of the obligation to provide FET.

As regards expropriation, Article 13 of the ECT provides that State Parties may not
expropriate except, inter alia, when expropriation is accompanied by prompt, adequate and
effective compensation reflecting the fair market value of the expropriated property.

It is undisputed that, as a general rule, the violation of a treaty obligation causing damage
grants the injured party the right to receive compensation for the damage sustained.

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimants in that the appropriate standard for compensation
should be based on international law. In the well-known decision in the Chorzéw Case, the
Permanent Court of International Justice indicated that

°° Respondent’s Rejoinder, § 425.

178

663.

664.

665.

666.

667.

“The essential principle contained in the actual notion of an illegal
act [...] is that reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which
would, in all probability, have existed if that act had not been
committed. Restitution in kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of
a sum corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind would
bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss sustained which
would not be covered by restitution in kind or payment in place of it
—such are the principles which should serve to determine the amount
of compensation due for an act contrary to international law.”°*?

In turn, Article 31 of the ILC Articles provides that in case of a treaty breach or other
internationally wrongful act (a) the responsible State is under an obligation to make full
reparation for the injury caused by the internationally wrongful act, and (b) injury includes
any damage, whether material or moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a
State.?*!

The Tribunal considers the above as reflecting the international law rules that are to be
applied here and therefore, the Claimants under international law are entitled to full
reparation for damages caused by the breach by the Respondent of its obligation to accord
FET under ECT Article 10(1), so as to remove the consequences of the wrongful act.

Before addressing the valuation submitted by the Claimants’ experts and the criticisms
presented by the Respondent and its experts, the Tribunal will address two issues submitted
by Spain that have an impact on the damages valuation: the so-called historical damages
and the tax gross-up.

2. The historical damages

As discussed in paragraph 642 supra, the historic losses claimed by the Claimants
correspond to the difference between the actual cash flows from December 2012 up until
June 2014 and the estimated cash flows during this same period had the RD 661/2007
regime remained fully in force.

The Tribunal has already decided that the Respondent’s violation of the ECT results from
the entire elimination and replacement of the Original Regime and not from the elimination
or modification of certain features of the Original Regime. Given that the violation

%0 Legal Authority CL-0010, Factory at Chorzéw, p. 47.
°! Legal Authority CL-0086, ILC Articles, Article 31.

179

occurred when the Original Regime was eliminated in June 2014, Claimants’ damages for
the so called “historic losses” occurring prior to June 2014 must fail.

668. Considering that the historical losses are not included in the calculation of damages, the

issue of whether the Tribunal has jurisdiction regarding the claims involving the tax on
energy production as regards this portion of the claim becomes moot, as it does not affect
the calculation of the Claimants’ damages.

3. The tax gross-up claim

669. The Claimants consider that to achieve full reparation, the damages should be subject to a

tax gross-up since damages are calculated to place the Claimants in the same position they
would have been net of tax. Considering that any amounts received by the Claimants will
be subject to corporate tax at a rate of 29.22%, the Tribunal should include in the
compensation a tax gross-up of 29.22%, reflecting the income tax rate in Luxembourg
(assuming all damages are paid to Antin Luxembourg). The Claimants add that if they
obtain an award for compensation (including interest due) in October 2016, the tax gross-

up amounts to around EUR 72 million, reflecting the Luxembourg corporate tax rate.”*?

670. In its Counter-Memorial, Spain indicated that it reserved its rights to challenge the tax

gross-up, but did not indicate on which basis nor discussed the merits of such claim.°*

671. In the Rejoinder, Spain engaged with the analysis of the tax gross-up and submitted two

9

32

34

expert opinions, attached as exhibits to BDO Quantum Report II, to question the viability
of the Claimants’ claim in this regard. The Respondent’s objection to the tax gross-up is
threefold. First, the tax gross-up is impermissible given Article 21 of the ECT. This
provision applies both to the taxation measures of the host country and to the taxation
measures of the investor’s home country, since both are Contracting Parties of the ECT.
Moreover, no taxation measure of Luxembourg could create any obligation for Spain based
on the ECT.°*4 Second, the compensation would include an income that is exempt from
taxation in Luxembourg. The compensation for income that was not received would fall
within what is known as the “participation exemption” in the scope of the EU, established
by Community Directive. The participation exemption provides for the exemption of the
“profit distributions” between parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member
States of the EU and aims to eliminate double taxation. This is clear from the analysis of
both the “Luxembourg Income Tax Law”, as well as the so-called Parent-Subsidiary

Claimants’ Memorial, 536.
Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, 932.
Respondent’s Rejoinder, {4 972-981.

180

Directive.?*°

Third, any claim for tax gross-up is speculative, contingent and uncertain. The
Respondent contends that there are several issues that have not been discussed or put
forward by the Claimants and that would affect taxation to the Claimants such as whether
the Claimants benefit from a tax ruling in Luxembourg, or whether the Claimants would
neutralise the compensation with other negative income that they may have now or in the

future in Luxembourg; or whether the Claimants benefit from any special tax regime.”*°

At the Hearing, the Claimants’ counsel briefly referred to the matter in the opening
statement,?>”
Mr. Caldwell, the Claimants’ expert, admitted that he was not an expert in international

as did the Respondent’s counsel.”°* During his cross-examination,

taxation nor in Luxembourg taxes and that the corresponding figures had been included
based on the opinion of the Claimants’ counsel.’ In turn, Mr. Perez, the Respondent’s
expert, indicated that the tax gross-up calculated by Brattle was not properly supported or
evidenced.”

The Tribunal considers that it is for the Claimants to prove whether or in what amount any
tax on compensation determined by a future award may be due. There is no evidence on
the record to prove the type and amount of tax that may be due on an award of
compensation and whether such tax would be affected by the regime to which the
Claimants as taxpayers are subjected in the given jurisdiction(s). Under these
circumstances, the Tribunal is not in a position to determine whether there would be a
specific tax impact that requires a tax gross-up like the one claimed by the Claimants.
Therefore, this portion of the Claimants’ damages claim must fail.

4. Damages for loss of future cash flows

The Tribunal will now deal with the claim that constitutes the most representative amount
of the claim for damages submitted by the Claimants, namely the loss of cash flows
resulting from the Disputed Measures and the resulting reduction of the fair market value
of the Claimants’ investment. For the reasons already discussed in paragraph 667 supra,
the Tribunal will not consider the so-called historic cash flows but only the cash flows that
were allegedly lost after June 2014.

The Tribunal concurs with the Claimants in that the proper approach for determining the
amount of reparation in this case is to assess the reduction of the fair market value of the
Claimants’ investment by determining the present value of cash flows claimed to have been
lost as a result of the Disputed Measures.

As discussed in paragraph 653 supra, the Respondent and its experts disputed the
calculation of damages submitted by the Claimants and its experts. The Tribunal will now
refer to each of the issues submitted by the Respondent and disputed between the Parties.

J. The DCF method

The Respondent takes issue with the DCF method used by Brattle in general, as it considers
such method to be speculative and not applicable in the circumstances of this case.”4!
Specifically, and as a first circumstance that bans the application of this method, the
Respondent considers that the Andasol Plants lack a sufficient financial record (less than

five years) to allow for a solid future forecast on cash flows.

BDO, the Respondent’s valuation expert, considers that valuation methods, in addition to
the information used in any valuation, should be appropriate to the circumstances and
context of the valuation and that the valuation should consider aspects such as the reasons
for the valuation, the nature of the company, the business or asset to be valued, the
environmental characteristics, the company’s specific situation, the expectations of
management or shareholders, the financial information available and the management
information available. BDO adds that there are no right or wrong valuation methods, but
methods of varying appropriateness, depending on the specific circumstances.”

BDO admits that the DCF method is, along with others, one of the most commonly used
to value businesses and companies, but with certain qualifications including the fact that,
in BDO’s opinion, the main weaknesses of the DCF method are the high level of
uncertainty and subjectivity of the assumptions and parameters on which the method relies,
which assumptions and parameters can be unreliable and hard to verify, in many cases.
This is due to the fact that the assumptions and parameters on which the analysis is based
refer to expectations of a business’ future, which are generally uncertain and volatile in
nature and subject to a high level of subjectivity.

° BDO Quantum Report I, {fj 251-252.
% BDO Quantum Report I, $f] 253-255.

182

680. BDO considers that the Brattle Quantum Report is based on assumptions that are highly

subjective and that forecasts for periods exceeding 5-7 years involve a high degree of
uncertainty and subjectivity and, therefore, mean that the reliability of the DCF method is
limited. BDO adds that the approach adopted by Brattle of DCF in its Adjusted Present
Value form, presents significant inaccuracies and inconsistencies, such as the failure to
include bankruptcy costs in the valuation, and the lack of consistency in the cost of capital
adopted in the actual scenario, wherein the cost of debt is greater than the cost of equity.“

681. In the opinion of BDO, given that the Spanish State guarantees a reasonable rate of return

which will be revised and updated periodically, methods based on the cost of an efficient

investment would be better suited than the DCF method.”4°

682. BDO proposed as the most suitable method for damage valuation, in the circumstances of

this case, the asset-based method and particularly the Regulatory Asset Base (“RAB”) and
listed the advantages that such method would have in the valuation in this particular case.°"”

683. In BDO Quantum Report II, the Respondent’s experts assert that

“{...] there is no sense in projecting the variables which comprise the
cash flows for far-off periods, as the results would be less accurate.
Instead, we consider it more logical to perform forecasts for the
stated variables for up to a maximum of 5-7 years and for the
remainder of the useful lives of the plants, to annually increase the
resulting cash flows on the basis of growth and profit assumptions
taking into account the fact that as the useful life of the plants
progresses, the desired yield of the assets should approach the yield
required by the market (reflected in the discount rate), in accordance
with the foreseeable growth of the long-term yield (due to the loss of
competitive advantage) especially in regulated sectors.”°"*

684. During his opening presentation at the Hearing, Mr. Eduardo Perez of BDO disputed again

the DCF method as highly speculative and indicated that:

“The scenario is conceived in market circumstances which are not
regulated. It is a very complex situation, a very difficult situation, in
an economy which is having a very severe crisis and in a sector where
there is over-remuneration. So, in such circumstances, the DCF

183

method is very difficult to apply, and there are some specific
difficulties to apply it.”

685. Also, in his opening presentation, Mr. Perez stressed regarding the proper methodology:

“Let’s see now the valuation methods used by us, by BDO. First of all, what is our basic
approach? And second, some theoretical calculations. First of all, as I have said already,
the valuation is made in a specific context and circumstances, and the investor knows it.
They know it beforehand. And of course the main principle is reasonable return”.°°°

686. Mr. Perez added that “the basis of the regime is reasonable return. Before and after the

disputed measures, the value depends on the value of the investment: it could be a bit
higher, much higher or less higher; it depends on the efficiency of the performance, it
depends on the performance. But values are similar, and so there is no impact.”?*!

687. When cross-examined in the Hearing by the Claimants’ counsel, Mr. Perez admitted that

for purposes of the calculation of damages his first assumption was that the Claimants were
not entitled to a fixed FIT, but they should expect the plants’ remuneration to vary with
reasonable return. He also admitted that the assumptions that BDO made in its RAB
analysis did not actually answer the Claimants’ case, and finally that if the Tribunal were
to disagree with Spain and accept the Claimants’ claim that there had been a change in the
regulatory regime, there was no analysis in BDO’s reports on the impact that the change
would have on the RAB multiples.*

688. The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent’s expert in that there are no right or wrong

valuation methods, but different methods that are appropriate depending on the specific
circumstances of the case. The Tribunal also agrees that the DCF method is one of the most
commonly used methods to value businesses and companies. However, the Tribunal is not
persuaded by the objections to the use of the DCF method submitted by the Respondent
and based on BDO’s expert reports.

689. First, it is true that the DFC method may be inappropriate for the valuation of business

949

950

concerns that are not in operation or at very early stages of operation and therefore lack a
suitable track record of their performance. It may also be inappropriate for business
concerns having a short performance record and subject to several variables that are
difficult to forecast. However, this is not the case here. It is undisputed that the Andasol
Plants have five years of operation and that they are not complex businesses. As stated in
Brattle Quantum Report I —a point that the Tribunal finds convincing— “[p]ower stations

(both conventional and renewables) have a relatively simple business, producing
electricity, whose demand and long-run value can be analysed and modelled in detail based
on readily available data.”?*

Second, it is also true that the DCF forecast, as with any other forecast, has many variables
and some of them (for example inflation or interest rates) may be difficult to predict for a
long term. However, in this particular case, the alleged unpredictability of the DCF method
submitted by BDO is fundamentally tied, on the one hand, to the unpredictability of the
changes in the Spanish legal regime, and on the other, on the theory that all that the
Respondent needs to guarantee is a reasonable return. Therefore, if the Tribunal were to
find, as it did, that the Claimants are not only entitled to a reasonable return, and that the
Original Regime could not be wiped out without violating the ECT, then BDO’s case on
damages, specifically as to the inapplicability of the DFC method, would fail. As admitted
by BDO’s Mr. Perez, if the Tribunal were to find in favour of the Claimants, the RAB
analysis would not be appropriate. In other words, the BDO analysis on the DCF method
was substantially based on, and highly dependent on, the Claimants’ merits case failing.
Since the Claimants succeeded in establishing liability on the basis of an expectation as to
the continued operation of the RD 661/2007 regime, BDO’s analysis on the inapplicability
of the DCF method fails.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers the DCF approach adopted by the Claimants and their
experts to be appropriate and considers that a track record of five years in this particular
business does not prevent calculations for periods of time exceeding the five or seven years
alleged by BDO. A different issue, which the Tribunal will proceed to analyse, is whether
the calculation should be made based on an assumed operational life of the plants of 25
years or less, as claimed by the Respondent, or 40 years, as submitted by the Claimants.

6. Operational life of the Andasol Plants

Based on the testimony of Mr. Mark Crosbie, the Brattle Quantum Report assumes that
“Antin’s CSP plants could continue operating for 40 years without the need for significant
investment.” Brattle also clarifies that “Antin’s original analysis conservatively
projected that the plants would operate for 30 years. Antin now believes that an operational
lifetime of 40 years is likely. We assume that Andasol I and II would continue operating
until 2049.”°5°

°55 Brattle Quantum Report I, J 65, footnote 53.

693. In his first witness testimony, Mr. Crosbie indicated that “[w]e also looked into the main
performance criteria for the Andasol Plants taking into consideration that they had a
projected operational life of at least thirty years (and possibly up to forty years we believe
today), and would be able to supplement production using natural gas, while attracting the
same pool price plus Premiums.” °° He further clarified that thirty years was a conservative
assessment at the time, but that some of the CSP plants in the United States of America
have now been in operation for about thirty years and are still operating.’*”

694. Along with their Memorial, the Claimants submitted a due diligence report dated 7 July
2011 prepared by Altermia (“Altermia Report”) which reviewed the Andasol Plants prior
to the investment.°** According to such report, the average useful life of the plants is 30
years, provided that adequate criteria are considered for the preventive, predictive and
corrective maintenance according to good engineering practices and the recommendations
of the contractors and the suppliers of the equipment.??

695. Also with their Memorial, the Claimants submitted the report prepared by Alatec dated 15
March 2011 (the “Alatec Report”). Like the Altermia Report, the Alatec Report was
prepared for the due diligence conducted prior to the investment’s acquisition. The main
conclusion of the Alatec Report —partially disputed by Dr. Servert— is that the equipment
can be divided into two groups according to its useful life: 20 to 25 years for less expensive
equipment and approximately 35 years for core equipment, such as the turbine, mirrors,
and receptor tubes.”

696. The Alatec Report adds that thermoelectric plants using parabolic trough collectors have
an estimated useful life of 30 to 35 years, depending on the durability of the more expensive
equipment, and after 35 years, if a significant decrease in efficiency is observed,
maintaining the plant in operation would require a replacement of core equipment and a
partial replacement of secondary equipment if it is in its second cycle.°*!

697. The Claimants also submitted the Mancini Report, an expert report prepared by
Dr. Thomas R. Mancini, who evaluated the expected lifetime of the Andasol Plants and
concluded that “[i]t is reasonable to assume that, excluding the thermal energy storage

system, the Andasol projects, Andasol 1 and Andasol 2, will each have an operational
lifetime of 40 years.”°

698. The Respondent disputes the lifetime of the Andasol Plants, as submitted by the Claimants

and their experts and witnesses on several grounds.

699. First, according to Spain, the Claimants never had an estimated life expectancy of the

Andasol Plants of more than 25 years. The useful life declared in official accounts of the
holding companies of the Andasol Plants is 15 years in the annual accounts for the financial
years 2009 and 2010, and 20 years in the annual accounts for the financial years 2011 to
2013.°% Second, the base bank case for project finance of the Andasol Plants considered
cash flows during a maximum of 25 years.°™ Third and last, both the draft law report of
RD 661/2007, as well as the 2005-2010 Plan, estimated a useful life of 25 years.°°
Therefore, the higher lifetime expectancy of the plants should be 25 years.°*

700. Together with its Rejoinder, the Respondent submitted the Severt Report, an expert report

prepared by Dr. Jorge Servert on the lifetime of the Andasol Plants. In his report, Dr.
Servert concluded that

“{...] if properly operated, Andasol 1 and Andasol 2 CSP power
plants will have in the best case an operational live of 25 years. For
molten salt hot tank might be shorter as stated by Dr. Mancini, thus,
further analysis is needed. If the hot tank has corrosion problems as
Dr. Mancini states, this will be a major hazard that has to be solved,
leading to the CSP plant to work without heat storage way before 25
years.”°°7

701. In response to Dr. Mancini’s report, Dr. Servert presents a chart with a summary of his

962

969

analysis of the lifetime of the different components of the Andasol Plants.°** According to
such chart, the expected lifetime of the overall plant is 20-25 years and an expected lifetime
of less than 25 years applies to the following components of the Andasol Plants: condenser;
cooling tower; thermal receiver; steam generator; salt hot tank and system; and molten
salt/HTF heat exchangers.”

702. According to the Respondent, Brattle’s calculations on the lifetime of the plants did not

consider the necessary renovations that, in view of the reports from the engineers, should
be performed;°?” that the storage system (SAT) will probably be inoperative before 25
years;°”! and that “a substantial modification of the components of the Plant would
provoke, even according to RD 661/2007, a ‘new date to put into service’ for the purposes

of not applying the subsidy of RD 661/2007.”°

703. During cross examination, Dr. Mancini admitted that the Andasol Plants are the first to

have thermal energy storage’’? and acknowledged that lack of performance data at

medium- or long-term are potential risks for any commercial plants using this type of
technology for the first time, but clarified that this conclusion only applies to thermal
energy storage.’ Dr. Mancini also declared that his analysis was limited to the likely
lifetime of the plant, and did not consider the reinvestment costs necessary to keep the plant
operational.?”>

704. A key issue in the cross-examination related to the comparison between coal and CSP

plants, which, according to Dr. Servert, are not comparable. Dr. Mancini accepted that one
of the main differences between them is that the former work more than twice the number
of hours per year than CSP plants, and that CSP plants start and stop continuously°”®
this is likely to have an impact on the design of a turbine for CSP plants.°”’ Dr. Mancini
conveyed that, in his opinion, it is more technically accurate to refer to coal power plant
data from the United States of America than to the Altermia and Alatec reports.°”*

and

705. In response to a question from the Respondent’s counsel, Dr. Mancini indicated that he

estimated the lifetime of the cold part of the storage system to be 25 years’”’ and asserted
that if the cold part fails, the whole circuit would stop functioning.**° Dr. Mancini further
admitted that he had not seen that the duration of the O&M contracts was 19 years.°*!

706. Finally, in their post-Hearing brief, the Claimants stressed that Article 36 of RD 661/2007,

981

which refers to the applicable tariffs, contemplated a differential between the first 25 years

of operation and thereafter which, in the Claimants’ opinion, confirms that Spain
contemplated a lifetime exceeding 25 years.°**

707. The Tribunal considers that it is for the Claimants to prove the facts that support their case

on damages and in this specific case, that Brattle’s assumption of a 40-year lifetime for the
plants is correct. In the Tribunal’s view, the balance of the evidence in the record does not
support the Claimants’ case.

708. First, the documentary evidence in the record is inconsistent. The Altermia Report

contemplates a useful life of 30 years, subject to proper maintenance. The Alatec Report
considers that the useful life is 20 to 25 years for less expensive equipment and
approximately 35 years for core equipment. The Claimants’ own documentation suggests
that for purpose of the annual accounts for the financial years 2009 to 2013, as well as for
the financing, they estimated a useful life between 20 and 25 years. The Claimants’
witness, Mr. Crosbie, admitted that the Claimants had projected an operational life of 30
years, but that today they believed it could possibly be 40 years.

709. Second, the record in this arbitration does not contain contemporaneous design

specifications or contracts that could shed light on the estimated duration of the plants and
there are no witnesses with direct and first-hand knowledge of these issues.

710. Third, the testimony presented by the Claimants’ expert, Dr. Mancini, is not conclusive.

Based on several hypotheses, including the submission that coal and CSP plants are
comparable —which submission he attenuated during cross-examination— Dr. Mancini
proposes a mere reasonable assumption that the useful life of the plants is 40 years.
Moreover, during cross-examination, Dr. Mancini admitted that certain elements of the
plants might fail after 25 years and be subject to full repair, and that such failure may affect
the entire operation of the plant.

711. The conclusions of Dr. Servert, both in his expert report and in cross-examination, are not

only categorical, as opposed to reasonable assumptions, but coincide with the lifetime that
the Claimants had estimated in their own contemporaneous financial documents.

712. Finally, even though the Claimants are correct in that RD 661/2007 (Article 36) provides

982

for timelines exceeding 25 years, the Parties’ experts coincide in that substantial repairs to
the plants must be made after 25 years, and according to Article 4.3 of the RD 661/2007
substantial modifications would affect the subsidy provided for thereunder.

Considering the above, on balance, including the lack of contemporaneous documents or
other contemporaneous evidence showing that the plants were designed to have a 40-year
service life, this portion of the Claimants’ damages claim fails.

Based on the evidence on the record, the Tribunal deems that, for purposes of the
calculation of damages, the useful life of the Andasol Plants is 25 years.

7. The claim for lost future cash flows

The Tribunal has already decided that the DCF method is the appropriate method to
calculate the Claimants’ compensation, that the Claimants are not entitled to the so-called
historical losses, and that the useful life of the Andasol Plants for purposes of the
calculation of damages is of 25 years. On these bases, the Tribunal will now proceed to
decide the largest portion of the Claimants’ claim corresponding to lost future cash flows
for the period after June 2014.

In BDO Quantum Report II, the Respondents experts submitted an alternative calculation
based on the DCF method.”® The Tribunal finds such alternative calculation unpersuasive.

The calculation proposes two alternatives for the But For scenario (i.e., prior to the
Disputed Measures): the first alternative is to apply the tariff and aspects set out in
RD 436/2004, in force at the time of the developers’ investment and construction of the
Andasol Plants. The second alternative is to consider a But For scenario, taking into
account the specifications of RD 661/2007, in force at the time of the investment by the
Claimants.

The claim before this Tribunal refers to the effects of the Disputed Measures on the
Claimants’ investment, not the developers’ investment and therefore only the second
alternative would apply. However, the second alternative presents fundamental problems
that make it unreliable.

First, BDO chose a discount rate of 7.43% in the Actual scenario (i.e., the scenario after
the Disputed Measures) and 11.3% in the But For scenario” decreasing the claim by
approximately EUR 41 million. BDO describes the But For scenario under RD 661/2007
as a fictitious high-risk scenario characterized by a context of high tariff deficit and a
significant financial imbalance of the electricity system.°*° When cross-examined on the
point during the Hearing, Mr. Perez admitted that BDO’s argument is that the Actual

°8) BDO Quantum Report I, § 5, ]240 et seg.
° BDO Quantum Report Il, | 288.
°85 BDO Quantum Report I, 285.

190

scenario has a lower risk than the But For scenario because the Disputed Measures made
the system sustainable, and under the But For scenario the risks would have been high
because the system was unsustainable.°*

720. Also in cross-examination, Mr. Perez admitted that BDO was, on the one hand, attributing

the Eurozone crisis to the But For scenario and, on the other, considering that the But For
scenario was an unbalanced and over-remunerated system that could not be compared to a
properly regulated sector.” In his view, the country risk of Spain prior to the Disputed
Measures was reflecting a situation of serious financial unbalance, while after the Disputed
Measures Spain had a more normalised situation.°**

721. The Tribunal did not find this to be convincing and his explanation at the Hearing would

mean that by wiping out the Original Regime, the Respondent became less risky and
therefore a discount rate reflecting such situation would have to apply to the Claimants’
damage calculation. The result of this conclusion would be that the discount rate that BDO.
applies to the Claimants is a discount rate resulting from a violation of the ECT.
Considering the findings of the Tribunal in this Award, this result is untenable.

722. Second, the Claimants are correct in that the treatment of leverage in BDO’s DCF

alternative model is inappropriate.°*? During his presentation (direct testimony)

Mr. Caldwell of Brattle convincingly explained that BDO is mistaken in building its DCF
model assuming a constant debt/equity ratio for project finance, where it is clear that this
ratio changes constantly as project finance is repaid.””° His explanation was not questioned
or disputed. The result of this approach proposed by BDO would be to reduce the
Claimants’ claim in approximately EUR 30 million.

723. In sum, even though BDO objected to the use of the DCF method for purposes of the

986

988

990

valuation, BDO’s quantum reports are more focused on building Spain’s case based on
Spain’s legal theories presented in this arbitration than in responding directly to the DCF
valuation presented by the Claimants. For the reasons explained elsewhere in this Award,
the RAB valuation method proposed by BDO as well as the alternative analysis proposed
by the Claimants and its response by Spain, as well as the DCF analysis submitted by the
Respondent have basically the same fundamental problem: they are based on the
Respondent’s legal theory and therefore cannot stand, given the Tribunal’s determination

on the violation of ECT Article 10. Therefore, the Tribunal was not presented by a
convincing critique of Brattle’s valuation of lost future cash flows.

On the other hand, Brattle’s quantum reports and their explanation by Brattle’s experts
during direct and cross-examination on future cash flows were sound, solid and
convincing, and the Respondent and its experts did not question the concrete assumptions
and calculations contained in Brattle’s reports in a concrete and persuasive manner, to
question then or create doubts in the Tribunal on the fundamental conclusions reached. The
Tribunal considers therefore that Brattle’s reports provide a well-reasoned and convincing
calculation of the losses incurred by the Claimants, which has not been effectively
questioned by BDO.

The value of the future cash flows presented by the Claimants is EUR 148 million to which
the Tribunal must deduct the amount of EUR 36 million corresponding to the difference
between the estimate of 35 to 40-year service of the plants, which the Tribunal considered
unsupported, and the 25-year lifetime that the Tribunal considered acceptable.”! This
results in a balance of EUR 112 million that the Tribunal finds to be a fair measure of the
Claimants’ damages. Therefore, the Claimants are entitled to an award of compensation in
the amount of EUR 112 million.

8. Other objections from the R dent on the methodology presented by the

Claimants

The Respondent and BDO complained that Brattle’s quantum reports were not transparent,
were unclear and lacked sufficient explanation.°” The Tribunal also finds this contention
unconvincing. Brattle’s quantum reports explain the assumptions and the sources of data
clearly and in detail. As to BDO’s complaint that they did not have access to the resulting
calculations, BDO accepted that it did not ask Brattle to provide its calculations, as
frequently occurs in relations between valuation experts appointed by parties in adversarial
proceedings.

The Respondent’s experts also complain about an alleged financial weakness of project
finance structures and a supposedly excessive leverage that condition the viability of the
plants, but again this reasoning seems more destined to support Spain’s legal theory on
reasonable return and BDO’s argument on the advantages of the RAB methodology than
to question the DCF model presented by the Claimants.

%! Brattle Quantum Report II, XII, Appendix A, Table 14,
°2 See BDO Quantum Report I, | 244.

192

728. BDO also considers that there is a disproportion between the alleged investment (and the

supposedly assumed risk) and the claimed sum.”> Moreover, BDO claims that the
investment is speculative because of the price paid and the plans to sale the investment in
2017 (which sale effectively took place).?”* However, these arguments were not developed
by the Respondent and, particularly, there is no support as to why the structure is
speculative and what is the impact of such a structure in the nature of the investment and
on the rights of the investor and the protection of the investment under the ECT.

729. The Tribunal finds the above-referenced contentions unpersuasive and unsupported and

therefore concludes that they do not lead the Tribunal to adjust its decision on quantum.

9. Interest

730. The Claimants request that the Tribunal award both pre-award and post-award interest on

the amounts due.” The Claimants argue that the Tribunal may, in its discretion, and indeed
should in the circumstances, adopt different rates for pre-award and post-award interest
since they serve different purposes. According to the Claimants, this distinction arises for
public policy reasons. While pre-award interest is solely concerned with achieving full
reparation, post-award interest is generally awarded to achieve wider policy-based goals.°”*

731. According to the Claimants, in the present case, pre-award interest should follow the

concept of full reparation and a rate that affords full reparation and that is a “commercial
rate established on a market basis” within the meaning of the ECT is Spain’s borrowing
rate (based on the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds), which for the relevant period is 2.07%,
compounded monthly.””” For post-award interest, the Claimants consider that since it
serves the dual purpose of ensuring prompt compliance and preventing unjust enrichment,
the Tribunal should order post-award interest at a rate higher than 2.07%, which should
also be compounded on a monthly basis.”

732. In BDO’s Quantum Report II, the Respondent’s experts agree that the interest rate on

Spanish government bonds is the rate that should be used to calculate interest prior to the
Award.°”” However, BDO considers that it is not appropriate to use the yield of 10-year
Spanish government bonds (2.07%) to calculate the aforementioned interest rate, given the

Respondent’s Counter-Memorial, 1949.

estimated day for the decision, but a rate equal to the 2-year yield on Spanish bonds should
be used, which as of 20 June 2014 was 0.60%.'°

Taking account of the positions of the Parties, the Tribunal agrees with the Claimants that
a “commercial rate established on a market basis” within the meaning of the ECT is Spain’s
borrowing rate (based on the yield on Spanish 10-year bonds), which for the relevant period
is 2.07%, compounded monthly. However, the Tribunal does not agree that it should order
post-award interest at a rate higher than 2.07% in the present case. The Respondent has an
international obligation to comply with this Award in a timely manner. Imposing a higher
post-award interest rate to ensure prompt compliance with the Award would imply that
there are reasons to believe that the State will not fulfil its international obligation to
comply promptly. In the absence of such reasons, the Tribunal believes that a higher post-
award interest rate is not justified.

The Tribunal therefore awards interest from 20 June 2014 to the date of this Award at the
rate of 2.07%, compounded monthly and considers that the same rate of 2.07%
compounded monthly should be sufficient to incentivise payment of the Award in the
present case. Therefore, the Tribunal awards interest from the date of the Award to the date
of payment at the rate of 2.07%, compounded monthly.

COSTS

A. CLAIMANTS’ POSITION

The Claimants request that the Tribunal order the Respondent to bear the costs of this
arbitration, as well as the Claimants’ cost for legal representation, in the amount of
GBP 4.364.062,46.'°"' Further, the Claimants argue that they should not be liable for any
of the Respondent’s arbitration or representation costs. !°°

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal has broad discretion with respect to the allocation
of costs and that it should exercise such discretion to make an award on costs in their
favour, considering that (i) the Respondent committed several breaches of its obligations
under the ECT in relation to the Claimants’ investment, and (ii) the Respondent’s
jurisdictional challenges lacked merit.!°°

Cc TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides as follows:

“Tn the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how and
by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre
shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.”

The Tribunal considers —and the Parties do not seem to dispute— that this provision gives
the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration, including attorney’s fees and
other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate. These costs include (i) the costs
of the proceedings (fees and expenses of the Tribunal, and the Centre’s administrative fees
and direct expenses); and (ii) the legal representation costs and other expenses incurred by
the Parties in connection with the arbitration.

The costs of the proceedings, including fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s
administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to USD 1,059,052.84, disaggregated as
follows:

 

 

 

 

 

Fees and expenses of the Tribunal 703,362.51
ICSID’s administrative fees 138,000
Direct expenses 217,690.33
Total 1,059,052.84

 

 

 

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by the Parties in equal parts.

In exercising the discretion described in paragraph 741 above, the Tribunal considers that
the distribution of costs should be made considering the relative success of the claims and
defences of each of the Parties, together with the circumstances of the case and the conduct
of the Parties in the proceedings.

. The Respondent submitted four jurisdictional objections, three of which were rejected by

the Tribunal. Accordingly, the Claimants largely prevailed on jurisdiction. Similarly, the
Claimants established a breach of the FET standard under the ECT and proved that they
had suffered damages as a result thereof. However, the Tribunal did not accept all elements
of the Claimants’ claims and awarded a lesser amount in compensation than that claimed.

196

746. The Tribunal deems that the costs incurred by the Parties in connection with the arbitration

were reasonable considering the circumstances of the case and the features of the
proceedings.

747. In view of the above, the Tribunal concludes that the Respondent shall bear its own legal

XL

representation costs and expenses. The Respondent shall also pay 60% of the costs of the
proceedings (that is, USD 635,431.70 out of USD 1,059,052.84) and 60% of the Claimants’
legal representation costs and expenses, which include the Claimants’ legal costs and
related disbuserments; the Claimants’ expert fees and related disbursements, and other
disbursements incurred by the Claimants (that is, GBP 2,447,008.61 out of
GBP 4,078,347.68).!07

DECISION

748. For the reasons set forth in this Award, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:

1007

(a) The Tribunal has jurisdiction under the ECT and the ICSID Convention over the
Claimants’ claims, except with respect to the alleged violations of the ECT arising
