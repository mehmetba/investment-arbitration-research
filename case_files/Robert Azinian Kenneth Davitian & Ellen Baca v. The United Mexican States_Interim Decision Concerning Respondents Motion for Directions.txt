GENERAL OUTLINE OF THE PROCEEDINGS TO DATE

 

1. On 24 ber 1996, the Clai sent to the Respondent a “Preliminary
Notice of Intention to File a Claim and Consent of Investors" which recited that it was
made “under Part 5, Chapter 11, Subchapter B of NAFTA as a result of an
expropriation of a business venture by the City of Naucalpan de Juarez, Estado de
Mexico and against the Federal Government of Mexico.” The Claimants thereby
explicitly waived their rights to “further court or administrative proceedings regarding
this clairn pursuant to [NAFTA] Article 1121(1) and (2).”

2. ‘A more detailed document from the Claimants entitled “Notice of Inteat to
Submit a Claim to Arbitration” was T ived by the Respond on 10D ib
1996; on 16 December, it received a slightly modified version, entitled "Amended

 

Notice of Intent to Submit a Claim to Arbitration."

3. By 3 Notice of Claim dated 10 March 1997, the Claimants requested ICSID to
approve and register their application for access to the ICSID Additional Facility, and
submitted their claim to arbitration under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules.

4. On 24 March 1997, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID informed the
Parties that the requirements of Article 4(2) of the ICSID Additions! Facility Rules
had been fulfilled and that the Claimants’ application for access to the Additional
Facility was approved, and issued a Certificate of Registration of the case.

"5, Following nominations in due course, the Acting Secretary-General of ICSID

* informed the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal was “deemed to have been constituted
and the proceedings to have begun" on 9 July 1997, and that Mr Alejandro A.
Escobar, Counsel, ICSID, would serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

6. The first session of the Tribunal was heid, with the Parties’ agreement, in
Washington on 26 September 1997. It resulted in further agreement on & number of

procedural matters reflected in written minutes signed by the President and Secretary
of the Tribunal.

THE PRELIMINARY ISSUE

7. In the course of informal oral presentations on the occasion of the first session
of the Tribunal on 26 September 1997, the Respondent indicated that it had doubts as
10 the standing of the Claimants which should be resolved before consideration of the

merits.

8. Accordingly, it was agreed (under point 12 of the Minutes of that session) that
the Respondent would submis a wrimen motion regarding the issuc of the Claimants'
standing, to which the Claimants would be given an opportunity to reply, with a
further opportunity for the Respondent to respond.

9. The Parties’ pleadings in thie particular matter have thus been as follows:

6 October 1997: the Respondent's "Motion for Directions" (hereafter "the
Motion")

S November 1997: the Claimants’ "Reply to Motion for Directions"
(hereafter "the Reply")

42 December 1997: the Respondent's Response (hereafter "the Response”)

_ THE PARTIES' CONTENTIONS

Issues Raised

10. The Motion calls upon the Claimants to “establish their standing" and “clarify
the basis of their claim," failing which, it contends, the claim should be dismissed
with prejudice, ©

 

 

 

TRE 8 1 POjPFPM WB TESTER LELDS 0144564456 neg7g: = 2444

@ 11. According two the Motion, there are two “purported corporate entities" that
have the same name, date of incorporation and notarial deed number “as the

‘euterprise’ referred to in the Notice of Claim and other pleadings," and that 4 third

corporate entity with "substantially the same name” appears to have become the

assignee of the concession at the heart of the substantive dispute. None of the

Claimants is identified as a shareholder in the latter; as for the rwo others, neither

appears to have all the Claimants among its shareholders. This is said to create

uncertainty as to the Claimants' standing, compounded by confusion as to whether

e their claims are direct (i.e, under NAFTA Article 1116) or derivative (ie. under

| NAFTA Article 1117, atising by virtue of alleged oss and damage suffered by the

| corporate entity).

| 12, Moreover, the Motion queries whether the two "purported corporate entities
that have the same name, date of incorporation and notarial deed numbers" were duly
e@ incorporated, and whether they so remained at times’ material for the purposes of this

arbitration.

13. In summary, the Motion contends that the Claimants must demonstrate:

"@) for each of them, their standing to invoke Section B
e of Chapter Eleven;

i) if they have such standing, whether they are
advancing a claim under Article 1116 for damages
each of them suffered as investors or whether the
claim is made under Article 1117;

(iii) if the claim is being asserted under Article 1117,
whether it is being asserted by the investor who
owns or controls the enterprise; and

(iv) in either event, that the emerprise which any of
them ¢Jaim to own or control, or in which any of
them claim to have an equity security or other
interest was, at the material times, a valid and
subsisting corporate entity, duly incorporated under

e@ applicable Mexican law.”

@ 14. The Motion also states that it is critical, if the case is initiated under Article
1117, that the enterprise alleged to have been harmed "has validly authorised the

submission of the claim to arbitration."
The Motion

15, The Respondent's own analysis of these issues is as follows (paragraphs 16

through 19).
e@ 16. The three claimants have, in their three Notices (described in paras. 1-3)
identified themselves as "U.S. I * who collectively "own and control 74% of

 

 

Desechos Solidos de Naucalplan, S.A. de C.V." (DESONA). The same Notices
identify the latter as the “EB: ise." The Clai have purported to ad a
claim under Article 1116 of the NAFTA (Claim by an Investor ... on its Own Behal/)
and only in the alternative under Article 1117 (Claim by an Investor ... on Behalf of

e an Enterprise). But the basis of their claim is the nullification of a concession granted
to “a company called DESONA,” and the Motion asserts that no claim can therefore
be advanced under Article 1116.

 

“ 17, The Motion further notes that the Claimants have alleged that they were all
e shareholders in DESONA, which they say was incorporated “as evidenced in public
deed nuraber 6,477 dated November 4, 1992, granted before Notary Public number 7
for the District of Cuantit4n Izealli.”. But according to the Motion, there were two
versions of DESONA evidenced by the same deed mumber 6,477, and moreover there
- 4s another entity called "DESONA 1" which the Claimants’ Amended Notice of Intent
“explains, at para. 7, was incorporated “pursuant to erroneous instructions given by
officials of Naucalpan,"

18. The Respondent has located and produced before the Arbitral Tribunal two
public deeds granted on 4 November 1992 by the same Notary Public and bearing the
e@ mumber 6,477. In one of these, Robert Azinian is listed as a 54% shareholder but

*&

neither of the other two Claimants appear. In the other Robert Azinian is again listed
as 2.54% shareholder, Kenneth Davitian as a 20% shareholder, but the third Claimant
Gillen Baca) does not appear.

19. The concession was in fact “transferred” to DESONA 1. Since none of the
Claimants appears in the public record as a shareholder of DESONA 1, the enterprise
which “under Mexican law actually held the concession," the Motion concludes that
none of the Claimants is an investor (within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139)
emtisled to bring these proceedings, and at any rate none has a stake in the Enterprise
for the purpose of bringing a case under Article 1117.

The Reply

20. The Claimants' Reply begins by noting that the NAFTA does not require an
election between Articles 1116 and 1117.

21. As to Article 1116, the Reply disputes the Respondent's suggestion that only

the original incorporators of DESONA could qualify as “investors” on the basis of
“Article 1139's broad definition of investment."
22. As to Article 1117, the Reply maintains that the Claimants’ Notices:

"delineates both the investors and the enterprise itself,

and contains the requisite authority for counsel to

proceed respectively on behalf of the investors and on

behalf of the enterprise.” (p. 3)
23. Accordingly the Reply proceeds to demonstrate that in the Claimants’
Submission each of them:
- is a US national;

- bas made an investment in Mexico;

 

 

 

 

JAN 23 796 G6:

RESAPIELDS 0144564456 N28791

- owns, controls, and has "an interest in the enterprise and its concession
contract,” and

- “would have shared In the profits of the enterprise."

24. Inthe case of Ellen Baca, Mr Davitian represents (Exhibit C of the Reply) that
he “assigned my stock interest in the concession to her by corporate assignemnt on
Dec. 15th 1993;" she confirms (Exhibit D) that “he transferred to me 1000 shares" of
DESONA at that date.

25. As for. DESONA, the Reply explains that the entity as initially contemplated,
which it atyles “DESONA A," was “a draft of the corporation which was never
perfected by incorporation and registration.” (p. 8) The entity registered in
November 1992 with both Messrs Azinian and Davitian as shareholders, which the
Reply refers to as "DESONA B," is therefore the relevant enterprise. DESONA 1,
lished tht feree of

for its part, was at one time i to be asap

DESONA B's concession rights, but nothing came of it.

26. With the Reply, the Claimants submit inter alia what they say is the "Contrato
de constitucion" of DESONA B contained in public deed mumber 6,477 (Exhibit J).
They also submit the signature page of the contract which has given rise to this
dispute (Exhibit F), bearing the signature Mr Azinian as Chairman of the Board of
Directors of DESONA B, as well as a copy of the Decree by which DESONA B was
approved as concessionaire (Exhibit H).

27. ‘The Reply concludes (p. 11) that since the NAPTA does not require an
election between Articles 1116 and 1117, since the NAFTA definition of “investor” is
not limited to incorporators, and since the Claimants have shown thar DESONA 5
was lawfully formed, the case should now proceed to the merits.

The Response
28. The Response challenges the adequacy of the Reply in several respects.

29. First, it asserts that the Motion was not intended to force the Claimants to
make an el Tather, it questi the Clai ding in ion with the
specific claim(s) they advance.

30, Second, the fact that Mr Davitian transferred his shares to Ms Baca in
December 1993 means, or so the Response contends, that he is not an "investor" for
NAFTA purposes.

31, Third, the Response argues that the Reply reveals thet part of Mr Azinian's
claim proceeds on the footing that he is partly proceeding as an assignee of the
interest in DESONA B of Mr Ariel Goldenstein, who is not a claimant (and could not
be, as a non-US citizen); the Response considers that such a surrogate clair would
circumvent the NAFTA, and that "Mr Azinian's shareholding in DESONA should be
Counted as at the date the concession was nullificd." (pars, 19)

32. Fourth, the Response suggests that Messrs Azinian and Davitian seek to laya
foundation for claims in their capacity as lenders or capital contributors to DESONA.
Such claims, it maintains, are without the agreement to arbitrate as created pursuant
to the NAFTA and the Notice put forward in this case, which relates only to a claim
which “focuses on the alleged de facto expropriation of DESONA" (para. 23)

33. Fifth, the Response argues that the Claimants’ description of DESONA as the
only relevant entity is belied by the fact that the municipal council of Nauealpan
believed it was dealing with DESONA A; it did not request and obtain documentation
concerning DESONA B until February 1994. The various exhibits to the Reply show
corporate actions taken by DESONA without any evidence of which version (A or B)
was involved. As she is unable to show that DESONA B was the concessionaire,

 

P. torte

 

 

 

~ 229

Ms Ellen Baca must be denied standing as a claimant, given that she has never
appeared as a shareholder in DESONA A.

DIRECTIONS BY THE ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL

34, The pleadings summarised above raise a number of complex issues which may
have the effect of restricting the competence of the Tribunal. Nevertheless, they seem
unlikely to eliminate altogether the need to consider the merits. In considering
whether anything would be gained by making definitive interim determinations with
respect to any of these issues, the Tribunal has been rmaindful of the following factors:

35. (A) There are some matters of fact and law about which the Tribunal would
be likely to ask for additional submissions before deciding any of the issues raised by
the Motion. In other words, they do not appear mature for decision at this stage.
Moreover, a special hearing could be required. The more particular circumstances
considered in paragraphs 36-39 suggest. that little would be gained = while time and
costs would be expended ~ by attempting to examine these issues in such a fashion

before considering the merits.

36. (B) If it is true that part of Mr Azinian's claim is made by him as an
impermissible surrogate for Mr Goldenstein, that may be determined by the Arbitral
Tribunal at a later stage. It would affect the quantum, but not Mr Azinian's standing
pro se.

37. (C) If it is true that Mr Davitian was not a shareholder at the material
time(s), this might defeat his standing but would not obviate consideration of the
merits; nor would, it seems, his provisional presence as a claimant complicate the
facts to be tried on the merits.

38. (@) If it is true that Messrs Azinian and Davitian are seeking to introduce
claims outside the Arbitral Tribunal's jurisdiction as established by the NAFTA and

@ the various Notices articulated in this case, the Tribunal can algo deal with that in due
course, ¢.g., in dismissing claims that are in effect ultra perita.

39. (BE) Whatever may be said about DESONA A and DESONA B, neither of
them is a claimant. The complications relating to the incorporation, formal actions,
and treatment by Mexican administrative and judicial authorities of DESONA (in any
of its alleged versions) seem to be part and parcel of the merits, it being noted that the
Claimants have identified the entity harmed by the allegedly wrongful actions of the
Respondent as the one they define (see paragraphs 25-26) as “DESONA B."

40, Accordingly, the Tribunal directs the parties to proceed in accordance with
para. 14 of the minutes of the first session as since adjusted, so that the Claimants’
full Memorial is lodged on 29 January 1998, the Respondent's Counter-Memorial 90
days later. The Arbitral Tribunal expects the Claimants’ Memorial to be particularly
attentive to the matters reflected in paras. 36°39 above.
