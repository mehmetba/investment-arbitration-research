INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This arbitration concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) pursuant to (i) the
Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Lithuania and the
Government of the Republic of Latvia on the Promotion and Protection of
Investments dated 7 February 1996, which entered into force on 23 July 1996 (the
“BIT” or “Treaty”) and (ii) the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force on 14 October

1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).”

The Claimant is UAB E energija (Lithuania) (“E energija” or the “Claimant”). It is a
limited liability company established under the laws of the Republic of Lithuania and
incorporated in Lithuania.> E energija carries out business in the energy sector and
has, in particular, a number of concessions for central heating services in Lithuania,

Ukraine and Latvia.

E energija indirectly owns 58% of the shares in SIA Latgales Energija (“Latgales
Energija”), a limited liability company established under the laws of the Republic of
Latvia and incorporated in Latvia.* E energija incorporated Latgales Energija as the
entity through which it would invest in the concession for district heating in the

Latvian city of Rézekne (the “Rézekne Project”).
The Respondent is the Republic of Latvia (“Latvia” or the “Respondent’).

The Claimant and the Respondent are hereinafter collectively referred to as the
“Parties”. The Parties’ respective representatives and their addresses are listed in

page (i) above.

The dispute relates to the rights asserted by the Claimant under the BIT against the

Republic of Latvia in connection with the Rézekne Project.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On 15 August 2012 ICSID received a request for arbitration from the Claimant
against the Republic of Latvia, together with Exhibits C-1 through C-33 and Legal
Authorities CLA-1 through CLA-22 (the “Request” or “RfA”).

On 15 October 2012 the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request, as
supplemented by letters dated 14 September 2012, 4 October 2012 and 10 October
2012, in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the
Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited
the Parties to proceed to constitute a Tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with
Rule 7(d) of the Centre’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and

Arbitration Proceedings.

In the absence of an agreement between the Parties, the Claimant elected to submit
the arbitration to a three-member Tribunal, as provided in Article 37(2)(b) of the
ICSID Convention.

On 8 March 2013 Mr. Samuel Wordsworth QC, a British national, accepted his

appointment by the Claimant as arbitrator.

On 22 April 2013 Prof. Dr. August Reinisch, an Austrian national, accepted his
appointment by the Chairman of the ICSID Administrative Council in accordance

with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.

On 12 June 2013 Dr. Paolo Michele Patocchi, a Swiss national, accepted his
appointment as President of the Tribunal by the Chairman of the ICSID

Administrative Council in accordance with Article 38 of the ICSID Convention.

On 12 June 2013 the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID
Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration Rules”),
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that
the Tribunal was, therefore, constituted on that date. Ms. Geraldine R. Fischer, ICSID

Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 11 September 2013 the Tribunal held a first session with the Parties in London.

The Parties confirmed that the Members of the Tribunal had been validly appointed.

It was agreed, inter alia, that: (i) the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in
effect from 10 April 2006; (ii) the procedural language would be English, and (iii) the
place of the proceedings would be London, United Kingdom. The Parties agreed on a
timetable for the jurisdictional/merits phase of the proceedings, including production
of documents. On 10 October 2013, after consultation with the Parties, the President
of the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 which embodied the Parties’
agreements on procedural matters including the procedural timetable (the

“Timetable”, Annex A to Procedural Order No. 1).

In Procedural Order No. 2 of 26 November 2013 the Tribunal modified the Timetable

further to the Claimant’s application.

On 6 December 2013 the Claimant filed a Memorial with the following supporting

documents:

e Witness Statement of Mr. Virginijus Strioga (“CWS-1”);

e Witness Statement of Mr. Aleksas Jautakis (“CWS-2”);

e Witness Statement of Ms. Svetlana Rogozina (“CWS-3”);

e Witness Statement of Ms. Evisa USkane (“CWS-4”);

e Witness Statement of Mr. Levs Voronovs (“CWS-5”);

e Expert Report on Quantum from Dr. Serena Hesmondhalgh of The
Brattle Group (“ER Hesmondhalgh I”);

e Factual Exhibits C-34 to C-215; and

e Legal Authorities CLA-23 to CLA-42.

 

On 18 April 2014 the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Preliminary Objections
(“Preliminary Objections”) and Request for Bifurcation (“Request for Bifurcation”)

and Counter-Memorial on the Merits with the following supporting documents:

e Expert Report on Valuation Quantification of Damages Prepared
by Mr. Michael Peer of KPMG Baltics SIA (“ER Peer I’);

e Factual Exhibits R-1 to R-14; and

e Legal Authorities RLA-1 to RLA-15.

In its Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation the Respondent requested

inter alia that the Tribunal stay the proceedings.

On 1 May 2014 the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal regarding the Respondent’s
submission of 18 April 2014, stating that such submission did not contain an
application for bifurcation. The Claimant further requested confirmation that the
Tribunal would proceed in accordance with the Timetable set out in Annex A of
Procedural Order No. 1 of 10 October 2013 (“Applicable Timetable if Tribunal

Decides to Join Preliminary Objections to the Merits”).

On 5 May 2014 the President of the Tribunal directed the Respondent to clarify by 12
May 2014 whether it sought bifurcation, and, if so, on what basis. The Tribunal also
directed the Claimant to answer the Respondent’s letter of 12 May 2014 as well as the

Respondent’s request for a stay of proceedings by 19 May 2014.

On 12 May 2014 the Respondent submitted its Clarificatory Statement on its Request

for Bifurcation stating that it sought bifurcation.

On 19 May 2014 the Claimant submitted its Response opposing the Respondent’s

Request for Bifurcation.

On 30 May 2014 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3 denied the Respondent’s
Request for Bifurcation and joined the Respondent’s “preliminary objections” to the
merits, stating that a further decision setting out reasons would be sent to the Parties
as soon as possible in the following weeks. The Tribunal also denied the
Respondent’s application for a stay of these proceedings pending a final and binding
decision by the courts of Latvia on Case No. C03051107. On 21 January 2015 the
Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 3bis gave reasons for its decision declining the

bifurcation and the stay of proceedings sought by the Respondent.

On 18 August 2014 the Tribunal ruled on the Parties’ requests for production of

documents in Procedural Order No. 4.

On 1 October 2014 the Tribunal decided on certain document production issues and

amended the Timetable in Procedural Order No. 5.

On 10 October 2014 the Claimant filed a Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial
on the Respondent’s Preliminary Objections with the following supporting

documents:

On 9 March 2015 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 8 confirmed the directions
given to the Parties at the Hearing with respect to the specific questions on which the

Parties were entitled to file short submissions.

On 20 March 2015 the Claimant filed its submission to answer the questions set out in
the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 8 including sixteen exhibits containing English
translations of Latvian statutes, which the Tribunal renumbered in accordance with

applicable procedural rules as follows:

e Legal Authorities CLA-46 (first translation) to CLA-61 (last

 

translation).

On the same day the Respondent filed its submission to answer the questions set out

in the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 8 with the following supporting documents:

e Fourth Expert Report on Quantification of Damages prepared by Michael
Peer of KPMG Baltics SIA (“ER Peer IV”);

e Expert Report regarding Loans and Guarantees provided in the context of

e Factual Exhibits R-22 to R-35; and

e Legal Authorities RLA-20 to RLA-39.

On 26 March 2015 the Claimant pointed out in a message to the Tribunal that the
Respondent had disregarded the terms of Procedural Orders No. 1 and No. 8 by
submitting new evidence with its submission of 20 March 2015. On 30 March 2015
the Claimant elaborated on its objection and requested that certain Factual Exhibits
Authorities (RLA-21, RLA-22, RLA-24, RLA-34, RLA-37 and RLA-38) be struck

On the same day the Respondent sought leave to comment on the Claimant’s
submissions dated 20 and 30 March 2015 and filed its Rebuttal Submission in
accordance with Procedural Order No. 8, together with the following supporting

documents:
e Factual Exhibits R-36 and R-37.

On 15 April 2015 the Claimant objected to the Respondent’s request to comment on
its submissions of 20 and 30 March 2015 as well as to the filing of Exhibits R-36 and
R-37.

On 13 May 2015 the Tribunal in Procedural Order No. 9 authorised the Parties to file
a short rebuttal to the submissions filed on 20 March 2015 and indicated that, upon
the filing of such rebuttal, no further submissions would be admitted. The Parties
filed their rebuttal submissions by 1 June 2015 in accordance with Procedural Order

No. 9.

On 21 October 2016 the Claimant informed ICSID that all the proceedings to which
Latgales Energija had been a party before the Latvian courts had been concluded, that
all funds that had been frozen had been paid out by the court and that Latgales

Energija had not received any amount out of such funds.

On 11 November 2016 the Respondent replied in accordance with the Tribunal’s
directions of 26 October 2016 that (i) Case No. C03051107 had been concluded by a
judgment of the Supreme Court of Latvia dated 30 November 2015 and made
available in a full version on 12 February 2016; Latgales Energija had not challenged
that judgment and therefore the Claimant had accepted the economic outcome of the
whole dispute; (ii) on 11 August 2016 the bailiff had issued the calculation regarding
the distribution of the seized funds, which was not challenged by Latgales Energija
either; the Respondent confirmed in its letter “the fact that the Claimant has not

received any amount back from the previously seized funds”;° contending that such

° However, the Respondent further stated that “the Claimant has now, after proper local adjudication,
been entitled to the previously seized funds (without prejudice to the reasonable demand that its
subsidiary shall pay out its debts, and having been given the opportunity to challenge bailiff’s actions
with regard to the current distribution of the previously seized funds)”.

circumstance could not be relied upon against it under the Treaty; and (iii) the

Respondent maintained its position on double-counting.

On 11 November 2016 the Tribunal invited further comments from the Parties limited
to five pages, and indicated that either Party was authorised to produce the 30
November 2015 judgment; the Parties’ comments were received on 6 and 19

December 2016 respectively.

On 6 December 2016 the Claimant replied that by its previous communication it had
simply intended to inform the Tribunal of the final outcome of one factual issue on
which the Parties’ experts had expressed an opinion, namely that there might be a
double recovery in case the Claimant or Latgales Energija had ever recovered part of
the frozen funds. The Claimant rejected the points made by the Respondent,
confirming that Latgales Energija had not received any funds and was not entitled to
receive any; it also provided a breakdown showing that the majority of the funds were
paid to Rézeknes Siltumtikli (more precisely EUR  1,282,246.76 out of
EUR 1,571,697.66).

On 19 December 2016 the Respondent sent its comments, to which it attached (i) the
Supreme Court judgment dated 30 November 2015 in Case No. C03051107, (ii) the
decision of the judge of the Chamber of Civil Cases of the Supreme Court dated 29
June 2016 dismissing Latgales Energija’s application for cassation filed against the 30
November 2015 judgment as well as two further exhibits. The Respondent first
summarised the Parties’ respective cases in its submission, and then commented on
the “special role attributed by the Claimant to civil case No. C03051107”. The
Respondent pointed out that the 30 November 2015 judgment decided that Latgales
Energija was under a duty to pay the full price of the natural gas supplied, and not
only to the extent of the latest natural gas tariff approved by the Regulator. As to the
allocation of Latgales Energija’s frozen funds decided by the bailiff, the figures
indicated by the Respondent are not entirely in line with those indicated by the
Claimant (according to the Respondent EUR 123,115.49 were allocated to a debt
owed to JSC Lariva, the assignee of Explicit Consulting Group  Ltd.;
EUR 1,092,006.06 to Rézeknes Siltumtikli); that was said to be a normal distribution
of the funds in enforcement proceedings and the funds were therefore to be regarded

“under the Treaty, as released from injunction to the benefit of the Claimant”. The

Respondent concluded that the Claimant by its conduct in relation to the Latvian
proceedings as a whole expressed “[its] interest and willingness to abide by the final

verdict in domestic civil procedure No. 03051107 (...)”.

On 7 September 2016 the Tribunal was informed that the Respondent was no longer
represented by Mr. Ivars Mékons but rather by Ms. Ilze Dubava and Ms. Nérika
Lizinska, legal advisers with the State Chancellery of Latvia. On 8 September 2017
the Tribunal was further informed that Mr. George Burn left Vinson & Elkins who
continued to be instructed in the present matter. The Claimant requested all future

correspondence to be addressed to Mr. Mark Beeley and Mr. Alexander Slade.
The proceedings were closed on 11 October 2017.

FACTS

In this section of the present Award the Tribunal will outline the facts of the case as
far as possible in chronological order from 2004 onwards. The facts of the case are

uncontested to a considerable extent.

HEATING IN REZEKNE AND THE 2004 GAS SUPPLY AGREEMENT (2004)

The city of Rézekne, the capital of the Latvian eastern province of Latgale, is the
seventh largest city in Latvia. It had a population of approximately 25,000 inhabitants
in 2004 when the Parties started their talks. Rézekne was then in a region with a high

unemployment rate, low wages, a negative migration rate and low economic activity.’

The Rézekne Municipality, which at the relevant time controlled the body regulating
district heating services in Rézekne, acts through its decision-making body, the
Rézekne City Council (“RCC”), comprised of local politicians appointed in local

elections.®

In Latvia the heating supply for a city, town or a district is centralized; heat and hot

water are piped directly into homes and businesses from a number of large boiler

described in the “Guidelines for the Development of the Rézekne City Heat Supply System” submitted
by Latgales Energija to the Municipality (see paragraph 164 below), C-44 pp. 6-9.

houses. District heating providers owned and controlled by the local municipalities
and having the status of municipality undertakings supply heating to consumers and
small businesses. The heating provider in any one region enjoys a monopoly in the

supply of district heating.°

In 2004 the heating system ran on black oil and diesel. These were amongst the most

expensive fuels used for district heating in Latvia.!°

The Ministry of Economy of the Republic of Latvia had confirmed the need to switch
from those fuels to natural gas and develop the infrastructure required in order for

natural gas to be used.!!

Heating prices (“tariffs”) were regulated by the State in order to protect the interest of

users. !

The body in charge of setting tariffs for district heating services for the territory of
Rézekne was the Multi-Industry Public Utility Regulator of the Latgale Municipalities
(the “Regulator”) at all relevant times for the purposes of these proceedings. The
Regulator had been established by 31 Municipalities and had started to work in late
August 2002.'3

The tariff in force when the heating system was leased to Latgales Energija in spring
2005 was LVL 21.50/MWh for residents and LVL 22.26/MWh for other users! in

accordance with the Regulator’s decision No. 9 dated 10 November 2003.!°

Prior to 2015, district heating and hot water had been provided by AS Rézeknes
Siltumtikli (“Rézeknes Siltumtikli”), a public limited liability company!® wholly
owned by the Rézekne Municipality.!”

Rézeknes Siltumtikli had been operating the system at a loss, and, by mid-2004, it
was in default with respect to its obligations to suppliers. The system was “highly

subsidized and economically inefficient’
Siltumtikli took out loans from AS “Latvijas Unibanka” (“Latvijas Unibanka”)”° and
AS “Baltic Trust Bank”?! (“Baltic Trust Bank”). The loans were secured by pledges
granted by Rézeknes Siltumtikli and the Municipality over their real estate.??_ There
was a risk that Rézeknes Siltumtikli might be unable to ensure the supply of heating

services during the heating season of September 2004-May 2005.75

On 29 April 2004 the Rézekne Municipality, Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Latvijas Gaze
entered into a long-term gas supply agreement (the “Gas Supply Agreement”)** for a
twenty-year period (Clause 19.2 of the Gas Supply Agreement). Under the terms of

the agreement the Rézekne Municipality undertook to purchase and pay a minimum

proceedings it brought before the Latvian courts, as noted by the Supreme Court of Latvia in its decision
of 7 April 2014, R-8 11.

concession of the Lessor’s heating supply resources and whereas the tender
were revoked, which resulted in insufficient amount of funds at the
Lessor’s disposal in the heating season 2004/2005 to settle accounts with its
existing creditors, as well as to be able to provide fully-fledged heating supply
services in the administrative territory of the Rézekne city municipality.

quantity of natural gas each year (namely 87.5% of 24 million nm? per year),”> and a

failure to pay was sanctioned by a contractual penalty.”°

Clause 8.3 of the Gas Supply Agreement provides that payments for the natural gas

are made by the Municipality.

Clause 16.1 of the Gas Supply Agreement expressly states that the Municipality’s
liability under the terms of the agreement is maintained in case the Municipality were
“to authorise the User or another person to perform all the obligations or (...) part [of

them] on behalf of the [Rézekne] Municipality”.

In addition to the typical sale and purchase obligations in a gas supply agreement, the
Gas Supply Agreement contains further provisions relating to the infrastructure
required to use natural gas. Paragraph D of the preamble states that one of the
purposes of the agreement “... is [the] gasification of the City of Rézekne requested
by RPD [the Rézekne Municipality] and the User ...”. More specifically, Latvijas
Gaze undertook in Clause 2.2 to “make all necessary investments in a new natural gas
supply infrastructure” up to the City borders. The Gas Supply Agreement further
provides in Clause 2.4 that Rézeknes Siltumtikli will for its part build “gas pipes and
equipment regulating gas pressure” from its boiler house facade to the consumers’ or

other users’ places.

THE ORIGINAL ARRANGEMENTS AND MAIN EVENTS (END OF 2004-2005)

(1) THE DECISION BY THE REZEKNE MUNICIPALITY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO A
FOREIGN INVESTOR IN ORDER TO PROVIDE HEATING SERVICES (2004)

In early 2004 the Rézekne Municipality called for tenders to improve the quality and

the efficiency of the district heating system. Aside from a few indications in

Mr. Strioga’s first Witness Statement,’ the record contains limited information in this

respect. Bidders were to submit their bids by 30 March 2004, 2:00 p.m.; the bid

opening would take place two hours later.?* The committee in charge would hold a

closed session on the following day to select a bidder.”’ It is common ground that, in

the end, no suitable candidate emerged.*?

The Rézekne Municipality then entered into direct negotiations with E energija and

two Latvian companies, R.S. and SIA Wesemann.*!

On 3 August 2004 the Rézekne City Council adopted resolution No. 199 which
authorised Rézeknes Siltumtikli to lease out its fixed assets, that is the heating
infrastructure, for a long-term period “taking into consideration the current actual and

financial status of joint stock company Rézeknes Siltumtikli (...)”.**

On 25 November 2004 Mr. Strioga, and Mr. Arnoldas Burkovskis, E energija’s CFO,
gave a presentation to the Rézekne City Council.*? The purpose of the presentation
was to persuade the Council that the privatization of the heating system was the better

option.*#

The presentation addressed in particular the investment that would be required as a
matter of urgency, in an amount of EUR 7.7 million.*> In his witness statement
Mr. Strioga indicated that such investment “would have been made within 5 years
(2006-2011)”; the investment was divided into three phases, the third phase being so-

called cogeneration.*°

The presentation further dealt with Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s financial situation,
including debts in an amount of LVL 1,190,000 and the aid from EU structural funds,

which was regarded as insufficient.*” The involvement of an investor was presented

as one possible solution, subject to a number of different commercial and legal

arrangements.

E energija’s own proposal for the Rézekne City Council completed the presentation.
According to such proposal Rézeknes Siltumtikli could lease its heating infrastructure
to E energija for a period of 20 to 30 years, in consideration of E energija’s
undertaking to invest an amount from EUR 10 to 12 million in the same period.
Alternatively, the lease could relate to Rézeknes Siltumtikli as a whole: “lease of RS
property or lease of RS itself (lease of business)”.** The heating price would be

reduced to 21.15 LVL/MWh from March 2005.°°

E energija would undertake to review the heat price taking into account changes only
in the prices of gas, electricity and water as well as the impact of changes in inflation
and taxation. E energija would further assume Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s debts and treat
them as rent payment. Upon expiry of the lease the value of the heating infrastructure
to be returned to Rézeknes Siltumtikli would not be less than the value at the start of

the lease period.*°

(2) THE INCORPORATION OF LATGALES ENERGIJA (20 DECEMBER 2004)
Latgales Energija was incorporated on 20 December 2004 as a limited liability
company having its registered office in Riga, Latvia.*!

(3) THE GUARANTEE AGREEMENT (30 DECEMBER 2004)

The renegotiation of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s debts took place in the latter part of 2004

and required a number of meetings and discussions.”

On 30 December 2004 E energija (as the “Guarantor’”) entered into a Guarantee

Agreement with AS “Latvijas Unibanka” (“Latvijas Unibanka”, as the “Creditor”)

(the “Guarantee Agreement”)* to provide “guarantee and security” with respect to the
obligations arising under the “Main Agreements” entered into by Rézeknes Siltumtikli
and Latvijas Unibanka. The bank held security over Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s assets and
would not permit them to be leased without adequate security being provided, as

explained by Mr. Strioga and Mr. Jautakis.*

The amounts stated to be owed by Rézeknes Siltumtikli as of the time of the
execution of the Guarantee Agreement arose under different loans or credit lines, for a
total amount of LVL 2,536,256. E energija undertook to guarantee such debts,
unconditionally and irrevocably, having waived its right to demand that the Creditor

should first assert its right to payment as against Rézeknes Siltumtikli as the Debtor.*°

The amount set out above corresponded to both Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s short-time
debts to Latvijas Unibanka mentioned in Clause 4.4.3(a) of the Long-Term
Agreement and Rézeknes Siltumttkli’s long-time debts to Latvijas Unibanka
mentioned in Clause 4.4.4(a) of the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraphs 88 and 89

below).

The Guarantee Agreement related also to the obligations of the Rézekne City Council
as the guarantor with respect to the credit agreements mentioned in Clauses 1.6 and

1.7 of the Guarantee Agreement.

43 C-43. The Guarantee Agreement is set out in two-column format with the English and the Latvian
texts in parallel; in case of discrepancies between the two texts, the English v n shall prevail
according to Clause 4.6. The Guarantee Agreement is stated to be governed by the laws of the Republic
of Latvia (Clause 4.3).

were “taken over” by Latgales Energija in due course, see paragraph 88 below.

 

 

The breakdown of the total amount was as follows:

(4) | THE AGREEMENT FOR LEASE, RENOVATION AND OPERATION OF LONG-
TERM ASSETS (28 JANUARY 2005) (THE “LONG-TERM AGREEMENT”)
A draft agreement was reviewed by representatives of Rézeknes Siltumtikli, the

Rézekne City Council and Latgales Energija on 27 January 2005.4”

On 28 January 2005 an agreement entitled “Agreement for Lease, Renovation and
Operation of Long-Term Assets” was signed by Rézeknes Siltumtikli (as the
“Lessor”) and Latgales Energija (as the “Operator”) (the “Long-Term Agreement”).*®
The Long-Term Agreement is stated to be governed by the laws of the Republic of
Latvia (Clause 11.1). The signature of the Long-Term Agreement had been
authorised on the same day by Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s Council upon the Board’s

request.”

The first clause in the recitals of the Long-Term Agreement recalls the resolution of
the Rézekne City Council to “allow Rézeknes Siltumtikli to lease out its fixed assets
for a long-term period”. The second clause in the recitals of the same agreement

mentions Latgales Energi

 

s readiness and willingness “to modernise the heating
supply system” and enable “a transfer from heavy oil fuel to natural gas as a resource
for heating energy production”, “increase effectiveness of use of energy resources”

and “fulfil the obligations of AS Rézeknes Siltumtikli against its creditors”.©°
The subject-matter of the Long-Term Agreement is set out in Clause 2.2 as follows:*!

2.2 The subject of the Agreement shall be lease of the Assets and
investment into the Assets located in the city of Rézekne and currently

Baltic Trust Bank in an amount of LVL 680,817.

Latgales Energija further undertook to take over all of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s

employees (set out in Appendix 3) in accordance with Latvian Law.™

Clause 6 of the Long-Term Agreement deals with Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s rights and

obligations in some further detail.

Clause 7 of the Long-Term Agreement deals with Latgales Energija’s rights and
obligations in some further detail; in particular Latgales Energija undertook to invest
not less than EUR 1.5 million in the heat supply facilities within three years of the
date on which the Long-Term Agreement had entered into force in order to ensure
that Rézeknes Siltumtikli could perform the duties owed to Latvijas Gaze and

undertaken under the Gas Supply Agreement® (Clause 7.1.1), and to increase its

share capital to LVL 500,000 within two weeks of the entry into force of the Long-
Term Agreement (Clause 7.7).

Clause 8 deals with Latgales Energija’s position as the Operator in relevant part as

 

follows:97
8.1 For the period the Agreement is valid, the Operator shall remain to be
the exclusive heat supplier and shall undertake to supply heat and
power energy to all the consumers who used to be supplied heat and
power by means of the Assets leased according to the Agreement
before the moment such Agreement has been signed.
8.2 The Operator shall supply heat and power to the consumers and service

heat, power and hot water supply systems following the technological
obligations of the Operator stated by the laws. The order and
conditions for servicing heat and power energy supply and systems of
each consumer shall be defined in the agreement for supply of heat and
power energy, consumption and payment to be signed with each
consumer.

The Long-Term Agreement would enter into force provided that the conditions
precedent in Clause 12.4 were met, including the execution of an agreement between
the Municipality and Latgales Energija relating to the performance of the Long-Term
Agreement in accordance with Clause 12.4.3 (this agreement was entered into on 10

February 2005, see paragraph 100 below).

The Long-Term Agreement contains express terms under which each party is entitled
to terminate it unilaterally, provided that certain requirements are met. Clause 12.5.2

deals with unilateral termination by Rézeknes Siltumtikli and reads as follows:®*

12.5.2 Unilaterally by the Lessor in the event

 

a) the licence to perform Busin is revoked due to fault of the Operator,
or
b) the Operator fails without any legal grounds to make the lease

payments in the order set by the Agreement for more than three
consecutive payments (months).

In such a case the Lessor shall warn and notify the Operator in writing about
such default of the Agreement and fix the period of time of not less than 30

to cure the default, the Agreement shall be deemed to have been terminated on
the end of the term specified in such notification.

96. Clause 12.7 of the Long-Term Agreement states that neither party can terminate the
Agreement under Clauses 12.5.2 or 12.5.3 “during the period from July 1 to the end

of the heating season next year of any calendar year”.

97. Clause 12 further deals with the monetary consequences of termination under Clause

12.5.2 in Clause 12.6 which reads as follows in relevant part:

12.6 Settlement of accounts between the Parties and sanctions in case the
Agreement is terminated prior to its term set in Clause 4.2:

12.6.1 In case the Agreement is terminated on the basis of the clauses 12.5.2
or 12.5.3, the Lessor must within 30 (thirty) days from the day the
Agreement was terminated repay to the Operator all the investment the
Operator has made into the assets leased (less depreciation) and take
over all rights of claiming any consumers’ unpaid amounts to the
Operator for the nominal value of such debts (including interest and
penalties) having accumulated within one year prior to the date of
termination of the Agreement.

12.6.2 In the event the Lessor terminates the Agreement on the basis of clause
12.5.2, the Operator shall pay the penalty fee to the Lessor equal to 10

Siltumtikli. As recalled in paragraph 94 above, the Long-Term Agreement itself

contemplated the execution of a contract between the Municipality and Latgales

Energija.

Under the February 2005 Agreement Latgales Energija undertook inter alia the

following duties to the Council:

@

(ii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

to provide centralized heating supply services in the city of Rézekne (Clause

1.1);

to maintain and repair where required the heating supply system to ensure

good-quality heating supply services (Clause 1.2);

to coordinate the reconstruction work relating to the heating infrastructure and
to start construction work after obtaining the permit required to that effect

(Clause 1.3);

to take any steps as may be required, as soon as possible, to obtain the
production, distribution and transfer licences from the competent authority

(Clause 1.4);

to ensure that rates would be increased only due to force majeure or as a result
of an increase in the prices of gas, electricity, water or other energy sources,
provided that such increase had resulted in an increase of 5% in the costs of
production, distribution or transfer of one unit of thermal energy, unless
otherwise provided by law, rates to be adjusted in any event in accordance

with Latvian law (Clause 1.6); and,

to perform its obligations to the creditors of Rézeknes Siltumtikli mentioned in

the Long-Term Agreement (Clause 1.7).

In the February 2005 Agreement the Rézekne City Council undertook inter alia the

following duties to Latgales Energija:

73 C-8 [page 8], first whereas clause.

22

@ not to hinder performance of the Long-Term Agreement by Latgales Energija

(Clause 2.2) and,

(ii) in accordance with Latvian law, to take all decisions required so that Latgales
Energija could perform the Long-Term Agreement fully and without delay
(Clause 2.8).

103. Among the terms setting out the Rézekne City Council’s duties to Latgales Energija,

Clause 2.10 reads as follows in relevant part:”*

2.10 The Operator is and remains the only supplier of centralised heating to
all consumers who received thermal energy from the Lessor at the
moment that the Agreement is concluded. The Operator has the
excusive rights to sell and supply centralised heating to residents,
industrial consumers and cooperatives of residential houses in the city
of Rézekne. The Council undertakes not to adopt decisions and not to
perform direct or indirect activities that would cause direct or indirect
competition to the Operator’s business in relation to the centralised
heating supply and maintenance and servicing the heating supply
networks, or any other operation undertaken by the Operator under the
Agreement.

The Council undertakes to ensure that the municipality functions
determined by the law with regard to provision of centralised heating
services are not transferred to other persons and the municipality would
not get involved in other projects of centralised heating supply,
including installation of co-generation stations (...).

 

104. | The February 2005 Agreement refers also to the Gas Supply Agreement” in Clause 4

which reads as follows in relevant part:”°

4. The parties agree that the Operator is entitled to enter an agreement
with AS “Latvijas Gaze” on performance of Gas Purchase Agreement
No 1580 [the Gas Supply Agreement, C-40]. If the mentioned
agreement with AS “Latvijas Gaze” is not entered and transfer to gas
heating is delayed due to the Council or third party fault resulting in
failure of AS “Latvijas Gaze” to finish construction of natural gas
infrastructure and preparation for operation in compliance with Gas
Purchase Agreement No 1580, the Council undertakes to compensate
the Operator for the losses incurred because the Operator keeps using
black fuel oil instead of natural gas after the date when the natural gas
infrastructure had to be constructed and prepared for operation in
production of thermal energy under Gas Purchase Agreement No 1580
in the wording in force at the date of entering the Agreement.

In any case the Council is not released from obligations undertaken by
Gas Purchase Agreement No 1580 on purchase of a specified amount
of gas for the needs of the city of Rézekne, and respectively — if these
obligations are not performed and AS “Latvijas Gaze” claims damages
from the Council or the Lessor, or the Operator and/or a contractual
penalty, the Council undertakes to pay AS “Latvijas Gaze” for these
losses and pay the contractual penalties.
The February 2005 Agreement further makes provision in Clause 6 for the remedies

in case of breach of contract (damages as well as a penalty).

The February 2005 Agreement was supplemented on 10 February 2006 (see
paragraphs 169 ff. below).

(6) | EENERGIJA’S FURTHER INVESTMENT IN THE CAPITAL OF LATGALES
ENERGIJA (FEBRUARY-MAy 2005)

In February 2005 E energija sold 98 out of its 200 shares in Latgales Energija to Levs

Voronovs, Juris Vanags, Martins Lauva and SIA Energo Sistémas, and its share in

Latgales Energija’s capital was reduced to LVL 10,200.””

Further capital was contributed by all shareholders and E energija made a further
contribution in an amount of EUR 300,000 and LVL 46,022.78 Asa consequence, E
energija’s share in Latgales Energija’s capital was equal to LVL 265,200 with a

majority of 2,652 shares out of 5,200 shares as of 3 May 2005.”

(7) LOANS BY E ENERGIJA TO LATGALES ENERGIA (FROM FEBRUARY 2005
ONWARDS)

E energija granted a number of loans to Latgales Energija from 18 February 2005

onwards.*’ In the year 2005, E energia granted eight loans to Latgales Energija (one

of which was increased from EUR 380,000 to EUR | million in the same year), for a

total amount of EUR 2,325,000.*!

The loans set out the borrower’s duty to repay the loan with interest; they contain no
provision as to their purpose or the manner in which the loan is to be used by the
borrower, aside from the cases in which a loan was intended to consolidate or increase
the amount of previous loans and a few other exceptions in cases where E energija
would directly pay a third party. Mr. Jautakis explained in his first Witness Statement
that E energija granted all of these loans in connection with Latgales Energija’s

obligations arising under the Long-Term and the February 2005 Agreements.*”

E energija granted three further loans to Latgales Energija in 2006,** and four further

loans, or amendments to pre-existing loans, were executed in 2007.84

(8) | REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S ASSETS AND EMPLOYEES TAKEN OVER BY
LATGALES ENERGIA (25 FEBRUARY 2005)

It is common ground that the Long-Term Agreement entered into force in February
2005. On 25 February 2005 Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Latgales Energija declared*>
that the Assets and the Employees had been transferred to Latgales Energija in

accordance with Clause 4.3.1 of the Long-Term Agreement.*°

The licences required to operate the system were granted by the Regulator on 30 May
2005 (see paragraphs 129 ff. below). The record does not, however, indicate a precise

date on which Latgales Energija started to operate the heating system.*”

After taking over the heating system, Latgales Energija provided a continuous heating

service in the city based on the tariff then in force.**

81 C51; Cl. Mem. [43 mentions an amount of LVL 1,444,532 equal to EUR 2,055,383; however, the
principal of all loans granted in 2005 is stated in EUR and the total amount is EUR 2,325,000.

The conversion of the heating system to natural gas would be ready only in November

2005 (see paragraph 156 below).

As explained by Mr. Strioga in his first Witness Statement, the old boilers were not
replaced, but modified in order that they could burn both heavy fuel oil and natural
gas, which enabled the Claimant to modernize the existing boiler houses with a
comparatively small investment. The works were implemented by UAB Energijos
Taupymo Centras (“Energijos Taupymo Centras” or “ETC”), the Claimant’s parent
company incorporated in Lithuania, together with the Russian producers of the

boilers.”

Latgales Energija did not enter into any written agreement with Rézeknes Siltumtikli
for the supply of natural gas. Nor did it succeed in entering into any agreement with
Latvijas Gaze or adhering to the Gas Supply Agreement existing between Latvijas

Gaze, the Municipality of Rézekne and Rézeknes Siltumtikli.”°

The question whether Latgales Energija has nevertheless a duty to pay for the natural
gas supplied by Latvijas Gaze is in dispute in these proceedings, as it was in dispute
in proceedings before the Latvian courts. The Tribunal’s decision on this point is set

out in paragraph 936 below.

When Latgales Energija started to supply heating in 2005, it applied the tariff that had

been granted to Rézeknes Siltumtikli before the Long-Term Agreement”! and the

° C-40, see paragraph 63 above. Latgales Energija’s unsuccessful attempts to have a direct contract
with Latvijas Gaze are referred to in Latgales Energija’s letter to the Regulator dated 28 October 2005,
C-75; then in 2006 Latvijas Gaze declined (C-88) the novation of the agreement proposed by Latgales
Energija (C-86).

According to Mr. Strioga’s first Witness Statement (CWS-1 {| 20), the Municipality was under a
contractual duty to take or pay a minimum amount of 21 million nm* a year under the Gas Supply
Agreement (C-40, Clause 3.1) in consideration for the large investment to be made in the heating
infrastructure and Latvijas Gaze had no interest to change its contracting parties.

 

 

 

In its judgment dated 7 April 2014 (R-8 11, see also paragraph 389 below) the Supreme Court of Latvia
referred to a finding made by the court of first instance whereby the defendant (Latgales Energija) “had
not concluded an agreement with AS 'Latvijas Gaze”. This finding was not criticized by the Supreme
Court.

The fact that Latgales Energija had no contract with Latvijas Gaze is also mentioned in the preamble to
the Rézeknes Energija Gas Supply Agreement (C-151).

However, Latgales Energija applied for a revised tariff on 13 October 2005 (see

paragraphs 152 ff. below).

On 25 February 2005 the book value of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s short-time debts to
creditors as of 1 January 2005, stated to be in an amount of LVL 1,448,977 in Clauses
4.4.1 and 4.4.3 of the Long-Term Agreement, was reassessed at LVL 1,220,799.50.°3

(9) REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S SHORT-TERM DEBTS TAKEN OVER BY LATGALES
ENERGIJA (FROM FEBRUARY 2005 ONWARDS)

From February 2005 onwards Latgales Energija entered into a number of contracts to

take over Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s debts in accordance with the Long-Term Agreement

(see paragraph 88 above) and the February 2005 Agreement (see paragraph 101

above). The Amended Long-Term Agreement made on 10 February 2006” increased

the amount of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s indebtedness (see paragraph 167 below).

(A) REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S INDEBTEDNESS TO AVT NAFTA

On 4 February 2005 SIA “AVT Nafta” (“AVT Nafta”) assigned the debt it owned
against Rézeknes Siltumtikli to Latgales Energija in an amount of LVL 240,000; the
assignment agreement mentions that AVT Nafta obtained a loan from Latgales
Energija in an amount of LVL 200,000, an amount which Latgales Energija instructed

its bank to pay on 7 February 2005.°>

On 22 June 2005 a second assignment agreement was executed between the same
parties with respect to a debt owned by AVT Nafta against Rézeknes Siltumtikli in an
amount of LVL 250,000, which amount included the previous amount of
LVL 240,000.°° Under Clause 3 of such second assignment, part of the price would
be paid by Latgales Energija by setting off its claim for payment under the 4 February
2005 loan in an amount of LVL 210,000 (which included LVL 10,000 interest).

Latgales Energija instructed its bank to pay the balance of LVL 40,000 on 19 June
2005.”

On 27 June 2005 Latgales Energija and Rézeknes Siltumtikli then agreed that “the
Company (Latgales Energija) (....) on 22 June 2005 settled liabilities towards SIA
‘AVT NAFTA’ in the total amount of LVL 250,000”.°% Latgales Energija and
Rézeknes Siltumtikli further agreed that Latgales Energija had therefore become a
creditor of Rézeknes Siltumtikli for such amount. The agreement further
contemplated that such amount would be paid by Rézeknes Siltumtikli under a
separate agreement, under which Rézeknes Siltumttkli would set off its debt and
consider that it had received an advance payment of the rent owed by Latgales

Energija under the Long-Term Agreement.

(B)  REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’s INDEBTEDNESS TO DINABURGA ROSME

On 6 April 2005 SIA Dinaburga Rosme (“Dinaburga Rosme”) assigned the debt it
owned against Rézeknes Siltumtikli to Latgales Energija in an amount of
LVL 128,509. Latgales Energija paid the same amount to Dinaburga Rosme in 14
instalments in 2005 and 2006.!°

(C)  REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’s INDEBTEDNESS TO LATVUJAS UNIBANKA

On 27 May 2005 Latgales Energija and Rézeknes Siltumtikli agreed that “the
Company (Latgales Energija) (....) on 3 May 2005 (... and) on 26 May 2005 settled
liabilities towards AS ‘SEB Latvijas Unibanka’ in the total amount of LVL 65,000
and LVL 95,777.92”, that Latgales Energija had made such payment on behalf of
Rézeknes Siltumtikli pursuant to the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and that
Latgales Energija had therefore become a creditor of Rézeknes Siltumtikli for such

101

amount. The agreement further contemplated that such amount would be set off

under a separate agreement against the rent owed by Latgales Energija under the

Long-Term Agreement. !°

On 14 July 2005 Latgales Energija and Rézeknes Siltumttkli made a similar
agreement with respect to an amount of LVL 370,000 paid by Latgales Energija to
Latvijas Unibanka.' Exhibit C-56 shows that Latgales Energija paid Latvijas
Unibanka LVL 95,777.92 and LVL 370,000, but there is no evidence of a payment of
LVL 65,000. However, in the 27 May 2005 agreement Rézeknes Siltumtikli
expressly acknowledged that Latgales Energija on 3 May 2005 paid LVL 65,000 to

Latvijas Banka.!*

By July 2005 Latgales Energija had therefore settled Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s
indebtedness to Latvijas Unibanka in an amount of LVL 530,777.92.

(10) LOCAL ELECTIONS IN LATVIA (MARCH 2005)

In March 2005 local elections were held in Latvia. The election results in Rézekne
were cancelled due to allegations of bribery. Further elections took place in August

2005 (see paragraphs 139 ff. below).

(11) LATGALES ENERGIJA’S LICENCES (30 May 2005)

On 30 May 2005 the Regulator granted Latgales Energija the licence for the
production of thermal energy No. 002-05 for the period from 30 May 2005 to 29 May

2025.! The licence sets out special conditions in Appendix No. 1.

On the same day the Regulator granted Latgales Energija the licence for the

transmission of thermal energy No. 003-05! for the same period of time, as well as

the licence for the sale of thermal energy No. 004-05.!”7

131. Each licence sets out special conditions in its Appendix No. 1. Aside from the fact
that each licence relates to a specific kind of activity, which is reflected in the

Appendix of each licence, the three Appendices contain almost identical language.

132. Clause 1 of the licences sets out Latgales Energija’s duty to provide uninterrupted and
good quality public utility services of production, transfer and distribution and sale,
respectively, of thermal energy in accordance with applicable laws and regulations,

(12) THE FIRST AMENDMENT OF THE GAS SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH LATVIJAS
GAZE (1 JUNE 2005)

On 1 June 2005 the Rézekne City Council, Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Latvijas Gaze

agreed to amend and supplement the Gas Supply Agreement!'? (“Amendment No. |

to the Gas Supply Agreement”).!!!

Under Clause 3 of the amended Gas Supply Agreement the Rézekne City Council
agreed to start the commercial acceptance of natural gas according to Clause 3 of the

Agreement at 9:00 a.m., 15 October 2005 at the latest.

Latgales Energija, which had taken over the heating infrastructure in February 2005
(see paragraphs 112 ff. above), was not consulted.'!? Latgales Energija received a

copy of the agreement on 2 November 2005.!'3

(13) FRESH LOCAL ELECTIONS IN REZEKNE (20 AUGUST 2005)

As the March 2005 election results in Rézekne had been cancelled (see paragraph 128

above), further elections took place on 20 August 2005.

The elected Mayor (i.e. the chairman of the Rézekne City Council) was Mr. Juris

Guntis Vjakse.

 

109 The parties i bly use the terms “ lation”, mss ion” and “1 i
with reference to the revocation of the licences on 3 June 2008 (see paragraphs 337 ff. below). The
Tribunal’s use of the expressions “to revoke the licences” or “the revocation of the licences” is without
prejudice to the Tribunal’s findings in this case.

(14) REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S LONG-TERM DEBTS TAKEN OVER BY LATGALES
ENERGIJA (FROM AUGUST 2005 ONWARDS)

(A) THE INVESTMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT (4 AUGUST 2005)

On 4 August 2005 E energija (as “the Client”) and AS Lohmus, Haavel & Viisemann
(as “LHV”) entered into an “Investment Services Agreement” (the “Investment
Services Agreement”).!'4 The purpose of this agreement was to obtain LHV’s
assistance to refinance Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s loans from Latvijas Unibanka
116

contemplated by Clause 4.4.4''5 of the Long-Term Agreement! and taken over from

Latvijas Unibanka.

LHV would in its own name take over two loans granted by Latvijas Unibanka to
Rézeknes Siltumtikli, on the Claimant’s account, under the terms of an assignment
agreement which it would execute with Latvijas Unibanka, Clause 2.2 of the
Investment Services Agreement.''? E energija undertook to transfer a sum of
LVL 1,113,895 or any other amount to LHV based on the Assignment Agreement
between LHV and Latvijas Unibanka (Clause 2.1 of the Investment Services

Agreement) and to pay the fees set out in Clause 3 of the same agreement.

LVH undertook in turn to transfer any payments received from Rézeknes Siltumtikli

to E energija’s account (Clause 1.3 of the Investment Services Agreement).

Mr. Jautakis explained in his first Witness Statement that the reason for the resort to a
third party such as LHV to take over Rézeknes Siltumttkli’s long-term debts was that

Rézeknes Siltumtikli would be more likely to repay its debts.!!®

M4 C63.

‘5 The reference to Clause 4.4.3 of the Long-Term Agreement in Mr. Jautakis’ first Witness Statement
(CWS-2 4] 46 and 47) is inaccurate, see also Cl. Mem. 60. Clause 4.4.4 of the Long-Term Agreement
entitled Latgales Energija to take over Rézeknes Siltumtitkli’s long-term debts to Latvijas Unibanka in a
total amount of LVL 1,668,526 and Baltic Trust Bank in an amount of LVL 680,817, see paragraph 89

(C) PAYMENT BY EENERGUA (12 AUGUST 2005)

On 12 August 2005 E energija paid Latvijas Unibanka the amount of
LVL 1,125,196.96 on behalf of LHV.!7!

(D) | THE AGREEMENT ON SETTLEMENT OF DEBT (15 NOVEMBER 2005) AND
REIMBURSEMENT BY LATGALES ENERGIA OF REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S
DEBTS UNDER THE LOANS

On 15 November 2005 Latgales Energija executed the Agreement on Settlement of
Debt with Rézeknes Siltumtikli (the “Agreement on the Settlement of Debt”)!?? and
undertook to repay Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s loan debt arising under the two loans
granted by Latvijas Unibanka for October, November and December 2005 as well as
January and February 2006 in an amount of LVL 62,252.85 including interest
(Clause 1). Clause 2 of the same agreement provides that Latgales Energija shall
continue to pay Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s debts arising under those loans in accordance
with the Debt Repayment Schedule attached as Appendix 1 to the Agreement on

Settlement of Debt (which Appendix is not in evidence).

19 C64.

120 Clause 1.1 of the Assignment Agreement states that the claim for payment of Latvijas Unibanka
against Rézeknes Siltumtikli as of the date of the Assignment Agreement is for an amount of
LVL 1,125,196. The reasons for the decrease in amount from LVL 1,668,526 (see footnote 115 above)
and the amount of LVL 1,125,196 (Clause 1.2 of the Assignment Agreement) are not explained, but no
explanation is required in view of the fact that Latvijas Unibanka accepted such amount in the
Assignment Agreement.

21 C65. Mr. Jautakis’ first Witness Statement (CWS-2 { 49) indicates that E energija paid Lohmus the
amount of LVL 1,125,196.96, but Exhibit C-65 indicates that the beneficiary of the payment is Latvijas
Unibanka. It would seem that E energija directly paid Latvijas Unibanka the amount of
LVL 1,125,196.96 which was to have been paid by LHV, thereby settling the debt for the same amount
owed to LHV under the Investment Services Agreement.

The Agreement on Settlement of Debt does not say to which entity Latgales Energija
would make the payments contemplated by the agreement; such payments were to
be made to LHV according to the Claimant,'?* as confirmed in due course by Clause

1.2(d) of the Amended Long-Term Agreement. !*4

Between November 2005 and November 2006 Latgales Energija paid LHV a total
amount of LVL 141,927.!7°

Further arrangements would be made in 2006 (see paragraphs 199 ff. and 205 ff.
below) and 2008 (see paragraphs 377 ff. below).

(15) First REFERENCES TO A HEAT SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT PLAN (OCTOBER
2005)

The first communications mentioning a “heat supply development plan” took place in

late 2005. The discussion relating to this topic continued in the following years (see

paragraphs 164 ff. below for 2006).

On 12 October 2005 the Regulator informed the Rézekne City Council that (i)
municipalities should organise heating supply in their territory, (ii) municipalities
might specify the development of heating supply within the “development plan” for
their territory in coordination with the Regulator and (iii) Section 27 of the
Methodology specified that the investment required was included in the calculation of
the net profit for each heating supply service (production, distribution and sale) “in
accordance with the heat supply system development plan as approved by the
corresponding local government.”!”° The Regulator asked the Rézekne City Council
to advise whether there was “an effective and coordinated development plan of the
city heating supply containing planned and already made investments of ‘Latgales

Energija’ Ltd. in development and improvement of the city heating supply”.!?’

No answer to the Regulator’s enquiry is in evidence on the part of Rézekne City

Council.

On 27 October 2005 Rézeknes Siltumtikli wrote to Latgales Energija referring to the
Regulator’s 12 October 2005 letter to the City Council and asked whether Latgales
Energija had “specified and coordinated with local government the municipal heat
supply development plan including both specified and intended investments in this

field”,!28

Rézeknes Siltumtikli letter further asked when Latgales Energija would start to use

natural gas as a fuel.

There is no answer in evidence on the part of Latgales Energija to the first question;!”°
as to the second question, Latgales Energija answered on 7 November 2005 (see

paragraph 156 below).

(16) | LATGALES ENERGIJA’S APPLICATIONS TO THE REGULATOR FOR A NEW
TARIFF (13 OCTOBER 2005 AND 10 NOVEMBER 2005) — THE REGULATOR’S
DECISIONS

According to a statement issued by Rézeknes Siltumtikli for the attention of the
Regulator on 13 October 2005,'*° the prime cost of 1 MWh was in an amount of

LVL 28.26 in 2004. According to the same statement issued by Latgales Energija on

131

the same day,'”’ the prime cost of 1 MWh was in an amount of LVL 38.24 in the

period from 15 February to 31 August 2005. The tariff then in force (see paragraph

60 above) no longer covered the costs for the production of heat.

8 C74,

129 The Claimant alleges that the Regulator had asked Latgales Energija whether the heat supply
development plan had been approved and “Latgales Energija responded that it had not”, RfA § 63.
However, in his first Witness Statement Mr. Strioga does not confirm that allegation (CWS-1 { 67).

On 8 November 2005 Latgales Energija published a proposed tariff of
LVL 32.96/MWh for residents and LVL 34.25/MWh for other users in the Rézeknes

Véstis newspaper.'*>

On 19 December 2005 the Regulator approved a new tariff of LVL 27.60/MWh for
residents and LVL 29.02/MWh (without VAT) for other users in decision No. 19.!*3

The Regulator’s published decision was stated to be based on Section 2.1 and
Section 26 of the Cabinet of Ministers Regulations No. 281 of 26 June 2001, amended
in 2008 (Methodology for Calculation of Tariffs for Public Utilities in the Fields
Regulated by Local Municipalities, “the Methodology”).'*+

The approval was based in substance on the proposition that “[t]he approved tariff
will cover the most necessary costs”, which addressed Latgales Energija’s argument
reported in the decision that “[t]he grounds for the increase of tariffs are the growing
fuel and electric energy prices” and that “the present tariffs do not cover the

company’s operating costs”.!5

The Regulator’s decision of 19 December 2005 did not refer to a “development plan”.

(17) | REZEKNE HEATING SYSTEM CONVERTED TO USE NATURAL GAS
(NOVEMBER 2005)

By November 2005 Latgales Energija had converted the heating infrastructure so that
it could use natural gas. On 7 November 2005 Latgales Energija sent Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and the Rézekne City Council a notice informing them that, as of that day,

they were ready to supply heating using natural gas as fuel and requesting the delivery

132° 79. The figure of LVL 34.25/MWh is mistakenly indicated as LVL 22.26 in the English
translation of the published decision in C-15 [page 1] (accurate in C-82 [page 1]). It is unclear,
moreover, whether this publication is the actual fresh application for a new tariff made by Latgales
Energija, as contended by the Claimant (Cl. Mem. fj 95; the Regulator’s decision refers to an application
by Latgales Energija of 10 November 2005).

of 5 million cubic metres of natural gas in 2005 and 21 million cubic metres of natural

gas in 2006.!°°

As there was no written agreement to which Latgales Energija was a party with
respect to the supply of natural gas (see paragraph 117 above), Rézeknes Siltumtikli
invoiced Latgales Energija for the gas supplied based on the invoices received from
Latvijas Gaze. Latgales Energija in turn paid such invoices directly to Latvijas Gaze.
In an interview given on 13 September 2007, Mr. Vjakse confirmed that this was the

arrangement under which Latvijas Gaze was paid for the natural gas supplied.'*”

It is in dispute between the Parties whether Latgales Energija owed Latvijas Gaze a

duty to pay for the natural gas supplied (see paragraphs 586 ff. and 726 ff. below).

The Claimant alleges that by December 2005 Latgales Energija had made the
investment required to convert the heating infrastructure to accept natural gas and had

started to use natural gas to produce thermal energy in Rézekne.!**

However, the actual gasification of the system was only partial as of the end of 2005,
in that it related to two out of three heat sources, namely the boiler houses in Rancana

iela 1 (also often referred to as Rigas iela) and AtbrivoSanas aleja 155a.!°°
(18) THE THIRD AMENDMENT OF THE GAS SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH LATVIJAS

nm? in the original Gas Supply Agreement with the figure of 21,157,895 nm’, thereby
increasing the minimum quantity of gas to be taken by the Municipality by 157,895

nm?,!44

The Parties further agreed that Latvijas Gaze would not claim from the Municipality a

penalty of LVL 227,920 with respect to the year 2005.'45

Clause 6 of the Amendement No. 3 reiterated that the Municipality retained “liability
for timely and complete payment of invoices” under Clause 8.3 of the Gas Supply
Agreement,'*° and Rézeknes Siltumtikli was authorised by the Municipality to pay the

invoices for natural gas issued by Latvijas Gaze.

document'*? and did not contact Latgales Energija in this regard until 3 November
2016 after the Regulator had rejected a new tariff proposed by Latgales Energija (see
paragraph 188 below).

Latgales Energija’s “Guidelines” outlined the heating system in the City of Rézekne
in their introductory part. They then identified two major problems, namely
excessively high costs of heat production, broken down in nine distinct aspects,!°° and

environmental pollution,'*! for which they outlined possible solutions.'>>

(2) THE AMENDED LONG-TERM AGREEMENT (10 FEBRUARY 2006)

On 10 February 2006 Latgales Energija and Rézeknes Siltumtikli executed a contract
entitled “Agreement on Amendments to the Agreement for Lease, Renovation and

Operation of the Long-Term Assets of 28 January 2005” (the “Amended Long-Term

losses; 6. excessive diameter of certain pipeline segments and ensuing costs of electricity to operate
pumping devices; 7. poor insulation of the buildings where the heating is used; 8. large amounts of
electricity required to operate pumping devices and 9. increase in the price of fuel oil from January to

Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s long-term debt to LHV.!°*

Clause 1.3(a) and (b) of the Amended Long-Term Agreement fixed the lease
payments to be made by Latgales Energija in the first two years of the lease (as
LVL 185,326.40 and LVL 150,000 respectively, for a total amount of
LVL 335,326.40,!°° which brought to total amount to be paid by Latgales Energija to
LVL 2,812,100 (Clause 1.3(c) of the Amended Long-Term Agreement). The amount
of LVL 2,476,773.60 (erroneously indicated as LVL 2,472,094.80 in Clause 1.3(c) of
the Amended Long-Term Agreement) was to be considered as “the security deposit

for the following payments” and would be set off'®° under a separate agreement.

(3) | THE AGREEMENT ON MUTUAL OPERATIONS WITH THE AIM TO DECREASE
ENERGY RATE IN THE CITY OF REZEKNE (10 FEBRUARY 2006)

On 10 February 2006 Latgales Energija and the Rézekne City Council executed a

contract entitled “Agreement on Mutual Operations with the Aim to Decrease

Thermal Energy Rate in the City of Rézekne” (the “February 2006 Agreement”).!°!

The recitals of the February 2006 Agreement refer to the recent increase in the rates

of thermal energy and the need to minimize social tensions in Rézekne.!©?

The February 2006 Agreement sets out in Clause 1 the duties undertaken by the
Rézekne City Council in its capacity as Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s sole shareholder, in
consideration of which Latgales Energija undertakes in Clauses 2 to 4 to decrease the

thermal energy rates by the agreed amounts.

More specifically, the Rézekne City Council undertook inter alia:

'57 LVL 128,509 owed to Dinaburga Rosme, LVL 250,000 owed to AVT Nafta and LVL 530,777.92
owed to Latvijas Unibanka.
‘58 In an amount of LVL 1,567,486.68.

159 As pointed out by the Claimant (Cl. Mem. 57), the sum of LVL 185,326.40 and LVL 150,000 is
LVL 335,326.40 and the amount of LVL 340,005.20 in Clause 1.3(c) of the Amended Long-Term
Agreement is inaccurate.

160 The Tribunal accepts that the verb “written off” in the English translation of the Amended Long-
Term Agreement from the original Latvian is a translation mistake as contended by the Claimant (Cl.

Clause 3.

Clause 4 provided that in case the Council timely and fully performed the obligations
undertaken under the Agreement, Latgales Energija would apply a further decrease in
thermal energy rates until 1 October 2006 and apply a rate of LVL 25.02/MWh for
residents and LVL 28.59/MWh for other users.

The February 2006 Agreement further contained terms dealing with the event of a
breach of contract by each party. Clause 5 dealt with Latgales Energija’s contractual
rights in case the Rézekne City Council failed to perform any of the obligations
undertaken in Clauses 1.1 to 1.5;'°t Clause 6 dealt with the Rézekne City Council’s
contractual rights in case Latgales Energija failed to perform the obligations

undertaken in Clauses 2 to 4 of the February 2006 Agreement.

The Rézekne City Council was to perform the obligations undertaken under Clauses
1.1 through 1.5 of the February 2006 Agreement by 28 February 2006 (unless

otherwise expressly provided by such clauses).

There is no correspondence between the parties in February 2006, the month in which
the Rézekne City Council was due to perform the obligations contemplated by Clause

1 of the February 2006 Agreement, on the record, either confirming performance of

'64 C-17, Clause 5 reads as follows:
5. In case any of the obligations indicated in Clauses 1.1-1.5 is not

performed by the Council of AS “Rézeknes siltumtikli”, SIA “Latgales

energija” unilaterally decreases the rent paid to AS “Rézeknes

siltumtikli” for the period from 25.02.2006 to 24.02.2007 for the actual

lost income calculated by multiplying the actual amount of sold heating

and the difference between the rate approved by the Multi-industry

Public Utility Regulator of Latgale Municipalities: 27.60 LVL/MWh

for residents and 29.03 LVL/MWh for other u: and the actual

applied rate. Likewise SIA “Latgales energija” is entitled to terminate

this agreement at any time, but not before 01.03.2006, and claim

compensation for the lost income.
The expression “the Council of AS ‘Rézeknes siltumtikli’” in Clause 5 of the English version is
ambiguous; in the Tribunal’s view, it has the same meaning as “the Council” as the sole shareholder of
AS “Rézeknes siltumtikli” in Clause 1 since Rézeknes Siltumtikli is not in terms a party to this
agreement.

the agreement by either side or otherwise. There is no correspondence in evidence for

the period immediately following either.!°

From February 2006 until 1 October 2006, Latgales Energija applied the rates of LVL
25.02/MWh for residents and LVL 28.59/MWh for other users, i.e. the rates

decreased pursuant to Clause 4 of the February 2006 Agreement.'©°

On 19 October 2006, after the Regulator rejected Latgales Energija’s application for a
new tariff,!°’ Latgales Energija wrote to the Rézekne City Council in relation to the
performance of the February 2006 Agreement, and more specifically in relation to the
“guidelines for the city heat supply system”, pointing out that it had carried out all the
activities required on its part to comply with Clause 1.2 of the February 2006
Agreement and that it had received no answer from the Council in spite of its

8

reminders.'® Latgales Energija gave notice to the Council that it would have no

choice but to resort to Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement! unless the Council

adopted the “guidelines” within the following two months.

It is the Claimant’s case that the Rézekne City Council failed in particular to approve
the “guidelines for the development of the heating supply system”, and thereby failed

to live up to its side of the bargain.!”°

‘65 The first communications in which Latgales Energija took the view that the Rézekne City Council
was in breach of its contractual obligation with respect to the heat supply development plan were made
later in 2006 and 2007 (see C-96 [19 October 2006] and paragraph 178 below; C-112 [2 February 2007]
and paragraph 207 below; C-116 [6 March 2007] and paragraph 209 below; C-118 [19 April 2007] and
paragraph 210 below; C-121 [29 May 2007] and paragraph 214 below; C-129 [13 July 2007]). Most of
these communications were addressed to the Rézekne City Council; when Rézeknes Siltumtikli was the
addressee, the Rézekne City Council would be copied in.

(4) LATGALES ENERGIJA’S APPLICATION TO THE REGULATOR FOR A NEW
TARIFF (12 JUNE 2006) — THE REGULATOR’S DECISION (13 OCTOBER 2006)
— THE DECISIONS BY THE LATVIAN ADMINISTRATIVE COURTS (17
NOVEMBER 2007 AND 15 APRIL 2009)

From February to the end of September 2006 Latgales Energija applied a reduced rate

in accordance with Clause 4 of the February 2006 Agreement (see paragraph 177

above).

In the meantime, Latvijas Gaze had been authorised by the Latvian Public Utilities

Commission to raise the price of natural gas.!7!

On 12 June 2006 Latgales Energija applied to the Regulator seeking an increased
tariff in an amount of LVL 33.38/MWh for residents and LVL 33.92/MWh for other
users of thermal energy (from the approved rates of LVL 27.60/MWh and
LVL 29.02/MWh respectively!””). In its calculations attached to its application
Latgales Energija indicated that the new price charged by Latvijas Gaze for the
natural gas had risen from LVL 83.06 to LVL 113.76 (which represented an increase
of 36%), and the new price for electricity from LVL 29 to LVL 34 (which represented

an increase of 17%).!?

On 15 August 2006 Latgales Energija asked the Regulator to cancel its previous
application of 12 June 2006 and submitted fresh calculations for the rate applicable to
residents, seeking a rate of LVL 30.91/MWh for residents, and LVL 33.92/MWh for
other users of thermal energy. Ms. Rogozina explains in her first Witness Statement

that such step was caused by a change in VAT rules.!*

On 13 October 2006 the Regulator denied Latgales Energija’s application by a
unanimous vote.'’> The reasons for this decision are discussed in paragraphs 901 ff.

below.

On 17 November 2006 Latgales Energija challenged the Regulator’s decision before

the Administrative District Court.!”°

Since the challenge of the Regulator’s 13 October 2006 decision had not been heard
yet by the time the Regulator had made decision No. 12 of 11 June 2007, which was
also challenged by Latgales Energija, on 22 June 2007 Latgales Energija amended its
17 November 2006 application to set aside so as to include only the Regulator’s
decision No. 12 dated 11 June 2007.'” There was therefore no decision by the
Administrative District Court in relation to the Regulator’s decision No. 17 dated 13
October 2006. The Administrative District Court eventually made its decision on 15

April 2009.!78

(5) FURTHER STEPS TOWARDS A “HEAT SUPPLY DEVELOPMENT PLAN” (2006)

Having been notified of the Regulator’s decision No. 17 rejecting the proposed tariff,
on 19 October 2006 Latgales Energija complained to the Rézekne City Council of the
losses it was incurring due to the Council’s failure to reply to the “guidelines” that
had been sent (see paragraph 164 above), and threatening to decrease the lease

payment under Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement!”?.!8°

On 3 November 2006 the Rézekne City Council replied asking Latgales Energija to
be provided with the “heat supply development plan” for the period 2006-2007 and

pointing to a number of points that such plan must include.'*!

16 ©-100. The application to have the Regulator’s decision of 13 October 2006 set aside was based first

on the proposition that the three coefficients that were not used in Latgales Energija calculations filed in
support of the proposed new tariff could not be applied because they would be part of the heat supply
development plan which the Municipality had failed to approve (C-100 | 17). Moreover, Latgales
Energija contended that the Regulator’s decision No. 19 dated 19 December 2005 had not applied the
three coefficients relied upon by the Regulator in the decision sought to be set aside, and the Regulator
had thereby departed from its previous practice so as to make it impossible for the applicant to apply for
new tariffs (C-100 {J 18-19).

Secondly, Latgales Energija contended that the Regulator was bound under Sect. 19.5 of the Public
Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49) and Sect. 59 of the Administrative Procedure Act (CLA-47) to request
an applicant to file missing documents to prove the costs on which a proposed tariff was to be based
before a decision on a proposed tariff could be made.

On 15 November 2006 Latgales Energija answered and sent the Rézekne City Council
(i) a one-page “heat supply development plan” for the years 2006-2009'* and (ii) the
“draft heat supply development concept” for the years 2006-2014.'** Latgales
Energija did not in November 2006 refer to the document previously sent to the
Municipality on 20 January 2006.'** The Council received Latgales Energija’s 15

November letter on 17 November 2006.!*5

On 29 December 2006 the Rézekne City Council acknowledged receipt of the “draft
heat supply development concept 2006-2014” submitted by Latgales Energija.'*° The
Council commented that the draft was not in accordance with applicable legislation

and did not correspond to the actual state of heat supply in the city of Rézekne.

One of the reasons given by the Rézekne City Council was the following: “The claim
that the Rézekne City Council has transferred heat supply functions to Latgales

Energija SIA does not correspond to the legal and actual situation”.!8”

This statement relates to the following passage in Latgales Energija’s draft reading as
follows: “(...) the company [Latgales Energija] has taken over from the City Council
the duties specified in Section 15 of the Law on Local Governments, i.e. ensuring
provision of utilities or, more particularly, heat supply. In connection with this LLC
Latgales Energija is performing its activities and thereby also planning and

development [sic] of centralised heat supply in Rézekne City”.'**

The plan was finally approved by the City Council on 21 September 2007 under the

name “Heating Supply Development Strategy” (see paragraph 228 below).!*?

(6) | REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S CLAIMS AGAINST LATGALES ENERGUA
RELATING TO THE DEPRECIATION OF THE LEASED ASSETS

A difference of views developed in 2006 with respect to the lease payments to be

made by Latgales Energija under Clauses 4.4.2 and 7.1.5 of the Long-Term

Agreement.!°

According to Rézeknes Siltumtikli, Latgales Energija had to pay an amount for
depreciation of the assets every month under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement,
whereas Latgales Energija took the view that such payment had to be made upon

returning the assets to the lessor at the end of the term of the lease.!°!

On 7 November 2006 Rézeknes Siltumtikli sent Latgales Energija a “pre-trial
objection” requesting settlement of an alleged debt of LVL 563,098.69 by
20 November 2006, failing which Rézeknes Siltumtikli would bring proceedings to
recover such amount; Rézeknes Siltumtikli further invoked Clause 12.5.2 of the
Long-Term Agreement which entitles the lessor to terminate the agreement

unilaterally in certain cases.!°”

On 5 December 2006 Latgales Energija answered Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s claim of
7 November 2006, taking the view that any amounts to which the lessor might be
entitled under Clause 4.4.2 of the Long-Term Agreement were not yet due and owing.
Nevertheless, Latgales Energija invited Rézeknes Siltumtikli to negotiate a solution

without prejudice which could help solve the lessor’s financial difficulties.!%*

(7) SUPPLEMENTING CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN 2005
A number of arrangements made by the Claimant or Latgales Energija in 2005 were
supplemented in 2006; in some respects further arrangements were made.

(A) FURTHER LOANS BY E ENERGIA TO LATGALES ENERGUA.

E energija granted three further loans to Latgales Energija in 2006 in connection with
the Rézekne Project for a total amount of EUR 1,150,000. This amount was not all

paid in cash; the Claimant also paid sums directly to Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s creditor
Dinaburga Rosma and to its parent company Energijos Taupymo Centras, and took

over debts owed to Energijos Taupymo Centras.!*4

(B) FURTHER INVESTMENT BY E ENERGIA IN LATGALES ENERGIA (8 JUNE
2006)

On 8 June 2006 E energija purchased 364 shares in Latgales Energija from Energo
Sistémas for an amount of EUR 70,000 under the terms of a Share Purchase
Agreement.!%>

(C) LOAN FROM JSC SAMPO BANKA TO LATGALES ENERGIA — E ENERGIA’S

GUARANTEE AND PLEDGE (30 NOVEMBER 2006)

On 30 November 2006 JCS Sampo Banka (“Sampo Banka”) granted Latgales
Energija a loan amounting to LVL 2 million (the “Sampo Banka Loan
Agreement”).!°° According to Clause 2.1 of such agreement the purpose of the loan
was to enable Latgales Energija to purchase LHV’s claims against Rézeknes
Siltumtikli (referred to in Clause 1.2(d) of the Amended Long-Term Agreement!*’),
and to make further investments into the modernization of the heating infrastructure

of the city of Rézekne.

The disbursement of the loan was subject to a number of conditions set out in
Clause 5.2, including the condition that parent company guarantee be issued under
which E energija would guarantee performance of Latgales Energija’s duties to

Sampo Banka under the Sampo Banka Loan Agreement.
The Sampo Banka Loan Agreement was subsequently amended on 26 April 2007.!°8

E energija signed the Guarantee provided to Sampo Banka on 30 November 2006 (the
“Sampo Banka Guarantee”) and undertook to pay any amounts as may be due and
payable under the Sampo Banka Loan Agreement, as a principal debtor and

irrespective of the validity and legal effect of said Loan Agreement, having waived

“all rights of objection and defence” under the same Loan Agreement, and any right
to set off, counterclaim or deduce any amounts (first and third paragraphs of the

Sampo Banka Guarantee).'”

On 30 November 2006 E energija also executed a Commercial Pledge Agreement
with Sampo Banka to secure any claims the bank might have under the Sampo Banka
Loan Agreement, pledging all the shares owned in Latgales Energija up to an amount

of LVL 2.6 million.”

Latgales Energija was eventually unable to repay the loan to Danske Bank which
succeeded to Sampo Bank, and which in turn claimed payment under the Guarantee

Agreement against the Claimant.?"!

(D) — REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S LONG-TERM DEBTS TAKEN OVER BY
LATGALES ENERGUA
On 13 December 2006 Latgales Energija took over the debt owned by LHV against
Rézeknes Siltumtikli under the terms of an Assignment Agreement.?°? LHV’s claim
for payment against Rézeknes Siltumtikli arose under the two loan agreements
referred to in Clause 4.4.4 of the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraph 89 above) and
was then in an amount of LVL 1,103,097.82, including cumulated interest and a

premium (Clause 1.2 of the 2006 Assignment Agreement).

Latgales Energija paid that amount in two instalments in December 2006 and 2007.2

Council in relation to the “draft heat supply development concept” that Latgales
Energija had sent to the Council on 15 November 2006 (see paragraph 189 above).2°

On 19 February 2007 the Rézekne City Council indicated that it was creating a
working group to resolve the matter and asked Latgales Energija to delegate two
representatives to the meetings of the working group,”°° which Latgales Energija did
on 28 February 2007.7’ The working group was not established until 11 May 2007

(see paragraph 213 below).

On 6 March 2007 Latgales Energija gave notice to the Rézekne City Council that it
would not be able to perform its obligation to invest not less than EUR 1.5 million in
accordance with the Long-Term Agreement””® due to the Council’s failure to comply
with its duty to develop a “heat supply development concept” in accordance with the
February 2006 Agreement” and to the absence of any reply by Rézeknes Siltumtikli,

which was copied in, as to Latgales Energija’s repair and investment proposals.”!°

The Arbitral Tribunal notes that the investment proposals relied upon by Latgales

Energija are not in evidence.

On 18 April 2007 Latgales Energija gave substantially the same notice to Rézeknes

Siltumtikli and copied in the Rézekne City Council.?!!

On 13 July 2007 Latgales Energija sent Rézeknes Siltumtikli a further reminder that
Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s failure to answer affected in particular (i) the installation of
two heating boilers with a total capacity of 30 MW and (ii) the installation of
cogeneration facilities at Rigas iela/Rancana iela 1 (4-5 MW) and AtbrivoSanas aleja

There is no answer to either letter in evidence by the Rézekne City Council or
Rézeknes Siltumtikli; Latgales Energija sent further reminders in 2008 (see

paragraphs 329 ff. below).

On 11 May 2007 the Rézekne City Council established a working group (the

“Working Group”)?" to draft the strategic plan for the development of the heat supply

system and present an interim report by 1 July 2007.7!

On 29 May 2007 Latgales Energija again reminded?'> the Rézekne City Council that
it was in breach of its contractual obligation to agree and approve “guidelines for the

development plan of the heating supply system” in accordance with the February

216

2006 Agreement pointing out that it was entitled under Clause 5 of that agreement

to decrease the lease payments to be made to Rézeknes Siltumtikli.?!”

On the same day Latgales Energija applied for a new tariff to the Regulator (these
developments will be dealt with separately in paragraphs 230 ff. below, save insofar
as they are relevant to the “heat supply development plan”). On the following day the
Regulator asked Latgales Energija to provide “information regarding the approved
Rézekne City heat supply development plan, which must be in place” in accordance
with the Methodology.?'® On 6 June 2006 Latgales Energija answered that the
approval of such plan was exclusively a matter for the Rézekne City Council, to

which the Regulator should therefore turn, adding that to the best of its knowledge the

213 The Working Group consisted of the following persons (Council decision No. 188, R-30 [page 1]):

three employees of the Council (Mr. I. Locis, Ms. Groce and Mr. Patmalnieks); four invited specialists,
of whom two members of the Council (Mr. G. Spradzenko, Deputy of RCC and Member of the Board of
SIA Rezekne Udens [water sewerage company]; Mr. E. Skinés, Member of the Boad of SIA Rézekne
Namsaimnieks [estate agent]; Mr. O. Skurjats, member of the Board of SIA Siltumserviss [company
active in heat supply and heat supply network] and Ms. D. Abramova, Deputy of RCC); and Ms.
Vilumovska.

Further persons took part in the meetings of the Working Group. At least one representative of Latgales
Energija (R-30 [pages 2-46]) attended the meetings of the Working Group save for the meetings of
19 July, 31 July and 11 September 2007.

According to the minutes produced by the Respondent, the Working Group had sixteen meetings from
14 May to 19 September 2007 (R-30 [pages 2-46]).

plan had not been adopted.?!? On 11 June 2007 the Regulator denied Latgales
220

Energija’s application for a new tariff.
On 12 June 2007 the Rézekne City Council answered Latgales Energija’s 29 May
2007 letter, pointing out that the Working Group in charge of developing the
“strategic plan for the development of the Rézekne city heat supply system” had
repeatedly”?! requested Latgales Energija to provide information on whether the
introduction of new facilities and technologies would affect the thermal energy tariff,
but had not received any answers.” The delay had therefore been caused by Latgales
Energija, and Latgales Energija’s allegation that the Council was responsible for such
delay was unjustified. The Council further denied that Latgales Energija was entitled
to reduce the amount of the lease payments owed under the Long-Term Agreement

without an amendment of the same, which had to be made in writing.

On 4 July 2007 Latgales Energija claimed in a letter sent both to Rézeknes Siltumtikli
and the Rézekne City Council that the Regulator’s refusal to approve a new tariff?”
had been ultimately caused by the Rézekne City Council’s failure to approve a “heat
supply system development plan”.?*+ Relying on the Rézekne City Council’s
obligations under Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement with particular respect
to the approval of the “heat supply system development plan”,?> Latgales Energija
reiterated that it was under no obligation to decrease the heat energy tariff under the
terms of the February 2006 Agreement and presented a calculation of the amount of
LVL 138,069.24 which it was entitled to deduct from the lease payments owed to
Rézeknes Siltumtikli under Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement.?”°

On 9 July 2007 Rézekne City Council rejected Latgales Energija’s complaints and
claim for compensation, stating it had performed all its obligations and met all the

requirements in order for the thermal energy tariff to be reduced by Latgales Energija,

having recalled its criticism of the “guidelines” received from Latgales Energija on 17
November 2006.7? The letter addressed the tasks to be undertaken by the Council
and Latgales Energija within the Working Group and criticised Latgales Energija for
failing to provide sufficiently clear and detailed information, without which it was
impossible to evaluate the situation and forecast the necessity and scope of the
investments required for the period 2007-2013.7?* A 19-page document was attached

to that letter which is not in evidence.

On 18 July 2007 Latgales Energija replied that the development of the “heat supply
development plan” was an obligation on the Municipality under the Energy Act
(Section 51, Part 1) and the Municipality’s rejection of Latgales Energija’s claim for
compensation was contrary to the provisions of the February 2006 Agreement.”
Latgales Energija did not, however, answer the Council’s criticism in relation to the
alleged failures of its representatives to provide information required by the working

group in charge of the “heat supply development plan”.

On 19 July 2007 the Rézekne City Council reiterated that the Working Group had
received only partial information from Latgales Energija, which was requested to
provide the following by 24 July 2007 on five key items set out in the letter.7*° The
draft “strategic plan” would be submitted for approval by 14 September 2007, the

letter indicated.

On 19 July 2007 Latgales Energija complained to the Council that it had been notified
of a Working Group meeting on that very day at 10:20 a.m. after the meeting had

started at 10:00 a.m.; adequate notice was requested for future meetings.?*!

as at July 2007 there was no updated information regarding the investments
planned; a survey of the prices of potential suppliers would be required which
would take between five to seven weeks, to update the information in relation
to the heat supply main network, the scope of boiler reconstruction, the
measures to improve energy efficiency etc.; expected prices had increased, but

the volume of investment had not changed;

there had been no changes in the schedule of the planned investments;
however, the timing of the schedules depended on the timing of their approval

so that if approval was delayed, completion of the works would be delayed;

the sources of the planned investments would be as follows: up to 90% bank

resources, and 10% equity capital; and

as to the question how the planned investments would affect the energy
efficiency measures, the answer was provided to Mr. Vjakse on | July 2007
and during the meetings of the Working Group. Within two years of obtaining

the investments:

— self-consumption in the boilers would decline to 8.1% (in 2006 it was

11.3%);

— losses in the heat transmission network would decline to 17.2 (currently

18.1%);

— the amount of fuel consumed for the production of 1 MWh heat would

decline to 136 kg of the assumed fuel (currently 151.2 kg); and

— the energy consumption would fall to 22.9 kWh (currently 24 kWh); the
number of employees at the boiler houses would fall by 15% while the
salaries will increase by 20% as employees would have to have higher
qualifications; the heat energy tariff was expected to grow by 7% (at the

inflation of 0 from July 2007).

On 30 July 2007 Latgales Energija sent a two-page “investment plan” covering a
seven-year period starting from the date of the approval of the “Rézekne city heat

supply system development strategic plan”.?*

On the following day the Council replied that the information provided by Latgales
Energija on 23 July 2007 was insufficient as it failed to reflect essential cost items.
The letter stated that an expert had been involved to develop the “Rézekne city heat

supply strategic plan” and additional information was requested.?*+

On 11 September 2007 a meeting of the Working Group took place. Latgales Energija
had announced that it would be unable to attend.”** As indicated in the minutes of the

meeting, a draft Development Plan was available by then.?*°

During that meeting Ms. Abramova, sitting on the Working Group as an invited
specialist and a member of the City Council, suggested to make “editorial comments”
to the draft Development Plan: “when talking about future development, to use the
word ‘operator’, without mentioning SIA Latgales energija as the only possible
operator of thermal energy”.” The minutes indicate that Mr. I. Locis, head of the
Working Group and Vice-Executive Director of the City Council, would make the
editorial changes by 13 September 2007 and prepare the document for review.”**> The
record does not show whether the minutes of this particular meeting were provided to

Latgales Energija.

On 13 September 2007 the Rézekne City Council sent Latgales Energija a 54-page
document setting out the “strategy for the development of the Rézekne city heat
supply” further to Latgales Energija’s request.?? Latgales Energija was invited to
participate in an unscheduled session of the City Development, Infrastructure and

Public Order Committee in the morning of the following day, and the meeting of the

meeting took place on 14 September 2007 as there are no minutes of such a meeting
on the record and it is recalled that no witnesses have been put forward by the

Respondent.

On 17 September 2007 the Rézekne City Council invited Latgales Energija to
participate in the meeting of its deputies that would take place on 19 September 2007

on the “development strategy [for the] heat supply” in Rézekne for 2007-2013.7

Latgales Energija indicated on the very same day that it would attend.?4*

On 19 September 2007 the Working Group met.?** No representative from Latgales
Energija attended. One of the items discussed was the manner in which the
Development Plan in the making should refer to Latgales Energija. Ms. Abramova

reiterated her suggestion that Latgales Energija should not be mentioned “as the only

9,245

possible operator’ another member of the City Council, Mr. Petkeviés, concurred

and suggested that Latgales Energija should be mentioned “only in the descriptive
part, when characterising the current situation”.’4° The record does not show whether

the minutes of this particular meeting were provided to Latgales Energija.

On 21 September 2007 the Rézekne City Council approved the heat supply

As the next sub-sections will recall, the finalization of the Rézekne Heating Supply
Development Strategy for 2007-2013 was not, by far, the sole event worth recalling in
the second part of 2007. By 21 September 2007 a number of equally significant

events had taken place:
@ the Regulator had denied Latgales Energija’s application for a new tariff;
(ii) Latvijas Gaze had stopped deliveries of natural gas;

(iii) | Rézekne’s Mayor had given an interview indicating that Latgales Energija
might no longer be the exclusive supplier of thermal energy in spite of the
express terms contained in the Long-Term Agreement and the February 2006

Agreement; and

(iv) Rézeknes Siltumtikli had sued Latgales Energija in the Latgale Regional Court

and had obtained an injunction freezing Latgales Energija’s bank account.

The following sub-sections will deal with those developments.

(2)  LATGALES ENERGIJA’S APPLICATION TO THE REGULATOR FOR A NEW
TARIFF (29 MAY 2007) AND THE REGULATOR’S DECISION (11 JUNE 2007) —
LATGALES ENERGIJA’S APPLICATION TO THE REGULATOR FOR A NEW
TARIFF (5 NOVEMBER 2007) AND THE REGULATOR’S DECISIONS (9
NOVEMBER 2007 AND 7 DECEMBER 2007)

The tariff in force in 2007 (LVL 27.6/MWh for residents and LVL 29.02/MWh for
other users) had been approved by the Regulator on 19 December 2005.74*

From February to October 2006 Latgales Energija had applied a reduced tariff of LVL
25.02/MWh for residents and 28.59/MWh for other users (see paragraph 177 above)
in accordance with Clause 4 of the February 2006 Agreement.?*?

On 19 October 2006 the Regulator had denied Latgales Energija’s application for a

new tariff.’ In 2006 the price charged by Latvijas Gaze in accordance with the

decision by the Public Utilities Commission had risen by some 36%.”>!

On 28 March 2007 the Public Utilities Commission authorised Latvijas Gaze to

increase the price of natural gas.
on 19 December 2005, the increase in the price of natural gas was of the order of 55%

up to 129%,?3

On 29 May 2007 Latgales Energija applied to the Regulator seeking a tariff ranging
from LVL 32.67/MWh to LVL 41.62/MWh from 1 September 2007 onwards.?™*

On 11 June 2007 the Regulator denied Latgales Energija application by a unanimous

vote.”°> The reasons for the decision are discussed in paragraphs 904 ff. below.

On 22 June 2007 Latgales Energija challenged the Regulator’s decision before the
Administrative District Court in the same proceedings which it had brought against

the Regulator’s prior decision of 13 October 2006.7°

255 Decision No. 12, C
256 C-125; see also paragraphs 185-186 above.
The application to set aside rests on a breach by the Regulator of Sect. 5 of the Administrative Procedure
Act and Sect. 15(12) of the same Act. The first provision is to the effect that in administrative
proceedings institutions and courts shall, within the scope of applicable provisions of law, protect the
rights and legal interests of private persons (CL. The second provision is said to embody the
principle of prohibition against legal obstruction by institution and courts.
Sect. 5 of the Administrative Procedure Act (CLA-47) reads as follows:
Principle of Observance of the Rights of Persons
In administrative proceedings, especially in adopting decisions on the merits,
institutions and courts shall, within the scope of the applicable norms of law,
facilitate the protection of the rights and legal interests of private persons.
Sect. 15(12) of the Administrative Procedure Act (CLA-47) reads as follows:

 

 

 

 

  

 

 

 

Institutions and courts may not refuse to decide an ie on the grounds that
such issue is not regulated by law or other external regulatory enactment
(prohibition of legal obstruction by institutions and courts). They may not refuse
to apply a norm of law on the grounds that such norm does not provide for the
mechanism of application, it is not exhaustive or no other regulatory enactments
have been issued which would more closely regulate the application of the
relevant norm. This shall not apply only in c: where an institution, which is
required to apply this norm or participate in its application in another way, has
not been established or is not operating.

The Administrative District Court eventually made its decision on 15 April 2009 and

dismissed Latgales Energija’s application.?°’

On 28 September 2007 Latgales Energija applied again to the Regulator seeking a

35.95 LVL/MWh to 44.16 LVL/MWh depending on the natural gas rate. Reliance
was placed on changes in the natural gas rates and in the minimum salary as well as

other factors.

In the autumn of 2007 a number of significant events took place which the Tribunal

will discuss in the following sub-sections of this Award:

@ on 11 September 2007 Latvijas Gaze stopped the supply of natural gas (see
paragraph 248 below); as a consequence, Latgales Energija experienced

difficulties in providing heating to certain areas of the city of Rézekne;

(ii) on 4 October 2007 the Regulator warned Latgales Energija that it might
revoke the three licences issued to Latgales Energija (see paragraph 262

below);

(iii) the Municipality declared an energy crisis in the city of Rézekne on 9 October

2007 (see paragraph 264 below);

(iv) the heat supply development strategy for the city of Rézekne for 2007-2013
had just been approved by the Municipality on 21 September 20077 (see
paragraph 228 above); and

(v) on 11 October 2007 the Regulator decided to take over Latgales Energija’s
zone (see paragraph 274 below).

On 5 November 2007 Latgales Energija wrote to the Municipality announcing that if
the Regulator approved the new tariff proposed by Latgales Energija, Latgales

Energija would apply reduced rates as set out in that letter.?©°

On 9 November 2007 the Regulator unanimously approved new tariffs.°! Latgales
Energija submits that the approved tariffs would have enabled it to pay the increased

prices for natural gas.?6>

However, on 7 December 2007 the Regulator revoked its previous decision No. 28
dated 9 November 2007 and dismissed Latgales Energija’s application for a new tariff
dated 18 September 2007.7? The decision does not state whether it is a majority

decision or a unanimous decision.

The decision states that on 29 November 2007 Rézeknes Energija had written a letter
to the Regulator (not in evidence) stating that the amount of natural gas which
Latvijas Gaze was to supply was 21,000 nm? whereas Latgales Energija’s application
contained a smaller amount, which proved in the Regulator’s opinion that the
calculations on which Latgales Energija’s application was based were not in
accordance with “the actual situation” and that the rates submitted were therefore to
the detriment of the public interest. Such information had been knowingly supplied
by Latgales Energija and the Regulator’s decision was therefore to be reviewed. The
Regulator found that Latgales Energija had obtained a new tariff “by illegal means”

and that the approved tariff was “unreasonably high”.?

The decision does not state that Latgales Energija’s comments were sought on
Rézeknes Energija’s 29 November 2007 letter before reviewing the Regulator’s

decision dated 9 November 2007.

On 12 December 2007 Latgales Energija challenged the Regulator’s decision before

the Administrative District Court. The court dismissed Latgales Energija’s

application on 30 October 2009.2 Latgales Energija appealed against that judgment

and the Administrative Regional Court dismissed the appeal on 23 September 2010.7”

Latgales Energija had started to charge users according to the revised tariffs approved
by the Regulator on 9 November 2007 as it took the view that the effects of the
Regulator’s decision of 7 December 2007 were stayed pending the resolution of
Latgales Energija’s challenge.*** However, the Rézekne City Council did not accept

Latgales Energija’s position (see paragraphs 324 ff. below).

(3) | TOWARDS THE DECLARATION OF AN ENERGY CRISIS BY THE REZEKNE CITY
COUNCIL (9 OCTOBER 2007)
Owing to the Regulator’s refusal to approve a new tariff in 2006 (see paragraph 184
above) and in 2007 (see paragraphs 233 and 240 above) and to the increase in the gas
prices charged by Latvijas Gaze allowed by the competent authority in 2006 and 2007
(see paragraphs 181 and 231 above) Latgales Energija felt that it would no longer be
in a position to pay the amounts which Latvijas Gaze was invoicing Rézeknes
Siltumtikli. On 2 July 2007 it informed Rézeknes Siltumtikli that, as of 11 June 2007,
it would pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas Gaze in accordance with the
tariff applied by the Regulator when the heating tariff was approved, namely

“LVL 83.60/1000 m>”.2

On 25 July 2007 Latgales Energija informed Rézeknes Siltumtikli that it paid less
than Latvijas Gaze had invoiced Rézeknes Siltumttkli for June 2007, by some
LVL 10,000.7”

Latgales Energija did not pay the outstanding balance to Latvijas Gaze. Neither did
Rézeknes Siltumtikli and the Rézekne City Council which were the contracting

parties to the Gas Supply Agreement with Latvijas Gaze.?”!

On 29 August 2007 Latvijas Gaze warned the Rézekne City Council and Rézeknes
Siltumtikli that it would suspend supplies of natural gas unless the Rézekne City
Council paid in full for the natural gas supplied to Rézeknes Siltumtikli until the end
of July 2007.7”? On 10 September 2007 Latvijas Gaze sent the Rézekne City Council
and Rézeknes Siltumtikli a second warning.?”>_ On 11 September 2007 the Rézekne
City Council asked Latvijas Gaze not to interrupt supplies of natural gas.?”

On 11 September 2007 Latvijas Gaze stopped its natural gas supply just before the

beginning of the heating season.

In its letter to the Rézekne City Council and Rézeknes Siltumtikli dated 14 September
2007 Latvijas Gaze stated that the City Council had not paid for the natural gas
received in July 2007 in full and the City Council’s request to maintain supplies had
been rejected by its Board; the amount claimed by Latvijas Gaze was of approx. LVL

148,000 plus an advance payment of LVL 400,000 for October 2007 and interest on

delayed payment, to be calculated.?”°

As a consequence of the interruption in the supply of natural gas, Latgales Energija
had to switch back to its reserves of heavy fuel oil, which it did, in order to provide

heating and hot water.?”°

On 13 September 2007 the Mayor of Rézekne gave an interview that was published

on 15 September 2007 in the local paper Rézeknes Véstis.2”’ In his answer to the

question put to him?’* the Mayor reportedly answered as follows:

First of all I want to reassure residents and to confirm that supply of hot water
and heating would be provided.

And now I will explain how this difficult situation occurred. Everybody knows
that the lease agreement with company Latgales energija is disadvantageous for

278 The question put to the Mayor was: “Gas supply stopped in Rézekne. The problem with the heat
supply has again run into a dead end... What should Rézekne residents expect, how does the council
intends [sic] to solve the problem?”

the city. The same can be said about the agreement with Latvijas Gaze. The
agreement on gas supply has been concluded among AS Latvijas Gaze, AS
Rézeknes siltumtikli and Rézekne Council, instead of concluding directly with
the producer of thermal energy. Latvijas Gaze issues an invoice for gas
consumption to Rézeknes siltumtikli, and the latter, in its turn, issues an
analogous invoice to Latgales energija that serves as the final link in the chain of
payments for gas. After all, this company uses gas and receives payment from
the heat consumers. However, if a single santims remains unpaid for the
consumed gas, the council bears the liability, as the municipality is the guarantor
for payments under the agreement with Latvijas Gaze. So far, Rézeknes
siltumtikli prevented occurrence of debts. However, two months ago, when the
Regulator rejected a project to increase the thermal energy tariffs (considering
them to be unreasonably high), Latgales energija begun to pay only a part of the
accrued amount, that is, failed to pay the difference between the current rate and
the increased rate they desired, which was rejected by the Regulator. Thus, a
debt of LVL 29,164 occurred.

 

Latgales energija took the following position: you, the council, hinder and cause
obstacles for the Regulator to increase the tariffs.

We would like to note that the council does not determine and does not
influence the tariffs, this is in the power of the Regulator, not the council.
Apparently, Latgales energija is thus trying to impose a pressure on the
Regulator...

 

The City Council can easily pay the debt to Latvijas Gaze. The debt amount is
small. The best variant how to do it is by amending the budget in the end of the
year to transfer this money to Rézeknes siltumtikli increasing its share capital,
thereafter these funds would cover the debt. Therefore we addressed the
management of Latvijas Gaze with a request to extend the payment term of the
invoice for the gas until 1 January 2008. This issue will be discussed at a board
meeting of AS Latvijas Gaze on Friday (14 September).

Of course, we are interested in a direct agreement between Latvijas Gaze and the
operator, heating company. However, with regard to Latgales energija, Latvijas
Gaze has a categorical position: there will be no direct agreement with this
company...

The situation reached a critical point. This cannot go any further. Therefore, last
week the board of AS Rézeknes siltumtikli made a decision to instruct board
member Aldis MezZals to hire a law office from Riga to draft documents that are
required to bring a claim to court against SIA Latgales energ

 

On 14 September, a claim will be brought to the administrative court to collect
the debt from Latgales energija at three positions: for the continued delay in
payment of depreciation to akciju sabedriba Rézeknes siltumtikli (in the amount
of 75 thousand lats); for the failure under the agreement to take over the debt of
Rézeknes siltumtikli, in the amount of one million lats; for failure to pay the
invoices of Latvijas Gaze for the consumed gas.

I will explain that as of the beginning of operations Latgales energija did not pay
a santims for depreciation (however, according to law, deductions should be
done annually). In relation to taking over the debt of Rézeknes Siltumtikli,
Latgales energija did not take it over, it assigned the debt (that is, did not take
over the debt itself, but the right of claim, to collect the debt); as a result, this
million lats was distributed across the entire remaining lease term and counted in
the rent payment.

Therefore, company Rézeknes siltumtikli faced limited cash income that would
allow the payment.

63

252.

253.

254.

What will be our further steps? Tomorrow (14 September), six companies that
provide heating in Latvia will receive letters with a description and analysis of
the situation with the heating supply in Rézekne and an offer to take up
provision of heating in our city. I am sure, there will be persons who would
want to take this up. Then we will announce a tender and choose a company
that would meet our requirements. The main and mandatory condition would
be: conclusion of a direct agreement between Latvijas Gaze and the operator;
also requirements that the tariff of the heating in Rézekne would not exceed 30
lats for five years.

I can tell that the future of Latgales energija in our city will be decided on 25
September. By this date, the regular payment for the gas should be paid, and in
case Latgales energija fails to pay it, then I would bring a question to deputies
regarding termination of the agreement with this company. In case the payment
is made, then the question of gas payment is removed, and we sit down at the
table of negotiations to discuss issues of heating supply in the city.

 

In conclusion I would like to address the residents of our city: don’t panic. There
will be no interruption in supply of hot water and heating. I can ensure that
much has been done to solve the problem, but it has not been publicly
advertised. For three months, I have been negotiating with several companies
persuading them that Rézekne has a future. And I can guarantee that in case of
necessity a new company, large, serious and reliable, would appear here.
Previously we did not have alternatives. Now we have them.

  

On 19 September 2007 Latgales Energija wrote to the Mayor with reference to the
interview published in Rézeknes Véstis, asking whether it was accurate that a letter
had been, or would be, sent to six Latvian heat supply companies with a proposal to
supply thermal energy in Rézekne, and whether in such case Latgales Energija would

be able to take part in the competition.2”” No answer to that letter is in evidence.

On 20 September 2007 the differences of opinion between Rézeknes Siltumtikli and
Latgales Energija regarding the time when payment of depreciation was owed by
Latgales Energija (see paragraphs 193 ff. above) suddenly came to a head. Rézeknes
Siltumtikli sued Latgales Energija in the Latgale Regional Court seeking inter alia
payment of certain amounts (see paragraph 302 below). Rézeknes Siltumtikli finally
sought, and obtained, the attachment of Latgales Energija’s funds held by banks and

payments owed by any third parties.

The Claimant takes the view that the claims were spurious”*°

and the application for
an attachment was calculated to prevent Latgales Energija’s from using its bank

account to make and receive payments and to disrupt Latgales Energija’s business

to be provided just before the heating season began.”*!

On 21 September 2007 the Latgale Regional Court granted the attachment sought to
secure the claimant’s claims for an amount up to LVL 880,354.02 with immediate

effect.?°?
Latgales Energija’s operations were almost completely halted by the attachment.”**

In the week of 24 September 20077** the Board of Education of the Rézekne City
Council made a request in writing to Latgales Energija in order that the schools and
nursery schools in the city should be heated. The Social Care Directorate made a

similar request in relation to the Social Care Centre for the Retired.?*°

On 28 September 2007 the Rézekne City Council decided to establish SIA Rézeknes
Energija (“Rézeknes Energija”) as a Municipality-owned company according to
www.rezekne.lv.*° The Respondent has neither denied this piece of information nor

disproved it by documentary evidence filed in rebuttal.

On 1 October 2007 www.rezekne.lv reported that there was no heating in two
secondary schools and three nursery schools of the Rézekne Northern District.?8’ On

The Claimant alleges that the request in order for heating to be started was made on | October 2007
and the Municipality Educational Department complained to the Regulator on the same day (Cl. Mem.
9 150-151). However, the exhibit relied upon by the Claimant (C-142) indicates that the request in
order for heating to be started was made in the preceding week which started on Monday 24 September
2007.

admitted that the supply of heating services was interrupted in the city of Rézekne,

especially in the northern district.?°°

On 2 October 2007 Rézeknes Energija was incorporated by the Rézekne City Council
with a paid-in capital of LVL 2,000, subsequently increased to LVL 4,002,000 on 30
October 2007 relying on a loan from the Treasury (see paragraphs 261 and 271

below).

On 3 October 2007 the Local Government Loan and Guarantee Control and
Monitoring Council approved the decision by the Rézekne City Council to apply for a
loan from the Treasury for an amount of LVL 4 million to invest in the share capital
of Rézeknes Energija.”?' On 4 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council applied to the
Treasury for such loan.??? On 9 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council decided to

pay an amount of LVL 4 million for Rézeknes Energija’s capital increase.?°°

On 4 October 2007 the Regulator sent Latgales Energija a warning”™ stating that the
licences were at risk of being revoked, but not before 4 January 2008.7 Latgales
Energija was requested to submit explanations to the Regulator by 7 November 2007

On 8 October 2007 the Board of Directors of the Latvian Public Utilities Commission
met. According to the account made by the Mayor of Rézekne the Commission

determined that an emergency situation was to be announced.?**

On 9 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council made a unanimous decision declaring
that there was an energy crisis in the city of Rézekne and to establish an “energy crisis
centre” (the “Energy Crisis Committee”).?”

Latgales Energija was not heard or consulted before that decision was made.*°°

On the same day the Rézekne City Council notified Latgales Energija of its decision
and informed Latgales Energija that a meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee would
take place at 5:00 p.m. that day, asking that a Latgales Energija representative
attend.*°!_ Latgales Energija acknowledged receipt of that decision on 9 October

2007.3

In the same letter the Rézekne City Council asked Latgales Energija to supply heating
and hot water in the city within 24 hours, schools and nursery schools to be given

priority.

(4) THE ENERGY CRISIS IN REZEKNE (FROM 9 OCTOBER 2007 ONWARDS)

Department of RCC).

302 C144,

The Claimant’s allegation that Latgales Energija read the announcement of the energy crisis in the press
because it was not notified the decision (Cl.Mem. § 189; see also Mr. Voronovs’ first Witness Statement,
CWS-5 { 11) is therefore inaccurate.

These events will be recalled in some detail in the following sub-sections.

(A) | TOWARDS THE REGULATOR’S DECISION TAKING OVER LATGALES
ENERGIJA’S ZONE (11 OCTOBER 2007)
The first meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 9 October 2007.5
The meeting ended with the Mayor proposing to send Latgales Energija a request in
writing to supply heating to the six schools and nursery schools within 24 hours as of
receipt of the letter and to inform the Regulator and a number of Ministries of the

decision made.

The request that heating be provided within 24 hours was confirmed by the Mayor in

a letter dated 10 October 2007.54

On 10 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council submitted an application to the
Regulator; that application is not in evidence, but it is mentioned in the Regulator’s

decision No. 26 dated 11 October 2007.3

In the meantime, on 10 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council had signed the Loan
Agreement with the Treasury of the Republic of Latvia (the “Latvian Treasury Loan
Agreement”) which it had entered into in order to fund the increase in the share

capital of Rézeknes Energija (see paragraph 261 above).°”°

The next meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 11 October 2007.7°7

The meeting ended with a decision to apply to the Latvian Public Utilities
Commission. Asked by the Mayor to comment on the situation, Mr. Melnikovs stated
that the northern boiler was not running at all, Latgales Energija was seeking to buy

fuel without using funds and to have its bank account unblocked.

No. 26 dated 11 October 2007.5

On 11 October 2007 the Regulator decided to take over Latgales Energija’s zone
forthwith.*”” On 31 March 2010 Latgales Energija’s application to have that decision
set aside was dismissed by the Administrative Regional Court, then it was dismissed

anew on 24 November 2011.31?

(B) THE APPOINTMENT OF REZEKNES ENERGIA AS THE PERSON
RESPONSIBLE TO PROVIDE HEATING SERVICES IN REZEKNE (12
OCTOBER 2007)
On 12 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council appointed Rézeknes Energija “as the
person in charge of provision of thermal energy in in the administrative territory of
Rézekne”2!!

The third meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 13 October 2007 and

lasted five hours and fifteen minutes.>!”

The meeting ended with the decision to
execute the Council’s decision of the previous day to delegate the task to provide

heating to the Municipality to Rézeknes Energija.*!°

After summarizing recent events the Mayor presented two options; the minutes of the

meeting do not reflect the discussion on those two options clearly,*!* but those options

are clearly outlined in a document prepared by the Mayor.*'> At the hearing, only the

Claimant brought witnesses to testify on what was said at that meeting.*!°

According to Option No. 1, Latgales Energija’s activity would be limited to the
production of thermal energy; Rézeknes Energija would be in charge of the
transmission and distribution, as well as the sale of thermal energy. According to
Option No. 2, Rézeknes Energija would take over production, transmission and
distribution as well as the sale of thermal energy and Latgales Energija would drop
out of the picture altogether, save for any legal proceedings which it might bring, as

such an event was expressly identified as a risk.*!7

Both options thus excluded that Latgales Energija would keep the position that had
been agreed upon under the agreements made with the Rézekne City Council on the
one hand (see paragraphs 100 ff. and 169 ff. above), and Rézeknes Siltumtikli on the
other (see paragraphs 78 ff. and 166 ff. above).

(C) | THE REZEKNES ENERGIA GAS SUPPLY AGREEMENT (17 OCTOBER
2007)

On 17 October 2007 Latgales Energija (as “the User”) entered into a gas supply
agreement with Rézeknes Energija (as “the Supplier”) (the “Rézeknes Energija Gas

Supply Agreement”).??7

Clauses 2.2 and 4.2 of the Rézeknes Energija Gas Supply Agreement provide that
Latgales Energija has a duty to pay the invoices for actual consumption of natural gas

issued by Rézeknes Energija.

(D) THE OCTOBER 2007 AGREEMENT (25 OCTOBER 2007)

On 23 October 2007 a meeting took place which paved the way for the execution of a

contract two days later.?”4

On 25 October 2007 an agreement was made between Latgales Energija, UAB E
Energija, Rézeknes Siltumtikli, the Rézekne City Council and Rézeknes Energija (the
“October 2007 Agreement”).*2> The October 2007 Agreement contemplated the

actions to be taken by each party, subdivided into three distinct stages as follows:
@ Stage I, covering the period from 25 October to 28 October 2007;

(ii) Stage II, covering the period from 25 October to 30 November 2007; and
(iii) Stage III, covering the period until 30 May 2008.

Stage I (Clauses (a) to (e)) in essence contemplated five points as follows:

(a) the parties undertook to take all necessary actions in relation to bailiffs in
order to remove the attachment of Latgales Energija’s accounts in the shortest
possible time to ensure free flow of funds; Rézeknes Siltumtikli was entitled to
challenge the court decisions only in order to have the attachment removed; the

parties would then reach a settlement by 30 May 2008 on the claim brought by

33 C151.
324 See CWS-1 | 105 and Transcript, Day 2, 75-76 [Strioga].
325 C.26,

 

 

72

Rézeknes Siltumtikli; no new proceedings would be brought and no new claims

would be made within the proceedings currently pending;

(b)  Latgales Energija undertook to grant discounts to users as from the date when

the Regulator would approve new rates;

(c) Latgales Energija would submit its calculations relating to a new rate to the
Rézekne City Council ten days before submitting them to the Regulator (see

paragraph 291 below);

(d) the parties undertook to sign a statement of acceptance and delivery upon the

installation and commissioning of a Witomax boiler at AtbrivoSanas aleja 155a; and

(e) Rézeknes Siltumtikli would give approval by 15 November 2007 in order for a
sub-lease agreement to be signed with SIA “LE Remonts” (“LE Remonts”) and with
SIA LE Kogeneracija (“LE Kogeneracija”) and would issue the documents required
in order for an application for the installation, commissioning and operation of a

cogeneration plant to be submitted to AS Latvenergo.
288. Stage II (Clauses (f) to (i)) in essence contemplated four further points as follows:

(f) | Rézeknes Siltumttkli would agree with E energija and Latgales Energija on
certain annotations to be cancelled in the Land Registry in relation to Rézeknes
Siltumtikli’s assets; a separate agreement was concluded between the Claimant and

Rézeknes Siltumtikli on 25 October 2007 to this effect; °7°

(g) the parties would prepare and submit to each other a list of complaints relating

to the Long-Term Agreement (see also paragraph 294 below);

(h) — the parties undertook to refrain from public announcements and complaints

unless previous agreement had been reached in that respect; and

(i) Rézeknes Energija undertook to supply natural gas to Latgales Energija in

accordance with the Rézeknes Energija Gas Supply Agreement; Rézeknes Energija

26 R33.
The Respondent contends that the purpose and the effect of this agreement goes far beyond what is
contemplated by the October 2007 Agreement, see paragraph 1125 below.

 

73

289.

290.

292.

and Latgales Energija would agree on a more detailed agreement within one month

as of the conclusion of the October 2007 Agreement.*?”

Finally, Stage III (Clauses (j) to (k)) in essence contemplated two points as follows:

(j) | Rézeknes Siltumtikli undertook to submit proposed amendments for the

revision of the Long-Term Agreement by 29 February 2008; and

(k)  Latgales Energija would submit its own suggestions and objections in relation
to the proposed amendments submitted by Rézeknes Siltumtikli by 25 March 2008,
which the parties would start to review within 15 days; the parties would coordinate

their amendments to the Long-term Agreement by 30 May 2008.

On 26 October 2007 however, Rézeknes Siltumtikli filed an ancillary complaint
against the Latgale Regional Court’s judgment of 17 October 2007 that had revoked

the attachment on Latgales Energija’s assets*?°.*?°

As a consequence, Latgales
Energija’s bank account remained frozen. That was a breach of the October 2007
Agreement on the part of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and the Municipality (see more in

detail paragraphs 964-967 below).

On 5 November 2007 Latgales Energija offered the Rézekne City Council reduced
rates (see paragraph 238 above).**° The reason for which Latgales Energija proposed
reduced rates to the Rézekne City Council rather than the Regulator lies in paragraph
(c) of the October 2007 Agreement (C-26, see also paragraph 287 above), in spite of

the fact that the letter does not expressly refer to the October 2007 Agreement.**!

On 7 November 2007 Latgales Energija wrote to the Rézekne City Council, Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija with respect to the performance of their obligations
under the October 2007 Agreement, pointing out that funds in its bank account were

still frozen by the attachment, requesting explanations as to the reasons why the

327 Clause 8.1 (in handwriting after the signature page) of the Rézeknes Energija Gas Supply Agreement
(C-151) seems to indicate that the parties did not have sufficient time to work out all contract terms
properly.

provisions of the October 2007 Agreement had not been complied with and
expressing its concerns that it would not otherwise be able to perform its own

obligations under the October 2007 Agreement.***

There is no answer to that letter on the record, either by the Rézekne City Council,

Rézeknes Siltumtikli or Rézeknes Energija.

On 29 November 2007 Latgales Energija informed the Regulator that it might be
unable to provide heat services.*** On 7 December 2007 the Regulator asked whether
Latgales Energija’s statements should be understood as an application in order for the
Regulator to revoke Latgales Energija’s licences.**+ On 12 December 2007 Latgales
Energija answered that its 29 November letter was sent simply to inform the

Regulator of the existing difficulties.**°

On 30 November 2007 Latgales Energija sent the Rézekne City Council and
Rézeknes Siltumtikli the list of its claims in relation to the Long-Term Agreement in
accordance with Clause (g) of the October 2007 Agreement.**° The list included

1337

claims against the Rézekne City Counci and claims against Rézeknes

Siltumttkli 8

 

Latgales Energija presented four claims against the Rézekne City Council:

(i) a claim for compensation of losses in an amount of LVL 138,069.24 arising from the lower
rates applied by Latgales Energija from | February to 1 October 2006 in spite of the fact that
the Rézekne City Council had not approved the heat supply development plan by 28 February
2006 as contemplated by the February 2006 Agreement (C-157 { 1.1);

(ii) aclaim for compensation of losses in the period from 11 September to 17 October 2007 due to
the need to use more expensive fuels and more expensive electricity to provide heating (C-157
1.2);

(iii) a claim in order that the Rézekne City Council sign the acceptance, delivery and
commissioning documents relating to the Witomax boiler (C-157 1.3); and

 

 

  

(iv) a claim for compensation of the legal costs incurred in the administrative proceedings (C-157
q 14).
Latgales Energija presented four claims against Rézeknes Siltumtikli:

(i) a claim for the compensation of the losses incurred due to Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s failure to
comply with the October 2007 Agreement with respect to the revocation of the attachment of
Latgales Energija’s bank account (C-157 2.1):

75

295.

On 30 November 2007 Latgales Energija wrote to Rézeknes Energija that it was
under no obligation for the time being to pay for the natural gas supplied since its
bank account had been attached and the Rézekne City Council, Rézeknes Energija
and Rézeknes Siltumtikli were in breach of their contractual duties under the October
2007 Agreement,**? in particular with respect to the duty to lift the attachment.
Reliance was placed by Latgales Energija on Article 1591 of the Latvian Civil

Code.*4°

The letter is not in evidence; it was referred to in Rézeknes Energija’s statement of

claim before the Riga Regional Court™!

2 March 2010.54

and the judgment made by the same court on

 

No answer to those letters is in evidence either on the part of Rézeknes Energija.

Rézeknes Energija’s position in this respect is summarised in the judgment by the
Riga Regional Court dated 2 March 2010.*4? Rézeknes Energija took the view that
the sole provision of the 2007 October Agreement which gave rise to a contractual

44 with which Rézeknes Energija had

duty binding on it was Clause 1, Stage II (i)
complied; Latgales Energija was not entitled to rely on the alleged breach of contract
of other contracting parties to withhold performance of a duty owed to Rézeknes

Energija.

On 10 December 2007 the Rézekne City Council replied to Latgales Energija’s letter
dated 30 November 2007 pointing out that on 28 February 2006 “the Council did not

have any document that could have been approved” as Latgales Energija had sent the

 

(ii) a claim to obtain Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s permission in order for Latgales Energija to enter into
a sub-lease agreement with RE Remont and LE Kogeneracia with respect to the cogeneration
plant (C-157 2.2);
(iii) a claim for compensation of the legal costs incurred in connection with the proceedings
brought by Rézeknes Siltumtikli on 20 September 2007 (C-157 { 2.3); and
(iv) aclaim for the payment of interest on a loan (C-157 J 2.4).

conditions” the Council began to hold meetings of the Working Group for the

development of the strategic plan.*4>

In a letter to Rézeknes Siltumtikli dated 27 December 2007 Latgales Energija pointed
out that Rézeknes Siltumtikli had failed to comply with its obligations under the
October 2007 Agreement by filing its complaint against the decision of the Latgale
Regional court on 26 October 2007 (see paragraph 290 above and paragraph 306
below). Latgales Energija asked Rézeknes Siltumtikli to tell the court at the hearing
scheduled to take place on 3 January 2008 that it did not maintain its complaint as far
as the revocation of the attachment of Latgales Energija’s bank account was

concerned.*4°

(E) _ LATGALES ENERGIJA’S ANSWER TO THE REGULATOR’S WARNING (4
OCTOBER 2007)
On 30 October 2007 Latgales Energija answered the Regulator’s warning dated
4 October 2007**” explaining the situation and applying for a discharge of the warning

(see more in detail at paragraph 990 below).*#®

(F) | THE 2007 ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT (4 DECEMBER 2007)

On 4 December 2007 Latgales Energija assigned its claims for payment for heating

and hot water supplied to Rézekne residents to LE Remonts (the “2007 Assignment

Agreement”),*“?

one of the Claimant’s wholly-owned subsidiaries according to the
Claimant.° The assignment related to an amount of LVL 379,480.94 owed to
Latgales Energija for heating and hot water supplied to Rézekne residents in the

period from 1 to 20 November 2007.

The purpose of such assignment was to enable Latgales Energija to continue to

operate and supply heat despite the attachment affecting its bank account.

Energija to explain the situation.*>!

On 19 December 2007 Latgales Energija answered the Regulator’s letter denying any

breach.

(5) | THE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AGAINST
LATGALES ENERGIA (20 SEPTEMBER 2007) AND THE ATTACHMENT OF
LATGALES ENERGIJA’S BANK ACCOUNT (21 SEPTEMBER 2007)

Differences of opinion between Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Latgales Energija regarding

the time when payment of depreciation was owed by Latgales Energija had emerged

in 2006 as recalled in paragraphs 193 ff. above. In his interview given on 13

September 2007 the Mayor had referred to that dispute in some detail, indicating that

Rézeknes Siltumtikli had instructed counsel from Riga the week before in order to sue

Latgales Energija.*>*

On 20 September 2007 Rézeknes Siltumtikli brought an action against Latgales

Agreement**>

assets, LVL 72,774.20 for a contractual penalty and LVL 29,164.41 for an

seeking payment of the amounts of LVL 778,415.41 for the lease of the

outstanding debt for gas delivered, in total LVL 880,354.02 and recovery against

Latgales Energija.°°

Rézeknes Siltumtikli further sought a declaration that the Long-Term Agreement was
terminated as of the date of the judgment to be made and that Rézeknes Siltumtikli
was entitled to recover the possession of the leased assets, as well as a declaration that

Latgales Energija was bound to pay in full the invoices presented by Latvijas Gaze.

Finally, Rézeknes Siltumtikli sought the attachment of Latgales Energija’s assets and

funds in cash held by banks and payments owed by any third parties.

On 21 September 2007 the Latgale Regional Court granted Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s
application and attached funds held in Latgales Energija’s bank account, including
debts owed by third parties to Latgales Energija, for an amount up to

LVL 880,354.02, with immediate effect.°57

On 5 October 2007 Latgales Energija applied to the Latgale Regional Court to have

the attachment cancelled.*°*

On 17 October 2007 the Latgale Regional Court revoked its decision granting the
attachment dated 21 September 2007, upheld Latgales Energija’s jurisdictional

objection and transferred the case to the Riga Regional Court on jurisdictional

grounds.>°?

On 26 October 2007 Rézeknes Siltumtikli brought an ancillary complaint against the
Latgale Regional Court’s judgment of 17 October 2007 before the Supreme Court,
asking the Supreme Court to set aside the judgment revoking the attachment of

Latgales Energija*

357 C_138 [page 3].

358 C-143.

The application sought a review of the attachment decision (C-138) as a matter of urgency on the basis
that the heating season would start by the following week according to the previous practice, and
Latgales Energija would increasingly need to use its money to purchase the fuel required for its
operations; if the attachment was maintained for more than two weeks, the city of Rézekne might be left
without heating and hot water (C-143 JJ 5-7). Latgales Energija raised an objection to the jurisdiction of
the court relying on the fact that its registered office was in Riga, but asked nonetheless the Court to
cancel the attachment decision as a matter of urgency (C-143 ff 16; 19-21; 54).

39 C_150 [page 3].

360 C-152.

Rézeknes Siltumttkli contended that the judgment by the Latgales Regional Court should be set aside and
a decision should be made on the merits. It argued that the subject-matter of Rézeknes Siltumttkli’s
action was the possession of the leased facilities including the immovable property since Rézeknes
Siltumtikli had sought the termination of the Long-Term Agreement. Rézeknes Siltumtikli further
contended that the Latgales Regional Court had jurisdiction on the basis that the assets in dispute were in
Rézekne and that jurisdiction lay also with the courts of the place where damage to the property in
dispute had been caused. The losses suffered by Rézeknes Siltumtikli could be caused by a breach of
contract, not only by a tort as found by the Latgales Regional Court.

This complaint was filed one day after the October 2007 Agreement”®’ was executed.

The Claimant contends that this was a breach of the October 2007 Agreement by the

Rézekne City Council and Rézeknes Siltumtikli.>°

As a result of that complaint, Latgales Energija’s bank account remained blocked.**

The Supreme Court made its decision on 3 January 2008 upholding Rézeknes

Siltumtikli’s appeal, so that the attachment remained in force.*™

The first decision on the merits was made by the Riga Regional Court on 9 July

2009.3

(6) | THE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REZEKNES ENERGIJA AGAINST LATGALES
ENERGIJA (27 DECEMBER 2007)

On 27 December 2007 Rézeknes Energija brought an action against Latgales Energija
in the Riga Regional Court seeking payment of an amount of LVL 810,819 plus
interest, and post-judgment interest, for deliveries of natural gas made to, and
accepted by, Latgales Energija.*°° Rézeknes Energija further sought the attachment of
Latgales Energija’s movable assets, an injunction restraining Latgales Energija from
dealing in emission allowances and the registration of a prohibition in the greenhouse
gas emission register with respect to Latgales Energija’s allowances for 2008-2012.°7
Rézeknes Energija rested its claim on the Gas Supply Agreement entered into with

Latgales Energija.**

Rézeknes Energija supplemented and increased its claim in 2008 (see paragraph 368

(7) SUPPLEMENTING CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN 2005 AND 2006 — NEW
ARRANGEMENTS

(A) FURTHER LOANS BY E ENERGIA TO LATGALES ENERGUA

On 21 January 2007 E energija amended the loan granted to Latgales Energija on
369

21 August 2006 by extending the date of reimbursement.
On 16 October 2007 E energija granted a further loan to Latgales Energija in an
amount of EUR 150,000.°” Then on 1 December 2007 E energija agreed to extend

the date of reimbursement of this loan.>7!

On 16 November 2007 E energija granted a further loan to Latgales Energija in an

amount of LVL 100,000.37”

(B) RESTRUCTURING OF E ENERGUA’S LOANS TO LATGALES ENERGIA (24
AUGUST 2007)

At the end of September 2006 the amounts owed by Latgales Energija to the Claimant
under various loans amounted to EUR 1,454,864 including interest.°7> On 24 August
2007 the loan was restructured and was taken over by Sampo Banka. This

arrangement lasted only a few months according to Mr. Jautakis’ evidence, since the

loan was transferred back from Sampo Banka to the Claimant in February 2008.°7>

The Claimant’s allegations and the explanations contained in Mr. Jautakis’ first
Witness Statement were not challenged by the Respondent; Mr. Jautakis was not

cross-examined at the Hearing.*”°

(C) CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE CLAIMANT AND THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT (SEPTEMBER/DECEMBER 2007)

A Subscription Agreement was entered into by E energija and the European Bank for

Reconstuction and Development (‘the Subscription Agreement”) on 26 September

2007.377

The Claimant further relies on a Loan Agreement it concluded with the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (“EBRD”) on 18 December 2007 (“the
EBRD Loan Agreement”).*”8

Both exhibits contain an unsigned version of such agreements.°” It is not in dispute,

however, that the Claimant concluded these agreements with the EBRD.*8°

According to Section 2.01 of the EBRD Loan Agreement, an amount of EUR 3.189

million was allocated for the Rézekne Project.**!

The Claimant drew on the loan in 2008,°* but admits that it did not draw on the loan

in connection with the Rézekne Project.**?

(D) | THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE CLAIMANT AND REZEKNES
SILTUMTIKLI (25 OCTOBER 2007)

An agreement was entered into by the Claimant and Rézeknes Siltumtikli on 25

October 2007 pursuant to Clause (f) of the October 2007 Agreement**4.38

377 C-139,

378 C-165; see also Cl. Mem. { 80.

39 The Claimant does not indicate the date on which such agreements were signed (Cl. Mem. { 80). In
his first Witness Statement, Mr. Strioga indicates that the EBRD Loan Agreement was eventually signed
in “December 2007” (CWS-1 4 55).

380 In particular, the Respondent relies on the fact that the EBRD is one of the Claimant’s shareholders
(see paragraph 471 below; Resp. Letter dated 5 October 2012 and Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. 4.7), which
the Managing Director of the EBRD for Central and South Eastern Europe confirmed in his letter dated
22 April 2010 (C-240). See also CWS-2 {| 73; Mr. Jautakis gave evidence but was not cross-examined at
the Hearing, see Transcript, Day 2, 82/14.

The purpose of this agreement was to free Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s property in the Land
Register from the encumbrances then recorded for the benefit of the Claimant in
consideration of payment by Rézeknes Siltumtikli of the debt owed to the Claimant
(Clauses 1 and 2 of the October 2007 Agreement).

It is the Respondent’s case that Clause 3 of this agreement contains a general waiver
of “any commercial claim directly and indirectly (including, through its subsidiary

Latgales Energija) against Rézeknes Siltumtikli”.*°°

MAIN EVENTs IN 2008

(1) TOWARDS THE REVOCATION OF LATGALES ENERGIJA’S LICENCES BY THE
REGULATOR (3 JUNE 2008)

(A) _ THE DISPUTE AS TO THE APPLICABLE RATES

Latgales Energija in fact continued to provide heating despite the Regulator’s decision
taking over its zone and the appointment of Rézeknes Energija as the person in charge
of providing heating services (11/12 October 2007, see paragraphs 274 ff. above).
After mid-December 2007 Latgales Energija had started to charge users in accordance
with the revised tariff approved by the Regulator on 9 November 2007 as it took the
view that the effects of the Regulator’s decision of 7 December 2007 were stayed due

to Latgales Energija’s application for review (see paragraph 244 above).

In January 2008 the Rézekne City Council wrote to users indicating (i) that the rate
applicable was the tariff approved on 19 December 2005 (see paragraph 154 above)

and (ii) that this was the sole rate which Latgales Energija was entitled to apply.**”

The same information was provided in the press.***

There was widespread confusion in the public as to the applicable rates. The local

newspaper echoed users’ anger and frustration.**?

386 Resp. P-H (PO8) § 23; see the Tribunal’s finding on this point in paragraphs 1130 ff. below.
387 C-184.2.

88 C169,

38 C-170 and C-171.

In spite of the apparently neutral stance of the Rézekne City Council (C-169), the press reported that the
Council had stated “unofficially” that the rates applied by Latgales Energija were “illegal” (C-170), and

83

326.

327.

328.

329.

The Mayor himself received the inhabitants and answered question on the
recalculation of rates according to the local newspaper.*”? The Claimant alleged that
the Municipality provided template letters for consumers to write to Latgales Energija
refusing to pay Latgales Energija’s invoices.**! This allegation is based solely on
Ms. USkane’s Witness Statement;*?? however, the Claimant has not referred to or
produced any specific templates or letters based on such templates. The Tribunal

finds that the Claimant has failed to prove such allegation.

On 25 January 2008 Latgales Energija issued a press release answering the criticism
to which it had been subjected in the press and elsewhere and recapitulated the

difficulties in having new rates approved.*”*

On 31 March 2008 the Rézekne City Council asked Latgales Energija to invoice the
Rézekne residents in accordance with the rates approved by the Regulator on
19 December 2005 (see paragraph 154 above) and to recalculate the invoices issued in

the previous months.*** On 7 April 2008 Latgales Energija objected.**>

(B) THE WIDER DISPUTE BETWEEN LATGALES ENERGIA, THE REZEKNE

Ciry COUNCIL AND THE COMPANIES CONTROLLED BY THE COUNCIL
On 16 April 2008 Latgales Energija reminded the Mayor that Rézeknes Siltumtikli
still had not granted the permit for the reconstruction of the Northern boiler house at
Atbrivosanas alejaé 155a in accordance with the Heating Supply Development

Strategy*”® approved by the Rézekne City Council on 21 September 2007.°7 No

answer to that letter is in evidence.

 

that the Mayor had told the press that the Council’s Reception Centre would show users how to calculate
the rates according to the December 2005 tariff (C-170).

Whereas it is Latgales Energija’s case that it was entitled to rely on the rates approved by the Regulator
on 9 November 2007, this exhibit states inter alia that “... the rate approved on 09.11.2007 has no legal
effect or legal foundation”. This does not seem to be a translation mistake.

On 25 April 2008 Latgales Energija wrote again to the Mayor, copying in the
Regulator, reiterating its request that the permit for the reconstruction be issued.***

No answer to that letter is in evidence.

On 6 May 2008 Latgales Energija asked Latvijas Gaze to issue technical
specifications for gas supply in the Northern boiler.*”? No answer to that letter is in

evidence.

These reminders followed up earlier reminders sent to Rézekne City Council*”° and
Rézeknes Siltumtikli**! back in 2007. Whereas in 2007 the investment relating to the
Northern boiler was hampered by the absence of a “heat supply development plan”, in
2008 the “Heating Supply Development Strategy” *°” had been in place for more than

six months; yet the permit for the works had not been delivered.

On 15 May 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli wrote to the Regulator pointing out that
Latgales Energija had failed to invest a minimum of EUR 1.5 million in the first three
years in which the Long-Term Agreement*? had been in force in breach of Clause
7.1.1 of such agreement and complaining about the condition of the heating

infrastructure.‘
Latgales Energija was not copied in on this letter.

On 19 May 2008 the Regulator wrote to the Rézekne City Council that Latgales

Energija had failed to comply with the conditions of the licences*”> and that the

licences could therefore be revoked as a consequence. The letter is not in evidence,
3406

but it is referred to in the Council’s letter to Latgales Energija dated 20 May 200:
On 20 May 2008 the Rézekne City Council wrote to Latgales Energija pointing out
“several circumstances” which in its view called into question Latgales Energija’s
ability to “solve issues concerning the heat supply”.*°” The letter referred on the one
hand to the Regulator’s letter of 19 May 2008 and the opinion expressed therein by
the Regulator (see paragraphs 334 ff. above) and, on the other, to difficulties reported

to the Council by Rézeknes Siltumtkli** and Rézeknes Energija.*”

The letter stated that the Council did not wish to interfere with the process of heat
production and distribution, and ended with an invitation to Latgales Energija to

establish a constructive partnership with Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija.

On 2 June 2008 Latgales Energija rejected the criticism expressed in the Council’s

letter.4!°

(2) | THE REVOCATION OF LATGALES ENERGIJA’S LICENCES BY THE
REGULATOR (3 JUNE 2008)

On 3 June 2008 the Regulator revoked Latgales Energija’s three licences to produce,
transmit and sell thermal energy*"' in its decision No. 10.*!? The decision stated that
it would come into force as of its adoption, that it should be enforced as a matter of
urgency and that its enforceability would not be prevented in case an application for
judicial review had been filed against it. The reasons for this decision are discussed in

paragraph 996 below.

Siltumtikli’s letter of 15 May 2008 (C-231, see paragraph 332 above).

409 As to Rézeknes Energija’s view, the Council referred to the debt owed by Latgales Energija to
Rezeknes Energija and stressed that Rézeknes Siltumtikli doubted Latgales Energija’s ability to pay its

On 5 June 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli sent Latgales Energija a notice requesting
Latgales Energija to rectify its breaches of contract within thirty days, failing which
the Long-Term Agreement would be “deemed terminated”.*'® The notice mentioned
a breach of Clause 7.3 of the Long-Term Agreement*!” and added that an accurate
account of the violations of laws and regulations was provided in the Regulator’s
decision revoking the licences. Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s notice of termination followed

on 10 September 2008.4!®

SILTUMTIKLI AND REZEKNES ENERGIJA AS THE PRODUCER AND THE
DISTRIBUTOR/SELLER OF THERMAL ENERGY (13 JUNE 2008)

On 13 June 2008 the Rézekne City Council appointed its deputy executive director,

Mr. Ivars Locis, as the person in charge of organising the provision of heating in the

city of Rézekne.*!?

On the same day Mr. Locis, acting as the person in charge under the Council’s
decision No. 270, appointed (i) Rézeknes Siltumtikli as the temporary new producer
of thermal energy and (ii) Rézeknes Energija as the temporary new provider,
distributor and seller of thermal energy; the decision is stated to have been made as a

matter of urgency.*”°

The decision further stated that as from 3 June 2008 Latgales Energija was no longer
entitled to provide any services of thermal energy, including hot water supply and

heating.

13 June 2008 decisions on 4 July 2008.4”? Such appeal is not in evidence; neither are

any decisions as may have been made further to such appeal.

(4) REZEKNE CITY COUNCIL’S REQUEST TO HAVE THE LEASED ASSETS
TRANSFERRED TO REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AND REZEKNES ENERGIA (27
JUNE 2008)

On 27 June 2008 Mr. Locis, acting as the person in charge, wrote to Latgales

Energija.*?? The letter first recapitulated Mr. Locis’ decision No. 1 of 13 June 2008

(see paragraph 341 above), adding that a new provider of heating services would have

to be appointed by 1 November 2008.

Having reiterated that Latgales Energija had been no longer entitled to provide
heating services as from 3 June 2008, Mr. Locis requested Latgales Energija to
appoint a representative by 7 July 2008*”* “to transfer the assets (premises, boilers and
others)” to Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija “to ensure the function of

thermal energy provision”.

On 7 July 2008 Latgales Energija answered Mr. Locis’ letter of 27 June 2008
explaining that it did not see any grounds to transfer the property leased from
Rézeknes Siltumtikli; having challenged in judicial proceedings both the Regulator’s
decision of 3 June 20084” and Mr. Locis’ decision No. 1 of 13 June 2008,47° Latgales
Energija explained that it saw no reason to comply with Mr. Locis’ decision of 27
June 2008; any attempt to enforce such decision in the circumstances would be

unlawful?”

(5) | REZEKNE CITY COUNCIL’S ORDER THAT LATGALES ENERGIJA PROVIDE
ACCESS TO THE BOILER HOUSES AND SURRENDER THE LEASED ASSETS
(14 JULY 2008)
On 7 July 2008 Mr. Locis, a Board Member of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and a bailiff went
to Latgales Energija’s offices in Rézekne and demanded that Latgales Energija hand
over the leased assets. Latgales Energija admits that it refused to do so,*”* but that no

enforcement took place there and then.*??

Latgales Energija alleges that it received on 11 July 2008 the court decision ruling
that the court did not have jurisdiction to review either the Rézekne City Council’s
decision of 13 June 2008** or the decision made by the person in charge of providing

A31 432

thermal energy in Rézekne on the same day’ The court decision is not in

evidence.

On 14 July 2008 the Rézekne City Council ordered Latgales Energija immediately to
provide access to all assets at all three boiler houses and transfer all other means
required for the provision of heating to Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes

Energija.**

On or about 24 July 2008 Latgales Energija applied to the Administrative District

Court to have this decision set aside;*** the court decided on 25 May 2010.435

(6) THE CLAIMANT’S NOTICE OF DISPUTE (1 SEPTEMBER 2008)

On 1 September 2008 the Claimant sent the Respondent a Notice of Dispute under
Article 7(1) of the BIT#°497

In the Notice of Dispute, the Claimant contended that the requirement of a dispute

other Party was met. The Notice added that there were no temporal issues regarding

the applicability of the BIT in the present case.

Claimant relied on five principles under the BIT: (i) Article 4(1) on expropriation, (ii)
Article 3(1) on fair and equitable treatment, (iii) Article 3(1) on full protection and
security, (iv) Article 3(2) on arbitrary or discriminatory measures and (v) the most-
favoured nation clause in Article 3(3) in connection inter alia with Articles 2(2) and

3(1) of the Latvia-Romania BIT.4**

The Notice of Dispute contains a statement of facts subdivided in four parts, setting
out (i) the situation of heating services in Rézekne before the Claimant’s investment,
(ii) the individualised invitation made by the Rézekne Municipality to the Claimant
with the long-term legal guarantees surrounding the investment, (iii) the result of the
Claimant’s investment on the heating services provided and (iv) the volte-face by the
Rézekne Municipality and its instrumentalities when they saw the emergence of an
efficient and profitable business, and the concerted effort of the Rézekne
Municipality, its instrumentalities, the police and the bailiffs to drive out the investor

and take over its business.

As to quantum, the Claimant argued that the breach of international law caused a
damage in an amount of LVL 7,141,757.08, as well as lost profits in an amount of

LVL 5,018,252, amounting to LVL 12,160,009.08 altogether.*°

(7) TERMINATION OF THE LONG-TERM AGREEMENT BY REZEKNES
SILTUMTIKLI (10 SEPTEMBER 2008)

On 10 September 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli sent Latgales Energija a notice of

termination under Clause 12.5.2 of the Long-Term Agreement*?.#4!

(8) | THE TAKING OVER OF THE LEASED ASSETS BY REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AND
THE FURTHER COURSE OF THE DISPUTE

(A) — REZEKNE CiTy COUNCIL’S DECISION AUTHORISING THE USE OF FORCE
TO ENFORCE THE 14 JULY 2008 DECISION (15 SEPTEMBER 2008)
On 15 September 2008 the Rézekne City Council authorised the use of force to
enforce the 14 July 2008 Council’s decision,“ with which Latgales Energija refused

to comply of its free will (see paragraph 1041 below).*#

The decision was stated to be enforceable forthwith, and any appeal would not operate

so as to stay its enforceability.

(B) THE FORCIBLE RECOVERY OF THE LEASED ASSETS (16 SEPTEMBER
2008)
On 16 September 2008 Latgales Energija’s administrative building (unlike the
customer service centre) was taken over, as well as the boiler houses. All assets of
Latgales Energija were taken over including those leased to Latgales Energija under
the Long-Term Agreement. Latgales Energija challenged this decision without

success (see paragraph 396 below).
Personal assets were handed back on 6 October 2008 (see paragraph 362 below).

Latgales Energija’s personnel were able to continue to work from the customer

service centre for a few days.**

From 16 September 2008 onwards, Latgales Energija’s assets as well as the leased
assets came into possession of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija which
started to operate the heating system. They have remained the operators of the

heating system ever since.”

This Deed is drawn up in 2 counterparts.
(D) THE FIRST MEETING BETWEEN THE PARTIES (5 DECEMBER 2008)

On 5 December 2008 a first meeting took place between the Parties in order to seek
an amicable solution to the dispute. Further meetings would take place in 2009 and

2010, and a final meeting took place on 1 April 2011.44”

(9) | THE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AGAINST
LATGALES ENERGIA

On 4 June 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli increased the amount of its original claims (see

paragraph 302 above) against Latgales Energija. Such amendments are not in

448

evidence, but are referred to in the decision by the Riga Regional Court™"” and the

Supreme Court of Latvia.*?

(10) | THE PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REZEKNES ENERGIA AGAINST LATGALES
ENERGIA

On 3 January 2008 the Riga Regional Court granted an attachment on Latgales

Rézeknes Energija’s application of 27 December 2007, which had been made in
connection with the action brought to claim payment of unpaid invoices relating to the

delivery of natural gas.*!

On 11 February 2008 Latgales Energija sought a declaration by way of counterclaim
that the Rézeknes Energija Gas Supply Agreement*? was null and void. The
counterclaim is not in evidence, but it was referred to in the decision of 16 April 2008

(see paragraph 369 below).

On 27 February 2008 Latgales Energija applied to the Riga Regional Court to have

453

the 3 January 2008 decision set aside;*°’ the application was supplemented on 3 April

2008 on the point of emission quotas.**4

On 10 April 2008 Rézeknes Energija supplemented its statement of claim; the amount
of the debt sought to be enforced was increased to LVL 2,528,766.10 excluding
interest based on further deliveries of natural gas made and invoiced by Rézeknes
Energija after 27 December 2007.*° A further supplement was filed in 2009 (see
paragraph 381 below).

On 16 April 2008 the Riga Regional Court granted Latgales Energija’s application in

part, revoking the 3 January 2008 injunction relating to the emission quotas; the

456

application to have the attachment revoked altogether was dismisse Latgales

Energija’s counterclaim for a declaration that the Rézeknes Energija Gas Supply
Agreement was null and void was held in abeyance pending payment of the full court

fee.

LATGALES ENERGIJA AND THE CLAIMANT (13 AUGUST 2008)

On 13 August 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli brought an action against Latgales Energija

and the Claimant before the Riga Regional Court. The document initiating the

proceedings is not in evidence; Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s claims are summarised in the

judgment made by the Supreme Court of Latvia on 7 March 2013.48

Rézeknes Siltumtikli sought a declaration that its duties and its debts arising under
Credit Agreement Nos. RA 02155 and 02219 (as amended by several covenants)
signed with Latvijas Unibanka (and referred to in the Guarantee Agreement*? and
Long-Term Agreement*’) had been discharged**! and that the pledges registered in
the Land Registry pursuant to such agreements had therefore also been discharged as
a consequence, and any entries in the Land Registry in relation to such pledges were
to be deleted; and, finally, a declaration that the 2008 Assignment Agreement‘? was

invalid.“

(12) SUPPLEMENTING CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN THE 2005-2007
PERIOD — NEW ARRANGEMENTS

(A) — CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE CLAIMANT AND THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
The Claimant alleges that the EBRD loan (see paragraphs 317 ff. above) “would have
ensured that Latgales Energija could make the further necessary investments in the

heating system”.#°5

Mr. Strioga explains in his first Witness Statement that the EBRD loan was drawn in

2008,4% which is confirmed by Mr. Jautakis’ first Witness Statement.*”

However, the Claimant further states that the part of the loan marked for Rézekne was
never drawn, and the planned investments were never made; it is also admitted that
the Claimant did not pay interest to the EBRD on this part of the loan.“ The
Claimant alleges that nevertheless a considerable portion of the expense of organising
and negotiating the loan from the EBRD was incurred in relation to the part allocated

to Rézekne.“”

On 5 March 2008 the Amendment Agreement in Connection with Various
Agreements Relating to Debt and Equity Investment in UAB E Energija (the
“Amendment Agreement) was entered into by ETC, UAB E Energy Invest (“EEI”, a
company incorporated in Lithuania), Mr. Virginijus Strioga (the “Sponsor”), UAB E-

(B) — REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI’S LONG-TERM DEBTS TAKEN OVER BY THE
CLAIMANT (25 JUNE 2008)
In February 2008 the Claimant took over from Sampo Banka the loan granted by the
bank to Latgales Energija on 24 August 2007 (see paragraph 315 above) in an amount
of LVL 1,135,028.4%

On 25 June 2008 Latgales Energija assigned to the Claimant the debt of Rézeknes
Siltumtikli, which it had purchased from LHV in 2006 (see paragraph 205 above),
under the terms of an assignment agreement (“the 2008 Assignment Agreement”).*”>
The amount which Latgales Energija owed the Claimant under the outstanding loan
was set off against the purchase price which the Claimant owed Latgales Energija
under the 2008 Assignment Agreement under the terms of an agreement of even date

(the “Supplement to the Assignment Agreement dated 25 June 2008”).47°

On 13 August 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli challenged the validity of the 2008
Assignment Agreement before the Latvian courts (see paragraph 371 above). On
7 March 2013 the Supreme Court held, on appeal, that the 2008 Assignment
Agreement was valid, but it also decided that Latgales Energija no longer owned a
debt against Rézeknes Siltumtikli on the basis that Latgales Energija owed itself a
debt to Rézeknes Siltumtikli under the Long-Term Agreement which gave rise to a
merger of rights and liabilities.4”’ Mr. Jautakis in his first Witness Statement refers to
a Latvian decision of 2009 holding that the assignment was invalid, but no such

decision is in evidence.4”8

Further arrangements were made in 2009 (see paragraph 411 below).

MAIN EVENTS IN 2009 AND BEYOND

(1) THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REZEKNES ENERGIJA AGAINST
LATGALES ENERGIA

On 14 January 2009 Rézeknes Energija filed a second supplement to its claims

against Latgales Energija.*”? The supplemented claim takes into account supplies of

natural gas made by the plaintiff and the payments made by the defendant, the

plaintiff claiming payment of an amount of LVL 2,434,423.01 excluding interest.

On 2 March 2010 the Riga Regional Court made a judgment for Rézeknes Energija
and dismissed Latgales Energija’s counterclaim.**” Latgales Energija appealed this
decision, but the appeal was dismissed;**! neither the appeal nor the decision on the

appeal is in evidence.

(2) THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AGAINST
LATGALES ENERGIA

Rézeknes Siltumtikli had brought an action against Latgales Energija on

20 September 2007 and the Latgale Regional Court had granted an attachment on

Latgales Energija’s funds on the following day (see paragraphs 301 ff. above).

Rézeknes Siltumtikli had not applied to the court in order that the attachment should

be lifted despite the undertakings contained in the October 2007 Agreement and

Latgales Energija’s complaints.**?

Rézeknes Siltumtikli amended its claims on the merits twice, first on 4 June 200843

and then on 17 June 2009.***

On 30 June 2009 Latgales Energija filed its answer to Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s

statement of claim.**°

On 9 July 2009 the Riga Regional Court granted Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s claims in
substantial part as follows:**° (i) the court “revoked” the Long-Term Agreement;**”
(ii) the court awarded the claim for payment of the lease with respect to

depreciation*®*

as well as (iii) the claim for payment of gas delivered and used.
However, the court dismissed (iv) the claim for payment of a contractual penalty and
(v) the request for a declaration that Latgales Energija was bound to pay the invoices

issued by Latvijas Gaze.**°

On 29 July 2009 Latgales Energija appealed against this judgment before the Supreme

Court of Latvia.4”°

On 20 April 2012 the Court Panel for Civil Matters of the Supreme Court of Latvia

dismissed Latgales Energija’s appeal.*?!

Latgales Energija filed an application to have this judgment set aside in cassation

proceedings. On 7 April 2014 the Supreme Court allowed the application, set the

 

485 C234.

Latgales Energija answered Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s claim for unpaid rent contending that the Long-Term
Agreement (C-4) was still in force and that the part of the rent relating to the depreciation of the assets
would be payable at the time the assets had to be returned to the plaintiff; therefore, Latgales Energija
was not in default (C-234 [pages 1-2]). It also followed that there were no grounds upon which the
Long-Term Agreement could be terminated (C-234 [page 3]).

 

 

Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s notice of termination of the Long-Term Agreement (C-180, see paragraph 339
above) was inconsistent with the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and it could therefore have no
effects whatsoever (C-234 [page 3]).

 

 

Finally, Latgales Energija answered that it was not bound to pay the invoices issued by Latvijas Gaze to
Rezeknes Siltumtikli for the natural gas supplied (C-234 [pages 3 ff.]). This was so on the basis that the
plaintiff did not have a licence to sell natural gas.

486 C_194.

487 It is unclear whether the court declared that Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s notice of termination was

effective and the Long-Term Agreement had terminated pursuant to such notice, or whether the Long-
Term Agreement was revoked by virtue of the judgment of the court.

488 The court held that the part of the lease payments owed for depreciation under Clause 4.4.2(a) of the
Long-Term Agreement was not payable until such time when the leased infrastructure would be
transferred back to the lessor, and Latgales Energija’s argument was accepted in this respect. As a
consequence, the claim for a contractual penalty was dismissed. However, payment of the part of the
lease relating to depreciation was ordered since the Long-Term Agreement was no longer in force
according to the court.

 

489 C.194 [page 10 (penultimate paragraph)], contains a typo in the original (the original text in Latvian
could not be checked as it was cut off in the pages filed attached to the translation) or a translation
mistake; “invoices issued by JSC Latgales Energija” should read “invoices issued by Latvijas Gaze”.

499 C-235.

The court stated that the judgment by the Riga Regional Court was “correct and sufficiently
substantiated”; the court therefore agreed with the court below and did not need to repeat the reasons
given by the Riga Regional Court (C-246 p. 15).

judgment aside and remitted the case to another court of appeal in order for a fresh
decision to be made.*?? On 30 November 2015 the Chamber of Civil Cases of the
Supreme Court of Latvia found that the Long-Term Agreement had been unilaterally
terminated on 16 September 2008 and awarded Rézeknes Siltumtikli its claim for
payment of the rent and for unpaid gas (judgment filed by the Respondent in this

arbitration on 19 December 2016).4%*

(3) DISMISSAL OF LATGALES ENERGIJA’S CHALLENGE AGAINST THE
REGULATOR’S DECISION TO REVOKE THE LICENCES (3 JUNE 2008) AND THE
JUDGMENT OF 16 JUNE 2009 (6 MAy 2010)

On 16 June 2009 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Energija’s
application’ to have the Regulator’s decision No. 10 dated 3 June 2008*°° set aside
by which the Regulator had revoked the three licences granted to Latgales Energija.1”°

Latgales Energija appealed against that decision.*””

42 Rg
43. The court found that Latgales Energija was under an obligation to pay for the gas supplied by
Latvijas Gaze in the amounts invoiced by Latvijas Gaze. The judgment considers the provisions of the
Long-Term Agreement, but not the February 2005 Agreement.

4°4 Latgales Energija’s application is not in evidence, but it is summarised in the Administrative Court of
Appeal decision in R-2. Latgales Energija made the following arguments.

First, the licences could be revoked only subsequent to a decision suspending them in accordance with
Sects. 17 to 19 of Regulation No. 664 on the Licensing of Public Utilities (CLA-56) and imposing a time
limit in order for the service provider to cure the breach(es) which caused the suspension. In the present
case the Regulator had failed to suspend the licences and fix a time limit in order for Latgales Energija to
cure any alleged breaches.

 

Secondly, a licence may be revoked provided, however, that a prior warning has been given to the
service provider at least three months in advance; the licence may be revoked within the month following
the expiry of the three-month time limit; a failure to comply with the one-month time limit requires the
whole procedure to be repeated. In the present case the licences were revoked almost five months after
the expiry of the notice period. Latgales Energija’s right to a stable and predictable legal position had
been breached.

Thirdly, the licences were revoked on a basis other than that which had been mentioned in the
Regulator’s warning of 4 October 2007 (C-22, see paragraph 262 above).

The Regulator opposed that both of the time limits relied upon by Latgales Energija were not applicable
to the revocation of a licence by the Regulator, and that Latgales Energija had been given an opportunity
to be heard and had failed to comply with the Regulator’s decisions.

495 C-29, see also paragraph 337 above.

°° R293.

Latgales Energija’s application to set aside was dismissed on 16 June 2009 on the basis that (i) the law
did not require that a decision revoking a licence should be preceded by one suspending the licence; (ii)
the Regulator had proceeded in accordance with the provisions of the Public Utility Regulators Act
(CLA-49); (iii) the Regulator was bound to give the utilities provider a three-month notice prior to
revoking a licence; (iv) however, the Regulator was not bound to make a decision within a month as from
the day on which the three-month time limit had expired as the Regulator was entitled to proceed on a

(4) DISMISSAL OF LATGALES ENERGIJA’S CHALLENGE AGAINST THE
REGULATOR’S DECISION NO. 12 DATED 11 JUNE 2007 (15 APRIL 2009)

On 15 April 2009 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Energija’s

application®”° to have the Regulator’s Decision No. 12 dated 11 June 2007°"' set aside

(by which the Regulator had rejected the new tariffs proposed by Latgales Energija on

29 May 2007°°7).5°3 The reasons given by the court are recalled and discussed in

paragraph 906 below.

On 14 May 2009 Latgales Energija appealed against the 15 April 2009 decision by the
Administrative District Court and applied to the court in order to be granted a fresh
time limit in which to bring its appeal. The appeal and the application are not in

evidence.5™*

On 27 May 2009 Latgales Energija’s application was denied and the appeal was

dismissed. This decision is not in evidence.*°

 

case-by-case basis and it was not necessary, therefore, to repeat the procedure as contended by the
applicant; and (v) the breaches of paragraphs 7.1, 7.2 and (indirectly) 6.2 of the licences had been
substantiated in the Regulator’s decision and the applicant had been notified in previous correspondence
and had been provided with an opportunity to cure such breaches. The Regulator’s decision was
therefore in accordance with law and the application to set aside was to be dismissed.

2006 (C-19, see paragraph 184 above); the Regulator’s decision No. 12 dated 11 June 2007 (C-21, see
paragraph 233 above) was also challenged with the amended application, and Latgales Energija limited
its challenge to the latter decision in its amended application (see paragraph 186 above).

Latgales Energija appealed against the decision of 27 May 2009, and the appeal was

(5) DISMISSAL OF LATGALES ENERGIJA’S COMPLAINT AGAINST THE
ENFORCEMENT OF THE COUNCIL’S DECISION NO. 316 OF 14 JULY 2008 BY
FORCIBLE MEANS (2 JULY 2009)

On 2 July 2009 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Energija’s
complaint against the Rézekne City Council and the State Police that the enforcement
of Rézekne City Council’s decision No. 316 dated 14 July 2008°°’ by forcible means

was unlawful.*°® Latgales Energija’s complaint is not in evidence.

506 R-1. It is unclear whether the appeal was denied by the Latvian Administrative Appeal Court, as
stated in the Respondent’s exhibit list, or the Administrative District Court, as stated in the translation of
Exhibit R-1; the name of the court in Latvian is Administrativa rajona tiesa. The Tribunal takes it that it
is the Administrative District Court.

507 €.33, see paragraph 349 above.

508 RG.

The court stated that its decision related solely to the question whether the procedure of enforcement by
forcible means was lawful, not the question whether the decision to be enforced was itself lawful (R-6 {
5). The court considered that the decision to be enforced had come into force and had not been executed
voluntarily by Latgales Energija (R-6 J] 10). The court found that the decision to be enforced was not
final and enforceable, but an exception to the rule applied where the decision to be enforced stated that
enforcement was required as a matter of urgency to avert a danger to State security, public order, the life
or the health or property of citizens. The court found that there was a risk in the present case that the
supply of heating in the city of Rézekne could not be ensured unless the heating infrastructure was taken
over, and that the decision to be enforced contained sufficient indications as to the need to ensure that
heating services should continue to be provided (R-6 { 10). This was so in spite of the fact that the
decision to be enforced had been made on 14 July 2008 and the warning preceding enforcement was
dated 15 September 2008 (R-6 10).

The court further found that the warning contained all the indications required by law, including a
direction to the addressee to comply with the decision voluntarily; Latgales Energija’s objections raised
on that basis were without foundation (R-6 J 11).

 

The court went on to examine whether the 15 September 2008 (C-186) warning of enforcement by
forcible means contained an advance notice which was in accordance with the Administrative Procedure
Act, since enforcement by forcible means had been announced for the following day, when enforcement
in fact took place. The court found that the warning was lawful considering the urgency and the need to
protect the health and property of the city inhabitants (R-6 J 12).

 

 

The court found that Latgales Energija had not argued that the use of force was disproportionate and that
there were no elements on the record suggesting that direct force had been applied at all, or had been
applied inappropriately (R-6 | 13).

The court dismissed Latgales Energija’s complaint also insofar as it was directed against the State Police,
having found that Latgales Energija argued that the police officers had not applied physical force “but
their presence was sufficient to give an impression that the use of such force was real”. Considering that
Latgales Energija could reasonably be expected to resist the enforcement of the decision by forcible
means, the presence of police officers was lawful and justified (R-6 {{ 14).

 

The court finally considered Latgales Energija’s complaint that it had been denied access to its property
left in the building as a consequence of the fact that it was denied access to its offices. The court found
that Rézeknes Siltumttkli had drawn up a notice to Latgales Energija requesting the offices premises to

(6) DISMISSAL OF LATGALES ENERGIJA’S CHALLENGE AGAINST THE COUNCIL’S
DECISION NO. 316 OF 14 JULY 2008 (25 May 2010)

On 25 May 2010 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Energija’s

challenge against the Rézekne City Council’s decision No. 316 dated 14 July 2008°

(by which the Council had decided that Latgales Energija was immediately to provide

access to all assets at all three boiler houses and transfer all other means required for

the provision of heating to Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija).>!°

The Administrative District Court considered that the Regulator’s decision revoking
the licences had to be enforced as a matter of urgency as the Rézekne City Council
had a duty to decide how to organise the heat supply services for the residents of the
city. The Council’s assessment was reasonable in that the restriction of Latgales
Energija’s private rights had to give way to the public interest represented by the

interest of the 25,000 residents of Rézekne to be provided with heat supply services.

The Court finally dismissed Latgales Energija’s complaint that the Council’s decision
amounted to a forced taking of Latgales Energija’s property which was not based on
law and did not provide for a fair compensation; the Court stated that it was true that
the Council had not considered the issue of the value of Latgales Energija’s
investment in its decision, and Latgales Energija was therefore entitled to proceed in
accordance with the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and claim the market price of

the investments made.

 

vacated on 16 September 2008 and asking Latgales Energija personnel to return on 22 September 2008 to
receive their personal belongings and vacate the premises. Latgales Energija maintained that it had
received such notice only on 22 September 2008. Rézeknes Siltumtikli then sent Latgales Energija a
letter on 29 September 2008 stating that Latgales Energija’s belongings would be transferred on 6
October 2008. The Court concluded that Rézeknes Siltumtikli therefore had taken possession of Latgales
Energija’s belongings for some time, but had taken prompt action to return them. That was a breach of
procedure, but its importance was not sufficient to cause the whole enforcement procedure to be unlawful
(R-6 f{ 15).

(7) DISMISSAL OF LATGALES ENERGIJA’S CHALLENGE AGAINST THE
REGULATOR’S DECISION NO. 35 DATED 7 DECEMBER 2007 AND THE
JUDGMENT DATED 30 OCTOBER 2009 (23 SEPTEMBER 2010)

On 12 December 2007 Latgales Energija had challenged the Regulator’s decision No.
35 of 7 December 2007°!! by which the Regulator had annulled its previous decision
of 9 November 2007 approving the draft tariffs proposed by Latgales Energija; the
challenge was dismissed by a decision of the Administrative Regional Court of 30

October 20095!?.5!3

Latgales Energija appealed against that judgment; the appeal was dismissed by the

Administrative Regional Court on 23 September 2010.°!*

REGULATOR’S DECISION NO. 26 DATED 11 OCTOBER 2007 AND THE
JUDGMENT DATED 31 MARCH 2010 (24 NOVEMBER 2011)

On 31 March 2010 the Administrative District Court dismissed Latgales Energija’s

application to have the Regulator’s decision No. 26 of 11 October 2007°"* set aside.*!©

Latgales Energija appealed against this judgment. The appeal was dismissed by the

Administrative Regional Court on 24 November 2011.°!7

The Administrative Regional Court stated that it was not in dispute that Latgales

Energija had failed to provide heat supply to the entire Northern housing estate of

518

Rézekne including six schools. The court then considered Latgales Energija’s

defence that the failure to provide heat supply had been caused by coordinated action
on the part of the Rézekne City Council and Rézeknes Siltumtikli, which it dismissed

as unproven. The court dealt with three distinct points.

First, the court found that it was Latgales Energija’s failure to pay in full the amounts
for which Latvijas Gaze issued invoices to Rézeknes Siltumtikli in June, July, August
and September 2007 which gave rise to the Council’s debt to Latvijas Gaze and the
suspension by Latvijas Gaze of the natural gas supply. As a consequence, the Council

announced the energy crisis which was the basis for the Regulator’s decision.*!?

Secondly, the court held that Latgales Energija’s argument that the Regulator’s
decision was affected by a conflict of interest on the basis that deputies of the Council

had taken part in its making was without foundation.*”°

Thirdly, the court examined Latgales Energija’s defence that the attachment of funds
obtained by Rézeknes Siltumtikli on Latgales Energija’s bank account (see paragraphs
253 to 255 above) was the cause of Latgales Energija’s inability to pay. The court
found that such might have been the case; however, even in such case Latgales
Energija was not released from its duty to provide its services on a continuous basis
throughout the period of validity of the licences and in accordance with the terms

thereof.

(9) THE CIVIL PROCEEDINGS BROUGHT BY REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AGAINST
LATGALES ENERGIJA AND THE CLAIMANT

Rézeknes Siltumtikli appealed against the judgment made by the Riga Regional Court
on 23 September 2010 dismissing the action brought against Latgales Energija and the

Claimant on 13 August 2008 (see paragraph 371 above).

On 7 March 2013 the Latvian Supreme Court allowed the appeal.*””

(10) | SUPPLEMENTING CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS MADE IN THE 2005-2008
PERIOD — NEW ARRANGEMENTS

(A) | PAYMENT BY THE CLAIMANT UNDER THE PARENT COMPANY

GUARANTEE DELIVERED TO SAMPO BANKA/DANSKE BANK
On 30 June 2009 Danske Bank (formerly Sampo Banka*”>) requested the Claimant to
pay an amount of LVL 1,218,056.16 under the Sampo Banka Guarantee**.**> Danske
Bank stated in its request to the Claimant that Latgales Energija had failed to pay its
debt under the Sampo Banka Loan Agreement.*° According to Mr. Jautakis’ first
Witness Statement, the Claimant paid the principal amount (LVL 1,118,056.16) as
well as interest (LVL 184,091.68), and thus a total amount of LVL 1,302,147.84 to
Danske Bank. Reliance is placed on Exhibit C-196.°?”

On 5 August 2009 Danske Bank and the Claimant agreed on a repayment schedule
contemplating ten instalments;*** the repayment schedule was amended twice, first
under the terms of an agreement dated 17 May 2010°*? and then under the terms of an

agreement dated 26 April 2011.>*°

On 9 November 2012 Danske Bank confirmed to the Claimant’s auditors that the

Claimant had no outstanding obligations to the bank.**!

The payment by the Claimant of a total amount of LVL 1,302,147.84 to Danske Bank
was alleged by the Claimant in its first memorial of 6 December 2013; such
evidence was not disputed by the Respondent in its first Counter-Memorial.
Mr. Jautakis’ evidence was not challenged by the Respondent at the Hearing (see

paragraph 315 above). However, the Respondent challenged that there was evidence

that the Claimant paid the amount of the guarantee to Danske Bank for the first time

The Tribunal dismisses that objection based on the documents in evidence in relation
to the guarantee provided by the Claimant to Danske Bank, as amended, and Danske
Bank’s request for payment.>*+ If the Respondent intended to challenge the statement

made by Danske Bank to the Claimant’s auditors,’ it should have raised this point in

its pleadings and called the auditors and cross-examined them at the Hearing.

(B) | ARRANGEMENTS FOLLOWING THE 2008 ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

The circumstances in which the 2008 Assignment Agreement was made are

summarised in paragraphs 377 ff. above.

Mr. Jautakis’ first Witness Statement>** explains that the Latvian courts held in 2009
that the 2008 Assignment Agreement between the Claimant and Latgales Energija
was invalid; however, no such decision is in evidence, as noted in paragraph 379
above. In the same passage of his first Witness Statement, Mr. Jautakis refers to

Exhibit C-190, which states that on 30 June 2009 the Claimant and Latgales Energija

 

“cancelled the agreement and cession was left in SIA Latgales Energija”.°” That

allegation is not supported by documentary evidence.

Mr. Jautakis further explains in his first Witness Statement that the Claimant then
assigned its right to claim from Latgales Energija to Hansel Realty Management

Spain S.L., a Spanish company.***

This assignment refers to a debt of Latgales
Energija in an amount of EUR 1,386,967.69 (without interest and penalties) arising
under a loan agreement dated 30 June 2009 which is not in evidence. Mr. Jautakis
explains that no monies have been recovered to date from Latgales Energija in spite of

a judgment by the Vidzeme Urban District Court of the city of Riga.”

(C) THEEBRD Loan (29 OcToBER 2009)

On 29 October 2009 the EBRD Loan Agreement™° was renegotiated.*4! Mr. Jautakis
explains that this revision was made upon the EBRD’s request, and the interest rate

charged on tranche 2 was increased from 1.95% to 5% per annum.*4?

THE LITHUANIAN DECISIONS RELIED ON BY THE RESPONDENT (FROM 2005 TO
2011)

The Respondent contends that the Claimant should have taken certain precautions
before entering into the Long-Term Agreement in order to avoid contentious issues,
such as the question of who was responsible to devise a “heat supply development

plan”.

Reliance is placed by the Respondent on Exhibit R-19 which includes news published
in Lithuania as well as twelve decisions made by Lithuanian judicial authorities, in
support of the allegation that “it is actually Claimant’s (its ultimate beneficiary—Mr.
Virginijus Strioga’s) common practice to enter into deals with high potential that
serious contentious issues will later arise (mainly, due to lack of precisely defined
tules of cooperation) and subject to tedious litigation proceedings (...) rather than

properly arranging for future cooperation in advance by all involved parties”.**

The Tribunal will examine that aspect in due course in light of Exhibit R-19 and the

Parties’ pleadings (see paragraphs 547 ff. below).>##

THE NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN THE PARTIES FROM 1 SEPTEMBER 2008 ONWARDS

The present account of the negotiations between the Parties is based inter alia on the
correspondence filed by the Respondent with the ICSID Secretary-General attached to
its letter dated 6 September 2012 by way of two attachments (filed electronically as
“Enclosure 1” and “Enclosure 2”). Such correspondence was not re-filed before the
Tribunal in accordance with the requirements of Procedural Order No. 1 and it will
therefore be identified simply by reference to the original electronic file in which it

was filed designated by the expressions “Enclosure 1” and “Enclosure 2”.

The Claimant’s Notice of Dispute dated 1 September 2008 was received by the
Respondent on 25 September 2008.°*4* On 24 November 2008 the State Chancellery
of Latvia invited Mr. Strioga to a meeting with Mr. Mékons, the representative of the
State Chancellery in charge of the matter.*#° The meeting took place on 5 December
2008; thereafter, Mr. Mékons put a number of questions to the Claimant’s

representatives,”*” which the Claimant answered on 22 December 2008.>48

On 11 March 2009 Latvia’s Prime Minister Mr. Ivars Goldmanis informed the

the Republic of Latvia.*°°

Claimant that the Government had asked a third neutral party having knowledge of
the circumstances in dispute to give his views about particular aspects of the Notice of
Dispute, which was not to be construed as an acknowledgment of any liability on the

part of the Respondent.**!

On 23 September 2009 Mr. Mékons sent the Government’s proposal to counsel for

calling it a “zero compensation proposal” and pointing out that it was entitled “to

move the dispute to international arbitration”.*>+

On 27 October 2009 the Respondent made a further proposal for a settlement

involving no monetary compensation.*

7

That communication is relevant to the

interpretation of the Claimant’s Board Minutes dated 1 December 2009 and will

therefore be quoted verbatim:>**

The Claimant rejected the Respondent’s proposal on 6 November 2009.

Dear Aleksas [Mr. Jautakis],

As I expressed to you this morning, and, in line with last week’s discussion, I
wish to outline in writing the view of the Rézekne municipality concerning the
settlement model.

The Rézekne municipality, after carefully [sic] analysis of the financial position
of SIA “Latgales Ener; , namely, the claims of the creditors and different
charges and interest over the assets of the company, considers that a fair
solution would be a solution not involving additional payment from any of
the parties.

 

 

In addition to waiver of claims against the company, all assets of SIA “Latgales
Energija” attached for the benefit of the Rézekne municipality would be lifted
by virtue of an application of the Rézekne municipality to the relevant court,
thus releasing the frozen funds of the company. As a reciprocal commitment
from SIA “Latgales Energija” and UAB “E energija”, we expect all claims
against the State and the Rézekne municipality to be waived accordingly.

If, unfortunately, you deem such a solution unacceptable, the State Chancellery
will immediate put forward its alternative proposal for the settlement model,
namely, the mediation pursuant to the Latvian-Lithuanian BIT. As a dispute
pursuant to a BIT emanates from a certain set of factual circumstances (no BIT
contains abstract obligations of the State apart from actual State behaviour
within its territory), we consider it proper to bring to the attention of the
mediator or the mediation panel all claims surrounding the circumstances (that
is, claims of E energija and claims of the Rézekne municipality). With due
regard to international practice, the State Chancellery is of the view that
mediation is an expedite, confidential and cost-efficient solution.

That

communication is also relevant to the interpretation of the Claimant’s Board Minutes

dated 1

December 2009 and it reads as follows:

Dear Mr. Ivars Mekons,

Referring to your proposal sent by e-mail correspondence dated 27" October
2009, we are informing that such resolution is not acceptable to us, because, as
we understand it, the resolution proposal does not include monetary
compensation to us.

As indicated in our claim and through all the subsequent communication, we are
of a position that our investment in Latvia was expropriated without proper
compensation for the incurred losses of the investor. Consequently, fair

558 C-247.

110

427.

428.

429.

resolution of the dispute cannot in our view be achieved if no compensation is
offered.

As far as mediation is concerned, we could have seen its benefit at the early
stage of our attempts to resolve the dispute amicably. However, taking into
consideration that our intensive mutual attempts to reach a settlement already
last 14 months and have not resulted in any approximation of the positions of the
parties, we do not see how at this stage the mediation procedure can lead to the
settlement of the dispute.

Based on that, regretfully we have to conclude that we are left with no other
alternative but to bring this matter to arbitration.

On 25 November 2009 the Respondent took note of the rejection of its proposal by

the Claimant and suggested mediation again in the following terms:>°°

(.)

Therefore, as I already explained to you, as an alternative to a “zero-zero
payments” solution, as a feasible alternative I deem the mediation process,
whereby the parties, pursuant to the BIT, would have an impartial
professional evaluation on the merits of their claims. Mediation, of course,
generally is not binding and the parties are free to accept or reject the proposals
from the mediation panel. However, and the practice increasingly confirms
this, especially in the BITs disputes, that the disputing parties can
beforehand freely enter into a contractual commitment to abide by the
resolution of the mediation panel. As the mediation panel should be chosen
from the pool of arbitrators and energy experts, the mediation package which I
propose is actually akin to the arbitration process with much more efficient
(the merits would be considered from both legal and professional aspects),
expedite and cheaper solution.

 

(.)
In my last email I did not have the opportunity to explain in details the
mediation package. Therefore, I would indeed appreciate if you consider this
and engage in further talks regarding this proposal.
On 27 November 2009 the Respondent answered two questions from the Claimant in
relation to the proposed mediation, indicating (i) that the Republic of Latvia would
enter into “a legally binding agreement on the process of settlement ...” and (ii) that

the ICSID Conciliation Rules could be used.°®

It is in this context which the Claimant’s Board made the resolution evidenced by the

Board Minutes dated 1 December 2009.°°!

On 25 January 2010 the Respondent made a further proposal for a settlement,*?
which the Claimant rejected on 5 February 2010.°° On the same date, the Claimant
answered a further email by the Respondent, indicating what its minimum

4

requirements for a settlement would be in financial terms,*°*t whereupon the

Respondent proposed that the Parties turn again to the mediation proposal.

On 8 February 2010 the Claimant answered as follows: “As we informed [the] State
Chancellery by our letter dated on 6/11/2009 No. 186, we do not see how at this stage
the mediation procedure can lead to the settlement of the dispute. We do not have

ground on changing our decission [sic]”>°

On 25 February 2010 the Respondent volunteered to draft “a settlement agreement as

regards mediation”.*© No answer to that email is in evidence.

On 25 June 2010 the Claimant enquired with the Respondent whether all the
possibilities to resolve the dispute amicably had been exhausted in light of the fact
that their upcoming Board meeting would have the investment dispute on the

agenda.*”

On 14 July 2010 the Deputy Director of the State Chancellery answered suggesting a
meeting in person or a conference call to be attended by the Claimant, the State
Chancellery and the Rézekne municipality and asking the Claimant to contact Mr.

Mékons.**

Thereafter, negotiations halted. The final meeting took place on 1 April 2011 which
followed a meeting on 18 March 2011.°% The following correspondence was

exchanged by email between the Parties after the 18 March 2011 meeting.

Following your meeting with Mr. Virginijus Strioga, E energija CEO last
Friday, I am writing to agree on the date and time convenient for you for the
meeting in Riga this week to further discuss the Rézekne case and potential
international arbitration.

(.)
The Legal Adviser to the Latvian Prime Minister followed up with her own email
confirming the meeting for 1 April 2011 and had pointed out the following in her
email to the Claimant:*”!

Let me also emphasise that this meeting shall not be considered as a meeting

under the auspices of the Latvian-Lithuanian investment protection treaty. For

certain factual and legal reasons the Republic of Latvia sees the investment

dispute as closed, and, consequently, the meeting shall be deemed solely as a

good faith effort of Latvia outside the scope of the State’s international

obligations and with no negative legal or financial consequences arising out of it
to Latvia.

The Claimant’s answer confirms its intention to attend the meeting of 1 April 2011. It
does not express any agreement or disagreement with the passage set out in the

preceding paragraph.
THE PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF

THE CLAIMANT
In its Request for Arbitration the Claimant seeks the following relief:>””

(...) the Claimant respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:

(a) declare that the Respondent has breached Articles 4(1), 3(1) and 3(2) of
the BIT;

(b) order the Respondent to pay damages for the material loss incurred in
an amount to be established, but which the Claimant currently
estimates will represent in excess of EUR 7 million, an amount which
the Claimant reserves the right to quantify at a subsequent stage in this
arbitration by expert evidence;

(c) order the Respondent to pay the costs of this arbitration, including all
expenses that the Claimant has incurred or shall incur herein in respect
of the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, the International Centre for
the Settlement of Investment Disputes, legal counsel, experts and
consultants, as well as its own internal costs;

(d) order the Respondent to pay interest at a rate to be established on the
amount of the award; and

(e) order such other and further relief as the arbitrators shall deem just and
proper.

In its first Memorial the Claimant amended the relief originally sought on three

points:°7>

@ the amount in point (b) in the preceding paragraph was increased to

EUR 9,820,000; and

(ii) point (d) on interest, set out in the preceding paragraph, was replaced by two
paragraphs reading as follows:
(d) order the Respondent to pay interest, compounded quarterly, at the
rates set out in paragraph 366 above on the amount of the damages
awarded from the date of expropriation until the date of the award;
(e) order the Respondent to pay interest, compounded quarterly, at the

rates set out in paragraph 366 above on the amount awarded from the
date [of] the award until payment by the Respondent; and

In its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections the
Claimant requests that the Tribunal deny the Respondent’s “preliminary objections”
to jurisdiction. The Claimant decreased the amount sought on the merits to
EUR 8,300,000,°" then increased such amount to EUR 8,390,000 in its Skeleton

Argument.>”>

In its Response to Questions Raised by the Tribunal the Claimant seeks an award of
costs in a total amount of EUR 3,083,279.25, which includes a success fee.°”° The

breakdown of such amount is as follows:

(i) EUR 1,835,005.31 for legal fees and expenses of Salans/Vinson & Elkins
(including a success fee of EUR 1,298,900);

(ii) EUR 604,768.73 for legal fees and expenses of Sorainen;

In the alternative, should the Tribunal consider that success fees should not be
awarded as part of any award on costs, the Claimant seeks an award of costs in a total

amount of EUR 1,688,928.85.5”7 The breakdown of such amount is as follows:
(i) EUR 744,945.98 for legal fees and expenses of Salans/Vinson & Elkins;
(ii) EUR 300,477.66 for legal fees and expenses of Sorainen;

(iii) EUR 263,474.72 for expert costs (Brattle Group and Dr. Blumberga); and

THE RESPONDENT

In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation, and Counter-

Memorial on the Merits the Respondent seeks the following relief:>”*

(...) the Respondent kindly requests the Tribunal to:

1) declare that, in accordance with Article 41(6) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules, the dispute is not within the competence of the Tribunal because
of aspects mentioned in Section 4.1) and 4.2) of this document;

or

2) declare that, in accordance with Article 41(6) of the ICSID Arbitration
Rules, this arbitration proceeding is to be suspended pending the final
and binding adjudication in Latvian courts of the local judicial civil
proceeding No. C03051107,

or
3) declare that the Respondent has not breached the Treaty; and
4) deny all Claimant’s requests for relief (as specified in the Claimant’s

Memorial, paragraphs 370 to 371):

5) order the Claimant to compensate all expenses incurred by the
Respondent pertaining to this arbitration proceeding (together with the
Latvian statutory interest rate of 6% a year until payment), as well as
the fees and expenses of the Honorable Members of the Tribunal.

The Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits does not contain a section setting out the

relief sought.

The Respondent maintains in its Skeleton Argument that it sought the dismissal of all
of the Claimant’s claims and an award of costs covering its fees, costs and expenses
as well as the Tribunal’s fees, costs and expenses, and that it sought the stay or the

termination of the proceedings (and an award of costs also in such case).

In its Post-Hearing Submission in Response to the Tribunal’s Questions the
Respondent seeks an award of costs in an amount of no less than EUR 162,556.28.5”

The breakdown of such amount is as follows:

@ EUR 12,247.27 for the legal fees and expenses of the State Chancellery;
(ii) EUR 114,035 for consultancy fees (in connection with the expert report);
(iii) EUR 17,069.86 for translation costs;

(iv) EUR 2,121.37 for courier services; and

(v) EUR 17,082.78 for the legal fees and expenses of the Rézekne Municipality.

In its Response to the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 9 the Respondent increased the
amount claimed for legal fees and expenses from EUR 12,247.27 to EUR 16,246.27
and therefore the Respondent seeks an award of costs in an amount of no less than

EUR 166,555.28.5°°

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION ON JURISDICTION

(dd) JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

In its Memorial the Claimant refers to the arguments made in its Request for
Arbitration regarding the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae in which the

Claimant submitted the following:**>

(i) both Parties have consented to arbitration in accordance with the ICSID

Convention and the BIT;

the part of the Claimant.>”°

(B) CLAIMANT AS AN INVESTOR UNDER THE BIT

The Claimant contends that it is an investor within the meaning of Article 1(2)(a)(ii)
of the BIT**! as it is a “company constituted under the laws of the Republic of
Lithuania and registered in the territory of Lithuania in conformity with its laws and

regulations”.*°*

(C) CLAIMANT AS A NATIONAL OF THE REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

The Claimant further contends that it is “a national of another Contracting State”

entity and registered tax payer incorporated in, and a national of, Lithuania on the date

that the Request was submitted.°”?

(2) JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE

materiae:**
(i) the Claimant made an “investment” within the meaning of the BIT;

(ii) the Claimant made an “investment” within the meaning of Article 25 of the

ICSID Convention;

(iv) such dispute constitutes a “legal dispute arising directly out of an investment”

within the meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

(A) AN “INVESTMENT” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE BIT

The Claimant submits that it made an “investment” within the meaning of Article 1(1)

of the BIT,** which investment includes the following in the present case:°°°
@ the shares in Latgales Energija (Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT);>°”

(ii) the provision of loans to Latgales Energija to fund Latgales Energija’s

operations (Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT);>°*

(B) — AN “INVESTMENT” WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 25 OF THE ICSID
CONVENTION

The Claimant contends that it has made an “investment” also within the meaning of

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as it made both a long-term and substantial

commitment to take over the Municipality-owned district heating system, which

required an assumption of risk°°° and was significant for the development of the

Republic of Latvia.”

(C) A “DISPUTE CONCERNING INVESTMENT” WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
BIT
The Claimant contends that its dispute with the Respondent constitutes a “dispute
concerning investment” within the meaning of Article 7(1) of the BIT®® as such
dispute concerns breaches of the BIT that arose directly out of the Claimant’s
investment, such as the expropriation of Claimant’s investment, the breach of the fair
and equitable treatment obligation, the breach of the full protection and security
obligation, the arbitrary and discriminatory treatment of Claimant’s investment and
the breaches of the most-favoured nation treatment obligation.%”
(D) A “LEGAL DISPUTE ARISING DIRECTLY OUT OF AN INVESTMENT”
‘WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 25 OF THE ICSID CONVENTION

Finally, Claimant submits that its dispute with the Respondent constitutes a “legal
dispute arising directly out of an investment” within the meaning of Article 25 of the

ICSID Convention as such dispute concerns the existence of legal rights and

 

Such additionnal elements are as follows:

(i) _ the right to provide heating services in Rézekne for thirty years under the Long-Term Agreement
(REA 4 46; see also RFA { 32);

(ii) the assumption, and repayment, of the debts owed by Rézeknes Siltumtikli (RFA i 46; 41-43; Cl.

THE RESPONDENT’S OBJECTIONS TO JURISDICTION

(dd) JURISDICTION RATIONE PERSONAE

The Respondent has not specifically challenged the Claimant’s submissions on

jurisdiction ratione personae.

(2) THE PARTIES’ CONSENT TO ICSID ARBITRATION

In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections the Respondent submits its “preliminary
objections to jurisdiction”.°!' Further to the Claimant’s comment that such objections
were “probably issues of admissibility rather than jurisdiction”, the Respondent

replies that Article 41 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules covers both issues of

jurisdiction and admissibility.°!?

The Respondent’s “preliminary objections” are as follows.

(A) LACK OF A CONDITION PRECEDENT FOR THE SUBMISSION OF THE
REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION

The Respondent objects that the Claimant’s decision dated 1 December 2009°'

allegedly authorising the Request for Arbitration requires mediation to be started prior

to arbitration; such condition precedent is not met in the present case.°!*

The Respondent states that such a document has legal effects for potential

respondents; any ambiguities in such documents are to be interpreted and construed in

the interest of the party which did not draft the documents.°!>

(i) Lack of Consent by the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development
The Respondent objects that all actions required in order for the Request for
Arbitration to be filed were not completed since the Claimant’s internal document
dated 1 December 2009°'° allegedly authorising the Request for Arbitration required

approval by the EBRD as a shareholder; such approval is not in evidence.°!”

(3) JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE

(A) — LACK OF A DISPUTE WITHIN THE MEANING OF ARTICLE 25 OF THE
ICSID CONVENTION
The Respondent submits that there is a lack of a dispute within the meaning of Article
25 of the ICSID Convention relying on the international law principles of
acquiescence, extinctive prescription and estoppel, as well as the Claimant’s bad

faith.°!8

The Respondent contends that the pursuit of an international investment claim is
barred if there is undue delay or if a potential claimant by its clear conduct induced a
potential respondent to rely on the fact that a potential claim would no longer be

pursued; reliance is placed on a number of awards on the principles of acquiescence,

estoppel and prescriptive extinction®!”.°°

The Respondent argues that by its voluntary and unconditional conduct the Claimant
caused the Republic of Latvia to rely on the fact that the investment claims would not

be pursued beyond negotiations since:

@ 42 months lapsed after the expiry of a time limit after which a claim may be

brought to ICSID under Article 7(2) of the BIT;®!

(ii) the Claimant did not send the Respondent any communication after
negotiations had been conducted from 1 September 2008 to 14 June 2010, the
date of the latest letter by the State Chancellery of Latvia calling on the
Claimant to proceed with the negotiation in case the Claimant deemed that any

of its rights had been breached; and

(iii) there had been isolated communications on 21, 24 and 28 March 2011 and
1 April 2011, in which the Government of Latvia expressly stated that such
communications would be made outside the investment protection treaty and
that the Government regarded the Claimant’s claims as time barred; the
Claimant confirmed its participation in the 1 April 2011 meeting, but no

further communication followed;°”

According to the Respondent, the submission of the Claimant’s Request for
Arbitration 42 months after a period authorised in the BIT, 25 months after the
Claimant did not respond to the Respondent’s express request to proceed with the
negotiation process and 17 months after the Claimant agreed to participate in a
meeting held outside the investment protection treaty shows the Claimant’s bad

faith.°°3

The Respondent objects that there is a “reasonable doubt” that the Claimant brought
this arbitration in good faith to influence the Lithuanian authorities or show that
certain legal remedies lie in case of an expropriation of the Claimant’s assets in light
of the fact that two municipalities in Lithuania, Prieny and Ukmerge, terminated their
cooperation with the Claimant in connection with district heating services to be

provided by the Claimant relying on the Claimant’s improper conduct and a “series of

events” which took place between 2010 and 2012; reliance was placed by the

Respondent on Exhibits R-11 to R-14.°%

(B) LACK OFA DISPUTE CONCERNING INVESTMENT WITHIN THE MEANING
OF THE BIT
In its first letter to the ICSID Secretariat dated 27 August 2012 the Respondent takes
the view that the basis for the claims asserted by the Claimant in its Request for
Arbitration was not the alleged breach of a bilateral investment protection treaty, but

the alleged breach of a private contract.

This objection was elaborated upon by the Respondent in due course and the
Respondent argues in particular that the Claimant “loads the Tribunal with typical
commercial issues that, according to the Vivendi doctrine (...), are essentially

contractual claims outside the scope of international investment law”.°?>

THE CLAIMANT’S REPLY TO THE RESPONDENT’S “PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS” TO
JURISDICTION

(1) GENERAL COMMENTS ON THE RESPONDENT’S “PRELIMINARY OBJECTIONS”

The Claimant contends that the Respondent does not challenge (i) consent under the
BIT and the ICSID Convention, (ii) that the Claimant is an investor of Lithuania
under the BIT and a national of Lithuania for the purposes of the ICSID Convention,
(iii) that the Claimant has made an investment for the purposes of the BIT and the
ICSID Convention, and (iv) that there is a dispute within the meaning of the BIT and
the ICSID Convention.©°

Therefore, the Respondent does not, in the Claimant’s view, challenge “the Tribunal’s
standing to consider claims brought by E energija under the terms of the BIT and the
ICSID Convention”; Latvia rather argues that the Tribunal is precluded from

considering the claims which it otherwise has jurisdiction to entertain.°?? The

proceedings or the termination of the proceedings (Transcript, Day 1, 149/3-5).

Respondent’s objections go to the admissibility of such claims rather than the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction.°*

According to the Claimant, the Respondent has the burden of proving that its
objections prevent the Tribunal from considering the Claimant’s claims and the
threshold must be a high one; for example, see the interim award in Chevron v.

Ecuador®? 6°

(2) THE CLAIMANT’S REPLY TO THE RESPONDENT’S OBJECTION BASED ON THE
LACK OF INTERNAL AUTHORISATION
The Claimant submits (i) that the jurisdiction of this Tribunal is governed solely by
Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the requirements of which are met in the present
case, (ii) that Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention and ICSID Institution Rules
2(1)(f) and 2(2) do not deal with the jurisdiction of ICSID or the Tribunal and (iii)
that a failure to comply with Article 36(2) and Institution Rules 2(1)(f) and 2(2)
could, at the most, constitute only a procedural defect in the Request for Arbitration,

but not a bar to jurisdiction.*!
The Claimant’s argument may be summarised as follows:

@ the Request for Arbitration complies with ICSID Institution Rule 2 as it was
filed with the power of attorney appointing Salans LLP and Sorainen as the
counsel acting for the Claimant, signed by the Claimant’s CEO Mr. Strioga,°°?
which meets the requirements of Institution Rules 2(1)(f) and 2(2); that was

the only “necessary internal action” required;°

(ii) moreover, Mr. Strioga subsequently confirmed in his letter dated 3 October

20125* that “all necessary internal actions” had been taken “to authorise the

filing of the Request for Arbitration”, and that is in itself sufficient, since Mr.
Strioga has authority to act alone on behalf of the Claimant as recorded in the

Register of Legal Entities in Lithuania;°*

(iii) no board decision was required;°*° the minutes of the Claimant’s Board
meeting of 1 December 2009 attached to Mr. Strioga’s letter of 3 October
2012 were provided “by way of further support”,®*’ but they need not be
examined since they are irrelevant in order to decide whether the Claimant
authorised the filing of the Request for the purposes of Institution Rules

2(1)(f) and 2(2);638

(iv) in any event, the Claimant contends that the Respondent misreads the minutes

of the Claimant’s Board meeting of 1 December 2009 in two respects:°*

(dd) the Respondent relies on the minutes of the Claimant’s Board meeting
of 1 December 2009, in particular on the sentence “Decided: Apply to
international arbitrage in case Latvian Government rejects the
proposed UAB E energija scenario: SIA ‘Latgales Energija’ cash
should be released from the executor’s account then the case would be
brought to the mediation panel” and concludes that resort to mediation
was a condition precedent to the institution of arbitration proceedings;

and

the Respondent’s construction of that sentence is inaccurate; that
sentence indicates that the Claimant would apply to arbitration in case
Latvia rejected a certain proposal made by the Claimant; such proposal
contemplated a resort to mediation in case Latgales Energija’s funds,

which had been attached, had been released;° however, those funds

were not in fact released™! and the Board’s decision to commence

arbitration was, and remains, valid; and

the Respondent relies on the minutes of the Claimant’s Board meeting
of 1 December 2009? to object that arbitration could be commenced

only with the EBRD’s approval; and

the Respondent’s submission is without foundation as no Board
decision was required to bring this arbitration; in any event, the
reference to the EBRD is not contained in the part of the minutes that
sets out the decision, but in a “commentary”;“* the EBRD was in fact
approached by the Claimant “for support in relation to an arbitration”,
which it provided in the form of a letter to Latvia; Ms. Goransson,

THE CLAIMANT’S REPLY TO THE RESPONDENT’S OBJECTIONS BASED ON
ESTOPPEL, ACQUIESCENCE AND EXTINCTIVE PRESCRIPTION

483. The Claimant’s reply to the Respondent’s objections may be summarised as follows:

@

on estoppel: the Claimant disputes that it is estopped from asserting its claims;

reliance is placed on Pope & Talbot v. Canada with respect to the three

ingredients of estoppe!

1;°47 the Claimant replies (i) that the Respondent has

failed to show that the Claimant ever made any statement that it would not

pursue the claims set out in the Notice of Dispute,“ and (ii) that the

Respondent failed to show any reliance on its part on such alleged statement,

and any detriment suffered as a consequence of such alleged reliance; no issue

of estoppel can therefore arise;

on acquiescence: the Claimant submits that the doctrine of acquiescence has
two constituent elements, namely (i) inaction on behalf of a State or a failure
to assert a claim, (ii) such failure must have extended over a certain period of
time, and (iii) there must have been circumstances that would have required
action (reliance was placed by the Claimant on the commentary on The Law of
International Responsibility), the Claimant submits that cogent evidence of
a tacit intention to withdraw a claim must be required in a case, such as the

present case, in which the investor has submitted a Notice of Dispute;°*!

in the Claimant’s view, the Respondent has provided no evidence that the
circumstances required action on the part of the Claimant in the present case;
the BIT contains no time limits in order for claims to be brought and the

Claimant submitted a detailed Notice of Dispute; and

in particular, the Claimant argues that Latvia’s letter of 12 July 2010°*

answered the Claimant’s letter of 15 June 2010:°°> in its 15 June 2010 letter
the Claimant had informed the Respondent that it contemplated arbitration
proceedings since amicable negotiations had failed; the Respondent answered
proposing a meeting or a telephone conference; admittedly, the Respondent’s
letter was followed by a few months in which the negotiations between the
Parties halted; however, the circumstances at the time did not require action by
the Claimant and the Claimant was under no obligation to bring an arbitration
immediately, and the Respondent has failed to show that the duration of the

silence on the part of the Claimant was sufficient to amount to an

abandonment of the claims set out in the Notice of Dispute and that the
circumstances required action on the part of the Claimant;%°

on extinctive prescription: the Claimant acknowledges that prescriptive
extinction may apply even if a State has not acquiesced in the extinction of a
claim, but replies (i) that the BIT does not contain any time limits within
which a claim is to be brought, (ii) that there is no general agreement as to any
actual time limits in international law and (iii) that the mere lapse of time is
not sufficient to extinguish a claim; extinctive prescription has been applied
only where the lapse of time has put the respondent at a disadvantage (reliance
was placed by the Claimant on the commentary on The Law of International
Responsibility®’);°* the overall delay of less than 4 years between the Notice
of Dispute and the Request for Arbitration is not an unreasonable period such

as to bar a claim and the Respondent has suffered no prejudice;° and

on bad faith: the Claimant denies that it brought the present arbitration against
Latvia in bad faith to in order to influence the Lithuanian authorities in
relation to the termination of district heating concessions in two Lithuanian
municipalities and wonders how proceedings brought against one State could
possibly influence the authorities of another State. The Claimant further
points out that, on the one hand, the concession in Prieny had not been
terminated, and, on the other, the Ukmergé concession was terminated after
the local authorities attempted to negotiate an agreed termination with the

Claimant; those facts therefore bore no relation to the present dispute.*!

THE REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON JURISDICTION

Convention, whereas the Respondent raised the following “preliminary objections” to

the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which the Tribunal joined to the merits in Procedural

Order No. 3bis:

@ lack of the Claimant’s internal authorisation for instituting these proceedings

(“First Objection”); and

(ii) lack of “dispute” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention (“Second

Objection”).%

In this section of the present Award the Tribunal will examine (1) its jurisdiction
ratione personae, (2) the Parties’ consent to ICSID arbitration (including the
Respondent’s First Objection) and (3) its jurisdiction ratione materiae (including the

Respondent’s Second Objection).

2. The term “investor” means:
a) in respect of the Republic of Lithuania:
(i) natural persons who are nationals of the Republic of
Lithuania according to the laws of the Republic of
Lithuania;
(ii) any entity constituted under the laws of the Republic

of Lithuania and registered in the territory of the
Republic of Lithuania in conformity with its laws and

The Claimant is a limited liability company incorporated in Lithuania and having its

registered office in Vilnius, Lithuania. The Claimant is therefore an “investor” of

Lithuania within the meaning of Article 1(2)(ii) of the BIT.
Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides:

As a limited liability company incorporated in Lithuania and having its registered
office in Lithuania on the date the Request was submitted to ICSID, the Claimant is
also a “juridical person which had the nationality of a Contracting State other than the
State party to the dispute on the date on which the parties consented to submit such
dispute to conciliation or arbitration” within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of the

ICSID Convention.

The Respondent has not challenged these points.

The Tribunal therefore finds that there is no lack of jurisdiction ratione personae

under the BIT and the ICSID Convention.

(2) THE PARTIES’ CONSENT TO ICSID JURISDICTION

The Tribunal will determine whether (i) the Parties consented to ICSID jurisdiction
under Article 7 of the BIT and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention and (ii) whether
the alleged lack of compliance by the Claimant with its internal requirements to
initiate these proceedings has any effects on the Claimant’s consent to ICSID

jurisdiction.

Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:

Chapter II
Jurisdiction of the Centre

Article 25

a)

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any

ivision or agency of a C ing State d dto
the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the
Centre. When the parties have given their consent, no party may
withdraw its consent unilaterally.

Article 7 of the BIT reads as follows:

Article 7

Disputes between One Contracting Party and an Investor of the Other

Contracting Party

Notice of a dispute concerning investment between one of the Parties
and an investor of the other Party shall be given in writing. This shall
include a detailed statement by the investor to the Contracting Party in
whose territory the investment was made. The Parties shall, if possible,
endeavour to settle their differences by means of a friendly agreement.

If such dispute cannot be settled amicably within six months from the
date of the written notification provided in paragraph 1, the dispute, at
the request of either party and at the choice of the investor, shall be
submitted to:

-  anad hoc court of arbitration, for arbitration in accordance with the
Arbitration Rules issued in 1976 by the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL); or to

    

- the International Center for the Settlement of Investment Dispute
(ICSID) established under the 1965 Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other
States, for arbitration under ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings if both of the Contracting Parties have
acceded to the Convention.

the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (New
York Convention), if the Contracting Parties are members of that
Convention. The arbitration shall take place in a State that is a party to

the New York Convention.

 

 

(footnotes omitted)
(A) | THE PARTIES’ CONSENT TO ICSID JURISDICTION

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent offered to submit certain disputes to ICSID
arbitration under Article 7 of the BIT provided (i) that the investor gave the host State
a notice of dispute in writing including a detailed statement (Article 7(1) of the BIT),
and (ii) that the Parties endeavoured to settle their dispute amicably in the six months

following the notification of the notice of dispute (Article 7(2) of the BIT).
The Respondent did not dispute that these requirements were met.

The Tribunal concludes that the two requirements in Article 7(1) and 7(2) of the BIT
were met in the present case. First, the Claimant delivered its Notice of Dispute on
2 September 2008 to the Respondent, thereby complying with Article 7(1) of the BIT.
Secondly, the Respondent accepts that negotiations with the Claimant started on 1
September 20089”? and continued until 14 July 2010 with a final meeting on 1 April
2011 without any settlement being reached.*"! The Parties therefore tried to settle
their dispute amicably for more than six months before the Claimant submitted the

dispute to ICSID, as required by Article 7(2) of the BIT.

The Tribunal also finds that the Claimant accepted the Respondent’s offer contained
in the BIT to settle the dispute by ICSID arbitration by filing its Request for
Arbitration on 15 August 2012. The Tribunal therefore concludes that the
requirement of consent under Article 7(2) of the BIT was met, as was the requirement

of “consent in writing” under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

This conclusion, however, is subject to the determination by the Tribunal of the

Respondent’s First Objection that the Claimant’s internal documents authorising the

request show an alleged lack of compliance with a condition precedent (i.e.
mediation) and a failure to obtain the required EBRD approval before instituting these

proceedings.

(B) | THE RESPONDENT’S FIRST OBJECTION — LACK OF INTERNAL
AUTHORISATION TO INITIATE THESE PROCEEDINGS

As part of the Secretary-General’s screening process, the ICSID Secretariat requested
the Claimant’s confirmation that it had “taken all necessary internal actions to
authorise the request” pursuant to ICSID Institution Rule 2(1)(f). In a letter dated 3
October 2012 the Claimant confirmed that “UAB ‘E energija’ has taken all necessary
internal actions to authorise the filing of the Request” and attached UAB’s Board

Meeting Minutes dated 1 December 2009.°”

The Respondent’s First Objection is based on these Board Minutes. According to the
Respondent, such Minutes demonstrate a “[I]ack of compliance with Article 36(2) of
the ICSID Convention [and] ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of
Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings, Rule 2(1)(f) and Rule 2(2)”.° No other
authorities aside from these provisions are relied upon by the Respondent in support

of this preliminary objection.

In the Tribunal’s view, whether the authorising documents provided by the Claimant
in the present case were such as to warrant the registration of the request is a matter

for the ICSID Secretary-General.

Article 36(2) of the ICSID Convention (and Institution Rule 2) deal with the
registration procedure, not with the jurisdiction of a tribunal constituted under the
ICSID Convention. Jurisdiction is dealt with in Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.
Insofar as the Respondent’s “preliminary objection” is based on Article 36(2) of the

ICSID Convention and Institution Rule 2, such objection must therefore fail.

As the Claimant argues that it consented to ICSID arbitration by filing the Request, a
lack of authorisation to file the Request, if established, could operate so as to taint the

Claimant’s consent in the Tribunal’s view. The Tribunal will therefore examine the

Respondent’s contention that the Board Minutes contain conditions precedent to the

initiation of arbitration that were not met, which vitiated the Claimant’s consent.

674

The passage of the Claimant’s Board Minutes®”* relied upon by the Respondent reads

as follows:

5. Discussed. Decision to apply with SIA “Latgales energija” case to
arbitrage.

Decided: Apply to international arbitrage in case Latvian Government rejects
the proposed UAB E energija scenario: SIA “Latgales energija” cash should be

released from the executor’s account then the case would be brought to the
mediation panel.

Commentary. UAB E energija will issue letter to the Latvian government
regarding the decision of the board. E energija will also apply to EBRD
regarding approval of the decision to apply to international arbitrage.

(i) Board Minutes — The Reference to Mediation

Based on the wording of the Board Minutes, the Tribunal finds that this resolution by
the Claimant’s Board, made on 1 December 2009, is a decision to apply to
international arbitration in case the Government of Latvia rejected a proposal made by

the Claimant in order that the Claimant’s funds be released.

In its submissions, the Claimant explained the meaning of the sentence set out above
after “Decided” (see paragraph 482 above), and the Respondent did not specifically

challenge that explanation.°”°

Having considered the Parties’ position in this respect, the Tribunal determines that in
order for mediation to take place, the Government of Latvia would have had to accept
the proposal made by the Claimant, on any plain reading of the resolution set out in

paragraph 508 above.

674 C-247, attached to the Claimant’s 3 October 2012 letter to Mr. Burn (original emphasis).

75 The Respondent accepts that it was the Party that proposed mediation (Transcript, Day 1, 147/15-16).
The Respondent offered mediation on 27 October 2009 (see paragraph 425 above) after the Claimant had
indicated on 23 September 2009 that it would “move the dispute to international arbitration” (see
paragraph 423 above). The Claimant rejected the Respondent’s mediation proposal on 6 November 2009
(see paragraph 426 above), whereupon the Respondent made a further attempt at proposing mediation on
25 November 2009 (see paragraph 426 above). When the Claimant’s Board made its resolution on
1 December 2009, the Respondent’s mediation proposal dated 25 November 2009 (C-236) had been
neither accepted nor rejected by the Claimant. The Respondent’s mediation proposal was rejected by the
Claimant on 8 February 2010.

513.

514.

The Tribunal concludes that the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of
proof with respect to the allegation that mediation was a condition precedent to

arbitration.°”°

(ii) Board Minutes — The Reference to EBRD Approval

The Respondent further contends that approval by the EBRD was a condition
precedent to the Claimant commencing arbitration, which the Claimant denies. The
passage relied upon by the Respondent in the Claimant’s Board Minutes dated 1

December 2009 is reproduced in paragraph 508 above.

In the Tribunal’s view, the operative part of the Claimant’s Board Minutes of 1
December 2009 is set out after the word “Decided”. The two sentences set out after
the word “Commentary” appear to indicate what the Board would do, the decision to

go to arbitration having been adopted.

If approval by the EBRD had been a condition precedent to the institution of these
arbitration proceedings pursuant to arrangements made by the EBRD, the reference to

the EBRD would likely not have been inserted under the “Commentary” section.

In the Tribunal’s opinion, the Claimant’s Board Minutes of 1 December 2009 are
insufficient to prove that the EBRD’s approval was a condition precedent to
arbitration, and the Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof in this
respect. The Respondent’s “preliminary objection” based on the EBRD’s lack of

approval must therefore be dismissed.

As a general note, the Tribunal finds that general denials (such as that contained in the

Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Preliminary Objections®”’) are

  

insufficient and must fail.

61 See e.g. Chevron v. Ecuador, CLA-44 fff 138-139.

67 Such general denial inserted at Resp. Rej. § 40 reads as follows: “As a final general comment, if
Respondent has not commented expressly on a certain Claimant’s position in any of previous Claimant’s
pleadings, it does not mean that Respondent agrees with such statements or allegations of fact or law.
Respondent has attempted to position its viewpoint clearly without duplicate or tedious reiterations or
denials. Respondent reserves its right to supplement its position in due time (including, invoking
additional evidence or witnesses)”.

 

137

518.

519.

The Tribunal therefore finds that (i) the Respondent has failed to discharge its
burden of proof in relation to any alleged conditions to the Claimant’s consent and
the First Objection is therefore dismissed, and that (ii) the Parties consented to
ICSID arbitration, the Claimant met the notice and amicable settlement requirements
in Article 7 of the BIT and there was therefore valid written consent for the purposes

of Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.

(3) JURISDICTION RATIONE MATERIAE

In this section the Tribunal will deal with the Respondent’s Second Objection and
determine whether it has jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT and the ICSID
Convention. Specifically, the Tribunal will decide (i) whether there is a “dispute
concerning an investment” under Articles 1(1) and 7(1) of the BIT; (ii) whether there
is a “legal dispute arising directly out of an investment” according to Article 25(1) of
the ICSID Convention or (iii) whether there is no “dispute” under Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention having regard to the principles of estoppel, acquiescence,

extinctive prescription and good faith (Second Objection).

(A) ARTICLES 1(1) AND 7(1) OF THE BIT — A “DISPUTE CONCERNING
INVESTMENT”

Article 1(1) of the BIT reads as follows:

Article 1
Definitions
For the purposes of this Agreement:
Ll. The term “investment” shall mean every kind of asset, invested by an

investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party, provided that the investment has been made in
accordance with the laws and regulations of the other Contracting
Party, and shall include in particular, though not exclusively:

a) movable and immovable property as well as any other
property rights, such as mortgages, liens and pledges, and
similar rights;

b) shares, bonds and other kinds of interest in companies;

c) claims to money which has been used to create an economic
value or claims to any performance having an economic value;

d) copyrights, industrial property rights (such as patents, trade
marks, industrial designs and models, trade names), know-
how and good-will;

138

520.

521.

e) any right to conduct economic activities conferred by state
authorities, including concessions to search for, extract and
exploit natural resources.

(.)
It is undisputed that the Claimant made an investment in the territory of Latvia in
accordance with the local laws and regulations. The Respondent called no fact
witnesses to challenge Mr. Jautakis’ first Witness Statement, which contains detailed
explanation as to the various transactions forming part of the Claimant’s investment,
and Mr. Jautakis was not cross-examined at the Hearing.°’* The Respondent also
expressly acknowledged the existence of an investor and an investment as part of its

argument advanced that the Energy Charter Treaty should apply.°”

Specifically, after reviewing the documentary evidence, the Tribunal concludes as

follows:

(60) the shares and statutory capital in Latgales Energija constitute an investment

under Article 1(1)(b) of the BIT;

(ii) the loans provided by the Claimant to Latgales Energija to fund Latgales
Energija’s operations in Rézekne; the guarantee provided in relation to the
loans granted by Latvijas Unibanka to the Rézekne Municipality and the
guarantee provided in relation to a loan granted by Sampo Banka to Latgales

Energija constitute an investment under Article 1(1)(c) of the BIT;%*° and

(iii) the know-how and expertise in heating services®*! as well as the operational
management expertise®” provided by the Claimant constitute an investment

under Article 1(1)(d) of the BIT.

Latgales Energija is not an investor for the purposes of Article 1(1) and 1(2) of the
BIT and is also not a “national of another Contracting State” within the meaning of

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention as there is no agreement between the Parties that

it should be treated as the investor. As such, Latgales Energija’s assets are not,
therefore, “the investment”; it does not follow, however, that they are irrelevant, since
for example the value of the shares in Latgales Energija depends on the value of such
assets that include inter alia the right to operate the heating system in the city of

Rézekne under the Long-Term Agreement and the three licences.

Moreover, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s invocation of various BIT breaches
meets the condition of a “dispute concerning investment” under Article 7(1) of the

BIT.

The Tribunal emphasizes again that general denials, such as those contained in the
Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply on Preliminary Objections, are

insufficient in the Tribunal’s view.
The Tribunal therefore finds that it has jurisdiction ratione materiae under the BIT.

(B) — ARTICLE 25(1) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION — “A LEGAL DISPUTE
ARISING DIRECTLY OUT OF AN INVESTMENT”
The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has not challenged the Claimant’s submission
that its investment qualifies as an investment under Article 25(1) of the ICSID
Convention (quoted in paragraph 497 above) as understood by analysing the features

discussed in Prof. Schreuer’s commentary.°**

Nor has the Respondent denied the
relevance of those features. Moreover, the Respondent has itself contended that there
is an investment in the present case, albeit with reference to the Energy Charter Treaty

as the Tribunal has just recalled in paragraph 520 above.

After examining the features of an investment discussed in Prof. Schreuer’s
commentary, with the understanding that they are not meant to be taken as a list of

jurisdictional requirements, the Tribunal concludes that they are met in this case.

In particular, the Tribunal finds there was a long-term investment as, among other

factors, the Long-Term Agreement was entered into for a period of thirty years,®*° and

the February 2005 Agreement was entered into for the same period as the Long-Term
Agreement.°*° Moreover, the Claimant alleges to have made a significant monetary
investment that includes LVL 3.4 million and EUR 2.821 million investments in 2005
and 2006,°’ which the Tribunal deems to be a substantial monetary commitment.
The Tribunal further finds that the investment was not devoid of risk, a circumstance
on which the Respondent has expressly relied by contending that the Claimant failed
to conduct a proper risk assessment prior to its decision to invest.°** Finally, the
Tribunal concludes that the project was significant for the development of the
Republic of Latvia due to the importance of district heating and the supply of hot
water as a critical public service, and to the need to switch from expensive and

polluting fuels to natural gas, as acknowledged by the Respondent.

It is plain from all the above that the Claimant made an investment in Latvia for the

purposes of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

As the Claimant has alleged various breaches of the BIT in relation to Latvia’s
treatment of its investment, the Tribunal finds that there is a “legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment” as required by Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention,

subject to the Tribunal’s decision on the Respondent’s Second Objection.

(C) | THE RESPONDENT’S SECOND OBJECTION — LACK OF A “DISPUTE” UNDER
ARTICLE 25(1) OF THE ICSID CONVENTION

The Tribunal will now consider the Respondent’s challenge that there is no dispute

under Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention due to estoppel, acquiescence,

prescriptive extinction and due to the Claimant’s alleged bad faith.

(i) Estoppel
Both Parties have relied on the Pope & Talbot interim award.’ According to this
decision, estoppel requires three elements: (i) “a statement of fact which is clear and

unambiguous”; (ii) a statement that “must be voluntary, unconditional and

authorised”; and (iii) that “there must be reliance in good faith upon the statement
either to the detriment of the party so relying on the statement or to the advantage of

the party making the statement”.

The Tribunal has reviewed the Parties’ correspondence relating to their negotiations
subsequent to the Notice of Dispute.®! The Respondent relies on the Claimant’s
alleged “voluntary and unconditional conduct” which is said to be “of such a nature as
to cause a reasonable reliance in Latvia that the investment claims, as outlined in the
Request, will not be pursued beyond negotiations (...)”.©? However, no relevant
conduct or statement by the Claimant has been shown to exist. To the contrary, the
communication sent by the Claimant to the Respondent immediately prior to the
Parties’ last meeting to discuss settlement opportunities expressly mentioned the
>> 693

“potential international arbitration’ Reliance on a mere lapse of time is

insufficient to give rise to a preclusion based on estoppel.

The Respondent has failed to discharge its burden of proof with respect to the first
factual requirement of an estoppel defence. The Respondent has also failed to show
its reliance on the Claimant’s alleged conduct or statement that the investment claims
would not be pursued beyond negotiations. The Tribunal therefore finds that no issue

of estoppel arises on the facts of this case.

(ii) Acquiescence
The Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not shown that the time which lapsed
after the Claimant sent the Respondent its Notice of Dispute is such that the Claimant

must be deemed to have accepted by conduct that its claims were extinguished.

Neither Article 7 nor any other provisions of the BIT contains a time limit by which a
claimant must bring arbitration proceedings. It was therefore entirely a matter for the

Claimant to decide when to bring arbitration proceedings.

The fact that the Claimant took part in the 1 April 2011 meeting after receipt of the
Respondent’s email dated 24 March 2011 stating that the meeting would not be held
“under the auspices of the Latvian-Lithuanian investment protection treaty” on the
basis that the Government of Latvia regarded “the investment dispute as closed” does
not give rise to acquiescence, not least since such communication was preceded by a
communication by the Claimant indicating that the objective of the meeting would be
“to further discuss the Rézekne case and potential international arbitration”.°*
Moreover, the Claimant did not express any agreement to the proposition that the
investment dispute was “closed”. The Respondent’s objection based on acquiescence

must therefore be dismissed in such circumstances.

(iii) Extinctive Prescription
The Respondent’s objections based on prescriptive extinction are rested on the same

bases as the Respondent’s estoppel and acquiescence objections.

The Respondent did not rebut the Claimant’s reply that the BIT contained no time
limits (see paragraph 483 above). Similarly, the Respondent did not rebut the
Claimant’s contention that prescriptive extinction had been applied in cases in which
the respondent had been put at a disadvantage by the lapse of time and that the

Respondent had shown no disadvantage in the present case.

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the absence of a time limit in the BIT is
dispositive in the present case and that the lapse of less than four years from the date
when the Notice of Dispute dated 1 September 2008 was sent to the Respondent to the
date of the Request for Arbitration dated 15 August 2012 is insufficient to attract the

application of the doctrine of prescriptive extinction.

The Respondent’s objection based on prescriptive extinction must therefore be

dismissed.

(iv) | Bad Faith — Reasonable Doubt as to a Lack of Good Faith

The burden of proof in relation to allegations of bad faith on the part of the Claimant
is squarely on the Respondent.®> The Tribunal takes the view that the standard of
proof should be appropriately high considering, first, that as a general matter bona
fide conduct must be presumed in principle;°° secondly, that the Respondent’s
allegations include matters and parties which are not before this Tribunal; and, thirdly,
that such allegations are based mostly on news reports. The Respondent appears to
acknowledge the difficulty in discharging its burden of proof as it stops short of

making an allegation of bad faith and states that there is “reasonable doubt” that the

Claimant acted in good faith.

The Tribunal has considered the documentary evidence relating to the events in

Prieny and Ukmergé initially filed by the Respondent (Exhibits R-11 to R-14).

Exhibit R-11, dated 5 October 2010, is another similar printout stating that the
Regulator suspended the licence of Miesto energija pending the state of emergency
and that the contract with Miesto energija was terminated by the Municipality due to

high prices.

Exhibit R-12, dated 4 November 2010, is the printout from a news portal quoting
another news service, Lietuvos rytas. As a consequence of the Claimant’s decision to
raise heating prices again, the Prieny authorities reportedly decided to take over
district heating, following the example of Ukmergé. The report does not exclude a
political motivation for the decision in both cities, since entrepreneurs are quoted in
Exhibit R-12 as saying that “the politicians of Ukmergé and Prieny are simply

preparing for municipal elections”.

Exhibit R-13, dated 12 January 2012, is also a printout from a news portal quoting
Lietuvos rytas. One concrete element in this report about Prieny relates to the
negotiations that were underway between the local authorities and the operator. This
exhibit also mentions the city of Ukmergé, reportedly the only one in Lithuania to

have taken over heating completely from the private operator in charge.

Exhibit R-14, dated 17 October 2012, reports that E energija will seek compensation
in an amount of 15 million litas before the courts against the Ukmergé municipality;

the present arbitration proceedings are recalled in the closing paragraph.

The Tribunal further considered the documentary evidence subsequently filed by the
Respondent (namely Exhibit R-19) attached to its Rejoinder on the Merits and Reply
on Preliminary Objections. The Tribunal takes the view that the filing by a party of
an exhibit containing one hundred odd pages attached to a submission in which the

exhibit is not discussed in any detail is of very little assistance to it.

In fact, Exhibit R-19 is mentioned only once in the whole submission®™” in support of
one allegation relating to what could be briefly described as Mr. Strioga’s reckless

way of doing business in the eyes of the Respondent.

The Tribunal has taken the various press reports”

contained in Exhibit R-19 into
consideration, some of which were briefly referred to by counsel for the Respondent
in its opening argument.®”? However, the Tribunal will not embark, unassisted by
counsel on both sides, on an analysis of the Lithuanian decisions in Exhibit R-19,

none of which were referred to in the pleadings.

The Tribunal is driven to the conclusion that the Respondent has not discharged its
burden of proof in relation to the allegation that the Claimant brought these arbitration
proceedings to influence the authorities in Lithuania. The Respondent’s objection
based on the Claimant’s alleged bad faith, or the reasonable doubt that the Claimant

may not have acted in good faith, must therefore be dismissed.

As far as concerns the Respondent’s allegation that it is the Claimant’s and
Mr. Strioga’s common practice to enter into deals without defining clear rules of
cooperation, the Tribunal considers that the Respondent has not discharged its burden
of proof by filing documents relating to the Claimant’s contractual arrangements with

certain Lithuanian municipalities and the difficulties which arose out of such

contracts. Moreover, the Claimant’s alleged common practice has not been shown to

be relevant to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

Therefore, the Tribunal concludes that Respondent’s objection based on an absence of

good faith must be dismissed.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON JURISDICTION

The Tribunal has jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims under Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention and Article 7 of the BIT. The Respondent’s “preliminary

objections” are dismissed.

THE RESPONDENT’S APPLICATION FOR TERMINATION, AND,
ALTERNATIVELY, FOR A STAY OF THE PROCEEDINGS

The Respondent’s application to have these arbitration proceedings stayed was first
filed on 18 April 2014 as part of the Memorial setting out the Respondent’s objection

to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction (see paragraph 450 above).

THE PARTIES’ PRAYERS FOR RELIEF ON THE STAY OF PROCEEDINGS

(dd) THE RESPONDENT

In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation, and Counter-

Memorial on the Merits the Respondent seeks the following relief:

Considering the above mentioned factual and legal description of the situation,
the Respondent kindly requests the Tribunal to:

1 (.)
or

2) declare that, in accordance with Article 41(6) of the ICSID Arbitration

Rules, this arbitration proceeding is to be suspended pending the final

and binding adjudication in Latvian courts of the local judicial civil

proceeding No. C03051107;

In its Skeleton Argument the Respondent requests the Tribunal “under the Tribunal’s

discretionary competence, to suspend or terminate the proceedings on grounds

enumerated in Respondent’s pleadings”. 7°!

(2) THE CLAIMANT

In its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections the

Claimant requests the following relief: °?

The Claimant therefore respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:

(a) deny the requests for relief set out by the Respondent in section 5 of the
Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Preliminary Objections on
Jurisdiction;

(b) Gd

In its Rejoinder on Preliminary Objections the Claimant restates substantially the

same relief. 7

THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent rested its original application for a stay on the 7 April 2014 judgment
by the Supreme Court of Latvia, allowing Latgales Energija’s application for review
against a judgment dated 20 April 2012 and remitting the case to a new court of
appeal for a fresh decision.” The Respondent argues that the Tribunal should
“follow the Vivendi doctrine and allow adjudication of the underlying civil dispute by
Latvian courts ...”.”°° The Respondent contends that Latgales Energija’s conduct
should be attributed to the Claimant and regarded as an acknowledgment by the
Claimant of the fact that the Latvian courts were properly dealing with the matter
pending these arbitration proceedings; the Claimant’s attempt at forum shopping
trivialized both these proceedings and the Latvian proceedings in which Latgales
Energija had actively and selectively sought procedural remedies. The Respondent

suggests that the Tribunal could only gain from allowing the Latvian courts to hear all

factual and legal issues, which were numerous and technical, in relation to the
termination of the Long-Term Agreement (referred to as the “Concession Agreement”
by the Respondent); reliance is placed by the Respondent on Impregilo v.

Argentina™®.1°7

In its Clarificatory Statement on Bifurcation the Respondent goes a step further,
arguing that the Claimant has pursued the same issues in the Latvian courts and these

arbitration proceedings.”°°

In its Skeleton Argument the Respondent also seeks a termination of the proceedings
on procedural grounds, submitting that the Tribunal had discretion to decide whether

to stay the proceedings or terminate them on procedural grounds.’

THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

The Claimant’s position may be summarised as follows:

@ the Latvian proceedings relied upon by the Respondent in support of its
application for a stay of proceedings were brought by the Municipality
through Rézeknes Siltumtikli against Latgales Energija in September 2007;
the argument that these arbitration proceedings should be stayed pending
proceedings brought by Latvia itself against the Claimant’s investment in
Latvia cannot be sustained and the accusation that Latgales Energija has in bad
faith engaged in forum shopping to the detriment of the Respondent is
similarly without foundation;’!° the Respondent appears to suggest that
Latgales Energija should not defend itself against Latvian proceedings lest this
get in the way of the Claimant’s claims under the BIT, which is a flawed

argument;”!! and

(ii)

in any event, Latgales Energija’s defences in the Latvian proceedings relied
upon by the Respondent and the Claimant’s claims in these arbitration
proceedings are entirely different since the claims presently under
consideration arise out of the BIT; the outcome of the Latvian proceedings is
irrelevant to the Tribunal’s mission since the value of the Claimant’s
investment in Latvia has already been irreparably destroyed; a Latvian
decision on whether the Long-Term Agreement was properly terminated could
make no difference to such value and could not determine whether Latvia is in
breach of any of its obligations under the BIT, and the issues of lease
payments and gas debt are not part of the Claimant’s case in these arbitration

proceedings;’!? the Respondent’s reliance on the distinction made in

713

Impregilo between legitimate expectations and contractual rights is

unclear;’'* the Claimant is not a party to the Latvian proceedings, it is not a
party to the contracts forming the basis of those proceedings and the
Claimant’s claims in these arbitration proceedings are not claims for breach of
contract so that there is no reason for the Tribunal to stay these proceedings as

a consequence of the Latvian proceedings.’!°

THE REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON THE RESPONDENT’S
APPLICATION FOR A STAY AND TERMINATION OF THE PROCEEDINGS

The Respondent’s application was denied by the Tribunal in Procedural Order

No. 3bis dated 21 January 2015 (see paragraph 23 above).

The Respondent made a fresh application to have these proceedings stayed or

terminated on procedural grounds in its Skeleton Argument dated 9 February 2015

referring to the “grounds enumerated in the Respondent’s pleadings” (see paragraph

452 above).

The point was then argued at the Hearing by both Parties.’!°

S71.

572.

In the Tribunal’s view the Respondent’s application for a stay is without foundation,

as the Tribunal has already found in Procedural Order No. 3bis.

First, the parties to the Latvian proceedings and the parties to these arbitration
proceedings are not the same. The Latvian proceedings relied upon by the
Respondent in support of its application for a stay were brought by Rézeknes

Siltumtikli against Latgales Energija (see paragraphs 302 ff. above).

Secondly, the issues arising in these proceedings are not the same as those arising in
the Latvian proceedings. The proceedings relied upon by the Respondent in support
of its application for a stay were brought under the Long-Term Agreement. They do
not relate to the standards of protection under the BIT with which this Tribunal is
concerned; that much has been expressly admitted by the Respondent and such
admission contradicts the Respondent’s contention that the issues pending before the

Latvian proceedings and this Tribunal are the same.

Thirdly, the fact that there may be an overlap between contract claims and treaty

claims is not sufficient per se to warrant a stay of proceedings.

Fourth, this Tribunal has already observed in Procedural Order No. 3bis that the
Respondent’s complaint that the Claimant has been actively and selectively seeking
procedural remedies in the Latvian courts is without foundation, since the Latvian
proceedings relied upon by the Respondent were brought by Rézeknes Siltumtikli.
Other proceedings were subsequently brought by Rézeknes Energija against Latgales
Energija (see paragraphs 310 ff. above), and by Rézeknes Siltumtikli against Latgales
Energija and the Claimant (see paragraphs 371 ff. above).

There are therefore in the Tribunal’s opinion no sound and cogent reasons to stay

these arbitration proceedings.

As there are no reasons to stay these proceedings pending the outcome of the Latvian

proceedings, there are, a fortiori, no reasons to terminate these proceedings.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION THE RESPONDENT’S APPLICATION FOR TERMINATION,
AND, ALTERNATIVEY, A STAY OF THE PROCEEDINGS

Therefore, the Respondent’s application for termination, and, alternatively, for a stay
of proceedings must be denied.
LIABILITY

In this section, the Tribunal will restate the Parties’ prayers for relief on liability (A)
before summarizing the respective cases on liability submitted by the Claimant (B)
and the Respondent (C). The Tribunal will then state the reasons for its decision on

liability (D) before issuing its decision (E).

THE PARTIES’ PRAYERS FOR RELIEF ON LIABILITY

(wD THE CLAIMANT

In its Memorial, the Claimant requests the following relief:’!”

The Claimant therefore respectfully requests the Arbitral Tribunal to:

(a) declare that the Respondent has breached Articles 4(1), 3(1) and 3(2) of
the BIT,

) (.)

In its Reply on the Merits and Counter-Memorial on Preliminary Objections, the

Claimant requests substantially the same relief.

(2) THE RESPONDENT
In its Memorial on Preliminary Objections and Request for Bifurcation, and Counter-

Memorial on the Merits the Respondent seeks the following relief:’!*

Considering the above mentioned factual and legal description of the situation,
the Respondent kindly requests the Tribunal to:

4) deny all Claimant’s requests for relief (as specified in the Claimant's
Memorial, paragraphs 370 and 371);

but, in any case,

5) (.)

The Respondent’s Rejoinder on the Merits does not set out a prayer for relief.

THE CLAIMANT’S CASE ON LIABILITY

The Claimant submits that Respondent has breached Articles 3(1), 3(2) and 4(1) of
the Lithuania-Latvia BIT.

Some of the Claimant’s claims under the BIT are contingent upon certain specific

issues that are in dispute between the parties.

The Tribunal will summarise the Claimant’s arguments relating to these issues (see

paragraphs 582 ff. below) and will then summarise the Claimant’s position regarding

Latvia’s liability under the Treaty in the following order:

@

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

attribution (i.e. whether the conduct of the Municipality, the Regulator,
Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija can be attributed to the

Respondent as a matter of international law, see paragraphs 621 ff. below);

expropriation (i.e. whether the Respondent is liable for unlawfully
expropriating the Claimant’s investment without compensation, see

paragraphs 648 ff. below);

fair and equitable treatment (i.e. whether the Respondent breached the

standard of fair and equitable treatment, see paragraphs 663 ff. below);

full protection and security (i.e. whether the Respondent breached the standard

of full protection and security, see paragraphs 691 ff. below);

arbitrary or discriminatory measures (i.e. whether the Respondent took
arbitrary and discriminatory measures against the Claimant, see paragraphs

694 ff. below); and

152

582.

583.

(vi)

dd)

breaches of the most favoured nation clause (i.e. whether the Respondent
breached an obligation on which the Claimant is entitled to rely by virtue of

the most favoured nation clause, see paragraphs 706 ff. below).

SPECIFIC ISSUES

The Tribunal will in turn summarise the Claimant’s position relating to the following

issues:

@

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

(vi)

(vii)

(viii)

(ix)

the application of the Principles of European Contract Law, UNIDROIT
Principles of International Commercial Contracts and TransLex Principles

advocated by the Respondent (see paragraphs 583 ff. below);

the functional and legal independence between the different parts of the

“concession arrangement” (see paragraphs 585 ff. below);

the duty to pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas Gaze (see paragraphs
586 ff. below);

the outstanding lease payments (see paragraphs 590 ff. below);
the risk allegedly assumed by the Claimant (see paragraph 593 below);

the influence allegedly brought to bear by the Municipality on the Regulator

(see paragraphs 594 ff. below);
the review of the tariffs by the Regulator (see paragraphs 599 ff. below);
the development plan (see paragraphs 607 ff. below);

the revocation of Latgales Energija’s licences to produce, transmit and sell

thermal energy (see paragraphs 617 ff. below).
(A) THE APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF EUROPEAN CONTRACT Law,

UNIDROIT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS
AND TRANSLEX PRINCIPLES

The Claimant argues that the Principles of European Contract Law (“PECL”) prayed

in aid by the Respondent are inapplicable to the present dispute as such Principles do

not constitute general principles of law recognized by civilized nations within the

153

584.

585.

586.

meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the Statute of the International Court of Justice.’!? The
Claimant submits that, in any event, such Principles could not excuse the
Respondent’s breaches of the BIT.” Moreover, the Long-Term Agreement is
expressly stated to be governed by Latvian law in its Clause 11 of the Long-Term
Agreement, which operates so as to exclude the application of the PECL to that

agreement.’?!

The Claimant does not specifically address the Respondent’s invocation of the
UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial Contracts and the TransLex

Principles.

(B) | THE FUNCTIONAL AND LEGAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE “CONCESSION ARRANGEMENT”
The Claimant criticises the distinction between private and public agreements relied
upon by the Respondent as being erroneous and misleading, since the organisation of
district heating is within the jurisdiction of the Municipality; reliance is placed on
Section 15 of the Municipalities Act.’? All contracts entered into by Latgales
Energija with the Municipality or its wholly-owned companies relating to the
provision of district heating “represent” the Municipality’s exercise of public powers

and cannot be considered “commercial contracts” as argued by the Respondent.’”*

(C) | THE DuTY TO PAY FOR THE NATURAL GAS SUPPLIED BY LATVIJAS
GAZE

The Claimant strenuously denies that Latgales Energija was bound to pay Latvijas
Gaze for the natural gas delivered, since Latgales Energija never entered into a direct
contractual relationship with Latvijas Gaze and did not assume the Municipality’s

obligation to pay Latvijas Gaze for natural gas deliveries under the Gas Supply

Agreement;’* reliance is placed on Clause 2.3 of the Long-Term Agreement,’

Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement’?® and the whereas clause of the Rézeknes

Energija Gas Supply Agreement”?’.”8

The Claimant asserts that the Municipality was, and remained, bound to pay Latvijas
Gaze for the natural gas despite the fact that Latgales Energija had paid for the
invoices issued by Latvijas Gaze to Rézeknes Siltumtitkli; reliance is placed on
Clauses 4.1 and 16.1 of the Gas Supply Agreement,’”? Clause 6 of Amendment No. 3
to the Gas Supply Agreement” and the interview with Mr. Vjakse published in
Rézeknes Véstis on 15 September 20077”*'.”? Latgales Energija paid the invoices
directly to Latvijas Gaze only in order to avoid any difficulties as might otherwise be
caused by Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s financial standing, not because it assumed any

liability towards Latvijas Gaze.’*?

Furthermore, the Claimant submits that the Long-Term Agreement did not constitute
a transfer of an undertaking (“Betriebsiibergang”’) as a matter of Latvian law, but
rather constituted a lease of certain assets which the Long-Term Agreement clearly
identified;”™ similarly, the Long-Term Agreement identified those debts of Rézeknes
Siltumtikli which Latgales Energija agreed to assume; all of which would not have
been necessary, by definition, if the Long-Term Agreement had been a transfer of an
undertaking.”** Only Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s employees were taken over by Latgales
Energija under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement; that amounted to a transfer of
an undertaking under the Labour Code (not in evidence) and not under the

736

Commercial Code. Finally, the Claimant submits that the concept of

Betriebsiibergang is not applicable in Latvia or to the transfer of contractual

obligations other than employment rights.”*”

The Claimant concludes that it was therefore the Municipality’s obligation to pay
Latvijas Gaze for the outstanding invoices when Latgales Energija was no longer in a
position to pay the full amount to Latvijas Gaze owing to the insufficient funds it

could charge and receive from its customers through the applicable tariffs.’**

(D) | THE OUTSTANDING LEASE PAYMENTS

The Claimant contends that Rézeknes Siltumtikli sued Latgales Energija under the
Long-Term Agreement on 20 September 2007 solely to obtain the attachment of
Latgales Energija’s bank accounts with a view to disrupting Latgales Energija’s

operation of the heating system.’*?

The Claimant asserts that, in monetary terms, the most significant part of Rézeknes
Siltumtikli’s claim was based on Latgales Energija’s alleged obligation to make
monthly payments for the depreciation of the leased assets under Clause 4.4.2 of the
Long-Term Agreement.”*° However, the depreciation was to be paid by investing in
the heating infrastructure “so that by the end of the lease term the book value of the
assets handed back was no less than the book value of the assets handed over at the
start, plus 5%”.”4!_ The Latvian courts eventually confirmed that Latgales Energija’s

position in this respect was correct as a matter of Latvian law.”

According to the Claimant, Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s claim is significant because of its
timing, as it was brought at a time when the gas supply had been suspended by
Latvijas Gaze one day before the Municipality approved the heat supply development

plan

(E) THE RISKS ALLEGEDLY ASSUMED BY THE CLAIMANT

The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contention that it assumed certain risks and it

contends that it could not have anticipated the “change in approach” on the part of the

Municipality and the Regulator.” Specifically, the Claimant submits that it did not

assume:

@

(vii)

the risk that the Municipality would fail to devise and approve a heat supply

development plan;

the risk that the Municipality would fail to comply with its own contractual
duties to Latvijas Gaze, thereby causing the suspension of the natural gas

supply;

the risk that the Municipality would actively seek to replace Latgales Energija
as the heat supply operator well before Latvijas Gaze suspended the supply of

natural gas;

the risk that the Municipality would declare an energy crisis relying on a

situation it had itself brought about;

the risk that the Municipality would prevent Latgales Energija from obtaining

increased tariffs despite the increase in the price of natural gas;

the risk that the Municipality would misrepresent the content of confidential
letters to the Regulator, that would in turn base its own allegations concerning
Latgales Energija’s breaches of the licence requirements on such

misrepresentations;

the risk that the Municipality would seek to persuade consumers not to pay

Latgales Energija’s invoices;

 

position is without prejudice to the Tribunal’s finding regarding the existence of different plans and the
respective duties attached thereto.

the risk that the Municipality (acting through Rézeknes Siltumtikli and
Rézeknes Energija) would seek to obtain an attachment of Latgales Energija’s

bank accounts;

the risk that the Regulator would change its practice, whereby it had granted

tariff increases despite the absence of a heat supply development plan; or

the risk that the Regulator would revoke Latgales Energija’s licences based on
a situation that was not only caused by the Municipality and the Regulator, but
that had been addressed and explained by Latgales Energija in its letters to the

Regulator.”

(F) THE INFLUENCE BROUGHT TO BEAR BY THE MUNICIPALITY ON THE
REGULATOR

It is the Claimant’s case that the Municipality brought influence to bear on the

Regulator “to follow its political wishes”.”4° The Claimant relies on the following

circumstances to show the Municipality’s influence over the Regulator:’*”

@

(ii)

the Regulator’s decision of 7 December 20077* revoking its previous decision

of 9 November 2007 approving new tariffs;”4? the 7 December 2007 decision

 

relied on a letter sent by Rézeknes Energija to the Regulator on 29 November
2007 (see paragraph 241 above) stating that Latgales Energija had used the
wrong amount of natural gas in its calculations submitted in support of its

proposal for a new tariff;

the Regulator’s letter to Latgales Energija dated 11 December 2007,’°° which
relied on a confidential letter sent by Latgales Energija to Rézeknes Siltumtikli

on 6 December 2007;7°! and

(iii) Rézeknes Siltumf?kli’s letter to the Regulator dated 15 May 20087 stating
that Latgales Energija had failed to meet its investment commitments; this
letter was sent before the Rézekne City Council sent another letter to Latgales
Energija on 20 May 20087°* which essentially made the same accusations and
before Latgales Energija responded to these accusations in a letter sent to the

Rézekne City Council on 2 June 2008.74

According to the Claimant, the Regulator’s disregard for the information and the
explanations provided by Latgales Energija is further proof of the Municipality’s

influence over the Regulator.’°°

The Claimant further refers to the Municipality’s power to appoint and dismiss the
members of the executive body of the Regulator as proof of the Municipality’s

influence over the Regulator.”°°

According to the Claimant, it was well-known in Latvia that local authorities
unlawfully influenced municipal regulators; reliance is placed on a report by the
“Society for Transparency” (Delna),”’ Ms. Uskane’s Witness Statement,’*
Mr. Strioga’s Witness Statement”? and the fact that the Latvian government abolished

local regulators in 2009.7

Finally, the Claimant submits that the Municipality through its actions created
situations in which the Regulator could adopt decisions that were technically legal,

but caused considerable damage to Latgale s Energija’s business.”°!

(G) THE REVIEW OF TARIFFS BY THE REGULATOR

The Claimant submits that Latgales Energija was entitled to request a review of the
heating tariffs provided that the cost of natural gas had increased by more than 5%;
reliance is placed on the 2001 Methodology’ and Clause 1.6 of the February 2005

Agreement’°?,7

In the Claimant’s view, Latgales Energija was therefore entitled to obtain new tariffs
in light of the applicable Methodology (i) after the Public Utilities Commission
decided on 22 March 2006 to increase the price of natural gas by 36 % from 1 May
2006 onwards and the price of electricity had increased by about 17 % (see paragraph
181 above), and (ii) after the Public Utilities Commission decided on 28 March 2007
further to increase the price of natural gas from 1 May 2007 (see paragraph 231

above).”°> However, the Regulator refused to grant new tariffs in both instances.

The Claimant rejects the grounds on which the Regulator refused to authorise new

tariffs in its decisions of 13 October 20067 and 11 June 2007.77

The Claimant states that (i) the missing list of employees, (ii) the missing VAT
calculation, and (iii) the missing key to the lease payment for fixed assets relied upon

by the Regulator to deny the proposed increase in tariff were minor issues that “could
have been easily rectified”.”°*

Concerning the operator’s plan on which the Regulator also rested its decisions to
decline the tariffs proposed by Latgales Energija, the Claimant submits that Latgales
Energija had submitted investment plans in its applications for a new tariff in 2005,
2006 and 2007; reliance is placed on attachment No. 26 to Latgales Energija’s letter

to the Regulator dated 28 September 20077”.7”° The Claimant states that Latgales

Energija had explained to the Regulator that it was not possible to devise a

“meaningful” operator’s plan in the absence of a heat supply development plan.””!

Regarding the coefficients which Latgales Energija admittedly failed to use in its
proposed calculation for new tariffs, the Claimant contends that such coefficients
were all dependent on the existence of a heat supply development plan which the
Municipality had a duty to devise and approve (see paragraphs 607 ff. below);
reliance is placed on the decision by the Administrative District Court of 15 April

2009772,773

The Claimant further submits that Latgales Energija was entitled to rely on the
Regulator’s practice, whereby a new tariff had been approved despite the absence of

+ reliance is further placed on the

an approved heat supply development plan;””
“principle of confidence in the legality of an institution’s actions”, Section | of the
Constitution of the Republic of Latvia and Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure

Act.775

It is the Claimant’s case that the Regulator’s willingness to approve new tariffs
despite the lack of a heat supply development plan, “thereby permitting the operator
to recover its costs properly”, was part of the investment regime which the Claimant

entered into.’”°

(H) — THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

It is the Claimant’s case that there are three different plans relevant for present

purposes:”””
@ the overall city development plan (the “city plan”);

(ii) the heat supply development plan; and

(iii) the heat supply operator’s development plan (the “operator’s plan”).

The Claimant contends that the Municipality breached (i) its legal obligation to devise
and approve the heat supply development plan already when the investment was made
and throughout the duration of the investment’’® and (ii) its obligations under the
February 2006 Agreement, by delaying to devise and approve the heat supply
development plan.’ The Municipality approved the heat supply development plan
only as late as 21 September 2007,”*° by which time Latgales Energija’s bank
accounts had been attached and the Municipality “had already decided to install a new

operator”.7*!

In the Claimant’s submission, the coefficients required by the Methodology to
calculate the heating tariffs are all derived from the heat supply development plan, not

the operator’s plan.’*
The Claimant submits that the Municipality had the following responsibilities:

@ sole responsibility to devise and approve the City Plan; reliance is placed on

Section 14(1) of the Municipalities Act;7*3 and

(ii) responsibility to devise and approve the heat supply development plan which
is “specified in light of the overall scope of municipal development outlined in
the City Plan”; reliance is placed on Section 15(1) of the Municipalities Act,
Section 51 of the Energy Act, Section 17 and Section 23(3) of the
Methodology in force at the relevant time as well as the decision of 15 April

2009 by the Administrative District Court (see paragraphs 392 ff. above).’*+

The Claimant admits that Latgales Energija “had a role to play” in the preparation of

the heat supply development plan as contemplated by Clause 1.2 of the February 2006

Agreement”*’.”8° However, the responsibility to “coordinate and approve” the heat

supply development plan remained with the Municipality.’*”

By contrast, Latgales Energija was responsible to devise only the operator’s plan, a
document that differed from the heat supply development plan; reliance is placed on
Clauses 1, 6.3 and 7.1 of the licences to produce, transmit and sell thermal energy’**

and Section 8 of the Energy Act.7*?

According to the Claimant, the Municipality was not entitled to delegate the
responsibility to devise and approve the heat supply development plan to Latgales
Energija in accordance with applicable law; reliance is placed on Section 41(2) of the
Public Administration Act;’° neither the licences”! nor the provisions of the Long-

Term Agreement’ operated so as to bring about such delegation.

In its rebuttal to one of the Respondent’s arguments, the Claimant denies that Latgales
Energija undertook or accepted the responsibility to devise the heat supply
development plan in its correspondence with the Municipality and Rézeknes
Siltumtikli.” According to the Claimant, the Guidelines for the development of the
Rézekne City heat supply system submitted to the Municipality on 20 January
2006,” the one-page heat supply development plan for the years 2006-2009” and
the draft heat supply development concept for the years 2006-20147" submitted to the
Municipality on 15 November 2006 were not draft heat supply development plans,
but rather documents intended to provide the Municipality with a basis to devise and

approve the heat supply development plan.’°”

The Municipality accepted such a position when it organised a working group in order

to devise and approve the heat supply development plan; reliance is placed on the
17798, 799

Municipality’s letter to Latgales Energija on 19 February 200
The Claimant contends that Latgales Energija, in its correspondence with the
Municipality, had repeatedly pointed out the Municipality’s obligation to devise and
approve the heat supply development plan, and even invoked the penalty clause in
Clause 5 of the February 2006 Agreement in case the Municipality failed to act;
reliance is placed on Latgales Energija’s letters sent to the Municipality on 10 May
2006,°° 19 October 2006,8" 2 February 2007,8°? 4 July 20078 and 18 July
2007804 805

The Claimant argues that in its letter to Latgales Energija of 27 October 2005%°

Rézeknes Siltumtikli misrepresented the Regulator’s letter to the Municipality of 12
October 2005*°”.8°8 The Regulator had asked the Municipality whether there was an
“effective and coordinated” heat supply development plan in place which contained
Latgales Energija’s “planned and already made investments”, not whether Latgales

Energija had “specified and coordinated” the heat supply development plan.”

(1) THE REVOCATION OF LATGALES ENERGIA’S LICENCES TO PRODUCE,
TRANSMIT AND SELL THERMAL ENERGY

The Claimant does not submit that the Regulator’s decision of 3 June 2008 (see

paragraph 337 above) revoking Latgales Energija’s licences to produce, transmit and

0

sell thermal energy was made in breach of Latvian law.*!° However, it is the

Claimant’s case that the Regulator was bound under Latvian law first to issue a
warning and grant Latgales Energija the opportunity to rectify a situation amounting

to a breach of the licences before revoking them.*!!

The Claimant further argues that the grounds on which the Regulator revoked the
licences were “illusory” or “just plain wrong”.®'? Latgales Energija had extensively
addressed all the issues raised by the Regulator in its correspondence with the
Regulator; however, the Regulator hardly took any of these explanations into account;
reliance is placed on the letter sent to the Regulator by Latgales Energija on 30

October 20078!3.8!4

According to the Claimant, the grounds on which the Regulator revoked Latgales
Energija’s licences were the same grounds on which the Regulator issued a warning

on 4 October 2007.85 In particular, the Claimant submits that:

@ Latgales Energija was unable to submit an operator’s plan and yearly reports

in the absence of the Municipality’s heat supply development plan;*!°

(ii) Latgales Energija’s failure to provide uninterrupted good-quality heating
services in September and October 2007 was due to (i) the Municipality’s
failure to pay Latvijas Gaze for the natural gas supplied, (ii) the Municipality’s
failure to adopt the heat supply development plan (which was necessary for
the approval of higher tariffs) and (iii) the attachment of Latgales Energija’s

bank accounts sought by Rézeknes Siltumtikli;3!”

(iii) — Latgales Energija’s assignment of claims to LE Remonts (see paragraph 298
above) was necessary to avoid money being paid into bank accounts that had

been attached and to continue the operation of the heating system;*!®

Latgales Energija’s challenge of the Regulator’s decision of 7 December
20078! revoking its previous decision of 9 November 2007 approving new
tariffs*?° prevented the Regulator’s decision of 7 December 2007 from coming
into force and thus the tariffs originally approved remained applicable;
reliance is placed on Section 185(1) of the Administrative Procedure Act;*?!

and

Latgales Energija was unable to invest more than EUR 1.2 million into the
heating infrastructure due to (i) the Municipality’s failure to adopt the heat
supply development plan and (ii) Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s refusal to approve the
installation of new equipment; reliance is placed on letters sent to the Rézekne

(A) — THE MUNICIPALITY
(i) The Principles
The Claimant contends that in order for an act to be attributable to a State under
international law, the act must have been carried out by an organ of such State;
reliance is placed on Article 4(1) of the 2001 ILC Articles on Responsibility of States

for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “ILC Articles”). °°

(ii) The Principles Applied
The Claimant submits that the Municipality of Rézekne (represented by and acting
through the Rézekne City Council) is a branch of local government and constitutes

© The Municipality was

part of the executive branch of the Republic of Latvia.**
representing the Republic of Latvia in its “administrative and regulatory activities”
and enjoyed certain autonomy while remaining under the supervision of the Cabinet

of Ministers of the Republic of Latvia.**!

The Claimant submits therefore that the Municipality is an organ of the Republic of
Latvia within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the ILC Articles and that the

Municipality’s conduct is attributable to the Respondent.**

(B) | THEREGULATOR
(i) The Principles

In addition to the principle contained in Article 4 of the ILC Articles (see paragraph
622 above), the Claimant argues that the Respondent was required to ensure that any
state enterprise that it maintains or establishes act in a manner that is not inconsistent
with the Claimant’s obligations under the BIT; reliance is placed on the MEN clause
contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT in connection with Article 2(2)(b) of the US-
Latvia BIT 83

(ii) The Principles Applied
First, the Claimant argues that the Regulator was the body of competent jurisdiction in
Latvia to set the heating tariffs for the provision of district heating services in the
territory of Rézekne.**4 According to the Claimant, the Regulator existed to exercise
administrative and regulatory functions with respect to the supply of heat as a public

835 Its finances were at all material times

function entrusted to the Municipality.
administered by the Municipality, together with other municipalities, through the

taxation of service providers.**®

In the Claimant’s view, it follows that the Regulator is an organ of the Republic of
Latvia within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the ILC Articles; the Regulator’s conduct

is therefore attributable to the Respondent.**”

Secondly, the Claimant argues that the Respondent was responsible for the conduct of
the Regulator as it was a State enterprise established by the Respondent within the
meaning of Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT.*°*

(C)  REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AND REZEKNES ENERGIA

The Claimant advances three arguments to support its claim that the Respondent was

responsible for the conduct of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija.

(i) The Principles

The Claimant contends that Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s and Rézeknes Energija’s conduct

is attributable to the Respondent, first, by virtue of Article 8 of the ILC Articles;**?

secondly, by virtue of Article 5 of the ILC Articles;*4° and, thirdly, by virtue of

Article 2.2(b) of the US-Latvia BIT read in conjunction with the MFN clause

contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT.*4!

(ii) The Principles Applied
First, the Claimant contends, relying on Article 8 of the ILC Articles, that the
Respondent is responsible for the actions of Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes
Energija since the Municipality was the sole shareholder in such companies and, in
this capacity, the Municipality instructed, directed and controlled all of the operations

of such companies at all relevant times.*4? Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes

Energija were therefore no more than an extension of the Municipality.*47

Consequently, the Claimant submits that the conduct of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and
Rézeknes Energija is attributable to the Respondent based on nine factual

circumstances.*“+

The Municipality authorised all of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s actions and assumed the
responsibility therefor.*° To the Claimant, Rézeknes Siltumtikli was interchangeable

with and controlled by the Municipality “such that the Municipality must have

82 Cl. Mem. { 234; Cl. Rep. P-H 14.
83 Cl. Mem. { 234.
84 The circumstances relied upon by the Claimant are as follows:

(i) the members of the boards of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija were appointed by
the chairperson of the Municipality in accordance with Latvian law (Cl. Rep. Tribunal { 9);

(ii) while Rézeknes Siltumtikli owned and operated the district heating system, the tender for a
private operator could be called only by the Municipality and the Long-Term Agreement
could be signed only with the permission of the Municipality (Cl. Rep. Tribunal { 12;
Transcript, Day 1, 38/12-17; Transcript, Day 4, 32/15; 19-21; 55/10-20);

(ii) the Municipality remained under the obligation to pay for natural gas deliveries even though
the gas was received by Rézeknes Siltumtikli (Cl. Rep. Tribunal § 12; Transcript, Day 4,
32/24-25; 33/1-3; 37/13-25; 38/1-3);

(iv) the Municipality proposed to pay the debt owed to Latvijas Gaze by increasing the share
capital of Rézeknes Siltumtikli, instead of paying Latvijas Gaze directly or letting Rézeknes
Siltumtikli decide how to pay its debt (Cl. Rep. Tribunal | 12; Transcript, Day 4, 33/4-7);

(v) the Municipality (and not Rézeknes Siltumtikli) called a tender and eventually chose a
company capable of meeting its requirements (Cl. Rep. Tribunal {{ 12);

(vi) the Municipality (and not Rézeknes Siltumtikli) proposed to terminate the Long-Term
Agreement through an agreement of the Council deputies (Cl. Rep. Tribunal {| 12);

(vii) the Municipality (and neither Rézeknes Siltumtikli nor Rézeknes Energija) suggested
solutions to solve the heat supply crisis in October 2007 involving the use of Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija to operate the heating system (Cl. Rep. Tribunal { 12);

(viii) the decision by Rézeknes Siltumtikli to commence litigation in September 2007 was taken
under the direction or control of the Municipality with the sole purpose to put pressure on
Latgales Energija’s business and to obtain a transfer of heating operations to Rézeknes
Energija (Cl. Rep. Tribunal § 12); and

(ix) the Municipality signed the October 2007 Agreement “despite it not containing any express
terms relating to the Municipality” (Transcript, Day 4, 32/21-23).

assumed responsibility for it”.**° By controlling the provision of district heating
services Rézeknes Siltumtikli exercised a public function and the control over

Rézeknes Siltumtikli was used by the Municipality to achieve a particular result.*4”

In response to the Respondent’s argument that the Municipality did not play a role in
the execution of the Long-Term Agreement, the Claimant states that the Municipality
exercised control over Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija at least starting
from the change in political leadership in Rézekne onwards (see paragraphs 128 and
139-140 above) and used such companies to achieve its goal to regain control over the
heating system.** Furthermore, the Claimant argues that the February 2005
Agreement is irrelevant to the question whether Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s conduct is to

be attributed to the Respondent under international law.*4?

Secondly, the Claimant contends, relying on Article 5 of the ILC Articles, that
Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija have been exercising delegated
governmental authority to run the district heating system and their actions are
therefore attributable to the Respondent since the supply of district heating services is
“a public power” and the responsibility of the local municipality and thus a
“governmental action” or “public function”; reliance is placed on Section 15(1) of the

Municipalities Act.*°°

The Claimant further contends that the Municipality’s creation of Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and the delegation of the supply of district heating services to Rézeknes
Siltumtikli were based on the Municipalities Act; reliance is placed on Section 14(1)
and Section 15(3) of the Municipalities Act and Section 40 of the Public

Administration Act in force between 2003 and 2009.*°!

According to the Claimant, the Respondent misconstrues Section 15 of the

Municipalities Act.*°* The Claimant agrees that Section 15 of the Municipalities Act

does not specify the means for supplying district heating services.*** However, the
Claimant contends that Section 15 of the Municipalities Act does provide for the

Municipality’s obligation to organise district heating services.***

In the Claimant’s view, the Respondent has admitted that the Municipality delegated
such public power to Latgales Energija by wrongly arguing that Rézekne Siltumtikli
had delegated to Latgales Energija the duty to devise the heat supply development
plan through the Long-Term Agreement; the Claimant contends that Rézeknes
Siltumtikli delegated the day-to-day operation of the heat supply system to Latgales
Energija under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement and Rézeknes Siltumttkli was
in a position to delegate such public power since the Municipality had delegated such

power to Rézeknes Siltumtikli in the first place.*°>

In the Claimant’s opinion, the Municipality could have passed on the Regulator’s
query regarding the status of the heat supply development plan to Rézeknes
Siltumtikli**° only provided that Rézeknes Siltumtikli had the authority to deal with

such issue on behalf of the Municipality.**”

In response to the Respondent’s contention that no governmental power had been
delegated regarding the contractual obligations towards the Claimant and Latgales
Energija, the Claimant states that the claims under the BIT relate to Rézeknes
Siltumtikli’s conduct in its exercise of governmental authority more broadly and not

only to the performance of the Long-Term Agreement.***

Furthermore, the Claimant argues that Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s decision to commence
litigation against Latgales Energija in September 2007 was based on considerations
regarding the overall control of the supply of district heating rather than commercial
considerations; the Claimant refers in particular to the context of the energy crisis

during September and October 2007 and Rézeknes Siltumttkli’s delegated power to

organise the heating system.*°? The Claimant submits that other actions were also
taken in the context of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s delegated governmental authority such

as the interference with the decisions of the Regulator.°°

It is the Claimant’s case that Rézeknes Siltumtikli continued to perform the
Municipality’s supervisory role over the operation of the heating system.**' The
Claimant contends that Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s consent was required in order for

862 Tn light of the nature of works and

works to be undertaken on public heating assets.’
the assets involved, such decisions could be made only by a company exercising the

Municipality’s public powers.°

Thirdly, the Claimant argues that the Respondent was responsible for the conduct of
the Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija as they were State enterprises
maintained or established by the Respondent within the meaning of Article 2(2)(b) of

the US-Latvia BIT.

The Claimant argues that the Municipality wholly owned, financed and controlled

Rézeknes Siltumtikli as well as Rézeknes Energija.*°

The Claimant refers to its argument based Articles 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles
summarised in footnote 844 above to argue that Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes
Energija were exercising administrative or governmental authority in the field of heat
supply delegated to them by the Municipality. Furthermore, Rézeknes Siltumtikli
and Rézeknes Energija were involved in approving commercial transactions and the

imposition of fees, quotas or charges through “their involvement in and the signing of

the October 2007 Agreement which contained an agreement as to tariffs”.5°”

The Claimant argues that the Respondent was therefore under an obligation to ensure
that Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes Energija act in a manner consistent with the

obligations that the Respondent owed to the Claimant.**

(D)  LATGALES ENERGUA

In response to the Respondent’s argument that Latgales Energija’s conduct is
attributable to the Claimant “for the purposes of the concession”, the Claimant
submits that international law does not provide for attribution of the conduct of a
subsidiary to the parent company in the absence of any reason warranting a lifting of
the corporate veil.’ Therefore, the relationship between the Respondent and the
Claimant is not “defined” by any of the other agreements entered into by Latgales

Energija and the Municipality and its wholly-owned companies.”

(3) EXPROPRIATION

The Claimant contends that it was expropriated by the Respondent in breach of

Article 4(1) of the BIT.8”!

(A) THE PRINCIPLES

The Claimant argues that Article 4(1) of the BIT prohibits the expropriation,
nationalization and taking of similar measures “against investments of investors of the
other Contracting Party” and submits that the term “investments” refers to “every kind

of asset”, including “claims to money which have been used to create an economic

value or claims to any performance having an economic value”, “any right to conduct

99872 873

economic activities conferred by state authorities”’’~ and contractual rights.

Emphasis is placed by the Claimant on a widely accepted principle whereby an

expropriation may occur outright or in stages.*’* When an expropriation takes place

in stages, the terms “creeping expropriation” and “indirect expropriation” can be used
interchangeably;*”* reliance is placed on a number of decisions recognizing creeping
expropriation such as Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine,8”® Tradex Hellas y. Albania,”
Siemens v. Argentina’”® and BG Group v. Argentina®”? °° Tt is therefore sufficient for
the Tribunal to find that the cumulative effect of the acts complained of by the

Claimant was expropriatory.**!

(B) THE CLAIMANT’S COMPLAINTS.

The Claimant submits that its investment was unlawfully expropriated by the
Respondent both outright (paragraphs 653 ff. below) and gradually over time
(paragraphs 658 ff. below).**?

In the Claimant’s view, unlawful expropriation in the present case is not limited to the

expropriation of tangible assets, but extends to the taking or destruction of all kinds of
investments by the Respondent.**?

(i) “Outright, Indirect and Unlawful Expropriation’

The Claimant contends that the forcible taking of Latgales Energija’s business on 16
September 2008 amounts to an “outright indirect unlawful expropriation” of its
investment by the Respondent.**+ On that day the Municipality’s executive decisions

were enforced by armed local and state police and personnel forcibly entering the

premises of Latgales Energija, having expelled Latgales Energija’s employees and

appropriated all of Latgales Energija’s assets used to operate the heating system.**>

According to the Claimant, the Municipality was aware that it infringed upon Latgales
Energija’s property rights as acknowledged in its decision of 14 July 2008;**° the
authorities in Rézekne showed a “total disregard for the Claimant’s property” when
issuing the decisions and orders that required Latgales Energija to surrender the assets
it had lawfully leased or purchased pursuant to the Long-Term Agreement without

any proper legal procedure.**”

The Claimant contends that its investment was indirectly expropriated as the actions
summarised above destroyed the value of Latgales Energija, rendered its shares
worthless, and caused the loss of the value of loans and guarantees issued in support
of Latgales Energija’s business, all without prompt, adequate and effective

compensation.***

The Claimant argues that it was not in the public interest to “displace” an operator
that had already invested substantial sums, planned a EUR 3.5 million investment
program over the following two years and had arranged for the EBRD to provide

further funds.**

Finally, the Claimant takes the view that the expropriation was discriminatory as it

was directed solely at Latgales Energija’s business.

(ii) “Gradual or Creeping, Unlawful Expropriation”

It is the Claimant’s case that its investment has also been gradually expropriated
through a series of acts and omissions by the Municipality, the Regulator, Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija that culminated in the events of 16 September

2008.8 These actions and omissions destroyed Latgales Energija’s business and

thereby the value of the Claimant’s shares in Latgales Energija.*°! The loss of
Latgales Energija’s business in turn caused the indirect expropriation of the
Claimant’s right to reimbursement of the loans granted to Latgales Energija and its
right to recover money it had paid to Latgales Energija’s creditors under a guarantee
agreement as the Respondent’s acts and omissions caused Latgales Energija’s

inability to pay back any such sums.*%?
The Claimant’s specific complaints are as follows:

@ the Municipality did not prepare and approve the heat supply development
plan as required by Latvian Law and Clause 1.2 of the February 2006

Agreement until after it had decided to take back the heating system;*”*

(ii) on 22 March 2006 and 28 March 2007 the Public Utilities Commission of
Latvia adopted decisions increasing the price that Latvijas Gaze was entitled
to charge for the supply of natural gas which in turn resulted in price increases
for Latgales Energija of 36 % as from May 2006 and 22 % as from May 2007

respectively;°™*

(iii) on 13 October 2006 and 11 June 2007 the Regulator rejected Latgales
Energija’s application for a revision of its tariffs to account for the increase in

the wholesale price of natural gas, having reversed its prior practice;*”

(iv) the Municipality failed to pay Latvijas Gaze for the deliveries of natural gas,

in breach of the February 2005 Agreement and the Gas Supply Agreement;**°

as a result, Latvijas Gaze stopped supplying gas to Latgales Energija and
Latgales Energija was forced to switch back to black fuel in September 2007,
which caused a short interruption of heat supply at the start of the heating

season 2007-2008;°°7

the Municipality’s wholly-owned companies brought unjustified claims
against Latgales Energija; they sought and obtained an attachment of Latgales
Energija bank accounts; such actions and decisions were carried out with the
intention to replace Latgales Energija with a Municipality-owned company

and ultimately to re-nationalize the heating system;°°*

the Regulator issued warnings putting Latgales Energija on notice that its
licences were at risk of being revoked;®” according to the Claimant, the
Regulator issued unwarranted warnings to Latgales Energija under the
influence of the Municipality, which had created the crisis situation in the first
place and actively sought to influence consumers to pay less than the full

amount of their invoices or not to pay anything at all to Latgales Energija;?”

the Municipality declared an energy crisis, which was a crisis of its own
making; then it refused to solve the crisis through the release of Latgales
Energija’s bank accounts in violation of its contractual obligation and

Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s contractual obligation to do so;2?!

the Regulator decided to take over the zone of Latgales Energija’s licences in
circumstances where the crisis situation had been created by the Municipality

itself;°°?

on 12 October 2007 the Municipality adopted a decision appointing Rézeknes
Energija as “the person in charge of providing thermal energy in Rézekne”;
Rézeknes Energija was then a newly-incorporated limited liability company,

wholly-owned by the Municipality;°

tariffs dated 9 November 2007 based on Rézeknes Energija’s indications as to

the Municipality attempted to persuade Latgales Energija’s employees to quit

their jobs and join Rézeknes Siltumtikli;°”

the Regulator wrongly stated that Latgales Energija was in breach of the law
because of an erroneous report received from Rézeknes Siltumtikli which
misrepresented the assignment agreement between Rézeknes Siltumtikli and

Latgales Energija that had no bearing on the heat supply;°°°

on 3 June 2008 the Regulator unlawfully revoked Latgales Energija’s licences
to produce, transmit and sell thermal energy relying on spurious breaches of
the licence conditions, all of which had been previously “addressed and
explained” by Latgales Energija and that had been caused by the actions of the
Municipality and the Regulator; the Regulator thereby disregarded the
required three-month waiting period in breach of Section 28(1) of the Public
Utility Regulators Act and the fact that Latgales Energija had resumed a
steady supply of thermal energy to Rézekne;””” according to the Claimant, the
revocation of the licences was the culmination of a series of acts that

destroyed Latgales Energija’s business;?"*

on 13 June 2008 the Municipality and its deputy executive director, acting as
“the person in charge of organising the provision of heating in the city of
Rézekne”, decided to appoint Municipality-owned companies temporarily to
produce and sell thermal energy in Rézekne; that decision required Latgales
Energija to hand over the assets necessary for the provision of heating services

that it had leased from Rézeknes Siltumtikli;?”

(xv) _ these decisions of 13 June 2008 entered into force despite the appeal filed by
Latgales Energija;?!° on 7 July 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli and a bailiff went to
Latgales Energija’s offices and requested Latgales Energija to hand over its

assets, which it “reasonably” refused to do;?!!

(xvi) on 14 July 2008, after the court declined its jurisdiction to hear Latgales
Energija’s appeal against the decisions of 13 June 2008, the Municipality
adopted a decision requiring Latgales Energija to provide access to the assets
leased under the Long-Term Agreement, including the assets Latgales
Energija had purchased or upgraded as a result of Claimant’s investment;?!?

Latgales Energija’s appeal did not suspend the effects of the decision;?!*

(xvii) on 16 September 2008 the Municipality’s decision of 14 July 2008 was
enforced by armed local and state police and personnel from Rézeknes
Siltumtikli; Latgales Energija’s employees were forcibly evicted from their
office building; Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s personnel took over Latgales
Energija’s offices, boiler houses and other premises and appropriated all of
Latgales Energija’s assets, including assets that were leased to Latgales
Energija for 30 years under the Long-Term Agreement and assets belonging to
Latgales Energija;?'* according to the Claimant, this effectively terminated the

30-year Long-Term Agreement;?!> and

submitted.?!’ The Tribunal will have to make a finding regarding the Respondent’s
compliance only with the BIT and not Latvian law, a proposition on which the

Claimant has relied more generally in support of all of its claims.!*

The Claimant argues that the acts that led to the destruction of Latgales Energija’s
business were politically motivated and “sprang from the realisation that the Claimant
had turned around the supply of district heating by investing its money and expertise
to make the business profitable and stable”.°!? In the Claimant’s view, it was an
attractive “proposition” to bring the now profitable business back under the

Municipality’s control by manufacturing a crisis.°”°

The Claimant finally submits that no proper legal procedure “existed” with regard to
the cumulative and discriminatory acts and omissions that eventually resulted in the
destruction of Latgales Energija’s business and seizure of its assets and that no

compensation was ever paid.°7!

(4) FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

The Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to provide fair and equitable

treatment to its investment in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.°??

(A) PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS

The Claimant submits that the exact scope of the fair and equitable treatment standard
is “purposefully left to the determination of the tribunal”; reliance is placed on the
awards in Mondev v. United States of America’? and Waste Management v. United
Mexican States?*°°> The Claimant contends that tribunals have not looked just at

individual acts, but also at the “cumulative effect of a number of different measures”

in order to assess the state’s compliance with the fair and equitable treatment
standard; reliance is placed on the award in El Paso v. Argentina?”®.°?” With reference
to the award in El Paso, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s actions outlined
in the previous sub-section on expropriation also constitute, at a minimum, a creeping

violation of the fair and equitable treatment standard.°”

It is the Claimant’s case that various acts of the Municipality, the Regulator, Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and/or Rézeknes Energija nevertheless constitute separate breaches of the

fair and equitable treatment standard “in their own right”.°?

In the Claimant’s view, the Regulator’s decisions may well comply with Latvian law
from a strictly technical point of view; however, viewed in context and as a whole, the
Regulator’s decisions and the Municipality’s conduct amount to breaches of the fair
and equitable treatment standard.?*? The Municipality’s and the Regulator’s actions
were directed “specifically and solely” at the Claimant’s investment and were not,
therefore, part of a general exercise of the Respondent’s “sovereign right to regulate

or form policy”.*!

The Claimant relies on specific aspects of the fair and equitable treatment standard as

follows:

@ the need for transparent and consistent state conduct to promote a stable legal

environment and protect the investor’s legitimate expectations;
(ii) freedom from harassment;
(iii) procedural propriety and due process; and
(iv) good faith.
The Tribunal will follow this outline in its summary of the Claimant’s position.

(B) | TRANSPARENCY AND THE INVESTOR’S LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

The Claimant contends that the Respondent breached the Claimant’s legitimate

expectations.?*>

(i) The Principles

The Claimant submits that the fair and equitable treatment standard requires the host
State to act in a transparent manner and ensure (i) that there are no ambiguities in the

legal framework regarding the investment and (ii) that any decision taken by it

O33

affecting the investment is traceable to such legal frameworl consisting of treaties

and legislation as well as on “any undertakings and representations made explicitly or
implicitly by the host state”, which may be contained in decrees, licences and similar

executive statements as well as contractual undertakings.?**

The Claimant further submits that where the host State goes back on assurances
giving rise to legitimate expectations on the part of an investor, such conduct violates

the fair and equitable treatment standard;?** reliance is placed on the award in Tecmed

v. Mexico*® 937

In addition to transparency and absence from ambiguity in the legal regime, the fair
and equitable treatment standard requires a degree of consistency in the State’s
conduct; reliance is placed on the award in Tecmed,?® and on the award in MTD v.

Chile? which followed the approach in Tecmed.°"°

framework for investment and protection of an investor’s legitimate expectations”;

reliance is placed on the decision in LG&E v. Argentina”!

Finally, the Claimant submits that a breach by the host State of a contractual
undertaking towards an investor may amount to a breach of the fair and equitable

treatment standard; reliance is placed on the award in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan? °*

(ii) The Claimant’s Specific Complaints

The Claimant argues that its legitimate expectations breached by the Respondent were

as follows:

@ the expectation that the Municipality and the entities it controlled would abide

by their contractual obligations;?45

(ii) the expectation that Latgales Energija would be able to use the assets and
create new assets for the production, transmission and distribution of thermal
energy for 30 years, recover the investments made and earn a profit, as
provided in the Long-Term Agreement;*°

(iii) the expectation that the Municipality would not take steps, either by action or
omission, to frustrate Latgales Energija’s performance under the Long-Term

Agreement;**”

expectations the Claimant would not have made the investment at all, or would have
structured the investment differently, for instance through a joint venture with the
Municipality.°

As to the time when certain representations were made to the Claimant, the Claimant
submits that it would be too narrow to consider only 28 January 2005 as the critical

date when the investment was made;?%

admittedly, certain representations relied upon
were made after 28 January 2005.°*+ However, such representations are part of a
sequence of events that took place within a relatively short period of time, and must
be properly taken into account, since the making of the investment was a process: the
Claimant made its appearance in November 2004 in a critical situation in Rézekne;
the Claimant then immediately made pledges to Unibanka and others without any
“contractual cover” and subsequently the Long-Term Agreement and the February

2005 Agreement were executed.?>

(C) | FREEDOM FRoM HARASSMENT

The Claimant further contends that the Respondent breached the fair and equitable

Claimant’s investment.

The Claimant submits that the fair and equitable treatment standard also applies “in
situations of harassment directed at the investor by the host State” and that the host

State must grant the investor freedom from harassment by its own regulatory

(ii) The Claimant’s Specific Complaints

The Claimant contends that the Municipality and the Regulator harassed the
Claimant’s investment “until it reached the point where the Regulator believed that
Latgales Energija had committed breaches of the licence conditions that justified the
cancellation of those licences”.*””?. The Claimant submits that the harassment by the

Municipality and the Regulator of which it complains consists of the following:

@ the Municipality’s failure to respond to Latgales Energija’s attempts to
advance the approval of the heat supply development plan and the delay in the

approval of such plan;?7

(ii) the Regulator’s refusal to calculate heating tariffs based on its previous

consistent practice in circumstances where increased tariffs were economically

critical as a result of factors outside of Latgales Energija’s control;?”*

(iii) ‘the Municipality’s breaches of numerous contractual obligations which could

only have been calculated adversely to affect Latgales Energija’s business;?”>

risks and costs associated with such relocation.

(D) PROCEDURAL PROPRIETY AND DUE PROCESS

The Claimant contends that the Respondent has failed to treat the Claimant’s

investment with procedural propriety and due process, thereby breaching its

obligations under the fair and equitable treatment standard.

(i) The Principles

The Claimant submits that procedural fairness “is an elementary requirement of the
tule of law and a vital element of fair and equitable treatment” and that tribunals have
consistently held that “the absence of a fair procedure or serious procedural

shortcomings were important elements in a finding of a violation of the fair and

equitable treatment standard”;*° reliance is placed by the Claimant on the awards in

propriety — as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a
complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative process”.

do so, thereby depriving the claimant of an opportunity to state its case.

Finally, the Claimant states that whereas denial of justice has been traditionally
associated with the administration of justice in local courts, the tribunal in Rumeli?”
held that “[cJourts are not the only State organs the conduct of which can amount to a
denial of justice. Administrative organs can also engage the State’s international
responsibility by denying justice”.°! The Claimant points out that to reach its
conclusion, the tribunal in Rumeli?” had cited the finding in Amco II to the effect that
there was “no provision of international law that makes impossible a denial of justice

by an administrative body”.°”?

(ii) The Claimant's Specific Complaints

The Claimant submits that the Latvian authorities failed to treat its investment with
procedural propriety and due process and thereby violated the fair and equitable

treatment standard under the BIT as follows:

@ when the Municipality attempted to appoint other entities to provide heating
services: on the first occasion, the effect of the decision to take over the zone
of Latgales Energija was suspended and therefore a precondition to appoint a
person in charge of providing thermal energy in Rézekne was not met; on the
second occasion, the preconditions to appoint a person in charge of providing
thermal energy in Rézekne were not met and the person in charge had no
authority to issue any decision directing Latgales Energija to return the heating

system to Rézeknes Siltumt?kli;°"4

(ii) the legal claims filed against Latgales Energija by various Latvian entities
aimed principally at having Latgales Energija’s bank accounts attached in

order to paralyse Latgales Energija’s commercial activities;?”>

the licence conditions before its licences were revoked, contrary to the

requirements of Latvian law; the Regulator should have issued a warning
regarding the possible revocation of the licences and could have revoked the

licences only provided that the warning went unheeded;?”°

when deciding to revoke Latgales Energija’s licences, the Regulator took into
account “events and circumstances” that Latgales Energija had previously
shown not to constitute breaches of its licence requirements in response to
queries from the Regulator, the substance of which the Regulator failed to

address;°”” and

the Municipality used its “public law powers” to circumvent the established
procedure involving the person in charge of providing thermal energy in
Rézekne when issuing its decision to hand over the leased assets to the
municipally-owned company; the Municipality used its “public law powers”
effectively to terminate the Long-Term Agreement and regain control over the

heating system.°**

(E) Goop FAITH

The Claimant contends that the Municipality and the Regulator failed to act in good

faith towards its investment and therefore violated the fair and equitable treatment

standard under the BIT.°?

(i) The Principles

The Claimant argues that the requirement of good faith is inherent in public

international law and the fair and equitable treatment standard and that tribunals have

long recognized the role which good faith plays in the fair and equitable treatment

obligation towards investors.'° Reliance is placed by the Claimant on the awards in

the February 2006 Agreement and the October 2007 Agreement; in particular
the Municipality’s refusal to comply with its obligation not to frustrate the
performance of the Long-Term Agreement by Latgales Energija and to adopt
the decisions required by Latvian law in order that Latgales Energija could

properly perform the Long-Term Agreement;!*

Respondent is responsible for the actions of the Rézekne authorities, it is itself

(6) | ARBITRARY OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES

The Claimant submits that the actions of the local authorities in Latvia towards the
Claimant’s investment were both arbitrary and discriminatory and impaired the

management, maintenance, use and enjoyment of the Claimant’s investment. !°7*

(A) THE PRINCIPLES

The Claimant complains of a breach of Article 3(1), second paragraph, of the BIT.

The Claimant submits that it is sufficient to show that a measure was either arbitrary

1029

or discriminatory; reliance is placed on Azurix!°” and Siag v. Egypt!0°0,13!

The Claimant states that tribunals had adopted different approaches as to the meaning
and scope of the concept of an “arbitrary measure”.!°°?_ Some tribunals such as the
UNCITRAL tribunal in Lauder v. Czech Republic,' Occidental y. Ecuador'®** and
CMS vy. Argentina'®*> relied on the ordinary meaning of the adjective “arbitrary”
which they defined as “founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or
fact”.!°°° Other tribunals relied on the finding of the International Court of Justice in

ELSI (United States of America v. Italy)'°’ that contrasted arbitrary measures with the

further relies on the findings in National Grid v. Argentina,!° Saluka v. Czech

Republic! and LG&E'4! 10

Moreover, reliance is placed by the Claimant on the award in AES v. Hungary! 1044

The Claimant concludes that use by a State of its governmental powers to meddle
with the contractual rights of an investor can constitute arbitrary and discriminatory

measures under the BIT.!

As to the definition of discriminatory measures, the Claimant relies on the tribunal’s
finding in Lauder to submit that a measure need not violate domestic law in order to
be discriminatory; a provision of domestic law could in fact itself be found
discriminatory.!° The non-discrimination standard requires “a rational justification
of any differential treatment of a foreign investor”; reliance is placed on

Saluka'047 1948

The Claimant finally contends that a measure may be found to be discriminatory
irrespective of whether the State acted with an intention to discriminate, as found by

the tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina! 10° However, the Claimant states that

whether the measures are discriminatory, as found by the LG&E tribunal!!!

(B) THE CLAIMANT’S SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS
According to the Claimant, the following acts and omissions constituted arbitrary

measures:

@ the Municipality’s “undue delay” to devise and approve the heat supply

development plan; reliance is placed on National Grid;

(ii) the Municipality’s failure to comply with the February 2005 Agreement and

the February 2006 Agreement; reliance is placed on National Grid;!4

(iii) the Regulator’s reversal of its previous practice and its refusal to approve new
tariffs in the absence of an approved heat supply development plan; reliance is

placed on Lauder and National Grid;!°°

(iv) R&ézeknes Siltumtikli’s and Rézeknes Energija’s lawsuits against Latgales

  

Energija and the ensuing attachment of Latgales Energija’s bank accounts;

reliance is placed on National Grid;'!®

(v) the Municipality’s refusal to permit the attachment of Latgales Energija’s bank

accounts to be lifted; reliance is placed on National Grid;'"

(vi) the Regulator’s decision of 11 October 2007 to take over Latgales Energija’s

zone without waiting for Latgales Energija response to the Regulator’s

warning of 4 October 2007; reliance is placed on Lauder;'°8

1051 LG&E v. Argentina, CLA-31 { 146. The Claimant submits that in this case the tribunal found the
measure in dispute to be discriminatory based on the effect of the measure; however, a measure will be in
breach of Art. 3(1) of the BIT provided that it has been shown to be discriminatory in its effect or to be
based on an intention to discriminate.

the Regulator’s “warnings and queries”, based on factually or legally incorrect

and

the Municipality’s decision of 27 June 2008 requiring Latgales Energija to

hand over the leased assets required to provide heating services. !°

The Claimant contends in particular that the Municipality and the Regulator used their

governmental and regulatory powers to create a crisis situation between September

and October 2007 in a deliberate attempt to regain control over the heating system and

force Latgales Energija (i) to relinquish its right to operate the heating system for 30

years under the Long-Term Agreement; reliance is placed on Lauder and AES'°® and

(ii) “to abandon its contractual right to tariff increases as a result of increased costs”

through the combination of the Regulator’s refusal to grant tariff increases based on

the absence of a heat supply development plan and the Municipality’s delay in

approving such a plan; reliance is placed on AES.!°%

Finally, the Claimant argues that the Municipality and the Regulator used their
governmental and regulatory powers between September 2007 and June 2008 to
create a situation which would paralyse Latgales Energija’s operation of the heating
system and eventually constituted the ground for the revocation of Latgales Energija’s

licences; reliance is placed on AES. 1067

According to the Claimant, these actions were also discriminatory because they were

directed only at the business of Latgales Energija.!°°

The Claimant contends that the use and enjoyment of its investment was irreparably
impaired as a result of these actions and that it could no longer “sell or maintain” the
investment.!° The cumulative effect of these arbitrary and discriminatory measures

was to destroy the value of the Claimant’s investment.!°7”

(7) BREACHES OF THE MosT FAVOURED NATION CLAUSE
(A) THE PRINCIPLES

The Claimant relies on Article 3(2) of the BIT and prays in aid Articles 2(2) and 3(1)
of the Latvia-Romania BIT; the latter provision states that when a Contracting Party
has admitted an investment in its State territory in accordance with its laws, it shall

inter alia “grant the necessary permits in connection with such investment”!07!,!°7

(B) | THE CLAIMANT’S SPECIFIC COMPLAINTS

The Claimant submits that the Municipality failed to issue the required heat supply
development plan and, consequently, the Regulator failed to authorise Latgales

Energija to charge the revised heating tariffs even though these tariff increases were

necessary in order for Latgales Energija’s business to continue to operate due to the
consecutive increases in the price of gas charged by Latvijas Gaze.'°”? To the
Claimant, tariff changes were an essential part of its investment as it is impossible for
a heat supply operator to function without tariffs that accurately reflect the costs of the

business in accordance with the provisions of the tariff methodology.!°”*

In addition, the Regulator unreasonably refused to maintain Latgales Energija’s
licences to produce, transmit and sell thermal energy in Rézekne in breach of its own
regulations.'° This impaired the management, maintenance and use of the

Claimant’s investment. !°”

The Claimant submits that the Respondent therefore breached the MFN clause
contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT in connection with Articles 2(2) and 3(1) of the
Latvia-Romania BIT!°’’ as the local authorities failed to grant the necessary

authorisations or permits in connection with the Claimant’s investment.!07*

THE RESPONDENT’S CASE ON LIABILITY

The structure of the Respondent’s defence does not mirror the outline of the
Claimant’s statement of case. On the one hand, the Respondent has advanced certain
arguments which are not directly related to any specific treatment standard; on the
other, the Respondent’s discussion of the applicable standards has been brief on most

aspects. The Respondent’s position may be summarised as follows:

@ general denial and overall response to the Claimant’s position (see paragraphs

711 ff. below);
(ii) specific issues (see paragraphs 717 ff. below);

(iii) attribution (see paragraphs 749 ff. below); and

(iv) no violation of the BIT (see paragraphs 763 ff. below).

(wD GENERAL DENIAL AND OVERALL RESPONSE TO THE CLAIMANT’S POSITION

In its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, the Respondent denies and objects to all
allegations of any breach of the BIT made by the Claimant and all prayers for relief
submitted by the Claimant including the request for payment of damages or

compensation for the involvement of experts and counsel.!°”?

The Respondent argues that the Claimant’s case is based on inaccurate facts and is
misleading insofar as it predicates that the Claimant suffered the loss of its business.
The Claimant’s case is presented in a highly selective and subjective manner in point
of fact and law, rests on an oversimplification of the matter in dispute and discards
important aspects; the Claimant’s complaints rest on witness statements signed by

persons directly interested in the outcome of this case.!°*°

Finally, the Claimant has put purely commercial issues before the Tribunal which are

outside the scope of international investment law.

According to the Respondent, the damage allegedly suffered by the Claimant is based
on inflated future dividends and losses due to the failure to obtain the repayment of
loans; the Long-Term Agreement was demonstrably unsuitable to generate any cash
flows, as confirmed by the Respondent’s expert report submitted by KPMG Baltics
SIA, 1081

The Rézekne Municipality, the Respondent argues, wished to improve the quality and
economic performance of its district heating system, to transpose the existing, highly
subsidized and economically inefficient system into a business-orientated system
“with consideration of the social interest at large”.!°°? After the initial tender yielded
no suitable results, the Claimant and the Municipality reached agreement on a

“concession arrangement” regarding the district heating assets in Rézekne.!°*

Rézekne is a major city in Latgale, a region with “highest social sensitivity” due to
widespread unemployment, low salaries, a negative migration rate and low economic

activity; any fluctuation in the continuity, stability, service level or price of basic

public utility services can cause serious social unrest and resistance. !0*+

The Respondent contends that an overall analysis of its conduct shows such conduct
to be “consistent and predictable”; only the Claimant’s conduct led to the adverse

effects of which the Claimant has complained.!°*5

(2) SPECIFIC ISSUES

The Tribunal will summarise the Respondent’s arguments relating to these specific

issues as follows:

@ the application of the Principles of European Contract Law, UNIDROIT
Principles of International Commercial Contracts and TransLex Principles (see

paragraphs 718 ff. below);

(ii) the functional and legal independence between the different parts of the

“concession arrangement” (see paragraphs 719 ff. below);

(iii) the duty to pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas Gaze (see paragraphs
726 ff. below);

(iv) _ the outstanding lease payments (see paragraphs 733 ff. below);

(v) the influence allegedly brought to bear by the Municipality on the Regulator
(see paragraphs 734 ff. below);

(vi) the review of the tariffs by the Regulator (see paragraphs 743 ff. below);
(vii) the development plan (see paragraphs 736 ff. below); and
(viii) the revocation of Latgales Energija’s licences to produce, transmit and sell

thermal energy (see paragraphs 743 ff. below).

720.

(A) THE APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES OF EUROPEAN CONTRACT Law,
UNIDROIT PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL CONTRACTS
AND TRANSLEX PRINCIPLES
As the “concession arrangement” was “basically spelled out in commercial
agreements”, the Respondent invokes the application of the Principles of European
Contract Law,!°° the 2010 UNIDROIT Principles of International Commercial
Contracts and the Trans-Lex Principles which may be considered as general principles
of law recognised by civilized nations within the meaning of Article 38(1)(c) of the
Statute of International Court of Justice,!°*” contending that the application of such
principles is suitable where specific issues are to be decided and gaps are found to

exist in the abstract principles set out in an investment treaty. !°%

(B) | THE FUNCTIONAL AND LEGAL INDEPENDENCE BETWEEN THE
DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE “CONCESSION ARRANGEMENT”

The Respondent argues that the “concession arrangement” consisted of the following

commercial contracts:!°

@ the Long-Term Agreement;!”°

(ii) the February 2005 Agreement;!0*!

(iii) the Amended Long-Term Agreement;!°?

(iv) _ the February 2006 Agreement;!”? and

(v) the October 2007 Agreement.!°*

The Respondent argues that these are typically commercial contracts, despite the fact

that the Long-Term Agreement relates to the lease of public assets; hence Latgales

Energija’s duty to cooperate to seek ways to reduce the heating tariffs for Rézekne’s
inhabitants.!°°° With reference to Sections 4 and 14(2) of the Latvian Municipalities
Act, the Respondent further states that Latvian law distinguishes between the public

functions of local governments and their “commercial functions in carrying out their

public functions”.!°%°

On the other hand, the “concession arrangement” consisted of Latgales Energija’s
licences issued by the Regulator for the production, transmission and sale of thermal

energy in Rézekne.'°*’ According to the Respondent, these licences were issued in

the “public (administrative) law sphere”. !°°*

A further distinguishing factor between the two parts of the “concession arrangement”

is the legal, functional and financial independence of the Regulator in line with the

requirements of European law.!°?

The Respondent refutes the Claimant’s argument that all the contracts concluded

between Latgales Energija and the Municipality represent exercise of public power by

1100

the Municipality. The treatment of the Long-Term Agreement and related

agreements as commercial contracts is therefore in accordance with the “sense and

meaning” of the Treaty and the applicable Latvian law.!!°!

The Respondent further contends that “State contracts (...) of commercial (economic)
nature (...) (for example, privatization agreements, joint venture agreements,
concession agreements)” are subject to international law as a general rule.'!°? While

such contracts may contain “sovereign promises”, they are still treated as commercial

agreements; reliance is placed on the ad hoc award in Texaco v. Libya!!03,!!04

The Respondent finally argues that the October 2007 Agreement gives rise only to
best-effort duties as it was concluded at a time when the proceedings in the Latvian
courts reached their peak and it dealt with a number of aspects, including the steps
required in order to have the attachment of Latgales Energija’s bank account lifted, in
order for the parties to agree on the key points of disagreement regarding the Long-
Term Agreement and to reach agreement on amendments to the Long-Term

Agreement.!!°>

The Respondent asserts that this is confirmed by the fact that no party “has ever
challenged the non-performance of this agreement in court”.!!°° According to the
Respondent, all involved parties understood that the October 2007 Agreement was
simply an agreement to cooperate in good faith and was not a “contractually binding
agreement with exactly spelled out rights and obligations”.!!°7 Reliance is placed by
the Respondent on Articles 1:302, 5:102 and 5:105 of the PECL “as general principles
of international law”; an analysis of the October 2007 Agreement under Latvian law

would yield the same result.!!°*

(C) | THEDuTY TO PAY FOR THE NATURAL GAS SUPPLIED BY LATVUJAS
GAZE
The Respondent contends that the Long-Term Agreement is to be characterised as a
contract for the lease of a business, i.e. the whole heating service business in Rézekne
(Betriebsiibergang), accordingly, the lessee stepped into the shoes of the lessor in the

lessor’s relationship with third parties, including Latvijas Gaze.''

In reply to the Claimant’s submission that the German legal concept of
Betriebsiibergang is inapplicable in the present case, the Respondent submits that it
used the expression Betriebsiibergang “to denote the specific mode of mergers and
acquisitions”, in particular the acquisition of a business as a whole as opposed to a
share deal or an asset deal limited to certain assets; reliance was placed by the

Respondent on Sections 18 and 20 of the Latvian Commercial Code and Clause 5.1 of

the Long-Term Agreement, which expressly provides for the transfer of all of the

lessor’s employment contracts to the lessee.!!!°

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that no Betriebsiibergang took place
on the basis that all assets were not transferred; reliance is placed on Section 20(1) of
the Latvian Commercial Code whereby it is permissible to transfer only certain

assets.!!!!

The Respondent rejects the Claimant’s contention that Latvian civil law gives
preference to a literal rule of interpretation and construction.'!'!?. Rather, Latvian civil
law is based on the civil law tradition “where similar aspects are construed reasonably
and the main actual form of construction of contracts is [to determine] what the other

party objectively could understand”.!!!>
The Respondent contends the following:

@ on 27 October 2005 Latgales Energija was given an opportunity to acquaint
itself with the content of the Gas Supply Agreement, which provided for the
exact amount of gas that had to be supplied to the Municipality as well as the
sums to be paid thereunder; reliance is placed by the Respondent on Clause 4

of the February 2005 Agreement!!!4,!!!5

(ii) Latgales Energija by its subsequent conduct acknowledged its obligation to

pay for the natural gas supplied, e.g. as the Claimant submitted that it had

received and paid Latvijas Gaze’s invoices;!!!°

(iii) the Claimant attempts to show that it was entitled to pay a lower price, but the
Claimant does not deny that it accepted, and at least in part paid, such

invoices;!!"7 and

733.

(iv) _ Latgales Energija was therefore aware of, and fully understood, its duty to pay

for the natural gas supplied.!!!®

In the Respondent’s view, it is therefore impossible to conclude that, due to a lack of
specific and clear provisions to the contrary, the lessor should pay something to the
lessee in the presence of a business lease; only Latgales Energija itself was fully

responsible to pay for all of the natural gas delivered.!!'?

The Respondent alleges that the Municipality did its utmost best to persuade Latvijas
Gaze to continue to supply natural gas despite Latgales Energija’s refusal to pay for
the outstanding invoices; however, Latvijas Gaze turned down the Municipality’s
request.!'!° The Respondent’s efforts belie the Claimant’s argument that the

Municipality intended to harm the “Concession Project”.!!7!

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant misconstrues the February 2005
Agreement and October 2007 Agreement.'!?? Clause 4, paragraph 2 of the February
2005 Agreement, read as a whole in conjunction with the fourth recital of the same
agreement and the Long-Term Agreement, means that the contracting parties intended
to hold the Municipality liable towards Latgales Energija in case the Municipality
decided to cancel the gasification of the area or request Latvijas Gaze to deliver a

smaller amount of gas than it had originally undertaken to buy.'!?

(D) | THE OUTSTANDING LEASE PAYMENTS
Rézeknes Siltumtikli considered that Latgales Energija failed to make the lease
payments under the Long-Term Agreement. To request such payments, Rézeknes

Siltumtikli sent a “notice of warning” to Latgales Energija in November 2006.!!*4

(E) — THE INFLUENCE ALLEGEDLY BROUGHT TO BEAR BY THE MUNICIPALITY

ON THE REGULATOR
According to the Respondent, the Regulator was a legally, functionally and
financially independent entity that made its decisions based “only on strict grounds
prescribed” by the Public Utility Regulators Act, and was financed solely through fees

; reliance is placed

 

paid by the providers of public utilities such as Latgales Ener;
on Sections 8(6), 8(7), 8(8), 11 and 29 of the Latvian Public Utility Regulators Act!!5

 

in force at the relevant time.'!?° The Regulator’s legal status, governance, operation
and competence were entirely separate from the Municipality and its decision-making
process.'!?” The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s allegations are completely
unwarranted and not proven by any evidence; reliance is placed on the decisions made
by the Latvian courts denying Latgales Energija’s complaints with respect to the

manner in which the Regulator had applied the law!!?8,!!7°

The Respondent denies that the local authorities in Latvia and the entities they own

and control attempted to evict the Claimant from its business in a concerted plan.!!*°

According to the Respondent, there is no evidence on the record supporting such a

claim other than mere allegations, assumptions, emotional language and requests from

the Claimant in order that the Tribunal draw adverse inference.!!*!

(F) THE DEVELOPMENT PLAN

The Respondent contends that the parties had a “mutual cooperative obligation (...) to
do their utmost to achieve a mutually acceptable outcome” under Clause 1.2 of the

February 2006 Agreement; it was not a matter solely for Latgales Energija to decide

“what is acceptable in order for the Development Plan to be adopted”.!!*?

Considering the Claimant’s experience in various similar projects, it is “the logical

and fair construction” that the Claimant had “accepted the risk that the Development

Plan shall be developed together with the Rézekne municipality” and that both parties
would therefore determine the acceptable content of such plan.'!*? Latgales Energija
had assumed the risk of the mutual cooperation in the development of the Plan;!!** it
was a matter for the Claimant (through Latgales Energija) to come up with a proper
draft.''9° It is admitted by the Respondent that it was the Municipality which

remained ultimately responsible for devising the plan.!!°

The Respondent further states that the issues relating to the adoption of the

development plan fall into four categories as follows:!!°”

@ the Parties’ conduct and their understanding as to whose legal duty it was to

devise the development plan in light of the particular arrangements;

(ii) the timing and circumstances in which Latgales Energija came up with the

allegations concerning the lack of a development plan;

(iii) the Respondent’s conduct after it turned out that Latgales Energija was unable

to provide a proper development plan; and

(iv) _ the reasonable risk any prudent investor would have been deemed to have

assumed considering the lack of a development plan.

On the first point, the Respondent contends that “subsequent practice” plays a
paramount role in public international law, that Latgales Energija understood that it
had been delegated the duty to devise a concrete text and submit it to the Municipality
for approval, as shown the “consistent development of events” since Latgales Energija
did not disclaim its duty provide a draft development plan and that Latgales Energija
is therefore not entitled to rely on the Municipality’s ultimate responsibility to devise

the development plan to avoid its own duty.''!** Finally, the Administrative District

Court stated inter alia that the Municipality was entitled to delegate this obligation

“freely to any private individual or entity”.!!°°

On the second point, the Respondent contends that Latgales Energija suddenly
changed its approach to its obligations after undertaking them, that Latgales Energija
has not been “sufficiently persistent” in making its complaint that the Municipality’s
failure to devise a development plan amounted to a breach of the Municipality’s
duties to the Claimant, and, finally, that Latgales Energija, having threatened to sue

alleged breaches, ’'*” eventually failed to do so.

On the third point, the Respondent submits that the Municipality in good faith invited
Latgales Energija to participate in the drafting of a “proper” development plan after it
had appeared most likely that Latgales Energija would not be in a position to submit a

“proper document” and the Municipality took the matter in its own hands.!!4?

On the fourth and final point, the Respondent contends that Clause 1.6 of the
February 2005 Agreement expressly provides that tariffs would be adjusted in line
with the applicable provisions of law, that there was therefore no representation or
warranty relating to the situation in which there was no development plan in place,
nor was there any waiver on the part of the Municipality for the benefit of the
Claimant.''3 Moreover, Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement expressly
provided that Latgales Energija should devise a draft of the development plan which
the Municipality would then “formally validate”, with the clear implication that such
draft would have to comply with the law.''#4 Clause 5 of the February 2006
Agreement specifically provided that Latgales Energija was entitled to claim damages
for the Municipality’s failure to comply with its duties under the Agreement; Latgales
Energija did not enforce such contract term.''#* The Respondent further notes that the

licences issued shortly after the conclusion of the Long-Term Agreement contained

various obligations that were dependent on the existence of a development plan, and

that were not challenged by the Claimant.''4°

Therefore, the Claimant is not entitled to rely on the Regulator’s previous practice or
the first approval of the tariffs following the issuance of the licences to Latgales
Energija.''47_ The Regulator’s first approval of Latgales Energija’s tariffs should
rather be regarded as a “good faith gesture” rather than the continuation of an alleged

development plan of 15 November 2006!'4° did not include any verifiable

explanations of the figures it contained.!'!*°

(G) THE REVIEW OF THE TARIFFS BY THE REGULATOR

The Respondent submits that (i) Latgales Energija applied to the Regulator for the
approval of increased heating tariffs on no less than four occasions,''*! (ii) the
Regulator approved an increase in the tariff by decision no. 19 of 19 December
2005,'!°? (iii) the Regulator then denied Latgales Energija’s further requests on the
basis that Latgales Energija had failed to show “objective business necessity” for a
further increase in the tariff as required by law and (iv) the Regulator on 7 December
2007 revoked its decision no. 28 of 9 November 2007 increasing the tariff on the basis
that Latgales Energija had falsely represented the gas supply costs!!*3.!!54

According to Respondent, the Claimant misconstrues the applicable Latvian law in
that it contends that applications for a new tariff could have been submitted only
provided that a development plan had been adopted.'!°> The Respondent submits that

“the Claimant could have relied, logically, on more general development documents

expressly states that the utilities provider “makes up its own plan in accordance with a
Development Plan or other planning document of the municipality”.!'*” Reliance is
placed by the Respondent on the Textbook for Regulatory Implications of District

Heating! "58,1159

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant’s arguments relating to the
Regulator’s prior practice are without foundation since the approval of the first
request for a new tariff cannot amount to a “practice”;!! the Claimant should have
realized that the “concession arrangement” opened a new page in administrative
practice and the previous administrative practice relating to the heat supply in

Rézekne would be history.!'°!

(H) — THE REVOCATION OF LATGALES ENERGUA’S LICENCES TO PRODUCE,
TRANSMIT AND SELL THERMAL ENERGY
The Respondent contends that Latgales Energija has been in continuous breach of its
duties under the licences!'™ and the applicable law to the detriment of the Rézekne
inhabitants in that (i) Latgales Energija failed to submit regular yearly review reports
for the previous heating season and forecasts for the future, (ii) Latgales Energija
failed to submit a “proper” development plan as required by its licences and (iii)
Latgales Energija failed at the start of the heating season 2007/2008 to provide any
heating to the northern district of Rézekne, three kindergartens and provided
insufficient heating to six schools.''* As a result, the Regulator issued the following

decisions:

@ on 4 October 2007 the Regulator issued a warning to Latgales Energija

(ii) on 11 October 2007 the Regulator suspended Latgales Energija’s

licences!!®;!!67 and

(iii) on 3 June 2008 the Regulator revoked Latgales Energija’s licences because
“instead of delivering a new and proper solution, [Latgales Energija]
continued blaming the Rézekne municipality for what had happened“ and
there was a risk that the same situation could occur again in the following
heating season;!!® the Respondent contends that the Claimant acknowledged
its failure to submit the relevant regulatory documentation and to provide
heating services in Rézekne as facts when it argued denying its liability before

the Regulator!!?,!!7°

The Respondent submits that the Municipality ultimately had to appoint an interim
provider for heating services in Rézekne under the applicable law and therefore
requested Latgales Energija to return the leased assets on 14 July 2008;!!7! the
Municipality was left with no choice but to enforce the decision with the help of the
police forces as the heating season was about to start and Latgales Energija continued

to refuse to return the heating assets.!!77

The Respondent further argues that (i) the Claimant is not entitled to rely on the
“formal duty” of the Municipality to devise and approve the development plan and the
“alleged duty” of the Municipality to pay for the delivered gas in case Latgales
Energija did not make a sufficient profit, (ii) the Municipality needed to avoid
subsidizing the district heating system, which was clearly understood by the Claimant,

price difference in case of an unforeseen rise in the supply costs was contrary to the
very purpose of inviting private capital, (iv) a prudent risk management by the
Claimant should have taken into account the factors that are typically involved in the
district heating business and resolved them before undertaking the duties arising out
of the concession (see paragraphs 781 ff. below) and, finally (v) there was no duty on
the Municipality to guarantee the solvency and viability of the business, which was a

risk to be borne by the Claimant.!!7

The Respondent submits that the Municipality reasonably exercised its discretion so
as to involve another entity in order to have heating supplied under such
circumstances, bearing in mind that Latgales Energija had expressed its dissatisfaction
with the performance of the Long-Term Agreement from the outset of the Project, had
blamed the Municipality for everything and had hardly a caring attitude, so that the
Municipality’s decision to proceed with the enforcement of its previous decision
directing Latgales Energija to “return” the leased assets was a logical outcome in the
circumstances.''! That said, the Respondent points out that actual force was never

used and that the Claimant had never adduced any evidence in that regard.!!7°

(3) ATTRIBUTION

The Tribunal will summarise the Respondent’s arguments relating to attribution in the

following order:
@ the Municipality (see paragraph 750 below);
(ii) the Regulator (see paragraphs 751 ff. below);

(iii) R&zeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija (see paragraphs 753 ff. below);

(A) | THE MUNICIPALITY

The Respondent does not contest the attribution of the Municipality’ conduct to itself.

(B) | THEREGULATOR

As for the Regulator, the Respondent argues that the Rézekne Municipality’s direction
and control over the Regulator cannot be inferred based on the sole fact that the
Municipality (together with 31 other Municipalities) appointed the members of the

Regulator or that the Municipality, Rézeknes Siltumtikli and the Regulator interacted

with one another.!!76

The Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proof

with respect to the allegations that the Municipality influenced, or sought to influence,

the Regulator.!!7”

(C)  REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AND REZEKNES ENERGIA

The Respondent contends that Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija do not

come within the purview of Articles 5 and 8 of the ILC Articles. Both entities were

incorporated as commercial entities subject to private law.!!78

The Respondent explains that the Latvian State and Local Government-Owned
Corporations Act!!”? determines the rules applicable to commercial entities owned by
public authorities; the corporate governance of such entities and the public

shareholder’s authority over such entities follows the provisions in the Latvian

Commercial Code. These principles are restated also in the Municipalities Act!!8°.!!8!

Article 5 of the ILC Articles is not applicable to Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes

Energija. The Respondent relies on the following succession of events:!!8*

@ on 3 August 2004 the Municipality issued “a general conceptual consent with

reference to [the] Municipality’s overall obligation under the law to organise

27.1183

the heat supply”; such permission by the Municipality to lease the assets

was given upon request of Rézeknes Siltumtikli pursuant to Section 15(1) of

the Municipalities Act; such permission by the Municipality signalled respect

on the part of the Municipality for Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s “corporate interests,

decisions and plans”;

(ii) then the draft Long-Term Agreement submitted by Latgales Energija was
discussed under the auspices of Rézeknes Siltumtikli;!!**

(ii) the Management Board of Rézeknes Siltumtikli approved such draft;!!85

(iv) the Supervisory Council of Rézeknes Siltumtikli then in turn approved the

draft;!!8° and

(v) whereupon on 28 January 2005 the Municipality approved the Long-Term
Agreement,!!®? which decision was also made pursuant to Section 15(1) of the
Municipalities Act and the previous decisions of the bodies of Rézeknes

Siltumtikli.

Neither Rézeknes Siltumtikli nor Rézeknes Energija have been delegated any public

1188

function according to the Responden According to Latvian law, in particular

Section 40(2) of the Public Administration Act!!®® as well as Section 15(3) of the

Municipalities Act!!*° a public function may be delegated only by contract or law;!!?!

however, no delegation agreement was ever concluded between the Municipality and

Rézeknes Siltumtikli and the Claimant fails to show which legal provision provided

for a delegation of a public function to either Rézeknes Siltumtikli or Rézeknes
Energija.'!°?

The Long-Term Agreement is a commercial contract and Rézeknes Siltumtikli
executed such contract acting in its “private commercial capacity”, as shown for

instance by the Preamble and Clause 2.1.1 of the said agreement.!!%*

Article 8 of the ILC Articles is not applicable to Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes
Energija since neither company has acted “as an extended arm of the Municipality” at
least in respect of the contractual duties owed to the Claimant and Latgales
Energija.!!*

There needs to be a “sufficiently serious involvement” of the State in the business of
the company it owns, and it is not enough for a State to be involved “sporadically in
certain important aspects of the matter” or “to care or [show] interest for the process

or the outcome”.!!°5

In the present case the Municipality permitted (but did not mandate) Rézeknes
Siltumtikli to conclude the Long-Term Agreement with a particular operator upon
Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s request, the terms of the Long-Term Agreement were freely
discussed without the Municipality’s involvement and a separate agreement was made
between the Municipality and Latgales Energija subsequent to the execution of the
Long-Term Agreement; therefore, Latgales Energija understood that Rézeknes
Siltumtikli’s (and later Rézeknes Energija’s) conduct was not attributable to the
Municipality.!!° In particular, Rézeknes Siltumtikli acting in a commercial setting,
through commercial means and on at an arm’s length basis, (i) came up with the idea
of the Long-Term Agreement, (ii) was free to influence the main points of the Long-
Term Agreement, (iii) initiated local civil proceedings against Latgales Energija on its

own in order to claim damages for breach of the said agreement and (iv) terminated

the agreement on its own, rather than acting upon request of the Municipality or the

Regulator.!!%”

The Respondent denies the Claimant’s allegation that Rézeknes Siltumtikli and
Rézeknes Energija were involved in “imposing fees, quotas or charges” because they
signed the October 2007 Agreement.'!* If all the parties privy to the October 2007
Agreement were attempting to lower tariffs, that was only to ease potential social

tension.!!%°

Finally, the Respondent did not present additional arguments regarding the Claimant’s
submission with regard to the application of Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT
pursuant to the MFN Clause contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT since, in the
Respondent’s view, Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT fits well into Article 5 of the
ILC Articles and does not represent “an addition to the general rules of attribution

existing under customary international law”.!7°°

(D)  LATGALES ENERGUA

The Respondent contends that Latgales Energija was the Claimant’s vehicle through
which it operated “the concession” and therefore Latgales Energija’s conduct is

attributable to the Claimant “for the purposes of the concession”.!2"!

(4) | THE RESPONDENT’S ARGUMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE ALLEGED
BREACHES OF THE BIT

(A) No BREACH OF THE BIT

The Respondent submits that its treatment of the Claimant’s investment does not

constitute a violation of the BIT.

The Claimant’s claims are in essence based on three points: (i) the Municipality was
bound to pay the full price for the natural gas supplied, (ii) the Municipality was

bound to prepare a heat supply development plan for the City, and its failure to

comply with such duty caused the Regulator to dismiss the new tariffs proposed by
Latgales Energija’s and (iii) the Municipality and the Regulator conspired to drive

Latgales Energija out of business.

The Respondent has already shown (i) that the duty to pay for the natural gas supplied
was only on Latgales Energija (see paragraphs 726 ff. above), (ii) that it was Latgales
Energija’s obligation to provide the development plan (see paragraphs 736 ff. above)
and (iii) that the Regulator applied Latvian law properly, as confirmed by the
decisions made by the Latvian courts that are entitled to due deference; there is,
moreover, no evidence of any collusion or conspiracy between the Municipality and

the Regulator (see paragraph 734 above).

Regarding the Claimant’s expropriation claim, the Respondent asserts that it is
contradictory for the Claimant to make a claim for outright and gradual expropriation
at the same time.'?°* The Respondent contests the Claimant’s allegation that Latgales
Energija was actually insolvent and the contention that Latvian law prevented the

liquidation of the company due to pending litigation.'?°

The Respondent contends that the Claimant’s complaint of a breach of its
expectations due to the Municipality’s alleged failure to devise a development plan of
its own motion must be considered under international law, since a breach of national
law does not automatically entail a breach of international law and the position under

1204 However, as an experienced and

Latvian law cannot therefore be dispositive.
prudent manager, the Claimant could not have been surprised by the sharp increase in
the gas supply costs and should have taken all precautions required “to avoid
contentious issues” under the circumstances, such as carrying out risk management
and, for example, requiring guarantees from the Municipality regarding the
development plan before it entered into the “concession arrangement”; but the only

guarantee Latgales Energija obtained was contained in Clause 1.2 of the February

2006 Agreement.!?°

In such circumstances, it is fair to conclude, according to the Respondent, that the sole
obligation on the State is not to adopt decisions that are arbitrary or “prejudiced
decisions”.!°° In the present case, the Respondent actively sought solutions
considering the interests of the inhabitants of Rézekne at large, and not only the
commercial interests of the Claimant.'?°’ The Respondent submits that in “[s]ocially
vulnerable business areas” such as district heating services, the investor’s
expectations cannot be the same as in “wider, general business undertakings” because
a “social element plays a substantial role”.!°* According to the Respondent, Latgales
Energija was involved in the whole process to devise the development plan and its
representatives participated in 12 out of 16 meetings of the Working Group; the
correspondence contained in R-30 showed the Municipality to be interested in finding

common ground.!?°

The Respondent further points out that neither the Municipality nor Rézeknes
Siltumtikli promised that the opportunity to have new tariffs approved without the
existence of a development plan would continue for an indefinite period of time.'?!°

According to the Respondent, the same test applies to the legal question whether the
Respondent had breached the Claimant’s expectations by failing to procure that

Latvijas Gaze should not suspend the deliveries of natural gas.'?!!

The Respondent submits that public international law is not “simply a supreme
adjudicator” and that the Tribunal must not consider “whether Latvian courts have
properly applied Latvian domestic law” in the present case; the Tribunal is called
upon to determine only whether international law rules and provisions pertinent to this

case were observed properly. '?!?

The Respondent has acted in a predictable and transparent manner;
agreements were performed on a commercial basis in accordance with their terms and
there was no sovereign interference to alter or terminate the terms and conditions of

those agreements.!?!4

The Respondent states that the Claimant has advanced the same arguments before the
Latvian courts and in these proceedings: the Claimant attempts to show in its
Memorial why Latgales Energija did not have to pay for the gas and why the
development plan was the sole responsibility of the Municipality; however, the
documents and/or the facts must be read otherwise.!”!5_ The decisions of the Latvian

271216

courts with respect to the “commercial part” of the “concession agreements’ and

the “public or administrative part” of the licences and other “sovereign decisions”!?!7
clearly show that Latgales Energija’s arguments made in the Latvian proceedings are
essentially the same as the arguments advanced in the Claimant’s Memorial in these
proceedings.''* In the Respondent’s view, there was no apparent or clear disregard
of the facts or the law in violation of the BIT, let alone any intention to harm the

Claimant.'??

The Respondent points out that the Claimant through Latgales Energija selectively
decided which judicial decisions to appeal in the Latvian courts; particularly with
regard to the “concession agreements” and the licences, the Claimant did not appeal
the decision ordering Latgales Energija to pay its outstanding debt for the natural gas
delivered as well as the decisions to suspend the licences and to enforce the “return of

the assets”.!22

The Respondent submits that the whole treatment afforded to the Claimant and

Latgales Energija was reasonable and that they were able to raise all of their

arguments “at all times”; reliance is placed by the Respondent on the award in Arif v.

Moldova!22! 1222

As to the Regulator, the Respondent asserts that it requested performance of the
licence conditions, not of the commercial agreements.'*?* According to the
Respondent, the Claimant was aware of the terms of the licences, in particular, the
obligation to submit regular reports and forecasts, and did not challenge them in court;
the Claimant cannot consider such terms as invalid simply by alleging that the

Respondent did not perform some obligations.

The Respondent further submits that the Claimant had a duty to restructure the
existing business in order to ensure a sustainable supply of heat; that in turn required

the operator to be proactive in submitting information to the State authorities.!?*4

The Respondent contends that the Regulator put Latgales Energija on notice of the
breach of various licence conditions, proceeding gradually from the 4 October 2007
warning, the 11 October 2007 suspension and then the revocation of the licences on 3
June 2008. The revocation of the licences by the Regulator was therefore the ultimate
sanction against Latgales Energija’s repeated failure to comply with the licence
conditions, the most important of which were the failure to provide good-quality
uninterrupted heating services, and Latgales Energija’s refusal to pay the full price of

the natural gas.'275

In the Respondent’s view, Latgales Energija’s argument that the Municipality had to
cover the price difference arising out of an unforeseen rise in the costs of natural gas
was tantamount to saying that the Municipality had to subsidise the Claimant’s

investment; aside from running counter to the basic purpose of inviting private

capital, such a proposition had no basis in the contracts signed by Latgales
Energija.'??6

Finally, the evidence is, according to the Respondent, that it is the Claimant’s or
Mr. Strioga’s common practice to enter into deals having a potential for serious issues
to arise and litigation to take place in due course due to a lack of “precisely defined
tules of cooperation”; reliance is placed by the Respondent on Exhibit R-19
containing a number of press reports by the Lithuanian press and judgments by
Lithuanian authorities.!?”7

(B) | THE RISKS ASSUMED BY THE CLAIMANT VS. THE CLAIMANT’S
LEGITIMATE EXPECTATIONS

The Respondent submits that the investor’s own conduct should be taken into account
to determine the Respondent’s liability under the BIT; reliance is placed on the

awards in Azinian v. United Mexican States,'?8 MTD'?? and Noble Ventures v.

1230 1231

Romania According to the Respondent, these cases all dealt with various

“substantial bad faith conducts by [the] investor itself’ such as improper due

diligence, non-submission of relevant information and “causing the events for
revocation of licence”.!5

The Respondent submits that all these factors are pertinent in the present case.'?*

In the Respondent’s view, a more reasonable and prudent investor than the Claimant
would have considered the risks typically linked to the provision of district heating

services in countries such as Latvia before making the investment. !?*4

In particular, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should have taken into

account the following risks:

(C) CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES

In the alternative, the Respondent submits that there has been no breach of the BIT

due to a change of circumstances. !?44

To that end, the Respondent again makes reference to Article 6:111 of the PECL, in

particular subparagraphs (b) and (c).!"44

The Respondent argues that the Regulator largely based its decision to revoke
Latgales Energija’s licences on Latgales Energija’s failure to procure a “safe,
continuous and reliable” delivery of district heating services in Rézekne.'?45
According to the Respondent, even assuming that Latgales Energija was entitled to
rely on the assumption that there would be permanent and continuous delivery of
natural gas and that it would not have to prepare for emergency measures in case of a
disruption of the delivery of natural gas, Latgales Energija “directly caused and was
responsible for the circumstances that led to the revocation of the [I]icences”.!74°
When it withheld payments to Latvijas Gaze, Latgales Energija should have realized
that Latvijas Gaze was not bound to procure a “safe and sound business” to Latgales
Energija and that Latvijas Gaze could therefore suspend or stop the delivery of natural

as,!247

gi

Such circumstances represent a risk to be addressed by Latgales Energija and which

Latgales Energija was not entitled to shift to the Municipality.'?4*

THE REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON LIABILITY
The Tribunal will deal with the issues in the following order:
(i) the applicable law (see paragraphs 790 ff. below);
(ii) whether the alleged conduct and breaches of the BIT complained of by the
Claimant can be attributed to the Respondent insofar as the Municipality, the

Regulator and the two companies Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija

are concerned (see paragraph 794 ff. below);
(iii) the claim for breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT (see paragraph 831 below);

(iv) _ the claim for expropriation under Article 4(1) of the BIT (see paragraph 1067

below); and

(v) the claim for breach of the MFN under Article 3(2) of the BIT (see paragraph
1102 below).

(dd) APPLICABLE LAW

The Tribunal has decided that the present dispute is an investment dispute within its
jurisdiction according to the provisions of the BIT and the ICSID Convention. As an
ICSID Tribunal it has to turn to the Convention’s provisions in order to determine the

applicable law.
Article 42 of the ICSID Convention reads as follows:

Article 42

qd) The Tribunal shall decide a dispute in accordance with such rules of
law as may be agreed by the parties. In the absence of such agreement,
the Tribunal shall apply the law of the Contracting State party to the
dispute (including its rules on the conflict of laws) and such rules of
international law as may be applicable.

In the Tribunal’s view, acceptance of the offer to arbitrate in Article 7 of the BIT
establishes an implicit agreement that the applicable law consists primarily of the
standards of protection contained in the BIT, but that recourse may be had to general

international law as well as to the domestic law of Latvia.

The Tribunal finally notes that it is not in dispute that (i) Article 1(1) of the BIT refers
to Latvian laws and regulations, (ii) such laws and regulations apply to the actions of
Latvian executive and judicial authorities and (iii) the agreements entered into by
Latgales Energija with the Municipality, Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes Energija
are governed by such laws and regulations. As follows from the preceding paragraph,

the Tribunal considers that it is empowered by Article 42(1) of the ICSID Convention

226

794.

795.

796.

797.

798.

to interpret and apply such laws and regulations in so far as necessary to determine

the dispute that has been referred to it.

(2) THE ISSUE OF ATTRIBUTION

As reflected in Article 2 of the ILC Articles:!7°
Article 2
Elements of an internationally wrongful act of a State

There is an internationally wrongful act of a State when conduct
consisting of an action or omission:

(a) is attributable to the State under international law; and
(b) constitutes a breach of an international obligation of the State.

The issue for the purposes of the present Award is the threshold question whether the
conduct of which the Claimant complains is attributable to the Respondent under
international law. The Tribunal will examine the case of the Municipality, the

Regulator and the two companies Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija.

(A) THE MUNICIPALITY

There can be no doubt—nor did the Respondent appear to contest (see paragraph 750

above)—that the Municipality’s conduct is attributable to the Respondent.
The relevant rule is stated in Article 4 of the ILC Articles:

Article 4
Conduct of organs of a State

1. The conduct of any State organ shall be considered an act of that State
under international law, whether the organ exercises legislative,
executive, judicial or any other functions, whatever position it holds in
the organization of the State, and whatever its character as an organ of
the central Government or of a territorial unit of the State.

2. An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in
accordance with the internal law of the State.

As paragraph 3 of the ILC’s Commentary to that article observes, the rule which it

embodies “has long been recognized in international judicial decisions”.!?°°

249 TLC Articles, CLA-7.

227

799.

800.

801.

802.

Paragraph 6 of the Commentary elaborates that the rule “extends to organs of
government of whatever kind or classification, exercising whatever functions, and at
whatever level in the hierarchy, including those at provincial or even local level”.
The rule therefore encompasses an organ of local government such as the
Municipality, which is given the status of part of the Latvian State by the

Municipalities Act.!?>!

Provided that the acts in question are performed in an official capacity, they are
attributable to the State. There is no dispute that the acts of the Municipality in this

case were performed in an official capacity.

All of the actions of the Municipality at issue in this case are therefore attributable to

the Respondent.

(B) | THEREGULATOR

The Claimant’s allegations concern both the Regulator’s refusal to grant Latgales

6 1252

Energija’s applications for revised tariffs on 13 October 200 and on 11 June

2007,'?°3 as well as its annulment on 7 December 2007!7* of a prior decision to grant

Latgales Energija’s application for revised tariffs'?°°

and ultimately, on 3 June 2008,
its revocation of Latgales Energija’s licences'?*° following the warning of Latgales
Energija on 4 October 2007!’ and the decision to take over Latgales Energija’s zone

on 11 October 2007.17

 

1250 The Commentary is not on the record, but both Parties relied on it in the submissions filed after the
Hearing (Cl. Rep. Tribunal {| 9-11 and Resp. P-H (PO8) { 9). Moreover, during the Hearing
Mr. Wordsworth invited them to comment on a passage in that commentary (paragraph 6 on Art. 8)
(Transcript, Day 4, 79/23-25; 80/1-15) and in the submissions to be filed after the Hearing (Transcript,
Day 4, 125/7-18). Further to that request the Parties briefly referred to that commentary during the
Hearing (Transcript, Day 4, 91/21-25; 92/1-10 for the Claimant; Day 4, 179/7-13 for the Respondent).

The arguments as to the attribution of this conduct were not well developed on either

side.

Nonetheless, the material which has been put before the Tribunal readily

justifies the conclusion that such conduct is attributable to the Respondent.

In the Tribunal’s view, the nature of the Regulator as a State organ as understood

under Article 4 of the ILC Articles may be inferred from provisions of the Public

Utilities Regulators Act which contain a number of relevant indications:

@

(ii)

(iii)

(iv)

whether the Regulator is a central body or is part of local government, it must
“operate independently and autonomously” in performing the functions
determined by the Public Utilities Regulators Act “when taking decisions and
issuing administrative acts in order to protect the interests of users and to
promote the development of providers of public utilities in accordance with
the principles of justice, transparency, neutrality, equality and

proportionality”; !2?

exceptions apart, a body such as the Regulator bound to act in accordance with
the “principles of justice” may be presumed to be a State organ, and the
further principles mentioned by Section 5 of the same Act are simply general

principles of administrative law recognized in most jurisdictions;

the Regulator’s individual decisions are in the nature of administrative acts

“binding upon specific providers and users of public utilities”;!?®° and

both an administrative act or an actual action of the Regulator may be

challenged before an Administrative Regional. '2°!

To the extent that the acts of the Regulator were not attributable to the Respondent

under Article 4 of the ILC Articles, they would be attributable as a matter of Article 5.

Article 5 of the ILC Articles reads as follows:

1259

1260

 

Article 5
Conduct of persons or entities exercising elements of governmental authority

ection 5, see also Sections 7(2), 11(1).

 

Sections 6(1), 7(3).

1261 CLA-49, Section 11(4).

229

806.

807.

808.

809.

The conduct of a person or entity which is not an organ of the State
under article 4 but which is empowered by the law of that State to exercise
elements of the governmental authority shall be considered an act of the State
under international law, provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in
the particular instance.

Like Article 4, Article 5 of the ILC Articles merely codifies a well-established rule of

international law.

There are thus three aspects to the analysis:

@ the Regulator must have exercised elements of governmental authority;
(ii) it must have been empowered by the Respondent’s law to do so; and

(iii) ‘it was acting in that capacity in regulating tari

 

and granting or revoking

licences.

As to the first aspect, paragraph 6 of the commentary to Article 5 of the ILC Articles
explains:

Article 5 does not attempt to identify precisely the scope of “governmental

authority” for the purpose of attribution of the conduct of an entity to the State.

Beyond a certain limit, what is regarded as “governmental” depends on the

particular society, its history and traditions. Of particular importance will be not

just the content of the powers, but the way they are conferred on an entity, the

purposes for which they are to be exercised and the extent to which the entity is

accountable to government for their exercise. These are essentially questions of

the application of a general standard to varied circumstances. The conduct of a

person or entity which is not an organ of the State under article 4 but which is

empowered by the law of that State to exercise elements of the governmental

authority shall be considered an act of the State under international law,

provided the person or entity is acting in that capacity in the particular instance.
Article 5 thus directs the Tribunal to consider a range of factors, each of which may
be relevant to differing extents. But in this case the Respondent accepted (indeed,
insisted) that the Regulator’s function relating to its decisions, including as to
licences, was of a public nature, financed solely from fees levied from utility
companies.!*°? There can be little doubt that it was the exercise of an element of
governmental authority as classically understood. The same can be said of the
Regulator’s function of approving the tariffs applicable to the licenced activity. It is

also notable that, as the Respondent points out, the Regulator’s decisions were subject

128 Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. {ff 3.7-3.8; see also CLA-49, Section 29.

230

810.

811.

812.

813.

814.

to review in the administrative rather than civil courts.'

Both the licensing and
tariff-approval functions were therefore the exercise of an element of governmental

authority.

As to the second aspect of the analysis, the Regulator was empowered to exercise that
function by statutory authority, in the form of the Public Utilities Regulators Act. The
manner of that empowerment only reinforces the conclusion that the Regulator was an

entity exercising an element of governmental authority.

As to the third aspect, since all of the Regulator’s actions at issue in this case
concerned the exercise of that authority, the Tribunal concludes that they are

attributable to the Respondent.

(C) | THE COMPANIES REZEKNES SILTUMTIKLI AND REZEKNES ENERGUA

The Claimant founds its case to a limited degree on the conduct of Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija, both of which are wholly owned by the
Municipality: in particular, on Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s bringing a civil suit against
Latgales Energija on 20 September 2007 which resulted in a freezing order being
granted against Latgales Energija the following day, and on a further suit by Rézeknes
Energija brought on 27 December 2007 to the same effect. The Claimant’s case, put
broadly, is that these litigations were orchestrated by the Municipality to further its

aim of removing Latgales Energija from the supply of heating to Rézekne.

The question of the attribution of these actions is more complex than that of the acts
of the Municipality and the Regulator. Accordingly, by Procedural Order No. 8 the
Tribunal invited the Parties to file “a short submission on the question whether acts by
Rézeknes Siltumtikli and/or Rézeknes Energija [were] attributable to the

Respondent”.

The Claimant submits that the actions of Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes Energija

were attributable to the Respondent on three bases:!7°+

128 See e.g, C-14; Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. 43.7.
264 C], Rep. Tribunal {1 8 ff.

231

815.

816.

817.

818.

@ Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes Energija exercised delegated
governmental authority, in the form of delegated authority to run the district

heating system, thereby falling within Article 5 of the ILC Articles;

(ii) Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes Energija exercised delegated
administrative or governmental authority, thereby falling within Article
2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT, imported into the BIT by the MEN provision in
Article 3(2) of the Lithuania-Latvia BIT; and

(iii) Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija acted under the control and
direction of the Municipality, thereby falling within Article 8 of the ILC

Articles.

In its Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent denies that Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s and
Rézeknes Energija’s actions were attributable to it on the basis of either Article 5 or

Article 8 of the ILC Articles.!7°

(i) Article 5 of the ILC Articles

The short answer to this argument appears to be that, even if Rézeknes Siltumtikli and
Rézeknes Energija had been empowered to exercise any element of governmental
authority, they were not exercising such authority “in the particular instance”, as

Article 5 requires.

As the Respondent observes, both litigations were brought in the civil courts, on the
basis of purely commercial agreements.'7 As a matter of first principles — and

contrary to the Claimant’s contention!

— the mere fact that the Municipality was
responsible for organising district heating is not enough to transform the consequent
provision of such heating (whether by private or semi-private entities) into an exercise

of governmental authority.
(ii) = MFN in Article 3(2) of the BIT

The next strand of the Claimant’s case is as follows:

"265 Resp. P-H (PO8) if 7 ff.
126 Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem. 5.
287 See e.g. Cl. Rep. 18.

232

819.

820.

821.

822.

@ Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s and Rézeknes Energija’s conduct would be attributable

to the Respondent under article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT; and

(ii) by virtue of the MEN provision in article 3(2) of the (Lithuania-Latvia) BIT,
the Claimant is entitled to have its claim determined by reference to that

provision of the US-Latvia BIT.
Article 2(2)(b) of the US-Latvia BIT!?°* provides:

Article II
2.

a.(...)

b. Each Party shall ensure that any state enterprise that it maintains or
establishes acts in a manner that is not inconsistent with the Party’s obligations
under this Treaty wherever such enterprise exercises any regulatory,
administrative or other governmental authority that the Party has delegated to it,
the power to expropriate, grant licenses, approve commercial
transactions, or impose quotas, fees or other charges.

 

It appears doubtful that this provision adds anything to the Claimant’s case on Article
5 of the ILC Articles. Even if “regulatory” or “administrative” authority were in
isolation capable of bearing a broader meaning than “governmental authority”, it
appears from the use of “other” that those terms are to be read eiusdem generis with
“governmental authority” as generally understood. Further, although the list of
examples of such authority which follows is merely illustrative, it appears to leave
little scope to suppose that the terms were intended to bear a broader meaning than the

“governmental authority” referred to in Article 5 of the ILC Articles.

For the same reasons discussed above in relation to Article 5 of the ILC Articles, there
appears to be nothing to establish that either Rézeknes Siltumtikli or Rézeknes
Energija was exercising any such authority when it engaged in the conduct at issue.
Article 2(2)(b) of the US—Latvia BIT would therefore appear inapplicable on the

current facts.

On this basis, it would be unnecessary to reach a view on whether the MFN provision

in the BIT is capable in principle of applying in the present case.

1268 US-Latvia BIT, CLA-25.

233

(iii) Article 8 of the ILC Articles

823. The final

 

ue is whether Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s and Rézeknes Energija’s conduct is
attributable to the Respondent under the test expressed in Article 8 of the ILC
Articles.'2 This provides:
Article 8
Conduct directed or controlled by a State
The conduct of a person or group of persons shall be considered an act of a State
under international law if the person or group of persons is in fact acting on the

instructions of, or under the direction or control of, that State in carrying out the
conduct.

  

824. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Commentary to that article are pertinent enough to be worth

quoting in full:

 
 
  
 

Questions arise with respect to the conduct of companies or enterpri:
are Stat dan If such ions act

international obligations of the State concerned the question ari:
conduct is attributable to the State. In discu: i
recall that international law acknowledges the general separatene:
entities at the national level, except in those cases where the “corporate veil” is a
mere device or a vehicle for fraud or evasion. The fact that the State initially
establishes a corporate entity, whether by a special law or otherwise, is not a
sufficient basis for the attribution to the State of the subsequent conduct of that
entity. Since corporate entities, although owned by and in that sense subject to
the control of the State, are considered to be separate, prima facie their conduct
in carrying out their activities is not attributable to the State unless they are
exercising elements of governmental authority within the meaning of article 5.
This was the position taken, for example, in relation to the de facto seizure of
property by a State-owned oil company, in a case where there was no proof that
the State used its ownership interest as a vehicle for directing the company to
seize the property. On the other hand, where there was evidence that the
corporation was exercising public powers, or that the State was using its
ownership interest in or control of a corporation specifically in order to achieve
a particular result, the conduct in question has been attributed to the State.

 

 

 

It is clear then that a State may, either by specific directions or by exercising
control over a group, in effect assume responsibility for their conduct. Each case
will depend on its own facts, in particular those concerning the relationship
between the instructions given or the direction or control exercised and the
specific conduct complained of. In the text of article 8, the three terms
“instructions”, “direction” and “control” are disjunctive; it is sufficient to
establish any one of them. At the same time it is made clear that the instructions,
direction or control must relate to the conduct which is said to have amounted to
an internationally wrongful act.

825. It is therefore clear that it is not enough to meet the test set out in Article 8 of the ILC

Articles that Rézeknes Siltumtitkli and Rézeknes Energija were State-owned. Nor is it

1269 ILC Articles, CLA-7.

234

826.

827.

828.

enough that they may in general have been subject to the Municipality’s control (as
the Claimant argued in its closing submissions). Rather, the specific question to be
addressed in this case is whether the Respondent instructed, directed or controlled
Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s or Rézeknes Energija’s bringing of the litigation which

resulted in Latgales Energija’s bank accounts being frozen.

There is a dearth of direct evidence as to any such instruction, direction or control in
this case. That is partly a consequence of the Respondent’s failure to tender any
witnesses of fact for cross-examination and partly a consequence of the fact that the
Respondent produced only few documents further to Procedural Order No. 4.'27° As
to the Claimant’s allegation that the Municipality directed the companies’ actions, the

Respondent says that the suggestion is “at the best, worth a big and healthy smile”.!?7!

The Tribunal finds that there is, however, a body of circumstantial evidence which,
taken as a whole, permits the inference that the Municipality (as an organ of the
Respondent) must have instructed Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes Energija to
bring the claims against Latgales Energija and must have instructed Rézeknes

Siltumtikli not to comply with the October 2007 Agreement.

The evidence giving rise to such an inference so far as Rézeknes Siltumttkli is

concerned is as follows:

@ although the Municipality’s sole ownership of the companies is not by itself
sufficient to found an inference of direction, it is a significant background

factor;

(ii) against that background is to be considered the newspaper interview given by

the Mayor of the Municipality (Mr. Vjakse) on 13 September 2007. Among

the key points emerging from the interview were these:!2”*

12% Tn Procedural Order No. 8 the Tribunal ordered the Respondent to state whether there were any
documents responsive to the Claimant’s requests for production granted by the Tribunal in Procedural
Order No. 4 and, further to a renewed verification of its files, to produce any responsive documents by
20 March 2015.

— the Municipality or the mayor himself had been in private negotiations “for

  

three months” to identify “alternatives” to Latgales Energi

— Latgales Energija’s future as an operator in Rézekne was said to depend on

whether it paid Latvijas Gaze;

— despite that, the Mayor stated unconditionally that “[W]e will announce a

tender and choose a company that would meet our requirements”; and

— the Mayor also stated, “the future of Latgales energija in our city will be
decided on 25 September. By this date, the regular payment for the gas should
be paid, and in case Latgales energija fails to pay it, then I would bring a
question to deputies regarding termination of the agreement with this

company”;

shortly before the interview, and following the Mayor’s alleged private
negotiations with Latgales Energija’s competitors, the Municipality-owned
Rézeknes Siltumtikli had (absent any other explanation for its timing)!?”
decided to bring the civil claim against Latgales Energija on 20 September
2007 seeking an attachment which was granted on 21 September 2007!?”4 and

which prevented Latgales Energija from being able to pay Latvijas Gaze;

on the same day, the Municipality adopted a Development Plan;'?”°

the name of Latgales Energija which featured in the draft was deleted and
replaced by the word “operator” further to the suggestions made by
representatives of the City Council during two meetings of the Working Group

in the absence of Latgales Energija (see paragraphs 224 and 227 above); and

finally, it is significant that when the lifting of the attachment of Latgales
Energija’s bank account was agreed upon as a measure to be taken as a matter

of urgency pursuant to the October 2007 Agreement (see paragraph 287

1273 ‘The bulk of the sum claimed was represented by amounts allegedly owed for depreciation of assets
and the dispute between Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Latgales Energija in this respect went back to the
previous year (see paragraphs 193 ff. above).

one of the parties privy to that agreement, and not only by Rézeknes
Siltumtikli;!?”° this could only mean that the City Council would be bound to

give Rézeknes Siltumtikli any directions as may be required.

The sequence of events which followed suggests an intention on the Municipality’s

part then to use Rézeknes Energija as an instrument in connection with Latgales

Energija’s removal, which culminated in Rézeknes Energija’s bringing its claim for a

freezing order against Latgales Energija on 27 December 2007:

at a meeting the same day attended by the Mayor, representatives of Latgales
Energija, and representatives of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija,
the Mayor made the following, telling remark: “In the light of the crisis
situation, in the name of the new company [i.e. Rézeknes Energija], we are
claiming that before 14 October, 6-00 P.M. [Latgales Energija] to deliver the
service activity area and to ensure that the people from Rézeknes Energija can
start fulfilment of the obligations as defined by the Regulator and the

[Municipality]”.!?°

These facts are sufficient in order for the Tribunal to conclude, on the balance of

probabilities, that the Respondent did direct Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes

Energija to bring their respective claims against Latgales Energija. In reaching such a

conclusion, the Tribunal takes into account the Respondent’s failure to offer any

witness of fact for cross-examination on this point.

CLAIMS FOR BREACH OF ARTICLE 3(1) OF THE TREATY (FAIR AND
EQUITABLE TREATMENT, FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY; NO
ARBITRARY OR DISCRIMINATORY MEASURES WITH RESPECT TO THE
INVESTMENT)

Article 3(1) of the BIT reads as follows:

Article 3
Protection and Treatment of Investments

1. Each Contracting Party shall at all times ensure fair and equitable
treatment of the investments made by investors of the other Contracting
Party as well as their full security and protection in its territory.

Neither Contracting Party shall by arbitrary or discriminatory measures
impair the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of

investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party.

(A) THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF TREATMENT

Fair and equitable treatment is the first standard of investment protection mentioned

in the first sub-paragraph of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

1282

C-147, page 12 (emphasis supplied).

238

833.

834.

835.

There has been considerable debate as to the content of this standard, including as to
whether it confers protection going beyond the minimum standard of treatment

required as a matter of customary international law.

The Tribunal considers that, as is now recognized in multiple awards, the standard is
concerned with “[p]rotection of legitimate expectations (...); [g]ood faith (...) [and]
[t]ransparency, consistency, non-discrimination”, as was noted by the Biwater Gauff

tribunal. !?83

In Saluka the tribunal concluded on the standard of fair and equitable
treatment as follows: “A foreign investor whose interests are protected under the
Treaty is entitled to expect that the Czech Republic will not act in a way that is
manifestly inconsistent, non-transparent, unreasonable (i.e. unrelated to some rational
policy) or discriminatory (i.e. based on unjustifiable distinctions)”.'?*+ Although
made in the specific context of NAFTA, the views expressed by the Waste
Management tribunal have been influential, and have frequently been referred to both
with respect to NAFTA claims and claims under treaties that refer solely to an
obligation to accord fair and equitable treatment, i.e. without any reference to the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment. That tribunal stated that
the NAFTA standard of fair and equitable treatment is breached

(...) by conduct attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant if the

conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and

exp the claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a lack of due

process leading to an outcome which offends judicial propriety — as might be the

case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial proceedings or a

complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative proces In

applying that standard it is relevant that the treatment is in breach of

representations made by the host State which were reasonably relied on by the
claimant.!?85

 

 

One important element of the standard of fair and equitable treatment is the protection
of the investor’s legitimate expectations. The Tribunal considers, in line with the
views expressed by various other tribunals, that for the investor’s expectations to be

protected by the standard of fair and equitable treatment:

83 Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, CLA-36 { 602.
128 Saluka v. Czech Republic, CLA-21 { 309.
"285 Waste Management v. Mexico, CLA-15 98.

239

836.

837.

@ the investor’s expectations must be “legitimate”;'?®° indeed “reasonable and

legitimate”; !7°”

(ii) more is required than a “basic expectation”, as has been referred to in various

cases, including Biwater Gauff;'?8

(iii) there must have been reliance by the investor with respect to making the

investment;!2°? and

(iv) that reliance must be reasonable.!”°

Whereas stability and predictability of the legal environment have been regarded as
concrete renderings of the fair and equitable treatment standard in a number of
decisions,'”°! these cannot be absolute requirements, and have often been weighed
against further criteria, and most notably the right of the host State to exercise its
general legislative power and enforce laws and regulations to protect the public
interest. Thus, the Saluka tribunal noted that “[nJo investor may reasonably expect
that the circumstances prevailing at the time the investment is made remain totally
unchanged”;!?? the E/ Paso tribunal went a step further, holding that it was unable to
follow the line of cases in which fair and equitable treatment had been viewed as
implying the stability of the legal and business framework.!?°?

The Tribunal considers that reasonableness on the part of the investor in relying on
representations by the State means inter alia that it is a matter for the investor to
evaluate the risk inherent in the proposed investment taking into account all relevant
circumstances; investment tribunals have held that the investor would in principle

have to take the consequences following from its own failure in this respect.!2°*

Moreover, the breach by a State of a representation made in a contract may not suffice
to give rise to a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment since a
distinction must be made between pure contract claims and treaty claims. The
Tribunal considers that, as a general rule, a breach of contract is unlikely on its own to
amount to a breach of the standard of fair and equitable treatment, and the State would

have to have acted in its sovereign capacity.'?%°

Good faith is generally regarded as a fundamental part of the fair and equitable
standard of protection. The Tribunal considers that a breach of good faith does not
require proof of an intention to harm the investment or the investor,'?°° but such an
intention or motive, if found to exist, may be relevant.'2°7 The Tribunal considers that
the following finding by the Saluka tribunal is of assistance: the host State is required
to implement its policies

(...) bona fide by conduct that is, as far as it affects the investors’ investment,

reasonably justifiable by public policies and that such conduct does not

manifestly violate the requirements of consistency, transparency, even-

handedness and non-discrimination. In particular, any differential treatment of a

foreign investor must not be based on unreasonable distinctions and demands,

and must be justified by showing that it bears a reasonable relationship to

rational policies not motivated by a preference for other investments over the

foreign-owned investment.!7°*
Full protection and security is the second standard of investment protection mentioned
in the first sub-paragraph of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal considers that the
standard of full protection and security seeks specifically to protect the physical
integrity of the investment against the use of force.' Full protection and security
does not provide for strict liability,'*° but rather requires the host State to exercise
due diligence in the treatment of the investment.'*°! The Tribunal notes that certain
decisions have held that the standard did not protect only the physical integrity of the

investment, but had a broader scope which includes the investor’s rights.!°°? The

Biwater Gauff tribunal mentioned the stability of the investor’s environment,

including the commercial and legal environment.!°?

The protection against arbitrary and discriminatory measures which impair the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of investments is the third
standard of investment protection established in Article 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal
considers that a measure may be characterized as arbitrary if it is “founded on

1304 or constitutes a “willful

prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact
disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of
juridical propriety”.!°°5 The Tribunal considers that a measure which is arbitrary or
discriminatory is likely also to violate the fair and equitable treatment standard
considering the elements of the fair and equitable treatment set out above (see
paragraphs 832 and 834 above). For there to be a breach of this limb of Article 3(1),
there must be not only one or more arbitrary or discriminatory measures but also
impairment to the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of an
investment. This is a familiar formulation, but the Tribunal nonetheless notes the

broad scope of what is prohibited in terms of impairment.

(B) | WHETHER THE RESPONDENT IS IN BREACH OF ARTICLE 3(1) OF THE BIT

The Tribunal will examine (i) the claim rested on a breach of the Claimant’s
expectations based on the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraphs 844 ff. below), (ii)
the claim based on the Municipality’s delay in approving the heat supply development
plan for the City (see paragraphs 855 ff. below), (iii) the claim based on the
Municipality’s refusal to consent to the Claimant’s investments in the heating system
(see paragraphs 888 ff. below), (iv) the claims based on the Regulator’s refusal to set
a new tariff (see paragraphs 899 ff. below), (v) the claims based on the Municipality’s
and the Regulator’s conduct in connection with the energy crisis (see paragraphs 923
ff. below), the claims based on the Regulator’s warning and the revocation of the
licences by the Regulator (see paragraphs 988 ff. below) and the claims based on the
Municipality’s conduct subsequent to the revocation of the licences (see paragraphs
1028 ff. below). The Tribunal will finally consider the cumulative effect of the
1303 Biwater Gauff v. Tanzania, CLA-36 | 729.

measures taken by the Regulator and the Municipality (see paragraphs 1060 ff.

below).

The Tribunal’s finding on whether the Respondent acted in breach of Article 3(1) of

the BIT is set out in paragraph 1066 below.

(i) The Claim Rested on a Breach by the Respondent of the
Claimant's Expectations Based on the Long-Term Agreement
The Claimant relies on a number of expectations, and most notably the expectation
that Latgales Energija would recover the investment made by the Claimant and earn a
profit as provided in the Long-Term Agreement (see paragraph 675 above). The

Tribunal dismisses this claim.

The Claimant emphasised, in replying to the Respondent’s arguments, that its claims

are Treaty claims, '*°°

pointing out that the rights asserted in these arbitration
proceedings are not “mere contractual claims” and are distinct from the claims
asserted by Latgales Energija in the Latvian courts based on the contracts or the

licences. !3°7

The Tribunal finds that its role is to determine whether the Claimant is entitled to
assert a claim for breach of the standards of protection in Article 3(1) of the BIT, not
whether it is liable in contract under the terms of the Long-Term Agreement.
However, the claim that Latgales Energija would be entitled to use the assets, create
new assets and make a profit as provided by the Long-Term Agreement is in
substance a contractual claim brought under the veil of a breach of the investor’s

legitimate expectations.

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent did not, in particular, guarantee the
profitability of the investment under Article 3(1) of the BIT; neither did the terms of
the Long-Term Agreement for that matter, contrary to the Claimant’s submission.
The Claimant could not therefore reasonably have such an expectation when the

Long-Term Agreement was made on 28 January 2005.

Investment tribunals have consistently found that BITs are not an insurance against

business risks. 3%

In the present case the Claimant, a company active inter alia in the heating business,
was aware of certain risks inherent in the investment and must be deemed to have
assumed them unless they were expressly excluded; its investment in Latvia related to
activities which the Claimant has been carrying out in its own country according to
the representations made to the Respondent.'*°? Whereas both Lithuania and Latvia
had gradually embraced a system of market economy after regaining independence in
the early 1990s, the privatization of district heating utilities was a new page of history
for the City of Rézekne when the Claimant decided to invest there, as contended by
the Respondent. When the Claimant summarised the current position of the heating
system in Rézekne in the PowerPoint presentation made to the Municipality on 25
November 2004, it identified by the same token some of the specific risks possibly
affecting the profitability of the investment under consideration, in particular the fact
that the infrastructure would have to be replaced and a change in the type of fuel had

to be introduced. '3!°

The Claimant has provided no precise answer to the Respondent’s allegation that its
due diligence was at best insufficient and its decision to invest “overconfident”; when
asked whether any due diligence had been made to assess the legal, financial and
technical risks, Mr. Strioga answered that his company had hired local lawyers to
obtain advice on Latvian law, but he could not remember whether any due diligence
report had been received.'*!! The Tribunal notes that due diligence by the Claimant
was contemplated as a possible condition precedent to the entry into force of the

February 2005 Agreement by Clause 5 of the same agreement.'?!?

Moreover, the Claimant does not contend that it received any specific assurances by

the Latvian authorities regarding the review of the tariff. The Regulator’s and the

Municipality’s conduct in relation to the tariffs proposed by Latgales Energija in 2006

and 2007 will be examined in due course (see paragraphs 899 ff. below).

Certain specific complaints made by the Claimant are dealt with in the following
sections of the present Award: (i) the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the
Claimant’s legitimate expectation that the Regulator would not depart from its 2005
practice is dealt with in paragraphs 910 ff. below; (ii) the complaint that the
Respondent disappointed the Claimant’s legitimate expectation that the Municipality
would pay for the natural gas is dealt with in paragraphs 925 ff. below; (iii) the
complaint that the interview given by the Mayor and the Municipality’s attempts to
attract a new operator in the summer of 2007 disappointed the Clamant’s legitimate
expectation that the Municipality would not actively seek to replace Latgales Energija
is dealt with in paragraphs 938 ff. below; (iv) the complaint that the Respondent
disappointed the Claimant’s expectations that the Municipality would not actively
prevent Latgales Energija from operating its business and would comply with the
undertaking to have the attachment lifted is dealt with in paragraphs 950 ff. below; (v)
the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the Claimant’s legitimate expectation
that Latgales Energija would be able to use the assets for the production, transmission
and distribution of thermal energy for 30 years is dealt with in paragraph 1044 below;
(vi) the complaint that the Respondent disappointed the Claimant’s legitimate
expectation that Latgales Energija would not be required to hand over the leased

assets to Municipality-owned companies is dealt with in paragraph 1048 below.

Finally and in any event, the Tribunal considers that the expectations relied upon by
the Claimant (see paragraph 675 above) relate to mere contractual obligations'?'?
and/or represent in essence an alternative way to plead arbitrary conduct or conduct

h.3" Insofar as the Claimant has relied on mere contractual

contrary to good fait!
obligations, such complaints must be dismissed for the reason set out in paragraph
846 above. Insofar as the Claimant has presented other alleged breaches of Article
3(1) of the BIT clothed as breaches of the investor’s legitimate expectations, such

attempts must fail under the heading of a breach of the investor’s legitimate

expectations; the Tribunal will examine the substance of the complaint and determine
whether the Respondent has acted in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in the

following sections of the present Award.
The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this claim.

(ii) The Claim Based on Delay by the Municipality in the Adoption
of a Heat Supply Development Plan for the City of Rézekne

The Claimant claims that the delay by the Municipality in the adoption of a heat
supply development plan for the City is a breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard, both per se and because the non-existence of such a plan caused the
Regulator to deny Latgales Energija’s applications for a new tariff in 2006 and 2007;
the Claimant further contends that the Regulator’s and the Municipality’s conduct
amount to an abuse of power amounting to arbitrary measures that resulted in its
investment being irreparably impaired. The Tribunal will examine only the delay
claim in this section; the Regulator’s decisions will be examined in the following sub-
section of this Award (see paragraph 899 below). The Respondent alleges that the
delay was caused by the Claimant’s failure to prepare a proper draft for the heat
supply development plan with due dispatch and the Claimant’s refusal to provide

relevant information to the Municipality as to the planned investments.
The issues arising for determination are as follows:

@ Whose duty was it to establish and adopt a heat supply development plan for

the City of Rézekne as a matter of Latvian law?

(ii) Was there any delay in the establishment and adoption of such plan that is

attributable to the Municipality?

(iii) ‘If a finding of delay is made, does such delay on the part of the Municipality
amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT?

The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 887 below.

The Claimant contends in these arbitration proceedings that the establishment and

approval of a heat supply development plan for the City of Rézekne was the duty of

246

858.

859.

the Municipality, whereas the Respondent submits that such duty was delegated by

the Municipality to Latgales Energija.

The Tribunal finds that it was the duty of the Municipality to prepare and approve a
heat supply development plan for the City of Rézekne; Latgales Energija had a duty to
cooperate and provide the information required, as contemplated by the February

2006 Agreement, in order that the heat supply development plan be complete.

The regulatory context consists of the following enactments: the Energy Act,'>'> the
Municipalities Act,'*'® the Public Utility Regulators Act!?!” and the Methodology for
Calculation of Tariffs for Public Utilities in the Fields Regulated by Local

Municipalities!?!*

enacted pursuant to the Public Utility Regulators Act. The Public
Administration Act'*!? contains provisions relevant to the issue of delegation. The

provisions of these enactments relevant for present purposes are as follows:

@ Section 51 of the Energy Act,'*?° as it was in force when the Long-Term
Agreement and the February 2005 Agreements were made, provided that the
Municipality had to determine the development of heating supply.'*?! The
Respondent has not contested the application of this particular provision.
Neither Party has contended that the change in the subsequent versions of

Section 51(2) of the Act from the expression “Local governments (...)

CLA-48, see paragraph 38 above. The provisions of the Energy Act relevant for present purposes
cover the licensing of energy supply merchants (Sections 5 ff.), the natural gas supply sytem (Sections 41
ff), the heating supply system (Sections 46 ff.), increase of energy efficiency (Sections 53 ff.) and energy
crisis (Sections 59 ff.).

 

'321' Section 51 of the Energy Act reads as follows:
qd) Local governments, when performing their permanent functions as
prescribed by law, shall organise heating supply in the administrative
territory thereof, as well as promote competition in the heating supply
and fuel market.

(2) Local governments, within the scope of the development plan of their
administrative territory, determine the development of heating supply

and coordinate it with regulator taking into account the provisions of

the I ion and the ion of cultural

as well as the possibilities to use local energy resources and evaluating

the safety of heating supply and long-term marginal costs.

determine (...)” to the expression “Local governments (...) may determine

(...)” has any particular consequences in the present case.!77

Section 14(2)(1) of the Municipalities Act'*?? provides that in order to perform
their functions, local governments have “the duty” to prepare a development
programme for the territory of the relevant local government and to ensure the
implementation of the territorial development plan. Section 15(1) further
specifies the functions of local governments, the first item of which is “to
organise for residents the provision of utilities (water supply and sewerage;

supply of heat (...)) irrespective of the ownership of the private property”.

Section 16(6) of the Public Utility Regulators Act!*** provides that the
“Municipal regulator, issuing the licence to the public service provider shall
take into account the development plans for the administrative territory of
relevant municipality in the context of the development of regulated sectors as

well as the regulations of the municipality”.

The Methodology’ deals with the the calculation of the thermal energy
tariffs (Clauses 3 ff.). Clause 17 provides that the forecasted thermal energy
consumption balance shall be drawn up “in accordance with the heat supply
system development plan (concept) of the corresponding local government”.
Clause 23.3 provides that “[e]fficiency changes in the boiler room (Dhk.) are
determined based on the investments used for this purpose in accordance with
the approved heat supply system development plan of the corresponding local
government”. Clause 27 refers to the same plan in relation to the necessary

investment.

The licences granted to Latgales Energija and the contracts signed by the Municipality

and its wholly-owned companies with Latgales Energija mention more than one type

of development plan.

@ The licences mention “the development plan of the City of Rézekne” in
Clause 1 (see paragraph 132 above); then in Clause 7.1 they mention “the
long-term development plan of SIA “Latgales Energija’”” (see paragraph 133
above). These provisions point to the existence of two different plans, one

issued by the Municipality for the City of Rézekne, another by the operator.

The clear language of the licences shows that one is therefore dealing with two
distinct concepts of a long-term development plan. The Parties’ submissions

have not taken that distinction into account until after the Hearing.

The Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences refers to Clause 7
of the licences and states that the long-term development plan mentioned
therein is “the company’s long-term development plan”.'*?° This is clearly a
plan other than “the development plan of the City of Rézekne” mentioned in

Clause 1 of the licences.

(ii) The February 2005 Agreement contains no mention of any development plan
of any kind. The February 2006 Agreement contains an express term in
Clause 1.2 (see the verbatim quotation in paragraph 171 footnote 163 above).
Under this provision it was the Council’s duty “to coordinate and approve the
guidelines for development of heating supply system of the city of Rézekne

prepared by the operator and the Council”.

It is common ground between the Parties that despite the use of the word
“guidelines” this expression refers to the heat supply development plan for the
City contemplated by the provisions mentioned above of the Public Utility

Regulators Act and the Methodology.

There is no doubt that it was the responsibility of the Rézekne City Council to prepare
a development plan for the City of Rézekne. When the Long-Term Agreement and
the February 2005 Agreement were entered into by Latgales Energija, no such plan
was in existence and the Rézekne City Council had therefore a general duty to act, as
confirmed by the Regulator’s letter of 12 October 2005 to the Rézekne City Council

enquiring into whether there was “an effective and coordinated development plan of

the city heating supply containing planned and already made investments of ‘Latgales
>> 1327

Energija’ Ltd. in development and improvement of the city heating supply’
The Claimant would have been entitled to make its decision to invest in Rézekne
conditional upon the adoption of such a plan, but it did not. The failure to do so is a

risk undertaken by the Claimant, as pointed out by the Respondent.

However, the position fundamentally changed in 2006 when the Municipality and
Latgales Energija executed the February 2006 Agreement.'*?8 Under Clause 1.2 of
the February 2006 Agreement (see the verbatim quotation in paragraph 171 footnote
163 above) the Rézekne City Council undertook a duty to coordinate and approve
such plan and Latgales Energija undertook to cooperate in good faith with the Council
because Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement must be read against the
background of the general principle of Latvian law whereby contracts are to be

performed in good faith.!7?°

It is in dispute between the Parties whether the main duty to provide a heat
development plan for the City of Rézekne lay on the City Council or Latgales
Energija; the Respondent has contended at the Hearing that such a duty had been
delegated to Latgales Energija in accordance with Section 15(3) of the Municipalities

The Tribunal finds that the Rézekne City Council did not delegate the task to prepare,
coordinate, let alone approve, the heat supply development plan for the City of

Rézekne to Latgales Energija.

First, the Respondent has failed to show that the requirements of Section 40 and
Section 41 of the Public Administration Act were met, and that there was any
enactment or contract that provided for such delegation. Clause 1.2 of the February
2006 Agreement (quoted in paragraph 171 footnote 163 above) did not delegate this
task to Latgales Energija. Neither did the licences, since all licences expressly refer to
“the development plan of the City of Rézekne” in Clause 1 (see paragraph 132 above)
and then refer to a different document to be prepared by Latgales Energija in Clause
7.1 (see the verbatim quotation in paragraph 133 above), as a comparison between

Clause 1 and Clause 7.1 shows.

Secondly, the conduct of the Rézekne City Council from 2006 onwards can be
consistent only with the proposition that the Council had not delegated to Latgales

Energija the task to prepare the heat supply development plan for the City; had there

(3) Administration tasks may be delegated to another public person in
cases laid down in law. In such case, the provisions of this Chapter

Section 41. Subject-matter of Delegation

qd) A public person may delegate administration tasks, the performance of
which is in the competence of such public person or its institution.
When delegating administration tasks, the relevant public person shall
be responsible for the performance of the function as a whole.

(2) The following administration tasks may not be delegated:

1) sectoral policy-making and development planning;

2) co-ordination of the activities of the sector;

3) supervision of institutions and administrative officials;

4) approval of the budget of public persons, distribution of financial
resources at the level of programmes and sub-programmes, and
control of financial resources.

(3) In addition to that referred to in Paragraph two of this Section the

for in an external regulatory enactment;

2) administration tasks related to the performance of the functions of
the external and internal security of the State, except cases when it
is provided for in law;

3) other administration tasks, which by their nature may be performed
only by State institutions.

been such a delegation in place, the Council would not have seen the need for a

number of the actions that it took.

When Latgales Energija on 15 November 2006 sent the Council its 44-page draft!
as a contribution to the preparation of the heat supply development plan, this text

contained a sentence suggesting that the performance of certain Municipality

1334

functions had been delegated to Latgales Energija; the Council reacted to the

point, denying that it had ever transferred any heat supply functions to Latgales
Energija.'?*°
Then some six months later the Rézekne City Council set up a Working Group to

1336

produce the heat supply development plan for the City. It is relevant in this

context that the Working Group was set up by a formal decision of the Rézekne City

Council and was presided over by Mr. Ivars Locis, the Council’s Deputy Executive

Director. !357

It is finally also relevant that the heat supply development plan for the City was
formally adopted by a decision of the Rézekne City Council on 21 September
2007.1338

333 R31,

'8§ R-31 [page 5]: “Considering that based on the agreement regarding lease of the local government
heat supply systems entered into with the Rézekne City Council and the reference included therein
regarding the duty of LLC Latgales Energija to provide for heat supply to the objects connected to the
centralised heat supply system of the city according to the agreement and the requirements of legal acts,
the company has taken over from the City Council the duties specified in Section 15 of the Law on Local
Governments [The Municipalities Act]. i.e. ensuring provision of utilities or, more particularly, heat
supply. In connection with this LLC Latgales Energija is performing its activities and thereby also
planning and development [sic] of centralised heat supply in Rézekne City”.

not correspond to the legal or the actual situation; 4. (...)”.

In its letter dated 9 July 2007 the City Council described the respective contribution of the
Municipality and the operator as follows: “Rézekne City Council (...) has set up a work group for
formulation of the city development strategy, where it would be necessary to include the chapter of the
strategy on heating supply system prepared by the Operator. For the purposes of more successful and
efficient cooperation and to help the Operator to prepare its chapter of the strategy, the representatives of
the Operator are being invited to the meetings of the said work group” (C-128 [page 8]).

Having determined that the Rézekne City Council was in charge of preparing,
coordinating and approving the heat supply development plan for the City, and in fact
carried out such responsibilities, and that Latgales Energija had a contractual
obligation to cooperate in good faith with the Council in order to reach that objective,
the Tribunal turns to the question whether there was any delay on the part of the
Municipality, taking into account, amongst other things, the manner in which Latgales

Energija cooperated with the Municipality.

The Tribunal’s analysis will focus on the period from 20 January 2006, when Latgales
Energija sent its first draft to the Rézekne City Council, until 21 September 2007, the
date when the heat supply development plan for the City was finally approved by the
Rézekne City Council. It took twenty months in order for the heat supply
development plan for the City to be made. Considering that the February 2006
Agreement made on 10 February 2006 provided in its Clause 1.2 that the plan would
have to be approved by 28 February 2006, something clearly went wrong.

On 20 January 2006 Latgales Energija sent the Rézekne City Council its draft
“Guidelines for the development of the Rézekne City heat supply system’”!**? (see
paragraph 164 above). The Council in fact received this draft,'*4° but did not
acknowledge receipt of it to Latgales Energija; so Latgales Energija sent the Council
two reminders on 10 May 2006 and 19 October 2006;'*"! no answer by the Council is

in evidence to either reminder.

The Rézekne City Council studied Latgales Energija’s 44-page draft: Ms. Abramova,
Deputy Chair of the City Council, first wrote to the Mayor on 27 January 2006
suggesting that the draft Guidelines received from Latgales Energija should undergo

1342 the Mayor’s answer to this formal communication (if any) is

wider consultation;
not in evidence. Then on 19 May 2006 the Chairman of Rézekne City Task Force for
the Supervision of Heat Energy Affairs Mr. Zeile wrote to the Mayor stating inter alia

that whereas “in principle” the guidelines proposed by Latgales Energija “are correct

(...), they must be supported by figures and justified”.!*4?_ In this communication Mr.
Zeile set out five proposals, including the need for a feasibility study on the heat
supply options for the City, and he concluded that it would be necessary to develop a
short-term and a long-term concept of heat supply for the City. Apart from the
comment that Latgales Energija’s proposal must be supported by figures, the
Chairman of the Task Force expressed no criticism as to Latgales Energija’s draft
Guidelines in its communication to the Mayor. There is no evidence that Mr. Zeile’s
comments to the Mayor were in any way relayed to Latgales Energija or that Latgales
Energija was contacted by the Rézekne City Council in May 2006 or afterwards,
before November 2006.

Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement contemplated the approval by the
Municipality of the heat supply development plan of the City by 28 February 2006. It

is common ground that no plan was discussed and approved by 28 February 2006.

There is no evidence on the record that the Rézekne City Council promptly informed
Latgales Energija that the draft Guidelines submitted by Latgales Energija in January
2006 were not a sufficient basis in order for work to start on the part of the
Municipality. The Mayor was not called by the Respondent to give evidence as a

witness; neither were Ms. Adamova or Mr. Zeile for that matter.

The Council did not contact Latgales Energija with respect to the heat supply
development plan for the City until after Latgales Energija had written to the Council
on 19 October 2006.'*#4 In this letter Latgales Energija relied on Clause 5 of the
February 2006 Agreement (quoted in paragraph 174 above footnote 164) and
indicated that, unless the heat supply development plan for the City was adopted
within two months, Latgales Energija would deduct the whole amount corresponding
to the reduction on the tariffs that it had granted pursuant to the February 2006
Agreement from the rent owed to Rézeknes Siltumtikli. This letter followed, and was
probably prompted by, the Regulator’s decision of 13 October 2006 by which the

Regulator had refused to accept the new tariff proposed by Latgales Energija since

3 R-25 [pages 2-3].
the 10 May 2006 reminder was not answered.

 
 

254

874.

875.

876.

877.

one of the reasons for that decision was, in substance, that there was no heat supply

development plan in place in the City of Rézekne.'*4°

The Rézekne City Council started to criticise Latgales Energija’s conduct of early
2006 with respect to the heat supply development plan almost two years after
receiving the draft Guidelines in January 2006. Thus, in a letter of 15 November
2007 to the Ministry for Regional Development and Local Government Affairs the
Council stated that it had no document to approve by 28 February 2006'** and that
Latgales Energija sent its first drafts to the Council only on 15 November 2006.'*4”
However, the Council’s explanations to the Ministry were factually inaccurate in that
they failed to mention that the Council had received Latgales Energija’s first draft

Guidelines on 20 January 2006.

The same inaccuracy is contained in Rézekne City Council’s letter to Latgales

Energija dated 10 December 2007.!*48

The Tribunal finds that by 20 January 2006 the City Council had received draft
Guidelines by Latgales Energija on which it was possible to work, as confirmed both
by Ms. Adamova and Mr. Zeile to the Mayor of Rézekne, which conclusion is further
supported by the fact that the Rézekne City Council and Latgales Energija agreed on
10 February 2006 (Clause 1.2 of the February 2006 Agreement) that the heat supply
development plan for the City would be approved by the Council by 28 February
2006.

As the heat supply development plan for the City was not approved by 28 February
2006, Latgales Energija did not immediately complain to the Municipality.

On 10 May 2006 Latgales Energija wrote to the Rézekne City Council seeking
comments on its 20 January 2006 draft Guidelines. No answer by the Council is in
evidence. On 19 May 2006 Mr. Zeile wrote to the Mayor about Latgales Energija’s
draft Guidelines and gave his own proposals. No answer by the Mayor is in evidence.

1345 C_19, see also paragraph 184 above and paragraph 901 below.

the February 2006 Agreement by the Municipality is dated 19 October 2006,!3%°

followed by further letters.'?°°

On 3 November 2006 the Mayor requested Latgales Energija to provide the Council
with “the heat supply development plan for the 2006-2009 period”; the letter
specifically mentioned important points which had to be specified in such plan, but

omitted any reference to the draft Guidelines received in January 2006.'*°!

On 15 November 2006 Latgales Energija sent the Council two drafts: a one-page draft
for the period 2006-2009! and a 22-page draft for the period 2006-2014.'353

On 29 December 2006 the Rézekne City Council criticised the drafts received from
Latgales Energija in a one-page letter setting out eight comments.'**+ The letter
mentioned the existence of a working group that had met to review Latgales

Energija’s drafts of 15 November 2006.

In 2007 the Rézekne City Council decided to constitute the Working Group and the
implementation of that decision took five months: announced on 29 December
2006,'°° then again on 19 February 2007,'*° the Working Group was in fact
constituted only on 11 May 2007!%°7 despite the fact that its president and a significant
number of other members were members of the City Council (see paragraph 213

above).

On 30 May 2007 the Regulator requested Latgales Energija to provide “information
regarding the approved Rézekne City heat supply development plan” by 8 June

2007.'*°§ The Regulator, which had sent its previous enquiry to the Rézekne City

Council in 2005,'*° did not explain the reasons for which it now addressed its request
to Latgales Energija. On 6 June 2007 Latgales Energija replied asking the Regulator
to turn to the Municipality in accordance with the provisions of the Municipality Act

and the Energy Act.'

The first meeting of the Working Group took place on 14 May 2007.'*°! After the
Working Group was constituted, it met at regular intervals from May to September
2007; Mr. Ivars Paurs was called in as an expert at the end of July 2007. The heat

supply development plan for the City was finalised in less than five months.

In this period, the Rézekne City Council had repeatedly to request information from
Latgales Energija. The discussion between the parties was complicated by the dispute
relating to whose primary responsibility it was to produce a heat supply development
plan for the City. In addition, Latgales Energija complained that its repair and

investment proposals had not been answered by Rézeknes Siltumtikli.

Aside from these aspects, the finalisation of the heat supply development plan for the
City was delayed to an extent also by Latgales Energija’s apparent reluctance to
provide the Working Group with all the information required, as shown by the
repeated requests which the Rézekne City Council had to send to Latgales
Energija.'*°* However, the Respondent has not provided concrete evidence in these

proceedings as to the delay caused by Latgales Energija.

C-128 [pages 7 ff.] of 9 July 2007, to which a 19-page document was attached which is not in evidence.
This letter complains in strong terms that Latgales Energija is reluctant to provide information and refers
to the minutes of the Working Group in general terms. The Working Group concluded in fact on 31 July
2007 at a meeting not attended by Latgales Energija that the information requested from the operator had
not been provided (R-30 [page 29]), a point disputed by Latgales Energija’s representative at the 8
August 2007 meeting (R-30 [page 32]).
C-128 [page 15] of 19 July 2007, requesting Latgales Energija to provide the missing information by 24
July 2007.

pipelines, boiler houses, scope of reconstruction, energy efficiency measures), updated
information as of July 2007;

 

257

886.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The better part of the year 2006 and almost
half of 2007 were characterised by the Rézekne City Council’s inaction and delay
with respect to the establishment of the heat supply development plan for the City. As
from 13 October 2006, when the Regulator refused to approve a tariff proposed by
Latgales Energija relying inter alia on the absence of an approved heat supply
development plan for the City, it became clear that the Municipality’s delay would in
fact prevent the Regulator from accepting any new tariff proposed by Latgales

Energija until such a plan had been approved.

The Tribunal does not accept the Respondent’s contention that Latgales Energija
could have relied on “more general development documents and relied on its own
business scenario” since the Regulator’s decision did not mention that Latgales

Energija had failed to do so.

Considering the position adopted by the Regulator, it must have been clear to the
Municipality that, confronted with ever rising prices of natural gas, Latgales
Energija’s position would become ever more difficult. Yet the Municipality’s
inaction continued and further significant delay accrued. Any delay as may have been
caused by Latgales Energija’s failure promptly to provide the Working Group with all
the information required is insignificant by comparison to the delay caused by

Rézekne City Council.

 

(ii) the time schedule relating to the planned investments and repair and overhaul of the heat supply
system;
(iii) the planned sources of financing for the necessary investments (own funds, credit); and
(iv) information as to how the planned investment will affect energy efficiency measures, thermal
energy production and supply tariff.
C-128 [page 31] of 31 July 2007 requesting Latgales Energija to provide information still outstanding.

(v)_ the load on networks (how many MWh/km? should such networks be retained?); and
(vi) how suited the existing diameters of the existing piping to consumer load were.

Latgales Energija was also asked to describe the self-cost of thermal energy generation and provide
information as to current tariffs and actual costs as well as measures to reduce self-costs.

The Respondent’s complaint that Latgales Energija belatedly contacted the Rézekne
City Council in May 2006 after sending its proposal in January 2006 is devoid of any
foundation; upon receipt of such proposal, it was a matter for the Council to react and

contact Latgales Energija, which the Council failed to do.

The Tribunal finds that the Council’s conduct, in the circumstances recalled above,
appears to be founded on prejudice or preference rather than on reason or fact, i.e. it
was arbitrary and falls short of the duties further outlined in paragraphs 841 ff. above

with respect to Article 3(1) of the BIT.

(iii) The Claim Based on the Municipality's Refusal to Consent to
Investments into the Heating System
The Claimant claims that the Municipality breached its expectations that it would
comply with requests to provide consent for the making of investments into the
heating system and that Latgales Energija could modernise and improve the system;
that the Municipality’s refusal to provide consent to investments (including as to
cogeneration) was an act of harassment, and that Latgales Energija was thereby
unable to invest the full amount of EUR 1.5 million into the heating system in the first
three years of the lease. The Respondent opposed this claim in contemporaneous
correspondence, denying that the investments to be made by Latgales Energija were

sufficient.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 898 below.

This complaint includes two points: (i) the Municipality’s refusal to consent to
investments to be made by Latgales Energija to the Assets, and (ii) the Claimant’s
failure to comply with the minimum investment required in the first three-year period
of the lease in accordance with Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement (see

paragraph 92 above).

The Claimant has filed three documents in support of this claim: Latgales Energija’s

letter to the Mayor of Rézekne dated 6 March 2007,'*° Latgales Energija’s letter to

 

Rézeknes Siltumtikli dated 18 April 2007'°°* and Latgales Energija’s letter to

13683 C116,
eo C-118.

259

891.

892.

Rézeknes Siltumtikli dated 13 July 2007'*® as well as Mr. Strioga’s first Witness

Statement.'3%

The first letter refers to repair or investment proposals allegedly made by Latgales
Energija and it points out that the Rézekne City Council’s and Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s
failure to answer will result in the investment made by Latgales Energija to fall short

of the minimum amount contractually agreed of EUR 1.5 million.

The second letter restates the content of the first letter without reference to the amount
of EUR 1.5 million; in addition, it mentions Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s failure to grant
permission for the installation of cogeneration equipment as well as new boilers at

Rigas iela and AtbrivoSanas aleja 155a.

The third letter refers to four previous letters by Latgales Energija to Rézeknes
Siltumtikli or the Rézekne City Council that have allegedly remained unanswered;
none of those letters is in evidence. One of such letters is said to have requested
permission for the installation of the cogeneration facility and two 30 MW water

boilers.

Almost one year later, on 15 May 2008 Rézeknes Siltumtikli wrote to the Rézekne
City Council and the Regulator pointing out that Latgales Energija had failed to invest
the minimum amount of EUR 1.5 million in the first three years of operation in breach
of Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement.'**’ Five days later the Rézekne City
Council made the same point, amongst other things, in a letter to Latgales
Energija.'*** In its answer dated 2 June 2008 Latgales Energija restated inter alia that
Rézeknes Siltumtikli had withheld its consent to the building of the cogeneration

station, 3

The burden of proof is on the Claimant as to (i) Latgales Energija’s alleged proposals
for repairs to and investments into the heating system, (ii) the alleged refusal by

Rézeknes Siltumtikli and the Rézekne City Council to approve Latgales Energija’s

proposals and (iii) the reason(s) for which Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s and/or the Rézekne

City Council’s approval was required. The Respondent has not answered this claim.

The Tribunal has already noted that Latgales Energija’s proposals are not in evidence
(see paragraph 209 above); Mr. Strioga’s evidence fails to provide details as to the

proposed investments, apart from cogeneration which is specifically mentioned.

Cogeneration has been dealt with in a patchy manner in the pleadings. One must first
determine whether cogeneration was part of the Rézekne Project or was simply a
possible option. Clause 2.10 of the February 2005 Agreement (quoted in paragraph
103 above) provides that the Municipality will not get involved in the installation of
cogeneration stations with third parties. Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement
does mention cogeneration,'*” but it does so by reference to the Gas Supply

Agreement.

In its first comprehensive memorial of 6 December 2013 the Claimant contended that

cogeneration had been an important part of the investment ever since the

1371 and it referred to the “cogeneration project”,!*” but it also stated that

1.1373

beginning
cogeneration was simply a “possibility” according to the Gas Supply Agreement

In its Reply the Claimant then contended that “the Municipality’s requirement for

cogeneration was contractually recognised in the Long Term Agreement”.!374

The witness evidence and the scant documentary evidence on cogeneration does not
justify the conclusion that the Muncipality was under an obligation to Latgales

Energija to adopt a cogeneration project.

137 Art. 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement (C-4) reads as follows:
The Operator within three years as of the Agreement entering into force
undertakes to invest into the Heat supply facilities either in the Assets or new
assets in the amount not less than EUR 1,500,000 (one million and five hundred
thousand Euros) in order to background obligations against AS ,,Latvijas Gaze’”
assumed by the Lessor concerning gasification and cogeneration according to an
agreement no. 1580 dated 23 April 2004.

Mr. Strioga’s evidence on cogeneration is to the effect that all permissions required
were received.!*”> However, only Latvenergo’s statement is in evidence, and it is
dated 22 February 2006;'*”° Latgales Energija’s proposal (if any) is not in evidence.
The Tribunal further notes that Mr. Jautakis refers more generally to a “plan” in his

first Witness Statement.'277

Cogeneration was a much-discussed item within the Working Group for the
preparation of the heat supply development plan for the City, and the final plan of

21 September 2007 expressly mentions cogeneration.!778

The plan for the City was issued in the middle of the energy crisis at a time when the
investor and the Municipality’s differences had grown into a full-blown dispute.
Whereas the Claimant complains of a lack of approval on the part of the Municipality
of offers allegedly made, the Municipality in turn complained of a lack of information

as to planned investments on the part of Latgales Energija.'°””

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove that the Muncipality was
under an obligation to Latgales Energija to realise a cogeneration project. It follows
that until and unless a specific project had been agreed upon by the Municipality and
Latgales Energija, Latgales Energija had no right to carry out a cogeneration project.
In the circumstances that have been recalled, the Tribunal cannot conclude in the
absence of sufficient documentary evidence that the Claimant’s alleged offers were
offers proper which called for a decision on the part of the Municipality, rather than
“a plan”, as stated by Mr. Jautakis in his evidence. Such offers, if final and
sufficiently detailed, would have been contained in documents, especially insofar as

investments were concerned.

The Tribunal further finds that the Claimant’s reminders in Exhibits C-116, C-118
and C-129 are insufficient to prove Latgales Energija’s alleged proposals as to repairs

and investments.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant has
failed to prove its claim that Rézeknes Siltumtitkli and/or the Rézekne City Council
dismissed or failed to answer Latgales Energija’s proposals for repairs and

investment, including as to cogeneration, and dismisses such claim.

As to the Claimant’s claim that Rézeknes Siltumtikli and/or the Rézekne City
Council’s alleged refusal caused Latgales Energija’s failure to comply with the
minimum investment required under Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement, such
point is relevant only in the context of the revocation of the licences by the Regulator;

the Tribunal will examine such point in that context (see paragraphs 1021 ff. below).

(iv) The Claims Based on the Regulator’s Repeated Refusals to Set
anew Tariff

The Regulator’s decisions as to the tariff relevant for the purposes of this Award are

as follows:

The Claimant complains that its expectations were breached by the Respondent in that
(i) the Regulator, having reversed its previous practice, refused to set new tariffs
relying on the absence of a Development Plan, and that (ii) the Regulator revoked on

7 December 2007 the tariff approved on 9 November 2007 in non-transparent

conditions and wrongly, as a result of the Municipality’s interference; the 7 December
2007 decision was arbitrary and discriminatory; more generally, the Respondent
breached the standard of fair and equitable treatment due to the Regulator’s arbitrary
and discriminatory refusal to calculate a new tariff where a new tariff was critical due
to factors outside the operator’s control, especially in light of the increase in the price
of natural gas. The Respondent denies that the Municipality interfered with the
Regulator and contends that the Regulator acted independently within the scope of its
duties and prerogatives; in the period from 2005 to 2007 Latgales Energija applied

four times for a new tariff and the Regulator issued a new tariff in 2005.
The Tribunal’s findings are set out in paragraphs 903, 911, 918 and 922 below.

The Regulator’s Decision of 13 October 2006. The Regulator’s decision of 13
October 2006 refusing the tariff proposed by Latgales Energija rested on two grounds:
(i) the rates proposed by Latgales Energija did not show changes in boiler house
efficiency in line with investments and the plan of heating supply development
approved by the Municipality and (ii) the proposed rates were not based on costs fully
substantiated (e.g. the salaries to be paid by Latgales Energija) as required by Section
19 of the Public Utility Regulators Act.!*8? The Claimant’s complaints relate only to
the first reason given by the Regulator; the Claimant has not contested the second

reason on which the Regulator’s decision is based.

The Tribunal finds that the Regulator’s refusal to approve a new tariff was therefore
stated to be due also to Latgales Energija’s failure to substantiate its own costs. In
such circumstances, the Regulator was entitled to refuse to approve the tariff proposed
by Latgales Energija on that ground alone. The decision was based on principles of
law, the most fundamental of which was the principle whereby the Regulator must
ensure that the new rates proposed by an operator must be based on costs that have
been duly substantiated. This is far from an outlandish concern as it is the Regulator’s

duty to protect end-users.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Regulator’s

decision of 13 October 2006 cannot therefore be characterised as arbitrary or as

frustrating the investor’s legitimate expectations since the investor was under a duty
to provide the required information to the Regulator in accordance with Latvian law

and failed to do so.

The Regulator’s Decision of 11 June 2007. The Regulator’s decision of 11 June 2007
refusing the tariff proposed by Latgales Energija is based on the following grounds:
(i) Latgales Energija failed to provide an accurate calculation of the fuel costs in
accordance with Clause 23(1) of the Methodology in two respects: first, the balance
sheet of the predictable thermal energy consumption must be prepared in accordance
with the heat supply development plan approved by the Municipality (Section 17 of
the Methodology) and no such plan existed in the City of Rézekne; such plan was
necessary to determine expected changes in house boiler efficiency (the “Dhk”
coefficient) and such coefficient had not been included in Latgales Energija’s
calculation; secondly, two further coefficients (the boiler house net efficiency index
“hnetokom” and the index of expected changes of heating network “Dhst.”) had not
been included by Latgales Energija; and (ii) Latgales Energija failed to provide the
Regulator both with the long-term development plan required by Clause 6.3 of the
licences and the prospective one-year plan of operation to be provided every year
under Clause 7.1 of the licences (see paragraphs 133 above). In an obiter the
Regulator added that the development plan had not been approved “due to the

applicant’s fault”.

As a consequence, the Regulator found that the rates submitted by Latgales Energija
failed to comply with the requirements of Clauses 17, 23(1), 23(2), 23(3) and 23(6) of
the Methodology (C-35) and Latgales Energija’s proposal must therefore be dismissed
inter alia under Sections 1, 9(1)(1) and (3), 9(2), 19(1) and (4) of the Public Utility

Regulators Act.

The Regulator’s decision was upheld on appeal by the Administrative District Court
on 15 April 2009.'*83 On the issue of coefficients, the court noted that there was no

1384

dispute that three coefficients prescribed by the Methodology were not used by

Latgales Energija due to the fact that “the city of Rézekne [had] not developed and

1383 C-192.
184 Dhk, hnetokm and Dhst.

265

907.

908.

approved [a] heating system development plan”,'*** thereby accepting a point argued

by Latgales Energija in its application to set aside,'**° namely that all three
coefficients depended on the existence of a development plan. However, the court
went on to find that the three coefficients were prescribed by the Methodology; a
failure to apply them in the calculation of the tariff meant that a tariff so calculated
was inaccurate, and therefore unacceptable, since such tariff would give rise to undue
costs for end-users.'*8? On Latgales Energija’s complaint that the Regulator’s reversal
of its prior practice was unlawful, the court accepted that the Regulator had set a new
tariff in 2005 without applying the three coefficients in dispute. However, Latgales
Energija’s reliance on the 2005 tariff could be protected only provided that the
situation in 2005 and in 2007 was the same. The court found that such was not the
case, holding (i) that the Regulator had already rejected a tariff proposed by Latgales
Energija in 2006 and (ii) “(...) that in 2005 the situation of heat supplies in Rézekne
was different and namely, in 2005 a different heat supply operator (the Applicant) has
commenced their operations in the city and it was necessary to ensure the heat to the

city. Without approval of the tariffs, there was a risk that the city is left without heat

supply”.1388

The Regulator’s 11 June 2007 decision raises two main issues, namely whether the
fair and equitable treatment standard is breached by a decision which requires the
operator to calculate a proposed new tariff by using coefficients which are not
available due to no fault of the operator, and whether the Regulator was bound by its

previous practice.

Not without hesitation, the Tribunal concludes that the Regulator’s decision is neither
arbitrary nor discriminatory per se insofar as it puts end-user protection first and
requires compliance with coefficients which would have been available if the heat

supply development plan for the City had been approved by the Municipality.

The Regulator’s dictum stating that the non-existence of the plan was due to the
operator’s fault is nevertheless unwarranted because it was not for the Regulator to

express an opinion on a dispute between the Rézekne City Council and Latgales
Energija; it is significant that the Administrative District Court did not repeat such

statement in its decision.

Whether the reversal of the Regulator’s 2005 practice was lawful is first and foremost
a matter of Latvian law. It was examined by the Administrative District Court, which
found that the situation in 2007 was not the same as in 2005. The Tribunal considers
that the reason given by the court based on the distinction between the situation in
2007 and in 2005 recalled in paragraph 906 above is not compelling; yet the Tribunal
is mindful of the fact that it is not for an investment tribunal to second guess the
courts of the host State, although this Tribunal has reached this conclusion not without
reluctance in the present case as it would seem to be almost self-evident that it was

vital to ensure that heating could be provided to the City in 2007 as it was in 2005.

The Claimant has contended that it relied on the fact that the Regulator would not
change its 2005 practice, i.e. that the Regulator would continue to consider and accept
proposals for a new tariff, if need be, despite the absence of a heat supply
development plan for the City. However, the Long-Term Agreement and the
February 2005 Agreements were entered into by Latgales Energija in January and
February 2005 respectively, and the Regulator’s decision setting a new tariff was
made in December 2005. There is no evidence of any specific representations or
assurances by the Regulator to the Claimant or Latgales Energija that new tariffs
could still be adopted despite the fact that there was no heat supply development plan
in place for the City; the Claimant has not discharged its burden of proof in this

respect.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Regulator’s 11 June 2007 decision is
ultimately based on the Regulator’s duty to protect end-users and it cannot be said to
amount to bad faith, wilful disregard of due process of law, to be founded on
preference or prejudice rather than reason or fact, or not to bear any reasonable
relationship to some rational policy or otherwise to be in breach of Article 3(1) of the

BIT.

The Regulator’s Decisions of 9 November and 7 December 2007. The Regulator’s

decision of 9 November 2007 set a new tariff upon Latgales Energija’s proposal; in

267

913.

914.

915.

the meantime the Municipality’s heat supply development plan for the City had been

adopted on 21 September 2007 (see paragraph 228 above).

On 7 December 2007 the Regulator revoked its 9 November 2007 decision on the
grounds that: (i) that it had received a letter by Rézeknes Energija indicating an
amount of natural gas planned to be supplied by Latvijas Gaze that was different from
the amount indicated by Latgales Energija in its application for a new tariff, (ii) that
the tariff approved on 9 November 2007 was not calculated in accordance with the
actual situation in accordance with Clause 22(1) of the Methodology and (iii) that
Latgales Energija had “knowingly submitted (...) false information” and obtained a

new tariff “by illegal means”, as a consequence of which its conduct was “unlawful”.

The 7 December 2007 decision did not set out the applicable tariff further to the

revocation of the Regulator’s 9 November 2007 decision.

On 23 September 2010 the Administrative Regional Court dismissed Latgales
Energija’s appeal against the decision of the Administrative Regional Court of
30 October 2009, upholding the Regulator’s decision of 7 December 2007; the
23 September 2010 decision confirms that the reasons stated in the 30 September
2009 decision were sound as a matter of Latvian law.'*8° Only the 23 September
2010 decision is in evidence, but the 30 October 2009 decision is summarised therein;
both decisions deal with the amount of natural gas that was properly to be taken into
consideration for the purposes of the Methodology and the consequences which such
amount would have on the price of gas sold by Latvijas Gaze, which are both highly

technical matters.

Latgales Energija was not heard before the 7 December 2007 decision was made.
This decision was not made purely on technical grounds since the Regulator found
that Latgales Energija had deliberately submitted information known to be false, to

the detriment of the public interest, and that its conduct was therefore unlawful.

The Tribunal finds that the fact that Latgales Energija was accused of such
wrongdoing in the decision without being heard amounts to a procedural irregularity,

all the more so in a case in which such accusation rested on information unilaterally

13899 R 4

268

916.

917.

918.

919.

920.

provided by Rézeknes Energija to the Regulator. However, the Tribunal considers
that it is relevant that the Regulator’s 7 December 2007 decision was subject to
judicial review before two successive Latvian courts, which upheld the Regulator’s
decision, and as to which it is not suggested that there was any denial of justce. The
Tribunal considers that the irregularity in the procedure of the Regulator should be
weighed alongside the existence of an avenue of appeal and, not without reluctance,
the Tribunal finds that such irregularity is not serious enough to give rise to a breach

of due process amounting to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal further dismisses the Claimant’s complaint that the Regulator’s
7 December 2007 decision was arbitrary and/or discriminatory. The issue in dispute
went to the question whether the rates proposed by Latgales Energija for a particular
user group were based on an accurate calculation. The Regulator’s decision involved
the determination of technical issues under the Methodology as well as the quantity of
natural gas that had to be purchased from Latvijas Gaze as it purported to correct a
mistake in the 9 November 2007 decision due to the inaccurate quantity of natural gas

taken into account by Latgales Energija.

The Tribunal considers that the Claimant has failed to show that the Regulator’s
7 December 2007 decision was based on prejudice or preference rather than reason or

fact.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal therefore dismisses the
Claimant’s complaints that the Regulator’s decision of 7 December 2007 constitutes a
breach of due process, that it is arbitrary and it was made in bad faith, in breach of

Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Regulator’s Alleged Failures to Set_a New Tariff Taking into Account the

 

Increase in Electricity and Natural Gas Prices. The Tribunal must finally consider the
Claimant’s complaint that the Regulator breached the standard of fair and equitable
treatment by refusing to set a new tariff in circumstances in which a new tariff was
critical due to factors outside the operator’s control, especially in light of the increase

in natural gas and electricity prices.

The Regulator’s 11 June 2007 decision was not arbitrary in itself, as the Tribunal has

found in paragraph 911 above. However, as found in paragraph 886 above, the

269

921.

922.

923.

Municipality bears responsibility for the fact that there was no heat supply

development plan in place for the City when the Regulator made this decision.

When the Public Utility Commission authorised an increase in the price of natural gas
on 28 March 2007 (see paragraph 231 above), the price of natural gas had increased
by between 55% and 129% from the rate included in the December 2005 tariff
calculations according to the Claimant. The Respondent has not specifically

challenged these figures.

Owing to the absence of a heat supply development plan for the City, Latgales
Energija was effectively deprived of its statutory right to propose a new tariff where
the costs of the heat supply had increased by more than 5% for factors beyond its
control (Clause 13 of the Methodology). This was actually so regardless of the tariff
that Latgales Energija might propose to the Regulator. The situation was all the more
unfair to the Claimant because Latgales Energija had in fact consented to decreasing
the rates charged to end-users under the February 2006 Agreement in consideration
inter alia for the Municipality’s undertaking to have the heat supply development plan
for the City approved by the end of February 2006 (see paragraphs 173, 177 and 180

above).

Having said this, the Tribunal has already found in paragraph 886 above that the
Municipality’s delayed approval of the heat supply development plan for the City
prevented a review of the tariffs by the Regulator. Responsibility for such a state of

affairs lies with the Municipality, not the Regulator.
The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this claim.

(v) The Claims Based on the Municipality’s and the Regulator’s
Conduct in Connection with the Energy Crisis
There are multiple claims made by the Claimant in relation to the Municipality’s and
the Regulator’s conduct in connection with the energy crisis of September/October
2007. The following table provides a synoptic view of the main events in

chronological order.

The Tribunal will examine the Claimant’s claims in relation to the following
circumstances: (i) the failure by the Municipality to pay the balance of Latvijas
Gaze’s invoices to Rézeknes Siltumtikli prior to mid-September 2007; (ii) the
interview given by the Mayor of the City of Rézekne on 13 September 2007; (iii) the
steps taken by the Municipality to set up Rézeknes Energija and obtain a loan from
the Treasury in an amount of LVL 4 million from 28 September 2007 onwards; (iv)
the attachment of Latgales Energija’s assets obtained by Rézeknes Siltumtikli and the
failure by the Rézekne City Council and Rézeknes Siltumtikli to have the attachment
lifted in accordance with the October 2007 Agreement; (v) the declaration of an
energy crisis by the Rézekne City Council on 9 October 2007; (vi) the Regulator’s
decision to take over Latgales Energija’s zone on 11 October 2007; and (vii) the
appointment of Rézeknes Energija by the Rézekne City Council as the person in

charge of providing thermal energy on 12 October 2007.
a. The failure by the Municipality to pay the balance of Latvijas
Gdze’s invoices to Rézeknes Siltumtikli prior to mid-September

2007

The Claimant complains of a breach of its legitimate expectations that Latgales
Energija would receive natural gas to be able to provide heating services and the
Municipality would abide by the contractual arrangements in relation to the supply of
such natural gas, and would in particular pay Latvijas Gaze. Relying on different
legal theories the Respondent contends that only Latgales Energija had a duty to pay

for the natural gas delivered.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 937 below.

The Claimant rests its legitimate expectations on a combined reading of Clause 2.3 of

the Long-Term Agreement!?” and Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement.'*?!

The Respondent contends that Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement deals only
with cases of delay in the completion of the infrastructure for the use of natural gas by

Latvijas Gaze and does not avail the Claimant’s case. It is the Respondent’s case that

391 C8, quoted in paragraph 104 above, as amended by Clause 6 of Amendment No. 3 to the Gas
Supply Agreement (C-81).

 

272

928.

929.

930.

931.

Latgales Energija undertook to pay for the gas for a number of reasons: first, because
the Long-Term Agreement is to be characterised as the transfer of a business as a
whole as a matter of Latvian law (Betriebsiibergang); and, secondly, because Latgales

Energija tacitly undertook such an obligation to pay.

The Claimant’s argument is based on Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement.
Each paragraph of Clause 4 contemplates a specific case. According to the first
paragraph, the Municipality shall indemnify Latgales Energija of the losses incurred
in case the completion of the natural gas infrastructure by Latvijas Gaze has been
delayed due to the fault of the Municipality or a third party and Latgales Energija has
therefore had to use heavy fuel oil rather than natural gas. According to the second
paragraph, the Municipality shall pay Latvijas Gaze any losses and/or contractual
penalties which Latvijas Gaze may claim from (inter alios) Latgales Energija based
on the Municipality’s obligations undertaken under the Gas Supply Agreement “on

purchase of a specified amount of gas for the needs of the city of Rézekne”.

The Municipality had undertaken a minimum purchase obligation under
Clauses 3.1 ff. of the Gas Supply Agreement,'**? the breach of which was sanctioned

by a contractual penalty according to Clause 3.4 of the same agreement.

The Tribunal finds that the reference by Clause 4, second paragraph, of the 2005
February Agreement to the “purchase of a specified amount of gas” is to be read
against the background of the take-or-pay obligations undertaken by the Municipality
under the Gas Supply Agreement with Latvijas Gaze. It follows that the interpretation
and construction of Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement advanced by the
Claimant is inconsistent with a plain reading of the express terms of the provision

under consideration.

Whether the second paragraph of Clause 4 of the February 2005 Agreement is capable
of applying each year, or is related to the first year of operation in which a delay has
occurred with respect to the date of completion of the natural gas infrastructure, as
contended by the Respondent, is irrelevant for present purposes. The Tribunal finds

that what is relevant is the absence of an express term in the February 2005

1392 C-40.

273

932.

933.

934.

Agreement to the effect that Latgales Energija would have no duty to pay for the

natural gas used on the basis that such duty was solely on the Municipality.

The Respondent argues that Latgales Energija was bound to pay for the gas on the
basis that the Long-Term Agreement is to be characterised as a contract making

provision for a transfer of business as a whole (Betriebsiibergang).

The Tribunal finds that such argument is unsound because it is contradicted by the
negotiations between the Parties and the express terms of the Long-Term Agreement.
The Long-Term Agreement is stated to be a contract between a lessor (Rézeknes
Siltumtikli) and an operator (Latgales Energija) relating to certain assets (as defined in
Clause 1.1(a)) of the same agreement). Moreover, the Claimant’s PowerPoint
presentation of 25 November 2004 made an express distinction between a “lease of

RS property” and “lease of RS itself (‘lease of business’)”.'*9

The Long-Term
Agreement was made as a lease of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s assets and the legal concept
of a Betriebsiibergang prayed in aid by the Respondent, which corresponds to a “lease
of RS itself (‘lease of business’)”, is therefore the concept which the parties

eventually discarded, as proved by the express terms of the Long-Term Agreement.

The Respondent’s final argument is based on an alleged tacit agreement by Latgales
Energija. When the gas started to be supplied from 7 November 2005 onwards, no
contract in writing was made between Rézeknes Siltumtikli and/or the Municipality
on the one hand, and Latgales Energija on the other, despite the fact that Latgales
Energija would start to use the natural gas. Even subsequently, when it became clear
that Latvijas Gaze had no interest in having a direct contractual relationship with
Latgales Energija, Rézeknes Siltumtikli and/or the Municipality and Latgales Energija
did not enter into a contract in writing in relation to the natural gas used by Latgales
Energija. It is common ground that Rézeknes Siltumtikli invoiced Latgales Energija
on the basis of invoices received from Latvijas Gaze. Latgales Energija paid such
invoices directly to Latvijas Gaze until May 2007 without raising any objections as to

the tariff underlying Latvijas Gaze’s invoices. These facts are described in

393 C-41 [page 4].

935.

937.

1304

Ms. Rogozina’s first Witness Statemen on which the Respondent has itself

d:1395

relic such facts are therefore common ground.

A contract relating to the natural gas used by Latgales Energija, not reduced to
writing, has thereby come into being between Latgales Energija and Rézeknes
Siltumtikli, to whose installations the natural gas was supplied by Latvijas Gaze. For
the purposes of this Award, which is not concerned with the determination of the
respective contractual rights and duties of Rézeknes Siltumttkli, the Rézekne City
Council and Latgales Energija, it is irrelevant whether Latgales Energija’s duty to pay
for the natural gas used ultimately arises under an amendment of the Long-Term
Agreement, as found by the Latvian courts, or is the term of an independent contract
not reduced to writing between Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Latgales Energija which

arose out of a consistent, continuous and uncontested course of dealing.

The Tribunal finds that neither the Long-Term Agreement nor the February 2005
Agreement contains any terms determining which party is liable for the payment of
natural gas as between the Municipality and Rézeknes Siltumtikli on the one hand,
and Latgales Energija on the other. As these are the main contracts pursuant to which
the investment was made, it follows that the Claimant could not, at the time of the
investment, reasonably expect, based on such contracts, that the Municipality would
pay for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas Gaze, considering in particular that (i)
Latgales Energija would in fact use the gas to provide heating services and (ii)
Latgales Energija would therefore have to be reasonably expected to pay for the gas

used.

The _Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Municipality’s failure to pay the

balance outstanding for the natural gas supplied by Latvijas Gaze is not, therefore, a

breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in itself.

b. The interview given by the Mayor of the City of Rézekne on
13 September 2007 and the Municipality’s alleged attempts to

attract a new investor in the summer of 2007
The Claimant complains that the Municipality breached its expectation that the
Council would not actively seek to replace Latgales Energija as the operator, and took
steps in anticipation of, or with the deliberate intent to cause, Latgales Energija’s
removal. The Claimant further claims that the Municipality’s attempt to attract a new

operator in the summer of 2007 is a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraphs 943 and 946 below.

On 13 September 2007 the Mayor of Rézekne gave an interview to explain the

situation two days after Latvijas Gaze had stopped supplying natural gas.'3°°

The interview purported to explain the current difficulties and allay the fears of the
population.'*°? However, in the process, Latgales Energija was vilified in the public
eye; it was portrayed as a company that had failed to comply with its obligations
whilst benefitting from a contract detrimental to the City’s interests, and a company

whose conduct had been improper in its attempted contacts with the Regulator.'°°*

The Tribunal finds that the interview was misleading in content as it was imbalanced
in tone, and the fact that the interview was given in difficult circumstances for the
Municipality is no excuse. The overall tone of the interview raises an inference that

the Mayor of Rézekne took the view that Latgales Energija was part of the problem.

Moreover, the reference made by the Mayor to a new company ready to appear if

need be may raise an inference that the replacement of Latgales Energija was already

139% C-134, quoted in paragraph 251 above.

397 “The City Council can easily pay the debt to Latvijas Gaze. The debt amount is small (...)
Tomorrow (14 September), six companies that provide heating in Latvia will receive letters (...) and an
offer to take up provision of heating in our city (...) much has been done to solve the problem, but it has
not been publicly advertised. For three months, I have been negotiating with several companies
persuading them that Rézekne has a future (...) in case of necessity a new company, large, serious and
reliable, would appear here”.

 

1398 “Everybody knows that the lease agreement with the company Latgales energija is disadvantageous
for the City (...) Latgales Energija is thus trying to impose a pressure on the Regulator (...) as of the
beginning of operations Latgales Energija did not pay a santims for depreciation (...) [iJn relation to
taking over the debt of Rézeknes siltumtikli, Latgales energija did not take it over (...)”.

part of the Municipality’s agenda, a point which the Tribunal will discuss in

paragraph 944 below.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. In his interview of 13 September 2007 the
Mayor of Rézekne publicly displayed an utter lack of even-handedness towards
Latgales Energija. Nevertheless, the Tribunal finds that such event does not reach the

threshold of a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

As to the specific claim that the Municipality attempted to attract a new operator in
the summer of 2007, the Tribunal finds that such a claim is not supported by any

evidence and must be dismissed.

The burden of proof is on the Claimant. The interview, given in circumstances which
were difficult also for the Mayor, is not sufficient evidence in itself. The primary
purpose of the interview was to reassure the public. The statement that the Mayor had
been in contact with a number of companies for some three months may have been
used to this effect, and may or may not be accurate, and would therefore need to be
confirmed by further and more compelling evidence. However, there are no further
elements on the record warranting a finding that the Municipality in fact attempted to

attract a new operator in the summer of 2007.

The same is true of the offers which, the Mayor indicated, would be sent to several

companies on 14 September 2007; nothing in the record confirms such declaration.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s claim
that the Municipality attempted to attract new investors in the summer of 2007, and
would send offers to several companies in September 2007 is unproven in point of

fact.

c. The steps taken by the Municipality to set up Rézeknes Energija
and to obtain a loan from the Treasury in an amount of LVL

4 million (28 September/9 October 2007)
In addition to the complaint mentioned in paragraph 938 above, the Claimant claims
that the Municipality attempted to regain control of the heating system by
incorporating Rézeknes Energija before declaring an energy crisis, which is a breach

of good faith. The Respondent answered at the Hearing that as Latgales Energija had

indicated that it had paid for the gas less than had been invoiced, there was a risk that
Latgales Energija could end up in bankruptcy. Therefore the Municipality had a duty
to adopt an alternative plan as a precaution and, accordingly, it went on to establish

Rézeknes Energija.!°°°

The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 949 below.

On 28 September 2007 the Rézekne City Council reportedly took the decision to

establish Rézeknes Energija;'4°

the Respondent did not challenge the information
contained in this exhibit. On 2 October 2007 Rézeknes Energija was incorporated.!#°!
The Rézekne City Council applied to the Local Government Loan and Guarantee
Control and Monitoring Council, seeking approval of its decision to apply to the
Treasury for a loan of LVL 4 million in order that Rézeknes Energija’s capital could
be increased; the Council granted the approval sought by the Municipality on 3
October 2007.'#°? On 4 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council applied to the
Treasury'*° which granted the loan on the following day. '“°* On 9 October 2007 the
Rézekne City Council decided to apply the loan to the capital increase of Rézeknes
Energija.'4°

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the establishment of
Rézeknes Energija is not in itself a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, but the Claimant
could succed if it proved that such step was taken to pave the way for actions that
contravene Article 3(1) of the BIT; this is a point which the Tribunal will examine in

paragraphs 968 ff. below.

d. The attachment of Latgales Energija’s assets obtained by Rézeknes
Siltumttkli (21 September 2007) and the failure by the Rézekne City

Council to have the attachment lifted
The Claimant complains that the Respondent breached its expectations that the
Municipality would not actively prevent Latgales Energija from operating its business
and would comply with the undertaking to have the attachment lifted; that the
attachment was an act of harassment on the part of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and later, in
addition, by Rézeknes Energija; that due process was denied as the attachments were
intended to paralyse Latgales Energija’s commercial activities; and, finally, that
applying for the attachments and refusing to have them lifted was an act of bad faith,
was arbitrary and discriminatory. The Respondent replies that the lawsuits brought by
Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija against Latgales Energija for (inter alia)
unpaid natural gas were based on two commercial agreements entered into by two
commercial companies which were not the arm of the Municipality; such lawsuits
were the consequence of Latgales Energija’s failure to pay the full amount due for the

natural gas received and used.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 952 below.

The Claimant has contended that Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s claim was unfounded and
that the bulk of the claim was represented by a dispute that had been simmering since
2006; the timing of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s action was calculated to disrupt Latgales
Energija’s operations. The Respondent answered at the Hearing that after Latgales
Energija had indicated that it had paid for the gas less than had been invoiced, there
was a risk of bankruptcy.'4°° Rézeknes Siltumtikli is a commercial company and not
an arm of the Municipality which, as the sole shareholder, is entitled to act only in

line with commercial principles, as opposed to political considerations. '4°”

The_Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the fact that
Rézeknes Siltumtikli applied for an attachment to secure its claims for payment
against Latgales Energija arising under the Long-Term Agreement is not in itself a
breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT; neither is, in itself, the fact that Rézeknes
Siltumtikli applied for the attachment to be reinstated in breach of the undertaking

contained in the October 2007 Agreement. However, the Tribunal will also have to
determine whether these circumstances call for a different conclusion when
considered as part of the wider context of the energy crisis (see paragraphs 964 ff.

below).

e. The declaration of an energy crisis by the Rézekne City Council on
9 October 2007

In addition to the first complaint mentioned in paragraph 938 above the Claimant
claims that the energy crisis was of the Municipality’s own making and it was
therefore declared in bad faith; moreover, the Municipality refused to have the
attachment lifted, which would have enabled Latgales Energija to provide heating to
the City. Finally, the energy crisis was declared on 9 October 2007 before Latgales
Energija had an opportunity to answer the Regulator’s warning of 4 October 2007.
The Claimant complains that the Municipality’s actions in September and October
2007 were arbitrary and discriminatory, and the crisis was a tool used by the
Municipality in an attempt to force Latgales Energija into relinquishing some or all of

the heating system.

The Respondent takes the view that Latgales Energija caused the crisis by its own
failure to pay for the natural gas used, and the Municipality had little choice but to act

to protect the public interest in accordance with Latvian law.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraphs 961 and 973 below.

The energy crisis was declared by decision No. 388 of the Rézekne City Council on 9
October 2007, which established the Energy Crisis Committee, chaired by the
Mayor.'*°8 The decision is stated to be based on Sections 59(1), 62(1) and 70(1) of

the Energy Act;'4

it does not contain any findings of fact, but simply sets out the
statutory requirement set out in Section 59(1) of the Energy Act. This provision states
that an energy crisis is declared when the supply of energy or fuel to energy supply
merchants or energy users is jeopardized or disturbed to such an extent that energy
supply merchants cannot forecast and eliminate such a danger or disturbance in the
ordinary course of business.

The investor alleges that Latgales Energija was not heard before the energy crisis was
declared; decision No. 388 does not state otherwise; the Respondent has not rebutted

the Claimant’s allegation in this respect.

The first meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee took place on 9 October 2007 in the
afternoon. The Mayor asked Latgales Energija’s representative, Mr. Melnikovs,
whether Latgales Energija would be able to supply heating within 24 hours;!4!°
Latgales Energija answered that it needed to have the attachment lifted,!4!! whereupon
the Mayor requested Latgales Energija to supply heating within 24 hours, or the
Municipality would apply to the Regulator to have Latgales Energija’s licences
transferred to the Municipality. According to the minutes, Mr. Melnikovs reiterated

that the bank account must be unblocked. !4!?

During this meeting the Mayor announced that the Municipality was ready to provide
heat supply through Rézeknes Energija, the company that the City Council had just
set up and endowed with a capital of LVL 4 million loaned from the Treasury a few

days beforehand (see paragraphs 258 and 948 above; see also paragraph 968 below).

On 10 October 2007 the Mayor confirmed in writing the Municipality’s ultimatum in

order that Latgales Energija provide heating within 24 hours.'4'

The Municipality’s decision declaring an energy crisis was not challenged by Latgales

Energija before the Latvian courts.

The Tribunal must first determine whether it was a reasonable course of action for the

Municipality to declare an energy crisis.

The Claimant has confined itself to contending that the Municipality had requested
the start of the heating season on 1 October 2007 in Rézekne whereas the

Municipality of Livani had started three days later, but there is no evidence that the

‘HO C-145 [page 4].
‘411 Mr. Melnikovs appears to refer to a “counter-claim” in C-145 [page 5]; however, that was the
application for the discharge or the setting aside of the attachment, C-143, see also paragraph 304 below.
42-145 [page 6].
* C-145 [page 1].

 

281

961.

962.

decision to start the heating season in Rézekne was arbitrary or otherwise taken in bad

faith.

There is hardly any direct evidence as to the concrete effects of the interruption of
heating services on the population. The period for which Latgales Energija’s
difficulties have lasted (i.e. from 11 September to 17 October 2007) is based on an
admission made by Latgales Energija (see paragraph 259 footnote 289 above) which
was not challenged by the Respondent, which confined itself to alleging “non-
procurement by SIA ‘Latgales energija’ at all or in substantially insufficient service
level of heat to kindergartens, schools and the largest area of the Rézekne city (and so,

affecting adversely a huge population)”.!4!4

1415

The decision declaring an energy
crisis'*'> provides no information in this respect; the Regulator’s warning of 4 October
2007'4! refers to information as to insufficient heating provided by the

administration, i.e. the local Board of Education.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the declaration of an
energy crisis by the Municipality is not, in itself, an arbitrary decision, contrary to the
Claimant’s submissions. When it was declared on 9 October 2007, heating services
had been insufficient as from 11 September 2007 and the Municipality’s duty to act
cannot therefore be reasonably doubted. The Claimant has failed to indicate in
particular what other actions by the Municipality would have been more reasonable or

appropriate under the circumstances.

The Tribunal must next determine whether the energy crisis was declared in good
faith and whether the Municipality complied with Article 3(1) of the BIT in that
difficult situation. To answer those questions the Tribunal must consider three
specific points: (i) the ultimatum issued to Latgales Energija on 9/10 October 2007,
(ii) the fact that Latgales Energija’s bank accounts were attached further to Rézeknes
Siltumtikli’s proceedings brought against Latgales Energija and (iii) the sudden

emergence of Rézeknes Energija.

During the 9 October 2007 meeting of the Energy Crisis Committee Latgales Energija
was summoned to provide heating within 24 hours. That was a measure that would
hardly solve anything as Latgales Energija had stated during the meeting that it was
unable to provide heating services unless its bank account could be freed and used

again.

This calls for an examination of the attachment on Latgales Energija’s bank account

and the rise of Rézeknes Energija.

The fact that Rézeknes Siltumtikli had obtained an attachment on Latgales Energija’s
bank account on 21 September 2007 needs to be carefully considered in the context of
the Municipality’s ultimatum of 9/10 October 2007. The question is whether the
Municipality could in good faith request Latgales Energija to provide heating within
24 hours whilst it was aware of the fact that Latgales Energija’s bank account had
been attached further to the proceedings brought by the Municipality’s wholly-owned
Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Latgales Energija would be unable to provide heating unless

it was able to use its bank account.

It should be recalled that the Tribunal has already concluded that the Municipality
directed Rézeknes Siltumtikli to bring a suit against Latgales Energija in paragraph
830 above. The Tribunal considers that it follows that the Municipality’s ultimatum

was not issued in good faith on 9/10 October 2007.

The Tribunal further considers that the breach of good faith on the part of the
Municipality is compounded by the fact that on 25 October 2007 the Municipality and
Rézeknes Siltumtikli executed the October 2007 Agreement, which provided in its
first clause that the attachment had to be lifted (or the decision lifting the attachment

should not be challenged) as a matter of urgency.'4!7

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent’s contention that the October 2007 Agreement
did not give rise to enforceable obligations, but only to best-effort duties,'#!* is

without foundation as far as the duty to have the attachment lifted in accordance with

1417 C26, Clause (a).
4418 Resp. Rej. (23.

283

967.

968.

969.

Clause (a) is concerned. Such a contractual obligation was binding on the

Municipality and Rézeknes Siltumtikli in the Tribunal’s view.'*!?

The Tribunal considers that it is relevant that Rézeknes Siltumtikli acted in breach of
the October 2007 Agreement almost immediately after 25 October 2007 by
challenging the court decision that had discharged the attachment (see paragraph 290

above).

Such conduct is evidence of the Municipality’s readiness to take steps capable of

harming the investor’s position in Rézekne.

The Respondent’s contention that no party brought any proceedings in the Latvian

courts relating to the breach of the October 2007 Agreement is without merit.

Finally, the Tribunal must consider the sudden emergence of Rézeknes Energija, the
Municipality’s newly-constituted and wholly-owned subsidiary (see paragraphs 258
and 948 above). The Municipality announced in the afternoon of 9 October 2007 that
“[t]he Municipality has a mechanism to ensure heat supply — we are ready to provide

heat supply with the intermediation of municipality SIA Rézeknes Energija”.!4°

The Respondent explains that resort to Rézeknes Energija was simply a precaution
(see paragraph 947 above) intended by the Municipality to offer Latgales Energija an
opportunity to continue the business (paragraph 991 below) and a measure which was

within the Municipality’s discretion as a matter of Latvian law.

This is not, however, the more plausible explanation for the Municipality’s conduct in
the Tribunal’s view. One must consider, on the one hand, that the Municipality had

endowed Rézeknes Energija with a capital of LVL 4 million a few days before it

 

419 The October 2007 Agreement was made in a situation of crisis by all interested parties and it
contemplated the course of action to be followed; the first series of actions was to be taken within a week
of its date of execution (“Phase I”) and having the lifting of the attachment was the first item
contemplated by the October 2007 Agreement, Clause (a). Insofar as the Respondent contends that the
October 2007 Agreement made provision for further steps in Phase III which possibly included
amendments to be made to the Long-Term Agreement, that contention is accurate in itself, but it is not
dispositive in the present case, as the parties expressly agreed that the lifting of the attachment was the
first thing to be made; such duty was on Rézeknes Siltumtikli as the party having obtained the attachment
and on the Municipality as Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s sole shareholder, which was privy to the October 2007
Agreement.

declared the energy crisis, and, on the other hand, that the Municipality’s conduct in
relation to the attachment on Latgales Energija’s bank account disclosed an intention
towards the investor that was hostile. The decision to fund Rézeknes Energija with a
capital of LVL 4 million represented a “serious financial burden” according to the

Respondent’s own words.!4?!

The establishment of Rézeknes Energija was not,
therefore, simply a precaution; it was part of the Municipality’s plan to have another
company ready to take over Latgales Energija’s position practically at the same time
when the Regulator issued its warning to Latgales Energija that the licences might be

revoked.

The Tribunal finally considers that the Respondent has failed to explain in these
proceedings how a newly-established company devoid of any track record could be
considered as the most appropriate solution to bring the energy crisis to an end; all
employees of Rézeknes Siltumtikli had in fact been taken over by Latgales Energija in
2005 (see paragraph 112 above). The Respondent did not call any witnesses from the
Municipality or Rézeknes Energija to explain when the decision to incorporate
Rézeknes Energija was first considered and to explain the policy pursued by the

Municipality before and during the energy crisis.

One aspect of the discussions that preceded the finalisation of the heat supply
development plan for the City further confirms that the Rézekne City Council had
considered replacing Latgales Energija before the energy crisis was declared, when
two representatives of the Council suggested “editorial changes” in order to ensure
that Latgales Energija should be mentioned by name only once in the heat supply
development plan for the City, and that any further reference should be made

anonymously to the “operator” (see paragraphs 224 and 227 above).

This circumstance raises yet another inference that the Rézekne City Council had
already considered replacing Latgales Energija in or about early September 2007, and
that such prospect was concrete enough to influence the wording of the draft heat

supply development plan for the City as early as 11 September 2007.

When the declaration of an energy crisis was made on 9 October 2007 heating in
some schools had not been provided by almost a week. The Tribunal finds that the
fact that the Municipality declared an energy crisis without waiting until Latgales
Energija had answered the Regulator’s warning of 4 October 2007 is not per se a

breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Municipality
breached Article 3(1) of the BIT in October 2007, and especially after 25 October
2007, on the basis that the attachment of Latgales Energija’s bank account, considered
in the context of the energy crisis, and Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s repudiation of its duty
to have such attachment discharged (or not to challenge a decision lifting the
attachment) are attributable to the Municipality; the ultimatum issued by the
Municipality to Latgales Energija on 9/10 October 2007 was a measure inconsistent
with good faith and the announcement that its newly-established, wholly-owned
subsidiary Rézeknes Energija was henceforth ready to provide heating services in the
middle of the energy crisis appears to have been founded on prejudice or preference
rather than on reason or fact, i.e. was arbitrary in a manner inconsistent with Article

3(1) of the BIT.

f. The Regulator’s decision taking over Latgales Energija’s zone
(11 October 2007)

The Claimant complains that the Regulator’s decision of 11 October 2007 to take over
Latgales Energija’s zone was based on circumstances created by the Municipality and
the Regulator’s previous unjustified decisions; that such a decision was an act of
harassment against the investor; that such a decision was arbitrary and discriminatory
and amounts to a denial of due process insofar as the Regulation did not wait until
Latgales Energija had been able to answer the Regulator’s warning of 4 October 2007.
The Respondent takes the view that this decision was the consequence of Latgales
Energija’s inability to provide good-quality, uninterrupted heating services and that

such a decision was in accordance with Latvian law.'472

1422 The Respondent regards this as a “decision to suspend” the licences (Resp. Obj. J. & C-Mem.
{3.21(2)). This is inaccurate; a decision to suspend the licence is based on Sect. 18(7) of the Energy Act
whereas a decision to take over the territorial area of a service provider is based on Sect. 28 of the same
Act; the Regulator’s decision is stated to be based on the latter provision.

 

286

975.

The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 982 below.

On 11 October 2007 the Regulator decided to take over Latgales Energija’s zone
under Section 28(1)(3) of the Public Utility Regulators Act'*??.'44 The decision
indicated that the Ministry or the Municipality in charge would have to appoint a
person responsible for the utility under consideration in accordance with Section
28(2) of the Public Utility Regulators Act. As stated in the decision, such
appointment is temporary according to this provision. The Regulator’s decision is
based on the Rézekne City Council’s application of the same day informing the
Regulator that Latgales Energija had been unable to provide heating to six schools
and/or kindergartens upon the Council’s request of the previous day and that the
Regulator had therefore to decide whether to take over the zone; that decision called
for the respective interests of the public and Latgales Energija to be weighed, and the

scales came down in favour of the public interest.

'23 Sect. 28 of the Public Utility Regulators Act reads as follows (CLA-49):

(1) The Regulator shall take a decision on the necessity to take over the
territorial area of the licence of a provider of public utilities:

1) if the licence of the provider of public utilities is to be cancelled

(revoked);

2) if the term of validity of the licence of a provider of public utilities
expires in six months and the provider of utilities does not wish to
continue the provision of such public utilities for which a new
licence is required: or
if a provider of public utilities for some reason is unable to ensure
continuous, safe and qualitative public utilities.

(2) If the Regulator takes a decision to take over the territorial area of a
licence of a provider of public utilities, the Regulator shall, within 10
working days, notify the responsible ministry of the relevant regulated
sector or the relevant local government thereof. The responsible
ministry of the relevant regulated sector or the local government in
whose territory the provider of public utilities is located shall appoint
temporarily a person responsible for the public utilities determined in
the licence of the provider of public utilities in order to take the
measures to encourage merchants to take over the provision of public
utilities in the territorial area of the licence.

(3) In order to ensure the realisation of the activities determined in this
Section, the person responsible for the public utilities determined in the
licence of a provider of public utilities shall inform the Regulator or the
local government regarding the performance of his or her tasks and is
entitled to choose the methods for tendering, competition or selection
of applicants.

Latgales Energija’s applications to have that decision set aside were dismissed by the

Latvian courts.'*75

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant’s contention that the Regulator should have
waited until it had received Latgales Energija’s answer to the warning of 4 October
2007 may have some merit, but it is not dispositive. The Regulator’s 4 October 2007
warning did not relate to the taking over of Latgales Energija’s zone and the

Claimant’s argument is not, therefore, compelling in the Tribunal’s view.

Latgales Energija was not heard before the 11 October 2007 decision was made,

which is a procedural irregularity in the Tribunal’s view.

The decision to take over a licencee’s zone is a measure that has considerable effects
on the operator as a matter of Latvian law. This is shown not only by the
requirements which have to be met under Section 28(1) of the Public Utility
Regulators Act, which relate to situations in which the public interest is affected, but
also by the consequences which follow from such a decision, as the licencee is
replaced by another provider on a temporary basis. Such temporary appointment is
made according to Section 28(2) of the Public Utility Regulators Act “in order to take
the measures to encourage merchants to take over the provision of public utilities in

the territorial area of the licence”.

The Tribunal finds that although the Regulator’s decision amounts to a significant
interference with the operator’s position, it is relevant that two successive Latvian
courts dealt with Latgales Energija’s appeal or application for judicial review. The
Tribunal therefore finds that the Regulator’s 11 October 2007 decision does not

amount to a breach of due process amounting to a violation of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal further finds that the Regulator’s 11 October 2011 is neither arbitrary
nor discriminatory and does not amount to a breach of good faith. It is relevant that
Latgales Energija expressly admitted that the provision of heating was interrupted

and/or that it was insufficient from 11 September to 14 October 2007, as the Tribunal

425 R-3, see paragraphs 402 ff. above.

has recalle Such circumstances squarely fall within Section 28(1)(3) of the

Public Utility Regulators Act.

The_Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal denies the Claimant’s
complaint that the Regulator’s 11 October 2011 decision amounts to a breach of

Article 3(1) of the BIT.

g. The Rézekne City Council’s decision to appoint Rézeknes Energija
as the person in charge of providing thermal energy (12 October

2007)
The Claimant complains that the appointment of Rézeknes Energija was made in
breach of good faith and due process, was arbitrary and discriminatory and was an act
of harassment on the part of the Municipality. The Respondent replies that it was a
reasonable decision to make under the circumstances, and one which was within the

statutory discretion of the Municipality as a matter of Latvian law.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 987 below.

On 12 October 2007 the Rézekne City Council appointed Rézeknes Energija as the
person in charge of providing heating services in the City of Rézekne.'4?”7 The
appointment was temporary according to Section 28(2) of the Regulatory of Public

Utilities Act.'48

The appointment of Rézeknes Energija must be considered in the context of the
energy crisis declared by the Municipality taking into account the Municipality’s
conduct as a whole. The Tribunal has found, first, that the Municipality’s conduct on
9 and 10 October 2007 was not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT (see
paragraph 973 above); secondly, that the announcement in the middle of the energy
crisis that its newly-established Rézeknes Energija was henceforth ready to take over
the heating services was likewise not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT (see

paragraphs 973 above).

The appointment of Rézeknes Energija by the Municipality is the continuation and
achievement of measures that were not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the BIT. It
follows that such appointment is likewise not in accordance with Article 3(1) of the

BIT.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that the Municipality’s

appointment of Rézeknes Energija is a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

(vi) | The Claims Based on the Warning and the Revocation of the
Licences by the Regulator (4 October 2007/3 June 2008)
The Claimant claims that the Regulator ought to have suspended the licences and
granted Latgales Energija an opportunity to remedy any breaches of the licences as
may have been suspected before issuing a warning; instead the Regulator issued a
warning and then revoked the licences, which is a breach of due process. The
Claimant asserts that the Regulator revoked the licences in bad faith as the revocation
was based on events which did not amount to a breach of the licence conditions and
had, in any event, been caused by the Municipality. Finally, the Claimant argues that
the revocation of the licences was arbitrary and discriminatory. The Respondent
replies that Latgales Energija was sanctioned for its failure to provide continuous and
reliable heating services, and in accordance with the provisions of an investment
regime which it had accepted; the Claimant has only itself to blame for its failure to
carry out a proper due diligence with respect to the regulatory and commercial risks

inherent in the investment it made.

The Tribunal’s findings are set out in paragraphs 1000, 1004, 1024 and 1027 below.

On 4 October 2007 the Regulator sent Latgales Energija a warning stating that the

31429

licences might be revoked after 4 January 200: The Regulator’s warning

1429 C22. See also paragraphs 266 ff. above. The Regulator recalled that the licence holder had the
following duties under the conditions of the licences:

 

(i) Clause 1: to provide uninterrupted and good-quality public utility services (C-22 41);

(ii) Clause 7.1: by 31 December of each year, to submit a plan of activity for the following year in
accordance with its long-term development plan, including data about the planned amount of
production, transfer, distribution and sale of thermal energy and measures to improve quality
and safety (C-22 4 2);

(iii) Clause 7.2: by 31 March of each year, to submit a report regarding the results of the previous
year (C-22 | 3);

(iv) Clause 6.3: to prepare a long-term development plan (C-22 [ 4).

summoned Latgales Energija to provide explanations by 4 November 2007 on the

following breaches:

@ Latgales Energija had failed to submit the plan of operations for 2006 and

2007 in accordance with Clause 7.1 of the licence conditions;

(ii) Latgales Energija had failed to submit the results of 2005 and 2006 in

accordance with Clause 7.2 of the licence conditions;

(iii) the draft guidelines submitted to the Municipality on 19 December 2006 were
found to be incomplete and had not been approved, as a consequence of which
Latgales Energija had also failed to comply with Clause 6.3 of the licence

conditions; and

(iv) the Municipality and the Board of Education had stated that there was no
heating in three school institutions and heating problems in six other

institutions.

On 30 October 2007 Latgales Energija answered the Regulator’s warning contending
that the proceedings initiated with the warning should be brought to an end,
vigorously denying that the first three points set out above amounted to a breach, but
admitting in point of fact that it had experienced difficulties in providing
uninterrupted heating services from 11 September to 17 October 2007.'*° Such
difficulties could, however, be explained by the attachment obtained by the
Municipality and by Rézeknes Siltumtikli on its bank account which was a deliberate

action.

The Regulator’s warning was sent on 4 October 2007 in the middle of the energy
crisis; Latgales Energija’s answer was sent on 30 October 2007 after the supply of
natural gas had been resumed on 17 October 2007. The October 2007 Agreement was
made on 25 October 2007.

It is common ground that Latgales Energija in fact continued to provide heating

services despite the Regulator’s decision to take over Latgales Energija’s zone on 11

1430 C153,

291

992.

993.

October 2007 and the appointment of Rézeknes Energija as the person in charge of
providing those services on the following day. At the Hearing the Respondent
explained that Latgales Energija was given an “opportunity (...) to continue the
business” as Rézeknes Energija had been set up only to make sure that a solution
would be available in case there had been further problems in the supply of heating

services or Latgales Energija went bankrupt.'*!

The Tribunal has already noted in
paragraph 969 above that the Municipality’s alleged intention to give Latgales
Energija an opportunity to continue with the business was in fact contradicted by the
Municipality’s apparent readiness to take actions adversely affecting the investment in

breach of good faith.

On 29 November 2007 Latgales Energija informed the Regulator that it might find
itself in a situation in which providing heating services would be difficult or even
impossible due to the proceedings brought against it by Rézeknes Siltumtikli which

had resulted in an attachment of its bank account. !47

On 4 December 2007 Latgales Energija assigned its claims for payment against end-
users to LE Remonts (see paragraph 298 above). On 11 December 2007 the
Regulator objected to such assignment and requested Latgales Energija to explain the
situation, pointing out that several laws and regulations had been breached on the
basis that the invoices issued by Latgales Energija in November 2007 did not indicate
Latgales Energija’s bank account.'#** A further complaint related to the failure by
Latgales Energija to maintain accurate payment records. The Regulator pointed out
that such violations of applicable laws and regulations amounted to a further breach of
the licence conditions and could be a further ground upon which the licences could be
revoked. Latgales Energija’s failure to provide its long-term development plan was
pointed out again by the Regulator. Finally, the Regulator took the view that Latgales
Energija had transferred profits to its parent company in breach of Clause 5 of the

licences.

On 19 December 2007 Latgales Energija denied being in breach of any laws and

regulations in a detailed letter.'4+

On 20 May 2008 the Rézekne City Council put Latgales Energija on notice, inter alia,
that it had failed to invest the minimum amount of EUR 1.5 million in the first three
years of operation;'4*° Rézeknes Siltumtikli had directed the Rézekne City Council’s
and the Regulator’s attention to such circumstance on 15 May 2007.'476  Latgales
Energija replied that the Council’s letter was incomprehensible if account was taken
of the fact that Rézeknes Siltumtikli had not yet consented to the construction of the

building of a cogeneration station.'47

On 3 June 2008 the Regulator revoked the licences as a matter of urgency.'*** The

decision recalled the Regulator’s warning of 4 October 200
based on the reasons set out therein and a dismissal of the explanations provided by
Latgales Energija on 30 October 2007, in particular that the difficulties in providing

uninterrupted heating services had been caused by third parties.'4°

In addition, the Regulator rested its decision to revoke the licences on the following

reasons:

@ Latgales Energija had continued to pay only part of the invoices for the gas
used, which warranted the conclusion that Latgales Energija’s performance
fell short of its duty to provide good-quality and uninterrupted heating

services;!44!
(ii) Latgales Energija had sold heating services at non-authorised rates;

(iii) — Latgales Energija’s invoice to the end-users indicated a bank account of a third

party, which was a breach of the terms of the contract with end-users and of

and gave rise to multiple breaches of Latvian law; and

(iv)  Latgales Energija had failed to invest the minimum amount of EUR 1.5

million as stated in Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s letter of 15 May 2008.'4#?

It was therefore necessary to revoke the licences as a matter of urgency to protect the

end-users’ interest.

On 5 June 2008 Latgales Energija brought proceedings to have the Regulator’s
decision set aside; on 6 May 2010 Latgales Energija’s application was finally
dismissed. !443

On the Claimant’s first complaint based on breach of due process, the Tribunal notes,
as a preliminary point, that the revocation of a licence is the most radical sanction

“44 Which makes a clear distinction

contemplated by the Public Utility Regulators Act
between suspension (Section 18(7)) and revocation of a licence (Section 18(3)).
Further to the 4 October 2007 warning the Regulator directly imposed the revocation

of licences on 3 June 2008.'*45

However, it is relevant, and indeed dispositive in the Tribunal’s view that Latgales
Energija’s complaint was considered and dismissed by two successive Latvian

courts.'46

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that insofar as the
Regulator’s decision to revoke the licences is based on reasons stated in the
Regulator’s warning, there was no breach of due process as Latgales Energija was put

on notice of the Regulator’s position on 4 October 2007.

A further point must be addressed at this juncture since the Regulator rested its
decision to revoke the licences on further grounds than those set out in the warning
(see paragraphs 997 and 989 above) and the Claimant regards this too as a breach of
due process. In the Tribunal’s view, it is relevant, again, that the Regulator’s decision

was reviewed by the Latvian courts. In addition, the Tribunal notes the following.

 

date for the provision of public utilities has not been determined in
the licence).

(4) The Regulator shall give a provider of public utilities a written warning
notice regarding the amendments to the conditions of a licence at least
30 days in advance. In the case determined in Paragraph two, Clause 3
of this Section the Regulator shall determine the warning time period.

(5) The Regulator shall give a provider of public utilities a written warning
notice regarding the cancellation (revocation) of a licence at least three
months in advance. In the cases determined in Paragraph three, Clauses
3, 4 and 5 of this Section, as well as, when cancelling (revoking) the
licence in accordance with the Administrative Procedure Law, the
Regulator shall determine the warning time period.

(6) If a licence is cancelled (revoked), the State fee for the regulation of
public utilities paid by the provider of public utilities in accordance
with Section 30 of this Law shall not be reimbursed.

) The Regulator shall suspend the validity of a licence issued if there are
justified suspicions regarding the fact that the provider of public
utilities fails to comply with or violates the conditions of the licence
issued to it or the requirements for provision of public utilities
determined in regulatory enactments.

(8) The time period restrictions for the revocation of a lawful
administrative act determined by the Administrative Procedure Law
shall not be applied when making amendments to a licence or
cancelling (revoking) a licence in accordance with this Law.

(9) The Regulator shall take a decision regarding the issue of a licence,
cancellation (revocation) of a licence granted, refusal to grant a licence,
regarding the amendments to the conditions of a licence or suspension
or renewal of the validity of a licence within a month following the day
of the receipt of the submission and all the documents determined in
regulatory enactments or all the information necessary for taking the
decision.

Basic requirements of transparency and fairness require in principle that the Regulator
should set out the ground(s) on which it may ultimately revoke a licence in its
warning in a comprehensive manner; this is all the more so where the Regulator
decides not to suspend a licence and not to give the operator time to remedy a breach,
but issues a warning that may directly result in the operator’s licence being revoked.
If further grounds of revocation are then added by the Regulator in informal
correspondence, due process may be breached where the operator reasonably fails
fully to appreciate the significance of such correspondence or is not given an
opportunity to put its position before the Regulator as to such additional grounds for

revocation.

Having considered the detailed correspondence exchanged between the Regulator
and/or the Municipality on the one hand, and Latgales Energija on the other, in the
period between the warning and the revocation of the licences, the Tribunal must
examine two questions, namely (i) whether the operator was adequately informed by
the Regulator of any additional grounds capable of giving rise to the revocation of the
licences and (ii) whether the operator was given an opportunity to put its case before

the Regulator as to such additional grounds before the licences were revoked.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. Subsequent to the Regulator’s warning
Latgales Energija put its case to the Regulator in a detailed manner.'*4” The Tribunal
therefore finds that the Regulator’s decision to revoke the licences was not made in
breach of due process as Latgales Energija was given an opportunity to answer the
Regulator’s letters as well as the Municipality’s criticism. In addition, Latgales
Energija had an opportunity to put its case against the Regulator’s decision before two

successive Latvian courts.

The Tribunal must now turn to the Claimant’s second complaint that the Regulator’s
decision to revoke the licences was made in breach of good faith, which calls for an

examination of the reasons given by the Regulator for the revocation of the licences.

The first reason given by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences, already

set out in the Regulator’s warning, is the breach by Latgales Energija of its duty to

 

296

1007.

1008.

1009.

provide the Regulator with the plans contemplated by Clauses 7 and 6 of the licences.
There is no doubt that the Regulator has a duty to revoke a licence where the operator
is found to be in breach of the licence conditions (Section 18(3)(1) of the Public
Utility Regulators Act!*4*) and that the operator is bound to comply with the licence
conditions and provide the Regulator with the information required by such
conditions. The Regulator has also a duty to monitor compliance by the operator with

the licence conditions (Section 16(5) of the same Act).!44°

The licences were granted by the Regulator on 30 May 2005 and the information that
Latgales Energija had to provide to the Regulator was in principle due by
31 December of each year (Clause 7.1 of the licences) and by the first quarter of the
year (Clause 7.2 of the licences). Clause 6 of the licences does not set a time limit in

relation to the operator’s long-term development plan.

It is not in dispute that Latgales Energija failed to provide the Regulator with any of
the plans required by the licence conditions in 2005 and 2006. However, the
Regulator did not ask Latgales Energija to comply with the licence conditions, either
in 2005 or in 2006. The year 2005 was significant also because on 19 December 2005
the Regulator set a new tariff further to Latgales Energija’s application. Yet the
Regulator did not mention Latgales Energija’s failure to provide the plans

contemplated by the licences until the 4 October 2007 warning.

The Tribunal takes this to be an indication that the Regulator did not regard Latgales
Energija’s failure to provide the plans contemplated by the licences as a breach which
would be sufficient per se to attract the revocation of the licences, but that such a
failure was regarded as relevant only in the wider context of Latgales Energija’s
failure to provide uninterrupted heating services from 11 September to 17 October

2007.

In any event, the Regulator’s complaint, contained in the 4 October 2007 warning,

that Latgales Energija failed to provide the operator’s long-term development plan

448 CLA-49, quoted in paragraph 999 footnote 1445 above.
4 Sect. 16(5) of the Public Utility Regulators Act (CLA-49) reads as follows:

(5) The Regulator shall supervise the fulfilment of licence conditions and
the conformity of public utilities with licence conditions.

297

1010.

1011.

1012.

under Clause 6 of the licences appears unreasonable if account is taken of the fact that
the Municipality had issued its own development plan for the City only on 21
September 2007, with a delay which the Tribunal has found to be in breach of Article
3(1) of the BIT. Latgales Energija was entitled to be granted reasonable time after 21
September 2007 in order to provide the Regulator with its long-term development
plan. Latgales Energija’s failure to provide a long-term plan could not, therefore,
reasonably be considered on 4 October 2007 to be a ground upon which the licences

could be revoked.

Latgales Energija’s failure to provide the Regulator with the documents contemplated
by the licence conditions is therefore insufficient, in the circumstances described

above, to warrant the revocation of the licences.

The second reason given by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences,
already set out in the Regulator’s warning, is Latgales Energija’s failure to provide
uninterrupted heating services. The warning contains limited factual information as to

1450

the extent of the interruption in the heating services and so does the revocation

decision.!45!

After the Regulator’s warning of 4 October 2007 Latgales Energija had in fact
provided heating services for seven months and a half without any interruption, from
17 October 2007 onwards, until the licences were revoked on 3 June 2008 as a matter

of urgency.

The Tribunal concludes that the Regulator did not regard the interruption in the
provision of heating services, which was the main potential ground for revocation set
out in the warning, as a reason sufficient to revoke the licences; Latgales Energija
would not otherwise have been allowed to continue to provide heating services for a

period of seven months and a half.

It is therefore necessary to examine the further reasons, not set out in the Regulator’s

warning, on which the Regulator rested the decision to revoke the licences.

480 C2946,
451 C294 10.

298

1013.

1014.

1015.

1016.

1017.

1018.

The first reason for the revocation not mentioned in the warning is that Latgales
Energija had continued to pay and was still paying only part of the price for the
natural gas used, which had resulted in an interruption of the heating services and
which might be the cause of further interruptions in the future (see paragraph 997(i)

above).

The Tribunal finds that this was a ground on which the Regulator was reasonably

entitled to revoke the licences.

As found in paragraphs 935 and 936 above, the duty to pay for the natural gas
delivered was on Latgales Energija. The energy crisis had been directly caused by
Latgales Energija’s failure to pay the full price for the natural gas received and used
from June 2007 onwards.'#*? Latgales Energija did not deny that it had failed to pay
the full amount; it argued in its correspondence with the Regulator that the matter was
pending in court and the arrangement in place for the supply of natural gas was illegal
inter alia on the ground that Rézeknes Energija had not been licenced to sell natural

3
as. !453

gi

In June 2008 the Regulator was therefore justifiably insecure as to whether Latgales

Energija would be able, ready and willing to pay the full price for the natural gas.

The second reason relied upon by the Regulator that was not set out in the warning
was that Latgales Energija had been selling heating services at non-authorised rates on
the ground that the tariff approved by the Regulator on 11 November 2007 had been
revoked on 7 December 2007 and the 9 November 2007 tariff was therefore

inapplicable (see paragraph 997(ii) above).

The Tribunal dismissed the Claimant’s complaint that the Regulator’s 7 December
2007 decision was made in breach of due process and was arbitrary and contrary to

good faith in paragraphs 915 and 916 above. The Tribunal therefore finds that

reliance by the Regulator on such decision cannot amount to a breach of Article 3(1)

of the BIT.

 

299

1019.

1020.

1021.

1022.

1023.

The third reason relied upon by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences
that was not mentioned in the warning was that Latgales Energija’s invoices to the
end-users indicated a bank account of a third party, which was a breach of applicable
regulations in itself, and caused a number of further technical breaches of Latvian law

(see paragraph 997(iii) above).

The Tribunal finds that the Regulator’s position based on an alleged technical breach
of Latvian law is not consistent with bona fide reliance on a rational policy. Latgales
Energija’s assignment to LE Remonts was an attempt to overcome the effects of the
attachment of its bank account which the Municipality and Rézeknes Siltumtikli had
refused to have lifted, unreasonably and contrary to good faith as the Tribunal found
in paragraphs 964, 967 and 973 above, in order to continue to provide heating
services. The Regulator’s position was tantamount to endorsing, if not indirectly
supporting, the Municipality’s and Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s unreasonable conduct and
could not therefore be a sound basis for a decision made in good faith and based on a

rational policy.

The fourth reason relied upon by the Regulator in its decision revoking the licences
that was not mentioned in the warning was that Latgales Energija had failed to invest
the minimum amount of EUR 1.5 million as stated in Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s letter of

15 May 2008.!454

The Tribunal finds that the Regulator’s decision falls short of the requirements of
bona fide reliance on a rational policy since this was a purely contractual matter
between Latgales Energija and Rézeknes Siltumtikli.'4°° In addition, the Regulator’s
decision does not indicate how such a failure would be relevant under the applicable
law; nor does it indicate whether the Regulator made any findings of fact of its own
and the basis for such findings of fact, as the decision simply quotes from a letter by

Rézeknes Siltumtikli.

To sum up, the Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences on 3 June 2008 on the
basis of at least one sound reason, namely that Latgales Energija had failed to pay the

full price for the natural gas used in the past twelve months. This is a separate and

4454 C231, see paragraph 333 above.

455 See Clause 7.1.1 of the Long-Term Agreement, C-4,

300

1024.

1025.

1026.

1027.

1028.

1456

independent ground for revocation, therefore the Regulator’s decision does not

amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

Latgales Energija does not deny that it was still not paying the entire price charged for
the natural gas in its letter to the Regulator of 2 June 2008. Such a failure had already
been one of the main causes of the 9 October 2007 energy crisis. There was no reason

for the Regulator to believe that such a failure could not trigger a new crisis again.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal finds that Latgales Energija’s
failure to pay the full price of the natural gas received and used was a sufficient
reason upon which the Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences without
infringing the requirements of good faith. The revocation of the licences is not
therefore a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in itself. The Claimant’s claim must

therefore be dismissed.

The Claimant finally argues in a third complaint that the Regulator’s decision to

revoke the licences was arbitrary and discriminatory.

The Tribunal dismisses this claim. The Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences,
as found in paragraph 1023 above, on the basis that Latgales Energija’s failure to pay
the full price for the natural gas represented a risk likely to give rise to further
problems and disruption in the following winter season. That reason was clear and

sound; the Claimant’s complaint of arbitrariness and discrimination is without merit.

The_Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Claimant’s complaint that the
Regulator’s decision revoking the licences was arbitrary and discriminatory is

dismissed.

(vii) The Claims Based on the Municipality’s Conduct Subsequent to

the Revocation of the Licences (From 3 July 2008 Onwards)
The Claimant complains that the Municipality’s conduct subsequent to the
Regulator’s decision to revoke the licences is in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal will consider (i) the appointment of Mr. Locis by the Rézekne City

1456 See the approach of the NAFTA tribunal in Azinian v. Mexico, RLA-8 {| 104, in which the tribunal
found that certain Mexican judgments having annulled a concession were not arbitrary on the basis that
the cause of nullity could be rested on one ground.

Council as the person in charge of organising district heating, and the appointment by
Mr. Locis of Rézeknes Energija as the person temporarily in charge of the
transmission, distribution and sale, and of Rézeknes Siltumtikli as the person
temporarily in charge of the production of thermal energy, (ii) the Municipality’s
decision directing Latgales Energija to provide immediate access to the assets, (iii) the
decision authorising the forcible recovery of the assets, and (iv) the forcible recovery

of the buildings and the boilers.

a. The appointment of Mr. Locis by the Municipality as the person in
charge of organising district heating (13 June 2008) and the
appointment of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija as the
temporary producer, respectively provider and seller of thermal
energy (13 June 2008)

The Claimant complains that the Municipality’s attempts to appoint other individuals
or entities it owned to provide heating services in place of Latgales Energija were acts
of harassment and a breach of the Claimant’s expectations that the Municipality
would not seek to replace Latgales Energija and take over the heating system. The
preconditions for the appointment of Rézeknes Energija were not met and such
decision was made in breach of due process and in bad faith. The Respondent has not
commented in detail on the different measures taken by the Municipality subsequent
to the revocation of the licences; however, emphasis was placed by the Respondent on
the fact that the Municipality was under a duty ultimately to appoint an interim

provider for the heating in Rézekne.
The Tribunal’s findings are set out in paragraphs 1034 and 1036 below.

On 13 June 2008 the Rézekne City Council appointed its deputy executive director,
Mr. Ivars Locis, as the person in charge of organising the provision of heating in the
city of Rézekne.'**’ The decision indicated that such appointment was temporary,

pending the appointment of a new provider.

On the same day Mr. Locis, acting as the person in charge under the Council’s
Decision No. 270, made a decision (decision No. 1) as a matter of urgency and

appointed (i) Rézeknes Siltumtikli as the person temporarily in charge of the

 

4457 Decision No. 270, C-30.

302

1032.

1033.

production of thermal energy and (ii) Rézeknes Energija as the person temporarily in
charge of the transmission, distribution and sale of thermal energy.'*** The decision
stated that it would take effect forthwith and an application for judicial review would

not stay its enforceability.

There is no evidence that those decisions were challenged by Latgales Energija (see

paragraph 343 above).

The Municipality’s decision to appoint the person in charge of the provision of
heating supply in the City of Rézekne was stated to be based on Section 28(2) of the
Public Utility Regulators Act'*°? and was the consequence of the revocation of the

licences, which is not in itself a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

This decision does not, therefore, in itself constitute a violation of Article 3(1) of the

BIT.

The appointment of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija by Mr. Locis was
not only, however, one of the consequences following from the revocation of the

licences.'4

It represents the extension and the further formalisation of the
Municipality’s initiative taken back in September 2007 to replace the investor by a
local entity under the Municipality’s control (see paragraphs 968-969 and 973 above).
However, the Tribunal considers that since the decision to revoke the licences does
not constitute a breach of Article 3(1) of the Treaty, the measures taken by the
Municipality in June 2008 to implement that decision are not in themselves a breach

of this provision.
Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s claim.

b. The decision ordering Latgales Energija to provide immediate

access to the leased assets (14 July 2008)
The Claimant complains that the Respondent breached its expectations that Latgales
Energija would not be required to hand over the leased assets to the Municipality-
owned companies. The Claimant complains that the Municipality’s decision ordering
4458 C-181.

1459 CL,
1460 C_1g

|, see paragraph 975 footnote 1423 above.

 

303

1038.

1039.

Latgales Energija to hand over the assets represented an act of harassment; and that
that decision was also made in bad faith. Finally, the decision was made by
circumventing the procedure involving the “responsible person” and the Municipality
relied on its public law powers to that effect, in breach of due process, with a view to
regaining control over the heating system. The Respondent has not commented in
detail on the different measures taken by the Municipality subsequent to the
revocation of the licences; however, emphasis was placed by the Respondent on the
fact that the revocation of the licences and the appointment of interim providers for

the heating services meant that Latgales Energija had to return the assets.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 1047 below.

On 14 July 2008 the Rézekne City Council ordered Latgales Energija immediately to
provide access to the boiler houses to Rézeknes Siltumtikli and transfer any other
materials required for the production of heating to Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes
Energija.'4°!

The Rézekne City Council referred to Rézeknes Siltumttkli and Rézeknes Energija as
the “lawful providers of heating services” and recalled that Latgales Energija was no
longer entitled to provide heating services further to the Regulator’s decision revoking
the licences and no longer able to perform the Long-Term Agreement, for the
termination of which Rézeknes Siltumtikli had sent a thirty-day termination notice on
28 June 2008. On 27 June 2008 Mr. Locis had requested Latgales Energija to transfer
all leased assets on 7 July 2008 to Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija, but

Latgales Energija had refused to comply with that decision.

The Council concluded that, on the one hand, it followed from its duty to ensure
public heating that it had to ensure access to the heating supply system if the interests
of the residents of Rézekne were jeopardised. On the other hand, the rights of use
relating to public assets granted to Latgales Energija under the Long-Term Agreement
were not absolute and could be limited in certain cases, provided that such limitation
was justified by the public interest and complied with the principle of proportionality.

The Court found that the existence of a direct threat to the public interest made it

unnecessary to hear Latgales Energija on the basis that heating had been stopped on 3
June 2008, and both Latgales Energija’s views and prior conduct indicated that
Latgales Energija was opposed to the idea that Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes

Energija should be allowed to run the heating system.

The decision came into force forthwith, it was to be complied with as a matter of
urgency and it expressly stated that any application for judicial review filed with the

administrative courts would not stay its enforceability.

It is common ground that Latgales Energija refused to comply with this decision of its
free will.!4°
Latgales Energija’s application to have the 14 July 2008 decision set aside was

dismissed by the Administrative District Court on 25 May 2010.!4°

The Municipality decision of 14 July 2008 is not in itself contrary to Article 3(1) of

the BIT; the Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s claim.

The Claimant received no unqualified assurance from the Municipality that the Long-
Term Agreement would last for a period of 30 years; the Long-Term Agreement
contains in particular express terms under which it could be terminated by Rézeknes
Siltumtikli. Similarly, the Claimant received no unqualified assurance from the
Regulator that the licences would be in force for 20 years as they contained express
conditions and were stated to be governed by certain Latvian laws and regulations;
both the law and the express licence conditions contemplated events which might
result in the licences ceasing to be effective before the expiry of the 20-year period.
On this basis, the Claimant did not receive any unqualified assurance that the leased
assets would not be taken over before such periods had expired. The Claimant’s
claim must therefore be dismissed insofar as it is rested on a breach of the Claimant’s

legitimate expectations.

The 14 July 2008 decision appears to be one of the consequences ultimately following
from the Regulator’s decision to revoke the licences. The Municipality did not act in

bad faith in making that decision.

The Claimant’s complaint that the Municipality sought to bypass the prerogative of
the “person in charge” is without merit: by its decision of 27 June 2008 the “person in
charge”!*# had in fact ordered Latgales Energija to transfer all assets to Rézeknes
Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija, to which the Municipality’s decision presently
under consideration refers. Latgales Energija expressly declined to comply with that
decision as stated in its letter of 7 July 2008 on the basis that it had challenged both
the Regulator’s decision to revoke the licences and the Regulator’s decision to take

over its zone.!45

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s
claim.
c. The Municipality’s decision authorising the forcible recovery of the
assets (15 September 2008)
The Claimant complains that the Respondent breached its expectations that Latgales
Energija would not be required to hand over the leased assets to the Municipality-
owned companies and the Municipality’s decision authorising the enforcement of

such decision amounted to harassment in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 1050 below.

On 15 September 2008 the Rézekne City Council authorised the enforcement of its
decision of 14 July 2008 by forcible means.'4° The Council rested its decision on
Section 66 of the Administrative Procedure Act, stating that the use of force was
necessary due to Latgales Energija’s refusal to comply with the 14 July 2008 decision
of its free will, and considering that such was the only means to access the assets
leased to Latgales Energija under the Long-Term Agreement; there were no other less

intrusive means, and the resort to force was therefore proportionate.

1053.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s
complaint for the same reasons that are stated in paragraphs 1043-1045 above, mutatis
mutandis. The Municipality’s decision authorising the enforcement of its 14 July
2008 decision by forcible means is not in itself tainted by any breach of Article 3(1)

of the BIT, and it relates to a decision which is unobjectionable in itself.

d. The forcible recovery of the buildings and boilers (16 September

2008)
The Claimant contends that the use of armed police to enforce the Council’s decision
was an excessive and inappropriate exercise of public powers, especially considering
the fact that the decision to be enforced had been appealed; such excess amounts to a

breach of the standard of full protection and security under Article 3(1) of the BIT.'4%7

The Respondent counters that Latgales Energija had refused to comply with a
decision ordering that the assets be transferred and the Respondent was therefore left
with no choice but to enforce that decision; no actual force was used and no evidence

was provided by the Claimant as to the alleged use of force.'#°°

The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 1058 below.

Latgales Energija complained to the Administrative District Court that the forcible
enforcement of the 14 July 2008 decision was unlawful; the complaint was

dismissed.'*

The Claimant alleged that its personnel was forcibly evicted from Latgales Energija’s
premises!*”° and that “these executive decisions were enforced by armed local and
state police and the Municipality (through its wholly-owned company), who, on 16
September 2008, forcibly entered Latgales Energija’s premises, expelled its

employees and appropriated all of Latgales Energija’s assets used to operate the

recalled that Latgales Energija’s employees were “forced off the premises, and you

heard Ms. Uskane speak to that”.!47?

The Tribunal notes, first of all, that such allegation was not made in the proceedings
challenging the legality of the enforcement of the Rézekne City Council’s decision

No. 316 by forcible means.!47>

Ms. USkane was able to give evidence at the Hearing only as to the events in the main

administrative building and the customers’ services centre, not the boilers.

The main administrative building was taken over by police early in the morning
before the employees arrived for work; the locks were changed and the employees

were not allowed into the building.!4”*

The customers’ service centre was taken over a few days later when the employees
were working within and a representative of Rézeknes Energija ordered them to leave
the building immediately, or the police would evict them on the same day.'47> The
employees were able to liaise with management and decided to lock the building and

leave before the police arrived.'4”°

In her Witness Statement Ms. USkane further stated that the employees working at the
customers’ service centre were able to recover their belongings as well as documents
from their office a few days later (“... they allowed us peacefully and in a calm way

to take out our property and documents from the building”).!47”

Ms. U8kane’s Witness Statement mentions that the police officers carried guns
(“...the police were already there, with guns, preventing us from going into the
building...”).'478 Asked in cross-examination whether any guns were showing, Ms.

U8kane answered that she was told so, and then referred to what she saw a couple of

weeks later, when she drove by the customer service centre and saw a man standing

before the entry and carrying a gun or a weapon akin to a gun.'4”

At the Hearing, however, Ms. Uskane did not confirm that she had seen police

officers carrying guns.'48°

There is no allegation in Ms. USkane’s Witness Statement that any threats were made
against her, or any other employee, by any police officer showing a gun or removing a
gun from its duty holster. In cross-examination Ms. USkane confirmed that she was

not threatened with a gun.'48!

Ms. USkane added that that had been an unpleasant moment with the police'**? and

that they filed a complaint with the prosecutor’s office.!483

The Tribunal notes that the forcible recovery of buildings and boilers was made
pursuant to two decisions of the Municipality, made on 14 July and 15 September
2008, which the Tribunal found to be unobjectionable in themselves (see paragraphs
1043 and 1050 above), after Latgales Energija declined to comply with the decision

ordering that the assets should be returned to the Municipality.

The Tribunal finds that the intervention by the Latvian police was peaceful. The
Respondent has not challenged the Claimant’s allegation that police officers were
armed. No threats were made against any employee. Although it is understandable
that such an experience may have alarmed, and perhaps frightened, law-abiding
citizens not used to being confronted by police, the Tribunal finds that there is no
evidence of an excessive exercise of public powers. On the evidence before the
Tribunal, the forcible recovery of buildings and boilers remained entirely within the

confines of reasonable law enforcement.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The forcible recovery of buildings and
boilers does not, in itself, infringe the full protection and security standard of Article

3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s claim.

At this juncture the Tribunal will consider whether the Municipality’s conduct in 2007
and 2008, considered as a whole including those individual measures which the

Tribunal found unobjectionable, amounts to a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

(viii) The Cumulative Effects of the Respondent's Individual Actions

The Claimant claims that if the cumulative effect of the individual measures taken by
the Latvian authorities and the Municipality-owned companies is considered, the
Tribunal should make a finding of a creeping breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. The
Respondent’s defence is based on the proposition that the Claimant decided to make
the investment without any thorough due diligence and must therefore be taken to

have assumed identifiable risks in relation to certain aspects of the investment.

The enquiry advocated by the Claimant by definition includes acts and measures

which, seen in isolation, are not a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT. '484

In the present case, the first acts and measures considered by the Tribunal, following
the chronology, were found to be inconsistent with the obligations under Article 3(1)
of the BIT (in particular the delay by the Municipality to coordinate and approve a
heat supply development plan for the City, see paragraphs 886 ff. above; the
Municipality’s failure to direct Rézeknes Siltumtikli to have the attachment on
Latgales Energija’s bank account lifted, see paragraph 973 above; the Municipality’s
ultimatum in order that Latgales Energija provide heating services within 24 hours,
see paragraph 973 above and the establishment of a new wholly-owned subsidiary

with the intention to replace Latgales Energija, see paragraph 987).

However, other measures were found by the Tribunal to be unobjectionable under
Article 3(1) of the BIT as long as they were considered in isolation; the most

important measure is the revocation of the licences (see paragraphs 1004 and 1024

484 £1 Paso v. Argentina, CLA-39 ff 515 ff.

 

310

1064.

1065.

1067.

above) and the decisions taken subsequently to implement the revocation and have the

Assets returned to Rézeknes Siltumtikli.

The Tribunal finds that the approach advocated by the Claimant is appropriate as a
matter of law and that it is therefore appropriate to revisit the facts according to a

more global approach.

However, subject to the following paragraph, having considered the evidence as a
whole, the Tribunal is disinclined to find a global breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT in
the present case, as the Regulator’s final decision to revoke the licences was based on

a concern to protect the public interest and rested on at least one sound ground.

The Claimant is nevertheless entitled to succeed on its claim that the Municipality’s
actions justifying the claims which the Tribunal granted in paragraphs 887, 973 and
987 above amount to arbitrary measures impairing the management, maintenance,
use, enjoyment or disposal of its investment. In the above paragraphs, the Tribunal
has found that the conduct of the Respondent was arbitrary in a manner inconsistent
with Article 3(1) of the BIT. As to impairment of the management, maintenance, use,
enjoyment or disposal of the Claimant’s investment (as defined in paragraph 521
above) the conduct for which the Respondent is responsible is one of the principal
causes that ultimately resulted in the Claimant being unable to recover loans granted
to Latgales Energija and having to pay a guarantee in respect of Latgales Energija’s
unpaid debts to third parties. The Tribunal finds that such conduct and measures on
the part of the Municipality amount to arbitrary measures impairing the use,
enjoyment or disposal of the Claimant’s investment in breach of Article 3(1), second

paragraph, of the BIT.

(C) THE TRIBUNAL’s FINDING

The Tribunal therefore concludes that the Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the
BIT based on the specific findings in paragraphs 887, 973, 987 and 1065 above.

(4) CLAIM FoR EXPROPRIATION UNDER ARTICLE 4(1) OF THE TREATY

The Claimant complains that the Municipality of Rézekne combined with the
Regulator, Rézeknes Siltumtikli and Rézeknes Energija to give rise to an energy

crisis, for which the Regulator and the Municipality then sanctioned Latgales Energija

311

1068.

1069.

1070.

over a period of some twelve months, the ultimate sanction being the revocation of
the licences followed by the forcible recovery of buildings and boilers and the
termination of the Long-Term Agreement. These actions destroyed the value of the
Claimant’s investment. In addition, the Claimant complains of an outright
expropriation on 16 September 2008 as the Respondent forcibly took over the leased
infrastructure. The Respondent denies any breach of the BIT; it replies that the
recovery of buildings and boilers of 16 September 2008 was the lawful enforcement
required after Latgales Energija had declined to comply with the 14 July 2008

decision and surrender the assets.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 1101 below.
The Claimant’s definition of its investment covers two main points:

@ the shares in Latgales Energija, whose value was rendered worthless by the

Respondent’s actions and omissions; and

(ii) the loans and guarantees provided to Latgales Energija, which were not

 

reimbursed, as well as the payment of Rézeknes Siltumtikli’s debts and the

transfer of know how.

The Claimant contends that its investment in Rézekne was expropriated by the
Respondent in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT without prompt, adequate and
effective compensation; such expropriation was not in the public interest and was

discriminatory.
Article 4 of the BIT reads as follows:

Article 4
Expropriation and Compensation

1. Neither Contracting Party shall expropriate, nationalize or take similar
measures (hereinafter referred to as “expropriation”) against
investments of investors of the other Contracting Party in its territory,

unless:

a) such expropriation is in the public interest and legal procedure
is applied:

b) such expropriation is carried out without discrimination;

c) prompt, adequate and effective compensation is given.

312

1071.

1072.

1073.

2. The compensation mentioned in point (c) of the paragraph (1) of this
Article shall be equivalent to the market value of the expropriated
investments immediately before the expropriation occurred or the
impending expropriation became public knowledge and shall be paid
without undue delay. The compensation shall include interest
calculated on the LIBOR basis from the date of expropriation. The
compensation shall be effectively realizable and freely transferable.

3. Investors, whose assets are being expropriated, have a right to prompt
review by the appropriate judicial or administrative authorities of the
expropriating Contracting Party to determine whether such
expropriation, and any compensation therefor conforms to the
principles of this Article and the laws of the expropriating Contracting
Party.

4. Investors of one Contracting Party who suffer losses in respect of their
investments in the territory of the other Contracting Party owing to war,
a state of national emergency, insurrection, riot or other similar events,
shall be accorded by the other Contracting Party, treatment no k
favourable than that accorded to investors of any third State. Any
resulting compensation shall be paid without undue delay and shall be
freely transferable.

 

 

The Tribunal has to determine whether the Respondent expropriated the Claimant’s
investment directly, on 16 September 2008, or indirectly, in breach of Article 4(1) of
the BIT.

(A) THE APPLICABLE STANDARD OF TREATMENT

A State may expropriate an investment directly under Article 4(1), by transfer of title
(“outright taking”), or indirectly, by measures that fall short of a direct taking. This

last point is made clear by the expression “or similar measures” in Article 4(1).

The Tribunal considers that Article 4(1) offers protection in the case of so-called
“creeping expropriation”, where the host State achieves “the same result” as with an
outright taking of property.'48° As the Generation Ukraine tribunal observed, such
form of expropriation takes place in a situation where “a series of acts attributable to

the State over a period of time culminate in the expropriatory taking of such

property”. "486

1077.

Indirect expropriation requires a certain degree of interference with the investment on
the part of the State. Commentators have used various formulae to express this
requirement: in order to amount to expropriation, such interference has to be
unreasonable, to cause the investment to be neutralized or useless and to cause the
investor to be practically deprived, in whole or in significant part, of the use and

enjoyment of its investment.'4*”

The arbitral decisions involving indirect expropriation have similarly focussed on the
degree of State interference.'*** The test adopted by the Tecmed tribunal was whether
the investor “was radically deprived of the economical use and enjoyment of its
investments, as if the rights related thereto (...) had ceased to exist (...) the measures
adopted by a State, whether regulatory or not, are an indirect de fact expropriation if
they are irreversible and permanent and if the assets or rights subject to such measure
have been affected in such a way that “... any form of exploitation thereof ....” has
disappeared”.'*8° The Tecmed tribunal added a statement which is relevant to
shareholders’ claims: “Under international law the owner is also deprived of property
where the use or enjoyment of benefits related thereto is exacted or interfered with to

a similar extent (...)”.'49°

 

Tribunals have found that no indirect expropriation could be found to exist (i) where

1491

the State’s interference with the investor’s business was reasonable or (ii) where

the investor was still able to operate and benefit from its investment.'*? This

approach was followed in the BG Group award.'#°

In any event, the fact that an investment has become worthless does not per se mean
that there was an act of expropriation since investment always entails risk as observed

by the Generation Ukraine tribunal.'4°*

Certain tribunals have highlighted as a further aspect of the degree of State

interference the duration of such interference.'4°>

In order to determine whether the measures taken by a State amount to expropriation,
the effect of such measures on the investment is often regarded as a crucial test.
Whereas it has been said that “[t]he government’s intention is less important than the
effect of the measures on the owner of the assets”, some relevance must be attached to
intention, as observed by the Tribunal in paragraph 829 above, and any evidence of

expropriatory intention should be carefully weighed. '4"°

States have often raised the defence that where a general regulation enacted in the
public interest interferes with an investment, it is within the State’s “police powers”
and it does not amount to an expropriation under international law provided that it is
not discriminatory. Such a defence has been raised by the host State both in cases in
which the measure was in the form of a general regulation (such as in Pope & Talbot)
and in cases in which it is an individual decision made in relation to one particular

investor, such as a decision to revoke a licence or an authorisation (as in Tecmed).

The tribunal in Genin v. Estonia found that the revocation of a banking licence,
although it was stated to be based on very technical grounds, was neither arbitrary nor
discriminatory and was justified considering the serious and reasonable misgivings
expressed by the Central Bank of Estonia regarding the investor’s management, its

operations and its investments; the investor’s claims made under the US-Estonia BIT

were rejected, including a claim for unlawful expropriation.'*97

The NAFTA tribunal in Feldman v. Mexico stated that:!4°8

[I]t is much less clear [than defining direct expropriation] when governmental
action that interferes with broadly-defined property rights — an “investment”
under NAFTA, Article 1139 — crosses the line from valid regulation to a
compensable taking, and it is fair to say that no one has come up with a fully
satisfactory means of drawing this line.

In spite of this difficulty, investment tribunals, in particular since Saluka and
Methanex, have endorsed the principle that legitimate regulatory action cannot be
regarded as compensable “expropriation”. In this respect, in the Saluka case, the
tribunal held with reference to the BIT between the Netherlands, the Czech Republic
and the Slovak Republic that:!#°°
It is now established in international law that States are not liable to pay
compensation to a foreign investor when, in the normal exercise of their

regulatory powers, they adopt in a non-discriminatory manner bona _fide
regulations that are aimed at the general welfare.

It further found that:!5°°

[T]he principle that a State does not commit an expropriation and is thus not

liable to pay compensation to a dispossessed alien investor when it adopts

general regulations that are “commonly accepted as within the police power of

States” forms part of customary international law today.
As a consequence, the tribunal focused on the permissibility of the regulatory State
action which, in its view, removed it from the ambit of an indirect expropriation even
though in effect it destroyed the value of the investment affected.'°! As a result, the
forced administration of a bank in which the Dutch investor had invested was not

considered a breach of the prohibition against expropriation contained in the

applicable BIT.

The Saluka tribunal largely relied on the reasoning of the NAFTA tribunal in the

Methanex case which had held that:!°°?

[A]s a matter of general international law, a non-discriminatory regulation for a
public purpose, which is enacted in accordance with due process and, which
affects, inter alios, a foreign investor or investment is not deemed expropriatory
and compensable unless specific commitments had been given by the regulating
government to the then putative foreign investor contemplating investment that
the government would refrain from such regulation.

IPB”.

The Tribunal also notes that certain investment tribunals have considered that a

balancing of interests may be required. For instance, in LG&E the tribunal held:'°°°

In order to establish whether State measures constitute expropriation (...), the
Tribunal must balance two competing interests: the degree of the measure’s
interference with the right of ownership and the power of the State to adopt its
policies.

 

However, it then added (albeit, invoking a proportionality test, which is

controversial): !>°*

With respect to the power of the State to adopt its policies, it can generally be
said that the State has the right to adopt measures having a social or general
welfare purpose. In such a case, the measure must be accepted without any
imposition of liability, except in cases where the State’s action is obviously
disproportionate to the need being addressed. The proportionality to be used
when making use of this right was recognized in Tecmed, which observed that
“whether such actions or measures are proportional to the public interest
presumably protected thereby and the protection legally granted to investments,
taking into account that the significance of such impact, has a key role upon
deciding the proportionality.

(B) | WHETHER THE RESPONDENT IS IN BREACH OF ARTICLE 4(1) OF THE BIT

The Tribunal will first consider the Claimant’s claim that the investment was

expropriated on 16 September 2008 in breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.
The Tribunal’s finding is set out in paragraph 1098 below.

The recovery of the buildings and boilers by personnel of Rézeknes Siltumtikli and

local police that took place on 16 September 2008 cannot be viewed in isolation as it

was based on the Rézeknes City Council’s decision No. 449 of 15 September 2008!°°°

that allowed the enforcement of the Council’s previous decision of 14 July 2008'*°°
ordering Latgales Energija to surrender the assets; this decision was in turn based on
the Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision to revoke the licences.'*°? The Claimant has

itself relied on the date of 3 June 2008 as the “primary date for the expropriation of its

1508

investment” in support of its claim for damages. One must therefore consider

‘503 LG&E v, Argentina, CLA-31 { 189.

these decisions before deciding whether the 16 September 2008 events amount to an

unlawful expropriation.

The Tribunal finds that Latgales Energija was deprived of the right to provide heating
services in the City of Rézekne as a consequence of the Regulator’s 3 June 2008
decision;!°® the subsequent decisions were required simply to implement that
decision as Latgales Energija declined to surrender the assets of its own will. The
question is therefore whether the Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision was valid and
permissible as being within the Regulator’s regulatory police powers despite the
effects that it had on the Claimant’s investment. The Respondent has not rested its
defence on the concept of “regulatory expropriation”; however, that is in substance
the defence advanced by the Respondent when it argues that the Municipality and the
Regulator were entitled, as a matter of Latvian law, to take the measures they took
due to Latgales Energija’s failure to comply with the licence conditions and that such
measures do not amount to an unlawful expropriation contrary to Article 4(1) of the

BIT.

The Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences, discussed in paragraphs
1006 ff. above, is based on six main reasons. The Tribunal has found that the
revocation of the licences was not against good faith and that the Regulator was
entitled to revoke the licences on the basis that (i) Latgales Energija had failed to pay
the full price of the natural gas from June 2007 onwards, which is an admitted fact,
and (ii) Latgales Energija had a duty to pay for the natural gas used. The Regulator’s
finding that such a failure to pay could give rise to further interruptions in the

provision of heating services was not a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The reasons for which the Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision does not amount to a
breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT apply mutatis mutandis when one turns to the

question whether this decision amounts to a breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.

 

150° The Council’s 14 July 2008 decision states the following (C-33 [page 12]): “Thus, as it results from
Regulator’s decision No 10 of 3 June 2008, together with cancellation of the licences the Operator has
lost not only the legal grounds to provide heating, but it also cannot perform the activities included in the
subject of the Agreement”. The Claimant relies on this date too as the primary date for the expropriation
of its investment, Cl. Mem. { 344.

1095.

1096.

Having considered Latgales Energija’s failure to pay the full amount for the natural
gas over a twelve-month period, the Regulator was justifiably insecure that there
would be no further interruptions in heating services in the future. The Tribunal
therefore finds that the Regulator’s 3 June 2008 revoking the licences does not

amount to a breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal has already noted that the Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision is stated to
be based on a number of further reasons which the Tribunal finds not to be
persuasive; the presence of such reasons in the Regulator’s decision does not affect
the validity of the reason which this Tribunal finds to be a sufficient and valid ground

upon which the licences could be revoked.

The decisions made by the Municipality further to the Regulator’s 3 June 2008
decision revoking the licences, in particular the Council’s 14 June 2008 and
15 September 2008 decisions, are mere implementation measures which do not
constitute a breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT. The Rézekne City Council’s decision
of 14 June 2008 ordering Latgales Energija to surrender the assets is stated to be
based on the Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the licences'*!° and the

15 September 2008 decision!>!! orders the enforcement of the 14 June 2008 decision.

The Claimant’s submission that Latgales Energija’s shares were rendered worthless
by the actions of the local Latvian authorities is unproven in the Tribunal’s opinion.
This submission is based mainly on the proposition that Latgales Energija was
stripped of its licences and of its 30-year concession.'*!* However, the Tribunal has
found the revocation of the licences not to be inconsistent with Articles 3(1) and 4(1)
of the BIT. The burden on the Claimant is to prove (i) that Latgales Energija’s shares
are “worthless” despite the continued existence of this company, and (ii) that such
value is the result of the Respondent’s actions which the Tribunal has found to be in
breach of Art. 3(1) of the BIT. The Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to

discharge that burden.

The Claimant’s contention that the Respondent’s action caused the loss of the value of
the loans and guarantees issued in support of Latgales Energija’s business has been
dealt with by the Tribunal as a matter of Article 3(1) of the BIT (see paragraph 1140
below) and there is therefore no need to discuss this matter under the separate head of

expropriation.

The Tribunal’s Conclusion and Finding. The Regulator acted within its statutory
discretion when it revoked the licences. The Respondent’s measures did not therefore
constitute an unlawful expropriation contrary to Article 4(1) of the BIT on 16
September 2008 when buildings and boilers were taken over, on 15 September 2008
when the forcible enforcement of the 14 July 2008 decision was ordered, on 14 July
2008 when Latgales Energija was ordered to surrender the infrastructure or on 3 June

2008 when the licences were revoked.

The Tribunal further dismisses the Claimant’s claim for unlawful expropriation

insofar as it is based on an alleged creeping expropriation.

The Claimant has relied on the measures taken by the Municipality and/or the
Regulator, through action or inaction, from the beginning of 2006 until 16 September
2008. As the Tribunal found that the Regulator’s 3 June 2008 decision revoking the
licences and the Municipality’s 14 June and 15 September 2008 decisions do not
constitute a violation of Arts. 3(1) and 4(1) of the BIT, it may be doubtful whether
there is any scope left, as a matter of law, in order for the Claimant to argue that the
measures taken by the Respondent, considered as a whole, amount to a creeping
expropriation. The Municipality’s conduct in 2006 and 2007 and the Regulator’s
conduct in 2007 were unfair and inequitable in a number of respects and amount, in
any event, to arbitrary measures impairing the enjoyment of the Claimant’s
investment. Such breaches did not, however, have an expropriatory effect; in
particular, the Regulator’s 13 October 2006 decision dismissing the new rates
proposed by Latgales Energija was based inter alia on Latgales Energija’s failure to
substantiate its costs. If the Tribunal considers the Municipality’s and the Regulator’s
conduct in the wider context of a period ending on 16 September 2008, the conclusion

is the same.

(C) THE TRIBUNAL’s FINDING

1101. The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s claim based on a breach of Article 4(1) of the
BIT.

(5) CLAIMS FoR BREACH OF THE MOST FAVOURED NATION CLAUSE UNDER
ARTICLE 3(2) OF THE TREATY
1102. The Claimant finally complains of a breach by the Respondent of Article 2(2) and
Article 3(1) of the Latvia-Romania BIT"? which it considers applicable as a result of

the Treaty’s MFN Clause contained in Article 3(2) of the BIT.
1103. Article 3(2) of the BIT reads as follows:

Article 3
Protection and Treatment of Investments

2. Each Contracting Party, subject to its laws and_ international
agreements, shall accord to the investments made by investors of the
other Contracting Party treatment no less favourable than that accorded
to the investments made by investors of any third State.

1104. The relevant provisions of the Latvia-Romania BIT read as follows:'5!4
Article 2
Promotion, Admission
a) Gd
(2) When a Contracting Party shall have admitted an investment in its State

territory, it shall, in accordance with its national laws and regulations,
grant the necessary permits in connection with such an investment,
including authorisations for engaging top managerial and technical
personnel of their choice, regardless of citizenship, on a non-
discriminatory basis.

 

Article 3
Protection, Treatment

qd) Each Contracting Party shall protect within its State territory
investments made in accordance with its national laws and regulations
by investors of the other Contracting Party and shall not impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures the management,
i use, enj . extension, sale or li of such
investments. In particular, each Contracting Party or its competent
authorities shall issue the necessary authorisations mentioned in Article

2, paragraph (2) of this Agreement.

1112.

According to Article 2(2) and Article 3(1) of the Latvia-Romania BIT, the duty on the
host State to grant the necessary permits in connection with an admitted investment is
based on the law of the host State. Investment tribunals have interpreted similar
provisions contained in BITs as meaning that “[a]ll that an investor may expect is that

the law be applied”.!>!°
The Tribunal dismisses the Claimant’s claim based on the Latvia-Romania BIT.

First, it is doubtful that the concept of a “necessary permit” or “necessary
authorisation” “in connection with the investment” is to be interpreted and construed
so as to include the heat supply development plan for the City of Rézekne, which is
part of the management and planning duties of the Municipality; this document was
not, in any event, issued by the Municipality as a permit and does not represent an

authorisation allowing any particular action on the part of the Operator.

Secondly, it is similarly doubtful that the Regulator’s decisions approving a new tariff
proposed by Latgales Energija falls in the category of permits contemplated by the
provisions prayed in aid by the Claimant. The Claimant’s position has not been

substantiated in this respect.

Thirdly, any necessary permits have to be granted by the host State only “in
accordance with its national laws and regulations”. Therefore, the granting or issuing

of permits has to be made only provided that it is in accordance with national law.

Finally, the Tribunal has found that the Regulator was entitled to revoke the licences
as a matter of Latvian law and that such decision does not amount to a breach of

Article 3(1) and Article 4(1) of the BIT.

Thus, the Tribunal does not have to examine whether the MFN clause of the Treaty
may be read so as to allow the Claimant to invoke Article 2(2) and Article 3(1) of the

Latvia-Romania BIT.

The Parties have abstained from addressing this issue and the Tribunal notes that,

although the question does not concern the controversial Maffezini issue whether and

322

to what extent procedural benefits can be imported via an MEN clause, the specific
formulation of the MFN clause making a host State’s obligation to grant MFN
treatment “subject to its laws and international agreements” casts doubt whether it can
be relied upon to import standards contained in other treaties at all because it may be

limited to de facto treatment under national law.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON LIABILITY

The Tribunal finds that the Respondent has breached of Article 3(1) of the BIT as
found by the Tribunal in paragraph 1066 above.

QUANTUM

In this section, the Tribunal will first restate the Parties’ prayers for relief on quantum
(A) before summarizing the respective cases on quantum submitted by the Claimant
(B) and the Respondent (C). The Tribunal will then state the reasons for its decision

on quantum (D) before setting out its decision (E).

THE PARTIES’ PRAYERS FOR RELIEF ON QUANTUM

The Claimant sought damages in an amount of EUR 8,390,000.'5'© After the Hearing
the Claimant filed a third Expert Report in which this amount was reduced to

(2) THE RESPONDENT

The Respondent seeks the dismissal of the Claimant’s claim for damages.

THE CLAIMANT’S CASE ON QUANTUM

The Parties have approached quantum with expropriation and expropriatory breaches

in mind.

(dd) THE PRINCIPLES

The Claimant submits that Latvia’s expropriation of its investment was unlawful
according to the provisions of the BIT, which does not deal with compensation for
unlawful expropriation. Recourse must therefore be had to the principles of
customary international law and reliance is placed on the decision of the PCIJ in the
Factory at Chorz6w case and on Articles 31 ff. of the 2001 ILC Articles. Because the
BIT prohibits prima facie any expropriation and the Claimant’s investment has been
expropriated unlawfully, it follows that the compensation must not be limited to the
value of the undertaking; the Claimant is entitled to “full reparation” for the injury

caused by the Respondent’s internationally wrongful acts.!*?!

(A) CALCULATION OF THE CLAIMANT’S LOSS DUE TO UNLAWFUL
EXPROPRIATION
The Claimant submits that its investment in Latvia has been rendered worthless by
Latvia’s breaches of the BIT, as a consequence of which Latgales Energija was
stripped of its licences and its 30-year concession under the Long-Term Agreement.
The measure of the loss is represented by the difference between the value of Latgales
Energija, had those breaches not occurred, and Latgales Energija’s market value as at

3 June 2008 (or, alternatively, as at 16 September 2008).

The Claimant relies on Dr. Hesmondhalgh’s Expert Reports, based on a DCF analysis
in order to value E energija’s investment as at 3 June 2008; the total compensation for
the expropriation of the Claimant’s investment was of EUR 9,460,000 according to

Dr. Hesmondhalgh’s first Expert Report.!52? Dr. Hesmondhalgh reviewed Mr. Peer’s

‘521 Cl. Mem. {ff 326 ff.

first Expert Report and revised her estimate of damages downwards from
EUR 9,240,000 to EUR 7,970,000 (when using a 10% control premium) in her second
Expert Report; the amounts set out in Dr. Hesmondhalgh’s third Expert Report are
EUR 7,800,000 (when using a 20% control premium) and EUR 7,440,000 (when

using a 10% control premium).

The Claimant made a number of specific points in its Reply Memorial on quantum.
On the repayment of the loans, it contended that even if Latgales Energija had made
no profits after June 2008, the loans would have been repaid in the ordinary course of
business since the repayments were provided for by the heat tariffs.'°?> In relation to
the “ongoing administrative costs”, they would not have been incurred if Latgales
Energija had been permitted to continue with its business and operate the system. In
its Memorial the Claimant explained that such costs were incurred because it was “not

possible to initiate insolvency proceedings”,'*™4 an explanation which was not restated

in the Claimant’s Reply.!°?>

(2) | DAMAGE CAUSED BY BREACHES OTHER THAN EXPROPRIATION
(A) THE PRINCIPLES

Reliance is placed by the Claimant on Article 36 of the ILC Articles as the BIT does

not contain any provisions on compensation for a breach of Article 3(1).!°76

(B) | CALCULATION OF THE CLAIMANT’S LOSS DUE TO OTHER BREACHES OF

THE BIT

The amount calculated by Dr. Hesmondhalgh’s first Expert Report is of
EUR 9,820,000 (calculation with a 20% control premium) and EUR 9,240,000

(calculation with a 10% control premium); the calculation is the same as that relating

 

Dr. Hesmondhalgh’s first Expert Report calculates the full amount of compensation at EUR 9,820,000
and the amount of damages arising from the Regulator’s refusal to accept a new tariff at EUR 320,000.
The first Expert Report determined the market value of the Claimant’s 58% shares in Latgales Energija at
EUR 5,280,000 (based on a 20% control premium); in addition, compensation should include (i) the
revenue attributable to the sale of excess carbon credits (EUR 70,000), (ii) compensation for the written-
off loans and the called-upon guarantee in an amount of EUR 1,310,000 and EUR 1,860,000 respectively
and (iii) the costs to keep Latgales Energija in existence (EUR 940,000).

to the damages for unlawful expropriation, to which an amount of EUR 360,000
(calculation with a 20% control premium) is added for loss of revenue due to Latvia’s
breach of the provisions of the BIT before the date of expropriation with respect to the
heat supply development plan for the City and the Regulator’s refusal to set a new
tariff in 2006.'°?7 Dr. Hesmondhalgh reviewed Mr. Peer’s first Expert Report and
revised her estimate of damages downwards from EUR 9,240,000 to EUR 7,970,000

(when using a 10% control premium) in her Second Expert Report.

THE RESPONDENT’S CASE ON QUANTUM

The Respondent submits that the overwhelming part of the damages claimed by the
Claimant are based on inflated alleged future cash flows as the Long-Term Agreement
was capable of generating nil in cash flow; the Claimant has failed to prove that its
business was profitable at all.'°°8 Reliance is placed on Mr. Peer’s First and Second
Expert Reports. The Respondent further submits that the Claimant has failed to show
that the remaining part of the alleged damage was caused by the alleged breach of the
BIT, and objects that the Claimant’s approach is further flawed by attempts at double-
counting and a disregard for the mitigation duty binding on any claimant.'*?? The
Respondent has not further dealt with the Claimant’s case on quantum and has

referred to KPMG’s First and Second Expert Reports.

In a Post-Hearing Brief the Respondent submitted that the dispute had been finally
settled under the terms of a Settlement Agreement entered into by the Claimant and

Rézeknes Siltumtikli on 25 October 2007.!5°°

THE REASONS FOR THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON QUANTUM

(dd) THE PRINCIPLES

The Tribunal found that there is no compensable expropriation in the present case, but

that the Respondent has breached Article 3(1) of the BIT! in a number of

respects. !52

‘527 Cl. Mem. {ff 358 ff.

Obj. J. & C-Mem. 2.1 ff.

  

326

1127.

1128.

1129.

The provisions of the BIT deal with compensation in relation only to expropriation
(Article 4(1) and (2) of the BIT); they are silent, in particular, as to compensation for

breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Respondent’s breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT amount to an internationally
wrongful act as this provision gives rise to an international obligation on the
Respondent and the Tribunal has found the breaches of this provision to be

attributable to the Respondent (Article 2 of the ILC Articles!***).

Under Article 31 of the ILC Articles the State responsible for an internationally
wrongful act must make “full reparation for the injury caused” by such act; that is also
the principle set out by the PCIJ in the Factory at Chorzéw decision.'**+ In the
present case it is common ground that reparation must take the form of financial

compensation or damages.

Financial compensation of the damage caused by an internationally wrongful act
“shall cover any financially assessable damage including loss of profits insofar as it is

established” (Article 36(2) of the ILC Articles).

In order to be recoverable, the damage must have been caused by the State’s
internationally wrongful act complained of by the investor, Article 31 of the ILC
Articles. Causation is, similarly, a requirement in the PCIJ decision in the Factory at
Chorz6w decision as expressed by the formula “as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and re-establish the situation which would, in all

probability, have existed if that act had not been committed”.!**> The requirement of

1532 The most important breaches are as follows: (i) the delayed approval of the heat supply development
plan for the City in the period from 20 January 2006 to 20 September 2007; (ii) the Regulator’s inability
to consider Latgales Energija’s proposals for a new tariff in 2007 caused by the delayed approval of the
heat supply development plan for the City; (iii) certain aspects of the Municipality’s conduct during the
October 2007 energy crisis.

causation has been applied in a number of awards in investment disputes.'**° The

burden of proof in relation to causation is on the Claimant.!>*”

(A) THE PRINCIPLES APPLIED

The Tribunal must first deal with the Respondent’s contention that the “financial
differences” between the Parties were finally settled under the terms of a Settlement
Agreement made by the Claimant and Rézeknes Siltumtikli on 25 October 2007.!578

The Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s defence.

This agreement states that Rézeknes Siltumtikli shall pay the Claimant an amount of
some LVL 600,000 and that five days upon receipt of such payment the Claimant
shall cancel certain notes registered in the Land Registry with respect to the real estate
owned by Rézeknes Siltumtikli. Clause 3 of this agreement provides that following
such payment the Claimant “shall have no claims to property” of Rézeknes

Siltumtikli.

The Respondent’s contention that the Parties settled all their differences “under legal
documents concluded up to that date” and that this agreement “gives a wide reference
to settling all claims in general”!**? is based on an impermissible reading of such
agreement that does not contain any expression to the effect that all claims between
the Claimant and Rézeknes Siltumtikli had been finally settled. The Agreement of 25
October 2007 has a subject-matter which is expressly and narrowly defined in relation
to a payment intended to permit the cancellation of a note (akin to a charge, a lien or a
mortgage) relating to land, and it settles any claims that the Claimant may have had
against property of Rézeknes Siltumtikli. There is no connection between this
agreement and the claims made by the Claimant against the Respondent in this

arbitration.

The expert opinions relied upon by the Claimant are entirely based on the proposition

that the Claimant was the victim of an unlawful expropriation in June 2008. The

328

1133.

1134.

Tribunal finds that this approach is accordingly of little assistance given the finding
that the revocation of the licences was justified and does not amount to a compensable

expropriation.

The non-expropriatory damage was dealt with as a fraction of the overall damage
caused by the alleged unlawful expropriation and the Regulator’s refusal to accept a
new tariff in the period from October 2006 to October 2007, corresponding to an

amount of EUR 360,000 according to the Dr. Hesmondhalgh’s first Expert Report.

The Tribunal must next consider the Claimant’s contentions that “Latvia is in breach
of various treaty obligations, all of which stem from the same set of facts and produce
the same end result: E energija’s investment in Latvia has been rendered completely

worthless by the actions of the local Latvian authorities”!>*°

and that, with specific
reference to Latvia’s breaches of the BIT provisions other than Article 4(1), “the
damages flowing from the expropriation of E energija’s investment overlap to a large
degree with those flowing from Latvia’s other breaches of the BIT”!*4! and that
“Latvia’s breaches of the Fair and Equitable Treatment standard, including the
obligation of full security and protection, and its application of arbitrary and

discriminatory measures all resulted in the same outcome: Latgales Energija’s

licences were stripped from it and the Long-Term Agreement terminated”. !>47

The Claimant thereby contends in essence that the damage it suffered is the same,
whether the Tribunal finds that there was an unlawful expropriation or a creeping
breach of the fair and equitable treatment standard having expropriatory effects, the
assumption being that the Tribunal will find at least one or the other. The Tribunal
finds this approach to be inconsistent with its findings whereby the Regulator’s
revocation of the licences was justified and whereby only certain actions or omissions
of the Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT; the Tribunal did not, in particular,
find that the Respondent’s actions were expropriatory if their cumulative effect was

considered.

It is a matter for the Claimant to prove the damage caused by the Respondent’s

breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal will first examine whether the Claimant has established that the

Respondent’s breaches of Article 3(1) caused its alleged lost profits.

The Tribunal has considered in particular the following facts: (i) the infrastructure of
the heating system in Rézekne was old and dilapidated (Mr. Strioga characterised the
Rézekne situation as being a “terrible technical situation”);'°*? (ii) Latgales Energija

admittedly did not replace the “Soviet-type old boilers” in Rézekne,'**+

apart perhaps
from the installation of one new Viessmann boiler, but concentrated essentially on
repairs and maintenance;!*#> (iii) the Municipality’s heat supply development plan for
the City contemplated the reconstruction of boiler houses, but spelled out that the
operator’s “investment into the reconstruction of heating boilers should not affect the
increase in tariffs” as it was the Municipality’s expectation that gas consumption for
generation and auxiliary heating consumption would drop significantly after the
reconstruction;!*“° (iv) the Long-Term Agreement and the February 2005 had opened
a new page in the history of local administration which had not ever dealt with a
private investor before 2005, and the contracts signed by Latgales Energija contained
few specific assurances with respect to the Claimant’s investment on the part of the
Municipality, and none on the part of the Regulator that was not privy to such
contracts; and (v) cogeneration was not covered by the contracts signed by Latgales
Energija and the terms of such contracts do not warrant a finding that the Municipality
was under a contractual duty to Latgales Energija to proceed with a cogeneration

project, as the Tribunal has found.

Having considered the evidence as a whole, the Tribunal is satisfied that the Claimant
has not discharged its burden of proof in relation to the existence of future profits.
The Tribunal has also found that the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of

proof in relation to the allegation that Latgales Energija’s shares have become

worthless due to the breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT found by the Tribunal (see
paragraph 1096 above).

The Tribunal finds that the Claimant is entitled to compensation for the actual proven
losses (damnum emergens) suffered as a consequence of the Respondent’s breaches of

Article 3(1) of the BIT.

The Tribunal rejects the claim relating to the “administrative costs” to maintain
Latgales Energija after 3 June 2008 or 16 September 2008. The Claimant has failed
to give a compelling explanation for what appears to be essentially a commercial
decision made in its own interest to continue to fund Latgales Energija, rather than a
decision dictated by requirements of Latvian law; if any such requirements dictated

such decisions, the Claimant has failed to discharge its burden of proof in this respect.

The Claimant has considered the damage caused by the Respondent’s breaches of
Article 3(1) of the BIT separately from the damage caused by the alleged unlawful
expropriation only to a limited extent, namely under the heading of the “2006/2007
damages”.'*4” These damages are to compensate the Claimant for the losses allegedly
suffered as a consequence of the Regulator’s 13 October 2006 decision denying
Latgales Energija’s proposal for a new tariff. However, the Tribunal found that the
Regulator’s 13 October 2006 decision does not amount to a breach of Article 3(1) of

the BIT. The Tribunal therefore dismisses this claim.

The Tribunal must next consider the amount of EUR 3,170,000,'%4* represented by

0,'549 and a guarantee

loans made to Latgales Energija in an amount of EUR 1,310,00
paid to Danske Bank in respect of Latgales Energija’s debts, in an amount of EUR
1,860,000.'°°° These figures were not challenged by the Respondent or the
Respondent’s expert.!°>!_ The Respondent has objected that Latgales Energija would

estimates'>’~ and that there was no evidence that the Claimant had paid the amount of

the guarantee to Danske Bank.

The Tribunal regards such figures as representing an actual loss suffered by the
Claimant and finds that they are therefore recoverable in principle. The Respondent’s
first objection is therefore without merit insofar as it fails to take into account the

distinction between actual losses and lost profits.

As to the Respondent’s second objection relating to the payment by the Claimant of
the amount of the guarantee provided to Danske Bank, such objection has already

been dismissed by the Tribunal (see paragraph 410 above).

The Tribunal must now determine whether the Claimant is entitled to a sum of
EUR 3,170,000 in consideration of the fact that, on the basis of the totality of the
evidence before the Tribunal, such loss arises from a conjunction of different causes.
Whereas the Tribunal has found that the Municipality significantly contributed to the
difficult situation in which Latgales Energija found itself, and did so deliberately and
in breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, the Tribunal has also found that the Claimant’s
losses were caused by the fact that Latgales Energija’s heating business came to an
end due to its decision to stop paying the full price for the natural gas used and the
revocation of the licences by the Regulator that followed, which the Tribunal found

not to amount to a breach of Latvia’s obligation under the BIT.

The Tribunal must therefore determine to what extent the Claimant’s actual loss was
caused by the Respondent’s breaches of Article 3(1) of the BIT. Having weighed all
the evidence examined in the present Award, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant and
the Respondent have contributed to the losses suffered by the Claimant to an extent
that is, all in all, broadly equivalent and that the Claimant should therefore be awarded

50% of the actual losses mentioned above.

The Tribunal therefore awards the Claimant a sum of EUR 1,585,000 (50% of
EUR 3,170,000) as financial compensation for the damage caused by the

Respondent’s internationally wrongful act.

(2) INTEREST
(A) THE CLAIMANT’S PosITION

The Claimant contends that the Tribunal should depart from Article 4(2) of the BIT
insofar as this provision contemplates a calculation of interest based on the LIBOR
basis with respect to the compensation to be paid by the Respondent for a lawful
expropriation; the Claimant argues that a departure from this provision is justified on

the basis that its claim is for unlawful expropriation.

1553

The date from which interest should be awarded is the date of expropriation'>’’ or the

date on which the loss was incurred.'*>+

The Claimant argues that the LIBOR rate has dropped so considerably after 2008 as to
be inappropriate for the calculation of interest. The Claimant suggests a rate of
interest that reflects the interest that it must pay on its borrowings, to be compounded
quarterly. Interest should be awarded at the following yearly rates and should be
compounded quarterly: 6.58% for 2008, 4.36% for 2009, 3.73% for 2010, 4.13% for
2011 and 2.56% for 2012 until the date of the final award, and at the rate of 2.56%,
compounded quarterly, from the date of the award until payment by the

Respondent.!*95

(B) | THE RESPONDENT’S POSITION

The Respondent has not answered the Claimant’s case on interest.

(C) | THE TRIBUNAL’s REASONS

The Tribunal finds that interest on the sum awarded is due and the Tribunal is
satisfied that the rates claimed by the Claimant are more appropriate than the LIBOR
rate; the Respondent has not challenged those rates. In any event, the LIBOR rate
applies to expropriation under Article 4(2) of the BIT and the Tribunal has found that
there is no compensable expropriation in the present case, so that there would be no

compelling reason to apply a LIBOR-based interest in the present case.

1155.

The Claimant’s case for compound interest has remained unchallenged throughout
these proceedings. The Tribunal finds that simple interest would not represent
reparation for the injury caused. The Tribunal will therefore award compound
interest. The Tribunal notes, however, that the Claimant has not provided any
substantive reasons in support of its claim that interest should be compounded
quarterly other than the proposition that “any interest should be compounded
quarterly, since to award simple interest would not reflect commercial reality”.!°°°. In
the absence of any reason that justifies granting quarterly compounding, the Tribunal
takes the view that annual compounding would be appropriate in view of recent trends

in investment arbitration.

The date from which interest is awarded is 1 January 2008 as the Claimant has failed

to indicate any interest rate for the year 2007.

(D) — TRIBUNAL’S FINDING ON INTEREST

The Tribunal awards interest on the sum of EUR 1,585,000 as from 1 January 2008,
to be compounded annually, at the following rates: 6.58% for 2008, 4.36% for 2009,
3.73% for 2010, 4.13% for 2011 and 2.56% for 2012 until the date of the final award,
and at the rate of 2.56%, compounded annually, from the date of the award until

payment by the Respondent.

THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON QUANTUM

The Tribunal awards the Claimant a sum of EUR 1,585,000 (one million five hundred
eighty-five thousand Euro) with interest thereon as from 1 January 2008, to be
compounded annually, at the following rates: 6.58% for 2008, 4.36% for 2009, 3.73%
for 2010, 4.13% for 2011 and 2.56% for 2012 until the date of the final award, and at
the rate of 2.56%, compounded annually, from the date of the award until payment by

the Respondent.

COSTS

The Claimant’s prayer for relief with respect to its costs is set out in paragraphs 442

and 443 above. The Claimant sought an award of costs in a total amount of

EUR 3,083,279.25, including a success fee, or, alternatively, an award of costs in a

total amount of EUR 1,688,928.85, without a success fee.

The Respondent’s prayer for relief with respect to its costs is set out in paragraphs
447 and 448 above. The Respondent sought an award of costs in an amount of no less

than EUR 166,555.28.
The Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties
otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with
the proceedings, and shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees
and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the
facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

 

Article 47(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules states that the award shall contain any

decision of the Tribunal regarding the cost of the proceedings.

Absent agreement between the Parties, the Tribunal has broad discretion under these

provisions to decide which Party bears the costs of the arbitration and to which extent.

The Tribunal must exercise its discretion judicially and consider the Parties’ positions
as a whole. Prof. Reinisch has set out the criteria which a tribunal should take into
account in the exercise of its discretion in his dissenting opinion and the Tribunal is
broadly in agreement with the presentation of such criteria. The main question arising
for determination in the present case is not, however, what such criteria should be, but

how they should be applied to the circumstances of the present case.

The Claimant succeeded with its claim for a breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT, but its
claim for breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT as well as all other claims were dismissed.
All claims were made to seek compensation for one and the same alleged damage.
The Claimant’s success on its Article 3(1) claim was clear-cut, especially in so far as
the Municipality’s delay in dealing with the heat supply development plan was
concerned. The further aspects of this claim required a number of facts to be
disentangled and analysed in relation to the conduct of the Municipality in the context
of the October 2007 energy crisis, but the breach of Article 3(1) of the BIT by the

Municipality found by the Tribunal was similarly a clear breach.

The assistance which the Respondent provided to the Tribunal was limited, not only
due to the brief pleadings which discussed the documentary evidence in the most
perfunctory manner, but also to the absence of any witnesses presented by the

Respondent to explain the Municipality’s conduct.

The Claimant succeeded with its claim for damages only to an extent of
approximately 15-22% (depending on whether one considers the amount of the
original claim for EUR 7 million or the higher claim for EUR 9.82 million, excluding

the claim for costs).
Each Party has defended its case in good faith in these proceedings.

In these circumstances and considering that the claims were not frivolous, were
pursued and defended in good faith and with all due expedition, the Tribunal
considers that the Claimant is in principle entitled to be awarded costs and finds that
the Respondent should be ordered to pay a fair share of the Claimant’s costs. The
Tribunal determines that such fair share shall be 50% of the costs incurred by the
Claimant, to the exclusion of any success fee, subject to an examination of the

amounts claimed.

The costs of the arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal and

ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

EUR 744,946 (legal fees and expenses of Salans/Vinson & Elkins), EUR 300,478
(legal fees and expenses of Sorainen), EUR 29,462 (Dr. Blumberga’s Expert Opinion)
and its share of the costs of the arbitration USD 421,470.21 (ICSID/Tribunal) plus the
lodging fee (USD 25,000); ie. a total amount of EUR 1,074,886.00 and
USD 446,470.21. The Tribunal makes no award of costs with respect to the Expert
Reports of Dr. Hesmondhalgh. This amount in turn represents 43% of the amount of

costs and fees claimed by the Claimant excluding any success fee.

AWARD

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

qd) The Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction are denied; the Tribunal has
jurisdiction to hear the Claimant’s claims under Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Article 7(2) of the BIT.

(2) The Respondent breached Article 3(1) of the BIT.

(3) The Respondent shall pay the Claimant compensation in the amount of

EUR 1,585,000 (one million five hundred eighty-five thousand Euro).

(4) The Respondent shall pay the Claimant compound interest on the amount of
EUR 1,585,000.00, compounded annually, at the following rates: 6.58% for
2008, 4.36% for 2009, 3.73% for 2010, 4.13% for 2011 and 2.56% for 2012
until the date of the present Award; and at the rate of 2.56%, compounded
annually, from the date of the present Award until payment by the

Respondent.

'557 The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the parties in proportion to the payments that they
advanced to ICSID.
