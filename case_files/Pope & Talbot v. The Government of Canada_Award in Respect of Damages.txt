A. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

1. The Tribunal issued its Award on the Merits of Phase 2 on April 10, 2001. As,
in that Award, the Tribunal determined that Canada had breached its obligation
to the Investor under Article 1105 of NAFTA in relation to the Verification
Review Episode, and found Canada liable to the Investor for the resultant
damages, it was necessary to proceed to a consideration of damages.

2. On April 20, 2001, the Tribunal made an Order setting out the procedure to be
followed in. this phase. That Order allowed for both parties to furnish a
Statement of Claim and Memorial or Answer to the Statement of Claim and
Counter Memorial as the case might be. The Tribunal indicated that unless one
of the parties requested an oral hearing the Tribunal expected to deal with this
part of the proceedings on the materials submitted, but it reserved meantime
two days in November 2001. In the event, the Investor indicated that it wished
to have an oral hearing.

3. While the procedure set out in the Order of April 20, 2001 was in train, the
NAFTA Free Trade Commission (“Commission”) on July 31, 2001 made an
interpretation in relation to Article 1105 (the “Interpretation”). This was sent
to the members of the Tribunal by Canada, and on August 14 the Tribunal
asked both parties to make their positions clear as to the effect of the
Interpretation on the present case by August 31, 2001 and September 10, 2001.

4. In light of the responses from the parties, the Tribunal on September 17, 2001
invited further responses by way of clarification and asked for further

2

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:16 NO.889 05/43

information. The parties did so. Both Mexico and the United States submitted
observations under Article 1128 and requested to attend the hearing. The
hearing had originally been fixed for two days in. November 2001, and the dates
were refixed for three days (November 13, 14 and 15, with a continuation if
necessary on November 16). The parties agreed that issues as to damages would
be treated first and issues as to the matter of the Interpretation be dealt with
commencing November 15.

5. A hearing took place on 13, 14 and 15 November. The Investor was represented
by Mr. Barry Appleton and Mr. Ian Laird. Canada was represented by Mr. Brian
Evernden, Ms Meg Kinnear and Prof. Don McRae. Each party led two witnesses.
For Pope & Talbot they were Mr. Abe Friesen and, as expert, Mr. Howard Rosen.
For Canada they were Mr. Dennis Seebach and, as expert, Mr. Jeffrey Harder.
Each witness was cross examined. Representatives of Mexico and the United
States attended throughout.

6. At the conclusion of the hearing the parties were invited to submit post hearing
submissions relating to the damages issue only. Both Mexico and the United
States sought and were granted leave to make post hearing written submissions
on. the Interpretation issue. Those submissions were duly made, and the parties
miade additional submissions in response thereto.

7. It is appropriate to deal first with issues raised in relation to the Interpretation

and its bearing on this arbitration before considering issues of damages.

LORD DERVALRD +01372c00644 31/03 '02 09:16 NO.889 06/43

Accordingly, the next several sections deal with those issues and the later
sections deal with the remainder of the case.

B. INTERPRETATION BY THE FREE TRADE COMMISSION OF
NAFTA ARTICLE 1105

8. The Tribunal reached its decision on Article 1105 on April 10, 2001 and held
that the conduct of Canada in relation to what was called the Verification.
Review Episode breached Canada’s obligation to the Investment under Article
1105: “Each Party shall accord to investments of investors of another Party
treatment in, accordance with international law, including fair and equitable
treatment and full protection and security.” The interpretation of Article 1105
by the Tribunal is set out in the Award on the Merits Phase 2 at paragraphs
105-118 and its application to the facts put forward by the Investor at
paragraphs 120-185.

9. Briefly, the Tribunal determined that, notwithstanding the language of Article
1105, which admittedly suggests otherwise, the requirement to accord NAFTA
investors fair and equitable treatment was independent of, not subsumed by the
requirement to accord them treatment requixed by international law. The
Tribunal believed that this interpretation was compelled for three reasons: First,
Bilateral Investment Treaties (BIT's”) concluded by the NAFTA Parties provide
in many instances that investors must “at all times be accorded fair and
equitable treatment * * * and shall in no case be accorded treatment less than
that required by international law.” Since investors from countries signatory to

those treaties were thus entitled to fair and equitable treatment without regard
4

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:16 NO.889 07/43

10.

1

to any limitations that might be inherent in international Jaw, NAFTA investors
could claim the same rights under the most favoured nation provisions of Article
1103. Consequently, the Tribunal concluded that it would make no sense to
deny those rights under Article 1105, only to find them revived pursuant to
Article 1103. Secondly, the Tribunal believed that the NAFTA Parties were
unlikely to have intended, in Article 1105, to treat each other's investors less
favourably than those from other countries. Finally, the Tribunal noted that
Article 1102 required each NAFTA Party to accord to other Parties’ investors
treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own investors, a standard
obviously unlimited by any conditions that might be incorporated into
international law standards.
After the Tribunal issued its conclusions on these matters, the Commission on
July 31, 2001, adopted the Interpretation which, as far as relevant to this
arbitration, includes the following:

Having reviewed the operation of proceedings conducted under Chapter

Eleven of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Free Trade

Commission hereby adopts the following interpretations of Chapter

Eleven. in order to clarify and re-affirm the meaning of certain of its
provisions...

B. Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with
Intemational Law

1. Article 1105 (1) prescribes the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum

Canada pointed out that, in this case, the Investor had withdrawn its claim under

Article 11.03, but that fact is not material to a proper interpretation of Article 1105.

5

LORD DERVAIRD 401312200644 31/05 '02 09:16 NO.889 08/43

standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors
of another Party.

2. The concepts of “fair and equitable treatment” and “full
protection and security” do not require treatment in addition to
or beyond that which is required by the customary international
law minimum standard of treatment of aliens.

11. On August 10, 2001, without comment, Canada sent the Interpretation to the
members of the Tribunal. On August 14, 2001 the Tribunal wrote to the
parties in the following terms:

As Canada has not advised the Tribunal of what it believes to be the
implications of the Commission’s interpretation for this proceeding, the
Tribunal requests both parties to submit their positions on the following
questions:
(1) Should the Commission’s interpretation be considered to
have retroactive effect on rulings previously made by
NAFTA Tribunals?
(2) If the interpretation is to have a retroactive effect,
(a) Should the interpretation change the result reached in this
proceeding by the Tribunal with regard to “the verification

episode?”

(b) If the answer to (a) is in the affirmative what would be the
implications of Article 1103 on the Tribunal’s ruling?

12. Having received responses from both parties the Tribunal on September 17,
2001 sent a further fax to the parties in, inter alia, these terms:

However it would be of assistance for the Tribunal to obtain certain
further clarification and information from Canada.

In the first place, the Tribunal notes the failure of Canada to respond to
the Tribunal’s question with regard to the implications of Article 1103 on
the NAFTA Commission’s interpretation of Article 1105, arguing solely

LORD DERVAIRD

+01312200644 31/05 '02 09:17 NO.889 09/43

that the Investor had abandoned its right to press a claim based on Article
1103.

As the Commission’s Interpretation must have been intended to apply to
future cases where waiver might not apply (and would not, unless given
retroactive effect, even apply to this one) the Tribunal again requests
Canada to provide an answer to the question. The Tribunal’s view is well
known — the Commission’s interpretation would, because of Article 1103,
(in the words of Article 32 of the Vienna Convention) produce the absurd
result of relief denied under Article 1105 but restored under Article 1103.
Nevertheless the Tribunal wishes to know Canada’s view on this
question before coming to a final conclusion in response to the
Commission’s interpretation.

In the second place, the Tribunal believes that the effects of the
interpretation could depend upon what the Commission considered to be
the effects of its interpretation. Without pre-empting at this time the
implications properly to be drawn it appears to the Tribunal that if the
Commission, viewed its Interpretation to have retroactive effect on this
case, its actions could be viewed as seeking to overturn a treaty
interpretation already made by a NAFTA Chapter 11 Tribunal, Canada
acting both as disputing party and as a member of a reviewing body.
Consequently the Tribunal wishes to know what caused the Commission,
to take action in this manner and what the members were told about the
effects of their action on this case.

The Tribunal accordingly seeks specifically answers to the following:

(1) When and by whom was the matter of the interpretation of
Article 1105 first raised with the Commission?

(2) Were the Commission members told that Canada would argue
that their interpretation would have any effect in this case?

(3) Was the Commission presented with any basis for their
interpretation apart from the language of Article 1105? For
example was atty negotiating history provided for their
consideration?

(4) Was the Commission advised of possible conflict between the
interpretation it was asked to adopt (or proposed to adopt) and
Article 1103?

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:17 NO.889 10/43

The parties (and the other NAFTA Parties) were invited to submit comments.
13. After receipt of responses from the parties, the Tribunal sent a further fax to
them on October 23, 2001 containing the following:

[The Tribunal] considers that its deliberations at and after the hearing
would be assisted if the parties would address the following points on the
issue of the NAFTA Commission’s Interpretation in relation to Article
1105.

1. In respect that the Tribunal is required by Article 1131 to
decide the issue in dispute in accordance with the NAFTA
Agreement and applicable rules of international law, and it may
be taken as a rule of international law that no-one shall be
judge in his own cause, and that the purpose of this arbitral
mechanism is under Article 1115 to assure due process before
an impartial tribunal, is it correct for the Tribunal to apply an
interpretation by the Commission so as to affect an award
previously made by the Tribunal whereby it has determined an
issue in dispute (namely Canada’s liability for a breach of
Article 1105) adversely to Canada?

2. Assuming for the purposes of these questions that the
Interpretation is to be taken as binding on the Tribunal with
retroactive effect on its ruling in respect of the verification
issue, and that the Tribunal holds that its earlier ruling is
“inconsistent with” or “contrary to” the interpretation. of the
Commission on Article 1105, by what standard is customary
international law to be ascertained?

3. In particular, since Article 1105 (1) states that the concepts of
"fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security”
are to be taken as included within the principle of treatment in
accordance with international law and the Interpretation is to
the effect that these concepts do not require treatment in
addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary
international law minimum standard, what is to be taken, as
the content of these concepts as part of customary intermational
law at the time that the NAFTA was negotiated?

LORD DERVALRD +0131¢2200644 31/05 '02 09:17 NO.889 11/43

4. Views are also invited on the applicability of Article 1102 to the
verification issue on the basis of the facts found by the
Tribunal. The parties are referred to paragraph 117 of the award
by the Tribunal.

14. In response to a fax from Canada dated October 25, 2001 the Tribunal made it
clear, on October:26, 2001, that it was concerned about both Articles 1102 and
1103.

15. NAFTA Article 1131: “Governing Law” provides:

1. A Tribunal established under this Section shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Agreement and applicable rules of
international law.

2, An interpretation by the Commission of a provision. of this

Agreement shall be binding on. a Tribunal established under this
Section.

16. In light of the issues raised by the parties and argued before the Tribunal the
principal issues that arise for determination by the Tribunal are the following:
(1) Is the Interpretation put forward by the Commission a valid exercise
of the Commission’s power of interpretation and so binding on the
Tribunal?

(2) If so, what effect does the Interpretation have-in relation to awards
already made by a tribunal (the retroactivity issue)?

(3) The construction and application of the Interpretation.

(4) The nature and content of customary international law in the context
of Article 1105, and its application to the facts of this case.

Each of these will be discussed separately.

LURU DERVALRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:18 NO.889 12/43

C. I$ THE INTERPRETATION PUT FORWARD BY THE
COMMISSION A VALID EXERCISE?

17. Whether the Commission acted within its powers in making its Interpretation
arises in this way. NAFTA Article 2001(2) states:
The Commission shall;
(a) supervise the implementation of this Agreement,
(b) oversee its further elaboration,

(c) resolve disputes that may arise regarding its interpretation or
application;

(e) consider any other matter that may affect the operation of this
Agreement.

And under Article 1131(2) of NAFTA, an interpretation by the Commission of a
provision of the Agreement "shal. be binding on a Tribunal established under
this Section [B of Chapter Eleven].”
18. At the same time, NAFTA makes separate and different provision in respect of
amendment of the Treaty. Article 2202 provides:
Amendments

1. The Parties may agree on any modification of or addition to
this Agreement.

2. When so agreed, and approved in accordance with the
applicable legal procedures of each Party, a modification or
addition shall constitute an integral part of the Agreement.

19. Accordingly, a modification or addition to the Agreement has to proceed by way

of amendment, whereby the Parties must first agree to the modification or
10

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:18 NO.889 13/43

20.

8

addition, and each Party must then obtain formal approval in the appropriate
way for that Party, to make such, a modification or addition effective.

In this case, the Interpretation made by the Commission, states that Article
1105(1) prescribes the “customary international law” minimum standard of
treatment, whereas the text of that Article refers rather to treatment in
accordance with “international law.” It is well accepted that the content of
“international law” is a good deal broader than “customary international law.”
Article 38 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice” makes it clear that
there are four sources of international law, of which custom is only one.

On that basis, the Investor argued that what the Commission had done was to
amend Article 1105(1) by inserting the word “customary” before “international
law” and thus limiting international law for the purposes of Article 1105 to one
only of its sources. In support of this contention, it produced to the Tribunal a
submission made in another NAFTA Chapter 11 proceeding in which the
claimant contended that the word “customary” was actually deleted from one of
the negotiating texts of NAFTA, and, that at that time, the U.S. negotiators
Pointed out that “deleting the word would expand the coverage of Article 1105

by bringing in other legal obligations ...”* In the same submission the Methanex

tribunal was referred to an opinion by Sir Robert Jennings in which he describes
the Interpretation as “amending the treaty to curtail investor protection.’
Against that Canada argued that the Interpretation was to be regarded precisely
as what it stated it was. At earlier stages of this case, the Tribunal itself had
made an interpretation of Article 1105, and so what the Commission had done
could properly be said to be within the proper limits of what constituted
interpretation.’ Canada took the further point that it was not within the powers
of an arbitral tribunal under Chapter Eleven to challenge that which was issued
by the Commission as an interpretation of a provision of the NAFTA. Whether
others might in other ways challenge an interpretation as outside the powers of
the Commission, such jurisdiction had not been conferred on a tribunal, for
which an interpretation is binding by virtue of Article 1131(2).°

The Tribunal finds the latter argument unpersuasive, Article 1131(1) requires
an arbitral tribunal under Chapter 11 to decide the issues in dispute in
accordance with NAFTA and applicable mules of international law. If a question
is raised whether, in issuing an interpretation, the Commission has acted in
accordance with Article 2001, an arbitral tribunal has a duty to consider and
decide that question and not simply to accept that whatever the Commission

has stated to be an interpretation is one for the purposes of Article 1131(2).

24, This Tribunal must therefore consider for itself whether the Commission’s
action can properly be qualified as an “interpretation.” That question will, of
course, depend on what a proper interpretation of Article 1105 might be. In aid
of resolving that question, the Tribunal early on sought to determine whether
there is a body of negotiating history relating to Article 1105 that might be
relevant and, if so, to secure those documents. In this connection, it is
necessary to review what has transpired to that end.

D. NEGOTIATING HISTORY

25. The interpretation of Article 1105 has proved to be particularly difficult for
various tribunals and, indeed, for the NAFTA Parties themselves. This Tribunal
has grappled with the stark inconsistencies between the provisions of BITs and
corresponding commitments in Article 1105.” Other tribunals have laboured
over the relationships between Article 1105 and other commitments in Chapter

11 as well as commitments made by the NAFTA Parties in other agreements.*

7 See, Award on the Merits of Phase 2, April 10, 2001 at 11 105 — 185.

s See, ¢.g., Metalclad Corp. and Mexico, Award, August 25, 2000 at 11 76, 99 - 101
(failure to provide transparent system of regulation of investment denied investor fair and

T ional law as d by Article 1105); reversed in part,
United Mexican States v. Metalclad Corp., 2001 BCSC 664 at 19 62, 72 (“international Jaw”
under Article 1105 means “customary” international law; Chapter 11 contains no obligations
to provide transparency). See also, $.D. Myers, Inc. and Canada, Partial Award, November 13,

international Jaw i tules designed to protect i ; denial of nati t
under Article 1102 can be a violation of Article 1105).

With these cases in mind, one is bound to agree with Fox and Deane: “The initial
arbitral and judicial considerations of Axticle 1105 have been remarkably divergent.” Foreign

the North American Free Trade Agreement, paper submitted to The Global Construction

LORD DERVAIRD +01512200644 31/05 '02 09:19 NO.889 16/43

And the NAFTA Parties themselves found it necessary to promulgate the
Interpretation.’

26. Against this background, it is beyond argument that the original texts of Article
1105 and other provisions of Chapter 11 contained ambiguities that had to be
resolved by those charged with interpreting those texts. In such cases, it is
common and proper to turn to the negotiating history of an agreement to see if
that might shed some light on the intentions of the signatories.'° Given the
ambiguities in Article 1105, that inquiry was one that this Tribunal would have
been required to make at some point in these proceedings.

27. In the event, the matter of negotiating history arose at an early stage in the
proceedings. During the hearings in Montreal in November, 2000, the Tribunal

sought to investigate the inconsistencies it saw between the BITs and Article

 

Superconference, London, Nov. 5-6, 2001. That divergence must, in large part, be due to
ambiguities in the text of the provision.

° That Interpretation, at the very least, was intended to clarify what the NAFTA Parties
oust have seen as an ambiguity in the words “international law’ in Article 1105; the
clarification consisted of adding the word “customary” as a modifier. Had the NAFTA Parties
not perceived an ambiguity, no interpretation would have been necessary. The Tribunal must
note, however, that, of all the problems of interpretation of Article 1105, the scope of the term
“§nternational law” should be the least troubling, since that term is plain on its face and is
defined in the Statute of the ICJ.

10 See Article 32, Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties:

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the
preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order ”

** to the ing when the inter ding to Article 31:
(a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous ox obscure; or
{b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

14

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:19 NO.889 17/43

1105. At that time it asked Canada whether the different formulations were
intentional or accidental.'' In response, Canada referred the Tribunal to a
submission of the United States, which asserted that the difference was the
product of a conscious decision by the NAFTA Parties to change the approach in
the BITs.’*

28. It was then that the Tribunal asked Canada and, through it, the other NAFTA
Parties whether travaux preparatoires” existed that might support the
contention of the United States or otherwise shed light on the matter.'* Relying
on the assurances of counsel for Canada that they did not,’ the Tribunal
proceeded on that basis.’ It did, however, ask the question again in a written

request, which produced the same result.'”

" The Tribunal’s request was made in a faxed letter to the disputing parties dated Sept.
17, 2001, after the Interpretation of the Free Trade Commission in which it asked Canada to
advise, inter alia, whether the Commission had been presented with any material related to the
interpretation, including “negotiating history.” None of the NAFTA Parties responded to this
question and none provided any negotiating history.

ig

During the November 2000 hearing, counsel for the Investor reminded the
Tribunal that he had previously been advised officially that travaux regarding
NAFTA did not exist, basing his statement on a letter his office had received
from DFAIT dated May 5, 1997.'°
That letter bears examination. It was sent by the Coordinator for Access to
Information and Privacy, purportedly in. response to a request for documents.
The requested documents covered all of NAFTA, not just Chapter 11, and
included minutes and records of negotiating meetings and agreed negotiating
texts.
DFAIT’s response to that request stated:
[T]his will confirm that, apart from the actual NAFTA Agreement
which is in the public domain, there are no minutes or records of
NAFTA negotiating meetings, nor any mutually agreed negotiating
texts, which have been or can be released publicly.
On its face, that language could admit two interpretations - (1) the documents
do not exist or (2) they do (or might) exist but cannot be released publicly.
However, Canada’s Access to Information Act ("ATIA") resolves this ambiguity.
Section 10 of the ATIA provides that when the government refuses to provide a
document other than on the basis that it does not exist, it must tell the

requester —

where the head of the institution does not indicate whether a record

to be based if the record existed.

that one of the principal Chapter 11 negotiators for Mexico recalled that various
versions of Article 1105 were circulated and discussed among the negotiators.?”

declaration giving his recollection of the negotiations and stating his assumption

that the drafts he recalled would be found in the “negotiating history”

issue related to the meaning of “international Jaw” in Article 1105. The recollection of the
Mexican negotiator was that a draft of the article using “customary” as a modifier had been
considered and rejected by the negotiators. The United States denied the assertion that there
‘was a negotiating draft containing the word “customary” but said nothing about the existence
of negotiating history. See submission of the United States to the Methanex tribunal dated

Canada.” In response, the United States made the following statement:

[The] recollection [in the declaration is] unsupported by any of the
travaux that Mexico or counsel for the United States could locate
after a diligent search. Moreover, * * * travaux such as those that do
exist for the NAFTA “must be used with caution. . . on account of
their fragmentary nature.”

Mexico also challenged the declaration after its “search of its records of the
negotiations,”*

36. The next contribution to this matter came from Investor's counsel in this
proceeding. By letter dated February 20, 2002, he advised the Tribunal that, in
proceedings under NAFTA Chapter 20, the NAFTA Parties admitted to the
existence of travaux. Specifically, one Chapter 20 tribunal stated:

Canada also relies on the text of the NAFTA more broadly, on. the
travaux preparatoires of the NAFTA, on various other statements

and documents said to indicate the intention of the Parties in the

period of the negotiations * * *?”

Another such panel. observed that:

Based upon much of the foregoing, the Tribunal requested Canada to produce a
“record of discussions leading up to agreement upon the final text of Article
1105 of NAFTA, whether such record consists of negotiating drafts or any oth =r
matters * * *,”9

That request produced, on April 12, 2002; the submission by Canada of some
1,500 pages of documents, reflecting over 40 different drafts leading up to the
version of Article 1105 that appears in NAFTA.”

The implications of those documents for the interpretation of Article 1105 are
described elsewhere in this Award. It is adequate here to say that the Tribunal
knows that having the documents would have made its earlier interpretations of
Article 1105 less difficult and more focused on the issues before it. In this
sense, the failure of Canada to provide the documents when requested in
November 2000 was unfortunate. Forcing the Tribunal to chase after the
documents as it did is not acceptable.

Recall that, in November 2000, counsel for Canada told the Tribunal:

Letter to the disputing parties dated March 21, 2002,

The documents consisted solely of the various drafts of what came to be Chapter 11.

There is almost certainly additional material that was available to the Parties during the
negotiations, reflecting various views on these drafts, as well as other documents that bear on
those views.

Let me make it easy for everybody. I have been in three or four of
these cases, so I happen to know if there are travaux preparatoires,
and I can tell you that I have not been able to find any."
That assertion was, to put it generously, uninformed. Recall also that DFAIT
had earlier told counsel for the Investor that there were “no mutually agreed
negotiating texts.’”** That assertion was simply wrong.
Canada has not told the Tribunal where the documents resided, or how a
diligent search would have failed to find over forty iterations of Chapter 11. The
documents themselves show that Canada possessed them at one time. It is not
credible that negotiators would have forgotten their existence. Surely the other
NAFTA Parties would have been willing to refresh recollections and provide
copies. If Canada did not want to release them, it surely knew how not to do so,
as the very letter transmitting the documents to the Tribunal included a refusal
to provide other documents. Finally, it is almost certain that the documents
provided, which included nothing in explication of the various drafts, are not all
that exists, yet no effort was made by Canada to let the Tribunal know what, if
anything, has been withheld.
This incident’s injury to the Tribunal’s work can now be remedied, But the

injury to the Chapter 11 process will surely linger.

material on Article 1105. On February 22, 2002 Canadian counsel advised the Tribunal: “I

after making inquiries of appropriate and knowledgeable officials and investigating such other
avenues as J considered necessary and appropriate to satisfy myself that Canada possessed no
such documents.”

E. CHARACTERIZING THE “INTERPRETATION”
As noted, the Tribunal has been presented with a series of negotiating draf‘s of
Chapter 11, not a full negotiating history, as was requested. Therefore, it
cannot reach a fully informed conclusion based upon a complete history. Cine
thing, however, can be said —- nowhere in the over forty negotiating texts
submitted does the word “customary” appear in qualification of “internatioy al
law” in what eventually became Article 1105.
In the first document furnished, “NAFTA: General Investment Principles,” it is
stated that "Foreign investment of a Party shall in any event be accorded fair and
equitable treatment and in no case less than that required by international law."
Then, in the first 18 drafts considered by the negotiators, the basic formulaticn
of the Model BIT was used.** It will be recalled that the Tribunal, and most
other observers, concluded that, in that formulation, the international law
standard of treatment is “additive” to the requirements for fair and equitable

treatment.™

That text reads:

Investments shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable treatment, shall
enjoy full protection and security and shall in no case be accorded treatment
less than that required by international law.

The drafts used some variations on this text, the principal one being the use of the words “in
all other respects as well” in place of “in no case Jess than.” It also appeared that for some
time, Mexico preferred to have no reference made to “international law” in the provision.

36

In the nineteenth draft, dated August 26, 1992, the present formulation of
Article 1105 appears for the first time. That change came in what is called a
“Lawyers’ Revision.” No changes were made thereafter in that text, nor has the
Tribunal been provided with any documents that might explain the reasons for
the change made in the nineteenth draft. The Tribunal notes that, ordinarily,
changes of language reflecting changes in policy are not made in lawyers’
revisions.

The foregoing represents the entirety of what the Tribunal has gleaned from the
documents provided. They show that no reference was ever made to customary
international law, and, of course, one must accept that the negotiators of
NAFTA, as sophisticated representatives of their governments, would have
known that, as is made clear in Article 38 of the Statute of the ICy,**
international law is a broader concept than customary international law, which
is only one of its components. This difference is important. For example,
Canada has argued to this Tribunal that customary international law is limited
to what was required by the cases of the Neer era of the 1920's, whereas
international law in its entirety would bring into play a large variety of

subsequent developments. *°

See fn. 2 above.

Canada has also implicitly made this argument in its proposals on the Free Trade Area

of the Americas agreement, where it refers to a failure by states “to meet the minimum
standard of treatment if their acts amounted to an outrage, bad faith, willful neglect of duty or
an insufficiency of governmental action so fax short of international standards that every
reasonable and impartial person, would readily recognize its insufficiency.” See, Canada’s

22

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:22 NO.889 25/43

47. For these reasons, were the Tribunal required to make a determination whether
the Commission’s action is an interpretation or an amendment, it would choose
the latter.” However, for the reasons discussed below, this determination) is not
required. Accordingly, the Tribunal has proceeded on the basis that the
Commission’s action was an “interpretation.”

F. EFFECT OF THE INTERPRETATION AT
THE PRESENT STAGE OF THE PROCEEDINGS

48. On April 10, 2001 the Tribunal held that there had been a breach of Articl>
1105 in respect of the behaviour of Canada in relation to the Verification Review
Episode, and held the Investor entitled to damages from Canada in respect

thereof. In arriving at that conclusion the Tribunal reached a view as to the,

 

Proposal to the FTAA Negotiating Group on Investment, August 2001. The quoted langu ige
is from Neer.

a7 The Tribunal is not unaware that, in the Eighth Submission of the United States, :t
argued that the term “international law” in Article 1105 means customary international lav,
basing itself on the judgment in the United Mexican States v. Metalclad Corp., 2001 BCSC
664, In that decision, Tysoe J. reached that conclusion without providing any analysis or
reasoning. See id., at 162. Of course, the failure to provide a rationale for the conclusion
renders this ipse dixit holding of questionable precedential value.

Other observers, beyond Sir Robert Jennings, have expressed serious question wheth:r
the Commission’s limitation of “international Jaw’ to customary international law is an
interpretation rather than an amendment. In a recent paper, Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez and
Prof. W.W. Park stated: “Some observers of NAFTA consider these Interpretations to
constitute de facto modification of the NAFTA, departing from the meaning of Article 1105
agreed upon at the time NAFTA was concluded. /f so, then the Interpretations would not be
binding on a NAFTA tribunal.” Aguilar Alvarez and Park, The New Face of Investment

proper meaning of Article 1105. Thereafter, the Commission issued its
Interpretation.

Article 1131(2) provides that an interpretation by the Commission “shall be
binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.” Therefore, the next
question is whether the Interpretation has effect at this stage of the proceedings.
In this respect, Canada has argued that the Tribunal’s Award of April 10, 2001
finding Canada in breach of Article 1105 was not to be treated as a separate,
free-standing, award, which could be regarded as a closed chapter of the case.
The Tribunal had yet to determine all issues relating to damages in respect of
this breach, and, while those determinations might principally relate to issues of
causation. and quantification of loss, they were critically dependent upon there
having been a breach of Article 1105. Canada further argued that, since the
Interpretation was not a change but a statement of what Article 1105 had always
meant, it was necessary for the Tribunal, in applying the Interpretation, to
consider whether its ruling of breach already made was based on. a correct
interpretation. Canada’s position was that because the Tribunal at this stage
had to act on the basis of an interpretation of Article 1105, it must apply the
Interpretation.

The Investor argued in the first place that in international law there was a basic
presumption. against retroactivity.. The Tribunal had already made a finding of
fact in relation to breach of Article 1105, and it was fundamentally unfair to
seek to revisit that. Further, the language of Article 1131(2) “an interpretation

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:22 NO.88° 27/43

shall be binding” only referred to the future and not to the past. The ““ribunal
had already ascertained a breach of Article 1105, and it would be again st
elementary mules of due process of justice to compel it to revisit its
determination. In that context, the Investor referred to the opinion of ‘ir Robert
Jennings cited on page 20 of the Methanex letter dated September 18, 201
discussed above.
The Tribunal has found this issue also a difficult question. The positior;
adopted by Canada was not wholly clear. Nevertheless the Tribunal has reached
the view that the phrase “shall be binding” in Article 1131(2) is better re; ‘arded
as mandatory than prospective. Viewed in that light, it is incumbent on ‘he
Tribunal to assess the impact of the Interpretation upon its prior findings with
respect to Article 1105.

G. | CONSTRUCTION OF THE INTERPRETATION
Viewing the Interpretation as binding on the Tribunal does not necessitate a
finding that it overturns the Tribunal’s previous Award under Article 1105
That Award could remain either because the Tribunal’s interpretation of A: ticle
1105 is compatible with the Commission’s, or, if it is not, because the
application of the Interpretation to the facts found by the Tribunal leads to : he
same conclusion that there was a breach by Canada of its obligations under
Article 1105. If upon either basis the answer is in the affirmative, the Tribwal
may proceed to award damages. If, however, the conclusion is that, upon these

54,

39

facts, the application of the Interpretation leads to a finding of no breach of
Article 1105, the Tribunal may not proceed to award damages.

The Interpretation concluded that Article 1105 prescribes the customary
international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum
standard of treatment to be afforded to investments of investors of other Parties.
The Interpretation does not require that the concepts of “fair and equitable
treatment” and “full protection and security” * be ignored, but rather that they
be considered included as part of the minimum standard of treatment that it
prescribes. Parenthetically, any other construction of the Interpretation
whereby the fairness elements were treated as having no effect, would be to
suggest that the Commission required the word “including” in Article 1105(1) to
be read as “excluding.” Such an approach has only to be stated to be rejected.
Therefore, the Interpretation requires each Party to accord to investments of
investors of the other Parties the faimess elements as subsumed in, rather than
additive to, customary international law.

Was the decision made by the Tribunal based on an interpretation different from
that made by the Commission? At one level this might appear to be so since the
Tribunal expressly referred to the fairness elements as being additions to the
requirements of the international law minimum and interpreted Article 1105 to

require that covered investors and investments receive the benefits of the

As it did in. its Award of April 10, 2001, the Tribunal will henceforth use “fairness

elements” to refer to both the “fair and equitable treatment” and “full protection and security”
tequirements of Article 1105.

26

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:23 NO.8&9 29/43

fairness elements under ordinary standards applied in the NAFTA co antries
without any threshold limitation.

56. However, that conclusion alone does not mean that the Tribunal’s award was
incompatible with the Interpretation. Whether the two are consistent in this
case depends on whether the concept behind the fairness elements uncer
customary international law is different from those elements under orc inary
standards applied in NAFTA countries.

57. Based upon its submissions in these proceedings” and confirmed inten \ationally
in its proposals in. the FTAA negotiations,“ Canada considers that the
principles of customary international law were frozen in amber at the tine of the
Neer decision.*? It was on this basis that it urged the Tribunal to award
damages only if its conduct was found to be an “egregious” act or failure to meet

internationally required standards.

“0 Canada’s view was “The conduct of government toward the investment must ainount

to gross misconduct, manifest injustice or, in the classic words of the Neer‘claim, an outrage,
bad faith or the wilful neglect of duty.” Counter Memoria] Phase 2 1309.

a See, fn. 36, above As noted there, the language offered by Canada used the precise
language of Neer to explain what it meant by the customary international law minimun
standard of treatment.

To recall, the passage from. Neer relied upon by Canada states:

[T)be treatment of an alien, in order to constitute an international delinguency,
should amount to an outrage, to bad faith, to wilful neglect of duty, or toin
insufficiency of governmental action so fax short of international standarc s that

44

The Tribunal rejects this static conception, of customary international law for
the following reasons:

First, as admitted by one of the NAFTA Parties,“ and even. by counsel for
Canada, “* there has been evolution in customary international law concepts
since the 1920's. It is a facet of international law that customary international
law evolves through state practice. International agreements constitute practice
of states and contribute to the grounds of customary international law. “
Secondly, since the 1920s, the range of actions subject to international concern
has broadened beyond the international delinquencies considered in Neer to
inchide the concept of fair and equitable treatment. This development was
focused in the work of the OECD on its Draft Convention on the Protection of
Foreign Property,” which recognized that that concept was already customary in
bilateral agreements then in effect. That draft did not rest upon an effort to
discern the ingredients of international law but upon an independent
consideration of how host countries should treat foreign owned property.
However, the comments to the draft made two observations that are pertinent

here: fair and equitable treatment requires treatment at least as good as that

See Post Hearing Submission Damages Phase for Mexico at { 8: “Mexico also agrees

that the standard is relative and that conduct which may not have violated international law
(sic) the 1920°s might very well be seen to offend internationally accepted principles today.”

48

See Nov. 2001 Tr. at 830:8-11. “We also said that that standard, obviously, develops

over time, but that does not take away from tbe fact that the threshold is high.”

accorded by a state to its own nationals and that concept was emt: adied in
“customary” international law.“

61. Thirdly, the standard of fair and equitable treatment was central tc BITs
negotiated since the work of the OECD. Many of those agreement:;, as the
Tribunal has previously observed, require state conduct to be evalu: ted under
the fairness elements apart from the standards of customary intern: tional law.
And even those that do not provide that those elements are owed in lependently
of the requirements of customary international law do add the fair and equitable
treatment protections to those rights formerly protected by customary
international law. That is, the BITs are not limited to protection agzinst
“international delinquencies.”

62. Canada’s views on the appropriate standard of customary internationitl law for
today were perhaps shaped by its erroneous belief that only some 70 bilateral
investment treaties have been negotiated;*° however, the true number, now

acknowledged by Canada,*! is in excess of 1800. Therefore, applying the

“6 Id. Note 4(a) at 15.

another NAFTA case (Methanex v United States) and provided to this Tribunal by thi: United
States, the Neer case relied upon for that standard was not one concermed with faix aid
equitable treatment but with whether the state concerned had committed an “interna ional
delinquency.”

ordinary mules for determining the content of custom in international law,®* one
must conclude that the practice of states is now represented by those treaties.

63. The International Court of Justice has moved away from the Neer formulation:

Axbitrariness is not so much something opposed to a rule of law, as
something opposed to the nile of law. * * * It is a wilful disregard of due
process of Jaw, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of
judicial propriety.**

64, That formulation leaves out any requixement that every reasonable and
impartial person be dissatisfied and perhaps permits a bit less injury to the
psyche of the observer, who need no longer be outraged, but only surprised by
what the government has done. And, of course, replacing the neutral
“governmental action” with the concept of “due process” perforce makes the
formulation more dynamic and responsive to evolving and more rigorous
standards for evaluating what governments do to people and companies.

65. Based upon the foregoing, the Tribunal rejects Canada’s contention on the

present content of customary international law concerning the protection of

foreign property. Those standards have evolved since 1926, and, were the issue

NAFTA investor is entitled, by virtue of Article 1103, to the treatment accorded nationals of
other states under BIT containing the faixness elements unlimited by customary international
law. See, 1117. The Interpretation did not purport to change that fact, nor could it.

necessary to the Tribunal’s decision here, it would propose a for. ulation more
in keeping with the present practice of states. However, because :he Tribunal
concludes that, even applying Canada’s proposed standard, dama;;es would be
owing to the Investor as a result of the Verification Review Episoce, that
teformulation is unnecessary here.
The Tribunal having thus concluded that the Investor is entitled 1p damages by
reason of the breach by Canada of Article 1105, it is unnecessary 10 consider
issues relating to Articles 1102 or 1103 which had been raised foll »wing upon
the Interpretation. The Tribunal accordingly does not do so.

H. APPLICATION OF THE INTERPRETATIOI
Applying Canada’s view of the customary international law standa:d embodied
in the Interpretation, the Tribunal must determine whether the co:duct giving
tise to the April 10, 2001 Award under Article 1105 was, to use Carada’s term,
egregious. The Tribunal finds that it was.
A lengthy statement of the facts, as found by the Tribunal, is set out in
paragraphs 156-181 of that Award. Briefly, the Tribunal found that when the
Investor instituted the claim in these proceedings, Canada’s Softwocd Lumber
Division (/SLD”) changed its previous relationship with the Investo: and the
Investment from, one of cooperation in running the Softwood Lumber Regime to
one of threats and misrepresentation. Figuring in this new attitude were
assertions of non-existent policy reasons for forcing them to comply ‘vith very
burdensome demands for documents, refusals to provide them with j romised

information, threats of reductions and even termination of the Investment’s
export quotas, serious misrepresentations of fact in memoranda to the Minister
concerning the Investor’s and the Investment’s actions and even suggestions of
criminal investigation of the Investment’s conduct. The Tribunal also
concluded that these actions were not caused by any behaviour of the Investor or
the Investment, which remained cooperative until the overreaching of the SLD
became too burdensome and confrontational. One would hope that these
actions by the SLD would shock and outrage every reasonable citizen of Canada,
they did shock and outrage the Tribunal.
For these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the conduct of the SLD in the
Verification Review Episode violated the fair and equitable treatment
Tequirement under Article 1105, even using Canada’s strict formulation of that
requirement,

I. OTHER ISSUES

Article 1105 Damages to “Investors”

Canada submitted that damages must be confined to those arising out of a
breach of Article 1105(1), which, in its terms, refers to an obligation upon each
Party to accord the requisite treatment to “investments of investors of another
Party”.

In its written submission, Canada argued that, as Article 1105(1) refers only to

investments of investors and not to investors, the Article “bars recovery of

LORD DERVAIRD +01312200644 31/05 '02 09:27 NO.889 35/43

damages incurred directly by the Investor.” °° It submitted that there was no

finding of harm to the Investor under Article 1105, nor could there be because

“the causal link respecting a breach of Article 1105 can only t 2 between the

treatment in question and the Investment.”*” It was, therefor: impossible for

the Investor to establish that any alleged economic harm it suffered (as opposed
to the harm suffered by its Investment) had a sufficient causal ‘ink to Canada’s

breach of Article 1105.

However, Counsel for Canada retreated from that position in tl e hearing.
COUNSEL FOR CANADA: Now, I have not, not'has my client
suggested that my friend is totally devoid of remedy in the
circumstances of this case. What we have, in esse.1ce, is that the
only damages recoverable during this phase are thc se damages, if

any, sustained by the investment — I’m sorry, the i 1vestor.

ARBITRATOR BELMAN: So if the investor pays Nir. Appleton’s
legal fees, that counts in your view?

COUNSEL FOR CANADA: It may well do, assuming that you're
satisfied that they are appropriate expenditures and all of that sort

of thing. However, the claim for incremental loss 0’ revenue is a
different matter .. . *

The Tribunal accordingly proceeds upon the basis that Canada aczepts that
damages incurred by the Investor may be recoverable where there .1as been a

breach of Article 1105.

Damages under Articles 1116 and 1117
74, This claim is submitted by the Investor under Article 1116, which provides:

An investor of a Party may submit to arbitration under this Section
a claim that another Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A...

and that the investor has incurred Joss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach.

Article 1117 provides:

An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of another Party
that is a juridical person that the investor owns or controls directly
or indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim
that the other Party has breached an obligation under:

(a)  SectionA...

and that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach.

75. Canada submitted an argument along the following lines: Article 1116 provides
for claims for loss or damage incurred by an investor, whereas Article 1117
addresses claims for loss or damage incurred by an investment owned or
controlled by an investor. Because, as noted, the sole basis for the claim here
was Article 1116, the Investor may not recover damages due to injuries to its
Investment, and any elements of its claims that are derivative from injuries
suffered by the Investment must be disallowed. They would be recoverable
under Article 1117, but that claim had not been made.

76. Canada based its contention on -

the customary international law prohibition on shareholders recovering
from injuries suffered by a corporation — the so-called Barcelona Traction

tule. It is well established in customary internation: Jaw that
corporations have a legal existence separate from thzt of their
shareholders. Article 1116 enables investors (those :hat own or control
an investment) to seek relief for injuries that are direct but not
derivative.”
Canada also asserted that Article 1117 on the other hand p: ovides —
a remedy for injuries to enterprises that would otherwise be barred from
bringing a claim by the customary international law r ale prohibiting
claimants from filing international claims against the x own governments.
It supplements customary international law by creatir g a derivative right
of action for the benefit of an investor.
The submission by Canada was thus that claims under Artic es 1116 and 1117
are mutually exclusive, at least in the sense that while an inv *stor might be able
to claim by arbitration under Article 1116 when it claimed to have suffered loss
and damage directly (so seeking to distinguish its loss from lois to the
investment), it could not claim under that Article losses it inc 1rs indirectly by
virtue of damages to its investment.
The difficulty for Canada’s position is in the language of the NAFTA. First,
Article 1117 is permissive, not mandatory, in its language “may submit to
arbitration.” It is prohibitory only in that Article 1117(4) state: “An investment
may not make a claim under this Section.”

Of greater significance is the language of Article 1121(1):

A disputing investor may submit a claim under Article 1: 16 to
arbitration only if:

(b) the investor and, where the claim is for loss or damage to an
interest in an enterprise of another Party that is a juridical person that
the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, the enterprise,
waive their right to initiate or continue [any other dispute settlement
procedures].

In the view of the Tribunal it could scarcely be clearer that claims may be
brought under Article 1116 by an investor who is claiming for loss or damage to
its interest in the relevant enterprise, which is a juridical person that the
investor owns. In the present case, therefore, where the investor is the sole
owner of the enterprise (which is a corporation, and thus an investment within
the definitions contained in Articles 1139 and 201), it is plain that a claim for
loss or damage to its interest in that enterprise/investment may be brought
under Article 1116. It remains of course for the Investor to prove that loss or
damage was caused to its interest, and that it was causally connected to the
breach complained of.*! But for immediate purposes the important point is that
the existence of Article 1117 does not bar bringing a claim under Article 1116.
J. DAMAGES
After due consideration and deliberation, the Tribunal concludes that two heads
of damages claimed are not recoverable. They are (1) the value of management

time devoted to the claim herein and (2) alleged losses flowing from the seven

The link between the financial fortunes of parent and subsidiary corporations, perhaps

obvious on its face, is made express by requirements in most developed countries that majority
owned subsidiaries be consolidated in the financial reports of the parent. See, e.g., U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission Regulation S-X, 17 C.F.R. § 210.SA-02; (U.S.) Financial
Accounting Standards Board Statement No. 94 (issued 10/87); Canadian Institute of Chartered
Accountants Handbook (2002) at § 1590.16.

day shutdown of the Investment’s three British Columbi 1 mills in December,
1999.

The Tribunal considers management time to be a fixed cast. The evidence
revealed that the management who were involved in matt 2rs covered by the
present claim were paid annual salaries that did not vary ia respect of the issues
or matters to which each of them devoted his or her worl ing time. Therefore,
those salaries would have been paid no matter what work) elated activities those
managers undertook. This being the case, no such additional costs were
incurred because of the Verification Review Episode, even i ithose employees
were required to work more hours during the year because f that episode.

At the commencement of the November 2001 hearing on d.umages, the Tribunal
‘was in some doubt whether the Verification Review Episode and the consequent
possibility of a cutback in the Investment’s quota for the follswing quota year
directly caused the shutdown in December 1999. However, ‘he testimony of its
president, Mr. A. Friesen, convinced the Tribunal of that cav sal relationship.
The Tribunal was thus required to determine what, if any, loss of profits the
Investment suffered as a result of the shutdown. At the samc hearing, Canada
produced evidence and analyses, based upon the Investment’s own records, that
convinced the Tribunal that the Investment at all relevant tin es had inventory
sufficient to meet all its sales requirements, notwithstanding ‘hat shutdown.
Therefore, the thesis advanced by the Investor that the Investr. ent never
recovered from that lost production was not borne out by the evidence. In fact,

the Investment suffered no loss of profits from the shutdown because it was
always able to meet the needs of its customers on a timely basis. There was no
convincing evidence that replenishing that inventory cost the Investment more

than it would have if the shutdown had not occurred.

- The heads of damages claimed that the Tribunal finds to be recoverable are (1)

out of pocket expenses relating to the Verification Review Episode, including the
applicable accountants’ and legal fees, as well as the fees and expenses incusred
by the Investor in lobbying efforts to counter the actions of the SLD and the
consequent possibility of reductions in the Investment’s export quotas, and (2)
out of pocket expenses directly incurred by the Investor with respect to the
Interim Hearing held in January 2000.7

The following sets out the amounts in U.S. dollars under these heads claimed to

have been expended by the Investor and accepted by Canada:

Canada argued that the Interim Hearing expenses should be considered as costs rather

than damages. For the reasons stated in the Award of April 10, 2001, the Tribunal considers it
moore appropriate to treat those expenses as damages.

provides that a tribunal “may award . . . monetary damages and any applicable
interest.” The UNCITRAL Rules are silent on the issue of interest. Canada
submitted that, “if the Tribunal finds that the Investor incurred compensable
loss or injury, the Tribunal should apply a simple rate of 5% interest in its
awarzd.”** Canada accepted that the Tribunal was not bound by domestic law
but referred to the Canadian legal rate of 5% as a “helpful benchmark for setting
interest."

The Tribunal concludes that the NAFTA provisions are an independent basis for
determining interest recovery; otherwise domestic law could prevent the award
of any interest. Of course, applicable rules of international Jaw, which are
expressly made part of these proceedings by virtue of Article 1131(1), also call for
the award of appropriate interest, including compounding, as one of the
elements of compensation.*

In the circumstances, acting pursuant to Article 1131, the Tribunal awards
interest on the principal sum at the rate of 5% per annum compounded
quarterly as an appropriate rate, starting at December 1, 1999.°° With that

interest, the amount awarded as of May 31, 2002 is $461,566. Interest on that
