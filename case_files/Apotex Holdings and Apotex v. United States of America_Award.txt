The Arbitral Tribunal

The Tribunal is comprised of three arbitrators, appointed pursuant to NAFTA

Article 1123, as follows:

The Claimants appointed Mr. J. William Rowley, a national of Canada and the
United Kingdom, of 20 Essex Street Chambers 20 Essex Street, London WC2R
3AL United Kingdom and (at that time) also of McMillan LLP Brookfield Place,
181 Bay Street, Suite 4400, Toronto, Ontario, Canada MSJ 2T3.

The Respondent appointed Mr. John Crook, a national of the United States of
America, of 10610 Belfast Place, Potomac, Maryland 2084, USA.

The Parties agreed on the appointment of Mr. V.V. Veeder, a national of the United
Kingdom, as the third and presiding arbitrator, of Essex Court Chambers, 24
Lincoln’s Inn Fields, London WC2 3EG, United Kingdom.

The Tribunal was constituted on 11 June 2012 in accordance with Article 6(3) of the

ICSID Arbitration AF Rules.

Ms. Eloise Obadia, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as the Secretary
of the Tribunal. Ms. Obadia was later replaced as Secretary of the Tribunal by Mr.
Monty Taylor, ICSID Legal Counsel, with Ms. Martina Polasek, also ICSID Legal

Counsel, acting as Alternate Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Arbitral Procedure

Request: On 6 March 2012, Apotex-Holdings and Apotex Inc. submitted on their
own behalf and on behalf of Apotex-US their Request for Arbitration dated 29
February 2012 against the Respondent (“the Request”) pursuant to Article 2 of the
ICSID Arbitration AF Rules.

The Request, as supplemented by the Claimants’ subsequent letter dated 8 March
2012, was registered by the Secretary-General of ICSID pursuant to Articles 4 and 5
of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules on 16 March 2012. The Secretary-General

notified in writing the Parties of such registration on the same day.

The Tribunal held a first session with the Parties at the World Bank in Washington
DC, USA on 24 July 2012. The Parties confirmed that the Tribunal was properly
constituted and that no Party had any objection to the appointment of any member
of the Tribunal. It was also confirmed (inter alia) that the applicable ICSID
Arbitration AF Rules would be those in force as of April 2006 and that the
procedural language would be English. The agreement of the Parties was eventually
embodied in Procedural Order No. 1 of 29 November 2012 signed by the President

of the Tribunal and circulated to the Parties.

Also on 24 July 2012, the Tribunal issued a Confidentiality Agreement and Order
signed by the President of the Tribunal and the Parties. An Amended Confidentiality
Agreement and Order was issued by the Tribunal on 30 October 2013, also signed

by the President of the Tribunal and the Parties.

At the first session, the Parties confirmed their disagreement on the legal place of
the arbitration, albeit that the Parties agreed that the geographical place of the oral
hearing(s) would be the World Bank, Washington DC, USA. As to the legal place of
the arbitration, the Claimants proposed Toronto, Canada and the Respondent
proposed Washington DC or alternatively New York, USA. The Tribunal decided
that it would determine the place of arbitration without a hearing on the issue. After
considering the Parties’ written submissions, the Tribunal decided upon New York,
NY, USA, as the legal place of this arbitration pursuant to Article 20(1) of the
ICSID Arbitration AF Rules. The Tribunal communicated this decision to the

Parties by letter dated 6 November 2012.

By the same letter, the Tribunal also confirmed the Parties’ agreement that the
geographical place for all the procedural meetings and oral hearings was the seat of

ICSID, at the World Bank’s offices in Washington DC, USA.

The reasons for the Tribunal’s decision with respect to the legal place of arbitration
are set out in the Tribunal’s “Decision on the Place of Arbitration” attached to this

Part I below, as Appendix A.

Apotex Memorial: On 30 July 2012, the Claimants filed their Memorial. With the
Memorial, the Claimants also filed, in writing: (i) an Expert Report of Mr. Howard
M. Rosen dated 30 July 2012; (ii) an Expert Report of Mr. Sheldon T. Bradshaw
and Mr. Ron M. Johnson dated 30 July 2012; (iii) a Witness Statement of Mr. Kiran
Krishnan dated 27 July 2012; (iv) a Witness Statement of Mr. John Flinn dated 30
July 2012; (v) a Witness Statement of Mr. Gordon Fahner dated 30 July 2012; (vi) a
Witness Statement of Dr. Jeremy Desai dated 30 July 2012; (vii) a Witness
Statement of Mr. Bruce Clark dated 27 July 2012; (viii) a Witness Statement of Mr.
Edmund Carey dated 29 July 2012; (ix) a Witness Statement of Mr. Jeff Watson
dated 30 July 2012; and (x) a Witness Statement of Ms. Bernice Tao dated 29 July
2012.

On 29 October 2012, the Tribunal issued a procedural order concerning the

procedural timetable for this proceeding.

USA Counter-Memorial: On 14 December 2012, the Respondent filed its Counter-
Memorial, including its objections to jurisdiction and a request to have the Tribunal
address those objections to jurisdiction as a bifurcated preliminary matter. With its
Counter-Memorial, the Respondent also filed, in writing: (i) a Witness Statement of
Mr. Michael R. Goga dated 12 December 2012; (ii) a Witness Statement of Mr.
Lloyd Payne dated 12 December 2012; (iii) a Witness Statement of Commander
Debra M. Emerson dated 13 December 2012; and (iv) a Witness Statement of Dr.
Carmelo Rosa dated 14 December 2012.

On 28 December 2012, the Claimants filed written observations on the
Respondent’s request for bifurcation, to which the Respondent filed a written
response on 10 January 2013. On 16 January 2013 the Claimants filed their written

observations on that response.

On 25 January 2013, the Tribunal issued its procedural order on the Respondent’s
request for bifurcation. The Tribunal dismissed the Respondent’s request and

ordered that both the jurisdictional and liability issues in the proceeding be

addressed in the remaining written procedure and heard during the oral procedure at
the same hearing, with all quantum issues (including interest) to be addressed in a

later phase of this proceeding (if and to the extent relevant).

On 7 February 2013, a non-disputing party, Business Neatness Magnanimity BNM
srl (“BNM”), made an application to file a non-disputing party submission in the
arbitration. Mr. Barry Appleton, another non-disputing party, also made an
application on 8 February 2013. These applications were made in accordance with
Procedural Order No. 1, which allowed amicus applications (for permission to file a

substantive amicus submission) by 8 February 2013.

Mexico’s Article 1128 Submission: On 9 February 2013, the United Mexican States
filed a written submission as a non-disputing State Party pursuant to NAFTA

Article 1128.

The Claimants filed observations on BNM’s application on 15 February 2013; and
the Respondent indicated by letter of the same date that it was taking no position on
BNM’s application. With respect to Mr. Appleton’s application, the Respondent
filed observations on that application on 15 February 2013; and the Claimants
indicated by a letter on the same day that they were taking no position on that

application.

On 1 March 2013, the Tribunal informed BNM and Mr. Appleton by separate letters
that their respective applications were denied by the Tribunal. These letters
indicated that detailed reasons for the decisions would follow; and these were
provided in two separate procedural orders dated 4 March 2013, respectively (i)
“Procedural Order on the Participation of the Applicant, BNM, as a Non-Disputing
Party” and (ii) “Procedural Order on the Participation of the Applicant, Mr. Barry
Appleton, as a Non-Disputing Party.”

On 15 March 2013, the Claimants and the Respondent requested the Tribunal to
decide on the production of documents disputed between them. To that end,
pursuant to Paragraph 14.2.7(v) of Procedural Order No. 1, the Claimants and the
Respondent submitted to the Tribunal disputes under their respective schedules for
document production for decision by the Tribunal. On 20 March 2013, the

Respondent filed observations on the Claimants’ request; and the Claimants made

submissions on 22 and 24 March 2013 regarding the Respondent’s observations. On
29 March 2013, the Tribunal issued a “Procedural Order on the Parties’ Respective

Requests for Document Production.”

On 14 May 2013, the Tribunal issued a “Procedural Order on the Schedule
Regarding the Parties’ Respective Privilege Logs, Further Submissions and

Certifications.”

Apotex Reply: On 24 May 2013, the Claimants filed their Reply, together with, in
writing: (i) a Second Expert Report of Mr. Sheldon T. Bradshaw and Mr. Ron M.
Johnson dated 24 May 2013; (ii) a Second Witness Statement of Mr. Gordon Fahner
dated 24 May 2013; (iii) a Second Witness Statement of Mr. Edmund Carey dated
24 May 2013; (iv) a Second Witness Statement of Ms. Bernice Tao dated 24 May
2013; (v) a Second Witness Statement of Dr. Jeremy Desai dated 23 May 2013; and
(vi) a Second Witness Statement of Mr. Kiran Krishnan dated 23 May 2013.

Following written exchanges between the Parties, on 11 June 2013 the Claimants
and the Respondent filed further requests for the Tribunal to decide on the
production of documents disputed between them. On 5 July 2013, the Tribunal
issued a “Procedural Order on Document Production Regarding the Parties’

Respective Claims to Privilege and Privilege Logs.”

On 22 July 2013, the Claimants filed a Supplement to their Reply of 24 May 2013.

USA Rejoinder: On 27 September 2013, the Respondent filed its Rejoinder on
Merits and Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction together with, in writing: (i) a
supplemental Witness Statement of Dr. Carmelo Rosa dated 27 September 2013;
and (ii) an Expert Report of Mr. William W. Vodra dated 20 September 2013.

Closing the File: The proceeding was closed, as regards the issues here expressly
decided in the Operative Part, on 1 August 2014, by the Tribunal’s letter dated 1
August 2014 as earlier notified to the Parties by the Tribunal’s letters dated 14
March and 24 July 2014 under or by analogy to Article 44(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration AF Rules.

Redactions: This award is issued to the Parties in a non-redacted form. The Parties
agreed, as regards any wider publication, to a procedure for redacting confidential
information in Paragraph 21.2 of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No.1, as later
confirmed by the Parties in their respective email messages to the Tribunal dated 29

July 2014.

The Parties’ Dispute (Jurisdiction and Merits)

Jurisdiction: As already indicated above, the Claimants submit that this Tribunal
has jurisdiction to decide all their claims advanced in this arbitration under NAFTA
and the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules. The Respondent disputes that submission,
having made timely objections that the Parties’ dispute is not within the competence

of the Tribunal under Article 45(2) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules.

Merits: The named Claimants (i.e. Apotex-Holdings and Apotex Inc.) make claims
for breach by the Respondent of several of its obligations under NAFTA and the
Treaty Between the United States of America and Jamaica Concerning the
Reciprocal Encouragement and Protection of Investment of 4 February 1994
(‘Jamaica-USA BIT”) both for themselves and also (by Apotex-Holdings) for
Apotex-US. The Claimants also claim interest and costs (the latter under Article
52(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules). The Respondent, without prejudice to
its jurisdictional objections, denies any liability to the Claimants (for themselves
and also for Apotex-US); and, in turn, the Respondent claims costs (also under

Article 52(1)(j) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules).

As indicated above, by its procedural order of 25 January 2013, the Tribunal
ordered the bifurcation between (i) the joined jurisdiction and liability issues and (ii)
all quantum issues. Hence, the Hearing addressed only the former issues; and the

latter issues are not here addressed by the Tribunal.

The Parties’ dispute, as to both jurisdiction and the merits (liability), is further

described below in Part II.

The Parties’ Claims for Relief

The Tribunal here records the formal relief sought from the Tribunal by the Parties

at successive stages of this arbitration.

The Claimants: The Claimants, by their Request (Paragraph 89), request an award,
“on behalf of Apotex-US and on their own behalf” in their favour in the terms there
specified pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1), as re-stated in their
Memorial (Paragraph 572), their Reply (Paragraph 532) and their Rejoinder on
Jurisdiction (Paragraph 127).

(i) The Claimants’ Request: Section V, Paragraph 89 (page 19) states: “As a result

(iv) The Claimants’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction: Paragraph 127 (page 47) relevantly
states: “For the foregoing reasons and those set out in its previous submissions,

PART I- APPENDIX A

The Reasons for the Tribunal’s Decision
on New York as the Legal Place of the Arbitration
under Article 20(1) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules

Introduction

As described in Part I above, the Tribunal decided that the legal place of this
arbitration was New York, New York, USA under Article 20(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration AF Rules; and the Tribunal communicated that decision to the Parties by
letter dated 6 November 2012. The Tribunal here sets out its reasons for that
decision. For practical purposes, the effect of the Tribunal’s decision is relevant
only to its award made under the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules. It was not relevant
during the arbitration given the Parties’ consensus on the geographical place of this

arbitration, namely the seat of ICSID at the World Bank, Washington DC, USA.

As also described in Part I, in consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal agreed to
hold the first session in person in Washington DC on 24 July 2012. The legal place
of arbitration was one of the items listed on the agenda for this first session. Earlier,
on 17 July 2012, the Parties had submitted their written observations on the agenda
and had indicated that they were unable to reach agreement on the legal place of
arbitration. The Claimants were then proposing Toronto, Canada; and the
Respondent was then proposing Washington DC, USA, later also proposing New
York, New York, USA.

It was common ground between the Parties that it was not open to the Tribunal to
choose another legal place of arbitration, its choice being limited by NAFTA’s
Chapter Eleven, Article 19 of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules and the Parties’
proposals to one of the three places disputed by the Parties; namely (i) Toronto, (ii)
Washington DC or (iii) New York. In other circumstances, the Tribunal might have
wished to choose a legal place of arbitration neutral for all Parties; but such a choice

was not open to the Tribunal in this arbitration.

At the first session, the Parties confirmed their disagreement over the legal place of

arbitration; and it was agreed that the Tribunal would determine the issue after

Part | Appendix A — Page 1 of 14

AS.

A6.

A.7.

AD.

receiving the Parties’ written submissions on the issue without any additional oral

hearing.

As directed by the Tribunal at the first session, the Claimants filed their written
submission on the legal place of arbitration on 24 August 2012 (the “Claimants’
submission”) and the Respondent filed its written submission on the legal place of

arbitration on 31 August 2012 (the “Respondent’s submission”).

On 11 September 2012, the Claimants applied for the Tribunal’s permission to make
a short written reply submission on the issue and for the Respondent to make a short

written rejoinder submission to the Claimants’ reply.

On 12 September 2012, the Tribunal granted the Claimants’ application; and it
directed the Claimants to file their reply submission by 17 September 2012 and the

Respondent to file its rejoinder submission by 26 September 2012.

The Parties filed their respective further written submissions, the Claimants on 17
September 2012 (the “Claimants’ reply submission”) and the Respondent on 26

September 2012 (the “Respondent’s rejoinder submission”).

By Procedural Order of 2 October 2012, the Tribunal confirmed its receipt of the
Parties’ written submissions as to the respective merits and demerits of the Parties’
proposed legal places of arbitration. The Tribunal noted that it had not received
submissions from the Claimants as regards New York, which had been suggested
(in the alternative) as a possible legal place of the arbitration by the Respondent in
its rejoinder submission. Accordingly, the Tribunal invited the Claimants’ brief
written comments as regards the Respondent’s alternative suggestion of New York,
to be filed by 10 October 2012. The Claimants filed such submission on that date

(the “Claimants” surreply submission”).

As requested by the Tribunal, on 10 October 2012 the ICSID Secretariat also filed
comments on the legal places suggested by the Parties, pursuant to Article 20(1) of

the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules.

In arriving at its decision on New York as the legal place of arbitration, the Tribunal

took into account all the Parties’ written submissions and the written comments of

decision, it is not necessary to refer in full to these submissions and comments.

The Parties’ Relevant Submissions

In summary, the Parties’ disagreement on the legal place of the arbitration was
between the Claimants in favour of Toronto and the Respondent in favour of
Washington DC or, alternatively, New York. The Parties agreed that the Tribunal
could be guided, in the exercise of its discretion under Article 20(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration AF Rules, by the general considerations set out in Paragraph 22 of the

UNCITRAL Notes on Organising Arbitral Proceedings (the “UNCITRAL Notes”).!

In summary, the UNCITRAL Notes’ general considerations comprise the following:
(i) the suitability of the law on arbitral procedure of the place of arbitration (the /ex
loci arbitri); (ii) whether there is a multilateral or bilateral treaty on the enforcement
of arbitral awards between the State where the arbitration takes place and the State
or States where the award may have to be enforced; (iii) the convenience of the
parties and the arbitrators, including travel distances; (iv) the availability and cost of
support services needed for the arbitration; and (v) the location of the subject-matter

in dispute and the proximity of evidence.

It can be seen that most of these considerations relate to the geographical place of
arbitration, as distinct from its legal place. As to the latter, only the first and second
considerations (i) and (ii) are potentially material to the legal place of this
arbitration. Hence, the considerations (iii), (iv) and (v) here provided no assistance
to the Tribunal. In Mobil Investments Canada Inc. v. Canada, the tribunal noted
that: “the place that is selected to hold any hearings and the place of arbitration raise
different considerations. The latter raises considerations of a jurisdictional nature,
by bringing the arbitration into the jurisdiction of a particular court in whose

geographical ambit the place of arbitration is established.””

   

ion, at pp. 2-3; and the Respondent's submission, at p. 2. (These Notes are currently

being revised by UNCITRAL.)

As to the second consideration (ii) relating to the existence of an international
treaty, the Parties agreed that it is not here a decisive consideration since both
Canada and the USA are parties to the 1958 UN Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (the “New York Convention”). Moreover,
Article 19 of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules requires this arbitration to be held
only in States that are parties to the New York Convention. Hence, the consideration

(ii) here provided no assistance to the Tribunal.

As to the first consideration (i) relating to the /ex loci arbitri, in summary, the
Claimants submitted that Toronto should be the legal place of this arbitration.
Recognising that Toronto was not a neutral place (given the two Claimants’
Canadian nationalities), the Claimants submitted that all three suggested legal places
(Toronto, New York and Washington DC) were incapable of being neutral since
none of them was a jurisdiction that was neither that of the Claimants nor that of the
Respondent.* The Claimants, therefore, contended that neutrality was here best
addressed by fixing the legal place of the arbitration in Toronto where the Canadian

courts would treat all the Parties with equality.>

In summary, the Respondent submitted that the legal place of every arbitration
against the Respondent under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven has been in the USA,
forming a well-founded accepted practice by disputing parties which should be
followed by the Tribunal in this arbitration. The Respondent further submitted, with
respect to the consideration (i), that Washington DC and New York were equally
suitable and found support from the fact that six NAFTA tribunals have found the
laws of the USA to be appropriate for arbitrations under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven.°
The Respondent therefore pressed for Washington DC or, in the subsidiary

alternative, New York.

The Parties also disagreed on the suitability of their proposed legal places with
respect to the law on arbitral immunity and quorum. It is appropriate to consider

these two differences in turn.

Arbitral Immunity

The Claimants submitted that, in Toronto, arbitrators who exercise judicial
functions are (as a general rule) immune from claims of negligence or breach of
contract. In Washington DC, according to the Claimants, arbitrators are immune
from liability to the same extent as a judge of a DC court acting in a judicial
capacity, such immunity being governed by common law and subject to various
exceptions.’ The Claimants indicated that, as regards New York, there “may be

exceptions” to arbitral immunity.*

The Respondent submitted that arbitrators and arbitral institutions enjoy in the USA
the broadest degree of immunity from suit for actions taken within their duties and

that the exceptions identified by the Claimants were inapposite.°

The Tribunal does not consider that any difference regarding arbitral immunity
between the three proposed legal places, if it exists at all, is materially significant

for this case. Accordingly, this factor here provided no assistance to the Tribunal.

Quorum

The Claimants submitted that Ontario’s International Commercial Arbitration Act
(the “ICAA”) does not specifically address the question of quorum but does provide
for the number of arbitral votes required for an arbitral decision. In the absence of
agreement between the parties to an arbitration (subject to Ontario law), the tribunal
may conduct the arbitration as it considers appropriate, subject to the provisions of
the ICAA.'° The Claimants further submitted that with respect to an arbitration, the
legal place of which is situated in Washington DC, the United States Federal
Arbitration Act (the “FAA”) is silent with respect to quorum requirements while the

lex loci arbitri in DC (under the DC Arbitration Act) requires the presence of all

arbitrators at the hearings on the merits.'' The same is true, according to the

Claimants, under New York arbitration law. 1
A.23. The Respondent did not comment on this factor.

A.24. — Given the effect of Articles 22(2) and 24(1) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules, the
Tribunal does not consider that any relevant difference exists as regards quorum
between the three proposed legal places. Accordingly, this factor here provided no

assistance to the Tribunal.

(5) The Lex Loci Arbitri

A.25. The Claimants submitted that the law applicable to arbitration proceedings with a
legal place of arbitration in Washington DC is the DC Arbitration Act, to the extent
that it does not conflict with the FAA." As regards setting-aside proceedings in the
USA, according to the Claimants, the law applicable is the FAA, including setting-
aside proceedings both in Washington DC and New York. ‘| The Claimants
contended that it was difficult to predict in advance whether the provisions of the
DC Arbitration Act or the New York state law would apply or if they would be held

to limit or hinder the goals of the FAA. s

A.26. In Toronto, the Claimants submitted that the Jex loci arbitri is contained in the
ICAA, which incorporates the UNCITRAL 1985 Model Law on International

Commercial Arbitration (with minor variations). 16

A.27. The Claimants submitted that selecting Washington DC, or New York, as the legal
place of this arbitration would create for the Parties an “uneven playing field for
post-award proceedings.”'” The Claimants asserted that the law applicable to

arbitration proceedings in Washington DC or New York is not suitable because it

requires US courts to defer to the views of the US Government on the interpretation
of treaties, such as NAFTA. Treaty interpretation, as the Claimants submitted, is
often the central issue presented before the judicial body responsible to determine
an application to set aside an arbitration award made under a treaty. 1s According to
the Claimants, this creates a presumption in favour of the US Government’s views

(albeit rebuttable) which is unfairly disadvantageous to the Claimants. 8

The Claimants also asserted that the courts in Washington DC are more
“interventionist” than the courts of Ontario, which have shown due deference for
arbitral awards and limited judicial intervention in the arbitral process.” To that

" of the Ontario

effect, the Claimants cited the decision in Mexico v. Cargill, Inc.
Court of Appeals in support of their case that reviewing courts in Ontario take a
narrow view when questions of jurisdiction are raised in proceedings to set aside
arbitral awards; and that they also carefully limit the issues to be addressed so as to

ensure that they are “true questions of jurisdiction.””

In contrast, the Claimants cited the decision of the DC Court of Appeals in
Argentina v. BG Group PLC,? which, so they submitted, showed (at that time) that
US courts are more interventionist in regard to international arbitration awards. The
Claimants noted that even if this were a solitary example (contrary to their
submission), this decision was a binding legal precedent in Washington DC.* The
Claimants contended that while the decision was not similarly binding upon New
York courts (including the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit), the

decision remained potentially persuasive for such New York courts.”°

The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted that the Claimants’ contention
contradicted their own position in two previous NAFTA cases in which Apotex Inc.

had voluntarily consented to New York as the legal place of arbitration and,

consequently, to US law as the lex loci arbitri.?> To that effect, the Respondent
stated in its submission that, subsidiarily, it would now agree to New York as the

legal place of arbitration. 2

The Respondent also refuted the idea that US courts provided an unfair advantage to
the views of the US Government in US legal proceedings relating to an award.
Although the views of the US Government are routinely given great weight, the
Respondent submitted that US courts also take into consideration the views of other
contracting parties to a treaty (as well as the disputing parties). According to the
Respondent, there are also a number of cases in which US courts have disregarded

the views of the US Government on treaty interpretation.”*

The Respondent also submitted that the Claimants misread the BG Group decision.
It asserted that the Claimants should not derive from a single decision (for which the
BG Group had petitioned, at that time, the US Supreme Court for a writ of
certiorari) the sweeping conclusion that US courts are unduly interventionist in
regard to arbitration awards.”? The Respondent further submitted that, in any event,
the BG Group decision was not a legal precedent in the US Court of Appeals for the

Second Circuit, which has appellate jurisdiction over federal courts in New York.*°

In addition, the Respondent asserted that there was in the USA longstanding support
for international arbitration and that US courts have long recognised that the
grounds for judicial review of an award are extremely limited.*! The Respondent
also cast doubts on the allegedly limited interventionist character of the Canadian
courts in the international arbitration process. It submitted that, in the Cargill
decision, the Ontario Court of Appeals did not leave to the arbitral tribunal an entire
discretion in deciding upon its own jurisdiction, but determined that it was: “up to
the court to determine whether it [the tribunal] was [correct in its assumption of

jurisdiction].”*? The Respondent also referred to the fact that other NAFTA

tribunals have expressed doubts as to the suitability of Canada as the legal place of
an arbitration in the light of the standard of review urged by the Canadian

Government.**

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Reasons

The Tribunal considers that the choice of legal place lies between Toronto and New
York. For this arbitration it discounts Washington DC. Washington DC is the
Respondent’s capital city; and the two other candidates are only regional centres,
albeit significant metropolitan cities in their respective countries. In the Tribunal’s
view, it would not be appropriate for the Claimants to be required, effectively, to

play away in the Respondent’s national home stadium.

The Tribunal also considers that, given the Parties’ limitations imposed upon the
Tribunal, considerations of national neutrality are inapplicable to the exercise of the
Tribunal’s discretion. New York as a legal place of arbitration is as foreign to the
Claimants as Toronto is foreign to the Respondent. Whilst national neutrality would
ordinarily be an important factor for a tribunal’s decision, that factor is not available

to be taken into account by the Tribunal in this arbitration.

The Tribunal further considers unhelpful the Parties’ debate over the relative
interventionist (or non-interventionist) tendencies of New York and Toronto courts.
In this regard, Toronto and New York represent an invidious choice to make, since
both would provide, in the Tribunal’s view, suitable legal places for this arbitration
within the meaning of the consideration (i), i.e. the suitability of the law on arbitral
procedure of the place of arbitration. Both places have acceptable laws for
international arbitration, including the judicial review of investor-state arbitration

awards.

Moreover, it is of no material concern to this Tribunal to what extent its
jurisdictional decisions can be reviewed under the /ex loci arbitri, whether to a
greater extent in New York or to a lesser extent in Toronto or vice-versa (as the
Parties submitted differently). Whilst not here expressing any view on the scope of

judicial review, the Tribunal considers that in general such decisions should be

Part | Appendix A — Page 9 of 14

A.38.

A.39.

A.40.

reviewable, given that consent to arbitration by the Parties is an essential pre-
requisite to the Arbitration Agreement from which this Tribunal derives its
jurisdiction to decide the Parties’ dispute under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven.
Moreover, with the subsequent decision of the US Supreme Court in BG Group,
the Claimants’ concerns as to US law may now seem less well-founded, being based
(as they then were) upon the decision of the DC Court of Appeals, since reversed by
the US Supreme Court. (The Tribunal returns to the Supreme Court’s decision

below.)

In the circumstances, the Tribunal considered (as it does still) the decisive
consideration as between Toronto and New York to be the legal level-playing field

provided to all Parties equally under the lex loci arbitri.

Subject to one factor considered below, the Tribunal considered that, by a whisker,
New York should be preferred over Toronto as the legal place of arbitration for this
arbitration. First, New York is an older and more established place of arbitration,
with its courts long familiar with international arbitration (including the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit). New York has a settled legal
system regarding arbitration generally, providing for legal certainty and
predictability. In contrast, the 1985 UNCITRAL Model Law (upon which the ICAA
is based) is of relatively recent creation. Second, New York is a place not unfamiliar
to the Parties. Apotex Inc. and the Respondent jointly agreed to New York as the
legal place for their recent arbitration leading to the Apotex I & II Award,** with no
undue legal mishap for any Party (albeit that the Tribunal recognises that the
amount at issue in that arbitration was much less than the amount of the Claimants’
claims in this arbitration). Third, but only as a minor supporting factor, Toronto is
where the two Claimants have their principal places of business; and a choice of

Toronto could thus imbalance the Claimants’ interests over those of the Respondent.

This one factor concerned the Claimants’ submission that US Courts favour the US
Government over other litigants. As understood by the Tribunal, the Claimants
objected to New York (over Toronto) because of the canon of interpretation

enunciated by the US Supreme Court in cases such as Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc.

v. Avagliano,*® and Abbott v. Abbott,*’ to the effect that US courts are to give “great

weight” to the views of the US Government in interpreting US treaties.

As evidence of this canon’s continued vitality, the Claimants cited the Second
Circuit decision, Lozano v. Alvarez,** applying this canon of interpretation to the
Hague Convention on Child Abduction. In the Claimants’ submission, “US judges
are required by established US law to defer to the US Government on issues of
treaty interpretation.”*” For the Claimants, this “would create an uneven playing

40

field for post-award proceedings,” as issues of treaty interpretation are likely to be

at the centre of any post-award legal proceedings in New York.

The Respondent disputed the characterisation of US law as requiring US courts to
defer to the US Government’s views, submitting that “U.S. courts ... are not
required by U.S. law to — and do not — provide an ‘unfair advantage in post-award
proceedings’ to the U.S. government on treaty interpretation issues.”“' As
summarised above, the Respondent acknowledged that “U.S. courts routinely give
great weight to the views of the U.S. government on treaty matters.”*’ However, the
Respondent also noted that the US Supreme Court also rejects the US Government’s
interpretations of treaty provisions, as it did in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld* ° and Gonzales

v. O. Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao do Vegetal.**

For the Respondent, recent cases like Abbott v. Abbott show that the contemporary
process of treaty interpretation by US Courts begins with the text of the treaty,
assigning only a secondary role to any views by the US Government amongst
multiple other extra-textual elements. The Respondent highlighted in this regard

writings by Professor David Bederman contending that views of the US

Government are only one of several factors the US Supreme Court now weighs in
treaty cases, including elements such as other Governments’ views and international
tribunals’ interpretations.*° In Professor Bederman’s view, no single factor

necessarily holds a privileged place.

As a tribunal created by international law under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven, this
Tribunal owes no special deference to the views of the Respondent as a NAFTA
Party. This Tribunal’s task is to interpret NAFTA in accordance with the
international law rules governing treaty interpretation, as provided by NAFTA
Article 1131(1). Canons of interpretation operating only in US domestic law are not
relevant to this Tribunal. The Tribunal considers that its mandate under NAFTA
Article 1131(1) is absolute: it would be a violation of that mandate for this Tribunal
to interpret and apply NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven taking into account any canon of
construction under US law unduly favourable to the Respondent and unfavourable
to the Claimants. Hence, any award by this Tribunal could not apply the canon so
criticised by the Claimants; and accordingly no jurisdictional decision by this
Tribunal should be judicially reviewable before any Court by reference to any such

canon.

The Tribunal nonetheless recognises, as the Parties themselves acknowledged, that
the Claimants’ deference argument is novel in the NAFTA context. So far as this
Tribunal was informed, no US court has addressed this argument in regard to an
arbitration award, still less any investor-state award. Thus, the Tribunal faces
different and unresolved legal theories as to how a domestic US canon of
construction might operate in any possible future US litigation to set aside an award
by this Tribunal under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven. On one hand, the US Supreme
Court does indeed assert that an administration’s treaty interpretation “is entitled to
great weight.’° However, the US Supreme Court also maintains that it should “give
respectful consideration to the interpretation of an international treaty rendered by

an international court with jurisdiction to interpret” it.”

A46. — This Tribunal is not a US court. It cannot decide how US courts might resolve the
tensions in this uncertain and disputed area of domestic US law. However, the
possibility that a deference doctrine might be invoked and upheld in future litigation
to set aside an award clearly creates an element of legal uncertainty. Is that

theoretical uncertainty a bar to New York as a legal place for this arbitration?

AA7. — The Tribunal answers this question in the negative. The Tribunal would regard the
invocation of any deference argument by the Respondent in any future litigation
between the Parties over an award by this Tribunal as being wholly inconsistent
with the Respondent’s commitment to international arbitration under NAFTA
Articles 1116 and 1117. In the Tribunal’s view, consent by the Respondent to a
process of international arbitration under a treaty, such as NAFTA’s Chapter
Eleven, carries with it an obligation in good faith not to seek an escape from an
adverse award by invoking a US domestic law doctrine that is not recognised in, and
has no authority, in international law, particularly by virtue of NAFTA Article
1131(1). The Tribunal cannot here assume that the Respondent, by its executive or

judicial branches, would violate its obligation under international law.

A48. As noted above, following this Tribunal’s decision on New York as the legal place
of this arbitration on 6 November 2012, the US Supreme Court decided the appeal
in BG Group on 5 March 2014, restoring the decision of the arbitration tribunal. For
the majority of the Supreme Court, in addressing the issues of admissibility and
jurisdiction, Justice Breyer decided that US courts “presume that the parties intend
arbitrators, not courts, to decide disputes about the meaning and application of
particular procedural conditions for the use of arbitration.”** The Supreme Court
found nothing in the United Kingdom-Argentina bilateral investment treaty to
overcome this presumption. The Court also rejected the position of the US Solicitor-
General that the BIT’s local litigation provision should be treated differently
because it was a condition laid down in a treaty between States, and not a private
party.” The Supreme Court saw no reason with a treaty to warrant “abandoning, or

increasing the complexity of, our ordinary intent-determining framework” for

arbitration agreements.” In the Tribunal’s view, this majority decision of the US
Supreme Court confirms that a US Court (not limited to New York) presented with
an application by a party to review an arbitral award must do so under a “highly
deferential” standard in favour of the award, which is inconsistent with the
deference to the Respondent’s executive branch raised by the Claimants. The
Tribunal acknowledges that the Respondent was not a party to the BIT; and it
recognises that the Parties have had no opportunity to comment on the US Supreme
Court’s decision. Hence, for present purposes, the Tribunal places no reliance on the
Supreme Court’s judgment as a reason for its decision on New York as the legal

place of this arbitration.

Conclusion: Having discounted this remaining factor under consideration (i)
potentially weighing against New York and in favour of Toronto, the Tribunal (by a
majority) confirms for the reasons stated above that New York should be and is the
legal place of this arbitration, as decided pursuant to NAFTA Article 20(1) of the
ICSID Arbitration AF Rules. As stated, this is a majority decision: Mr. Rowley’s

dissent from these reasons is set out in the following two Paragraphs.

Dissent: Mr. Rowley agrees that the possibility that a deference doctrine might be
invoked and upheld in future litigation to set aside an award does not result in a bar,
as such, to the choice by the Tribunal of New York as the legal place for this

arbitration.

However, where, as here, the decisive consideration in a choice between New York
and Toronto is the comparative levelness of the legal playing fields provided under
the competing lex loci arbitri, Mr. Rowley considers that the US Supreme Court’s
requirement for New York courts to give “great weight” to the executive branch’s
interpretation of a treaty (here, NAFTA) tips the scale in favour of Toronto. With
respect to the majority’s view, expressed in Paragraph A.44 above, it is by no means
clear to Mr. Rowley that the canon of interpretation enunciated in cases such as
Sumitomo Shoji America, Inc. v. Avagliano, and Abbott v. Abbott (cited above) is
inapplicable in a judicial review by the New York courts of a jurisdictional decision

by the Tribunal.

PART II - THE PARTIES’ DISPUTE

Introduction

The Tribunal summarises below the broad scope of the Parties’ jurisdictional and
substantive disputes in these arbitration proceedings. These summaries are made
solely for later ease of reference and to ensure that what follows may be more
readily comprehensible; and none is intended to describe the full scope of the
Parties’ respective cases as presented to the Tribunal in thousands of pages,
numerous factual and expert witnesses and a lengthy hearing. In particular, the mere
fact that a Party’s submission is not expressly recorded below should not be taken as
meaning that the Tribunal has overlooked it or, by itself, that the submission has

played no part in the Tribunal’s decisions.

It is appropriate to begin these summaries with the Claimants’ case and to follow
with the Respondent’s case. It is then appropriate to address the written submission

made under NAFTA Article 1128 by the United Mexican States.

The Claimants’ Case

In summary, the Claimants contend that the Tribunal has jurisdiction under NAFTA.
to decide the Parties’ dispute and should decide that the Respondent has violated its
substantive obligations towards each of the Claimants (for itself and Apotex-US)
under NAFTA, requiring the Respondent to pay substantial monetary compensation

to the Claimants, with interest and costs.

Apotex-Holdings: According to the Claimants, Apotex-Holdings is a Canadian
investor in the generic pharmaceutical industry. It has over the past two decades
made substantial investments in Apotex-US, a US company that it indirectly owns
and controls. Accordingly, within the meaning of NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven, the
Claimants submit that Apotex-Holdings is an “investor” with Apotex-US as its

“investment.”

Apotex-US: According to the Claimants, the business of Apotex-US is the sale
within the USA of drugs produced by other Apotex companies, notably by Apotex

Inc., a Canadian generic drug manufacturer that Apotex-Holdings also indirectly

Part II — Page 1 of 19

2.6.

2.7.

2.8.

2.9.

owns and controls. Due to the substantial investment of capital, know-how and
expertise by Apotex-Holdings, according to the Claimants, Apotex-US at the
beginning of 2009 was one of the most successful generic drug companies in the
USA measured by sales volume. As at mid-2009, Apotex-US had the sixth-highest

sales of any generic drug company in the USA.

Apotex Inc.: Apotex Inc. operates several facilities in Canada. Two of its production
facilities are located at: (i) Signet Drive in Toronto, Ontario (“Signet”) and (ii)
Etobicoke, Ontario (“Etobicoke”). The Signet and Etobicoke facilities produce oral
solid-dose medicinal products, such as tablets. Certain of these products were sold
by Apotex-US on the US market; and, as at mid-2009, those products accounted for
about 80% of sales by Apotex-US in the USA. The Etobicoke facility also
performed research and development; and the Signet facility was seeking to produce

drug products in injectable form.

According to the Claimants, Apotex Inc. is also an “investor” within the meaning of
NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven, having as its “investment” Abbreviated New Drug
Applications (“ANDAs”) approved by the US Food and Drug Administration
(“FDA”), also called by the Claimants “marketing authorizations.” The Claimants
further submit, given that Apotex Inc. is indirectly owned by Apotex-Holdings, that
these ANDAs are also an “investment” of Apotex-Holdings. At the time of the
FDA’s Import Alert in August 2009 (described below), Apotex Inc. had 153
ANDAs permitting the sale of its drugs in the USA manufactured at its two

Canadian facilities (ANDAs being site specific).

State Regulators: As a Canadian drug manufacturer, Apotex Inc. was and remains
primarily regulated and controlled by Health Canada, an agency of the Canadian
State. Apotex Inc.’s facilities have been regularly inspected by Health Canada since
the mid-1970s. Because Apotex Inc. also supplies the US drug market, its
production sites have also periodically been inspected by the FDA, as an agency of

the Respondent.

As acknowledged by the Claimants, inspections by Health Canada and the FDA
customarily address a multitude of matters associated with modern pharmaceutical

production. These include what are known as current good manufacturing practices

Part II — Page 2 of 19

2.10.

2.11.

2.12.

2.13.

2.14.

(“cGMP”), being standards developed through consultations between industry and
regulatory agencies and then codified in regulations. These regulatory standards
address, among other topics, the proper design, monitoring and control of drug

manufacturing processes at facilities, such as Signet and Etobicoke.

The Act: Under the US Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“the Act’), the FDA
assesses conformity with cGMP in part through on-site inspections of
pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities, both within the USA and abroad. Because
the FDA’s cGMP standards are by their nature general, according to the Claimants,
their application to specific processes, equipment and facilities leaves much to the

discretion of manufacturers.

At the conclusion of a facility’s inspection, FDA inspectors record their written
observations on a standard form known as “Form 483.” A Form 483 lists
inspectional observations; they do not represent the FDA’s final determination
regarding a manufacturer’s compliance with cGMP standards. A manufacturer may
provide comments on the FDA inspectors’ observations to the FDA; and these

observations and comments are reviewed by the FDA.

If the FDA decides that the manufacturer has not responded adequately to
significant cGMP violations at the facility, the FDA may issue a “warning letter.”
According to the Claimants, a manufacturer is afforded an opportunity to comment
to the FDA in response to a warning letter; and the FDA typically takes that
comment into account in determining whether or not to take enforcement actions

against the manufacturer and its facility.

Such enforcement actions could include the seizure of the manufacturer’s products
or a civil action in the US courts seeking injunctive relief against the manufacturer.
Such an injunction (issued by a US court) could preclude the continued marketing
of affected products until the FDA confirms the manufacturer’s compliance with

cGMP.

According to the Claimants, the Act also authorises the Respondent to detain,
physically examine and refuse admission of a product into the USA if the product is
“adulterated” within the meaning of the Act. Under US legislation, a drug is

considered “adulterated” if the methods or facilities used to produce it do not

conform to cGMP so as to ensure the safety, identity, strength, quality and purity of

the drug required by the Act.

Based on the Act, according to the Claimants, the FDA has created a measure
known as an import alert; i.e. a notice by the FDA to US customs officials added to
a general import alert that calls for detention without physical examination of a
specified category of products. In practice, the result often is not the actual detention
of a product; but a refusal at the US border of admission into the USA of all

products within the specified category.

FDA Inspections: Before 2008, the FDA had inspected Apotex Inc.’s facilities in
Signet and Etobicoke on numerous occasions since 2002. Until 2008, according to
the Claimants, the FDA had never recorded any cGMP violation at these two

facilities (nor at any other Apotex facilities elsewhere).

In April 2002, May 2005 and November 2006, the FDA had inspected the
Etobicoke facility; and the FDA had inspected the Signet facility in September
2000, March 2003 and June 2006. During the 2000, 2002 and 2006 inspections,
FDA inspectors made certain observations concerning cGMP at these two facilities;
but, after receiving Apotex Inc.’s clarifications, the FDA found cGMP compliance

at both facilities to be sufficient.

The 2008 Etobicoke Inspection: From 10 to 19 December 2008, the FDA inspected
Apotex Inc.’s facility at Etobicoke. At the end of this inspection, the FDA
inspectors issued three pages of observations on their Form 483, listing 11 alleged
deviations from cGMP. According to the Claimants, the FDA inspectors did not
suggest that their observations raised any actual concern as to the continued

manufacture or distribution in the USA of drugs manufactured at Etobicoke.

Later, on 30 January 2009, Apotex Inc. provided an eight-page written response to
the FDA inspectors’ observations. As promised in its response, so the Claimants
contend, Apotex Inc. enhanced its quality and manufacturing processes and
equipment at Etobicoke in the first half of 2009. Apotex Inc. received no further
communication from the FDA concerning Etobicoke for several months, until June

2009.

The Etobicoke Warning Letter: On 25 June 2009, the FDA issued a warning letter
identifying three issues of concern to the FDA (the “Etobicoke warning letter”). The
Claimants contend that only two of these issues concerned cGMP. Of these, the first
was not identified as an issue by the FDA inspectors on their Form 483
observations; and the second issue was stated as a request for further information,
rather than a finding of any violation. The remaining Form 483 observations were

either resolved by Apotex Inc.’s response or otherwise not adopted by the FDA.

The 2009 Signet Inspection: From 27 July to 14 August 2009, the FDA inspected
Apotex Inc.’s facility at Signet. At the close of the inspection, the FDA inspectors
issued a list of 17 observations on their Form 483. The FDA inspectors asked
Apotex Inc. to schedule a telephone conference call with the FDA to discuss these

observations. (This was on Friday, 14 August 2009).

On Monday, 17 August 2009 (i.e. one working day later), Apotex Inc. held the
required conference call with the FDA. While noting that it was still studying the
Form 483 observations, Apotex Inc. undertook voluntarily to recall 675 batches of

drug products from the US market as a precautionary measure.

By an internal memorandum dated 20 August 2009, the FDA’s director of
compliance for drug products requested that the FDA director of import operations
amend the existing Import Alert 66-40 to include all products manufactured at the
Etobicoke and Signet facilities. The request was made without the benefit of Apotex
Inc.’s written response to the Signet Form 483 (which was only due on 4 September
2009); and the FDA had provided no prior notice to Apotex Inc. of its proposed

enforcement action.

The 2009 Import Alert: On 28 August 2009, the FDA amended Import Alert 66-40
to include all products produced by the Etobicoke and Signet facilities (the “Import
Alert”). The Claimants contend that the FDA provided no notice of this measure to
Apotex Inc. or any other Apotex company. The measure prevented Apotex-US from
receiving for sale in the USA any product manufactured at the Etobicoke and Signet
facilities. In addition, the FDA suspended consideration of any new ANDAs for
drugs produced or to be produced by Apotex Inc. at these two facilities. It therefore

prohibited Apotex-US from bringing to market any of Apotex Inc.’s new solid dose

2.25.

2.26.

2.27.

generic drugs, effectively eliminating Apotex-US’s ability to secure the advantage

of statutory marketing exclusivity for new products in the USA.

The Import Alert remained in place for a period of almost two years. The FDA did
not lift in full the Import Alert regarding both Etobicoke and Signet facilities until

the end of July 2011, belatedly so according to the Claimants.

The Claimants contend that the FDA’s actions taken against Apotex Inc. were
exceptional, indeed unique, as the FDA itself recognised in public speeches made
by its senior officers at the time. According to the Claimants, the FDA had never
before rushed to take action against a major pharmaceutical company in the absence
of any actual or imminent health hazard and without providing to such company any
real opportunity to address the FDA’s concerns. The Claimants also complain at the
FDA’s complete lack of procedural due process: the Import Alert was issued
without any notice to the Claimants; no reasons for the notice were made known to
the Claimants; no opportunity was granted to the Claimants to dispute the notice or
even to present evidence in support of the Claimants’ position; and no access was
accorded to any court for judicial review or even any review by an impartial
decision-maker. The Claimants allege, in particular, that the purpose of the FDA’s
Signet inspection was “was to identify cGMP deviations to support an Import Alert.
FDA’s judgment against Apotex had already been made.”' The Claimants also
allege that the FDA’s true reason for the Import Alert “was to demonstrate FDA’s
new tough enforcement policy and to provide an example which FDA could hold
out for the world to see” and in its rush to judgment “to make Apotex an example ...

even though its treatment of Apotex was completely unjustified.”?

Jurisdiction: The Claimants contend that no jurisdictional issue can arise in regard
to Apotex-Holdings and Apotex-US respectively as a qualified “investor” and a
covered “investment” under NAFTA Chapter Eleven. As regards the Import Alert,
the Claimants submit that it did “relate to” Apotex-US within the meaning of
NAFTA Article 1101(1): Apotex—US was established specifically as the marketing
and distribution arm of Apotex Inc. (to which the Import Alert was directed);

Apotex Inc. sold its products exclusively through Apotex-US in the USA; Apotex-

US was the sole commercial importer and distributor of record for drugs
manufactured at the Etobicoke and Signet facilities; following the Import Alert,
Apotex-US was a named addressee of the Respondent’s notices of detention; and
the Import Alert directly prevented Apotex-US from carrying on its business for
almost two years, causing it to suffer severe financial losses. Hence, so the
Claimants argue, the Import Alert “related” both to Apotex-US as an “investment”

and also to its “investor”, Apotex-Holdings.*

As regards Apotex Inc., the Claimants contend that its ANDAs are “intangible
property” under NAFTA Article 1139(g). The Claimants further submit that
ANDAs are “interests” under NAFTA Article 1139(h). Hence, so the Claimants
argue, Apotex Inc. is an “investor” with its ANDAs as “investments” and, further,
Apotex-Holdings is an “investor” with the same “investments”, given its status as

the ultimate (indirect) owner of Apotex Inc.*

The Claimants contend that, as a matter of jurisdiction, there can be no jurisdictional
objection arising from the Apotex I & II Award made by the NAFTA Tribunal in

5

the “Apotex I & II Arbitration’? (to which the Tribunal returns below), as argued by

the Respondent.°

Liability: The Claimants contend that the Import Alert violated NAFTA Article
1102 (National Treatment), Article 1103 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment) and
Article 1105 (Minimum Standard of Treatment). The Claimants also contend, by
virtue of NAFTA Article 1103 and Annex IV, that the Respondent also violated
Article II(2) and II(6) of the Jamaica-USA BIT.

Articles 1102 & 1103: During the relevant time period, the Claimants contend that
the FDA accorded more favourable treatment to US investors and US owned
investments in like circumstances to Apotex-Holdings, Apotex Inc. and Apotex-US
in violation of NAFTA Article 1102. The Claimants submit that no such investor or
investment was subjected to a measure as severe as the Import Alert imposed on the

Apotex companies. The Claimants also contend that investors of other countries and

investments owned by such investors in like circumstances also received more
favourable treatment than the treatment accorded to the Apotex companies in
violation of NAFTA Article 1103. The Claimants refer to a number of such
comparators, particularly the Teva group of companies (“Teva”) and the

Sandoz/Novartis companies (“Sandoz”).’

Article 1105: The Claimants complain at the FDA’s lack of basic procedural due
process, amounting to a violation by the Respondent of NAFTA Article 1105 and
Article II of the Jamaica-USA BIT.® Whilst the Claimants do not agree in this
proceeding with the FDA’s determination that Apotex Inc.’s two facilities were not
compliant with cGMP, the Claimants do not, however, here seek to impugn the
FDA’s substantive decisions: i.e. “[w]hether FDA was right or wrong about

Apotex’s cGMP compliance ... is not a part of the claims presented in this case.”°

The Jamaica-USA BIT: The Claimants submit that, with the FDA’s deficient
procedure regarding the Import Alert, the Respondent violated Article II(2)(b) & (6)
of the Jamaica-USA BIT."°

Quantum: Because of the Import Alert, according to the Claimants, Apotex-
Holdings, Apotex Inc. and Apotex-US suffered substantial damage. In particular,
Apotex-US's business was decimated, with 80% of its supplies cut-off from Canada;
Apotex Inc. and Apotex-US lost sales in excess of US$ 500 million; Apotex-US
dropped from being a market leader for generic drugs in the USA to the bottom
ranks; and Apotex Inc. was prevented from bringing any new drugs to the US
market. The Claimants estimate that financial losses to the Claimants resulting from
the Respondent’s violations of NAFTA amount to between US$ 1.0 billion to US$
1.5 billion (as at early 2013) for which the Respondent is liable to pay compensation

to the Claimants, subject to upward revision for continuing losses.'!

Given that all quantum issues have been bifurcated to another phase of these
proceedings (if and to the extent relevant), it is unnecessary to describe the

Claimants’ case on quantum any further.

Relief: Accordingly, the Claimants seek a decision in their favour, as against the
Respondent, on both jurisdiction and liability; namely dismissing the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections; holding that the Respondent has breached NAFTA Articles
1102, 1103 and 1105 and the Jamaica-USA BIT; and ordering a further phase of this
proceeding on damages in accordance with the formal relief recorded in their
written pleadings, as set out in Part I above and confirmed in their closing oral

submissions at the Hearing. R

The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide
the Parties’ dispute under NAFTA; and, if the Tribunal were to exercise jurisdiction
over any of the Claimants’ claims, that the Tribunal should decide that the
Respondent has not violated any of its substantive obligations under NAFTA or the
Jamaica-USA BIT; and that no compensation is payable to the Claimants.
According to the Respondent, the Tribunal should deny all the Claimants’ claims
concerning the Respondent’s lawful and appropriate exercise of its authority to
protect the health of its own people in its own territory. The Tribunal should also
recognise, according to the Respondent, that the Claimants’ complaint is in fact
directed at a trade measure, addressed only to Apotex Inc.’s two foreign facilities,
and that the Claimants are seeking improperly in these proceedings to convert a
possible trade-related claim between NAFTA Contracting States (under NAFTA
Chapter Twenty) into an investment claim by a foreign entity (under NAFTA

Chapter Eleven).

The Respondent also contends that, for more than a century, the Respondent has
established laws and regulations to prevent the importation of adulterated drugs in
order to protect public health in the USA. The FDA’s policy on import alerts has
been in effect since at least the 1970s. The Respondent did not relinquish this

authority and responsibility when it concluded NAFTA. Nor did the Respondent

2.43.

(with its NAFTA Contracting Parties) establish the form of investment arbitration
under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven to resolve complaints by foreign entities whose

adulterated drugs have been turned away at the US border.

The Respondent contends that the material facts in this case are largely undisputed

between the Parties, as listed below (according to the Respondent).

The 2008 Etobicoke Inspection: In December 2008, the FDA inspected Apotex
Inc.’s manufacturing facilities at Etobicoke following complaints from US patients,
doctors and pharmacists about problems with Apotex drugs. The eight-day
inspection by the FDA inspectors uncovered significant violations of US laws and
regulations, including numerous deviations from cGMP. The FDA inspectors

informed Apotex Inc. of their findings at the close of this inspection.

The 2009 Etobicoke Warning Letter: The FDA subsequently issued to Apotex Inc. a
“warning letter” dated 25 June 2009, apprising Apotex Inc. that drugs from its
Etobicoke facility were adulterated under US law and thus could be denied
admission to the USA. The FDA further warned Apotex Inc. that the FDA could
withhold approval of new drug applications linked to the Etobicoke facility. Apotex
Inc. acknowledged serious problems with its manufacturing practices and promised

to implement corrective action.

The 2009 Signet Inspection: In August 2009, the FDA’s inspectors inspected
Apotex Inc.’s Signet facilities. This inspection was prompted by the serious cGMP
deficiencies found at the Etobicoke facilities and by additional complaints that the
FDA had received concerning the quality and efficacy of Apotex’s products in the

USA.

According to the Respondent, this 14-day inspection by the FDA’s inspectors
uncovered significant violations of US laws and regulations at the Signet facility,
including numerous cGMP deficiencies, several of which mirrored those found at
the Etobicoke facility. These violations affected many products and confirmed
systemic problems with Apotex Inc.’s entire manufacturing program. The FDA
inspectors found that Apotex had distributed products in the US market
contaminated with hair, glue, plastic, nylon, metal, rust, acetate fibres,

fluorocarbons and PVC-based material. The FDA inspectors also cited Apotex Inc.

Part II — Page 10 of 19

2.44.

2.45.

2.46.

for improperly produced and misbranded drug products; poor cleaning practices; a
failure to investigate or report manufacturing problems properly; inadequate

production procedures; poor recordkeeping; and numerous other serious failings.

The Import Alert: The FDA placed Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke and Signet facilities on
“Import Alert” in August 2009, signalling that drugs from those facilities were
adulterated and could be detained at the US border without physical examination.
Apotex Inc. did not dispute FDA’s cGMP findings or protest at having been placed
on Import Alert. Nor did Apotex Inc. exercise its right to challenge the FDA’s

actions in US administrative proceedings or in US federal court.

After being placed on Import Alert in August 2009, Apotex Inc. accepted
responsibility for systemic problems with its manufacturing practices; recalled
adulterated drug products from the US market; hired third-party consultants to help
bring its facilities into compliance with US law; and promised to overhaul its

operations, management structure, and quality control systems.

Apotex Inc.’s primary regulator, Health Canada, launched its own inspections of the
Etobicoke and Signet facilities. Health Canada corroborated the FDA’s findings,
recording 37 “major observations” at these two sites. Health Canada discovered, for
instance, “a dead insect or insect fragment” in active pharmaceutical ingredients,
prompting Apotex Inc. to recall drugs using those ingredients from the Canadian
market. Health Canada further faulted Apotex Inc. for using the same material to
fabricate cytotoxic and non-cytotoxic materials without taking proper precautions to
prevent cross-contamination, being a violation that alone would have warranted
stripping Apotex Inc. of its establishment license under Canadian law. Health
Canada also discovered that Apotex Inc. had, among other violations, misreported
test results; released failed products for sale in Canada; failed to conduct timely
investigations of potentially unsafe products; and delayed recalling product until
long after learning of health risks to patients. Apotex Inc. also acknowledged
problems with its manufacturing practices and pledged to address the “system
deficiencies highlighted by them.” Health Canada opted not to shut down Apotex
Inc.’s facilities (because Apotex is Canada’s largest supplier of generic drugs); but it
placed Apotex under close and continuous on-site supervision for more than a year,

so as to ensure that Apotex followed through with its promised corrective actions.

2.47.

2.48.

2.49.

2.50.

During 2009 and 2010, the FDA communicated continuously with Apotex on how
to achieve sustainable compliance with US law, devoting extraordinary agency
resources to that task. Apotex Inc. only notified FDA that its facilities would be
ready for re-inspection in October 2010, more than a year after the FDA’s Import

Alert.

The FDA’s follow-up re-inspections of the Etobicoke and Signet facilities in
January and February 2011 revealed significant and on-going cGMP problems;
and accordingly the FDA investigators recommended against the lifting of the
Import Alert. Nonetheless, after evaluating Apotex’s corrective reactions and its
plans for continued improvements, the FDA decided to lift the Import Alert as
regards products manufactured at the Etobicoke and Signet facilities. The FDA
also resumed its evaluation of whether, from a cGMP perspective, the FDA could

approve Apotex’s drug applications from the Etobicoke and Signet facilities.

The Respondent contends that the Claimants do not materially dispute any these
facts. The Claimants, according to the Respondent, merely belittle and disregard
their serious nature. The Respondent contends that the FDA cannot allow a
company to market drugs in the USA, in the Claimants’ language, that “almost
without exception” are safe and effective; or that fail testing “only” 11 per cent of
the time; and that when serious manufacturing and quality control problems are
identified by the FDA, mere “good will gestures” by Apotex Inc. should suffice for
the FDA. As the meningitis outbreak in the USA tragically demonstrated,
pharmaceutical products manufactured in violation of cGMP can be deadly for
patients. The Respondent submits that all companies, foreign and domestic, must
comply with current good manufacturing practice to market their drugs to patients

in the USA.

The Respondent submits that the Claimants are wrong to blame the FDA for
having prevented Apotex Inc. from exporting adulterated drugs to the USA; and
wrong to claim that the Respondent (i.e. the US taxpayer) should compensate
Apotex Inc. for the costs of bringing its own manufacturing practices into
compliance with US law. The Respondent also submits that the Claimants are
wrong in asserting their claims as an investment dispute in order to claim

significant damages from the Respondent as a foreign investor under NAFTA’s

Part II — Page 12 of 19

2.51.

2.52.

2.53.

Chapter Eleven. The Respondent accordingly disputes the Claimants’ case, both as

a matter of jurisdiction and on the merits.

Jurisdiction: In regard to the Claimants’ claim that Apotex Inc., a Canadian drug
manufacturer with facilities only in Canada, is an “investor” that made and sought
to make “investments” in the USA, the Respondent submits that the Claimants
have failed to establish that Apotex Inc. has made or even sought to make any
investments in the USA within the meaning of “investment” and “investor” in
NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven. The Respondent submits that Apotex Inc. does not
claim to manufacture or even test any drugs in the USA; nor does it assert the
existence of any offices or employees in the USA; it pays no taxes in the USA on
its supposed investments (including its ANDA-related activities); it does not claim
to prepare its drug applications to the FDA in the USA; and it does not own or

control Apotex-US. 8B

According to the Respondent, the issue of jurisdiction in regard to Apotex Inc.
turns decisively upon the character of its ANDAs. The Respondent submits that
ANDAs, whether unapproved, tentatively approved or finally approved (in whole
or in part) are incapable of being “investments” under NAFTA Article 1139(g) or
Article 1139(h). Even after approval, ANDAs remain revocable by the FDA; and,
in the Respondent’s submission, an ANDA is no more than an application by a

foreign drug manufacturer for permission to export its drug products to the usa."

Further, the Respondent relies upon the reasoning to this effect, operating as res
judicata in this arbitration, contained in the Apotex I & II Award. Although that
earlier arbitration decided claims relating to tentatively approved ANDAs (rather,
as here, finally approved ANDAs), the Respondent submits that this is a distinction
without a difference. The Respondent invites the Tribunal to reject jurisdiction
over all claims made by Apotex Inc. and related claims by Apotex-Holdings.'*
(The Respondent does not here contend that the Apotex I & II Award has any

preclusive effect on Apotex-Holdings’ claim to be an investor by virtue of its

investment in Apotex-US, being “a jurisdictional issue obviously not arbitrated or

determined in the previous proceeding.”)'©

As regards Apotex-Holdings’ other claims, the Respondent agrees that Apotex-
Holdings is an “investor” within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(a). The
Respondent accepts that Apotex-Holdings committed to establish Apotex-US as a
US distributor of generic drugs; hence Apotex-US may be regarded as an
investment by Apotex-Holdings; but that is not enough, according to the
Respondent, to establish Apotex-Holdings’ investment claim under NAFTA’s

Chapter Eleven. "7

The Respondent submits that NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven also requires that the
challenged measure “relate to”, or in other words have a “legally significant
connection” to the investor or the investor’s investment. The only measure
challenged by the Claimants in this case is the Import Alert; but that Import Alert
did not “relate to” Apotex-Holdings as an investor, nor to Apotex-US as an
investment which continued to market generic drugs in the USA throughout the

period of the Import Alert.!®

The Respondent also contends that an Import Alert operates under US law only as
internal agency guidance: it does not now provide for “automatic detention”;'? and
“fijt is neither necessary nor sufficient for the detention of drugs.” The
Respondent submits that products shipped by Apotex Inc. were detained at the
USA-Canadian border because such products were adulterated. The relevant
measure, according to the Respondent, was either: (i) the FDA’s determination that
Apotex Inc.’s two facilities were not cGMP compliant and its products therefore
adulterated under US law; or (ii) the Respondent’s notices of detention addressed
to Apotex Inc.’s consignees in the USA, i.e. Apotex- US (but equally so any other
consignee of products made at these two facilities). The Claimants, however, do

not complain about either of these two measures in these proceedings.

The Respondent acknowledges that Apotex Inc. was effectively prevented from
exporting its drugs to any US distributor, including Apotex-US. The Respondent
contends that, although the Claimants seek to show that the Import Alert
particularly related to Apotex-US because of its relationship with Apotex Inc., the
Claimants’ arguments directly contradict formal statements previously made by
Apotex companies before several US courts to the effect that Apotex Inc. and
Apotex-US are separate and independent companies. According to the Respondent,
the Claimants cannot here opportunistically argue one thing to establish
jurisdiction before this Tribunal; but the opposite when seeking to avoid

jurisdiction before US courts.

The Respondent invites the Tribunal to reject jurisdiction over all claims made by

Apotex Inc. and Apotex-Holdings.

Liability: As to the merits of the Claimants’ claims (assuming jurisdiction), the
Respondent contends that the Claimants do not dispute that Apotex Inc.’s drugs
were adulterated as a matter of US law; nor do the Claimants challenge the
underlying legality of import alerts as a policy exercisable by the FDA, given

similar policies by Canada and other States.

Articles 1102 & 1103 NAFTA: The Respondent denies any breach of NAFTA
Articles 1102 and 1103. It also denies any breach of the Jamaica-USA BIT. In
particular, the Respondent contends that the Claimants’ claims that the Respondent
accorded better treatment to US and foreign companies, in violation of NAFTA
Articles 1102 (national treatment) and 1103 (most-favoured-nation treatment),

suffer from three major defects.”!

First, the Claimants cannot establish a national or most-favoured-nation treatment
claim because the Import Alert (which applied to Apotex Inc.’s two Canadian
manufacturing facilities) had no legally significant connection to Apotex-Holdings

as an “investor” or to Apotex-US as its “investment” under NAFTA Article 1101;

and neither Apotex-Holdings nor Apotex-US received any relevant “treatment”

under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103.”

Second, the Claimants cannot establish a national treatment claim under NAFTA
Article 1102, because the Claimants have failed to identify any comparators in
“like circumstances.” In particular, the Claimants cite the FDA’s treatment of drug
manufacturing facilities in the USA; but these are obviously not subject to import
alerts; and thus they cannot be in “like circumstances” with Apotex Inc., with only

foreign facilities in Canada.”*

Third, the Claimants cannot establish a most-favoured-nation treatment claim
under NAFTA Article 1103, because the Claimants have failed to identify any
third country-owned comparator that received in like circumstances more
favourable treatment than the Claimants. Of the comparators cited by the
Claimants, for instance, one drug manufacturer shut down the operations of its
non-compliant facilities; and another manufacturer had two facilities placed on
import alert for more than three years, forfeited dozens of drug applications and set
aside US$ 500 million for potential civil and criminal penalties. The Respondent
submits that the Claimants’ allegation that the Respondent discriminated in favour

of these foreign manufacturers is factually wrong.”

Article 1105 NAFTA: The Respondent submits that the Claimants’ claim under
NAFTA Article 1105 claim is baseless on the merits. The Respondent notes that
the Claimants contend that the FDA (i.e. the Respondent) should have allowed
Apotex Inc. to continue exporting adulterated drugs to the USA until it had been
afforded six “procedural safeguards”: (i) a hearing; (ii) with advance notice; (iii)
before an impartial body; (iv) where the party may present evidence and contest
the decision; (v) with a reasoned decision relying on all relevant legal and factual
considerations; and (vi) with judicial review of that decision. Failure to provide
these, so the Claimants assert, put the Respondent in violation of the customary

international law minimum standard of treatment. The Respondent denies that

these are customary rules of international law that form part of the minimum

standard of treatment under NAFTA Article 1105.7°

The Respondent submits that the Claimants have not established their supposed
new standard as rule of customary international law, nor any general and consistent
practice of States followed from a sense of legal obligation requiring these
generous “safeguards” before blocking the importation of foreign adulterated
drugs. The Respondent submits that the Claimants have merely plucked their
proposed new rule from soft law sources, law review articles, working papers, and
human rights, trade and European Union decisions that have no bearing on this
case. The Respondent submits that international law does not require that a State
continue to allow the import of adulterated drugs whilst the foreign manufacturer
conducts litigation over that State’s decision to bar such imports made on grounds
of public health and for the safety of its own people; and that, if it did, the
implications of any such rule would be enormous and potentially dangerous for

patients.

Currently, the USA imports about 40% of its finished drug products and about
80% of its active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) from more than 100 countries
around the world. The heparin scandal in 2007, caused by a contaminant in the
drug’s API manufactured at a facility in China, demonstrates, according to the
Respondent, the “difficult and complicated balancing of risk” required of the

FDA.”®

Moreover, so the Respondent submits, even if the Claimants could demonstrate the
existence of such a new rule of customary international law, the evidence shows
that the Respondent actually offered the Claimants the “procedural safeguards”
they now claim were due to them, both as administrative and judicial processes.
But the Claimants chose not to invoke them, for good reasons: Apotex Inc.
acknowledged as significant its cGMP violations; its third party consultants
confirmed the findings of the FDA’s inspectors; and Apotex Inc. took over a year

to prepare itself for the FDA’s re-inspections.

Jamaica-USA BIT: The Respondent submits that the Jamaica-USA BIT does not
assist the Claimants’ case under NAFTA Article 1105 or at all: its terms add
nothing to NAFTA Article 1105 (read with the Free Trade Commission’s binding
interpretation); and NAFTA Article 1103 cannot expand the substantive scope of
NAFTA Article 1105. For all these reasons, the Respondent denies any breach of
NAFTA Article 1105 and Article II of the Jamaica-USA BIT.””

Quantum: As to the quantum of compensation claimed by the Claimants, the
Respondent denies the basis on which these claims are made. The Respondent
notes that the quantum of the Claimants’ claim is || times greater than their
claimed sales in the USA, Hi times greater than their annual worldwide sales (in
more than 115 countries) and greater than the value of the entire Apotex group of

companies.

As already indicated, given that quantum is not an issue for present purposes, it is

unnecessary here to summarise the Respondent’s case on quantum any further.

Relief: Accordingly, the Respondent submits that the Claimants’ claims fall outside
the scope and coverage of NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven. As a matter of jurisdiction
and/or, alternatively, the merits as to liability, the Respondent requests the
Tribunal to dismiss the Claimants’ claims with prejudice and in either case to
award to the Respondent, against the Claimants, the full costs of these arbitration
proceedings, in accordance with the formal relief recorded in its written pleadings,

as set out above and confirmed in its closing oral submissions at the Hearing.**

The Submission of the United Mexican States

In summary, with its written submission of 9 February 2013 under NAFTA Article
1128, the United Mexican States (“Mexico”) addresses NAFTA Article 1101(1)
and Article 1139(h), recording its concurrence with the written submissions made
by the Respondent in its Counter-Memorial (at Paragraphs 245-263). (This
submission did not address NAFTA Article 1139(g) separately).

Mexico submits that NAFTA Article 1101(1) is the jurisdictional gateway to the
dispute resolution and other provisions in NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven,” as it
establishes and places limits on the scope and coverage of Chapter Eleven.*! As
such, Mexico submits that Article 1101(1) is a necessary component of the context

required to interpret Article 1 139(h).*?

Mexico contends that it follows from Article 1101(1) that investments, as defined
by Article 1139(h), of an investor of a Party can only fall within the scope and
coverage of Chapter Eleven if they are located in the territory of another Party.**
Mexico submits that an investor of a Party must make a commitment of capital or
other resources in the territory of another Party in order to make an “investment”

within the meaning of Article 1139(h).™

To the extent that a comparison of NAFTA’s three language versions may reveal a
difference of meaning in the text of NAFTA Article 1139(h), Mexico submits, by
applying Article 33(4) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, that any
perceived discrepancy between the English and French texts (on the one hand) and
the Spanish text (on the other) is best reconciled by upholding the territoriality
requirement in Article 1139(h).*° Mexico bases this submission upon the
consistency of the English and French versions of Article 1139(h) with Article
1101(1).*°

PART III - THE PRINCIPAL FACTS

Introduction

It is necessary at the outset to summarise the principal facts relevant to the
Tribunal’s reasons for its several decisions below, many of which are materially fact
specific or at least require factual explanations. Whilst there is much common
ground between the Parties as regards these principal facts, there remain significant
differences, especially in regard to foreign comparators under NAFTA Article 1103.
Moreover, the facts are complicated; and their account is necessarily lengthy. Where
factual references are made later in this document, these should be read with the
fuller account of those facts summarised below, including their respective

evidentiary references.

The first chronology relates to the Claimants; and the second and third chronologies
relate to two principal foreign comparators invoked by the Claimants (“Teva” and
“Sandoz”, also described as “Sandoz/Novartis”). The first chronology is largely, but
not completely, undisputed by the Parties. The second and third chronologies are,

for the most part, not agreed by the Parties.

The Tribunal emphasises that these factual chronologies are only summaries, as
with the Parties’ submissions in Part II above. It would burden this document
unduly, even if it were possible, for all potentially relevant factual evidence,
documents and testimony to be set out here in the fullest detail. Nonetheless, as
earlier indicated with the Parties’ pleadings, it should be assumed that the Tribunal
has considered all relevant factual evidence adduced by the Parties in this arbitration
and, further, that no relevant evidence has been overlooked by the Tribunal by

reason only of its omission from the three summaries below.

The Apotex Chronology

The Tribunal has compiled the following factual chronology largely from the
documentary exhibits and written testimony cited by the Parties in their written and

oral pleadings in this arbitration, save where otherwise indicated.

The Apotex Group of Companies

Apotex-Holdings was founded in 1974 as a Canadian company in Toronto by Dr.
Barry Sherman. It functions as a vertically integrated holding company, operating as
a privately held corporation under the Canada Business Corporations Act. With its
subsidiaries, Apotex-Holdings employs over 7,500 people in research, development,
manufacturing and distribution facilities worldwide, becoming a leader in the North
American generic pharmaceutical market and distributing its drug products in 115
countries. In addition to the two manufacturing facilities at Signet and Etobicoke,
the Apotex group operates facilities in other locations in Canada, Mexico, China
and India (which are not relevant to this arbitration). The Apotex group of

companies operates no manufacturing facilities in the USA.

Apotex Inc. is a company incorporated under the laws of Ontario, Canada. It is
indirectly owned by Apotex-Holdings. As already described above, Apotex Inc.
operates the two manufacturing facilities in Canada at issue in this arbitration: (i)
Signet and (ii) Etobicoke. These two facilities produce solid-dose medicinal
products, such as tablets. Apotex Inc. is the largest Canadian-owned pharmaceutical
company in Canada, producing more than 300 kinds of generic drugs in about 4,000
dosages and formats. As a manufacturer of drugs for export to the USA, Apotex
Inc.’s drugs are subject to the Act and eligible for Import Alert 66-40. As a large
manufacturer with long experience of exporting its products to the USA, the senior
management of Apotex Inc. was familiar with the Act and the FDA’s functions

under US law.

Apotex-US is a corporation organised under the laws of Delaware, USA and
authorised to transact business in Florida, USA. It is indirectly owned by Apotex-
Holdings. Its principal business activity in the USA is selling drugs produced by
other Apotex companies, including Apotex Inc. In August 2009, sales of Apotex
Inc.’s solid dose products accounted for about 80% of Apotex-US’s sales in the
USA.! It maintains a storage facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, for products shipped

by Apotex Inc. from Canada.

In summary (as further described below), the FDA in 2006 separately inspected the
Signet and Etobicoke facilities, with no sanctions imposed by the FDA upon Apotex
Inc. (or any other member of the Apotex group of companies). In December 2008,
the FDA inspected the Etobicoke facility with adverse observations on the Form
483, resulting in the FDA’s warning letter dated 25 June 2009. In July-August 2009,
the FDA inspected the Signet facility with adverse observations on the Form 483.
On 28 August 2009, the FDA amended Import Alert 66-40 to include all finished
form drug products manufactured by Apotex Inc. at the Signet and Etobicoke
facilities. On 29 March 2010, the FDA sent a warning letter to Apotex Inc.
regarding the Signet facility. The FDA removed Apotex Inc.’s two facilities from
the Import Alert on 15 June 2011 (Etobicoke) and 29 July 2011 (Signet); and on 25
November 2011, the FDA resumed its approval of Apotex Inc.’s pending ANDAs

for products produced by its two Canadian facilities.

The 2006 Inspections of Signet and Etobicoke

From 26 June to 13 July 2006, the FDA inspected Apotex Inc.’s Signet facility in
Toronto, Canada.’ This is a large facility located at 150 Signet Drive, comprising of
a head office, dry products facility, commercial laboratory, R&D laboratory, raw
material warehouse and a regulatory affairs office extending over 575,000 sq. ft
The Form 483 issued by the FDA’s inspectors at the conclusion of this inspection
listed one “‘inspectional observation”, namely that there was no program to verify
that the current procedures were adequate to prevent contamination and cross-
contamination.’ After reviewing Apotex Inc.’s response to the Form 483, the FDA

classified the Signet facility as “acceptable.”*

From 20 to 24 November 2006, the FDA inspected Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke facility
in Ontario, Canada.° This site has a solid dose facility and employs specific
technologies, such as wet granulation, flaking, pelletisation and coating.’ The Form

483 issued by the FDA’s inspectors at the conclusion of this inspection noted

several deficiencies, including a failure in a timely manner to file field alert reports
(“FARs”). From Apotex Inc.’s responses, the FDA confirmed that Apotex Inc. had

satisfactorily addressed the FDA’s questions and concerns.®

The 2007 — 2008 Criticism of the FDA’s Foreign Inspection Practices

On 1 November 2007, the US General Accounting Office (“GAO”), an independent
investigative arm of the US Congress,” issued a report entitled “Drug Safety:
Preliminary Findings Suggest Weaknesses in FDA’s Program for Inspecting
Foreign Drug Manufacturers.”!° This 2007 GAO report noted the FDA’s poor data
regarding the number of foreign facilities subject to inspection and the FDA’s small
number of foreign inspections. !! The report also noted the FDA’s difficulties in

. ee : 2
conducting foreign inspections.”

At that time, and continuing until recent
legislative changes, those inspections took place without financial charge to the

foreign facility.

Beginning in 2007, many patients in the USA and elsewhere suffered from the
effects of adulterated heparin (a blood thinner).!° Through its investigations, the
FDA identified a contaminant in the drug’s API sourced from China.'* The
contamination, to which 81 fatalities in the USA were attributed, '° stimulated
concern about the adequacy of the FDA’s inspection of foreign facilities, not limited

to China.'°

In April 2008, the GAO issued a second report entitled “Drug Safety: Preliminary

Findings Suggest Recent FDA Initiatives Have Potential, but Do Not Fully Address

l7

Weaknesses in Its Foreign Drug Inspection Program.” A third report was issued

by the GAO in September 2008 entitled “Drug Safety: Better Data Management and

More Inspections Are Needed to Strengthen FDA’s Foreign Drug Inspection

Program.” 18

The December 2008 Etobicoke Inspection

On 4 April 2008, the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, Office of
Compliance (“CDER”) requested a “priority inspection” of Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke
facility. CDER is a part of the FDA responsible for drug quality, including drugs
produced at foreign facilities. This request was made following a number of
complaints in the USA and a US Congressional inquiry regarding an alleged lack of
efficacy of the Etobicoke-produced drug carbidopa-levodopa (a drug used to treat
Parkinson’s disease).'? In FDA terminology, this was a priority inspection which

was “directed” or “for cause”, given these complaints.”°

Two FDA investigators, Commander Debra M. Emerson (a pharmacist) and Ms.
Rochelle Campbell (a chemist), inspected the Etobicoke facility from 10 to 19
December 2008.7! The investigators were assigned to conduct a cGMP inspection,

as well as a pre-approval inspection (“PAT”) of nine pending ANDAs.”

During the inspection, the two FDA investigators interviewed Apotex Inc.
personnel, reviewed documents, and investigated the Etobicoke facility. At the close
of the inspection on 19 December 2008, the investigators provided the senior
management of Apotex Inc. with 11 written “inspectional observations” in their

Form 483.73 This Form 483’s observations included the following:

a. Apotex Inc. had failed to transfer the methods for testing products between the

different Apotex laboratories;

b. Apotex Inc. had failed to submit timeously to the FDA certain FARs (Field
Alert Reports) regarding problems observed in the manufacture of approved

drugs;**

c. Apotex Inc. had failed to include complete production and process controls in

all approved productions records;

d. Apotex Inc. had failed to include a copy of all approved labels and labelling in

the master batch records; and

e. Apotex Inc. had changed the expiry date on a certain product without

conducting proper stability testing.”°

Commander Emerson testified that, as a result of this investigation, she
recommended “OAT” [Official Action Indicated] “[b]ecause of the seriousness of
the problems we identified .... More specifically, I recommended the recall and an
import alert for the combination product: carbidopa-levodopa, due to the lack of
stability. I also recommended that FDA withhold approval of several ANDAs
[numbers here omitted] because of Apotex’s failure to adequately transfer and
verify testing methods. I further recommended that FDA withhold approval of the
Po because the firm had not investigated or resolved
the failed scale-up batches. Finally, I recommended that FDA re-inspect the facility
to review Apotex’s scale-up and stability testing for two other ANDAs [numbers

here omitted].”7°

January — June 2009

In January 2009, the FDA received further complaints regarding the size and shape
of certain Apotex Inc. drugs. In one complaint, the report related to a round
leflunomide pill (a rheumatoid arthritis drug) in a bottle of triangular-shaped pills;?”

and, in another complaint, a pharmacy technician reported a tablet of tramadol

* In particular, the Form 483 referred to a failure by Apotex Inc. to report a problem with “over-thick” tablets of
the heart medication [EJ The complaint was originally recorded in May 2008 but was not reported to the
FDA until November 2008 (USA Counter-Memorial, Para. 75; Exhibit C-034, Observation 4).

hydrochloride (a synthetic version of codeine used to treat pain) that was “about

twice the thickness” of the other pills in the bottle.”

3.19. In regard to the tramadol complaint, by an email dated 22 January 2009, an FDA
consumer products safety officer (a physician) asked FDA officials to obtain the
bottle containing the oversized tramadol tablet and conduct lab tests.” The officer
wrote that “[w]e are concerned that the oversized Tramadol tablet may lead to

3.20. In regard to the leflunomide complaint, an email dated 16 January 2009 from Dr.
Carmelo Rosa (then Acting Team Leader of CDER’s International Compliance
Branch) to the pharmacy which had discovered the reported defect stated: “[w]e are
very concerned with this situation .... an FDA representative [will] visit your
pharmacy in the next few days and investigate the situation and collect the
necessary samples.” After the FDA informed Apotex Inc. of the complaint,

Apotex Inc. described the reported defect as “‘an extremely isolated incident.”

2009. The response addressed each of FDA’s 11 observations and undertook to

In April 2009, Dr. Rosa became Team Leader of the FDA’s Office of

2011 to June 2011 he was the Branch Chief of International Compliance in this
Office, reviewing Team Leaders’ recommendations for regulatory actions, later
becoming the Division Director of the CDER component responsible for
international drug quality.” Dr. Rosa was a senior figure within the FDA; but he
was not in any sense a political appointment. He testified: “I come from Puerto
Rico, and I have no involvement in policies or political interests of commissioners

“that you can use as a model for drafting the Apotex IA [Import Alert],’"! as had

earlier been discussed between them. This message was copied to Dr. Rosa.

On 1 June 2009, Dr. Rosa sent an internal FDA email attaching a list of products for
shortage assessment on Apotex Inc. drugs in the US market. The subsequent email
in the chain from Mr. Michael Smedley to Captain Valerie Jensen and Mr. Jouhayna
Saliba (all FDA), also dated 1 June 2009, noted that: “[c]ompliance is considering

Dr. Hamburg and the FDA’s Policies

During this period in early June 2009, a new FDA Commissioner appointed by
President Obama’s administration, Dr. Margaret Hamburg, took office. In an early
public speech as Commissioner, delivered on 6 August 2009, Dr. Hamburg
described the FDA’s new regulatory policy with an emphasis on its strategic, rapid

and visible aspects.
Dr Hamburg’s speech included the following passage:**

“_..the pathways for enforcement action can be too long and arduous when the
public’s health is in jeopardy. We are fixing these pathways to improve the
effectiveness of our enforcement system. Today, the FDA is taking several initial

steps in this direction.

First, the FDA will set post-inspection deadlines. When the FDA finds that a firm is
significantly out of compliance, we expect a prompt response to our findings. Once
the FDA provides inspection findings identifying a serious problem, the firm will
generally have no more than fifteen working days in which to respond before the
FDA moves ahead with a warning letter or enforcement action. This will help FDA

issue warning letters on a timely basis and facilitate prompt corrective action.

Second, the FDA will take responsible steps to speed the issuance of warning
letters. I have approved a new policy brought forward by the FDA’s Chief Counsel
to limit warning letter review to significant legal issues. As a result, most
enforcement letters will be able to move forward through a more streamlined
process. This approach is consistent with the FDA’s longstanding historical

practice.

Third, the FDA will seek to work more closely with our regulatory partners to
develop effective risk control and enforcement strategies. In many food safety cases,
for example, local, state, and international officials have more authority to take

action quickly than the FDA. When the public health is at risk, the FDA will reach

4 Apotex Memorial, Para. 150. (The change of US administration took place in January 2009, following the US
Presidential election held in November 2008.)
* Exhibit C-051.

3.29.

3.30.

out to our partners to take rapid action while we alert the public and prepare longer-

term responses.

Fourth, the FDA will prioritize enforcement follow-up. After a warning letter is
issued or a major product recall occurs, we will make it a priority to follow up
promptly with appropriate action, such as an inspection or investigation to assess

whether or not a company has made required changes in its practices.

Fifth, the FDA will be prepared to act swiftly and aggressively to protect the public.
The FDA will no longer issue multiple warning letters to noncompliant firms before
taking enforcement action. If we find that we must move quickly to address
significant health concerns or egregious violations, we will consider immediate

action — even before we have issued a formal warning letter.

These five procedural changes will help to ensure that violations are taken seriously,
that warning letters and enforcement actions occur in a timely manner, and that
steps are taken to protect consumers in cases where immediate enforcement action

is not possible ...”

There is an issue which the Tribunal addresses later, as to whether Dr. Hamburg
introduced a “new” enforcement policy which was being used at that time to target
Apotex Inc. “pour encourager les autres” (as the Claimants contend) or only
returned the FDA to its “historical practice” without any attempt to make Apotex
Inc. a public example (as the Respondent contends).** There were undoubtedly
material changes to the FDA’s policies and practices from mid-2009 onwards. The
issue, however, is whether any of these changes were material to the Claimants’
several claims in this arbitration; and that mixed issue of fact and law is considered

separately later below.

The relevant statistics for the period from 2003 (before Dr. Hamburg’s
appointment) to 2012 (three years after her appointment) show the following as
regards Import Alerts 66-40 “GMP Issues for Human Drugs”, affecting foreign

facilities (including Apotex’s Import Alert in 2009):*°

(*The Tribunal accepts the explanation for part of this increase from 2009 onwards,

heparin crisis, as Dr. Rosa testified.)”

3.31. In addition, the FDA increased its inspections of foreign facilities. During the period
from 2000 to 2007, the FDA conducted an average of 282 foreign inspections
annually. The figures thereafter were much higher: 2008 — 372; 2009 — 491; 2010 —
525; 2011 — 631; and 2012 — 672.

3.32. As regards warning letters, for the period 2002 to 2008, the FDA averaged three
letters annually to foreign facilities for cGMP violations. Thereafter, the figures
were much higher: 2009 — 13; 2010 — 18; and 2011 — 20. (In total, not limited to
foreign facilities, the FDA regularly issued a much greater number of warning

letters; for example, it issued 1,720 warning letters in 201 1.”

The June 2009 Etobicoke Warning Letter

3.33. On 7 June 2009, Ms. Deborah Autor (Director of CDER’s Office of Compliance)
sent a draft warning letter regarding Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke facility to (among
other FDA officers) Dr. Janet Woodcock (Director of CDER).” In her reply email
of 8 June 2009, Dr. Woodcock wrote: “Obviously this firm [Apotex Inc.] should not
be shipping drug [sic] to the US! What are we going to do about it besides WL

[warning letter]? ... Their QC [Quality Control] unit has no idea what is going on
»51

Shortly afterwards, Ms. Autor circulated Dr. Woodcock’s email message to other
FDA officers and asked: “[c]an we do an import alert sooner rather than later?” In
response, Mr. Joseph Famulare (a senior FDA officer) wrote that “[t]he shortage
determination will need to be completed.”** This was a reference to the pending
evaluation within the CDER component responsible for drug shortage issues as to
the effect, in the USA, of an import alert on possible shortages of medically

necessary drugs produced by Apotex Inc.’s facilities at Signet and Etobicoke.

On 18 and 19 June 2009, FDA officers exchanged emails regarding the possibility
of an Apotex Inc. import alert and the attendant possibility of short supply issues.
Following an email from Captain Jensen which identified certain products of
Apotex Inc. with shortage issues, Dr. Rosa wrote on 19 June 2009: “From what I
see below, other companies can ramp up. However, the amount of Apotex product
in the market is significant. Meaning that this decision needs to be carefully

evaluated.”°>

Later that same day, Mr. Rivera-Martinez replied to Dr. Rosa’s email: “Based on
this information, we may want to hold off on the IA [Import Alert] until after our

regulatory meeting with Apotex’s management.”*°

On 25 June 2009, the FDA sent to Apotex Inc. a seven-page warning letter stating
that the FDA’s inspection of the Etobicoke facility in December 2008 had revealed
“significant deviations” from cGMP regulations (the “Etobicoke warning letter”).°”
Whilst acknowledging that Apotex Inc. appeared to have completed certain
corrections, the warning letter stated that Apotex Inc.’s response of 30 January 2009

to the Etobicoke Form 483 observations “fails to adequately address multiple,

serious deficiencies.”** The warning letter provided that the cGMP violations

included, but were not limited to, the following:

a. “Failure to thoroughly investigate the failure of a batch or any of its
components to meet any of its specifications whether or not the batch has

already been distributed”;

b. “Failure to submit NDA**/ANDA field alert reports (FARs) in the required
timeframe, within 3 working days of becoming aware of information
concerning any significant chemical, physical, or other change or deterioration

in the distributed drug product”; and

c. “Failure to include a specimen or copy of each approved label and all other

labeling in the master production and control record.”

The Etobicoke warning letter provided that, until all corrections to cGMP deviations
had been completed by Apotex Inc. and confirmed by the FDA, CDER might
recommend withholding approval of any new applications or supplements listing
Apotex Inc. as a drug product manufacturer.°! It also provided that a failure to
correct these violations might result in the FDA denying entry of products
manufactured by Apotex Inc. at the Etobicoke facility.” (This was an implicit
reference to an import alert.) It further warned that the deficiencies identified in the
warning letter and the earlier Form 483 were not all-inclusive; and that it was

Apotex Inc.’s responsibility to ensure cGMP compliance.

By letter dated 17 July 2009, Apotex Inc. provided a 24-page response to the

Etobicoke warning letter and the cGMP deficiencies there set out. On 12 August

2009, Apotex Inc. requested a meeting with the FDA to address its response to the

Etobicoke warning letter.

The July - August 2009 Signet Inspection

From 27 July to 14 August 2009, four FDA investigators (Mr. Lloyd Payne, Ms.
Kristy Zielny, Mr. Brian Belz and Mr. Brian Lee, a chemist) conducted a 14-day
inspection at Apotex Inc.’s Signet facility. Although the inspection was originally
scheduled to include both a cGMP inspection and PAI inspections for i pending

ANDAs and one new drug application, the PAIs were not concluded.”

About a week before the inspection, the four FDA inspectors had taken part in a
telephone conference-call with a large number of participants from the FDA (about
30 persons), including Mr. Rivera-Martinez. It was a form of general brainstorming
with no mention of an import alert, as Mr. Payne testified at the Hearing. During
the inspection, there was at least one telephone conference-call between certain of
the inspectors and Mr. Rivera-Martinez, during which the possibility of an import

alert was mentioned, as Mr. Payne also testified.”

On 6 August 2009, while the Signet inspection was taking place, the FDA’s
Commissioner, Dr. Hamburg, made the public speech already described above.
Apart from what might be inferred from its text, there is no evidence in this
arbitration to suggest that Dr. Hamburg was directing her speech with Apotex Inc.

specifically in mind.

it still left him in a “sizzle.””! This difficulty became evident at the time to Apotex

Inc.’s senior management, including Dr. Clark, Dr. Desai and Ms. Tao.”

On the final day of the Signet inspection, but before the closeout meeting, Mr.
Lance Lovelock (then Vice President of Quality at Apotex Inc.) submitted two
affidavits to the FDA inspectors, at their request, regarding the use of drugs in the
production of finished products sourced from Mexico and India cs
and | respectively).”° Apotex’s senior officers viewed the FDA’s
inspectors’ insistence upon such affidavits as an unusual procedure, prompted by
the inspectors’ apparent concern that Apotex Inc. was seeking to mislead the FDA
(a suggestion refuted by Apotex Inc. at the time). Dr. Desai testified that that there
was an issue with data integrity regarding a specific product i) raised
by one of the FDA investigators, Ms. Zielny, which Apotex Inc. treated very
seriously (albeit, as he testified, without seeking any legal advice at that time).’° Dr.
Clark testified that Ms. Zielny was “effectively accusing Apotex of misleading the
Agency with respect to the manufacturing processes of this generic drug. We
emphasized that while documentation may have been incomplete with respect to
changes in the manufacturing process, what was provided was accurate. We

categorically rejected any suggestion of any intent to mislead ..
hand, Mr. Payne testified that these affidavits were not an exceptional procedure,
being a ‘best practice’ when collecting a documentary sample of a product.””
Whatever the FDA’s motivation, it made for an unpleasant situation between
Apotex’s senior officers and the FDA’s inspectors prior to and during the

subsequent closeout meeting.

At the closeout meeting, taking place after the end of the Signet facility inspection

on 14 August 2009 (it was a Friday), the FDA investigators provided Apotex Inc.’s

management with 17 written observations in their Form 483.’5 There were also
other concerns raised by the FDA inspectors, each of whom presented observations
which he or she had found. Mr. Payne testified that: “Ms. Zielny presented the most
observations, because she had reviewed the Quality systems, where most of the
cGMP violations were found. As the team leader, I reviewed and approved every
observation and concern presented.” Mr. Payne also testified: “On several occasions
during the presentation, Apotex Inc. management acknowledged the deficiencies.
For example, Apotex Inc.’s President and Chief Operating Officer, Jack Kay,
acknowledged the ‘unacceptable sloppiness’ in the firm’s written procedures for
assuring correct labeling and packaging materials for drug products. Regarding
Apotex Inc.’s failures to follow written procedures for cleaning and maintaining
equipment, the firm’s Vice-President for Quality, Lance Lovelock, acknowledged
‘that there needs to be some self-policing in issuing deviations and that this is an
opportunity to look at the procedures and processes in place’. In relation to the
observed failure to investigate unexplained discrepancies or batch failures, Mr.
Lovelock stated that ‘in-process investigations need to be looked at and closed in a
timelier manner.’ Our EIR [Establishment Inspection Report] recorded many such

: : . «9979
acknowledgments and promises of remedial action.

The FDA Inspectors’ concerns reflected in their Form 483 observations included the

following (here much summarised by the Tribunal):

a. Apotex Inc. had distributed drugs to the US which were produced from

contaminated drug batches;

b. Apotex Inc. had failed to submit timeously FARs to the FDA regarding

problems observed in the manufacture of approved drugs;

c. Apotex Inc. had failed to follow its written procedures for cleaning and
maintaining equipment used in the manufacturing, processing, packing, or

holding of drug products; and

The FDA investigators directed Apotex Inc. to contact CDER the next business day,
ie. the following Monday, 17 August 2009.*!

The Telephone Conference-Call of 17 August 2009

A telephone conference-call between senior representatives of Apotex Inc. and the
FDA took place on Monday, 17 August 2009. During this conference, Apotex Inc.
undertook voluntarily to recall 675 batches of drug products manufactured at the
Etobicoke and Signet facilities and distributed in the US market. Apotex Inc.
prepared its own internal notes of the meeting.** Apotex Inc. there acknowledged
that: “there are significant deficiencies.”* In answer to the specific question from
Mr. Rivera-Martinez (FDA) “whether Apotex intends to continue distributing
products”, these notes record Dr. Desai’s answer: “Apotex does intend to continue
distributing. We believe we can deliver safe and efficacious product.” This
telephone conference-call was also important for what was not said by its

participants.

As regards Apotex Inc., Dr. Desai testified: “... In order to prove to FDA our
commitment to placing only the highest quality products in the US market, Mr.
Lovelock and I decided to voluntary [sic] recall the batches associated with these
black particles [this is a reference to black particles of a. We thought
that if we completely eliminated what appeared to be FDA’s source of concern, the
problem would be solved. We also thought that this kind of action would
demonstrate to FDA that we were taking their observations seriously and that we
were doing our best to cooperate with them. Thus, we told FDA in the call that we
would do a recall. Mr. Friedman [FDA Director, Division of Manufacturing and

Product Quality] asked whether this would be enough and whether Apotex felt that

it should cease distribution in the US. I explained that we believed the recall was
more than sufficient and that we did not need to stop distribution in the US. Mr.
Friedman did not disagree or otherwise indicate a different view.” Significantly,
Apotex Inc. did not undertake to suspend production at its Signet or Etobicoke

facilities; nor would it temporarily cease shipments to the USA.

At this time, the senior management of Apotex Inc., whilst acknowledging
regulatory deficiencies found by the FDA, did not consider that there was any
problem with the quality and safety of their products; they firmly believed that
Apotex products did not pose any imminent risks to public health; that none were in
fact adulterated; and that “Apotex drugs were only ‘deemed adulterated’ under the

Act”, as Dr. Desai testified.*° Mr. Clark testified that, apart from regulatory

requirements: “... there was absolutely no safety concern with our products and no
question as to their quality.”*”
As regards the FDA, Dr. Rosa testified: “‘... We expressed concern with Apotex’s

decision to continue distributing any drugs in the U.S. market from Etobicoke and
Signet, given the firm’s acknowledgment of the serious cGMP deficiencies at those
facilities. Apotex told us that it planned to retain a third-party expert to assist its
remediation efforts. But that was no substitute for actually fixing the serious cGMP
violations before shipping additional drugs to the United States. When faced with
this level of FDA concern, many other companies have halted distribution,
temporarily suspended manufacturing, or slowed production of drug products.
Apotex proposed nothing of the sort ... It became clear during the call that Apotex

failed to grasp the seriousness of the situation.”**

Dr. Rosa was also cross-examined at the Hearing on his account of this important
telephone conference-call and, in particular, his conclusion that Apotex Inc. was not
in control of its two facilities. He testified that: “FDA had evidence that the firm
17-89

was not operating in a state of contro and “It’s about, ‘Do you have the system

under control? Can you identify and find the problems that you have in your

facility?’; We are focused on the evidence ... to operate in a sustainable state of
compliance, ... it’s about the controls and the systems that you have to show that
you're sustainable”;°° “... when you look at the Signet Drive inspection, you can
see that [it was] a facility [that] is not in control”;?! and “Apotex did initiate a recall,
and it was a voluntary recall of batches that were in the market. Again, as I
mentioned, when you look at the recall of Apotex, you look at the inspections at
Apotex, that was certainly out of control in terms of quality.”°”

In re-examination at the Hearing, Dr. Rosa testified: “When we look and talk about
a firm — company being in or not in control, a firm that is capable of identifying the
issues, a firm that is capable of predicting the issues, a firm that is capable of
implementing Corrective Action Plans that can lead them and can lead them to the
point where they can show that they can operate in a sustainable state of control...
When we have a firm that identifies problems, corrects them, and is operating at a
level where their investigations are appropriate, when they make — when they decide
to reject a batch, it’s not rejecting a batch because of trial and error. Let me — if it
passes, I release it; if I reject it — if it fails, PI] reject it. That is not operating in a
state of control. That is guessing and crossing your fingers that you can have a good

test result.”**

Later, Dr. Rosa testified: “Apotex, in the meeting of August 17, we
asked them the question, ‘What do you intend to do?’ And one of the statements in
that discussion was, ‘We plan to continue manufacturing and distributing products.”
That was something that was very concerning to the Agency because it gave a clear
indication that Apotex wanted to satisfy FDA’s application, but not operate in
sustainable compliance with GMPs. Because they continued manufacturing product

for the rest of the world. They continued releasing products 2

  

Dr. Rosa testified at the Hearing that the FDA representatives did not mention to
Apotex Inc. in the conference call on 17 August 2009 that the FDA was actively
considering an import alert in respect of both the Etobicoke and Signet facilities.

Thus, the Import Alert was imposed on 28 August 2009 (11 days later) without the

FDA issuing any prior warning letter to Apotex Inc. relating to the Signet facility
and without giving Apotex Inc. any opportunity to make a considered response to
the FDA’s concerns relating to the Signet facility (in contrast to the earlier

opportunity given to Apotex Inc. in regard to its Etobicoke facility).°>

Mr. Vodra (the expert witness called by the Respondent) testified that, in his
opinion, this telephone conference-call on 17 August 2009 appears to have been a
“turning point” for the FDA: “...The agency had considered adding Apotex to the
Import Alert [Import Alert 66-40] as early as April 2009, but not implemented it.
The Signet inspection had revealed numerous — and as Apotex conceded
‘significant’ — deficiencies in cGMP compliance across all six systems, some of
which were repeat observations and paralleled those made at the Etobicoke site.
Apotex volunteered to recall many products made at both facilities, but failed to
persuade FDA that it had a rational basis for distinguishing between those to recall
and those to leave alone. Moreover, the company told FDA it intended to continue
to distribute products into the U.S. market relying on its current quality system — the
system that the company and FDA agreed was deficient and needed remediation. In
my experience, FDA would have interpreted Apotex’s responses as lacking a real
commitment to drug quality ... In my opinion, had Apotex ... told FDA on August
17, 2009, that it would not export any non-medically necessary products to the U.S.
pending remediation, it is probable that no Import Alert would have been issued

[footnotes omitted].”°°

In his oral testimony at the Hearing, Mr. Vodra testified that there was “a complete
disconnect” between Apotex Inc. and the FDA: “This is something I’ve seen before.
It is not unusual. Companies frequently do not hear FDA clearly until FDA
basically hits them alongside the head with a 2 by 4.”°” He also testified that the
FDA’s regulatory action affecting both the Signet and Etobicoke facilities was

justified because the quality control system was under the same management.”*

The 28 August 2009 Import Alert

On 19 August 2009, Captain Jensen (of the CDER Drug Shortage Program)
confirmed in an internal FDA email that the placement of an Import Alert on the
drugs produced at the Etobicoke and Signet facilities would not create significant,
prolonged shortages in the USA.” The email stated: “[b]ased on responses from the
alternate firms at this time, there are not any significant, prolonged shortages
anticipated as a result of Apotex products on the lists we were provided being

unavailable.”!°°

Three days after the telephone conference-call with Apotex Inc., an internal FDA
memorandum dated 20 August 2009 from CDER to the Division of Import
Operations and Policy (“DIOP”) commented: “[Apotex Inc.] have not committed to
cease US distribution of all drug products manufactured at [the Etobicoke and
Signet sites]. Our office is concerned about the firm’s rationale and decision to only
recall 675 batches and not address all products on the US market.”!°! The FDA
memorandum recorded that the significant cGMP violations discovered at the
Etobicoke and Signet sites “demonstrate a lack of adequate process controls and
raises serious concerns regarding the firm’s quality and production systems.” ! The
memorandum recommended that, as the methods and controls used in manufacture
did not appear to conform to cGMP, all finished pharmaceutical products
manufactured by Apotex Inc. at the Etobicoke and Signet facilities should be
refused admission to the US.'% It recommended that Import Alert 66-40 be

amended to include these products. to4

This recommendation was accepted by the FDA’s DIOP; and, on 28 August 2009,
the FDA amended the existing Import Alert 66-40 to include all finished form drug
products produced by Apotex Inc. at its Etobicoke and Signet facilities.'°° This

Import Alert addressed “detention without physical examination of drugs

[“DWPE”] from firms which have not met drug GMPs.”!% The FDA did not
immediately inform Apotex Inc. of its decision to place its products on Import Alert,
although the information was published on the FDA’s website. Apotex Inc. only
learnt of the Import Alert accidently on 2 September 2009.'°’ There was no legal
obligation under the Act requiring the FDA to notify Apotex Inc. of the Import Alert
(whether in advance or contemporaneously); but its failure to do either in the

circumstances of this case, requires explanation.

As a matter of policy, as Dr. Rosa testified, the FDA does not provide advance
notice of an import alert so as to ensure that companies do not flood the US market
with adulterated drugs before the FDA can alert its district offices; and firms
“typically learn of Import Alerts when they receive notice that a shipment has been
detained without physical examination” at the US border.'® In the present case,
given the Signet facility’s recent inspection and their subsequent telephone
conference-call only three days old, it remains surprising that the FDA did not
notify Apotex Inc.’s senior management immediately after issuing the Import Alert,
at least informally. Given the FDA’s practices hitherto, there was no reason for

Apotex Inc. to suspect that any import alert was imminent.

In a public speech delivered later at a conference in March 2010, Mr. Rivera-
Martinez referred to Apotex Inc. and the Import Alert: “... That import alert was
implemented 10 days after the completion of an inspection. We’ve never done that
before. Generally, we place companies on an import alert after a warning letter. This
inspection was completed on Friday. On Monday the FDA Office of Compliance
International Alert Branch was on the phone with the executive officer and asked
them what they intended to do with respect to the violations. They didn’t take us too
seriously .... Things are changing folks, and you need to react a lot faster because

FDA is moving a lot faster.” 1

It is important to record that, whilst Apotex’s drug products were considered

“adulterated” within the legislative meaning of the Act under US law for the

purpose of the Import Alert, the Tribunal received no firm evidence that any such
drug caused any actual harm to any patient in the USA or that the FDA ever
expressed to Apotex Inc. that its products constituted an actual health hazard to

patients in the USA.

For Apotex Inc., Mr. Carey testified that, apart from the Import Alert, the FDA did
not take any contemporaneous action that would show that the FDA had concerns
over the safety of Apotex’s products; and, to the contrary, that the FDA classified
Apotex’s recall of the 675 batches as a “Class II’ recall only (thereby
acknowledging that the probability of serious adverse consequences was “remote’’);
that the FDA did not request Apotex Inc. to recall all of its products from the US
market; and that the FDA did not issue any public advisories concerning alleged
safety issues regarding Apotex Inc.’s products.'!° For the Respondent, Dr. Rosa
testified at the Hearing: “... I cannot say that Apotex’s products were not safe and
were not effective or were safe or effective. I’m focusing on Apotex’s GMP
violations that made the drug adulterated.”''! The Tribunal understands that Dr.
Rosa’s use of the term “adulterated” here referred (as elsewhere) to its legal

definition under the Act and not to its more colloquial meaning.

On the same day, by letter dated 28 August 2009, Apotex Inc. informed CDER of
its intention to develop a “continuous improvement action plan” to address the
FDA’s concerns regarding cGMP compliance at the Etobicoke and Signet
facilities.'? The letter reiterated Apotex Inc.’s earlier commitment voluntarily to
recall certain drug batches from US distribution and confirmed its engagement of a
third party cGMP consultant to evaluate Apotex Inc.’s quality systems and ensure
its cGMP compliance. !'° This letter also notified the FDA that Apotex Inc. had
retained an outside consultant (Jeff Yuen & Associates) “to augment existing

quality systems” at its two facilities.

On 30 August 2009, two days after the Import Alert was issued (albeit still unknown

to Apotex Inc.), two shipments of products originating from the Etobicoke and

Signet facilities arrived at the Canada-USA border. Both shipments were held by the
US border authorities pending the FDA’s review and then detained without physical

September 2009, seven shipments from the Etobicoke and Signet facilities had been
put on hold,''® with several notifications sent to Apotex Inc. (as the importer of

record), Apotex US (as the consignee), and Apotex Inc.’s customs broker.''®

Following up on its earlier commitment, on 2 September 2009 Apotex Inc. issued a
“Voluntary Drug Recall” of 659 drug batches from the US market.''7 On 3
September 2009, Apotex Inc. provided a 42-page response to the Form 483

observations regarding the FDA’s Signet inspection, after the Import Alert.!'$

The Telephone Conference-Call of 3 September 2009

On 3 September 2009, Apotex Inc. and FDA representatives held a telephone
conference-call to discuss the Import Alert and the corrective action required of
Apotex Inc.'” Apotex Inc. contemporaneously prepared internal notes of this
telephone call: these record that the FDA “explained that the FDA would like details
regarding Apotex’s global corrective actions to ensure GMP compliance at all of its
locations and that the current voluntary recall plan by Apotex does not meet with
the FDA’s expectations given the significance of the documented GMP

violations.”!”°

Dr. Desai testified that the FDA informed him during this conference-call that
Apotex Inc. had “an opportunity for a hearing on [the] detention and that re-
inspection of our facilities had to take place before the Import Alert could be lifted.
FDA also stated that they wanted to see a global corrective action plan for all

adopted.”!?! (Apotex Inc. did not initiate, then or later, an application for a hearing

on the detention of its drug shipments at the US-Canadian border.)

New Zealand, Australia and the European Union

In early September 2009, the New Zealand drugs regulator, Medsafe, indicated that
it was “leaning toward” banning imports into New Zealand of drugs produced at the

122

Etobicoke and Signet facilities. ~“ Apotex NZ Limited subsequently signed a

voluntary (and temporary) import restriction to the effect that it would not import

into New Zealand drugs manufactured at the two facilities. 123

Import suspensions or
bans were also requested or imposed by health regulators in Australia and the
European Union, pending Health Canada’s inspection of the Signet and Etobicoke

eo eyigs 124
facilities.

The September 2009 Meetings

On 11 September 2009, the planned meeting between Apotex Inc. and FDA
representatives took place at the FDA’s headquarters in Washington DC, uSA."5
The meeting was attended by Apotex Inc.’s senior management with its consultants
and legal advisers, including Mr. Kay, Dr. Desai, Mr. Lovelock and Dr. Clark; and
the FDA’s representatives included Mr. Friedman, Mr. Rivera-Martinez, Dr. Rosa
and two of the recent Signet inspectors on the telephone (Mr. Belz and Ms. Zielny).

Both Apotex Inc. and the FDA gave slide presentations at this meeting.

The FDA’s presentation noted that “[s]imilar significant CGMP deficiencies” had
been found at both the Signet and Etobicoke facilities, stating the following under

the heading “FDA’s Current Concerns”:

a. “Deficiencies found at both Etobicoke and Signet Campus facilities

include...[c]orporate culture of reprocessing and retesting products into

  

specification...[p]oor, inadequate, or incomplete OOS [out-of-specification]

b. “Failure to have an appropriate global quality culture and
system...[d]eficiencies were found in all six systems for the manufacture of
drugs/drug products...[IJack of root cause determinations and effective
corrective actions to ensure reliable and reproducible manufacturing processes

are in place.” 126

Apotex Inc.’s presentation set out the immediate actions which had been taken at
the Etobicoke and Signet facilities. The presentation also outlined Apotex Inc.’s
several improvement plans and commitments, including an undertaking that
independent consultants would conduct a product quality assessment (“PQA”) on all
its products currently on the US market, or in the Etobicoke and Signet warehouses,
in order to verify that Apotex Inc. products met appropriate standards and
specifications at release until expiry. |?” Apotex Inc. also voluntarily agreed to
suspend distribution of Etobicoke and Signet products from Apotex-US’s

warehouse in Indianapolis, USA, until the completion of the pQa.!8

Apotex Inc. requested that, based on a satisfactory completion of the product quality
assessments and verification audits, FDA should promptly lift the Import Alert for
the Etobicoke and Signet facilities following FDA re-inspection or sign-off by
independent consultants. 29 Apotex Inc. further requested prompt PAIs for its

pending ANDAs. 150

The FDA informed Apotex Inc. that it would only recommend lifting the Import

Alert after its own re-inspection of the two faciliti s;'3! and the FDA’s readiness for

 

re-inspection would be contingent on assurances of sustainable cGMP conformance

and the evaluation and resolution of deficiencies throughout all quality systems. '*?

3.75. On 17 September 2009, Apotex Inc. and the FDA held a telephone conference-call
regarding the supply to the US market of two drugs (deferiprone and a)
for emergency or IND (investigational new drugs) treatment, so as to avoid a
shortage of these drugs.'™ During the telephone call, Apotex Inc. agreed to FDA’s
conditions that each batch shipped to the US would be subject to PQA (Product
Quality Assessment) by an independent third party, and that each batch would be
subject to retesting. 85 On 24 September 2009, subject to Apotex Inc.’s agreement to
these conditions, the FDA allowed Apotex Inc. to ship a small quantity of
deferiprone to the US to treat 47 gravely ill patients under the “Compassionate Use
Program.” 186

3.76. Following the Import Alert, as indicated to the FDA, Apotex Inc. retained an
independent cGMP expert (Lachman Consultant Services, Inc.) to conduct the
PQA.'3” On 24 September 2009, Lachman Consultant Services, Inc. submitted a
PQA protocol for products in Apotex US’s Indianapolis warehouse. '** Apotex Inc.
also pursued a corrective action plan and a global quality systems enhancement

program.” The Q6 Program, otherwise entitled “Apotex Global Quality Systems

Health Canada’s Inspections October — November 2009

Following a multi-week inspection of Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke and Signet facilities,
Health Canada issued “Inspection Exit Notices” for Signet on 14 October 2009 and
for Etobicoke on 4 November 2009.'? Although these notices gave the two

facilities a “C” rating (i.e. “recommended for the continuation or issuance of the

99143

Establishment Licence’ ), the Signet notice listed 26 observations, including 18

“Risk 2” observations (i.e. “major” observations '*

145

) and eight “Risk 3” observations
(i.e. “other” observations); and the Etobicoke notice listed 26 observations,
including 19 “Risk 2” observations and seven “Risk 3” observations. Both notices
provided that, in respect of four Signet observations and three Etobicoke
observations, similar observations and issues had been made and reported during

past inspections of Apotex Inc. by Health Canada. 46

Health Canada subsequently carried out numerous follow-up inspections of the two

facilities. '“”

January - March 2010

On 27 January 2010, Apotex Inc. and the FDA held a telephone conference which
addressed issues with several of the firm’s recent FARs. During the meeting, FDA
noted that “[i]t appears that serious issues have not been resolved yet (FARs issued
in December 2008, July and August 2009) as new concerns are still ongoing

(recently filed FARs).”'“*

On 17 March 2010, the various independent experts retained by Apotex Inc.
submitted their respective reports, including Lachman Consultant Services, Inc.’s
PQA, and the independent review of Apotex Inc.’s quality structures and processes
by Jeff Yuen & Associates (a GMP compliance consultancy firm).'° The latter

report’s executive summary stated: “Recent quality systems assessments confirmed

that system level improvements were needed for all six systems. The [Jeff Yuen &
Associates] quality system assessment was consistent with recent FDA inspectional
observations and the recent warning letter citations with respect to three systems in
particular: Quality Systems, Laboratory Systems, and Production/Packaging &

The March 2010 Signet Warning Letter

On 29 March 2010, the FDA sent to Apotex Inc. a warning letter with respect to the

Signet facility (the “Signet warning letter”). °°

The Signet warning letter provided
that FDA investigators had identified “significant violations” of cGMP regulations
during their inspection of the Signet facility in July-August 2009.'** The letter
stated that it was being issued because of “serious and repeat violations from the
2008 and 2009 inspections” of the Etobicoke and Signet facilities, and because
Apotex Inc.’s response to the Signet Form 483 (of 3 September 2009) was
“inadequate and lacks sufficient corrective actions.”!*> The letter highlighted
several cGMP violations observed during the 2009 inspection at Signet, including
contamination, a failure thoroughly to investigate batch failures or unexplained
batch discrepancies, and a failure to implement adequate equipment cleaning and

156

maintenance procedures/programs to prevent contamination. ~” The letter also cited

Apotex Inc. for its violations of the requirements for FARs. 187

The Signet warning letter provided that, until all corrections had been completed by

Apotex Inc. and confirmed by the FDA, the FDA would continue to deny entry of

products manufactured at the Signet facility and that CDER would recommend
withholding approval of any new applications or supplements listing Apotex Inc. as

a drug product manufacturer. 158

On 31 March 2010, senior representatives of Apotex Inc. and the FDA met to
discuss the Etobicoke and Signet facilities.’ This meeting had been requested by

Apotex Inc. in February 2010.'°

At this meeting, both Apotex Inc. and the FDA made presentations. In opening the
Apotex Inc. presentation, Mr. Kay (then Apotex Inc.’s President and Chief
Operating Officer) stated that Apotex Inc. “gets” the FDA’s concerns.'*! Dr. Desai
(then Executive Vice President Global Research and Development and Quality of
Apotex Inc.) acknowledged that “Apotex needs to look at their Quality System.
Apotex has hired 250 FTEs [full time equivalents] to address their quality
issues...”'% Apotex Inc.’s presentation included preliminary comments on the
Signet warning letter, adding that Apotex would respond formally within 15 days. 163
Apotex Inc. then reported on its corrective actions and its product quality

assessment. '*

The FDA observed that “[w]e are not confident that all sites have a clear
understanding of FDA _ requirements, including CGMPs.”'® The FDA’s
presentation noted that readiness for re-inspection and the removal of the Import
Alert would be contingent on both the assurance of sustainable cGMP conformance
and the evaluation and resolution of potential data integrity issues.'° The FDA
noted that “[t]hese pervasive issues can only be remedied through systemic and

transformational changes at your firm.” 7

At the end of the meeting, Apotex Inc. stated that it was confident that “Apotex is
on the right track, even though the touchdown hasn’t been scored yet”! There is

no record that the FDA’s representatives agreed with this statement.

Apotex Inc. submitted its full written response to the Signet warning letter on 17
April 2010.'® It had earlier suggested a follow-up by telephone conference-call

with “Carmelo [Rosa] and his team” by email message dated 1 April 2010.'7

On 14 June 2010, Apotex Inc. and FDA representatives (including Dr. Rosa) held a
telephone conference-call which addressed multiple recent FARs received from
Apotex Inc. regarding product contamination at its third facility in Richmond Hill,
Ontario. The FDA’s minutes of this meeting recorded the following under the
heading “Background”: “[t]he FARs are still under evaluation by Apotex, but the
firm continues to release these products without initiating a product recall, which is
concerning to [FDA Division of Manufacturing and Product Quality’s] International

Compliance Branch.”!7!

On 14 June 2010, Dr. Rosa sent an internal FDA email summarising the FDA’s
history of inspections of Apotex Inc. with an update regarding its Richmond Hill
facility.'”? Dr. Rosa wrote that: “Apotex’s response of July 17, 2009, to the
Etobicoke WL [warning letter], along with the additional corrective actions
implemented throughout 2009 and 2010 ... appear to adequately address our
concerns and will be verified during the next FDA GMP inspection ... The firm’s
response of April 17, 2010 [to the Signet warning letter], including the decision to
recall affected products, appears to adequately address our concerns...[a] follow up

inspection is needed to verify the corrective and preventative actions.” !7

On 25 June 2010, Apotex Inc. sought the FDA’s approval to export certain
“shortage” drug products from the Etobicoke facility to the USA prior to the FDA’s

would occur under the supervision of a third party consultant who would certify the
facility’s compliance with cGMP, pending re-inspection by the FDA.'”> The FDA
rejected this request, except for deferiprone which the FDA had previously
authorised Apotex Inc. to export under direct oversight of a third party

consultant.'7°

Apotex Inc. Requests Re-Inspections: August — December 2010

On 27 August 2010, Apotex Inc. requested the FDA to re-inspect its Etobicoke
facility in early October 2010.'7’ The request noted, among other matters, that Jeff
Yuen & Associates, Inc. had informed Apotex Inc. in June 2010 that it was prepared
to certify that the Etobicoke facility and the methods and controls used to
manufacture, process, package, label, hold, and distribute drugs were in compliance

with cGMP.'78

Within the FDA, Dr. Rosa requested a “priority inspection” of the Etobicoke facility

on 22 September 2010, identifying the priority as “High.”!”

On 29 September 2010, Apotex Inc. requested the FDA to re-inspect its Signet
facility.'*° As with the Etobicoke facility, within the FDA, Dr. Rosa requested a
“priority inspection” of that facility on 14 October 2010, again identifying the
priority as “High.” '8!

On 21 October 2010, the FDA notified Apotex Inc. that the FDA was planning to
conduct GMP inspections at the Etobicoke and Signet sites “sometimes between

November 29 — December 17, 2010.18? However, on 22 November 2010, the FDA

postponed the re-inspections until 24 January — 24 February 2011.'%? The notice
from the FDA to Apotex Inc. stated: “This inspection will be postponed until 1/24 —
2/24/11 to be able to get an inspectional team of investigators and chemist together,
review the | plus pending applications as well as evaluate corrections made by the
firm to correct both Warning Letters.” Apotex Inc. understood that the
inspections were delayed by the FDA because a larger team was necessary to

complete both a GMP inspection and a PAI inspection. 185

Apotex Inc. requested the FDA to expedite the re-inspections on numerous

occasions, but without success until January 201 1,186

FDA Re-inspections: January - February 2011

The same team of

and the Etobicoke facility between 3 and 11 February 2011.
four FDA investigators conducted the re-inspection at both sites: Mr. Michael Goga,

Mr. Francis Guidry, Mr. Steven Weinman and Ms. Sarah McMullen. 188

Mr. Goga testified, as regards the GMP re-inspections, that: “Apotex had not
remedied several of the cGMP violations that led to the firm’s addition to the import
alert list”, in addition to new violations at both sites.'®? As regards the PAI
inspections, Mr. Goga also testified that: “Due to the vast number of cGMP issues
that were observed and the time it took to investigate them, we were not able to

complete all of the PAIs 27190

At the conclusion of the re-inspections, at the closeout meeting, the FDA’s
inspectors provided Apotex Inc. with their Form 483 for the Signet facility and their
Form 483 for the Etobicoke facility.'°' The Etobicoke Form 483 listed five

At this meeting, as Mr. Goga testified, Dr. Desai
acknowledged that Apotex Inc. was not satisfying the FDA’s expectations, adding:
“Dr. Desai did tell us that he thought the inspection was fair and balanced. The
Health Canada compliance officers who were present for the inspections told us that

they agreed with our assessment that Apotex was not ready for re-inspection.”!°

The FDA’s Establishment Inspection Reports (“EIRs”) for both re-inspections
recommended the continuation of the Import Alert and the non-approval of pending
applications for continuing GMP deviations.'°* The Etobicoke EIR provided that:
“Tthe] [c]urrent inspection uncovered significant systematic and on-going
objectionable conditions. Corrective action has not been fully implemented to every
objectionable condition cited during the December 2008 inspection.” '°° With
respect to the Signet re-inspection, the EIR provided that: “[t]he inspection
identified twenty-two new or on-going deficiencies that were cited on an FDA 483
26 The Signet EIR also recorded that Dr. Desai (of Apotex Inc.) had commented

that “the inspection was fair and balanced.”!”

Following these two re-inspections, Apotex Inc. prepared a “US Re-Entry Product
Assessment Protocol” on 24 February 201 1.!°8 The protocol was designed to assess
all commercial ANDA products in order to assure product robustness, quality and
regulatory compliance. 199 Rach product was to be reintroduced into the US market

only after meeting the protocol’s requirements.”°°

On 1 March 2011, Apotex Inc. submitted to the FDA its written response to the two

Forms 483.77! Apotex Inc. there outlined the overhaul of its quality systems and

Apotex Inc. also requested approval from the FDA to release new products from
Etobicoke and Signet upon regulatory approval (with third party oversight for the

Signet facility).?°

Lifting of the Import Alert: May - July 2011

After reviewing the FDA’s EIR for the Etobicoke inspection and Apotex Inc.’s
responses to the Forms 483, the FDA informed Apotex Inc. on 6 May 2011 that it

would classify the Etobicoke facility as “acceptable.”?™

An internal FDA memorandum dated 9 May 2011 from CDER to DIOP
recommended that the Etobicoke facility be removed from Import Alert 66-40,75
The memorandum provided: “The firm appears to be manufacturing in compliance
with cGMPs and therefore, should be allowed to import their products into the
United States or any of its territories.” The recommendation was accepted within
the FDA; and the Import Alert lifted with respect to the Etobicoke facility on 15

June 2011.7’ The Import Alert remained as regards the Signet facility.

From 16 May to 11 June 2011, Health Canada conducted GMP re-inspections of the
Etobicoke and Signet facilities.°°* An internal Health Canada memorandum
provided that the inspection findings would result in a “Compliant” rating under
Canadian standards.”” It also observed that: “[iJn general, the inspection team felt
that Apotex has demonstrated significant improvement in its quality systems when

compared with 2009/2010.”

The FDA requested additional information from Apotex Inc. on 20 May 2011
concerning four of the 22 observations in the Signet Form 483 issued on 11

February 201 12 Apotex Inc. responded to the FDA’s request on 10 June 2011.77

After reviewing the Signet EIR and Apotex Inc.’s responses dated 1 March and 10
June 2011, the FDA informed Apotex Inc. on 1 July 2011 that it was classifying
Apotex Inc.’s Signet facility as “acceptable.”?"3 In addition to the Signet EIR and
Apotex Inc.’s responses, the FDA had also reviewed the findings made by Health
Canada in its cGMP inspection of the Signet facility conducted in May and June
2011714

On the same day, CDER recommended to DIOP that the Signet facility be removed
from the Import Alert. The recommendation was subsequently accepted by
DIOP; and the Signet facility was removed from the Import Alert on 29 July
2011.71°

Etobicoke PAI: May - November 2011

On 9 May 2011 (three days after FDA informed Apotex Inc. of Etobicoke’s
“acceptable” classification), Apotex Inc. requested approval of its seven pending
applications for new drugs produced at Etobicoke.”!’ The FDA, however, informed
Apotex Inc. on 29 June 2011 that “the limited pre-approval coverage [during the

On 23 August 2011, the FDA issued a notice stating that FDA would conduct a pre-
approval inspection of Apotex Inc.’s ANDAs at the Etobicoke facility on 18 to 30

September 201 1.220

FDA conducted the pre-approval inspection at Etobicoke from 19 to 28 September
2011.7! At the conclusion of the inspection, the FDA provided Apotex Inc. with a

two-item Form 483.°”

By letter dated 12 October 2011, Apotex responded to the FDA inspectors’

observations in their Form 483.7%

The letter (signed by Apotex Inc.’s Chief
Operating Officer) began: “Firstly, I would like to recognize the efforts of the FDA
Inspection Team and thank them. The inspection was thorough and was well led, by
CSO Marie Fadden, CSO Kevin Foley and Chemist Sneha Patel. Throughout the
course of the inspection, the investigators were found to be cordial, competent and
professional. The Inspection Team made every effort to ensure that we were
informed as to their requirements and they made all reasonable efforts to engage
Apotex staff during the inspection. I very much appreciated the effort expended and
the forthright approach that the investigators took in dealing with observations that
they made. Our goal is to always meet, or exceed where possible, the requirements
of all laws and regulations administered by the FDA as well as those of all other
regulatory bodies that oversee the international markets we serve. We do not believe
that there is anything trivial in the observations provided and we accept them as part

p oe p . : 9922:
of our ongoing journey of continuous improvement ...”?”*

On 30 October 2011, the FDA informed Apotex Inc. that “[w]Je will be entering an
approval recommendation for the applications specifically covered during the

inspection, by NLT [not later than] Monday (if not done already).”?

On 25 November 2011, the FDA approved the first pending ANDA at Etobicoke,
followed by further approvals on 7 and 30 December 2011 and 3 February 2012.76

(Two Etobicoke ANDAs were not yet approved by the FDA).”””

Conclusion

In conclusion, the period from the FDA’s warning letter regarding the Etobicoke
facility in June 2009 to the lifting of the Import Alert in June-July 2011 for both the
Etobicoke and Signet facilities was 24/25 months, with 23 of these months spent
under the Import Alert. The FDA took a “global” or “corporate” approach to Apotex

Inc. and its Etobicoke and Signet Facilities.

For the Claimants, Apotex Inc. did not materially challenge the FDA decisions to
treat deficiencies found at its two facilities as violations of cGMP, rendering their
products “adulterated’ under the Act, neither during the telephone conference-call of
17 August 2009 nor thereafter. In this arbitration, Apotex Inc. claims only in regard
to the FDA’s Import Alert and not the Form 483s or the warning letters. For present
purposes, the losses sustained by Apotex Inc. resulting from the Import Alert can be
assumed to be very considerable, as also its remedial expenses incurred at both
facilities. (These losses are the subject of the claims advanced by Apotex Inc.
against the Respondent in this arbitration, with quantum much in issue and, as

already indicated, bifurcated.)

For the Respondent, Dr. Rosa testified at the Hearing that during this period the
FDA’s resources spent on Apotex Inc. were “countless”, adding: “This is one of the
cases where we spent most of — most time reviewing, and I’ve been involved in
injunctions, consent decrees, and prosecutions. This one certainly is one of the top
ones in terms of resources consumed for evaluating.” Dr. Rosa also testified: “...
The extraordinary time and effort devoted to Apotex Inc. during this time
represented a tremendous drain on Agency resources, and far exceeded the time we
spent on nearly every other drug manufacturing facility during that period.

Hundreds of inspections of other firms were still pending, yet Apotex Inc. continued

to demand that FDA inspect and re-inspect its facilities until it came into
compliance. In fact, Apotex was reinspected sooner than other firms with cGMP
violations, and, as we learned during those reinspections, the firm was not ready for
the reinspections.”?”° As already noted, the FDA’s resources were expended without
financial charge to Apotex Inc. and do not form the basis of any claim by the

Respondent against Apotex Inc. in this arbitration.

The Teva Chronology

The Tribunal has compiled the following factual chronology principally from: (i)
the list of evidentiary references to contemporary documentation which was
supplied by the Parties to the Tribunal in regard to Teva (including those in
response to Question B2 in the Tribunal’s email message of 23 November 2013);
and (ii) other documentary exhibits and testimony cited by the Parties in their
written and oral pleadings in this arbitration. The Tribunal heard no witness from
Teva in this arbitration; and, accordingly it is necessary to cite at some length

contemporary materials relating to Teva that is relevant to this chronology.

The Teva group of companies are engaged in the development, production, and
marketing of generic pharmaceuticals (as well as proprietary branded
pharmaceuticals and active pharmaceutical ingredients) and operate 56
manufacturing facilities around the world, with a total revenue in 2010 of US
$16.21 billion.” Teva is the world’s leading generic pharmaceutical company and
the leading provider of generics to the US market. For the USA, Teva has over 600
ANDAs.”*! (For ease of reference below, the Tribunal does not distinguish between

these different legal entities, referring to them all as “Teva”.)

Teva operated a facility at Irvine, California and also a facility in Jerusalem, Israel.
As regards the Irvine facility, the FDA conducted an inspection in 2009, finding

numerous cGMP violations. As regards the Jerusalem facility, the FDA conducted

three inspections in 2006, 2008 and 2010 “with 483s issued.”**? These inspections

and their consequences are described below.

Although Teva has a facility within the USA making it subject to other sanctions,
Teva’s manufacture in Jerusalem of drugs for export to the US market makes those

drugs subject to the Act and eligible for Import Alert 66-40.

2009

11 December 2009: The FDA issued a warning letter to Teva Parenteral Medicines,
Inc.”*? This letter referred to FDA’s inspection on 13-24 July 2009 of Teva’s Irvine,

California facility.

The Irvine warning letter stated: “The inspection identified significant violations of
the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) Regulations for Finished
Pharmaceuticals ... These violations cause your drug products to be adulterated
within the meaning of Section of 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug, and
Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. 351(a)(2)(B)] in that the methods used in, or the
facility or controls used for, their manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding do
not conform to or are operated or administered in conformity with, CGMP. We have
received your firm’s responses of August 10, September 4 and 8, October 27 and
29, and November 13, 2009, and note these Responses lack sufficient corrective
actions. Specific violations observed during the inspection include, but are not

limited to: [here follow 13 numbered violations].””**

Following the formal warning, the Irvine warning letter concluded: “Within fifteen
working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the
specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of
each step taken to prevent the recurrence of violations and copies of supporting
documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen working
days, state the reason for the delay and the date by which you will have completed

the correction. Additionally, your response should state if you no longer

manufacture Propofol Sterile Emulsion for Injection, and provide the date(s) and

reason(s) you ceased production.”?*°

2010

22 February 2010: Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited filed its Annual Report

(SEC Form 20-F) with the US Securities and Exchange Commission.”*°

Under “Risk Factors”, the following risk was described: “Recently there has been
increasing regulatory scrutiny of pharmaceutical manufacturers. We must register
our facilities, whether located in the U.S. or elsewhere, with the FDA and similar
regulators and our products must be made in a manner consistent with current good
manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), or similar standards in each territory in which
we manufacture. In addition, the FDA and other agencies periodically inspect our
manufacturing facilities. Following an inspection, an agency may issue a notice
listing conditions that are believed to violate cGMP or other regulations, or a
warning letter for violations of ‘regulatory significance’ that may result in
enforcement action if not promptly and adequately corrected. Compliance with
production and quality control regulations requires substantial expenditure of
resources. If any regulatory body were to require one of our manufacturing facilities
to cease or limit production, our business could be adversely affected. In addition,
because regulatory approval to manufacture a drug is site-specific, the delay and
cost of obtaining approval to manufacture at a different facility also could have a
material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of

. 9237
operations.

16 April 2010: Teva voluntarily suspended manufacturing operations at the Irvine

facility.°°* Teva also recalled a number of drugs due to impurities.°*”

28 October 2010: FDA officials met with Teva executives regarding the Irvine

facility. According to the FDA’s minutes of that meeting: “Mr. Gall [Teva Vice-

President of Operations at the Irvine facility] provided an example of the new
maintenance plan on water systems. Ms. Sakers [Teva Executive Vice-President,
Corporate Quality] informed FDA of changes in the QA reporting structure as well
as QA’s new involvement in all levels of the drug manufacturing including on the
floor. She assured FDA that QA will be involved in all deviation investigations and
QA will review and document any changes to the system. Mr. Friedman [FDA
Director, Division of Manufacturing and Product Quality], once again, stressed the
importance of thinking globally and applying corrective actions to all facilities and

not just to the Irvine site.”

Later in the meeting: “Mr. Cruse [FDA Los Angeles District Director] recognized
Teva’s summary of their corrective actions and applaud[ed] Teva’s attempt to put
the right systems in place to ensure compliance. He cautioned that no matter how
big the system is or how great the innovation is, implementation, training, and
accountability will produce success. He also cautioned Teva for putting too much
onus on the consultant and stressed the importance of Teva’s leadership to sustain
the momentum of compliance when the consultant is no longer there. Mr. Cruse
mentioned that although the findings from the Irvine facility ultimately resulted in
this meeting, the correction actions provided during this meeting should be global
and Teva should take a proactive approach in ensuring all facilities are in
compliance. Mr. Cruse acknowledged that the shut down of the Irvine facility is the
type of corporate reaction FDA is looking for when the firm is not in substantial
compliance and asked if Teva plans to take the same strategy for other facilities

when they are found to be non-compliant.”

The Tribunal notes that, at this meeting of 28 October 2010, the FDA welcomed
Teva’s voluntary ‘shut-down’ of the Irvine facility in response to the FDA’s
warning letter and called for Teva to take a “global” and “proactive” approach. This

meeting was attended by (inter alios) Dr. Rosa.

At this same meeting on 28 October 2010, Teva presented a slide presentation to the
FDA listing as a voluntary action (inter alia) Teva’s “moratorium” on production

and release at the Irvine facility." The FDA likewise presented a slide presentation

to Teva. The shut-down of the Irvine facility effected in April 2010 was to continue

until April 2011, a period of 12 months.

24 November 2010: An FDA Enforcement Report described Teva’s nationwide

“ongoing” recall (by letter dated 22 September 2010) of tamoxifen citrate tablets,”

2011

31 January 2011: The FDA issued a warning letter to Teva Pharmaceutical

Industries Ltd regarding cGMP non-compliance at its facility in Jerusalem.”

This Jerusalem warning letter stated: “During our September 12-16, 2010 inspection
of your pharmaceutical manufacturing facility, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries,
Ltd., located at 24 Professor Hartum Street, Har Hozvim, Jerusalem, Israel,
investigators from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) identified significant
violations of Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP) regulations for
Finished Pharmaceuticals .... These violations cause your drug products to be
adulterated within the meaning of section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act .... in that the methods used in, or the facilities or controls used
for, their manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do not conform to, or are not
operated or administered in conformity with, CGMP. We have reviewed your firm’s
response of October 7, 2010, and note that it lacks sufficient corrective actions.
Specific violations observed during the inspection include, but are not limited, to the
following: [here follows two numbered violations].” After the formal warning, the
letter concluded: “Within fifteen working days of receipt of this letter, please notify
this office in writing of the specific steps that you have taken to correct violations.
Include an explanation of each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of
violations and copies of supporting documentation. If you cannot complete
corrective action within fifteen working days, state the reason for the delay and the

date by which you will have completed the correction ...”

Dr. Rosa testified that, in response to the Jerusalem warning letter, Teva volunteered
to cease production until its resolution of the cGMP violations and that it committed

to correct them swiftly. He also described later actions by Teva and the FDA:

“Because the [Jerusalem] facility makes numerous medically necessary drugs, FDA
requested that Teva Pharmaceuticals continue producing those drugs, while
simultaneously implementing proposed corrective actions. FDA determined that the
medical necessity of Teva Pharmaceutical’s drugs and the quality of Teva
Pharmaceutical’s retrospective evaluation and ongoing corrective action weighed

against adding the firm to the Import Alert.”24

23 February 2011: Teva announced a recall of several products manufactured at its
245

Jerusalem facility on or about 23 February 2011.”
On 23 February 2011, an FDA internal email chain addressed an internal request to
assess the possibility of drug shortages following a possible suspension of
production at Teva’s Jerusalem facility.°4° It revealed serious concerns within the
FDA about shortages and impacts on patients in the USA resulting from such a
suspension; and it foreshadowed an urgent telephone conference-call between the

FDA and Teva.

At the Hearing, Dr. Rosa testified about his telephone conversation with Teva’s
corporate quality officer (Ms. Fran Zipp) in which Ms. Zipp indicated to him that
“... their intentions were to stop production, to stop distribution of drugs. That’s
why you will see a chain of e-mails going back and forth because the Agency was
extremely concerned with that possibility.”74” He added later: “... she was definitely
very concerned with the inspectional findings and was speaking about that Teva
[sic] will be taking all and any necessary action to remove product from the market
that could be affected, and they were ready to cease and stop. She actually ordered —
her statement was she ordered that that [Jerusalem] facility stop producing, stop the
distribution ... And that certainly was a concern because of the medical [sic]
necessary drugs that they manufactured or drugs that ... are in shortage and
produced at that facility.” The precise date of this conversation is not known: it

was clearly after the Jerusalem warning letter; and Dr. Rosa thought it was close to

the issuance of that warning letter, but probably before the email messages

summarised below.*””

24 February 2011: In an FDA internal email,?~’ Captain Jensen, a senior FDA
official dealing with drug shortage issues, stated: “Firm [Teva] has made the
decision to recall 30 lots involving 21 different drug products made at the Jerusalem
facility. There is a real concern about patient impact - these are chronic medications
that patients won’t have when they go to get their medications from the pharmacy
(including common blood pressure drugs, cholesterol lowering drugs, diabetes
drugs, arthritis drugs, antidepressants and other widely used medications). We see
the need for a teleconference with Teva as soon as possible to let them know the
medical need for these and to work with them to keep manufacturing medically
necessary drugs at the supply levels needed to meet patient needs while fixing their
problems (as long as benefit outweighs any potential risks). We don’t see any
products on the list that would not be impacting patients and we are worried about
the impact of any supply disruption at the Jerusalem facility. Teva has a very large
market share for these products and acquired additional market share when CGMP
issues occurred in recent years at other manufacturers making these drugs (Caraco,

Ranbaxy, Apotex, Actavis, and KV).”

16 March 2011: An FDA internal email chain recorded concerns within the FDA at
a hold put on imports of Teva’s products by US officials at the port of entry into the
USA.”*! Captain Jensen’s email message of 21 March 2011 advised her FDA

colleagues: “ ... Teva is still reporting multiple entries of lots made at the Teva
Jerusalem facility are on hold and are reporting shortages will occur (again these are
common prescription medications and patients will have difficulty filling their
everyday prescriptions at the pharmacy without these - the Jerusalem facility
supplies large portion of the US market for medications needed for blood pressure,

seizures, Parkinson’s, diabetes and other chronic diseases.”

26 April 2011: The Wall Street Journal reported:?** “Teva Pharmaceutical Industries
Ltd. ... resumed production at an Irvine, Calif., facility that was on voluntary hold
for a year following quality control issues and regulatory intervention. The site,
which makes injectable products for the Israel generic drug company, received a
Food and Drug Administration warning letter in December 2009 that detailed
‘significant’ manufacturing violations and fixing the problems took longer than the
company initially expected. The company had said in February [2011] that
manufacturing problems at the site had cut sales by $230 million in 2010. Teva
reported full-year sales of $16.1 billion. At the time, Teva said ramping up
production at the plant would be a slow process that would take most of the year.
On Tuesday, Teva said restarting the operation - after an April 2010 manufacturing
and distribution hold - was a ‘significant step for improving its product availability
for the U.S. injectable market.’ The anesthetic propofol was manufactured at the site
and some product was recalled in 2009 after elevated levels of toxins were
discovered at the Irvine site. Teva has since stopped making the drug. In a
regulatory filing Tuesday, Teva said it also submitted a response to a January [2011]
warning letter relating to a Jerusalem pill-making facility, noting that it had
implemented ‘corrective actions.” The FDA had cited deficiencies related to
laboratory reporting and quality control systems, and deemed a response to an

earlier inspection as insufficient ...”

29 April 2011: FDA officials drafted a briefing note in preparation for a telephone
conference between Dr. Janet Woodcock, Director of CDER, and Teva’s CEO:?°?
“This briefing is to prepare Dr. Woodcock for telephone conference with Teva’s
CEO. The purpose of the call is to express FDA’s continuing concern regarding the
CGMP problems that the firm has had at several facilities, reinforce FDA’s concern
about the detrimental impact that Teva’s problems have had on market supply of
medically necessary drugs and seek commitment from the firm to notify FDA
before they take any action such as recall, plant/line shutdown, suspension of
distribution, and any other action that may result in shortage of medically necessary

drug.”

As regards the first item on the proposed agenda (“The Medical Needs for Teva’s
Products”), the FDA briefing note states: “Teva manufactures a significant number
of medically necessary drugs that can result in market shortage when they
discontinue or cut back production of these products. In 2010, the firm decided to
simply shut down production at the Teva Parenteral Medicines facility in Irvine,
CA, causing massive shortages and market supply disruptions of products that are
medically necessary for patients. Recently, the firm has recalled 30 lots involving
21 different drug products made at the Jerusalem facility. There is a real concern
about patient impact — these are medications that patients rely on for chronic
diseases. The products involved are blood pressure drugs, cholesterol lowering
drugs, diabetes drugs, arthritis drugs, antidepressants and other widely used
medications. We are worried about the impact of any supply disruption that might
occur at the Jerusalem facility. Teva has a very large market share for these products
described above and acquired additional market share when CGMP issues occurred
in recent years at other manufacturers making these drugs (Caraco, Ranbaxy
Apotex, Actavis and KV).” The agenda’s second item described Teva’s efforts to

address the cGMP issues at its facilities at Irvine and Jerusalem.

26 May 2011: In an FDA internal memorandum, Dr. Rosa requested a “priority
inspection” to be conducted by the FDA at Teva’s facility in Jerusalem.” This

inspection was completed on 19 June 2011 “with an NAT” [No Action Indicated].”°°

24 August 2011: An FDA internal email chain recorded concerns at the
unanticipated holding at a US port of entry of Teva’s products regarded by the FDA
as medically necessary drugs:?*° Dr. Rosa’s concluding message stated: “... A T-
CON with Teva has been scheduled for tomorrow at 4 pm. We do not know why the
product is being held up at the port, unless its [sic] due to routine import verification
as part of the import entry process. All the profiles are acceptable and an approval
recommendation has been enter[ed] for their pending applications, pertaining to the
Jerusalem facility. CDER OC is not the cause of the import hold up. We are aware
that the administrative/review record must be closed sooner than later. However

their FARs investigation into glass found in the API produced at their Jerusalem
site. We now have the information, and hope to resolved [sic] all outstanding issues

tomorrow ...”

9 September 2011: The FDA issued a close out letter regarding Teva’s Jerusalem
facility,°*” stating: “The Food and Drug Administration has completed an evaluation
of your firm’s corrective actions in response to our warning letter 320-11-08 dated
January 31, 2011. Based on our evaluation, it appears that you have addressed the
violation(s) contained in this Warning Letter. Future FDA inspections and
regulatory activities will further assess the adequacy and sustainability of these
corrections. This letter does not relieve you or your firm from the responsibility of
taking all necessary steps to assure sustained compliance with the Federal Food,
Drug, and Cosmetic Act and its implementing regulations or with other relevant
legal authority. The Agency expects you and your firm to maintain compliance and
will continue to monitor your state of compliance. This letter will not preclude any

future regulatory action should violations be observed during a subsequent

inspection or through other means.”

Prior to this close out letter, the FDA had approved ANDAs by Teva: ANDA
#090289 on 3 June 2011, ANDA #076361 on 20 June 2011 and ANDA #090199 on
22 August 2011.7°*

23 July 2012: The FDA’s Assistant Commissioner for Legislation sent to The
Honorable Elijah E. Cummings, Ranking Member of the Committee on Oversight
and Government Reform of the US House of Representatives, a long and detailed

letter addressing the Committee’s staff report on drug shortages in the USA.2”

It suffices here to cite only the opening paragraphs: “Thank you for your letter of
July 9, 2012, regarding the report entitled ‘FDA’s Contribution to the Drug
Shortage Crisis’ (the Report). We appreciate the opportunity to provide clarification

about the issues raised in the Report. Preventing drug shortages is a top priority for

the Food and Drug Administration (FDA or the Agency). The number of drug
shortages has risen steadily since 2005 to hit an all-time high of 251 drug shortages
in 2011. This is a very troubling situation that FDA takes very seriously. The root
causes of drug shortages, however, lie largely outside of FDA’s purview. Contrary
to the conclusion reached in the Report, FDA is not the root cause of this serious
public health problem. In recent years, more than half of all drug shortages were
related to manufacturing production problems, including quality-related issues and
delays. The remainder of the shortages was caused by business decisions to
discontinue certain products, difficulty obtaining raw materials, loss of
manufacturing sites, increased demand, and component problems. Patients expect
and deserve high-quality drugs. It is the manufacturer’s responsibility to ensure that
its products are safe, effective, and of high quality. FDA is committed to working
with industry to resolve quality or manufacturing problems that arise, to ensure
continued patient access to vital safe and effective medicines. In fact, in appropriate
cases, FDA may exercise regulatory flexibility to prevent or mitigate a drug
shortage, such as by expediting inspections or review of manufacturing supplements
to facilitate production changes ...” [footnotes omitted]. The letter also addressed

the closure of Teva’s facility at Irvine.

18 October 2012: A Knight Ridder/Tribune Brief reported: “The Orange County
Business Journal’ reports that Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. .... is firing 65
employees at its plant in Irvine, California, according to a state filing. The
newspaper added that cuts will take effect on October 29 and scientists, chemists,
and inspectors [sic]. Teva had an estimated 500 workers in Irvine before the filing.
It cut 156 workers in Irvine last year as a result of an earlier year-long halt to
production after it stopped making propofol, a sedative that gained notoriety in the
death of Michael Jackson. Teva acquired the Irvine plant in 2003 through the
acquisition of generic drug maker Sicor Inc. ‘The New York Times’ reported today
that, in 2009, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) cited Teva for several
violations at its injectable drug plant in Irvine, including for the failure to catch
bacterial contamination of propofol, before it left the factory. The citation was part

of a crackdown after Margaret Hamburg became FDA commissioner. Teva said it

4 June 2013: In-Pharma Technologist reported:? “... Last July [2012], the Food
and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act (FDASIA) - aimed to tighten
the grip on the global supply chain - was signed into law and included the
requirement for pharmaceutical companies to notify the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) of any anticipated shortages. FDA spokesperson Lisa
Kubaska told this publication that ‘since FDASIA was enacted, the FDA has been
receiving daily calls and emails from manufacturers about potential problems.’
Though the legislation has led to closer cooperation between manufacturers and the
FDA, Kubaska told us shortages are still an issue and ‘about 75 per cent of drug
shortages are caused by manufacturing issues’ and breakdowns in quality. ‘Such
breakdowns have occurred most often with manufacturers of sterile injectable drugs,
including oncology drugs. These quality issues have included compromised sterility
and the presence of glass, metal and other material inside drug vials’ ... Propofol
Off Shortage List: One drug that has sat on the FDA’s drug shortage list for the past
few years was propofol, the anaesthesia infamously associated with the death of
Michael Jackson. The shortage had been caused by manufacturing issues first at
Teva’s Irvine, California facility and then at Hospira’s Clayton, North Carolina
plant, yet following the recent re-entry into propofol manufacturing by these two
players, supply levels are, according to Kubaska, ‘anticipated by the firms to be
more than adequate to meet demand.’ Last summer the only company
manufacturing the drug was Fresenius Kabi, who worked with the FDA in order to

ramp up capacity from two of its European sites ....”

Conclusion

In conclusion, the FDA issued its warning letter regarding Teva’s Jerusalem facility
on 31 January 2011; it was site-specific (as with Teva’s Irvine facility); and the
FDA did not take in its warning letters a “corporate” view of Teva’s violations in its
two facilities. Beyond the Jerusalem warning letter, the FDA did not implement
against Teva’s Jerusalem facility any import alert; and the FDA did not initiate any
further administrative or enforcement action against Teva in regard to its Jerusalem
facility.°°° Following the Jerusalem warning letter, Teva proposed immediately to
close down production at its Jerusalem facility (as it had earlier with its Irvine
facility); and this proposal provoked sustained attempts by the FDA to ensure
Teva’s continued production and shipment to the USA of medically necessary
drugs. For Teva’s Jerusalem facility, the period from the warning letter in January
2011 to the FDA’s close out letter in September 2011 (following the FDA’s re-

inspection in June 2011) was nine months.

As a matter of fact, on the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the Tribunal
concludes that Apotex Inc.’s two facilities at Signet and Etobicoke were regulated
differently by the FDA during 2009-2011 from Teva’s Jerusalem facility in 2011,
based on the imposition of an import alert in one case and not in the other. The

material question is why?

Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson (the expert witnesses called by the Claimants)
testified that, in their view, Apotex was not “riskier” than Teva in a way that would

justify the FDA treating Apotex less favourably than Teva."™*

In contrast, Mr. Vodra
(the expert witness called by the Respondent) testified that the FDA “was extremely
worried about the impact of the Teva recall on U.S. patients in a way that it was not
with the Apotex recall two years before ...” Mr. Vodra also testified that, had the
cGMP problems with Teva emerged in 2009 and those with Apotex in 2011,
“FDA’s drug shortage analysis might well have led to a different regulatory action

that Teva at its Jerusalem facility, in contrast with Apotex Inc. at its two facilities,

was not operating “out of control.”

The Tribunal returns to other factual and legal issues later below.

The Sandoz Chronology

The Tribunal has taken the following factual chronology principally from: (i) the list
of evidentiary references to contemporary documentation which was supplied by the
Parties to the Tribunal in regard to Sandoz/Novartis (namely, in response to its
Question B2); and (ii) documentary exhibits and testimony cited by the Parties in
their written and oral pleadings in this arbitration. The Tribunal did not hear any
witness from Sandoz/Novartis in this arbitration. For reasons explained later below,
the contemporary public documentary evidence assumed particular significance in

this case; and hence it is necessary here to cite much of it verbatim.

Novartis AG, a Swiss company, owns a group of companies engaged in the
research, development, manufacture and marketing of branded drugs, generic
pharmaceutical products, preventive vaccines, diagnostic tools, and consumer health
products. Novartis operates through different divisions: Sandoz International
GmbH, a German company, is its generic business division which owns subsidiary
companies in several countries, including Canada and the USA. Novartis/Sandoz is
the second largest generic manufacturer (in terms of revenues) in the world, being
engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of generic medicines (as
well as pharmaceutical and biotechnological active ingredients). It has global
operations in more than 130 countries; and its revenues in 2011 were US$ 8.5
billion.?6’ For the USA, it has in excess of 600 ANDAs.? (For ease of reference
below, the Tribunal does not seek to distinguish between the different members of

the Novartis group of companies, referring to them as “Sandoz” or “Novartis.”’)

Sandoz operates three manufacturing facilities at (i) Wilson, North Carolina USA,
(ii) Boucherville, Quebec, Canada and (iii) Broomfield, Colorado, USA. The FDA.

2008 and June 2011 and the Boucherville facility in July-August 2011.7 These
inspections and their consequences are described in further detail below. Sandoz

operates a fourth facility at Lincoln, Nebraska, USA.

Like Teva, although the Sandoz facilities within the USA make Sandoz subject to
other sanctions, its manufacture in Boucherville, Canada, of drugs for export to the

US market makes those drugs subject to the Act and eligible for Import Alert 66-40.

2008

12 August 2008: The FDA sent a warning letter to Sandoz in regard to its Wilson
facility:°”” “On March 17 through March 31, 2008, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) conducted an inspection of your manufacturing facility
located at 4700 Sandoz Drive, Wilson, North Carolina. The inspection revealed
significant deviations from the Current Good Manufacturing Practice (CGMP)
regulations ... in the manufacturing of your drug products, which include
Metoprolol Succinate ER tablets. These deviations cause your drug products to be
adulterated within the meaning of Section 501(a)(2)(B) of the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act (the Act) [21 U.S.C. § 351 (a)(2)(B)]. The violations include, but
are not limited to, the following ... [Here follow seven numbered violations].” After
the formal warning, the letter concluded: “We acknowledge that some corrections
were initiated by your firm during the course of this inspection. We also
acknowledge receipt of your initial response to the FDA 483, dated April 9, 2008, as
well as your follow-up responses dated April 29, 2008 and June 27, 2008.”

This Wilson warning letter continued: “In your responses, you committed to
implementing a quality improvement plan for your facility after you complete your
analysis of the existing quality system and the revision of all control records, which
will be completed by [redacted by the Respondent] and [redacted by the
Respondent] respectively. You also agreed that the Metoprolol products were not
validated, and you have committed to revalidate both strengths (25 and 50 mg). Our
concerns with these responses were discussed with Sandoz representatives at the

meeting held at the Atlanta District office on July 10. We are in receipt of a follow

up response dated August 10 [2008] to that meeting. This latest response is
currently under review. You originally decided to temporarily suspend distribution
of Metoprolol 25 and 50 mg tablets until the available pre-compression and
dissolution data was reviewed. However, you have decided to resume distribution of
these products based on your rationale that successful, routine, finished-product
testing of manufactured lots is sufficient proof that the product is of acceptable
quality. We question the continued distribution of this product until better process
controls are implemented and process validation is completed. We are also
concerned that the problems noted in the Metoprolol validations could be indicative
of problems and poor decisions made with other product validations. In addition to
the deficiencies listed above, we are also concerned that you may not be utilizing a
global approach to the implementation of manufacturing controls. For example, one
proposed corrective action at the Wilson site is to implement an automated
investigation management tracking system ([redacted by the Respondent]) which is
already in use at other Sandoz sites. It is our expectation that all Sandoz sites
intended to be used for the manufacture of drugs have a comprehensive evaluation
to assure compliance with all laws and regulations governing the manufacture of
drugs. We request that you provide documentation describing the specific steps you
will take to perform these evaluations and to implement the necessary corrective

actions at all Sandoz’ sites ...”

Given the paucity of evidence regarding subsequent events in 2008, the Tribunal
assumes that the violations in this Wilson warning letter were somehow resolved by
Sandoz to the FDA’s ultimate satisfaction. Nonetheless, these violations are relevant
to subsequent events in 2011 onwards, with repeat violations later cited by the FDA.

regarding Sandoz’s facility at Wilson.

manufacturing facilities, Sandoz Inc., located at 2555 W. Midway Blvd,
Broomfield, Colorado; Sandoz Inc., located at 4700 Sandoz Dr., Wilson, North
Carolina; and Sandoz Canada Inc., located at 145 Jules-Leger Street, Boucherville,
Quebec, Canada, investigators from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
identified significant violations of the Current Good Manufacturing Practice
(CGMP) regulations for Finished Pharmaceuticals ... These violations cause your
drug products to be adulterated within the meaning of section 501 (a)(2)(B) of the
Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ... in that the methods used in, or the
facilities or controls used for, their manufacture, processing, packing, or holding do
not conform to, or are not operated or administered in conformity with, CGMP. The
August 2011 inspection also revealed that Sandoz Canada Inc. failed to submit
NDA Field Alert Reports (FARs) to FDA in compliance with 21 CFR §
314.81(b)(1)(ii), as required by section 505(k) of the Act [21 U.S.C. § 355(k)]. An
applicant is required to submit, within three working days of receipt, information
concerning any bacteriological contamination, or any significant chemical, physical,
or other change or deterioration in the distributed drug product, or any failure of one
or more distributed batches of drug product to meet the specifications established
for it in the application. We have reviewed your firm’s responses of May 31, 2011,
July 13, 2011, and August 25, 2011, and note that they lack sufficient corrective
action. Specific violations observed during the inspections include, but are not
limited to, the following: [here follow several numbered and unnumbered
violations]”; and, after the formal warning, the letter continued: “Within fifteen
working days of receipt of this letter, please notify this office in writing of the
specific steps that you have taken to correct violations. Include an explanation of
each step being taken to prevent the recurrence of violations and copies of
supporting documentation. If you cannot complete corrective action within fifteen
working days, state the reason for the delay and the date by which you will have

completed the correction ...”

The Novartis warning letter concluded: “If, as a result of receiving this Warning
Letter or in general, you are considering making a decision that will result in a
decreased number of finished drug products or bulk drug substances produced by
your manufacturing facility, FDA requests that you contact CDER’s Drug Shortages

Program immediately, as you begin your internal discussions, at

drugshortages @ fda.hhs.gov in order to ensure that your action(s) does not adversely

affect the public health.”

The Tribunal notes that these three inspections of different facilities at similar times,
involving two FDA offices and the FDA’s international office were co-ordinated by
the FDA in a manner which suggests that the FDA already suspected that
Sandoz/Novartis as a corporate entity was not providing sufficient oversight and
control of the state of compliance at its facilities, i.e. the FDA was taking a
“corporate view” even before the inspections leading to this Novartis warning
letter.” As regards the quotation from the warning letter in the paragraph
immediately above, the Tribunal notes that this reference in 2011 to CDER’s Drug
Shortages Program did not appear in the FDA’s earlier warning letters regarding

Apotex’s two facilities in 2009 and 2010.

The Novartis warning letter of 18 November 2011 was addressed to Novartis’ Chief
Executive Officer as a “corporate” letter addressing all three facilities collectively
and placing full responsibility on the upper management of Novartis/Sandoz, as the
following passage makes clear: “We note that CGMP violations listed in this letter
include multiple repeated violations from those cited in the August 2008 Warning
Letter issued to Sandoz Inc.’s Wilson, North Carolina facility and repeated
observations from previous inspections at your Sandoz Canada Inc. facility in
Boucherville, Quebec, Canada. It is apparent that Novartis International AG
(Novartis) is not implementing global and sustainable corrective actions. We remind
you that you are responsible for ensuring that your firm’s drug manufacturing
operations comply with applicable requirements, including the CGMP regulations.
FDA expects Novartis to undertake a comprehensive and global assessment of your
manufacturing operations to ensure that drug products conform to FDA
requirements. Finally, the Agency is concerned about the response of Novartis to
this matter. Corporate management has the responsibility to ensure the quality,
safety, and integrity of its products. Neither upper management at Novartis nor at
Sandoz Inc., nor at Sandoz Canada Inc., ensured global, adequate, or timely

resolution of the issues at these sites.”

Dr. Rosa testified that Sandoz voluntarily responded to the cGMP violations found
by the FDA at the Boucherville facility by temporarily suspending and slowing
production at that facility, adding: “Although Sandoz Canada was focused on
remediation efforts and supplying critical injectable drugs to the Canadian market, it
supplied certain medically necessary injectable drugs for the U.S. market. FDA
determined that the medical necessity of these drugs and Sandoz Canada’s
remediation commitments weighed against adding the facility to the Import Alert.
As a result, Sandoz Canada continued to market life-sustaining, single source drugs
with the concurrence of FDA’s Drug Shortage Office. The firm voluntarily stopped
shipping other products to the United States. FDA’s investigation of this facility

remains ongoing.”?”?

At the Hearing, Dr. Rosa was asked for the sources of his information summarised
in the paragraph immediately above, to which he replied: “They [Sandoz Canada]
submitted the information in writing to us that was going to be the action. They
also, during conversations, said that they were going to be eliminating, ceasing
production, specifically ceasing, not moving products out that were not — they were
not continuing manufacturing products that were not essential products. In terms of
slow production, that is actually one of the documents that they submitted. So that’s
where the information is coming from, and from conversations and meetings held

had acknowledged that he was not personally involved in the FDA’s decisions about
drug shortages, but rather: “I’m involved in sending the consult [sic], having the
discussion in terms of their assessment, and moving forward based on an agency
decision.”””> The Tribunal accepts that Dr. Rosa was generally involved in the
Novartis warning letter and its consequences, based on his testimony at the Hearing:
“T would have to see exactly if I reviewed the exact [Novartis] Warning Letter [of
18 November 2011] and the details of the case. But I do recall having discussions
and looking at and being involved, to the extent — if I sign off on [sic] ... I was one

25 January 2012: The Novartis Annual Report (SEC Form 20-F) cited the FDA’s
warning letter of 18 November 2011.°78 It advised, under the heading “Forward
Looking Statements” of “unexpected product manufacturing issues, including the
potential outcomes of the Warning Letter issued to us with respect to three Sandoz
manufacturing facilities, and the potential outcome of the shutdown of the OTC
manufacturing facility at Lincoln, Nebraska ... “ (p. 2); and “Like our competitors,
we have faced, and continue to face, significant manufacturing issues. For example,
in November 2011, we received a Warning Letter from the FDA with respect to
three of our Sandoz Division’s facilities - in Broomfield, Colorado, Wilson, North
Carolina, and Boucherville, Canada - which remains unresolved. The Warning
Letter raised concerns regarding these facilities’ compliance with FDA cGMP
regulations. It states that until the FDA confirms that the deficiencies have been
corrected, the FDA can recommend disapproval of any pending applications or
supplements listing Novartis affiliates as a drug manufacturer. In addition, FDA
may refuse requests to issue export certificates to our Sandoz US affiliate, or import
certificates to our Sandoz Canada affiliates. The letter further states that other
federal agencies may take the Warning Letter into account when considering the
award of contracts. Sandoz is collaborating with the FDA to promptly correct all
concerns raised in the Warning Letter, and to ensure that our products are safe and
effective and meet highest quality standards. However, if we fail to fully resolve the
issues raised in the Warning Letter then we could be subject to legal action without

further notice including, without limitation, seizure and injunction.” (p. 10).

19 February 2012: The Globe and Mail, Canada’s national newspaper, reported:?”
“... Today, Sandoz Canada’s reputation lies in tatters after chronic problems at its
state-of-the-art plant on Montreal’s south shore caught the eye of U.S. regulators
[i.e. the Boucherville facility]. Much of its production is halted as it tries to fix the
problems, leaving pharmacists and health-care providers alarmed at what could be
months of shortages of injectable medications that treat everything from nausea
among cancer patients and abnormal heart rhythms to endometriosis. Last week,
Sandoz told Canadian health-care providers it would discontinue certain products
and temporarily suspend production on the heels of a scathing ‘warning letter’ from
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration three months ago that criticized the plant’s
‘ineffective quality system’. ‘As we progress with our remediation activities, all
production processes will be affected, significantly reducing output from our
Boucherville plant and likely resulting in temporary supply disruptions,’ Sandoz
Canada president Michel Robidoux said in a Feb. 16 [2012] letter to pharmacists,
obtained by The Globe and Mail. He didn't specify how long the disruption would
last, but that Sandoz Canada would focus on ‘optimizing’ supplies of medically
necessary drugs to the Canadian market and had halted production of ointments,
ophthalmics, suppositories and all non-medically necessary drugs. ... In a statement
to The Globe and Mail, Sandoz Canada said it was intensifying efforts ‘to ensure
high quality standards’... It said the decision to halt production was voluntary and
related to efforts to restore ‘high quality standards in manufacturing operations’... In
total, Sandoz said it had committed a total of over $170-million (U.S.) to improve
quality at the Boucherville plant as well as two other plants in Colorado and North

Carolina that were also cited in the FDA letter ...”

20 February 2012: CBC News (of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation)
reported:°*° “The revelation that a major drugmaker is cutting production at its
Quebec plant has ramped up fears among doctors and patients about a critical
shortage of injectable medicines nationwide. Supplies have already dried up for

was temporarily suspending production at its Boucherville Que., facility. ... The
company said it was expecting ‘a significant reduction in output’ and was halting
production lines to upgrade operations after quality-control assessments by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration warned the factory fell short of FDA standards ...
Some products will be discontinued, while others will resume production once the
suspension is lifted, although Sandoz has not clarified which drugs will go out of
production. The company said in a statement it would prioritize production of its
most critical drugs ... ‘We will focus all available capacity on the supply of life-
saving and acute care injectable medicines to ensure that Canadian patients with
critical medical conditions continue receiving adequate treatment,’ the statement
read. In the meantime, physicians are scrambling to find replacement therapies to
treat certain ailments. Response from Sandoz Canada: ‘In light of the November
2011 FDA Warning Letter, Sandoz Canada has further intensified its ongoing
efforts to ensure high quality standards across its manufacturing operations. As part
of these efforts, we will temporarily suspend or discontinue the production of
certain products at our Boucherville site, most of which have alternatives in the
marketplace, to prioritize production of most medically necessary products, and

focus on the supply of critical medicines to the Canadian market.’ ...”

The CBC report continued, as regards drug shortages in Canada: “ ... Feldman
[Larissa Feldman, operating a Montreal drugstore] said pharmacists will have to
consult closely with doctors to ensure they prescribe alternative medications, if
they're available. ‘We call the hospital, we call other pharmacist colleagues, and we
try to find the medication,’ she said. The latest slowdown comes amid a global
shortage hitting the pharmaceutical industry, but health-care providers have
complained they often receive little warning ahead of major production trims from
drugmakers. Early warning system urged: Dianne Lamarre, president of the Quebec
Order of Pharmacists, said that kind of timely information could be used to seek out
backup drugs and alternatives in the marketplace. She has called for the creation of
an early warning system to signal when a specific drug is in short supply. Such a
system would require unprecedented co-operation among competing drug
companies. ‘We need a special agency which will ensure a follow-up with
industries, which will make Health Canada react more quickly when essential drugs

are not available,’ Lamarre said. She told The Globe and Mail newspaper she

expects some production lines will be running at half capacity. The Canadian
Pharmacists Association is also urging Health Canada to force pharmaceuticals
companies to provide notice of changes to production and inform doctors long

before they discontinue certain drugs.”

Mid-February 2012: In a media release (of 16 May 2012),"8! Sandoz Canada
reported that it had set up an allocation system in mid-February 2012. The system
was set up “to handle the temporary decrease in injectable drug production and to

99282

ensure all customers received fair supply of products.”*”” (This allocation system

continued until 8 May 2013: see below.)

29 February 2012: A Sandoz Canada media release stated:°*? “Sandoz Canada is
continuing its efforts to maintain reliable supply of essential medicines following a
temporary slow-down of production, resulting from increased investment in
strengthening manufacturing compliance at its Boucherville, Quebec, site. In light
of the November 2011 Warning Letter from the US Food and Drug Administration,
Sandoz Canada has intensified its ongoing efforts to ensure high quality standards at
this manufacturing plant. As production continues, the company is focusing its
efforts on essential medicines and prioritizing resources to ensure normal supply is
restored as quickly as possible. As part of this prioritization, the company has
discontinued production of some non-essential drugs, including ointments,
ophthalmics, suppositories and certain injectable drugs, for most of which it has
already identified potential alternative supply from within Sandoz/Novartis or other
qualified third-party suppliers. ... ‘Our objective is to restore normal levels of supply
as soon as possible, and we will make every effort to meet patient needs ...’ said
Sandoz Canada President Michel Robidoux. ‘We will focus all available capacity on
the supply of medically necessary injectable medicines to try to ensure that patients

receiving a letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration raising concerns
about the level of sanitation at the factory. Last week, a fire forced the company to
halt production entirely, further squeezing the supply of vital painkillers, anesthetics
and antibiotics across the country. In the face of widespread shortages, hospitals
have been scrambling to conserve their supplies ... But the current shortage is
particularly acute, [doctors and pharmacists] say. Sandoz supplies about 90 per cent
of the generic injectable drugs in Canada, so the slowdown was a major blow for

health-care facilities ...”

20 March 2012: A Sandoz News Flash reported: “Sandoz and Novartis do not
view the current supply situation in Canada as an opportunity to increase our profits.
Our objective is to ensure that patients have access to critical, high-quality
medicines they need, and we will honor our pricing for existing hospital contracts,
including supply we secure to service these agreements. Patients remain our
priority. We are also investing significantly into the enhancement of quality
procedures and systems at the Boucherville site for the benefit of all patients treated
with out medicines. Sandoz Canada has been continuing its efforts started in late
2011 to maintain reliable supply of essential medicines following the temporary
slow-down in production at its Boucherville, Quebec, site. As part of these efforts,

we have identified alternative supply from other reliable third-party suppliers ...”

27 March 2012: According to a Sandoz News Flash:?”° “Sandoz Canada is pleased
to announce that production has fully resumed as of March 23rd, following the fire
that broke out earlier this month. All necessary actions have now been completed,
and all capacity is again fully focused on the production and supply of critical

medicines.”

remediation efforts and strengthen manufacturing compliance at the Boucherville
site, production output has been optimized, allowing Sandoz to meet the vast
majority of Canadian market needs for its entire injectable portfolio. At present,
Sandoz is supplying is supplying more than 80% of market needs for its entire
injectable portfolio, and more than 90% for the products currently in production. In
mid-February [2012], Sandoz introduced an allocation system based on 2011
demand which ensures that each customer receives a fair share of available
medicines. Further improvements in output are expected which should increase
allocation levels for all products in production to at least 100% of forecasted market
needs by November 2012. Sandoz will nevertheless maintain its allocation system
through the first quarter of 2013, in order to avoid unnecessary stockpiling and
potential backorder. ‘I am very proud of our team’s unwavering commitment to
patients. Since the beginning of the year, we have worked day and night to meet
medical needs and have partnered with pharmacists and other healthcare
professionals, as well as with provincial governments and Health Canada, to
optimally manage the supply situation’ said Sandoz Canada President and General
Manager Michel Robidoux. ‘We have provided on-going transparency on our
supply status, optimized production for most medically necessary products, and
continue to explore all available options to ensure we meet demand as best we

can.’...

18 May 2012: Sandoz wrote to US medical practitioners regarding the FDA’s
approval of importation into USA of an unapproved formulation of injectable
phentolamine mesylate manufactured by Sandoz Canada “[d]ue to the current
critical shortage” of the drug in USA,” stating: “ ... At this time, FDA’s exercise
of enforcement discretion for the importation of Sandoz’ phentolamine mesylate
injection product is limited to Sandoz during the critical shortage of phentolamine
mesylate injection. Importation or distribution of this product in the United States
by any other entity is outside the scope of FDA’s regulatory discretion, and FDA
has not approved Sandoz’ phentolamine mesylate injection product for marketing in

the United States ...”

The Tribunal notes that Sandoz’s export of phentolamine mesylate injectables to the
USA was the subject of an exceptional permission by the FDA, not extended to non-
medically necessary drugs. In his written testimony, Dr. Rosa described this
“exercise of enforcement discretion” by the FDA as follows: “Although Sandoz
Canada was focused on remediation efforts and supplying critical injectable drugs to
the Canadian market, it supplied certain medically necessary injectable drugs for the
U.S. market. FDA determined that the medical necessity of these drugs and Sandoz
Canada’s remediation commitments weighed against adding the facility to the
Import Alert. As a result, Sandoz Canada continued to market life-sustaining, single
source drugs with the concurrence of FDA’s Drug Shortage Office. The firm
voluntarily stopped shipping other products to the United States.”?*? (The Tribunal
also notes that, much later on 22 March 2013, the American Society of Health-
System Pharmacists announced, on its website, Phentolamine Mesylate for
Injection, that Sandoz Canada’s phentolamine injection was no longer required
because Bedford (a US manufacturer) had supplies of this drug.”*4)

significant evidential importance to this official study issued by Canada’s
legislature, after taking evidence from several sources (not including Sandoz

Canada). The Report includes several passages regarding Sandoz.

First, the Canadian Report described the Canadian legislature’s several resolutions
in March 2012: “... On 13 March 2012, the House of Commons Standing
Committee on Health (the Committee) adopted a motion to undertake a short study
on drug supply in Canada. The motion requested that, over the course of three
meetings, the Committee: ‘[E]xamine the role of government and industry in
determining drug supply in Canada, how the provinces and territories determine
what drugs are required in their jurisdiction, how the industry responds to them, and

the impact this has on stakeholders.’ During meetings on 27 and 29 March, as well

as 3 April 2012, the Committee heard from Health Canada officials, representatives
of the pharmaceutical industry, healthcare professionals, pharmaceutical
wholesalers and bulk purchasers, and patient advocates. This report outlines the role
played by these stakeholders, summarizes the concerns that were expressed and
offers recommendations that may mitigate future disruptions in the drug supply. ...
On 14 March 2012 the following motion was passed unanimously in the House of
Commons: ‘That, in the opinion of this House, the government should: (a) in
cooperation with provinces, territories and industry, develop a nationwide strategy
to anticipate, identify, and manage shortages of essential medications; (b) require
drug manufacturers to report promptly to Health Canada, the provinces and the
territories any planned disruption or discontinuation in production; and (c) expedite
the review of regulatory submissions in order to make safe and effective

medications available to the Canadian public.”

Next, the Canadian Report described the reason for the Canadian legislature’s study,
namely events at Sandoz’s Boucherville facility: “This motion was prompted by
recent events at Sandoz, a major manufacturer of generic medicines in Canada,
which brought about significant shortages of critical medicines. Its manufacturing
facility in Boucherville, Quebec produces 50% of generic injectable drugs used in
Canadian hospitals. Sandoz received a warning letter on 18 November 2011 from
the United States’ Food and Drug Administration (FDA) explaining that the facility
was non-compliant with U.S. drug regulations. After receiving the FDA’s letter, the
company slowed down production in order to address the compliance issues. The
Committee heard that, in December 2011, Health Canada saw on the FDA’s Web
site the warning letter to Sandoz and that the Department followed up with Sandoz
to ask what their remediation plans were. Sandoz initially planned to suspend
production of several non-essential products in order to focus their available
production capacity on medically necessary products. Nevertheless, the Committee
was told that Sandoz announced on 17 February 2012 an immediate reduction in
available supply of essential medications. The Committee was not told why
Sandoz’s plan to focus on essential medicines was not successful. On 2 March 2012,
the Minister of Health wrote a letter to Sandoz concerned about the company’s
failure to voluntarily provide publicly available, clear, precise and timely

information regarding supply disruptions as this was contrary to an agreement it had

signed onto the previous fall [footnote omitted]. A fire broke out in the boiler room
of the Sandoz facility in Boucherville on 4 March 2012. As a result, production was

stopped completely for a week before resuming partially ...”

19 July 2012: A Novartis press release, with the company’s 2Q 2012 Financial
Report, reported:?”° “Sandoz also continued to strengthen quality operations across
its manufacturing network. This includes its three North American sites where the
division is on track to meet its remediation commitments. Sandoz has upgraded
senior leadership in quality and manufacturing operations, both globally and at the
site level. ... While Sandoz slowed down production to implement remediation
activities at its three North American sites, delivery performance across all sites has
improved. Further improvements in service levels and output are expected as

remediation progresses.”

23 July 2012: The Tribunal has already summarised above (as regards Teva) the
letter from the Assistant Commissioner for Legislation to The Hon. Elijah E.
Cummings, a Ranking Member of US House of Representatives Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform.””” As regards Sandoz, this letter stated:
“Sandoz/Novartis: Sandoz, owned by Novartis, has a site in Canada that makes
sterile injectable products for the U.S. market. FDA inspection of that site led to the
issuance of a Warning Letter in November 2011, citing concerns with unusual
crystal formation in some batches of sterile drug products distributed to the United
States. ... Sandoz voluntarily suspended some production of these products to
correct the quality concern. In December 2011, Novartis announced a voluntary
shutdown to address widespread quality defects and manufacturing failures,
identified after more than 1,360 complaints of foreign, stray, and broken tablets
found in opiate products. FDA issued Form 483s to Novartis in July 2011 and
January 2012, after inspections of Novartis’ [Lincoln] Nebraska facility revealed a
failure to investigate consumer complaints in an adequate fashion. FDA also issued
a Public Health Advisory to alert health care professionals and patients of the
possible contamination of the opiate products manufactured by Novartis. The

manufacturing issues Sandoz and Novartis experienced also compromised the

sterility of the products and could result in contaminated products that would
severely injure patients if administered.” (The Tribunal notes that the FDA treated
the Lincoln facility separately from the Boucherville facility; and the former was
not the subject of the FDA’s Novartis warning letter of November 2011 regarding

the Wilson, Broomfield and Boucherville facilities).

6 September 2012: A Sandoz News Flash reported:7 “... At present, Sandoz
Canada is supplying 90.2% of market demand for the products currently in
production and 90.3% demand for the top 8 medically necessary injectables
identified by Health Canada and the provinces and priorities for the Canadian
market. During the routine shutdown, good progress was also made in our site

remediation efforts according to schedule ...”

13 November 2012: According to the “FiercePharmaManufacturing” newsletter:
“The FDA has removed a Novartis ... plant in Colorado [Broomfield] from its
warning letter watch list, a development that Novartis CEO Joseph Jimenez says
shows the company is getting its manufacturing act together. In an emailed
statement, a Novartis spokeswoman explained. ‘The FDA confirmed on November
7, 2012 that our Sandoz manufacturing site in Broomfield, Colorado, one of three
sites referenced in the November 2011 Warning Letter, has achieved positive
compliance status following a re-inspection in August [2012]. We welcome this
development, which we see as a significant milestone in our remediation efforts
across all three sites. Wilson and Boucherville are currently pending FDA re-
inspection and all commitments to FDA and Health Canada are on track.’ Jimenez,
in an interview with a German newspaper, said, ‘This development makes me

confident. We are on the right track but must not stop,’ Reuters reports.”

Carolina, and Boucherville, Canada. The letter followed inspections at all three sites
in the course of 2011, and raised concerns regarding these facilities’ compliance
with FDA cGMP regulations. The FDA observations in the letter related primarily
to general documentation, validation and investigation practices. It states that until
the FDA confirms that the deficiencies have been corrected, the FDA can
recommend disapproval of any pending applications or supplements listing Novartis
affiliates as a drug manufacturer. In addition, FDA may refuse requests to issue
export certificates to our Sandoz US affiliate, or import certificates to our Sandoz
Canada affiliates. The letter further states that other federal agencies may take the
Warning Letter into account when considering the award of contracts. Sandoz is
collaborating with the FDA to promptly correct all concerns raised in the Warning
Letter, and to ensure that our products are safe and effective and meet highest
quality standards. In the fourth quarter of 2012, Sandoz announced that the FDA
upgraded the compliance status of its Broomfield, Colorado site. Nonetheless, if we
fail to fully resolve the issues raised in the Warning Letter then we could be subject
to legal action without further notice including, without limitation, seizure and

injunction...” (p. 79).

26/27 March 2013: According to the Wall Street Journal:**' “The injectables
market has been dominated by a handful of companies, because making the sterile
medicines is costly but returns are generally low ... Unable to make a profit, several
companies fled the market, and some drugs had just one supplier. Then
manufacturing problems, supply constraints and government scrutiny of aging
plants in recent years forced remaining firms, such as market leaders Hospira Inc.,
Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH’s Ben Venue Laboratories business and Novartis
AG’s Sandoz unit, to shut down facilities or scale back production. The result was
that the number of sterile injectables experiencing shortages jumped to 183 in 2011,
from 23 five years earlier. The number of shortages fell to 84 last year, according to

the U.S. Food and Drug Administration ...”

Boucherville plant. The allocation system was set up in mid-February 2012 to
handle the temporary decrease in injectable drug production and to ensure all

customers received fair supply of products. ...”

Conclusion

In conclusion, Sandoz received two warning letters in 2008 (as regards its Wilson
facility) and in November 2011 (as regards its Wilson, Broomfield and Boucherville
facilities). In both warning letters, the FDA took a “corporate” approach to Sandoz’s
non-compliance with cGMP regulations. As a foreign facility, the FDA did not
subject the Boucherville facility to any import alert. It is not clear on the evidence
whether the FDA has yet confirmed that the Boucherville facility is in in a state of
compliance, although the Broomfield facility was so confirmed on 7 November
2012 (after a re-inspection by the FDA in August 2012). As described below, there
seems to be continued regulatory or other action by the FDA against Sandoz and the

Boucherville facility (albeit still without any import alert).

As a matter of fact, on the evidence adduced in this arbitration, the Tribunal
concludes that Apotex Inc.’s two facilities at Signet and Etobicoke were regulated
differently by the FDA in 2009-2011 from Sandoz’s Boucherville facility in 2011-
2012, based on the imposition of an import alert in one case and not in the other.

The material question, again, is why?

Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson (the expert witnesses called by the Claimants)
testified: “... FDA did not take any enforcement action against Sandoz. There was
no ban on sales of Sandoz drugs in the US; FDA had no way to ensure that drugs
from Boucherville did not enter the US; and there was no requirement for re-
inspection prior to resumption of sales in the US (and, accordingly, without any
delays associated with such re-inspection). In contrast with the treatment accorded

Sandoz, Apotex was placed on the Import Alert on August 28, 2009, just weeks

Part II — Page 70 of 73

3.200.

3.201.

 

after the Signet inspection ... Apotex was not removed from the Import Alert for

99303
almost two years. 0

In contrast, Mr. Vodra (the expert witness called by the Respondent) testified: “...
[i]n response to a critical FDA inspection of its Canadian facility, Sandoz Inc.,
temporarily suspended production at the facility of all but some medically necessary
drugs, as well as critical medicines that were only to be distributed within Canada,
FDA did not add that facility to the Import Alert ... the company told FDA it would
not ship any non-medically necessary products to the U.S. while it remedied its
cGMP issues, thereby making an Import Alert unnecessary. In my opinion, had
Apotex similarly told FDA on August 17, 2009, that it would not export any non-
medically necessary products to the U.S. pending remediation, it is probable that no

Import Alert would have been issued” [Footnotes omitted].°*

At the Hearing, Dr. Rosa was asked why the FDA did not impose an import alert on
the Boucherville facility, to which he answered: “Because - for several reasons. We
did not place them on Import Alert — one of them we’ ve discussed today because of
the drug shortage situation. That was one of them. Number 2, Sandoz’s ... actions
and approach were the appropriate corrective actions. Ceasing production, reducing
the manufacturing of nonessential drugs was another action. They stopped the
manufacturing of drugs, not only for the U.S., but for the rest of the world. That’s —
those are some of the primary reasons. The other reason is because the history of
that facility gave us no indication that that facility was operating outside or out of
control. When you compare with Apotex, Apotex was clearly operating outside a
state of control ...”°°° Dr. Rosa’s reference to the earlier ‘discussion’ included his
previous oral testimony regarding medically necessary drugs for the US market
produced at the Boucherville facility: “... Drug Shortage [FDA] was extremely,
extremely concerned for this firm — for affecting the availability of product that

[was] manufactured by this facility.”°°°

The Tribunal notes that the temporary effect of the fire at the Boucherville facility
in March 2012 was not regarded by these three witnesses as material to the FDA’s
treatment of Sandoz. The Tribunal accepts this factual conclusion from the available

evidence in this arbitration.

The Tribunal returns to other factual and legal issues later below. At this stage, the
Tribunal briefly records the evidential difficulties encountered in this arbitration
regarding contemporary non-public documentation held by the FDA regarding

Sandoz and the Boucherville facility.

As regards the Claimants, by its procedural order dated 29 March 2013, the Tribunal
denied the Claimants’ request for certain document production relating to
Novartis/Sandoz on the ground of (inter alia) the Respondent’s “legal impediment”
because the Boucherville facility was still under investigation by the FDA (pursuant
to Article 9 of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration
2010).

As regards the Respondent, its counsel confirmed to the Tribunal at the Hearing that
the FDA was and remained precluded by US law from disclosing even to counsel
from the Respondent’s own State Department certain third-party information
relating to the Boucherville facility, still less to the Claimants (even on a
confidential basis protected by order of the Tribunal).*” This impediment was

disputed by the Claimants at the Hearing.*”*

The Tribunal notes that, at least as at 27 September 2013, the FDA’s investigation
of Boucherville facility, was still “ongoing”;*” and the Tribunal assumes from what
was stated by the Respondent’s counsel that this investigation remained materially
incomplete at the time of the Hearing. For these reasons, as with its earlier
procedural order, the Tribunal accepts, as a fact, the explanation tendered by the

Respondent for the paucity of material evidence and documentation from within the

*T TD6.1662, 1678-1679 and TD7.1761-1765, citing Section 301 of the Food and Drug Administration Act, the

PART VI - JURISDICTION: NAFTA ARTICLE 1101(1)

Introduction

This first principal issue addresses the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections under
NAFTA Article 1101(1) in regard to the claims made by Apotex-Holdings (for itself
and for Apotex-US) and by Apotex Inc. (subject to the assumption described

below).

NAFTA Article 1101(1) limits, as a matter of jurisdiction, the substantive
protections of NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven to a measure “adopted or maintained by a
Party relating to: (a) investors of another Party; (b) investments of investors of
another Party in the territory of the Party.” (The relevant text of NAFTA Article
1101(1) is set out in Part IV above).

It is necessary to address this jurisdictional provision within the context of
NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven and the Claimants’ substantive claims in this arbitration.
As recorded elsewhere, the only measure impugned by the Claimants in this
arbitration is the Import Alert of 28 August 2009. Accordingly, the Import Alert (as
adopted and maintained by the Respondent) must relate to the Claimants as
investors or to their investments in the territory of the USA within the meaning of

NAFTA Article 1101(1).

NAFTA Article 1101(1)

NAFTA Articles 1120 & 1121: It is common ground between the Parties that, as a
matter of jurisdiction, the Claimants have met the temporal and formal elements
required for their claims in this arbitration under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven for their

substantive claims under NAFTA Articles 1120(1)(b) and 1121.

NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1117: It is also common ground between the Parties, on
the admitted facts of this case (namely, that Apotex-Holdings indirectly owns and
controls Apotex-US via a wholly owned intermediary Canadian company, Aposhern
Inc.), that Apotex-Holdings (as a Canadian enterprise) is an “investor” within the

meaning of NAFTA Article 1116(1) in regard to Apotex-US; that Apotex-US is an

Part VI- Page 1 of 10

6.6.

6.7.

6.8.

“investment” of Apotex-Holdings within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139; and
that, as such, Apotex-US qualifies as an “investment of an investor of a Party” (i.e.

of Apotex-Holdings of Canada) within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1117(1).

It is disputed between the Parties whether Apotex Inc. (albeit also a Canadian
enterprise) is an “investor” under NAFTA Article 1116(1) with any “investment”
under NAFTA Article 1139. It is also disputed whether Apotex-Holdings is an
“investor” with any “investment” in Apotex Inc. under NAFTA Articles 1116(1)
and 1139. These disputes, regarding the legal significance of Apotex Inc.’s ANDAs,
are addressed separately in Part VII below. However, for present purposes in regard
to this issue under NAFTA Articles 1101(1) and 1139, it is convenient to assume in
regard to the ANDAs that Apotex Inc. is an “investor” with an “investment” in the
ANDAs and also that Apotex-Holdings is an “investor” with an indirect
“investment” in the ANDAs, both investments being “in the territory of’ the USA.

This assumption is subject to the Tribunal’s decisions in Part VII below.

(In earlier stages of this arbitration, Apotex Inc. appeared to assert other activities in
the USA which it contended were “investments” independent of its ANDAs;! but
these were superseded by the Claimants’ further pleaded case; and it is now clear
that none of these other activities forms part of the Claimants’ case, if they ever did.
In any event, in the Tribunal’s view, none of those other activities can qualify,
separately or collectively, as an “investment” of Apotex Inc. under NAFTA Article

1139(h) independently of the ANDAs.)

Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the present jurisdictional issue in this Part
VI turns upon the subject matter of the Parties’ dispute, namely the Respondent’s
Import Alert of 28 August 2009 under NAFTA Article 1101(1). As the Parties
asserting the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide their substantive claims, it is for the

Claimants to establish a positive answer to this issue.

NAFTA Article 1101(1): The Respondent objects to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal
to determine claims made by Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US) and

by Apotex Inc. on the ground that NAFTA Article 1101(1), with its phrase “relating

to”, requires as a threshold jurisdictional matter a legally significant connection
between the disputed measure and the investor and/or its investment. The
Respondent submits that the Import Alert did not relate to Apotex-Holdings or
Apotex Inc. as “investors” or to any “investments” in the territory of the USA.
(There is no dispute that the Import Alert was a “measure” adopted or maintained

by the Respondent.)

The Respondent relies upon the NAFTA first partial award in Methanex v USA in
support of its case that it is insufficient that the disputed measure somehow “affects”
the investor or its investment. In that arbitration, the disputed measure restricted the
use of MTBE as a gasoline additive; and the Canadian investor made methanol as a
component of MTBE, but it did not manufacture or sell MTBE itself. The tribunal
decided that Article 1101(1) required something more than the mere effect of a
measure and required a legally significant connection between the measure and the
investor and its alleged loss, an interpretation supported in that arbitration by the
three NAFTA Parties. The tribunal held: “If the threshold provided by Article
110(1) was merely one of ‘affecting’, as Methanex contends, it would be satisfied
wherever any economic impact was felt by an investor or an investment ... A
threshold which could be surmounted by an indeterminate class of investors making

a claim alleging loss is no threshold at all 8

This approach was subsequently followed in the NAFTA award in Bayview v
Mexico. That tribunal held: “The simple fact that an enterprise in one NAFTA State
is affected by measures taken in another NAFTA State is not sufficient to establish
the right of that enterprise to protection under NAFTA Chapter Eleven: it is the
relationship, the legally significant connection, with the State taking those measures
that establishes the right to protection, not the bare fact that the enterprise is affected

by the measures.”*

In response, the Claimants rely upon the NAFTA award in Cargill v Mexico, where
the NAFTA tribunal concluded that the disputed measure, a Mexican legal

requirement for an import permit, prevented the US claimant investor’s goods from

crossing the border into Mexico and thereby directly affected (adversely) its
investment in Mexico, namely the business of its Mexican subsidiary. This tribunal
found: “The import permit requirement not only had an immediate and direct effect
on the business of Cargill de Mexico [i.e. the claimant’s investment] but also
constituted a legal impediment to carrying on the business of Cargill de Mexico in
sourcing HFCS [high fructose corn syrup] in the United States and re-selling it in

Mexico.”*

The Respondent disputes the application to the present case of the decision in
Cargill. In particular, it points to the Cargill tribunal’s finding that the import
permit requirement constituted a legal impediment to the Mexican subsidiary’s
operations; whereas there was no such legal impediment for Apotex-US from the
Import Alert: Apotex-US could still sell and did sell generic drugs in the USA,
obtained from other manufacturers (including Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical of Japan

and GSK).°

The Tribunal does not consider that the Cargill tribunal was seeking to apply a
different legal interpretation of NAFTA Article 1101(1) from the two tribunals in
Methanex and Bayview. Moreover, in the Tribunal’s view, there is in the present
case no material difference between the Parties in their legal interpretation of the
relevant wording in NAFTA Article 1101(1), applying the customary rules of
interpretation codified in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties. The Parties jointly agree that something more than a mere “effect” from
the measure is required to overcome the jurisdictional threshold in NAFTA Article
1101(1). Their dispute derives from their different applications of that interpretation
to the relevant facts and circumstances of this case, as regards Apotex-US, Apotex

Inc. and Apotex-Holdings. It is convenient to consider each of these in turn.

Apotex-US

As to the facts relevant to Apotex-US, the Claimants submit that the Import Alert
clearly related to Apotex-US: it was the named consignee of the products detained

at the Canada-US border as a result of the Import Alert; the FDA district office that

intercepted these products expressly identified Apotex-US as the named party
prevented from receiving those products, again as a result of the Import Alert; and
Apotex-US was directly impacted by the Import Alert, losing sales and market
shares because Apotex-US could no longer supply products manufactured by
Apotex Inc. at its two facilities which Apotex-US was marketing for sale and was

also contractually obliged to sell in the USA.”

As to the relevant facts, the Respondent makes four principal points. First, the
Import Alert concerned products manufactured by Apotex Inc. and not Apotex-US;
and there is no relationship of ownership or control between Apotex Inc. and
Apotex—US. Second, the Import Alert was not applied to Apotex-US: the Import
Alert named Apotex Inc. as the affected party; and its products from its two
facilities were subject to detention upon export to the USA (i.e. not Apotex-US).
Third, the Import Alert affected all US distributors of Apotex Inc.’s products from
its two facilities, said to number 82 distributors and 113 wholesale dealers (i.e. not
limited to Apotex-US). Fourth, the Import Alert did not affect the business of
Apotex-US in marketing and selling generic drugs obtained from suppliers other

than products manufactured at Apotex Inc.’s two facilities.*

The Respondent further submits that the Import Alert had only a single function: to
apprise the FDA’s district offices, as a matter of information and guidance, that
Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke and Signet facilities were not cGMP compliant and that
products from these two facilities could therefore be detained without physical
examination (DWPE) at the US border. Under US law, so the Respondent submits,
the authority of an FDA district office to detain products offered for import does not

depend upon any import alert.”

To rebut this submission, the Claimants relied upon the US Federal Court judgment
in Bellarno v FDA (1988).!° The Claimants submitted that the Court there decided
that import alerts constituted an automatic detention of the specified products
offered for import into the USA, legally effective on both the FDA and the importer;

and that the Court rejected the FDA’s argument that import alerts were a mere

interpretative rule or a general statement of policy, leaving US border officers to
decide for themselves whether or not to detain shipments."! In turn, the Respondent
demonstrated that, after this decision, the FDA had materially amended the wording
of its import alerts to make clear that these did not call for automatic detention, as is
apparent from the Import Alert here at issue with its revisions dating from 17
August 2007 (with no reference to “automatic detention”).! The Claimants

dismissed this change in wording as mere “window-dressing.” >

The Tribunal notes that the wording of the import alert considered in Bellarno was
only one of several factors that led the Court to its conclusion. The Tribunal is not
persuaded that this judgment can be so easily distinguished as the Respondent
submitted as regards the Import Alert in this case. However, it is unnecessary to
decide the point. What matters for present purposes is not the status of the Import
Alert under US law, but its factual significance for the application of the phrase

“relating to” in NAFTA Article 1101(1).

Whatever the precise legal effect of the Import Alert’s wording under US law, it is a
fact that the detention of Apotex Inc.’s products began on 30 August 2009, only two
days after the Import Alert of 28 August 2009; and that such detention did not begin
earlier with the FDA inspectors’ determinations that the Etobicoke and Signet
facilities were non-cGMP compliant (on 19 December 2008 and 14 August 2009) or
with the FDA’s Etobicoke warning letter of 25 June 2009. There is therefore a
strong temporal relationship between the Import Alert and its effect upon Apotex-
US. Further, within the FDA itself, it is clear that the Import Alert was intended to
prevent products from Apotex Inc.’s two facilities being imported into the USA, not
achievable with the FDA’s earlier determinations and warning letter: see the FDA’s
internal memorandum dated 20 August 2009 considered in Part III above. There is
therefore at least a strong subjective relationship between the Import Alert and the

detention at the US border of shipments consigned by Apotex Inc. to Apotex-US.

However, as explained further below, the Tribunal thinks it inappropriate to

introduce within NAFTA Article 1101(1) a legal test of causation applicable under

Chapter Eleven’s substantive provisions for the merits of the Claimants’ claims. For
jurisdictional purposes, the threshold is necessarily different under NAFTA Article

1101(1), given the ordinary meaning of the connecting phrase “relating to.”

For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal decides that the Import Alert did relate
to Apotex-US within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1101(1).

The Tribunal considers that the Import Alert applied, as a fact, to Apotex-US as the
consignee of Apotex Inc.’s products and as Apotex Inc.’s co-contracting party. The
direct and immediate effect of the Import Alert was imposed not only upon Apotex
Inc. but also upon Apotex-US, as seller/shipper and buyer/consignee respectively.
Section 801 of the Act (from which the practice of import alerts derives) specifically
refers to both “owner or consignee”, as do the related provisions (relating to notices
of detention) in the FDA Imports and Exports Rules (21 CFR § 1.94) and the FDA’s
Regulatory Procedures Manual (2011, at 9-8). Further, the FDA’s sample Notice of
FDA Action in this case, regarding the “hold” on Apotex Inc.’s products, expressly

named Apotex-US with its Florida address as “Consignee.”

(This factual analysis
does not depend upon the location of sales made between Apotex Inc. and Apotex-

US, nor the place where legal title passed in products sold between them).

In the Tribunal’s view, the relevant circumstances of the present case, whilst not
identical, are materially similar to those in Cargill but materially different from
those in Methanex (as considered in the first partial award). The immediate effect of
the Import Alert made it impossible for Apotex-US legally to receive contracted
products from Apotex Inc.’s two facilities at Etobicoke and Signet; and, as a direct
result, Apotex-US was prevented from carrying on that major part of its business of
sourcing those products from Apotex Inc.’s two facilities for re-sale in the USA. In
Cargill, the tribunal held that the requirement for an import permit had an
immediate and direct effect on the business of the Mexican company and
constituted a legal impediment to the carrying on of that company’s business in
sourcing HFCS in the USA for re-sale in Mexico, with the result that the threshold
gateway in NAFTA Article 1101(1) was there met by the claimant investor. Further,
the commercial relationship between Apotex Inc. and Apotex-US was not fleeting

or minimal as at August 2009: the Import Alert interrupted an established long term

4 For example, see the FDA Notice | at p. 5, dated 2 September 2009 (Exhibit R-044).

6.25.

6.26.

6.27.

relationship with Apotex Inc. on which Apotex-US depended for a significant

proportion of its sales in the USA.

All these circumstances distinguish Methanex, where the potential class of investors
indirectly affected by the dispute measure was indeterminate and unknown. In the
present case, the Import Alert more than affected, uniquely, both Apotex Inc. and
Apotex-US; and of all US recipients of Apotex Inc.’s products, Apotex-US was by
far the enterprise most immediately, most directly and most adversely affected by
the Import Alert. In the Tribunal’s view, that suffices to satisfy the Claimant’s

relationship with the Import Alert within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1101(1).

In the Tribunal’s view, it is therefore no answer for the Respondent to point to other
shipments by Apotex Inc. which, by virtue of the Import Alert, also could not be
made to consignees or buyers other than Apotex-US. Compared to Apotex-US, the
effect on such other consignees and buyers was minimal. It is also no answer for the
Respondent to show (as was indeed the fact) that Apotex-US could source and resell
products from other manufacturers and suppliers during the two-year period in
question. The latter could, of course, affect issues of liability and would affect
questions of quantum; but none of these answers provides any warrant for
interpreting NAFTA Article 1101(1) so narrowly as to require Apotex-US to be the
exclusive purchaser of all Apotex Inc.’s products for the USA or Apotex Inc. to be

Apotex-US’s sole supplier in the USA.

Equally, in the Tribunal’s view, it is no answer for the Respondent to invoke
different theories as to the legal cause of loss to Apotex-US, other than the Import
Alert. That issue may likewise affect issues of liability and quantum; but, again,
there is no reason for requiring NAFTA Article 1101(1) to be so narrowly
interpreted as to require only a claimant with a successful case on causation to pass
through its threshold gateway; or to establish that the disputed measure is the only

relevant possible measure.

Lastly, as submitted by the Claimants, there is a practical problem in seeking to
interpret and apply the phrase “relating to” as a narrow threshold jurisdictional issue
without any regard to the substantive NAFTA provisions invoked by a claimant

investor in the particular case. The Claimants contend that, if the connection

Part VI- Page 8 of 10

6.28.

6.29.

6.30.

between the measure and the investment that is required to establish a breach of a
substantive provision in a particular case is present, it is difficult to conclude that
such connection could have no legal significance under NAFTA Article 1101(1) as
a jurisdictional matter. Here, in this case, so the Claimants contend, the Import Alert
has a sufficient connection with the alleged breaches of NAFTA Articles 1102,
1103 and 1105 and, hence, a sufficient legal connection has been established by the

Claimants under NAFTA Article 1101(1) for jurisdictional purposes. '°

The Tribunal accepts the result of the Claimants’ analysis for this case; but it may
go too far for other cases where there is no sufficient connection between the
disputed measure and the investment. In this case, there is clearly more than a
sufficient connection. Were the result otherwise (as the Claimants contended), it
could mean that a claimant investor might have a legitimate claim for breach of a
substantive NAFTA provision, made in good faith and upon reasonable grounds,
without any remedy under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven. In the Tribunal’s view, there
is no reason to interpret or apply NAFTA Article 1101(1) as an unduly narrow
gateway to arbitral justice under NAFTA’s substantive provisions under Chapter
Eleven. None of the legal materials cited by the Parties support such a restrictive
interpretation of the phrase “relating to” in NAFTA Article 1101(1). Accordingly, if
and to the extent that the Respondent was arguing otherwise in this arbitration,'® the

Tribunal would reject such argument.

Apotex Inc.

Apotex Inc.: The Claimants contend that the Import Alert specifically named
Apotex Inc. as the affected party; and that the Import Alert had the direct effect of
rendering Apotex Inc.’s ANDAs useless, during a period of almost two years, for
the purpose for which Apotex Inc. had acquired them: i.e. for marketing its products

covered by the ANDAs in the USA."

The Tribunal repeats its decisions above relating to the factual significance and

effect of the Import Alert.

Accordingly, subject to the assumption made above, the Tribunal accepts that the
Import Alert “related to” Apotex Inc. and its ANDAs within the meaning of
NAFTA Article 1101(1). This is, of course, insufficient for Apotex Inc. to prevail as
a matter of jurisdiction, being also dependent on the issue next considered in Part

VII below.

Apotex-Holdings

Apotex-Holdings: The Claimants submit that, because Apotex-Holdings is the
ultimate owner of Apotex-US and Apotex Inc. and their investments, the Import

Alert relates also to Apotex-Holdings and its indirect investments. 18

It is possible to address this submission succinctly, given that jurisdiction over all
claims made by Apotex-Holdings necessarily depends upon the issues relating to

Apotex-US and Apotex Inc. respectively.

Accordingly, for the reasons set out above, the Tribunal decides that it has
jurisdiction over the claims made by Apotex-Holdings under NAFTA Articles 1116
and 1117 (for itself and for Apotex-US). As regards jurisdiction over Apotex-
Holdings’ claims under NAFTA Article 1116 relating to Apotex Inc.’s ANDAs, the

Tribunal’s decision depends the issue next addressed in Part VII below.

PART VII - RES JUDICATA: JURISDICTION AND NAFTA ARTICLE 1139

Introduction

The Tribunal here addresses the second principal issue, namely the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections in regard to the claims made by Apotex Inc. and Apotex-
Holdings as investors in regard to the ANDAs as investments. As already indicated,
this issue depends upon the interpretation of the ANDAs as an “investment” under
NAFTA Article 1139 raising in turn the issue of Apotex Inc. and Apotex-Holdings
as investors with investments, forming part of the threshold requirements as to

jurisdiction contained in NAFTA Article 1101(1) (with Article 1116).

However, this issue first raises the question whether and to what extent the
Respondent can invoke the doctrine of res judicata to preclude the Claimants from
providing any positive answer to this issue as a matter of jurisdiction, given the
Apotex I & II Award made between Apotex Inc. and the Respondent. Although that
Award identifies the Respondent as “the Government of the United States of
America”, it is common ground between the Parties that the Respondent is a party
or “privy” to the Award.' It is also common ground that Apotex-Holdings is not a
named party to that Award or the arbitration in which that Award was made. The
position of Apotex-Holdings must therefore be considered separately from Apotex
Inc., on the basis of the limited concession made by Apotex-Holdings as a “privy”,

which is described later below.

The Apotex I & Il Award was made under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven and the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976, with its place of arbitration stated to be New
York, New York, USA. The Tribunal has only been shown the redacted version of
this Award; but nothing material to this arbitration has been withheld from the
Tribunal by Apotex Inc. or the Respondent. Indeed, only a part of the Apotex I & II
Award is relevant to the Parties’ submissions on res judicata; and, for ease of
reference below, the relevant (redacted) passages of the Award are set out as an

NAFTA Article 1136(1)

The Parties’ respective submissions begin with NAFTA Article 1136(1). It
provides: “An award made by a Tribunal shall have no binding force except
between the disputing parties and in respect of the particular case.” The Claimants
interpret this provision to mean that the legal effects of the Apotex I & II Award are
wholly confined to that particular arbitration and can have no binding force in this
different arbitration. Thus, according to the Claimants, there can be no possible res
judicata effect upon the Claimants’ claims in the present case. The Respondent

disagrees.

The Tribunal does not share the Claimants’ interpretation of NAFTA Article
1136(1).

In the Tribunal’s view, NAFTA Article 1136(1) closely parallels, and appears to be
based upon, Article 59 of the Statute of the International Court of Justice (“ICJ’).
Article 59 provides that: “The decision of the Court has no binding force except
between the parties and in respect of that particular case.” This text repeats verbatim
Article 59 of the earlier Statute of the Permanent Court of International Justice
(“PCIJ”). For both international courts (the ICJ and the PCIJ), the text consistently
has been understood to mean that the court has no rule of stare decisis. Neither
international court has interpreted the provision to bar the operation of res judicata.
Moreover, as described below, both international courts have applied the doctrine of

res judicata.

Professor Rosenne writes that, for the ICJ, “[t]he effect of Article 59 is that the
Statute itself excludes the doctrine of stare decisis, the binding force of a judicial
decision as a law-creating precedent.” Addressing Article 59’s role in the PCIJ’s
Statute, Judge Hudson similarly observes that “Article 59 ... clearly precludes the
Court from adopting any doctrine similar to the Anglo-American doctrine of stare
decisis.”* However, “[t]he elimination of the possibility of the Court’s developing a
doctrine of stare decisis does not preclude it from applying the general principle of

res judicata. Indeed, the application of that principle seems to be required by Article

59 of the Statute, for otherwise a decision of the Court would not be binding on the

parties.”*

Other learned commentators have also understood NAFTA Article 1136(1) in the
same sense as Article 59 of the ICJ and PCIJ Statutes, as precluding a rule of
binding precedent. In the scholarly work edited by Ms. Kinnear (et al), it is
observed: “Article 1136(1) makes clear that the rule of stare decisis does not apply

to awards rendered under Chapter wa?

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that NAFTA Article 1136(1) does not bar the
Respondent in this arbitration from invoking the doctrine of res judicata on the
basis of the Apotex I & II Award, where applicable. If the position were otherwise,
the Claimants’ submission would effectively mean that it could re-litigate the same
claims over and over again in different arbitrations against the same party, which
would be an absurd result for an arbitral procedure intended to produce finality with

a legally binding decision.

Res Judicata in International Law

The Parties agree that the Tribunal, under NAFTA Article 1131, “shall decide the
issues in dispute in accordance with this Agreement [NAFTA] and applicable rules

of international law.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the doctrine of res judicata is a general principle of law and
is thus an applicable rule of international law within the meaning of NAFTA Article
1131. In its Advisory Opinion of 13 July 1954, the ICJ affirmed that “[a]ccording to
a well-established and generally recognized principle of law, a judgment rendered
by ... a judicial body [such as the U.N. Administrative Tribunal] is res judicata and

has binding force between the parties to the dispute.”®

Accordingly, Professor Bin
Cheng writes, “[t]here seems little, if indeed any, question as to res judicata being a

general principle of law or as to its applicability in international judicial

oT

proceedings.” As later confirmed in the Amco award, “The principle of res judicata

is a general principle of law.”®

712. The doctrine of res judicata defines the binding effect of a prior final determination
made by a competent tribunal. In Amco, the tribunal decided: “The general
principle, announced in numerous cases is that a right, question, or fact distinctly
put in issue and distinctly determined by a court of competent jurisdiction as a
ground of recovery, cannot be disputed.”? Thus, according to Professor Bin Cheng,
“To]nce a case has been decided by a valid and final judgment, the same issue may

not be disputed again between the same parties, as long as that judgment stands.” !°

7.13. The doctrine of res judicata is often described as operating in international
proceedings where three conditions establish the congruence of the matters
previously determined and those currently at issue. Legal scholars often refer to
Judge Anzilotti’s formulation of this triple identity test in his dissent in the PCIJ
case of Chorzéw Factory (Interpretation). Judge Anzilotti there referred to: “the
three traditional elements for identification, persona, petitum, causa petendi, for it is
clear that ‘that particular case’ (Je cas qui a été décidé) covers both the object and
the grounds of the claim.”!! The judgment of the majority had there accorded res
judicata to the passage in the Court’s earlier declaratory judgment setting out the

grounds or ‘essential conditions’ on which that decision was based.'?

7.14. No issue arises in the present case regarding persona: Apotex Inc. and the
Respondent are named parties to the Apotex I & II Award (the position of Apotex-
Holdings as a privy, albeit not a named party, is considered separately below).
Professors Schreuer and Reinisch explain the Latin legal terms petitum and causa

petendi, as follows: “[i]dentical ‘object’ (petitum) means that the same type of relief

same legal arguments are relied upon in different proceedings.”"?

TAS. Whilst the triple identity test is often referred to in describing the requirements for
res judicata to operate, certain international tribunals and scholars have
questioned its division between petitum and causa petendi; and many cases have
used a simpler analysis.'° The British-U.S. Claims Arbitral Tribunal saw the
doctrine as involving only two elements: “res judicata applies only where there is
identity of the parties and of the question at issue.”'® The Pious Fund tribunal
(applying res judicata in the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s first case and viewed

as “[t]he leading early case”!”

) also applied a two-part test, emphasising that “there
are not only the same parties to the suit, but also the same subject-matter that was

judged” in a prior arbitral award. 1s

7.16. Professor Cheng questions the division between petitum and causa petendi,
observing that “an examination of international decisions ... throws some doubt
about the accuracy of this sub-division, especially in border-line cases,”!°

Professors Schreuer and Reinisch point out that “[i]international tribunals have ...

been aware of the risk that if they use too restrictive criteria of ‘object’ and

‘grounds’, the doctrine of res judicata would rarely apply: if only an exactly

identical relief sought (object) based on exactly the same legal arguments (grounds)

in a second case would be precluded as a result of res judicata, then litigants could

easily evade this by slightly modifying either the relief requested or the grounds

relied upon.” Professor Dodge voices a similar concern, although he indicates (as
do Professors Schreuer and Reinisch) that tribunals have not allowed “claim

splitting” by claimants seeking to avoid the preclusive effects of prior awards.”!

TAT. The Claimants and the Respondent disagree on the scope of res judicata’s effect in
international law. The Parties agree that the provisions of the dispositif, or operative
part, of a prior judgment or award have res judicata effect. They disagree whether
res judicata in international law includes the broader concept of or akin to issue
estoppel, the principle that a party in subsequent proceedings cannot contradict an
issue of fact or law not reflected in the dispositif if it has already been distinctly
raised and finally decided in earlier proceedings between the same parties (or their

privies). The Claimants submit it does not; whereas the Respondent says it does.

7.18. It is clear that past international tribunals have applied forms of issue estoppel,
without necessarily using the term. Umpire Plumley’s award in Orinoco Steamship
found that “every matter and point distinctly in issue ... and which was directly
passed upon and determined in said decree, and which was its ground and basis, is
confirmed by said judgment, and the claimants ... are forever estopped from

asserting any right or claim based in any part upon any fact actually and directly

922

involved in the said decree. In Professor Lowe’s opinion, the tribunal in the

23

resubmitted Amco case~ “clearly applied the principle of issue estoppel to the

determination of specific facts and of the legal characterisations of facts by the

previous tribunal.” Most recently, the ICSID tribunal in Grynberg v. Grenada™>

applied issue estoppel (albeit describing it as “collateral estoppel”~”) to foreclose the

°6 Although the Grynberg Award referred to the principle as “collateral estoppel”, the US legal concept of
“collateral estoppel” is broader, permitting non-parties (or privies) to a prior litigation to invoke the doctrine to
preclude re-litigation of an issue previously decided. That broader principle is not an issue in the present case, as
the Respondent recognised [TD4.1190].

claimants’ efforts to re-open issues decided in an award made in a prior ICSID

spe
arbitration.””

In Grynberg v. Grenada, the award in the first ICSID arbitration had dismissed the
claims against Grenada as the respondent made by a Texan company (RSM)
alleging contractual breaches of a concession agreement. In the second ICSID
arbitration, RSM and its three shareholders alleged breaches by the same respondent
of the bilateral investment treaty between the USA and Grenada. On the face of it,
the triple identity test was not satisfied as regards these three shareholders as
persona, nor the petitum or causa petendi as regards both RSM and the
shareholders. Yet, the second arbitration tribunal summarily dismissed all claims
made by these four claimants as being “manifestly without legal merit” under

ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(5), together with costs orders adverse to the claimants.

In so doing, the second tribunal accepted the respondent’s submission of issue
estoppel arising from the first award, to the effect that the legal and factual
contentions on which the new claims depended had already been fully litigated in
the first ICSID arbitration.”* Applying the doctrine to all four claimants as “privies”
as a general principle of law recognised in Amco v Indonesia” and the Orinoco
case, the second ICSID tribunal accepted that “a finding concerning a right,
question or fact may not be re-litigated (and, thus, is binding on a subsequent
tribunal), if, in a prior proceeding: (a) it was distinctly put in issue; (b) the court or
tribunal actually decided it; and (c) the resolution of the question was necessary to
resolving the claims before that court or tribunal.”*° Applying these principles, the
tribunal concluded: “that an essential predicate to the success of each of Claimants’
claims is an ability for the Tribunal to re-litigate and decide in Claimants’ favour
conclusions of fact or law concerning the parties’ contractual rights that have

already distinctly been put in issue and distinctly determined by the Prior Tribunal”;

and having determined that ability adversely to the claimants, the tribunal decided

that each of their claims was manifestly without legal merit.*!

The Claimants denied the relevance of the Grynberg award to the present case,
contending that the parties there had agreed to the application of collateral estoppel
(issue estoppel) under the governing law.” In the Tribunal’s view, this submission
is incorrect.*? The parties strongly disputed its application to their case; but,
significantly, there was no dispute as its requirements as a general principle of

international law.

The Claimants also contend that Orinoco Steamship (and presumably other like
authorities™*) do not correctly reflect res judicata under international law. In their
submission, the case reflected Umpire Plumley’s common law orientation, as
evidenced by his reliance on a decision of the US Supreme Court decision as legal
authority for the cited principle.*° The Claimants contend that notions of issue
estoppel found in common law systems are not found in civil law systems, which
typically (so the Claimants submit) limit res judicata effects to matters addressed in
the dispositif of an award or judgment.*° Given this significant difference in
approach between two major systems of law, the Claimants contend that issue
estoppel cannot be said to be an aspect of res judicata as a general principle of law

“recognised by civilized nations.”

The Tribunal recognises that historical differences as to issue estoppel have existed
and, to a lesser extent, still exist in national laws between certain common law and
certain civil law systems. As the ILA Interim Report makes clear, however, there is
no sharp divide between these two legal systems.” It is also clear that international
courts and tribunals have regularly examined under international law a_ prior
tribunal’s reasoning, and the arguments it considered, in determining the scope, and

thus the preclusive effect, of the prior award’s operative part. The first international

tribunal’s analysis and reasoning thus often play a significant role before the second

international tribunal in determining the res judicata effect of the earlier award.

This is illustrated in the Pious Fund arbitration, where the tribunal held that an
umpire’s award in a prior mixed claims commission proceeding had res judicata
effect, and obliged Mexico to pay certain annuities to the USA on behalf of the
Archbishop of San Francisco and the Bishop of Monterey. The tribunal rejected
Mexico’s contention that only the amount specified in the prior award had res
judicata effect, instead considering that it must consider the earlier award in its
entirety to determine the res judicata effect of its dispositif: “Considering that all the
parts of a judgment or a decree concerning the points debated in the dispute
enlighten and mutually supplement each other, and that they all serve to render
precise the meaning and bearing of the dispositif (the decisory part of the judgment),
to determine the points upon which there is res judicata and which therefore cannot

be put in question.”**

The Permanent Court of International Justice was of like mind in Advisory Opinion
No. 11: “It is perfectly true that all the parts of a judgment concerning the points in
dispute explain and complete each other and are to be taken into account in order to
determine the precise meaning and scope of the operative portion. This is clearly
stated in the award of the Permanent Court of Arbitration of October 14th, 1902,
concerning the Pious Fund of the Californias ... The Court agrees with this

statement.”*?

In his dissent in Chorz6w Factory, Judge Anzilotti was of the view that “the binding
effect attaches only to the operative part of the judgment and not to the statement of
reasons.” However, he added: “[w]Jhen I say that only the terms of a judgment are
binding, I do not mean that only what is actually written in the operative part
constitutes the Court’s decision. On the contrary, it is certain that it is almost always
necessary to refer to the statement of reasons to understand clearly the operative part

and above all to ascertain the causa petendi.”*°

7.27.

7.28.

7.29.

The Channel Arbitration tribunal similarly observed that while res judicata
“attaches in principle only to the provisions of” the dispositif, “it is equally clear
that, having regard to the close links that exist between the reasoning of a decision
and the provisions of its dispositif, recourse may in principle be had to the reasoning

in order to elucidate the meaning and scope of the dispositif.”"'

The International Court of Justice also looks to the parties’ arguments and
submissions to determine the legal effect of prior judgments. As Professor Rosenne
observes, “[t]he relevance of whether a question was argued between the parties
might arise ... if it is necessary to determine the scope of the res judicata ... In the
Asylum case ... the problem was ... of the scope of the binding force of the decision.
The res judicata does not derive from the operative clause of the judgment, which
confined itself to stating which submissions of the parties were rejected or accepted
and to what extent, but from the reasons in point of law given by the Court.”
Accordingly, cases such as Asylum’® and Corfu Channel “bring into sharp relief
the delayed-action effect attaching to the written and oral pleadings. In the last
analysis the scope of res judicata can only be determined by reference to the

pleadings in general, and to the parties’ submissions in particular."

The jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is to like effect. For the
ECJ (applying the laws of the European Union and international law), the legal
effect of a decision by the ECJ and other EU institutions is not to be limited to the
wording of the operative part. In Asteris & Greece v. Commission, the ECJ noted
that the EU institution was required to have regard not only to the operative part of
the decision but also to the motifs which led to that decision in order to determine
the former’s exact meaning.*° In Commission v. BASF,” the ECJ noted that: “the
operative part of such a decision can be understood, and its full effect ascertained,

only in the light of the statement of reasons”; and that a decision’s dispositif and

motifs constituted “an indivisible whole.” In Deggendorf v. Commission, the ECJ
held that: “the operative part of an act is indissociably linked to the statement of
reasons for it, so that, when it has to be interpreted, account must be taken of the

reasons which led to its adoption.”

Thus, where there is a question regarding the extent of a prior decision or award’s
res judicata effect, international tribunals regularly look to the prior tribunal’s
reasons and indeed also to the parties’ arguments, in order to determine the scope of

what was finally decided in that earlier proceeding.

In Professor Rosenne’s opinion, in examining a prior tribunal’s reasoning and the
arguments it considered, international tribunals have not drawn the distinctions
between ratio decidendi and obiter dicta “which is an essential element of the
common-law rule of the binding force of judicial precedents (stare decisis).”*° For
the International Court of Justice, Professor Rosenne observes, “ [t]he reasons in
point of law of Article 95 ... of the Rules of Court do not contemplate such a finely
drawn distinction.”*° As in the Pious Fund arbitration, tribunals have considered
that “all the parts of the judgment or the decree concerning the points debated in the

litigation enlighten and mutually supplement each other.”*!

It would be possible to cite many further legal materials in support of the legal
analysis made above; but it would serve no purpose here to prolong what is already
a lengthy analysis. However, the Tribunal is comforted to see its approach above
confirmed by the ICJ’s recent Judgment of 11 November 2013 in Cambodia v
Thailand. In that Judgment, albeit not directly concerned with the doctrine of res
judicata, the ICJ considered in regard to an earlier judgment of 1962 the scope of
Article 60 of the ICJ’s Statute, which provides: “The judgment is final and without
appeal. In the event of dispute as to the meaning or scope of the judgment, the Court
shall construe it upon the request of any party.” In accordance with the ICJ’s

jurisprudence, a dispute under Article 60 must relate to the operative part of the

judgment in question and cannot concern the reasons for the judgment except in so
far as these are inseparable from the operative part. The ICJ nonetheless held
under Article 60 that the “scope of the operative part of a judgment of the Court is
necessarily bound up with the scope of the dispute before the Court.” The
Tribunal concludes from this Judgment that even with the restrictive language of
Article 60, the ICJ is not barred from interpreting the operative part of a judgment

by reference to its reasons for that judgment.

Res Judicata under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules

The Apotex I & II Award was made under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976
forming part of the arbitration agreement between the parties to that arbitration.
Under Article 32(2) of the UNCITRAL Rules, an award “shall be final and binding
on the parties”, including an award made in the exercise of the tribunal’s power to
decide upon its own jurisdiction. Under Article 32(3) of the UNCITRAL Rules, an
award “shall state the reasons upon which the award is based.” Accordingly, as an
award containing reasons under Article 32 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the Apotex I
& II Award (with its reasons) was and remains final and binding upon Apotex Inc.

and the Respondent, as agreed by those Parties.

The Respondent submitted at the Hearing that the combined effect of Articles 32(2)
and 32(3) means that the reasons in the Apotex I and II Award have effect as res
judicata as between the Parties to this arbitration, just as much as its operative part:
“... This is because the purpose of an Award is to decide the Parties’ dispute for all

time, both as to the whole and as to its constituent parts.”*°

The Tribunal is minded to accept this submission as a matter of legal logic; but, for
the purpose of deciding this issue, it is unnecessary to apply it here in full. Given the
status of both the operative part and the reasons in the Apotex I & II Award under
Article 32 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal concludes that those
relevant reasons can be read together with the operative part for the purpose of
applying the doctrine of res judicata in this arbitration, similarly to the position

under international law. It is not necessary in this case to read the reasons

independently from the operative part (as the Respondent submits); but it would
clearly be impermissible for this Tribunal to read the operative part independently in

isolation from its relevant reasons under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules.

The Tribunal has not addressed separately the legal status under New York law (as
the /ex loci arbitri) of the reasons or the operative part of the Apotex I & II Award.
In the Tribunal’s view, if and to the extent relevant, the effect of New York law
does not materially change or add to the analysis made above. It is not disputed that
the Apotex I & II Award (with its reasons) is final and binding under New York
law; nor has Apotex Inc. sought to challenge that Award before the New York

courts (or elsewhere).

Summary as to the Res Judicata Doctrine

Applying NAFTA Article 1131(1), the rules of international law and_ the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, the Tribunal concludes that the Apotex I & II
Award, with its relevant reasons, operates in this arbitration as res judicata as
regards both named parties to that arbitration, namely Apotex Inc. and the
Respondent. It remains to be considered in what manner it operates in regard to the

specific claims made by Apotex Inc. in this arbitration.

As regards Apotex-Holdings, the Claimants agreed at the Hearing that Apotex-
Holdings, for the purpose of res judicata, should be identified as a “privy” to the
Apotex I and II Award: “... having reviewed the RSM versus Grenada decision, the
second one, Apotex would agree that privies are bound to the same extent as the
Party with which they stand in privity. So we would accept that Apotex Holdings
could not bring the claim asserted and decided in the Apotex [I and ] II case 296
In other words, the two named Claimants in this arbitration stand in similar shoes,
as regards the effect of res judicata resulting from the Apotex I and II Award,
notwithstanding the fact that only one of them was a named party to the Apotex I

and II Award.

However, Apotex-Holding’s shoes are only similar and not the same. As the
Claimants made clear towards the end of the Hearing, in answer to the Tribunal’s

Question A2: “... there is a distinction between derivative claims made on behalf of

°° TD3.542. See also TD3.544.

a company and claims made directly by a shareholder on its own behalf. In this
arbitration, Apotex Holdings brings a claim in its own right and in its own name. It
is different from the claim made by Apotex-Canada [Apotex Inc.]. Apotex Holdings
is bound by the Apotex I and II Award only to the extent that it addresses Apotex-
Canada as the investor and holder of the two tentatively approved ANDAs at

issue.”*”

In the Tribunal’s view, independently from the concession (rightly) made by
Apotex-Holdings at the Hearing, Apotex-Holdings is a “privy” with Apotex-US,
albeit not a named party in the Apotex I & II arbitration. Its relevant claims in this
arbitration, albeit made in its own right and in its own name, depend upon Apotex
Inc.’s ANDAs as investments under NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139; and if these
are not investments, Apotex-Holdings cannot bring such claims before this Tribunal

as a matter of jurisdiction.

The Application of Res Judicata

It is self-evident that the “Operative Order” in Paragraph 358 of the Apotex I & II
Award (pages 118-119) does not, read strictly in isolation by itself, address the
Claimants’ specific claims in this arbitration. That operative part merely records, in
Paragraph 358(a), that Apotex Inc. “does not qualify as an ‘investor’, who has made
an ‘investment’ in the U.S., for the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1116 and 1139,
and accordingly both the Sertraline and Pravastatin Claims are hereby dismissed in
their entirety, on the basis that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in relation thereto.”
The Claimants in this arbitration make no similar claims regarding Sertraline and

Pravastatin.

However, in this Tribunal’s view, that operative part as a “dispositif’ can and
should be read with the relevant “motifs” or reasons for that operative part, as
decided above. Hence, the Tribunal concludes, for the purpose of res judicata, that
Paragraph 358(a) of the operative part is to be applied together with the reasons
applicable to that paragraph, namely the relevant passages in Paragraphs 177 to 246
of the Apotex I & II Award (pages 55 to 78). As indicated above, for ease of

reference and given their significance, these paragraphs are reproduced in full from

the redacted public version of the Apotex I & II Award in the Annex to this Part
VII. It is nonetheless useful briefly to summarise the tribunal’s approach in these

parts of the Apotex I & II Award.

First, the tribunal addresses the issue whether activities surrounding ANDAs qualify
as ‘investments’ under NAFTA Article 1139, as there submitted by Apotex Inc. and
there disputed by the Respondent: see Paragraphs 177ff. For several reasons, the

tribunal rejects Apotex Inc.’s submissions: see Paragraphs 178, 186ff & 225.

Second, the tribunal addresses the issue whether ANDAs qualify as ‘intangible
property’ under NAFTA Article 1139(g) in Paragraphs 196ff. For several reasons,
the tribunal rejects Apotex Inc.’s submissions: see Paragraphs 178, 206ff & 225. In
Paragraphs 206 and 208, the tribunal equates Apotex Inc. to “a mere exporter of
goods into the United States” and decides that “ ... property is not an ‘investment’
if, as here, it merely supports cross-border sales.” In Paragraph 217, the tribunal
states (inter alia): “... The ANDA was thus a requirement in order to conduct an
export business. If there had been no ANDA process, the underlying business could
not be said to be an ‘investment’ in the U.S. The fact that an ANDA was required
does not change the nature of the business.” The tribunal concludes, in Paragraph
225: “Thus, neither Apotex’s ANDAs, nor its activities in Canada, nor the costs
incurred there in meeting the requirements of the U.S. regulatory regime for

exporting its goods, are ‘investments’ in the United States.”

Third, the tribunal addresses the issue whether Apotex Inc.’s commitment of capital
and resources towards ANDAs could constitute an ‘investment’ under NAFTA
Article 1139(h) in Paragraphs 226ff. The tribunal notes that Apotex Inc. “made
clear that its submissions under NAFTA Article 1139(h) were to be treated as part
of its submissions under NAFTA Article 1139(g), and not as independent grounds”:
see Paragraph 229. The tribunal rejects Apotex Inc.’s submissions under Article
1139(h): see paragraph 230ff. In Paragraph 233, the tribunal decides that NAFTA
Article 1139(h) “ ... excludes simple cross-border trade interests. Something more
permanent is necessary”; and, in Paragraph 235, that “each of the specific activities
and expenses relied upon by Apotex [i.e. Apotex Inc.] simply supported and

facilitated its Canadian-based manufacturing and export operations.”

7.48.

7.49.

7.50.

In Paragraphs 241-246, the tribunal concludes overall that Apotex Inc. had made no
“investment” in the territory of the USA within the meaning of NAFTA Article
1139; that, as a necessary consequence, Apotex Inc. does not qualify as an
“investor” under NAFTA Article 1116; and that, accordingly, the tribunal has no

jurisdiction over the claims there made by Apotex Inc. as the claimant.

Lastly, in the first part of the operative part, in Paragraph 358(a), the Tribunal
unanimously orders and awards: “[Lines 1-2] Apotex does not qualify as an
‘investor’, who has made an ‘investment’ in the U.S., for the purposes of NAFTA.
Articles 1116 and 1139, [Lines 2-4] and accordingly both the Sertraline and
Pravastatin Claims are hereby dismissed in their entirety, on the basis that the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction in relation thereto.”

This Tribunal accepts that there are several factors in the Apotex I & II Award
which qualify the application of its passages for the purpose of res judicata in this

arbitration.

The specific claims pleaded by Apotex-Canada in the Apotex I & II arbitration, as
recited and decided in the Apotex I & II Award, are different from the specific
claims made by the Claimants in this arbitration. The former claims related to
“tentatively approved” ANDAs. This is not the specific case pleaded by the
Claimants in this arbitration where the ANDAs were “finally approved” and where
no claim as to “tentatively approved” ANDAs is advanced by the Claimants.*
Hence, the operative part, read by itself and in strict isolation from the preceding

reasons, could not form the basis of res judicata in this arbitration.

However, as decided above, it is necessary to read the first two lines of Paragraph
358(a) of the operative part in the Apotex I & II Award with the tribunal’s earlier
relevant reasons for this part of the paragraph. It is clear from those reasons that the
parties put distinctively in issue ANDAs generally, not limited to tentatively
approved ANDAs but also including finally approved ANDAs; that the tribunal
actually decided that issue; and that, as that tribunal saw it, that decision, amongst

others, was necessary to resolve the parties’ dispute before it. In the Tribunal’s

°8 ‘The complaints made in the Request (Paras. 55-56) and the Apotex Memorial (Paras. 530-538) as regards
“pending ANDAs” were subsequently abandoned by the Claimants: see the Claimants’ letter to the Tribunal
dated 7 February 2013.

view, it is not required for the application of the res judicata doctrine that there
should be a single reason necessary for the tribunal’s decision: there can be two or
more reasons of equal relevance for the application of the doctrine, particularly
when the parties advance more than one argument in support of their respective

cases (as the parties clearly did in the Apotex I & II arbitration).

Nevertheless, several reasons in the Apotex I & II Award are inapplicable to this
arbitration for the purpose of res judicata, being expressly limited to tentatively
approved ANDAs.” Accordingly, the Tribunal here takes no account of these
reasons in applying res judicata in this case. On the other hand, other passages
clearly do refer to or necessarily include finally approved ANDAs." It is therefore
not possible to conclude that the tribunal’s reasons are limited to tentatively

approved ANDAs.

Whilst addressing whether ANDAs were “property” under NAFTA Article 1139(g),
the tribunal did not independently address ANDAs as “interests” under NAFTA
Article 1139(h). In Paragraph 229 of the Apotex I and II Award, as noted above, the
tribunal records Apotex Inc.’s confirmation that its submissions under NAFTA
Article 1139(h) “were to be treated as part of its submissions under NAFTA Article
1139(g), and not as independent grounds.” It is not entirely clear what these
“submissions” were as part of Apotex Inc.’s submissions under Article 1139(g); but
it is any event clear that both parties made submissions regarding Article 1139(h)
and that the tribunal did address and decide upon ANDAs as investments under

Article 1139(h).°!

Lastly, it is necessary to record that this is not a case which raises any issue of bad
faith or abuse of process by the Claimants. Indeed, the contrary was not suggested
by the Respondent; and, although the Claimants’ Request in this arbitration

originally included a claim relating to non-approved ANDAs, that claim was

abandoned before the publication of the Apotex I & II Award, as already indicated

above.

For the reasons set out below, as regards the claims made by Apotex Inc. in this
arbitration, the Tribunal decides that the Apotex I & II Award, applying the doctrine
of res judicata, precludes Apotex Inc. from contending that its finally approved
ANDAs, within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(g), are “property, tangible or
intangible, acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit

or other business purposes.”

In the Tribunal’s view, the operative part (first two lines) and its relevant reasons in
the Apotex I & II Award apply equally to all ANDAs, whether tentatively approved
or finally approved. As part of their essential character, as distinctly decided in the
Apotex I & II Award, Apotex Inc.’s ANDAs are no more than applications
operating as quasi-import licences which support cross-border sales by Apotex Inc.
to its consignees in the USA of products manufactured at its Canadian facilities. The
possibilities of Apotex Inc. selling or transferring ANDAs (albeit revocable and
remaining site-specific to the designated manufacturing facility) do not change the
inherent nature of these ANDAs, as decided in the Apotex I & II Award. ANDAs

are not commodities in the territory of the USA.

As regards Apotex Inc., the Tribunal comes to the same conclusion in regard to
NAFTA Article 1139(h). Applying the doctrine of res judicata, the Tribunal decides
that Apotex Inc. is precluded from contending that its finally approved ANDAs,
within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(h), are “interests arising from the
capital or other resources in the territory of a Party [the USA] to economic activity
in such territory ...” As decided in the Apotex I & II Award, an ANDA operates
only as a quasi-import licence supporting cross-border trade interests falling outside
the definition of this provision. Whilst the tribunal in the Apotex I & II Award did
not independently apply NAFTA Article 1139(h), as noted above, the tribunal
nonetheless distinctly addressed this provision. The tribunal rejected the case

advanced by Apotex Inc.”

Shorn of all semantic technicalities, it is worth asking the simple question after
reading the relevant passages from the Apotex I & II Award in the Annex to this
Part VII: how would that tribunal respond to the specific claims made by Apotex
Inc. in this arbitration under NAFTA Article 1139? In this Tribunal’s view, that
question admits of only one answer: the Apotex I & II tribunal would say that it had
already decided the essential issues relating to these claims in its award; and,
applying the same two lines of its operative part with its same supporting reasons,
that these claims failed to meet the requirements of NAFTA Article 1139 for

jurisdiction under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven.

In the Tribunal’s view, it is impossible to dismiss those reasons as mere ‘obiter
dicta’ or to read one passage in isolation from those reasons as a whole. Those
reasons under both NAFTA Articles 1139(g) and 1139(h) were essential to the
operative part and thereby distinctly determined matters distinctly in issue in the
Apotex I & II arbitration. It is also impermissible to parse the two sets of claims in
the two arbitrations, so as artificially to distinguish one case from the other. The
purpose of the res judicata doctrine under international law is to put an end to
litigation; and it would thwart that purpose if a party could so easily escape the

doctrine by ‘claim-splitting’ in successive proceedings.

Thus, the Claimants did not argue (nor could they) that simply because the Apotex I
& II Award addressed specific claims relating to Sertraline and Pravastatin, the
Claimants could still bring the same claims relating to other drug products.
Similarly, in the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants cannot now distinguish tentatively
approved ANDAs from finally approved ANDAs so as to frustrate the application
of res judicata to issues decided in the Apotex I & II Award. That is an
impermissible attempt to re-argue and overturn the final and binding decisions in
the Apotex I & II Award. The Tribunal notes that, in Grynberg v. Grenada, that
tribunal likewise rejected an analogous attempt based upon a new allegation of
corruption. Indeed, were it so easy to side-step the application of res judicata, the

doctrine would be largely meaningless under international law, a risk recognised by

° Grynberg v. Grenada, supra, Para. 7.3.6 (“It is true that Claimants style the present arbitration as Treaty claim
based [the first arbitration was contract-based upon a concession agreement]. But the difficulty with this is that,

as pleaded and argued, the present case

is no more than an attempt to re-litigate and overturn the findings of

 

another ICSID tribunal, based on allegations of corruption that were either known at the time or which ought to
have been raised by way of a revision application and over which the Prior Tribunal had jurisdiction”).

several scholars, including Professors Dodge, Schreuer and Reinisch in the works
cited earlier in this Part. The costs and time required for investor-state arbitrations,
already not inconsiderable, would be multiplied several times over if unsuccessful
claimants could persuade later tribunals to restrict the effect of earlier awards by
simply reformulating their claims and arguments. As already described, there is a
strong interest, both public and private, in bringing an end to a dispute by one final

and binding arbitration award.

In regard to Apotex-Holdings, the Tribunal decides that same result must follow,
albeit for additional reasons. Given that Apotex Inc.’s ANDAs are not
“investments” under NAFTA Article 1139, it follows that Apotex-Holdings cannot
make any claim in respect of its indirect interest in such ANDAs because Apotex-
Holdings is not, for that purpose, an investor with a relevant “investment” under

NAFTA Article 1139.

Conclusion

Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal (by a majority) decides this second
issue in favour of the Respondent and against Apotex Inc. and Apotex-Holdings.
Thus, the Tribunal (by a majority) upholds the Respondent’s jurisdictional
objections to the claims made by the Claimants in regard to the ANDAs under
NAFTA Articles 1101(1), 1116 and 1139. (This decision does not apply, of course,
to the other claims made by Apotex-Holdings for itself and for Apotex-US which

are considered in the Parts which follow).

Whilst this conclusion disposes of the Claimants’ claims under the doctrine of res
judicata, it should not be assumed that the Tribunal (by a majority) would have
reached any different decision on the Claimants’ other submissions under NAFTA
Article 1139. Notwithstanding a well-researched argument by Counsel for the
Claimants as regards the correct interpretation of Article 1139 (to which the
Tribunal here pays tribute), the Tribunal remains attracted to the succinct
submissions of the Respondent and Mexico to the effect that the definition of an
“investment” under both Article 1139(g) and 1139(h) must be read with Article
NAFTA 1101(1), collectively requiring such investment to be “in the territory” of
the host State. Although Apotex Inc.’s ANDAs were originally submitted and
approved in the USA, this Tribunal (by a majority) considers that such ANDAs

Part VII - Page 20 of 22

7.63.

7.64.

cannot meet that particular requirement, particularly when Apotex Inc. has never
had any presence, activity or other investment in the territory of the USA, including
the non-payment of any relevant US taxes. (This is not inconsistent with the

approach taken in the Apotex I & II Award.)

Dissent: As noted above, the decision on this issue is not made by the Tribunal
unanimously. What follows in the next three paragraphs is the dissent on this issue

by Mr. Rowley.

Had he been sitting alone, Mr. Rowley would have reached a different conclusion
on this issue. For him, the essence of res judicata is that a right, question or fact has
distinctly been put in issue and distinctly determined by a court or tribunal of
competent jurisdiction in an earlier proceeding between the same parties. He
considers that the Apotex I & II tribunal neither decided, nor needed to decide the
question which is now before the Tribunal, i.e., whether Apotex Inc.’s finally
approved ANDAs plus associated products are to be characterised as “property” for
the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g). The Apotex I & II tribunal stated clearly
that: “The jurisdictional issue here turns upon the inherent nature of the relevant
ANDAs...” (Paragraph 224, emphasis added). The relevant ANDAs were
understood to be Apotex Inc.’s Sertraline and Pravastatin ANDA filings which had
only been tentatively approved by the FDA. The Apotex I & II tribunal well
understood the difference between tentatively approved and finally approved
ANDAs, and made the point that “ ... it remains entirely unclear whether a
tentatively-approved ANDA (i.e. as distinct from (i) a finally-approved ANDA, and
(ii) a finally-approved ANDA plus associated products) has value.” (Paragraph 220,
emphasis added). Because the ANDAs before the Apotex I & II tribunal had only
been tentatively approved, the tribunal reasoned that “ ... at the relevant time, (a)
Apotex’s [i.e. Apotex Inc.’s] ANDAs could not (yet) be characterised as ‘property’
for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g), and (b), even if they did constitute
“property”, Apotex’s [i.e. Apotex Inc.’s] ANDAs were not yet ‘acquired in the
expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes’

...” (Paragraph 209, emphasis added/italics in the original).

See Paras. 186, 192, 196 and 225 of the Apotex I & II Award.

Part VII - Page 21 of 22

7.65.

7.66.

For Mr. Rowley, it was plain that the Apotex I & II tribunal simply did not
determine whether the relevant ANDAs here in issue (i.e. finally approved ANDAs
plus associated products) constitute an “investment” under the terms of NAFTA
Article 1139(g). Indeed, as it addressed the character of tentatively approved
ANDAs, it was at pains to point out how they differed from finally approved
ANDAs. How the Apotex I & II tribunal would have decided the claims made by
Apotex in this proceeding is not relevant to the question as to what was “distinctly
in issue” before it, and what it “distinctly determined”, except to the extent that if
the question needs to be asked, it points strongly to the conclusion that the Apotex I

& II tribunal did not decide the question here in issue.

As to whether Apotex Inc.’s finally approved ANDAs are properly characterised as
an “investment” for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g), Mr. Rowley considers
the uncontroverted evidence that: (i) Apotex’s finally approved ANDAs were being
used for the purposes of economic benefit at the time of the Import Alert; (ii) such
ANDAs are regularly bought and sold in the US (often for substantial amounts); (iii)
FDA regulations explicitly recognise that ANDAs are “owned” by the applicant;
and (iv) US tax law treats ANDAs as franchises or intangibles for the purposes of
the US tax code, is sufficient proof that Apotex’s ANDAs here in issue constitute

intangible property for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g).

(taken from the public redacted version of the document)

V. The Jurisdiction and Admissibility Objections

177. Apotex’s second characterisation of its alleged “investment” focuses upon the actual
ANDA submissions themselves. Properly analysed, this submission has two distinct
elements:

(a) the activity of preparing each ANDA for filing in the United States, and
(b) the actual ANDA itself, as an item of “property”.

178. In the Tribunal’s view, neither element qualifies for the purposes of NAFTA Chapter
Eleven.

179. The Activity of Preparing ANDAs: Apotex has made detailed submissions as to the
substantial nature of ANDAs, and the huge effort and expenditure required to compile
them.

180. In particular, Apotex points to the statutory and regulatory requirements for ANDA
approval, which are not only extensive, but specific to the United States (i.e. different to
the requirements for other countries). By way of example, in order to sell a product in
the United States, an ANDA applicant must meet the FDA’s so-called “Current Good
Manufacturing Practice for Finished Pharmaceuticals”, which imposes strict
requirements governing the testing, manufacturing and labelling of the ANDA
products.' These include, inter alia:

(a) Particular laboratory controls; stability testing programs; batch production and
process controls; in-process controls for sampling; and procedures for
identifying; storing; handling; sampling; testing and approving drug products,
components and containers’;

(b) Strict requirements governing the documentation of such testing, sampling, and
manufacturing, and the controls for each’ ;

(c) Specific requirements relating to the design; size; location; construction and
maintenance of the facilities and equipment used in manufacturing, processing,
packaging, testing, or storage of its drug products, regardless of where such

facilities and equipment are located.* Indeed, as Apotex noted, the FDA inspects
each applicant’s manufacturing facilities, whether domestic or foreign, to ensure
that the establishment is capable of manufacturing the proposed drug product in
accordance with the FDA’s requirements, and that the submitted data is accurate

and complete.*
According to Apotex, the FDA’s approval requirements differ significantly from those
in other countries.° This means that when Apotex invests its financial and other
resources towards designing, formulating, and manufacturing an ANDA product, and
preparing the ANDA itself, it does so with the expectation of marketing such product
solely in the United States. ;

Further, Apotex emphasises that the efforts it made to comply with the FDA’s
processing, manufacturing, testing, sampling, packaging, and storage requirements
were product specific. § For example:

(a) Formulation and development work on Apotex’s sertraline tablets obviously does
not carry over to Apotex’s pravastatin tablets, or indeed any other product;

(b) Testing conducted to show that Apotex’s sertraline tablets are bio-equivalent to
Zoloft® cannot be used to demonstrate bio-equivalence of Apotex’s pravastatin
tablets to Pravachol®, and vice versa.”

(c) Apotex’s in-process and manufacturing controls are specific to each product. v0

(d) Apotex obviously cannot reuse labels designed for either its sertraline or
pravastatin products in the sale of another product. u

On the basis of all these points, it is Apotex’s case that the costs it has incurred in
meeting the specific FDA requirements for approval of its sertraline and pravastatin
ANDAs are “investments” under Article 1139.'” Apotex would never have incurred
these expenses if it had not been required to do so under U.S. statutory and federal
regulatory requirements. 13 Likewise, the only reason Apotex undertook the enormous
expense and effort to comply with these U.S.-specific requirements was to obtain
approval for, and to market and sell, its sertraline and pravastatin ANDA products in
the United States.‘

Apotex placed heavy reliance here upon the statement in Grand River Enterprises Six
Nations, Ltd. et. al. v. United States that:

“a salient characteristic of an investment covered by the protection of
NAFTA Chapter Eleven would be that the investment is primarily
regulated by the law of a state other than the state of the investor’s
nationality, and that this law is created and applied by that state which is
not the state of the investor’s nationality”."°

Further, Apotex argues that all this activity should be persuasive evidence that it had
an investment in the territory of the United States. For this, Apotex relies upon the
statement of the Tribunal in SGS v. Philippines that:

“SGS’s inspections abroad were not carried out for their own sake but in
order to enable it to provide, in the Philippines, an inspection certificate
on which [the Philippines] could rely to enter goods ... «6

The Tribunal is unpersuaded that the costs and effort expended in preparing ANDAs
either constitutes or evidences an “investment” in the United States, for the purposes
of NAFTA Chapter Eleven. This is for a number of reasons.

First, whilst ANDAs are of course filed within the territory of the United States, the
actual activity in question (the preparation of each submission) is evidently conducted
by Apotex outside of the United States. Specifically, it is reported that at the Signet
Campus:

“operations focus on product development activities, which include
product formulation and process development, production and
evaluation of clinical batches, analytical development and assessment as

well as the creation and submission of generic drug approvals”. 7

Second, it is common ground that an ANDA must be submitted by any manufacturer of
generic drugs that seeks to have its products sold in the United States. This is so
regardless of whether the manufacturer is investing in, or merely exporting to, the
United States. Consequently, the preparation of the filing, in and of itself, does not
establish that a generic drug manufacturer is investing in, rather than exporting
products to, the United States.

Notably in this case, whilst Apotex describes itself as a Canadian manufacturer and
exporter of:

“approved generic pharmaceutical products for sale in the United States

and throughout the world”,

and whilst, in its ANDAs, Apotex sought approval for the sale of its sertraline and
pravastatin products in the United States, it is clear that the actual sale of these
products in the United States was always to be conducted by parties other than Apotex
itself. Hence in each of its Notices of Arbitration, Apotex states (at para. 13) that:

“[b]efore one of Apotex’s generic drugs can be sold by others in the
United States, Apotex must obtain approval from the [FDA]”.

[emphasis added]. ”

Third, Apotex’s reliance on the Grand River and Bayview awards to suggest that costs
incurred outside the United States in compliance with a U.S. regulatory regime can
constitute “investments” in the United States is misplaced. As noted, Apotex relies in
particular on the observation that “a salient characteristic of an investment” is:

“regulation by the law of a state other than the state of the investor’s
nationality. ”

But both the Grand River and Bayview tribunals made clear that the law of the host
State is only one “salient” factor in determining whether expenditures qualify as an
“investment” under NAFTA Article 1139.7! It is not, in itself, a sufficient factor. Hence,
the Bayview tribunal declined jurisdiction over all of the claimants’ claims, because the
claimants had not made an investment in the territory of the respondent State, stating:

 

“In the opinion of the Tribunal, it is quite plain that NAFTA Chapter
Eleven was not intended to provide substantive protections or rights of
action to investors whose investments are wholly confined to their own
national States, in circumstances where those investments may be
affected by measures taken by another NAFTA State Party. The NAFTA

should not be interpreted so as to bring about this unintended result 022

The Grand River tribunal similarly declined jurisdiction over most of the claimants’
claims, concluding that it did not have jurisdiction:

... over claims that are based on injury to investments located in one
NAFTA Party on account of actions taken by authorities in another”.3

Thus, as the Respondent has argued, the mere regulation of Apotex’s foreign products
(however extensive) cannot transform the costs incurred in developing those products
into investments in the United States.

Fourth, even if Apotex had incurred these regulatory costs in the United States, the
expenditures incurred in the preparation and filing of an ANDA submission, being no
more than an exercise in securing regulatory clearance, do not fall within the scope of
NAFTA Article 1139. Nor do they change the inherent nature of the activity for which
clearance is sought.

194. As the Grand River tribunal made clear, where a company must meet “regulatory
requirements” to sell its products in the United States, the costs of such compliance
themselves are not “investments ”.74 Rather, those costs are:

“incident to ‘commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services,’

which fall outside of Article 1139's definition of investment”.”°

195. Indeed, as the Respondent has pointed out, if preparing an ANDA could constitute an
“investment” under Article 1139, then any Canadian or Mexican exporter requiring
U.S. regulatory clearance to have its goods sold by third parties in the United States
could potentially bring an investment claim under NAFTA Chapter Eleven, whenever
such clearance, in the exporter’s view, was wrongly denied or delayed. This would be
so regardless of whether the exporter made or sought to make an investment in the
United States. The Tribunal is persuaded by the Respondent’s submission that allowing
a mere application for regulatory clearance to export goods into the United States to
give rise to an “investment” claim under Chapter Eleven would be inconsistent with
the core objectives of NAFTA’s investment chapter.

196. The ANDA Submissions as “Property”: The second way in which this submission
was put by Apotex was to characterise the actual ANDA filing itself as “property ...
acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other
business purposes” in the United States, for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g).

197. This argument proceeded in a number of stages.

198. First, Apotex asserted that for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g), it had to identify
two separate elements: (a) “property”, (b) that was “acquired in the expectation or
used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes”.

199. Second, and with respect to element (a), it was asserted that an ANDA filing, and the
confidential data and information contained therein, constitutes the “property” of the
ANDA applicant. According to Apotex, once filed in the United States with the FDA,
only the “applicant may transfer ownership of its application” 76 Further, an ANDA
can be bought and sold like all other property,” and (bearing in mind the general
definition of “property” in Black’s Law Dictionary), the ANDA applicant has the
exclusive right to possess, use and enjoy the ANDA, as well as the products approved
thereunder.**

*4 Grand River, Award, para. 115. It may be recalled that Grand River claimed to have spent approximately US$
29 million dollars complying with U.S. statutory and regulatory requirements for the purposes of marketing its

691 C.F.R.§314.72(a).

27 Hence, the MMA requires that certain agreements between two ANDA applicants, or between ANDA
applicants and brand name drug manufacturers, regarding an ANDA be submitted to the Federal Trade
Commission and the United States Assistant Attorney General (MMA § 1112).

°S Citing Black’s Law Dictionary 1232, “property” (9th ed. 2009). According to Apotex, whether an ANDA,
and the data and information contained therein, is considered tangible or intangible property makes no
difference, since the United States Supreme Court has stated that the intangible nature of certain business
information does not make it any less “property” (citing McNally v. United States, 483 U.S. 350, 356 (1987).

 

PART VII— Annex - Page 5 of 16

200. Hence, the FDA is obligated to maintain confidential all information in unapproved
ANDAs and is not even permitted to confirm the existence of an unapproved ANDA
unless the ANDA sponsor itself has already done so.

201. Third, with respect to the second element in NAFTA Article 1139(g), all investments in
each ANDA were effected “... in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic
benefit or other business purposes” in the United States.

202. Apotex submitted that while an ANDA, and the products approved thereunder,
unquestionably are property of the applicant, the value of an ANDA is intrinsically tied
to FDA approval in the United States (or the promise of future approval in the United
States). [fan ANDA is never approved and the product can never be sold, the ANDA in
question is then essentially worthless.7

203. Further, as already noted, an ANDA is an extremely substantial document. It generally
comprises thousands, if not tens of thousands, of pages containing confidential and
proprietary information pertaining to the formulation, development, manufacture,
processing, testing, packaging, labelling, and storage of the proposed generic drug
product.

204. On the basis of these points, Apotex then contended that it is therefore more than
simply an “exporter”. It cannot export and commercialise anything in the United States
without an approved ANDA, and without undertaking the investment and development
that goes into that ANDA. An ANDA is therefore a uniquely United States investment. It
is also of no use anywhere else.

205. According to Apotex, unlike a mere import permit or certificate, it is the
pharmaceutical product and investment itself that is necessary not only to get a product
into the United States, but also to make and ultimately realise the commercial value of
that investment. In other words, without the ANDA, there is no product to
commercialise in the United States.

206. The Tribunal has carefully considered all aspects of this submission, and all evidence
on which it is based. But in the Tribunal’s view, neither of Apotex’s sertraline and
pravastatin ANDAs are properly characterised as “property acquired in the expectation
or used for the purpose of economic benefit or other business purposes,” within the
meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(g), and none of Apotex’s submissions are sufficient to
distinguish itself from a mere exporter of goods into the United States.

207. First, whilst an ANDA may be characterised for certain purposes as “property”, 3! the
Tribunal does not consider that the nature of an ANDA is such as to fall within the
contemplated scope of NAFTA Article 1139(g), as that provision must be understood as
a whole, by reference to the objects and purposes of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

the law of the host State. See e.g., Rosalyn Higgins, The Taking of Property by the State: Recent Developments

212.

Notwithstanding its very substantial nature, and the time and cost required for its
compilation, an ANDA, ultimately, remains simply an application for revocable
permission to (in this case) export a product for sale (by others) in the United States.
Even if, as a technical matter, the application may be “owned”, unlike Apotex’s
approach, the Tribunal does not consider that NAFTA Article 1139(g) can be
approached by divorcing the concept of “property” from its context, and applying it in
the abstract.

As observed by the Respondent, property is not an “investment” if, as here, it merely
supports cross-border sales.

Second, this is all the more so here because (as the Respondent has emphasised) on the
date of the alleged NAFTA breaches, the sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs were only
tentatively approved by the FDA. It follows that at the relevant time, (a) Apotex’s
ANDAs could not (yet) be characterised as “property” for the purposes of NAFTA
Article 1139(g), and (b), even if they did constitute “property”, Apotex’s ANDAs were
not yet “acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of economic benefit or
other business purposes,” given that the only economic benefit or other business
purpose Apotex claims is the right to sell drugs in the U.S., and given that this right
was neither acquired nor enjoyed by virtue of tentatively approved ANDAs.

The FDA grants “tentative approval” to an ANDA when all scientific and procedural
conditions for approval have been met. But the FDA does not finally approve an ANDA
until various other barriers to approval no longer apply,” and an application with a
tentative approval will not become finally approved until the FDA issues a final
approval letter. Even then, final approval of a tentatively-approved ANDA is not
automatic, because the FDA still “has an ongoing health and safety responsibility to
perform”.* The FDA may revoke tentative approval, or even final approval, of ANDAs
for a variety of reasons related to the new products’ safety and effectiveness, including
(inter alia) a finding that there is an imminent hazard to public health; that clinical or
other tests or scientific data indicate any lack of safety; or a lack of substantial
evidence from adequate and well controlled investigations that the drug will have the
effect it is reported or represented to have. The regulations expressly afford the FDA a
broad discretion in this regard.

In this case, the FDA informed Apotex in terms that its tentatively-approved ANDAs for
sertraline and pravastatin were “subject to change on the basis of new information that
may come to [FDA’s] attention”.*° The same letters instructed Apotex to apply for final
approval of its ANDAs, and noted that the tentative approval could be rescinded.

As part of the application process, Apotex received several notices of deficiency for
both sertraline and pravastatin, including at least one notice following the tentative
approval. These notices required Apotex to supplement its ANDAs with additional

October 2006.*” This was prior to the FDA’s final approval or Apotex’s sertraline
ANDA.**

214. Similarly, Apotex alleges that the pravastatin-related NAFTA breaches occurred no
later than August 2006.*° This was prior to the FDA’s final approval of Apotex’s
pravastatin ANDA.”°

215. Apotex responded to this by asserting that but for the Respondent’s alleged breach of
its legal obligations, Apotex would have been granted final, not tentative, approval
because no other impediments to approval existed at that time. The Tribunal is
unpersuaded by this submission. Whether or not each of Apotex’s ANDAs would have
been granted final approval is by no means certain on the evidence. But in any event,
the critical enquiry must be as to the nature of the alleged “property” as at the date of
the alleged breach — not at some future point.

21

a

Third, Apotex’s argument that an ANDA cannot be equated with an application for an
export or import licence is unconvincing, Apotex submits that ANDAs are never treated
as export or import licences in the relevant U.S. statutes and regulations, and that:

“Anyone who wants to engage in the pharmaceutical market in the
United States, whether domestic or foreign, regardless of what borders
that drug or product may have to cross, they have to do an ANDA. There
is no exception. So, it’s not an import or export permit”. 4

217. But the fact that domestic U.S. companies are also required to submit ANDAs appears
to miss the point. Whilst an ANDA itself may not be, in strict technical terms, an export
or import licence, it operated - in this case - in precisely the same way. As already
noted, all Apotex’s operations were outside of the U.S. Apotex wanted to export its
goods to the U.S., to be marketed and sold there by other entities. In order to do this,
Apotex was required to obtain permission, which was to be secured by the submission
of an ANDA. The ANDA was thus a requirement in order to conduct an export
business. If there had been no ANDA process, the underlying business could not be said

to be an “investment” in the U.S. The fact that an ANDA was required does not change
the nature of the business.

Further, the fact that the ANDA process is governed exclusively by U.S. law and
regulations does not change the nature of the process: it remains an application to
permit the sale of goods which in this case are to be produced entirely outside of the
U.S., and to be exported for sale by others.

Fourth, the Tribunal is not persuaded that an ANDA must be characterised as
“property” for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g) because it contains
“confidential data and information”.” As the Respondent has observed, Apotex may
have a right under U.S. law to have its disclosures to the FDA kept confidential, but
there is no basis for this to transform the inherent nature of the ANDA itself, from an
application for permission to export goods into the United States, into some form of
investment within the scope of NAFTA Article 1139(g).

Fifth, Apotex’s asserts that ANDAs “can be bought and sold like all other property”,
but it remains entirely unclear whether a tentatively-approved ANDA (i.e. as distinct
from (i) a finally-approved ANDA, and (ii) a finally-approved ANDA plus associated
products) has value. It is to be recalled that a tentatively-approved ANDA provides no
permission to export generic drugs into the United States for sale. Further, as Apotex
itself made clear: “{i]f an ANDA is never approved and the product can never be sold,
such ANDA is essentially worthless "#4 And yet Apotex has insisted that:

“Apotex’s investment in its ANDAs, and its property rights therein, are
actualized the moment such ANDAs are filed with the FDA”.

The Tribunal acknowledges Apotex’s argument that companies do, nevertheless buy,
sell, and calculate the estimated value of ANDAs that have not yet received approval
(albeit most examples given were in the context of broader purchases /rearrangements
of pharmaceutical businesses, rather than individual unapproved ANDAs). But even if
an ANDA may be bought and sold as Apotex argues, this would still not change its
essential character, which is an application to (in this case) export generic drugs into
the United States. As such, the Tribunal considers that it would still not qualify for the
purposes of NAFTA Article 1139(g).

Sixth, Apotex’s assertion that an ANDA applicant has “the exclusive right to possess,
use and enjoy the ANDA and the products approved thereunder”,”* takes the matter no
further. Even if Apotex has exclusive rights over the ANDA, this cannot change the
inherent nature of the ANDA itself. In other words, an application to export generic
drugs into the United States is not transformed into an “investment” for the purposes
of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, because the holder of the application has exclusive rights
thereto.

Indeed, it may be noted that Apotex’s asserted “exclusivity” is open to question in any
event. As already noted, no products could be sold until the ANDAs had been finally
approved. All that Apotex held at the relevant time were tentatively-approved

applications for revocable permission, which were subject to continual regulatory
oversight and monitoring in the public interest. And even when finally approved,
Apotex was not protected from changes to, or revocation of, its ANDAS.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that Apotex’s submissions as to the
notion and general characteristics of “property” (based upon Black’s Law Dictionary)
are of only limited assistance in delimiting NAFTA Article 1139(g). The jurisdictional
issue here turns upon the inherent nature of the relevant ANDAs, not the nature of
Apotex’s rights over them. As set out above, even assuming that the ANDAs were
Apotex’s exclusive “property”, they remained no more than applications for permission
to (in this case) export, and as such neither fell within NAFTA Article 1139(g), nor
constituted “investments” as contemplated more generally by NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

Thus, neither Apotex’s ANDAs, nor its activities in Canada, nor the costs incurred
there in meeting the requirements of the U.S. regulatory regime for exporting its goods,
are “investments” in the United States.

tii. Other Investments Made In the U.S.

Apotex’s third characterisation of its alleged “investment” focuses upon “other
significant” investments said to have been made in the territory of the United States,
within the scope of NAFTA Article 1139(h).

In its written submissions, Apotex asserted that it has committed significant capital and
resources towards the preparation, filing and maintenance of its sertraline and
pravastatin ANDAs and products in the United States, as well as towards U.S. patent
litigation arising as a result of these ANDAs. In particular:

(a) Because Apotex does not reside or have a place of business in the United States,
in accordance with FDA’s regulations, Apotex has utilised its U.S. affiliate,
Apotex Corp., (a Delaware corporation with a place of business in Florida) as its
U.S. Agent for all corr spondence and submissions to the FDA for its pravastatin
and sertraline ANDAs.*

(b) Apotex Corp. also acts as the distributor for both of Apotex’s pravastatin and
sertraline ANDA products. According to Apotex, the sale of its ANDA products
in the United States qualifies as “economic activity in [the] territory”, the
proceeds of which go directly, and in full, to it and its affiliates. Further, Apotex’s
relationship with its U.S. affiliate, agent and distributor (Apotex Corp.) also
independently qualifies as “an interest in an enterprise that entitles the owner to
share in income or profits of the enterprise” for the purposes of NAFTA Art
1139e), and so qualifies as an “investment”.

  

(c) Apotex has also committed significant capital in the United States towards the
purchase of raw materials and ingredients used in its sertraline and pravastatin
ANDA products, which again are sold solely in the United States. Apotex
emphasises that:

- it purchased all but one of the inactive ingredients used in the manufacture of
its pravastatin sodium tablets (10 mg, 20 mg and 50 mg) from U.S.
manufacturers,” and it spent over [deleted in original ] on these
ingredients;~”

- it purchased all but two of the inactive ingredients used in the manufacture of
its sertraline hydrochloride tablets (25 mg, 50 mg and 100 mg), from U.S.
manufacturers, ”! and spent nearly [deleted in original] on these ingredients;*°

each of these ingredients is essential to the formulation and manufacture of
both sertraline and pravastatin products, and is a substantial and non-
severable aspect of Apotex’s overall investment in each ANDA.

(d) As a consequence of filing a paragraph IV certification in connection with both
its sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs, Apotex was required by the FDA
regulation to designate a U.S. Agent to accept service of process for any patent
litigation initiated in response to its sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs.* In doing
so, Apotex notes that it consented to jurisdiction and suit in the United States,
thus exposing itself to patent litigation in U.S. federal courts, and the potential
for incurring substantial sums in legal fees in connection with this U.S.
litigation.~* And in this regard, Apotex has spent in excess of [deleted in original]
in legal fees in connection with its sertraline ANDA litigation, and in excess of
[deleted in original] in legal fees in connection with its pravastatin ANDA
litigation, all such expenses having been incurred in the United States. * Apotex
emphasises that this expenditure was made for the sole purpose of “securing an
economic benefit from the sale of its sertraline and pravastatin ANDA products in
the United States”.

228. Apotex emphasised that other tribunals (under other treaties) have recognised that
claimants need not have incurred all, or even most, of their expenses inside the
territory of the host State citing, inter alia, SGS v. Philippines, at para. 106:

“The fact that the bulk of the cost of providing the service was incurred
outside the Philippines is not decisive”.

And SGS v. Pakistan, ~* at para. 136:

“While the expenditures [in Pakistan related to SGS’s extraterritorial
customs inspection] may be relatively small ... they involved the injection

of funds into the territory of Pakistan for carrying out SDS’s
engagements under the PSI Agreement”.

In the course of its oral submissions, Apotex then made clear that its submissions under
NAFTA Article 1139(h) were to be treated as part of its submissions under NAFTA
Article 1139(g), and not as independent grounds. This was specifically confirmed to the
Tribunal:

 

“PRESIDENT LANDAU. ... The other point I just wanted to ask is, just for clarity, the
exact positioning of your Article 1139(h) case ... that actually the 1139(h) argument, it
doesn’t stand by itself; is that right? Is it dependent upon us making a finding that the
ANDA itself is an investment?

MR. RAKOCZY: Yes. Our basic argument is it’s part and parcel of the ANDA
investment because the commitments that had been made, the commitments of capital,
that’s why - and I apologize, Mr. President, it goes back to some of your earlier
questions. It’s hard to parcel out all the elements that go into this investment, but all
these things go into it: The costs of development, the amount spent in the United States
on the raw materials all go into the ANDA investment itself, and then obviously the
substantial costs incurred in the litigation, the causes of action, obviously are all part
and parcel of the ANDA. We would not be able to separate those.

PRESIDENT LANDAU: So, is it right to summarise the argument that 1139(h) is part
of your 1139(g) argument? And if not you’re not asking us to find 1139(h) by itself?

MR. RAKOCZY: Would you just give me one moment.
PRESIDENT LANDAU: Yes, of course.
(Pause.)
MR. RAKOCZY: Mr. President, we wouldn’t dispute that, yes, the sub (h) claim
basically relies on as part and parcel of the (g) claim, which is our primary
contention”.
In the Tribunal’s view, none of the items identified under NAFTA Article 1139(h)
amounts to an “investment” within NAFTA Chapter eleven, and whether considered
separately or together, none changes the analysis under NAFTA Article 1139(g).
As set out earlier, NAFTA Article 1139(h) includes:

“(h) interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the
territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory, such as under

(i) contracts involving the presence of an investor’s property in the territory of
the Party, including turnkey or construction contracts, or concessions, or

(ii) contracts where remuneration depends substantially on the production,
revenues or profits of an enterprise[.]”

But this article must be read with NAFTA Articles 1139(i) and (j), which clarify that
“investment does not mean”:

PART VII— Annex - Page 12 of 16

233.

234.

235.

236.

“(i) claims to money that arise solely from

(i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a
national or enterprise in the territory of a Party to an
enterprise in the territory of another Party, or

(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial
transaction, such as trade financing, other than a loan
covered by subparagraph (d); or

(j) any other claims to money,

that do not involve the kinds of interests set out in subparagraphs (a)
through (h)”.

Hence, as the Respondent has stressed, NAFTA Article 1139(h)’s focus on interests
arising from the commitment of capital in the host State to economic activity in such
territory - excludes simple cross-border trade interests. Something more permanent is
necessary.

By way of example, in Mondev v. United States, the Canadian claimant alleged that
through its wholly owned U.S. limited partnership, it obtained interests arising from
contractual rights to develop large parcels of property in downtown Boston. The
tribunal thus concluded that, through the rights acquired in these construction
contracts:

“Mondev’s claims involved interests arising from the commitment of
capital or other resources in the territory of the United States”

which fell squarely within the definition of “investment” under NAFTA Article 1139(h).

On being challenged to identify precisely what investment “interests” arose from its
designation of a U.S. agent and distributor; the purchase of U.S. raw materials; or the
incurring of U.S. legal fees,” Apotex stated as follows in its Rejoinder:

“Apotex’s investment “interests” lie in the submission, maintenance and
utilization of its sertraline and pravastatin ANDAs and in achieving an
economic benefit from the marketing and sale of the products subject to
such ANDAs in the United States”.”

In the Tribunal’s considered view, this is inadequate to meet the requirements of
NAFTA Article 1139. The “interests” so identified amount to no more than the ordinary
conduct of a business for the export and sale of goods. And as set out below, each of the
specific activities and expenses relied upon by Apotex simply supported and facilitated
its Canadian-based manufacturing and export operations.

Designation of Apotex Corp. as U.S. Agent: Apotex’s designation of its U.S. affiliate
as its agent for correspondence and submissions to the FDA with respect to its ANDAs
cannot, on any view, amount to an “investment”. In the Respondent’s words, it was

PART VII— Annex - Page 13 of 16

simply a “commercial contract for the sale of ... services” incident to the regulatory
requirements of the U.S. market. It did not involve the kinds of interests that Article
1139 contemplated as arising from the “commitment of capital or other resources in the
territory of a Party”. On a fair reading of NAFTA, it is excluded as an “investment” by
Article 1139(i).

237. Utilisation of Apotex Corp as U.S. Distributor: Similarly, the fact that Apotex
Corp acts as Apotex’s distributor of pravastatin and sertraline ANDA products in the
United States does not transform Apotex’s activity from one of export to one of
investment. On the contrary, it is simply the mechanism by which the export and sale is
conducted. It is to be noted that the Grand River tribunal found expressly that the
appointment of a separate company to distribute the claimants’ products did not
transform the distributor into an “investment” under NAFTA. °

238. Apotex’s reliance on SGS v. Philippines and SGS v. Pakistan is of no assistance here.
Apart from the fact that neither case involved an interpretation of the NAFTA, which
provides its own definition of “investment”, in both cases the claimant had established
“liaison offices” in the respondent States. Apotex has not alleged any such
investments in the United States, but instead conceded that it “does not reside or have a
place of business in the United States ol

239. Purchase of Raw Materials in the U.S.: The Tribunal has no reason to doubt that
Apotex has committed significant capital in the United States towards the purchase of
raw materials and ingredients used in its sertraline and pravastatin ANDA products.
But this activity was evidently undertaken for the purposes of manufacturing in Canada
products intended for export to the United States (and subsequent sale by others). These
were no more than purchases from U.S. suppliers by way of a “commercial contract, for
the sale of goods” which are generally excluded by NAFTA Article 1139(i). In the
words of the Bayview tribunal (applying NAFTA Article 1139(i)):

 

“[t]he economic dependence of an enterprise upon supplies of goods ...
from another State is not sufficient to make the dependent enterprise an
‘investor’ in that other State”.

240. Consent to US. Jurisdiction / Legal Fees: Apotex’s submission to U.S. jurisdiction;
its engagement of U.S. attorneys; and its expenditure on legal fees again neither amount
to “investments”, nor change the nature of Apotex’s activity. Each is, again, no more

enterprise that entitles the owner to share in income or profits of the enterprise” for the purposes of NAFTA Art
1139(e), and so qualified as an “investment”. This point, however, was neither developed in writing, nor
mentioned in oral submissions, and the Tribunal is unpersuaded by it. There was no evidence that Apotex Corp
was an “investment” of Apotex, or that Apotex had an interest in it, such as to satisfy NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

than an incident of the regulatory requirements of the U.S. market, and a step Apotex
took in order to facilitate its export business. NAFTA Article 1139(i) once again

applies.

Overall Conclusion on “Investment”: It follows from the — Tribunal’s
conclusions above that no “investment” has been made by Apotex in the territory of the
United States, within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven.

(b) “Investor”

Having concluded that Apotex has made no “investment” in the territory of the United
States within the scope of NAFTA Chapter Eleven, it necessarily follows that Apotex
itself does not qualify as an “investor” for these purposes. As noted above, the scope
and coverage of the protections of NAFTA Chapter Eleven extend to “investors” only to
the extent that they have made, or have sought to make, “investments” in the territory
of another NAFTA Party.

vw. Conclusions

Apotex has failed to establish that it made or sought to make an “investment” in the
United States. It therefore does not qualify as an “investor” under NAFTA Article 1116.

Apotex’s activities with respect to the contemplated sales of its sertraline and
pravastatin products in the United States are those of an exporter, not an investor. As
such, the position is analogous to that in Grand River Enterprises, Inc. v. United States,
where the tribunal found that:

“claimants activities centered on the manufacture of cigarettes at
Grand River’s manufacturing plant in Canada for export to the
United States,”

and, as a result, determined that:

“such activities and investments by investors in the territory of one
NAFTA party do not satisfy the jurisdictional requirements for a
claim against another NAFTA party”. 03

Apotex, like any company that intends to export generic drug products to the United
States for sale in the U.S. market, sought regulatory approval from the FDA through the
submission of ANDAs. But this process cannot change the nature of the underlying
activity, or constitute an “investment” in and of itself, within the meaning and scope of
NAFTA Article 1139.

It follows that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over Apotex’s claims, which must be
dismissed in their entirety.

PART VIII - NAFTA ARTICLES 1102 & 1103

Introduction

The Tribunal here addresses the third principal issue regarding the merits of the
claims made by Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US) under NAFTA
Articles 1102 and 1103. Whilst the Tribunal has upheld the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections to Apotex Inc.’s claims under NAFTA Articles 1102 and
1103, it is nonetheless necessary to consider the factual position of Apotex Inc. as
part of this issue, hence the collective references below to “the Claimants.” As
decided in Part VI above, there is a close commercial relationship between Apotex
Inc. and Apotex-US (with the latter as the former’s principal US distributor and
with Apotex-Holdings as their parent company) to warrant such collective

consideration here.

In summary, the Claimants contend that, by adopting and maintaining the Import
Alert, the Respondent accorded to Apotex-Holdings and Apotex-US treatment that
was less favourable than the Respondent’s treatment of comparable investors and
investments in like circumstances; and in so doing, that the Respondent breached
NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103, on national treatment and most-favoured-nation

treatment respectively.

In summary, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to establish the
required elements of either a national treatment claim under NAFTA Article 1102
or a most-favoured-nation treatment claim under NAFTA Article 1103. The
Respondent submits that the Claimants have not shown that they are in “like
circumstances” with any US-based (domestic) comparator; and thus the Claimants
cannot establish a national treatment claim. Further, so the Respondent submits, the
Claimants have failed to establish that any non US-based (foreign) comparator in
like circumstances received better treatment; and thus the Claimants cannot

establish a most-favoured-nation claim.

8.6.

Legal Standard for NAFTA Articles 1102 & 1103

Although the Parties approached the matter slightly differently, it was common
ground that establishing a violation of NAFTA Article 1102 involves an inherently
fact-specific analysis of whether the Claimants, or their alleged investments: (i)
were accorded treatment by the Respondent with respect to the establishment,
acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation, and sale or other
disposition of investments; (ii) were in like circumstances with the identified
domestic investors or investments; and (iii) received treatment Jess favourable than
that accorded to the identified domestic investors or investments. The Respondent
also asserted (but the Claimants denied) that the less favourable treatment invoked
by the Claimants must be shown to have been accorded on the basis of the

Claimants’ Canadian nationalities.'

It is not in issue that the requirements for establishing a violation of NAFTA Article
1103 are the same as establishing a violation of NAFTA Article 1102, except that
the applicable comparator in step (ii) above is a foreign (non-US based) investor or
its investments. It is also not suggested that either NAFTA Article 1102 or Article
1103 prohibits discrimination with respect to investments in the territory of another
Party. The Respondent, therefore, is not obliged to accord national or most-

favoured-nation treatment to the Claimants’ investments in Canada.

Legal and Evidential Burdens of Proof

Relying on the decisions of the UPS tribunal, the Respondent contends that a failure
by the Claimants to establish any of the three required elements under NAFTA
Articles 1102 and 1103 is fatal to the merits of the Claimants’ claims. The
Respondent submits that: “This is a legal burden that rests squarely with the

92

Claimant” and “[t]hat burden never shifts to the [other] Party.” The Respondent

points to the Rompetrol award which is said to confirm that a claimant’s “burden of

May 2007), Para. 84.

Part VIII - Page 2 of 23

proof” is “absolute”, never shifting to the respondent? which bears no “burden of

proof” of its own."

8.7. For their part, the Claimants do not dispute that they carry such a legal burden of
proof, but point to the distinction between the legal burden of proof, which defines
which party has to prove what in order for its case to prevail, and the evidential
burden that may rest upon a party alleging a fact on which it relies in support of its
case or defence. This distinction is relevant, according to the Claimants, when the
Tribunal is required (as here) to consider whether the Respondent has established

with sufficient evidence those facts alleged in its defence.

8.8. The Tribunal considers such a distinction exists between the legal burden of proof
(which never shifts) and the evidential burden of proof (which can shift from one
party to another, depending upon the state of the evidence). In the Pulp Mills case,
the ICJ noted that: “...in accordance with the well-established principle of onus
probandi incumbit actori, it is the duty of the party which asserts certain facts to
establish the existence of such facts. This principle which has been consistently

upheld by the Court applies to the assertions of fact both by the Applicant and the

Respondent.”°

8.9. It is thus for a claimant to prove its positive case and for a respondent to prove its
positive defence, if it has a case to meet. In the wording of the Feldman award:
“[V]arious international tribunals, including the International Court of Justice, have
generally and consistently accepted and applied the rule that the party who asserts a
fact, whether the claimant or respondent, is responsible for providing proof thereof.

Also, it is a generally accepted canon of evidence in civil law, common law and, in

> Rompetrol Group N.V. v. Romania, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/3, Award (6 May 2013), Para. 178 (“[T]he
burden of proof defines which party has to prove what, in order for its case to prevail; the standard of proof
defines how much evidence is needed to establish either an individual issue or the party’s case as a whole. As
soon as the distinction is stated in that way, it becomes evident that the burden of proof is absolute, whereas the
standard of proof is relative. By this the Tribunal means (again, in simple terms) that if, according to basic
principle, it is for the one party, or for the other, to establish a particular factual assertion, that will remain the
position throughout the forensic process, starting from when the assertion is first put forward and all the way
through to the end. Operating within an international system characterised by principle rather than procedural
formality, the Tribunal is not enamoured of arguments setting out to show that a burden of proof can under
certain circumstances shift from the party that originally bore it to the other party, and then perhaps in
appropriate circumstances shift back again to the original party.”).

fact, most jurisdictions, that the burden of proof rests upon the party, whether
complaining or defending, who asserts the affirmative of a claim or defence. [f that
party adduces evidence sufficient to raise a presumption that what is claimed is
true, the burden then shifts to the other party, who will fail unless it adduces

sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption.”®

8.10. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that, whilst the legal burden of proof rests always
on the Claimants to prove their claims under NAFTA Articles 1102 & 1103, the
question whether the evidential burden shifts to the Respondent is relevant to the
Tribunal’s analysis of whether either Sandoz or Teva was “in like circumstances” to
the Claimants under Article 1103. As considered below, in regard to both Sandoz
and Teva, the Tribunal decides that the evidential burden of proof does shift to the

Respondent.

(4) “Treatment”

8.11. NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 require the Respondent to afford no less favourable
“treatment” with respect to “the establishment, acquisition, expansion, management,

conduct, operation, and sale or other disposition of investments.”

8.12. The Claimants point out that NAFTA tribunals have noted the “broad scope of

application”’ of these provisions, and have found that “treatment” “includes almost
any conceivable measure that can be with respect to the beginning, development,
management and end of an investor’s business activity.”* The Claimants refer (inter
alia) to the decision by the Merrill & Ring tribunal that: “treatment is no different

than the aggregate of all the regulatory measures applied to that business.”?

8.13. The Respondent does not contest the Claimants’ submission on the scope of the
word “treatment” in NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103. Rather, the Respondent

contends that because the Import Alert (as the only measure here at issue) did not

acquisition, expansion, management, conduct, operation and sale or other disposition of investments.””).

“relate to” the Claimants or their investments, the measure cannot be said to have
accorded the Claimants or their investments any “treatment” under Articles 1102

and 1103.

Having regard to the Tribunal’s decision in Part VI above under NAFTA Article
1101(1) to the effect that the Import Alert “related to” Apotex-Holdings and
Apotex-US, the Tribunal concludes that the Import Alert qualifies as “treatment” for

the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103.

“Like Circumstances”

The Parties accept that the determination of whether NAFTA claimants are in “like
circumstances” with the relevant investors or investments (as “comparators’’)
involves a highly fact-specific inquiry.'° The Parties also accept that it is
appropriate in the identification of comparators which are in “like circumstances” to
look at, inter alia, whether those which are said to be comparators: (i) are in the
same economic of business sector; (ii) have invested in, or are businesses that
compete with the investor or its investments in terms of goods or services; or (iii)
are subject to a comparable legal regime or regulatory requirements, |! as the

Claimants and their investments.

The principal points of disagreement between the Parties on this point concern the
Respondent’s submissions that none of the domestic comparators identified by the
Claimants for the purpose of NAFTA Article 1102 are subject to the same legal and
regulatory regime (particularly import alerts). The Respondent contends that the
products of the identified domestic comparators are not regulated under Section
801(a) of the Act; and that, as such, they are not appropriate comparators “in like
circumstances.”!? As regards NAFTA Article 1103, the Respondent submits that the
foreign comparators identified by Claimants cannot be considered to have been “in
like circumstances” when regard is had to the FDA’s analysis of the different factors
associated with the FDA’s decision to issue the Import Alert for foreign products

manufactured at the Etobicoke and Signet facilities.

8.17. The Parties’ competing positions are set out more fully and analysed by the Tribunal

below.

(6) “Less Favorable”

8.18. The Claimants submit that NAFTA tribunals have decided that the term “no less
favorable” means equivalent to, not better or worse than, the best treatment
accorded to the comparator.” > For this term’s application, the Claimants contend
that NAFTA tribunals have focused on the practical impact of the disputed

measure. *

8.19. The Claimants submit that an investor establishes a violation of NAFTA Articles
1102 and 1103 by demonstrating like circumstances and less favourable treatment in
relation to a single eligible comparator. The Claimants argue that NAFTA Articles
1102 and 1103 do not require a showing of class-based discrimination; 'S nor do they

require any showing of discriminatory intention. 6

“no less favorable”, or what a claimant must show to establish breach. Instead, the

Respondent concentrates its arguments on: (i) whether the Claimants, for the
purposes of NAFTA Article 1102, have identified domestic comparators based in
the USA which were in like circumstances with the Claimants and their investments
(it asserts they have not); and (ii) whether, for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1103,
the Respondent, as a factual matter, accorded to the Claimants or their investments
less favourable treatment than the US accorded to any foreign-based comparator in

like circumstances (it asserts it did not). 0

The Tribunal addresses these questions below. In doing so, the Tribunal proceeds on
the basis that for the Claimants (Apotex-Holdings for itself and for Apotex-US) to
succeed, they are required to prove, on the balance of the evidential record, that the
Respondent treated them or their investment less favourably, i.e. worse than, their
comparators who were in like circumstances. In this regard, the Tribunal considers
that the treatment complained of must have some not-insignificant practical

negative impact in order to lead to a breach of NAFTA Articles 1102 or 1103.

Comparators

For the purposes of the Claimants’ national treatment and most-favoured-nation
claims, the Claimants and their expert witnesses proposed a number of comparators
which were said to be in like circumstances to the Claimants and their investments.
The Claimants based their cases under NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 on the
treatment accorded to five comparators. Each of these five maintained generic drug
manufacturing facilities in the USA; three were domestic-based in the USA (on
which the Claimants relied for Article 1102) and two were foreign-based (on which
the Claimants relied for Article 1103). These two foreign-based comparators had
manufacturing facilities from which finished form drugs for human consumption

were exported to the USA subject to the Act.
The five comparators proposed by the Claimants were:

(a) Baxter Healthcare Corporation (USA-based, with facilities in Puerto Rico);
(b) L. Perrigo Company (USA-based, with facilities in Michigan);

(c) Hospira, Inc. (USA-based, with facilities in North Carolina);

8.26.

8.27.

(d) Novartis/Sandoz (Canada-based, with facilities in Boucherville, Quebec); and

(e) Teva (Israel-based, with facilities in Jerusalem).

These comparators were selected by the Claimants’ expert witnesses, Mr. Sheldon
T. Bradshaw and Mr. Ron M. Johnson, based on a review which they had conducted
of FDA warning letters and enforcement actions for cGMP issues with finished drug

products during the period from 2008 to 2011.

Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson testified that: “ ...comparable companies (or, put
another way, companies that are ‘in like circumstances’) are large generic drug
manufacturers of finished dosage forms (as opposed to Active Pharmaceutical
Ingredients) that have received an FDA Warning Letter during the 2008 — 2011 time
period citing violations of the drug cGMPs. Companies having violations that FDA
has, in fact, concluded are significant and serious, provide for like comparisons, i.e.
‘in like circumstances.’ While FDA does not consider issuance of a Warning Letter
a final agency action, a Warning Letter does represent an institutional FDA position,
i.e. that violations are significant and if uncorrected may lead to enforcement action.
All of the companies identified for comparison, and discussed below, received
Warning Letters from FDA for cGMP violations. Companies meeting the above
criteria were further evaluated to assess the comparability of treatment to that of
Apotex. The FDA website was searched to detect previous Warning Letters or other
FDA communications, adverse inspectional findings, public health advisories or
notifications, import alerts and/or notices of detention, and product recalls.
Company websites and government filings were also searched for this

information.”'®

For the purposes of NAFTA Article 1102, the Claimants relied on the treatment that
the Respondent accorded to the three domestic USA-based comparators: Baxter, L.
Perrigo and Hospira — each being a company that was subject to one or more
warning letters issued by the FDA in connection with their domestic facilities based

in the USA.

For the purposes of NAFTA Article 1103, the Claimants relied on the treatment the

Respondent accorded to the two foreign comparators: Sandoz and Teva — each

being recipients of one or more warning letters issued in connection with their

these five comparators and found cGMP violations similar in significance (although,
in their opinion, more serious) to those that the FDA inspectors had found at Apotex
Inc.’s facilities at Etobicoke and Signet. However, Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson
considered that the subsequent enforcement actions taken by the FDA in each of
these five cases differed materially from the treatment accorded to the Claimants
and their investments and were not remotely as severe as the Import Alert. Based on
their examination of the violations that had been identified by the FDA and the
treatment that resulted, Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson concluded that the “FDA’s
treatment of those companies was very different, i.e., significantly more favourable,

than the treatment afforded Apotex.”!?

Domestic Comparators

As stated above, in its defence to the Claimants’ claims under Article 1102, the
Respondent contends that the Claimants have failed to prove that the Claimants or
their investments were in “like circumstances” with any of their three domestic
comparators, being one of the essential elements required to establish any breach of

NAFTA Article 1102.

The Respondent submits that none of these three domestic comparators
manufactures products at foreign facilities for export to the USA; and that each

manufactured products for sale in the USA only from its US-based facilities.

The Respondent notes that drug products manufactured at domestic facilities within
the USA cannot be subject to Section 801(a) of the Act, import alerts or detentions
at the US border (without physical examination) unless these products are exported
and re-imported into the USA. The Respondent contends that the fact that products
from domestic facilities are never subject to such import alerts or detentions or,
even more generally, subject to the same legal and regulatory regime, shows clearly

that US manufacturers with US facilities are not in “like circumstances” with

foreign manufacturers with foreign facilities, such as Apotex Inc.’s two facilities in

Canada.

The Respondent submits that this territorial distinction which US law makes
between products produced at facilities outside the USA and those within the USA
is a critical part of the FDA’s ability to protect US consumers from foreign
adulterated products. According to the Respondent, the principal dissimilarity,
between the legal regimes applicable to drug products manufactured at domestic
facilities and those manufactured at foreign facilities, is that the FDA has the
administrative authority to refuse to admit foreign products into the USA if such
products appear to be adulterated, but for drugs manufactured domestically, the
FDA must first establish adulteration through judicial action in order to bar such

drugs from the US marketplace.

For the purpose of likeness of circumstance under NAFTA Article 1102, the
Claimants accept the requirement of a foreign investor and its domestic comparators
being subject to the same legal and regulatory regime. However, the Claimants
contend that the Respondent is wrong to reduce that regime to only one form of
enforcement measure, namely an import alert. The Claimants submit that the legal
and regulatory regime here constitutes the cGMP regulations; that, because US-
based and foreign facilities which manufacture drug products for the US market
must conform their operations to the same cGMP regulations, US-based and foreign

drug manufacturers are subject to the same regime.

The Claimants also contend that the Respondent improperly merges the separate
concepts of “treatment” and “circumstances” under NAFTA Article 1102. The
Claimants submit that the according of “treatment” by the host State is the active
verb and the central element in both NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103; that the
ordinary meaning of treatment is conduct, behaviour or action towards a person; and

that the phrase “‘in like circumstances” directly qualifies the verb “accord.”

The Claimants submit that the term “circumstances” denotes conditions or facts that
accompany or surround an action. Accordingly, so the Claimants submit, the
“action” in NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 is the according of treatment; the

circumstances are not the action, but the facts that accompany or determine the

Part VIII — Page 10 of 23

8.36.

8.37.

8.38.

20

 

action; and “treatment” and “circumstances”, as used in these provisions, cannot be
the same thing. Thus, the Claimants contend that the regulatory action (in this case,
the Import Alert) constitutes the treatment received; and it is not a circumstance to
be considered when assessing likeness of circumstances. The fact that Apotex Inc.
received differential, less favourable, treatment does not alter the conclusion that
Apotex Inc. or the Claimants were in like circumstances to domestic investors with

drug manufacturing facilities in the USA.

The Claimants further submit that the regulatory actions that the FDA can adopt
against non-cGMP-compliant drug manufacturers can take different forms. As Mr.
Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson testified: “FDA’s primary enforcement tools for
facilities located within the United States are Warning Letters, seizures, and
injunctions. FDA’s primary enforcement tools for facilities located outside the
United States are Warning Letters, detentions without physical examination, and
import alerts”,”” and “FDA could also use seizures and injunctions for products
produced at foreign facilities, but as a matter of practice it does so infrequently,
likely because it is easier for FDA to issue an import alert than obtain an injunction

or seizure.”*!

It follows, so the Claimants argue, that an import alert is just one enforcement
measure within the FDA’s arsenal to ensure CGMP compliance. It is true that import
alerts can be applied only to foreign manufacturers that offer drug products for
import into the USA. However, if a domestic drug manufacturer fails to comply
with cGMP requirements, the FDA can adopt alternative enforcement measures,
such as an injunction or seizure. Injunctions and seizures have the same effect as an
import alert: they prevent by law pharmaceutical drugs from being sold to patients

in the USA.

The Claimants assert that the legal regime in this case did not require the FDA to
issue the Import Alert in respect of Apotex Inc.’s two facilities. Rather, the FDA
had a discretion whether to bar Apotex Inc.’s products from the US market by
imposing an import alert or to achieve the same result by seeking an injunction or

seizure (subject to establishing jurisdiction). By placing products from Etobicoke

and Signet on import alert, the Respondent afforded the Claimants less favourable
treatment compared to Baxter, L. Perrigo and Hospira. Because of the Import Alert,
the Claimants were prevented from selling any products manufactured at Etobicoke
and Signet during a period of almost two years. By contrast, the FDA did not
prevent Baxter, L. Perrigo or Hospira, from selling their products in the USA, even
though these products were manufactured at US-based facilities that failed to

comply with cGMP regulations.

In the result, the Claimants contend that they received less favourable treatment than
these three domestic comparators and that the Respondent thus breached the

national treatment standard under NAFTA Article 1102.

The Tribunal’s Analysis as to NAFTA Article 1102

For the reasons set out below, the Tribunal decides that none of the three domestic
comparators proposed by the Claimants is “in like circumstances” to the Claimants

or their investments for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1102.

The Respondent’s defence to the Claimants’ case under Article 1102 (on the merits)
is that the three domestic comparators proposed by the Claimants were not in like
circumstances to the Claimants and their investments.” As already summarised
above, this defence is based on the different legal and regulatory regimes applicable
to domestic and foreign facilities, including the fact that drug products
manufactured by domestic comparators could not be subject to import alerts or
detentions (without physical examination) under the Act unless they were exported

and re-imported into the USA.

The Parties did not take issue with the concept expressed by the Pope & Talbot

tribunal, that “‘circumstances’ are context dependent and have no unalterable

923

meaning across the spectrum of fact situations.”~ In addition, the Parties accepted,

» Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson testified that these comparators were selected because they “ ...were unable
to uncover any instance of an FDA warning letter or enforcement action concerning cGMP violations at any
manufacturing facilities outside of US territory of a US-owned company manufacturing finished dosage forms
for human consumption.” First Expert Report of Sheldon T. Bradshaw and Ron M. Johnson, Para. 111. In its

Rejoinder, the Respondent identified a US company, Pfizer Inc., whose foreign subsidiari

US subsidiaries and which received a warning letter dated 27 March 2013, post-dating Mr. Bradshaw’s and Mr.
Johnson’s first report.

as the Archer Daniels tribunal put it, that “all ‘circumstances’ in which the
treatment was accorded are to be taken into account in order to identify the
appropriate comparator. 4 These obviously include the legal and regulatory regime
that governs parties that are being compared for the purposes of NAFTA Article
1102.

It is common ground that all of the three domestic comparators proposed by the
Claimants were in the same sector as the Claimants, sold like drug products to those
sold by Apotex Inc., and were direct competitors in the US market. In these
circumstances, in the Tribunal’s view, the question of whether the Claimants and
their investments were subject to the same legal regime or regulatory requirements
(to those to which the identified US-comparators were subject) becomes an

important potential differentiator.

As a Canadian drug manufacturer, Apotex Inc. is primarily regulated and controlled
by Health Canada and not the FDA.”> Its Canadian facilities have been inspected
regularly by Health Canada since the mid-1970’s. Canadian manufacturers such as
Apotex Inc. are obliged to comply with what are known in Canada as good
manufacturing practices.”° Foreign firms (i.e. non-US firms), such as Apotex Inc.
are, generally speaking, under no obligation to comply with US regulations. Such
compliance is militated only by their desire to market their products in the USA and
by commitments they may have made in applications filed with the FDA.”’ Because
Apotex Inc. supplies the US market, inter alia, it needs to ensure that its systems
address the Respondent’s requirements for the proper design, manufacturing and
control of manufacturing processes of its facilities which supply the US market,

such as the FDA’s cGMP.

Unsurprisingly, the relevant law and practice recognise and provide for differences

between domestic and foreign facilities as regards the inspection by the FDA of

such facilities, and the tools available to the FDA for the enforcement of the cGMP.

standard.

Section 704(a)(1) of the Act authorises the FDA to:

(a) “enter, at reasonable times, any factory, warehouse, or establishment in
which ... drugs ... are manufactured, processed, packed, or held, for
introduction in interstate commerce or after such introduction, or to enter

any vehicle, being used to transport or hold such ... products”; and

 

(b) “inspect, at reasonable times and within reasonable limits and in a
reasonable manner, such factory, warehouse, establishment, or vehicle and
all pertinent equipment, finished and unfinished materials, containers, and

labeling therein.”

The FDA’s statutory inspection authority extends to: “records, files, papers,
processes, controls, and facilities” bearing on whether drugs are adulterated or
misbranded, or are otherwise in violation of the Act.2? In addition, companies that
hold FDA-approved NDAs and ANDAs are required to maintain certain records;
and FDA investigators are authorised “to have access to and copy and verify such
records.”*° The Act requires the FDA to inspect drug manufacturing establishments
at least once every two years.*! However, due to limited resources and the
significant increase in foreign drug products imported into the USA, the FDA has
experienced difficulties in meeting this statutory requirement. The FDA’s program
for inspecting foreign drug manufacturers differs in a number of respects from that
for inspecting domestic drug manufacturers, and the FDA “strives to ensure that it ...
informs the prospective inspection staff of the differences in the foreign vs.

domestic drug inspection programs.”

An important distinction between drug manufacturers located in the territory of the
USA and those located abroad is that the former are directly subject to the
jurisdiction of the FDA. Thus, under the terms of Section 704(a)(1) of the Act, the
FDA has authority to enter US drug manufacturing facilities, at reasonable times,
without the need for agreeing and scheduling such an inspection in advance. By
comparison, the FDA, being a US regulator, obviously has no unilateral authority to

enter and carry out an inspection of premises located on foreign territory.

As the FDA observes in its Guide to Inspections of Foreign Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers (the “Guide”), its ability to inspect foreign drug facilities does not
come from Section 704 of the Act (which confers jurisdiction over domestic
facilities), but from the FDA’s ability to invoke Section 801 of the Act and also
from commitments made by sponsors or holders of NDAs and ANDAs. For that
reason, “ ...the agency is not required to provide stringent documentary evidence to
establish violations of the Act.”*? Section 801(a) of the Act states that a drug offered
for import into the United States “shall be refused admission” by the Agency if it
“appears” that such drug, among other things, “is adulterated, misbranded, or in

violation of section 355” of the Act.**

As a result, the FDA’s Guide instructs FDA inspectors, as follows: “During the
inspection of a foreign drug manufacturer, it is not necessary to obtain the same
level of documentation expected from a domestic inspection to establish evidence of
GMP violations or data integrity problems. The agency has the authority under [the
Act] to administratively restrict the importation of a product without demonstrating
the adulteration of the product. The burden of proof is placed on the importing
party.”*° Similarly, the FDA’s Guide to International Inspections and Travel
instructs FDA inspectors that: “[i]n general, fewer exhibits are usually required for

international Els [i.e. Establishment Inspections] than for domestic Els.”*°

In the Tribunal’s view, the decisive difference in the legal and regulatory regime

that governs foreign products manufactured outside the USA and those that are

manufactured at USA-based facilities is that Section 801(a) does not apply to
domestic products that are manufactured in the USA, regardless of whether the
manufacturing facilities are US-owned or foreign-owned (unless the products are
exported and then re-imported into the USA). Import Alert 66-40 operates in
conjunction with Section 801(a) of the Act, which authorises FDA district offices to
detain at the US border, without physical examination, foreign drug products that
“appear” to be adulterated because they were not manufactured in conformity with

current good manufacturing practice.

It is evident that the FDA’s ability to restrict access to the US markets of products
manufactured at foreign facilities that appear to be adulterated is more easily
achieved through the use of an Import Alert 66-40 in conjunction with Section
801(a) of the Act, than under Section 704 of the Act. It is quite a different thing for
the FDA to form an impression of adulteration as a result of an inspection than to
establish that adulteration through a formal adjudicative process in the US courts, as

it must for domestically manufactured products.

To the Tribunal’s mind, the differences in the FDA’s ability to deny access to the
US market as between foreign and domestically manufactured drugs are substantial;
and that these constitute a material distinction between the legal and regulatory
regimes applicable to foreign and domestic manufacturing facilities. These
differences go to “like circumstances”, rather than to “treatment” and the Import

Alert of 28 August 2009 itself.

The observations of the Grand River tribunal concerning “like circumstances” for
the purposes of NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103 are here helpful and apposite. The
Grand River tribunal confirmed that the appropriate comparators under NAFTA
Article 1102 (and Article 1103) are those that are subject to like legal
requirements.*” After canvassing several NAFTA Chapter Eleven decisions, the
Grand River tribunal decided: “While each case involved its own facts, tribunals
have assigned important weight to ‘like legal requirements’ in determining whether
there were ‘like circumstances.’ The ADF tribunal thus emphasized that both the

claimant and its U.S. competitors were subject to the same U.S. ‘Buy America’

provisions. Pope & Talbot found that the relevant comparators were lumber
exporters subject to the same restrictive legal regime as the claimant, so there was
no denial of national treatment if exporters in other unregulated provinces were not
so limited. Feldman v. Mexico found the relevant comparators for purposes of MFN.
analysis to be a limited group of cigarette exporters subject to the same legal
requirements as the claimant. The Methanex tribunal (citing Pope & Talbot)
emphasized the importance of assuring that purported comparators face similar
regulatory requirements. Looking at the question from the other direction, UPS v.
Canada found a key difference between the parties there to be that Canada Post was
subject to legal requirements under national law and international postal agreements

that did not affect UPS.”**

The Pope & Talbot tribunal formulated a test, in the context of its analysis of “like
circumstances”, that: “[d]ifferences in treatment will presumptively violate Article
1102(2), unless they have a reasonable nexus to rational government policies that
(1) do not distinguish, on their face or de facto, between foreign-owned and
domestic companies, and (2) do not otherwise unduly undermine the investment

liberalizing objectives of NAFTA.”

The Tribunal considers that Section 801(a) of the Act (with the guidance as to
import alerts thereunder) passes this test. Both protect the public health of US
residents and patients, do not distinguish between companies or facilities on the
basis of nationality and are consistent with the investment objectives of NAFTA’s
Chapter Eleven. Indeed, as the Claimants acknowledge, the FDA is not the primary
regulator outside of the territory of the USA; and the FDA does not have the
resources to examine every drug product made abroad that is offered for import into

the USA.

In this arbitration, the only measure challenged by the Claimants is the Import Alert
of 28 August 2009, namely the FDA’s decision to place Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke
and Signet facilities on Import Alert 66-40. When, as here, the only domestic

comparators proposed by the Claimants could never have been subject to any

similar measure, the Tribunal considers it to be impermissible to contend that such

comparators are in “like circumstances” to the Claimants and their investments.

Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that there is no basis to accept the Claimants’
case that placing the Import Alert on Apotex Inc.’s Etobicoke and Signet facilities
constituted a breach by the Respondent of NAFTA Article 1102’s national treatment
standard. The Tribunal therefore dismisses all claims made under NAFTA Article

1102 in this arbitration by Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US).

Foreign Comparators and the Tribunal’s Analysis as to NAFTA Article 1103

In its Counter-Memorial, the Respondent accepted that Sandoz (Canada) and Teva
(Jerusalem) are “...potential comparators for Apotex’s most-favored-nation
treatment claim under Article 1103...”*° In its Rejoinder, however, the Respondent
contended that these foreign facilities were not in like circumstances to the
Claimants and their Canadian facilities.*! At the Hearing, the Tribunal understood
that the Respondent did not accept that Teva or Sandoz, or their respective foreign-
based facilities, were appropriate comparators for the purposes of NAFTA Article

1103.

It is possible here to address this part of the Parties’ respective cases succinctly,
given the Tribunal’s factual summaries regarding Teva and Sandoz in Part IIT and
also the Tribunal’s legal analysis regarding NAFTA Article 1102 above which
applies, mutatis mutandis, to NAFTA Article 1103.

In short, the Tribunal decides that both Teva and Sandoz are prima facie appropriate
comparators for the purposes of NAFTA Article 1103. In the Tribunal’s view, the
US legal and regulatory regime, as to import alerts and detention (without physical
examination) to which these foreign manufacturers, their foreign-based facilities
and their foreign products were exposed, was materially the same regime to which
the Claimants (Apotex Inc.) were subject in Canada as regards the Etobicoke and

Signet facilities and their products.

8.63.

8.65.

8.66.

As regards “treatment”, the Tribunal has already decided that both Teva and Sandoz
were treated more favourably than the Claimants (Apotex Inc.) as regards Import
Alert 66-40: see the Tribunal’s conclusions stated for each of these comparators in

Part III Above.

Accordingly, the remaining questions under NAFTA Article 1103 are whether
either Teva or Sandoz or their respective foreign facilities were indeed “in like
circumstances” to the Claimants (Apotex Inc.) and the Etobicoke and Signet
facilities within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1103 and, if so, whether the
Respondent breached its obligations under NAFTA Article 1103.

It is necessary here to return to the legal and evidential standards of proof
considered earlier in this Part VIII, applied to the evidence adduced in this
arbitration and its probative value assessed by the Tribunal under Article 41(1) of

the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Claimants as regards these remaining questions have
sufficiently discharged their evidential burden of proof so as to place the evidential
burden of rebutting their case upon the Respondent. In other words, in the absence
of such rebuttal, the Tribunal considers that Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for
Apotex-US) would succeed, as to liability, on their claims against the Respondent

under NAFTA Article 1103.

This results from the totality of the evidence on these questions adduced by the
Claimants in this arbitration; but it also accords with a procedural aspect inherent in
this form of investor-state arbitration. Whilst Articles 40 and 41(2) of the ICSID
Arbitration AF Rules permit an investor-claimant to request documentation from a
respondent State, there is no Anglo-Saxon form of automatic discovery of all
potentially relevant documentation. Where crucial documents are properly withheld
by a respondent State on grounds of strict confidentiality or other like privilege and
not ordered for production by a tribunal (on those grounds), how then can the
claimant investor discharge the legal burden of proving its positive case under
NAFTA Article 1103 in regard to factual matters essentially within the exclusive

domain of the respondent State?

Part VIII — Page 19 of 23

8.67.

8.68.

8.69.

For example, the Respondent submitted that Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Johnson (as
expert witnesses called by the Claimants) were wrong to suggest that the FDA
applied its discretion in an arbitrary manner: “It is always easy to second-guess, to
draw inferences from incomplete facts, to see the world in black and white. But
FDA does not have the luxury to choose black and white, to always prioritize drug
safety over drug availability. FDA has to make difficult choices, and it is not always
clear to those outside looking in to understand what factors tilted the scale in one

direction or the other.”

In the absence of Anglo-Saxon discovery, how does
investor-state arbitration under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven provide a fair procedure
for a claimant, as an outsider with incomplete facts, to discharge the legal burden of

proving its case?

In the Tribunal’s view, the answer must be that at some stage the evidential burden
of proof shifts towards the respondent State and requires it to rebut the evidence
adduced by the claimant. Otherwise, the claimant would be left to prove its case
from whatever incomplete documentary evidence and witness testimony the
respondent State may choose to present. That burden would be, invariably, an
almost impossible task. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers, as regards the
Respondent’s remaining defences under NAFTA Article 1103 and given the

procedural history of this arbitration, that such stage has here been reached.

The Respondent first emphasises the great responsibilities entrusted to the FDA and
exercised in its discretion as a specialist and skilled regulator of long-standing and
great repute. The Respondent submits that the FDA is required necessarily to
exercise a difficult regulatory discretion lying at the heart of its important mandate
on public health; and that this discretion as to enforcement actions is never a binary
choice, but depends on many factors particular to the specific situation. The
Respondent submits that the Claimants’ case would effectively require, whenever
the FDA found significant cGMP violations with respect to a facility, to take the
same enforcement action that it has taken against another company with cGMP
violations “regardless of the specific nature of the violations and any factors
weighing for and against such action with respect to the particular facility and drugs

concerned. Either it [the FDA] has to bar all products from noncompliant facilities,

© TD6.1710-1711.

8.70.

8.71.

8.72.

: p 43
or it can bar none of them.”*

According to the Respondent, this would mean that
the FDA would have to ignore the many factors it routinely considers when
exercising that discretion; that it would radically alter the way that the FDA
operates; and that it would also have serious implications for the import and sale of

drug products in the USA and public health.

The FDA’s discretionary exercise in regard to import alerts was described by Dr.
Rosa in his testimony. He described the FDA’s use of a “risk-based approach” when
determining whether to take enforcement action, where the relevant factors
included: the seriousness of the violations; the public health risks of those
violations; the company’s prior history of and responses to violations (including
voluntary corrective actions); and whether drug products may be medically
necessary or in short supply.** It is this last factor which, in the Tribunal’s view

plays a decisive role in this case.

As summarised in Part III above, the Tribunal concludes that the evidence adduced
in this arbitration proves that the FDA’s different treatment of Teva was materially
influenced by the FDA’s genuine concerns over shortages of essential drugs
manufactured at Teva’s Jerusalem facility intended for shipment and sale in the
USA. The Tribunal has also there referred to the testimony of Dr. Rosa; and it
suffices only to add here that the Tribunal found him to be an impressive and
reliable witness, both in his written testimony and during his oral evidence at the

Hearing. The Tribunal accepts this evidence.

The evidence in regard to Sandoz is less straightforward, for reasons already
described by the Tribunal in Part III. The Tribunal rejects the Claimants’ submission
that adverse inferences should be drawn against the Respondent for the paucity of
the evidence tendered in support of its case. The Respondent considered itself under
a legal impediment which prevented it from adducing relevant evidence in this
arbitration. Conversely, however, in such circumstances the Tribunal does not
consider that it should draw any positive inference in favour of the Respondent in
discharging its evidential burden of proof. To the contrary, whilst the Respondent is

not to be blamed for these missing evidential pieces in its jigsaw defence, the fact

8.75.

remains that its jigsaw is materially incomplete with a likely mass of documentation
and numerous factual witnesses unavailable to be heard by the Tribunal in this

arbitration, as to which the Respondent must accept the legal consequence.

Apart from the publicly available materials relating to Sandoz/Novartis, there was,
however, one factual witness from the FDA who did testify before the Tribunal: Dr.
Rosa. As summarised in Part III above, Dr. Rosa could testify of his own knowledge
that the FDA’s different treatment of Sandoz/Novartis was materially influenced by
the FDA’s genuine concerns over shortages of essential drugs manufactured at
Sandoz’s Boucherville facility intended for shipment and sale in the USA. The

Tribunal accepts this evidence.

The Claimants have much criticised the FDA for its “rush to judgment”, at times
bordering on allegations of malign bad faith. The Tribunal readily understands the
strong sense of grievance felt by the Claimants in regard to the period from 17
August to 28 August 2009. The Tribunal nonetheless does not accept this criticism.
From the FDA’s perspective, its discretionary process began no later than December
2008 with the Etobicoke inspection and the FDA inspectors’ findings of serious
cGMP violations. As Dr. Rosa testified, the FDA had considered an import alert in
early 2009 but did not do so because it wished to inspect the Signet facility and
complete a drug-shortage analysis in regard to products manufactured by Apotex

Inc. (which confirmed no relevant drug-shortage).*°

The Tribunal also rejects any suggestion that the FDA especially targeted or sought
to discriminate against the Claimants, based on the public speeches of its senior
officers described in Part III. In the Tribunal’s view, there was a change of policy in
early 2009 under the Respondent’s new political administration intended to resume
stricter and swifter enforcement practices by the FDA, not limited to the Claimants.
Under NAFTA Article 1103, there is no general bar to such a change in policy in
regulatory practice made in good faith and in a non-arbitrary manner (as this was).

In any event, based on Dr. Rosa’s evidence, the Tribunal does not consider that the

FDA’s exercise of discretion towards the Claimants was materially influenced by

this policy change, although it was not of course inconsistent with that new policy.*®

The Tribunal accepts that the FDA was also influenced, to a lesser extent, by the
failure of the Claimants (Apotex Inc.) to take more extensive voluntary action
during the telephone conference-call with the FDA on 17 August 2019 and, as Dr.
Rosa described Apotex Inc., for being “out of control.” This also materially
distinguishes Apotex Inc. from Teva and Sandoz. However, as with the legal term
“adulterated” drugs, the Tribunal infers that Dr. Rosa was here using an FDA term
of art and not literally suggesting that Apotex Inc. was actually out of control. In the
Tribunal’s view, Dr. Rosa was only describing the failure of Apotex Inc.’s senior
management to understand by mid-August 2009 the gravity of what the FDA
inspectors had found at both the Etobicoke and Signet facilities, requiring a much

stronger and immediate voluntary response from Apotex Inc. towards the FDA.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal determines that the Respondent has proven that
Teva and Sandoz (with their respective foreign-based facilities and foreign
products) were not in like circumstances to the Claimants and the Etobicoke and
Signet facilities and their products, within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1103.
The Tribunal therefore rejects all claims against the Respondent under NAFTA
Article 1103 by Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US).

Conclusion

Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses, on the merits, all claims made by Apotex-
Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US) under both NAFTA Articles 1102 and
1103. It follows that, if the Tribunal had accepted jurisdiction over the claims made
by Apotex Inc. in this arbitration, the Tribunal would also have dismissed all its

claims, on the merits, under both NAFTA Articles 1102 and 1103.

PART IX - NAFTA ARTICLE 1105

Introduction

The Tribunal here addresses the fourth principal issue relating to NAFTA Article
1105(1), NAFTA Article 1103 and Article (2) and II(6) of the Jamaica-USA BIT.
As earlier with Part VIII, although the Tribunal has upheld the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections to all claims made by Apotex Inc. in Part VII, it
nonetheless remains convenient here to refer to the claims made by Apotex-
Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US) as the Claimants’ claims. The Tribunal
considers first NAFTA Article 1105(1) and, in the light of its analysis and decisions,
turns to NAFTA Article 1103 and the Jamaica-USA BIT at the end of this Part IX.

NAFTA Article 1105(1): NAFTA Article 1105(1) requires that: “Each Party shall
accord to investments of investors of another Party treatment in accordance with
international law, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and

security.”

On 31 July 2001, the NAFTA Free Trade Commission adopted the following Note
of Interpretation regarding the minimum standard of treatment under Article
1105(1), entitled “Minimum Standard of Treatment in Accordance with
International Law”: “(1) Article 1105(1) prescribes the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens as the minimum standard of treatment to
be afforded to investments of investors of another Party. (2) The concepts of ‘fair
and equitable treatment’ and ‘full protection and security’ do not require treatment
in addition to or beyond that which is required by the customary international law
minimum standard of treatment of aliens. (3) A determination that there has been a
breach of another provision of the NAFTA, or of a separate international agreement,

does not establish that there has been a breach of Article 1105(1).”

Under NAFTA Article 1131(2), an interpretation by the Free Trade Commission of
a NAFTA provision “shall be binding on a Tribunal established under this Section.”
The Tribunal, of course, accepts in this proceeding the binding effect of this Note of

Interpretation.

Jamaica-USA BIT: The Tribunal refers to the text of Article II(2)(b) and Article
II(6) of the BIT set out in Part IV above, together with the text of NAFTA Article
1103.

The Tribunal considers that Apotex-Holdings, as the party alleging a breach of
NAFTA Article 1105(1) and Article II of the BIT, bears the legal burden of proving

its case.

The Claimants’ Case

In summary, as regards NAFTA Article 1105(1), the Claimants allege that the
Respondent breached its minimum standard of treatment “by adopting the import
alert with no prior notice to Apotex [the Claimants], no possibility for Apotex to
prepare a defense, no opportunity for Apotex to present its position and no decision

by an impartial administrative authority.

The Claimants contend that customary international law requires “that
administrative authorities must afford certain procedural safeguards in deciding the
rights and interests of individual parties. Recent State practice further reinforces this

conclusion.”*

Thus, in the Claimants’ submission, “the rule of law translates today
into certain procedural requirements for the deployment of legal process that include
the right to a hearing before a decision is made, the right to have the decision made
in an unbiased and impartial fashion, the right to know the basis of the decision so
that it can be contested, the right to reasons for the official’s decision, and the right
to a decision that is reasonably justified by all relevant legal and factual
considerations. And in order to make these rights effective one must add the right to

have the validity of the decision tested in a court of law.”

The Claimants contend that each of these procedural requirements is required by the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens;* and that the
Import Alert was adopted by the Respondent in disregard of these requirements. The

Claimants maintain that they were not given prior notice® and had no opportunity to

present evidence and witnesses before being placed on Import Alert;® the decision
to adopt the Import Alert was made by partial FDA officers and not by any impartial
decision-maker;’ no reasons were given by the Respondent for adopting the Import
Alert;® the administrative remedies available to the Claimants were ineffectual;” and

the Claimants could not dispute the FDA’s decision in the US courts. 10

In support of their case that these procedural requirements are part of customary
international law, the Claimants rely heavily upon the provisions of Section 181 of
the American Law Institute’s Restatement (Second) of Foreign Relations Law of the
United States (“the Second Restatement”). In the Claimants’ submission, Section
181 sets out rules of customary international law regarding the treatment of aliens

that govern their claim.

As excerpted by the Claimants, Section 181 of the Second Restatement provides:
“TA] trial or other proceeding to determine the rights or liabilities of an alien must
be fair. In determining whether the proceeding is fair, it is relevant to consider,

among other factors whether the alien has had the benefit of
(a) An impartial ... administrative authority,

(b) Adequate information with respect to the nature of the proceedings so as to

permit the alien to present his claim or defense,

(d) Reasonable opportunity to contest evidence against him,

(e) Reasonable opportunity to obtain and present witnesses and evidence in his

own behalf, .. vl

The Respondent’s Case

In summary, the Respondent raises three principal arguments as regards NAFTA
Article 1105(1). First, the Respondent contends that the relevant rules of customary
international law do not require States to give prior notice and a hearing to a foreign
drug manufacturer before blocking imports of its products that they consider to be
adulterated. In the Respondent’s submission, there is no legal authority for the
existence of the Claimants’ asserted rules of customary international law,
contending that the Claimants did not present any state practice or opinio juris
supporting their asserted customary tules,'? as the Claimants were bound to do as
the proponent of these alleged tules.'? The Respondent also maintains that the
Claimants failed to address past decisions and awards made under NAFTA’s
Chapter Eleven which contradict the Claimants’ case; and that Article 1105(1)
embraces only the treatment of investments (not investors), so that “only those rules
of State responsibility that relate to a foreign investor’s economic stake or property
interests in the host State inform the minimum standard of treatment obligation in

Article 1105(1).”!*

Second, the Respondent contends that the Claimants incorrectly seek to import
tights available to aliens under international law for trials and other formal
adjudicative proceedings into “general administrative decision-making outside of
adjudication.”'° In this regard, the Respondent maintains that the provisions of the
Second Restatement (as invoked by the Claimants) address trials and other
adjudicatory proceedings, but not administrative decision-making. The Respondent
also referred to several prior NAFTA and ICSID awards indicating that deference
should be given by international tribunals to States in their exercise of regulatory

decision-making. 6

Finally, the Respondent maintains, on the facts, that the Claimants were accorded or

had available extensive procedural safeguards. In the Respondent’s contention, the

Claimants had sufficient opportunities to ascertain the reasons for the Import Alert
and to contest the FDA’s decision to impose it; but the Claimants chose not to
utilise the means available to contest this decision.’ In the Respondent’s
submission, it is an inherent contradiction for the Claimants to claim in this
proceeding that they could not contest the decision, when at the time the Claimants

had not even attempted to utilise any of the remedies available to them to do so.!8

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decision

The Tribunal initially considers whether the specific procedural rights invoked by
the Claimants are part of any evolving “customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens” that a NAFTA Party must accord to the investments

of another Party’s investors as required by NAFTA Article 1105(1).

The Parties agree that the prohibition on denial of justice has acquired the status of
customary international law and is among the protections embraced within the
required minimum standard of treatment of aliens. 19 However, the claim here is not
framed as being for denial of justice under international law. Instead, it is that
customary international law requires a State to accord to aliens several specific
types of procedural protections in connection with that State’s regulatory action
affecting imports of drug products manufactured in aliens’ facilities located in a
foreign country. The Claimants maintain that customary international law, forming
part of NAFTA Article 1105(1), guarantees such aliens the right to “effective
means” of redress “different from, and less demanding than, denial of justice under

customary international law.”

In support of their case, the Claimants cite extensive scholarly commentaries urging
in general terms that due process is required by customary international law. The
Claimants also identify a number of countries that have adopted laws regulating
administrative procedure as part of their national laws. However, the Tribunal
considers that the Claimants have not presented sufficient evidence of state practice

or opinio juris indicating that States recognise an obligation to extend the specific

procedural rights claimed here to aliens in connection with regulators’ decisions
affecting the importation of drug products manufactured abroad in the aliens’
foreign facilities. Nor have the Claimants, in the Tribunal’s view, identified any
prior decisions of NAFTA and other international tribunals recognising the asserted
principles of customary international law in circumstances comparable to those

presented in the present case.

The Claimants nonetheless contend that several procedural rights listed in Section
181 of the Second Restatement are required by customary international law. In the
Claimants’ submission “these requirements are part of the ‘international standard of
justice’ resulting from the ‘applicable principles of international law’” and reflect
“established customary international law as it existed in 1965.”7! In the Claimants’
submission, because the cited elements of Section 181 then reflected accepted
principles of customary international law defining the rights of aliens, no further
evidence of state practice and opinio juris is now necessary to confirm their status:
“[T]he U.S. errs in suggesting that Apotex must demonstrate State practice and
opinio juris in the specific context of the due process safeguards for drug
importation Measures. This is not the way that customary international law works.
No showing at such a level of granularity is required. The existence of the general
tule recognized by the Restatement is sufficient. That rule is, as Apotex has already
demonstrated, sufficiently flexible to apply to a wide variety of contexts, including
this one.” Thus, the Claimants’ claims under NAFTA Article 1105(1) rest heavily
on the contention that the cited elements of Section 181 of the Second Restatement
reflect generally accepted rules of customary international law binding upon the
FDA’s decisions to impose import alerts affecting the drug products of foreign

manufacturers.

The Tribunal considers that this to be an incorrect understanding of Section 181.
Section 181 draws heavily on the provisions of Article 7 of the 1961 revision by
Professors Sohn and Baxter of the 1929 Harvard Draft Convention on

Responsibility of States for Damage Done on Their Territory to the Person or

*" Id., Para. 461.

Property of Aliens”? addressing aliens’ rights in proceedings before tribunals and
administrative authorities. Article 6 of the 1961 draft, captioned “Denial of Access
to a Tribunal or an Administrative Tribunal,” provides that denial of an alien’s
“right to initiate, or to participate in, proceedings in a tribunal or an administrative
authority to determine his civil rights or obligations is wrongful” if certain
conditions are met. Article 7, captioned “Denial of a Fair Hearing” then lists
“relevant” factors to consider in determining whether a hearing is fair. These
include such factors as the availability of compulsory process to obtain witnesses
and evidence, free or assisted legal representation on the same basis as provided to
nationals, services of an interpreter if the alien cannot “fully understand or speak the
language used in the tribunal,” and the presence of a representative of the alien’s

government “at any judicial or administrative proceeding.”

Section 181 mirrors Article 7 of the Sohn/Baxter draft in emphasising procedures
involving formal adjudication of an alien’s rights. The section appears in a chapter
of the Second Restatement entitled “Inadequate Administration of Law” that
contains two topics: “Denial of Procedural Justice” (Sections 178-182) and “Failure
to Protect from Private Injury” (Section 183). Section 178 defines denial of
procedural justice as relating to “enforcement of the state’s law as it affects the alien
in criminal, civil, or administrative proceedings ...” Section 179 deals with arrest
and detention, indicating (inter alia) that there is denial of procedural justice if an
arrested alien is not granted a trial without unreasonable delay. Section 180(1)
provides that “[flailure to afford to an alien an appropriate trial or other legal
proceeding for the determination of his rights or liabilities is a denial of procedural
justice.” Section 182 concludes that “[a]n adverse determination that is manifestly
unjust in a proceeding determining criminal charges against an alien, or determining

his rights and liabilities of a civil nature, is a denial of procedural justice.”

As cited above, the first sentence of Section 181 directs that “a trial or other
proceeding to determine the rights of liabilities of an alien must be fair.” The second
sentence then sets out several factors “relevant to consider” in assessing whether a

given proceeding is fair, which merit reciting again: “In determining whether the

Restatement.

9.22.

proceeding is fair, it is relevant to consider, among other factors whether the alien

has had the benefit of
(a) An impartial tribunal or administrative authority,

(b) Adequate information with respect to the nature of the proceedings so as to

permit the alien to present his claim or defense,

(c) Adequate interpretation and translation into his own language at all stages of

the proceeding,
(d) Reasonable opportunity to contest evidence against him,

(e) Reasonable opportunity to obtain and present witnesses and evidence in his

own behalf,

(f) Reasonable opportunity to communicate with a representative of his

government with respect to the proceedings,

(g) Reasonable opportunity to consult counsel and time to prepare for the

proceeding, and

(h) Reasonable dispatch by the tribunal or administrative authority in reaching a

determination.”

In the Tribunal’s view, these inter-connected provisions of the Second Restatement
indicate two things. First, the wording throughout emphasises criminal, civil or
administrative proceedings of a formal adjudicative character. The alien is to be
given information “with respect to the nature of the proceedings,” given “reasonable
opportunity to obtain and present witnesses” and the like, all wording conveying the
sense of adjudicatory proceedings. Indeed, the provisions requiring interpretation
and translation into the alien’s language “at all stages of the proceeding” and the
opportunity for the alien to meet a representative of the alien’s government “with
respect to the proceedings” only make sense in the context of such proceedings.
They do not make sense in the context of the regulatory decision-making at issue in

this case.

Part IX — Page 8 of 27

9.23.

9.24.

9.25.

Second, more importantly, it is clear that the eight elements listed in Section 181 are
not free-standing rules of customary international law. Rather, these are only
“factors” that are “relevant” “in determining whether the proceeding is fair.” This is
far short of showing that each factor reflects an existing rule of customary

international law.

Moreover, the Reporters’ Notes to Section 181 make clear that not every factor
applies to every situation; and that their application varies significantly, depending
upon context: “[I]t is clear that they [the factors] are not all required in all types of
proceedings. The extent to which the specific safeguards indicated in this Section
[181] may be requisite for a fair trial or other proceeding will depend primarily on
(1) the seriousness of the consequences to the alien, and (2) the extent to which the
exercise of administrative discretion is reasonably involved in the determination of
the case. In a criminal trial involving a severe penalty or in a civil trial involving a
substantial claim, each of the safeguards is normally essential. In an administrative
proceeding to determine, for example, the issuance or revocation of a license to
engage in a particular occupation, the specific safeguards may not all be necessary
or practicable. Other examples of administrative proceedings in which the
circumstances may not call for each of the specific safeguards are the granting or
denying of a variance under a zoning ordinance, the granting and termination of
parole to a convicted criminal, the exercise of executive clemency, the waiver or
assessment of a penalty for overdue taxes, the granting of a permit to travel in a

restricted area, and the granting of a public utility franchise.””4

Thus, the Tribunal concludes that the specific elements of Section 181 of the
Second Restatement are not free-standing rules of customary international law that
constitute part of the international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens. As
already noted above, the Claimants contend that they do not need to adduce
evidence of state practice and opinio juris to show the existence of a rule of
customary international law, because Section 181 offered a sufficient statement of
settled customary principles. However, Section 181 involves factors for assessing

“fairness,” not rules of customary international law. It does not therefore assist the

Comment B, at p. 545.

9.28.

Claimants’ case; and indeed, for a text dating from almost 50 years ago, it might be
thought by many to be surprising if it did. Thus, it is next necessary for the Tribunal
to consider whether there is support in state practice and opinio juris for ascribing

greater legal weight to any of the elements invoked by the Claimants.

The Claimants cite scholarly commentaries contending, generally at a high level of
abstraction, that customary international law requires due process. The Claimants
also cite the administrative procedure laws adopted by certain countries, the practice
of European multi-national institutions and the domestic and treaty practice of the

USA, in support of their proposition that States provide protections for due process.

However, the issues before the Tribunal are not whether the abstract notion of due
process has acquired sufficient status in customary international law, but whether
the specific procedural protections claimed by the Claimants in this case are
required by customary international law, particularly whether those protections are
part of the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens
required by NAFTA Article 1105(1). In the Tribunal’s view, the state practice
available to the Tribunal in the specific context presented here, namely the
regulation of imported drug products, weighs heavily against the assertion that the

claimed protections are required by customary international law.

For example, in August 2011, Health Canada announced that it had limited imports
to Canada of certain drugs manufactured by Ben Venue Laboratories in Bedford,
Ohio, USA (“BVL”), on account of “deficiencies in the area of Good
Manufacturing Practices (GMP)” at the BVL manufacturing facility. “In light of
these deficiencies, Health Canada is allowing only the importation of drugs deemed
medically necessary.” In November 2011, the European Medicines Agency’s
Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use also called for limits and recalls
of drug products supplied by BVL, except for medicines “absolutely essential to

meet patients’ needs ... and which are currently not available from another

source.””° Thus, as the Claimants’ legal experts point out “other regulators (in
Canada and the EU) imposed a ban [sic] on Ben Venue’s products.”?” The
Tribunal’s attention was not drawn to anything in the evidential record to indicate
that these regulatory actions were preceded by notice to BVL or to any other
specific procedures of the kind the Claimants contend are required by customary

international law.

The evidence adduced in this proceeding also shows that, following the FDA’s
Import Alert on 28 August 2009, at least three other important national and regional
regulatory agencies took actions effectively ending imports of the Claimants’
products into their territories for varying periods. Again, there is no indication that
any of these regulators delayed action until they had completed the prior notice,
hearing or any other procedural elements said by the Claimants to be required by

customary international law.

Thus, in September 2009, the Claimants’ internal e-mail regarding conversations
with New Zealand’s Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority (Medsafe)”*
quotes senior Medsafe officials as saying they were leaning toward prohibiting
further imports of Apotex drug products into New Zealand under Section 37 of New
Zealand’s Medicines Act.”? In lieu of a prohibition on imports of its products under
Section 37, the Claimants promptly entered into a “voluntary import restriction”
barring imports into New Zealand of drug products manufactured at the Signet and

Etobicoke facilities. Medsafe agreed that the voluntary ban on imports from the

Signet facility could be lifted on 20 October 2009;*° and the ban on products from
the Etobicoke facility was lifted on 24 November 2009.*!

Also in September 2009, another of the Claimants’ internal e-mails reveals a similar
sequence of events with regulators from Australia’s Therapeutic Goods
Administration (“TGA”). According to the report from the Claimants’ officer in
Australia, reporting discussions with TGA to senior Apotex officers in Toronto:
“These are the actions that we have to take — Non negotiable. (1) We must initiate a
voluntary recall of Meloxicam batches identified as potentially problematic as per
the details sent by Lance earlier this week ... (2) We are to suspend all shipments of
products manufactured by the Signet and Etobicoke site for Australia with
immediate effect. The suspension is to remain in place until Health Canada has
completed its review of the Signet site ... The ‘voluntary suspension’ of shipments is
confidential ... For the avoidance of doubt, the suspension is to remain in place until
Health Canada has completed its review of the Signet site. If Health Canada is OK
with the plans that Apotex HQ has put in place then we will be allowed to ship
again.”* 2

From the evidence, it is apparent that the European Union’s drug regulators took
similar action, again with no indication that the Claimants were given the prior
notice, hearing or other procedures said by the Claimants to be required by

customary international law.

According to an EU press release of 26 October 2009: “The European Medicines
Agency (EMEA), the Medicines Evaluation Board (MEB) and the Netherlands
Health Care Inspectorate (IGZ) have been made aware of Good Manufacturing
Practices (GMP) problems with two manufacturing sites in Canada, belonging to the
company Apotex. As a precautionary measure IGZ has requested that Apotex
temporarily cease the import and distribution of all products imported into the
European Economic Area (EEA) that were manufactured at one of the
manufacturing sites, with the exception of Ferriprox (deferiprone). Apotex has

complied with this request. This manufacturing site is currently being inspected.

*! Bxhibit C-121.
* Exhibit C-095 (emphasis in original).

Part IX — Page 12 of 27

9.34.

9.35.

9.36.

The other manufacturing site has already been inspected and found to be GMP
compliant ... The suspension of import and distribution is a precautionary measure
that will be lifted once the manufacturing site is found to be GMP compliant.
Ferriprox is excluded from the suspension of import and distribution, because it is
considered to be an essential product by some European Union (EU) Member
States. After careful review of the manufacture of this product, the IGZ, in
collaboration with the EMEA, has decided to allow the supply of this product onto

the EU market to continue.”

At the Hearing, the Claimants submitted that these three responses do not show state
practice, because in each case the Claimants voluntarily suspended imports of their
drug products: “A private Party’s voluntary act cannot constitute state practice.
Because Apotex acted voluntarily, there was no legal process and there is no

evidence of the legal processes that these States provided to Apotex.”**

The Tribunal rejects this explanation. Certain of the New Zealand, Australian and
EU drug regulators’ requirements were indeed couched as “requests”, but in each
case these requests rested upon a clear expectation of rapid and mandatory

regulatory action if the Claimants did not comply. The Claimants’ “voluntary
import restriction” on imports into New Zealand remained in effect until Medsafe
said it could be lifted; TGA’s requirements to initiate a recall and to “suspend all
shipments of products” from Signet and Etobicoke were (as the Apotex officer
recognised at the time) “non-negotiable”; and EU regulators “decided to allow” the
drug Ferriprox to be imported because some EU countries considered it an essential
pharmaceutical product. Indeed, the Claimants’ own witness describes the actions of
New Zealand’s regulators and of the Netherlands Health Care Inspectorate as an
“import ban.” The relatively temperate language of foreign drug regulators
towards the Claimants may reflect a difference in regional culture; but their acts

were not materially different from the FDA’s Import Alert.

In the Tribunal’s view, these actions by several state regulators, from countries with

legal systems sensitive to due process, cast still further doubt on the Claimants’

contention that customary international law bars a State’s regulatory decisions that
block imports of adulterated foreign drug products, unless that State’s regulator

accords to the alien prior notice, a hearing and other procedural safeguards.

The Tribunal also recalls in this regard the decisions by NAFTA and other
international tribunals emphasising the need for international tribunals to recognise
the special roles and responsibilities of regulatory bodies charged with protecting
public health and other important public interests. These are of course not binding
on this Tribunal, which must make its own determinations regarding the facts and
the law relevant to this case; and, moreover, the Tribunal here addresses under
NAFTA Article 1105(1) a “minimum” standard of treatment, with no permissible
margin of appreciation below such minimum. Nevertheless, these other decisions
indicate the need for international tribunals to exercise caution in cases involving a
state regulator’s exercise of discretion, particularly in sensitive areas involving

protection of public health and the well-being of patients.

As the NAFTA Thunderbird tribunal observed in a different context, the role of
NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven is “to measure the conduct of Mexico towards
Thunderbird against the international law standards set up by Chapter Eleven of the
NAFTA. Mexico has in this context a wide regulatory ‘space’ for regulation; in the
regulation of the gambling industry, governments have a particularly wide scope of
regulation reflecting national views on public morals.”*° In the Tribunal’s view,
what is true for regulating gambling (however expressed) must be no less true with
respect to regulating drug imports to protect the public health of its citizens and

residents.

In a similar vein, the NAFTA Chemtura tribunal stated that: “the rule [sic: role] of a
Chapter 11 Tribunal is not to second-guess the correctness of a science-based
decision-making of highly specialized national regulatory agencies”;*” and in S.D.
Myers v. Canada, the NAFTA tribunal stated: “When interpreting and applying the
‘minimum standard’, a Chapter 11 tribunal does not have an open-ended mandate to

second-guess government decision making.”** This Tribunal agrees with these

statements. Otherwise, NAFTA tribunals would be required in cases such as the
present case, as the Respondent submitted at the Hearing, to “step into the shoes of
FDA and evaluate how those factors [i.e. all the specialist factors relevant to the
FDA’s regulatory discretion] were applied to Apotex and other companies.” This
Tribunal, by inclination, qualification and training, cannot possibly act as a drug

regulator; and, indeed, the Claimants do not suggest that it could.

For all these reasons, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimants have not established
the existence of the specific procedural rights required by customary international
law in the context of the FDA’s regulatory decision here challenged, namely the
Import Alert.” As the Party bearing the legal burden of establishing its case, this
determination would suffice to dismiss the Claimants’ case under NAFTA Article

1105(1).

However, it is necessary to consider the Claimants’ case further. Because of the
Claimants’ emphasis on the specific procedural protections listed in Section 181 of
the Second Restatement, the Parties did not clearly address two broader questions.
First, is an obligation to accord some form of due process appropriate to a particular
context one of the elements making up the customary international law minimum
standard?" In this regard, the Tribunal recalls that past NAFTA tribunals generally
have interpreted the minimum standard in NAFTA Article 1105 as being comprised
of a limited number of defined elements (denial of justice, failure to accord full
protection and security, etc.). These international tribunals have rejected
conceptions equating this minimum standard with broader and more abstract notions

such as “justice” or “the rule of law”?

Second, if an obligation to accord due process is one of the elements of the
minimum standard (or is an aspect of denial of justice, as some scholars and
decisions suggest), by what standard should an international tribunal assess whether
that obligation has not been met? The Claimants argued forcibly that some form of

due process is required by customary international law, but they did not directly

#° Apotex Memorial, Para. 13.

+" Both Parties agree that the nature of the process that is due depends on the context, as the Reporters’ Note to
Section 181 indicates (USA Rejoinder, Para. 299; Apotex Reply, Para. 421; and the Claimants at TD2.476).

address in what manner this constitutes one of the elements of the minimum
standard for purposes of NAFTA Article 1105(1). The Respondent’s position was
that, while the Respondent provided substantial due process protections to the

Claimants, this was “not based on a rule of customary international law.”

The Tribunal observes that NAFTA tribunals have treated the relationship between
due process and Article 1105’s minimum standard in greatly varying ways. The
Glamis Gold tribunal concluded that the customary international law minimum
standard remains as apparently articulated in the 1926 Neer award: “* “to violate the
customary international law minimum standard of treatment codified in Article
1105 of the NAFTA, an act must be sufficiently egregious and shocking — a gross
denial of justice, manifest arbitrariness, blatant unfairness, a complete lack of due

process, evident discrimination, or a manifest lack of reasons — so as to fall below

accepted international standards ...” (emphasis added by this Tribunal).*°

The Waste Management tribunal gave more, but circumscribed, weight to the
element of due process in Article 1105’s minimum standard. That tribunal
understood earlier NAFTA cases to indicate that the minimum standard was
infringed by “a lack of due process leading to an outcome which offends judicial
propriety - as might be the case with a manifest failure of natural justice in judicial
proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and candour in an administrative

process” (emphasis added by this Tribunal).*°

For its part, the Thunderbird tribunal saw denial of due process as an aspect of
denial of justice and therefore part of the customary international standard.*” That
tribunal inquired whether “there was a failure to provide due process, constituting
an administrative denial of justice.”** The tribunal rejected the claimant’s

contention that it was denied due process because an administrative hearing (a

formal adversarial proceeding of the sort Section 181 of the Second Restatement
primarily addresses) did not satisfy the requirements of NAFTA Article 1105. The
tribunal found that the evidence did not show that the proceedings “were arbitrary or
unfair, let alone so manifestly arbitrary or unfair as to violate the minimum standard
of treatment.” It further observed that the administrative proceedings at issue
“should be tested against the standards of due process and procedural fairness
applicable to administrative officials. The administrative due process requirement is

lower than that of a judicial process.”*”

The Chemtura tribunal took yet another approach, evidently assuming (although
without discussion) that due process is part of the minimum standard under NAFTA.
Article 1105.°! The case involved allegations that Canada violated Article 1105 by
conducting a flawed review of the registration of lindane, a pesticide. The tribunal
rejected claims that Canada’s procedures failed to satisfy Article 1105, observing
that it “should not limit its inquiry to a specific portion of such arrangements [the
lindane review process]. It must appraise any procedural deficiency in the light of
the mechanisms provided by the Respondent [to conduct the review].”*? Further, the
tribunal emphasised the context in which the claim arose: “In assessing whether the
treatment afforded to the Claimant’s investment was in accordance with the
international minimum standard, the Tribunal must take into account all the
circumstances, including the fact that certain agencies manage highly specialized

5 However, the

domains involving scientific and public policy determinations.
Chemtura tribunal did not posit a standard for assessing claims of deprivation of due
process, finding instead that it found no facts “that would even come close to the

type of treatment required for a breach of the FET standard.”**

Despite their varying approaches regarding this element of due process, Professor
Dumberry concludes in his well-known work that all of these past NAFTA tribunals
“have emphasized that a high threshold of severity and gravity is required in order

to conclude that the host state has breached any of the elements contained within the

FET standard under Article 1105.”°° The Tribunal agrees with this scholarly

conclusion. It does not support the Claimants’ case.

Further, as prior international tribunals have decided, whatever process may be due
depends on the particular context or circumstances of the claim. The evidence in the
present case shows that the regulation of cross-border trade in drug products is
intended primarily to ensure the safety of domestic patients and that it is inherently
a complex and specialised process involving professional judgments as to public
health for which there are no mechanical rules. Regulation can involve the
balancing of conflicting discretionary factors, such as cases where a foreign
company experiencing grave manufacturing difficulties may be the sole or primary
producer of drugs medically necessary for treating serious medical conditions for

domestic patients in the regulator’s country.

This proceeding has not addressed the diversity in NAFTA jurisprudence on the
relationship between due process and the minimum standard of treatment under
NAFTA Article 1105. However, assuming (without here deciding) that some
element of due process figures in Article 1105’s customary minimum standard, the
Tribunal finds, on the facts of this case, that the Respondent’s conduct impugned by
the Claimants does not approach the “high threshold of severity and gravity”

required to establish a violation of Article 1105(1).

The Claimants first contend that they were denied due process because they were
not given prior notice that an import alert was being considered by the FDA;* and
that they had no opportunity to present evidence and witnesses before being placed
on import alert.*” As already described in Part III above, the Respondent indicates
that the FDA’s practice is not to give prior notice and hearings to a foreign firm
being considered for import alert for cGMP deficiencies, lest that firm (or others)
take advantage of the notice and ensuing delay to surge its adulterated product into
the US market. The Respondent submits that, in addition to direct communication
with the FDA both before and after a decision to impose an import alert, affected

entities have several administrative procedures available to contest adverse FDA

actions. The Tribunal does not see this FDA practice as unreasonable or abusive in
the particular regulatory context, involving imports of drug products potentially
bearing serious risks to public health and originating from a wide variety of
manufacturers of varying quality (and even integrity) in numerous foreign

jurisdictions.

The Claimants next maintain that the FDA gave no reasons for imposing the Import
Alert of 28 August 2009,** but this criticism is not supported on the evidence
adduced in this proceeding.” The evidential record shows that officers from the
Claimants (Apotex Inc.) were constantly present during the FDA inspections of the
Etobicoke and Signet facilities and met with the FDA’s inspectors following these
inspections on 19 December 2008 and 14 August 2009 respectively. The Claimants
had copies of the FDA Form 483s recording the FDA’s inspectors’ observations.
The Claimants had the Etobicoke warning letter of 25 June 2009. After the Import
Alert was imposed, the record shows numerous face-to-face meetings, telephone
conferences, telephone calls and e-mail communications between FDA officers and
Apotex personnel regarding the Claimants’ efforts to improve the quality control
systems at the Etobicoke and Signet facilities, during which Apotex personnel and
their consultants expressed an understanding of what was expected of the
Claimants. The evidence does not show that Apotex personnel did not understand
the FDA’s concerns regarding the Claimants’ non-compliance with cGMP

regulations at the Etobicoke and Signet facilities.

The Claimants also complained that the decision to adopt the Import Alert was
made by partial FDA officers and not by an impartial decision-maker. The
Tribunal rejects this allegation of partiality, based particularly on the character of
Dr. Rosa, who appeared to the Tribunal as a thoroughly professional and highly
responsible person, as well as an impressive witness (to which the Tribunal has
already referred in Parts III and VIII). However, the evidential record also shows
that Dr. Rosa and other CDER officers did not have the sole power to impose the
Import Alert, which was imposed by the FDA’s senior officials following formal

coordination and concurrence by officers in several parts of the FDA. The Tribunal

notes in this regard that the FDA’s multi-layered decision-making worked to the
benefit of the Claimants when senior FDA officials rejected the FDA inspectors’
recommendations to maintain the Import Alert after the unsuccessful re-inspections
of the Signet and Etobicoke facilities in January-February 2011 (see the findings of

fact in Part III above).

Significantly, as the Respondent asserts, the Claimants did not pursue any of the
administrative remedies potentially available to them under the FDA’s regulations
and US law. The Claimants maintain that these were ineffectual and could not
provide effective means to contest the FDA’s action and secure redress against the
Import Alert.”! In the Tribunal’s view, the evidence shows that under the FDA’s
regulations, the Claimants could have requested an administrative hearing to contest
the detention of products before the FDA’s responsible district officer detaining
those products; they could have requested reconsideration of the findings of cGMP
violations or the decision to impose the Import Alert under 21 CFR Section 10.75;
and they could have lodged a citizen petition under 21 CFR Section 10.25, 10.30.
To gain fully effective relief, it is likely that the Claimants would have had to seek
modification of the FDA’s findings of cGMP violations because even if the Import
Alert were withdrawn or suspended, these findings would leave products
manufactured at the Signet and Etobicoke facilities subject to refusal of entry into
the USA even without any import alert. However, this factor does not assist the
Claimants’ case because the Claimants do not impugn these findings as a “measure”

by the Respondent in this proceeding.

The Claimants did not utilise any of these remedies, maintaining in this proceeding
that it was the Respondent’s legal burden to prove that they could give the
Claimants effective relief against the Import Alert.” In this connection, the
Claimants also contended: “at the time the Import Alert was imposed, FDA
repeatedly made clear that the only way Apotex could seek relief from the Import

Alert was through re-inspection.”*

9.57.

The Tribunal heard detailed and sharply conflicting expert testimony from the
Parties’ legal experts (Mr. Bradshaw and Mr. Vodra), both highly qualified and
prominent US lawyers with extensive experience in FDA matters, regarding the
Claimants’ ability to gain relief through the administrative procedures set out in the
FDA’s regulations. The Respondent’s legal expert (Mr. Vodra) contended that these
procedures provided credible avenues for the Claimants to seek relief had there been
legally improper or unjustified agency action. The Claimants’ expert (Mr.
Bradshaw) argued that the Claimants could not secure relief because it lay in the
FDA’s discretion or because the reviewing party would not be independent but
would instead be the official making the original decision or that official’s

supervisor.

At the Hearing, the Claimants also urged that an administrative appeal to the FDA
would not be an effective remedy under the International Court of Justice’s
judgment in Diallo, which was said to show that an appeal to the agency that made a
contested administrative decision cannot be an effective remedy in international
law.™ The Tribunal considers this misapprehends the ICJ’s decision. Diallo found
that an appeal to a decision maker to reverse a decision “‘as an act of grace” is not a
local remedy that must be exhausted under international law. However,
administrative remedies must be pursued for purposes of the exhaustion of remedies
tule “if they are aimed at vindicating a right and not at obtaining a favour.”® The
Claimants’ pursuit of administrative remedies under the FDA’s regulations would
not be to seek the agency’s “grace”, but because they would seek to show that the

FDA’s action was legally or factually incorrect.

Diallo involved whether Guinea satisfied the customary law requirement of
exhaustion of remedies for its exercise of diplomatic protection, not the
international law minimum standard. While the context is different, the case is
instructive here. In Diallo, the ICJ found it “incumbent on the applicant to prove
that local remedies were indeed exhausted or to establish that exceptional
circumstances relieved the allegedly injured person ... of the obligation to exhaust

available local remedies. ... It is for the respondent to convince the Court that there

were effective remedies in its domestic legal system that were not exhausted.”
(The ICJ found that the Democratic Republic of the Congo did not prove that it
offered an effective remedy where its law expressly provided that refusals of entry

into the country “shall not be subject to appeal.”°”)

The Tribunal has carefully weighed the Parties’ conflicting assessments of the
administrative remedies available to the Claimants in regard to the Import Alert. It
finds that the evidence sufficiently establishes that remedies were available to the
Claimants (particularly Apotex Inc. and Apotex-US) to challenge a legally or
factually unwarranted regulatory decision by the FDA. The evidence does not
establish that there were any “exceptional circumstances” justifying a decision by
the Claimants not to pursue those remedies. The evidence shows that the Claimants
were (and remain) a sophisticated international corporate organisation that makes
vigorous use of legal proceedings (with specialist legal and other advisers) as part of
its business model. Yet, the Claimants made no effort to utilise any of the FDA’s
administrative procedures to contest the FDA’s findings of cGMP deficiencies, as
they could have done had they believed that those findings involved factual or legal
error. The Tribunal concludes from the evidence that, at the time, the Claimants

held no such belief.

In this connection, the Tribunal notes that the evidential record indicates that the
Claimants were at the time well aware of shortcomings in their manufacturing
facilities and processes at the Signet and Etobicoke facilities. The Tribunal also
notes that the Claimants’ Request states that: “Apotex-Canada [Apotex Inc.]
rejected FDA’s suggestion that its facilities were not compliant with cGMP.”
Likewise, certain of the Claimants’ written witness statements prepared for purposes
of this arbitration maintain that the FDA’s action was not justified. However, no

contemporaneous evidence to this effect was identified to the Tribunal.

To the contrary, there is substantial evidence indicating that at the time of the
Import Alert, the Claimants recognised material deficiencies at both the Signet and
Etobicoke facilities. Apotex Inc.’s own minutes of the conference-call with the FDA
on 17 August 2009 (after the Signet inspection) record that Apotex Inc.’s Vice
President for Quality twice acknowledged “deficiencies.””” Perhaps most telling, the
executive summary of the Claimants’ quality consultants’ report presented to the
FDA at the meeting in March 2010 confirmed the correctness of key FDA findings
and the need for the Claimants to improve their quality systems. ”! The FDA’s
minutes of that meeting record Apotex Inc.’s president and chief operating officer as
saying that Apotex “knows their current state of operations and will rectify the
issues of concern to get the company on the right track.” At the same meeting, a
senior Apotex officer “‘stated that Apotex needs to look at their Quality System.
Apotex has hired 250 [full-time equivalents] to address their quality issues.” The
Claimants adopted extensive remedial measures and spent millions of US dollars to
improve their quality control systems at the Signet and Etobicoke facilities, taking
almost a year before even requesting re-inspection of these two facilities by the
FDA.” Health Canada did not find Apotex’s corrective action plan acceptable until
December 2010.” Last but not least, the Claimants do not formally dispute the
correctness of the FDA’s findings of cGMP violations in this arbitration. According
to the Claimants, their claims “do not put into issue whether or not FDA erred in its

observations and conclusions regarding cGMP.”’°

This record cannot be reconciled with the proposition that the Claimants in fact
rejected the FDA’s findings of cGMP violations at the time. It is only consistent
with the conclusion that the Claimants did not pursue administrative relief because

they decided that doing so would be unavailing because there was a sufficient

factual and legal basis for the FDA’s action, and not because the available remedies

were ineffectual.

9.62. Finally, the Claimants did not contest the FDA’s actions in the US courts. They
submit that they could not do so,”° citing the position taken by the FDA in domestic
litigation that imposing an import alert is not a final agency action subject to judicial
review. The Respondent submits that the Claimants could have brought suit against
the FDA for unreasonable delay (in lifting the Import Alert), pointing out that the
Claimants had previously filed such a suit against the FDA in another setting.”
Further, the Respondent submits that the Claimants could have brought suit to
challenge the Import Alert itself, observing that while the FDA believes that
decisions to impose an Import Alert are not judicially reviewable, US courts are not
bound to this view and that some US courts have rejected the FDA’s position in

analogous settings.”

9.63. The Tribunal notes that in Bellarno,” the US District Court ruled that the FDA
acted unlawfully in imposing an import alert barring the plaintiffs reimport into the
USA of certain pharmaceuticals, rejecting the FDA’s argument that imposing the
Import Alert was not judicially reviewable. While the FDA subsequently modified
the terms of its import alerts (as described in Part VIII above), Bellarno and other
like US cases* indicate that US courts do not feel bound to defer to the FDA’s
views that its actions involving imports are not judicially reviewable. The Tribunal
also notes that whilst the Import Alert was in effect, the Claimants’ lawyers twice

threatened to bring suit against the FDA in the USA, suggesting that they saw

recourse to US courts as an available avenue of relief.*!

In light of all the evidence, the Tribunal cannot conclude, as the Claimants assert,
that it would have been futile for the Claimants to seek relief in the US courts to
contest the FDA’s actions if the FDA had indeed been acting improperly and that

the Claimants were justified in not pursuing any such legal remedy.

Given the overall record, including the Claimants’ decisions not to pursue either
administrative or judicial remedies to contest the FDA’s allegedly improper action
in imposing the Import Alert, the Tribunal decides that the Claimants have failed to
establish that the Respondent’s conduct rose to the threshold of severity and gravity
required to establish a violation of NAFTA Article 1105, even assuming that such

protection extends beyond an investment to the treatment of an investor.

The Jamaica-USA BIT

In the Tribunal’s view, the Jamaica-USA BIT does not assist the Claimants’ case.
This part of the Claimants’ claim raises many of the same matters already addressed
by the Tribunal under NAFTA Article 1105(1) above; and, in the circumstances, it
suffices here to address only other relevant matters. Accordingly, the Tribunal
addresses below the Claimants’ principal argument based on “effective means”
under Article II(6) of the BIT. Given its earlier decisions, the Claimants’ subsidiary
argument based on impairment under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT fails on the facts
found by the Tribunal. There was in this case no unreasonable or discriminatory
wrongdoing by the Respondent in regard to any the Claimants’ actual or alleged
investments from the “violation of the most elementary due process rules” (as

82

alleged by the Claimants);°" and accordingly the Tribunal rejects this subsidiary

argument.

In summary, the Claimants contend that Article II(6) of the BIT provides more
favourable treatment for both investors and investments than NAFTA Article
1105(1) because this provision establishes (via the MFN wording in NAFTA Article
1103 and independently from customary international law) an obligation upon the
Respondent towards the Claimants to provide “effective means” for asserting claims
and enforcing rights; and the Claimants further contend that such means are not

limited to judicial or adjudicatory proceedings but include also (because these are

® Apotex Memorial, Para. 486.

Part IX ~ Page 25 of 27

9.69.

9.70.

not excluded) administrative decision-making by the Respondent, such as the
FDA’s decision to impose the Import Alert on products manufactured at the Signet
and Etobicoke facilities.** The Claimants submit that the evidence proves that the
Claimants were not accorded effective means by the Respondent because “Apotex

had no way to challenge the Import Alert.”**

In summary, the Respondent contends the Claimants cannot establish that they
would have received, nor would any comparator, better treatment under Article II(6)
of the BIT than under NAFTA Article 1105(1). Further, according to the
Respondent, Article II(6) of the BIT on “effective means” does not import the
procedural rights here asserted by the Claimants because this provision is limited to
adjudicatory proceedings “where claims can be asserted and rights can be

enforced.”*°

The Respondent submits that this interpretation is supported both by the plain
meaning of the provision’s wording and by its drafting history, as recounted by
Professor Vandevelde. As to the former, the Respondent submits that the text speaks
for itself; and that no decision or award supports the Claimants’ interpretation. As to
the latter, Professor Vandevelde states that this “effective means” provision in US
bilateral investment treaties derives originally from judicial access provisions in the
Respondent’s Friendship, Commerce and Navigation Treaties.*° Hence, so the
Respondent concludes, the wording cannot bear the much broader interpretation

here asserted by the Claimants.

In the Tribunal’s view, this part of the Claimants’ case can be decided shortly. The
Tribunal determines that the plain meaning of Article II(6) of Jamaica-USA BIT,
interpreted under international law (as codified in Article 31 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties) does not apply to non-adjudicatory proceedings,

such as the administrative decision of the FDA as a regulator on the Import Alert of

28 August 2009. The wording “asserting claims and enforcing rights” is the
language of adjudicatory proceedings. It is not the language of non-adjudicatory
administrative decision-making, such as the FDA’s decision regarding the Import
Alert; and if it had been intended by the BIT’s Contracting Parties to bear this
broader meaning, it would have been necessary to add further unambiguous

wording.

In the circumstances, the Tribunal does not decide whether or not the MFN
provision in NAFTA Article 1103 can modify the content of NAFTA Article
1105(1). The Respondent submitted that all three NAFTA Parties are unanimously
agreed that it cannot;®” but whether the NAFTA Parties are correct will have to

await the decision of another NAFTA tribunal.

Conclusion

   

Accordingly, for these reasons, the Tribunal dismiss

all claims under NAFTA Article 1105(1), NAFTA Article 1103 and Article II(2)(b)

Ss, on the merits as to liability
and (6) of the Jamaica-USA BIT made in this proceeding by Apotex-Holdings (for
itself and for Apotex-US). Although the Tribunal has upheld the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections against Apotex Inc. in Part VII above, it can be assumed
that the same result on the merits would have followed for Apotex Inc. if the
Tribunal had assumed jurisdiction over its separate claims under these provisions.
Moreover, this overall result avoids a potential issue with regard to the Claimants’
different claims, namely whether a violation based upon any want of due process (as
argued by the Claimants) could succeed collectively if only one and not all of the

three claiming entities was affected by any relevant procedural deficiency.

PART X - LEGAL AND ARBITRATION COSTS

Introduction

The Tribunal here addresses the fifth and last principal issue, namely the Parties’
respective claims for legal and arbitration costs under Article 58(1) of the ICSID
Arbitration AF Rules, to be considered in the current phase of this arbitration
together with Paragraph 12 of the Tribunal’s Procedural Order deciding Bifurcation
and Non-Bifurcation dated 25 January 2013 (the “Order’).

Article 58(1) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules provides: “Unless the parties
otherwise agree, the Tribunal shall decide how and by whom the fees and expenses
of the members of the Tribunal, the expenses and charges of the Secretariat and the
expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceeding shall be borne.
The Tribunal may, to that end, call on the Secretariat and the parties to provide it
with the information it needs in order to formulate the division of the cost of the

proceeding between the parties.”

Paragraph 12 of the Order provides: “As to additional costs borne by the
Respondent in addressing liability issues (when it could succeed on the
jurisdictional issues), the Tribunal here confirms that it would be minded to apply in
this case the ‘loser pays’ principle in allocating legal and arbitration costs to reflect
that event and not leave costs where they lay under Article 58 of the ICSID
Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules. It is also assumed that the Claimants would
honour such an award for costs in favour of the Respondent pursuant to Article

52(4) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules.”

From the Parties’ respective submissions on costs (summarised below), the Tribunal
understands that it is common ground between the Parties that the Tribunal should
exercise its discretion under Article 58(1) as to legal and arbitration costs by

reference to this “loser pays” principle.

The Tribunal recognises that this issue concerns significant amounts: (i) for the
Claimants: US$ 774,931 and EUR 5,088,387; and (ii) for the Respondent: US$
1,572,584.

The Claimants’ Submissions

In accordance with the Tribunal’s procedural orders made at the Hearing, the
Claimants filed their first submission on costs on 17 January 2014 (the “Apotex
Costs Submission”). In summary, the Claimants submit that, in the event that they
are successful on jurisdiction and liability, the Tribunal should either (i) reserve its
decision on costs for the eventual award in this arbitration; or (ii) determine costs in
favour of the Claimants for this first bifurcated phase of the arbitration, with that
determination to be recorded in the eventual award issued at the end of the next and

final phase of the arbitration. !

As to (i), the Claimants record that they had previously requested that the Tribunal
follow this course and to reserve its decision on costs until the next and final phase
of the arbitration.? The Claimants confirm that they remain content with this

approach. 3

As to (ii), the Claimants contend that, should the Claimants be held successful on
jurisdiction and liability (thereby requiring a further phase), the Tribunal cannot
issue an award on costs at this first stage of the arbitration. The Claimants
recognise that costs decisions of the Tribunal must form a part of its eventual award
ending the arbitration (which would necessarily occur at a later date should the
Tribunal now decide in favour of the Claimants regarding jurisdiction and liability).
Under the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules (as the Tribunal also recognises), there can
be only one award; and there can be no interim or partial awards.> However, the
Claimants also submit that nothing prevents the Tribunal (should it be so inclined at
this first stage) from now assessing what legal costs have been incurred and how the

Tribunal is inclined to allocate such costs in its eventual award.°

As to the relevant principles to be applied in allocating costs under Article 58(1) of
the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules, the Claimants refer to the statement made by the

Tribunal in its Order rejecting the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation: “... the

Tribunal ... confirms that it would be minded to apply in this case the ‘loser pays’
principle in allocating legal and arbitration costs to reflect that event and not leave
costs where they lay under Article 58 of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility)
Rules.”’ (The Tribunal cites this Order more fully above). In the event that they are

successful, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal should adopt this approach.*

The Claimants claim the following arbitration and legal costs for this first phase of
the arbitration: (i) the charges for the use of the facilities and expenses of the ICSID
Secretariat and the Tribunal’s fees and expenses (this item is here called by the
Tribunal “Arbitration Costs”); (ii) the cost of external legal representation; (iii) fees
paid by the Claimants to their expert witnesses in relation to this first phase; and (iv)
the expenses incurred by the Claimants in connection with the arbitration, including
travel and accommodation expenses in relation to the Hearing (these last three items

are here collectively called by the Tribunal “Legal Costs”).?

The Arbitration and Legal Costs originally claimed by the Claimants are as

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

follows: '°
ICSID Lodging Fee US$ 25,000
Advances on Arbitration Costs US$ 350,000
Dentons’ legal fees and disbursements EUR 5,064,491
Fees paid to their expert witness, Mr. Bradshaw US$ 250,450
Fees paid to their expert witness, Mr. Johnson US$ 112,205
Costs paid for accommodation for the Hearing USS 37,276
Totals US$ 774,931 and
EUR 5,064,491

 

 

The Claimants submit that the amounts of their Legal Costs are reasonable and

proportionate to the issues in dispute, the claims made by the Claimants, the

the Claimants prove successful at this stage, they have not included the fees and expenses of damages expert
Howard N. Rosen in their submission. These will be included in their costs submission in the next phase
(Apotex Costs Submission, Para. 4).

‘© The Claimants submit that the claimed costs are supported by the evidential record and the certified
spreadsheets attached to their submission (Apotex Costs Submission, Para. 11).

Respondent’s jurisdictional objections and the defences raised by the Respondent on
the merits of the Claimants’ claims (as to liability)."! The Claimants note that their
costs amount to less than one per cent of the quantum of compensation in dispute

between the Parties in this arbitration.”

In accordance with the Tribunal’s procedural orders at the Hearing, the Claimants
filed a second costs submission on 7 February 2014 (the “Apotex Second Costs

Submission’).

In summary, in this second submission the Claimants do not object to the
reasonableness of the costs claimed by the Respondent in its costs submission or to
the method of their calculation (summarised below).? The Claimants also note that
the Parties are in agreement that the ‘loser pays’ principle should be applied in this
arbitration." However, the Claimants disagree with the Respondent’s suggestion
that the Respondent’s jurisdictional suggestions are meritorious and that a full
bifurcated arbitration, as between jurisdiction and all merits, would have been more
efficient.'° The Claimants also contend that it is beside the point whether a
bifurcated arbitration would have been more efficient, as should the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections succeed in this arbitration, the Respondent would in any

event be entitled to its costs under the ‘loser pays’ principle. ‘6

As to the inefficiencies suggested by the Respondent of a combined hearing on
jurisdiction and the merits (as to liability), the Claimants submit that much of the
testimony heard at the Hearing was relevant both to liability and jurisdiction. '" The
Claimants also submit that the Respondent declined to call any of the eight
witnesses tendered by the Claimants, a possibility which had not been raised by the

Respondent at the time when the Parties were considering bifurcation with the

10.16. The Claimants revised their costs calculation to reflect their additional costs
incurred in January 2014.2? The only item affected by the revision is that of
Dentons’ legal fees and disbursements”!

10.17. Accordingly, the total Legal and Arbitration Costs now claimed by the Claimants,
as revised, are as follows:

ICSID Lodging Fee US$ 25,000
Advances on Arbitration Costs US$ 350,000
Dentons’ legal fees and disbursements EUR 5,088,387
Fees paid to Mr. Bradshaw US$ 250,450
Fees paid to Mr. Johnson US$ 112,205
Costs paid for accommodation for the Hearing USS 37,276
Revised Totals US$ 774,931 and
EUR 5,088,387

10.18. As with their first costs submission, the Claimants again request that the Tribunal
should either (i) reserve for the eventual award its decisions on costs for this first
phase or (ii) determine the amount of costs in favour of the Claimants as regards this
phase as US$ 774,931 and EUR 5,088,387, with those amounts to be recorded in
that eventual award.”

be borne in full by the Claimants, namely US$ 1,572,584 in total (to be adjusted to

account for the Tribunal’s final assessment of Arbitration Costs).73

10.20. The Respondent submits that Article 58(1) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules
confers a broad discretion on the Tribunal as to the allocation of Legal and
Arbitration costs.”* Like the Claimants, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal
should apply the ‘loser pays’ principle.”° The Respondent also contends that a costs
award is especially warranted in this arbitration to compensate a respondent for
having to defend a claim without any jurisdictional basis (assuming the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections prevail before the Tribunal).”°

10.21. |The Respondent refers to two further reasons in submitting that the Tribunal should
award costs in favour of the Respondent, namely: (i) the Respondent should never
have been involved in this arbitration given the manifest lack of jurisdiction over the
Claimants’ claims and the lack of any merits in those claims;?’ and (ii) the
Claimants required the Respondent to incur costs unnecessarily by refusing to agree

to bifurcate the case in full, as between jurisdiction and all merits.”

10.22. In submitting that the Claimants’ arguments against full bifurcation were not borne
out at the Hearing (the Respondent in particular refers to the Claimants’ argument
that full bifurcation, instead of saving time or costs, would rather increase the cost
of the proceedings’), the Respondent refers to the following factors: (i) witness
testimony presented at the Hearing related solely to issues of liability; (ii) oral
arguments on jurisdiction took “mere hours”; and (iii) the “vast bulk” of document

production, witness statements and expert reports addressed issues of liability, not

jurisdiction.*° In light of these factors, the Respondent submits that significant
procedural efficiencies and cost savings could have been obtained had the

Claimants agreed to bifurcate the arbitration in full.*!

10.23. The Respondent also refers to the Tribunal’s statement in its Order that the Tribunal
would be minded to apply the ‘loser pays’ principle in this case.” The Respondent
submits that nothing has occurred since January 2013 that should alter the

Tribunal’s assumption that such principle should apply here.*?

10.24. In accordance with Article 58(1) of the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules, the
Respondent claims the following amounts as costs: (i) fees and expenses of the
Members of the Tribunal and the expenses and charges of the ICSID Secretariat;
and (ii) expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with the arbitration.

Those costs, totalling US$ 1,572,584, are broken down as follows:**

1. Arbitration Costs: US$ 350,000 in fees and expenses of the Members of the

Tribunal and expenses and charges of the ICSID Secretariat; and

2. Legal Costs: US$ 1,222,584.38 in other expenses incurred by the Respondent in

connection with the arbitration, comprising:
i. US$ 881,978 for attorney and paralegal costs, excluding travel;
ii. US$ 333,366.80 for fees for expert consultants;*> and

iii. US$ 7,239.58 for attorney and witness travel.

of the Claimants’ document production requests and the large number of

submissions required from the Respondent.*®

With respect to attorney and paralegal costs, the Respondent notes the established
(and accepted*”) method by which those costs are claimed by the Respondent in
NAFTA Chapter Eleven disputes: namely, the relevant individuals’ salaries are
multiplied by the estimated percentage of attorney and paralegal time expended in
the arbitration on an annual basis.** The Respondent submits that the resulting costs
are conservative in three respects, namely: (a) the estimate does not include the time
that a number of other US government attorneys, paralegals and other personnel
devoted to this arbitration;*® (b) the estimate does not include the time spent by
administrative personnel on the arbitration;*° and (c) the Respondent only claims for
out-of-pocket costs for attorney and paralegal time, rather than the market value of

such services.“!

As already indicated in Part 1 above, the Respondent did not elect to file a second

costs submission.

The Tribunal’s Analysis and Decisions

In here deciding the issue between the Parties regarding Legal and Arbitration
Costs, the Tribunal exercises its discretionary powers under ICSID Article 58(1) of
the ICSID Arbitration AF Rules, together with the indication recorded in the Order
on the “loser pays principle” (both fully cited above). Before addressing these costs,

it is necessary to record several relevant circumstances.

First, by its Order, the Tribunal ordered bifurcation as between (i) a first phase on
jurisdiction and liability and (ii) subject to a decision on jurisdiction and liability, a

second and final phase on the remaining part of the Parties’ dispute (principally

quantum). In the Tribunal’s view, that mixed approach was justified during the
conduct of this first phase (including the Hearing), as a matter of efficiency, cost-
saving and overall procedural fairness for all Parties. Accordingly, the Tribunal does
not accept the criticisms made by the Respondent of the Claimants in regard to their
objection to the Respondent’s request for full bifurcation (as between jurisdiction
and all merits). Full bifurcation would have required at least two successive written
and oral phases, with the second addressing the merits of the claims made by
Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US) falling within the jurisdiction of
this Tribunal, as the Tribunal has here decided. Full bifurcation would therefore

have been less efficient, more costly and a much longer proceeding.

Second, whilst the overall end-result of this arbitration’s bifurcated first phase may
be regarded as favourable to the Respondent and unfavourable to the Claimants, the
position is mixed regarding separate issues on jurisdiction and liability. As decided
above, the Respondent prevailed on its jurisdictional objections to all claims
regarding ANDAs based on its introduction into this arbitration of the Apotex I & IT
Award with the Respondent’s Rejoinder (six months after the Tribunal’s Order); but
the Respondent did not prevail on its jurisdictional objections regarding other claims
made by Apotex-Holdings (for itself or for Apotex-US). On the other hand, as to
liability on the merits, the Respondent prevailed on all such claims made by

Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US).

Third, the Parties have treated the Claimants, as regards costs, as one entity without
distinguishing between the First and Second Claimants as claiming or responding
parties. Given the Claimants’ joint legal representation and joint conduct of the
arbitration, the Tribunal is content to adopt the same approach in deciding the issue

of Legal and Arbitration Costs.

Fourth, for what was always a complicated and difficult arbitration with very large
amounts at stake and significant issues of general importance, the Tribunal decides
that the amounts claimed by the Parties respectively as Legal Costs are reasonable

in amount and were reasonably incurred by the Parties for this arbitration.

Part X — Page 9 of 10

10.33.

10.34.

10.35.

Lastly, the Tribunal recognises that its discretion regarding costs falls into two
distinct parts regarding Legal Costs and Arbitration Costs respectively. It is

therefore appropriate to address these costs separately, in turn.

Legal Costs: In the circumstances, with regard to the principle “loser pays” and
taking into account its decision as to Arbitration Costs below, the Tribunal orders
the Claimants to bear and pay to the Respondent its Legal Costs in the total amount

of US$ 1,222,584.38.

Arbitration Costs: In the circumstances, with regard also to the principle “loser
pays” and taking into account its decisions to different effect as to jurisdiction, the
Tribunal orders the Claimants (as between the Claimants and the Respondent) to
bear and pay 75% of the Arbitration Costs with 25% to be borne and paid by the
Respondent. The final amount of such Arbitration Costs (to which these percentages
are applicable) shall be calculated by the ICSID Secretariat as soon as practicable
and notified in writing to the Parties pursuant to Article 58(1), last sentence, of the

ICSID Arbitration AF Rules.

PART XI- THE TRIBUNAL’S SUMMARY

Introduction: The Tribunal here summarises its several decisions in Parts III to X by
specific reference to the Parties’ respective formal claims for relief set out earlier in

Part I above.

The Claimants’ Claims: The First and Second Claimants, Apotex-Holdings and
Apotex Inc., by their Request (paragraph 89), request an award in their favour, for
themselves and (as regards the First Claimant) also on behalf of Apotex-US, in the
terms there specified pursuant to NAFTA Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1), as re-stated
in their Memorial (paragraph 572), their Reply (paragraph 532) and their Rejoinder
on Jurisdiction (paragraph 127).

The Tribunal’s Summary: By virtue of the Apotex I & II Award operating as res
judicata between the Claimants and the Respondent, the Tribunal (by a majority)
dismisses for want of jurisdiction all Claims by Apotex Inc. and all Claims made by
Apotex-Holdings as regards ANDAs under Article 45 of the ICSID Arbitration AF
Rules. The Tribunal otherwise dismisses all other jurisdictional objections made by

the Respondent.

As regards claims within its jurisdiction, the Tribunal dismisses on their merits (as
to liability) all other Claims made by Apotex-Holdings (for itself and on behalf of
Apotex-US) under NAFTA Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1).

(i) The Claimants’ Request: Section V, Para. 89 (pages 19-20) states: “As a result of
the actions and breaches of the Government of the United States of America
described above, the Claimants, on behalf of Apotex-US and on their own behalf,

respectfully intend to request an award in their favour:

(a) Finding that the United States of America has breached its obligations under
the NAFTA;

(b) Directing the United States of America to pay damages in an amount to be
proven at the hearing but which the Claimants presently estimate to be in the

hundreds of millions of US dollars;

(c)

(d)

(e)

Directing the United States of America to pay interest on all sums awarded;

Directing the United States of America to pay the Claimants’ costs associated

with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements;

Ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate in the

circumstances.”

The Tribunal’s Summary: As summarised above, the Tribunal dismisses these

Claims (a) to (c) as to jurisdiction (based on ANDAs) and otherwise on the merits

(as to liability), as summarised above. The Tribunal dismisses Claims (d) and (e).

(ii) The Claimants’ Memorial: Paragraph 572 (page 171) states: “As a result of the

actions and breaches of the Government of the United States of America described

above, the Claimants respectfully intend to request an award in their favour:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

Declaring that the United States of America has breached its obligations under

Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105 of the NAFTA;

Ordering the United States of America to pay damages in an amount to be
proven at the hearing but which the Claimants presently estimate to be in the

hundreds of millions of US dollars, including pre-award interest;

Ordering the United States of America to pay the Claimants’ interest and taxes

on all sums awarded;

Ordering the United States of America to pay the Claimants’ costs associated

with these proceedings, including professional fees and disbursements;

Ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate in the

circumstances.”

The Tribunal’s Summary: As summarised above, the Tribunal dismisses these

Claims (a) to (c), as to jurisdiction (based on ANDAs) and otherwise on the merits

(as to liability). The Tribunal dismisses Claims (d) and (e).

(iii) The Claimants’ Reply: Paragraph 532 (page 179) states: “As a result of the
actions and breaches of the Government of the United States of America described

above, the Claimants respectfully request a decision in their favour:

(a) Dismissing the US jurisdictional objections;

(b) Declaring that the United States of America has breached its obligations under
Articles 1102, 1103 and 1105 of the NAFTA;

(c) Ordering that the Claimants’ claims to damages and interest be addressed in

the subsequent phase of this arbitration, and decided in the final award;

(d) Reserving decision on Claimants’ request for an award of costs, including

professional fees and disbursements, until the next phase of this arbitration;

(e) Ordering such other and further relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate in the

circumstances.”

The Tribunal’s Summary: As to Claim (a), as summarised above, the Tribunal
dismisses the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to the claims made by Apotex-
Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US) in regard to Claims not based on ANDAs;
but the Tribunal otherwise dismisses the Claimants’ Claim (a). As to Claim (b), on
the merits as to liability, the Tribunal dismisses these Claims by Apotex-Holdings

(for itself and for Apotex-US). The Tribunal dismisses Claims (c), (d) and (e).

(iv) The Claimants’ Rejoinder on Jurisdiction: Paragraph 127 (page 47) states: “For
the foregoing reasons and those set out in its previous submissions, claimants
[Apotex-Holdings] and [Apotex Inc.] respectfully submit that the US objections to
jurisdiction should be dismissed ... and a decision entered in accordance with the

submissions set out at paragraph 532 of the Apotex Reply.”

The Tribunal’s Summary: As summarised above, the Tribunal dismisses the
Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to the Claims made by Apotex-Holdings for

The Respondent: The Respondent, by its Counter-Memorial (Paragraph 402, page

204), requests an award from the Tribunal:
(1) Upholding the Respondent's jurisdictional objections; and/or
(2) Dismissing the Claimants’ claims in their entirety and with prejudice; and

(3) Ordering that the Claimants bear the costs of these proceedings, including the

Respondent’s costs for legal representation and assistance.

This claim for relief was re-stated in the Respondent’s Rejoinder to like effect

(Paragraph 378, page 192).

The Tribunal’s Summary: As regards Claim (1), as summarised above, the Tribunal
upholds the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to all Claims made by Apotex
Inc.; but the Tribunal dismisses the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections to the
Claims made by Apotex-Holdings (for itself and for Apotex-US) not based on
ANDAs.

As regards Claim (2), the Tribunal dismisses on their merits, as to liability, all
Claims not based on ANDAs made by Apotex-Holdings (for itself and on behalf of
Apotex-US) under NAFTA Articles 1116(1) and 1117(1).

As regards Claim (3), the Tribunal orders the Claimants to pay the Respondent’s
Legal Costs in the total sum of US$ 1,222,584.38; and as regards Arbitration Costs,
the Tribunal orders the Respondent to bear and pay 25% and the Claimants to bear

and pay 75% of such Arbitration Costs, as calculated by the ICSID Secretariat.

PART XII - THE OPERATIVE PART

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal finally decides and awards as follows:

(1) Jurisdiction and Res Judicata: The Tribunal upholds the Respondent’s
jurisdictional objections against all claims made by the First and Second
Claimants under NAFTA’s Chapter Eleven as regards approved abbreviated
new drug applications (“ANDAs”), pursuant to Article 45 of the ICSID
Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, on the grounds that, by reason of the
Apotex I & II Award of 14 June 2013 operating as res judicata between the

Respondent and the Claimants, such claims are not within the jurisdiction

(“competence”) of the Tribunal in this arbitration;

(2) Other Jurisdictional Objections: Save as ordered in the preceding paragraph,
the Tribunal dismisses all other jurisdictional objections made by the
Respondent in this arbitration and assumes jurisdiction to decide all other

claims made by the First Claimant (for itself and Apotex Corp.), i.e. all claims

other than ANDAs;

(3) Merits (Liability): The Tribunal dismisses on their merits as to liability all
claims (other than ANDAs) made against the Respondent by the First
Claimant (both for itself and for Apotex Corp.) under NAFTA’s Chapter

Eleven and the Jamaica-USA bilateral investment treaty;

(4) Arbitration Costs: The First and Second Claimants shall bear under Article
58(1) of the ICSID Arbitration (Additional Facility) Rules, 75% of all
arbitration costs of this arbitration and the Respondent shall bear 25% of such
arbitration costs (namely the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal
and the expenses and charges of the Secretariat), in amounts to be separately
confirmed by letter to the Parties from the ICSID Secretariat; and to the extent

necessary, the Claimants shall reimburse the Respondent for any arbitration

costs paid by the Respondent exceeding its said percentage share;

the expenses incurred by the Respondent in connection with the arbitration);

and

Save as ordered above, all other claims made the Parties in this arbitration are

dismissed.
