INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns the outcome of a dispute submitted to the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the
“Agreement between the Government of Saint Lucia and RSM Production Corporation”
(the “Agreement”), entered into on March 29, 2000, and the Convention on the Settlement
of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, dated October 14,

1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimant in the arbitration proceeding and the Applicant in the annulment proceeding
is RSM Production Corporation (“RSM” or the “Applicant”), a company organized and

licensed in Texas, United States of America.
The Respondent is Saint Lucia (“St. Lucia” or the “Respondent”).

The Applicant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

The underlying dispute relates to the implementation of the Agreement, whereby the
Respondent granted RSM an exclusive oil exploration license in an area off the coast of St.
Lucia. A boundary dispute developed, affecting the exploration area, in particular in relation
to Martinique, Barbados and St. Vincent, which allegedly prevented RSM from initiating
exploration. RSM argued that the Agreement was still in force, while St. Lucia argued that
the Agreement has expired or at least was not enforceable due to force majeure. The present
annulment proceeding relates however to the Award issued by the Tribunal that dismissed
the case with prejudice and the disqualification decision issued by the majority of the

Tribunal with respect of Dr. Gavan Griffith, arbitrator.

FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On March 30, 2012, ICSID received a request for arbitration from RSM against St. Lucia
(the “RFA”).

On April 23, 2012, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the RfA in accordance with
Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In the
Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an
arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of

Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

On August 6, 2013, a Tribunal composed of Prof. Siegfried H. Elsing, a national of
Germany, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Judge Edward Nottingham, a
national of the United States of America, appointed by RSM; and Dr. Gavan Griffith Q.C.,

a national of Australia, appointed by St. Lucia, was constituted.

On September 6, 2013, St. Lucia filed a request for provisional measures seeking (1) a
provisional measure requiring RSM to post security for costs in the form of an irrevocable
bank guarantee for USD 750,000, pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and
Arbitration Rule 39; and (2) an order requiring RSM to pay all costs advances during the
pendency of the arbitration, pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation
14(3)(d) and Arbitration Rule 28(1)(a). Both Parties briefed the request, and the Tribunal
held its first session and a hearing on provisional measures with the Parties on October 4,

2013.

On December 12, 2013, the Tribunal issued a Decision on St. Lucia’s Request for
Provisional Measures whereby it ordered RSM to pay all costs advances pursuant to ICSID
Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and Arbitration Rule 28(1)(a), and
adjourned St. Lucia’s request for an order requiring RSM to post security for costs for USD

750,000.
On January 24, 2014, RSM filed its Memorial on the Merits.

On June 6, 2014, St. Lucia filed its Counter-Memorial on the Merits, and reiterated its
request for an order obliging RSM to post security for costs in addition to its request to order
that RSM bear all outstanding advances, that was dealt with in the Tribunal’s decision of

December 12, 2013.

On August 13, 2014, the Tribunal issued its Security for Costs Decision, together with Dr.
Griffith’s assenting reasons (the “First Assenting Opinion”) and Judge Nottingham’s
dissenting opinion. It directed RSM to post security for costs in the form of an irrevocable

bank guarantee for USD 750,000 within 30 days of the Decision.

On September 10, 2014, RSM submitted a proposal for the disqualification of Dr. Gavan
Griffith. On October 23, 2014, Prof. Elsing and Judge Nottingham issued their Decision on
RSM’s Proposal for the Disqualification of Dr. Gavan Griffith, in which they declined
RSM’s proposal (the “Challenge Decision”).

On December 15, 2014, RSM informed the Tribunal that it would be unable to provide a

USD 750,000 bank guarantee or place that amount in escrow.

On December 24, 2014, St. Lucia filed a request for the discontinuation of proceedings, to
which RSM objected on January 5, 2015. Another round of pleadings was then exchanged

on the issue respectively on January 23 and February 4, 2015.
On January 15, 2015, RSM filed its Reply memorial on the merits.

On April 8, 2015, the Tribunal issued a Decision on St. Lucia’s request for Suspension or
Discontinuation of Proceedings (the “Vacatur Decision’) with assenting reasons from Judge

Nottingham. The Tribunal directed as follows:!

(i) The deadline for Respondent’s Rejoinder and the hearing dates are vacated
and, subject to (ii) below, the procedural directions of hearings are stayed

until further order.

(ii) The vacatur will be lifted if Claimant [RSM] within six months as of the
date of this decision [ie., by October 8, 2015] provides security for costs in
the amount of USD 750,000, as directed by the Security for Costs Decision
as modified on August 20, 2014.

(iii) In default of (ii) Respondent is granted leave to apply to the Tribunal for a
Final Award for dismissal, with costs or such other orders as it may be ad-

vised.
(iv) All other procedural requests are dismissed.

(v) The decision regarding the costs of Respondent’s application remains re-

served until a later stage in these proceedings.

By letter of October 13, 2015, on behalf of the Tribunal, the Secretariat informed the Parties
that the vacatur period as ordered in the Vacatur Decision expired on October 8, 2015, and
that the Tribunal had noted that RSM did not provide for the security for costs as referred

to under (ii) of the Vacatur Decision.

On November 24, 2015, St. Lucia filed a request for a final Award.

On February 9, 2016, RSM filed its reply to St. Lucia’s request for a final Award.
On February 17, 2016, St. Lucia filed its response to RSM’s reply on a final Award.
On March 11, 2016, RSM filed its rejoinder to St. Lucia’s response on a final Award.

The Parties thereafter presented their submissions on costs and the Tribunal closed the

proceedings on June 13, 2016.

On July 15, 2016, the Tribunal rendered its Award (the “Award”), along with an assenting
opinion of Dr. Griffith (the “Second Assenting Opinion”). The Tribunal directed and

ordered as follows:?
(i) All Claimant [RSM]’s prayers for relief are dismissed.

(ii) Costs of the Proceedings are fixed at USD 615,670.25. Claimant [RSM] is

ordered to bear all Costs of the Proceedings.

(iii) Claimant [RSM] is ordered to reimburse Respondent’s legal and other costs
in the amount of USD 291,153.76 plus interest at the rate of 3 months
LIBOR plus 4% per annum from the notification of the Award until full and

final payment.
(iv) All further prayers for relief submitted by the Parties are dismissed.

On November 12, 2016, ICSID received an Application for Annulment (the “Application’”)
from RSM. The Application for Annulment was made within the time-period provided in
Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention. RSM sought annulment of the Award based on the

following three grounds:

e The Tribunal was not properly constituted because Dr. Griffith allegedly did not

possess the required impartiality;

e The Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers because it (i) improperly ordered
RSM to post a security for costs before any hearing on the merits while the ICSID
Convention does not provide for such; (ii) vacated the proceedings when there are
no provisions to this effect in the ICSID Convention; and (iii) dismissed the case
due to RSM’s failure to post the security while it had no such authority under the
ICSID Convention; and

e = The Tribunal departed from the fundamental rules of procedure because Dr. Griffith
did not possess the required impartiality and participated in all the stages of the

decision-making.
On November 21, 2016, the Acting Secretary-General registered the Application.

By letter of December 19, 2016, the Parties were informed that, in accordance with Article
52(3) of the ICSID Convention, the Centre planned to recommend to the Chairman of the
Administrative Council the appointment of Prof. Andreas Bucher, a national of Switzerland,
Prof. Donald McRae, a national of Canada, and Mr. Alexis Mourre, a national of the France
to the ad hoc Committee (the “Committee”) and were invited to submit any comments by

December 23, 2016.

By email of December 23, 2016, RSM confirmed that it had no objections to the Committee
as proposed in ICSID’s December 19, 2016 letter. By email of December 27, 2016, St.

Lucia confirmed that it was likewise amenable to the proposed Committee.

By letter of December 27, 2016, ICSID informed the Parties that the Centre would proceed

to seek the candidates’ acceptance of their appointments.

On January 4, 2017, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”), notified the Parties that
all three Committee Members had accepted their appointments and that the Committee was
therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Aurélia Antonietti, Senior Legal

Adviser, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Committee.

Following exchanges regarding the date of the first session, by email of January 26, 2017,

RSM requested that the first session be delayed for a period of three months.

By letter of February 3, 2017, St. Lucia stated it was willing to accept the postponement
subject to (i) the delay being for a period of only one month and (ii) the request being granted

only if RSM paid the first advance payment, requested on January 4, 2017.

By email of February 6, 2017, the Committee invited RSM to provide its comments on St.

Lucia’s letter of February 3, 2017, and to confirm the status of the first advance payment.

By email of February 24, 2017, RSM informed the Centre that Mr. John L. Morgan had
been appointed as the receiver over the business of RSM by the District Court of the
Arapahoe County, State of Colorado and would need time to acquaint himself with the
annulment proceeding and related financials. RSM therefore requested a one-month

extension to revert to the Committee on the status of the first advance payment.

By email of February 24, 2017, the Committee invited St. Lucia to provide its views on

RSM’s updated request.

By letter of March 1, 2017, St. Lucia agreed to a delay of one month from RSM’s letter, i.e.
until March 24, 2017, but no longer.

By email of March 7, 2017, the Committee granted RSM until March 27, 2017 to provide

an update on the status of the case.

By email of March 28, 2017, RSM confirmed that the receiver had granted it the right to
continue with the annulment proceeding and intended to make the first advance payment by

April 3, 2017. ICSID confirmed receipt of the payment on April 10, 2017.

By email of April 10, 2017, the Committee invited the Parties to provide their comments on
the dates for the first session and whether it was to be held in person or by teleconference.

Both Parties agreed to a teleconference.

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the ad hoc Committee held a first session

with the Parties on May 16, 2017 by teleconference.

Following the first session, on June 2, 2017, the ad hoc Committee issued Procedural Order
No. 1 recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters. Procedural Order No. 1
provides, inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from April
10, 2006, that the procedural language would be English, and that the place of proceeding
would be Washington, D.C. Procedural Order No. | also set out the agreed schedule for the

proceedings, which was later modified by agreement of the Parties.

In accordance with the amended schedule, on September 8, 2017, RSM filed its Memorial

on Annulment (the “Memorial”) with accompanying documentation.

By letter of December 13, 2017, St. Lucia requested leave to submit new factual exhibits

into the record.

By letter of December 18, 2017, RSM requested that the Committee reject St. Lucia’s
request of December 13, 2017, and strike Annex A of the request, the list of proposed

exhibits, from the record.

By letter of December 19, 2017, St. Lucia reiterated its request that the documents listed in

Annex A of its December 13, 2017 letter be submitted into to the record.

By letter of December 20, 2017, RSM reaffirmed its position that St. Lucia’s request be

denied, and that Annex A be excluded from the record.

By letter of December 20, 2017, the Committee (i) admitted the documents requested by St.
Lucia into the record and (ii) moved the deadline for the filing of St. Lucia’s Counter-
Memorial on Annulment, which had previously been scheduled for that day, to December

22, 2017.

On December 21, 2017, St. Lucia filed its Counter-Memorial with accompanying

documentation (the “Counter-Memorial”).
On April 16, 2018, RSM filed its Reply with accompanying documentation (the “Reply”).

On August 8, 2018, St. Lucia filed its Rejoinder with accompanying documentation (the

“Rejoinder”).

On October 24, 2018, the Committee held a pre-hearing conference with the Parties, in
which it was decided, inter alia, that the hearing would be limited to one day, November

15, 2018.

On November 15, 2018, a hearing on Annulment was held in Washington, D.C. (the

“Hearing”). The following persons were present at the Hearing:

submitted a reply on April 5, 2019. RSM did not file a reply submission.

THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

RSM’s POSITION

RSM seeks annulment of the Award under Article 52(1) of ICSID Convention and asserts
that it is entitled to request the Committee to annul the Award in consideration of the role
of the ad hoc Committee, the nature of annulment, and the applicable threshold (1). It further
denies that it had not raised the underlying arguments submitted in this proceeding in the

arbitration proceeding (2).

As to the annulment grounds, RSM contends that the Tribunal was improperly constituted
as Dr. Griffith was not removed from the Tribunal and that the Tribunal departed from a
fundamental rule of procedure because Dr. Griffith lacked impartiality (3). RSM further
argues that the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers by ordering a provisional
measure, requiring security for costs, and suspending the arbitration and then dismissing

RSM’s claims with prejudice (4).

57.

61.

(1) Role of the ad hoc Committee, nature of annulment and applicable threshold

RSM seeks the annulment of the Award on the basis of the Award and “the Tribunal’s
determinations in its earlier decisions, in particular the Security for Costs Decision and the

03

Vacatur Decision,”” that were incorporated in the Award.4

RSM agrees with St. Lucia that annulment proceedings are about reviewing the integrity of
an arbitration. However, it submits that the Committee can annul the Award on the ground
of manifest excess of powers> “where a Tribunal has failed to apply the agreed law, or has
attempted to apply the law but ultimately did not do so,” or if a tribunal has “applied the

law so grossly or egregiously that it amounts to a non-application of the law.””

RSM argues that “there is no presumption either in favour or against annulment. The
grounds for annulment are to be examined in a neutral, reasonable and appropriate way,
neither narrowly nor extensively.”® It rejects Respondent’s view which deems the threshold
for annulling an award “exceptionally high.”?

Ad hoc committees have the discretion to annul an award or not, considering “all relevant
circumstances, including the gravity of the circumstances which constitute the ground for
annulment and whether these circumstances had — or could have had — a material effect

upon the outcome of the case.”!°

Relying on EDF v. Argentina,'! RSM submits that it is sufficient to establish that Dr.

Griffith’s lack of impartiality “could have had a material effect” '*

on the award to justify
its annulment under Articles 52(1)(a) and 52(1)(d). Dr. Griffith’s participation in the

deliberations of the Security for Costs Decision, the Vacatur Decision and the Award means

that Dr. Griffith’s lack of impartiality could have had a material effect on all three decisions.
RSM adds that “Dr. Griffith’s involvement did have a material effect on at least the Security

313

for Costs Decision”! as “without Dr Griffith, there would not have been a majority to order

a security for costs and RSM’s claims would subsequently not have been dismissed for

noncompliance with the Security for Costs Decision.”!*

Regarding the annulment ground under Article 52(1)(b), RSM contends that the “majority
Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers first by ordering RSM to post security and then,
following RSM’s failure to do so, by vacating the hearing and dismissing the claims with
prejudice.”!> The Tribunal thereby had a material impact on the outcome of the case,
depriving RSM of its “contractual right under the Agreement and its right under the ICSID
Convention to have its case determined on the merits by an independent and impartial

tribunal.”!°

(2) RSM did not fail to make arguments in the arbitration proceeding

RSM challenges St. Lucia’s allegations that “a party cannot apply for the annulment of an

award on the basis of arguments or evidence that it failed to raise in the arbitration.”!”

Regarding the annulment ground of Dr. Griffith’s bias under Article 52(1)(a) and (d), RSM
asserts that “Dr Griffith’s bias was raised in the arbitration in the context of the challenge
proceedings under Article 57 of the ICSID Convention in the arbitration.”!*

Regarding the annulment ground that the Tribunal did not have the power or authority to
order security for costs under Article 52(1)(b),'? RSM declares having “repeatedly raised

20

this issue in the arbitration,””” in its “first submission in response to Saint Lucia’s request

for provisional measures,”*' in “its second submission,”** and in a letter to the Tribunal

after the issuance of the Security for Costs Decision.”*

66. Regarding the annulment ground that security for costs does not preserve an existing right
under Article 52(1)(b),7* RSM indicates that it raised this issue since it has been noted in

the Security for Costs Decision.”°

67. Regarding the annulment ground of the direct sanctions that the Tribunal imposed for non-
compliance with the Security for Costs Decision under Article 52(1)(b),7° RSM contends
that “RSM argued in its Opposition to Discontinuation dated January 5, 2015 and its
Discontinuation Rejoinder dated 4 February 2015 that the Tribunal did not have the power
to either discontinue and/or suspend the arbitration for non-compliance. In its Final Award,

the Tribunal acknowledged that RSM had made arguments in relation to this power.”””

68. | RSM denies making new arguments in the annulment proceeding and claims that it is “at
most [...] only further developing arguments that were already made in the arbitration and

fleshing out the grounds for annulment.”

(3) Arbitrator’s lack of impartiality
a. The annulment grounds

69. RSM alleges that Dr. Griffith was biased or at least appeared to be biased and therefore did
not possess the requisite qualification of impartiality demanded by Article 14(1) of the

ICSID Convention,” requiring the annulment of the Award on the grounds of “the improper

constitution of the tribunal (Article 52(1)(a)) and a serious departure from a fundamental

rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)).”*°

Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention requires arbitrators to exercise independent and
impartial judgment. A tribunal is not properly constituted if one (or more) of its members
do not possess the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.
Therefore, a lack of the qualities in Article 14(1), such as a lack of impartiality, may serve

as ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(a).*!

RSM contends that “[s]everal ad hoc Committees have ruled that the presence on a tribunal
of an arbitrator who does not possess the qualities required under Article 14(1) of the ICSID
Convention, such as the requirement of impartiality, constitutes a serious departure from a
fundamental rule of procedure,” justifying the annulment of the Award under Article

52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention.**

RSM considers that the applicable standard under both Articles 52(1)(a) and 52(1)(d) is the
reasonable doubt test adopted by the jurisprudence “according to which an arbitrator does
not meet the requirements if there is an ‘appearance of dependence or bias’ or ‘a reasonable
third party, with knowledge of all the facts, would consider that there were reasonable
grounds for doubting that an arbitrator possessed the requisite qualities of independence and

impartiality.””>

b. Scope of ad hoc Committee’s review and applicable test

Relying on Article 51(2)(a) and the drafting history of the ICSID Convention, RSM
contends that “an ad hoc committee is not bound or in any other way limited by the factual
and/or legal findings made in challenge proceedings” and should review de novo the facts
and legal issues regarding the questioned arbitrator’s impartiality.** This entails that “any

ad hoc committee has a self-standing duty to review whether the members of the tribunal

did (or did not) meet the requirements of impartiality” under Article 14(1) of the ICSID

Convention.*>

74. Relying on the drafting history, RSM contends that the drafters have not limited the duty of
the committees* and that there was no rule against the fact that “the proper constitution of
the Tribunal would possibly be reviewed twice” at the stage of the arbitration and at the

stage of the annulment.*”

75. RSM objects to the finding of the Azurix Committee as well as the findings of the EDF and

Suez Committees.**

76. RSM stands against the Azurix position®? according to which, in particular, the matter of an
arbitrator lacking the requisite qualities “could not be a basis for annulment but could only
be raised by way of proceedings for the revision of the award under Article 51,” if the facts

are unveiled after the arbitration has been closed.*°

77. RSM further considers that the reasonableness test upheld in recent committees does not
apply. It challenges the findings of the EDF v. Argentina and Suez v. Argentina
Committees*! that ruled that “the scope of an ad hoc committee’s review would be limited
to reviewing the reasonableness of the challenge decision” and that found an exception

decision-maker could have come to such a decision.”** RSM contends that those decisions

are not binding and can be “severely criticized and/or distinguished from this case.”4

RSM stresses the different role of the ad hoc committee reconsidering a challenge decision;
it is not sitting in an appeal of a challenge decision because it considers “different issues
and the consequences of its decision are different from the consequences of a challenge
decision.”“4 RSM also stresses that a challenge decision is not taken by the tribunal, it is not
an award, but a decision taken by another entity, i.e. the two non-challenged members of a
tribunal or the ICSID Chairman.** “At most, an ad hoc Committee would sit in review of a
third party. There is no authority whatsoever to argue that an ad hoc committee’s review of

a third-party decision should be anything less than a full, de novo review.”*°

RSM further highlights that Article 52(1)(a) contains no qualifying language.*” and that

such an absence shows the drafters’ intention not to limit the role of ad hoc committees.**

Should the ad hoc Committee agree with the reasoning adopted in EDF v. Argentina and
Suez v. Argentina, those cases are to be distinguished from the present case’ since the “ad
hoc Committee is requested to consider facts that were before the deciding arbitrators in the
challenge procedure because those facts only occurred after the challenge decision was
issued and after the arbitration proceeding was closed.”*° Thus, the new facts, not analysed
in the challenge decision, justify not limiting the scope of review to the reasonableness of

the challenge decision.*! However, due to the “inseverable connection to the ‘old’ facts”,

the new facts must be considered along the old facts by the Committee to decide on the

annulment of the Award.*?

c. Facts relevant to determine lack of impartiality

RSM contends that both annulment grounds “that the Tribunal was not properly constituted
(Article 52(1)(a)) and the arbitration was tainted by a serious departure from a fundamental
rule of procedure (Article 52(1)(d)) [...] turn on Dr Griffith’s presence on the Tribunal.”
“[A] reasonable third party would consider that there are reasonable grounds for doubting
that Dr Griffith met the impartiality requirement under Article 14(1) of the ICSID

Convention.”*4

The relevant factors to determine the alleged lack of impartiality are (i) Dr. Griffith’s First
Assenting Opinion revealing his bias in favour of Respondent States and St. Lucia and his
bias against funded claimants such as RSM, and thus his determination of the case on the
basis of influences other than the facts and the merits;>° (ii) his failure to provide comments
after RSM’s challenge*® that was eventually rejected by non-challenged members of the
Tribunal;>’ (iii) his Second Assenting Opinion attached to the Award providing “additional
comments on the First [Assenting] Opinion”;** (iv) in which he “backtracked” from the

First Assenting Opinion.*°

According to RSM, the Second Assenting Opinion and the alleged backtracking are new

matters that Messrs. Elsing and Nottingham did not review.

funded claimants such as RSM,”*! as he used “mercantile adventurers” to describe third-

party funders in a pejorative way®?.

85. Should EDF and Suez be followed, RSM further submits that the Challenge Decision was
unreasonable since Dr. Griffith’s views were not related to the merits of the case, it only
took the terminology into account and not its context or other relevant matters,
notwithstanding the radical and extreme language used, and refused to take objective

evidence into account through the eyes of a neutral third party.

(4) Manifest excess of powers

86. The Tribunal’s alleged excess of powers relates to the following:

e = The Tribunal did not recommend provisional measures but ordered RSM to post
security for costs, hence ignoring Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and

rewriting the law.

e The Tribunal required security for costs, even though such security does not

preserve a “right” of a party.
e The Tribunal suspended the proceeding and dismissed the case with prejudice.

a. Standard for annulment under Article 52(1)(b)

87. According to RSM, the Committee must determine “whether RSM and Saint Lucia agreed

to grant the Tribunal the power to order biding provisional measures.”

Relying on Malaysian Historical Salvors v. Malaysia, RSM points out the importance of
the drafting of the history of the ICSID Convention. It also argues that an excess of power

can be manifest even when case law shows that an interpretation can go either way.

b. Manifest excess of power by ordering a provisional measure

RSM contends that the Tribunal rewrote the law by ordering a provisional measure®” and
failed to apply the law, thereby amounting to a non-application,® hence manifestly

exceeding its powers.

RSM submits that the Tribunal went beyond the Parties’ agreement. Article 26 of the
Concession Agreement between RSM and St. Lucia did not grant the Tribunal the power to
order binding provisional measures, and only provided for the award to be final and

binding.

In any event, Article 47 does not empower the Tribunal to order a binding provisional

measure, except as otherwise agreed by the parties.

From a textual standpoint and based on the history of the ICSID Convention retraced in
detail, RSM recalls that the word prescribe was rejected and submits that the term
recommend finally adopted had no legal binding effect, as accepted by leading authors and

the case law.”

The reliance on the case law from the International Court of Justice is inapposite, as Article
41 of the Statute of the Court which uses the term indicate is not subject to any deviation

by the parties unlike Article 47.7!

From a contextual standpoint, the ICSID Convention, the Rules and the AF Rules “confirm
that the interpretation that a recommendation is not binding and that a ‘recommendation’
cannot be understood as an ‘order’.””? The fact that the Spanish version of Rule 39(1)
employs the verb “dictar” while it uses recommend in other places is a contradiction in the
text and is not indicative.” In addition, Arbitration Rule 39 uses the term recommend, while

the AF Arbitration Rule 46 uses order.”4

RSM contends that the object and purpose of the treaty further militates against a tribunal

ordering binding provisional measures.”°

Looking at the ICSID jurisprudence, RSM acknowledges that some decisions have adopted
the majority’s view but recalls that there is no rule of precedent and that those decisions got
it wrong. RSM rejects the notion of jurisprudence constante used by St. Lucia in that

regard.”

RSM distinguishes the binding character of a decision and its enforceability. The former
deals with a party’s obligation to comply and abide by the terms of a decision. Related to it
is the power to sanction non-compliance. The latter relates to the obligation of the

contracting state to recognize an ICSID award.””

RSM further rejects St. Lucia’s argument that tribunals could have inherent powers to order
a provisional measure, as there cannot be inherent powers when a statutory or contractual

provision applies.”

c. Manifest excess of power by requiring security for costs

RSM contends that the majority of the Tribunal sought to preserve St. Lucia’s right to seek

reimbursement of its costs in case of a favourable award. However, such a right does not

exist,” as acknowledged by various decisions.*° This is an excess of power as a tribunal’s

power is limited to measures that preserve existing rights only.*!

From a textual standpoint, the right to costs only arises at the end of the proceeding in the
award, hence “one can obviously not preserve, maintain or protect something that does not
exist yet.”* Contrary to St. Lucia’s assertion, security for costs does not protect “the right

to seek an award on costs.”*?

Ordering security for costs actually disrupted the status quo improving St. Lucia’s

collection position instead of preserving the status quo.**

From a contextual standpoint, the power to post security for costs was discussed in the
negotiating process of the ICSID Convention, but it was concluded that it would not be

furnished without the prior consent of the parties.*°

The Administrative and Financial Regulations provides mechanisms for the direct costs of
the proceedings. The parties’ fees and expenses are not covered by such mechanisms,
indicating that they have not been granted a right to collect their potential fees and

expenses.®°

Finally, RSM points out that the object and purpose of the ICSID Convention militates for

access to justice, equality of treatment, and no prejudgement.*’

d. Manifest excess of power by suspending the arbitration and
dismissing RSM’s claims

By imposing a sanction for RSM’s non-compliance namely, the “dismissal of RSM’s claims

9988

with prejudice by way of a Final Award,”** the Tribunal exceeded its power under Article

44 second sentence of the ICSID Convention. The Tribunal had no such powers.*?

For RSM, the Tribunal in the Award found that it had inherent power to fill a gap, when

there was no such gap.

RSM points out that neither the Convention nor the Arbitration Rules contain an express
provision dealing with sanctions for non-compliance with provisional measures. The

question is whether this was “a qualified silence or an unintended gap.””°

Given that the issues of sanctions for non-compliance were discussed at length and voted
upon during the negotiation and drafting, the silence is “anything but unintended.”*!
According to RSM, “the proposed power to prescribe binding provisional measures and to
impose sanctions for non-compliance with provisional measures was knowingly and
willingly omitted from the ICSID Convention. The drafters of the Convention and
subsequently the Contracting States only empowered tribunals to ‘recommend’ provisional
measures. As parties retained the freedom to comply or not with such measures, it was not

appropriate to provide for direct sanctions for non-compliance.”

The Tribunal thus exceeded its power by interpreting the qualified silence as an unintended

gap and by using its power to fill that gap.”

Lastly, RSM contends that Article 44 of the ICSID Convention only empowers tribunals to

decide questions of procedure, while the issues of sanctions, relief and remedies are issues

of substance.*4 “As a consequence of the Tribunal’s alleged procedural decisions RSM’s

USD 600 million claims were dismissed with prejudice.

95

RSM also submits that “Article 44 second sentence does not empower tribunals to take

decisions on important issues such as the suspension of the arbitration, or, even more

importantly, the dismissal of the claims with prejudice,”®® but only empowers tribunals to

decide procedural issues of minor importance.

there has been a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure;

the Tribunal has manifestly exceeded its powers by ordering provisional

measures;

St. LUCIA’S POSITION

St. Lucia submits that RSM “believes that it is entitled to choose when it wants to pay, and

98

when it does not,””® and “to abandon proceedings that it considers are not going its way,

and then mount collateral attacks impugning the integrity of those who have ruled against
it?

St. Lucia recalls that RSM’s funding in the arbitration was terminated because Dr. Griffith
remained on the Tribunal, and that is the reason why RSM did not provide security for

costs.!? St. Lucia submits that once more RSM is abusing the ICSID system.'°!

St. Lucia examined the nature of annulment proceedings (1), before moving on to RSM’s
grounds based on the Challenge Decision (2), and to the manifest excess of power

grounds (3).

(1) The nature of annulment proceedings

St. Lucia recalls that an annulment proceeding is not an appeal. It is “an exceptional remedy
available only in extraordinary cases of gross departures from basic principles.”!°? St. Lucia
points out that RSM has not come close to satisfying its burden of proof. The threshold is

extremely high.!%

St. Lucia further recalls that “an annulment committee must confine its review to the
arguments and evidence put before the tribunal in the arbitration; newly conceived
arguments that a party could have raised during the arbitration, but did not, cannot be
considered.”! For this reason, new arguments of fact or law are inadmissible on

annulment.!%

(2) The grounds based on the Challenge Decision

Regarding the grounds based on Dr. Griffith’s alleged bias and on a violation of a
fundamental rule of procedure, St. Lucia considers that they amount to an impermissible
appeal attempt based on the argument that the deciding members of the Tribunal reached

the wrong conclusion in rejecting RSM’s challenge to Dr. Griffith.'°°

a. Standards for annulment under Article 52(1)(a) and (d)

Regarding the improper constitution of the Tribunal, St. Lucia submits that the ground of
Article 52(1)(a) can only relate to the constitution of the tribunal, not to a challenge decision.

The same applies for the ground of Article 52(1)(d).!°”

St. Lucia contends that two lines of case law have emerged on how to treat an arbitrator
challenge, the first approach being Azurix v. Argentina, the second one being EDF v.
Argentina as well as Suez v. Argentina, and that they all rejected the de novo review

advocated by RSM. !°8
RSM?’s attempts to distinguish the present case from these decisions are meritless.'°

A resort to supplementary means of interpretation is also not needed, but in any event a

review of the ICSID drafting history does not help RSM.!'!°

Contrary to what RSM asserts, a committee does not assess different issues in a
disqualification decision from those examined by the tribunal. Whether Dr. Griffith lacked
the qualities required by Article 14(1) was analysed and resolved by the unchallenged

arbitrators.!!!

plainly unreasonable result
St. Lucia considers that the Tribunal reasonably rejected RSM’s attack on the substance of
Dr. Griffith’s view. A dissenting opinion cannot form the basis of a ground for
disqualification.''* Dr. Griffith had taken no view as to whether RSM’s claims were

St. Lucia further considers that the Tribunal reasonably concluded that the manner in which
Dr. Griffith expressed his views did not justify disqualification.!'’ His choice of wording

118

should not have led to a disqualification,''” and he did consider the facts of the case.!!9

Finally, the fact that Dr. Griffith did not provide an additional explanation when challenged

does not prove a lack of impartiality.

(3) No manifest excess of powers

129. St. Lucia argues that “[t]he sole consideration for the Committee is whether the Tribunal
‘identified the applicable law and endeavored to apply it’,”!° not the alleged errors in its

application. The failure to apply the law must be in toto.'*!

130. “[AJn excess of powers must be manifest on the face of the award, de novo review of an
award is beyond the scope of the annulment committee’s mandate and legal (or factual)

error is insufficient to annul an award ... .”!??

131. Where more than one interpretation of a provision is possible, there can be by definition no

excess of powers.!?*

b. No manifest excess of powers by ordering provisional measures

132. According to St. Lucia, RSM disagrees with the interpretation given by the Tribunal of
Article 47 which cannot provide a basis for annulment under Article 52(1)(b),'74 as an

erroneous interpretation or application of the law is not a basis for annulment.

133. The Tribunal did not fail to apply the law,'?° and it did not do it so wrongly that it would
amount to a non-application of the law.'?° Even if the “error” would amount to non-

application of the applicable law, the manifest requirement would not be met.!?’

134. In any event, a jurisprudence constante has consistently endorsed the Tribunal’s

interpretation, which precludes a finding of excess of powers, much less a manifest one.!?8

RSM cites decisions that do not support its position.'?? The same applies to a commentary

relied on by RSM.!°°

RSM failed to raise the arguments concerning the binding character of provisional measures

St. Lucia submits that in any event RSM’s entirely novel interpretation of Article 47 is
meritless. Relying on Perenco v. Ecuador,'* St. Lucia recalls the case law that has equated
recommend to order and that such an order can be binding without being enforceable in

domestic courts.

AD HOC COMMITTEE’S ANALYSIS

THE NATURE OF ANNULMENT PROCEEDINGS

While the Parties are broadly in agreement that the objective of annulment proceedings is
the protection of the integrity of the ICSID arbitral process, they differ in the implications
this carries for the approach of ad hoc committees. The Respondent sees annulment as an
“exceptional remedy” applicable only to gross departures from fundamental procedures. By
contrast, RSM considers that there is no presumption either for or against annulment and

that the grounds for annulment are to be construed neither narrowly nor extensively. The

consequence for St. Lucia is that there is a high threshold to establish an annulment claim;

for RSM the burden is no different than in any other claim.

In the view of the Committee, there is no presumption one way or another about an
annulment process. The criteria for annulment set out in Article 52 of the ICSID Convention
are to be interpreted, as provided in Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of
Treaties, in good faith and in accordance with their ordinary meaning, in their context and
in light of the object and purpose of the treaty as a whole. The provisions in Article 52 may
be described as exceptional in the sense that Article 52 provides limited grounds for
annulment but that has no impact on the way the provisions are to be interpreted and applied

by the Committee.

A corollary for St. Lucia is that arguments raised in annulment proceedings must be
confined to those already raised in the arbitration and an ad hoc annulment committee
cannot base its decision on new facts or new arguments presented at the annulment stage.
RSM argues that in any event it is not relying on new facts or new arguments. All of the

issues raised by it were raised in the original arbitration.

The Committee does not consider that there is anything for it to decide on this matter.
Obviously, the annulment stage is not one where facts not before the Tribunal can be
introduced. At the same time, the arguments raised on annulment are those that relate to the
grounds for annulment, which themselves need not have been raised in the original
arbitration. An applicant cannot be inhibited from raising arguments in annulment relating
to the interpretation or application of Article 52 that best support its position. However, the

Committee does not see this as an issue in the present case.

THE DISQUALIFICATION OF AN ARBITRATOR

RSM argues that the requirements of Article 52(1)(a) that the Tribunal be properly
constituted were not met because one of the arbitrators did not meet the requirement of
impartiality required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention. RSM also argues that the
inclusion of the arbitrator amounted to a serious departure from a fundamental rule of

procedure, and hence contrary to Article 52(1)(d) of the Convention.

30

159.

RSM argues that the First Assenting Opinion of the arbitrator, on the question of ordering
security for costs, showed bias against third party funding and therefore bias against a party
like RSM which was being funded by a third party. This was reinforced by the failure of the
arbitrator to provide any comments on the challenge to him by RSM when given the
opportunity to do so and by his Second Assenting Opinion where he appeared to backtrack

from the views in his First Assenting Opinion.

St. Lucia characterizes the RSM’s position as an impermissible attempt to invite the
Committee to engage in an appeal since the issue of arbitrator impartiality was decided by
the unchallenged arbitrators in accordance with Article 58 of the Convention. According to
St. Lucia, RSM is, in essence, trying to appeal that decision. RSM contends, however, that
the Committee is not bound by the conclusions made under the challenge procedure and
that it is for the Committee to review de novo the question whether the arbitrator met the

standards of impartiality.

St. Lucia rejects the view that there can be a de novo review of the challenge to an arbitrator
arguing that this has been consistently rejected in the arbitral jurisprudence, citing the
decisions of annulment Committees in Azurix v. Argentina and EDF v. Argentina. However,
RSM argues that this does not give sufficient weight to the fact that the travaux
préparatoires provide no basis for an exclusion of de novo review from the powers of an
ad hoc committee and in this case part of the evidence for the allegation of impartiality is

based on evidence arising after the decision by the unchallenged members of the Tribunal.

In considering this matter, the Committee makes two preliminary observations.

First, in accordance with Article 58 of the Convention it is the unchallenged members of a
tribunal who decide on a challenge to an arbitrator. Thus, decisions on challenge are not
decisions of the tribunal. Since it is the award of a tribunal that can be annulled, an ad hoc
committee has no power of annulment with respect to a challenge decision, even if it has
been declared incorporated in the award. However, that does not preclude a committee from
taking into account a challenge decision when deciding whether the terms of Article

52(1)(a) have been met and a tribunal has been properly constituted.

31

160.

161.

162.

163.

Second, ad hoc committees are divided on the standard of review to apply when considering
a challenge decision. The most prominent division is between the position taken by the
tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina and the decision of the tribunal in EDF v. Argentina. The ad
hoc Committee in Azurix limited review to determining whether the unchallenged
arbitrators had failed to comply properly with the procedure for challenging members of the
tribunal.!°? The ad hoc Committee in EDF considered that there should be no annulment
unless the decision of the unchallenged arbitrators not to disqualify an arbitrator “was so
plainly unreasonable that no reasonable decision-maker could have come to such a
decision.”!*? However, RSM rejects the approach of both tribunals and uses neither in its
arguments for annulment. Thus, the Committee sees no need to form its own opinion about

the approaches in those cases.

The primary argument of RSM is that ad hoc committees are entitled to engage in a de novo
review of the challenge to the arbitrator for it is the committee itself that has to be satisfied
that the tribunal was properly constituted. RSM argues that there is nothing in the
Convention that prohibits a tribunal from conducting such a review and that the assertion
of a standard of review in cases such as EDF have simply no basis in the provisions of the
Convention. Furthermore, RSM argues, in the present case de novo review is required
because certain factors relevant to the impartiality of the arbitrator in question were not
available to the unchallenged arbitrators since they arose after the decision of the

unchallenged members.

In order to assess these arguments, the Committee will consider the basis for the challenge
to the arbitrator in this case and the circumstances alleged by RSM to establish that the

tribunal was not properly constituted.

The challenge to the impartiality of Dr. Griffith was made on the basis that he had expressed
views in his Assenting Decision on the request for security of costs. In that Opinion he had

referred to third party funders as “mercantile adventurers” and had linked third party

'82 Azurix v. Argentina, para. 280.
‘83 EDF v. Argentina, para. 145.

32

164.

165.

166.

funding with “gambling.” RSM saw these views as “negative and radical in tone.”!* Its
conclusion was that Dr. Griffith saw third party funders and funded claimants as
undermining the integrity of foreign investor-state arbitration.'** RSM also points out that
Dr. Griffith failed to provide any comments to the challenge committee although requested
to do so, yet in his Second Assenting Opinion (with the Award) Dr. Griffith reverted to what
had been said in his First Assenting Opinion and backtracked from what had been said.
This, RSM says, is an admission that the views he had expressed in the First Assenting

Opinion were “negative and extreme and suggested bias.”!*°

The Committee has difficulty in seeing that what was said by Dr. Griffith demonstrated a
lack of impartiality contrary to Article 58 of the Convention or that his inclusion on the
Tribunal demonstrated that the tribunal was not properly constituted. And this is so whether
the Committee was entitled to engage in de novo review or whether the approaches taken

in either Azurix or EDF were to be followed.

In his First Assenting Opinion, Dr. Griffith was raising the important question of whether
third-party funding is a relevant consideration in determining whether there should be an
order for security of costs and the consequences if it were not. Dr. Griffith’s concern was
that the funder is not subject to the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction and therefore not legally
bound to comply with an adverse cost order. This has not been contested by RSM. Dr.
Griffith’s observation was thus directly applicable to the circumstances of the instant case.
To be sure, Dr. Griffith used some evocative language, but evocative language emphasizes
a point rather than evidencing bias. The point was an important one and Dr. Griffith used
language that would highlight it. Of course, as the unchallenged arbitrators pointed out in
their challenge decision, language can go too far and express another intent, but they, too,

considered that the language used by Dr. Griffith did not do that.!°”

Nor do the subsequent considerations relied on by RSM alter the situation. The fact that Dr.

Griffith did not submit any comments to the unchallenged members but referred to the issue

'S Memorial, para. 66.

171.

again in his Second Assenting Opinion does not carry the weight that RSM seeks to ascribe
to it. At most this provides clarification of what was said in the First Assenting Opinion but

it neither adds to nor subtracts from the conclusion that he did not lack impartiality.

In short, even if a de novo review were conducted, taking account of the considerations not
before the unchallenged members when they made their decision to reject the claim for
disqualification, there is no basis for concluding that Dr. Griffith lacked the necessary

impartiality required by Article 14(1) of the ICSID Convention.

Tf the question before the Committee was whether the unchallenged members had properly
complied with the procedures for considering a challenge to an arbitrator, there is no
allegation that they did not. If the question before the Committee was whether the decision
on challenge by the unchallenged arbitrators was reasonable or was so plainly unreasonable
that no reasonable decision-maker could have reached it, the answer of the Committee
would be that the Challenge Decision meets either a reasonableness or a not plainly

unreasonable test.

In short, the Committee finds no basis on which it can be concluded that Dr. Griffith’s
alleged lack of impartiality was a ground for deciding that the Tribunal was not properly
constituted within the meaning of Article 52(1)(a). Equally, for the same reasons, the
Committee does not find any basis on which it can be concluded that Dr. Griffith alleged
lack of impartiality would be a ground for deciding that there had been a substantial

departure from a fundamental rule of procedure within the meaning of Article 52(1)(d).

MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWER — ORDERING A PROVISIONAL MEASURE

RSM argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by ordering a provisional
measure instead of just recommending such a measure, and hence the Award can be

annulled by virtue of Article 52(1)(b).

The crux of this question is the meaning to be attached to Article 47 of the Convention,

which provides:

34,

172.

173.

174.

Except as the parties otherwise agree, the Tribunal may, if it
considers that the circumstances so require, recommend any
provisional measures which should be taken to preserve the
respective rights of either party.

The Tribunal had “ordered” the provisional measure in this case. RSM challenges this on
the ground that Article 47 gives a tribunal the power only to “recommend” a provisional
measure not to “order” such a measure. Article 47 contemplates the parties agreeing to vary
the terms of its provisions, including making orders instead of recommendations, but the
Parties have not done so here. St. Lucia argues that tribunals have consistently interpreted
Article 47 to equate a “recommendation” for a provisional measure with an “order” for a

provisional measure and hence give it binding effect.

The Committee begins with some preliminary observations. There is no doubt that Article
47 uses the word “recommend” and does not use the word “order.” Moreover, the
negotiating history makes clear that the word “recommend” was chosen deliberately instead
of the proposed alternative word “prescribe.”!** However, the negotiating history also made
clear that notwithstanding the use of the word “recommend” it was understood that
consequences could attach to non-compliance with a recommendation for provisional
measures. As Mr. Broches, the Chairman of the Legal Committee, pointed out after the vote
that retained the word “recommend” in Article 47, if recommendations were not carried out

“the Tribunal would undoubtedly take that fact into account when rendering its award.”!>?

In the view of the Committee, the issue is not whether the word “recommendation” can be
equated with the word “order” or whether one can characterize a recommendation as
binding. The issue is whether there can be any consequences for non-compliance with a
recommendation for provisional measures under Article 47, whether it is expressed in terms
of a recommendation or an order. Quite clearly, a recommendation for provisional measures

could not be enforced in the way that an award can be enforced in accordance with Article

'88 Christoph H. Schreuer, The ICSID Convention - A Commentary, second edition, para. 47-3, A/CLA-46.

178.

54 of the Convention. But that does not mean that it is not binding in the sense that

consequences can flow from non-compliance with a provisional measure.

The Committee also considers that what is being raised is the correct interpretation and
application of Article 47, which is a question of law and legal application, not something
within the mandate of an annulment committee. The Tribunal may be right or wrong as a
matter of law but that does not of itself constitute an excess of power. As is well recognized
the function of an ad hoc committee is not an appellate one. Furthermore, in the current
situation, where tribunals have differed on the implications of a recommendation for
provisional measures, and there is a significant number of decisions where such a
recommendation has been treated as an order, even if there were an excess of power, it could

hardly be “manifest.”

In the result, the Committee concludes that there was no manifest excess of power by the
Tribunal in making an “order” for provisional measures. Using the word “order” rather than
“recommend” cannot of itself constitute an excess of power, not to mention a manifest
excess of power, even though the Tribunal characterized its order as “binding.” The
question, which will be considered below, is what a tribunal can do when faced with non-

compliance with a recommendation or order for provisional measures.

MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWER — SECURITY FOR COSTS

RSM claims that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by making an order for
security of costs. It argues that under Article 47 provisional measures may be recommended
only to preserve existing rights. No right to costs arises until they have been ordered. Thus,
there was no existing right to preserve within the meaning of Article 47. Provisional
measures are designed to preserve the status quo but the Tribunal disrupted the status quo

by improving St. Lucia’s position.

St. Lucia argues that RSM simply disagrees with the Tribunal’s application of the law; this
is not a matter of the Tribunal exceeding its powers. Moreover, the Tribunal makes clear
that the preservation of rights can include conditional or future rights a view that has been

asserted by other tribunals as well.

36

179. The Committee is not convinced that ordering a provisional measure that required RSM to
post security for costs constituted a manifest excess of power. Article 47 imposes no
limitation on the nature of the rights to be preserved and thus does not exclude rights that
may be contingent. Thus, the fact that costs have yet to be ordered does not preclude an
order for security of those costs. Other tribunals have ordered security for costs as a
provisional measure! and thus, even if there were doubt about whether the ordering of

costs was an excess of power, it could not in any event be manifest.

180. Furthermore, the Tribunal recognized the limited nature of the power it was exercising. It
justified doing so because there were “exceptional circumstances.”!°! Those circumstances
related to the apprehension that RSM would not pay any costs ordered based on the
experience with RSM in other cases.'® There was also the circumstance of an undisclosed

third-party funder whose willingness to pay any costs award could not be ascertained.!®

181. Inshort, the Tribunal exercised a narrow and circumscribed jurisdiction, based on its powers
under Article 47, and the particular circumstances of this case, to require that security be
given for any costs that may be awarded against RSM. The Committee sees here no excess

of power let alone an excess of power that was manifest.

182. Accordingly, this claim for annulment under Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention is rejected.

MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWER — SUSPENDING THE ARBITRATION AND DISMISSING

RSM’s CLAIMS WITH PREJUDICE
RSM argues that the lack of any provision in the Convention for sanctioning a failure to
comply with a provisional measure was a deliberate omission and thus there was no gap for
the Tribunal to fill by invoking Article 44, second sentence, of the Convention. Moreover,
the power in the Tribunal under that provision deals with only procedural matters of minor
importance. As a result, implying a power under Article 44, second sentence, to suspend the
proceedings and then dismissing RSM’s claim with prejudice constitutes a manifest excess

of power by the Tribunal within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of the Convention.

St. Lucia argues that this again is an attempt to show that the Tribunal was wrong in law,

 

which is nothing more than an appeal of the Tribunal’s decision. It further argues that since
the Convention and Rules make no provision for the consequences of non-compliance with
an order for provisional measures, the Tribunal was perfectly entitled to exercise its power
under Article 44, second sentence, and make its own decision on the consequences of non-
compliance. Article 44, second sentence, St. Lucia argues, is not limited to procedural

matters of minor importance.

The Committee recalls that there were three stages involved in the process that led to the
Tribunal’s ultimate decision to discontinue the proceedings. First, there was an order by the
Tribunal for security for costs with RSM given 30 days to comply. Second, in face of the
failure of RSM to provide such security, there was a decision by the Tribunal suspending
the proceedings for a period of sixth months. Third, following the six-month period when
it was clear that RSM was refusing to provide security for costs the Award was issued by
the Tribunal discontinuing the proceedings with prejudice. RSM argues that both the
suspension of the proceedings and their discontinuance were a manifest excess of power by

the Tribunal.

The Committee observes that in its Vacatur Decision the Tribunal had noted that the
question of sanctions for non-compliance with an order for provisional measures was not

dealt with expressly in the ICSID Convention or its Rules.'“ The Tribunal also noted that

64 Vacatur Decision, para. 40.

38

187.

188.

189.

165

in its Decision on Security for Costs it had stated that the Decision was binding although
not in the sense that it was enforceable.'® The Security for Costs Decision, it said, was
predicated on the claims not proceeding until security for costs was provided.'® On that
basis, acting pursuant to Article 44, second sentence, of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal
suspended the proceedings for six months. The rationale of the Tribunal for doing this was
the unfairness for the Respondent of having to participate in proceedings where there was a

real likelihood that it would be unable to recover any costs awarded to it.

The Committee does not consider that reliance on Article 44, second sentence, as the basis
for the suspension of the proceedings constitutes a manifest excess of power. That sentence

provides:

If any question of procedure arises which is not covered by this
Section or the Arbitration Rules or any rules agreed by the parties,
the Tribunal shall decide the question.

The Parties have debated whether the words “any question of procedure” include the issue
of sanctioning for non-compliance with an order for provisional measures. The Committee
has already pointed out that an order for provisional measures has consequences, even
though such consequences have not been set out in the Convention or the Rules. Control
over the arbitral proceedings is in the hands of a tribunal, which in accordance with Article
41, can determine its own competence and in accordance with Article 44 can decide any
question of procedure that may arise that is not already regulated by the Convention, the
Rules, or the agreement of the parties. Control over the arbitral proceedings, in the view of
the Committee, includes control, in accordance with the Convention and the Rules, over
whether the proceedings should be suspended. Such a question is a procedural matter
concerning the proper conduct of the proceedings that falls, in accordance with Article 44,

second sentence, within the power of a tribunal.

In the Vacatur Decision, the Tribunal had decided that the proceedings should not be

continued until security for costs had been provided. That decision was clearly within the

Security for Costs Decision, paras. 49-50.

466 Vacatur Decision, para. 55.

39

190.

191.

193.

194.

competence of the Tribunal. The question is whether the decision to go beyond staying the
proceedings and discontinue the proceedings was also a matter of procedure within the

meaning of Article 44, second sentence.

In the view of the Tribunal, a decision to discontinue the proceedings when there is not
going to be compliance with an order for costs is a logical consequence of the decision to
suspend. When the condition for lifting suspension will never be met, there is no alternative
but to terminate the proceedings. If the right to suspend for failing to provide security for
costs is a valid exercise of the power of a tribunal, as the Committee has found, so too
discontinuance in the event of failure to provide security for costs must be a valid exercise

of that tribunal’s power.

Tf a tribunal were unable to discontinue proceedings that had been suspended for refusal to
provide security for costs, the case would remain in suspension without any prospect of the
suspension ever being lifted. Such a result that keeps the parties in limbo indefinitely hardly
comports with the function of a tribunal to manage proceedings in a way that provides
fairness to both parties. In such circumstances, discontinuance of the proceedings becomes
inevitable. The logic of this is clearly recognized in the proposed revisions to ICSID’s

Arbitration Rules.”

Accordingly, the Committee sees no manifest excess of power by the Tribunal in deciding

to discontinue the proceedings as a result of RSM’s refusal to provide security for costs.

However, the Tribunal did more than discontinuing the proceedings before it. It dismissed
the claims with prejudice. This was not just a discontinuation of the proceedings before the
Tribunal because of a failure to provide security for costs. It was effectively a dismissal of
the case on the merits, thereby preventing RSM from recommencing proceedings on its

claims in the future should it be in a position to provide security for costs.

The treatment of this issue in the Award of the Tribunal is not entirely clear. In the body of

the Award, the Tribunal states that it intends to dismiss the proceedings with prejudice.

Arbitration Rule 51(5).

197.

198.

Chapter II of the Award is headed “Dismissal with prejudice” and in paragraph 108 of the
Award it is said “the Tribunal unanimously dismisses the case with prejudice” and this is
restated in paragraph 138. Notwithstanding these affirmations of the intention of the
Tribunal, the formal decision of the Tribunal states, “[a]ll Claimant’s [RSM’s] prayers for

relief are dismissed” and no mention is made of the dismissal being with prejudice.

Although the formal decision or award of a tribunal in its dispositif is normally taken as the
only part that is binding, in fact both Parties have treated the Tribunal’s decision as a

dismissal with prejudice. Thus, the Committee will treat it as such as well.

In the view of the Committee, while the decision to discontinue the proceedings for failure
to provide security for costs is a procedural matter, and within the power of a tribunal under
Article 44, second sentence, a decision to dismiss the claims with prejudice takes on a
different character. Such a decision prevents the claim from being reintroduced at a later
stage, even though no decision on the substance of the issues claimed has been made.
Dismissing a claim with prejudice is the same as concluding that the claim has no merit.

This cannot be just a matter of procedure.

The Committee recognizes what the Tribunal was trying to achieve. It was concerned that
unless St. Lucia had some security for its costs then it ran the risk of never being able to
recover its costs in the event that it was successful. And given RSM’s track record, this
appeared to be a real likelihood. Unless the proceedings were dismissed that risk would

continue to hang over St. Lucia.

While the Committee has some sympathy with the Tribunal’s concerns, although as will be
pointed out below they may not be as great as perceived, the Committee does not see any
basis for a power in the Tribunal to dismiss the case with prejudice. This is not just a
procedural matter affecting this case; it is a substantive matter affecting the merits of the
case and the rights of RSM to pursue its claims. It is not just about preventing a claimant
from continuing proceedings in which it has failed to provide security for costs. It is about
ending the case on its merits. Such a power cannot derive from Article 44, second sentence,
nor is there any other basis in the ICSID Convention for a tribunal to dismiss a case on the

merits without having heard arguments on the merits. In this regard, the Committee

41

199.

200.

201.

observes that while the Secretariat’s proposed amendments to the ICSID Arbitration Rules
provide for discontinuance of proceedings for failing to comply with an order for security
of costs, it makes no provision for discontinuance “with prejudice.” Dismissal of a claim
with res judicata prevents a party, irrespective of its future financial situation and
willingness to satisfy any order for costs, from ever being able to submit that claim for

determination by any tribunal, so creating a risk of denial of justice.

In the Committee’s view, there is no reason why a claimant that has had proceedings
dismissed for failing to provide security for costs should not, after paying the costs
associated with those proceedings and properly providing security for costs in new
proceedings, have its claims on the merits considered by another tribunal. This would
provide fairness for a claimant by preserving the opportunity for the merits of its case to be
heard, while ensuring that by ordering security for costs a respondent is protected. In other
words, the concerns that led the Tribunal to dismiss the case with prejudice could have been
dealt with in other ways rather than by a draconian dismissal of the merits of the case

without those merits being heard.

In the result, the Committee concludes that while the Tribunal was not manifestly exceeding
its powers by discontinuing the proceedings, it was manifestly exceeding its powers by
dismissing the claims “with prejudice.” Accordingly, the Award has to be partially annulled
to preserve the discontinuation of proceedings dealing with RSM’s prayers for relief but to
abrogate the stipulation that such decision entails the dismissal of RSM’s claims “with

prejudice.”

As the Committee has noted, the Tribunal did not use the term “with prejudice” in the
dispositif of the award. However, it used the term “dismiss” which could imply, based on
the reasons provided earlier in the Award (Chapter II Dismissal with prejudice; paragraph
108; the heading 2 Dismissal with prejudice; and, paragraphs 126 to 138), that the term

dismissal in the dispositif meant dismissal with prejudice. To the extent that it does the

42

dispositif manifestly exceeds the Tribunal’s power and paragraph 184(i) of the Award must

be partially annulled.'©*

COSTS

Pursuant to ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e), the party applying for
annulment, in this case RSM, is solely responsible for making advance payments to the
Centre without prejudice to the Committee’s eventual decision as to how and by whom the

expenses incurred in the annulment proceeding are to be borne.

By letter of January 4, 2017, ICSID requested a first advance payment of USD 175,000
from RSM. ICSID confirmed receipt of the first advance on April 10, 2017.

By letter of January 16, 2018, ICSID requested a second advance payment of
USD 125,000. ICSID confirmed receipt of the second advance by letter of February 16,
2018.

By letter of September 18, 2018, ICSID requested a third advance payment of
USD 300,000. By letter of September 26, 2018, ICSID confirmed receipt of the requested

advance.

RSM’s Cost SUBMISSIONS

In its Reply, RSM requested an award on costs. If its application is successful, it requested
that St. Lucia be ordered to pay RSM’s legal fees and expenses and ordered it to refund
RSM for half of the ICSID and the Committee’s costs.

If the application is unsuccessful, RSM accepts to pay all its legal fees and expenses, and
asks each party be ordered to bear the costs of its own legal fees and expenses and that St.
Lucia be ordered it to refund RSM for half of the ICSID and the Committee’s costs in light

of the novelty and complexity of the case.

‘68 The annulment power of Article 52(2) of the ICSID Convention has been treated as including the power of an ad

In its submission on costs of March 22, 2019, RSM indicated that its fees and expenses
amounted to GBP 881,903.11 and to GBP 1,357,799.92 with the payments made to the

Centre.

St. LuctA’s Cost SUBMISSIONS

St. Lucia requests that RSM bear St. Lucia’s costs and legal fees in full and applies the

“costs follow the event” principle.’

In its submission on costs of March 22, 2019, St. Lucia indicated that its fees and expenses

amounted to a grand total of USD 1,028,226.41.

In its submissions on costs of April 5, 2019, St. Lucia indicated that its fees and expenses
were reasonable and reiterated its request that the Committee order RSM to bear all the

costs and expenses of the proceeding, including St. Lucia’s fees and expenses.

THE AD HOCCOMMITTEE’S DECISION ON COSTS

RSM was successful in partially annulling the Award of the Tribunal but was unsuccessful
in challenging the composition of the Tribunal on the basis of the alleged lack of impartiality
of Dr. Griffith or the order of provisional measures for security for costs and discontinuance

of the proceedings.

Although RSM was thus partially successful in its application for annulment, it was not
successful on the major claim to annul the Award. In these circumstances the Tribunal
considers that the costs of the annulment proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the
ad hoc Committee, and ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses, should be borne
in more substantial part by RSM. Accordingly, the Committee decides to divide those costs

between the Parties on the basis of one third to be paid by St. Lucia and two-thirds by RSM.

For the same reasons, the Tribunal decides that that RSM shall bear its own legal costs and

expenses and one third of the legal costs and expenses of St. Lucia.

VI. DECISION
215. For the reasons set forth above, the ad hoc Committee decides as follows:

(1) The Tribunal’s Award is partially annulled to the extent that it concludes in Paragraph

184(i) that RSM’s prayers for relief are dismissed with prejudice.

(2) The costs covering the ad hoc Committee Members’ fees and expenses, the ICSID
administrative fees and other direct expenses, as determined by the ICSID
Secretariat, shall be borne on the basis of one third to be paid by St. Lucia and two-

thirds by RSM.

(3) RSM shall bear its own legal costs and expenses and one third of the legal costs and

expenses of St. Lucia.
