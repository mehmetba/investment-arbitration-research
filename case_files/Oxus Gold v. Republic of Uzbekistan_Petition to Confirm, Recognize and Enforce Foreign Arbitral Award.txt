COMPLAINT / PETITION TO CONFIRM, RECOGNIZE,
AND ENFORCE FOREIGN ARBITRAL AWARD

1. Petitioner Gretton Limited (“Gretton’”), as assignee of Oxus Gold ple (“Oxus
Gold”), by its undersigned attorneys, hereby petitions this Court pursuant to Section 207 of the
Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. § 207, and the Convention on the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of June 10, 1958 (the “New York Convention”) for an
Order: (a) confirming, recognizing, and enforcing the final award (the “Award”) rendered by a
validly constituted arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) on 17 December 2015, in an arbitration (the
“Arbitration”) commenced by Oxus Gold against The Republic of Uzbekistan (“Uzbekistan”);
(b) entering judgment in Gretton’s favor against Uzbekistan for $13,026,908.12 (the “Award
Amount”), plus prejudgment interest accruing from the date of the Award until the date of entry
of judgment, plus post-judgment interest, plus the costs of this proceeding; and (c) awarding

Gretton such other and further relief as this Court may find just and proper.

Case 1:18-cv-01755 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 2 of 8

2. The Award is subject to the New York Convention because the place of
arbitration was in Paris, France, and both France and the United States are signatories to the New
York Convention. Article III of the New York Convention provides that each contracting state
“shall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce them in accordance with the rules of the
procedure of the territory where the award is relied upon ....”

3. In support of the Petition, Gretton also filed simultaneously herewith a Statement
of Points and Authorities, dated July 27, 2018; a Declaration of Matthew Horton, executed July
26, 2018 (“Horton Declaration”); a Declaration of Dr. Hamid Gharavi, executed July 11, 2018
(“Gharavi Declaration”); and a Declaration of Kevin N. Ainsworth, executed July 27, 2018
(“Ainsworth Declaration”).

4. A duly certified copy of the Award is attached as to the Gharavi Declaration as
Gretton Exhibit 1.

5. A duly certified copy of the agreement pursuant to which Oxus Gold and
Uzbekistan arbitrated their dispute is attached to the Gharavi Declaration as Gretton Exhibit 2.

THE PARTIES

6. Gretton is a company organized in Guernsey with number 53724 and has its
registered office at First Floor, Dorey Court, Admiral Park, St Peter Port, Guernsey, GY1 6HJ.
Gretton asserts its rights herein as assignee from Oxus Gold, which was the claimant in the
Arbitration, and which was a company registered in England and Wales and having its registered
office at 52 Charles Street, London W1J 5EU, with company registration number 04056219.
Pursuant to a Mortgage Over Proceeds, dated June 26, 2012 (“Mortgage”), Oxus Gold has

assigned to Gretton all right, title, and interest in “Proceeds” (as that term is used in the

Case 1:18-cv-01755 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 3 of 8

Mortgage), which includes the rights to enforce the Award and to collect from Uzbekistan all
amounts owed under the Award. (See Horton Decl. {4-6 and Gretton Exh. 5.)

7. Uzbekistan is a foreign state for purposes of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities

Act, 28 U.S.C. §1603 (“FSIA”). Uzbekistan was a respondent in the Arbitration.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE

8. This Court has original jurisdiction over this action under 9 U.S.C. §§ 203 and
207, because this is a civil action seeking recognition and enforcement of an award rendered in
an arbitration subject to the New York Convention. The Award is governed by the laws
implementing the New York Convention because it arises out of a legal relationship that is
commercial and because it is not entirely between citizens of the United States. 9 U.S.C. § 202.

9. Original jurisdiction also exists under 28 U.S.C. §1330(a) because Uzbekistan is a
foreign state as defined in Section 1603(a) of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976
(“FSIA”), and is not entitled to immunity. 28 U.S.C. §1603(a).

10. Uzbekistan is not entitled to sovereign immunity because immunity under the
FSIA does not extend to proceedings to confirm arbitration awards that are subject to the New
York Convention. See 28 U.S.C. §1605(a)(6).

11. Because Gretton seeks enforcement of a foreign arbitral Award made in Paris,
France, this Court sits in its secondary jurisdiction with regard to the Award. See CBF Industria
de Gusa S/A v. AMCI Holdings, Inc., 846 F.3d 35, 48, 52 (2d. Cir. 2017).

12. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Uzbekistan pursuant to 28 U.S.C.
§1330(b), which provides that personal jurisdiction exists over a foreign state in an action in

which the foreign state is not entitled to sovereign immunity under 28 U.S.C. §§1605-1607,

Case 1:18-cv-01755 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 4 of 8

where service has been made under 28 U.S.C. §1608. Service of process will be effected
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1608.

13. Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391(f)(4) because
Uzbekistan is a foreign state.

THE ARBITRATION

14. Oxus Gold commenced the Arbitration asserting claims for breach of the
Agreement for the Promotion and Protection of Investments, concluded on 24 November 1993,
by the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the
Government of the Republic of Uzbekistan (the “Bilateral Investment Treaty” or “BIT”). (Award
9123.)

15. Article 8 of the BIT provides, in part: “Disputes between a national or company
of one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party concerning an obligation of the latter
under this Agreement in relation to an investment of the former which have not been amicably
settled shall, after a period of three months from written notification to a claim, be submitted to
international arbitration if the national or company concerned so wishes.” (Gretton Exh. 2
(attached to Gharavi Decl.).)

16. The BIT is an agreement to arbitrate, within the meaning of the FSIA. See, e.g.,
Chevron Corp. v. Republic of Ecuador, 795 F.3d 200, 207 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Crystallex Int'l
Corp. v. Bolivarian Republic of Venez., 244 F. Supp.3d 100, 109 (D. D.C. 2017).

17. On August 31, 2011, Oxus Gold commenced the Arbitration pursuant to Article 8
of the BIT, by filing a notice of arbitration against Uzbekistan, alleging breaches of the BIT. The
notice named additional respondents, but Oxus Gold later withdrew its claims against the other

respondents and pursued claims against only Uzbekistan.

Case 1:18-cv-01755 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 5of8

18. On September 30, 2011, Uzbekistan filed its Response to the Notice of
Arbitration.
19. The Tribunal determined that it had jurisdiction over the dispute.
20. The place of arbitration was Paris, France. A hearing was held there from April 28
to May 3, 2014.
21. The Arbitration proceeded under the United Nations Commission on International
Trade Law Arbitration Rules (2010 version) (the “UNCITRAL Rules”).
22. The language of the Arbitration was English.
THE AWARD
23. On 17 December 2015, the Tribunal issued a Final Award, which is written in
English and spans 397 pages.
24. The Award provides, in relevant part, as follows:
1. Respondent’s [(i.e., Uzbekistan’s)] jurisdictional and
admissibility objections towards Claimant’s AGF  [(i.e.,
Amantaytau Goldfields AO)] claims are unfounded and hereby
rejected. Claimant’s AGF claims are admissible and the Tribunal
has jurisdiction thereover.
2. Respondent [(i.e., Uzbekistan)] is liable for a breach of
Article 2(2) of the BIT in connection with the tax regime changes
implemented in 2006 and in 2009.
3. Respondent [(i.e., Uzbekistan)] owes an amount of USD
10,299,572 for the damage caused by Respondent’s violation of
Article 2(2) of the BIT with regard to the tax law changes of 2006
and 2009.
4. Respondent [(i.e., Uzbekistan)] shall pay an interest of
LIBOR + 2% to be compounded annually on the amount
mentioned above. The interest rate shall be applied to the loss
suffered by Claimant as of the 31 December of each corresponding

year from 2004 to 2010.

5. The Arbitral Tribunal finds that it lacks jurisdiction over
Respondent’s counter-claims.

Case 1:18-cv-01755 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 6 of 8

(Award at 397.)

25. In determining the amount of interest included in the Award, the Award provides:
“The Parties shall calculate each yearly loss on the basis of the numbers provided by Mr. Hart in
ER-Hart III (10.07.2014).” A copy of that report of Mr. Hart is attached to the Gharavi
Declaration as Gretton Exhibit 4.

26. The amount of interest included in the Award on 17 December 2015 was
$2,727,336.12.

27. Accordingly, the Award amount (including damages and interest) at the date it
was made, i.e., 17 December 2015, was $13,026,908.12 (the “Award Amount”).

28. Article 34 of the UNCITRAL Rules provides: “All awards shall be made in
writing and shall be final and binding on the parties. The parties shall carry out all awards
without delay.”

29. Uzbekistan has failed to pay any of the amount owed. (See Horton Decl. 2.)

30. Gretton also is entitled to prejudgment interest at the average daily prime rate,
accruing from the date of the Award through the date of judgment.

31. Gretton also is entitled to post-judgment interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1961(a).

THE LEGAL STANDARD
32. Section 207 of Title 9, U.S. Code, provides: “Within three years after an arbitral
award falling under the Convention is made, any party to the arbitration may apply to any court
having jurisdiction under this chapter for an order confirming the award as against any other
party to the arbitration. The court shall confirm the award unless it finds one of the grounds for

refusal or deferral of recognition or enforcement of the award specified in the said Convention.”

Case 1:18-cv-01755 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 7 of 8

33. The term “confirm” as used in Section 207 of Title 9 refers to the process by
which a District Court acts under its secondary jurisdiction to recognize and enforce a foreign

arbitral award. See CBF Industria, 846 F.3d at 52.

34, Gretton has filed this Petition within three years after the Award was made on 17
December 2015.
35. The burden of proving grounds for refusal or deferral of recognition or

enforcement of the Award rests on with the party resisting confirmation. See, e.g., Balkan
Energy Ltd. v. Republic of Ghana, No. 17-cv-00584 (APM), 2018 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 47134 at *
29 (D. D.C. Mar. 22, 2018); BCB Holdings Ltd. v. Gov’t of Belize, 110 F. Supp. 3d 233, 247 (D.
D.C. 2015); CBF Industria, 846 F.3d at 53.

36. Confirmation proceedings under the Convention are summary in nature, and the
court must grant the confirmation unless it finds that the arbitration suffers from one of the
defects listed in the New York Convention. See, e.g., BCB Holdings Ltd., 110 F. Supp. 3d at 247.

37. None of the New York Convention grounds for denying recognition and

enforcement of an award have been proven by Uzbekistan.
