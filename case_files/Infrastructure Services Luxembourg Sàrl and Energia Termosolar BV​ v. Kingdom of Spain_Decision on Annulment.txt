Case 1:18-cv-01753-EGS Document 46-1 Filed 08/04/21 Page 9 of 68

The Award decided a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) under the Energy Charter Treaty
(“ECT” or the “Treaty”) which entered into force with respect to Spain, Luxembourg
and the Netherlands on 16 April 1998, and the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into

force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The dispute in the original proceeding related to measures undertaken by Spain in the
renewable energy sector and the alleged breaches of its obligations under the ECT and

international law with respect to the Claimants and their investments.

In the Award, the Tribunal decided that (i) it had jurisdiction under the ECT and the
ICSID Convention over most of the Claimants’ claims; (ii) Spain breached the fair and
equitable treatment standard in Article 10(1) of the ECT; and (iii) Spain was liable to

pay the Claimants €112 million, with interest, as compensation.

Spain applied for annulment of the Award on the basis of Article 52(1) of the ICSID
Convention, identifying three grounds for annulment: (i) manifest excess of powers
(Article 52(1)(b)); (ii) serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure (Article
52(1)(d)); and (iii) failure to state reasons (Article 52(1)(e)).

On 3 September 2020, the Parties submitted their comments on their counterpart’s

observations on the EC’s Second Application to Intervene as a Non-disputing Party.

On 5 September 2020, the Committee issued Procedural Order No. 4 granting the
Claimants’ request to file with their Rejoinder on Annulment an expert report
responding to Prof. Gosalbo’s expert reports dated 29 January 2020 and 1 July 2020,
and permitting Spain to file an expert report responding to the Claimants’ expert

evidence.

On 9 September 2020, the Claimants filed their Rejoinder on Annulment, along with
Annexes A and B, the Expert Opinion of Prof. Piet Eeckhout, and Legal Authorities
CL-0275 through CL-0281 (the “Rejoinder on Annulment”).

On 16 September 2020, Spain transmitted to the Committee a letter from Prof. Gosalbo
(dated 15 September 2020) concerning the Claimants’ Rejoinder on Annulment and its

Annex A.

On 28 September 2020, the Claimants informed the Committee of the Parties’
agreement to hold the hearing on annulment virtually in light of the COVID-19

restrictions in place in Europe. Spain confirmed its agreement on the same date.

On 29 September 2020, Spain submitted Prof. Gosalbo’s Rebuttal Report to Prof.
Eeckout’s Expert Opinion (dated 28 September 2020).

On 30 September 2020, the Committee (i) suggested timings for the hearing on
annulment; (ii) invited the Parties to indicate whether those timings were suitable; and
(iii) invited the Parties to confer and seek to agree the terms of a virtual hearing protocol

and a hearing schedule by 14 October 2020.

On 2 October 2020, the Claimants requested that the Committee direct Spain to
resubmit Prof. Gosalbo’s Rebuttal Report to Prof. Eeckhout’s Expert Opinion without
paragraphs 69 to 84, which, according to the Claimants, “plainly [were] not responsive

to the Eeckhout Report’.

On 6 October 2020, the Committee invited Spain to respond to the Claimants’
communication of 2 October 2020, by 13 October 2020.

particular, Spain submitted that the Committee “should be able to assess the complete
drafting history of the ECT and not the four versions submitted by the Claimants... [to]
be presented with the complete negotiation process that led to the final approval of the

ECT”.

GROUND 1: MANIFEST EXCESS OF POWERS BY THE TRIBUNAL

Spain’s Position

According to Spain, the Award must be annulled under Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID
Convention as the Tribunal “manifestly exceeded its power” by (i) deciding that it had
the jurisdiction to decide an intra-EU dispute under the ECT between an EU Member
State and investors from another EU Member State; and (ii) awarding to the Claimants

damages for measures that the Tribunal itself declared were not contrary to the ECT.®

(ji Applicable standard for manifest excess of powers

Spain submits that a manifest excess of power exists “when the Tribunal does not apply
the appropriate law or when the Tribunal exceeds its jurisdiction or lacks jurisdiction,
or when the Tribunal rules on matters not raised by the Parties”.” An arbitral tribunal
in turn fails to apply the appropriate law where it either “ignores [the] applicable law”
or mistakenly applies it in a manner “so gross or egregious as substantially to amount
to failure to apply the proper law”.* Even if an arbitral tribunal correctly declares the
applicable law, a manifest excess of powers may exist if the tribunal failed to effectively

apply the principles as acknowledged. As stated in Jberdrola v. Guatemala, “a mistake

in the application of the law may reach such a level of severity that it would be

equivalent to amount to failure to apply the proper law”?

Spain disagrees with the Claimants’ submission that a ‘manifest excess of power’ under
Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention must be “clear”, “obvious” or “self-
evident”.'° In this regard, Spain relies on inter alia the annulment committee’s
observation in Occidental Petroleum v. Ecuador that the term ‘manifest’ in Article
52(1)(b) “does not prevent that in some cases an extensive argumentation and analysis

may be required to prove that the misuse of powers has in fact occurred” ."'

(ii) Whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction
over the Parties’ intra-EU dispute

Spain argues that the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction
over the Parties’ dispute under the ECT. According to Spain, Articles 267 and 344 of
the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (“TFEU”) “forbid any disputes on subjects
regulated by EU Law not to be reviewed by the CJEU”,' and such disputes therefore
cannot be submitted to arbitration. This is pursuant to the principle of autonomy in the
EU legal system which requires disputes concerning the interpretation of EU law be

submitted to the EU’s legal system, and not international arbitration. '*

Spain argues that the Parties’ dispute is governed by EU law pursuant to the principle
of primacy, which gives EU law preference in the case of any conflict between the rules
of a Member State and EU law. Spain also reiterated its position in the Arbitration that
“EU law, including the treaties creating the European Economic Community (‘EEC’)
and the EU and allocating competences among European institutions and their member
countries, EU’s internal legislation, and decisions of the CJEU constitute ‘applicable

rules and principles of international law’ for purposes of Article 26(6) [of the ECT]”. '*

Spain then argues that a dispute concerning the application of EU law cannot be validly
submitted to arbitration. Spain relies in particular on the 2018 judgment of the Court of
Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) in Achmea.'* In Achmea, the CJEU decided
a dispute between the Dutch insurer Achmea BV and Slovakia brought under the 1991
Netherlands-Slovakia bilateral investment treaty (“BIT”). Prior to the CJEU
proceedings, Achmea had commenced arbitration against Slovakia under the BIT and
obtained an award of damages against Slovakia. The CJEU set aside the award, holding
that the arbitration clause in the Netherlands-Slovakia BIT was incompatible with the
principle of autonomy under EU law as the clause provided for disputes involving the

interpretation of EU law to be determined by bodies outside the EU’s judicial system. '°

Applying Achmea, Spain argues that Article 26(6) of the ECT, which provides for
disputes to be referred to investment treaty arbitration, cannot be applied to its dispute
with the Claimants, being an intra-EU dispute involving the application of EU law.!”
Spain finds support in the European Commission’s Communication COM(2018) 547/2,
which states that Article 26 of the ECT, read in light of Achmea, “does not provide for
an investor-State arbitration clause applicable between investors from a Member States
of the EU and another Member States of the EU” and that “the reasoning of the Court
in Achmea applies equally to the intra-EU application of such a clause which, just like
the clauses of intra-EU BITs, opens the possibility of submitting those disputes to a

body which is not part of the judicial system of the EU”.'®

According to Spain, the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers in failing to correctly
identify EU law as the law applicable to the Parties’ dispute and to provide adequate
reasons for its refusal to accept Spain’s arguments on this issue.'? The Tribunal’s
Award, Spain submits, leaves unanswered the “crucial question” of how it could be
possible that “the EU and all its Member States, which promoted the ECT to foster

international relations with third states and not among themselves, obliged themselves

to submit intra-EU disputes to arbitration, in open contradiction to EU law which binds

them under the principle of primacy” ”°

(iii) | Whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by compensating the
Claimants for measures that were not contrary to the ECT

Spain contends that the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction by ordering damages in

respect of measures that were found not to be in breach of the ECT.

First, Spain argues that the Tribunal awarded damages as if “all the disputed measures
were contrary to the ECT and gave rise to liability... despite the fact that it was
determined by the tribunal itself that (i) Spain had the right to regulate; (ii) the Tribunal
lacked jurisdiction over the 7% tax on the value of energy production that was approved
by Law 15/2012; and (iii) Spain had not breached its obligation of Fair and Equitable
Treatment with regard to Law 15/2012... and RDL 2/2013”.?'

In its Award, the Tribunal accounted for the measures that it found to be lawful by
refusing to award damages for the Claimants’ “historic losses’”.** However, Spain
submits that the Tribunal’s calculation of the Claimants’ future losses also awards
damages for “measures which [the Tribunal] has declared to be lawful or beyond its
jurisdiction”.?> According to Spain, the Tribunal should have, but did not, make the
necessary adjustments to the model submitted by the Brattle Group (“Brattle Model”)
in order to account for their findings that some of Spain’s measures were lawful.** Had
these adjustments been made, Spain contends that the Claimants’ loss of future cash
flow, based on the Brattle Model, would have been €10 million, and not €101 million

as awarded by the Tribunal.

Secondly, Spain also contends that the Tribunal awarded damages in accordance with
a valuation model that assumed a 40-year useful life for the plants, despite having found

that the plants would have a useful life of only 25 years.”° The Tribunal manifestly

exceeded its powers, Spain argues, by awarding damages that go beyond those justified

by its factual findings.

The Claimants’ Position

(i) Applicable standard for manifest excess of powers

The Claimants argue that for an excess of powers to be “manifest”, such excess must
be “clear”, “obvious”, “self-evident” and discernible “without need for an extensive
analysis of the award”.*' A finding of excess of powers that requires in-depth analysis
of the award or the underlying evidence before the tribunal cannot be considered
‘manifest’, and cannot result in the annulment of the award. This is in line with the
well-established view that annulment committees do not sit as appeal courts under the
ICSID Convention but are rather meant to play a limited role in ensuring the integrity

of the process in accordance with ICSID Convention standards.?*

According to the Claimants, the limited standard of review available under the ICSID
Convention means that annulment committees do not have the power to reassess
tribunals’ competence de novo.”° As stated by Azurix v. Argentina, annulment is only
available where it is “obvious, without deeper analysis, that a tribunal lacked or
exceeded jurisdiction’’. In cases where “reasonable minds might differ as to whether or
not the tribunal has jurisdiction’’, then it “falls to be resolved definitively by the tribunal

in exercise of its power”.*°

(ii) Whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction
over the Parties’ intra-EU dispute

The Claimants disagree that the Parties’ dispute is governed by EU law or that the
arbitration agreement in Article 26(1) of the ECT does not apply to intra-EU disputes.
According to the Claimants, the Tribunal correctly found that public international law,

not EU law, applies “as the correct starting point for interpreting a treaty”?!

138. Under international law, Article 26 of the ECT is to be interpreted “in accordance with
the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the
light of its object and purpose”.*? Applying this approach, the Tribunal found that the
ordinary meaning of the ECT “demonstrates Spain’s unconditional consent to arbitrate
disputes with investors from Luxembourg and the Netherlands” and “provide[s] the
Tribunal with jurisdiction to entertain claims against Spain (a Contracting Party) by
investors of Luxembourg and the Netherlands (both a Contracting Party) related to
“Investments” made by the Claimants in the Spanish RE sector”.*> The Claimants
hence argue that the Tribunal was correct in rejecting Spain’s intra-EU argument and

finding that EU law did not govern the interpretation of Article 26 of the ECT.

139. The Claimants also contend that Spain’s reliance on Article 26(6) of the ECT is
misplaced. While Spain argues that EU law constitutes the “applicable rules and
principles of international law” referred to in Article 26(6),** the Claimants note that
Article 26(6) only applies to the merits of the case and is therefore “irrelevant to the
question of jurisdiction” .** The Claimants hence argue that the Tribunal was reasonable
in finding that Article 26(6) of the ECT does not require the application of EU law to

the issue of jurisdiction.*°

140. As for the CJEU’s decision in Achmea, the Claimants submit that Achmea has no
relevance to the ECT. This is because (i) EU law (including Achmea) is not relevant to
the question of jurisdiction; (ii) even if EU law were relevant, Achmea cannot
retroactively invalidate Spain’s consent to arbitrate given that the Claimants’ initiated
arbitration proceedings in 2013, almost five years before the Achmea decision was

rendered; and (iii) even if Achmea could have retroactive effect, it remains irrelevant to

the Arbitration because the judgment does not apply to the ECT, but only to the BIT at

issue in that particular case.*”

Finally, the Claimants argue that even assuming that the Tribunal had exceeded its
powers with respect to jurisdiction, Spain has not shown that the excess of powers was
manifest.** According to the Claimants, an excess of powers that is manifest should be
clearly discernible from the award itself and should not require meticulous examination
on the part of the committee — this is not the case here given that Spain is asking the
Committee to conduct a detailed analysis into a number of EU law decisions and
opinions, the majority of which were never brought to the attention of the Tribunal.*?
Moreover, a significant number of ECT and non-ECT tribunals have rejected the intra-
EU jurisdictional argument relied on by Spain, showing that the Tribunal was not acting

alone or unreasonably in doing the same.*?

(iii) | Whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by compensating the
Claimants for measures that were not contrary to the ECT

The Claimants argue that the Tribunal had “appropriately calculated damages in light
of its factual and legal findings’, and had adjusted the damages awarded “to account
for its finding that some of Disputed Measures did not breach the ECT and its finding

regarding the lifetime of the plant”.*!

First, the Claimants point out that the Tribunal expressly refused to award damages for
“historic losses” arising from measures adopted by Spain that were not in violation of
the ECT.” The Tribunal deducted the value of such historic losses from the valuation
model provided by the Claimants’ damages expert, the Brattle Group (“Brattle”), and
therefore calibrated the damages awarded to only account for the Claimants’ loss of

future cash flows.

Secondly, although the Tribunal initially made a clerical error in adopting the wrong

figure as the value of the Claimants’ lost future cash flows, this has been subsequently

rectified by the Tribunal, who reduced the damages awarded by €11 million to account

for the error.4

Thirdly, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal had properly accounted for its finding
that the Claimants’ plants had an operational life of 25 years, and not 35 to 40 years as
submitted by the Claimants in their damages model. In its Award, the Tribunal deducted
€36 million from the lost future cash flows modelled by the Claimants to arrive at its
final damages figure.*° The Claimants explained that, rather than adopting Brattle’s
calculations wholesale, the Tribunal had made its own estimate of the appropriate

deduction based on the estimates put forward by Brattle.*°

Fourthly, the Claimants argue that even if Spain’s criticisms of the Tribunal’s
methodology are valid, they nonetheless cannot serve as grounds for annulment. This
is because, the Claimants submit, annulment committees “cannot review de novo the
facts, evidence and criteria used by the tribunal in assessing the damages nor the
amount of compensation awarded to [the claimants]”.*’ Spain’s case, at its highest, is
that the Tribunal made the wrong deductions — but mistakes by a tribunal are not

grounds for annulment.**

For the above reasons, the Claimants deny that the Tribunal exceeded its powers in
awarding damages. They contend that Spain’s complaint is really that the Tribunal got
it wrong, and that the Tribunal should have made different deductions (that were never

proposed by Spain to the Tribunal).*?

The Committee’s Analysis

Article 52(1)(b) of the ICSID Convention provides for annulment only where (i) the

tribunal has exceeded its powers; and (ii) the excess is ‘manifest’. This is a dual

requirement that “necessarily limits an ad hoc Committee's freedom of appreciation as

to whether the tribunal has exceeded its powers”.°

(i) Applicable standard for manifest excess of powers

149. On the applicable standard of review, the Committee agrees with the Claimants that the

term ‘manifest’ refers to an excess that is “obvious”, “clear” or “self-evident”. This

definition of ‘manifest’ is, as stated in the 2016 Background Paper on Annulment for
the Administrative Council, one adopted by “most ad hoc Committees”.*' For example,

the annulment committee in CDC v. Seychelles held that:

“[T]he excess must be plain on its face for annulment to be an
available remedy. Any excess apparent in a Tribunal’s conduct, if
susceptible of argument ‘one way or the other’, is not manifest. As
one commentator has put it, ‘If the issue is debatable or requires
examination of the materials on which the tribunal’s decision is

based, the tribunal’s determination is conclusive’. >?

150. Similarly, the AES v. Hungary committee explained that:

“Concerning the ing of ‘manifest’, the Ce it shares
Professor Schreuer’s view that the term relates to the ease with
which an excess of powers is perceived, rather than its gravity, and
that such an excess must be able to ‘be discerned with little effort
and without deeper analysis.’ Such an approach is consistent with a
manifest excess being one which is at once ‘textually obvious and
substantively serious.’”>?

151. The Committee sees no reason to depart from the well-established approach taken by
the international arbitration community. On the contrary, the Committee finds that the
above definition of ‘manifest’ is in line with the exceptional and limited character of an
annulment as opposed to an appeal. Further, it better accords with the intentions of the
drafters of the ICSID Convention. As Prof Schreuer observes, the term ‘manifest’ in
Article 52(1)(b) was deliberately chosen by the drafters of the ICSID Convention to

promote finality in ICSID arbitration and to minimise the “risk of frustration of

awards” .*4 This objective justifies a higher standard for when an ICSID award may be

annulled on the ground of an excess of power.

For these reasons, the Committee cannot agree with Spain’s submission that there can
be manifest excesses of power that are nevertheless only be discernible upon “extensive
argumentation and analysis”.*> In the Committee’s view, an error that is obvious or
self-evident must necessarily be one that would be readily apparent without a need to

resort to extensive argumentation and analysis to reveal it.

(ii) Whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by assuming jurisdiction
over the Parties’ intra-EU dispute

The next question is whether it is obvious or self-evident that the Tribunal exceeded its
powers in assuming jurisdiction over the Parties’ intra-EU dispute. The Committee

finds that it is not, for the reasons explained below.

The Committee notes that 56 other tribunals have dismissed the intra-EU jurisdictional
argument raised by Spain (of which 35 were considering the intra-EU argument in the
context of the ECT).*° The Committee agrees with the view of the tribunal in InfraRed
yv. Spain that one cannot “overstate the importance of the long record of recent arbitral
awards or partial awards which disposed of the intra-EU jurisdictional objections and
maintained the jurisdiction of the respective ECT tribunals... [as] these form an arbitral
jurisprudence constante which, short of binding this Tribunal, provides nonetheless a
persuasive, reasoned and documented analytical framework that the Tribunal endorses
and adopts without the need to spell it out in detail below.”* In the Committee’s view,
the fact that 56 other tribunals agree with the Tribunal’s views suffices to show that the

Tribunal’s reasoning was tenable and not clearly or self-evidently wrong.

Spain has not shown any international arbitration decisions ruling in support of its intra-
EU objection. Rather, Spain responded to the overwhelming weight of authority against

it by arguing that “there is no rule of precedent in the ICSID system” and that this

Committee therefore “has the autonomy to establish its own view [on] whether Article
26 of the ECT gives jurisdiction to hear intra-European Union disputes”.** The

Committee does not accept this argument for two reasons.

First, while the Committee is not bound by previous decisions, it should nonetheless

“pay due ideration to earlier de

of inte ional tribunals” so as to
“contribute to the harmonious development of investment law and thereby to meet the
legitimate expectations of the community of States and investors towards certainty of
the rule of law”.*? The decisions of previous tribunals on the intra-EU objection are
therefore material in assessing whether the Tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers.
Collectively, these decisions overwhelmingly show that the Tribunal’s decision is, at

the very least, reasonable and defensible.

Secondly, the Committee considers that it does not have an unfettered autonomy to
reconsider the merits of Spain’s intra-EU objection de novo. As discussed at paragraphs
26 to 29 above, the ICSID Convention gives annulment committees a limited form of
review over the underlying tribunal’s exercise of its jurisdictional powers. The
Committee agrees with the annulment committee in Bernhard Von Pezold and Others
v. Republic of Zimbabwe that:°°

“It is also clear from the language of Article 52, and it is well
established in ICSID annulment practice, that annulment is an
extraordinary remedy and not an appeal from the legal or factual
findings of the arbitral tribunal. The object and purpose of
annulment proceedings is not to test the substantive correctness of
the award... The function of an ICSID ad hoc committee is not to
review the factual findings of an ICSID tribunal or its decision on
the merits, but to determine whether any of the annulment grounds
in Article 52 has been established.”

Accordingly, even assuming arguendo that the Committee disagrees with the Tribunal
on the merits of Spain’s intra-EU objection, the Committee cannot disregard the many
prior decisions showing that the Tribunal’s decision was, at the very least, not obviously

or manifestly incorrect. As the requirement of a ‘manifest’ excess is clearly not satisfied,

the Committee sees no reason to scrutinise further the Tribunal’s conclusions on the

intra-EU objection.

Thirdly, the Committee notes that the Tribunal’s decision should be evaluated on the
basis of the arguments and evidence raised before the Tribunal. As the Claimants have
pointed out, Spain relies significantly on documents that post-date the Award (e.g. a
2018 European Commission communication,®! a 2019 declaration by EU Member
States;°? a 2020 opinion by the Advocate-General of the European Court of Justice).
In the Committee’s view, it would not be appropriate to impugn the Tribunal’s Award
on the basis of authorities or documents rendered post-Award. Moreover, the fact that
Spain has to rely on further authorities not before the Tribunal suggests that the

Tribunal’s decision was not obviously or manifestly incorrect.

In the premises, the Committee finds no reason to conclude that the Tribunal manifestly

exceeded its power in assuming jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute.

(iii) | Whether the Tribunal manifestly exceeded its powers by compensating the
Claimants for measures that were not contrary to the ECT

The Committee also does not find that damages awarded by the Tribunal was a manifest

excess of its powers.

The background for the Tribunal’s award of damages is as follows. In the Arbitration,
the Claimants challenged a series of measures taken by Spain that affected the
Claimants’ renewable energy investments (“Disputed Measures”). The first set of
measures (comprising Law 15/2012. RDL 2/2013 and RDL 9/2013, collectively
“Earlier Measures”) initially adopted by Spain was found to have modified Spain’s
original regulatory regime, but did not replace it. The Tribunal found that these set of

measures were not in breach of the ECT.

Case 1:18-cv-01753-EGS Document 46-1 Filed 08/04/21 Page 36 of 68

Subsequently, Spain completely repealed and replaced its original regulatory regime
(“Original Regime’) with a series of further measures (comprising Law 24/2013, RD
413/2014, and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, collectively the “Further Measures”)
comprising a new regulatory regime (“New Regime”). The Tribunal found that the
Further Measures violated the ECT.® In line with this, the Tribunal chose 20 June 2014,
the date on which the Government published Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014, as the

appropriate valuation date for the Claimants’ losses.®

As the Tribunal found that Spain’s first set of measures were lawful, the Tribunal
declined to award to the Claimants any “historical losses” arising prior to June 2014.7
Instead, the Tribunal only granted damages for the Claimants’ loss of cash flows after
June 2014, which were assessed based on the Brattle Model submitted by the Claimants’
experts. The Tribunal’s initial award of €148 million in damages, however, was
erroneous as it included “both historical and future cash flows”.© To rectify this, the
Tribunal subsequently ordered for the Claimants’ damages to be reduced by €11

million.”

Further, in considering the damages payable to the Claimants, the Tribunal also had to
consider the useful life of the Claimants’ plants. In this regard, the Tribunal rejected the
Claimants’ case that the plants had a useful life of 40 years, finding instead that the
useful life of the plants is 25 years.’! To account for this, the Tribunal deducted the sum
of €36 million from the quantum set out in the Brattle Model, which corresponds “to
the difference between the estimate of 35 to 40-year service of the plants, which the
Tribunal considered unsupported, and the 25-year lifetime that the Tribunal considered

acceptable” .””

Spain contends that the Tribunal’s refusal to award damages for historical losses is not
sufficient. According to Spain, the Earlier Measures affected not only the value of the

Claimants’ historical losses, but also that of the Claimants’ future cash flows.” In other

words, if the New Regime was not implemented, Spain would have retained the Earlier
Measures even past June 2014. This would have affected the but-for values of the

Claimants’ future cash flows and should have been taken into account by the Tribunal.

167. Having considered the Parties’ arguments, the Committee finds that the Tribunal has

not obviously or manifestly exceeded its powers.

168. Asa starting point, the Committee is mindful that the annulment procedure under the
ICSID Convention is not an appeal against the Tribunal’s legal and factual findings.”
The Committee hence agrees with the Claimants that it cannot review de novo the facts,
evidence and criteria used by the Tribunal in its award of damages, nor can the
Committee make or substitute its own findings of fact in lieu of the Tribunal’s. On this

point, the decision of the Jmpregilo annulment committee is instructive: ”°

“.. [The annulment committee] cannot review de novo the facts,
evidence and criteria used by the Tribunal in assessing the
damages nor the amount of compensation awarded to Impregilo.
It is clear that Argentina disagrees with the causal connection found
by the Tribunal between the damages and the disputed measures;
that it considers that there was a gap in the analysis of causation
and that the evidence produced should have resulted in a different
compensation; and that it disagrees with the interpretation by the
Tribunal of the applicable law in the assessment of the damages.
However, a disagreement with the analysis of the Tribunal as to
causation, or with respect to the assessment of the evidence or the
interpretation of the law does not constitute ground for annulment
under Article 52.” (emphasis added)

169. In line with the above, the Committee finds that it can only annul the Tribunal’s award
on damages if the Tribunal had made an obvious or manifest error that is discernible
from the face of its Award. The Committee should not make its own findings of fact or
law apart from what is clearly established in the Award. Nor should this Committee re-
evaluate the quantum of damages that should have been awarded by the Tribunal on the

basis of evidence or arguments not before the Tribunal.

170. Turning the Parties’ arguments, the Committee does not see how the Tribunal was
manifestly wrong in calculating the Claimants’ lost future cash flows. In the

Committee’s view, Spain’s argument that the Tribunal should have taken the Earlier

Case 1:18-cv-01753-EGS Document 46-1 Filed 08/04/21 Page 38 of 68

Measures into account hinges on a factual premise never adopted by the Tribunal — that
the Earlier Measures would have continued past June 2014 had the Further Measures
not been put in place. While the Committee acknowledges Spain’s point that the
Tribunal’s Award “does not conclude that the Earlier Measures are temporary”,”° the
Tribunal likewise never found that the Earlier Measures would have continued if the
Further Measures were not adopted. Indeed, this issue does not appear to have been
placed or argued before the Tribunal. In the absence of any finding by the Tribunal on
this issue, the Committee does not consider it appropriate to fill in the gaps with its own
factual findings. As explained above, such fact-finding is not the function of an

annulment committee.

Moreover, the Committee notes that the Tribunal was not specifically asked to adjust
its future cash flow calculations to account for the Earlier Measures, nor were there
submissions on what the appropriate adjustments should have been. Spain submits that
the Tribunal could easily have made the appropriate adjustments by switching various

options in the spreadsheet provided with the Brattle Model.”

The Claimants, on the
other hand, submit that “[t]here were no functional ‘switches’ for the Earlier Measures
in the Brattle Model submitted to the Tribunal and the Brattle Model was built on the
assumption that the Earlier Measures did not extend beyond June 2014”.”* Having
reviewed the Brattle Model,” the Committee finds that it is not obvious or self-evident
that the Brattle Model could be adjusted in the manner suggested by Spain, or that these

adjustments were necessary and appropriate.

In sum, it appears to the Committee that the issues of (i) whether the Brattle Model
should be adjusted to account for the Earlier Measures, and (ii) if so, the nature of the
adjustments to be made; were not raised before the Tribunal. The Tribunal therefore
did not have a chance to rule on these issues, nor is it obvious what the correct ruling
would be. In the circumstances, the Committee does not find that there has been any

manifest excess of power by the Tribunal on these issues.

Next, the Committee also does not find that the Tribunal’s assessment of future losses

based on a 25-year useful life was a manifest excess of power. As a starting point, the

Committee agrees with the Claimants that the Tribunal is entitled to make its own
estimates as to the damages suffered by the Claimants — there is no requirement that the
Tribunal adhere strictly to the expert estimates provided by the Parties.*° As noted by

the committee in Rumeli v. Kazakhstan:*!

“... the tribunal must be satisfied that the claimant has suffered

some damage under the relevant head as a result of the respondent’s

breach. But once it is satisfied of this, the determination of the

precise amount of this damage is a matter for the tribunal’s informed

estimation in the light of all the evidence available to it.”
As explained at paragraph 43 above, the Tribunal deducted €36 million from the
damages payable to the Claimants to account for its finding that the Claimants’ useful
plant life was 25 years. In its Decision on Rectification, the Tribunal explained it had
“in the exercise of its discretion and based on its own calculation of the 25 difference
between the plant with a 35 to 40-year lifetime and a 25-year lifetime arrived at what
the Tribunal considers to be a fair measure of the Claimants' damages” .** The Tribunal
further rejected Spain’s submission that the figure was the result of a typographical or

copy-paste error. 83

Spain argues that the Tribunal wrongly determined its figure of €36 million by
subtracting the Brattle Group’s damages estimate for a useful life of 25 years (€84
million) from its estimate for a useful life of 35 years (€120 million).** This is erroneous
because the Brattle valuation relied on by the Tribunal assumed a useful life of 40 years,
not 35.*° The correct figure, according to Spain, should have been €53 million based
on the Brattle Group’s estimates. *° According to Spain, the Tribunal’s error is a
“glaring excess of powers” *’

The Committee disagrees. Spain’s case, even taken at its highest, only shows that the

Tribunal made a mistake in calculating the appropriate quantum of damages. Such a

mistake, even if it exists, does not amount to a manifest excess of power by the Tribunal:
as stated in TECO, it is “not within [an annulment committee’s] powers to correct a
tribunal’s interpretation of the law or assessment of the facts”. ** Errors of law or fact

GROUND 2: SERIOUS DEPARTURE FROM A FUNDAMENTAL RULE OF
PROCEDURE

Spain’s Position

Spain submits that it was deprived of its right to submit two crucial pieces of evidence
in the Arbitration below, namely (i) the European Commission’s Decision C(2017)
7384 dated 10 November 2017 (“EC Decision 7384”) and (ii) the CJEU’s decision in
Achmea.* These were allegedly “vitally important documents” that would have
informed the Tribunal on the proper approach that should have been taken with regard
to EU law, and the Tribunal’s refusal to allow these documents to be added to the record

is a serious departure from a fundamental rule of natural justice.”

(i) Applicable standard _for_a serious departure from _a fundamental rule_of
procedure

Spain relies on the fundamental rule that a party to an arbitration must be given a full
and equal opportunity to present its case.°! This includes a right for parties to have “the
opportunity to present all the arguments and all the evidence that they deem relevant”
and to “address... every legal issue raised by the case”.°? Such a right is violated where
tribunals “[refuse] to allow the submission of an argument or evidence”.®* Further, even

though tribunals have the discretion to allow or reject the submission of arguments or

evidence, a serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure “cannot be justified
in light of a tribunal’s discretion” .**

Spain also submits that a ‘serious’ departure from a fundamental rule of procedure does
not require proof that “the result would have been different... if the rule had been
respected”.®> This is because requiring an applicant to “show that it would have won
the case or that the result of the case would have been different if the rule of procedure

had been respected is a highly speculative exercise”.°°

(ii) Whether the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure
by rejecting Spain’s request to submit new documents

 

Spain contends that the Tribunal’s refusal to admit EC Decision 7384 and the Achmea
decision were serious departures from the fundamental rule of procedure allowing

parties’ full and equal opportunity to present their cases.

Spain submits that the above documents were “essential” to its case.*’ The significance
of the Achmea decision to Spain’s case is discussed above. In summary, Spain contends
that the Achmea decision supports its position that EU law does not permit the
arbitration of intra-EU investor-State disputes under the ECT, and that the Tribunal

therefore has no jurisdiction over the Parties’ disputes.

EC Decision 7384, in Spain’s words, analyses Spain’s Disputed Measures “from the
perspective of State aid”.** In the Decision, the EC decided that the Disputed Measures
constituted State Aid under EU law,”? and that the State Aid was “proportionate” and
“does not exceed what is required to recover the initial investment costs and the
relevant operational costs, plus a margin of reasonable return”.'°° The EC further
stated that “there is no right to State Aid” and that “[a] Member State may always decide

not to grant an aid or put an end to an aid scheme”.'°! This would have affected the

Tribunal’s analysis on whether the Disputed Measures were contrary to the Claimants’

legitimate expectations. !°?

EC Decision 7384 also touches on the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the Parties’ dispute
and to award damages to the Claimants. The EC states in the Decision that “any
provision that provides for investor-State arbitration between two Member States is
contrary to Union law”, thus supporting Spain’s intra-EU objection.'°? The Decision
further suggests that the Tribunal has no competence to award damages to the Claimants,
stating that “any compensation which an Arbitral Tribunal were to grant to an investor
on the basis that Spain has modified the premium economic scheme by the notified
scheme would constitute in and of itself State aid. However, the Arbitral Tribunals are
not competent to authorize the granting of State Aid. That is an exclusive competence

of the Commission.” !°4

Spain argues that the Tribunal did not have valid reasons to refuse the admission of the
above documents to the record. In respect of EC Decision 7384, the Tribunal stated that
it had “a very advanced draft of the Tribunal’s Award” and did not consider it
“necessary to incorporate into the record the [Decision]” or “convenient to start a new
round of submissions with the Parties’ positions on that decision” .'° Spain submits
that the Tribunal’s reasons were inadequate as “the specific state of that deliberation
process cannot justify the infringement of an essential procedural right”.'°’ Moreover,
Spain notes that despite the Tribunal’s statements, there were three months between the
Tribunal’s refusal to admit EC Decision 7384 and the closing of the proceedings, and

seven months between the refusal and the rendering of the Award.'°”

As for the Achmea decision, the Tribunal found that Spain “did not articulate any
convincing reason why the ECJ Judgment shall be considered “new evidence” under
the terms of Arbitration Rule 38(2)” and that “reopening the proceeding requires more
than a general affirmation that the alleged ‘evidence’ affects jurisdiction and some

other issues related to the merits”.'°* Spain submits that the Tribunal’s reliance on “a

formality such as the distinction between ‘evidence’ and ‘authority’ cannot justify such

a serious limitation of a party's right of defence as that discussed here”.'°

For the above reasons, Spain submits that the Tribunal’s refusal to admit the above two
documents to the record constituted a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure.
It further argues that such a departure is a serious one, as it involved “an essential
element of Spain’s defence”; had these documents been analysed, the “result of the

underlying arbitration may very well have been different”.!'°

(iii) | Whether the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure
by refusing to grant the EC unconditional leave to intervene as amicus curiae

 

Spain’s Memorial on Annulment argues that the Tribunal’s refusal to grant the EC
unconditional leave to intervene as amicus curiae was a procedural breach that

“deprived the Parties... and the Tribunal itself of receiving the essential contribution

 

of such a key institution for an intra-EU dispute as is the European Commission”.'"!

Spain, however, appears to have dropped this argument in its Reply on Annulment,
stating that it “shall not submit to the Committee for consideration the response given
by the Antin Award Tribunal to the European Commission's request for amicus curiae

brief in the underlying arbitration” .''>

The Claimants’ Position
(i) Applicable standard for a serious departure from _a fundamental rule of
procedure

The Claimants state that “it is a high bar to establish that a tribunal has unequivocally
and objectively violated a party’s right to be heard’.!'> The Claimants submit that, as
annulment proceedings are not appeals, “it is not for the Committee to revisit the
Tribunal’s assessment of the parties’ arguments on procedural issues to determine if
they agree with that assessment’.''* As observed by the annulment committee in
Venezuela Holdings, an annulment committee should not assess whether “either side

was right or wrong in [their procedural arguments]” but should only consider “the

possible effect of the Tribunal’s refusal to order disclosure”.'!> Annulment should only
be ordered where “a tribunal reached its ultimate award on a ground that one or both

parties had had no opportunity to address at all in its argument” ."'6

The Claimants also argue that an annullable error would be highly unlikely to occur in
areas where the tribunal has considerable discretion, such as that of whether to admit
evidence to the record.!!” Thus, while “[a] clear violation of a rule of evidence, such as
the reversal of the burden of proof, may amount to a serious violation of a fundamental
rule of procedure... the evaluation of evidence is within the discretion of the

tribunal” |'8

Further, the Claimants submit that according to some committees a departure from a
tule of procedure is ‘serious’ only where a party suffers material prejudice as a
consequence of the departure. !!? A departure would be material and require an
annulment if it “affects the legal right of the parties with respect to an outcome-
determinative issue” and the Committee finds that “if the rule had been observed the

tribunal could have reached a different conclusion” .'”°

(ii) Whether the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure
by rejecting Spain’s request to submit new documents

 

The Claimants contend that the Tribunal has “duly considered the Parties’ positions as
to whether or not the Achmea judgment and the Commission's 2017 Decision should
be submitted to the record” and argues that the Committee should not “second-guess
the Tribunal’s conclusion or replace it with a different one”.'?' According to the
Claimants, the Tribunal “afforded Spain every opportunity to make its case, but Spain’s

arguments were either delayed, unconvincing or hardly made at all” .'?

192. The Claimants point out that, pursuant to section 16.3 of Procedural Order No. | in the
Arbitration, neither Party was permitted to submit additional documents to the record
after filing their respective last written submissions, unless “under exceptional
circumstances at the discretion of the Tribunal upon a reasoned written request
followed by observations from the other party”.' The Tribunal had given detailed
reasons for its decision to reject Spain’s requests to submit EC Decision 7384 and the
Achmea decision, and the Committee should not second-guess the Tribunal’s
reasons, !4

193. The Claimants also dispute that the Tribunal’s decision impacted Spain’s right to be
heard. They note that “the issues to which the Commission’s 2017 Decision and the
Achmea judgment were allegedly principally relevant—the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal—had been addressed in detail by both Parties during the Arbitration” .'?>

194. Finally, the Claimants argue that “[e]ven ifthe Achmea judgment and the Commission's
2017 Decision had been submitted to the record in the Arbitration, however, this would

have had no impact on the outcome of the case”.'°°

Cc. The Committee’s Analysis

195. The Committee considers that the Tribunal did not seriously depart from a fundamental
tule of procedure. In the Committee’s view, it is the Tribunal’s prerogative to determine
the relevance of Spain’s documents to the issues before it, and to decide whether to
admit such documents to the record. Moreover, the Tribunal’s rejection of Spain’s
request did not deprive Spain of the opportunity to make submissions on the salient

issues in the Arbitration.

(i) Applicable standard _for_a serious departure from _a fundamental rule of
procedure

196. Article 52(1)(d) of the ICSID Convention permits annulment where “there has been a

serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure”.'*" There is no dispute that

27 Both the English and French texts of the ICSID Convention refer in Article 52(1)(d) to a serious departure
from a fund: I rule of procedure (“serious dey froma rule of inobservation

Case 1:18-cv-01753-EGS Document 46-1 Filed 08/04/21 Page 46 of 68

there are three conditions that must be satisfied for annulment to be viable: (i) the
procedural rule alleged to be violated must be ‘fundamental’; (ii) there must be a

departure from that rule; and (iii) the departure must be ‘serious’.

As regards the first condition, there is no dispute that the parties’ right to be heard is a
fundamental rule of procedure applicable to the Arbitration.'?* Where parties disagree
is on whether the Tribunal has departed from said rule, and if so, whether the alleged

departure was serious.

As regards the second condition, the Committee accepts that “the refusal to order the
production of documents may, under certain circumstances, constitute a breach of a
party’s opportunity or the right to be heard”.'?? While international tribunals have the
discretion to decide whether to allow the submission of documents or evidence to the

record, this discretion remains “subject to the parties’ right to due process”.'*°

A party’s right to be heard, however, does not entitle it to submit to the record any
document it wishes. Tribunals may refuse to admit documents to the record in a
multitude of circumstances, such as where the documents are deemed to be irrelevant
or where admission may unnecessarily prolong proceedings. This discretion would be
nugatory if tribunals had to allow every request by a party to submit further evidence.
Moreover, given that annulment proceedings are not an appeal, annulment committees
should accordingly refrain from assessing whether a tribunal’s procedural order was
“right or wrong... as a matter of law or as a matter of discretionary assessment”.'?!
Only in cases where a party has been deprived of an opportunity to present its case

should annulment be ordered. '°?

As for the third condition, the Committee notes that there is some variance in the

jurisprudence on what constitutes a “serious” departure from a fundamental rule of

rule of procedure (“quebrantamiento grave de una norma de procedimiento”). The Committee agrees with the
analysis of the Committee in the annulment proceeding of EDF v. Argentina in paragraph 199 of the Decision on
Annulment and will refer in its decision to a quebrantamiento grave de una norma fundamental de procedimiento
(“serious departure from a fundamental rule of procedure”).

procedure. Certain committees have held that “in order to be grounds for annulment,
the departure has to have a material impact on the outcome of the award’.'> The
applicant must therefore prove that the departure in question would have affected the

outcome of the award.

Other ad hoc committees have adopted a more flexible position. In Pey Casado v. Chile,
the committee held that “[t]he applicant is not required to show that the result would
have been different, that it would have won the case, if the rule had been respected” .'**
This is to avoid having the annulment committee “enter into the realm of speculation
which it should not do”.'*> For annulment to be ordered, it suffices for the committee
to be satisfied that “the Award might have been substantially different” (emphasis
added). '3¢

The Committee considers the approach in Pey Casado reasonable. In the Committee’s
view, it would be unrealistic to require a party to prove that the outcome of an award
would have been different had a departure from a fundamental rule of procedure not
occurred. As held by the annulment committee in Tulip, “[w]here a complex decision
depends on a number of factors, it is almost impossible to prove with certainty whether
the change of one parameter would have altered the outcome”.!*’ Moreover, such a
determination would require the Committee to go into the merits of the Parties’
arguments and the Tribunal’s decision, which is inappropriate given the limited nature

of annulment proceedings under the ICSID Convention.

(ii) Whether the Tribunal seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure
by rejecting Spain’s request to submit new documents

 

Applying the above principles, the Committee does not find that the Tribunal’s refusal
to admit Spain’s further evidence constitutes a serious departure from a fundamental

tule of procedure.

Case 1:18-cv-01753-EGS Document 46-1 Filed 08/04/21 Page 48 of 68

First, the Committee is not persuaded that the Tribunal’s decision deprived Spain of the
opportunity to present its case. As the Claimants correctly point out, the principal issue
to which EC Decision 7384 and the Achmea judgment are relevant — the intra~-EU
objection — was extensively briefed by the Parties during the Arbitration.'** There is no
dispute that Spain had in the Arbitration made both written and oral submissions on this
issue. Thus, even if Spain could not introduce two supporting pieces of evidence to the

record, this did not deprive it of the opportunity to present its case.

Secondly, the Committee considers it to be within the Tribunal’s discretion whether to
accept Spain’s further submissions. In Procedural Order No. 1, the Parties agreed that
they would not have the right to submit further documents after their written
submissions had been filed. Such further documents would only be admissible in
“exceptional circumstances at the discretion of the Tribunal”.'*? Having accepted the
Tribunal’s discretion to disallow the submission of further documents, Spain should not
be readily allowed to challenge the Tribunal’s exercise of said discretion against their
favour. The Committee, as stated at paragraph 157 above, will not review the merits of

the Tribunal’s reasoning in deciding to reject Spain’s requests.

Thirdly, and in any event, the Committee is not convinced that the departure alleged by
Spain is a “serious” one that may have changed the outcome of the Award. EC Decision
7384 and the Achmea judgment concern interpretations of EU law by EU institutions.
The Tribunal, however, expressly rejected the notion that “the treaties creating the EEC
and the EU and allocating competences among European institutions and their
Member States, the EU’s internal legislation, as subsequently interpreted by the CJEU,
could be interpreted in a manner such that a development in the EU's acquis could be
employed to undermine the prior consents to submit to arbitration under the ECT given
by each of the EU Member States and the EU itself’.'*° In the Tribunal’s view, “[t]he
alleged problem of incompatibility between EU law and the ECT, if there is one, is to
be sorted out by the EU and the EU States counterparties to the ECT’.'*! Given the

Tribunal’s views, the Committee does not see how the statements of EU law in EC

Decision 7384 and the Achmea judgment would have changed the Tribunal’s overall

analysis.

GROUND 3: FAILURE TO STATE REASONS IN THE AWARD

Spain’s Position

Spain argues that the Award should be annulled under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID
Convention as the Tribunal failed to state its reasons for (i) the non-application of EU
law to the Parties’ dispute; (ii) its conclusions on liability regarding Spain’s alleged

breaches of the ECT; and (iii) the quantification of the damages awarded by the

Tribunal. !%?

(i) Applicable standard for failure to state reasons

Spain argues that an award may be annulled for a failure to state reasons where it does
not allow the reader to “follow how the tribunal proceeded from Point A. to Point B.”.'
Even where a tribunal has provided reasons for its decision, annulment may still be
appropriate where the reasons given are “insufficient or inadequate” in that they
“cannot, in themselves, be a reasonable basis for the solution arrived at”.'** Likewise,
annulment may be justified where the reasons given by the tribunal are contradictory to

its other findings. '*°

(ii) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for not applying EU law

Spain argues that the Tribunal failed to address Spain’s submissions that EU law
governed the merits of the Claimants’ claim as well as the scope of the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute. '4° Spain, in particular, takes issue with the
Tribunal’s holding that “the different concepts of substantive protections under EU law,
which would apply to the merits of a dispute brought under EU law, should not be
confused with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal”.'*" The Tribunal, Spain submits, did not

provide “a single reason, a single legal authority, which allows the Parties to know on

what grounds it distinguishes between the law applicable to the merits of the dispute

and the law applicable to the determination of its jurisdiction” .'*8

(iii) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its findings of liability

Spain contends that the Tribunal failed to provide reasons for a number of findings

regarding Spain’s liability for the breach of the ECT.

First, Spain argues that the Committee gave no reasons for its finding that Article 10(1)
of the ECT requires Spain “not to alter the essential characteristics of [Spain’s] legal
framework”.'*? This is particularly so given that the Tribunal also found that the ECT

“does not cancel or ‘extremely limit’ the State’s regulatory power”.!°°

Secondly, Spain argues that the Tribunal failed to explain why the Further Measures
were a breach of the ECT.!*! In its Award, the Tribunal found that it was “undisputed
that through RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013, Spain (a) replaced the FIT system by a
remuneration system that allowed certain RE installations to obtain a special payment
by reference to a standard installation and (b) withdrew the right of priority of grid
access and priority of dispatch for RE installations”. The Tribunal consequently held
these measures to be in breach of Article 10(1) of the ECT since they “dismantled all
the regime and therefore all the features of the regime provided for under RD
661/2007”.'*? According to Spain, however, it was not undisputed that the FIT system
was replaced or that the rights of priority of grid access and priority of dispatch were
withdrawn. '** The Tribunal’s findings of breach were therefore based upon an

“absolutely unsupported conclusion” .'*4

Further, Spain argues that the Tribunal failed to (i) provide “analysis of each disputed

measure and their relationship to the FET standard... [or] with regards to their specific

impact on the regime of RD 661/2007”,'>> and to (ii) explain the concept of ‘reasonable

return’ referred to in its Award.!°°

(iv) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its assessment of damages

 

First, Spain complains that the Tribunal did not explain why it adopted the standard of
“fair market value” in measuring the Claimants’ losses.'°’ Spain notes that the Tribunal
found that the fair market value standard is found in the context of expropriation, but

failed to explain why it would also apply to a breach of the ECT’s FET obligations. !**

Secondly, Spain argues that the Tribunal failed to explain how it assessed the quantum
of the Claimants’ loss. Spain says that it is “materially impossible to follow the
reasoning of the Antin Award when it comes to determining why it eliminates historic
losses but does not correct the But-For scenario to reflect its conclusions on measures
declared not to be in breach of the ECT”’.'*? It also argues that the Tribunal never
explained how it estimated the difference in damages to be awarded based on its finding

that the Claimants’ plants had a 25-year (and not 40-year) useful life.'®

The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants argue that Spain is simply taking issue with the correctness of the
Tribunal’s reasons, and that such grievances are not grounds for annulment. In any
event, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal’s reasons are well-founded and not

contradictory.

(i) Applicable standard for failure to state reasons

The Claimants stress that an award can only be annulled for a failure to give reasons
where it fails to allow “a good faith reader of the award [to] understand the motives
that led the Tribunal to adopt its decisions”.'®' All the Committee has to ascertain

therefore is that the Tribunal’s reasons to support its conclusion can be followed by a

reader. On the contrary, “[t]he correctness, persuasiveness or adequacy of reasons (or

lack thereof) cannot constitute grounds for annulment” .'°

218. The Claimants also submit that tribunals are not required to be comprehensive in the

27163

duty to follow the parties in the detail of their arguments” .'* There is, for instance, “no
need for a Tribunal to provide reasons on issues which have become irrelevant to the
outcome of the case” .!® Nor are tribunals required to state all their reasons explicitly.
Its reasons may, for example, be “implicit in the considerations and conclusions

contained in the award, provided they can be reasonably inferred from the terms used

in the decision” '°°

219. Further, the Claimants argue that contradictory reasons do not necessitate annulment.
While a small number of committees have opined that contradictory reasons may
trigger annulment, the contradictions must be “such as to be incapable of standing
together on any reasonable reading of the decision.”'®’ Inconsistencies in an award

may only justify annulment where they make it “impossible to understand the motives

that led such tribunal to adopt its solution” .'°

(ii) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for not applying EU law

that EU law could not undermine the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, because that question
could only be determined under the rules of the Treaty and applicable rules of

international law”.' The Tribunal, applying the rules of treaty interpretation under

international law, then concluded that Article 26 of the ECT authorised intra-EU

arbitration.!”°

The Claimants further argue that the Tribunal was not inconsistent in finding that EU
law could be relevant to the merits of the Parties’ dispute, but not to the question of the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction under the ECT. The Tribunal assessed both Spain’s liability as
well as its jurisdiction under the terms of the ECT, but noted that the assessment of
Spain’s liability may include considerations, as a matter of fact, of aspects of Spanish

and EU law.!7!

(iii) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its findings on liability

According to the Claimants, Spain is taking issue with the legal and factual reasoning
adopted by the Tribunal, which are not grounds for annulment.'” In any event, the

Claimants argue that Spain’s criticisms of the Award are meritless.'7*

First, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal had laid out reasons for finding that the fair
and equitable treatment (“FET”) standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT prevents
Spain from making significant modifications to its renewable energy regulations. The
Tribunal referred to the decisions of prior ECT tribunals that “stable and equitable
conditions are clearly part of the [FET] standard under the ECT’.'™ Based on this
analysis, the Tribunal found that the ECT’s FET standard required a “balancing process”
which permits interference with “domestic regulatory and administrative sovereignty”
as long as the interference was required “in order to upgrade the quality of governance”

and not to become “excessively interventionist” .‘7>

Secondly, the Claimants submit that Spain does not challenge the existence of the
Tribunal’s reasons for why it found Spain liable, but rather challenges the merits of the
Tribunal’s conclusions.'” Disagreements with the Tribunal’s factual findings cannot
give rise to grounds for annulment. Further, and in any event, the Claimants argue that

the Tribunal had provided adequate reasons for its conclusions on liability. In short, the

Tribunal found that Spain had made statements giving the Claimants legitimate
expectations that the economic regime and incentives provided by Spain would “remain
stable and predictable”.'" Spain’s New Regime eliminated essential features of the

original regime, hence constituting a breach of Article 10(1).'8

Thirdly, the Claimants submit that the Tribunal need not have analysed each of the
Disputed Measures independently.!”? The Tribunal determined that it was the New
Regime (comprising the Further Measures) that eliminated the essential feature of the
regulatory framework under which the Claimants had invested, thereby breaching
Spain’s obligation under ECT Article 10(1). This did not depend on any finding
regarding the Earlier Measures. As stated in Churchill Mining, there is “no need for a
Tribunal to provide reasons on issues which have become irrelevant to the outcome of

the case” '*°

(iv) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its assessment of damages

 

The Claimants submit that the Tribunal’s assessment of damages is well-reasoned. First,
the Tribunal had explained why and how it arrived at the standard of “fair market value”
as the appropriate way to value the Claimants’ losses.'*! This standard was determined
based on international law, as encapsulated in the Chorzow case and Article 31 of the
ILC Articles of State Responsibility. '** It was also consistent with the decisions of other

tribunals finding a breach of the FET standard.'**

Secondly, the Claimants argue that the Tribunal did not adjust the But-For scenario for
the Claimants’ future cash flows to include the Earlier Measures because the Earlier
Measures were stated to be temporary.'*4 Even if the Tribunal was incorrect on this,

that is not a ground for annulment.!*5

Thirdly, the Claimants point out that the Tribunal had discussed the Parties’ expert

reports and submissions on damages at length, commenting on their persuasiveness and

adopting them when it considered appropriate.'*° This sets the present case apart from
the TECO decision cited by Spain, where there was a “complete absence of any

discussion” by the tribunal “of the Parties’ expert reports” .'87

The Committee’s Analysis

The Committee finds that the Tribunal has provided reasons for the findings in its
Award and there is therefore no ground for annulment under Article 52(1)(e) of the

ICSID Convention.

(i) Applicable standard for failure to state reasons

The high standards for annulment under the ICSID Convention apply with equal force
to Article 52(1)(e). For an award to be annulled, the Committee must be satisfied that
the Tribunal’s award is impossible to follow “from Point A. to Point B.” or that there is
a “significant lacuna in the Award which makes it impossible for the reader to follow
the [Tribunal’s] reasoning”.'*® This does not, and should not, require the Committee to
delve into the adequacy or robustness of the Tribunal’s reasoning. As explained by the

MINE v. Guinea committee:'”

“\.. The adequacy of the reasoning is not an appropriate standard of
review under paragraph (1)(e), because it almost inevitably draws
an ad hoc Committee into an examination of the substance of the
tribunal’s decision, in disregard of the exclusion of the remedy of
appeal by Article 53 of the Convention. A Committee might be
tempted to annul an award because that examination disclosed a
manifestly incorrect application of the law, which, however, is not a
ground for annulment.”

It is rare, of course, for tribunals to completely fail to give reasons for their award, and
the Committee accepts Spain’s argument that the remedy of annulment under Article
52(1)(e) is not restricted to such cases only. However, while frivolous or contradictory
reasons may be a basis for annulment, this should only apply where the contradictions
cause the award to be “incapable of standing together on any reasonable reading of

the decision” (emphasis added).'*° As stated in Continental Casualty, where it is

“merely arguable whether there is a contradiction or inconsistency in the tribunal’s
reasoning, it is not for an annulment committee to resolve that argument”.'°' Further,
the Committee is mindful that “tribunals must often struggle to balance conflicting
considerations... [and] an ad hoc committee should be careful not to discern
contradiction when what is actually expressed in a tribunal’s reasons could more truly

be said to be but a reflection of such conflicting considerations”. '°?

Further, the Committee accepts the Claimants’ submissions that a tribunal is not
required to state every reason explicitly, nor is it required to address all the parties’
arguments individually. Rather, the Committee takes the same view as that in Teinver:
that an award “must be considered in its entirety” when assessing whether the tribunal

has provided reasons for its decisions. '**

The Committee further agrees with the ad hoc committees in MINE vy. Guinea and in
Amco v. Indonesia in that the ICSID Convention does not require an automatic exercise
by an annulment committee of its authority to annul an award even if a ground has been
established. '** This measure of discretion retained by the committee is justified when
annulment would “unjustifiably erode the binding force and finality of ICSID

awards” 15

In summary, the principle is that an award should only be annulled under Article 52(1)(e)
where there are gaps in the tribunal’s reasoning so large as to make it impossible to
follow. An award may contain various errors, omissions, inconsistencies or
contradictions but even then, annulment cannot be justified unless they meet the high
threshold required. An annulment committee is not authorized to qualify a tribunal’s
reasoning as deficient, superficial or otherwise faulty and to substitute its own
judgement for the tribunal’s. This accords with the principle of finality set out in the

ICSID Convention, and prevents parties from sieving through an award with a fine-

toothed comb for any errors or logical inconsistencies, however minor, in the hopes of

annulling a tribunal’s award.

(ii) Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for not applying EU law

 

Applying the above principles, the Committee finds that the Tribunal had provided

comprehensible reasons for not applying EU law to its determination of jurisdiction.

In summary, the Tribunal held that Article 26(1) of the ECT, read in accordance with
its ordinary meaning and considering the object and purpose of the ECT, confers the
Tribunal with jurisdiction over the Parties’ dispute.'°° On their plain and ordinary
reading, the ECT provides the Tribunal with the jurisdiction to entertain claims against
Spain (a Contracting Party) by investors of Luxembourg and the Netherlands (both

Contracting Parties) related to investments made by the Claimants in Spain.'%”

The Tribunal also explained its view that the object and purpose of the ECT does not

preclude intra-EU arbitration. The Tribunal held that:

a. Other ECT tribunals, including the tribunals in Charanne v. Spain; Isolux v.
Spain; and Eiser v. Spain, had rejected a similar argument that the context of
the ECT results in the exclusion of intra-EU investor-State disputes under the

ECT. 98

b. The ECT’s purpose does not support Spain’s interpretation. Nothing in Article
2 of the ECT, captioned “Purpose of the Treaty”, “suggests the exclusion of
claims by investors who are nationals of an EU Member State who is also a

party to the ECT against another EU Member State”. '°°

c. The fact that the EU is also a Contracting Party and a “Regional Economic
International Organization” (“REIO”) as defined in Articles 1(2) and 1(3) of
the ECT does not bar the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The ordinary meaning of
Articles 1(2), 1(3) and 1(10) recognise the existence of REIOs as possible

Contracting Parties and allows a claim to be brought by an investor in the

REIO’s defined area.?

d. The Tribunal’s jurisdiction arises from the express terms of the ECT which is
binding on the State parties and the EU. The EU treaties creating the EEC and
the EU cannot be interpreted in a manner that undermines the prior consents to
submit to arbitration under the ECT given by each of the EU Member States
and the EU itself.?°! The alleged problem of incompatibility between EU law
and the ECT, if there is one, is to be sorted out by the EU and the EU States

counterparties to the ECT.

Further, the Committee does not agree with Spain that the Tribunal contradicted itself
by finding that “the different concepts of substantive protections under EU law, which
would apply to the merits of a dispute brought under EU law, should not be confused
with the jurisdiction of the Tribunal” °°? Whether correct or not, there is on its face no
contradiction in the Tribunal’s finding that EU law, although relevant to the question
of whether there has been a breach of the investor protection provisions of the ECT, is

of no import in determining the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

For the foregoing reasons, the Committee finds that the Tribunal has stated clearly and
comprehensibly its reasons for concluding that EU law would not apply to bar its
jurisdiction. While Spain may dispute the soundness of the Tribunal’s premises and

findings, such criticisms do not give rise to a ground for annulment.

(iii) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state its reasons for its findings on liability

The Committee also finds that the Tribunal has stated its reasons for finding Spain liable

for breaches of the ECT.

First, the Tribunal has stated its basis for finding that the FET standard under Article
10(1) of the ECT comprises “an obligation to afford fundamental stability in the
essential characteristics of the legal regime relied upon by the investors in making long-
term investments... [and] means that a regulatory regime specifically created to induce

investments in the energy sector cannot be radically altered —i.e., stripped of its key

features— as applied to existing investments in ways that affect investors who invested
in reliance on those regimes”.”®? The Tribunal found that this was the appropriate
standard after considering (i) the ordinary meaning of the term ‘stable’ as found in
Article 10(1) of the ECT; and (ii) the findings of other ECT tribunals on the proper FET
standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT." There is no difficulty in following the

Tribunal’s reasoning on this issue.

Spain argues that the Award “does not include a sufficiently clear reasoning for the
Parties to know why, if the State maintains its regulatory power to adjust regulations

to the economic situation for the purpose of general interest (point A), a State cannot,

 

 

 

for these same reasons, make a signifi dification to the regulatic h

essential characteristics thereof (point B)”.?°° The Committee disagrees that there is
any contradiction that has not been explained. The Tribunal stated that while Article
10(1) of the ECT does not cancel the State’s regulatory power, a State in exercising this
power cannot “suddenly and unexpectedly eliminate the essential features of the
regulatory framework in place” as such unexpected changes undermines the
fundamental stability that investors rely on in making long-term investments.7°° Clear

reasons have therefore been given for the Tribunal’s position.

Secondly, the Committee disagrees with Spain’s submission that the Tribunal should
have “analysed each one of the disputed measures under the aforementioned standard
of Fair and Equitable Treatment”.””” To begin, it is well-recognised that tribunals are
not required to deal with each and every argument raised by the parties. A tribunal is

29208

“entitled to be terse”*** and has “no duty to follow the parties in the detail of their

arguments”?

In any event, the Tribunal has given clear and specific reasons for finding Spain’s
Further Measures to be in breach of the ECT. The Tribunal specifically found that RDL
9/2013 and Law 24/2013 removed key features of the Original Regime by replacing the

FIT system and withdrawing the right of priority of grid access and priority of dispatch

for RE installations.?!° It also found that RDL 9/2013, Law 24/2013 and Ministerial
Order IET/1045/2014 “dismantled all the regime and therefore all the features of the
regime provided for under RD 661/2007”.?'' These reasons clearly allow the reader to
understand why the above referred measures breached the FET standard set out in

Article 10(1) of the ECT.

Spain also argues that the Tribunal committed a “crucial falsehood” by finding that it
was “undisputed” that “through RDL 9/2013 and Law 24/2013, Spain (a) replaced the
FIT system by a remuneration system that allowed certain RE installations to obtain a
special payment by reference to a standard installation and (b) withdrew the right of
priority of grid access and priority of dispatch for RE installations”.*'" According to
Spain, these propositions were contested by Spain in the Arbitration; the Tribunal’s
assumption that these issues were undisputed is a “precarious basis to reach an

absolutely unsupported conclusion”?

In the Committee’s view, Spain’s complaint, even if true, is not a basis for annulment.
All it would mean is that the Tribunal misunderstood Spain’s position and arguments,
but such misunderstandings, even if material, are not grounds for annulment. Article
52(1)(e) does not allow the Committee “to assess the correctness or persuasiveness of

the reasoning in the award or to inquire into the quality of the reasons” ?'*

Finally, Spain submits that the Tribunal “adds a new and unsupported element” to its
reasoning by considering the notion of “reasonable return” in assessing whether there
has been a breach of the ECT.!> Spain complains that the Tribunal’s conclusions on

this concept “emerges out of the blue” and lacks any reasoning.”!°

The Committee again disagrees with Spain’s analysis. In its Award, the Tribunal states
that the concept of reasonable return was raised by Spain, who had argued that the
Claimants “were only entitled to a reasonable return on their investment and could not

reasonably have held other expectations”.?'" It is therefore not a novel issue that

emerged “out of the blue”, as Spain contends. The Tribunal then rejected Spain’s
argument on the basis that the methodology for determining the “reasonable rate of
return” is “not based on any identifiable criteria” .*'* Spain has not identified anything

objectionable in the Tribunal’s analysis that warrants annulment.

In the premises, the Committee finds that the Tribunal has provided reasons for its
findings on liability. Spain’s unhappiness with the quality of these reasons is not a basis

for annulling the Award.

(iv) | Whether the Tribunal failed to state reasons for its assessment of damages

 

The Committee finds that the Tribunal had provided reasons for its award of damages.

First, the Committee disagrees with Spain’s submission that the Tribunal failed to
provide reasons for its decision to base damages on the “reduction of the fair market
value of the Claimants’ investment”.*'? In its Award, the Tribunal found that the
appropriate standard for compensation should be based on international law. 7°
International law in turn provides that reparation must “as far as possible, wipe out all
the consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the situation which would, in all
probability, have existed if that act had not been committed”.”' The Tribunal then
found that the appropriate method for calculating damages, in light of the above, would
be to “assess the reduction of the fair market value of the Claimants’ investment by
determining the present value of cash flows claimed to have been lost as a result of the

Disputed Measures”.””* The Tribunal’s reasons are, in the Committee’s view, clear and

comprehensible. There is no basis for annulment.

Secondly, Spain argues that the Tribunal did not explain “why it eliminates historic
losses but does not correct the But-For scenario to reflect its conclusions on measures
declared not to be in breach of the ECT’.*> The Committee finds such criticism
unwarranted. To begin, Spain does not appear to have argued that the Claimants’ But-
For calculations should be adjusted to assume that the Earlier Measures would continue

in perpetuity. The Tribunal therefore should not be faulted for not addressing such an

issue. Furthermore, there does not even appear to be evidence led in the Arbitration
showing that the Earlier Measures would be continued. On the contrary, Spain’s
position was, as the Claimants point out, that the effects of the Earlier Measures had
been “absorbed” or “neutralised” by the New Regime.” In the Committee’s view, the
Tribunal’s lack of reasoning on an issue not argued before it cannot be a ground for

annulment.

In any event, even if the Tribunal erred in failing to account for the continuation of the
Earlier Measures in its calculation of the Claimants’ lost cash flows, this is an error of

fact that would not permit annulment.

Thirdly, Spain argues that the Tribunal, after finding that the Claimants’ plants had a
useful life of 25 and not 40 years, did not explain how it “estimated the difference in

value between the possible lifetime scenarios” >

The Committee accepts that the Tribunal did not provide a detailed explanation for how
it arrived at a figure of €36 million as the estimated difference in value between the
possible lifetime scenarios considered. In its Decision on Rectification, the Tribunal
explained that this was the Tribunal’s own estimate “based on the evidence in the
record and the reports of the experts”.?*> There is no further explanation for how said

evidence and reports support this figure.

Notwithstanding this lack of detail, the Committee does not consider the Tribunal’s
conclusion to be unsupported by reasons. Estimates of damages are, by their nature,
approximations that a tribunal makes based on its view on the underlying facts and
evidence. These are exercises of discretion and judgment that do not lend themselves
well to detailed explanation or precise calculation. As stated in Gemplus v. Mexico,
tribunals “have a wide margin of appreciation to make reasonable approximations in
such circumstances... [t}hese matters are not capable of precise quantification because
they depend on the exercise of judgmental factors that are better expressed in

approximations or ranges”.??” It is therefore accepted that “there is no obligation upon

a tribunal to provide a detailed point by point justification of every step that it has taken
in the course of a valuation such as this”.??8 In view of this, the Committee finds that

the Tribunal had not failed its duty to provide reasons for its assessment of damages.

In any event, it is clear from the Award that the Tribunal had considered and was
attentive to the Parties’ evidence and expert reports on damages and the value of the
Claimants’ lost cash flows.?”? There is no reason to question therefore the Tribunal’s
explanation that its estimate on damages was “based on the evidence in the record and

the reports of the experts”.”*° Further, the Tribunal’s findings show that it took Spain’s
objections into consideration but found that “such disagreement [with the methodology
of the Tribunal or its conclusions as regards the estimation of damages related to the
lifetime of the plants] does not give rise to rectification under the ICSID
Convention”.*' Even if Spain contends that the Tribunal should have adopted a
different figure, in the Committee’s views, such disagreements with the Tribunal’s

methodology are not grounds for annulment.

For the above reasons, the Committee finds that there is no basis to annul the Award
under Article 52(1)(e) of the ICSID Convention.

The Committee’s Decision on Costs

Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

“In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as

the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the

parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how

and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members

of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the

Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.”
This provision, together with Arbitration Rule 47(1)(j) (applied by virtue of Arbitration
Rule 53) gives the Committee discretion to allocate all costs of the proceeding,

including attorney’s fees and other costs, between the Parties as it deems appropriate.

The costs of the proceeding, including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID’s

administrative fees and direct expenses, amount to (in USD):

Committee Members’ fees and expenses

President 116,843.09
Member 147,375.00
Member 153,541.77
ICSID’s administrative fees 126,000.00
Direct expenses 61,678.02

The above costs have been paid out of the advances made by Spain pursuant to

Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(e).?>*

In exercising the discretion described at paragraph 141 above, the Committee finds that
the distribution of costs should be made considering the relative success of submissions
made by each of the Parties, together with the circumstances of the case and the conduct

of the Parties in the proceedings.

In the present case, the Committee has decided to reject in full Spain’s application to
annul the Award. The practice of recent ICSID annulment committees has been to order
costs to be paid by the annulment applicant when annulment is refused.?*> Spain, in its
costs submissions, have also endorsed the principle that costs should be allocated to the
losing party.?*4 The Committee sees no reason to depart from this practice in the present
case. Given that Spain did not succeed on any of the grounds of annulment raised, it
would be appropriate for the Claimants to be compensated in full for the fees and

expenses incurred in defending against Spain’s annulment application.

Accordingly, the Committee orders Spain to bear all the costs of the proceedings,
including the fees and expenses of the Committee, ICSID’s administrative fees and
direct expenses, and pay €2,310,379.38 to the Claimants in respect of the Claimants’

legal fees and expenses.

DECISIONS AND ORDERS

For the reasons stated above, the Committee:
a. Rejects Spain’s application for annulment;

b. Decides that Spain shall bear all the costs of the proceedings, including the fees
and expenses of the Committee, ICSID’s administrative fees and direct expenses
(as reflected in ICSID’s final financial statement) and pay €2,310,379.38 to the

Claimants in respect of the Claimants’ legal fees and expenses.

‘The remaining balance will be reimbursed to the Applicant.
