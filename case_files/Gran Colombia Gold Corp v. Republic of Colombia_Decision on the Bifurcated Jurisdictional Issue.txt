INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre”) on the basis of the Free Trade Agreement
between Canada and the Republic of Colombia signed on 21 November 2008 and which
entered into force on 15 August 2011 (the “FTA” or the “Treaty”), and the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which

entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The claimant is Gran Colombia Gold Corp. (“GCG” or “Claimant’”), a company

incorporated under the laws of British Columbia, Canada.
The respondent is the Republic of Colombia (“Colombia” or “Respondent”).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to Colombia’s measures and omissions which have allegedly
negatively impacted the Claimant’s investments in the Colombian gold and silver

mining sectors.

The Claimant alleges that Colombia has breached its obligations under (i) Article 811 of
the Treaty by means of the indirect expropriation of its investments; (ii) Article 805 of the
Treaty and customary international law concerning the standard of full protection and
security; and (iii) Article 805 of the Treaty concerning the fair and equitable treatment
standard. The Claimant submits that it is entitled to receive compensation for damage

caused as a result of the Respondent’s violations of the Treaty.

The Respondent alleges that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction over the Claimant’s
claims. Among other jurisdictional objections, the Respondent claims that Colombia has
effectively denied the benefits of the FTA to the Claimant pursuant to Article 814(2) of the
Treaty (the “DoB Objection”). The Claimant acknowledges that Colombia purported to
deny such benefits, by letter of 31 May 2018, but contends that this was improper and
without effect. Additionally, the Claimant submits an ancillary claim under ICSID

1

Arbitration Rule 40, alleging that Colombia has breached Article 814(2) of the FTA by
means of its unfounded denial of benefits to GCG. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal
should reject the Claimant’s claim, on the basis that the requirements of Rule 40 are

not met.

This Decision sets out the Tribunal’s ruling on the Respondent’s DoB Objection and upon

the admissibility of the Claimant’s ancillary claim.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

On 29 May 2018, ICSID received a request for arbitration from GCG against Colombia
(“Request for Arbitration”).

On 2 July 2018, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration in
accordance with Article 36(3) of the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes
between States and Nationals of Other States (““ICSID Convention”). In the Notice of
Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral
tribunal as soon as possible in accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure

for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

The Parties agreed to constitute the Tribunal in accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the
ICSID Convention as follows: the Tribunal would consist of three arbitrators, one to be
appointed by each Party, and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement
of the Parties.

The Tribunal was composed (until 5 February 2019) of Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, a national
of Italy, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Prof. Bernard Hanotiau, a
national of Belgium, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern, a national of

France, appointed by the Respondent.

On 31 October 2018, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for
Arbitration Proceedings (“ICSID Arbitration Rules”), the Secretary-General notified the

Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was

therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Mrs. Ana Constanza Conover

Blancas, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.

On 26 November 2018, the Claimant filed a proposal for disqualification of Ms. Loretta
Malintoppi and the proceeding was suspended in accordance with ICSID Arbitration
Rule 9(6). On 12 December 2018, the Respondent filed observations on the proposal for
disqualification. On 21 December 2018, Ms. Malintoppi furnished explanations in
accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 9(3). On 4 January 2019, the Claimant filed
additional observations on the proposal for disqualification. On 5 February 2019, following
the resignation of arbitrator Ms. Loretta Malintoppi, the Secretary-General notified the

Parties of the vacancy on the Tribunal.

On 25 April 2019, Ms. Jean E. Kalicki, a national of the United States, accepted her
appointment as presiding arbitrator, appointed by the Parties in accordance with ICSID
Arbitration Rule 11(1). On the same date, the Tribunal was reconstituted. Its members are:
Ms. Jean E. Kalicki, President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Prof. Bernard
Hanotiau, appointed by the Claimant; and Prof. Brigitte Stern, appointed by
the Respondent.

On 6 June 2019, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first

session with the Parties by telephone conference.

Following the first session, on 24 June 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1
recording the Parties’ agreements on procedural matters and the decisions of the Tribunal
on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. 1 established, inter alia, that the applicable
Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006, that the procedural
languages would be English and Spanish, and that the place of proceeding would be
Washington D.C. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out a provisional timetable for

the arbitration.

On 11 July 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 concerning revisions to the

procedural calendar applicable to the arbitration.

5 October 2019, with Annexes 1-5 and supporting documents BK-0001 to BK-0042.

On 15 November 2019, the Respondent filed a request to address its objections to
jurisdiction as a preliminary question (“Request for Bifurcation”) accompanied by
exhibit R-0001 and legal authorities RL-0001 to RL-0028. On 23 December 2019, the
Claimant filed observations on the Respondent’s Request for Bifurcation accompanied by

factual exhibits C-0275 to C-0276 and legal authorities CL-0161 to CL-0183.

On 17 January 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3. In its order, the Tribunal
decided to hear the Respondent’s DoB Objection in a preliminary phase on the basis of an
accelerated timetable, and invited the Parties to confer with respect to a proposed schedule

for accelerated determination of the bifurcated jurisdictional issue.

By emails of 25 January 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to the

Tribunal’s proposed schedule.

On 6 February 2020, the Tribunal confirmed that the DoB Objection would be decided
pursuant to the schedule agreed by the Parties, including 28-30 September 2020 as the

applicable dates for a hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue.

By letter of 13 February 2020, the Claimant requested the Tribunal to adopt certain
procedural measures aimed at promoting the efficiency of the proceeding. On 21 February

request of 13 February 2020.

On 31 March 2020, the Claimant submitted an application for the Tribunal to put into place
a confidentiality order. On 6 April 2020, the Respondent submitted observations on the
Claimant’s application. On 8 April 2020, the Claimant submitted a reply to the
Respondent’s observations of 6 April 2020. On 8 April 2020, the Tribunal issued

Procedural Order No. 5 concerning the Claimant’s application of 31 March 2020.

On 13 April 2020, the Claimant filed a Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction (“Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction”), with factual exhibits C-0277 to C-0348 and legal authorities
CL-0184 to CL-0202. The pleading was also accompanied by one witness statement
and one expert report, as follows: (i) Second Witness Statement of Michael M. Davies,
dated 10 April 2020; and (ii) Expert Report by Neill May of Goodmans LLP, dated
11 April 2020, with supporting documents NM-0001 to NM-0013.

the Tribunal to decide on production of documents. On 11 May 2020, the Tribunal issued

Procedural Order No. 6 concerning production of documents.

On 1 July 2020, the Respondent filed a Reply on Jurisdiction, with factual exhibits R-0044

On 4 August 2020, Canada provided written notice of its intention to file a written
submission as a non-disputing State Party by 14 August 2020 on questions of interpretation

of the Treaty.

On 7 August 2020, the Parties informed the Tribunal of their agreement to hold the hearing
on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue remotely by videoconference. On the same date, the
Tribunal took note of the Parties’ agreement and released 30 September 2020 from the list

of hearing dates.

On 11 August 2020, Canada notified the Parties and the Tribunal that it would exercise its
right to attend the hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue, as provided for under

Article 827(7) of the Treaty.

On 14 August 2020, Canada filed a written submission as a non-disputing State Party
pursuant to Article 827(2) of the Treaty (“Canada’s NDP Submission”).

On 11 September 2020, the Tribunal held a pre-hearing organizational meeting with the

Parties by telephone conference.

On 18 September 2020, the Claimant introduced a new legal authority to the record
as CL-0213.

On 21 September 2020, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 concerning the

organization of the hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue.

A hearing on the bifurcated jurisdictional issue was held remotely through the

On 5 October 2020, the Asociacién Mutual de Mineros “EL COGOTE?” filed an application
to intervene as a non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2), Article 831
and Annex 831 of the Treaty (the “El Cogote’s NDP Application”). On 13 October 2020,
the Parties jointly requested the Tribunal to defer its consideration of El Cogote’s NDP
Application until after the submission of the Respondent’s Counter-Memorial on all issues,
should the proceedings continue after the present jurisdictional phase. On 30 October 2020,
the Tribunal granted the Parties’ joint request to defer the decision on El Cogote’s NDP
Application, on the basis that several of the factors to be considered under ICSID
Arbitration Rule 37(2) would be better understood against the backdrop of both Parties’

first-round substantive pleadings.
On 29 October 2020, the Parties submitted agreed corrections to the Hearing transcripts.

On 23 and 24 October 2020 respectively, the Claimant and the Respondent filed statements
of costs. On 30 October 2020, each Party filed observations on the other Party’s statements

of costs.

Ill. PARTIES’ REQUESTS FOR RELIEF
43. In its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction, the Claimant requests that the Tribunal:

(a) dismiss Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction on the basis of
Article 814(2) of the FTA, (b) declare that Respondent breached
Article 814(2) through its purporting to deny benefits in
circumstances where the requirements of that Article were not met,
(c) proceed to hear the merits of the dispute and (d) reserve its
decision on costs for determination in the eventual award.

44. Inits Reply on Jurisdiction, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to:

... declare that the Respondent validly denied the benefits of
Chapter Eight of the FTA to the Claimant, and, accordingly, to
dismiss GCG’s claims for lack of jurisdiction.

... dismiss GCG’s claim pursuant to Article 1101 of the FTA,
including for lack of jurisdiction.

... order GCG to pay the Republic of Colombia all costs associated
with these proceedings, including arbitration costs and all
professional fees and disbursement, as well as the fees of the arbitral
tribunal, plus interest thereon.”

IV. SUMMARY OF THE PARTIES’ POSITIONS

45. In this section, the Parties’ main arguments with respect to the DoB Objection are presented
succinctly. The Tribunal emphasizes that it does not purport to set out all arguments
presented, much less all authorities and evidence cited in support of those arguments, and
the absence of reference to particular assertions or particular supporting material should
not be taken as an indication that the Tribunal did not consider those matters. The Tribunal

has carefully considered all points presented in connection with the DoB Objection.

46. The Parties’ arguments focus on three main issues: (1) the timeliness of Colombia’s denial

of benefits and the burden of proof; (2) the grounds for denial of benefits, namely,

"CL Rej., § 163.
2 Resp. Reply, 4 161-163.

(a) ownership and control of the Claimant and (b) whether the Claimant has substantial
business activities in Canada; and (3) the admissibility of the Claimant’s ancillary claim,
which the Claimant frames as a claim for breach of Article 814(2) of the FTA, but which

the Respondent characterizes as a claim pursuant to Article 1101 of the FTA.

A. The Respondent’s Position

47.

48.

49.

qd) Timing of Colombia’s denial of benefits and burden of proof

The Respondent’s DoB Objection is based on Article 814(2) of the Treaty, which provides

as follows:

Article 814: Denial of Benefits

A Party may deny the benefits of this Chapter to an investor of the
other Party that is an enterprise of such Party and to investments of
that investor if investors of a non-Party or of the denying Party own
or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no substantial
business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is
constituted or organized.

Before arguing that the conditions of Article 814(2) of the FTA are met, the Respondent

addresses two preliminary matters raised by the Claimant: (a) whether the denial of benefits

was timely, and (b) the burden of proving the requirements of Article 814(2) of the Treaty.

a. Timing of Colombia’s denial of benefits

The Respondent claims that, by letter of 31 May 2018,° it properly denied the benefits of
the FTA to the Claimant — including access to international arbitration — pursuant to
Article 814(2) of the Treaty.*

> Letter from the National Agency for the Legal Defense of the State (ANDJE) to Gran Colombia Gold Corp.
(L. Paredes Arenas), dated 31 May 2018 (R-0001).

4 Resp. Mem., 9] 5, 7, 13 and Resp. Reply, {ff 2, 38. According to the Respondent, the reference in Article 814(2) of
the FTA to the Contracting Parties’ right to deny “the benefits of this Chapter [i.e., Chapter Eight]” necessarily
includes, as among the benefits which may be denied, the right to submit a claim to arbitration under Section B of
Chapter Eight of the FTA. See Resp. Mem., {fj 6, 9 and Resp. Reply, § 3.

10

50. The Respondent submits that the denial of benefits was timely. In this regard, it requests
the Tribunal to dismiss the Claimant’s two main arguments to the contrary, namely: first,
that when Colombia denied the benefits of the FTA to the Claimant, GCG had completed
the process of submitting the dispute to arbitration by filing its Request for Arbitration to
ICSID on 25 May 2018, and, second, that the denial of benefits clause cannot apply

retroactively to an arbitration agreement that was already in effect as of 25 May 2018.°

51. First, the Respondent claims that, at the time Colombia denied the benefits of the FTA to
GCG on 31 May 2018, the Claimant had not yet completed the process of submitting the
dispute to ICSID. While the Request for Arbitration was filed electronically on
25 May 2018, Colombia was informed of the filing and received a copy of the Request on
30 May 2018. Moreover, ICSID did not register the case until 2 July 2018 (i.e., 32 days
after Colombia’s denial of benefits), after having requested certain clarifications and

obtained additional documentation from GCG.°

52. The Respondent adds that, even assuming, arguendo, that the Request for Arbitration was
validly filed on 25 May 2018, it still denied the benefits of the FTA to GCG at the earliest
possible time, merely one day after it received a copy of the Request for Arbitration. There
was no reason for Colombia to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA before then,
as it had been engaged in negotiations with GCG and could not be certain that GCG would

seek to invoke the benefits of the FTA until receiving GCG’s Request for Arbitration.”

53. Second, the Respondent claims that nothing in Article 814(2) of the Treaty imposes a
specific time limit for Colombia to deny the benefits of Chapter Eight. Among other
arguments, the Respondent claims that: (i) Article 814(2) should be interpreted according
to the ordinary meaning of its terms (which contain no time limit requirement), pursuant to
Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (“WCLT”); (ii) unlike other
treaties, the FTA does not require the State Party to give prior notification of the denial of

benefits, which shows that the State Parties to the FTA actively chose not to include any

5 Resp. Mem., {| 14.
© Resp. Mem., fj 15-17 and Resp. Reply, 42.
7 Resp. Mem., | 18 and Resp. Reply, ff 38-46.

requirements concerning the timing of the denial of benefits; (iii) the decisions the
Claimant cited in support of its arguments regarding timeliness concern the application of
a different treaty and are inapposite; and, in contrast, (iv) other tribunals have found that
there is no justification for imposing any time limits not expressly included in the wording

of denial of benefits clauses.*

54. In addition, the Respondent argues that it would be unworkable to impose upon Colombia
a requirement to deny the benefits of the FTA prior to the submission of any particular
dispute to arbitration, as it could not practically or reasonably be expected to investigate
and issue denial of benefits notices to all potential foreign investors who may fall within
the scope of Article 814(2). The Respondent further rejects the Claimant’s contention that
GCG’s Notice of Intent implied that it would invoke the benefits of the Treaty. It stresses
that the purpose of such notification is the amicable settlement of claims against the State.
Also, in this case, there was uncertainty as to whether GCG would resort to arbitration
since the Parties extended their negotiation period and the Request for Arbitration was filed

several months after the negotiations ended.?

55. Finally, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s assertion that a presumption of non-
retroactivity of a denial of benefits results from Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention.
The Respondent argues that denial of benefits clauses form part of the investment
protection offered by host States, essentially as a condition on which any consent is
predicated, and therefore the invocation of this condition cannot be characterized as a
withdrawal of consent. The Respondent further argues that a general presumption of non-
retroactivity based on a provision of the ICSID Convention that concerns only one of many
advantages that a State could deny under Article 814(2) would be unreasonable, and the
Claimant’s argument that Article 28 of the VCLT codifies a presumption of non-
retroactivity is unsustainable, since that provision simply delimits the temporal scope of

Colombia’s obligations, not the Claimant’s rights or obligations. !°

b. Burden of proof

The Respondent considers that the Claimant’s characterization of the principle onus
probandi incumbit actori, to support its contention that the Respondent bears the burden
of proving the justification in fact and law for the DoB Objection, is simplistic, selective
and incomplete as a matter of international law, as it ignores that the Claimant bears the

burden to rebut the evidence Colombia presents. !!

In this regard, the Respondent asserts that the decisions on which the Claimant relies
expressly refer to both parties’ obligation to cooperate in the provision of evidence.
Moreover, the ICSID Rules underline the tribunal’s discretion to freely assess the evidence

presented by the parties. !7

Accordingly, the Respondent concludes that the Claimant has a burden to cooperate and
assist the Tribunal in establishing the relevant facts, and the Tribunal is free to rely on the
evidence provided by the Respondent and to draw adverse inferences from the Claimant’s

lack of cooperation. °

(2) Grounds for Denial of Benefits

Article 814(2) of the Treaty grants State Parties the right to deny the advantages of Chapter
Eight of the FTA to investors which are owned or controlled by nationals of the denying
State Party or of third States, and which have no substantial business activities in their State
of incorporation. As summarized below, the Respondent claims that the grounds for denial
of benefits are met in this case since GCG (a) is owned or controlled by non-Canadians,

and (b) has no substantial business activities in Canada, its State of incorporation. '*

As a preliminary matter, the Respondent submits that the requirements of Article 814(2) of
the FTA were satisfied in this case at the time GCG claimed the benefits of the Treaty,
regardless of whether such date is considered to be 2 July 2018 (the date on which ICSID

registered this case), as the Respondent maintains, or 25 May 2018 (the date of GCG’s

initial filing of its Request for Arbitration), as the Claimant maintains. '°

a. Ownership and control of the Claimant

The Respondent first refers to (i) the applicable standard, and then proceeds to submit that
GCG was neither (ii) owned by nationals of Canada, nor (iii) controlled by nationals of

Canada, on any of the potentially applicable critical dates.

First, with regard to the applicable standard, the Respondent argues that: the requirements

16

of “ownership” and “control” are alternative requirements;'° such requirements must be

assessed by reference to ultimate ownership and control of GCG and not merely to nominal

7 and relevant factors to

ownership or formal control by virtue of direct shareholding;!
determine de facto control include financial interest in the investment, the ability to
exercise substantial influence over the investment’s management and operation and the
selection of board members, and the fact of serving as a consistent driving force behind

the company. !*

In addition, the Respondent considers the Claimant’s suggestion that “ownership” of the
enterprise must be exercised by a single investor to be unsupported by the wording of
Article 814(2) of the FTA (which expressly refers to ownership and control exercised by
“investors”), and incompatible with the Treaty’s broad definition of “enterprise” in Article
106 and the principle of effet utile. The concepts of both ownership and control must be
interpreted broadly, the Respondent says, to include indirect and beneficial ownership and
indirect and de facto control. This is necessary to accord meaning and effectiveness to the
underlying purpose of denial of benefits clauses, which exist to safeguard against the use

of nationalities of convenience to take advantage of the FTA’s protections. !°

Further, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s assessment of control based on Canadian
corporate and securities law. Instead, it argues that the existence of control should be
assessed on a case-by-case basis (absent a definition of “control” in the FTA) and remains

a matter of international law and not national law.”°

Second, the Respondent claims that GCG is not owned by nationals of Canada. It argues
that, at the time GCG claimed the benefits of the Treaty, Canadian nationals did not own
the majority of GCG’s shares. The Respondent bases its analysis of GCG’s ownership on

public corporate documents issued prior to 25 May and 2 July 2018.7!

The Respondent submits that, while GCG did not have any individual shareholders
who owned shares carrying more than 10% of the attached voting rights as of 4 May 2018,
publicly available information establishes that “almost all of GCG’s publicly known
shareholders were not Canadian nationals.””? The Respondent’s evidence in this regard

includes:?3

e a Management Information Circular of GCG dated 4 May 2018, which identifies
six shareholders, each holding between 0.001% and 3.89% of shares in GCG;

e an Alternative Monthly Report of GCG dated 5 June 2018, which shows that
GCG’s shareholding structure remained largely the same between 25 May and

2 July 2018;

e publicly available sources demonstrating that the six shareholders identified are
nationals or companies incorporated under the laws of the British Virgin Islands,
Colombia, Cuba, Italy, the United States of America, and Venezuela, and do not

appear to be Canadian nationals; and

e reports from the Canadian System for Electronic Disclosure by Insiders which

identify other GCG shareholders that are not Canadian.

In addition, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s reliance on shareholding information
which post-dates 2 July 2018, deeming this irrelevant for purposes of the DoB Objection.”*
It further opposes the Claimant’s assertion that, as of 30 May 2018, 99.632% of GCG’s
shares were registered in the name of a Canadian securities depository. It considers that the
Claimant’s argument fails because it focuses on direct (formal) ownership as opposed
to beneficial ownership. In this case, it is undisputed that GCG has a myriad of

beneficial owners.”°

The Respondent concludes that GCG had 11 known shareholders as of 25 May and
2 July 2018, out of which 9 were nationals of Colombia or a third State and held at least
11.731% of GCG’s outstanding shares. Beyond such information, which is publicly
available, GCG has not provided a more detailed breakdown of the nationality of its
beneficial shareholders as of the relevant dates. In other words, GCG has failed to rebut
Respondent’s prima facie case regarding beneficial ownership made on the available
evidence. Therefore, according to the available evidence, the Tribunal should find that

GCG was not owned by Canadian nationals at the time it invoked the benefits of the FTA.7°

Third, the Respondent claims that GCG is not controlled by nationals of Canada. Instead,
the Claimant is controlled by GCG’s two founders, Messrs. Iacono (an Italian citizen who
obtained Colombian nationality in 2010) and de la Campa (a citizen of Venezuela and
Cuba, who likewise obtained Colombian nationality in 2010).2”

The Respondent submits that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa founded GCG in 2010
through a so-called “Reverse Takeover,” which allowed GCG’s predecessor,
Gran Colombia Gold S.A. (“GCG Panama”), a Panamanian entity, to take over Tapestry

Resources Corp.’s (“Tapestry”) corporate position as a Canadian public company.”*

The Respondent adds that GCG Panama’s registry office was in Colombia and its business
activity had a primary emphasis on Colombia, while Tapestry served as a shell company

for GCG Panama’s Colombian activities.”?

The Respondent claims that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa control the Claimant based,
inter alia, on the following: they exercise substantial influence over the management and
operation of GCG in their capacity of directors of the company (and their ability to control
GCG is recognized in GCG’s corporate documents); Mr. Iacono is “the public face of
GCG,” regularly referenced in the company’s press statements in his capacity as its Co-
Chairman; and Mr. Iacono has publicly acknowledged that he and Mr. de la Campa share

a working relationship with members of GCG’s management far beyond GCG’s lifespan.*°

Moreover, the Respondent relies on GCG’s documents to assert that at the time GCG
invoked the benefits of the FTA, there was no Canadian majority in GCG’s Board

of Directors.*!

Finally, the Respondent criticizes the Claimant’s lack of cooperation in establishing the
relevant facts concerning the precise role of Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa within GCG,

as well as its lack of an alternative case as to whom controls GCG.*?

b. Claimant’s business activities in Canada

The Respondent first refers to (i) the applicable legal standard, and then submits that

(ii) GCG does not have substantial business activities in Canada.

First, the Respondent argues that the phrase “substantial business activities” implies that
the investor must not be a shell company. Instead, its activities should go beyond the
normal functions required merely by the fact of its corporate existence. Tribunals should
therefore focus on “the genuineness of the business,” that is, whether the activities in the

home State are both real and “material.” In conducting this materiality analysis, the

Respondent contends, tribunals must take into account the nature of the business at issue,

and assess the existence of substantial activities on a case-by-case basis.*?

Moreover, the Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 814(2) of the FTA, the
company not only must have substantial activities, but must locate those substantial
activities in the territory where the enterprise is organized.** In considering the /ocus of a
company’s substantial activities, the Respondent contends, it is important to distinguish
mining enterprises (which is what GCG publicly contends it is) from investment or holding
companies, which were at issue in the cases on which the Claimant relies, and which the

Respondent for that reason considers inapposite.*°

Second, the Respondent claims that GCG did not have any substantial business activities
in Canada at the time it invoked the benefits of the Treaty. It argues that: GCG’s public
filings state that substantially all of its assets are located outside of Canada; GCG’s
documents confirm that it has a primary emphasis on acquiring and developing properties
in Colombia, with no identified projects in Canada; GCG’s directors and management
appear to be located outside of Canada; GCG had an insignificant number of employees in
Canada (less than 10, in contrast to more than 2,000 in Colombia); and GCG does not
appear to undertake any material or recurrent activities at either its head office (where the
entrance does not have GCG’s name, logo or any other signs of corporate activity) or its

registered office (where GCG’s name does not appear in the list of tenants).*°

As further evidence that GCG did not conduct any substantial activities in Canada, the
Respondent mentions that: GCG acknowledged that it undertook mining operations only
in countries other than Canada; GCG’s key functions in Canada, as identified by the
Claimant, relate only to the maintenance of its status as a publicly-traded company and are

unrelated to mining activities; GCG’s fundraising and investing activities were mainly

targeted towards servicing debt, not financing mining operations; and GCG has failed to

identify any mining-related premises in Canada.*’

79. In its Reply, the Respondent rejects the Claimant’s argument that GCG is an investment
management company (as opposed to a gold and silver exploration and development
company), and therefore only must demonstrate substantial activities in Canada related to
services of investment management. The Respondent finds such argument contrary to
GCG’s representations to investors and the public. Rather, the Respondent asserts, this is
a case brought by a company which regularly described itself as a gold and silver
exploration, development and production company but did not undertake any substantial
activities in Canada with regard to its core mining business at the time it invoked the

benefits of the Treaty.**

80. Based on the above, the Respondent requests the Tribunal to rule that Colombia properly
invoked the denial of benefits provision of the FTA, and accordingly that the Tribunal lacks

jurisdiction over GCG’s claims in this case.

(3) The Claimant’s Ancillary Claim under Article 1101 of the FTA

81. The Respondent asks the Tribunal to declare that it does not have jurisdiction with regard
to the new claim presented for the first time in the Claimant’s Counter-Memorial on
Jurisdiction, which the Respondent characterizes as a claim regarding Article 1101 of

the FTA.”

82. The Respondent argues that Claimant’s new claim must be rejected because: (i) it is not
incidental or additional to the claims contained in GCG’s Request for Arbitration or its
Memorial, but constitutes an entirely new claim; and (ii) it does not meet the requirement
of ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, according to which ancillary claims must be within the scope
of the consent of the parties and within the jurisdiction of the Centre. Regarding this latter
argument, the Respondent submits that GCG may not invoke Article 1101 of the FTA,

because Chapter Eleven of the FTA as a whole concerns investments in financial

institutions, which does not apply to GCG. Moreover, the Respondent contends, the
provisions of Chapter Eleven of the FTA fall outside the categories of claims that investors
of a party may submit to arbitration under Section B of Chapter Eight of the Treaty.
To adjudicate claims based on Chapter Eleven of the FTA, the Claimant would have to

initiate dispute resolution pursuant to Article 1101(2)(b) of the Treaty.*°

qd) Timing of Colombia’s denial of benefits and burden of proof

The Claimant submits that the alleged denial of benefits was untimely and that the

Respondent has not met its burden of proof concerning the DoB Objection.

a. Timing of Colombia’s denial of benefits

The Claimant asserts that Colombia’s effort to deny benefits to GCG was untimely based
on two main grounds: (i) consent to ICSID arbitration was perfected prior to Colombia’s
supposed denial of benefits; and (ii) the denial of benefits clause cannot operate

retroactively.*!

First, the Claimant asserts that Colombia’s consent was perfected prior to its purported
denial of benefits and may not be unilaterally withdrawn.*? The Claimant states that
Colombia provided advance consent to the submission of claims to arbitration under
Article 823 of the FTA on 15 August 2011 (the date of the FTA’s entry into force). GCG
in turn gave its consent when it submitted its claim to arbitration on 25 May 2018
(i.e., when its Request for Arbitration was received by the ICSID Secretary-General
pursuant to Article 822(4) of the Treaty). Accordingly, consent to ICSID arbitration was
perfected on 25 May 2018.** The Claimant also highlights the interplay between Articles
823(2) and 822(4) of the Treaty and Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, which provides

that once consent has been given, no party may withdraw its consent unilaterally.*

Therefore, since the Respondent purported to deny benefits after consent to ICSID
arbitration was perfected, its letter of 31 May 2018 can have no impact on the Tribunal’s

jurisdiction.*

In this regard, the Claimant also points out that denial of benefits is not included among
the conditions to consent set out in Article 821 of the FTA regarding conditions precedent
to arbitration and, accordingly, Article 823 of the Treaty does not make the Parties’ consent

subject to a subsequent denial of benefits.*°

According to the Claimant, none of the Respondent’s arguments to the contrary has merit.*
For instance, it dismisses the Respondent’s assertion that consent was perfected only upon
ICSID’s registration of the case, based on the clear terms of Article 822(4) of the FTA and
the fact that ICSID’s screening process of requests for arbitration mean that there is always

a delay between the receipt of the request and its registration.**

Second, the Claimant argues that nothing in the text, the context or the object of the FTA
suggests that the denial of benefits clause may have retroactive effects.*? For instance,
Article 814(2) contains no wording to the effect that a denial of benefits has retrospective
effects. Regarding context, other provisions of the FTA (including Articles 2114 and 2115)
also deal with adjustment of benefits and the mechanisms in those articles are prospective
only.*° The Claimant further refers to the general principle of non-retroactivity of treaty
provisions codified in Article 28 of the VCLT (and applied in a number of international
proceedings) to conclude that the absence of a stated retroactive effect signals an intent for

the treaty to apply prospectively.*!

Moreover, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s argument that the Treaty imposes no time

limit on denial of benefits decisions. GCG argues that “the real issue is not whether

o

Article 814(2) applies retroactively, but whether a decision to deny benefits under the

authority of that Article has retroactive effect.”*

In addition, the Claimant argues that the six months’ advance notice period, in the form of
a notice of intent, that Article 821(2)(c) of the FTA requires before a claim may be
submitted to arbitration, constitutes sufficient time for a State to consider whether denial
of benefits is warranted. In the Claimant’s view, it also shows the Contracting Parties
understood that after submission to ICSID arbitration, the consent given could not be
withdrawn. In this case, there was a period of almost one year and a half (16 months) after
GCG’s Notice of Intent, and before arbitration was commenced, during which Colombia
could have denied the benefits of the Treaty to GCG.*? Certainly, the Claimant points out,
the terms of the Notice of Intent and of the letter declaring the Parties’ negotiations
unsuccessful showed no uncertainty regarding GCG’s reliance on its rights under the FTA,

including the right to resort to arbitration.*4

Finally, the Claimant submits that the Respondent’s reliance on cases dealing with treaties
lacking equivalent notice provisions is misplaced and that its remaining authorities

are inapposite.*>

b. Burden of proof

. The Claimant refers to the principle of international law that each party has the burden of

proving the facts on which it relies (onus probandi incumbit actori) to observe that
Colombia, as the State party raising objections to jurisdiction, “bears the burden of proving
the justification in fact and law for its purported denial of benefits.”*° The Claimant argues

that the Respondent has not met such burden of proof.

. In its Rejoinder, the Claimant addresses the issue of burden of proof as part of its analysis

of one of the grounds for denial of benefits (alleged control by non-Canadians), as it

considers that there is no evidentiary dispute (only a legal dispute) between the Parties
concerning the second requirement of denial of benefits (alleged lack of substantial
business activities in Canada).*” In that context, the Claimant relies on the Apotex case to
distinguish “between the legal burden of proof (which never shifts) and the evidential
burden of proof (which can shift from one party to another, depending upon the state of the
evidence).”°* It adds that the party on whom the burden rests must present prima facie
evidence that proves this proposition for the evidential burden to shift. However, in this

case, for the reasons identified below, Colombia has not satisfied that threshold.*°

. Finally, the Claimant refutes the Respondent’s suggestion that the relevant evidence is

uniquely within GCG’s control. It asserts that the legal issue is whether the facts relied
upon by Colombia as a basis to deny benefits under the Treaty supported that decision.
Therefore, it is incumbent upon Colombia to provide the basis for its attempted denial of

benefits in May of 2018.°

(2) Grounds for Denial of Benefits

As summarized below, the Claimant submits that the DoB Objection should be rejected
because Colombia has failed to prove that GCG (a) is owned or controlled by non-nationals

of Canada and (b) has substantial business activities in Canada, its State of incorporation.

As a preliminary matter, the Claimant submits that the two requirements of Article 814(2)
of the FTA are cumulative and the Respondent therefore must prove both requirements in
this case.°! In the Claimant’s view, neither of these requirements of Article 814(2) of the
FTA was satisfied on the relevant date, regardless of whether such date is considered to be

(the date of the Respondent’s alleged denial of benefits), or — as the Respondent maintains

—2 July 2018 (the date on which ICSID registered this case).

a. Ownership and control of the Claimant

97. The Claimant first refers to (i) the applicable standard, and then proceeds to submit that

GCG is (ii) owned by nationals of Canada, and (iii) controlled by nationals of Canada.

98. First, regarding the applicable standard, the Claimant refers to the definitions of the terms
“investor of a Party” and “investment of an investor of a Party,” contained in Article 838
of the FTA, to argue that the definition of the latter term in the FTA’s Spanish version
shows that ownership concerns direct legal title (not indirect or ultimate beneficial

ownership), while control by contrast deals with either direct or indirect authority.

99. Moreover, the Claimant refers to the definition of the term “enterprise” in Article 106 of
the FTA, as “enterprise” is the object of the verb “own or control” in Article 814(2). It finds
that some of the forms of entity mentioned in that definition (e.g., “sole proprietorship”)
are capable of being owned by a single person. According to the ordinary meaning of the
terms, owning an enterprise may encompass a situation where an investor owns all of the
corporation’s shares, whereas controlling an enterprise implies shareholding or contractual
rights which accord a decisive power over the company’s future.“ Therefore, the Claimant
concludes, “for Colombia to prove that [an] investor of other than Canada ‘owns’ GCG,
it must show that such an investor owns all of Claimant GCG’s outstanding shares.”°>

Accordingly, the Claimant rejects the Respondent’s allegation that an investor may own an

enterprise even if the investor owns only a part of it.©°

100. Concerning the legal standard applicable to the issue of control, the Claimant argues that:
an investor may exercise control through either the legal capacity to control the enterprise

or de facto control; tribunals have required compelling evidence to support an allegation

N

of de facto control; while the content of “control” in the Treaty is a matter of international
law, the Tribunal may be assisted by Canadian securities law in applying that term to a
public Canadian company such as GCG, and such law contains a rebuttable presumption
of control where holders may exercise direction over 20% or more of a class of securities;
and the reference to “investors” in Article 814(2) of the FTA, read jointly with
Article 808(2), suggests that control over the enterprise must be exercised in the capacity

of an investor (not merely through separate functions as an employee, officer or director).

Second, the Claimant submits that no single shareholder owns GCG. However, the owner
of substantially all of GCG’s shares is Clearing and Depository Services Inc. (“CDS”), a
Canadian company. The Claimant refers to the British Columbia Business Corporations
Act, which requires corporations to maintain a central securities register listing the owners
of shares in companies governed by that Act. Such register shows that, in May 2018, there
was no single owner of the entirety of GCG’s outstanding shares, and indeed 90 separate
owners of shares in GCG, but ownership was dominated by CDS, which owned more than
99% of GCG’s outstanding shares. Accordingly, the Claimant argues that pursuant to

Canadian law, the legal owner of nearly all of GCG’s shares is Canadian.

In addition, the Claimant argues that, while Canadian corporate and securities law
recognizes the concept of beneficial owners of shares, these are not registered owners of
shares. As the Treaty’s reference to ownership concerns legal title, beneficial ownership is
not pertinent to the question of who holds legal title of the shares.”” In any event, the
identity of all of GCG’s beneficial owners is not ascertainable, except for a limited class of
beneficial owners who have provided permission for their identities to be disclosed (the
so-called Non-Objecting Beneficial Owners or “NOBOs”). Focusing therefore on the
limited information that exists concerning the NOBOs, the records show nearly 1,900

beneficial owners, representing about 17% of GCG’s outstanding shares as of May 2018,

97% of whom were Canadian residents. Hence, no beneficial owner could be viewed as

“owning” GCG.”!

103. The Claimant also rejects the Respondent’s contention that a majority of GCG’s shares
were not owned by Canadian nationals on May 2018. It argues in this regard that:
Respondent’s argument is based on shares beneficially owned by individuals who, in the
aggregate, account for less than 12% of GCG’s outstanding shares in May 2018; the
argument fails as a matter of law because that 12% of shares does not meet the legal
threshold of ownership (i.e., ownership of all the outstanding shares of an enterprise); the
Respondent prima facie fails to identify a non-Canadian who can be said to “own” GCG;
and the wording of the FTA does not support the Respondent’s proposed interpretation that
ownership includes indirect and beneficial ownership. Accordingly, the Respondent has

failed to prove that investors of a third State owned GCG at the relevant times.”

104. Third, the Claimant asserts that, at all relevant times, no single shareholder controlled
GCG.” The Claimant notes that CDS owns shares to allow financial intermediaries to
participate in the CDS registry system and, in turn, those intermediaries held the shares for
a wide share of beneficial owners. The record of this case does not establish any beneficial
owner of GCG’s shares of any nationality having a controlling interest in GCG
(i.e., carrying more than 10% of the voting rights attached to the outstanding common
shares). Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa, for instance, collectively controlled only 5.79%
of GCG’s shares, which does not constitute a controlling interest by any objective

standards.”

105. The Claimant therefore rejects the Respondent’s contentions concerning GCG’s alleged
control by non-Canadians.”° It argues in this regard that: the Respondent’s allegation that

serve at the pleasure of) the company’s shareholders;”° the 2018 Management Information
Circular to which the Respondent refers recognizes that, as of the date of that circular,
Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa did not hold a controlling combination of shares;”” and
the fact that Messrs. Iacono and de la Campa are not Canadian does not strip GCG of its
Canadian nationality.’* Also, the Respondent’s allegation that Messrs. Iacono and de la
Campa exercise substantial influence over GCG because they have been directors of the
company since 2010 fails both as a matter of law and evidence, since the activities the
Respondent identifies as demonstrating the extent of their influence are simply within the

directors/officers’ scope of work.”

Moreover, the Claimant notes that, while it is correct that GCG historically was the result
of a reverse takeover, that 2010 transaction is not pertinent to the issue of control in 2018.°°
The Claimant also asserts that it is irrelevant whether a majority of GCG’s Directors are
Canadian, for purposes of determining control. Finally, the Claimant observes that the
absence of a controlling beneficial owner in a public Canadian company is not an unusual

scenario, nor is it evidence of non-Canadian control.*!

b. Claimant’s business activities in Canada

The Claimant first refers to (i) the applicable legal standard, and then submits that

(ii) GCG has substantial business activities in Canada.

First, with regard to the applicable standard, the Claimant argues that, as the Respondent
acknowledges, the terms “substantial business activities” in Article 814(2) of the FTA
imply that the investor must not be a shell company; a contrario sensu, the Claimant notes,

an enterprise with any business activity of substance may not be denied benefits.*”

109. In this regard, the Claimant relies on prior cases in which tribunals have found that: the
“substantial business activities” test is met where the record shows at least a relatively
small number of activities in terms of quantity and quality (i.e., “substantial” relates to the
materiality, not the magnitude, of the business activity), and is dependent on the nature of
the business; funding sourced through financial markets in the country in which an
enterprise is incorporated constitutes proof of a genuine connection to that country; and in
one prior case, the tribunal considered that the “substantial business activities” test was
satisfied by an investor’s status as a holding company with substantial international assets

under its control.*

110. In addition, the Claimant submits that, contrary to the Respondent’s assertions, no tribunal
has ever applied a limitation of “substantial business activities” that is focused on the sector
of activity performed,** such that (for example), a company involved in overseas mining
activities must also conduct mining in its country of incorporation in order to satisfy the

relevant Treaty test.

111.

Second, the Claimant submits that it conducts substantial activities in Canada. In this
regard, the Claimant mentions, inter alia, that GCG has raised over US$500 million in
Canada’s equity and debt markets over the past decade; pays millions of dollars every year
in Canada to Canadians for salaries, goods and services; and conducts some of its most

important corporate functions from Canada.**

112. The Claimant states that most of its key functions are performed out of its global
headquarters in Toronto (including accounting, shareholding relations, legal and
IT support), where it incurs expenses for office space rent, utilities and other costs related
to its local activities. The Claimant dismisses the Respondent’s photographs of the
premises, suggesting that they may depict the entrance in the brief period where renovation
works were underway, and presents pictures taken on March and April 2020 which are said

to accurately depict GCG’s global headquarters since October 2017.°° Moreover, GCG

employs eight full-time employees at its global headquarters in Toronto, to whom it paid
compensation exceeding CAD$ 1 million in 2018 alone; it incurs expenses for legal
services in Canada; and it contracts professional services in Canada on an as-needed basis,
including accounting and tax related services. In addition, in or about May 2018, GCG held

six bank accounts in Canada with accounts holding assets in excess of US$25,500,000.°”

113. The Claimant notes that it raises the financial resources for GCG’s global operations on
the Canadian capital markets and lists some of its most significant fundraising and
investment transactions in Canada. It further notes that these transactions entailed millions
spent on professional services from Canadian advisors and bankers, and that all securities
issued by GCG trade on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Moreover, the Claimant stresses that
GCG’s shareholder and investor relations activities are performed in Canada, including the
organization of the annual general and special meetings of GCG’s shareholders in Toronto,
the publication of official documents, press releases, social media communications, among

other activities.**

114. The Claimant rejects the Respondent’s contentions concerning the alleged non-substantial
activities of GCG in Canada. Among other arguments, the Claimant submits the following:
GCG had material assets in Canada in May 2018, including bank accounts (and even if it
did not, it would still meet the “substantial business activities” test given its standing as a
holding company with substantial international assets); the question of whether GCG’s
primary emphasis for mining operations in 2018 was Colombia is unrelated to whether
GCG nonetheless had substantial business activities in Canada; and Respondent’s
argument that some of GCG’s directors and management appear to be located outside
Canada is irrelevant, as the presence of even a small number of full-time employees in

Canada is sufficient to establish substantial business activities.*°

115. Finally, the Claimant considers as legally misplaced the Respondent’s observation that

GCG did not prove it conducted any mining operations activities in Canada. According to

*7 CL. C-Mem., 9 50-54 and Cl. Rej., J 21.

a

the Claimant, Article 814(2) requires the Respondent to show that GCG has “no substantial
business activities” in Canada, but does not limit the inquiry about business activities to a
particular type or sector of activities.°° Similarly, because the focus of a denial of benefits
inquiry is on the activities of the investor (the Canadian entity) on a standalone basis, the
activities of other operational companies (i.e., mining operating companies) that GCG

owns and controls are not pertinent for the DoB Objection.*!

In sum, given that the record shows substantial business activities of GCG in Canada, that
the Claimant’s shares are largely owned by a Canadian company and the fact that it has no
controlling investor, the Claimant requests the Tribunal to reject the DoB Objection and

resume the proceedings on the merits.°*

(3) Claimant’s Ancillary Claim under Article 1101 of the FTA

In its Counter-Memorial, the Claimant refers to Article 1101 of Chapter Eleven of the
Treaty regarding financial services, which incorporates by reference Section B of Chapter
Eight (Investment - Settlement Of Disputes Between An Investor And The Host Party) for
claims that a Party has breached, inter alia, Article 814 of the FTA regarding denial of
benefits.°? The Claimant contends that this reference demonstrates the possibility of

bringing a substantive claim under the FTA for alleged breach of Article 814.

The Claimant submits that “out of an abundance of caution,” it therefore presents an
incidental claim under ICSID Arbitration Rule 40, alleging that Colombia has breached
Article 814(2) of the FTA by means of its unfounded denial of benefits to GCG.
The Claimant adds that this incidental claim is within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction as it
arises directly out of the subject matter of the dispute and falls within the scope of the

Parties’ consent.”

Vv. CANADA’S NON-DISPUTING PARTY SUBMISSION

119. Canada’s non-disputing party submission focuses on three main issues: (1) general
observations concerning Article 814 of the Treaty; (2) burden of proof and timing of a

denial of benefits under Article 814(2); and (3) the grounds for denial of benefits.

120. First, as a preliminary matter, Canada states that Article 814 of the Treaty must be
understood by reference to the Contracting Parties’ objectives set out in the Treaty’s
preamble (including the stimulation of mutually beneficial business activity and the
strengthening of friendly relations between the Contracting Parties). The denial of benefits
provision allows a Contracting Party to deny the benefits of the FTA if the objectives of
the Treaty would not be advanced, such as where investors are enterprises with no real
economic link or ties with the country in which they are constituted or organized. This
prevents enterprises of non-Parties or of the denying Party from gaining access to treaty

protection simply through incorporation in the jurisdiction of a Contracting Party.°

121. Second, with regard to burden of proof, Canada submits that a claimant must meet its
burden of establishing that it satisfies the definition of “investor of a Party” and of
“investment of an investor of a Party” under Article 838 of the Treaty. If so, then the burden
is on the party wishing to invoke the denial of benefits provision to establish that the
conditions to deny benefits are met. A tribunal may take into account all evidence before
it to determine whether the conditions to deny benefits under the Treaty are met, including
evidence submitted by either disputing party. As to the consequences of a proper invocation
of Article 814(2), Canada states that the investor of the other Contracting Party will not be
entitled to treaty protection and a tribunal will not have jurisdiction over claims of breach

of the treaty obligations.”°

122. Concerning the timing of a denial of benefits, Canada notes that the FTA does not contain
any time limitation to invoke the denial of benefits provision, nor any restriction precluding
a Contracting Party from invoking this provision after a claim has been submitted to

arbitration. It refers to rulings of arbitral tribunals that have invoked a similar absence of

°5 Canada’s NDP Submission, {4 5-9.
°6 Canada’s NDP Submission, {| 10-14.

31

any limiting language when interpreting comparable provisions in other agreements, and
argues that requiring States to invoke a denial of benefits before a claim is submitted to
arbitration would entail an unnecessary and untenable burden on the respondent State.
Accordingly, Canada submits that a State’s advance consent to arbitrate under the FTA is
limited by the denial of benefits provision, and that this provision can be invoked after the

submission of a claim.”

123. Third, Canada addresses the two grounds for denial of benefits, namely ownership or
control of the enterprise and whether the enterprise has substantial business activities in the

other party in which it is incorporated.

124. With respect to “ownership” or “control” under Article 814(2) of the FTA, Canada notes
that neither term is defined in the Treaty. Hence, these terms should be interpreted
according to Article 31 of the VCLT. Also, because there is no established definition of
those terms under international law, these concepts can derive meaning from domestic
corporate law. In Canada’s view, ownership of a corporation usually requires at a minimum
the ownership of a majority of the voting shares, while control of a corporation is a fact-
based inquiry that may extend beyond consideration of share ownership and must be

considered on a case-by-case basis.”*

125. Finally, concerning the existence of substantial business activities under Article 814(2) of
the FTA, Canada argues that such determination requires a fact-based analysis, as it will
depend on the circumstances of the case and a number of factors. It adds that the materiality
of the business activity is the key question to establish whether the enterprise has
real business operations creating an economic link to the other Party in which it is

incorporated.”

VI.

TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS

A. Timing of Colombia’s denial of benefits

126.

127.

The Tribunal begins with the uncontroversial proposition that pursuant to
VCLT Article 31(1), Article 814(2) of the FTA — like any other treaty provision — is to be
interpreted and applied in accordance with the “ordinary meaning” of its terms, in the
“context” in which they occur and in light of the Treaty’s “object and purpose.”!”° But in
assessing the terms of any particular treaty provision, it is relevant to consider not only
what they say, but equally what they do not say. Here, Article 814 of the FTA is entirely
silent with respect to any time frame within which a Contracting Party may invoke its
provisions to deny the benefits of the FTA’s Chapter Eight (on “Investment”) to an
enterprise of the other Contracting Party. The only conditions regulating such a denial of
benefits are non-temporal in nature, e.g., with respect to Article 814(2), that “investors of
a non-Party or of the denying Party own or control the enterprise and the enterprise has no

substantial business activities in the territory” where it is constituted or organized.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal would have great difficulty concluding that the FTA
implicitly contains an additional (temporal) limitation on the Contracting Parties’ exercise
of the right they expressly agreed to retain in Article 814, but without stating any such
limitation. States are free to grant reciprocal protections to investors through the
mechanism of investment treaties, but they are also free to condition such grants on
particular qualifying principles. Some such conditions are framed as absolute: for example,
that an investor must satisfy stated nationality requirements in order to qualify for treaty
benefits. Other conditions may be framed in terms of State discretion, allowing a State
Party to choose whether to invoke them, even if the requirements for doing so are met.
Article 814 falls in the latter category (“A Party may deny ...”): it permits, but does not
require, a State Party to invoke its terms with respect to a given investor and its investments.
In confirming that the State Parties thus have a choice with respect to denial of benefits, it
would have been easy for the Contracting Parties to specify a deadline by which such

choice must be made, in order to limit their mutual exercise of discretion. The fact that the

33

129.

Contracting Parties did not do so must be given considerable weight. In general, it is not
for arbitral tribunals, in interpreting the text of investment treaties, to read into such texts
additional requirements (either on States or on investors) that the State Parties have not

chosen to impose.

In this case, both the Claimant and the Respondent have offered arguments about the
potential practical consequences of each other’s position with respect to when States may
deny FTA benefits to investors under Article 814(2), coupled with object and purpose
arguments that are predicated on accepting the propositions about practical consequences.
For example, the Respondent argues that the Claimant’s approach — requiring any denial
of benefits to predate the filing of a request for arbitration — would impose an impossible
burden on States (which they could not have intended to assume) to investigate and
monitor, for all investors in their country with whom they have no dispute whatsoever,
potentially evolving facts regarding ownership and control or the extent of business
activities in their State of incorporation.!°! The Claimant responds that its reading would
not require any such sweeping monitoring program, because FTA Article 821.2(c) requires
any investor wishing to pursue an arbitration claim to provide at least six months’ advance
notice of its intent to do so, which should provide sufficient time for a State to make any
Article 814(2) determinations with regard to that specific investor. For its part, the
Claimant argues that the Respondent’s approach — allowing States to deny benefits even
after a case has been filed — would run counter to the FTA’s objective of providing investors
with predictability about available protections. The Respondent replies that any object and
purpose of predictability is ensured by investors understanding, in advance, that they must
organize their ownership, control and business activities in such a way as to meet the

minimal threshold for avoiding any issue of denial of benefits.

In the Tribunal’s view, there is little need to enter into this debate. States have a choice
whether to incorporate in their treaties express limits on when any denial of benefits must
be invoked. While it may be interesting to debate whether they should do so — which would

involve balancing a number of considerations — ultimately that is a policy question that is

101 Canada expresses similar concerns in its NDP Submission. See Canada’s NDP Submission, §j 17.

34

not for tribunals to resolve. Absent any evidence that particular States intended to impose
a particular limitation on a right which they granted or reserved in a particular treaty, it is

not within a tribunal’s remit to impose such an additional limitation.

130. For these reasons, the Tribunal declines the Claimant’s invitation to conclude that the
Contracting Parties to the FTA may invoke Article 814(2) to deny benefits to an investor
only up until the date the investor files its request for arbitration.'°? As Article 814(2)
contains no such temporal restriction, investors operating in Canada and Colombia must
understand, ex ante, that any protections otherwise offered to them in Chapter Eight of the
FTA (which includes both substantive protections and dispute resolution mechanisms) may
be subject to their ability to demonstrate that they meet the ownership or control and
substantial business activity requirements of that provision. This is little different from
understanding, ex ante, that they may eventually be called upon to substantiate their claims
of qualifying nationality, or their status as bona fide investors with qualifying investments,
or any other core jurisdictional requirements of the Treaty. Moreover, the fact that the FTA
effectively conditions Treaty protection on the Article 814(2) requirements — although
State Parties may choose whether or not to invoke the conditions in a particular case — does
not mean that the Treaty in that respect operates “retroactively,” or in contravention of
Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, as the Claimant contends.' It simply means that
by the terms of the FTA itself, investors are placed on notice in advance, from the time the

FTA entered into force, that they may face a risk of not being able to rely on the FTA’s

102 See Pac Rim Cayman LLC v. Republic of El Salvador, ICSID Case No. ARB/09/12, Decision on the Respondent’s
Jurisdictional Objections, 1 June 2012 (RL-0041) (“Pac Rim”), §| 4.85 (finding that such a limitation “could not be
justified on the wording of CAFTA Article 10.12.2,” which contained no stated time limit for denial of benefits);

“could have agreed” to preclude any denial of benefits after initiation of arbitration, but did “not ... do so.”).

103 See Pac Rim, J 4.90 (RL-0041) (concluding that a CAFTA Party’s “consent to ICSID arbitration ... is necessarily
qualified from the outset by [the denial of benefits clause],” and accordingly a denial of benefits invoked after an
ICSID arbitration commences “cannot be treated as the unilateral withdrawal of that Party’s consent to ICSID
arbitration under ICSID Article 25(1)”).

  

35

131.

132.

protections if they choose not to organize their activities in accordance with the standards

set forth in Article 814.'°*

Finally, while the FTA itself imposes no limitation on when States may invoke Article
814(2), the operative arbitration rules may well impose their own limitations. A State’s
well-grounded denial of benefits has the effect of denying jurisdiction to a claimant seeking
to rely on the substantive and dispute resolution provisions of Chapter Eight of the FTA;
as such, any objection to jurisdiction must be raised no later than permissible under the
applicable arbitration rules. In cases governed by the ICSID Convention and Arbitration
Rules, the applicable deadline for objecting to jurisdiction on any grounds is the date of a
respondent’s counter-memorial,'°> so that effectively becomes the deadline for any
enforceable denial of benefits. In this case, Colombia invoked Article 814(2) much earlier
than that — just one day after its receipt of the Claimant’s Request for Arbitration — so its

invocation was timely under the applicable rules.

The question therefore becomes simply whether Colombia’s invocation of Article 814(2)

was well-grounded in its substance. The Tribunal turns to that issue below.

B. Grounds for Denial of Benefits

133.

It is undisputed that States have the power to agree on the characteristics of investors to
whom to extend treaty protection — and provided their agreement is clear, tribunals are
obligated to honor that agreement. Here, the agreement between Canada and Colombia,
reflected in Article 814(2) of the FTA, is that either State may deny the benefits of FTA
Chapter Eight to an enterprise registered in the other State, if two cumulative conditions
are met: (a) the enterprise is not owned or controlled by nationals of its home State, and

(b) it has no substantial business activities in its home State. An enterprise which is unable

104 See Guaracachi, 49] 371-372 (RL-0012) (concluding that “the denial of benefits cannot be equated to the withdrawal
of prior arbitral consent ... . [T]he consent by the host State to arbitration itself is conditional and thus may be denied
by it, provided that certain objective requirements ... are fulfilled. All investors are aware of the possibility of such a
denial ....”); Ulysseas, Inc. v. The Republic of Ecuador, UNCITRAL, Interim Award, 28 September 2010 (RL-0038),
4 173 (noting that “the possibility for the host State to exercise the right in question is known to the investor from the

time when it made its ...

 

investment,” and “the protection afforded by the BIT” remains “subject ... to th[at]

possibility”).
5 ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(1) (CL-0036).

36

134.

135.

136.

to rebut even one of these showings — i.e., because it is neither owned nor controlled by
home State nationals, nor has any substantial business activities in its home State — cannot
assume entitlement to protection by the FTA. That is because the host State retains the right
on that basis to deny it the benefits of the Treaty. The enterprise in such circumstances
would only be able to claim Treaty benefits if the host State chooses not to exercise its

retained (but discretionary) right to deny benefits under Article 814(2).

Conversely, the host State has no right to deny benefits to the enterprise if only one of
Article 814(2)’s two cumulative conditions is met. As a result, an investor need
demonstrate only that it satisfies one of the relevant criteria, in order to defeat a putative

denial of benefits.

Accordingly, in this case, the issue of ownership and control of GCG, as a Canadian
registered company, becomes relevant only if GCG has no substantial business activities
in Canada — and equally, the extent of GCG’s business activities in Canada becomes
relevant only if the company is not owned or controlled by Canadian nationals. That reality
simplifies matters to a considerable degree. The Parties have raised interesting issues about
ownership and control of GCG, including how such matters are to be determined for a
publicly traded company whose shares are nominally owned by the CDS, but on behalf of
apparently diffuse beneficial owners whose identity is largely unavailable. The Parties also
have debated the extent of any de facto control that may be wielded by Messrs. Iacono and
de la Campa, and whether it is necessary for that inquiry to distinguish among the various
capacities in which they might exert influence, including as company founders, corporate
directors, or shareholders. Ultimately, however, the Tribunal need not decide any of these
interesting issues, because in any event, GCG satisfies the alternate prong of the
Article 814(2) inquiry, by virtue of having “substantial business activities” in Canada. The
latter conclusion flows both from analysis of the phrase “any substantial business
activities,” and from the facts that have been demonstrated about GCG’s various Canadian

activities.

Starting with the treaty text, Article 814(2) permits a denial of benefits if there are “no

substantial business activities in the territory of the Party under whose law it is constituted

37

137.

138.

or organized.” The word “no,” which qualifies “substantial business activities,” makes
clear that the inquiry is not about whether Canada is the jurisdiction with which GCG might
have the most substantial connections. Companies may have business activities in many
jurisdictions, including both the country in which they are registered and other countries in
which they choose to conduct operations. Article 814(2) does not require a comparative
analysis, weighing these various activities against each other to determine the single
jurisdiction in which the enterprise has its most extensive or dominant connections.
It simply requires that a Canadian-registered company have some substantial business

activity in Canada.

The next word in the treaty text, “substantial,” nonetheless provides an important
materiality threshold. A business activity may not be mere cursory, fleeting or incidental,
but must be of sufficient extent and meaning as to constitute a genuine connection by the
company to its home State. That genuine connection is necessary to ensure that the
company is one that the home State has an interest to protect, and which the host State
would consider it appropriate for the home State to protect. The connection between the
company and its home State cannot be merely a sham, with no business reality whatsoever,
other than an objective of maintaining its own corporate existence. That requirement is
reinforced by the last words in the treaty text, “business activities”; the activities of the
company in its State of registration must be of a “business” nature. If the company has no
activities in its home jurisdiction other than those required to maintain its bare registration,
then it is impossible to conclude that it is conducting any “business” there, in any real sense

of that word.

At the same time, while the company must have some real, material business activities in
its home State, the Treaty contains no limitations on the nature of that business. It certainly
does not require that the activities at home be of the same nature as those the company
conducts in other jurisdictions. Nothing in the Treaty suggests, for example, that a company
engaged overseas in natural resource exploration and development must conduct similar
resource exploration or development at home, in order to satisfy the requirement of having
substantial business activities there. It is entirely consistent with the Treaty text for such a

company to locate coordinating or support functions in its home State, or to use its home

38

State as a hub for investment and financing activities that make possible the operational
activities in other places. Either way, the activities in the home State must be examined on
their own merits — separate from the activities undertaken in other jurisdictions, including

by the company’s subsidiaries or affiliates!”

—to determine if they are of sufficient reality
and materiality as to satisfy the requirement that there be some “substantial business

activities” in the country of registration.

139. Here, that requirement is amply satisfied, on any of the dates possibly relevant for the
analysis. With respect to those dates, there has been no suggestion that the nature or
substantiality of GCG’s activities in Canada changed in any way between 25 May 2018
(the date it filed the Request for Arbitration), 31 May 2018 (the date Colombia invoked
Article 814(2) to deny FTA benefits), or 2 July 2018 (the date ICSID registered the case).
In these circumstances, the Tribunal sees no need to resolve in the abstract which of these
dates might be most critical for evaluating the effectiveness of Colombia’s denial of
benefits. The important point is that for this entire period, the record reflects, inter alia, the

following activities by GCG in Canada:

¢ Core corporate functions in Toronto: corporate finance, fundraising, accounting,
shareholder relations, legal, administration and IT support;!°”

¢ Office space: spending over US$100,000 on rent, utilities and related expenses
in 2018;

¢ Eight full-time employees in Toronto: In 2018, GCG spent over CAD$1.2 million in
Canada on compensation and benefits.”

106 See similarly Pac Rim, § 4.66 (RL-0041) (noting that the substantial business activities test “relates not to the
collective activities of a group of companies, but to activities attributable to the ‘enterprise’ itself...

depth and materiality to demonstrate a genuine and meaningful connection (and
contribution) to Canada. They are undoubtedly “business” in nature, even if the business
in question in Canada appears — as the Claimant contends — to be essentially investment
management and financing, to support a different type of business (mining operations)
conducted in Colombia by affiliated entities. The Tribunal is not persuaded by Colombia’s
argument that GCG must show mining activities within Canada, simply because its public-
facing statements focus on mining activities; as the Claimant reasonably explains, public-
facing statements often focus on the collective activities of a corporate group, including
overseas activities and not solely home office activities. This does not change the nature of
the Treaty inquiry, which is simply whether the Claimant entity — viewed on its own — has

any substantial business activities in Canada, in any business sector.

In this case, the record shows that GCG does. Its activities in Canada go well beyond that
which would be necessary for a “mailbox” or “shell” company to maintain its corporate
form. The Tribunal accordingly has no doubt that these activities (taken together) satisfy
the relevant criteria in Article 814(2), in order to render ineffective Colombia’s attempted

denial of benefits to GCG under the Treaty.

C. Admissibility of the Claimant’s Ancillary Claim

142. The Tribunal notes as a threshold matter that the Parties differ in their characterization of
the Claimant’s ancillary claim, with the Claimant framing it as one alleging breach of
Article 814(2) of the FTA,!!? and the Respondent characterizing it as one brought pursuant
to Article 1101 of the FTA.''* The first step in addressing the admissibility of any ancillary

claim is a determination of what claim in fact has been submitted.

143. In the Tribunal’s view, it is generally for the party submitting a claim to articulate what
claim it actually is pursuing. To the extent there was any ambiguity on this score in the
Claimant’s Counter-Memorial,''> the Claimant has now clarified its intention in its
Rejoinder, stating that “the claim presented is not one under Chapter Eleven of the FTA,
the financial services chapter. ... [T]he claim is one under Chapter Eight for breach of
Article 814(2).”!'® The Tribunal has no basis for disregarding this framing of the claim.
Indeed, it would be nonsensical to decide a proposition about the admissibility of a claim,

while ignoring the Claimant’s clarifications about what that claim actually is.

144. The Parties clearly differ about whether the FTA contemplates any affirmative claims for
a State’s unfounded denial of benefits, with the Claimant saying it does, and the
Respondent saying it does not. This appears to be an issue of first impression, and

ultimately, any tribunal resolving this debate would need to consider a number of issues.

113 See Cl. Rej., | 163 (requesting that the Tribunal “declare that Respondent breached Article 814(2) through its
purporting to deny benefits in circumstances where the requirements of that Article were not met”).

114 Resp. Reply, { 162 (requesting that the Tribunal “dismiss GCG’s claim pursuant to Article 1101 of the FTA,
including for lack of jurisdiction”).

115 See Cl. C-Mem., § 183 (stating that “GCG has observed that the Treaty itself contemplates an additional approach
to qualifying an unfounded denial of benefits,” and citing Article 1101 of the FTA as “incorporat[ing] into [Chapter
Eleven] by reference selected portions of the investment chapter (Chapter Eight),” including “for claims that a party
has breached Article [] ... 814 (Investment — Denial of Benefits”); id., {| 184 (“[t]he Treaty thus contemplates that an
appropriate remedy for a Party’s unfounded invocation of the denial-of-benefits provision is a claim by the investor
for breach of Article $14”); id., | 186 (“GCG therefore presents an incidental claim that Colombia has breached
Article 814(2) through its unfounded denial of benefits”).

16 Cl. Rej., | 159; see id., | 160 (stating that while Article 1101 is “instructive in that it expressly recognizes the
propriety of a claim ... for an unfounded denial of benefits under Article 814,” and “thus provides useful context for
such a claim,” “the claim asserted here is for breach of Article 814, not breach of Article 1101”).

41

Without prejudice to further briefing, the relevant questions would seem to include at least

the following:

a. Was Article 814 intended solely to create a defense for the Contracting
States (i.e., to deny benefits in certain circumstances), or also to create
substantive treaty obligations (i.c., not to deny benefits otherwise), which
might be capable of being breached and for which a claim might be brought?

b. To the extent Article 814 might create substantive obligations, what is the
applicable standard for breach? For example, is the provision breached any
time a State attempts to deny benefits, simply because that attempt is later
rejected by a tribunal? Or does the standard incorporate some element of
wrongfulness, which distinguishes between a bad faith invocation of Article
814 and a potentially mistaken but good faith invocation, based on the
State’s contemporaneous understanding or belief about an investor’s
ownership, control and substantial business activities?

c. For this question, should an analogy be made to the assertion of other
jurisdictional objections or merits defenses, which (even if unsuccessful),
generally are not considered to give rise to additional substantive treaty
breaches, or is a denial of benefits qualitatively different, such that an
unfounded denial would be an independent breach of a State’s obligations
to investors?

d. To the extent any breach were to be found, would it give rise to any claim
for relief other than a potential assessment of costs incurred in disputing a
denial of benefits, which already may be considered in the context of a
holistic costs determination at the end of an arbitration proceeding?

145. The Tribunal sees no need to engage now in any analysis of any of these questions, which
the Parties have not yet briefed in any detail. As discussed during the Hearing on
Jurisdiction, the only question properly before the Tribunal at this stage is whether the
Claimant’s new claim is admissible under Arbitration Rule 40.''’ The main purpose of
Arbitration Rule 40 is to regulate when new claims may be asserted in the context of an
ongoing proceeding, and alternatively when they may need to be pursued (if at all) through

the commencement of a separate proceeding.

146. Arbitration Rule 40(1), entitled “Ancillary Claims,” provides as follows:

117 Rey. Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 148:4-150:17 (answers by Mr. Legum and Mr. Adam, for the Claimant and the Respondent
respectively, to questions by the Tribunal President).

(1) Except as the parties otherwise agree, a party may present an incidental
or additional claim or counter-claim arising directly out of the subject-
matter of the dispute, provided that such ancillary claim is within the scope
of the consent of the parties and is otherwise within the jurisdiction of
the Centre.

(2) An incidental or additional claim shall be presented not later than in the
reply and a counter-claim no later than in the counter-memorial, unless the
Tribunal, upon justification by the party presenting the ancillary claim and
upon considering any objection of the other party, authorizes the
presentation of the claim at a later stage in the proceeding.

(3) The Tribunal shall fix a time limit within which the party against which
an ancillary claim is presented may file its observations thereon.
147. The three paragraphs of Rule 40 may be seen as addressing, respectively, the substantive,
temporal and procedural requirements of admissibility of an ancillary claim. The Tribunal

considers these requirements in turn below.

148. With regard to the substantive requirements, the admissibility of a new claim is governed
by the same regime whether the claim at issue is characterized as an “incidental” or an
“additional” claim. Although the two terms are not defined, their plain meaning carries
somewhat different connotations, with the word “incidental” generally connoting
“something that happens in connection with something else, as a minor consequence of or
an accompaniment to the other matter,” whereas the word “additional” does not on its own
terms necessarily require a connection to an existing event.''* Nonetheless, Arbitration
Rule 40 draws no distinction between incidental and additional claims, both of which are
deemed to be subsets of a broader concept, denominated as “ancillary claims.”!!° In both

instances, the applicable test is the same.

149. That test has two components. First, as a threshold matter, a Tribunal must consider under

Arbitration Rule 40(1) whether the new claim would “be within the scope of consent of the

parties and ... otherwise within the jurisdiction of the Centre.” The Tribunal does not
interpret this language as requiring — nor has either Party in this case suggested it requires
—“a mini-trial and decision on all potential jurisdictional objections in order to determine,
at the threshold stage, if an ancillary claim even may be admitted for examination.”!°
Rather, “[i]fthe same claim could have been admitted ... for further proceedings had it had
been included in an original request for arbitration, then [this] threshold admissibility
inquiry ... is likewise satisfied.”!?! Simply put, a tribunal may admit an ancillary claim for

consideration, while still permitting a respondent to raise jurisdictional objections as part

of its observations on that claim.

The second and more immediate requirement for admissibility under Arbitration Rule
40(1) is whether the incidental or additional claim “aris[es] directly out of the subject-
matter of the dispute.” For this purpose, the Tribunal considers that the subject matter of
the dispute cannot be defined strictly by the boundaries of the original legal claims, or the
test would become a tautology requiring that any new claims arise directly from prior
claims, which by definition any “additional” claim (as distinct from a purely “incidental”
claim) could never satisfy. For the test to have any meaning, “the dispute” must be defined
as having an objective subject matter that is broader than the original legal claims
themselves, so as to allow for the possibility of an “additional” claim that is distinct from
the prior claims, but still arises directly out of the same subject matter of the

general dispute.

This is entirely consistent with the framing of the unofficial commentary on the original
1968 ICSID Arbitration Rules, which queries whether adjudication of the ancillary claims
is necessary to “achieve the final settlement of the dispute,” as distinct from the final
settlement only of the original claims.!?? The commentary envisions that this will occur
only where there is a close “factual connection” between the original and ancillary claims,

but this does not mean that an ancillary claim cannot involve additional facts — simply that

any additional factual inquiry must have a sufficient connection to the matrix of facts
already present in the dispute before the tribunal. A factual connection is not the same as

an identity of facts.

On the other hand, the Tribunal does not accept that the “subject-matter of the dispute” can
be defined so expansively as to mean any and all harm to a particular investment, which
can be attributed to a given State under laws of international State responsibility. If one set
of official acts against a particular investment (say, by Actor A in Year B) has no real
factual connection to another set of official acts against that investment (say by Actor C in
Year D), the fact that the two entirely separate grievances independently caused harm to
the same investment would not necessarily mean that claims about the latter “aris[e]
directly out of the subject-matter of the dispute” initiated to resolve the former. This again
is why the Explanatory Note requires a sufficiently close “factual connection” between the
two sets of claims, which cannot be established simply by observing that the they both

involve the same investment and the same respondent State.

Applying these principles to the case at hand, the Tribunal considers that there is sufficient
linkage between the original claims and the proposed new claim to satisfy the requirements
of Arbitration Rule 40(1). The new claim about an allegedly unfounded invocation of the
denial of benefits provision has a direct factual connection to the original claims, since the
benefit sought to be denied is the ability to pursue redress for the subject matter of the
original claims. It would be nonsensical, in these circumstances, to require the new claim

to be brought in a separate proceeding.

As for the second requirement of Arbitration Rule 40 — addressing the temporal
requirements for asserting an ancillary claim that meets the substantive admissibility
requirement set forth in Article 40(1) — Article 40(2) distinguishes between (a) ancillary
claims that may be presented as a matter of right (“[a]n incidental or additional claim shall
be presented no later than in the reply”), and (b) ancillary claims that may be presented
later only with Tribunal authorization (“unless the Tribunal, upon justification by the party
presenting the ancillary claim an upon considering any objection of the other party,

authorizes the presentation of the claim at a later stage in this proceeding”). There is no

45

155.

156.

123

dispute that the Claimant’s new claim in this case falls into the former category, as it was
presented during an initial bifurcated phase of this case to consider one of the Respondent’s

jurisdictional objections, and well prior to the Claimant’s reply on the merits.

Finally, the third provision in Arbitration Rule 40 addresses the procedural implications of
a decision to admit an ancillary claim. Rule 40(3) provides that “[t]he Tribunal shall fix a
time limit within which the party against which an ancillary claim is presented may file its
observations thereon.” Taken together with Rule 40(2), which provides claimants the right
to file ancillary claims as late as their reply on the merits, the text suggests that an ancillary
claim may be permitted even if only one round of responsive briefing still may be afforded
in the written stage of the proceeding (i.e., in a respondent’s rejoinder memorial). This is
consistent with the unofficial commentary to Rule 40, which sets out explicitly that
“{njormally the written procedure on an ancillary claim is restricted to one ‘round,”
although tribunals obviously have discretion to permit additional briefing if they consider
this appropriate. '?> Be that as it may, because the Claimant in this case pleaded its ancillary
claim prior to the Respondent’s counter-memorial on the merits, the Respondent will have
two opportunities to address the claim, namely in that submission and, after the Claimant

responds in its reply on the merits, in its subsequent rejoinder.

For these reasons, the Tribunal considers that the substantive, temporal and procedural
requirements of Arbitration Rule 40 have been met. The Tribunal accepts the Claimant’s
new claim as admissible, without prejudice to the Respondent’s ability to challenge that
claim, in its forthcoming written submissions, on either jurisdictional or substantive

grounds.

Id. (commentary on Rule 40). Indeed, even with respect to claims originally pleaded, the ICSID Arbitration Rules

grant parties as a matter of right only one round of written submissions, while making a potential second round subject
to party agreement or tribunal discretion. See ICSID Arbitration Rule 31(1) (“the written procedure shall consist of ...
(a) a memorial by the requesting party; (b) a counter-memorial by the other party; and, if the parties so agree
or the Tribunal deems it necessary: (c) a reply by the requesting party; and (d) a rejoinder by the other party.”)

VII. DECISION
157. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal decides as follows:

(1) the Respondent’s request to dismiss the Claimant’s claims, on the basis that the
Respondent validly denied the benefits of Chapter Eight of the FTA to Claimant
pursuant to Article 814(2) of the FTA, is denied;

(2) the Claimant’s request to dismiss the Respondent’s objection to jurisdiction on the

basis of Article 814(2) of the FTA is granted;

(3) the Respondent’s request to dismiss the Claimant’s new claim for breach of Article
814(2) of the FTA, on the grounds that it does not meet the requirements for an

ancillary claim under Arbitration Rule 40, is denied;

(4) the Claimant’s request for a declaration that Respondent breached Article 814(2)
through its purporting to deny benefits is denied as premature, pending further

briefing from the Parties regarding the availability of relief for such a claim; and

(5) the Tribunal reserves decision on the Parties’ respective requests for costs, for

determination in conjunction with any subsequent such requests at the close of this

 

proceeding.
