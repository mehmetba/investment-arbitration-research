PROCEDURAL HISTORY

On October 22, 2013, the Claimants submitted a Request for Arbitration to the

International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’’).

The Request was filed on the basis of Article 26(4)(a)(i) of the Energy Charter Treaty
dated 17 December 1994, which entered into force on 16 April 1998 for Luxembourg,
the United Kingdom and the Kingdom of Spain (the “ECT”), Article 36 of the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States,
which entered into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”), and Article 1 of
the of the ICSID Rules of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration

Proceeding (the “ICSID Institution Rules”).

On 22 November 2013, the Secretary-General registered the Request for Arbitration.

On February 12, 2014, the Claimants appointed Professor Robert Volterra, a Canadian
national, as arbitrator. On February 27, 2014, the Respondent appointed Professor Pedro
Nikken, a Venezuelan national, as arbitrator. On July 30, 2014 the Chairman of the
Administrative Council appointed Professor Alain Pellet, a French national, as the
President of the Tribunal pursuant to Article 38 of the ICSID Convention. All three

arbitrators accepted their appointments.

The Tribunal was constituted in accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention and the proceedings commenced on July 31, 2014. Further, the Centre

designated Ms. Natali Sequeira as Secretary of the Tribunal.

The Tribunal and the parties held a first procedural session in Paris on 29 September

2014.

On 21 October 2014, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. | setting forth the matters
discussed at the first session with the parties, including the procedural timetable and the
agreement that the proceedings were to be conducted in accordance with the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings, in force as of

April 10, 2006 (“ICSID Arbitration Rules”).

On 14 November 2014, the European Commission (“EC”) filed an application to

intervene as non-disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2).

On 21 November 2014, the Claimants filed their Memorial on the Merits.

On 5 and 8 December 2014, the Respondent and the Claimants respectively, filed

observations on the non-disputing party’s application by the EC.

On 9 January 2015, the Respondent filed a request to bifurcate the proceedings. On 23

January 2015, the Claimants filed observation on the Respondent’s request.

On 5 February 2015, the Tribunal issued its Procedural Order No. 2 finding “that the

European Commission’s Application for leave to intervene is inadmissible”.

On 7 February 2015 the Tribunal informed the parties that it granted the Respondent’s
request for bifurcation of the proceedings. Accordingly, the Respondent’s objections to
jurisdiction would be addressed as a preliminary question and the proceedings on the

merits suspended.

On 18 February 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, setting forth the
reasoning for its decision on bifurcation. On 4 March 2015, the Tribunal issued

Procedural Order No. 4 establishing a new procedural calendar.

On 1 April 2015, the Respondent submitted its Memorial on Jurisdiction.

On 13 May 2015, the Claimants submitted their Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction.

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4 and paragraph 15 of Procedural Order No. 1, the
Parties exchanged requests for the production of documents on 20 May 2015. On 27 May
2015, the Parties exchanged responses and objections to their respective requests, agreed

to the production of some of the documents and objected to others.

On 8 June 2015, the Parties submitted a Joint Document Production Application and
Redfern Schedules, in accordance with sections 15.4.3 and 15.7 of Procedural Order

No. 1.

On 19 June 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5 deciding on the Parties’

requests for document production.

On 7 July 2015, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6 concerning a request for

confidentiality of certain documents to be produced by the Parties.
On 21 July 2015, the Respondent submitted its Reply on Jurisdiction.*
On 8 September 2015, the Claimants submitted their Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.

On December 9, 2015, the EC filed a second application for leave to intervene as a non-
disputing party pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule 37(2). On December 23, 2015, the

Parties filed observations on the EC’s second application.

On 14 January 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 7 rejecting the EC’s

second application to intervene as a non-disputing party.

The hearing on jurisdiction was held on 1‘ February 2016 at the World Bank offices in

Paris.

On 7 March 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its Decision on the Respondent’s
objections to jurisdiction, rejecting all objections submitted by the Respondent, “except
the one related to Article 10(1) of ECT (“Tax Objection” )”, which was joined to the

merits.
THE PARTIES’ ARGUMENTS
The Respondent’s arguments can be broadly grouped under five headings:

= First, the Respondent considers that the ECT is not applicable to disputes

concerning intra-EU investments;

= Second, the Respondent asserts that the claim on the alleged damages to the
renewable energy production plants solely pertains to Spanish companies that

own the plants and not to the Claimants;

* The Tribunal notes that while the Spanish version of this Memorial is titled “Réplica”, the English version

submitted by the Respondent refe

to it as “Rejoinder”. For purposes of the English version of the present Decision

   

the Tribunal will refer to this submission as the Respondent’s Reply on Jurisdiction.

6

= Third, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants are not investors for the
purposes of the ECT and that the Claimants’ investment is not an investment

according to the ECT;

= Fourth, the Respondent considers that pursuant to article 21 of the ECT, tax
measures are excluded from the scope of the ECT and that the Tax on the Value
of the Production of Electric Energy (“TWPEE”) created by Act 15/2012 is such

a tax measures;

= Fifth, the Respondent alleges that the Claimants failed to submit the dispute to
amicable settlement and to respect the three-month cooling-off period prior to
the arbitration in accordance with Article 26 of the ECT concerning Act

24/2013, Royal Decree 413/2014 and Ministerial Order TET/1045/2014.>

36. The Tribunal will deal hereafter with each of these arguments or series of arguments in

turn.
Iv. THE INTRA-EU OBJECTION
A. — The Respondent’s Position

1 The obligatory existence of an investor from “another Contracting Party”
gatory 1S

37. The Respondent considers that the Second Claimant (RREEF Pan-European Two), is not
a protected investor under the ECT on the basis that it is incorporated in Luxembourg
which, like the Kingdom of Spain, is a Member State of the European Union (“EU”). The
EU is also a Contracting Party to the ECT.

38. Thus, the Respondent’s argument is that the Second Claimant is not deemed to be of
“another Contracting Party” as required by Article 26. Therefore, according to the
Respondent, the Second Claimant is not authorized to avail itself of arbitration under the

ECT as this instrument is not applicable to disputes concerning intra-EU investments.°

  

5 This issue was only discussed in the written exchanges between the Parties, but both referred to their respective
positions during the hearing on jurisdiction (see English Hearing Transcript, 1“ February 2016, p. 67, 9-12 and
p. 177, 8-13).

7 Respondent’s Reply on J

Moreover, the Respondent contends that the EU judicial system has exclusive jurisdiction
over investment disputes between investors from an EU Member State (“intra-EU

investors”) and another EU Member State.”

(2) EU Preferential System — Primacy of EU Law

According to the Respondent’s reasoning, the EU is an economic integration area which
includes, in its internal market regulations, a comprehensive system for promoting and

protecting intra-EU investments. This, it says, has primacy over that provided by the ECT.

Moreover, the Respondent contends, the EU internal market contains a comprehensive
set of protections for fundamental rights which holds Member States liable for any
breaches. Finally, the Respondent asserts that the EU judicial system has a monopoly on

the final interpretation of EU Law.®

The Respondent points out that jurisprudence from the EU judicial system precludes
Member States from restricting EU nationals from enjoying the freedom of establishment

provided for in the EU’ constituent documents.”

The Respondent argues that the system of intra-EU investor protection deriving from EU
instruments and judicial decisions takes precedent over or displaces that contained in any
other international treaty. The Respondent points for support to the specific nature of the
£9

EU and also to specific recognition of this within the ECT itself."~ The Respondent relies

for support in these arguments upon:

= Article 1(2) of the ECT: Definition of the Contracting Parties includes Regional
Economic Integration Organisations “REIO”. The EU is the only REIO that
forms part of the ECT;!!

= Article 1(3) of the ECT: Defines a REIO as “an organization constituted by

states to which they have transferred competence over certain matters a number

of which are governed by this Treaty, including the authority to take decisions

binding on them in respect of those matters”;'?

Article 36(7) of the ECT: Provides that a REIO will have the same number of

votes as its Member States who are Contracting Parties; !>

Article 1(10) of the ECT: Defines the “Territory” of the REIO, referring to the

provisions of said organisation, i.e. the Eu; "4

Art 25: Recognizes the primacy of EU law;'>

The Respondent argues that in applying international law a tribunal should rely on Article

26(6) of the ECT, which requires the settlement of disputes in “accordance with the

provisions of the Treaty itself and the applicable standards of International Law”. This

means that EU law has to be considered equally as any applicable International Law.!°

In this context the Respondent cites the case of Electrabel S.A v. The Republic of

Hungary:

“...) the Tribunal concludes that Article 307 EC precludes
inconsistent pre-existing treaty rights of EU Member States and
their own nationals against other EU. Member States; and it
follows, if the ECT and EU law remained incompatible
notwithstanding all efforts at harmonisation, that EU law would
prevail over the ECT’s substantive protections and that the ECT
could not apply inconsistently with EU law to such a national’s
claim against an EU Member State.” "”

The Respondent also refers to Article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the

European Union of 17 December 1994 (the “TFEU”) which provides that: “Member

States undertake not to submit any disputes about the interpretation or application of

Treaties to a settlement procedure other than those foreseen therein.”

Sl.

According to the Respondent, this provision prevents the Kingdom of Spain from
submitting any matters concerning the internal electricity market to arbitration.'®
Accepting this possibility would mean that an arbitral tribunal would decide upon the
rights of EU investors in the internal market.!° In this respect, the Respondent notes that
the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”) has already ruled that this would
be incompatible with EU law, as the CJEU has exclusive jurisdiction to interpret EU

law.??

The Respondent further argues that its position is supported by EC which is “one of the
most authorised voices to interpret the ECT’,*' as it was the EC which, upon a proposal
by the European Council of Dublin in June 1990, put forward the idea of the European

Energy Charter and negotiated its conclusion.

According to the Respondent, Article 26(6) of the ECT directs the Tribunal to apply both
the ECT and any other norms and principles stemming from international law including
European law, at the same level. As pointed out by the Electrabel tribunal, in the event

of any contradictions between European law and the ECT, EU law should prevail.

The Respondent submits that any other position would be illogical” as the EU and its
Member States have promoted the ECT.”> Furthermore, the ECT emanates from EU law
and they both share the same purpose: to establish a common market on the basis of the
principle of non-discrimination.*+ Thus, it would be contrary to EU Law that a

Luxembourg citizen would have different rights than a Spanish citizen. 7>

(3) Disconnection Clause
The Respondent also invokes the irrelevance of the inexistence of an explicit

disconnection clause in the ECT:

“In this context, the notion that the ECT does not contain a
disconnection clause, as is asserted by the Claimants in their

comments on the Request for Bifurcation, is meaningless.
Obviously, and unlike bilateral treaties, which States can sign on
their own behalf, in this case no disconnection clause was needed
because the ECT was a multilateral treaty signed by the EU,
together with the Member States, and obviously the latter could
not subscribe to a treaty that was incompatible with EU law.”?°

52. At the hearing, the Respondent addressed a question by one of the members of the
Tribunal as to why, if this principle was so vital for the EU, the ECT did not include a
reserve or contemporary statement showing that the intention of the EU and its Members
States was to formally exclude Part 3 of the ECT for application among EU Members.

The Respondent replied that:

“So, the Commission asks the Court of Justice if it is adequate to
introduce a disconnection clause, and the Court of Justice says
no because, if we introduce this kind of provision, we would be
admitting implicitly that some parts of the Treaty would bind us,
and the ruling said yes, the EU is right, it is useless to introduce
a disconnection clause because the Treaty intends to extend this
system to other parties or Parties where there is already a
harmonization within the European Union.”?"

 

(4) Relevance of Previous Awards

53. The Claimants argue that they are not aware of any case where the Jntra-EU objection
has been upheld by an arbitral tribunal or a national court*. However, the Respondent
notes that the cases cited by the Claimants”? mostly relate to bilateral investment treaties

and not ECT, except for Electrabel v. Hungary.*°

54. However, the circumstances of the Electrabel case are different to those of the present
proceeding.*! In particular, the Respondent notes that both Spain and Luxembourg (the
alleged State of origin of one of the Claimants in the present case) were both Member
States of the EU at the time of negotiation and ratification of the ECT,” while in the case

of Electrabel, Hungary was not an EU Member State when the ECT was concluded.

55. Thus, the issue under discussion in Electrabel was whether the obligations assumed by
Hungary towards the EC and its Member States pursuant to the ECT, should be
considered overridden by the EU treaties when Hungary joined the EU, as provided for
Articles 30 and 59 of the Vienna Convention. The issue in the present case is different as

both States (Spain and Luxembourg) were part of the EC when the ECT was signed.

56. Concerning the Claimants’ reliance on the PV Investors v. Spain case, the Respondent

noted din the hearing on json

B. The Claimants’ Position

(D) One of the Claimants Is Not an EU Member

57. The Claimants submit that the Respondent’s objection about the Tribunal’s lack of
jurisdiction to hear the claims of the Second Claimant does not extend to the First

Claimant, as the latter is incorporated in Jersey, which is not part of the EU.**

(2) EU Preferential System — Primacy of EU Law

58. The Claimants further argue that the ECT’s recognition of the existence of a regional
organisation does not deprive Investors of their rights under Article 26 of the ECT.*°
According to the Claimants, the reference to REIOs in Articles 1(2), 1(3) and 1(10) of the
ECT serves to ensure that a claim can be brought against a REIO regarding a dispute
arising out of an investment made in that area, and it by no means suggests that the
multilateral treaty does not apply within the regional organisation absent a disconnection

clause.*®

59. With respect to Article 1(3) of the ECT in particular, the Claimants submit that the
Respondent wrongly interprets this provision to provide for the supremacy of EU law in
cases where the EU Members States have transferred their competences to the EU. First,
the Claimants clarify that energy is shared competence under EU law and thus, the EU

does not have exclusive competence on this field.*” Second, the fact that the European
Commission has criticized the measures adopted by the Kingdom of Spain suggests that
these were not taken at the direction of the European Commission nor were they required

by EU law.*®

The Claimants additionally contend that no other provisions in ECT could support the
Respondent’s claim of the EU’s preferential investor protection.*? Article 16 of the ECT
provides that other norms can prevail when they are more favourable to the Investor or
Investment.“ In this respect, the substantive protection afforded by the ECT to investors
and their investment is broader compared to the one afforded by the EU law, notably in
the post-establishment phase.*! This is also evident in the dispute settlement stage, where
the ECT allows investors to bring direct claims against the Contracting Parties before an
arbitral tribunal, in contrast to EU law, where the investor has to go through the domestic
courts of the State where the investment has been made.*” Therefore, if the ECT and EU
treaties were found to have the same-subject matter, the ECT’s more favourable
provisions, including the right of investors to initiate arbitral proceedings against a
Contracting Party, would take precedence over any conflicting provision of the EU

treaties.

In any event, the Claimants assert that the ECT and EU law do not have the same
purpose.** The ECT is not intended to create any single market,*> and EU Law does not

provide for any mechanism for investors to bring arbitration for a neutral forum.*®

Article 36(7) of the ECT is not of assistance to the Respondent either. According to the
Claimants, the fact that Article 36(7) prevents a REIO from exercising its voting rights

when its Member States exercise their own right to vote, confirms the Claimants’ position

that the EU and its Member States were not intended to be regarded as one Contracting

Party.*”

63. Furthermore, Article 26(6) of the ECT does not favour an intra-EU objection either.
Although the EU Treaties qualify as international law for the purposes of Article 26(6) of
the ECT, this is not the case for the EU secondary legislation, which is essentially
equivalent to domestic law.** Additionally, the Claimants argue that, from a public
international law perspective, EU law does not prevail over international law.*? This is
further illustrated in the practice of other ECT tribunals that have ruled on this issue

before.*°

64. Finally, the Claimants submit that the unilateral interpretation / subjective intention of the
European Commission or EU Member States is irrelevant to the interpretation of Article
26 of the ECT.*! Citing multiple sources, the Claimants argue that “what matters is the
intention of the parties as expressed in the text”.>* The Claimants submit that the ordinary
meaning of Article 26 is clear and unambiguous and thus the Respondent wrongly

attempts to resort to supplementary means of interpretation.>*

(3) Disconnection Clause

65. According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s allegations that an express disconnection
clause was not necessary based on the reasoning that, in a treaty where both the EU and
its Member States subscribed, the latter could not have become member of a treaty that

intended to apply;> and (iii) had it been intended, the inclusion of a disconnection clause

the ECT.*°

66. Accordingly, the Claimants are of the view that “the disconnection clause argument is
nothing more than an ex post invention of the European Commission”.>’ Whatever the
case may be, the Claimants submit that such inconsistent practice clearly is not sufficient

to establish the correct interpretation of the ECT.*®

(4) Relevance of Previous Awards

67. The Claimants further assert that all other tribunals which have considered the intra~-EU

objection have rejected it.°?

68. According to the Claimants, the Respondent’s arguments that there are essentially two
classes of Contracting Parties under the ECT: the old EU Member States v. the new ones,
such as Hungary; and that, accordingly, previous ECT awards since Electrabel do not
apply because they involved a non-EU Member State at the time, are not supported by
the ECT. Old EU Member States were aware at the time they signed the Treaty of both
their EU obligations and the obligations they were signing up. They chose not to insert
any provision in the Treaty to make it clear that the intra-EU disputes were not to be heard

by international tribunals.®!

69. It follows from the above that arbitral tribunals can have jurisdiction between EU Member
States. This has been confirmed by a number of tribunals and also by courts of the EU
Member States, such as the German Courts, which in dealing with the challenge of the

Eureko v. Slovak Republic award” also rejected the Intra-EU objection.

C. — Tribunal’s Analysis

(DD) General Principles

71. The main issue raised by the objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal based on the
“supremacy” of the EU law is whether such alleged supremacy prevails over norms of

international law.

72. The Tribunal has no doubt that, in the relations between Member States of the EU that
fall within the scope of the EU constitutional framework, the principle is that EU law
prevails and this holds true for “primary law” (treaties) as well as for secondary rules. In
this perspective there is no need to differentiate between both — subject however to the
hierarchy of norms within the EU legal order in which international agreements
concluded by the Union enjoy “primacy over provisions of secondary Community [or

EU] legislation”.

a

 

Moreover, by virtue of Article 216(2) TFEU, the EU accepts that the ECT is “binding upon the institutions of the
Union and on its Member State” thus recognizing that the ECT produces its effects in the European legal order.
Generally speaking, “the European Community must respect international law in the exercise of its powers”
(CJEC, Judgment, 24 November 1992, C-286/90 Poulsen and Diva Navigation [1992] ECR I-6019, para. 9, or 16
June 1998, 4. Racke GmbH & Co v. Hauptzollamt Mainz, Case C-162/96, ECR 1-3704, para. 45) and the treaties
it has ratified or which were previously binding upon Members States form part of the Community legal order and
are legally binding for the EU and its Members States. See e.g. among the most emblematic Judgments of the
CJEC: 12 December 1972, International Fruit Company, Joined Cases 21 to 24/72, ECR I-1227, para. 18; 10

Nor does the Tribunal question that the EU law as a whole (primary and secondary rules
together) must be considered as being part of international law outside the EU legal order.

However, this Tribunal has been established by a specific treaty, the ECT, which binds
both the EU and its Member States on the one hand and non-EU States on the other hand.
As for the latter, EU law is res inter alios acta and it cannot be upheld that, by ratifying
the ECT, those non-EU States have accepted the EU law as prevailing over the ECT. The
ECT is the “constitution” of the Tribunal and, to use the terminology of the UNCITRAL

tibunal in PY testes», $y,
Po This is what the Parties to the ECT agreed amongst

themselves; it is not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to alter this.

Therefore, in case of any contradiction between the ECT and EU law, the Tribunal would
have to insure the full application of its “constitutional” instrument, upon which its
jurisdiction is founded. This conclusion is all the more compelling given that Article 16
of the ECT expressly stipulates the relationship between the ECT and other agreements
— from which there is no reason to distinguish EU law. It follows from this that, if there
must be a “hierarchy” between the norms to be applied by the Tribunal, it must be
determined from the perspective of public international law, not of EU law. Therefore,
the ECT prevails over any other norm (apart from those of ius cogens — but this is not an
issue in the present case). In this respect, this Tribunal fully agrees with the position of

the tribunal in Electrabel.®

This being said, and contrary to the position of the Electrabel tribunal,” the present
Tribunal is of the opinion that, to the extent possible, in case two treaties are, equally or
unequally, applicable, they must be interpreted in such a way as not to contradict each
other. Such a cannon of interpretation is not different from that taken by the CJEC, which
held that “[w]hen the wording of secondary Comnunity legislation is open to more than
one interpretation, preference should be given as far as possible to the interpretation

which renders the provision consistent with the Treaty [...] Similarly, the primacy of

international agreements concluded by the C ity over provisi: of dary

Community legislation means that such provisions must, so far as is possible, be
interpreted in a manner that is consistent with those agreements” .”° Such a harmonious
or harmonizing interpretation is all the more compelling in the present case when, as
rightly noted by the Respondent,”! the EU played a predominant role in promoting and
negotiating the ECT.” As observed by the tribunal in Electrabel, “it would have made no
sense for the European Union to promote and subscribe to the ECT if that had meant
entering into obligations inconsistent with EU law”. That observation is consistent with
Article 207(3) TFEU, which requires the Council and the Commission to ensure that “the

agreements negotiated are compatible with internal Union policies and rules”.

For these reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that such a process of interpretation does

no violence to the text or spirit of either the ECT or EU law.

(2) Application of the General Principles in the Present Case

The main provisions of, respectively, the ECT and EU law that are presented as

conflicting with each other by the Parties are as follows:

ECT Article 26 (Settlement of disputes between an investor and
a contracting party)

(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of
another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter
in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an
obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be
settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions
of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date
on which either party to the dispute requested amicable
settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit
it for resolution:

(6) A tribunal established under paragraph (4) shall decide the
issues in dispute in accordance with this Treaty and applicable
rules and principles of international law.

IFUE Article 344 (former Article 292 TEC)

Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the
interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for therein.

A simple reading of these provisions shows that they concern the settlement of two
different kinds of disputes. Article 26 ECT is concerned only with the “Settlement of
Disputes between an Investor and a Contacting Party”. For its part, Article 344 TFUE

deals with the submission of disputes concerning the interpretation of the EU founding

treaties. As noted by the tribunal in PV Investor, Po
eer

Tribunal, this difference of subject-matter of the two provisions is dispositive: there is no

conflict between them.

The settled opinions of other tribunals endorse the view that it cannot be reasonably
maintained that Article 344 TFEU sets up an “interpretative monopoly” in favour of the
EUCJ. International tribunals have convincingly shown that there exist a number of
contexts where other judicial or arbitral bodies can and are called upon to interpret and

apply EU law.’ As the EUCT itself noted:

“Nor can the creation of the PC [European and Community
Patents Court] be in conflict with Article 344 TFEU [formerly
Article 292 EC], given that that article merely prohibits Member
States from submitting a dispute concerning the interpretation or
application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than
those provided for in the Treaties. Ihe jurisdiction which the

81. The Tribunal is also not convinced by the Respondent’s argument about the existence of

an “implicit disconnection clause” in Article 26.

82. The purpose of a disconnection clause is to make clear that EU Member States will apply
EU law in their relations inter se rather than the convention in which it is inserted.””
Absent such a clause in a multilateral treaty, it is intended to be integrally applied by the
EU and its Member States. It has not been challenged that no such clause has been
included in the ECT. According to the Respondent, the inclusion of such a clause would
be meaningless when “the envisaged agreement covers areas in which there has been
total harmonisation” .” In the Tribunal’s view, given that there is no disharmony or
conflict between the ECT and EU, as noted above, there was simply no need for a

disconnection clause, implicit or explicit.
83. The Tribunal agrees with the tribunal in the Charanne case:

“that the Contracting Parties to the ECT had no need to agree
on a disconnection clause, be it either implicitly or explicitly. The
purpose of a disconnection clause would be to resolve a conflict
between the ECT and the TFUE. However, there is no conflict
between both treaties. As it stated in previous paragraphs of this
award, the Arbitral Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide a complaint
filed by an investor of a EU member State against another
member State of the EU based on the allegedly illicit character
of actions carried out in the exercise of national sovereignty is
perfectly compatible with the participation of the EU as REIO in
the ECT. And, as explained in subsequent paragraphs of this
award, there is no rule of EU law which prevents Member States
of the EU to resolve by arbitration their disputes with investors
from other Member States. Nor is there any rule of EU law that

prevents an arbitral tribunal to apply EU law to resolve such
dispute”.”? [Tribunal’s translation]

84. The decisions of the ECCJ or the EUCJ relied upon by the Respondent in this respect
were based on a very narrow definition of the notion of disconnection clause, related only
to the issue of the respective competences of the EU and its Members States. This is not
at issue in the present case, of course. However, when the very essence of a treaty to
which the EU is a party is at issue, such as it would be for the ECT if the interpretation
proposed by the Respondent were correct, then precisely because the EU is a party to the
treaty a formal warning that EU law would prevail over the treaty, such as that contained

in a disconnection clause, would have been required under international law.

85. This follows from the basic public international law principle of pacta sunt servanda. If
one or more parties to a treaty wish to exclude the application of that treaty in certain
respect or circumstances, they must either make a reservation (excluded in the present
case by Article 46 of the ECT)* or include an unequivocal disconnection clause in the
treaty itself. The attempt to construe an implicit clause into Article 26 of the ECT is
untenable, given that that article already contains express exceptions to the
“unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration or
conciliation in accordance with the provisions of this Article” that had been agreed

amongst the States Party.*!

 Charanne and Construction Investments v. Kingdom of Spain, SCC No. 062/2012, Award, 21 January 2016, pp.
120-121, para. 438 -; Spanish original: “En realidad, el Tribunal considera que las Partes Contratantes en el TCE
no tenian ninguna necesidad de pactar une cldusula de desconexién, sea implicita 0 explicita. El papel de una
cldusula de desconexion seria, en efecto, el de resolver un conflicto entre el TCE y el TFUE. Sin embargo, no
existe ningwin conflicto entre los dos tratados. Como se ha dicho en apartados anteriores del presente laudo, la
competencia del Tribunal Arbitral para decidir sobre una demanda presentada por un inversor de un pats
miembro de la UE contra otro pais miembro de la UE con base en el cardcter supuestamente ilicito de actuaciones
realizadas en el ejercicio de su soberania nacional es perfectamente compatible con la participacién de la UE
como ORJE en el TCE. ¥ como veremos en sucesivos apartados del presente laudo, no existe ninguna norma de
derecho de la UE que impida a Estados Miembros de la UE resolver mediante arbitraje sus controversias con
inversores de otros Estados Miembros. Tampoco existe norma alguna de derecho de la UE que impida a un
tribunal arbitral aplicar el derecho de la UE para resolver semejante disputa.”

8° The very fact that reservations are excluded by Article 46 tends to confirm the intent of the Contracting Parties
to have the ECT unconditionally and integrally applied by all the Parties whether States or regional organisations.
51 See e.g.: Article 26 (3)(b)(i): “The Contracting Parties listed in Annex ID do not give such unconditional consent
where the Investor has previously submitted the dispute under subparagraph (2)(a) or (b).” and “(c) A Contracting
Party listed in Annex IA does not give such unconditional consent with respect to a dispute arising under the last
sentence of Article 10(1)”. See also the “Svalbard disconnection clause” as described by AES Summit Generation
Limited and AES-Tisza EROMU KFT v. The Republic of Hungary, ICSID Case No. ARB/07/22, p. 28, para. 79:
“This is further corroborated by the fact that the ECT Contracting Parties have provided for a conflict rule, in
relation to another treaty, i.e. the treaty concerning Spitsbergen of 1920 (the Svalbard Treaty). Decision 1 with
Respect to the ECT (Annex 2 to the Final Act of the European Energy Charter Conference) provides that ‘in the
event of a conflict between the treaty concerning Spitsbergen ... and the ECT, the treaty of Spitsbergen shall prevail

21

87.

Lastly, to recognize the existence of an implicit disconnection clause in Article 26 of the
ECT would put into question the function of explicit disconnection clauses when they
exist. Moreover, the absence of an explicit disconnection clause in the ECT would
naturally lead to the inevitable conclusion that, when negotiating the ECT, the EU
considered that there were and would be no inconsistencies between both juris corpores

and therefore such a clause would have been otiose.**

The Tribunal observes, however, that should it ever be determined that there existed an
inconsistency between the ECT and EU law — quod non in the present case — and absent
any possibility to reconcile both rules through interpretation, the unqualified obligation
in public international law of any arbitration tribunal constituted under the ECT would be
to apply the former. This would be the case even were this to be the source of possible

detriment to EU law. EU law does not and cannot “trump” public international law.

(iii) Conclusion of the Tribunal on the “Intra-EU” Objection

88.

89.

90.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection to its

jurisdiction based on the intra-EU character of the dispute.

The Tribunal wishes to stress that it has reached this conclusion (and, indeed, all of its
conclusions) after careful study of the pleadings of the Parties to this case and without
regarding itself as bound by previous awards or decisions rendered by other tribunals on
similar arguments. This being said, the Tribunal underlines that in all published or known
investment treaty cases in which the intra-EU objection has been invoked by the
Respondent, it has been rejected.** The present decision on this point therefore falls
squarely within the continuity of this consistent pattern of decision-making by

international tribunals.

The Tribunal takes note of the Claimants’ argument that EU law is not applicable to

RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited, which is incorporated in Jersey. However, since

to the extent of the conflict...’ No such provision exists regarding conflicts between the ECT and the EC Treaty”;
see also: Charanne and Construction Investments v. Kingdom of Spain, SCC No. 062/2012, Award, 21 January
2016, p. 119, para. 433.

the Respondent’s objection based on EU law is dismissed in its entirety, it answers the

argument. There is thus no need for the Tribunal to address this further.
THE DAMAGES OBJECTION
The Respondent’s Position

() Illegitimacy of the Shareholders’ Claim to be Compensated for Alleged
Damage to the Companies in which Shares are Held (Reflected Loss)
According to the Respondent, the Claimants confound their dispute, investment and
possible losses with those of the companies owning the plants. Furthermore, the
Claimants attribute to themselves rights to receive an income that in fact belong to such

companies. **

The Respondent states that while the shareholders have the right to receive returns on
their investment in a company through the distribution of profits, they do not have the
right to take legal actions for losses suffered by it. Any legal actions should be brought
by the company itself. ®°

The Respondent further argues that the general principle of the non-recognition of
shareholder claims, known as the “no reflective loss” is accepted as customary
international law and by all advanced national systems of commercial law. According to
this principle, any claim for losses should be made by the company and the shareholder’s
standing is limited to cases of direct damages to the shareholder’s own rights (i.e. acts by

a State limiting the shareholder’s voting rights, rights to profit sharing, etc).*°

In the field of international law, this principle was first recognised in the Barcelona
Traction case*’ and ratified by the International Court of Justice (“ICJ”), citing its

previous rulings, in the Diallo case.**

The same principle has been consistently recognised by the European Court of Human

Rights (“ECtHR”) (see i.e. the Olczak v. Poland case)*? and in arbitration proceedings,

such as ST-AD GmbH v. Republic of Bulgaria, in which the Arbitral Tribunal observed

that:°°
“[...] It has been repeatedly held by arbitral tribunals that an
investor has no enforceable right in arbitration over the assets
and contracts belonging to the company in which it owns
shares.”?!
(2) The Jurisdiction of the Tribunal only Extends to the Dispute concerning the

Loss of Value of the Shares

The Respondent submits that the above does not mean that shareholders do not have
legitimacy to submit claims to an arbitral tribunal but such legitimacy only extends to the
loss of value of the shares held by the shareholders as result of measures taken by the host

State.”

The Respondent argues that all advanced systems of commercial law include the principle
of non-recognition of shareholders’ standing to claim compensation for reflected loss so
the principle is widely accepted as part of customary international law. Moreover, both
the Luxembourg and the Spanish legal systems, also recognize the distinction between
shareholders and companies, and between the separate rights and obligations of each of
them.” The principle is also reflected in Article 25(1) and 25(2)(b) of the ICSID
Convention and Article 26(7) of the ECT.™

The Respondent further argues that it is completely different to evaluate damages

sustained by a company than to evaluate damages sustained by a shareholder.”>

“In other words, an investor whose investment consists of shares
cannot claim, for example, that the assets of the company are its
property and ask for compensation for interference with these
assets. Such an investor can, however, claim for any loss of value of

its shares resulting from an interference with the assets or contracts

of the company in which it owns the shares [...].”°°
The Respondent submits that in this case the alleged investment by the two Claimants
would be: i) an indirect participation (through Dutch branches) in the shares of Spanish
companies owning the plants (Article 1.6 (b) of the ECT); and ii) an indirect shareholding
(through its Dutch branches) in the credits of the shareholders in each of the Spanish

companies owning the plants (Article 1.6 (b) of the ECT).””

Thus, according to the Respondent, the alleged investment of the Claimants “would not

affect”:

(i) the facilities or the Plants;
(ii) the credits of the Spanish companies owning the plants;

(iii) the alleged rights granted to the Spanish companies by RD 661/2007;
or
(iv) income of any nature from the Spanish companies owning the plants.

The Claimants state that all of the above are assets belonging to the Spanish companies
that own the plants.°* Instead, according to the Respondent, the sole “incomes” that the
Claimants may obtain from their investments are the dividends or benefits generated by

their indirect stake in the Spanish companies and the interest on the shareholders’ loans.”

(3) “Two Bites of the Apple”

103. Respondent contends that a claim filled by the plant companies before the Spanish

Supreme Court may lead to a double recovery, contrary to good faith. '°

104. Furthermore, according to the Respondent, in the event that the Constitutional Court
annuls the challenged measures, the former economic regime would apply and the plants
would continue receiving remuneration pursuant to Royal Decree 661/2007. In this
scenario the plants wouldn’t have sustained any damages and the Claimants would be

able to claim for damages that were never sustained. !*

105. The Respondent contends that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction must be limited solely to
considering the possible loss in value of the shares and credits that the Claimants allegedly
hold in the Spanish companies. However, before making that determination it would have
to be proved that the Claimants are investors with an investment for purposes of the ECT

and that the Respondent has breached the ECT. The Respondent rejects all these

allegations. !°

consistently recognised the right of a shareholder to bring a claim that is independent

from that of the locally incorporated company.!°’ The Claimants further submit that the

Respondent wrongly relies on the Barcelona Traction case, because the latter is relevant
only in the context of diplomatic protection and does not extend to treaty-based
arbitration.'°° With respect to the Respondent’s argument on the application of the
principle of separation of legal personality between a company and its shareholders, the
Claimants argue that the recognition of this principle in the sphere of national law cannot
limit the Claimants’ legal rights against Spain under the ECT and international law.'”
This principle only becomes relevant when a shareholder’s claim overlaps with a

company’s claim, which is not the case.!!°

107. Additionally, the Claimants argue that the ECT and the ICSID Convention do not bar
claims for reflective loss.''! In the Claimants’ view, the Respondent’s reading of Article
26(7) of the ECT ignores the plain language of Article 26(7) which provides that a locally-
incorporated company, controlled by investors of another Contracting Party, shall “for
the purpose of article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention be treated as a ‘national of
another Contracting State’ and shall for the purpose of article 1(6) of the Additional

vo 112

Facility Rules be treated as a ‘national of another State A good faith interpretation

of the ordinary meaning of the terms of Article 26(7) suggests that the latter grants a
foreign controlled, locally-incorporated company the possibility to have recourse only to
ICSID arbitration or ICSID Additional Facility arbitration, but not to arbitration under
the UNCTIRAL or SCC Rules for which no mention is made in the Treaty.!!°

108. According to the Claimants, it is unquestionable that a foreign shareholder has standing
to bring treaty claims in ICSID against the host State for measures affecting or directed

at the locally-incorporated entity in which they invested.''* In support of this proposition,

the Claimants rely on several arbitral awards.!!°

109. The Claimants note that the Respondent’s only complaint appears to be that the Claimants
consider their investments to include the underlying assets and rights held by the Project
Companies.''® On the contrary, the Respondent does not contest that the Claimants
maintain substantial debt and equity interests in the relevant Project Companies, nor does
it contest that these assets qualify as the Claimants’ investments for the purposes of the
ECT or the ICSID Convention.'!” In this regard, the Respondent wrongly submits that
the Claimants do not hold qualifying investments in “the facilities or the Plants”, “the
credits...of the Spanish companies owning the plants”, “the alleged rights granted by RD
661/2007 to the Spanish companies...” or “income of any nature from the Spanish
companies’. In arguing so, the Claimants quote Mr Stanimir Alexandrov who states that
it is “beyond doubt that a shareholder’s interest in a company includes an interest in the
assets of that company, including its licenses, contractual rights, rights under law, claims
to money or economic performance ...”.!!8

110. The Claimants also refer to the long-standing practice of ICSID tribunals which deny to
distinguish between the shareholders’ direct ownership of their shares and their indirect
rights in the assets of the local company. '!° The Claimants particularly point to the Azurix
v. Argentina tribunal '?° which held that the claimant’s investment consisted of both its

shareholding interest and the rights held by the concessionaire. '?!

Tribunal’s Analysis

Although the Tribunal considers that the present objection is not entirely distinguishable
from the one based on the non-existence of an investment, it will examine both in turn

since the Parties have discussed them separately.

The “damages objection” is summarized as follows by the Respondent: “Lack of
jurisdiction ratione personae of the Arbitral Tribunal to hear the claim for alleged
damages to renewable-energy plants, since the legitimacy to make such a claim
corresponds exclusively to the companies that own these plants, and these companies are
not party to the present arbitration”.'*> Under this general heading, the Respondent also

complains of the Claimants’ “fraudulent attempt to obtain ‘two bites of the apple

Although linked, these are two distinct arguments which must be discussed separately.

"5 See Respondent’s Memorial on Jurisdiction, p. 32, Section C. But the expression ratione personae seems to be
a simple drafting or translation mistake since the Spanish text mention “Falta de jurisdiccién ratione materiae”;
in its Rejoinder, the Respondent describes the same objection as being made rationa materiae. It is in reality of a
mixed nature: the first branch of the objection concerns the holder of the right to claim for reparation (and so does
the next objection), while the second branch deals with the very existence of the alleged harm.

() On the Shareholders’ Right to Bring Claims before the Tribunal

115. The debate between the Parties on the first branch of the objection bears on the most

classical question concerning the standing of foreign shareholders to claim compensation.

116. The Respondent’s case is straightforward: “no compensation may be claimed by

shareholders of companies for alleged damages to the assets of the same companies” .'77

However, this first statement must be read in conjunction with the one which immediately
follows: “The Kingdom of Spain does not deny that the shareholders of the companies

have locus standi to apply to an Arbitral Tribunal for compensation for damages incurred

directly to their real investment” .'*> Quoting the ICJ’s position in the Barcelona Traction

case, the Respondent asserts that “[s]o long as the company is in existence the shareholder

has no right to the corporate assets” .!?°

117. However, the Respondent accepts that:

“this does not mean that shareholders do not have legitimation to
appeal to an Arbitral Tribunal with respect to the case in which an
investment has been made. What it means is that in such cases the
legitimation of the shareholders and the jurisdiction of the Tribunal
only extends to the dispute concerning the loss of value of the shares
held by the Claimants as a result of measures taken by the host State
with respect to the assets of the company in which the Claimants
hold shares”.'°°

And quoting from the Ruling given in the ST-AD GmbH v. Republic of Bulgaria case,
the Respondent acknowledges that an investor whose investment consists of shares can
claim for any loss of value of its shares resulting from an interference with the assets or

contracts of the company in which it owns the shares. '*!

118. Inthe Tribunal’s understanding, the Claimants’ position is similar as far as the principles

are concerned. Commenting on the above-quoted passages of the Respondent’s Memorial

on jurisdiction, they explain: “This is exactly what the Claimants are doing in this

case” 132

119. However, the Parties differ as to the relevance of the ICJ’s case-law in respect to the issue
under review. The Tribunal does not agree with the Claimants’ assertion — in line with a
probably majority view in the case-law'*? — that the positions taken by the World Court
are irrelevant in that they concern diplomatic protection.!** Indeed they do. But there is
no reason to set aside the Court’s findings when it comes to the definition and scope of
such rights. In reality, the two basic principles resulting from the ICJ’s jurisprudence

remain fully enlightening and applicable:

qi) “So long as the company is in existence the shareholder has no right to
the corporate assets” '*>, but

(ii) “The situation is different if the act complained of is aimed at the direct
rights of the shareholder as such.” '*°

120. In both Barcelona Traction and in Diallo the ICJ adopted a restrictive definition of the
shareholder’s direct rights.'*” This is controversial and has been criticized in the context
of the public international law related to investment protection. Thus, as early as 2007,
the ad hoc committee in the CMS case held that: “whether the locally incorporated
company may itself claim for the violation of its rights under contracts, licenses or other
instruments, in particular under Article 25(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention, does not affect
the right of action of foreign shareholders under the BIT in order to protect their own
interests in a qualifying investment, as recognized again in many ICSID awards” .'** And,
even more categorically, the tribunal in the RosInvestCo v. Russia case stated
unambiguously “that modern investment treaty arbitration does not require that a
shareholder can only claim protection in respect of measures that directly affect shares
in their own right, but that the investor can also claim protection for the effect on its
shares by measures of the host state taken against the company’.'*° In this perspective,
whether the investment treaty is a BIT or the ECT does not change the situation:
shareholders have a jus standi to act before arbitral tribunals in their character as

shareholders.

121.

In this respect, the position of the ECtHR also deserves attention. In the Olczak v. Poland
case (invoked by the Respondent), the Court found that “shares in a public company have
an economic value and, therefore, are to be regarded as “possessions” within the
meaning of Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 to the Convention“ (para. 60). Furthermore, the
ECtHR concluded, “the value of the shares in real terms was very seriously reduced. The
applicant undeniably lost his property as a result of these measures” (para. 61). So “a
shareholder in a public company may claim victim status regarding his complaint under

Article 1 of Protocol No. 1” (para 61). Additionally, the ECtHR has established that,

31 “S60 long as the company is in existence the shareholder has no right to the corporate assets” (ICJ, Judgment,
5 February 1970, Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain) (New Application:

notwithstanding the juridical persons’ ius standi before it according to Protocol 1, a
shareholder in a company may claim in her/his own name to be a victim of the alleged
violations of the Convention affecting the rights of the company “in exceptional
circumstances, in particular where it is clearly established that it is impossible for the
company to apply to the Court through the organs set up under its articles of
incorporation or — in the event of liquidation or bankruptcy — through its liquidators or
trustees in bankruptcy”.‘*° In such circumstances, the shareholders obtain compensation
proportionally to their participation in the company, on the basis of the full compensation

that could be accorded to the company. '4!

122. The Tribunal notes, however, that it would not be uncontroversial to allege that the
investment case law is entirely settled in this respect.'*? The formula used by the tribunal
in Postovd Banka v. The Hellenic Republic reflects a more cautious rule. After a careful
review of the case-law — including that discussed by the Parties in the present case —!47

that tribunal stated:

“a shareholder of a company incorporated in the host State may
assert claims based on measures taken against such company’s
assets that impair the value of the claimant’s shares. However,
such claimant has no standing to pursue claims directly over the
assets of the local company, as it has no legal right to such
assets.” “4

123. Be that as it may, there is no need for this Tribunal to take position in the abstract on the
existence or not of a general rule recognizing the right of action of shareholders, whether
generally or conditionally, in contemporary investment law. In the present case, this right
stems from Article 1(6) of the ECT, which defines an investment as “every kind of asset,
owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an Investor” and including “(b) a company

or business enterprise, or shares, stock, or other forms of equity participation in a

company or business enterprise, and bonds and other debt of a company or business
enterprise”. This formula removes any possible doubt concerning the Claimants’ jus
standi in the present case.'** As noted by the ad hoc Committee in Azurix: “It is the BIT
which determines which particular kinds of interests are protected, and it is the BIT and
ICSID Convention which determine the persons who may bring proceedings in respect of
an alleged violation of the BIT in respect of a particular protected investment’.'“° In the

present case, the ECT clearly includes shares among the protected investments.

For this reason, the Tribunal cannot uphold the second objection of the Respondent to its
jurisdiction. This finding does not, of course, deal with the questions of whether the
alleged breaches of the ECT have caused damage to the investment and, if so, what is the
proper measure of that damage. The Tribunal reserves these questions for the merits and

quantum phase.

(2) On the “two bites of the apple” argument

The same reasoning and solution apply to the issue discussed by the Parties under the
heading “two bites of the apple” — that is the reproach made by the Respondent against
the Claimants based on the fact that “[t]he same measures challenged in this arbitration
by the Claimants are also being challenged before the Spanish Supreme Court by
intermediate companies and/or owners of the plants considered in the present

Arbitration”.

The avoidance of double recovery or, as the Parties put it, of allowing “two bites of the
apple” concerns the amount and the modalities of the compensation (in case a breach of
the ECT is found). This is a question for quantum, not of jurisdiction. The Parties may

properly address the issue during the next phase of the proceeding.

(3) Conclusion of the Tribunal on the “Damages” Objection

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal rejects the Respondent’s objection to its
jurisdiction based on the lack of “Jegitimation” of the Claimants to bring before the
Tribunal their claims for alleged damages. The Tribunal expressly reserves for the
merits and quantum phase the related questions of whether the Respondent has breached
the ECT and, if so, what compensation is due to the Claimants in their character as

shareholders.

THE RATIONE PERSONAE AND RATIONE MATERIAE OBJECTIONS

The Claimants argue that the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction ratione personae
and ratione materiae are not admissible because they were made out of time, on the basis
that they were not raised in the Request for Bifurcation. It is true that, under the ICSID
Convention and Rules, a respondent must raise objections to jurisdiction at the first
possible moment and no later than the Counter-Memorial. The Tribunal recognises that a
failure to observe the procedural requirements set out in the ICSID Convention and Rules,
or indeed the directions of a tribunal, can be fatal to the admissibility of an argument. In
the present case, however, it is the Tribunal’s view that the dynamics of the proceedings
and the directions of the Tribunal have been such that the Respondent’s formulation of
its objections to jurisdiction ratione personae and ratione materiae as submitted in its

Memorial and Reply on Objections to Jurisdiction are admissible.

Ratione personae

(1) The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent’s position is that the Claimants are not investors for the purposes of the
ECT and the ICSID Convention. The Respondent has presented a number of arguments

to support its position:

First, the Respondent points out that for the purpose of the ECT, an investor is a “company
or other organisation” and this concept “must imply the arrangement of personal
resources (subjective element) and material resources (objective element) to achieve a

purpose (theological element) which, in this case, must be the rendering of service or the

production of goods on the market’.\** The First Claimant lacks material resources,
human resources, activity and generation of added value and a physical presence or
149

footprin and the Second Claimant lacks material resources, human resources,

economic object and a physical presence or footprint.!*°

Second, according to the Respondent, there can only be one single “investor” for each

single “investment” under the ECT."*!

Third, the Respondent argues that the First Claimant does not indirectly own the alleged
investments as the ownership of the intermediate vehicles or the assets is not shown in its
audited accounts. !°? The Second Claimant does not indirectly own the alleged investment
as it is merely a link in the chain of ownership between the ultimate owners (the limited
partnership) and the assets located in Spain.'*? The ECT protects only the ultimate owner

in an ownership chain.

Fourth, the Respondent alleges that neither Claimant controls the alleged investment.'*#
ECT Understanding 3 deals with Article 1(6) of the ECT. It refers to control in fact,
following an examination of all actual circumstances and considering all relevant factors.
The circumstances enumerated there to be examined include such things as financial
interest, ability to exercise substantial influence over management and operation, ability
to exercise substantial influence over the selection of management. The First Claimant
does not control the alleged investment because all the control is exercised by the
Manager of the limited partnership, which is not a claimant in the proceedings. The
Second Claimant does not control the alleged investment because, despite its indirect
equity in the form of capital and loans in the Spanish companies that own the assets, there
is no evidence that the Second Claimant has control of the alleged investment. The

Claimants have therefore not met the burden of proof.

Fifth, the Respondent submits that the Claimants are not the limited partnership. Nor can

they act on its behalf in this arbitration.'> They are mere “shell companies”. The

definition of investor in the ECT does not require a legal personality. But an investor must
be an organisation (“other organisation organised in accordance with the law applicable
in that Contracting Party”). This requires that such an investor engage in various
activities. An entity which simply has stakes or shares in other companies is not a
company.!°° The First Claimant lacks material resources, human resources, activity and

Claimant lacks material resources, human resources, economic object and a physical

presence or footprint. !°*

(2) The Claimants’ Position

The Claimants’ position is that they are both investors for the purposes of the ECT and
the ICSID Convention. The Claimants have presented a number of arguments to support

their position, the principal of which are summarized in the paragraphs 136-141 below.

First, the Claimants argue that each of the Claimants satisfy Article 1(7) of the ECT,
which merely requires that the companies are “organized in accordance with the law
applicable in [the] Contracting Part[ies]’. The Claimants are incorporated under the laws
of Jersey and Luxembourg and thus are qualifying investors under the ECT.'? The
Respondent’s argument that “an entity which simply has stakes or shares in other

companies is not a company” has no basis in law.'°°

Second, the Claimants refute the Respondent’s argument that there can only be one
indirect owner. There is no such limitation in the ECT.'°! The ordinary meaning of Article

1(6) on the protection of indirect owners is clear. !°

Indirectly controlled funds and the limited partnership are common forms of investment
vehicle. As in the present case, they often own and control investments down through a
chain of ownership and control through commonplace corporate mechanisms, such as

those that apply to all of the entities in the ownership chain in the present case. According

142.

to the Claimants, the fact that, under municipal accounting principles, the ultimate assets

in question are not shown on the First Claimant’s balance sheet is irrelevant. !°

The Claimants then move to explain the legal structure of the limited partnership at issue
which is an old English and common law form of commercial entity.! A limited
partnership is controlled by one or more general partners, who, in exchange for losing the
limited liability character enjoy the ability to direct the affairs of the limited partnership.
A limited partnership can only act through its general partner(s). In the present case, the

limited partnership has only one general partner.

The Claimants add that the limited partnership deed in the present case permits and even
requires the General Partner to appoint a manager to run the affairs of the limited
partnership. '® The Manager holds a contractual position and is appointed and paid by the
General Partner. Under the relevant municipal law, as reflected in the relevant contractual
arrangements, the General Partner has the ultimate responsibility for managing the Fund.
The limited partnership retains control and supervision over the Manager. The Manager
therefore has powers that are delegated to it from the General Partner (the First Claimant).
According to the Claimants, it is commonplace in the commercial world for entities to be

run and themselves to exercise control through the delegation of authority.

Finally, in contrast to the Respondent’s allegations, the Claimants submit that there is no
requirement under the ECT that only an ultimate beneficial owner can be the indirect
owner or indirect controller of an investment.'® The legal authorities cited by the

Respondent also fail to support this proposition. '©”

(3) Tribunal’s Analysis

Nothing in the ECT says there can only be one single investor for each investment. It
cannot be the case that there can only be one single “investor” each single “investment”.

The very concept of an indirect investor and an indirect investment contains within it the

143.

concept that there will be a chain of ownership and control that involve more than one
entity. Otherwise, there could be no investment that is indirectly owned or controlled.
The very concept of indirect ownership or control presupposes that there is interposed
between a claimant that is an indirect owner or controller and the investment one or more

other owners and controllers through which the claimant owns or controls the investment.

There are many different forms of commercial entities that are created by and exist within
municipal legal systems around the world. A company is one of them. So is a partnership.
So, too, is a limited partnership. International law looks to municipal law to determine as
a question of fact the legitimate constitution of these commercial entities, their ownership,
management, control, conduct and so on. As had been noted by the ICJ in Barcelona

Traction:

“In this field international law is called upon to recognize
institutions of municipal law that have an important and
extensive role in the international field. This does not necessarily
imply drawing any analogy between its own institutions and
those of municipal law, nor does it amount to making rules of
international law dependent upon categories of municipal law.
All it means is that international law has had to recognize the
corporate entity as an institution created by States in a domain
essentially within their domestic jurisdiction. This in turn
requires that, whenever legal issues arise concerning the rights
of States with regard to the treatment of companies and
shareholders, as to which rights international law has not
established its own rules, it has to refer to the relevant rules of
municipal law. Consequently, in view of the relevance to the
present case of the rights of the corporate entity and its
shareholders under municipal law, the Court must devote
attention to the nature and interrelation of those rights.” '°

It is not for this Tribunal to second-guess the types of corporate forms that exist under

municipal law.

144. According to the evidence submitted before the Tribunal, under the law applicable to the

limited partnership in the present case, its constitution, ownership, management, control
and conduct and so on was legitimate. In particular, it appears that the limited partnership
deed (‘the Deed”) in the present case permits the General Partner to appoint the Manager

to run the affairs of the limited partnership. The Manager holds a contractual position and

‘68 ICJ, Judgment, 5 February 1970, Barcelona Traction, Light and Power Company, Limited (Belgium v. Spain)

146.

147.

is appointed and paid by the General Partner, who also has “full discretion and authority”
to dismiss the Manager. Although, according to the Deed, the Manager has a number of
independent functions, it is always under the authority and supervision of General
Partner. Under the relevant municipal law, as reflected in the relevant contractual
arrangements, the General Partner has the ultimate responsibility for managing the Fund
and retains control and supervision over the Manager, which is in fact under the General
Partner’s control. Therefore, the General Partner (which is the First Claimant) has control
over the investment as required in Article 1.6 of ECT and interpreted in Understanding
3. The appointment and functions of the Manager do not undermine the General Partner’s

control over the investment. On the contrary, they rather confirm that control.

The term “shell company” is often used as a short-hand reference to a commercial entity
that has little or no activity apart from owning or controlling directly or indirectly assets.
Unless there is a reason under the relevant municipal law or investment treaty to conclude
otherwise, there is no basis under international law to accord such a commercial entity
any less entitlement to the protections afforded under an investment treaty than any other
commercial entity. There are examples of investment treaties that include within the
definition of investor only commercial entities that can demonstrate certain
characteristics or activities." There is no such limitation in the ECT or the ICSID
Convention. It would not be proper to read such an artificial limitation into the plain

meaning of the ECT, the ICSID Convention or into international law generally.

There is no basis in international law for the proposition that “an entity which simply has
stakes or shares in other companies is not a company”. The Tribunal has been presented
with no evidence of any such proposition in any municipal law relevant to the present

case.

Therefore, on the evidence in the record before it, the Tribunal concludes that the
Claimants meet the definition of investors under the ECT. The First Claimant indirectly
controls, and the Second Claimant indirectly owns and controls, the assets in Spain that
are the subject of the dispute in question. The Tribunal therefore concludes that it has
jurisdiction ratione personae and so dismisses the Respondent’s objection ratione

personae.

B. Ratione materiae

() The Respondent’s position

148. The Respondent argues that the Claimants have not made an investment in Spain within
the meaning of the ECT or the ICSID Convention. The Respondent has presented a
number of arguments to support its position, the principal of which are summarized in the

paragraphs 149-150 below.

149. In particular, the Respondent contends that the Claimants have not made any investment
in the “ordinary and objective sense” of this term. According to the Respondent, this is
the standard to be applied to the definition of “investment” under the ECT and the ICSID
Convention.!” This requires an investor to provide money, assume risks and make the
investment for a period of time, amongst other things.'7! In support of its proposition, the
Respondent relies on several arbitral awards that have ruled on the ordinary meaning of
“investment” .'” In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants have neither provided the funds

nor assumed any risks nor the duration.!”*

150. In particular, the Respondent submits that the Claimants did not themselves make any
contribution of economic resources into Spain. Ultimately, the funds were contributed by
the limited partners of the RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Fund Limited
Partnership. According to the Respondent, this is not sufficient to constitute an
investment by the Claimants.'”4 Accordingly, those who made the contributions of funds

are the ones who assumed the risks of the investment, i.e. the limited partners. 175

(2) The Claimants’ Position

151. As to the Respondent’s objection ratione materiae, the Claimants argue that they have

made an investment in Spain within the meaning of the ECT and the ICSID Convention.

The Claimants have presented a number of arguments to support their position, the

principal of which are summarized in paragraphs 152-155 below.

152. The Respondent’s principal objection ratione materiae is that the First Claimant has not
taken on risk and that the limited partners of the RREEF Fund its Manager are the proper
claimants. This is merely a reformulation of its objections ratione personae. As with the
Respondent’s arguments in relation to that objection, it reflects a fundamental

misunderstanding of the facts and law related to the RREEF Fund.!7°

 

153. The Claimants recall that the definition of investment is contained in Article 1(6) of the

ECT. The definition refers to “Every kind of asset” associated with an “Economic
Activity” in the “Energy Sector”. The definition is open, general and not restricted.!7”
The assets that are the subject of the dispute in the present case fit this definition. The

Claimants argue that the criteria identified by the Respondent are additional to the

definition contained in the ECT.!”8 They are also additional to Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention.!” The Claimants stress that there is no textual or other basis for adding them.

Additionally, the Claimants contend that there is no requirement under the ECT or the
ICSID Convention that any funds used in an investment must be imported from abroad
or otherwise.'8° Nowhere is it required that an investor must finance an investment
directly from its own direct resources.'*! Therefore, the Respondent's “mere link in the

chain” argument has no legal basis.

Alternatively, should the Tribunal decide to consider the additional criteria submitted by
the Respondent, it would find that they are present in the investments at issue.
Accordingly, the Claimants submit that the duration of the investment was for the
operational and financing cycle of the project and it was of no less than 10 years in any
event.!*? The Claimants also recall that they invested almost EUR 300 million in the
Respondent which constitute significant financial contributions. '** Finally, according to
the Claimants, there obviously was commercial risk which is reflected in the structuring

of the investment. !*4

(3) Tribunal’s Analysis

The definition of investment in the ECT is contained in Article 1(6). It refers to “every
kind of asset” associated with an “Economic Activity” in the “Energy Sector”. The
definition is open, general and not restricted. The assets that are the subject of the dispute

in the present case fit this definition.

The criteria identified by the Respondent are additional to the definition contained in the
ECT. They are also additional to the language of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.
There is no textual or other basis for adding them. The definition of investment must be
interpreted according to article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and
not in accordance with tests, criteria or guidelines beyond the terms, the context or the

object and purpose of the ECT. There is no test, set of criteria or guidelines that can or

should be relied upon in international law to restrict or replace the definition that exists
in the ECT. There is no reason to place any such test, set of criteria or guidelines on the

language of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.

The Respondent has referred to documents on the record that show there was an
assumption of risk in the projects. The Respondent argues that this risk was assumed by
the limited partners and not the Claimants. However, as noted in the previous paragraph,
there is no requirement for any assumption of risk contained in the ECT or the ICSID
Convention just as there is no requirement for funds to be brought into a State from
overseas in order for a national of one State to have an investment in another State (for
example, a national of one State who merely inherits property in another State nonetheless
has an investment in that other State). It would be improper to read such criteria as those
proposed by the Respondent into those international instruments. Furthermore, there is
always risk of some kind involved in every aspect of participation in business activity.
Even the passive holding of an investment, such as ownership of vacant real estate, entails

risk.

In terms of ownership or control by the Claimants of an investment, the Tribunal
considers that the reasons set forth above in respect to the Respondent’s argument ratione
personae'®> apply mutatis mutandis ratione materiae: shares fall within ECT
“investment” definition and “indirect investments” are also protected by the Treaty.
Given the wide definition contained in Article 1(6) ECT, if participants in an enterprise
“upstream” own and control an ultimate asset, then necessarily so too do those

participants “downstream” and to the same degree.

Therefore, on the evidence in the record before it, the Tribunal concludes that the
Claimants own or control investments, as that term is defined under the ECT. The
Tribunal therefore concludes that it has jurisdiction ratione materiae and so the

Respondent’s objection ratione materiae is dismissed.

TAX OBJECTION

A. — The Respondent’s Position

161. The Respondent argues that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute over the
tax measures that the Kingdom of Spain adopted through the enactment of Act 15/2012,

which allegedly resulted in the breach of its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT.

162. In particular, the Respondent contends that it has not consented to the dispute being
arbitrated, as its consent is limited only to potential violations arising from its obligations

under Part III of the ECT. '*

163. The Respondent moves on with a description of the taxes challenged by the Claimants.
The Respondent notes that Act 15/2012, in force since 1 January 2013, contains various
tax measures relating to the energy sector, including two that are disputed by the

Claimants (together referred to as the “tax measures contained in Act 15/2012”).

164. These new tax measures comprise, first, the Tax on the Value of the Production of Electric
Energy (“TVPEE”)'*’, which is imposed on the generation and incorporation of electrical
energy into the Spanish electricity system. The TVPEE is a tax applied to all generation
facilities, both renewable and conventional '** and is calculated on the basis of the total

amount paid to the taxpayer for the production of electricity and its incorporation into the

electric system during the corresponding taxable period. The applicable tax rate is 7%.'*°

165. The second tax measure that is disputed by the Claimants was introduced pursuant to
Article 28 of Act 15/2012, which amended Act 38/1992, on Excise Duties (“Excise Duties
Act”). Article 28 of Act 15/2012 introduces modifications on the Tax on Hydrocarbons

that affect, among other products, natural gas.!°°

!90 Respondent’s Memorial on Jurisdiction, pp. 52-53, para. 220. Fn. 117, Excise Duties are mainly regulated
within the European Union by Directive 2008/118/EC of 16 December 2008 on the general regimen of excise
duties and which repeals Directive 92/12/EEC (R-0031) and, in Spain, by Act 38/1992, of 28 December, on Excise
Duties (R-0032), which transposes the provisions of Directive 2008/118/EC into Spanish law. Fn. 118, This tax
measure contained in Article 28 of 15/2012 regarding the amendment to the Excise Duties Act, in particular to the
Tax on Hydrocarbons, was mentioned by the Claimants in their Request for Arbitration (paragraphs 76 and 77 of
the Request for Arbitration, 17 October 2013). The Claimants do not develop the reference to it in their Statement
of Claim but the Regulatory Report of the Brattle Group does mention it as one of the disputed measures

166.

170.

The Respondent makes five different arguments against the jurisdiction of the Tribunal

in this matter:

(1) The Respondent’s Consent to Submit to Investment Arbitration is limited to
Disputes related to Alleged Breaches of Obligations derived from Part II of
the ECT’!

The Respondent notes that pursuant to Article 26 of the ECT, the jurisdiction of arbitral
tribunals is based on the existence of an obligation arising from Part III of the ECT, which
a Contracting Party has allegedly breached. According to the Respondent, Part III does
not impose any obligations with respect to tax measures adopted by Contracting Parties.
Therefore, there can be no breach of obligations under Part III of the ECT with respect to
the adoption of tax measures and consequently, the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction as to this

issue. !9?

(2) No Obligations or Rights in the ECT with respect to Tax Measures

The Respondent contends that the ECT does not, in general, create rights nor impose
obligations regarding Tax Measures, with certain defined exceptions. This is clearly

stipulated in Article 21 of the ECT.'*

In view of the above, the Respondent points to the limited exceptions set forth in
paragraphs (2) and (5) of Article 21 ECT! and notes that paragraph (1) of Article 10 of
the ECT, on which the Claimants seek to base their allegations, is not concerned by

exceptions. !°°

(3) TVPEE is a Tax Measure for the Purposes of the ECT

The Respondent further argues that the TVPEE’s tax nature is evidenced in Article 1 of
Act 15/2012:

in the English version). Therefore, the Respondent assumes that the Claimants allege that this measure constitutes
supposedly a breach of the ECT.

171.

173.

174.

In determining whether a measure is of tax nature, according to the Respondent, a
question arises as to the applicable law.!° In this regard, the Respondent points to the
very wording of Article 21(7)(a)(i) of the ECT which refers to “[a]ny provisions relating
to taxes of the national legislation of the Contracting Party [...]”.!°’ The Respondent
argues that arbitral case law has recognised the possibility that in international investment
treaties a certain term be defined by reference to the national law of a Contracting

Party. °°

According to the Respondent, the fact that domestic law is the applicable law to determine
the tax nature of a measure may be further supported, by Article 3 of the double taxation

Convention between Spain and Luxembourg!”

The Respondent further argues that, in any event, even if the applicable law were
international law, TVPEE is still a tax?°° in accordance with International law.7°! The
concept of tax under international law as it has been endorsed by arbitral tribunals requires
the presence of three characteristics, namely that the tax is set by law, it imposes an
obligation on a class of people and that such obligation is a revenue for the State for public
purposes. Accordingly, the Respondent notes that the TVPEE was set by national law,”
is levied on all entities that produce and incorporate electrical energy into the Spanish

203

electrical system~”” and finally, the revenues from the collection of the TVPEE by the

State is intended for public purposes.?°*

(4) Tax Measures have to be Presumed Bona Fide

The Respondent recalls that arbitral tribunals have held that tax measures should be

presumed to be bona fide unless there is conclusive evidence to the contrary.7°> In

support, the Respondent cites several arbitral awards, including the Yukos v. Russian

Federation.?®

(5) TVPEE is a Bona Fide Tax Measure of General Application

175. The Respondent stresses that the TVPEE is a tax of general application applicable to all
energy production facilities. According to the Respondent, the State is not obliged to give
preferential treatment to producers of renewable energy in configuring the TVPEE.
Therefore, the fact that the TVPEE equally applies to conventional producers of electrical
energy as well as to renewable producers is not indicative of the mala fide nature of the

measure.?°7

176. Moreover, in response to the Claimants’ argument that the TVPEE is discriminatory
because renewable producers, as opposed to conventional producers, are unable to pass
the tax to the consumer, the Respondent explains that said tax is a direct tax that is not
passed on by taxpayers, whether they are producers of renewable or conventional

energy.7°8

177. Finally, the Respondent submits that the appeal of unconstitutionality by the Government
of Andalucia against the TVPEE and the relevant inquiry by the European Commission
with respect to the compatibility of the said tax with EU law do not cast doubts as to the
tax nature of the measure. In particular, the Respondent submits that the Spanish
Constitutional Court and the European Commission have ratified the taxation nature and

the legality of the TVPEE.?

178. The Respondent also notes that the TVPEE is public revenue of the Kingdom of Spain
included in the General State Budget, and that an amount equivalent to the estimated
annual collection deriving from the taxes included in Act 15/2012, among them the

TVPEE, is destined to the promotion of renewable energies.”!°

The Claimants’ Position

() Tax objection should be joined to the merits

The Claimants recall that the definition of investment is contained in Article 1(6) of the
ECT. The definition refers to “Every kind of asset’ associated with an “Economic
Activity” in the “Energy Sector’. The definition is open, general and not restricted.?!!
The assets that are the subject of the dispute in the present case fit this definition. The
Claimants argue that the criteria identified by the Respondent are additional to the
definition contained in the ECT.?!?. They are also additional to Article 25 of the ICSID

Convention.” The Claimants stress that there is no textual or other basis for adding them.

Additionally, the Claimants contend that there is no requirement under the ECT or the
ICSID Convention that any funds used in an investment must be imported from abroad
or otherwise.”'* Nowhere is it required that an investor must finance an investment

directly from its own direct resources.?!5

Alternatively, should the Tribunal decide to consider the additional criteria submitted by
the Respondent, it would find that they are present in the investments at issue.
Accordingly, the Claimants submit that the duration of the investment was for the
operational and financing cycle of the project and it was of no less than 10 years in any
event.?!© The Claimants also recall that they invested almost EUR 300 million in the
Respondent which constitute significant financial contributions.?!’ Finally, there

obviously was commercial risk which is reflected in the structuring of the investment.?!*

(2) Measures are not Tax Measures under Article 21 ECT

The Claimants recall that, for the taxation carve-out to apply, a tax must be bona fide.

According to the Claimants, the 7% levy was “‘a backdoor tariff cut” formed as a tax to

strip away and eventually abolish the incentives provided under RD 661/2007.?'°

Therefore, the 7% Levy was not a tax implemented in good faith, so the tax carve-out

does not apply.?”°

183. According to the Claimants, the fact that the measure at issue is labelled by the
Respondent as a tax is not determinative as to the application of the taxation curve-out.
This was made very clear in the Yukos case.”?! Additionally, the Claimants assert that a
State’s characterisation of a measure as a tax under its own internal law is in no way
determinative as to whether Article 21 of the ECT is applicable.??”

184. Furthermore, the Claimants contend that the definition of tax under international law is
not determinative either as to whether the 7% Levy is bona fide.» In the Claimants’
view, irrespective of whether or not the test advanced by the Respondent correctly reflects
the definition of tax under international law, the Respondent’s submissions as to whether
the measure meets each and every prong of the alleged test are irrelevant to the dispute.?7*

Finally, the fact that the European Commission has determined that the 7% levy is

compatible with EU law is equally irrelevant.?7>

(3) Taxation Measures have to be Bona Fide

185. According to the Claimants, the requirement that Taxation measures must be bona fide is
a consequence of the central principle of good faith that is broadly recognized under

international law.?”°

186. Moreover, the Claimants reject the Respondent’s assertions that the tax measures “should
be presumed bona fide unless there is conclusive evidence to the contrary”.?”’ According

to the Claimants, the Tribunal must determine whether a taxation measure is bona fide on

the balance of probabilities after reviewing the State’s conduct in its totality.?”

Accordingly, the Claimants submit that, if there is prima facie evidence that the tax

measure is not bona fide, the burden of proof switches to the other party.”

(4) 7% Levy is not a Bona Fide Measure but a Tariff Cut

The Claimants note that the Respondent implemented the 7% Levy amid existing ECT
arbitrations, and thus, it must have been aware of its obligations under the Treaty.
Accordingly, the inference must be that the 7% tariff cut was labelled as a tax with the

intention of avoiding liability for breaching investors’ rights under the ECT.?*°

That the 7% is not a bona fide measure is further evidenced, according to the Claimants,
by the fact that the measure doesn’t apply equally to everybody. While the conventional
producers can pass the extra cost of the tax measure on consumers, since they are free to
sell in the open market, the renewable generators have no other option but to absorb it.?*!

Therefore, the measure de facto affects more the renewable producers.?*

The Claimants further argue that the 7% Levy is part of a scheme intended to deprive the

Claimants of their rights under the ECT.?¥

The Claimants further describe the 7% Levy as a sham that targets specifically renewable

energy installations.?*+

Finally, the Claimants argue that the use of the funds from the 7% Levy confirms that it

is a tariff cut under the cloak of Taxation.?*°

Tribunal’s Analysis

On 27 December 2012, Spain adopted Act 15/2012 “on taxation measures for energy
sustainability” creating a new tax on the value of the production of electric energy

(“TVPEE”). According to the Claimants, such a measure breaches the Respondent’s

obligations set out in Article 10(1) ECT.?*© The Respondent objects that taxation
measures are excluded from the scope of the ECT by Article 21(1), which reads as

follows:

“Except as otherwise provided in this Article, nothing in this Treaty
shall create rights or impose obligations with respect to Taxation
Measures of the Contracting Parties. In the event of any
inconsistency between this Article and any other provision of the
Treaty, this Article shall prevail to the extent of the inconsistency.”

In the view of the Respondent, the taxes created or modified by Act 15/2012 do not
correspond to any of these exceptions and Article 10 ECT is therefore not applicable

2
to these measures.?*”

194. The Parties have debated at length the question whether the measures challenged by the
Claimants really qualify as taxes.** In reality, the Claimants do not deny that they are
taxes; what they question is whether they are bona fide taxes; if not “the tax carve-out
does not apply”.?°°

195. This allegation is at the very heart of the case which has been submitted to the Tribunal.
The consequence of a finding by the Tribunal that the measures included in Act 15/2012

have not been taken bona fide could have two consequences:

= either the Tribunal would decide that the Respondent cannot avail itself of the
exemption provided for in Article 21(1) and find the Application inadmissible

in this respect;

= or it could consider that the institution of the new tax is in violation of the
standards guaranteed to the investors under Article 10 of the ECT calling for

reparation, as is expressly requested in the Claimants’ Memorial.”4°

In both cases, a careful investigation of the circumstances and of the effects of the
challenged measures is needed. Such investigation cannot be made at the present

preliminary stage.

Conclusion on the Tax Objection

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal decides to join the Respondent’s objection based

on Article 21 ECT to the merits.

This decision does not prejudge any position of the Tribunal as to the admissibility of this

objection as a preliminary issue or a question of substance.

The Tribunal also notes that in its Memorial on Jurisdiction, the Respondent had
mentioned the amendment of the Excise Duties Act (Act 38/1992) of 28 December 1992
(“Excise Duties Act’) by Article 28 of Act 15/2012 and amending a previous Act, Act
38/1992 of 28 December 1992 by introducing modifications concerning the tax on
hydrocarbons.™! In a footnote, the Respondent notes that while this measure was
mentioned in the Request for Arbitration (at paras 76 and 77) “[t]he Claimants do not
develop the reference to it in their Memorial on the merits but the Regulatory Report of
the Brattle Group does mention it as one of the disputed measures (Regulatory Report of
the Brattle Group, 21 November 2014, paragraph 100 in the Spanish version, paragraph
103 in the English version). Therefore, the Respondent assumes that the Claimants allege
that this measure constitutes supposedly a breach of the ECT.”?*?. However, and in a
rather contradictory manner, the Respondent also asserts that: “The Claimants do not
allege that the amendment to the Excise Duties Act, in particular to the Tax on
Hydrocarbons, contained in Act 15/2012, is not a bona fide tax measure. Therefore, the

Claimants implicitly acknowledge that it is a bona fide tax measure.”

In footnote 252 of their Counter-Memorial on jurisdiction, the Claimants note that “Spain
also refers to the so-called hydrocarbons tax (see footnote 18 of the Memorial on
Jurisdiction) but this is not part of the Disputed Measures”. The modification of the tax

on hydrocarbons has not been mentioned in the subsequent pleadings, whether in writing

or orally. Therefore the Tribunal considers that it is not called to take any position in this

respect.

THE COOLING OFF OBJECTION

The Respondent has raised a fifth objection to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, based on

Article 26 ECT.

The Respondent’s Position

(1) The Objection

The Respondent contends that the Claimants have not observed the requirements set out
in Article 26 ECT regarding the request to the Kingdom of Spain for an amicable solution,
nor have they complied with the required three-month cooling off period before
submitting to arbitration the dispute related to: i) Act 24/2013, of 26 December 2013, on
the Electricity Sector (“Act 24/2013”); ii) Royal Decree 413/2014, of 6 June 2014,
regulating the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, by cogeneration
and from the use of waste materials (“Royal Decree 413/2014”); and iii) Ministerial Order
TET/1045/2014, of 16 June 2014, approving the remuneration parameters for certain
standard installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, by
cogeneration and from the use of waste materials (‘Ministerial Order
IET/1045/2014”).”>45

In arguing so, the Respondent relies on a number of arbitral awards, including Enron
Corporation and Ponderosa Assets, L.P v. Republic of Argentina and on Guaracachi
America, Inc. and Rurelec PLC vy. Plurinational State of Bolivia where the arbitral
tribunals noted that “observance of the cooling off period to seek an amicable solution is
a jurisdictional requirement’, in the absence of which a tribunal cannot hear the

dispute.*“° The Respondent also quotes The Oxford Handbook of International

244 See Respondent’s Memorial on Jurisdiction, p. 71, para. 299.

Investment Law~*' which, with respect to the award rendered in the case Antoine Goetz et

248

consorts v. Republic of Burundi,’ notes that:

“The tribunal found that the waiting period had been satisfied with
respect to the investor’s primary claim, but not with respect to
certain supplementary claims put forward by the claimant. For the
tribunal, it followed that the supplementary claims were ‘not in
consequence capable of being decided on, and the dispute on which

the Tribunal is called to give an award relates exclusively to the

[primary claim]’.”””

The Respondent argues that no letter has been conveyed to the Kingdom of Spain by the
Claimants in order to notify the existence of a dispute or to seek an amicable settlement
in relation to the measures incorporated in Act 24/2013, Royal Decree 413/2014 and
Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014.?°°

Finally, with respect to the Claimants’ argument about the futility of any attempts to settle
amicably the case, the Respondent argues that the requirements set out in Article 26 of
the ECT must be observed irrespective of the other party’s or the Tribunal’s subjective
belief as to whether they are necessary.”°! In support of its proposition, the Respondent

relies on several arbitral awards.”

(2) New Measures are not Part of a Single On-going Dispute

206. The Respondent further argues that the New Measures do not form part of a series of

measures which fall within a single on-going dispute. According to the Respondent, Act
24/2013 is much broader than RDL 9/2013 and proceeds with a new, complete regulation
for the energy sector that replaces the pre-existing old Act 54/1997. Therefore, it is
impossible that Act 24/2013 was issued to confirm and develop RDL 9/2013. In turn,
Royal Decree 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2015 are governmental

regulations which complete and develop Act 24/2013.?*4

211.

In the Respondent’s view, the Claimants’ assertion that any measure adopted by the
Kingdom of Spain, which deviates from the regimen set out in RD 661/2007, forms part
of a single arbitration, renders the requirements of Article 26 of the ECT useless on a
number of grounds. First, it leaves the object of arbitration indefinitely open; second, it
allows the Tribunal to make subjective determinations as to whether subsequent
regulatory measures are consistent with the previous regimen; third, it prevents the
Arbitral Tribunal from conducting a preliminary analysis of its jurisdiction if it has to
consider the content of the regulations; and fourth, it makes the Respondent defenceless,
as the Claimants could, at any time, bring new claims against any new measures the

Kingdom of Spain may continue to adopt in the regulated electricity sector.*°

Finally, the Respondent contends that the reservation contained in the Request for
Arbitration to introduce claims pertaining to possible new measures does not supersede
the requirements set out in Article 26 of the ECT, because those requirements are

necessarily prior to the Request for Arbitration.?°

The Claimants’ Position

() Further Measures are Part of a Single On-going Dispute

The Claimants contend that they have complied with the cooling-off period required
under Article 26 of the ECT because all of the Disputed Measures form part of a single

on-going dispute between the Parties that was clearly notified to the Respondent.”

In particular, while RDL 9/2013 completely withdrew the RD 661/2007 regime, it did not
prescribe the specific economic parameters that would apply to the Claimants’
investments thereafter. Those parameters would need to be defined in further legislation
which, however, was only enacted after the Claimants put the Respondent on notice of

the present dispute and after the Claimants had filed their Request for Arbitration.?*

Moreover, the Claimants made it clear in both correspondence with the Respondent and

in their pleadings that they would include in this arbitration any additional measures

implemented against the CSP and wind sector relating to the RD 661/2007 regime.” In
particular, by letter of 26 April 2013, the Claimants requested negotiations under Article
26(1) of the ECT, followed by a second request on 30 July 2013.7 Additionally, on 17
October 2013, the Claimants expressly provided in their Request for Arbitration that
“[t]he New Regime under RDL 9/2013 is to be implemented by way of several royal
decrees and ministerial orders. These impli ing measures are currently the subject

legislative debate, and likely to be enacted during the coming months”.”*' Both
requests for negotiations expressly concerned measures including but not limited to the
initial measures. However, the Claimants never received a response to these requests and

therefore commenced this arbitration.?©

212. In support, the Claimants point to an allegedly well-established line of arbitral awards
which have held that, where measures introduced by a host State after the investor has
requested arbitration are within the scope of the dispute outlined in the request for

arbitration, compliance with cooling-off periods is rendered moot.”

213. The Claimants particularly rely on the Enron tribunal which held that Enron had complied
with the cooling-off period in relation to the additional tax assessments, since they,
together with the initial tax assessments, formed part of a “single continuing dispute’ that
‘[stemmed] from the same factual background and [involved] the same causes of action
under the Treaty”.°+ The tribunal commented that Enron had expressly reserved its
position in the Request for Arbitration and that “... the filing of multiple, subsequent and

related actions in this case would lead to a superlative degree of inefficiency and

inequity”?

214. In response to the Respondent’s argument that Law 24/2013 was much broader than that
of RDL 9/2013 and thus repealed certain aspects of RDL 9/2013, the Claimants argue
that the Respondent fails to address the fact that RDL 9/2013 imposed a Transitory
Regime on the Claimants’ investments which required further implementing measures to
define the new economic regime for RE installations.*®° The Claimants further counter
the Respondent’s allegations that the Claimants’ approach would result in an open-ended
arbitration, by arguing that there is a clear limit on the type of measures that would be
considered ‘new elements’ to the claim identified in the Request for Arbitration.” Given
that the Further Measures were already announced in RDL 9/2013, separating them from
the Initial Measures would be entirely artificial.?°*

215. Additionally, the Claimants argue that the long period it took the Respondent to
implement the Disputed Measures cannot be a relevant criterion in determining the
admissibility of the Claimants’ claim.*® In any case, the Respondent adopted these
measures while it was on notice since 26 April 2013 of the Claimants’ intention to
commence an arbitration under the ECT for the measures that modified the remuneration
regime for CSP and wind plants as set out in RD 661/2007.?” Finally, the Claimants note
that the Respondent’s argument is absurd insofar as it appears to suggest that the
Respondent would prefer the Claimants to commence a new arbitration for each new

measure.?”!

(2) Attempts to Settle would be Futile

even if the cooling-off period has not been observed, a refusal to hear the dispute would

of the dispute. In this regard, the Respondent has not shown any willingness to engage in
amicable settlement discussions with the Claimants. Instead, it continued to take further

harmful measures against the Claimants and their investments.?”>

Moreover, the Claimants argue that the cases cited by the Respondent, which purportedly
support that the cooling-off period is a jurisdictional question, do not follow the
Respondent's position on the relevance of the futility of negotiations.””° In particular, the
ICS tribunal noted that futility of negotiations could, in some circumstances, be an
exception to jurisdictional prerequisites.°”” Similarly, the Murphy tribunal also appeared
to accept that, in principle, futility of negotiations could be relevant to excusing
compliance with a cooling-off period. However, so long as negotiations had never been
attempted in the case before it, the Murphy tribunal held that it could not conclude

whether the negotiations were futile.?”

(3) The Objection is a Question of Admissibility, not Jurisdi.

 

In any event, the Claimants say, the cooling-off objection goes to the admissibility and
not to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over such claims. According to the Claimants, this is
confirmed by: (i) the ordinary and natural meaning of Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
where the concepts of “jurisdiction” and “competence” clearly do not denote the concept
of “admissibility”; (ii) numerous investment treaty decisions which consistently have read
these clauses to impose procedural rather than jurisdictional requirements; and (iii) the
rationale of cooling-off periods, which is to facilitate settlement, not obstruct

arbitrations.7”

The Claimants further argue that none of the authorities which the Respondent relies upon
support that the observance of the cooling off period is a question of jurisdiction. Enron

v. Argentine Republic and Guaracachi, Rurelec v Bolivia and Goetz v Burundi are

isolated, specific decisions, and are not representative of the current state of investment

treaty jurisprudence.?°°

In arguing that compliance with the cooling-off period is not a pre-condition to consent,
the Claimants also point to the language of Article 26(3) which patently does not
condition the initiation of an arbitration on the compliance with the cooling-off period.?*!
Finally, the Claimants contend that because the cases cited by the Respondent are not
ECT decisions, they are not aimed to provide a valid interpretation of Article 26 of the

ECT. In any event, they can be distinguished on the facts.?5

Tribunal’s Analysis

Article 26 of the ECT reads, in relevant parts, as follows:

“(1) Disputes between a Contracting Party and an Investor of
another Contracting Party relating to an Investment of the latter
in the Area of the former, which concern an alleged breach of an
obligation of the former under Part III shall, if possible, be
settled amicably.

(2) If such disputes can not be settled according to the provisions
of paragraph (1) within a period of three months from the date
on which either party to the dispute requested amicable
settlement, the Investor party to the dispute may choose to submit
it for resolution [... to various means of settlement].”

The Respondent “notes the Claimants’ failure to comply with the obligations contained
in Article 26 ECT regarding communication of the dispute to the Kingdom of Spain and
the implementation of the three-month cooling off period during which to seek an
amicable solution before submitting to arbitration the dispute concerning Act 24/2013,

Royal Decree 413/2014 and Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014” >
The Tribunal makes three preliminary remarks, set out below.

= first, this objection only concerns the disputes between the Parties concerning

three specific measures adopted by the Spanish Government (respectively on 26

December 2013, 6 June 2014 and 20 June 2014) after the date of the Claimants’

Memorial on the merits (dated 17 October 2013);

= second, the Respondent does not submit that the Claimants’ omission to comply

with the requirements of Article 26 has consequences in respect to the whole

Application: “...the Arbitral Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a dispute
regarding Act 24/2013, Royal Decree 413/2014 and Ministerial Order
1ET/1045/2014” ?*4 and

= third, this objection is based on two different (if complementary) arguments,
even if the Respondent deals with them together: it is reproached to the
Claimants first not to have sought for an amicable settlement of these disputes
and second not to have allowed a three-month cooling off period to elapse in

order to allow for such amicable settlement.

The Claimants’ main answer to this objection is that “all of the Disputed Measures
[including those decided by the three concerned instruments] are part of a single on-

going dispute between the parties” .?°

The Claimants stress that this fifth objection “is a question of admissibility, not
jurisdiction’**° and that “[a]s a question of admissibility, the Tribunal cannot refuse to
exercise jurisdiction on this basis”.?*’ The Tribunal agrees on the first proposition: such
an objection bears upon the admissibility of the claim, not on the jurisdiction (or
competence) of the Tribunal to deal with it. However, the consequence of an inadmissible
submission precisely is that the court or tribunal seized cannot exercise jurisdiction in
respect of it — with, it is true, a significant difference when compared with a finding that
it has no jurisdiction: when the circumstances at the origin of the inadmissibility of the
claim have changed, it can be submitted anew and the court or tribunal concerned may
exercise jurisdiction on the new claim. As the Ethyl Corporation UNCITRAL (NAFTA)
tribunal put it:
“Tt is important to distinguish between jurisdictional provisions,

i.e., the limits set to the authority of this Tribunal to act at all on
the merits of the dispute, and procedural rules that must be

satisfied by Claimant, but the failure to satisfy which results not
in an absence of jurisdiction ab initio, but rather in a possible
delay of proceedings, followed ultimately, should such non-
compliance persist, by dismissal of the claim.”?**

226. This being said, the Tribunal is of the view that the core issue is whether the additional

227.

claims change the character of the case: if yes, then they are not part of the dispute, the
new claims must be declared inadmissible and the Tribunal must abstain to exercise
jurisdiction. If this is not the case, the objection must be dismissed since (i) it can be
admitted that the cooling-off period will have elapsed at the time the Tribunal’s decision
is taken and (ii) it would be totally artificial and unreasonably heavy to request the
Claimant to lodge new applications directed against facts which are but the continuation
of those at stake in the initial Application. In this respect, this Tribunal shares the opinion

expressed by the Enron tribunal: “... the filing of multiple, subsequent and related actions

[in such cases] would lead to a superlative degree of inefficiency and inequity.””*®°

The purpose of the Claimants’ claim is summarized in paragraphs 10 and 11 of its Request

for Arbitration:

“10. However, once Spain had enticed foreign investors
(including the Claimants) to invest substantial sums of capital in
the Spanish renewable energy sector, Spain reneged on its
commitments. Rather than maintaining the long-term, stable and
predictable revenue streams provided under the economic
regime, Spain passed a series of laws and regulations, which first
modified that regime significantly and to the Claimants’
detriment and, ultimately, stripped away that regime entirely.
These drastic changes did not apply only to new projects. Rather,
they also applied retroactively to existing projects, despite
Spain's express promise that any adjustments to the economic
regime (or any new regime) would not apply to existing projects.
These measures, discussed in Section 6 below, thus altered
dramatically the regulatory and economic framework applicable

at the time the Claimants made their investments and have
caused the Claimants substantial harm.

11. In short, Spain is guilty of the classic ‘bait and switch’. It
enticed substantial investment into its renewable energy sector
by providing the economic incentives necessary to make such
investments feasible in the first place and, once the investments
had been made and Spain received the benefits of those
investments, it simply withdrew those economic incentives.
Spain’s unlawful measures mean that the Claimants are left in a
position where the very foundation of their investment decisions
has been destroyed. For its part, Spain has received already —
and continues to receive — the benefit of the substantial capital
invested by the Claimants but, on the other hand, the Claimants
are no longer entitled to receive the government-guaranteed
economic incentives.”

“the dispute between the parties relates to Spain’s failure to honour its commitments to

the Claimants under RD 661/2007”.

The Royal Decree 661/2007, of 25 may 2007, aims at regulating the activity of electricity
production under the special regime and contains various incentives to that end in order
to encourage foreign investments by “guaranteeing the owners of facilities under the
special regime a reasonable return on their investments...”?°° For their part, the “Further

Measures” are summarized as follows by the three instruments enunciating them:

the Act 24/2013 of 26 December 2013, on the Electricity Sector, “sets out to
establish the regulation of the Electrical Sector with a view to ensuring the
supply of electrical energy and to adapt it to the needs of consumers in terms of

safety, quality, efficiency, objectivity, transparency and at the minimum cost

the Royal Decree 413/2014 of 6 June 2014, regulating the production of
electricity from renewable energy sources, cogeneration and wastes, regulates

“the legal and economic regime of the production of electricity from renewable

energy sources, cogeneration and wastes”;?*> and

the Ministerial Order IET/1045/2014 of 20 June 2014, approves the
remuneration parameters of standard installations that apply to specific
installations for the production of electricity from renewable energy sources, co-
generation, and wastes, which “establish the remuneration parameters for

lard installati corresponding to the i lati included within the

scope of application of this order for the first regulatory semi-period defined in
first additional provision of Royal Decree 413/2014”.?*4

230. The Tribunal considers that these instruments form part of the dispute which is the

231.

subject-matter of the Memorial on the merits submitted on 21 November 2014 by the
Claimants. The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction over this part of the dispute. And
indeed it would be of no avail and would impose an unreasonable burden on both Parties
to oblige the Claimants to request amicable settlement anew and to start new proceedings
against the Respondent in relation to these further measures which are a mere factual

extension of those initially challenged by the Claimants which announced them.

Conclusion on the Cooling-off Objection

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal is of the view that the submissions of the
Claimants concerning the measure adopted after their Request for Arbitration are
admissible inasmuch since they do not change the general character of the case submitted
to the Tribunal. Being mere factual extensions of the same dispute already before the

Tribunal, the Tribunal can exercise jurisdiction over them to the same degree.

DECISION OF THE TRIBUNAL

232. For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal unanimously decides as follows:

(1) The Tribunal takes note of the Claimants’ abandonment of their claim concerning
the modification of the Excise Duties Act of 28 December 1992 (“Excise Duties Act’)
by Article 28 of Act 15/2012.

(2) The Respondent’s objection based on Article 21 ECT is joined to the merits. This
decision does not prejudge any position of the Tribunal as to the admissibility of this

objection as a preliminary issue or a question of substance.

(3) The questions of the composition and value of the compensable rights allegedly

breached by the Respondent are joined to the merits.

(4) All other objections are rejected and the Tribunal has jurisdiction for deciding on
the dispute submitted by RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-
European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.]. on 18 October 2013, subject to paragraph

232 (1) above.

(5) The submissions of the Claimants concerning the measures adopted after their
Request for Arbitration are admissible and the Tribunal can exercise jurisdiction over

them.

(6) The Tribunal will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the proceedings

toward the merits phase.

(7) The decision regarding the costs of arbitration is deferred to the second phase of the

arbitration on the merits.
