Republic of Costa Rica
The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.”

This dispute arises out of the development of a gold mining project in the area of Las
Crucitas, in Costa Rica (the “Las Crucitas Project’).

The present decision concerns the Respondent's preliminary objections.
PROCEDURAL HISTORY

REGISTRATION AND CONSTITUTION OF THE TRIBUNAL.

On 6 February 2014, ICSID received a request for arbitration dated also 6 February
2014 from the Claimant against Costa Rica, together with exhibits C-001 to C-008
(the “Request for Arbitration”).

On 4 March 2014, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request for
Arbitration in accordance with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the
Parties of the registration. In the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited
the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible in
accordance with Rule 7(d) of ICSID’s Rules of Procedure for the Institution of
Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings (the “Institution Rules”).

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, the Parties agreed to
constitute the Tribunal as follows: three arbitrators, one to be appointed by each Party
and the third, presiding arbitrator, to be appointed by agreement of the Parties.

The Tribunal is composed of Gabrielle Kaufmann-Kohler, a national of Switzerland,
President, appointed by agreement of the Parties; Bernard Hanotiau, a national of
Belgium, appointed by the Claimant; and Brigitte Stern, a national of France,
appointed by the Respondent.

On 29 September 2014, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the
ICSID Rules of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “Arbitration Rules”),
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that
the Tribunal was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. Ms. Luisa
Fernanda Torres, ICSID Legal Counsel, was designated to serve as Secretary of the
Tribunal.

On 29 September 2014, the President of the Tribunal proposed to the Parties the
appointment of an assistant to the Tribunal. Both Parties confirmed their agreement
on that same day.

On 9 December 2014, with the approval of the other Members of the Tribunal, the
President of the Tribunal proposed that Ms. Sabina Sacco be appointed as the
assistant to the Tribunal. On 12 January 2015, both Parties approved the
appointment.

FIRST SESSION

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), and in accordance with the Parties’
agreement to extend the 60-day deadline set forth in Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a
first session with the Parties on 22 January 2015 by telephone conference.

Following the first session, on 17 February 2015, the President of the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 1 on behalf of the Tribunal. Procedural Order No. 1 provides,
inter alia, that the applicable Arbitration Rules are those in effect from 10 April 2006,
that the procedural languages are English and Spanish, and that the place of the
proceeding is Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also sets out the Procedural
Calendar for the jurisdictional phase of these proceedings.

PARTIES’ WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS AND PROCEDURAL APPLICATIONS

On 17 June 2015, following a request from the Claimant agreed upon by the
Respondent, the Tribunal amended the Procedural Calendar (“Revision No. 1”).
According to the revised Procedural Calendar, the Claimant’s Memorial on the Merits
was due on 10 July 2015.

On 13 July 2015, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties observing that the Claimant had
failed to file its Memorial on the Merits on the due date and inviting explanations from
the Claimant, to be followed by observations from the Respondent.

On 15 July 2015, the Claimant’s counsel provided explanations relating to its inability
to obtain client instructions as a result of the resignation of all of the Claimant's
directors and officers. The Claimant's counsel requested a temporary suspension of
the Procedural Calendar.

Following an invitation from the Tribunal, on 24 July 2015, the Respondent opposed
the suspension request, and asked the Tribunal to declare the Claimant in default
under ICSID Arbitration Rule 26(3). In addition, the Respondent sought an order for
discontinuance of the proceeding under ICSID Arbitration Rule 44 (the “Respondent's
Request for Discontinuance”). In the alternative, the Respondent sought an order for
security for costs (the “Respondent's Request for Security for Costs”) coupled with a
revision to the Procedural Calendar. The Respondent's submission was
accompanied by one legal authority.

On 27 July 2015, the Tribunal invited the Claimant to provide by 10 August 2015
observations on the Respondent's Requests for Discontinuance and Security for
Costs.

On 10 August 2015, the Claimant’s counsel requested an extension of the deadline to
file its observations, citing again inability to obtain client instructions as a result of the
Claimant's lack of directors and management.

On 14 August 2015, the Respondent stated that it did not consent to the extension
request, and insisted that the proceeding be discontinued “immediately” pursuant to

23.

24.

25.

ICSID Arbitration Rule 44, on grounds of lack of opposition from the Claimant. The
Respondent also raised a further issue relating to the transfer of certain property in

Costa Rica.

On 20 August 2015, the Tribunal granted the Claimant an extension until 1
September 2015 to provide observations on the Respondent's Requests for
Discontinuance and Security for Costs of 24 July 2015, and the transfer of property
issue raised in the Respondent's letter of 14 August 2015. On 1 September 2015, the
Claimant’s counsel informed the Tribunal that it still was not in a position to receive
client instructions to respond, and reiterated the request for a temporary suspension
of the Procedural Calendar. On 1 September 2015, the Respondent provided further

observations on the matter.

On 8 September 2015, the Tribunal gave the following directions to the Parties:

[1

At this stage, the Tribunal is of the view that it cannot order the
discontinuance requested by the Respondent. This request has been
made under Rule 44 of the ICSID Arbitration Rules, which addresses
discontinuance of the proceedings at the request of a party. According to
the Explanatory Notes to Rule 44 in the 1968 version of the Rule (which
is identical to its 2006 version), ‘under this Rule the agreement (express
or implied) of both parties must be secured for discontinuance’ (Note C).
The Claimant has not consented to the discontinuance, neither expressly
nor impliedly. To the contrary, although it has not made a formal
objection, it has stated that ‘a discontinuance of the proceeding [...]
would cause significant prejudice to the Claimant.’ The Tribunal
understands this to be an implied objection.

That being said, the present state of uncertainty cannot last indefinitely.
As noted in the Explanatory Notes cited above, ‘this Rule provides that if
either party wishes to discontinue the proceeding unilaterally, the
acquiescence of the other party must be obtained; but, so as not to
permit such party to block a discontinuance by inaction, intentional or
unintentional, a time limit is to be set for its response’ (Note B). The
Tribunal already set one time limit for this purpose, of which the Claimant
now requests an extension. Given the special circumstances
surrounding the Claimant's corporate organization and management, the
Tribunal is willing to extend this deadline for an additional three weeks,
ie. until 29 September 2015. If by then the Claimant does not indicate
clearly whether it wishes to pursue this arbitration and present a formal
objection to the discontinuance requested by the Respondent, the
Tribunal will apply Rule 44 and deem that the Claimant has acquiesced in
the discontinuance.

The Respondent's request for security for costs is deferred until the
Tribunal’s final ruling on the discontinuance, if at that stage the request
remains applicable.

On 29 September 2015, the Claimant filed a submission in response to the
Respondent’s Requests for Discontinuance and Security for Costs, and renewed its

request for a temporary suspension of the Procedural Calendar.

This submission

was accompanied by exhibits C-008 to C-012,' and legal authorities CL-001 to
CL-014.

On 2 October 2015, the Tribunal dismissed the Respondent's Requests for
Discontinuance and Security for Costs. The Tribunal further invited the Parties to
confer and submit by 16 October 2015 a joint proposal for a revised Procedural
Calendar, or individual proposals if an agreement was not possible.

Following various requests for extension, on 6 November 2015, each Party filed a
communication to the Tribunal setting forth its position concerning the Procedural
Calendar. The Claimant submitted an additional communication on 7 November
2015, and the Respondent on 9 November 2015.

On 10 November 2015, the Tribunal ruled on the Parties’ disagreement over the
timetable, and established a new Procedural Calendar (“Revision No. 2”).

On 23 December 2015, the Claimant filed its Memorial on the Merits, accompanied by
exhibits C-001 to C-350;? legal authorities CL-001 to CL-100;° two (2) witness
statements, by Mr. Eric Rauguth and Mr. Juan Carlos Hernandez, respectively; and
two (2) expert reports by FTI Consulting Inc. and Roscoe Postle Associates Inc.,
respectively.*

On 14 January 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it had entered into a
funding agreement with Vannin Capital PCC in connection with the present
proceeding. On 18 January 2016, the Tribunal informed the Parties that no conflict
arose for any of the Members of the Tribunal as a result of this arrangement. It
further invited the Respondent to provide any observations it may have in connection
with the Claimant's third party funding arrangement within one week. No
observations were received from the Respondent.

On 21 March 2016, following a request from the Respondent agreed upon by the
Claimant, the Tribunal amended the Procedural Calendar (“Revision No. 3”).

On 8 April 2016, the Respondent filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction,® accompanied by
exhibits R-001 to R-117; legal authorities RL-001 to RL-131; and one (1) expert report
by Mr. Carlos Ubico.

The document designated as C-008 differs from another document previously submitted using
the same numerical designation. See supra, § 7.

The same documents designated as exhibits C-001 to C-008 had been previously submitted.
See supra, J 7 and 25.

The documents designated as CL-001 to CL-014 in this submission differ from those
previously submitted under the same numerical designation. See supra, § 25.

On 26 December 2015, the Claimant submitted a Revised CER-RPA 1 and a Revised CER-
FTI Consulting 1. On 6 January 2016, with the Respondent's agreement, the Claimant
submitted a Revised Memorial on the Merits.

On 9 May 2016, with the Claimant’s agreement, the Respondent submitted a Revised
Memorial on Jurisdiction.

Following a prior exchange of requests for document production among the Parties,
on 20 May 2016, the Respondent submitted to the Tribunal its objections to the
Claimant’s requests for document production. On that same date, the Claimant
informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the Respondent's single request for
document production.

On 27 May 2016, the Claimant submitted its replies to the Respondent’s objections
on document production, together with exhibits C-352 to C-354.

On 10 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 on document
production.

On 7 July 2016, the Claimant filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, accompanied
by exhibits C-351 to C-423; legal authorities CL-101 to CL-211:° one (1) witness
statement by Mr. Juan Carlos Hernandez; and three (3) expert reports by Ms. Ana
Virginia Calzada, Mr. Rubén Hernandez together with Mr. Erasmo Rojas, and FTI
Consulting Inc., respectively.

On 4 August 2016, following a request from the Respondent agreed upon by the
Claimant, the Tribunal once more amended the Procedural Calendar (“Revision No.
4’).

On 30 September 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that the Parties had
agreed on a short extension for the submission of its Reply on Jurisdiction and
Observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, which was due that day.

On 1 October 2016, the Respondent filed its Reply on Jurisdiction and Observations
on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, accompanied by exhibits R-118 to R-145;
legal authorities RL-140 to RL-181; and one (1) expert report by Mr. Carlos Ubico.

On 16 December 2016, the Claimant filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and
Observations on the Non-Disputing Party Submission, accompanied by exhibits C-
075 (revised), C-424 to C-444; legal authorities CL-212 to CL-238; one (1) witness
statement, by Mr. Juan Carlos Hernandez; and two (2) expert reports by Ms. Ana
Virginia Calzada, and Mr. Rubén Hernandez together with Mr. Erasmo Rojas,
respectively.

NON-DISPUTING PARTY APPLICATION AND SUBMISSION

On 15 September 2014, prior to the constitution of the Tribunal, the Asociacién
Preservacionista de Flora y Fauna Silvestre (‘APREFLOFAS”) filed a “Petition for
Amicus Curiae Status,” together with exhibit P-1 (“‘APREFLOFAS'’s Petition’).

On 20 February 2015, the Tribunal informed APREFLOFAS that (i) it had received
APREFLOFAS’s Petition upon constitution; (ii) pursuant to ICSID Arbitration Rule

The same documents designated as exhibits C-351 to C-354 and legal authorities CL-101 to
CL-109 had been previously submitted. See infra, § 45 and supra, J 34.

37(2), it had invited the Parties to provide observations; and (iii) as a result of the
Procedural Calendar set forth for such observations, a ruling on the Petition should
not be expected until November 2015.

On 3 December 2015, APREFLOFAS filed a request for the Tribunal to rule on its
Petition of 15 September 2014.

On 4 December 2015, the Tribunal informed APREFLOFAS that as a result of
modifications to the Procedural Calendar, the Parties’ observations on
APREFLOFAS’s Petition had been delayed until April 2016. In consequence, the
Tribunal now expected to issue its ruling on APREFLOFAS'’s Petition in May 2016.

On 29 April 2016, the Respondent filed a Submission on APREFLOFAS’s Petition,
together with legal authorities RL-132 to RL-139. On that same date, the Claimant
filed its Submission on APREFLOFAS'’s Petition, together with exhibit C-351, and
legal authorities CL-101 to CL-109.

On 1 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 on APREFLOFAS’s
Petition. The Tribunal authorized APREFLOFAS to file a written submission, and
granted it access to selected portions of the Parties’ pleadings, subject to
confidentiality restrictions. On 7 June 2016, both Parties consented to the publication
of Procedural Order No. 2.

On 8 June 2016, APREFLOFAS received the pleading excerpts authorized by the
Tribunal.

On 19 July 2016, APREFLOFAS filed its Non-Disputing Party Submission, together
with exhibits NDP-001 to NDP-013 (“APREFLOFAS’s Submission” or the “Non-
Disputing Party Submission”).

On 18 August 2016, following a request from the Tribunal, APREFLOFAS submitted
translations of certain exhibits filed with its Non-Disputing Party Submission. Those
translations were designated as exhibits NDP-014 to NDP-020.

The Parties presented their Observations on APREFLOFAS’s Submission together
with their respective Reply and Rejoinder on Jurisdiction.”

ORAL PROCEDURE

Following an initial proposal from the Tribunal, on 4 January 2017, the Parties

Tribunal will engage in a more comprehensive assessment of the facts during the
merits phase, if appropriate.

ORIGINS AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE LAS CRUCITAS PROJECT

On 7 June 1993, Vientos de Abangares, S.A. (a company incorporated by a
Canadian geologist) obtained an exploration permit for the Las Crucitas Project
area.'°

On 16 June 1993, Vientos de Abangares, S.A. submitted an Environmental Impact
Assessment (“EIA”), which was approved by the National Technical Environmental
Secretariat (the “SETENA’) on 1 October 1993."

In January 1996, the exploration permit was transferred to Placer Dome de Costa
Rica, S.A. (a subsidiary of the Canadian mining company Placer Dome International),
and its term was extended to 18 September 1999.'?

In 1997, President Figueres and the Minister of the Environment issued a decree that
declared mining to be an industry of national convenience. "*

In 1998, Placer Dome de Costa Rica S.A. was sold to Lyon Lake Mines, Ltd., and its
name was changed to Industrias Infinito S.A. (“Industrias Infinito”).

Between 1993 and 2000, Industrias Infinito allegedly performed drilling and studies to
prove the existence and extent of the gold deposit. In particular:

a. In 1996, Industrias Infinito completed an extensive pre-feasibility study,'* which
was accompanied by several reports and reviews on the viability of the project.'®

b. Industrias Infinito also commissioned other studies and reports addressing the
environmental and socio-economic impact of the project.'®

c. In 1999, Industrias Infinito completed a comprehensive feasibility study that
allegedly proved the existence of a substantial gold deposit in the Las Crucitas
area.'? According to the Claimant, under the Mining Code this gave Industrias
Infinito the exclusive right to obtain an exploitation concession."

d. In December 1999, Industrias Infinito submitted the feasibility study to the

Environment and Energy (“MINAE”), and requested an exploitation concession to
develop a surface gold mine at Las Crucitas."?

In May 2000, the Claimant (then known as Vannessa Ventures Ltd.) acquired
Industrias Infinito.?°

Between 2000 and 2001, Industrias Infinito continued the exploration work and
obtained an updated resource estimate.*' The Claimant also alleges that it launched
a reforestation initiative, planted 20,000 trees,” and built relationships with local
communities and governments.”

On 7 June 2001, the DGM approved the feasibility study, including the socio-
economic and environmental impacts of the project.**

On 17 December 2001, Industrias Infinito obtained its exploitation concession, with a
ten-year term subject to extensions and one renewal, allowing it to extract, process
and sell the minerals from the Las Crucitas gold deposit.> The concession became
effective on 30 January 2002, and is hereinafter referred to as the “2002
Concession.””® However, according to the Claimant, the exploitation activities could
not begin until an EIA for the project was approved by the SETENA.?” According to
the Respondent, the validity of the 2002 Concession was conditioned upon the
subsequent approval of an EIA.

In March 2002, Industrias Infinito submitted its EIA to the SETENA for its approval.”°

MEASURES THAT AFFECTED THE LAS CRUCITAS PROJECT

On 13 February 2002, Mr. Abel Pacheco, at the time a presidential candidate, filed a
challenge before the MINAE, requesting the revocation of Industrias Infinito’s 2002
Concession, alleging that it was against the national interest and endangered the

constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment.®° Due to
similar challenges before the Supreme Court, the MINAE deferred its decision on this
challenge.

On 1 April 2002, environmental activists Carlos and Diana Murillo filed an amparo
petition (constitutional challenge) against the resolution that granted Industrias
Infinito’s 2002 Concession on environmental grounds (the “Murillo Amparo”).

On 8 May 2002, Mr. Abel Pacheco took office as President of Costa Rica. On 5 June
2002, President Pacheco declared an indefinite moratorium on open-pit mining (the
“2002 Moratorium’).°' It is undisputed that the 2002 Moratorium operated
prospectively, and did not affect acquired (vested) rights.°?

On 12 August 2002, Rio Minerales S.A. filed an amparo petition against the 2002
Moratorium, arguing that it violated the principles of legality, judicial certainty and non-
retroactivity, as well as its vested rights. On 20 August 2002, the Constitutional
Chamber of the Supreme Court declared that the 2002 Moratorium did not violate the
petitioner's rights and was not retroactive in light of its grandfathering provision.**

The Claimant alleges that this decision confirmed that Industrias Infinito’s rights (in
particular, the 2002 Concession) were not affected by the 2002 Moratorium.*
Despite this, the SETENA had not yet ruled on Industrias Infinito’s EIA, which had
been requested in March 2002. For this reason, on 10 March 2003, Industrias Infinito
filed an amparo petition requesting the Constitutional Chamber to compel the
SETENA to issue its decision on Industrias Infinito’s ElA.*°

The next day, on 11 March 2003, the SETENA denied approval of the EIA, on the
grounds that it required a declaration by the Executive that the project was in the
national interest, which was lacking, and that the request showed certain technical
deficiencies.*° However, it did not disclose the reports which had served as the basis
for its conclusions. As a result, on that same day Industrias Infinito appealed this
decision before the MINAE.°” The MINAE agreed with Industrias Infinito, and on
20 October 2003 ordered the SETENA to conduct a new evaluation of Industrias
Infinito’s application.*®

Industrias Infinito also filed on 21 April 2003 a second amparo petition with the
Constitutional Chamber against the SETENA for violation of due process, requesting
disclosure of the reports.*® The Constitutional Chamber ultimately agreed with
Industrias Infinito and, on 25 August 2004, it compelled the SETENA to provide
copies of any internal and external assessments of the EIA.*°

In the meantime, on 4 April 2003, the Claimant filed its first Notice of Dispute with the
Ministry of Commerce.*

On 26 November 2004, the Constitutional Chamber granted the Murillo Amparo.
Specifically, it held that Industrias Infinito’s 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the
Constitution, which guarantees the right to a healthy and ecologically balanced
environment, because that concession was granted prior to the approval of the EIA.
It thus annulled the 2002 Concession, “todo sin perjuicio de lo que determine el
estudio de impacto ambiental,"** which the Respondent translates as “without
prejudice to what the environmental impact assessment may determine,” while the
Claimant translates as “without prejudice to the findings of the Environmental Impact
Assessment.”“4

On 3 June 2005, the Claimant filed its first Request for Arbitration (“2005 RFA”).
On 12 December 2005, the SETENA approved Industrias Infinito’s EIA.“
In May 2006, President Oscar Arias took office.

On 4 December 2006, Industrias Infinito filed a request for clarification concerning the
decision of 26 November 2004, asking the Constitutional Chamber to confirm that the
annulment of the 2002 Concession had been “relative” as opposed to “absolute” and
therefore subject to cure (saneamiento).*°

On 7 June 2007, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court concluded that
the requested clarification was a matter of administrative law and that it had no

jurisdiction to opine on it, but clarified that the only prerequisite for granting the
concession was the approval of the ElA.*”

On 31 October 2007, the MINAE granted Mr. Pacheco’s 2002 challenge against
Industrias Infinito’s 2002 Concession, on the basis of the Constitutional Chambers’
2004 finding that the 2002 Concession violated Article 50 of the Constitution.®

On 1 January 2008, the new Code of Contentious Administrative Procedure (which
created the Contentious Administrative Tribunal (“TCA”)) entered into force.“°

On 4 February 2008, the SETENA approved a revised EIA.°°

On 18 March 2008, President Arias issued a decree repealing the 2002 Moratorium,
which entered into force on 4 June 2008.°"

On 21 April 2008, President Arias and the MINAE granted Industrias Infinito an
exploitation concession (the “2008 Concession”, also referred to simply as the
“Concession’), using the administrative law concept of “conversion” (i.e., the previous
annulled concession is converted into a valid one). The Parties agree that the
applicable concept is conversion, but dispute its legal effect.‘

On 13 October 2008, President Arias designated the Las Crucitas Project as one of
national interest.°*

On 17 October 2008, the National System of Areas Conservation (“SINAC”)
authorized the logging of trees on the land of the Las Crucitas Project.®* Industrias
Infinito commenced logging the same day.*>

authenticity of Exh. C-0167 (R-Mem. Jur., § 68), the Claimant’s witness Mr. Hernandez
explained that this was a digital version that he had obtained from the MINAE and that he was
unaware that it might not have been the final version (CWS-Hernandez 2, 3-9). Thereafter,
the Claimant appears to accept that the official version of the resolution is the one provided by
the Respondent, i.e., Exh. R-0079 (see, e.g., C-Rej. Jur., 9 61 and n. 140). The Tribunal thus
understands that the Parties agree that the correct version of this document is Exh. R-0079.

The NGO FECON filed a similar amparo petition somewhat later on 23 October
2008.5”

On 20 October 2008, the Constitutional Chamber issued a temporary injunction
suspending the forest-clearing operations, the execution of the Las Crucitas Project,
and the implementation of the decree declaring the project in the national interest. °°

In November 2008, Mr. Jorge Lobo and APREFLOFAS filed challenges before the
TCA requesting the annulment of various administrative acts, including:

a. The SETENA resolution declaring the environmental viability of the project.

b. The SETENA resolution approving the modification of the Las Crucitas Project.
c. The MINAE resolution granting the 2008 Concession.

d. The Executive Decree declaring the project in the national interest.*°

The petitioners also requested the TCA to order Industrias Infinito and Costa Rica to
restore the site and provide compensation for environmental damage.

On 16 April 2010, the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court denied
UNOVIDA’s and FECON’s amparo petitions and lifted the injunction against forest-
clearing operations (the “2010 Constitutional Chamber Decision”). The decision did
not refer to the impact of the 2002 Moratorium.®

Also on 16 April 2010, the TCA issued its own temporary injunction preventing the
Las Crucitas Project from moving forward.

On 29 April 2010, President Arias issued a decree declaring a new moratorium on
open-pit gold mining, which entered into force on 11 May 2010 (the “Arias Moratorium
Decree’”).®

On 8 May 2010, President Chinchilla took office. On that same day, President
Chinchilla issued a decree which expanded the Arias Moratorium Decree (the
“Chinchilla Moratorium Decree” and, together with the Arias Moratorium Decree, the
“2010 Moratorium” or “2010 Executive Moratorium”). In addition to prohibiting open-
pit gold mining, it prohibited all mining activities using cyanide and mercury in the
processing of ore.** The Chinchilla Moratorium Decree entered into force on 11 May
2010.

On 27 July 2010, President Chinchilla issued a letter acknowledging the 2010
Constitutional Chamber Decision and the possibility of Government liability if the 2008
Concession was cancelled.

Meanwhile, on 11 June 2010, environmental activists Carlos and Douglas Murillo filed
an amparo petition with the Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court on the
basis that Industrias Infinito’s Concession was in breach of the 2002 Moratorium.®
The Constitutional Chamber rejected this petition on 24 August 2010, on the grounds
that it lacked jurisdiction to review the legality of the exploitation concession (including
its conversion) and that of the related administrative acts.°”

On 24 November 2010, the TCA issued an oral summary of its decision on the
annulment request filed by Mr. Lobos and APREFLOFAS, declaring that all requests
for annulment had been granted (the “2010 TCA Decision”). The TCA issued its full
written decision on 14 December 2010, where, inter alia, it dismissed the res
judicata defense raised by Industrias Infinito and the Government,” and annulled
Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession together with related administrative decisions.”

As a result, the TCA ordered inter alia:

b. Industrias Infinito and the Government to facilitate the restoration of the site, with
the quantum of damages to be determined in a different TCA proceeding.”

c. The file to be transmitted to the prosecutor to determine whether criminal
proceedings should be initiated against Government officials (including President
Arias).

In December 2010, the Costa Rican legislature enacted an amendment to the Mining
Code with essentially the same scope as the Chinchilla Moratorium Decree (the
“2011 Legislative Moratorium”), which came into force on 10 February 2011. The
Claimant alleges that this moratorium “supplanted” the previous decrees,”° but the
Respondent asserts that it did not repeal the previous decrees; rather, it provided an
additional legislative safeguard against open-pit mining.’®

On 18 January 2011, Industrias Infinito filed a request for cassation of the 2010 TCA
Decision before the Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court, which had the
effect of staying the challenged decision.’”

declare that the 2010 TCA Decision was unconstitutional because it conflicted with
the Constitutional Chamber's earlier decisions, in particular the 2010 Constitutional
Chamber Decision.”®

area to be free of all mining rights.®* Costa Rica disputes this last fact.®

unconstitutionality challenge, holding that the challenge was inadmissible because
the Administrative Chamber had already issued its ruling (the “2013 Constitutional

PRELIMINARY MATTERS
Scope of this Decision

As agreed by the Parties prior to the First Session and reflected in Annex A to
Procedural Order No. 1, these proceedings have been bifurcated between jurisdiction

 

the amendment to the Mining Code (Exh. C-0238) states that it becomes effective on the date
of its publication, and the date of publication appears to have been 10 February 2011. In any

and merits. This Decision addresses the Respondent's objections to the jurisdiction
of the Centre and the competence of the Tribunal.

The Law Applicable to the Jurisdiction of the Tribunal

It is undisputed that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is governed by the ICSID Convention
and the BIT. The relevant provisions are quoted in Sections IV.B and IV.C infra.

Both Parties agree that the interpretation of the ICSID Convention and the BIT is
governed by the customary international law principles on treaty interpretation as
codified in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 (“VCLT”).

It is also undisputed that the Tribunal has the power to rule on its own jurisdiction.

Relevance of APREFLOFAS’s Non-Disputing Party Submission

Before addressing the Parties’ positions on jurisdiction, the Tribunal will address the
comments on jurisdiction made by the Asociacién Preservacionista de Flora y Fauna
Silvestre (“‘APREFLOFAS’) in its Non-Disputing Party Submission.

a. APREFLOFAS’s Submission

APREFLOFAS, who was one of the plaintiffs in the proceedings that culminated with
the 2010 TCA Decision, asserts that Industrias Infinito’s Concession “was always
illegal under the law of Costa Rica (as it applies to any party, foreign or not)” and
“granted through an evident and intentional disregard of the applicable laws, and, as
alleged by Prosecutors in cases before the Costa Rica Courts, likely through
corruption and graft.”®

In compliance with the Tribunal’s directions in Procedural Order No. 2, APREFLOFAS
has limited its submission to factual and legal material not mentioned by the Parties.
Specifically, it submits that (i) “the Concession was illegal under the laws of Costa
Rica,” and (ii) “Costa Rica courts have found that the events that led to the grant of
the Concession were so egregious as to be likely criminal,” leading to the prosecution
of various public officers involved in the granting of the Concession.®” In
APREFLOFAS's view, “[bJoth arguments should [...] lead this Tribunal to rule that it
does not have jurisdiction over Infinito’s claims under the rules of the ICSID, the BIT
and the prevailing view from several previous decisions by international investment
law tribunals.”

More specifically, APREFLOFAS alleges that the approval of Industrias Infinito’s
Concession “would have been impossible unless Infinito and the government officials

Submission”), § 2.

described the Concession in a fraudulent manner” and that “[bJoth Infinito Gold and
Government [oJfficials misrepresented the nature and scope of the Concession by
failing even to consider the real environmental consequences of the Concession,
illegally transforming a public road into a part of the private Concession and by the
invalid conversion of an already annulled administrative act.”*? According to
APREFLOFAS, this arises from the 2010 TCA Decision,°° the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision,*' a Prosecutor Office’s indictment, a trial order from a criminal
judge,°* and a (now annulled) criminal decision acquitting several defendants and
confirming the conviction of former Minister Roberto Dobles.% In particular,
APREFLOFAS alleges that the TCA found that “the decision to grant the permits was
part of a knowing and intentional conspiracy between public servants to disregard the
laws of Costa Rica,” and, as a result, prosecutions and/or sanctions have been
brought against several officials who were responsible for the grant of the
Concession, including former President Arias and former Minister of the Environment
Roberto Dobles.*° According to APREFLOFAS, this shows that “the Costa Rican
courts not only found that the grant of the Concession and the subsequent
‘conversion’ were illegal under Costa Rican Law, but also that there was sufficient
evidence to suggest the occurrence of criminal conduct under the Costa Rican
Criminal Code, such as malfeasance in office or official misconduct.”®

APREFLOFAS notes in particular that, in addition to the criminal investigations
initiated against the public officials involved, a criminal process for extortion
(concusi6n) was initiated against former President Oscar Arias due to an alleged
donation made by Infinito to former President Arias’s non-profit organization
Fundacion Arias Para La Paz. However, this process was abandoned (desestimado)
due to lack of sufficient evidence. APREFLOFAS points out however that, because
the termination (desestimacién) was solely based on the lack of evidence, if new
evidence is presented the case could be reopened.®”

APREFLOFAS further explains that the other criminal prosecutions proceeded to an
indictment, and that after the relevant hearings all of the indicted persons (with the

exception of former Minister Dobles) were acquitted, the court having found that there
was no criminal action because the officials had acted within their discretionary
powers.®° As to Minister Dobles, while he was acquitted for criminal action in the
issuance of Resolution No. R-217-2008-MINAE, he was found guilty of criminal
malfeasance in office for issuing Executive Decree No. 34801-MINAET (the decree
declaring that the Las Crucitas Project was in the national interest).°° However, the
trial court’s decision acquitting the public officials and convicting former Minister
Dobles was ultimately annulled on appeal and remanded for a new hearing. As of the
date of APREFLOFAS’s Submission, no decision on the remanded case had been
rendered. "°°

APREFLOFAS submits that the pending criminal proceedings and the facts upon
which they are based have a significant bearing on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, as
they will determine whether there was corruption and violation of Costa Rica’s
criminal law.'°' Relying on Metal-Tech, Inceysa and Fraport |, APREFLOFAS argues
that investment tribunals lack jurisdiction if the claimant violated the host State’s laws
in the process of its investment activities. APREFLOFAS notes that Article I(g) of
the BIT expressly defines investment as “any kind of asset owned or controlled either
directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an
investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of other Contracting Party in
accordance with the latter's laws [...].""°° Accordingly, for an investment to be
considered as such, it needs to have been “initiated and developed” in accordance
with the laws of Costa Rica.'°* For APREFLOFAS, this is not the case here, because
Industrias Infinito obtained an_ illegal concession through alleged criminal
collaboration with a number of public officers. As a result, APREFLOFAS submits
that this case is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which is limited to the protection of
legal investments controlled by the BIT.'°°

b. |The Respondent’s Comments on APREFLOFAS’s Submission

The Respondent alleges that its factual presentation and legal arguments are fully
supported by APREFLOFAS’s Submission. It notes, in particular, that the
APREFLOFAS’s Submission recognizes that the Concession was annulled by the
2010 TCA Decision, and that the Administrative Chamber denied a cassation request
against that decision after an extensive analysis of Industrias Infinito’s allegations. '°

The Respondent further asserts that APREFLOFAS’s Submission supports its
interpretations of domestic law and of the BIT relevant to its jurisdictional objections.
In particular, it agrees that Infinito’s claims amount to a mere disagreement with Costa
Rican courts on matters of domestic law, and that the BIT does not permit recourse to
arbitration where a party has sought and failed to obtain a remedy in domestic
courts. ©”

The Respondent also notes that, while APREFLOFAS urges the Tribunal to decline
jurisdiction to hear the case, its focus is different to the Respondent's, as it requests
the Tribunal to base its decision on the illegal nature of Industrias Infinito’s
Concession as a matter of domestic and international law. The Respondent finds this
difference in focus “hardly surprising,” given that the Tribunal had ordered
APREFLOFAS to limit its submission to factual and legal material not put forward by
the Parties. That said, the Respondent disagrees with the substance of
APREFLOFAS’s jurisdictional argument. Specifically, it states:

[...] Costa Rica does not believe that the evidence available to date is
sufficient to sustain such a jurisdictional objection, ie., that the entirety of
Infinito’s investment was procured through fraud, corruption or other
malfeasance such that it fails to qualify as a bona fide investment under
the BIT and the ICSID Convention. As the summary provided by
APREFLOFAS shows, the numerous investigations of public officials for
corruption and other crimes in relation to the granting of the 2008
Concession are either still ongoing or have resulted in dismissal of the
charges. '°°

Despite this, the Respondent considers that the evidence provided by APREFLOFAS
could be relevant for the Tribunal, especially if the case were to proceed to the merits,
where the Tribunal would have to review in greater detail the nature of Infinito’s rights
and the manner in which they were obtained.‘

c. The Claimant’s Comments on APREFLOFAS’s Submission

The Claimant contends that APREFLOFAS'’s allegations are factually and legally
unfounded. First, it points out that neither Infinito nor any of its representatives,

135.

personnel or advisors, has ever been found liable for, or even charged with,
intentional wrongdoing. The Claimant also denies having purposefully omitted or
concealed information from the Costa Rican Government in connection with the
Concession or the ElA.""!

Second, there have been no conclusive findings of wrongdoing against any Costa
Rican officials in connection with actions related to the Las Crucitas Project. In any
event, the only charges were for the technical misapplication of Costa Rican law
(delito de prevaricato); and corruption has never been an issue. Not a single Costa
Rican official has been convicted or charged with corruption. As to the charges for
prevaricato, there have been no convictions of public officials. In particular, the
conviction of former Minister Dobles was annulled due to a flawed procedure, and a
new proceeding is pending. '!?

In any event, the Claimant argues that Costa Rica cannot be shielded from the
protections of the BIT by the wrongdoing of its own officials. Relying on RDC,
Fraport | and Kardassopoulos, among others, the Claimant submits that “[ijt is well-
established that states cannot rely on their own wrong-doing to defeat jurisdiction.”"'
According to the Claimant “illegality only undermines BIT protections where the
illegality is a result of intentional and serious wrongdoing by the investor, in deliberate
evasion of domestic law,” which is not the case here.'"*

d. Discussion

APREFLOFAS argues that this Tribunal should decline jurisdiction because the
Claimant’s investment has not been made in accordance with Costa Rican law.
Specifically, it argues that “the Concession was illegal under the laws of Costa Rica,”
and “Costa Rica courts have found that the events that led to the grant of the
Concession were so egregious as to be likely criminal.”'5 In this context, it alleges
that the public officials involved in the granting of the Concession intentionally violated
the law, leading to criminal proceedings for malfeasance in office (prevaricato),
although it recognizes that these proceedings are still pending. APREFLOFAS also

alleges that the Concession was procured through extortion (concusidn), noting that
criminal proceedings were initiated against former President Arias, although it accepts
that these proceedings were terminated for lack of evidence. On the basis of Article
\(g) of the BIT, which contains a legality requirement, APREFLOFAS submits that the
Claimant’s investment is not owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican law,
and as a result this Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear Infinito’s claims.

Notably, both the Claimant and the Respondent disagree with APREFLOFAS. The
Claimant adamantly denies that its investment was established in violation of Costa
Rican law, and in particular, it denies that there is any evidence of corruption or
intentional serious wrongdoing on its part. The Respondent, for its part, expressly
recognizes that the evidence available to date is insufficient to argue that “the entirety
of Infinito’s investment was procured through fraud, corruption or other malfeasance
such that it fails to qualify as a bona fide investment under the BIT and the ICSID
Convention.”""®

The Tribunal has noted the Parties’ positions. However, the legality requirement
contained in the BIT impacts the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, which the Tribunal has a duty
to assess ex officio, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 41(2). As a result, the
Tribunal cannot merely rely on the Parties’ assessment and must engage in its own
inquiry on the basis of the evidence in the record. This is particularly true when there
are allegations of corruption, which is a matter of international public policy.

Article I(g) of the BIT defines “investment” as “any kind of asset owned or controlled
either directly, or indirectly through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by
an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party in
accordance with the latter's laws [...].”"'"7. Hence, to be protected under the BIT, an
investment must have been at the very least established in accordance with Costa
Rican law (the provision could also be understood as requiring that the ownership and
control must be exercised in accordance with Costa Rican law, a matter on which the
Parties have not commented and that can remain open at this juncture).

In the Tribunal’s view, not every violation of domestic law will preclude the investment
from benefitting from the substantive protections of the BIT. However, APREFLOFAS
submits that the Concession was acquired through extortion or through intentional
and/or non-trivial violations of Costa Rican law (malfeasance in office). At this stage
and on the current record, the Tribunal cannot dismiss these allegations outright.
While it has found no clear concrete evidence of malfeasance in office or extortion,
the allegations are serious and the Tribunal cannot ignore that criminal proceedings
have been initiated against public officials for these charges. It therefore defers this
matter to the merits phase when further briefing and evidence may be submitted.

140.

141.

142.

143.

Even in the absence of intentional wrongdoing, APREFLOFAS alleges that the
Concession was obtained in violation of Costa Rican law, and the alleged violations
do not appear to be trivial. Under Article I(g) of the BIT, to determine whether Infinito
has made an investment that is protected under the BIT, the Tribunal must assess
each of these allegations. However, whether the Concession was illegally granted is
intertwined with the merits. Indeed, as this argument was raised by APREFLOFAS
and not by the Parties, the latter have not addressed it in depth and will thus be given
an opportunity to do so during the merits phase. The Tribunal thus finds it
procedurally efficient to defer this matter to the merits phase.

JURISDICTION UNDER THE ICSID CONVENTION

Jurisdiction under the ICSID Convention is governed by Article 25(1), which reads as
follows:

The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to any legal dispute arising
directly out of an investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to
the Centre by that State) and a national of another Contracting State,
which the parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to the Centre.
When the parties have given their consent, no party may withdraw its
consent unilaterally.

Accordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the following
conditions must be met:

a. There must be a legal dispute.
b. That dispute must arise directly out of an investment.

Cc. The dispute must be between a Contracting State (or any constituent subdivision
or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State.

d. The parties to the dispute must have consented in writing to submit the dispute to
the Centre. Once given, this consent may not be withdrawn unilaterally.

The Respondent does not challenge conditions (a) to (c). It is thus undisputed — and
rightly so — that the present case concerns a “legal dispute arising directly out of an
investment between a Contracting State [...] and a national of another Contracting
State [...].”. The Respondent's objections to jurisdiction all relate to its consent to
arbitrate, required under condition (d) above and allegedly given in Article XII of the
BIT.

144.

JURISDICTION UNDER THE BIT

Article XII of the BIT reads as follows:

ARTICLE XIl

Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the Host
Contracting Party

Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a
measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the
extent possible, be settled amicably between them.

If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six
months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted
by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). The
investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate:

(a)
(o

that it is an investor as defined by Article | of this Agreement;

that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is
in breach of this Agreement; and

(c) that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach.

For the purpose of this Agreement, a dispute is considered to be
initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered
notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a
measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:

(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;

(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in
breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the
Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement
procedure of any kind;

(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which
the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired,
knowledge of the alleged breach and knowledge that the
investor has incurred loss or damage; and

(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no
judgement has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding
the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.

The dispute may be submitted to arbitration under:

(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID), established pursuant to the Convention on
the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of other States, opened for signature at Washington
D.C. on 18 March, 1965 (‘ICSID Convention’), if both the
disputing Contracting Party and the Contracting Party of the
investor are parties to the ICSID Convention;

34

or

(b) the Additional Facility Rules of ICSID, if either the disputing
Contracting Party or the Contracting Party of the investor, but
not both, is a party to the ICSID Convention; or

(c) an ad hoc arbitration tribunal established under the Arbitration
Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL) in case neither Contracting Party is a member
of ICSID, or if ICSID declines jurisdiction.

Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the
submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.

(a) The consent given under paragraph (5), together with either the
consent given under paragraph (3), or any relevant provision of
Annex II, shall satisfy the requirements for:

(i) written consent of the parties to a dispute for purposes of
Chapter II (Jurisdiction of the Centre) of the ICSID
Convention and for purposes of the Additional Facility Rules;
and

(ii) an ‘agreement in writing’ for purposes of Article II of the
United Nations Convention for the Recognition and
Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York,
June 10, 1958 (‘New York Convention’).

(b) Any arbitration under this Article shall be held in a State that is a
party to the New York Convention, and claims submitted to
arbitration shall be considered to arise out of a commercial
relationship or transaction for the purposes of Article | of that
Convention.

A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in
dispute in accordance with this Agreement, the applicable rules of
international law, and with the domestic law of the host State to the
extent that the domestic law is not inconsistent with the provisions of
this Agreement or the principles of international law.

An investor of one Contracting Party may seek interim injunctive
relief, not involving the payment of damages, before the judicial or
administrative tribunals of the Contracting Party that is a party to the
dispute, according to the latter's domestic legislation, prior to the
institution of the arbitral proceeding.

A tribunal may award, separately or in combination, only:

(a)
(b)

monetary damages and any applicable interest;

restitution of property, in which case the award shall provide
that the disputing Contracting Party may pay monetary
damages and any applicable interest in lieu of restitution.

A tribunal may also award costs in accordance with the applicable

Overview of the Parties’ Positions

a. Overview of the Respondent's Position

As noted above, the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction relate to the scope of
Costa Rica’s consent to arbitration under the BIT.'1®

As a general matter, the Respondent submits that the Claimant's case is “simply a
rehash of arguments already considered — and unambiguously rejected — by multiple
levels of Costa Rica’s judicial system.”"'? The Claimant's entire case rests on a single
premise: the annulment of the 2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision. While
the Claimant purports to be challenging subsequent acts by other Costa Rican
judicial, executive and administrative organs, it is apparent from its submissions that
its central claim is about the loss of the 2008 Concession, which was annulled by the
2010 TCA Decision. Because the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to hear a claim based on
the 2010 TCA Decision, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
hear the Claimant’s case. Specifically, the Respondent puts forward the following
reasons:

First, the Respondent submits that the claims are barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the
BIT, which excludes claims if a “judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court
regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement”:'2°

a. While the Claimant purports to challenge other acts by the Costa Rican judicial,
executive and administrative organs, its complaint is directed to the effects of the
2010 TCA Decision, and as such this is the act that should be deemed to be the
relevant “measure” in this case. As in 2011, the Administrative Chamber of the
Supreme Court has already rendered a decision on the 2010 TCA Decision, the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear the Claimant's claims.

b. Even if one were to consider that the relevant measure is the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision (which the Respondent denies), the latter submits that “there
exist multiple judgments of Costa Rican courts related to that measure within the
meaning of BIT Article XII(3)(d),” in particular because “the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Judgment is itse/f a judgment of a Costa Rican court and is inextricably
related to another judgment of a Costa Rican court, i.e. the 2010 TCA
Judgment.”'21 As a result, “Article XII(3)(d) must [...] be understood to preclude

149.

any challenge either to the 2010 TCA Judgment or to the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Judgment, especially given that the challenge is ultimately based on a
disagreement with the legal conclusions reached by the Costa Rican courts on
matters of domestic law.” 1

c. Likewise, all of the other measures of which the Claimant complains “(a) are
nothing more than vehicles for Claimant's indirect challenge to the 2010 TCA
Judgment, and (b) constitute acts regarding which the Costa Rican judiciary has
already rendered judgment, and are therefore beyond the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
pursuant to Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.”"75

The Respondent acknowledges however that the Claimant seeks to challenge the
following measures:'*

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which upheld the 2010 TCA
Decision.

b. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which denied a separate challenge
on constitutional grounds against the 2010 TCA Decision.

c. The 2012 MINAE Resolution, which executed the 2010 TCA Decision’s order to
cancel the 2008 Concession and remove it from the Mining Registry.

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium consolidating the open-pit mining ban
implemented in 2010 through the 2010 Executive Moratorium, which the Claimant
alleges deprived it of the right to seek a new concession after its existing
concession was annulled by the 2010 TCA Decision. '*

Second, the Respondent contends that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae
to consider Infinito’s claims because “they amount to no more than assertions that
Costa Rica’s judicial authorities incorrectly applied Costa Rican law.”'?° Further,
“[t]his Tribunal is not a court of appeals on matters of domestic law; it may only
consider claims that arise under international law, and more particularly under the
Canada-Costa Rica BIT.”'?” The Claimant's disagreement with the Costa Rican
courts’ decisions on matters of domestic law “cannot serve to magically transform

which quantified the liability for environmental remediation imposed by the 2010 TCA
Decision, but the Claimant has withdrawn its challenge against this decision. C-CM Jur., ] 44;
R-Reply Jur., § 11.

Initially the Respondent appears to consider that the Claimant is also challenging the 2010
Executive Moratorium issued by presidential decrees in 2010 (R-Mem. Jur., § 4), but in later
submissions it appears to acknowledge that the Claimant is challenging only the 2011
Legislative Moratorium. R-Reply Jur., § 9(d).

R-Mem. Jur., § 12.
R-Mem. Jur., § 12 (emphasis in original).

150.

[Infinito’s] complaint from a purely domestic-law argument to a legitimate claim under
international law (whether for ‘expropriation,’ breach of ‘fair and equitable treatment,’
‘denial of justice,’ or anything else),” because ‘[a]ll of these standards require
evidence of fundamental failures of justice that go well beyond mere disagreement
with a court’s reasoning.” And while the Claimant does allege that it faced a
fundamental failure by the Costa Rican judicial system to reconcile allegedly
conflicting rulings, this alleged inconsistency was already raised before and
addressed by the Costa Rican courts. 12°

Third, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis, i.e.
that the claims are time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations contained in
Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT.'*° According to the Respondent, “much of Claimant's case
depends on challenges to measures that predate 6 February 2011,” which the
Claimant accepts is the cutoff date for purposes of assessing the applicability of this
provision (the dispute having been submitted to arbitration on 6 February 2014).'9!
More specifically:

a. The Respondent contends that “the main pillars of Claimant's arguments about
Costa Rican law were thoroughly rejected by the 2010 TCA Judgment, which was
officially rendered on 14 December 2010, as well as by earlier decisions of the
Constitutional Chamber that Claimant either ignores or plainly misrepresents.”'?
However, this Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione temporis to review the
substantive correctness of any of these court decisions, and “[iJt would also be
improper for the Tribunal to find that later-occurring judicial or administrative acts
that merely left in place or applied the 2010 TCA Judgment to constitute
independently justiciable breaches of the BIT.”"%°

b. Nor can the Claimant escape the “fatal implications of the statute of limitations”
for its claim related to the 2010 Moratorium: although Infinito focuses on the
mining code amendment (or 2011 Legislative Moratorium) adopted in late 2010
and effective from 10 February 2011 (i.e., within the limitation period), it ignores
the fact that the 2010 Moratorium was already in force as a result of two earlier
presidential decrees. ‘4

152.

Fourth, the Respondent contends that even if the Claimant attempts to focus on
actions taken after 6 February 2011, the claims are barred under Section Ill(1) of
Annex | of the BIT. This is because the actions challenged by the Claimant merely
maintain or enforce earlier measures that were designed to ensure that investment in
the territory of Costa Rica is undertaken in a manner sensitive to environmental
concerns. Such actions are exempt from review by an international arbitral tribunal
under Section III(1) of Annex | of the BIT, so long as the underlying “measures” are
“otherwise consistent” with the BIT."

Fifth, the Respondent argues that the Claimant has failed to present a prima facie
case that there has been a breach of the BIT’s provisions on fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”) (Article Il(a)), full protection and security (Article II(b)), or
expropriation (Article VIII):

a. With respect to the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, under the relevant
BIT provisions the Claimant must prove that the judicial acts challenged amount
to a denial of justice, which it has failed to do. Nor could the Claimant have
acquired any legitimate expectations from the 2010 Constitutional Chamber
Decision that could later have been violated by the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision. 3°

b. With respect to the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, the Claimant appears
to recognize that the rejection of its unconstitutionality complaint was based on
valid procedural grounds. And while it complains of the time that it took to
resolve the case, it does not claim prejudice or damage arising from the delay.'9”

c. With respect to the 2012 MINAE Resolution, the Claimant “fails to present an
intelligible theory for how this Resolution went beyond the 2010 TCA Judgment,
which expressly ordered MINAE to expunge the concession from the Mining
Registry,” nor has it shown that this decision cancelled any of the Claimant’s
additional rights. °°

d. Similarly, the 2015 TCA Damages Decision simply implemented the 2010 TCA
Decision by imposing joint liability on the defendants for environmental
remediation of the Las Crucitas site. The Claimant does not argue that this
decision violated Costa Rican law or was inconsistent with the 2010 TCA
Decision. Nor does it claim any damage arising from that decision. '%

e. As to the ban on open pit-mining, the Claimant has not alleged that the 2011
Legislative Moratorium or the executive decrees that preceded it were illegal or
improperly implemented as a matter of Costa Rican law. In addition, while these

155.

decrees precluded the granting of new mining rights, the Claimant has not
explained how they could have infringed on any right already held by Infinito
(indeed, the Costa Rican courts had found that these decrees did not violate the
petitioners’ acquired rights). Nor has the Claimant shown that it would have been
entitled to obtain a new concession and all the necessary permits to develop the
Las Crucitas Project in the absence of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium.'4°

Sixth, the Respondent submits that none of the five “measures” expressly challenged
by the Claimant were the cause of the damage that it asserts in this arbitration. As a
result, they cannot give rise to a dispute within the meaning of the dispute settlement
provisions in the BIT, which repeatedly refer to the investor's obligation to specify how
it “has incurred loss or damage” as a result of the asserted breach. The Respondent
notes in this regard that Infinito has asserted that its investment had lost its entire
value by November 2011, prior to three of the measures of which it complains. As to
the remaining two measures (the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the
2011 Legislative Moratorium), they could not have caused the damage alleged by the
Claimant.'*"

Seventh, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to comply with the
BIT’s mandatory conditions on the submission of the dispute to arbitration with
respect to the 2015 TCA Damages Decision (which had not even been issued when
the Claimant submitted this dispute to arbitration). Such conditions include a pre-
notification of the dispute to Costa Rica at least six months prior to the initiation of the
arbitration under Article XII(2) of the BIT, and express consent to arbitration and
waiver of the right to domestic law remedies under Article XII(3) of the BIT no later
than the submission of the Request for Arbitration. According to the Respondent,
‘[t]his Tribunal’s jurisdiction is to be assessed as of the time of submission of the
Request to Arbitration, and does not extend to any and all disputes that might arise
subsequent to that date[.]’'4?

Eighth, the Respondent submits that the “Claimant cannot circumvent any of the
jurisdictional flaws described above by selective importation of clauses from Costa
Rica’s investment treaties with third States through the Most Favored Nation (MFN)
clause contained in Article IV of the BIT.” According to the Respondent, “[t]he MFN
clause of the BIT does not provide a license to disregard treaty provisions that were
specifically negotiated and ratified as a package deal by Canada and Costa Rica,” in

R-Mem. Jur., § 25(d).
R-Mem. Jur., 1§ 26-28.

R-Mem. Jur., § 29. Subsequently to this submission, and in light of the Claimant’s withdrawal
of the claim concerning the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, the Respondent stated it was
reducing its objections to jurisdiction to seven, thereby eliminating the objection directed
specifically at the 2015 TCA Damages Decision claim. R-Reply Jur., § 11. During the Hearing
on Jurisdiction, the Respondent explained, however, that “it want[ed] to make sure that the
Tribunal understands that the Claimant cannot claim to withdraw the measure or the claim,
rather, and then, after the jurisdictional objections, assuming that we even get to the merits
stage, that they will somehow revive that measure.” Tr. Day 1 (ENG), 160:16-22 (Mr. Grané).

R-Mem. Jur., § 30.

157.

particular as Infinito has failed to identify any third party investor who has been
accorded more favorable treatment in like circumstances.’ A majority of investment
tribunals have found that MFN clauses cannot modify the terms of a BIT’s dispute
resolution clause, especially in cases involving MFN clauses with similar wording as
the one at issue here, or where a claimant seeks to expand the scope of a State’s
consent to arbitration. The Respondent argues in this regard that most of the
provisions it invokes to challenge the jurisdiction of the Tribunal “are not procedural
pre-conditions to arbitration but rather provide clear substantive limits on the type of
dispute Costa Rica has consented to arbitrate,” and “[t]he Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to
go beyond the limits of such consent.”"45

b. Overview of the Claimant’s Position

As a general matter, the Claimant argues that the Respondent impermissibly attempts
to re-characterize Infinito’s case, and that the Respondent's objections are directed to
that reformulated case, not to the case that the Claimant has brought.'“®

The Claimant recalls that in this arbitration it is challenging the following four
measures:

a. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges
confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision, “thereby rendering final and irreversible the
annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental approvals, the
declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the land use change
permit.”"47

b. The 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which Infinito alleges declined to
resolve, on admissibility grounds, the conflict between its earlier decision
upholding the constitutionality of the Las Crucitas Project approvals and the 2010
TCA Decision. '*

c. The 2012 MINAE Resolution, which Infinito alleges cancelled the 2008
Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito’s mining rights from the mining
registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber. '4°

Resolution.

159.

160.

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium on open-pit mining, which the Claimant alleges
replaced the 2010 Executive Moratorium, prohibiting Industrias Infinito from
applying for new permits. °°

According to the Claimant, “[iJt is the combined operation of these four measures [...]
that meant that Industrias Infinito definitively could no longer pursue the development
of the Crucitas project.”'*' More particularly, the Claimant submits that the composite
result of these measures breached the BIT in four ways:

a. It expropriated the Claimant's investments by definitively precluding Infinito from
building and operating the Crucitas gold mine. '*

b. It breached Costa Rica’s obligation to provide FET to Infinito’s investments, by
violating its legitimate expectations and denying both procedural and substantive
justice to Infinito.1°

¢. It failed to grant Infinito’s investments full protection and security.

d. It breached two substantive obligations imported into the BIT through the BIT’s
MFN clause from other bilateral investment treaties signed by Costa Rica: (i)
Costa Rica’s obligation to do “what is necessary” to protect Infinito’s investments,
imported from the Costa Rica-France bilateral investment treaty, and (ii) the
“umbrella clause” requiring Costa Rica to “comply with [or observe] any obligation
assumed regarding investments of investors of the other Contracting Party,”
found in Costa Rica’s bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and Korea.'®>

On this basis, the Claimant submits that the Respondent's objections to jurisdiction
must fail for the following reasons:

First, there is no merit to the Respondent’s argument that Infinito’s case is “really” a
challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision, and that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is excluded
under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT because a Costa Rican court has rendered a
judgment with respect to that measure. “It is the investor's prerogative to allege and
formulate its claims as it sees fit,"° and the Respondent cannot reformulate them.
Here, the Claimant is challenging the four measures listed above, and in particular the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which is the measure that rendered Infinito’s
investments substantially worthless. Neither this decision, nor the other measures
challenged by Infinito have been the subject of the judgment of a Costa Rican

163.

court.” According to the Claimant, “Costa Rica ignores the ordinary meaning,
context and purpose of Article XII(3)(d),” which “encourages the pursuit (though does
not require exhaustion) of local remedies while insulating lower domestic judicial
decisions from being challenged under the BIT.”'®® In addition, the Respondent's
interpretation would “gut the investor protections in the BIT by allowing Costa Rica to
shield its measures from challenge merely by ensuring that a judgment of a Costa
Rican court was generated regarding that measure.”'®°

Second, the Claimant contends that the Respondent impermissibly attempts to
reframe its claims so that they fall outside of the three-year limitation period set out in
Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT. The Claimant reiterates that the focus must be on the
claims as it has pleaded them, not as re-characterized by the Respondent. The
Respondent also ignores the plain wording of the provision: Article XII(3)(c) bars a
claim only if three years have elapsed from the time at which the Claimant first
acquired (or should have first acquired) (i) knowledge of the alleged breach and (ii)
knowledge that it has sustained loss or damage. The breaches of the BIT did not
crystallize until the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, at the earliest, because it
was after this decision that Infinito’s investments in Costa Rica became substantially
worthless. As a result, the limitation period did not begin to run before November
2011 at the earliest, and accordingly Infinito’s claims were brought on time.'©°

Third, the Respondent distorts the meaning of Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT. This
provision only applies to measures “otherwise consistent” with the BIT, i.e., measures
that do not breach other substantive BIT protections. The Respondent's interpretation
undermines the object and purpose of the BIT, which is investment protection.'*' In
addition, the provision only applies to measures sensitive to environmental concerns,
and the Claimant contends that the measures it challenges were not motivated by
bona fide environmental concerns. In particular, “[t]he exploitation concession and
other project approvals were annulled on the basis of the technical application of the
2002 moratorium to the project after the project was deemed environmentally sound
by all competent authorities in Costa Rica and by the Constitutional Chamber,” and
that “[t]he Costa Rican government and environmental authorities defended the
project's environmental soundness before Costa Rican courts.” As a result, Infinito
argues that the Respondent cannot invoke Annex |, Section III(1).

Fourth, while purporting to require the Tribunal to assess whether Infinito has made a
prima facie case on the merits, the Respondent is in fact asking the Tribunal to
determine the merits of the dispute and thus to determine contentious issues of fact
and law that are inappropriate at the jurisdictional stage. According to the Claimant,

C-CM Jur., J 19.

C-CM Jur., § 22.

C-CM Jur., Jf] 23-24.

C-CM Jur., § 25.

C-CM Jur., § 26 (emphasis in original).

43

“[a] prima facie analysis requires the Tribunal to accept the facts pleaded as true and
assess whether they could support a claim for breach of the BIT.” The Claimant
asserts that it “has demonstrated Costa Rica’s breaches of the BIT on a balance of
probabilities,” and has thus “more than met its burden to establish prima facie
breaches of the BIT.”"* Specifically:

a. With respect to the FET standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT:

The Claimant argues that no investment tribunal has ever dismissed a claim
for breach of the FET standard because the claimant failed to show a prima
facie case. This is because the determination of the standard is fact-specific
and flexible, and must be assessed in the context of the facts and evidence,
which are a matter for the merits.

In any event, the Claimant rejects the Respondent's argument that the FET
standard of the BIT is equivalent to the minimum standard of treatment under
customary international law (“MST”), and argues that it would be premature
for the Tribunal to determine this question during the jurisdictional phase.

Whether the FET standard is autonomous or limited to the MST, the
Claimant contends that it has “demonstrated that its claims are capable of
breaching the FET standard in Article II(2)(a),” and therefore it has
established a prima facie case that this provision was breached:'®

. With respect to its legitimate expectations claim, the Claimant argues
that the Government provided repeated assurances to Infinito, upon
which Infinito reasonably relied for more than a decade in deciding to
continue investing in the Las Crucitas Project.’ Specifically,
“Industrias Infinito was granted an exploration permit, an exploitation
concession, and several other permits and approvals over the course of
the project's life,” and “[a]t each step, it was encouraged and induced to
continue investing in the project.’"®’ The Claimant further alleges that
“[t]he legality of the Crucitas project’s exploitation concession and
approvals was confirmed in multiple judicial decisions including by the
country’s highest court." That after “these repeated and far-reaching
assurances” “the Administrative Chamber retroactively applied the 2002
moratorium, nine years after it was adopted, and after Infinito had spent
millions developing and building the project in reliance on its mining
rights and that the 2002 moratorium did not apply to its project,”

amounts to a breach of the Claimant's legitimate expectations,
regardless of whether the standard is autonomous or limited to the
MST. 18

. Likewise, the Claimant submits that it has made a prima facie case of a

procedural and substantive denial of justice. Procedurally, the Claimant
contends that the Respondent denied justice to Infinito by failing to
provide a legal system capable of protecting Infinito’s investments,
because it lacked a mechanism to resolve the inconsistency between
the decisions of different chambers of the Supreme Court.
Substantively, the Claimant argues that the Administrative Chamber
denied justice to Infinito by incorrectly and retroactively applying the
2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession and other project
approvals. '°

With respect to expropriation, the Claimant contends that it has demonstrated
both on a balance of probabilities and on a prima facie basis that Costa Rica
expropriated its investments both directly and indirectly.'7' In particular, the
Claimant advances the following arguments:

The sole effects doctrine applies to judicial expropriations in the same
manner as it does to other expropriatory measures. '”

Costa Rica cannot argue that the Administrative Chamber was applying the
2002 Moratorium as a defense. This amounts to arguing that Costa Rica
legitimately exercised its police powers, but this defense is not available to
Costa Rica because the application of the 2002 Moratorium was neither
necessary nor proportionate to any legitimate objective and was in breach of
the FET standard.’

Compliance with domestic law is not a defense to expropriation, particularly
where the domestic law in question (the 2002 Moratorium) post-dates the
investment. ‘74

A court decision that applies domestic law may be expropriatory where the
domestic law applied is itself expropriatory or breaches a rule of international
law.'”> Here, the Claimant alleges that, as applied by the Administrative
Chamber, the 2002 Moratorium was in itself expropriatory.

v. The Respondent's argument that a denial of justice is a prerequisite for a
judicial measure to be expropriatory cannot succeed on a prima facie basis.

vi. The Claimant has established beyond a prima facie standard that it had
investments capable of being expropriated. The Respondent’s argument
that Infinito’s rights were not capable of expropriation because they were
deemed invalid by the 2011 Administrative Chamber Judgment should be
rejected: Infinito’s investments extended beyond the 2008 Concession and
other approvals annulled by the Administrative Chamber and were not
capable of being “invalidated” by it. In addition, the validity of the
Concession and other approvals must be assessed independently from the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, because this is the very measure
that the Claimant alleges breached the BIT. In any event, “Costa Rica is
estopped from asserting that the 2002 moratorium rendered Industrias
Infinito’s rights invalid when its own Constitutional Chamber and authorities
represented over the course of more than a decade that the moratorium did
not apply to the project.”'7°

c. Finally, the Claimant submits that it has established on a prima facie basis that
Costa Rica failed to provide full protection and security to its investments in
breach of Article !I(2)(b) of the BIT. The Claimant argues that the Tribunal need
not (and should not) definitively determine the scope of this provision at the
jurisdictional stage.'””

Fifth, the Claimant denies that its case is nothing more than an appeal from the
decisions of Costa Rican courts. This argument inaccurately characterizes and fails
to analyze the claims it has actually made. '7®

Sixth, the Claimant asserts that, contrary to the Respondent's contention, it has
demonstrated its damages case on a balance of probabilities and at the very least on
a prima facie basis.‘ Its losses crystallized on the date of the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision. In any event, it argues that “Infinito’s evidence must be accepted
as true for the purpose of the jurisdictional analysis,” and “[t]he question of the precise
date on which Infinito’s losses crystallized must be left for the merits” and is “irrelevant
to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.”'®° The Claimant also denies that it must prove separate
losses for the other measures that it challenges: these measures prevented Industrias
Infinito from obtaining a new exploitation concession and new project approvals, and

169.

thus operated in combination with the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision to
render Infinito’s investments substantially worthless. '°'

Seventh, the Claimant submits that, through the BIT’s MFN clause (Article IV), it is
entitled to benefit from the more favorable drafting of the dispute settlement
provisions found in the bilateral investment treaties signed by Costa Rica with Taiwan
and Korea, from which the preconditions set out in Article XII(3) are absent. The
Respondent's interpretation ignores the broad wording of Article IV of the BIT, which
includes more favorable substantive and procedural protections under other bilateral
investment treaties. Such interpretation also undermines the purpose of Article IV
and the investment protection purpose of the BIT as a whole. In addition, Article
XII(3) is an admissibility and not a jurisdictional provision, and as such does not
define the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, so the Respondent's concerns are inapplicable. '

Finally, although the Claimant withdraws its claim with respect to the 2015 TCA
Damages Decision because it is not final and binding on Industrias Infinito,"® it
reserves its right to challenge as an ancillary measure any future Administrative
Chamber decision that breaches the BIT. The Claimant argues that “[a]lthough the
Tribunal need not determine the issue at this stage, no new notice or amicable
settlement period would be required in respect of this claim because it arises from the
same subject-matter as the measures already challenged by Infinito.”"®

Jurisdictional Requirements under Article XII

The Parties dispute whether Article XII sets out only jurisdictional requirements, or
also admissibility requirements. The Respondent submits that all of the requirements
set out in Article XII are jurisdictional, because they establish the scope of Costa
Rica’s consent to arbitration. By contrast, the Claimant argues that the relevant
jurisdictional requirements are found in Article XII(2), in conjunction with Costa Rica’s
unilateral consent to arbitrate provided under Article XII(5), while those in Article XII(3)
are conditions for admissibility. '®

The Tribunal agrees with the Respondent that most (but not all) of the requirements in
Article XII are jurisdictional, as they determine the conditions under which Costa Rica
has consented to submit claims to arbitration. Jurisdictional requirements are
obviously first found in Article XII(1) of the BIT, read together with Article XII(2), which
provide as follows:

1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the
other Contracting Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a

measure taken or not taken by the former Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the
extent possible, be settled amicably between them.

2. If a dispute has not been settled amicably within a period of six
months from the date on which it was initiated, it may be submitted
by the investor to arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4). The
investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate:

(a)
(b)

that it is an investor as defined by Article | of this Agreement;

that the measure taken or not taken by the Contracting Party is
in breach of this Agreement; and

(c) that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach.

For the purpose of this Agreement, a dispute is considered to be
initiated when the investor of one Contracting Party has delivered
notice in writing to the other Contracting Party alleging that a
measure taken or not taken by the latter Contracting Party is in
breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.

170. For the Tribunal, not all of the conditions set out in these provisions go to its
jurisdiction. Only the following are jurisdictional requirements:

a. There must be a dispute (Article XII(1)). Read together with Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention, this dispute must be legal in nature.

b. The dispute must be between one Contracting Party to the BIT and an investor of
the other Contracting Party (Article XII(1)).

c. The dispute must relate to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not
taken by the host State is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)).

d. The dispute must also relate to a claim “that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach” (Article XII(1)).

e. A period of six months must have elapsed from the date on which a notice of
dispute has been delivered in accordance with the final paragraph of Article
XII(2)), during which the Parties must have attempted to settle the dispute
amicably, before the claim can be submitted to arbitration (Article XII(2)).'®”

171. By contrast, sub paragraphs (a) to (c) of Article XII(2) do not establish jurisdictional
requirements; they set out rules on burden of proof. Indeed, the provision states that
“[t]he investor will bear the burden of proof to demonstrate: (a) that it is an investor as
defined by Article | of this Agreement; (b) that the measure taken or not taken by the
Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement; and (c) that the investor has
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.” These rules on
burden of proof will thus apply whenever the relevant requirement needs to be

175.

proven, be it at the jurisdictional or at the merits stage. With respect to (a), the
investor must prove that it qualifies as an investor under the BIT during the
jurisdictional phase, because the condition of investor is necessary to establish
jurisdiction. By contrast, the conditions under (b) and (c) of Article XII(2) must be
proven at the merits stage.

Other requirements can be found in Article XII(3), which reads as follows:

3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:

(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;
(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach

of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting
Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;

S

not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of
the alleged breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss
or damage; and

(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgement
has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure
that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.

Article XII(3)(a) is clearly a jurisdictional requirement, as there can be no jurisdiction
without a party’s consent. Article XII(3)(b) is also jurisdictional in nature: the host
State has not consented to arbitrate if the investor has not waived its right to initiate or
continue other proceedings before the courts of the host State.

The Parties dispute whether the conditions set out in sub-paragraphs (c) and (d) of
Article XII(3) constitute jurisdictional requirements or go to admissibility. As explained
in Section IV.C.4.c infra, in what pertains to Article XII(3)(c) the Tribunal defers this
discussion to the merits phase, should it become relevant at that stage; and in what
pertains to Article XII(3)(d), the Tribunal observes that the matter is of no
consequence (Section IV.C.4.a(iii) infra).

Accordingly, for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction over this dispute, the following
conditions must be met:

a. There must be a dispute (Article XII(1)). Read together with Article 25(1) of the
ICSID Convention, this dispute must be legal in nature. The Parties agree (and
rightly so) that there is a legal dispute in this case.

b. The dispute must be between one Contracting Party to the BIT and an investor of
the other Contracting Party (Article XII(1)). Here, the dispute clearly involves one
Contracting Party (Costa Rica). The notion of “investor”, on the other hand, is
defined in Article I(h) as:

(i

) any natural person possessing the citizenship of one
Contracting Party who is not also a citizen of the other
Contracting Party; or

49

188

(ii) any enterprise as defined by paragraph (b) of this Article,
incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable
laws of one Contracting Party;

who owns or controls an investment made in the territory of the
other Contracting Party.

Article l(b) defines “enterprise” as:

(i) any entity constituted or organized under applicable law,
whether or not for profit, whether privately-owned or
governmentally-owned, including any corporation, _ trust,
partnership, sole proprietorship, joint venture or other
association; and

(ii) a branch of any such entity;

For further certainty, ‘business enterprise’ means any enterprise
which is constituted or organized in the expectation of economic
benefit or other business purposes.

In turn, Article I(g) defines “investment” as:

[..-] any kind of asset owned or controlled either directly, or indirectly
through an enterprise or natural person of a third State, by an
investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of the other
Contracting Party in accordance with the latter's laws and, in
particular, though not exclusively, includes:

(i) movable and immovable property and any related property
rights, such as mortgages, liens or pledges;

(ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of
participation in an enterprise;

(iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under
contract having a financial value;

(iv) goodwill;
(v) intellectual property rights;
(vi) rights, conferred by law or under contract, to undertake any

economic and commercial activity, including any rights to
search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources;

but does not mean real estate or other property, tangible or
intangible, not acquired in the expectation or used for the purpose of
economic benefit or other business purposes.

For further certainty, investment does not mean, claims to money
that arise solely from:

(i) commercial contracts for the sale of goods or services by a
national or enterprise in the territory of one Contracting Party to
a national or an enterprise in the territory of the other
Contracting Party; or

The Tribunal has omitted the additional definition regarding the term “natural person
possessing the citizenship of one Contracting Party" for Canada, as the Claimant is not a
natural person.

50

(ii) the extension of credit in connection with a commercial
transaction, such as trade financing, where the original maturity
of the loan is less than three years.

Without prejudice to subparagraph (ii) immediately above, a loan to
an enterprise where the enterprise is an affiliate of the investor shall
be considered an investment.
For the purpose of this Agreement, an investor shall be considered
to control an investment if the investor has the power to name a
majority of its directors or otherwise to legally direct the actions of
the enterprise which owns the investment.
Any change in the form of an investment does not affect its
character as an investment.
For greater clarity, returns shall be considered a component of
investment. For the purpose of this Agreement, "returns" means all
amounts yielded by an investment, as defined above, covered by
this Agreement and in particular, though not exclusively, includes
profits, interest, capital gains, dividends, royalties, fees or other
current income.

The Respondent does not dispute that the Claimant is an investor under this
definition. Indeed, it is undisputed that Infinito is an enterprise duly constituted in
accordance with the applicable laws of Canada, being incorporated in that
country. Nor does the Respondent dispute that Infinito owns or controls an
investment made in the territory of Costa Rica. The Claimant asserts that it owns
or controls the following assets in the territory of Costa Rica: “(i) its shares in
Industrias Infinito; (ii) the money it invested in Industrias Infinito through
intercompany loans; (iii) the exploitation concession; (iv) the pre-existing mining
rights underlying the exploitation concession; (v) the other approvals for the
Crucitas project; (vi) the physical assets associated with the project, including the
half-built mining infrastructure; and (vii) the intangible assets associated with the
project.”"° The Respondent does not contest this. However, as noted in
Section IV.A.3 supra, APREFLOFAS has argued that the Claimant's investment
was not obtained in accordance with Costa Rican law, and therefore does not
meet the definition of investment at Article I(g) of the BIT. As explained in that
same Section, the Tribunal has deferred this matter to the merits.

c. The dispute must relate to a claim by the Claimant that a measure taken or not
taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article XII(1)). Here, there is no
dispute that the Claimant claims that measures taken by Costa Rica are in
breach of the BIT, but the Parties dispute what those measures are and whether
they qualify as “measures” for the purposes of the BIT. This dispute is at the
heart of several of the Respondent’s objections to jurisdiction.

d. The dispute must also relate to a claim “that the investor has incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach” (Article XII(1)). Again, the

Claimant claims that it has incurred loss or damage arising out of the breaches it
alleges, but the Respondent disputes that this damage could have arisen from

189 C-Mem. Merits, § 219.

51

the measures identified by the Claimant as being in breach of the BIT. This
dispute is also central to one of the Respondent's objections.

e. The Claimant must have consented in writing to submit the dispute to arbitration
(Article XII(3)(a)). There is no dispute that Infinito and Industrias Infinito'®° have
both consented in writing to arbitrate this dispute by filing the Request for
Arbitration and providing written consents to arbitration,'®' with the exception of
the objection directed to the claim regarding the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, a
claim that the Claimant has in any event withdrawn, and an objection that the
Respondent does not presently pursue, as discussed at paragraphs 154 and 167
and note 142 supra. It is noted in this context that the Respondent's consent is
found at Article XII(5), which provides that “[eJach Contracting Party hereby gives
its unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration
in accordance with the provisions of this Article.”

f. A period of six months must have elapsed from the date in which a notice of
dispute has been delivered in accordance with the final paragraph of Article
XII(2), during which the Parties must have attempted to settle the dispute
amicably, before the claim can be submitted to arbitration (Article XII(2)). There
is no dispute that this requirement has been met, with the same exception as the
one noted in subparagraph (e) above.

g. The Claimant must have waived its right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measures that are alleged to be in breach of the
BIT before the Costa Rican courts or tribunals or in a dispute settlement
procedure of any kind (Article XII(3)(b)). There is no dispute that both Infinito and
Industrias Infinito have provided the required waiver, '** with the exception of the

In this context, the Tribunal notes that Section II of Annex II of the BIT provides:
“Il. Damage Incurred by a Controlled Enterprise

1. A claim that a Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that an enterprise
that is a juridical person incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws
of that Contracting Party has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach, may be brought by an investor of the other Contracting Party acting on behalf of an
enterprise which the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly. In such a case:

(a) any award shall be made to the affected enterprise;
(b) the consent to arbitration of both the investor and the enterprise shall be required; [...].”

objection directed to the claim regarding the 2015 TCA Damages Decision
mentioned in subparagraph (e) above.

In addition, the following two requirements must also be met (whether as a matter of
jurisdiction or admissibility, a debate over which the Tribunal does not presently rule):

a.

Not more than three years must have elapsed from the date on which Infinito first
acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and
knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage (Article XII(3)(c)). The
Respondent disputes that this requirement is met.

No judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure
that is alleged to be in breach of the BIT (Article XII(3)(d)). Compliance with this
requirement is also disputed by the Respondent.

The disagreements noted at (c) and (d) of the preceding paragraph are at the heart of
several of the Respondent's objections. Specifically:

a.

Underlying virtually all of the Respondent's objections is the argument that the
Claimant is formally challenging certain measures, when its case is “really” about
other (previous) measures. The question thus arises whether, for jurisdictional
purposes, the Tribunal must focus on the measures as pleaded or whether it can
re-characterize them, including by determining whether the acts impugned qualify
as “measures” for purposes of the BIT at all.

The Respondent also submits that the claims amount to a disagreement with
Costa Rican courts on matters of domestic law, rather than a genuine claim
under the BIT. While it does not expressly ground this objection on a particular
provision of Article XII, the Tribunal understands that this is related to the
jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate to a claim by the Claimant
that a measure taken or not taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article
XII(1)).

The Respondent further argues that the Claimant fails to show a prima facie case
of any of the alleged breaches of the BIT. This objection also appears to be
grounded on the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate to a claim
that a measure taken or not taken by Costa Rica is in breach of the BIT (Article
XII(1)), as well as on Article XII(2)(b).

In addition, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to articulate
how it suffered losses from the challenged measures. Again, this objection
appears to be based on the jurisdictional requirement that the dispute must relate
to a claim that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising
out of, the breaches alleged (Article XII(1)), and on Article XII(2)(c), according to
which the Claimant bears the burden of proving that it has “incurred loss or
damage.”

53

181.

The Tribunal will address these issues first, in order to establish whether the main
jurisdictional requirements are met (Section IV.C.3 infra).

The Respondent’s Objections Arising from Article XII(1) and (2)
a. Should the Tribunal Consider the Case as Pleaded by the Claimant?
(i) | The Respondent's Position

At the heart of the Respondent’s objections is the same underlying argument: “the
key measure underlying Infinito’s claims is the annulment of Infinito’s concession by
the 2010 TCA Judgment.”'%? For the Respondent, this is the measure that annulled
the 2008 Concession and other project approvals, an annulment that the Claimant
has recognized “instantly,” rendered its investments “substantially worthless,” and
breached the BIT.'** In other words, the Claimant's case is “really” about the 2010
TCA Decision, and not about the measures formally challenged by the Claimant.

Relying on the expert report of Carlos Ubico, the Respondent asserts that, as a
matter of Costa Rican law, it was the 2010 TCA Decision which ordered the
annulment of the Concession and other approvals, and that it was not in any way
provisional or dependent on any confirmation by the Administrative Chamber of the
Supreme Court.’ Although Industrias Infinito’s cassation request before the
Administrative Chamber of the Supreme Court temporarily suspended the execution
of the 2010 TCA Decision, the decision itself remained valid and binding unless
reversed by the Administrative Chamber.'®® This cassation request did not “undo” the
annulment, so that the Administrative Chamber could once more annul it; rather, it
merely constituted pursuit and exhaustion by the Claimant of its local remedies.
Citing James Crawford, the Respondent argues that “the breach of international law
occurs at the time when the treatment occurs” and “[t]he breach is not postponed to a
later date when local remedies are exhausted [...].”""” As stated by the PClJ in the
Phosphates case, a refusal to redress a prior wrong “merely results in allowing the
[allegedly] unlawful act to subsist. It exercises no influence either on the
accomplishment of the act or on the responsibility ensuing from it.”'%

According to the Respondent, the Tribunal is empowered to go beyond a party’s
characterization of its claim. In the context of Article XII(3)(d), when the BIT refers to

a measure that is “alleged to be in breach,” this does not mean that a tribunal must
take the Claimant's word for what is in fact alleged in the complaint. According to the
Respondent, “[nJothing in Article XII(3)(d) divests the Tribunal of the power to
examine what Claimant’s case is actually about,” and “it is clear that the measure
centrally at issue in the case is the TCA’s annulment of Infinito’s 2008 Concession.”'?
The word “alleged” is used to qualify the word “breach” simply because the absence
of that qualifier would be inappropriate when a breach has not yet been
established.20°

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its case is about the 2010 TCA Decision. It argues that the
Tribunal must focus on the case as it has pleaded it. Contrary to the Respondent’s
contentions, the Claimant asserts that it does not “really” challenge the 2010 TCA
Decision “for the simple reason that that decision was neither final nor the proximate
cause of the loss of Infinito’s rights and damages.”“°' Rather, the Claimant’s case is
that, as a composite whole, the four measures that it challenges (specifically, the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAE Resolution, the 2011
Legislative Moratorium, and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision) “had the
combined effect of stripping Infinito of all of its rights, barring it from seeking any sort
of meaningful remedy, and eliminating any possibility of proceeding with the Crucitas
project.”2°? In particular, it was the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision which
rendered the 2010 TCA Decision final, thereby crystallizing the annulment of the
Concession and related approvals. The Claimant explains that it challenges this
decision, among other measures, because until the release of the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, no breach of the BIT had occurred.?°>

In any event, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal must hear its claims as it has
pleaded them, not as the Respondent attempts to redefine them. Tribunals have
consistently found that, at the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must consider
“presumed or supposed violations of [the Treaty as] invoked by the Claimant.”

In the context of Article XII(3)(d), the “measure that is alleged to be in breach” of the
BIT must be the measure that the Claimant alleges, not the measure as redefined by
the Respondent. Likewise, the “breach” that has been alleged must be assessed as
pleaded by the Claimant. To suggest otherwise would strip the word “alleged” of its
ordinary meaning.*°° The Claimant notes in this respect that the term “alleged” is
being used as a verb, not an adjective, and that, contrary to the Respondent's
suggestion, the term “breach” is often unaccompanied by the qualifier "alleged.”?°°

(iii) Discussion

The Tribunal agrees with the Claimant: it is the Claimant’s prerogative to formulate its
claims as it sees fit. As stated in ECE Projektmanagement:

[It is for the investor to allege and formulate its claims of breach of
relevant treaty standards as it sees fit. It is not the place of the
respondent State to recast those claims in a different manner of its own
choosing and the Claimants’ claims accordingly fall to be assessed on
the basis on which they are pleaded.?07

The Tribunal considers that this conclusion is supported by the express language of
Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT, which stipulates that “[a]n investor may submit a dispute as
referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration [...] only if [...] (d) in cases where Costa Rica
is a party to the dispute, no judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court
regarding the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement” (emphasis
added). The Tribunal is persuaded that the ordinary meaning of the term “alleged,”
which is used as a verb in this context, is “pleaded” or “claimed.” Further, at the
jurisdictional stage, a tribunal must be guided by the case as put forward by the
claimant in order to avoid breaching the claimant's due process rights. To proceed
otherwise is to incur the risk of dismissing the case based on arguments not put
forward by the claimant, at a great procedural cost for that party.

Accordingly, the Tribunal must assess the case before it focusing on the measures
that the Claimant has deemed fit to challenge, and determine its jurisdiction, the
admissibility of these claims and, if appropriate, the prima facie existence of rights to
be protected at the merits phase, on that basis. It is a different question whether,
assuming there is jurisdiction and admissibility, the claims as raised are founded or
not. This is a matter for the merits stage where the Claimant will have to establish
that the claims as presented arise from breaches of the BIT and caused a
compensable loss.

The Tribunal notes in this respect that the Claimant asserts that the following
measures breached the BIT:2°

a. The November 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which the Claimant
alleges confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision, “thereby rendering final and
irreversible the annulment of the exploitation concession, environmental
approvals, the declaration of public interest and national convenience, and the
land use change permit.”2°°

b. The June 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which Infinito alleges declined
on preliminary admissibility grounds to resolve the conflict between its earlier
decision upholding the constitutionality of the Las Crucitas Project approvals and
the 2010 TCA Decision.?"°

c. The January 2012 MINAE Resolution, which Infinito alleges cancelled the 2008
Concession and expunged all of Industrias Infinito’s mining rights from the mining
registry, going further than what was ordered by the Administrative Chamber.?"!

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium on open-pit mining, which the Claimant alleges
replaced the 2010 Executive Moratorium, prohibiting Industrias Infinito from
applying for new permits.?"2

The Tribunal will now focus its analysis on these measures.

b. Are the Acts Challenged by the Claimant “measures” for Purposes of the
BIT?

(i) | The Respondent's Position
The Respondent denies that judicial measures can be considered “measures”
capable of breaching the BIT. For this reason, it contends that the Claimant cannot
challenge the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, nor the 2013 Constitutional
Chamber Decision (nor, for that matter, the 2010 TCA Decision, which according to
the Respondent is the “real” measure at issue).

C-CM Jur., § 56. Although in its Memorial on the Merits the Claimant also challenged a fifth
measure, the 2015 TCA Damages Decision, the Claimant has withdrawn its challenge to that
decision “because the government and SINAC appealed it to the Administrative Chamber in
December 2015” and “fas a result, the decision is not final or binding on Industrias Infinito.”
However, the Claimant “reserves its right to challenge as an ancillary measure any future
Administrative Chamber decision that breaches the BIT.” C-CM Jur., § 44.

The Respondent argues that the term “measure” is specifically defined in the BIT,
which is unusual. The definition includes “any law, regulation, procedure,
requirement or practice,” with no reference to judgments.?"* It is thus “irrelevant that
the term ‘measure’ is normally understood to include judgments, because the Parties
have adopted a special and narrower definition that must be given effect.”*"* The
Claimant's position is incoherent in this respect: while it acknowledges that the BIT
contains a special definition of the term “measure,” it then proceeds to ignore that
definition, asserting that the term is generally understood to encompass judicial
measures.?'>

Even if the BIT’s definition of “measure” should be read to include judicial measures,
it does not follow that judicial breaches must be arbitrable. According to the
Respondent, ‘[i]t is quite common for investment treaties to provide protection against
a wide range of breaches, but to restrict international dispute resolution concerning
such measures to a narrower subset.”216

Finally, as noted in paragraph 264 infra, the Respondent submits that this
interpretation of the term “measure” is consistent with its interpretation that
Article XII(3)(d) excludes challenges to decisions by Costa Rica’s judiciary.

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant asserts that judicial measures constitute “measures” for the purposes of
the BIT. It notes that, according to Article I(i) of the BIT, a “measure” includes “any
law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,” which encompasses judicial
decisions and processes, as recognized by the ILC Articles on State Responsibility
and by international tribunals.2'7 While the ordinary meaning of a term may be
supplanted by a special agreed meaning, the party invoking a special meaning must
meet a high burden of proof, which the Respondent has failed to meet.?"® To the
contrary, the list in Article I(i) of the BIT is non-exhaustive (as evidenced by the use of

the word “includes”) and already encompasses judicial measures (which are included
in the categories of law, procedure, requirement and practice).?'°

As discussed in Section IV.C.4.a(ii) infra, the Claimant further submits that this is
consistent with its interpretation of Article XII(3)(d). As noted in that section, judicial
measures may be challenged under the BIT if they are final and not subject to further
appeal. This interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning of the provision in
its context and in light of the object and purpose of the BIT. By contrast, Costa Rica’s
interpretation of Article XII(3)(d), would also exclude any challenge to a judicial
measure, even if the claim is for denial of justice or expropriation.?”°

(iii) Discussion

There is no dispute that two of the measures challenged by the Claimant constitute
“measures” for the purposes of the BIT, namely, the 2012 MINAE Resolution and the
2011 Legislative Moratorium. The question arises with respect to the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision,
which are judicial decisions. The Claimant asserts that judicial measures qualify as
“measures” for the purposes of the BIT, while the Respondent denies this.

The Tribunal considers that judicial decisions are indeed “measures” for the purposes
of the BIT. First, it notes that the definition of “measure” in Article (i) of the BIT is
very wide and non-exhaustive. It includes “any [...] procedure,” which in the
Tribunal’s view encompasses judicial procedures and, by necessary implication,
judicial decisions, which are the ultimate goal of any judicial procedure and thus an
inherent part of them. The Tribunal also notes that this same definition has been
used in other treaties such as NAFTA" and CAFTA,” and tribunals have invariably
concluded that it covered judicial measures.?°

Second, the ILC Articles on State Responsibility consider that the acts of the State
organs exercising judicial functions constitute acts of State which may give rise to the
international responsibility of the State.?*

Finally, as explained in Section IV.C.4.a(iii) infra in the context of Article XII(3)(d), the
Tribunal considers that including judicial decisions in the concept of “measure” is
consistent with the context of that provision and with the object and purpose of the
BIT.

Accordingly, all of the measures that the Claimant alleges are in breach of the BIT
can be considered “measures” for purposes of Articles XII(1), XII(2) and XII(3)(d) of
the BIT.

c. Are the Claimant’s Claims Genuine Claims under the BIT, or Do They
Amount to a Disagreement with Costa Rican Courts on Matters of
Domestic Law?

(i) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent contends that the Claimant's claims are not genuine claims under
the BIT; they merely express a disagreement with Costa Rican courts on matters of
domestic law. Citing international commentary and jurisprudence, it is submitted that
the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione materiae to act as a court of appeal on matters
of domestic law.”° The Tribunal is simply not competent to “second-guess [a local]
court's interpretation and application of local law.” The Respondent refers in
particular to the following comment from the Helnan tribunal :

An ICSID Tribunal will not act as an instance to review matters of
domestic law in the manner of a court of higher instance. Instead, the
Tribunal will accept the findings of local courts as long as no deficiencies,

in procedure or substance, are shown in regard to the local proceedings
which are of a nature of rendering these deficiencies unacceptable from
the viewpoint of international law, such as in the case of a denial of
justice.?27

The Respondent acknowledges that the Claimant alleges several breaches of BIT
provisions. However, it contends that the Claimant “cannot manufacture international
jurisdiction simply by labelling its disagreement with domestic court judgments as
breaches of the BIT.”8 This is confirmed by the Azinian**? and Iberdrola®*°
decisions. The Claimant makes no effort to explain why the TCA’s and Administrative
Chamber's decisions amount to a breach of any provision of the BIT.

Instead, the Claimant’s case is nothing more than “a complaint that the Costa Rican
administrative courts (i.e. the TCA and the Administrative Chamber) disagreed with
the Claimant’s understanding of domestic law, including its understanding of earlier
judgments of the Constitutional Chamber.”*3* According to the Respondent, the
“Claimant's arguments in this arbitration are based on assertions about Costa Rican
law that the Costa Rican courts have expressly and repeatedly rejected.”*°° The
Claimant even fails to acknowledge the reasoning provided by the Costa Rican
courts. For instance, it ignores that the different chambers of the Supreme Court
confirmed that there was no conflict between the allegedly conflicting judgments
invoked by the Claimant.?** Nor has the Claimant challenged the independence or
good faith of the Costa Rican courts.?%

The Respondent maintains that the Claimant has failed to explain how its claims,
even if accepted at face value, reflect a violation of international, rather than domestic
law.”° Despite the Claimant's efforts to focus on the effect of the challenged
measures, “it remains patently clear that the only real question Claimant is asking this
Tribunal to resolve is whether the Costa Rican judiciary erred in its determinations on
issues of Costa Rican law.”*” In particular, it requests the Tribunal to find that Costa
Rican courts incorrectly applied the 2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito’s 2008
Concession and other permits. For the Respondent, the “[mJere misapplication of
domestic law, even if proven, is insufficient to establish a breach of international law,
yet Claimant does not contend (or present any evidence to suggest) that Costa Rica’s
courts and administrative authorities did anything more than apply the law as they
understood it in good faith.”*°

Unless the Tribunal is able to assume Costa Rican appellate jurisdiction and accept
that the TCA’s rulings (as upheld by the Administrative Chamber) were incorrect as a
matter of Costa Rican law, the Claimant’s case concerning the annulment of the 2008
Concession fails:9°

a. The arbitrariness claim fails in the face of correct (or even good-faith) application
of domestic law.

b. The legitimate expectations claim fails because the expectation of engaging in an
activity cannot be legitimate if it is illegal under domestic law.

c. The expropriation claim fails because no wrongful taking can result from the
legitimate application of Costa Rica’s legal system.

The Respondent further contends that none of the Claimant's remaining claims
(specifically, its denial of justice claim and its claims against the 2012 MINAE
Resolution and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium) is supported by any evidence that
withstands prima facie scrutiny, and therefore fail on that basis.?4°

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that there is any merit to the Respondent's contention that
Infinito’s BIT claims amount to “labelling” and are not genuine. The arguments that
the Respondent makes under this heading are essentially the same as those
advanced in its objection that the Claimant has not made a prima facie case of
breaches of the BIT. As explained in Section IV.C.3.d(ii) infra, the Claimant asserts

R-Reply Jur., § 145.

R-Reply Jur., § 147.
R-Reply Jur., {§ 149-150.

that it “has established both on a balance of probabilities and on a prima facie basis
that the various measures which it challenges breached the BIT.”*41

The Claimant further submits that the cases cited by the Respondent to support the
proposition that this Tribunal is not a court of appeal on issues of Costa Rican law are
inapposite. The Claimant “does not contest [...] that the Tribunal’s jurisdiction is
limited to determining whether the four administrative and judicial measures at issue
constitute breaches of the Canada—Costa Rica BIT (i.e. breaches of international,
rather than domestic, law).”*4? Most of its claims do not depend on whether the Costa
Rican courts correctly applied Costa Rican law, and for the one claim in which Infinito
does challenge the application of Costa Rican law by local courts, such challenge is
validly brought under the BIT.*° For those claims in which Costa Rican law is
relevant, the Tribunal may consider the correctness with which Costa Rican law was
applied as part of its analysis of whether the Respondent has breached the BIT: the
question for this Tribunal is “not whether Costa Rican domestic law was misapplied,
but whether the failure to correctly apply domestic law in addition to other relevant
facts constitutes a breach of the BIT.”*4* In this context, the application of domestic
law forms part of the Tribunal’s factual analysis.2°

More specifically, the Claimant submits that:

a. Neither the legitimate expectations nor the expropriation claim depend on
whether Costa Rican courts correctly applied Costa Rican law (in particular, the
2002 Moratorium). Although the Respondent relies on its domestic law as a
defense, it is well-established that a State cannot rely on its internal law to justify
an internationally wrongful act.

b. The procedural denial of justice claim, the claim for breach of FET because the
2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was arbitrary, and the full protection and
security claim are based on expert evidence that the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision conflicted with binding decisions of the Constitutional
Chamber. As explained in paragraph 163 supra, the Claimant asserts that there
is no mechanism available in Costa Rica to resolve that conflict. While the
Administrative Chamber considered that there was no conflict, under Costa Rican
law only the Constitutional Chamber is empowered to make that decision, but
there is no mechanism allowing it to do so.

c. The substantive denial of justice claim is the only claim which implies that the
Tribunal find that the Administrative Chamber incorrectly applied Costa Rican law

by applying the 2002 Moratorium to Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession and
other project approvals. The Claimant submits that, “in the context of a
substantive denial of justice claim, the Tribunal has the power to determine
whether the Administrative Chamber's failure to properly apply Costa Rican law
also amounts to breaches of the BIT.”*4” Citing Dolzer and Schreuer, the
Claimant submits that the Tribunal is not bound by the findings of the
Administrative Chamber in deciding whether its decision was arbitrary, or whether
Infinito was denied justice or legal security.“* The Claimant accepts that the task
of applying and interpreting domestic law lies primarily with the courts of the host
country, but this is not exclusively so: where domestic law is applied in a manner
that is evidently arbitrary, unjust or idiosyncratic, or in breach of a fundamental
right, international liability arises.2“° Citing Chevron, the Claimant further
contends that “the defectiveness of internal law, the refusal to apply it, or its
wrongful application by judges [can] constitute elements of proof of a denial of
justice, in the international understanding of the expression.”°°

In sum, “[w]hether or not certain of Infinito’s claims depend on a finding that Costa
Rican law was applied incorrectly, Infinito’s claims are all grounded in breaches of the
BIT.”251

(iii) Discussion

The Respondent contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction ratione materiae under
the BIT, because the claims amount to no more than a disagreement with the Costa
Rican courts on matters of domestic law. The Claimant contests this, arguing that
Infinito’s claims are all grounded on breaches of the BIT. It also submits that whether
or not Costa Rican law was applied incorrectly is part of the factual analysis which the
Tribunal must carry out in respect of certain BIT breaches.

The Tribunals jurisdiction ratione materiae is defined by Article XII(1) of the BIT (read
in conjunction with Article XII(2)). Accordingly, the Tribunal’s jurisdiction extends to
“[a]ny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the
former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach.” This provision

clearly sets out that the Tribunal’s subject-matter jurisdiction extends to disputes
relating to claims that (i) a measure taken or not taken by the host State is in breach
of the BIT, and that (ii) the investor has incurred loss or damage as a result of that
breach.

In the Tribunal’s view, for jurisdictional purposes, it suffices to establish the existence
of (i) a claim that a measure breaches the BIT, and of (ii) a claim that such breach has
caused the investor loss or damage.

With respect to (i), the Tribunal has already found that it must focus on the claim as
pleaded by the Claimant. Here, the Claimant is clearly and unequivocally arguing that
the four measures identified at paragraph 188 supra have breached several of the
Respondent's obligations under the BIT, namely its obligations under Article II(a) (fair
and equitable treatment or the CIL minimum standard), Article II(b) (full protection and
security), and Article VIII (expropriation). The jurisdictional requirement under (i) is
thus met.

With respect to (ii), it is also undisputed that the Claimant claims that the breaches
identified above have caused it loss or damage. The Tribunal thus finds that this
jurisdictional requirement is also met.

The Respondent also objects to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction on the grounds that the
Claimant has neither made a prima facie case of the breaches it alleges, nor of the
damage it claims arose from these breaches. The Tribunal addresses these
objections in Sections IV.C.3.d and IV.C.3.e infra.

This does not mean that the Tribunal will not consider the Respondent's argument
that the claims merely represent a disagreement with Costa Rican courts on domestic
law. The Tribunal agrees that it is not its role to act as a court of appeal with respect
to decisions of domestic courts. That said, it is the Tribunals duty to verify if the
measures complained of have breached the BIT. The Tribunal notes in this respect
that only two of the measures complained of are judicial measures (the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision).
As such, the Respondent’s argument can only apply to these two measures.
However, the Claimant has expressly brought claims of denial of justice against those
measures. Whether these claims are well-founded (in particular, whether they go
beyond a mere disagreement between the Claimant and Costa Rican courts on the
application of municipal law) is a matter for the merits.

d. —_Has the Claimant Made a Prima Facie Case of Any of the Alleged Breaches
of the BIT?

(i) | The Respondent's Position
The Respondent submits that, to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the Claimant

must make a prima facie case that the conduct of which it complains is capable of
breaching the BIT. For the Respondent, the appropriate analysis in the face of a

65

219.

221.

222.

preliminary objection to jurisdiction was articulated by Judge Higgins in the Oil
Platforms case, according to which the tribunal must “accept pro tem the facts as
alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the applicable treaty]
for jurisdictional purposes — that is to say, to see if on the basis of the claims of fact
there could occur a violation of one or more of [the treaty provisions].”*°* In other
words, the test is to assess whether, on the facts alleged by the Claimant, the
challenged acts are capable of violating the BIT.

According to the Respondent, the Claimant “cannot meet the prima facie test by
simply labelling the disputed conduct as a treaty breach.”*°° Citing Impregilo and
Burlington, the Tribunal cannot limit itself to the Claimant's characterization of the
case.?%4

The Respondent further contends that a prima facie case must be supported with
prima facie evidence. While that evidence need not be sufficient to show that the
claim is well founded, it must at least demonstrate that there is some truth behind a
claimant's allegations. In addition, such prima facie evidence need not be accepted
pro tem if the respondent submits other evidence that conclusively contradicts the
claimant's assertions. Citing Chevron |, the Respondent argues that, if from the
evidence submitted in the jurisdictional phase “the Tribunal finds that facts alleged by
the Claimant[] are shown to be false or insufficient to satisfy the prima facie test,
jurisdiction would have to be denied.”°5

The Respondent argues that here, the Claimant has failed to make a prima facie
showing of any of the breaches of the BIT that it alleges. According to the
Respondent, the conduct that the Claimant attributes to Costa Rica, even if it were
proven, would not violate the relevant standards, and in those cases in which the
Claimant’s assertions could plausibly give rise to a breach of the BIT, those
allegations find no support in the evidentiary record.

In response to the Claimant's arguments, the Respondent denies that the Tribunal
must accept the Claimant’s factual and legal allegations as true on their face.
According to the Respondent, “the Tribunal’s role at the jurisdictional stage is to
determine, based on its own review of the available evidence, whether the relevant

State conduct could be deemed to constitute a substantive breach of the BIT within
Costa Rica’s consent to arbitration under Article XII.”25”

Relying on Emmis, the Respondent submits that a tribunal must engage in two
distinct types of inquiries at the jurisdictional stage, each having a different level of
inquiry. The first type of inquiry “relates to questions of fact that must be definitively
determined at the jurisdictional stage,” while “[t]he second involves questions of fact
that go to the merits, which the Tribunal must ordinarily not prejudge, unless they are
plainly without foundation.”*® The second inquiry “necessarily involves assessing
whether the alleged conduct of the [rjespondent is capable of constituting a breach of
the substantive protections of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction
of the [t]ribunal ratione materiae but this has to be determined on a prima facie basis
only.”*5° According to the Respondent, the Claimant attempts to conflate these two
inquiries, and mistakenly argues that it must only make a prima facie showing with
respect to both jurisdictional and merits inquiries.?°

On this basis, the Respondent submits that the Tribunal may conclusively determine
issues of fact and law at the jurisdictional stage. In particular, it must determine
decisively those issues that are essential to establish jurisdiction, such as the
existence or ownership of an investment, or threshold requirements of the BIT or the
ICSID Convention.?6' Citing Ampal-American, the Respondent submits that it is “not
only appropriate, but necessary, for the Tribunal to hold Claimant to a higher level of
proof than a prima facie showing for all issues bearing directly on the question of
jurisdiction.” For the Respondent, “[t]his means that the Tribunal does not have to
take Infinito’s assertions or evidence at face value;” it “should test the Claimant's
characterizations and its evidence in order to make its jurisdictional
determinations.”?®

According to the Respondent, “the same is true for determining issues of law relevant
to the jurisdictional inquiry." Citing Achmea, the Respondent contends that the
Tribunal is entitled to engage in a preliminary interpretation of the substantive
provisions of the BIT for purposes of jurisdiction, especially when the parties disagree

on the proper interpretation of a provision.?° Relying on EnCana and Continental
Casualty, the Respondent submits that “it is proper for an arbitral tribunal to identify
the relevant State acts or omissions that make up the alleged treaty breach, and to
examine the facts of the dispute critically.”°° For this purpose, “{a] tribunal is
empowered to look beyond the superficial assertions of a pleading and examine the
true substance of a claimant's complaint, and may arrive at contrary conclusions of
fact or law where the claimant's assertions are demonstrably false, or where claimant
ascribes to them a strained interpretation.”?°”

For the Respondent, the cases cited by the Claimant are inapposite. ECE
Projektmanagement dealt with the attempt of the respondent State to recast a claim
for violation of the FET standard as a claim for denial of justice; here Costa Rica is not
attempting to change the Claimant's legal theory, it “is simply pointing out that the
factual predicate of a particular claim (as defined by Claimant) must have a
sufficiently compelling evidentiary foundation.”?6* In Glamis, the earlier measures that
the respondent claimed would have been time-barred did not have the same impact
as the later measures alleged by the claimant, which is the case here.7©° In Pope &
Talbot, the tribunal agreed with the claimant that the critical date for purposes of the
relevant statute of limitations should be counted as of the date of a later event, but it
did so only after assessing the relevant evidence.?”” In the Phosphates case, the
PClJ refused to accept Italy’s characterization of its claim as one of denial of justice
arising out of the French authorities’ refusal to redress a previous dispossession of an
Italian national, and recognized that the claim was directed at the dispossession itself,
which was time-barred.?”'

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant submits that the prima facie test applicable at the jurisdictional stage is
a low one: “Infinito need only establish that if the facts it alleges are ultimately

established, those facts could constitute a violation of the BIT;” it “need not
demonstrate that such facts, if proven, would violate the BIT.”2”2

The Claimant argues that the Respondent improperly tries to force the Tribunal to
determine at the jurisdictional stage questions that belong to the merits. The
Claimant emphasizes that the Tribunal’s current task is to determine whether it has
jurisdiction, but it must refrain from prejudging the merits.2”°

In particular, the Respondent is inappropriately requesting the Tribunal to engage ina
detailed legal interpretation of the substantive provisions of the BIT, including (i) the
scope of the FET protection in Article Il, (ii) whether Infinito’s legitimate expectations
are relevant to determining whether that standard has been breached, and (iii)
whether judicial decisions can only violate the BIT if they amount to a denial of justice.
The jurisdictional stage is not the place for this analysis.2”* According to the
Claimant, “[t]he Tribunal need simply be satisfied that the claims, as formulated by the
claimant, could fall under the scope of the substantive BIT provisions the claimant
invokes;” “[o]nly where a substantive protection is ‘plainly incapable’ of bearing the
claim put forth by the claimant will it be appropriate for that claim to be dismissed on a
prima facie basis.”*”> Citing Chevron |, the Claimant argues that, at the jurisdictional
stage, “[t]o require a claimant to prove its interpretation of substantive BIT provisions
is to ‘prejudge the merits of the dispute.”?”°

Likewise, the Claimant submits that the Tribunal must accept the Claimant's evidence
on its face. It must not assess the weight of the fact and expert evidence put forward
by the Claimant.2”” The Respondent has acknowledged that “the Tribunal must
‘accept pro tem the facts as alleged’ by the Claimant ‘to be true.”2”° Citing the Oi!
Platforms case, the Claimant argues that ‘[i]t is only at the merits stage that a tribunal
‘has jurisdiction to determine exactly what the facts are and see whether they do
sustain a violation’ of the BIT.”?”? The Respondent's reliance on Chevron | and II is
misplaced: in Chevron |, the tribunal was dealing with a situation where there was
conflicting evidence that could have demonstrated that the facts alleged by the

Claimant were false,7°° and in Chevron Il, the tribunal addressed the possibility that
the facts pleaded in the Notice of Arbitration (not the evidence submitted by the
claimant) would not be accepted as true if they were “incredible, frivolous, vexatious
or otherwise advanced by the claimant in bad faith.”?' Here, the Respondent has not
identified a single piece of evidence adduced by Infinito that should not be accepted
on its face on the basis of the situations contemplated in the Chevron cases.”°

In answer to the Respondent’s arguments on the appropriate standard of review for
the jurisdictional stage, the Claimant articulates the following principles: 7

a. The facts and law that are necessary to determine jurisdiction may be assessed
rigorously. At the jurisdictional stage, tribunals may definitively determine
questions of fact that relate to jurisdiction, such as whether there was an
investment, or an investor, but these questions do not arise in this case. The
cases on which the Respondent relies all relate to this type of inquiry.

b. By contrast, the facts and law that are relevant to the merits must be considered
on a prima facie standard. The Tribunal must accept the Claimant's factual
allegations relating to the merits unless they are plainly without foundation. The
Respondent cannot cite a single arbitral decision where the tribunal engaged, at
the jurisdictional stage, in a detailed review of the factual evidence to determine
whether a substantive BIT standard had been breached. Nor is it appropriate for
the Tribunal to engage in a detailed analysis of the BIT’s substantive provisions
at this stage.

c. The Tribunal’s analysis should be based on the Claimant's allegations, not on the
Respondent's reformulation of the case. The Claimant submits that “Infinito is
free to plead its claims as it deems appropriate,” and “is entitled to provide facts
and legal theory in support of its arguments. In response, Costa Rica is entitled
to provide its own facts and legal theory. The Tribunal then considers both sides’
positions, in light of the allegations made by the claimant. The claimant's facts
and argument are not shielded from arbitral review; but the Tribunal’s analysis
must be based on the claimant's case, not the respondent's recasting of it.”®

In any event, the Claimant contends that not only has it satisfied the low prima facie
standard applicable at the jurisdictional stage; it has also shown that Costa Rica has
breached its obligations under the Articles Il, VIII, and IV of the BIT on the standard
applicable to the Tribunal’s assessment of the merits, i.e., the balance of probabilities
standard.

(iii) Discussion

Both Parties appear to agree that, at the jurisdictional stage, the Tribunal must
engage in two separate inquiries, each of which entail a different standard of review.
As noted in Emmis (on which both Parties rely),°° the first inquiry refers to facts that
go to jurisdiction. The second inquiry involves the merits of the breaches claimed.

The Parties appear to differ on the identification of the facts that fall within the ambit
of the first inquiry. For the Tribunal, it is clear that all the facts that underlie the
jurisdictional requirements set by the ICSID Convention and the BIT must be
established — proven — at the jurisdictional stage. If these facts are not established,
the Tribunal must dismiss the case for lack of jurisdiction.

Thus, the Tribunal must finally assess whether the facts that prove the following
requirements are established:26°

i. Whether there is a legal dispute (Article 25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and
Article XII(1) of the BIT).

ii. Whether that dispute arises directly out of an investment (Article 25 of the
ICSID Convention).

iii. Whether that investment qualifies as such under Article I(g) of the BIT,
including whether it is owned or controlled in accordance with Costa Rican
Law (Article I(g) of the BIT in connection with Article 25 of the ICSID
Convention and Article XII(1) of the BIT).

iv. Whether the Parties qualify as a Contracting State (or any constituent
subdivision or agency of a Contracting State designated to the Centre by that
State); and an “investor” of another Contracting State (Article 25 ICSID of the
ICSID Convention, and Article XII(1) of the BIT).

v. Whether the Parties have consented in writing to ICSID arbitration (Article
25(1) of the ICSID Convention, and Article XII(3)(a) of the BIT).

vi. Whether the dispute relates to a claim that a measure breaches the BIT
(Article XII(1) of the BIT).
vii. Whether the dispute relates to a claim that the investor has incurred a loss or

damage (Article XII(1) of the BIT).

Exh. RL-0086, Emmis, § 172.

As noted supra, § 174 and explained further infra, 343, the Tribunal will determine whether
the requirement set out under Article XII(3)(c) is jurisdictional in nature at the merits stage; and
it considers that the issue whether the requirement in Article XII(3)(d) is jurisdictional or
admissibility is of no consequence in light of the Tribunal’s finding in Section IV.C.4.a(iii) infra.

71

236.

237.

238.

viii. Whether a period of six months has elapsed since the notice of dispute and
the Parties have attempted to settle the dispute amicably (Article XII(2) of the
BIT).

ix. Whether the Claimant has waived its right to other proceedings in relation to
the measures (Article XII(3)(b) of the BIT).

x. Whether more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
Claimant first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the
alleged breach and knowledge that it had incurred loss or damage
(Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT).

xi. Whether a judgment has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding
the measure that is alleged to be in breach of the BIT (Article XII(3)(d) of the

BIT).

As noted in Sections IV.B and IV.C.2 supra, the Parties agree that the jurisdictional
requirements listed above in sub-paragraphs (i), (ii), (iv), (viii) and (ix) are met. The
Parties also agree that the requirement listed at sub-paragraph (iii) (existence of an
investment protected under the BIT) is met, but given APREFLOFAS’s argument that
the investment was not obtained in accordance with Costa Rican law, the Tribunal
has deferred this issue to the merits. The Parties dispute whether the remaining
requirements have been met. The Tribunal has already found that those in sub-
paragraphs (vi) and (vii) are present, i.e. an alleged claim which relates to a breach
of the BIT and which relates to an alleged loss caused by the alleged breach. As for
consent (requirement (v)), the Parties diverge on requirements (x) and (xi), which the
Tribunal addresses in Sections IV.C.4.a and IV.C.4.b infra. The analysis of these
latter requirements will complete the first inquiry under the Emmis standard, i.e. the
inquiry referring to facts going to jurisdiction or admissibility.

The Tribunal must next engage in the second inquiry, which is to assess prima facie
whether the claims asserted may constitute treaty breaches. For the Tribunal, this is
equivalent to the pro tem test articulated by Judge Higgins in the Oil Platforms case.
Accordingly, to determine whether the claims are “sufficiently plausibly based” upon
the applicable treaty, the appropriate analysis “is to accept pro tem the facts as
alleged by [the claimant] to be true and in that light to interpret [the applicable treaty]
for jurisdictional purposes — that is to say, to see if on the basis of [the claimant's]
claims of fact there could occur a violation of one or more [provisions of the treaty].”2°”

In making this prima facie determination, the Tribunal must first assume the facts as
the Claimant alleges them. Pro tem — pro tempore, that is for the time being — the
Tribunal must accept that the facts alleged will later be proven. Second, the Tribunal
must review whether the facts alleged are susceptible of constituting breaches of the
treaty’s guarantees of protections as it understands these guarantees. To this
second inquiry, the Tribunal must apply a prima facie standard of review, both in

Exh. RL-0085, Oi! Platforms, § 32.

72

240.

241.

respect of the capacity of the facts to fall within the ambit of the treaty protections and
of the understanding of these protections.

The Tribunal is neither required nor entitled to engage in a review exceeding the
prima facie standard. The Emmis tribunal expressly recognized this, when it stated
that the second inquiry “necessarily involves assessing whether the alleged conduct
of the [rjespondent is capable of constituting a breach of the substantive protections
of the investment treaty so as to fall within the jurisdiction of the [t]ribunal ratione
materiae but this has to be determined on a prima facie basis only.”* Similarly, the
Abaciat tribunal restated the pro tem test as follows:

[T]he task of the Tribunal at the stage of determining whether it has
jurisdiction to hear a claim under an investment treaty merely consists in
determining whether the facts alleged by the claimant(s), if established,
are capable of constituting a breach of the provisions of the BIT which
have been invoked [...]._ In performing this task, the Tribunal applies a
prima facie standard, both to the determination of the meaning and scope
of the relevant BIT provisions invoked as well as to the assessment of
whether the facts alleged may constitute breaches of these provisions on
its face.26°

As a result, the Tribunal will not engage now in a detailed analysis of the facts alleged
or of the substantive provisions of the BIT. As noted by Judge Higgins in her
separate opinion in the Oil Platforms case, it is for the merits “to determine what
exactly the facts are, whether as finally determined they do sustain a violation of [the
treaty provisions]; and if so, whether there is a defence to that violation [...]. In short,
it is at the merits that one sees ‘whether there really has been a breach.””°°

The Tribunal is of the view that it is essential to clearly distinguish the limited prima
facie review at the jurisdictional level from the full-fledged review that will be
undertaken at the merits stage. Going beyond a prima facie test at such an incipient
stage of the proceedings creates a risk of breach of due process. In bifurcated
proceedings, the disputing parties expect that the merits will be tried in the
subsequent phase of the arbitration and do not put before the tribunal at the
jurisdictional stage the entire spectrum of evidence and argument that is reserved for
the merits. As a result, if the Tribunal delves too deeply into the merits at the
jurisdictional stage, without having the benefit of a complete record and full
submissions, the Parties can be deprived of the opportunity to fully present and
defend their case, as required by fundamental principles of procedure. Moreover,
exceeding the strict bounds of the pro tem or prima facie test imperils the
manageability and efficiency of the proceedings. Applying an expansive test, such as
the one put forward by the Respondent, could result in trying the case twice whenever
the Tribunal upholds jurisdiction, thus resulting in unnecessary costs and delays.

246.

This being so, while noting that at the jurisdictional stage one should not prejudge
facts that go to the merits, the Tribunal considers that an exception needs to be made
when these facts are “plainly without foundation.”*' This is not the case here. With a
few minor exceptions, the Parties agree on the main facts, in particular on the
existence of the measures alleged by the Claimant. What they do disagree on is the
legal characterization and impact of these facts and whether they amount to breaches
of the BIT. However, these are all properly issues for the merits. In the absence of
manifestly false factual allegations, the Tribunal sees no reason to depart from the
pro tem test.

On the basis of these principles, the Tribunal has no hesitation concluding that the
pro tem or prima facie test is met. For the purposes of jurisdiction, and on a prima
facie basis only, the Tribunal holds that the facts alleged could potentially amount to a
treaty breach. Whether such a breach, would actually constitute an unlawful
expropriation, a breach of FET or of the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment, or a denial of justice, is a determination that exceeds the ambit
of the present inquiry and belongs to the merits analysis. Moreover, the Tribunal
notes that the Claimant challenges non-judicial measures, which on a prima facie
basis may also potentially constitute treaty breaches.

On the basis of the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal holds that the Claimant has
satisfied the prima facie test needed to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione
materiae. In other words, it has shown that the facts which it alleges, if accepted as
true, could entail breaches of the BIT.

e. Must Infinito Make a Prima Facie Case on Damages and, if So, Has It Done
So?

(i) | The Respondent's Position

Articles XII(1) and XII(2) of the BIT provide that an investor may submit to arbitration
“[alny dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the
former Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that the investor has
incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach [...].”

According to the Respondent, the BIT conditions a valid claim on the existence of
both (i) a measure alleged to have breached the BIT and (ii) a specification of loss or
damage arising out of the alleged breach. This means that a claimant must establish
a prima facie case for both (i) an alleged breach and (ii) an alleged damage flowing
from such breach. If the claimant does not identify the loss or damage resulting from
the measure, then it fails to state a prima facie claim.”°*

R-Mem. Jur., 4 303; R-Reply Jur., § 255.

74

247.

248.

The Respondent contends that the Claimant has failed to establish a prima facie case
for both breach and damage. The Respondent’s arguments regarding a prima facie
case on the alleged breach are addressed in Section IV.C.3.d supra. The
Respondent's arguments regarding a prima facie case on damages are reviewed
here.

The Respondent submits that the Claimant has failed to present a plausible theory of
loss or damage attributable to any of the measures it has identified as being in breach
of the BITS for the following reasons:

a.

First, the Claimant has asserted that its investment in Costa Rica lost all value as
a result of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (indeed, on the Claimant's
damages theory, this is the only cause asserted for the Claimant's alleged
damage). However, the Respondent contends that the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision was not the true cause of the Claimant's loss; the true cause
was the 2010 TCA Decision, which annulled the Claimant's 2008 Concession.”

Second, even if the 2010 TCA Decision was not the true cause of the Claimant's
loss, the Claimant has failed to show what specific damage the 2011
Administrative Chamber decision caused to its business. The Claimant's main
argument appears to be that it suffered losses “based on stock valuations, which
fluctuate on a daily basis and are often based on nothing more than a hope or
wishful thinking;” “[b]ut a loss of hope is not a compensable injury for which a
tribunal may award damages in international arbitration.” As to the Claimant's
argument that it continued to spend money on the project in the period between
the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, it is likely
that “such money related to the legal actions it was pursuing at the time, as it was
affirmatively barred from undertaking any development on the project during the
pendency of the cassation request.”2°°

Third, if the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is the true cause of the
Claimant's losses, it is unclear how the Claimant could have “incurred loss or
damage by reason of, or arising out of” later measures.”9’ By its own admission,
its losses became final, and its investment in Costa Rica substantially worthless,
with the issuance of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision: “It is logically
impossible for something that has already been lost to be lost again through a
subsequent act.”*°° Citing Pey Casado, the Respondent contends that “a

claimant must prove damages for each relevant act and cannot pretend that its
damages were caused by one act when in fact they were caused by another.”°°

d. Fourth, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium could not have caused the Claimant any
damage because this moratorium did not deprive the Claimant of the possibility to
obtain a new concession, which it had lost before through the 2010 Executive
Moratorium. The Respondent presumes that the Claimant chose not to challenge
those decrees because they are “evidently outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction
ratione temporis.”"*' In addition, the 2010 TCA Decision ordered the Las
Crucitas area to be reforested, thus precluding the Claimant's possibility of
obtaining new mining rights.5°* Even if the Claimant could have potentially
sought new mining rights, it has “failed to explain how the vaguely defined hope
to acquire new mining rights could qualify as a genuine /oss under the BIT.”°°

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

Contrary to the Respondent’s suggestion, the Claimant asserts that it has
demonstrated its losses on a balance of probabilities, and thus has more than
established a prima facie case of damages for the purposes of Article XII(1) and
(2).904

According to the Claimant, its losses crystallized on the date of the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, not on the date of the 2010 TCA Decision. At that
time, the annulment of Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession and other project
approvals was rendered complete, final and irreversible under Costa Rican law.°°>
Pending the proceedings before the Administrative Chamber, the 2010 TCA Decision
was contingent, suspended, and capable of being reversed in full.2%°° This is
supported by Costa Rican law, Infinito’s actions, the response of public markets, and
the actions of the Government of Costa Rica. It is also confirmed in the First and
Second Reports of FTI Consulting, who analyzed Infinito’s financial statements,
changes in market capitalization, management actions and public disclosure,
investing activities after the relevant decisions, contemporaneous actions of the Costa
Rican Government, and contemporaneous Costa Rican media statements.°°” The
Claimant notes that Costa Rica has not presented expert evidence to the contrary.

As to the Respondent’s arguments on the value of the evidence submitted by Infinito,
the Claimant contends that “[flor a publicly-traded company, its share price reflects
real value,” and notes that “the price of Infinito’s shares has remained at close to zero
since the Administrative Chamber's decision” and “[t]here is no reason to think it will
recover.”

In any event, the Claimant argues that its evidence must be accepted as true for the
purposes of jurisdictional analysis. When assessing jurisdiction, “the question is
whether the facts alleged, taken to be true, ‘may be capable’ of breaching the BIT’s
protections.” Thus, at this stage, the Tribunal must accept the expert evidence
provided by the Claimant regarding Infinito’s losses and the cause of those losses.°"°
Costa Rica is asking the Tribunal to prejudge the merits and decide now that the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision caused no loss.°'' According to the Claimant, the
only investment tribunal that has declined jurisdiction on this basis (in Telenor) found
that the claimant had failed to establish a prima facie case of expropriation because it
had failed to adduce any fact or expert evidence to prove that its investments had
been rendered substantially worthless.°"2

That is not the case here: the Claimant notes that FTI Consulting, in consultation with
RPA, has calculated Infinito’s losses as of 30 November 2011 (the date of the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision) at USD 321 million, using the discounted cash flow
(‘DCF”) method based on a financial model that concluded that “technical aspects
and assumptions of the Crucitas project were developed using standard industry
practices and were reasonable and well supported,” and that “the capital and
operating cost assumptions of the Crucitas project [...] were reasonable.”*'? RPA has
also concluded that the Las Crucitas Project had value beyond the DCF analysis,
“contained in resource ounces not included in the production schedule, and
prospective exploration ground located on the exploitation concession territory but
outside the development area,” and values these assets at “between US$23.7 million
and US$37.1 million based on comparable transactions for non-producing gold
deposits.”°"4

The Claimant denies that it must establish separate losses from the other measures it
has challenged. These other measures prevent Infinito from obtaining a new
exploitation concession and new project approvals, or from having the existing

concession and approvals restored. As a result, “these measures operated in
combination with the Administrative Chamber's decision to effectively render Infinito’s
investments substantially worthless.”*">

According to the Claimant, in the case of a composite breach, a claimant is not
required to prove separate damages associated with each individual measure.*'° Pey
Casado, cited by the Respondent, is inapposite because it did not address whether
each individual measure must cause separate damages.°'’ Here, the Claimant is
alleging that its losses only crystallized by the combined operation of the four
challenged measures: “absent the other measures that Infinito challenges, the
exploitation concession and other project approvals could have been restored or a
new concession and new approvals could have been granted. Had that occurred,
then the Crucitas project could have continued, and Infinito’s investments would not
have been rendered substantially worthless.”>"°

(iii) Discussion

The Tribunal can dispense with determining whether, under the terms of Article XII(1),
the Claimant must make out a prima facie case on damages in addition to a prima
facie case on breach. Indeed, what matters for the purposes of a possible prima facie
test on damages is that the facts as alleged may constitute a loss. There is no
question that this requirement is met here. What act may constitute a breach, if any,
and whether that act can have caused the damages claimed are different questions,
which exceed the limited scope of the prima facie test and must be dealt with at the
merits stage.

The Respondent’s Objections under Article XII(3)

a. Are the Claimant’s Claims Barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT
Because They Challenge Measures Regarding which the Costa Rican
Courts Have Already Rendered Judgment?

(i) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent highlights the unusual nature of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. It first
argues that it is not a “fork-in-the-road” clause: rather than providing investors with a
choice to submit the same dispute either to the courts of the host State or to an
arbitral tribunal, this clause bars any claim against measures “regarding” which a
Costa Rican court has rendered a judgment. Unlike a fork-in-the-road clause, this
provision does not require that the Costa Rican judicial proceedings and the investor-
State proceedings satisfy the triple identity test.°° However, in its later submissions,
it argues that this provision is similar to (but broader than) a fork-in-the-road clause,
although it recognizes that it does not include many of the limitations contained in
such clauses.*°

The Respondent submits that, pursuant to Article 31 of the VCLT, this provision must
be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms in
their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT. With respect to the
ordinary meaning of Article XII(3)(d), the following submissions are made:

a. While the starting point should be the ordinary meaning of the provision, an
ordinary meaning that leads to an illogical result should not be accepted.**' In
addition, where, as here, there are several equally authentic versions of a treaty,
it may be necessary to consider the terms in each of the authentic languages.°2
Further, in accordance with Article 31(4) of the VCLT, the ordinary meaning does
not apply where a special meaning has been agreed by the parties.°°>

b. In accordance with the ordinary meaning of its terms, it is “clear that Article
XII(3)(d) constitutes a limitation of arbitral jurisdiction in an investor-State dispute
under the BIT.”

c. All that is required to trigger this bar is a judgment of a Costa Rican court
“regarding” the measure in question. The ordinary meaning of the term
“regarding” is broad and “must be understood to cover a broad range of possible
relationships between the challenged measure and the relevant Costa Rican
judgment,” denoting “a situation in which the measure in question has any type of

259.

genuine connection with the Costa Rican court judgment.” For the
Respondent, the word “regarding” must be equated with “concerning,” “about” or
“related to.”3°° This is consistent with the authentic Spanish version of the
provision, which uses the terms “relativo a la medida’ (i.e., “related” to the
measure), and to the equally authentic French version, which uses the words “au
sujet de la mesure,” which the Respondent translates as “on the subject of” or
“about” the measure.*?”

The Respondent notes that Article XII(3)(d) is asymmetric. It only applies to cases in
which Canadian investors contest measures regarding which a Costa Rican court has
issued a judgment, not cases brought by Costa Rican investors against measures
taken by Canada. This shows that this provision was specifically negotiated with the
Costa Rican judiciary in mind.326

According to the Respondent, “the obvious intended effect of Article XII(3)(d) of the
BIT is to prevent Canadian investors from overriding the judgments of Costa Rican
courts before international arbitral tribunals,” which “is precisely what Claimant
attempts to do in this arbitration."°° As noted above, the Respondent contends that
the Tribunal need not accept the Claimant’s characterization of the measure, and that
the real measure at the heart of the Claimant's case is the 2010 TCA Decision that
annulled Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession.**° However, because there are
multiple judgments of the Costa Rican courts “regarding” this annulment, this claim is
barred under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT:

a. The 2010 TCA Decision has been the subject of the judgment of a Costa Rican
court, specifically of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision which ruled on
Industrias Infinito’s cassation request regarding the 2010 TCA Decision.**"

b. The 2010 TCA Decision is, in itself, a judgment rendered by a Costa Rican court
regarding the annulment.°°2

c. The 2010 TCA Decision was also the subject of the 2013 Constitutional Chamber
Decision.3%3

The Respondent contends that a direct challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision is thus
barred by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. It is for this reason that, in an attempt to

circumvent this provision, the Claimant formally challenges other measures.
However, this attempt must fail because the claims regarding these measures “rest
almost entirely on the premise that the 2010 TCA Judgment was wrongly decided.”>*

In any event, even if one were to consider that the “measures” formally challenged by
the Claimant are the relevant measures, they are all barred under Article XII(3)(d)
because they are all measures “regarding” which the Costa Rican courts have
rendered a judgment:

a.

The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision is in itself a judgment of Costa Rica’s
highest court. According to the Respondent, “it is impossible to identify a
measure more closely related to a Costa Rican court judgment than a judicial
‘measure,’ especially when such measure consists in upholding another Costa
Rican court judgment.” A contrary interpretation “would render the treaty
provision essentially meaningless because it could always be circumvented by
defining the judicial decision (rather than the act regarding which that judgment
was rendered), as the relevant ‘measure.””°>

Likewise, the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision is also a judgment of a
Costa Rican court.°%”

Seen from a different perspective, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision,
the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision and the 2012 MINAE Resolution are
all “measures” related to the 2010 TCA Decision, which is in itself a judgment of a
Costa Rican Court.

The 2010 Executive Moratorium and the 2011 Legislative Moratorium have also
been subject to multiple judgments of the Costa Rican courts. The 2010
Executive Moratorium was comprised of two executive decrees (the Arias
Moratorium Decree and the Chinchilla Moratorium Decree), as well as the 2011
Legislative Moratorium, which all were challenged before the Constitutional
Chamber of the Supreme Court. In each case, the Constitutional Chamber
dismissed the challenge. With respect to the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, the
Constitutional Chamber even considered and rejected claims that it violated the
BIT (the fact that the plaintiff was not Industrias Infinito is irrelevant for present
purposes, because the Article XII(3)(d) does not require that the judgment
regarding the “measure” involve the same parties).°°°

265.

According to the Respondent, all of these judgments are “regarding” the annulment of
the Claimant’s Concession, which is the real measure challenged by the Claimant.*°
As recognized in Methanex, upon which the Claimant relies, the term “regarding”
refers to a legally significant connection. For the Respondent, “[t]here can be no
dispute that the connection between Costa Rican judgments and what Claimant's BIT
claim is about is a legally significant one.”*“" In any event, the Respondent maintains
that it is perfectly possible for a measure to be “regarding,” “concerning” or “related to”
itself.*4? In addition, “in the case of judgments, it is appropriate to distinguish between
the substantive content of the judgment (i.e. the operative part of the decision) and
the form of the ruling (ie. a written judgment),” and “the written judgment is
necessarily ‘regarding’ the substantive content included therein,” being “the
substantive content, not the form, which is ‘alleged to be in breach’ of the BIT.”58

The Respondent also argues that the Claimant’s interpretation has the effect of
excluding from the scope of the Respondent’s exception to consent any challenges
that question the judgment itself. According to the Respondent, “[t]here is no logical
reason why measures that are the subject of a judgment should be excluded from the
scope of the dispute resolution clause, while measures that are themselves
judgments should be covered.”** This interpretation leads to an absurd result and
cannot be accepted.

As noted in Section IV.C.3.b supra, the Respondent also argues that judicial
measures are excluded from the scope of the BIT, which supports Costa Rica’s
interpretation that Article XII(3)(d) excludes challenges to decisions by Costa Rica’s
judiciary.

Contrary to the Claimant's contentions, the Respondent asserts that its interpretation
is consistent with the context of the provision. It is entirely consistent with other
provisions of the BIT and with the fact that it does not contain many of the limitations
typically found in a fork-in-the-road clause.**° By contrast, according to the
Respondent, the Claimant’s arguments on context are incoherent:

a. The Claimant acknowledges that the BIT contains a special definition of the term
“measure,” but then proceeds to ignore that definition, asserting that the term is
generally understood to encompass judicial measures.°*°

b. Even if the BIT’s definition of “measure” should be read to include judicial
decisions, it does not follow that judicial breaches must be arbitrable. According

to the Respondent, ‘[i]t is quite common for investment treaties to provide
protection against a wide range of breaches, but to restrict international dispute
resolution concerning such measures to a narrower subset.”*”

c. The jurisdictional limitation contained in Article XII(3)(d) cannot be inconsistent
with Costa Rica’s “unconditional consent” to arbitration, as the Claimant
suggests, because such “unconditional consent” has been given in accordance
with the provisions of the entirety of Article XII, which includes the carve-out in
Article XII(3)(d).348

d. The fact that Article VIII(1) of the BIT gives investors the opportunity for judicial
review of expropriations in Costa Rica is not inconsistent with Costa Rica’s
interpretation of Article XII(3)(d).° The BIT does not impose a requirement to
exhaust domestic remedies, but if judicial remedies are invoked and result in a
judgment, Article XII(3)(d) precludes an investor from bringing another challenge
by means of international arbitration.

e. Costa Rica’s interpretation is not inconsistent with its substantive obligation to
provide FET, insofar as that obligation must be understood to include an
obligation not to deny justice in domestic courts. The Claimant confuses the
existence of a substantive obligation with the question of which treaty breaches
are subject to arbitration. While Costa Rica agrees in principle that the minimum
standard of treatment under international law includes a protection against denial
of justice, “Article II(2)(a) of the BIT makes no mention of judicial measures or
denial of justice per se, meaning that nothing in the particular wording of the
clause contradicts Costa Rica’s assertion that, under Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT,
Costa Rican court judgments are not subject to review through arbitration.”°°°

While the Respondent agrees with the Claimant’ that treaty terms should be
interpreted to ensure that each term has meaning (effet utile), it views the Claimant's
interpretation as lacking effet utile. lt defies common sense to interpret Article
XII(3)(d) as a provision that “encourages (without requiring) pursuit of local remedies,
[...] and shields lower court decisions from arbitral review when a final domestic
decision has been rendered,” as the Claimant contends.*** It is illogical to interpret a
provision that prohibits arbitration where a judgment has been rendered by a Costa
Rican court as encouraging the pursuit of local remedies. The provision clearly
discourages the pursuit of local remedies. In addition, the Claimant’s interpretation
would mean that the exception provided under Article XII(3)(d) would be meaningless

to Costa Rica, as an investor could always circumvent it by not challenging the lower
court decision directly.2°

In any event, the Respondent argues that, even on the Claimant's interpretation,
Article XII(3)(d) would bar a challenge to the 2010 TCA Decision, because the
Claimant does not contest that a final domestic decision has been rendered regarding
that judgment.°54

As to the object and purpose of the treaty, the Respondent disagrees with the
Claimant’s suggestion that Article XII(3)(d) must be interpreted restrictively because
the object and purpose of the BIT is to promote investment. According to Costa Rica,
“[i]nvestment treaties are always intended to promote investment, but this does not
mean that exceptions to a Contracting Party’s consent to arbitration under such
treaties must be read narrowly.” As recognized by multiple courts and tribunals, “a
sovereign State’s expression of consent to arbitration must be unambiguous, and that
consent cannot be implied or expanded simply by reference to the object and purpose
of the treaty.” Indeed, “numerous BITs promote investment without providing any
recourse to investment arbitration at all, or by limiting it in ways that are much more
severe than the limitations imposed by this BIT.”°°”

Nor does Costa Rica’s interpretation unreasonably preclude arbitration, as the
Claimant suggests:

a. The Claimant's argument that, under Costa Rica’s interpretation, the State could
always defeat jurisdiction by launching a challenge of the measure and ensuring
that its courts reject that challenge, “implies the existence of collusion between
administrative authorities and the courts to deny an investor its day in court.”**
In such a scenario, a tribunal may well find that the State is estopped by its own
bad faith conduct from invoking an otherwise valid jurisdictional exception. Here,
however, there is no suggestion that Costa Rica initiated judicial challenges in
bad faith, nor can it be disputed that the Claimant took full advantage of the
Costa Rican court system to defend its Concession.°°°

b. With respect to the Claimant's suggestion that it would be inappropriate to
interpret Article XII(3)(d) as precluding arbitration related to judgments in
proceedings in which the Claimant did not take part, the Respondent argues that
it is for the Tribunal to determine whether the relevant judgment is sufficiently
related to the measure being challenged. Here, however, the Respondent notes
that the Claimant participated in all the key proceedings in this case, with the
exception of those cited by Costa Rica with respect to the 2010 Moratorium. That
said, the Respondent insists that these judgments are sufficiently related to the
challenged measure as to fall within the scope of Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT.

The Respondent notes that its interpretation is not based on the travaux préparatoires
or on other supplementary means of interpretation. It is based on the primary
interpretation rules of Article 31 of the VCLT. The Respondent alleges that the
travaux do not contain much information on the drafting history of Article XII(3)(d),
and that the Claimant's suggestion that it was intended as a compromise on the
exhaustion of local remedies finds no support in the travaux.°*' Even if there had
been a link between the discussions on exhaustion of local remedies and Article
XII(3)(d), it would support Costa Rica’s interpretation, as a provision similar to (but
broader than) a fork-in-the-road clause. The Respondent argues in this respect that
“[a]n exhaustion of remedies requirement, however, is flatly inconsistent with a ‘fork-
in-the-road’ provision, insofar as the first requires and the other prohibits access to
domestic courts before resorting to arbitration;” “[i]t is therefore hardly surprising that,
[...] following the inclusion of Article XII(3)(d), Costa Rica dropped its earlier proposal
to include an exhaustion of remedies requirement.”°?

In any event, the Respondent asserts that the circumstances of the conclusion of the
BIT confirm Costa Rica’s pride in its legal system and its belief that its system was
fully in compliance with international law concerning due process and investor rights.
The Respondent notes in this regard that the memorandum accompanying Costa
Rica’s submission of the BIT for ratification by the legislature concluded that the
“costs of ratifying such BITs were low because they did not provide for a level of
protection beyond that already existing under domestic law.”

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its claims are barred by Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. None of
the measures that it challenges in this arbitration have been the subject of a judgment
of a Costa Rican court.%** The Respondent mischaracterizes Infinito’s claims as an
attack against the 2010 TCA Decision, but this is not Infinito’s case.°°> Its case is

that, as a composite whole, the four measures that it challenges “had the combined
effect of stripping Infinito of all of its rights, barring it from seeking any sort of
meaningful remedy, and eliminating any possibility of proceeding with the Crucitas
project.”266

Specifically, the Claimant alleges that:

a.

There is no judgment of a Costa Rican court regarding the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision.**” The Claimant notes that this decision was made by an
appellate court in Costa Rica and is not subject to review by Costa Rican courts.
Indeed, part of Infinito’s claim is based on the lack of availability of judicial
recourse to address the inconsistency created by this decision. As explained
further below, the Claimant denies that this decision is a judgment “regarding”
itself for purposes of Article XII(3)(d). The Claimant also denies that the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision was a judgment “regarding” the 2011
Administrative Decision; it was a statement by the Constitutional Chamber that it
was not empowered to render a judgment regarding the 2010 TCA Decision.

There is no judgment regarding the application of the 2011 Legislative
Moratorium to the Las Crucitas Project. The court decisions to which Costa Rica
refers relate to the application of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium and previous
moratorium decrees to other parties and other projects. As explained below,
these decisions do not fall under the scope or Article XII(3)(d).°%

There is no judgment regarding the 2012 MINAE Resolution. Contrary to Costa
Rica’s contention, the 2010 TCA Decision cannot be understood to be a
judgment “regarding” the 2012 MINAE Resolution. While the 2012 MINAE
Resolution may be “regarding” the 2010 TCA Decision and the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, the reverse is not true. But Article XII(3)(d)
does not “bar challenges to administrative measures that were adopted
subsequently to judgments and that go further than what those judgments
require.”%69

Likewise, there is no judgment regarding the 2013 Constitutional Chamber
Decision. This decision, which dismissed Industrias Infinito’s unconstitutionality
action on admissibility grounds, has never been the subject of any Costa Rican
judgment.2”°

e. Finally, the Claimant contends that there is no judgment regarding the composite
impact of the individual measures.°”!

The Claimant submits that, for a claim to be barred under Article XII(3)(d), two
conditions must be satisfied: (i) there must be a measure alleged by the Claimant to
be in breach of the BIT, and (ii) there must be a judgment regarding that measure.°”
The Claimant interprets these conditions as follows, according to the plain meaning of
the terms of Article XII(3)(d):

a. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) supra, the “measure that is alleged to be in
breach” of the BIT must be the measure that the Claimant alleges is in breach of
the BIT, not the measure as redefined by the Respondent. Likewise, the “breach”
that has been alleged must be assessed, at the jurisdictional level, as pleaded by
the Claimant.

b. As discussed in Section IV.C.3.b(ii) supra, the term “measure” includes
judgments.

c. The judgment “regarding” the measure alleged to be in breach must be an act
different from the measure. The term “regarding” denotes a connection between
the relevant measure and the relevant judgment, which in turn requires at least
two discrete entities or acts. To permit the “judgment” to be the same act as the
“measure” would be contrary to the ordinary meaning of the term “regarding.”*”*
As a result, a judgment cannot be “regarding” itself, as the Respondent
maintains.

Accordingly, under the Claimant's interpretation, judicial measures may be challenged
under the BIT, with the following limitations: (i) if a lower court judgment has been
challenged by an appeal, it cannot be challenged; and (ii) if the measure is an
appellate judgment, the investor may only challenge the final measure in the chain of
appeals.° In this manner, “Costa Rican courts have the opportunity to reverse the
harmful effects of lower court judgments on investments, and to remedy breaches of
international law, before a dispute is submitted to arbitration. If the investment is
harmed as a result of the final appellate decision, such that the harm becomes final,
the investor may challenge the last judgment.”°”°

The Claimant adds that, if the investor's investment has been harmed by an
executive, administrative, or legislative measure, the investor may challenge that
measure directly under the BIT. If in turn the measure has been the subject of the

judgment of a Costa Rican court, the investor may challenge that judgment as
described in the preceding paragraph.*”°

According to the Claimant, this interpretation “reflects the BIT drafters’ confidence in
Costa Rica’s judiciary.”*”’ It “facilitates a robust dispute resolution system that
simultaneously respects the independence and sovereignty of the Costa Rican
judiciary.”°7

The Claimant insists that Article XII(3)(d) is not a fork-in-the-road provision. It is not
designed to make investors choose between domestic and international remedies;
rather, it encourages, but does not require, the exhaustion of local remedies.°”

The Claimant submits that its interpretation is consistent with the interpretive
principles of Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT:

a. As explained above, it is consistent with the plain meaning of the terms “alleged
to be in breach” and “regarding.”*°°

b. It is consistent with the BIT as a whole in light of its context. As explained further
below, there is no support in the context of Article XII(3)(d) for the exclusion of
judicial measures, or requiring only a tenuous connection between the “judgment”
and the “measure.” Likewise, the Claimant argues that its interpretation is
consistent with the remainder of the BIT’s provisions.°*"

c. It is in line with the object and purpose of the BIT, which for the Claimant is the
promotion and protection of investments, as stated in the BIT’s Preamble.%®2
Citing Aguas del Tunari, the Claimant submits that “[t]he ‘primary objective’ of the
BIT is to create the framework, and to select [...] ‘an independent and neutral
forum for the resolution of investment disputes in accordance with a substantive
applicable law’.”*° Its interpretation is further in conformity with the treaty’s
object and purpose, because it “preserves investors’ rights to submit to
international arbitration claims that substantive provisions of the BIT [...] have
been breached.”

d. Its interpretation facilitates the fulfillment of the object and purpose of the BIT by
allowing investors to pursue, without requiring them to exhaust, domestic
remedies. The Claimant notes that the “exhaustion of local remedies is often
considered a requirement for an investor to establish that it has experienced a
denial of justice at the hands of the host state.”*°> With respect to other claims, it
submits that “the pursuit of local remedies is widely accepted as a desirable, if
not necessary, pre-requisite to arbitration, even in the absence of an explicit
exhaustion of local remedies requirement in the relevant BIT.” — Citing
Generation Ukraine, Apotex and Loewen, the Claimant submits that “[t]o qualify
as a final ‘measure’ under the BIT, an investor must make at least a reasonable
effort to obtain local redress.”*°”

e. Finally, the Claimant's interpretation is supported by the available supplementary
interpretative aids under Article 32 of the VLCT, in particular, by the BIT’s travaux
préparatoires. The negotiating history of the BIT shows that Costa Rica
attempted to introduce an exhaustion of local remedies requirement, but Canada
did not accept it. Instead, the parties reached a compromise, reflected in Article
XII(3)(d), which encouraged the use of local remedies.** Only Infinito’s
interpretation of this provision can be reconciled with this intended purpose.*®°

By contrast, the Respondent's interpretation “ignores the ordinary meaning of the
provision, renders portions of the BIT inoperative and offers an interpretation that
conflicts with the object and purpose of the BIT and finds no support in the travaux
préparatoires.”°°

Under Costa Rica’s interpretation, the term “regarding” should be defined to include
even the most incidental connection, regardless of the identity of the parties involved
or whether the judgment has any direct connection to the investor or impact on the
investment. In addition, according to Costa Rica, judicial decisions may never be
challenged because they are judgments “regarding” themselves.°*' Costa Rica also
ignores that the “measure” affected by the judgment must be the one “alleged to be in

breach.” Costa Rica’s interpretation contradicts the plain meaning of these
terms,°°° as well as the context of Article XII(3)(d):

a. “Read in harmony with the broader context of the BIT, the ‘judgment’ must be
‘regarding’ the application of the ‘measure’ to Infinito before Article XII(3)(d) will
be engaged;” “[iJt is not enough for there to be a tenuous, immaterial connection
or for the judgment to relate to aspects of the measure not directed at Infinito’s
investments.”*%

b. Citing Methanex, where the tribunal was interpreting the phrase “relating to,” the
Claimant argues that the term “regarding” should be “defined with some form of
logical limit, that requires proximity between the investor, measure and
judgment.” For a “judgment” to be “regarding” a “measure [...] alleged to be in
breach,” it must relate to the investor's allegation as to how that measure
breached its rights. Accordingly, “the judgment must relate to the application of
the measure to Infinito or its investments.”°° According to the Claimant, ‘[t]he
question is not whether there are any judgments relating to Infinito’s claims;” the
question is “whether there are judgments regarding the measures alleged to be in
breach.”*°”

c. Nor can a judgment be “regarding” itself: as explained above, the term
“regarding” requires a connection between two discrete entities. The Respondent
cannot circumvent this requirement by artificially bifurcating judgments into
written reasons and dispositive results: “[w]hen investors challenge judicial
measures, they challenge the ‘obligation created by the decree of the court;’ the
‘measure’ is the ‘judgment.’”°°2

Costa Rica’s interpretation would also exclude any challenge to a judicial measure,
even if the claim is for denial of justice or expropriation.*°° According to the Claimant,
this is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning and context of Article XII(3)(d), as
evidenced by other provisions of the BIT. According to Article I(i) of the BIT, a
“measure” includes “any law, regulation, procedure, requirement or practice,” which
encompasses judicial decisions and processes, as recognized in Article 4 of the ILC
Articles on State Responsibility, which provides that “[t]he conduct of any State organ
shall be considered an act of that State under international law, whether the organ

exercises legislative, executive, judicial or any other functions [...]," and by
international tribunals.4°° While the ordinary meaning of a term may be supplanted by
a special agreed meaning, the party invoking a special meaning must meet a high
burden of proof, which the Respondent has failed to meet.*°’ To the contrary, the list
in Article I(i) of the BIT is non-exhaustive (as evidenced by the use of the word
“includes”) and already encompasses judicial measures (which are included in the
categories of law, procedure, requirement and practice).*2

In addition, under Costa Rica’s interpretation, an investor would never be able to
challenge an executive, administrative or legislative measure, if it has been the
subject of a Costa Rican judgment. Nor could the investor challenge the court
judgment.“ By insulating all judicial measures from review, Costa Rica’s
interpretation would render many treaty provisions meaningless, including Costa
Rica’s unconditional consent to arbitration (Article XII(5) of the BIT), the right to seek
judicial review of an expropriatory measure (Article VIII(2) of the BIT), Costa Rica’s
obligation not to deny justice (Article II(2)(a) of the BIT).4° Referring to Pope &
Talbot, the Claimant argues that “[t]o exclude all judicial measures from the scope of
the BIT would create a ‘gaping loophole in international protections’ against state
conduct that breaches the protections of the BIT.”4°

The Respondent's interpretation would also be inconsistent with the purpose of the
BIT. For the Claimant, “[a]n interpretation that undermines the entire operative force
of the treaty frustrates [its] primary objective of facilitating the dispute resolution
mechanism deliberately established in the BIT.”4°° Indeed, “[iJnstead of creating a
functional framework for dispute resolution, it would render the substantive
protections in the BIT ineffective by allowing Costa Rica to shield its measures from
challenge under the BIT in almost every case merely by ensuring that a judgment of a
Costa Rican court were adopted ‘regarding’ any measure that could be the subject of
a challenge.”“””

With respect to the applicability of supplementary means of interpretation under
Article 32 of the VCLT, the Claimant submits that tribunals may turn to them only

when the ordinary meaning, context, object and purpose of a treaty provision leads to
a “manifestly absurd or unreasonable” result; not when the result is illogical, as the
Respondent contends. For the Claimant, “[t]reaty interpreters are not empowered to
consider the ‘logic’ of a provision; rather, Article 32 of the VCLT and the principle of
effet utile are directed towards avoiding ‘manifestly absurd’ results,” i.e., results that
“render[] a provision meaningless or [...] ‘untenable as a matter of international
law.’"4°8 Even then, tribunals cannot ignore the text of the provision; “they are simply
permitted to consider supplementary means of interpretation and to attempt to read
treaty provisions in a way that does not render them absurd or strip them of legal
effect.”4°°

In particular, Article 32 of the VCLT limits recourse to evidence of the parties’
intentions. The Claimant submits that presumed intention is irrelevant; intention will
only be relevant if it is derived from the text of the treaty or, if the text leads to
ambiguity or absurdity, from acceptable supplementary means of interpretation.“"°
The Respondent asserts that “objective evidence” of the parties’ intentions may be
considered under appropriate circumstances, but does not define this term.‘
Instead, it asks the Tribunal “to consider its unsupported assertions of what the
parties must have thought, without providing any text-based support for its
position.”“'? There is no textual support in the BIT or travaux préparatoires for the
Respondent's interpretation of Article XII(3)(d). In particular, the Claimant makes the
following submissions:

a. As explained above, the travaux préparatoires show that Costa Rica insisted on a
provision that would require the exhaustion of local remedies. The fact that the
drafters previously discussed and removed an exhaustion of local remedies
clause does not demonstrate, as Costa Rica now alleges, that Article XII(3)(d) is
a fork-in-the-road clause. It is “nonsensical” to argue that “the treaty drafters
decided, after months of debating one possible clause, to replace it with an
entirely unique clause that had the opposite effect, without any related
discussion.”4"3

b. Nor is there any evidence in the travaux that the parties intended to insulate all
judgments from being challenged under the BIT: had the parties intended this
result, they presumably would have said so explicitly, for instance by excluding
judicial measures from the definition of “measure.”“"

c. The Claimant also argues that the parties’ intentions cannot be discerned from
Costa Rica’s pride in its judiciary. While the Claimant “does not dispute that
Costa Rica is proud of its judiciary; it challenges the impermissible leap from that
pride to Costa Rica’s proposed interpretation of Article XII(3)(d), which is made
without evidence or justification.”“"5

d. The Claimant finally objects to Costa Rica’s reliance on an internal memorandum
that stated that certain rights enshrined in the BIT were also protected under
Costa Rica’s constitution.“"* This evidence is not probative. Even if it were
relevant (quod non), it provides no support for Costa Rica’s argument, as it refers
to the substantive content of Costa Rica’s constitution, not the procedure it
agreed for international arbitration.“"”

(iii) Discussion

The question before the Tribunal is whether Infinito’s claims are barred under
Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT. For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal recalls that the
relevant part of the provision reads as follows:

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to
arbitration in accordance with paragraph (4) only if:
[1

(d) in cases where Costa Rica is a party to the dispute, no judgement
has been rendered by a Costa Rican court regarding the measure
that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement.*!®

To establish the meaning of this provision which is disputed, the Tribunal will apply
the rules of interpretation contained in Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT. It will thus in
good faith assess the ordinary meaning of the terms taken in their context in the light
of the object and purpose of the BIT (Article 31). If the interpretation performed in
application of these rules leaves the meaning “ambiguous or obscure” or leads to a
result which is “manifestly absurd or unreasonable,” the interpreter may resort to
supplementary means of interpretation such as the travaux préparatoires. |t may also
do so to confirm the meaning emerging from the interpretation obtained based on
primary means of interpretation (Article 32).

As noted by the Claimant, two conditions must be satisfied for Article XII(3)(d) to
apply: (i) there must be a measure alleged by the claimant to be in breach of the BIT,
and (ii) there must be a judgment regarding that measure.

Applying Article 31 of the VCLT, the Tribunal interprets the first condition (i) as
meaning the measure pleaded by the Claimant to be in breach of the BIT, considering

292.

both the measure and the breach as formulated by the Claimant. This is consistent
with the ordinary meaning of the term “alleged,” which is used as a verb in this
provision and should be considered a synonym to “pleaded” or “claimed.” It is also
consistent with the Tribunal’s finding at paragraph 187 supra that it must assess the
Claimant's case as it has pleaded it. It is recalled that the Claimant has alleged that
four measures breach the BIT: (i) the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, which
the Claimant alleges annulled Industrias Infinito’s 2008 Concession; (ii) the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision, which the Claimant alleges refused to resolve the
conflict between that Chamber's decision and the 2010 TCA Decision; (iii) the 2012
MINAE Resolution, which the Claimant alleges cancelled Industrias Infinito’s 2008
Concession and extinguished all of its mining rights; and (iv) the 2011 Legislative
Moratorium, which the Claimant alleges prevented Industrias Infinito from obtaining a
new exploitation concession.

The measures alleged to be in breach of the BIT must also be “measures” within the
meaning of Article I(i) of the BIT. The Tribunal has already found at Section
IV.C.3.b(iii) supra that judicial decisions are included in Article I(i)’s definition of
“measure.”

As a second condition, Article XII(3)(d) requires the existence of a judgment
“regarding” the measure alleged to be in breach. Relying on the plain meaning and
the context of the provision, the Tribunal interprets the term “regarding” to refer to a
legally relevant connection between two elements, the “measure” on the one hand
and the “judgment” on the other. In the Tribunal’s view, not every legally relevant
connection will suffice: the judgment must be “about” the measure. Stated differently,
the measure must be the subject matter (or at least, part of the subject matter) of the
judgment. This is consistent with the equally authentic versions of the BIT in Spanish
and French. The Spanish version uses the terms “relativo a la medida,” which,
means “in relation to the measure” (and not, as the Respondent suggests, “related to
the measure” — the correct translation of that term would be “relacionado a la
medida’). Likewise, the French version employs the words “au sujet de la mesure,”
which means “in respect of” or “in relation to” the measure. In other words, the
Tribunal considers that the effect of Article XII(3)(d) is to bar claims when the
measure in question has already been adjudicated (i.e., subject of a judgment) by a
Costa Rican court.

The Tribunal does not accept Costa Rica’s argument that a measure that is in itself a
judgment can be a “judgment” about itself for purposes of Article XII(3)(d). As noted
above, the use of the word “regarding” clearly requires two elements, a measure and
a judgment about that measure. Nor does the Tribunal accept Costa Rica’s
contention that a written judgment can be distinguished from its substantive content
(i.e. its operative part), the written part being “regarding” the substantive content.
When a judgment is alleged to be a measure that breaches the BIT, it must be
considered in its totality. The act of the State is the judgment in its entirety. While in
most cases the alleged breach of international law will derive from the dispositif, the
latter will be informed by the reasons. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that, for
Article XII(3)(d) to be triggered, the measures challenged by the Claimant must have

94

294.

295.

297.

been the subject of a separate judgment by a Costa Rican court. The fact that two of
the challenged measures are themselves judgments is insufficient to meet this
requirement.

The Tribunal interprets Article XII(3)(d) as barring claims against acts of the executive
or legislative branches of the Costa Rican State (in other words, any non-judicial acts)
once there has been a judgment on these acts. It also bars claims against a judicial
act if there has been a separate judgment about that first judicial act. In other words,
once a judgment has been rendered (be it final or not) on any State act, and that
judgment has a direct connection to the investor, an investor cannot bring a claim that
the State act breaches the BIT. However, the investor is not barred from alleging that
the judgment adjudicating on the State act is a breach of the BIT. It is a different
question what substantive protections are available against a judgment when the
judgment is the measure alleged to be in breach, as compared to the protections
available against the underlying State act, but this is a debate that belongs to the
merits.

The Tribunal does not believe that this leads to an absurd or even illogical result. It is
perfectly reasonable for Costa Rica to bar claims against a particular State measure
when the measure in question has already been adjudicated by a Costa Rican court.
This reflects the BIT Contracting Parties’ confidence in the Costa Rican judiciary and
a desire for procedural economy. However, it would be contrary to the context of the
provision, as well as the object and purpose of the BIT, to exclude claims against the
judgment adjudicating the measure. This could void the procedural and substantive
protections which the Respondent granted to qualifying investors through the BIT of
any meaning, as every measure could potentially be the subject of judicial
proceedings in Costa Rica.

The Tribunal believes that this interpretation is consistent with the ordinary meaning
of the terms of Article XII(3)(d) taken in their context in light of the object and purpose
of the BIT. It does not find that the travaux préparatoires cast a different light.

After assessing the record, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant has established
that no judgment by a Costa Rican court has been rendered “regarding” the
measures which it alleges to breach the BIT. Specifically, there is no judgment of a
Costa Rican court regarding the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision. This is a
judgment issued by Costa Rica’s highest court (the Supreme Court) acting as an
appellate court, and it is not subject to review in Costa Rica. Likewise, there is no
judgment of a Costa Rican court regarding the 2013 Constitutional Chamber
Decision. To date, there has been no judgment regarding the 2012 MINAE
Resolution either. The fact that the resolution implements the 2010 TCA Decision is
irrelevant for present purposes. While the 2012 MINAE Resolution may be
“regarding” the 2010 TCA Decision, there is no judgment “regarding” the 2012 MINAE
Resolution. Finally, while the Respondent argues that there have been judgments in
Costa Rica regarding the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, none of these judgments has
a significant connection to the Claimant or to the measure alleged to be in breach.

The Tribunal thus finds that the Claimant's claims are not barred by Article XII(3)(d).
b. Are Infinito’s Claims Time-Barred under Article XII(3)(c)?
(i) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent contends that Infinito’s claims concern measures which are time-
barred under the statute of limitations specified in Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT.
Pursuant to this provision, an investor may only submit a claim to arbitration if “not
more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the investor first
acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach and
knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.”"® The measures that
really caused the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant occurred before the cut-off
date for the statute of limitations.

The Respondent submits that the Tribunal must address three issues to determine
this objection:42°

a. First, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period.

b. Second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of
the alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date. The Respondent submits
that the “treaty [...] requires identification of the moment when, for the first time,
Infinito knew or should have known that its rights to the Crucitas project had been
impaired.”** For the Respondent, [t]he triggering event is not certainty of such
impairment;” [nJor is it relevant whether because of later governmental action, the
relevant impairment may have been magnified.”4”? In this respect, the Tribunal
must also determine “when there is an earlier measure along with a later one that
confirms, implements, and/or reinstates the earlier one, which one should be
considered relevant for purposes of this Clause of the Treaty.”7° The
Respondent submits that “[t]he Tribunal must objectively determine the relevant
facts for purposes of jurisdictional issues, including this one, and it need not
accept blindly the Claimant's factual characterizations.”4*

c. Third, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it
had incurred loss or damage before the cut-off date. The Respondent
emphasizes that the BIT asks when the Claimant first acquired knowledge of
having incurred loss or damage; it does not require the loss to be complete, final

or irreversible.*© Relying on Mondev and Grand River, the Respondent
contends that “damage or injury may be incurred even though the amount or
extent may not become known until some future time.”47°

With respect to (a), the Respondent notes that the Parties have agreed that the cut-
off date is 6 February 2011, which is three years prior to the date on which the
Claimant filed its Request for Arbitration (6 February 2014).*?” This means that “the
Tribunal must dismiss Infinito's claims if, prior to 6 February 2011, Infinito had already
acquired either actual or constructive knowledge of the alleged breach or breaches
and of any loss or damage resulting from such breach or breaches.”*”°

With respect to (b) and (c), the Respondent contends that the Claimant already knew
or should have known of the alleged breach or breaches, and of the losses that
allegedly derived therefrom, before 6 February 2011. “[Rlegardless of how Claimant
characterizes or spins the relevant breaches, the Tribunal must focus on the actual
source of the harm that's being alleged.”*9 The Respondent submits that the four
measures challenged by the Claimant “derive from two earlier measures which are
the truly relevant ones for purposes of the statute of limitations analysis.”*°° The real
sources of the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant are (i) the 2010 TCA Decision,
and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratorium. As a result, these are the actual breaches for
purposes of the statute of limitations analysis, and what matters is the date on which
the Claimant first acquired knowledge of these measures and of the loss or damage
arising from them.

With respect to the 2010 TCA Decision, the Respondent argues that (as the Claimant
itself has recognized)**' the principal grievance alleged by the Claimant is the loss of
its 2008 Concession.‘ As a matter of Costa Rican law, this annulment was caused
by the 2010 TCA Decision.** While formally the Claimant challenges the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAE Resolution, and the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision, all of these measures either implemented or
confirmed the 2010 TCA Decision. The fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was
suspended pending the appeal to the Administrative Chamber is irrelevant. NAFTA

jurisprudence confirms that “the limitation period under Article XII(3)(c) ‘is not subject
to any suspension [...] prolongation or other qualification’ and cannot not be tolled by
the simple expedient of instituting litigation against the disputed measure.”**

The Respondent points out that, under Article XII(3)(c), an investor “first” acquires
knowledge of an alleged breach and loss at a particular “date.” For the Respondent,
“[s]uch knowledge cannot ‘first’ be acquired at multiple points in time or on a recurring
basis.“ Here, the Claimant first acquired knowledge of its alleged loss or damage
with the issuance of the 2010 TCA Decision in December 2010, and acknowledged
this publicly in a press release dated 18 January 2011,“%° both before the cut-off
date.‘°’ In that press release, the Claimant stated that it was seeking to reestablish
the value of its investments and to reverse the negative impact of the 2010 TCA
Decision on the company’s share price.“*® While the cassation proceedings could
have provided hope that the Administrative Chamber would reverse the Claimant’s
loss, the fact that the 2010 TCA Decision was not reversed cannot be equated to a
new loss.“*° Moreover, Infinito was not certain that it would be able to reverse the
2010 TCA Decision, and the fact that it acknowledged that it needed to “restor{e] the
Company's rights or value” underscores that it believed that it had already suffered a
loss.4°

As to the 2011 Legislative Moratorium, while the Claimant formally challenges the
legislative amendment which entered into force on 10 February 2011, the
Respondent argues that this measure could not have caused it any damage, because
the Claimant was already precluded from obtaining new permits as a result of the
2010 Executive Moratorium, which had been in place since May 2010 and was not
abrogated by the 2011 Legislative Moratorium.**'

Further, Infinito’s argument that it was not affected by the 2010 Executive Moratorium,
because it was only after the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision that the 2011
Legislative Moratorium had an impact on its investment, is factually and legally
flawed. Factually, the Claimant was aware of the loss of its Concession since the
date of the 2010 TCA Decision. Legally, it is irrelevant when the Claimant actually
became aware of the loss of its Concession; what matters is that it should have

known about the existing moratorium, which applied to Infinito from the moment of its
enactment.“42

In response to the argument that the Tribunal must focus on the breaches as alleged
by the Claimant, the Respondent contends that the Claimant has no right to tactically
plead its case in a way designed to defeat temporal limitations established in a
treaty.“7 The fact that the BIT refers to an “alleged” breach does not mean that the
Tribunal must accept the Claimant’s characterization of the breaches. The word
“alleged” is simply used to denote that a breach has not been established; it “does not
imply that, to resolve a jurisdictional issue, such as the applicability of a statute of
limitations, a Tribunal may not look beyond what is ‘alleged’.”“44 Investment
arbitration jurisprudence confirms that it is for the Tribunal, applying an objective
standard, to identify the relevant breach, and that “if [a] claimant was harmed by a
particular measure that is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the claimant cannot
overcome the jurisdictional bar merely by pretending that their [sic] challenge is
targeted at a different set of measures.”“® According to the Respondent,
“[s]ubstance must prevail over form, and tribunals must take care to distinguish
between, on the one hand, good faith arguments that a treaty’s temporal
requirements have been satisfied, and, on the other, abusive attempts to defeat a
temporal objection by means of unilateral characterizations and artful pleading.”““° In
support, the Respondent relies in particular on the following cases:

a. Corona, in which the tribunal held that “[w]here a ‘series of similar and related
actions by a respondent state’ is at issue, an investor cannot evade the
limitations period by basing its claim on ‘the most recent transgression in that
series.'"44”

b. Vieira, where the tribunal found that the dispute predated the relevant treaty
because all of the claims derived from the State’s denial of a fishing license
application before the treaty entered into force. This was despite the claimant's
argument that appeals were filed after the treaty had entered into force, and that
the fact they had been denied constituted separate violations of the treaty.“®

c. ST-AD, where an attempt by a claimant to acquire jurisdiction by resubmitting an
application that had been denied before it became an investor was rejected by
the tribunal: “a tactic based on the resubmission of an application that has been

denied before a claimant becomes an investor after it has acquired such status is
unacceptable. It creates an illusion of an event that happened when a protected
investor was on the scene. But like all illusions, it is a misleading illusion.”"“°

Contrary to the Claimant's contention, the 2010 TCA Decision is not merely a
background fact that may inform the Tribunal’s analysis; it is the central judgment that
produced the legal effects that the Claimant complains of in this arbitration. The
Claimant’s reliance on Tecmed is misplaced as, contrary to the situation in that case,
here the Claimant fully assessed the significance and effects of the 2010 TCA
Decision as soon as it was issued.° Renée Rose Levy is similarly inapposite, as
here it is clear that the dispute crystallized on the date of the annulment of Infinito’s
2008 Concession by the 2010 TCA Decision.**' Nor can the Claimant rely on Apotex
and Mondev for the proposition that, in cases involving judicial decisions, an injury
typically does not crystallize until the final decision is rendered: the question under
Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT is when Infinito itself first believed that its rights had been
violated and that it suffered a loss.*** Indeed, the tribunal in Apotex dismissed one of
the claims (arising from administrative proceedings) as untimely, and held that a
claimant cannot use late court proceedings to toll the earlier limitation period.**
Similarly, the Mondev tribunal reasoned that “[t]he mere fact that earlier conduct has
gone unremedied or unredressed when a treaty enters into force does not justify a
tribunal applying the treaty retrospectively to that conduct,” a reasoning that should be
applied by analogy here.**

In response to the Claimant's contention that none of its investments became
substantially worthless until after the issuance of the 2011 Administrative Chamber
Decision, the Respondent argues that the BIT does not require evidence of the extent
of the damage or loss, nor that the investment has been rendered substantially
worthless, only that damage or loss was incurred.*®° As such, expert analysis of the
degree of impairment of the investment at different points in time is irrelevant for the
determination of whether the claim is time-barred.4°°

Respondent adds that, in any event, it is clear from the Claimant’s January 2011
press release that it believed that the value of its investment had been significantly
impacted by the 2010 TCA Decision, if not entirely lost, as of that time. Relying on

Rusoro, the Respondent argues that such knowledge is sufficient to trigger the statute
of limitations. In that case, the tribunal found that Rusoro’s claim was barred under
the relevant statute of limitations because the claimant had admitted knowledge of its
loss more than three years before bringing the arbitration. In circumstances similar to
those here, the tribunal concluded that “what is required is simply knowledge that loss
or damage has been caused, even if the extent and quantification are still unclear."45”

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its claims are time-barred under Article XII(3)(c). The
Respondent’s objections, namely that the measures the Claimant is “really”
challenging are: (i) the 2010 TCA Decision; and (ii) the 2010 Executive Moratorium,
both of which occurred outside the three-year limitation period provided under Article
XII(3)(c), are incorrect and should be rejected. The claims must be assessed as
pleaded by the Claimant, and “[w]hen Article XII(3)(c) is applied to the measures that
Infinito_alleges breached the BIT, because they resulted in the actual loss of
Industrias Infinito’s rights associated with the Crucitas project, it is clear that the
arbitration commenced within the applicable limitation period.”"*°*

The Claimant emphasizes that Article XII(3)(c) bars claims only if three years have
elapsed from the time at which the Claimant first acquired or should have first
acquired knowledge of: (a) the alleged breach; and (b) the alleged loss or damage
sustained. The Claimant acknowledges that “[i]f actual knowledge cannot be
established, constructive knowledge may be imputed to the claimant if a reasonably
prudent claimant would have known of the alleged breach and resulting loss.”4°°

With respect to (a), as discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) supra, the focus must be on
the measure that the Claimant “alleges” is in breach of the BIT. This interpretation is
consistent with the ordinary meaning of the terms used in the provision, as required
by Article 31 of the VCLT. As discussed in that same section, the word “alleged” is
not a meaningless qualifier; it denotes that the violations to be addressed are the
“presumed or supposed violations of [the BIT] invoked by the Claimant.” Thus,
“[t]he only relevant question is whether the breach, as alleged by the claimant, is
time-barred;” “[e]ven if a claimant references events that are outside the tribunal's
temporal jurisdiction, the claim will not be time-barred if the alleged breach itself is

timely.”“*' A respondent cannot reformulate a claim to suggest that it falls outside of
the limitation period.“

As noted at paragraph 157 supra, the Claimant alleges that four specific measures
breached the BIT, specifically, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision, the 2013
Constitutional Chamber Decision, the 2012 MINAE Resolution, and the 2011
Legislative Moratorium.

According to the Claimant, “[iJt was not possible for Infinito to have acquired actual or
constructive knowledge of the alleged breaches and resulting loss more than three
years before initiating its claim on February 6, 2014,” because “[nJone of the
measures that Infinito alleges to have breached the BIT had been rendered by that
time.”4°

As discussed in Section IV.C.3.a(ii) supra, the Claimant emphasizes that the 2010
TCA Decision “is not the measure that Infinito is challenging because it did not result
in the final or irreversible annulment of Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession or
other project approvals.” According to the Claimant, the annulment of Industrias
Infinito’s exploitation concession and other rights only became final and could only be
acted upon when the Administrative Chamber refused to reverse the 2010 TCA
Decision on 30 November 2011. Until that time, the annulment of Industrias Infinito’s
rights was suspended and could still be overturned.. The 2010 TCA Decision could
not terminate the process in a definitive manner, nor could it be acted upon by
administrative agencies. The Administrative Chamber could also have rendered a
decision on the merits without sending it back to the TCA for reconsideration.“®° This
was acknowledged by the 2012 MINAE Resolution cancelling the 2008 Concession,
which stated that the 2010 TCA Decision had been confirmed by the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision and had thus become firm.“

Contrary to the Respondent's contentions, Infinito did not understand that the 2008
Concession had been irrevocably annulled as a result of the 2010 TCA Decision;
quite the opposite, it had every expectation that its Concession and other project
approvals would remain intact because the 2010 TCA Decision would be overturned
on appeal.“®” This is confirmed by Infinito’s many public statements reflecting its
continued and reasonable belief that it would be able to proceed with the Las Crucitas
Project, as well as its continued investment in the project and the fact that it continued

to employ 243 employees.“ This is also confirmed by the actions of Costa Rica’s
own Attorney General and environmental authorities, who “[b]y appealing the [2010
TCA Decision] [...] recognized that the annulment of the concession and other project
approvals was not final.”4?

In any event, relying on FTI’s expert report, the Claimant contends that Infinito’s
investments did not become substantially worthless until after the 2011 Administrative
Chamber Decision was rendered. According to the Claimant, “Infinito’s financial
statements, market capitalization, management statements and public disclosure, and
continuing investment in the Crucitas project after the [2010 TCA Decision] all
consistently indicate that it was the Administrative Chamber's decision, not the [2010
TCA Decision], that rendered Infinito’s investments substantially worthless. This is
confirmed by the actions of the [GJovernment of Costa Rica in appealing the decision,
and contemporaneous statements in Costa Rican media.”“”° It was thus on the date
of the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision (30 November 2011) that Infinito first
knew that the measures it alleges to have breached the BIT had caused it loss or
damage.

Likewise, the Claimant's claim regarding the open-pit mining moratorium is not time-
barred. First, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium did not become applicable to Infinito
until the Administrative Chamber finally annulled the 2008 Concession on 30
November 2011. Prior to that final annulment, the Concession remained valid, and
Infinito was unaffected by the moratorium.‘”' According to the Claimant, ‘i]t is
irrelevant when the moratorium was implemented, since Infinito is not alleging that the
existence of the moratorium independent of its impact on Infinito breached the BIT.”4”
For the Claimant, “[t}he breach occurred only after the moratorium became capable of
affecting Infinito’s rights, which could not have happened before the Administrative
Chamber finally annulled Industrias Infinito’s exploitation concession on November
30, 2011,” “[o}nly then could Infinito have known of the moratorium’s impact.”4”°

Second, contrary to what Costa Rica suggests, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium does
not merely “duplicate” the 2010 Executive Moratorium. According to the Claimant, the
2011 Legislative Moratorium “subsumed” earlier moratoriums.*”% In any event, Infinito
does not challenge the existence of the 2011 Legislative Moratorium in and of itself,

but rather the application of that moratorium to the Las Crucitas Project. The
moratorium was irrelevant until the Administrative Chamber finally annulled Industrias
Infinito’s 2008 Concession and other permits on 30 November 2011. As a result, “the
fact that earlier moratoriums existed is irrelevant to the question of when Infinito first
learned that a breach had occurred and that it had suffered losses relating to that
breach.”4”5 In fact, in a May 2010 press release Infinito specifically noted that the
2010 Executive Moratorium did not apply to the Las Crucitas Project because at that
time Infinito still held valid rights in the Las Crucitas area, including the 2008
Concession. _Infinito had thus no reason to challenge the application of the
moratorium before November 201 1.476

Further, the Claimant highlights that it is also challenging the 2012 MINAE Resolution,
which it argues extinguished Infinito’s remaining rights over the Las Crucitas Project;
and the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, which declined on preliminary
admissibility grounds to hear Infinito’s unconstitutionality claim against the 2010 TCA
Decision. The Claimant specifies that both of these measures were rendered within
the three-year limitation period.4””

The Claimant further rejects the Respondent's legal arguments regarding the
application of the BIT’s statute of limitations. First, there is no merit to Costa Rica’s
argument that events outside the three-year limitation period cannot be relied upon in
establishing a breach of the BIT. Citing Tecmed, the Claimant submits that “[a]
tribunal can rely on preceding events, in its analysis, if those events culminated in a
breach that was itself timely.”"*”° Prior events must not be confused with the measure
challenged: “while ‘a dispute may presuppose the existence of some prior situation or
fact [...] it does not follow that the dispute arises in regard to the situation or fact.’””4”9
Circumstances that pre-date the alleged breach are not barred from the Tribunal’s
consideration; they “can provide the necessary background or context for determining
whether breaches occurred during the time-eligible period.”*° Tribunals may also
rely on events pre-dating a treaty’s entry into force, or pre-dating the moment at which
an investor actually acquired an investment, provided that the alleged breach
occurred after the treaty entered into force or the investor acquired its investment.‘

What matters is that the alleged breach itself is timely. Referring to Tecmed, the
Claimant argues that “[t]he limitation period would not run until ‘the point of
consummation of the conduct encompassing and giving an overarching sense to such
acts.”®? Relying on Renée Rose Levy, the Claimant submits that “the critical date is
the one on which the State adopts the disputed measure, even when the measure
represents the culmination of a process or sequence of events which may have
started years earlier. It is not uncommon that divergences or disagreements develop
over a period of time before they finally ‘crystallize’ in an actual measure affecting the
investor's treaty rights.”4°

Second, there is no merit to Costa Rica’s argument that in cases involving measures
that render earlier measures final, it is the first measure that crystallizes the breach.
According to the Claimant, “[a]n alleged breach that renders an earlier measure final
is still a distinct breach,” and “[t]he breach is crystallized with the measure that
renders its effects final.”“8* Invoking Apotex, the Claimant argues that “[jJudicial
proceedings [...] may form the basis of a timely claim even if they affirm the result of
an earlier, time-barred measure.” It adds, relying on Mondey, that limitation periods
will begin to run only after the issuance of a court decision that finally disposes of the
claimant's rights.“8° As confirmed in Corona, only the final, crystallizing breach may
be challenged, and it is that breach that must fall within the limitation period.‘°”

Contrary to the Respondent's assertions, an appellate decision that affirms and
renders the judgment of a lower court final can be considered a distinct measure
giving rise to a standalone breach.*®° The cases on which the Respondent seeks to
rely are either distinguishable (Sistem) or do not support its case (Apotex, Feldman,
Grand River). \Indeed, in most of these cases, the measure crystallizing the breach
pre-dated the tolling of the statute of limitations, and the claimant manufactured a
subsequent challenge to the measure despite the fact that no further procedural rights
existed under domestic law:*®

a.

In Sistem, the question whether an appellate decision amounted to a distinct
breach of the treaty did not arise, which makes this case irrelevant to decide that
issue.*°

In Apotex, although the tribunal declined jurisdiction over a time-barred measure
because the claimant had instituted further litigation to challenge it, it assumed
jurisdiction over claims arising from the final appellate court decisions
themselves.**' Applying the tribunal's reasoning, a direct claim against the 2010
TCA Decision would be time-barred, but a claim based on the 2011
Administrative Chamber Decision would not.‘9?

Feldman and Grand River are inapposite because they stand for the proposition
that a limitation period cannot be suspended or prolonged, but here “Infinito does
not require any suspension or prolongation because the breaches alleged by it
occurred within the three-year limitation period.”“%°

Contrary to the Respondent's contention, Mondev does not suggest that
appellate decisions represent a failure to remedy previous breaches rather than
new breaches. It rather stands for the proposition that, to be successfully
challenged, court decisions must independently give rise to actionable breaches,
which the Claimant does not dispute. In fact, the Mondev tribunal did assume
jurisdiction over challenges to judicial measures.***

Here, all of the measures challenged by Infinito constitute new and distinct breaches.
All of them are positive acts by the Costa Rican Government that are distinct from the
2010 TCA Decision and do not fall outside the limitation period:*°°

a.

The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision upheld the 2010 TCA Decision by
applying the 2002 Moratorium to the 2008 Concession and other project
approvals, even though it had the power to reverse it, thus rendering final and
irreversible the annulment of the Concession and other approvals.

The 2012 MINAE Resolution went even further, extinguishing all of Infinito’s
mining rights, not only those annulled by the Administrative Chamber.

Through the 2013 Constitutional Chamber Decision, a different chamber of the
Supreme Court refused on procedural grounds to address the 2010 TCA
Decision.

d. Finally, the 2011 Legislative Moratorium prevented Infinito from applying for a
new concession and other approvals.

Third, the Claimant denies that the limitation period starts from the date on which
Infinito’s rights were impaired, even if that impairment was not certain, as the
Respondent suggests.*® This interpretation is contrary to the plain meaning of Article
XII(3)(c), according to which the limitation period cannot start before the investor has
knowledge of the alleged breach. This means that a breach must already have
occurred, and any so-called “impairment” before that date is irrelevant. Relying on
Renée Rose Levy, the Claimant submits that “[e]vents that may give rise to later,
permanent breaches or which foreshadow potential future breaches are not breaches
at all under the BIT.”“°”

Costa Rica’s argument is also contrary to the context of Article XII(3)(c), because
certain provisions of the BIT (such as expropriation) can only be triggered by
irreversible State action.“ In addition, as explained in Section IV.C.4.a(ii) supra,
when the measure is a judicial measure, Article XII(3)(d) of the BIT precludes the
investor from bringing a claim against a decision that is not final. As explained by
counsel for the Claimant during the Hearing on Jurisdiction:

And the provision in XII(3)(d), which prevents a measure with respect to
which there has been a subsequent Judgment, prevents us from bringing
any claim with respect to the TCA decision. So, we're operating very
much consistently in our submission with the provisions of the Bilateral
Investment Treaty in respecting the particular provisions that the Parties
have agreed to with respect to when a claim can properly be brought in
this case.‘°°

(iii) Discussion

Pursuant to Article XII(3)(c) of the BIT, an investor may submit a dispute to arbitration
only if “(c) not more than three years have elapsed from the date on which the
investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged breach
and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.” The Respondent
argues that Infinito’s claims concern measures that are time-barred pursuant to this
provision, and the Claimant denies this.

After careful consideration of the Parties’ arguments, the Tribunal defers the
consideration of this objection to the merits. In the Tribunal’s view, the analysis of this
objection requires the analysis of factual and legal issues that are intertwined with the
merits.

As noted by the Respondent, to decide this objection the Tribunal must answer three
questions: (i) first, it must identify the cut-off date for the three-year limitation period;
(ii) second, it must determine whether the Claimant knew or should have known of the
alleged breach or breaches before that cut-off date; and (iii) third, it must determine
whether the Claimant knew or should have known that it had incurred loss or damage
before that date.

With respect to the first question, the Parties agree that the cut-off date for the three-
year limitation period is 6 February 2011.

With respect to the second question, the Tribunal has already determined that it must
consider the Claimant's claim as pleaded. This means that it must assess whether
the Claimant knew or should have known of the breaches as alleged by the Claimant
before the cut-off date. The Claimant argues that all of the measures that it is
challenging in this arbitration occurred after the cut-off date. However, the
Respondent correctly points out that Article XII(3)(c) requires identifying the date on
which the Claimant first acquired knowledge of the alleged breach, which in the
Respondent’s view requires identifying the date on which the Claimant first acquired
knowledge that its rights had been impaired. In the Respondent's view, the Claimant
first acquired knowledge of the impairment of its rights in the Concession with the
2010 TCA Decision. Without accepting this argument at this stage, the Tribunal
considers that, to determine when the Claimant first acquired (or should have first
acquired) knowledge of a specific breach, it must begin by identifying the date on
which the alleged breach crystallized. This requires a substantive review of each of
the measures complained of as well as of the measures that the Respondent
considers lie at the heart of the Claimant’s case (in particular, of the 2010 TCA
Decision). This analysis is deeply intertwined with the merits, and the Tribunal will
thus conduct it during the merits phase.

The same applies to the third question. For the Tribunal to determine when the
Claimant first acquired (or should have first acquired) knowledge that it had suffered
loss or damage, the Tribunal must first identify the loss or damage alleged and the
breach from which that loss or damage flows. Here, the Respondent argues that the
real cause of the loss or damage alleged by the Claimant are the 2010 TCA Decision
and the 2010 Executive Moratorium, not the four measures identified by the Claimant.
Accordingly, the Tribunal will need to assess the evidentiary record to determine the
loss or damage alleged, its cause, and when the Claimant first acquired knowledge of
that loss or damage. In the Tribunal’s view, this inquiry will be undertaken more
efficiently together with the merits, when the Tribunal will have a full view of the
evidentiary record.

For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal defers this issue to the merits phase.

Cc.

Are These Jurisdictional Requirements or Conditions for Admissibility?

(i) | The Claimant's Position

The Respondent has framed its objections under Article XII of the BIT as objections to
jurisdiction. The Claimant objects that, while Article XII(2) and (5) of the BIT contains
Costa Rica’s consent to jurisdiction, Article XII(3) (on which several of the
Respondent's objections are premised) sets out the conditions for the admissibility of
the claims.*° Specifically, the Claimant submits that:

a.

In Article XII(5) of the BIT, Costa Rica consents unconditionally to submit
disputes under the BIT to international arbitration in accordance with the
provisions of Article XII.5°"

The Tribunal’s jurisdiction (i.e., “the power of the tribunal to hear the case”) is
defined by Article XII(2) of the BIT. Here, the jurisdictional requirements set out
in Article XII(2) are satisfied because “Infinito (i) is an investor as defined in
Article | of the BIT, (ii) claims damages resulting from measures that arose after
the BIT came into force, [and] (iii) claims damages arising out of a breach of the
BIT for an investment in Costa Rica’s territory.”°°2

By contrast, Article XII(3) sets out admissibility, not jurisdictional, requirements.
For the Claimant, admissibility requirements relate to the “particulars of the
claim,” as opposed to the power of the tribunal to hear the case.°° Here, “Article
XII(3) sets out admissibility requirement[s] because it provides the conditions that
an investor must satisfy in order to submit a claim to arbitration."° This is made
clear by the opening language of Article XII(3) (“[aJn investor may submit a
dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance with paragraph
(4) only if [...]”), and is supported by the fact that on its plain language Article
XII(2) is not qualified by or subject to the satisfaction of Article XII(3).5°°

As a result, the Claimant argues that Costa Rica may not rely on Article XII(3), or any
other provision of Article XII, to vary its consent to arbitration.°°° According to the
Claimant, the tribunal in Churchill rejected a similar attempt by Indonesia to import a
legality requirement into the conditions for consent.%°”

The Claimant submits that the distinction between jurisdiction and admissibility is
relevant because tribunals have consistently found that MFN clauses can be used to
import more favourable admissibility requirements from other bilateral investment
treaties.5°° Here, because the preconditions to arbitration set out in Article XII(3) are
admissibility conditions, they can be overridden by application of the MFN provision in
Article 1V.5°%

(ii) | The Respondent's Position

The Respondent categorically rejects this interpretation. According to Costa Rica, the
requirements of Article XII(3) constitute mandatory limits to Costa Rica’s consent to
arbitration.5"° The three-year limitation period and the bar on claims concerning
measures already adjudicated by a Costa Rican court “are not simply hurdles that
Claimant must overcome to commence arbitration, such as compulsory prior litigation
in municipal courts;” “[rlather, the requirements of Article XII(3) are strict conditions,
non-compliance with which renders Claimant's claim non-arbitrable.”*"' There is no
basis to assume that these conditions can be relaxed or disregarded, or that any
deficiency in that regard can be cured.

For the Respondent, the words “only if’ used in Article XII(3) “leave no doubt as to the
jurisdictional nature of the provision.”*'? In addition, Costa Rica’s “unconditional
consent” to arbitration in Article XII(5) expressly states that it is given “in accordance
with the provisions of [Article XIl].”. Accordingly, it must be understood that this
unconditional consent is contingent upon the requirements of Article XII(3) being
met.5"° Citing the ICJ in the Armed Activities on the Territory of the Congo case, the
Respondent submits that when consent to jurisdiction is expressed in a
compromissory clause, any conditions to which such consent is subject will constitute

limits to jurisdiction, and not conditions for admissibility.°"* Citing the ICJ and the
decision in ICS Inspection and Control, the Respondent argues that consent to
jurisdiction must be indisputable and may not be presumed, and that the burden of
proof falls on the Claimant."

In any event, the Respondent denies that MFN clauses can be used to import more
favorable admissibility requirements from other bilateral investment treaties, as the
Claimant contends.*"® Relying on Plama “an MFN provision in a basic treaty does not
incorporate by reference dispute settlement provisions in whole or in part set forth in
another treaty, unless the MFN provision in the basic treaty leaves no doubt that the
Contracting Parties intended to incorporate them,” which is not the case here.°"”

(iii) Discussion

The Parties dispute whether the requirements set out in Article XII(3) are jurisdictional
or go to the admissibility of the claims.

The Tribunal notes that the disagreement between the Parties is only relevant if the
Tribunal finds that at least one of the objections based on this provision is sustained.
In the Claimant's view, even if the Tribunal were to conclude that one of the
requirements of Article XII(3) was not met, because those requirements go to the
admissibility of the claim and not the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, they could be bypassed
by the MFN clause found at Article IV of the BIT.

The Respondent has raised two objections grounded on this provision: one based on
Article XII(3)(c) and another on Article XII(3)(d). The Tribunal has found that the
requirement set out in Article XII(3)(d) is met, so whether this requirement is one of
jurisdiction or admissibility is of no consequence. As to the Respondent's objection
that the claims are time-barred under Article XII(3)(c), the Tribunal has deferred the
consideration of this matter to the merits. As a result, the Tribunal will address the
question of whether it is a jurisdictional or admissibility requirement during the merits
phase if it becomes relevant, i.e., if the Tribunal considers that the requirement has
not been met and Costa Rica’s objection is sustained.

Other Objections

a. Do the Claims Fall under the Exclusion Contained in Annex I, Section III(1)
of the BIT?

Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT provides as follows:

Ill. General Exceptions and Exemptions:

1. Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to prevent a Contracting
Party from adopting, maintaining or enforcing any measure otherwise
consistent with this Agreement that it considers appropriate to ensure that
investment activity in its territory is undertaken in a manner sensitive to
environmental concerns.

(i) | The Respondent's Position

According to the Respondent, “the judicial, executive and administrative acts
challenged in this arbitration are limited to maintenance and enforcement of pre-
existing environmental measures, and are therefore barred by Annex |, Section III(1)
of the BIT, taken together with the other jurisdictional limitations of the BIT.”5"®

The Respondent appears to acknowledge that, as this provision requires measures to
be “otherwise consistent” with the BIT, it could be argued that this is a matter for the
merits. However, the Respondent also contends that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction
to consider whether measures that pre-date 6 February 2011 (i.e., the cut-off date for
purposes of the statute of limitations) are consistent with the BIT. “Thus, provided
that such measures are motivated by environmental concerns, the language of Article
Ill Annex | prohibits challenges to any State acts that adopt, maintain or enforce such
a preexisting environmental measure.”5'9

As explained in previous sections, the Respondent submits that the rea/ measures
being challenged pre-date the cut-off date, while the measures formally challenged by
the Claimant merely adopt, maintain or enforce these pre-existing measures. As all of
these measures (pre-existing or not) were motivated by environmental concerns, the
Respondent submits that they are barred by Annex I, Section IlII(1) of the BIT.5°

Specifically, relying on Dr. Ubico’s expert report, the Respondent argues that each of
the acts challenged in this arbitration merely maintain and/or enforce pre-existing
environmental measures:°*

a. The 2010 TCA Decision that annulled the 2008 Concession enforced the 2002
Moratorium as well as the 2004 Constitutional Chamber Decision, both of which
were dictated by environmental concerns. In addition, the 2010 TCA Decision

itself is motivated by environmental concerns, and is therefore also an
environmental measure.

b. The 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision and the 2013 Constitutional
Chamber Decision simply maintained the 2010 TCA Decision, essentially
preserving the status quo ante.

c. The 2012 MINAE Resolution enforced the 2010 TCA Decision, without going
beyond it.

d. The 2011 Legislative Moratorium maintained and enforced the 2010 Executive
Moratorium, which was already in force under the pre-existing Arias and
Chinchilla Moratorium Decrees. According to the Respondent, the 2011
Legislative Moratorium did not go beyond the scope of these decrees.

(ii) | The Claimant's Position

The Claimant denies that its claims are barred by Annex |, Section III(1) of the BIT.
This provision is not a defense to the Respondent's breaches of the BIT; it only
applies to environmental measures that are otherwise consistent with the BIT, and it
does not alter or override substantive treaty obligations. This means that the
Respondent cannot invoke this provision as a defense in respect of measures that do
breach the BIT. As a result, the Claimant submits that “the provision is irrelevant to
the Tribunal’s determination of the merits of Infinito’s claims.”°

This interpretation, so says the Claimant, is consistent with the plain meaning of the
terms “otherwise consistent with this Agreement,” and has been confirmed by
commentators and tribunals alike.*? This does not mean that the provision is
ineffective or devoid of meaning, as it confirms the State’s right to sanction breaches
of its environmental laws in a manner that is not otherwise inconsistent with the
BIT.5*4 By contrast, the Respondent's interpretation would render the terms

“otherwise consistent with this Agreement” meaningless. The Claimant also notes
that these terms are not present in other exceptions in Annex |, Section III.5%

The Claimant further submits that the Respondent's attempt to link Annex |, Section
lI(1) of the BIT to the limitation period under Article XII(3)(c) is unfounded. The
“otherwise consistent with this Agreement” language not only applies to new
measures that are “adopted,” but also to measures that “maintain” or “enforce” an
earlier measure. In any event, the limitation period is irrelevant because it only bars
claims that relate to breaches or losses that became known more than three years
before the claim was initiated; it does not bar claims for breaches or losses that
became known within that period, even if those breaches are based on a measure
that “adopts” or “maintains” an earlier measure.°”°

In any event, the Claimant denies that the annulment of its Concession and other
project approvals were motivated by bona fide environmental concerns. The
evidence shows that the Claimant’s rights were annulled for technical and
administrative reasons.*°”

In this respect, relying on Metalclad, the Claimant submits that the environmental
measures exception contained in Article 1114 of the NAFTA (on which Annex |,
Section Ill(1) of the BIT is based) does not apply where the competent authorities of
the host State have previously found the project to be environmentally sound,°” as is
the case here. Indeed, the Claimant emphasizes that the Las Crucitas Project was
determined to be environmentally sound by the appropriate Costa Rican authorities:

a. The SETENA, Costa Rica’s national body charged with environmental approvals,
approved the Environmental Impact Assessments for the Las Crucitas Project
and declared the project environmentally viable.5°9

b. The SINAC, the national system of conservation areas, approved Industrias
Infinito’s land use change permit allowing it to fell trees.

c. The SINAC, SETENA and the Attorney-General of Costa Rica defended the Las
Crucitas Project's approvals before the Constitutional Chamber, arguing that they
were environmentally viable and in conformity with Costa Rica’s constitutional
right to a healthy and ecologically-balanced environment.**'

d. The Constitutional Chamber (which is the court with jurisdiction over
environmental protection) rendered a detailed decision “exhaustively analyzing
the Crucitas project’s environmental effects and conclusively determining that the
project posed no threat to the environment.”592

Moreover, according to the Claimant, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was
not based on environmental concerns, but rather on the technical application of the
2002 Moratorium at a time when that moratorium had been repealed. Specifically:5%

a. The 2002 Moratorium could not represent a real environmental concern
considering that the Government repealed it. In fact, as the Administrative
Chamber recognized, had the Concession been issued two weeks later there
would have been no problem with its validity.

b. Further, the 2002 Moratorium did not apply to projects with acquired rights.
Indeed, under the same administration that enacted the 2002 Moratorium, the
SETENA approved the EIA for the project.

c. In addition, the 2011 Administrative Chamber Decision was not based on an
analysis of environmental soundness. Rather, it relied on a technical analysis of
the principle of conversion used to restore the project's Concession. This is
confirmed by the fact that the SETENA, the SINAC and the Attorney-General all
appealed the 2010 TCA Decision, underlining the project's environmental
viability.

(iii) Discussion

Before undergoing an analysis of this objection, the Tribunal must determine if this is
the right moment to address it.

While the Respondent seems to acknowledge that issues arising from Annex |,
Section III(1) of the BIT could be merits issues,* it maintains that the matter is one of
jurisdiction or possibly admissibility, or at the very least a threshold inquiry. As the
Respondent explained during the Hearing on Jurisdiction:

So, you can call it jurisdictional, you can call it admissibility or anything
else, but it's a threshold inquiry that disposes of the claim because if
nothing in the BIT can be construed to prevent Costa Rica from doing it,
then there is nothing to talk about.*>

By contrast, the Claimant’s position appears to be that the issues raised by Annex |,
Section Ill(1) of the BIT are for the merits. Indeed, its primary position is that this
provision is irrelevant.5%° However, relying on the Tamimi case, it appears to
acknowledge that if the issue is brought up at all, it should be dealt with at the merits
stage.°*”

The Tribunal considers that any objection by the Respondent based on Annex |,
Section Ill(1) of the BIT is a matter for the merits. As is obvious from its plain
language quoted above, this provision sets out guidelines regarding the content of
measures that may be adopted, maintained or enforced by the host State. It does not
relate to the State’s consent to arbitrate, nor to whether a claim can be heard or not; it
relates to whether a particular measure has or has not breached the BIT.
Accordingly, it cannot be deemed a matter of jurisdiction or admissibility; it must
properly be regarded as a matter for the merits.

The Tribunal thus defers this question to the merits stage.
Can Infinito Invoke the BIT’s MFN Clause?

As discussed above, the Claimant argues that all of the preconditions set out in
Article XII(3) of the BIT have been met.°%* In the alternative, it submits that these
preconditions are not applicable by operation of the MFN clause in Article IV of the
BIT, and that as a result Infinito is entitled to benefit from the more favorable absence
of preconditions in Costa Rica’s bilateral investment treaties with Taiwan and
Korea.**° The Respondent denies that the Claimant can rely on the MFN clause of
the BIT to circumvent the BIT’s jurisdictional limitations or expand the scope of Costa
Rica’s consent to arbitration.54°

The Tribunal has already found that the preconditions set out in Article XII(3)(a), (b)
and (d) are met. It can thus dispense with reviewing the Claimant's alternative
argument in respect of these preconditions.

As to the precondition set out in Article XII(3)(c) (i.e., whether the claims are time-
barred), the Tribunal has deferred this issue to the merits. It will thus address the
Claimant’s MFN argument and the Respondent's related objections at the merits
stage, if necessary.

DECISION

For the reasons set forth above, the Arbitral Tribunal:

a.

Joins to the merits phase the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections under
Article XII(3)(c); under Annex |, Section III(1); and under Article IV of the BIT; as
well as the determination of whether the Claimant’s investment complies with
Article I(g) of the BIT.

Denies the Respondent's other preliminary objections.
Declares that it will take the necessary steps for the continuation of the
proceedings toward the merits phase by way of a procedural order to be issued

after consultation with the Parties.

Reserves the decision on costs for subsequent decision.
