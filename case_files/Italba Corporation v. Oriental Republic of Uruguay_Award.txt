INTRODUCTION AND PARTIES

This case concerns a dispute submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID” or the “Centre’’) on the basis of the Treaty Between the
United States of America and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay Concerning the
Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment, signed on 4 November 2005 and
in force on 1 November 2006 (the “Treaty”), and the Convention on the Settlement of
Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered into force

on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

The Claimant is Italba Corporation (“Italba” or the “Claimant”), a company incorporated

under the laws of the State of Florida, United States of America.
The Respondent is the Oriental Republic of Uruguay (“Uruguay” or the “Respondent”).

The Claimant and the Respondent are collectively referred to as the “Parties.” The Parties’

representatives and their addresses are listed above on page (i).

This dispute relates to Uruguay’s revocation of the Claimant’s license to provide wireless
data services in Uruguay, through the Uruguayan company Trigosul S.A. (“Trigosul’”),

and which allegedly breached provisions of the Treaty.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY
Registration of the Request for Arbitration and Constitution of the Tribunal

On 16 February 2016, ICSID received a Request for Arbitration of that same date from
Italba against Uruguay (the “Request”). The Request was supplemented by the Claimant’s
letters dated 10 and 20 March 2016.

On 24 March 2016, the Secretary-General of ICSID registered the Request in accordance
with Article 36(3) of the ICSID Convention and notified the Parties of the registration. In

the Notice of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute

an arbitral tribunal as soon as possible, in accordance with Rule 7(d) of the ICSID Rules

of Procedure for the Institution of Conciliation and Arbitration Proceedings.

In accordance with Article 37(2)(a) of the ICSID Convention, and pursuant to the
provisions of the Treaty, the Tribunal was to be constituted by three arbitrators to be
appointed as follows: one by each Party and the third, the presiding arbitrator, by agreement
of the Parties.

The Tribunal was composed of Mr. Rodrigo Oreamuno, a national of Costa Rica, President,
appointed by agreement of the Parties; Mr. John Beechey, a national of the United
Kingdom, appointed by the Claimant; and Professor Zachary Douglas, a national of
Australia, appointed by the Respondent.

On 27 May 2016, the Secretary-General, in accordance with Rule 6(1) of the ICSID Rules
of Procedure for Arbitration Proceedings (the “ICSID Arbitration Rules”), notified the
Parties that the three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal was
deemed constituted on that date. Ms. Marisa Planells-Valero, ICSID Legal Counsel, was

designated to serve as Secretary of the Tribunal.
The First Session

In accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 13(1), the Tribunal held a first session with the
Parties on 26 July 2016, by teleconference.

Following the first session, on 29 July 2016, the President of the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 1, recording the agreement of the Parties on procedural matters and the decision
of the Tribunal on disputed issues. Procedural Order No. | provided, inter alia, that the
applicable Arbitration Rules would be those in effect from 10 April 2006; that the
procedural languages would be English and Spanish; and that the place of the proceeding
would be Washington, DC. Procedural Order No. 1 also set out a schedule for the
proceeding. Ms. Maria Jose Rojas was appointed as assistant to the President of the

Tribunal.

On 28 July 2016, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that the Secretary of the
Tribunal would be taking temporary leave, and that Ms. Luisa Fernanda Torres would serve

as Secretary of the Tribunal during her absence.
The Parties Written Submissions and Procedural Applications

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, on 16 September 2016, the Claimant filed a
Memorial on the Merits, together with witness statements by Dr. Gustavo Alberelli! and
Mr. Luis Herbon;? an expert report by Mr. Santiago Dellepiane Avellaneda of Compass

Lexecon; Exhibits C-001 to C-136 and Legal Authorities CL-001 to CL-085.

On 14 October 2016, the Respondent advised that it did not intend to request the bifurcation
of the proceeding, and that it would file its objections to jurisdiction with its Counter-

Memorial.

On 31 October 2016, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that, one of its witnesses, Mr.
Herbon, had received a notice to appear before a criminal court in Montevideo, Uruguay,
in connection with an investigation associated with his and Dr. Alberelli’s testimony in this

arbitration (the “Investigation”).

On 8 November 2016, the Respondent replied to the Claimant’s communication of 31

October 2016.

On 10 November 2016, the Claimant filed an Application for Provisional Measures and
Temporary Relief pursuant to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39(1) of the
ICSID Arbitration Rules. The Claimant’s Application sought, inter alia, to enjoin the
criminal prosecution in Uruguay of Dr. Alberelli and Mr. Herbon pending the resolution
of this arbitration. In addition, the Claimant requested temporary relief to preserve the
status quo while the Claimant’s Application was pending, noting that Mr. Herbon was
scheduled to appear for a hearing before the Uruguayan Criminal Court on 1 December

2016.

On 14 November 2016, the Tribunal invited the Respondent to provide its observations on

the Claimant’s Application by 17 November 2016.

On that same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2, amending certain
requirements of Procedural Order No. | relating to the submission of hard copies of

pleadings and accompanying documents.

On 15 November 2016, the Respondent applied to the Tribunal for an extension of time

until 21 November 2016 to provide its observations on the Claimant’s Application.
On 16 November 2016, the Tribunal granted the extension requested by the Respondent.

On that same day, the Claimant wrote to the Tribunal advising that, while it did not oppose
the extension granted to the Respondent, it relied on that extension in order to renew its

request for temporary relief.

On 17 November 2016, the Respondent replied to the Claimant’s communication of 16
November 2016. It requested the Tribunal to decline the Claimant’s request for temporary
relief, arguing that there was no urgency, as the next event in the Investigation was not

scheduled until 1 December 2016.

On 21 November 2016, the Respondent submitted its Response to the Claimant’s
Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief in which, inter alia, it stated
that Uruguay was prepared to guarantee that the Investigation would not prevent either Dr.
Alberelli or Mr. Herbon from participating in the preparation or presentation of the

remainder of the Claimant’s case (the “Guarantee’).

On 24 November 2016, the Claimant submitted its Reply in Further Support of Its

Application for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief.

On 25 November 2016, the President of the Tribunal invited the Respondent to confirm

the Guarantee. On 28 November 2016, the Respondent confirmed the Guarantee.

On 30 November 2016, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties inviting the Claimant to confirm
whether the Guarantee was sufficient to protect its ability to present witness evidence from

Mr. Herbon and Dr. Alberelli in these proceedings.

On 5 December 2016, the Claimant filed observations in response to the Tribunal’s

communication of 30 November 2016.

On 6 December 2016, the Respondent filed a communication addressing certain allegations
in the Claimant’s communication of 5 December 2016. On that same day, the Claimant

sent a further communication in response.

On 9 December 2016, the President of the Tribunal, on behalf of the Tribunal, invited the
Parties to provide an update on whether “Mr. Herbon had, in fact, appeared before the
Uruguayan Criminal Court [on 1 December 2016] and, if so, what were the circumstances

of his appearance.”

On 13 December 2016, the Respondent informed the Tribunal that “Mr. Herbon did not
appear in court on 1 December 2016, as required by his summons”, adding that “[n]o reason
for his failure to appear was given to the Court or the Prosecutor by Mr. Herbén or his
counsel.” Uruguay added, however, that “the guarantee that Uruguay has given — in its
Response to the Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures (filed on 21 November 2016)

and its correspondence with the Tribunal of 28 November 2016 — remains in place.”

Also on 13 December 2016, the Claimant reported that Mr. Herbon’s counsel had been
able to reschedule his court appearance for a date in February 2017, but that “Mr. Herbon
and Dr. Alberelli remain unable to return to Uruguay to gather evidence and conduct
business without the threat of pretrial incarceration.” The Claimant reiterated its request

for provisional measures.

On 5 January 2017, the Tribunal and the Parties were informed that Ms. Marisa Planells-

Valero was reassuming her functions as Secretary of the Tribunal in this proceeding.

On 30 January 2017, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 1 as modified by Procedural

Order No. 2, the Respondent filed a Counter-Memorial on the Merits and Memorial on

Ms. Alicia Fernandez, Mr. Fernando Garcia Piriz, Mr. Fernando Pérez Tabé, Mr. Gabriel
Lombide, Mr. Juan Piaggio, and Mr. Leon Lev; expert reports by Prof. Santiago Pereira
Campos and by Daniel Flores and Ettore Comi of Econ One Research; Exhibits R-008 to
R-080 and Legal Authorities RL-024 to RL-119.

On 9 February 2017, the Claimant filed a further communication informing the Tribunal
that Mr. Herbon’s hearing before the Uruguayan Criminal Court was now scheduled for 15
February 2017 and reiterating its request for provisional measures. On 14 February 2017,
the Respondent filed observations in response to this communication, confirming again the

Guarantee.

On 15 February 2017, the Tribunal issued its Decision denying the Claimant’s Application
for Provisional Measures and Temporary Relief. In doing so, the Tribunal concluded that
the Claimant’s Application was based on the anticipated consequences of the Investigation,
and that the Claimant had failed to file evidence that Dr. Alberelli’s and Mr. Herbon’s
participation in this proceeding had been affected to date by their involvement in the
Investigation. Furthermore, the Tribunal accepted that Uruguay’s commitment to respect
the Claimant’s rights in this arbitration had been made in good faith and would be adhered

to.

On 14 February 2017, the Parties filed their requests for production of documents. On 15
March 2017, each Party filed observations on the other Party’s requests. On 23 March
2017, the Claimant filed a reply to its request for production of documents. On 29 March
2017, the Respondent filed a reply to its request for production of documents. On 4 April
2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3 concerning its decision on the Claimant’s

requests for production of documents.

On 25 April 2017, the Claimant requested an eleven-day extension to the deadline to submit
its Reply Memorial originally due on 1 May 2017 and to shift the deadline for the
Respondent’s Rejoinder from 31 July 2017 to 11 August 2017. On 26 April 2017, the
Tribunal invited the Respondent to comment on the extension. On the same date, the

Respondent agreed to the extension. On 28 April 2017, the Tribunal granted the extension.

On 13 May 2017, the Claimant filed a Reply Memorial, together with witness statements
by Ms. Beatriz Alberelli, Mr. Alejandro Amaro, Mr. Alan Cherp, Mr. Christopher G. Hall,
and Mr. Johnathan Alexander Van Arem; Second Witness Statements of Mr. Alejandro
Amaro, Dr. Gustavo Alberelli and Mr. Luis Herbon; an expert report by Mr. John Hargett,
Mr. Luis Lapique, Mr. Luis Valle, and a second expert Report by Mr. Santiago Dellepiane
Avellaneda of Compass Lexecon; Exhibits C-154 to C-275 and Legal Authorities CL-102
to CL-155.

On 31 May 2017, the United States of America, the non-disputing Party pursuant to the
terms of the Treaty (the “Non-Disputing Party”), notified the Tribunal that it would decide
whether to file a Non-Disputing Party submission once it had received and reviewed the

Respondent’s Rejoinder due on 11 August 2017.

After further submissions from the Parties, on 31 May 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order No. 4 concerning its decision on the Respondent’s requests for production of
documents and setting up a framework for the protection of certain confidential documents

to be produced by the Claimant pursuant to that Order.

On 5 June 2017, the Tribunal proposed a calendar to the Parties for the scenario in which
the Non-Disputing Party decided to file a submission in this proceeding. On 13 June 2017,
the Parties confirmed that they had no objection to the Tribunal’s proposed calendar. On
22 June 2017, the Tribunal invited the Non-Disputing Party to file a submission, if any, by
12 September 2017.

On 5 July 2017, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had agreed on a Hearing of
eight days.

On 6 July 2017, the President of the Tribunal informed the Parties that Ms. Maria Jose

Rojas would no longer be serving as Assistant to the President of the Tribunal in this case.

On 11 August 2017, the Respondent filed a Rejoinder Memorial, together with second
witness statements of Mr. Nicolas Cendoya; Ms. Alicia Fernandez; Mr. Fernando Garcia
Piriz; second expert reports of Prof. Santiago Pereira Campos; Dr. Daniel Flores and Mr.

Ettore Comi of Econ One Research, Inc.; expert reports of Mr. Louis T.M. Conti, Esq.; Mr.

155.

On 22 August 2017, the Tribunal invited the Parties to reach an agreement on certain
organizational and logistical details of the Hearing by 29 August 2017. On 24 August
2017, the Parties requested an extension. On 25 August 2017, the Tribunal granted the
extension requested by the Parties. On 8 September 2017, the Parties submitted a joint

statement on the organization of the Hearing.

On 11 September 2017, the Non-Disputing Party filed a submission (the “Non-Disputing
Party Submission”). On 25 September 2017, the Respondent submitted its observations
on the Non-Disputing Party Submission. On 27 September 2017, the Claimant informed

the Tribunal that it had no comments on the Non-Disputing Party Submission.

On 11 September 2017, the Respondent submitted a list of the Claimant’s witnesses and
experts whom it wished to cross-examine during the Hearing. On 12 September 2017, the
Claimant submitted a list of the Respondent’s witnesses and experts whom it wished to
cross-examine during the Hearing. On 15 September 2017, the Respondent proposed that
it be allowed to produce six (6) of its witnesses for examination by the Claimant via video-
conference or, in the alternative, that the Claimant be required to pay in advance for their
transport, food and lodging. On 27 September 2017, the Claimant objected to the

Respondent’s proposal.

On 12 September 2017, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to submit certain
missing pages from the Claimant’s Exhibit C-116. On 19 September 2017, the Claimant
informed the Tribunal that it had no objection to the Respondent’s request. On 20
September 2017, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to introduce the missing pages

from the Claimant’s Exhibit C-116 into the record.

By that same letter, the Tribunal requested the Parties’ permission to allow Mr. Joao
Valerio, Mr. Beechey’s colleague and administrative secretary, to attend the Hearing. On

20 September 2017, the Respondent confirmed that they had no objection to Mr. Valerio

attending the Hearing. On 21 September 2017, the Claimant confirmed that they had no

objection to Mr. Valerio attending the Hearing.

On 26 September 2017, and pursuant to the Tribunal’s invitation of 20 September 2017,
the Respondent introduced the missing pages from the Claimant’s Exhibit C-116 into the
record as Exhibit R-126.

On 27 September 2017, and pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4, Mr. Valerio submitted a

signed declaration of confidentiality.

On 5 October 2017, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that it no longer intended to call

Uruguay’s technical expert, Dr. Alejandro Paz, for cross-examination during the Hearing.

On that same date, the Tribunal rejected the Respondent’s proposal of 15 September 2017
that it be allowed to produce six (6) of its witnesses for examination by the Claimant during
the Hearing via video-conference or, in the alternative, that the Claimant be required to pay
in advance for their transport, food and lodging. In doing so, the Tribunal invited the
Claimant to carefully consider the need to cross-examine all of the Respondent’s witnesses,
and to confirm the list of witnesses for cross-examination by 11 October 2017. On that
date, the Claimant provided the Tribunal with a revised list of witnesses and experts for

cross-examination during the Hearing.

On 24 October 2017, the Claimant notified the Tribunal that it had terminated its
engagement with Hughes Hubbard & Reed LLP as its counsel in this proceeding and that
it had retained the law firm of Alston & Bird LLP.

On 25 October 2017, the Respondent requested leave from the Tribunal to introduce a new
legal authority into the record. On that same date, the Claimant indicated that it had no
objection to the Respondent’s request. On 27 October 2017, in view of the Parties’
agreement, the Tribunal granted the Respondent leave to introduce this new legal authority

into the record as RL-159.

On 26 October 2017, the Claimant requested a postponement of the Hearing on the basis

of the sudden deterioration of Dr. Alberelli’s health, which would “preclude [him] from

59.

60.

61.

participat[ing] in the hearing at this time, while also making it impossible for Italba to
prepare effectively for the hearing,” and suggested that the Tribunal advise the Parties as
to possible alternative Hearing dates. On 31 October 2017, Uruguay opposed the
Claimant’s request arguing, inter alia, that a postponement of the Hearing at so late a stage
in the proceedings would cause serious prejudice to the Respondent. It informed the
Tribunal that, in view of the circumstances, it was willing to “sacrifice its right to cross-
examine Dr. Alberelli.” On that same date, the Claimant reiterated its request for a
postponement of the Hearing. On 2 November 2017, the Respondent reiterated its
willingness to forego cross-examination of Dr. Alberelli to avoid a postponement of the

Hearing.

On 3 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that the Tribunal did not wish to
question Dr. Alberelli during the Hearing and that, after due consideration, it had decided
to deny the Claimant’s request for a postponement of the Hearing. On that same date, the
Claimant requested the Tribunal to reconsider its decision to deny a postponement of the
Hearing. After due consideration, the Tribunal confirmed its decision to deny the
Claimant’s request. In doing so, the Tribunal reiterated that Italba had failed to provide
reasons to justify its claim that Dr. Alberelli’s health concerns and the absence in the
hearing room of an officer or shareholder of Italba during the Hearing would preclude

counsel for the Claimant from being able to present its case during the Hearing.

On 5 November 2017, the Tribunal proposed, inter alia, the adoption of a Protocol for
Protection of Confidential Information, aimed at ensuring both the maximum transparency
of the Hearing under the transparency regime established by Article 29.2 of the Treaty and
the protection of confidential information pursuant to Procedural Order No. 4. On 7 and 8
November 2017, respectively, the Respondent and the Claimant confirmed their agreement

with the Tribunal’s proposal.

Also on 7 November 2017, the Non-Disputing Party informed the Tribunal of its intention
to attend the Hearing, in accordance with Article 29 of the Treaty. In doing so, the Non-
Disputing Party made a proposal to the Parties in connection with the procedure envisaged

by Procedural Order No. 4 for the protection of confidential information from disclosure

10

62.

63.

64.

65.

66.

during the Hearing. On that same date, the Parties indicated that they had no objection to

the proposal made by the Non-Disputing Party.

On 9 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Non—Disputing Party that the Tribunal
and the Parties welcomed its attendance at the Hearing. Furthermore, the Tribunal
confirmed that, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 4 and the Protocol for Protection
of Confidential Information, the Non-Disputing Party would be invited to leave the hearing
room temporarily whenever confidential information was to be brought to the Tribunal’s
attention at the Hearing. On the same day, the Non-Disputing Party acknowledged receipt

of the Tribunal’s communication and provided a list of its attendees to the Hearing.

On that same date, the Claimant sought leave to introduce into the record eight new factual

exhibits, and three new legal authorities.

On 10 November 2017, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s request, with the
exception of the three documents that post-dated the Claimant’s written pleadings. On

that same date, the Claimant reiterated its request of 9 November 2017.

On 11 November 2017, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would be addressing the
Claimant’s request of 9 November 2017 at the beginning of the Hearing on 13 November

2017 and issuing a decision thereafter.

On 13 November 2017, following a further exchange of views at the beginning of the
Hearing, the Tribunal decided to grant the Claimant’s request of 9 November 2018. On
14 November 2017, the Claimant introduced the eight new exhibits and three new legal
authorities into the record with exhibit numbers C-276 through C-286 and CL-156 through
CL-158.

On 16 November 2017, the Claimant proposed a re-allocation among the Parties of part of
the remaining hearing time reserved for the Tribunal’s questions during the Hearing. On
that same date, the Respondent objected, and the Claimant sent a further communication

to the Tribunal on this matter.

On 17 November 2017, during the cross-examination of Professor Xavier de Mello, the
Claimant objected to the Tribunal’s consideration of his evidence for lack of independence.
By letters of 21 November and 1 December 2017, the Claimant reiterated its objections as
to Prof. de Mello’s independence and requested the Tribunal to disregard his expert report
and testimony in this proceeding. By communications of 30 November and 8 December
2017, the Respondent objected to the Claimant’s request. On 18 December 2017, the

Tribunal notified the Parties that it would decide on the Claimant’s request at an

The Parties filed simultaneous Post-Hearing Briefs on March 16, 2018.

The Parties filed their submissions on costs on May 4, 2018. The Respondent submitted a

letter updating the submission on costs on 7 November 2018.

The proceeding was closed on January 15, 2019.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

Italba was incorporated on 10 May 1982, under the laws of the State of Florida, United
States of America.* It was founded by Dr. Gustavo Alberelli (Italian citizen, permanent
resident of the United States of America since 1 August 1977),> owner of 50 shares and
Ms. Beatriz Alberelli, (who was born in Cuba and who has held American citizenship since

1967),° owner of the remaining 50 shares.”

On 19 December 1994, Mr. Daniel Angel Pérez Blanco and Ms. Marisa Cristina Gonzalez
Silvestri established the company named Mareland Sociedad Anénima in Uruguay. On 29
December 1994, that corporation changed its name and became Trigosul Sociedad
Anonima. On 3 February 1995, the General Tax Authority’s Taxpayers Registry of

Uruguay approved the Bylaws of that corporation, which are registered in the Public and

11508/95.8

77. Article 3 of Trigosul’s Bylaws reads as follows:

“The capital consisting of one or more registered common shares
with a par value of $U1.00 (one Uruguayan peso) each shall be
$U 182,500.00 (one hundred eighty-two thousand five hundred
Uruguayan pesos). The stock certificates shall contain the
formalities established by Article 300 of Law No. 16,060. The
Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting may approve an increase up
to the sum of $U 912,500.00 (nine hundred twelve thousand five
hundred Uruguayan pesos) on one or more occasions, without the
need for an amendment or administrative consent. The Meeting may
delegate the time of the issue and the payment method, terms and
conditions to the Board of Directors or the Administrator, as the
case may be. Share transfers shall be notified to the company and
documented as provided in Law No. 16,060.” 9

78. On 6 September 1996, six share certificates of Trigosul were issued. Each one represented
9,125 shares, with a nominal value of one Uruguayan peso each. Three of the certificates
were issued in the name of Ms. Carmela Caravetta Durante (Dr. Alberelli’s mother), and

the other three in the name of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli Caravetta.'°

79. Dr. Alberelli represented the following with respect to the dates of the certificates and to

the acquisition of Trigosul:

“Certain of Trigosul’s corporate records indicate that the company
was acquired in 1996, not 1999. Trigosul’s Share Certificates (C-
161), at 1-12; Trigosul’s Book of Shareholders and Directors
Meetings (C-164), at 3-4. The reason for this disparity is that the
original owners of Trigosul required, as a condition of the sale of
the company, that the corporate records show that the acquisition
took place in 1996, and I agreed to that condition.”!!

In addition to the six certificates mentioned in paragraph 78 above, on 30 June 1999,
fourteen share certificates of Trigosul were issued; each one representing 9,125 shares,
with a nominal value of one Uruguayan peso each, in the name of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli
Caravetta,'? to complete the aggregate amount of 182,500 Uruguayan pesos that constituted

Trigosul’s “authorized capital”.

On 17 January 1997, through Resolution 75-219 of the Ministry of National Defense
(hereinafter “MDN”, its Spanish acronym), Dr. Alberelli was “granted authorization for
the provision, on a commercial basis, of dedicated wireless digital lines, without connection

to the public telephone system, for the transmission of data between fixed points.”'>

On 4 August 1997, the National Communications Authority, (hereinafter “DNC”, its
Spanish acronym) through Resolution 227-97, allocated Dr. Alberelli, “the terrestrial fixed
service radio channels”, on an “exclusive, national and secondary basis,” of the frequencies
1865 to 1870 MHz. (out) — 1945 to 1950 MHz. (return), 1895 to 1900 MHz. (out) -- 1975
to 1980 MHz. (return).'+

On 9 August 1999, Dr. Alberelli requested the DNC to transfer the authorization granted

in his name to Trigosul.'*

At Dr. Alberelli’s request, on 8 February 2000, the MDN transferred to Trigosul through
Resolution 142/000 the authorization granted to Dr. Alberelli, “...on the same terms and

conditions as those stated.”!°

On 3 October 2000, the MDN issued Decree 282/000, through which the 1700 to 2200
MHz. frequency band save for those frequencies between 1910 and 1930 MHz., was

reserved for the personal communication service called PCS. Through this Decree the DNC

was entrusted with the obligation to study the relevant proceedings for migration to other
frequencies of those authorized to operate in the reserved frequencies. It was also

commissioned to prepare a regulation on the proceeding for the allocation of frequencies.!”

On 4 October 2000, through Resolution 278/2000issued on the basis of Decree 282/000,
the DNC revoked the assignment of the frequencies allocated to Dr. Alberelli “... of the
sub-blocks 1865 - 1870 MHz paired with 1945 - 1950 MHz. and 1895 - 1900 MHz. paired
with 1975 - 1980 MHz.” That Resolution also provided for the return to Dr. Alberelli of
the fees he had paid. '*

Through that same Resolution 278/2000, the DNC allocated “provisionally and revocable
at any time without right to claim and/or compensation of any kind [to Trigosul] the sub-
block ‘K’ corresponding to the sub-frequency band 3425 - 3450 MHz. (out) and 3475 -
3500 MHz. (return), for the installation and operation of the system aimed at commercially
providing in national territory, wireless digital dedicated lines, without connection to the
public telephone network, for the transmission of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint
data.”!? That Resolution established 1 October 2001 as the deadline by which Trigosul was
to start commercial operation of the system, and warned that, in the event that Trigosul
failed to meet the deadline, its authorization would be rescinded. The Resolution also
established the period during which Trigosul should make the corresponding advance
payment for allocation of radio spectrum for the first two years, amounting to 632,674.00

Uruguayan Pesos.”°

With the purpose of enforcing Decree 282/000, the DNC, through Resolution 444/000 of
12 December 2000, allocated “to TRIGOSUL S.A., on a provisional and revocable basis,
without the right to claim or compensation of any type, the sub-blocks “K” and “M”
corresponding to the 3425 - 3450 MHz. and 3525 - 3550 MHz. sub-frequency bands,

intended for the installation and operation of the system aimed at the provision in national

the public telephone network for the transmission of point-to-point and point-to-multipoint

data,”?!

On 21 February 2001, Law 17,296 created the Regulatory Unit for Communications
Services (hereinafter “URSEC”, its Spanish acronym), as a decentralized body of the
Executive Branch. Under Article 73 of this Law, the URSEC is responsible for regulating
and controlling activities relating to telecommunications, “...which are understood as any
transmission or reception of signs, signals, written messages, images, sounds, or
information of any nature by wire, radio, optical, and other electromagnetic systems, and
also those activities that concern the admission, processing, transportation, and distribution

of correspondence by postal operators.”?”

On 25 March 2003, Decree 114/003 on the Management and Supervision of the Radio
Electric Spectrum, was approved for the purpose of, inter alia, providing for an efficient
use of the radio electric spectrum, promoting the use thereof as a force for economic and
social advancement and providing for an equal access to radio electric resources under

open, transparent and nondiscriminatory procedures (Article 2).?

On 25 March 2003, Decree 115/003 on the Telecommunications Licenses Regulation

Decree was also approved. Article 9 thereof reads as follows:

“1. Class A - Telecommunications License: Grants authorization for
the operation of a public telecommunications network and the
provision through these means of telecommunications services
technically and legally feasible according to laws in force, with the
exception of cable TV. The license includes the right and obligation
to provide interconnection and negotiate reciprocal compensation
for switched telephone network access and terminating access
services.

2. Class E - Telecommunications License: Grants authorization for
the provision of telecommunications services using the network,

There are three sub-classes within this category:

Class BI Telecommunications License: Grants authorization for the
provision of telecommunications services arising from its technical
plan and for the provision of which the licensee needs to access
numeration resources, links or other means of the networks of
holders of Class A Telecommunications licenses.

Class B2 Telecommunications License: Grants authorization for the
provision of telecommunications services arising from its technical
plan and for the provision of which the licensee does not need to
access numeration resources, links or other means of the networks
of holders of Class A Telecommunications licenses.

3. Class C - License for the lease of telecommunications links, media
and systems: Grants authorization exclusively for the installation of
telecommunications links, media and systems for the provision
thereof or to be leased to licensees of telecommunications services.

4. Class D — Cable TV License: Grants authorization for the
provision of television services through subscription which require
the use of wired or wireless transmission media for the broadcast of
contents. ”>*

On 6 July 2005, Mr. Luis Herb6n, Director of Trigosul at that time, sent a letter to Engineer
Juan Piaggio, URSEC’s General Manager (from 31 March 2005 to 1 December 2008)? in
which he stated the following: “We are writing to request that you adjust TRIGOSUL
S.A.’s data transmission license in accordance with the provisions set forth in Law No.
17,296 dated February 21, 2001 and in Decrees 114/03 and 115/03 dated March 25,
2003.”26

On 15 August 2005, Mr. Herbon sent a further letter to Mr. Piaggio in which he reported

the import of equipment by Trigosul and sought its homologation. In addition, he added

the following: “... we would appreciate it if you could inform us of the procedure initiated
some time ago, by letter dated July 6, 2005, for the adjustment of the allocation of
frequencies to TRIGOSUL, S.A., in accordance with the provisions of Act No. 17.296 of
February 21, 2001 and the Decrees 114/03 115/03 both dated March 25, 2003.”?”

The Treaty was signed on 4 November 2005 and came into force on 1 November 2006.7*

On 26 January 2006, Mr. Herbon sent a letter to Mr. Ricardo Martinez of URSEC in which
he referred to a debt payment agreement of Trigosul with the URSEC (by way of usage of
the radio spectrum), as per file 2003/1/1419; Mr. Herbon also referred to the request for
adjustment of Trigosul’s license (as per file 2005/1/1476) and to a negotiation with another
company called UTE, which required URSEC’s authorization to transport a data signal
through dark fiber belonging to UTE. In addition, Mr. Herbon pointed out that the
adjustment of the license had delayed another investment in the amount of USD 6,500,000,
and that those investors demanded the adjustment as a condition to continue with the
project.??

On 23 March 2006, Mr. Herbon sent another letter, via fax, to Mr. Leon Lev, President of
URSEC (from 15 August 2005 to 2 June 2008),*° in which reference was made to a meeting
they had held on 15 March 2006. Mr. Herbon also referred to a meeting of Trigosul
shareholders with potential investors, and he stated that the latter required the “B1 type
license”, as per Decree 115/2003, to make their investment, for which reason he appealed

to Mr. Lev of URSEC “...to define this situation [of the license] favorably.”*!

On 27 December 2006, Decree 249/006 set forth that URSEC would hold a public bidding
process “...to allocate the available spectrum in the band from 3,300 MHz to 3,700 MHz

for terrestrial services. ..”°7

On 8 March 2007, the National Administration of Telecommunications (hereinafter,
“ANTEL,” its Spanish acronym) issued the “Response of the National
Telecommunications Administration to the Open Consultation on the ‘Public Bidding
Process for the Allocation of Radio Spectrum in the Band 3300-3700 MHz.”” In that
document, ANTEL expressed its opposition to the public bidding process proposed by
URSEC. It concluded in a section under the title “Re-allocation and re-assignation of the
Band” that, given the public bidding process project, the 3.3GHz to 3.7GHz band should
be re-allocated in its entirety, under non-discriminatory conditions to the different

interested telecommunications providers.**

On 17 February 2009, Article 9 of Decree 115/003 (paragraph 91 above) was amended by

Executive Order IE 810 in the following terms:
“Article 9 — Classes of license

Telecommunications License — Class A: Authorizes the operation of
a public telecommunications system and the provision by those
means of telecommunications services that are technically and
legally viable according to current legislation, with the exception of
the subscriber television service. The license includes the right and
the obligation to provide interconnection and to negotiate
reciprocal compensation for access services or telephone switched
termination.

Telecommunications License — Class B: Authorizes the provision of
all data transmission services that are technically and legally viable
according to current legislation, using as support their own
network, resources or links or those of another provider, on the
conditions freely agreed between the parties.

Subscriber Television License — Class D: Authorizes the provision
of television services by subscription that require the use of wired
or wireless transmission means for broadcast of the contents.”**

On 30 July 2010, Mr. Herbon sent a letter to URSEC in which he reported the relocation
of “...the transmission equipment from its current location to the city of Punta del Este, on
the building El Torreén, pent house, District of Maldonado. This relocation involves a
change in the service we are providing, as we will begin to [sic] provide [a] data

transmission service.”

On 28 December 2010, Dra. Graciela Coronel, URSEC’s General Counsel, issued a report
regarding Trigosul in which she stated that on 21 December 2010, URSEC had conducted
an inspection at the address reported by Trigosul in December 2006 (at Torre El Gaucho)
and that the company was not found at that address. She added that URSEC had no record
whatsoever of the relocation or the authorizations for new stations; she concluded that
Trigosul was not providing services. Her report also noted that the last affidavit submitted
by that company on the Regulatory Framework Control Fee was from the July-September
2009 period. Based on Decree 114/003, Dra. Coronel recommended the revocation of the

authorization and release of the frequencies.*°

On 12 January 2011, Mr. Herbon sent a letter to Engineer Gabriel Lombide, President of
URSEC (since 23 August 2010)*’ in which he referred to Dr. Coronel’s report. He
explained that on 30 July 2010, Trigosul had sent a communication to URSEC, via fax, in
which he reported Trigosul’s relocation to the District of Maldonado (see paragraph 100
above); Mr. Herb6n also reported an inspection Trigosul had requested on 6 October 2010,

and denied non-compliance with the payment for the use of the spectrum. In addition, Mr.

Herbon pointed out that since 2005, the company had requested readjustment of the license
and he referred to a visit he had made, in March 2006, to Mr. Leén Lev, President of
URSEC, at which he had submitted a Memorandum in which he stated that the lack of
adjustment of the license “adds to our authorization a legal instability that made us threaten

investments.”>*

On 19 January 2011, Dra. Isabel Maassardjian, URSEC’s Legal Advisor, issued a “Legal
Report” in which, among other things, she pointed out that the arguments invoked by
Trigosul (see the preceding paragraph) contributed no new evidence “to contradict what
has been duly reported” (referring to Dr. Coronel’s report). Therefore, she recommended:
(a) releas[ing] the frequencies established in URSEC Resolution No. 444/000 of 12
December 2000 (see paragraph 88 above) and (b) “propos[ing] that the Executive Power
revoke the authorisation granted to the company by Resolution No. 142/000 of February
8, 2000, annulling Resolution No. 97-219 of January 17, 1997.” (See paragraph 84

above).°?

On 20 January 2011, URSEC issued Resolution 001 by which it released “... sub-blocks
K and M, corresponding to the 3425-3450 MHz and 3525-3550 MHz sub-bands of
frequencies that were assigned to Trigosul S.A. through the National Department of

Communications’ Resolution No. 444/000 of December 12, 2000.”*°

On 1| March 2011, Trigosul filed “the appeal for revocation and the appeal on a subsidiary
basis to the higher administrative authority” against Resolution 001 issued by URSEC on
20 January 2011.4!

On 8 July 2011, through Resolution 335/011, the Ministry of Industry, Energy and Mining
(MIEM) revoked “... the authorization transferred to the company TRIGOSUL S.A.

On 23 October 2014, the “Tribunal de lo Contencioso Administrativo” rendered Judgment
579/2014 (the “Judgment”) that decided to annul the administrative acts challenged
(URSEC Resolution 001 and MIEM Resolution 335/011).4”

On 23 December 2014, Mr. Herbon sent a letter to URSEC in which he requested the
homologation of the equipment to be imported.** On 19 January 2015, he repeated his

requ est.?

On 5 February 2015, Mr. Herbon sent a letter to Engineer Gabriel Lombide (Director of
URSEC) (received on 9 February 2015), in which, on the basis of the Judgment, he asked
URSEC to “[o]rder that TRIGOSUL S.A. be inscribed in the Register of Data Transmission
Service Providers.” He also asked URSEC to “[o]rder that the necessary measures be taken
to place TRIGOSUL S.A. in the situation that it was in when URSEC Decision No. 001 of
January 20, 2011 (now annulled) was issued so that it can once again provide the

7950

telecommunications services made possible by the allocated frequencies.

On 26 February 2015, Dra. Susana Gianarelli, Clerk of the “Tribunal de lo Contencioso
Administrativo”, sent Engineer Lombide a letter whereby, as provided for in the Judgment,

she returned the administrative record of Trigosul.*!

On 5 August 2015, Italba informed the Government of Uruguay that the present dispute

had arisen.”

On 5 April 2016, by means of Executive Order IE 156, the MIEM decided: “[t]o overturn
decision No. 335/011 of the Executive Branch, dated July 8, 2011, and to establish the full
effectiveness of the authorization granted to Gustavo Alberelli by means of Executive

Branch decision No. 75 — 219 of January 17, 1997 and the transfer to TRIGOSUL S.A.

authorized by Executive Branch decision No. 142/000 dated February 8, 2000, indicating
that it is authorized under the conditions established in the original decision: to provide in
the national territory, commercial, dedicated wireless digital lines, without connection to
the public telephone network, for the transmission of point-to-point and point to multipoint
data.” In addition, such Resolution indicated: “[t]o order the Regulatory Unit of
Communication Services to allocate the corresponding frequencies for the provision of the

service, in accordance with the above paragraph.”**

On 27 April 2016, Mr. Herbon sent Engineer Lombide a communication referred to as
“Conducting of hearing,” stating that, according to URSEC Minutes No. 3 of 4 February
2016, the following blocks of frequencies were reserved: 3600-3625 MHz and 2675-3700
MHz [though not expressly stated in Mr. Herbon’s communication, the Tribunal
understands that reservation was made for Trigosul]. Mr. Herbon added that those were not
Trigosul’s previous frequencies, but that Trigosul S.A. had sub-blocks 3425-3450 MHz
and 3525-3550 MHz. Moreover, he reported that the frequencies reserved by URSEC “are
not as useful or valuable as the frequencies that TRIGOSUL S.A. had previously, which
were taken from it by the annulled decision.” Mr. Herbon stated that that was the reason

why he did not accept the frequencies proposed by URSEC.*

On 6 May 2016, Mr. Yanos, Italba’s counsel, sent a letter to the Respondent’s counsel,
stating that the 3600-3625 MHz and 3675-3700 MHz frequencies were not those
previously expropriated by Uruguay from Italba and its subsidiary, Trigosul. He added that
those frequencies were worthless and, therefore, did not conform to Uruguay’s obligation
to provide Italba with “prompt, adequate, and effective” compensation under the Treaty.*>
On the same day, Respondent’s counsel stated that Uruguay disagreed with the assertions

made in such communication.*°

On 19 May 2016, Uruguay sent Italba a draft URSEC resolution dated 9 May 2016.

Uruguay proposed to revoke Decision No. 220/013, leaving without effect the replacement

of the allocation of sub-blocks established therein to the company, Dedicado S.A.,

and 3525-3550 MHz, “of a temporary and revocable nature, for the provision in national
territory, of commercial, dedicated wireless digital lines, without connection to the public

telephone network, for the transmission of point-to-point to multipoint data.”>’

120. On 31 May 2016, counsel for Italba sent a letter to counsel for the Respondent in
connection with the draft Resolution dated 9 May 2016, stating that: “The Draft Resolution
purports to comply, almost two years after the fact, with legal obligations that URSEC
faced when the Uruguayan courts ordered it in October 2014 to reinstate the investments
made by Italba in Uruguay. We write to advise you that Italba categorically rejects the

proposal in the Draft Resolution.”**

IV. THE PARTIES’ CLAIMS

121. Italba’s position, based on Article 6 of the Treaty, is that Uruguay expropriated its
investment.*®® Italba stated that it has 100% ownership and control of Trigosul, its
subsidiary enterprise in Uruguay. According to the Claimant, through Trigosul, Italba held
a license and had the right to operate in the spectrum and provide wireless data services in
Uruguay. Italba contended that such license is a protected investment under Article 1 of
the Treaty. It added that part of its investment includes telecommunications equipment,

office equipment, commercial leases, and other tangible property held by Trigosul.©°
122. Regarding its investments, Italba also pointed out that:

“Ttalba began investing in Uruguay twenty years ago. Since that
time, Italba has made substantial contributions of capital,
amounting to several million dollars, toward the development and
operation of a telecommunications company to provide wireless
data services within Uruguay. Around 1999, Italba acquired

Trigosul as a subsidiary enterprise. Through Trigosul, Italba
purchased equipment, — hired _ personnel, obtained a
telecommunications license, and began commercial operation in
Uruguay in June 2003. Throughout the period of its development
and operation of Trigosul, Italba was exposed to market risks in the
telecommunications industry. Therefore, Italba’s acti
Uruguay qualify as ‘investments.’”°!

 

Italba claimed a breach of Article 5 of the Treaty whereby Uruguay had an obligation to
accord investors fair and equitable treatment. According to the Claimant, the Respondent

failed to accord it due process and also denied it justice.©

The Claimant added that Uruguay accorded it a treatment less favorable than that accorded,
in like circumstances, to other investors, in breach of Articles 3 and 4 of the Treaty. Based
on Article 5 of the Treaty, it also contended that Uruguay failed to provide its investment
with full protection and security. Furthermore, on the basis of Article 4 of the Treaty,
which contains the Most Favored Nation clause, Italba relied on the Agreement between
the Government of the Oriental Republic of Uruguay and the Government of the Republic
of Venezuela for the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investments, which is

not limited to police protection like the Treaty.©

The Respondent considered that there was no expropriation in this case, as Uruguayan
authorities complied with the Judgment.®° In addition, neither the revocation of the
frequencies, nor their allocation to Dedicado S.A. may be deemed an expropriation, as the
allocations of frequencies in the spectrum “...are provisional and revocable in nature, and

do not confer rights recognized or protected by law in Uruguay.”®”

126. Furthermore, the Respondent stated that Article 5 of the Treaty enshrines a minimum
standard of treatment, which Italba purports to extend in its claim, although it has failed to
show grounds for such a broad interpretation. Uruguay asserted that Trigosul was not
treated less favorably than any other company in like circumstances,” and stated: “[nJone
of the alleged adjusted or adapted licenses was issued to any of the companies mentioned

by the Claimant.”

127. In connection with full protection and security, Uruguay asserted that the protection set
forth in the Treaty is limited to “...police protection of the investment against any action
of a criminal nature.””! It added that “[t]he clear intention of the States Parties regarding
the definition of this obligation, which was a fundamental condition of their agreement to
the BIT, cannot be annulled by importing a contrary definition in another treaty by mere

operation of a most favored nation clause.”””

128. The positions of the Parties having been summarized, the Tribunal notes that, by reason of
its decision on the jurisdictional objections, it will not elaborate further on the arguments

on the merits of the dispute.

129. Before it addresses the jurisdictional issues, the Tribunal will proceed, in the following

section, to analyze the Claimant’s challenges to one of the experts for Uruguay.

Vv. EXPERT REPORT OF PROFESSOR DE MELLO
A. The Parties’ Positions

130. At the Hearing, the Claimant questioned the independence of one of the experts for the
Respondent, Professor Eugenio Xavier de Mello Ferrand, a member of the law firm

Ramirez, Xavier de Mello & Abal (the “Firm”). The Claimant pointed out that members

of the Firm are currently representing the Republic of Uruguay in another arbitration
proceeding. In its communications of 21 November and | December 2017, the Claimant

reiterated its objections and questioned the expert’s independence.”*

In the course of the Hearing, Professor de Mello answered the questions posed by the
Claimant’s counsel, confirmed that he is a member of the Firm, and indicated that he had
recently learned that attorneys at the Firm were representing Uruguay in another case. He
explained that the Firm is based on a model called an “economic interest group,”
(hereinafter “GIE”, its Spanish acronym) a French concept, where there is a central
services unit, but the relationship between the attorneys and their clients is individual, as

each attorney works independently and autonomously from the others.”
Professor de Mello stated:

“Now, I’d like to add that the economic interest group is a contract
which is entered in the national commercial registry. This economic
interest group that I'm part of is entered in the national commercial
registry, and the text expressly states that each attorney works
separately and that we are not partners. We have no joint and
several responsibility. We are not responsible or liable for what the
other lawyers do. Therefore, I don't think that I need to be involved
in any conflict of interest because of any action that my colleagues
in the economic interest group may be involved in.””°

Professor de Mello reported at the hearing that he had not consulted the other attorneys at
the Firm about potential conflicts of interest when Uruguay retained him to issue the report

in question, because the said attorneys enjoy autonomy in their professional work, and such

GIE is regulated by the Uruguayan Commercial Companies Act (Articles 469 et seq).”°

At the Hearing, counsel for Italba questioned Professor de Mello’s independence by stating
that he was a “partner” of some attorneys at the Firm who are currently representing

Uruguay in another case.”

On 21 November 2017, Italba questioned Professor de Mello’s independence once again,
on the basis of Article 5(2) (a) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International
Arbitration (the “IBA Rules”). Italba pointed out that Professor de Mello had breached the
provisions of such Article by failing to disclose in his report that the Firm was representing
Uruguay in another proceeding. Italba questioned Professor de Mello’s alleged lack of
awareness of the mandate of his “partners”, it being public and common knowledge that
“{mJore importantly economic relationships similar to the one described by Prof. Xavier
de Mello have been held to be insufficient to overcome the conflict created when one
member of a law firm or law firm-like entity acts for a client and another member of the
same firm proclaims independence from that client. On this point, the tribunal’s decision
in Hrvatska v. Republic of Slovenia’® (“Hrvatska”) is instructive.””? For these reasons, by
its letter of 21 November 2017, Italba invited the Tribunal to disregard Professor de Mello’s

report.

On 30 November 2017, Uruguay stated that Article 490 of the Commercial Companies Act
(Law No. 16,060) (the “Commercial Companies Act”), enacted on 4 September 1989,
draws a distinction between a GIE and a traditional law firm. According to the Respondent,
the members of a GIE are independent from each other; it is a group of people who share
facilities and administrative services for convenience. Each member has her/his own clients

and receives her/his own fees.*?

Regarding the IBA Rules and experts’ independence, Uruguay cited to the “Commentary

on the revised text of the 2010 IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International

Arbitration” as follows: “... the rules’ references to the independence of party-appointed
experts is understood ‘in the sense that he or she has no financial interest in the outcome
or otherwise has relationships that would prevent the expert from providing his or her

honest and frank opinion.””*!

In connection with the reference to “partners” on the Firm’s website, Uruguay indicated
that, in the instant case, such term does not have the same meaning as that attributed to
“partners” in the context of the members of an American law firm. Uruguay pointed out
that another member of the Firm was one of the main experts in another case against
Uruguay. It also stated that the Hrvatska case cited by Italba does not apply to this case, as

it concerned a member of the arbitral tribunal itself rather than an expert.*?

On 1 December 2017, Italba repeated its request that the Tribunal decline to consider the
evidence of Professor de Mello. It pointed out that the Firm’s agreement to serve as counsel
for Uruguay in a separate arbitration was in force when Professor de Mello issued his report
in this arbitration proceeding and was still effective at the time of his testimony. It indicated
that these facts disqualify Professor de Mello as an independent expert in accordance with

Article 5 (2) (c) of the IBA Rules.

Italba pointed out that on its website, the Firm describes itself as “... (a) a single law firm
that (b) shares associates, (c) describes its clients as jointly held, and (d) seeks to share the
prestige of each individual member for the benefit of the group and each of its members.”
According to the Claimant, such website refers to the Firm’s “partners” and to the provision
of a comprehensive professional service; it also stated that the members of the Firm share

a team of associates and offer full legal assistance.**

For Italba, the Firm owes loyalty to Uruguay, and, when referring to the case in which a

member of the Firm acted as an expert against Uruguay in another arbitration proceeding,

the Respondent forgets that such proceeding, and, thus, the potential conflict for this case,
have concluded. In Italba’s opinion, Hrvatska is relevant in its analysis of the failure of the

persons challenged to disclose their professional relationships.

Italba considered that “...Mello’s undisclosed relationship disqualifies him as an

85

independent expert in this case.

On 8 December 2017, Uruguay stated that Italba had taken no account of the fact that
Professor de Mello obtained no economic benefit from the professional work of the other
members of the Firm representing Uruguay or the colleague who issued a report in another

case against Uruguay.*°

Uruguay considered that the fact that the Firm’s website uses the word “partners” is
irrelevant, as the GIE structure in Uruguay means an entity the members of which are both
professionally and financially independent. The reference to “their clients” on the website
does not support Italba’s statement that the members of the Firm share their fees. It also
stressed that the members of the firm do not share clients or income or associate attorneys
with one another. It asserted that the statement whereby the members of the Firm seek “...
to benefit from their association with one another beyond the need to share costs” does not
show how Professor de Mello’s independence is compromised. Uruguay disputed the
application of the Hrvatska case to this proceeding and pointed out that, in response to the
Tribunal’s questions at the hearing, Professor de Mello answered that he did not, and will

not, receive any of the fees to be collected by his Firm colleagues.*”
The Tribunal’s Decision

As stated above, in the course of the Hearing and in their Post-Hearing Briefs on the matter,
counsel for Italba questioned Professor de Mello’s independence on the ground that he is
a “partner” of other attorneys at his Firm representing Uruguay in another case. The

Tribunal adds that the word socio is often translated into English as “partner”. However,

5 Italba’s Letter, | December 2017, page 3.

86

Uruguay’s Letter, 8 December 2017, page 2.

*7 Uruguay’s Letter, 8 December 2017, pages 3 and 4.

34

this translation is not always accurate. According to “Diccionario de la Lengua Espafiola
de la Real Academia Espafola,” the first entry of the word “socio” is “a person associated
with another or others for a purpose.” In turn, the word “asociar” has several meanings.
The one relevant to the issue in dispute is “to get together or gather for a purpose.” That is
why there is not necessarily a complete correspondence between the English word

“partner” and the Spanish word “socio.”

146. The Tribunal considers that, in order to decide this issue, it should examine the rules that
lay down the structure of GIE in Uruguay. Article 489 of the Commercial Companies Act

provides:

“(Concept). Two or more natural or legal persons may form an
economic interest group for the purpose of promoting or developing
the economic activity of its members, or else improving or
increasing the results thereof. By itself, it shall entitle its associates
neither to derive nor to be distributed profits, and it may be
organized without a capital. It shall be a legal person.” [Tribunal’s
Translation]**

147. Pursuant to the foregoing Article, such an entity may be formed by natural or legal persons
in order to promote or develop the economic activity of its members. In the case at issue,
the economic activity of the members of the Firm is to offer professional legal services.
The rule quoted above also provides that a further purpose of GIEs is to improve or increase
the results of such activity. That does not necessarily mean that its members work jointly
or seek to derive shared profits. Such Article is crystal clear when stating that the GIE itself
entitles its associates neither to derive, nor to be distributed, profits and adds that it may
even be formed without any capital contributions, which is not the case of other legal

entities, such as corporations.
148. Professor de Mello stated at the Hearing:

“This economic interest group that I’m part of is entered in the
national commercial registry, and the text expressly states that each
attorney works separately and that we are not partners. We have no

88 Commercial Companies Act of 4 September 1989, Article 489, EXM-006.

35

joint and several responsibility. We are not responsible or liable for
what the other lawyers do.”*”

149. — Italba questioned neither such registration nor the statements made by Professor de Mello;
it particularly referred to the contents of the Firm’s website, which describes the Firm as a
result of the merger of two firms, able to draw on the experience of its individual members
to provide a full range of legal services to its clients. The website also refers to the Firm’s

“clients” and describes its members as “partners”.”°

150. The Tribunal is aware that there are various ways in which legal professionals collaborate
to render their services. The most commonly adopted model has been that in which a group
of legal professionals owns a law firm, which hires other attorneys to provide services as
“associates”, “assistants” or in other capacities which vary depending on the country and
the structure of the law firm. Nevertheless, the Tribunal is also aware that, in different
countries, and especially in Latin America, it is often the case that attorneys work
individually, or a group of legal professionals share expenses, facilities and other services,

each of them being completely independent from the others as far as her/his professional

work is concerned and obtaining no benefit from the work of her/his colleagues.

151. The Tribunal considers that the GIE of which Professor de Mello is a member cannot be
equated as a law firm in which the members are in partnership and share profits. An GIE
in Uruguay is more akin to a barristers’ chambers in England and it has long been
recognized that there is no automatic disqualification, for example, where a member of a
barristers’ chambers acts as an arbitrator in a case where another member is acting as
counsel. A fortiori, there cannot be an automatic disqualification in circumstances where

a member acts as an expert either.

152. The Claimant places particular emphasis upon the fact that Professor de Mello did not
disclose, in his report or otherwise, that other colleagues of the GIE of which he is a
member, are currently advising Uruguay in another arbitration. Professor de Mello

acknowledged at the Hearing that he failed to disclose that Uruguay had retained other

156.

members of the Firm in those proceedings; he stated that he failed to make such disclosure
because he was not aware of such circumstance when preparing his report for this

arbitration proceeding. Italba questions this assertion as hard to believe.

Once again, the nature of the GIE structure must inform the extent and content of any
disclosure obligation upon Professor de Mello. If the members of a GIE do not share
profits and are not considered to be in conflict of interest situation when they act on
different sides in the same case under Uruguayan law, then there would be no reason for
Professor de Mello to disclose that other members of the GIE of which he is part were
advising Uruguay in another arbitration. Again, an analogy might be drawn with a
barristers’ chamber in England where one member has no right to information about the
activities of another member and it would be a breach of that member’s duty of
confidentiality to his/her client to disclose such information. In those circumstances it
cannot be appropriate to require the member to disclose information about the activities of
other members within the same barristers’ chambers. There is no doubt that similar

considerations apply to members of a GIE under Uruguayan law.

In respect of the Claimant’s reliance on how the members of the Firm are characterized on
the internet, the Tribunal considers that what is important is the legal structure of the Firm
rather than how it is described on a website. In this case, the Firm is entered as a GIE in
the National Commercial Registry. The contents of a website cannot alter the legal

structure or registration of the Firm.

Therefore, the Tribunal considers that the contents of the Firm’s website neither warrant
Italba’s challenge to Professor de Mello’s independence nor prove that the professional
service he rendered to Uruguay had been affected by the work currently or previously

performed by other colleagues for or against Uruguay.

Article 5 (2) (a) and (c) of the IBA Rules does not require an expert to submit a statement
concerning the present or past relationship with the Parties of all the members of her/his
law firm, office, corporation or any other legal structure of which the expert is part. Such
tule is very specific and refers to the expert’s present or past relationship with any of the

Parties and other actors in the proceeding (legal advisors and members of the Tribunal).

37

157. An expert’s objectivity and independence may be impaired, inter alia, by economic and
personal factors. From the economic standpoint, it is crystal clear that merely receiving
fees for the preparation of a report does not interfere with the expert’s independence;?! an
expert could not be expected to work pro bono as a prerequisite to her/his independence.
Objectivity could be impaired if an expert participated in an arbitration proceeding and it
was shown that she/he would obtain an economic benefit if the outcome of the proceeding

were favorable to the retaining party.

158. Professor de Mello made it very clear at the Hearing that he was not aware of the fact that
other members of the Firm serve as counsel for Uruguay in a separate arbitration
proceeding. He was adamant that neither he nor the GIE of which he is a member obtains
any direct economic benefit from the fees that his colleagues will receive in consideration

for their work in such case.”

159. An expert’s independence should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. In the instant case,
Professor de Mello was not proved to have obtained from Uruguay, either directly or

otherwise, an economic benefit which may affect his independence.

160. The case cited by Italba, Hrvatska, does not assist the Tribunal’s analysis, because it
addressed a fundamentally different issue; namely, the power to exclude a new member of
a counsel team in circumstances where the independence and impartiality of an arbitrator
could have been brought into question if that new member were permitted to continue to

act.

161. Based on the foregoing analysis, the Tribunal rejects Italba’s request that the report

prepared by Professor de Mello be excluded from the record of this arbitration proceeding.

JURISDICTION

Uruguay raised jurisdictional objections and defenses on the merits. It considers that the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction because Italba neither owns nor controls Trigosul and therefore
cannot rely on the protection of the Treaty or the ICSID Convention; in addition, Italba has
no substantial economic and business activities in the United States and, moreover, it is
controlled by a national of a country that is not a Party to the Treaty, as Dr. Alberelli is
Italian. Uruguay also contends that Italba’s claims are time-barred, since Italba learned
about Uruguay’s purported breach and the damage allegedly caused thereby on 29 March
2011, not 2015, as Italba maintains. The Respondent also asserts that the rights arising from
Trigosul’s authorization to provide services and its allocation of frequencies are not rights

protected under domestic law, as required by Article 1 of the Treaty.”

The Tribunal will summarize and analyze the Parties’ arguments, and set out its own

analysis and conclusions, in the following Section.
Ownership of the investment and control over Trigosul

(1) The Parties’ Positions
a. Respondent’s Counter-Memorial

Uruguay submitted that, although Italba bore the burden of proof, it had failed to prove its
ownership of Trigosul’s shares. Uruguay also indicated that the Claimant’s evidence, so
far as those matters were concerned, consisted of the statements of Messrs. Alberelli and
Herbon, both of whom have direct interest in this proceeding, and an Advocacy
Questionnaire submitted by Mr. Herbén to the Embassy of the United States in Uruguay,

in which he indicated that Italba owned Trigosul.*

According to the Respondent, on 9 August 1999, when Dr. Alberelli requested the DNC to

transfer to Trigosul the authorization that had been granted to him (see paragraph 83

above), Italba did not own or control Trigosul. On 4 November 1999, Mr. Herbon sent the
DNC a communication in which he indicated that Trigosul’s owners were Mr. Alberelli,
with 95% of the shares, and his mother, Ms. Carmela Caravetta Durante, with the

remaining 5%.°>

Uruguay also submitted that, according to Article 15 of Decree 115/003, Trigosul, as a
license holder, should have obtained prior authorization from the Executive or from
URSEC to conduct any shareholding change”® and there is no evidence whatsoever that

Trigosul had requested any such authorization.

In addition, Uruguay adduced a report by the Director General of Public Registries and
another by the Internal Revenue Services, in which those agencies indicated that there was

no evidence in their records that Trigosul was a subsidiary of Italba.°”

b. Claimant’s Reply Memorial

Italba asserted that “at all relevant times,” it owned Trigosul and, in any event, controlled
the company. Furthermore, it submitted that, according to Florida law and Uruguayan law,

Italba owns Trigosul.”*

Italba submitted the following: “...in 2002, when the Alberellis realized that they had not
formally transferred Trigosul’s shares to Italba, they took action. First, in May 2002, they
asked Dr. Alberelli’s mother to transfer her shares in Trigosul to Dr. Alberelli, which she
did. Second, in August 2002, the shares were transferred to Italba and moved to Miami,
Florida and placed in a safety deposit box that Dr. Alberelli and his wife owned for the

purpose of maintaining important documentation belonging to Italba. To indicate that the

shares now belonged to Italba, Dr. Alberelli noted on the back of the bundle of shares that

170. In addition to the statements in the preceding paragraph, the Claimant asserted that, since
the acquisition of Trigosul, Italba made the investments necessary to provide the company
with all of its funds. Italba also pointed out that, on 11 June 2001, it registered with the
Embassy of the United States of America as the owner of Trigosul, and that by letter of 9
July 2001 it advised the Uruguayan government that Trigosul was owned by Italba.!°° It
added that Italba negotiated with different companies, both in the United States and
elsewhere, and that in those negotiations it held itself out as the owner of Trigosul.!°!

171. Based on Articles 30 (1) of the Treaty and Article 2,398 of the Uruguayan Civil Code,
Italba added that, considering that Dr. Alberelli was in Florida at the moment of
transferring Trigosul’s shares to Italba (see paragraph 169 above), that transaction is
governed by Florida law.'” It also submitted that, according to that legislation, the transfer
of shares is completed with the act of delivery, which in this case occurred when, after
endorsing Trigosul’s stock certificates with a notation indicating the transfer of his
ownership interest to Italba, Dr. Alberelli placed them in a safety box in his and his wife’s

name. !°3

On the

Based on that theory of economic reality, the Claimant submitted that: (a) Italba made
Trigosul’s business decisions, developed its business plan, commissioned studies in 1999
for that plan, and sought out, negotiated and contracted with potential partners on behalf of

Trigosul;!°° (b) Italba contributed to the “overwhelming majority” of Trigosul’s share

capital

632,674 Uruguayan pesos”!°’ of which a capital increase from 182,500 to 690,000
Uruguayan pesos was subsequently approved; therefore, Italba contributed 92,04% of
Trigosul’s share capital;!°* (c) Italba funded Trigosul’s operations and purchased

equipment for Trigosul; Mr. Herbén informed the DNC in October 2000 that Italba had

“Under Uruguayan domestic corporate law, a party can
demonstrate ownership [the text of Article 305 of the Commercial
Companies Act refers to the transmission of shares] in one of three
ways: (a) by endorsing a stock certificate with a notation of the
transfer, delivering the certificates to the transferee, and/or
registering the transfer in the company’s stock ledger; (b) in the
absence of a formal transfer of shares, by demonstrating that, as a
matter of “economic reality,” the party owned and acted as the
owner of the company; and (c) by making capital contributions to
the company.” !°*

basis of its expert report, Italba submitted that:

“In the case of Trigosul, Dr. Luis Lapique, an expert in Uruguayan
corporate law, concluded that the corporate records are so mutually
inconsistent and error-filled that they cannot be relied upon to
represent the reality of how Trigosul functioned. Thus, ‘[iJt is
imperative to resort to the economic reality behind Trigosul’ in
determining its ownership and to consider evidence of how the
company actually operated, including whether the parent company
understood itself to be the owner of the subsidiary, acted in a
manner consistent with ownership, and held itself out to third
parties as the owner.”

as follows: “[iJn early 2001, Italba made a capital contribution to Trigosul of

purchased equipment for Trigosul, and a resolution by the President of Uruguay in
September 2002 recognized Italba’s purchase of equipment for Trigosul; issued checks for
Trigosul’s expenses and used a USD 25,000 bond for that company’s expenses!””; and (d)

Italba routinely held itself out to third parties as the owner of Trigosul.!!°

With respect to the communication sent by Mr. Herbon in November 1999, in which he
informed the DNC that Trigosul’s shareholders were Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta (see
paragraph 165 above), Italba pointed out that, regardless of Mr. Herb6n’s understanding at
that time about who Trigosul’s shareholders were, the truth was that Ms. Caravetta
transferred her shares to Dr. Alberelli in May 2002 and Dr. Alberelli transferred all of his
shares to Italba in August 2002.!!! As regards the obligation outlined in Decree 115/003
(see paragraph 166 above), to ask for authorization for a change in shareholding in a
corporate license holder, Italba explained that such rule post-dated the share transfer carried

out by Ms. Caravetta and Mr. Alberelli.!!?

For the Claimant, even rejecting the economic reality doctrine in favor of a formalistic
approach to ownership, Italba would own 93.36% of Trigosul’s shares, because it
contributed 92.04% of the share capital, and at least one of Trigosul’s shares (amounting
to an “additional 1.33% of the company”) was transferred to Italba via an endorsement on

the back of the share certificate.!'5

Based on Dr. Lapique’s opinion, the Claimant asserted that, under the Uruguayan
legislation, the contribution to the share capital suffices to confer shareholder status,
regardless of the formalities. The Claimant pointed out that on 31 October 2001, Trigosul’s
Shareholders’ Meeting agreed on a capital increase from 182,500 to 690,000 Uruguayan
pesos and recognized Italba’s contribution of 632,674 Uruguayan pesos, (92.04% of the

share capital). For Italba, the fact that Trigosul did not formally complete the increase in

the authorized capital by recording it with the National Registry of Commerce and failed
to issue new shares reflecting Italba’s capital contribution does not deprive Italba of its

92.04% ownership of Trigosul.!!4

According to Italba, even if the Tribunal were to find that Italba does not own Trigosul, the
Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the claims brought against Uruguay should still be upheld
because Italba controls Trigosul within the meaning of Article 24 of the Treaty.''> Italba
submitted that ICSID’s case law has analyzed the concept of control flexibly and broadly
and with the intention to expand rather than restrict jurisdiction. Among the criteria used,
Italba refers to: “share ownership, decision-making procedures, the exercise of
management, and ‘other economic criteria.””!!° In particular, Italba states that in Perenco
v. Ecuador “...the tribunal found that the claimants’ control of the relevant entity was
sufficient for jurisdiction, even though the claimants did not hold formal legal title in that

entity.”!!7
Italba also argued the following:

“\..the Tribunal should not ‘pierce any corporate veil’ to consider
whether control over Trigosul was exercised by Dr. Alberelli in his
individual capacity or in his capacity as the President of Italba. The
case law does not support looking behind the corporate form of the
claimant to its individual shareholders to determine which
shareholders control the claimant—indeed, the relevant question
for jurisdictional purposes is not who controls the claimant, but
whether the claimant controls the subsidiary.”''*

c. Respondent’s Rejoinder Memorial

Uruguay submitted that there are “inconsistencies and discrepancies” in Italba’s account

of the share transfer carried out in August 2002. As per Trigosul’s books, as at 10 October

2002 and as at 1 November of that same year, the only shareholders registered were Mr.
Alberelli and his mother, Ms. Caravetta. According to Uruguay, the fact that Italba is not
mentioned in those books is not an error or oversight, but a reflection of the reality of the
company at that time. Uruguay strongly criticizes the Claimant’s argument that, as
Trigosul’s records are not reliable, one should rely upon the statements made by Dr.
Alberelli, who is an interested party in the outcome of these proceedings, to prove the

alleged ownership of Trigosul’s shares.!!°

Uruguay submitted that Trigosul’s shares were not validly transferred to Italba. Dr.
Alberelli only endorsed one share in the name of Italba; the endorsement by Ms. Caravetta,
Dr. Alberelli’s mother, fails to mention where it was made.'”° Among other reasons, since
on the endorsement date (24 May 2002) they were both in Uruguay, Uruguayan law,
pursuant to which the transfer should be recorded in the company’s books to be valid, must

transfer, and therefore the transfer was necessarily invalid. On this basis, Uruguay submits

that Ms. Caravetta is still a shareholder in Trigosul.!”?

With respect to Dr. Alberelli’s alleged transfer of Trigosul’s shares by way of a donation
to Italba, in August 2002, Uruguay submitted that, although not applicable in this case,
according to Florida law, donations require the following: donative intent, delivery of
possession and acceptance by the recipient. None of these requirements are met in this

case.'?5

Regarding the intent to donate, Uruguay submitted that Dr. Alberelli only endorsed
certificate number 4 out of 20 certificates and, on the basis of the report by his expert, Mr.
Louis T.M. Conti, asserted that, “... the endorsement of only one stock certificate cannot

serve as an endorsement of the others.”!2* According to Uruguay, delivery of the

certificates did not take place either, as Dr. Alberelli retained possession of the shares at
all times, without transferring his dominion and control, as required by Florida law.
Furthermore, according to Mr. Conti, in Florida delivery can also be considered complete
if the recipient exercises dominion and control of the donation. Mr. Conti concluded that
Italba never exercised this dominion as there is no evidence on the record of Italba’s

participation in Trigosul’s shareholders’ meetings.!”°

As regards the acceptance requirement, Uruguay submitted that it was not met, given that
what Dr. Alberelli did was to deposit Trigosul’s shares in a safety box in the name of
himself and his wife, not in the name of Italba. In addition, Italba’s records from 2002 to

the present date do not show any revenues, losses or contributions related to Trigosul.!7°

Uruguay submitted that Italba recognized that, pursuant to Uruguayan law, it had no
ownership of Trigosul’s shares through endorsement or delivery of the certificates.
Instead, Italba argued that it owned Trigosul by virtue of the theory of economic reality.
Uruguay notes that, even Dr. Lapique, Italba’s expert, recognizes that this theory is based
on the concept of piercing the corporate veil, enshrined in Article 189 of the Commercial
Companies Act, for cases of fraudulent evasion of the law and violation of public order
and, as such, would not be applicable to the instant case.'?” Uruguay pointed out that its

expert, Professor de Mello, agree that “this theory does not apply to the present case.” !?

Uruguay submitted that, even if the economic reality theory were applicable to the present
case, the documents adduced as evidence by the Claimant fail to support its assertion that
Italba acted at all times as a shareholder of Trigosul. Some predate Trigosul’s license or
refer to Trigosul as a strategic partner, but they failed to prove Italba’s assertion that it was

which Italba relied upon to prove that it was funding Trigosul: these are preliminary or
draft documents that make reference to the shipment of equipment to Italba, not to Trigosul.
Uruguay also denied Italba’s assertion that the President of Uruguay recognized that Italba
had paid for Trigosul’s equipment (see paragraph 174 above); it argued that the document
with which the Claimant seeks to prove this assertion is a claim by Trigosul for the purchase
of radios from Italba, which was entitled “ITALBA invoice: USD 25,964,” and which
would refute the theory that Italba was paying for Trigosul’s equipment.'*° Uruguay also
criticized Italba’s attempt to prove its alleged funding of Trigosul during 15 years with
nothing more than two checks and a bond purchase.'*! Moreover, according to Uruguay,
the documents relied upon to prove that Italba held itself out as the owner of Trigosul fail
to prove any such assertion: only two of them postdate the alleged transfer of shares to

Italba, and none of them refers to the relationship between Italba and Trigosul.'>?

Uruguay also submitted that the letter dated 9 July 2001 from Mr. Albert Jansenson to the
Secretary of the Presidency (quoted at the footnote 100 of paragraph 170) predates the
alleged share transfer of 2002 and, thus, contradicts Italba’s argument that it owned
Trigosul; moreover, the sender of that letter was not Italba, and the signer thereof is a
person who Italba has never mentioned as a director or shareholder of Italba. Finally, in
the letter, reference was made to “majority shareholders” of Trigosul and, in these

proceedings, Italba has claimed to be the sole shareholder of Trigosul.'**

With respect to Italba’s alleged contributions to Trigosul’s share capital, Uruguay
submitted that there are no documents on the record supporting this allegation.
Additionally, in an attempt to prove those alleged contributions, Italba and its expert
witness, Dr. Lapique, relied on Trigosul’s books, which they criticized as being “filed with
errors” and unreliable.'*+ Uruguay also highlighted the inconsistencies between the date of

the alleged transfer and the date of entry in the corporate and statutory books, on which

Italba presumably transferred to Trigosul USD 35,000, “as reimbursement”. Similar doubts
were raised in respect of other alleged contributions in the amount of 632,674 Uruguayan
pesos, paid by Trigosul to the DNC as an advance on the fees for Trigosul’s operation in
the spectrum.'*> The Respondent also criticized the fact that, according to his own
testimony, Dr. Lapique based his report on instructions received from Italba. Uruguay also
indicated that Dr. Alberelli recognized that the funds with which he acquired Trigosul in
1999 came partially from his mother and, based on this contribution, 50% of the shares
were issued to Mrs. Caravetta, and the other 50% to himself, an acknowledgement that
contradicts his assertion that Italba funded Trigosul’s acquisition. Uruguay also submitted
that the fact that shares were never issued in favor of Italba is inconsistent with Dr.

Alberelli’s argument that Italba contributed capital in the subsequent years.'*°

Uruguay stated that its expert, Professor de Mello, asserted that Trigosul’s accounting
records are not clear either regarding the nature and scope of the contributions to Trigosul,
or regarding who made them.'3” Uruguay also highlighted the fact that Italba did not
formally complete the increase in the authorized capital by recording it with the National
Registry of Commerce and failed to issue new shares, a defect described as fatal to Italba’s

claim.

With respect to the control that Italba alleged to have over Trigosul, Uruguay repeated that
the alleged investment in Trigosul was made, and is owned, by Dr. Alberelli, who is Italian;
it is Dr. Alberelli who has control over Trigosul, not Italba.'*° According to the corporate
records, Dr. Alberelli and his mother are the true shareholders of Trigosul since, according
to the Shareholders’ Meeting and Board of Directors’ Minutes, it was they, who exercised

their voting rights (Uruguay cited minutes from 1996 to 2002).'4° Uruguay also submitted

that on 4 February 2011, Dr. Alberelli took the position of President of Trigosul, which
proves that he controlled that company in his personal capacity, and not as Italba’s
representative, and that he was the one who decided Trigosul’s business plan and had
control over the financing of Trigosul’s operations.'*! Uruguay concluded that Italba failed
to meet its burden of proof on the alleged control over Trigosul.'4”

(2) The Tribunal’s Analysis

191. The Tribunal will consider the rules applicable to a determination of the first objection

raised by the Respondent.
192. Article 1 of the Treaty defines the concept of “investor of a Party” as follows:

Investor of a Party means a Party or state enterprise thereof, or a
national or an enterprise of a Party, that attempts to make, is
making, or has made an investment in the territory of the other
Party; provided, however, that a natural person who is a dual
citizen shall be deemed to be exclusively a citizen of the State of his
or her dominant and effective citizenship.”

193. Regarding the definition of “investment,” the same Article of the Treaty reads as follows:

“Investment means every asset that an investor owns or controls
directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an investment,
including such characteristics as the commitment of capital or other
resources, the expectation of gain or profit, or the assumption of
risk. Forms that an investment may take include:

 

 

(a) an enterprise;

(b) shares, stock, and other forms of equity participation in an
enterprise;

(c) bonds, debentures, other debt instruments, and loans;

(d) futures, options, and other derivatives;

41 Respondent’s Rejoinder, {| 105.

'42 Respondent’s Rejoinder, {| 107.

49

(e) turnkey, construction, management, production, concession,
revenue sharing, and other similar contracts;

(f) intellectual property rights;

(g) licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar rights conferred
pursuant to domestic law; and

(h) other tangible or intangible, movable or immovable property,
and related property rights, such as leases, mortgages, liens, and
pledges” (emphasis added).

194. Article 1(g) of the Treaty includes two footnotes:

“Whether a particular type of license, authorization, permit, or
similar instrument (including a concession, to the extent that it has
the nature of such an instrument) has the characteristics of an
investment depends on such factors as the nature and extent of the
rights that the holder has under the law of the Party. Among the
licenses, authorizations, permits, and similar instruments that do
not have the characteristics of an investment are those that do not
create any rights protected under domestic law. For greater
certainty, the foregoing is without prejudice to whether any asset
associated with the license, authorization, permit, or similar
instrument has the characteristics of an investment.”

“The term “investment” does not include an order or judgment
entered in a judicial or administrative action.”

195. In addition, Article 1 of the Treaty defines the concept of a “covered investment” as

follows:

“with respect to a Party, an investment in its territory of an investor
of the other Party in existence as of the date of entry into force of
this Treaty or established, acquired, or expanded thereafter.”

196. Article 24 of the Treaty entitled “Submission of a Claim to Arbitration” provides the

following:

“7. In the event that a disputing party considers that an investment
dispute cannot be settled by consultation and negotiation:

50

the claimant, on its own behalf, may submit to arbitration under this
Section a claim:

that the respondent has breached:

an obligation under Articles 3 through 10;
an investment authorization, or

an investment agreement, and

that the claimant has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach; and

the claimant, on behalf of an enterprise of the respondent that is a
juridical person that the claimant owns or controls directly or
indirectly, may submit to arbitration under this Section a claim

that the respondent has breached:

an obligation under Articles 3 through 10;
an investment authorization, or

an investment agreement; and

that the enterprise has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach.

provided that a claimant may submit pursuant to subparagraph
(a)(i)(C) or (b)(i)(C) a claim for breach of an investment agreement
only if the subject matter of the claim and the claimed damages
directly relate to the covered investment that was established or
acquired, or sought to be established or acquired, in reliance on the
relevant investment agreement.

2. At least 90 days before submitting any claim to arbitration under
this Section, a claimant shall deliver to the respondent a written
notice of its intention to submit the claim to arbitration (‘notice of
intent’). The notice shall specify:

3. Provided that six months have elapsed since the events giving rise
to the claim, a claimant may submit a claim referred to in paragraph
I:

(a) under the ICSID Convention and the ICSID Rules of Procedure
for Arbitration Proceedings, provided that both the respondent and
the non-disputing Party are parties to the ICSID Convention;

(b) under the ICSID Additional Facility Rules, provided that either
the respondent or the non-disputing Party is a party to the ICSID
Convention;

(c) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules; or

(d) if the claimant and respondent agree, to any other arbitration
institution or under any other arbitration rules.

4. A claim shall be deemed submitted to arbitration under this
Section when the claimant’s notice of or request for arbitration
(‘notice of arbitration’):

(a) referred to in paragraph 1 of Article 36 of the ICSID Convention
is received by the Secretary-General;

(b) referred to in Article 2 of Schedule C of the ICSID Additional
Facility Rules is received by the Secretary-General;

(c) referred to in Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,
together with the statement of claim referred to in Article 18 of the
UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, are received by the respondent; or

(d) referred to under any arbitral institution or arbitral rules
selected under paragraph 3(d) is received by the respondent...”

197. The Parties agreed that the Treaty protects an investor who owns or controls the
investment.'*? The disagreement between them with respect to this matter is that the

Claimant submitted that it owns, and has controlled, Trigosul. On the contrary, the

Respondent submitted that Italba does not own or control Trigosul, since, in fact, it is Dr.

Alberelli, who owns and controls Trigosul, in his personal capacity.'4+

As stated in the preceding paragraphs, it is crucial to determine whether Italba is indeed a
shareholder of Trigosul and, failing that, if Italba controls Trigosul, either directly or

indirectly.

After resolution of those issues, the Tribunal must next determine whether Italba owned or

controlled the investment at the time of the alleged breach of the Treaty by the Respondent.

In the following paragraphs, the Tribunal will proceed to address the issue concerning the

ownership of Trigosul’s shares, and, subsequently, the issue regarding control over them.

a. Does Italba own Trigosul?

Article 3 of Trigosul’s Bylaws provides that the company’s share capital is represented by

“registered common shares.”!45

On the record, there are six share certificates of Trigosul dated 6 September 1996.
Certificates number 1, 2 and 3 are issued in the name of Ms. Carmela Caravetta Durante

and number 4, 5 and 6—in the name of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli.

Certificates 1 to 3 have on their reverse side an endorsement that reads: “On the date of
May 24, 2002, this is transferred to Dr. Gustavo Alberelli”; the three endorsements are
signed by “Carmela Caravetta”.!*° As already stated, certificates 4 to 6 were issued in the
name of Dr. Alberelli, on 6 September 1996. Certificates number 7 to 20 dated 30 June

1999 and also issued in the name of Dr. Alberelli, likewise appear on the record.'4”

Additionally, a two-page copy (the cover and folio number 2) of the book of Records of

Registered Securities belonging to Trigosul appears on the record.'** On folio 2 of the

book, there is a description of the certificates numbered | to 20, with the specification of
the “amount” that each of them represents and the certificate’s owner’s name. As already
stated, the first three are in the name of Ms. Caravetta and the rest are in the name of Dr.

Alberelli. There is no signature or date of any such entries.

On the record there are also copies of thirteen folios of the Shareholders’ Meeting and

Board of Directors’ Minutes Book,'*° that express the following:

(a) minutes numbered | are dated 2 October 1996; on it, there appears a call for an

Extraordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting, with an illegible signature;

(b) on the following folio, there appear other minutes (unnumbered) of a
Shareholders’ Meeting held on 10 October in that same year, which was chaired
by Mr. Daniel Pérez (a founding partner of the company, see paragraph 76
above). In those minutes, Mr. Luis Herbén was appointed Chairman of the first
“Board of Directors of the Company” [Tribunal’s Translation]; at the end of the
minutes, it is stated that shareholders Ms. Caravetta and Dr. Alberelli were in

attendance;

(c) on folio 4 of the aforementioned Shareholders’ Meeting and Board of Directors’
Minutes Book, there appear other minutes dated 10 October 1996, likewise not

numbered, in which Mr. Herbon accepted his appointment;

(d) on folio 5 there appears a text, handwritten and partially illegible, that
apparently refers to the Board of Directors’ Minutes of 2001; at the end, it states
the authorized share capital and, once again, it mentions Ms. Caravetta and Dr.

Alberelli as shareholders of the company;

(e) on folios 5 and 6, there appear the minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders’
Meeting held on 31 October 2001, which refers to a capital increase. They also

cite Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta as shareholders of the company;

(f) on folio 7, there appear the Board of Directors’ Minutes dated 30 September
2002, which refer to a call for an extraordinary shareholders’ meeting. On that
folio, there also appear the Minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting
held on 10 October 2002; once again it is mentioned that the shareholders are

Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta;

(g) on folio 8, there appear the Board of Directors’ Minutes dated 11 October 2002
in which a new Chairman was appointed (in the minutes, his name is illegible).
On that folio, there also appears the Board of Directors’ Minutes dated 30

October 2002 that refer to a call for a shareholders’ meeting;

(h) on folio 9, there appear the Minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders’ Meeting
held on 1 November 2002, in which shareholders Dr. Alberelli and Ms.

Caravetta once again appoint Mr. Herb6n as Chairman;

(i) on folio 10, there appear the minutes of a session of the Board of Directors held
on 2 November 2002 in which Mr. Herbén’s acceptance of his appointment is

included;

(j) on folio 11, there appear the minutes of a Board of Directors’ meeting held on 4

February 2011 to call for a Shareholders’ Meeting;

(k) on folio 12, there appear the Minutes of the Extraordinary Shareholders’
Meeting held on 4 February 2011, in which Dr. Alberelli was appointed as the

Board of Directors’ Chairman; and

(J) on folio 13, there appear the Minutes of a Board of Directors’ meeting of 4
February 2011, in which Mr. Herb6n resigned his office and Dr. Alberelli

accepted appointment in his place.

Following a careful review of the aforementioned minutes, the Tribunal notes that there
are only three folios on which shareholders of Trigosul are mentioned, (at letters (b), (d),
and (f) of the preceding paragraph) and Dr. Alberelli and Ms. Caravetta are the shareholders

so mentioned. Conversely, there is no mention of Italba as a shareholder; no reference to

55

207.

208.

209.

share endorsements or capital increases made by Italba, nor is there any suggestion that
Italba made any decisions on the different appointments of the Chairman of the Board of

Directors.

Having analyzed the first three share certificates endorsed to Dr. Alberelli, cited in
paragraph 203 above, the Tribunal confirms that none of them states the place of the
endorsement. On the date of the endorsement indicated therein (24 May 2002), Ms.
Caravetta and her son, Dr. Alberelli, were in Uruguay.'*° It follows that the law of Uruguay
should apply to determine the validity of the endorsement of shares in this Uruguayan

company.

Additionally, the only certificate containing an endorsement in favor of Italba is number 4.
It relates to 9,125 shares out of an aggregate amount of 182,500 and it reads: “On the date
of August 15, 2002, this is transferred to Italba Corp. (Miami FL. 33183 8540 Sw 132

court)” and below it reads: “Gustavo Alberelli Caravetta.”

During the Hearing, the Claimant’s counsel stressed that Mr. and Mrs. Alberelli are not
attorneys, and, for that reason, they failed to keep Italba and Trigosul’s documents in the
“best order.”!>! In the Tribunal’s view, the fact that these persons were not experienced in
managing corporate books does not justify the apparent inconsistencies in Trigosul’s
certificates and books. Dr. Alberelli is an experienced businessman who established Italba
in 1982;'>? Mr. Herbén presided over Trigosul during several years, he is a Uruguayan
national, a holder of a degree in accountancy and he has vast experience in business
administration.!*> It is not conceivable for this Tribunal to conclude that the lack of legal
knowledge on the part of Trigosul’s officers was the cause of their failure to record the

endorsement allegedly made in May and August 2002 in Trigosul’s books. Both Dr.

Alberelli and Mr. Herbon had enough experience and knowledge to handle the corporate

documents appropriately.
210. Article 305 of the Uruguayan Commercial Companies Act provides as follows:
“(Transferability). Shares shall be freely transferable.

Articles of incorporation may Set restrictions to the transferability
of registered shares, or book entry shares, provided that no such
restriction may amount to a prohibition on transfer. Any restriction
shall be stated in the certificate or in the Book-Entry Stock Register,
as applicable

The corporation shall be given written notice of the transfer of a
registered share or a book entry share or of the creation or transfer
of rights in rem over any such shares, and an entry shall be made
in the relevant stock register. These actions shall be enforceable
against the corporation and third parties from the time of said
registration.

Endorsable shares shall be transferred by an uninterrupted chain of
endorsements, and endorsees shall request the register to exercise
their rights.”'** (Emphasis added).

211. Based on Article 305 as set out above, the Tribunal concludes that for Dr. Alberelli to be
able to exercise the rights relating to Trigosul’s shares represented by certificates number
1, 2 and 3, he should have notified the endorsement to Trigosul and recorded it in the book
called the Registered Securities Ledger. Article 305 explicitly provides that “[t]he transfer
of registered shares ... shall be enforceable against the corporation and third parties from
the time of said registration.”

212. Considering the facts described and the content of the Commercial Companies Act, the
Tribunal concludes that, in Trigosul’s case, the legal requirements applicable to the
endorsement of Trigosul’s share certificates number 1, 2 and 3 carried out by Ms. Caravetta
in favor of Dr. Alberelli, in May 2002, were not respected. For this reason, the endorsement

fails to produce effects concerning Trigosul or third parties.

The Tribunal now turns to the endorsement of certificate number 4, representing 9,125
registered shares out of an aggregate amount of 182,500 of Trigosul’s shares, carried out
on 15 August 2002 by Dr. Alberelli. In that endorsement, there is no indication whatsoever
concerning the place where it was carried out; it was only stated, between parenthesis, the
registered address of Italba Corporation, which, as per its Articles of Incorporation, is:
“8540 S.W. 132th Court, Miami, Florida, 33183.”!°° The Tribunal considers that there is
no sufficient evidential basis to assert that the endorsement was actually made in Florida,
and that, as a consequence, the applicable law is that of the endorser’s domicile. The only
evidence on record on this matter are the statements made by Dr. Alberelli and his wife.
There being no reliable proof of the place in which that endorsement was carried out, the
laws of Uruguay, the country in which Trigosul was established and registered and where
it operates should apply to the validity of the endorsement. Nonetheless, the Tribunal will
also assess the validity of the endorsement by reference to the law of Florida, which is the

law that the Claimant maintained is applicable.'*°

As previously stated, Article 3 of the Trigosul Bylaws reads as follows: “Share transfers
shall be notified to the company and documented as provided in Law No. 16,060 ” '*7 (it
refers to Article 305 of the Commercial Companies Act transcribed at paragraph 210

above).

Under Article 316 of the Commercial Companies Act, the same rules applicable to

securities apply to share certificates (as Trigosul’s certificates), “...to the extent not

amended herein.”!°8

Law No. 14,701, which governs securities (“titulos valores”) in Uruguay (the “Securities

Law”), sets forth in Article 1 that “titulos valores” are “the documents necessary to

exercise the literal and autonomous right contained in them.” [Tribunal’s Translation]!*°

In addition, Article 32 of the aforementioned law provides the following for registered

securities:

“Registered securities shall be issued in the name of an ascertained
person, whose name shall be stated both in the body of the document
and in the entry made in the name of the securities issuer. Only a
person whose name appears both in the document and in the
register shall be recognized as a lawful holder.

The obligation to keep a non-bearer securities register shall not
apply in the case of bills of exchange, registered promissory notes
and checks.

The securities shall be presumed transferable unless the certificate

itself or the law provides that they must be recorded in the register

entry of issuance.” (Emphasis added)
The quoted rule is very clear: the legitimate holder of a registered certificate is the person
whose name appears in the certificate (principle of literalness) and on the records. The
register of shares is required to be kept by Article 305 of the Commercial Companies Act,

Article 32 of the Securities Law, and Article 3 of Trigosul’s Bylaws cited hereinabove.

As stated in paragraph 216 above, Article 1 of the Securities Law establishes that “titulos

valores” are “the documents necessary to exercise the literal and autonomous right
contained in them”. [Tribunal’s Translation] “Literalness” refers to the securities’
characteristic, according to which the content, scope and rules applicable to the exercise of

the right incorporated in the document are governed by what the document states.

On the basis of this principle, the Tribunal considers that the only endorsement Dr.
Alberelli made to Italba was that of Trigosul’s share certificate number 4. The other
certificates contain no endorsement whatsoever; consequently, the exercise of the rights

alleged by Italba is contrary to the principle of literalness and, therefore non-existent.

The Claimant’s assertion that endorsement of a certificate implicitly entails endorsement
of the remaining share certificates cannot be accepted. It is evident that each certificate

may be transferred individually; Dr. Alberelli himself understood as much when in May

222.

223.

224.

2002 he asked his mother, Ms. Caravetta, to endorse in favor of Dr. Alberelli each of the

three certificates issued in her name.!°

The Claimant stated that there was a transfer of Trigosul’s bundle of shares to Italba. That
statement is contrary to the provisions in the Uruguayan laws on securities and to the basic

principles regarding “titulos valores”.

The Tribunal also notes that, on the basis of the aforementioned rules, under Uruguayan
law, the endorsement in favor of Italba made by Dr. Gustavo Alberelli on 15 August 2002
of Trigosul’s share certificate number 4 was not perfected, since it was not recorded in the
book of Records of Registered Securities belonging to Trigosul. Therefore, it is not possible
to assert that Italba is the “lawful holder” of Trigosul share certificate number 4, either.
Much less is it the legitimate holder of Trigosul’s remaining share certificates, none of

which was endorsed in favor of Italba.

The Claimant sought to substantiate its position in the following terms: “Under Uruguayan
domestic corporate law, a party can demonstrate ownership in one of three ways: (a) by
endorsing a stock certificate with a transfer note, delivering the certificates to the
transferee, and/or registering the transfer in the company’s stock ledger; (b) in the absence
of a formal transfer of shares, by demonstrating that, as a matter of “economic reality,” the
party owned and acted as the owner of the company; and (c) by making capital
contributions to the company. Here, pursuant to the ‘economic reality’ theory, Italba is the

sole owner of Trigosul.”!°!

The Tribunal considers that the first way to demonstrate ownership under Uruguayan law
mentioned in the above paragraph is not applicable to this case. It is not a matter of
endorsing “a share certificate” with a “transfer note” [Tribunal’s Translation]. As was
stated above, Article 305 of the Commercial Companies Act is very clear: “The transfer of
registered shares...shall be notified to the company in writing and recorded in the

corresponding stock ledgers. They shall produce effects concerning the company and third

228.

parties at the time when so recorded” (emphasis added). Under Uruguayan law, to transfer
a certificate it is imperative to endorse it, hand it over to the acquirer, notify the company

in writing and record the endorsement in the company’s stock ledger.

When explaining its position in respect of the second criterion (see paragraph 223 above)
Italba stated: “in the absence of a formal transfer of shares, [a party may demonstrate] that,
as a matter of ‘economic reality,’ the party owned and acted as the owner of the company.”
In paragraphs 226 to 235, the Tribunal considers this second criterion; in paragraph 236, it

addresses the third.

Italba asserted, on the basis of the opinion of its expert, Dr. Lapique, that formalities in
closely held corporations may be more “relaxed” and, because of this, the reality should be
considered: “... whether the parent company understood itself to be the owner of the
subsidiary, acted in a manner consistent with ownership, and held itself out to third parties
as the owner.”'®? According to the Claimant, Italba made all of Trigosul’s business
decisions, developed its business plan, commissioned studies on potential negotiations,
sought out partners, “contributed the overwhelming majority of Trigosul’s share capital,”
funded Trigosul’s operations, issued checks on a regular basis to cover Trigosul’s expenses

and, in addition, routinely represented to third parties that it owned Trigosul.'®
Italba’s expert, Dr. Lapique further asserted:

“Application of the predominance of reality over form is expressly
provided for in corporate matters in Article 189 of the LSC, which
enshrines the theory of disregard. Although that theory is for
piercing the corporate veil to reach the shareholders behind it in
cases of fraudulent evasion of the law, violation of public order, etc.
which would not be applicable in this case, it establishes that reality
prevails over form.”'*

Uruguay’s expert, Professor de Mello, stated: “... this principle [referring to the theory of

disregard mentioned by Dr. Lapique] governs in commercial law, Lapique cites the

12 Claimant’s Reply, § 81; Dr. Luis Lapique’s Report, 12 May 2017, pages 4, 14, 17 and 18.

provisions of the [Commercial Companies Act] on the principle of the ‘disregard of the
legal personality’ of commercial companies, without taking into account that it is applied
only to reject the legal personality of corporations (not to recognize the status of
shareholder), in cases of fraud committed through said personality, and that it has limited

scope.”!6

229. Article 189 of the Commercial Companies Act, found in section XV entitled “On the

Unenforceability of the Legal Personality”, sets forth the following:

“(Admissibility). A company’s status as a legal person may be
rendered unenforceable where it is used in evasion of the law to
violate public order, or to defraud and to the detriment of the rights
of members, shareholders or third parties.

Reliable proof of the actual use of the business company as a legal
instrument to achieve said purposes shall be required.

Where the unenforceability of the company’s legal status is sought

through a legal action, ordinary proceedings shall be followed.”'°°
230. It is obvious that Article 189 regulates situations that are completely different from those
discussed in connection with the ownership of Trigosul’s shares. None of the assumptions
of fact contained therein arises in this case, which is why this Article may not be relied
upon in support of Italba’s position that, as Trigosul’s shares were neither endorsed nor
delivered, the “predominance of reality” over form should apply in order to conclude that

Italba is the owner of those shares.

231. Italba adduced judgment 90/2009'® issued by the “7ribunal de Apelaciones en lo Civil,
Primer Turno” into the record of the case. In the explanation in footnote 289 of its Reply,
it asserted that the Tribunal de Apelaciones “appl[{ies] economic reality doctrine to find
standing to sue in plaintiffs’ favor, because minutes of meetings established that plaintiffs

had participated in shareholders’ meetings, despite the fact that plaintiffs were not

registered as shareholders in the bank’s books and records.”'®* The Tribunal disagrees with

this commentary on the judgment.

The judgment analyses neither Article 189 nor the “disregard” or “economic reality”
theory. It includes none of the criteria upon which Italba purports to rely as a basis for its

position in the instant case.

Article 319 of the Commercial Companies Act sets out the “fundamental” and “essential”

rights of shareholders:
“(1) To participate in and vote at shareholders’ meetings.

(2) To share in corporate profits and the balance of liquidation, in
the event of dissolution of the company.

(3) To oversee the management of corporate business.

(4) To have a preemptive right to subscribe for shares of stock,
convertible profit shares, and convertible debentures.

(5) To reassign as provided by law.

These rights may only be qualified, limited or rendered of no effect
when expressly authorized by law.” [Tribunal’s Translation]

Italba participated in none of the shareholders’ meetings held, and, thus, did not exercise
its right to vote, as recorded in Trigosul’s corporate documents. There is no evidence that

it shared in Trigosul’s profits or losses. There is no reference to Italba somehow overseeing

the management of Trigosul’s business.

Therefore, the Tribunal finds that there is no evidence that Italba exercised the rights that
would have been available to it if it had actually been a shareholder of Trigosul. Nor can

the Tribunal apply the principle of disregard of the legal personality set forth in Article 189

of the Commercial Companies Act to completely different situations such as to support

Italba’s alleged ownership of Trigosul’s shares.

The third criterion mentioned by the Claimant (at paragraph 223 above) is the capital
contribution it claims to have made to Trigosul. As evidence of such contribution, Italba
submitted that, in early 2001, it contributed to Trigosul the amount of 632,674 Uruguayan
pesos.'® Italba stated: “In recognition of Italba’s capital contribution, an extraordinary
meeting of Trigosul’s shareholders later that year accordingly increased the authorized
capital of the company from 182,500 to 690,000 Uruguayan pesos. Thus, Italba contributed
92.04% of Trigosul’s share capital.”!”° In its Post-Hearing Brief, Italba relied upon the
opinion of Dr. Lapique, who also “found that Italba contributed 92.04% of Trigosul’s share

capital.”!7!

There is no evidence on the record that such contribution was made by Italba. The only
conclusion available to the Tribunal is that the capital contribution mentioned in the Book
of Shareholders and Directors Meetings was made by Dr. Alberelli and his mother, Ms.
Caravetta, as recorded in the books. Nor does the company’s accounting book referred to

as a “Diary” indicate that Italba made capital contributions to Trigosul.

At the Hearing, Uruguay asserted: “...the answer to the question who contributed
significant capital to Trigosul is no one. Further, these payments to Trigosul were recorded,
all of them, as having been made in cash. Thus, there is no documentary record of the
source of the funds.”!”? Uruguay also stated that Dr. Lapique had admitted that he had acted

on Italba’s instructions in connection with its alleged contribution to Trigosul.'?

Indeed, Dr. Lapique admitted acting on the basis of the information provided by Italba

relating to the contributions it claimed to have made to Trigosul. He stated:

b) Italba Corp. delivered funds to Trigosul’s directors so that the
directors would deliver them to Trigosul.

c) The Company and its directors recognize Italba Corp. as
shareholder.

According to the instructions received, the Contributions for future
paid-in capital were made by Italba Corp., who is the one that has
financed Trigosul’s operations from its inception to date.”'™
(Emphasis added)

The foregoing was confirmed by the Claimant itself in its Post-Hearing Brief. When
commenting on Uruguay’s criticism of Dr. Lapique’s report, it stated that “[t]his is a bizarre

criticism to make of an expert witness who, by definition, ought not to have firsthand

knowledge of the facts” (italics in the original).!75

Nor is there any evidence on record (a check, a wire transfer or another commercial
instrument) in support of the assertion that Italba contributed the “overwhelming majority”
of Trigosul’s share capital. The truth is that there is no record of any capital contribution

from Italba to Trigosul.

The Tribunal finds that, on the basis of the capital contribution criterion, Italba cannot be

said to be a shareholder of Trigosul.

As indicated in paragraph 213, the Tribunal shall now proceed to analyze Italba’s
arguments on the ownership of the share certificates of Trigosul, in accordance with the

laws of the State of Florida.

The Claimant alleged that, since Dr. Alberelli was in Florida when he endorsed Trigosul’s

shares on 15 August 2002, such transfer is governed by Florida law.'’® As stated in

"4 Report of Dr. Luis Lapique, 12 May 2017, pages 2 and 7.

paragraph 213, the Tribunal considers that there is no sufficient evidential basis to assert
that the endorsement was actually made in Florida, and that, as a consequence, the
applicable law is that of the endorser’s domicile. The only evidence on record on this matter

are the statements made by Dr. Alberelli and his wife.!””

The second criterion put forward by the Claimant in support of its argument that Florida
law should apply to this case is based on Article 30 of the Treaty, which refers to the
applicable rules of international law. In relation to this criterion, Italba cited Article 2398
of the Civil Code of Uruguay, which provides that “[a]ssets, whatever their nature, are
exclusively governed by the law of the place where they are, in terms of their quality, their
possession, their absolute or relative transfer, and all in rem relationships to which they

may be subject.”!”8 [Tribunal’s Translation]

The Claimant submitted: “Here, the share certificates of Trigosul were located in Florida
and the act that transferred ownership of those shares from Dr. Alberelli to Italba occurred
in Florida. Thus, Florida law governs Trigosul’s ownership.”!”? In addition, based on the
law of that State, Italba reiterated that Dr. Alberelli endorsed the bundle of all of Trigosul’s
stock certificates and deposited them in a safety deposit box, where he typically kept key
documents belonging to Italba, in his and his wife’s name;!*° according to Italba and Dr.

Alberelli, the certificates were delivered to Italba, and, thus, the transfer was completed.

Italba concluded that, “[u]nder Florida law, a transfer of shares is complete when shares
are ‘delivered’ to the transferee, i.e., the transferee acquires possession of the stock
certificates.” In the footnote, it cited “Fla. Stat. § 678.3011(1)(a) (1997) (C-220) (“Delivery
of a certificated security to a purchaser occurs when . . . the purchaser acquires possession

of the security certificate.”); see also, e.g., Tanner v. Robinson, 411 So. 2d 240, 242 (Fla.

Dist. Ct. App. 1982) (C-221) (“transfer of a gift of stock effective upon actual or

constructive delivery of the shares).”!*!

In Tanner v. Robinson, the District Court of Appeal of Florida stated: “As such, we hold
that an inter vivos transfer by gift of any interest in securities is accomplished by either
actual or constructive delivery of the same, where donative intent is also present, and where

acceptance by the donee may be presumed or is proven directly....”!°?

Mr. Conti, expert for Uruguay, also made reference in his report to the requirements laid
down by Tanner v. Robinson (delivery, intent and acceptance) although, to him, that case
is governed by Florida case law rather than by Florida statute law'*?; furthermore,

according to Mr. Conti, the requirements are “simultaneous.”!**

In the Tribunal’s opinion, no intent to endorse all the share certificates from Trigosul to
Italba has been shown. Clearly, the existence of such intent may not be assumed, as the
only certificate allegedly endorsed is number 4. Such intent is not recorded in the
company’s books either. There is, furthermore, no evidence of the delivery of the shares
and Italba’s subsequent exercise of rights as a shareholder on the record; there is also
nothing that shows Italba’s exercise of its purported rights as a shareholder and owner of
the shares represented by certificate 4, let alone those represented by the other certificates.
As stated above, Italba was not shown to have participated in any Shareholders’ Meeting
or to have shared in Trigosul’s profits or losses. Nor was the purported acceptance recorded
in Trigosul’s and Italba’s books, it being merely supported by the statements made by Dr.
Alberelli.

In its Post-Hearing Brief, Italba referred to a case appended to Mr. Conti’s Report (Estate
of Maxcy v. Commissioner of Internal Revenue), and assert that the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit “... upheld the validity under Florida law of a gift of shares in a close
corporation notwithstanding the U.S. Internal Revenue Service’s argument that the gift had
not been perfected by physical delivery... Where the government could raise no alternative
theory of the donor’s intent, the Court dismissed insistence on physical delivery as
‘tokenism in which we do not think the courts of Florida would indulge’ and found

‘constructive’ delivery sufficient.”!*>

In the Tribunal’s view, the case cited by Italba refers to circumstances that are totally
different from those of the present case. In Estate of Maxcy, the donor of the company’s
shares entered the donation of shares in the corporate records and reported it in its income
tax returns; it also issued new share certificates and asked the company secretary to issue
such certificates in the name of the donees. One of the certificates was not personally
delivered to the donee but kept in a safety deposit box of the company; however, it was
shown that the donee had access to the box, both in law and in fact. For these reasons, the
Court in that case was able to establish, by reference to cogent evidence, the donor’s intent
and the acts it performed in order to express it. This Tribunal concludes that there is no

such evidence in the present case.

As stated above (paragraph 213), the Tribunal is certain that this matter should be resolved
in accordance with the laws of Uruguay, the only law applicable to this case. Nonetheless,
in order to consider the entirety of the Claimant’s arguments the Tribunal also analyzed the
laws of the State of Florida and concluded that Italba was not the owner of Trigosul under
either system of law. The Tribunal thus analyses in the following section Italba’s allegation

that it controls Trigosul.

b. Does Italba Corporation control Trigosul?

The definition of “investment” in Article 1 of the Treaty refers to “every asset that an

investor owns or controls, directly or indirectly, that has the characteristics of an

investment”. (emphasis added) The term “control” is not defined in the Treaty. The
omission of a definition for “control” accords with long-standing U.S. practice, reflecting
the fact that determinations as to whether an investor controls an enterprise will involve

factual situations that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

Italba argued, for the purposes of Article 1 of the Treaty, that it controls Trigosul and
asserted, based on Messrs. Alberelli’s and Herbon’s statements and the documents to be
cited below, that: (a) it made business decisions for Trigosul; (b) “contributed the vast
majority of Trigosul’s share capital”; (c) funded Trigosul’s operations; and (d) represented

to third parties that it was the owner of Trigosul.'*°

The Claimant submitted several documents in support of its assertion that it made business
decisions for Trigosul. The Tribunal addresses each of them and states its conclusion once

it has reviewed them all:

(a) Proposal for a Banking Communication Network of 6 January 1999.'87 This
document makes no reference to Trigosul; moreover, it is a proposal made by

ETS and Italba Telecom S.A., and not by Italba Corporation.

(b) “Site Survey Report: Uruguay, Prime Wave Communication” of 15 October

2001.'** The Report makes no reference to Trigosul or Italba.

(c) Agreement with WorldStar Communications Corp. for the purpose of creating
a Joint Venture for a Telecommunications Project in Uruguay of July 2009.!8°
This document makes no reference to Trigosul; it concerns a company referred

to as Sumitel, which appears to have licenses in Uruguay.

realize the full value of its investment in Trigosul”; Italba “... acted as the negotiating and
contracting party, and its contribution to the joint venture partnerships included the use of
Trigosul’s license—which Italba was able to contribute because it owned Trigosul.”!°? To

such effect, Italba made reference to the following businesses:

(a) Negotiations with Eastern Pacific Trust: letter of intent of 3 February 2002 and
Co-Investment Agreement of 14 June 2002 (cited in paragraph 256 (d)
above).'> Regarding the letter of intent, the Tribunal notes that it is not signed
and mentions Trigosul only once. Furthermore, it is addressed to Italba
Telecommunications Group, not Italba Corporation. The Claimant also
submitted the statement of Mr. Alan Cherp, director of InterAmerican Telco
Systems. He told the Tribunal that he had met Dr. Alberelli in 2002, at a
telecommunications event where they discussed business in Uruguay through

C-166; Statement of Dr. Gustavo Alberelli, 12 May 2017, | 16; Statement of Mr. Luis Herbén, 12 May 2017, § 14;

The documents and statements mentioned above cannot support a conclusion that Italba
communicated or represented to the interested parties that it was negotiating contracts for
its purported subsidiary, Trigosul, or that it controlled it. Moreover, the Tribunal notes that

some of the witness statements submitted by Italba are inconsistent with the contents of the

documents only make reference to Trigosul, not Italba, so that it is impossible

to determine who started the alleged negotiation.

documentary evidence filed by that Party.

By virtue of the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal finds that the Claimant has failed to prove

that it made business decisions for Trigosul.

As to Italba’s alleged capital contributions to Trigosul, the Claimant submitted the

following documents:

(a)

(b)

Italba’s Commercial Checking Bank Account Statement (from 1 to 28
February 2001).7!> By means of this document, Italba purported to prove that
it wired USD 35,000 to Trigosul as a reimbursement of expenses. The Tribunal
notes that the transfer was made by the Claimant to Mr. Luis Herbon, and that,
in footnote 159 of its Reply Memorial, Italba stated: “The wire transfer was
made to Luis Herbon’s account at Indumex, a Uruguayan financial services
company that facilitates international money transfers.” The purpose of such
transfer is not mentioned in the case record, and the Claimant has submitted no

evidence that it was actually a capital contribution from Italba to Trigosul.

Contribution of 632,674 Uruguayan pesos that Trigosul paid to DNC as an
advance on the first two years of fees for Trigosul’s operation in the
spectrum.?!® The Tribunal has confirmed that Trigosul’s accounting book

called “Diary” makes reference to such amount, but there is no record

whatsoever of the source of the contribution necessary to enable Trigosul to

make the relevant payment to DNC.

261. The Tribunal finds that Italba has submitted no evidence that it made capital contributions

to Trigosul.

262. Italba’s third argument is that it funded Trigosul’s operations. Accordingly, Italba
submitted the following documents on three issues: purchase of equipment, drawing

checks, and purchase of bonds:

(a) Equipment: fax to Italba Group (to the attention of Mr. Albert Jansenson) from
Mr. Daniel V. de los Santos of L-3 Communications of 8 May 2001; Quotation
No. 2501 from Wavelynx International Inc. of 11 January 2000; “Seller’s
Agreement” between Italba Corporation and Wavelynx International Inc. of 27
February 2000; and Invoice No. 107 from StarMesh Technologies to Italba of
12 June 20077!’ (according to Italba, the equipment was approved by
URSEC).?!® The fax includes a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) which
mentions Trigosul as a subsidiary of Italba, but neither the fax nor the MOU
were signed. The quotation refers to equipment for Italba, but it was not shown
that Italba purchased such equipment for Trigosul. The “Seller’s Agreement”
makes no reference to Trigosul. Invoice No. 107 indicates that the equipment
would be shipped to Miami; there is no evidence of its subsequent shipping to
Trigosul. Although Italba stated that such equipment was later approved by
URSEC, the Tribunal reviewed the approval submitted, which includes neither
a list, nor a description of the equipment, and, thus, does not confirm that it is
the same equipment as that mentioned by the Claimant. Italba also cited
UMDN-URSEC Resolution of 10 September 2002, which approved the

payment for Trigosul’s equipment, purchased by Italba.?!? Such resolution

concerns a settlement agreement reached before the “Juzgado de Conciliacién
del 2do Turno”, between Trigosul, the Uruguay Ministry of Defense and
URSEC (due to the change of frequencies by means of Decree 282/2000 (see
paragraphs 85 and 88 above)). As explained above, Trigosul alleged that, in
view of the frequencies it had been allocated prior to such Decree, it purchased
equipment it would not be able to use with the new frequencies. A line of the
Resolution reads “ITALBA invoice for the purchase of radios: US $25,964.”
The Tribunal cannot interpret this mere reference to Italba as evidence of a

contribution from Italba to Trigosul through delivery of equipment.

(b) Writing of checks: Italba alleges that it regularly drew checks to cover
Trigosul’s expenses; in support of such assertion, it submitted two checks
(dated 7 June 2005 and 13 May 2006 respectively).?”° It also made reference
to the accounting books of Trigosul where the cash allegedly contributed by
Italba would be recorded as “contribution by directors.”??! One of the checks
mentioned by Italba was drawn to “Cash”, while the other was drawn in favor
of Dr. Alberelli. No relationship between Italba and Trigosul may be derived
from such evidence. As to accounting records, the Tribunal cannot construe the
expression “contribution by directors” as a contribution made by Italba; that

would be an unfounded and forced interpretation of the text.

USD 25,000 to purchase Uruguayan bonds,*** and that, two years later, on
Italba’s instructions, Mr. Herbon sold those bonds and used the money to cover

directors” but does not state that the contributions were made by Italba.
Therefore, the Tribunal cannot accept that the Claimant has proven that the
money related to the checks and bonds was a contribution from Italba to
Trigosul. Rather, the evidence mentioned in this paragraph establishes that Dr.

Alberelli covered Trigosul’s expenses.

The evidence submitted by the Claimant having been carefully examined, the Tribunal
finds that there is no evidence on the record to conclude that Italba was actually controlling

Trigosul.

The Claimant cited several ICSID awards in support of its argument that, in order to
analyze the jurisdiction of the Tribunal, the notion of control over a company is flexible
and broad, rather than strict. The Tribunal considers that, given that there is no evidence of
Italba’s control over Trigosul in any of the areas mentioned by Italba (negotiation of
contracts, capital contributions, and funding of transactions), the discussion and analysis

of such awards, though very interesting, would be futile for the purposes of this Award.

The Tribunal having thoroughly analyzed the Parties’ positions and the evidence on which
they relied in support thereof, on the basis of the statements made by the Parties and the

evidence on record, the next section contains a summary of the Tribunal’s findings.

(3) The Tribunal’s Findings

In preparation for the investment to be made in Uruguay, Dr. Alberelli acquired a company
which had already been incorporated and which was then named Trigosul (according to
Dr. Alberelli, although the first six certificates are dated 1996, he actually acquired
Trigosul in 1999). Trigosul’s new shareholders (Dr. Alberelli and his mother, Ms. Carmela
Caravetta) appointed Mr. Luis Herbon as Chairman of the Board of Directors (see
paragraphs 76, 78 and 79 of this Award; Book of Shareholders and Directors Meetings,
page 3, C-164).

In January 1997, the MDN authorized Dr. Alberelli to provide wireless services in Uruguay
(see paragraph 81 above).

In August 1997, the DNC allocated to Dr. Alberelli the radio channels of some frequencies

(see paragraph 82 above).

In February 2000, and in response to Dr. Alberelli’s request to the DNC, the MDN

transferred to Trigosul the authorization granted to Dr. Alberelli (paragraph 84 above).

The Treaty between the United States of America and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay
Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment was entered into

on 4 November 2005 and came into force on 1 November 2006 (see paragraph 94 above).

On account of Trigosul’s various problems with the Uruguayan telecommunications
authorities, in February 2016, Italba filed this claim for arbitration against Uruguay before

ICSID (see paragraph 6 above).

Dr. Alberelli cannot be considered as an investor under the ICSID Convention or this
Treaty as he is a national of Italy, not the United States, which is a fundamental requirement
to enjoy the protection of the Treaty. Trigosul being a Uruguayan company, could not
qualify as an investor either in the circumstances of this case (see paragraphs 75 and 76

above).

The Claimant has asserted that Italba Corporation, a company incorporated under the laws
of the State of Florida, United States of America, is a qualified investor under the ICSID
Convention and the Treaty. However, Trigosul’s corporate documents contain no

indication that Italba was a shareholder of Trigosul.

Italba retained Dr. Luis Lapique, who issued a report admitting that “... a detailed analysis
of Trigosul’s different corporate books and the content of their records, as well as the shares
issued by Trigosul,” evidenced that “...[s]ome records have not been kept and certain
shares have not been issued,” and “...[rJecords have been kept incorrectly and shares have
been issued incorrectly.” Nevertheless, Dr. Lapique, in support of the hypothesis that Italba

owned Trigosul, contended that, in “...closely held corporations, there are cases in which

78

275.

276.

277.

278.

279.

280.

the corporate books and records are relegated to second place and formalities are not

observed.”?3

Unable to find support in Trigosul’s accounting books and records, the Claimant purported

to show that Italba was the owner of Trigosul by means of Trigosul’s share certificates.

Given that only one of Trigosul’s share certificates (number 4) was endorsed in favor of
Italba, the Claimant asserted the theory that the endorsement of one certificate entailed the

endorsement of all others (see paragraph 169 above).

In order to show that he had delivered the share certificates to Italba, Dr. Alberelli asserted
that the transfer occurred when he placed all the certificates of Trigosul in a safety deposit
box where, in his own words, he and his wife would keep Italba’s documents (see
paragraph 169 above). The Claimant thus purported to meet the second fundamental

requirement to complete the transfer of Trigosul’s share certificates.

As the Tribunal has noted at paragraph 226 above, the Claimant sought to explain the
failure to record the share transfer on the basis of Dr. Lapique’s opinion that, in closely
held corporations, corporate records were often relegated to second place, and that, in this
particular case, such defects were due to “the lack of knowledge of the legal or accounting

advisors of the company.”?*4

This assertion is difficult to accept, as Dr. Alberelli was an experienced businessman, who,
moreover, relied on the services of Mr. Herbon, a national of Uruguay, who was a Certified

Public Accountant with experience in running his own and third-party businesses.??°

The transfer of Trigosul’s shares (by means of certificate number 4) from Dr. Alberelli to

Italba was never made as it did not satisfy the requirements set forth in Article 305 of the

23 Dr, Luis Lapique’ Report, 12 May 2017, page 5.

Commercial Companies Act.??° It follows that this could not have resulted in the transfer

of the other share certificates of Trigosul either, which were not even endorsed to Italba.

Italba asserted (based on the report of its expert, Dr. Lapique) that what matters is not form
(notwithstanding the express provisions of the laws of Uruguay), but “economic reality.”
In support of this theory, it relied upon Article 189 of the Commercial Companies Act (see
paragraph 227 above), which, in cases of fraud and violation of public order (e.g., tax
evasion), provides that legal personality may be disregarded (known as “piercing the
corporate veil” in other legal systems) so as to determine who actually owns the shares.
Pursuant to this Article, the Claimant contended that Italba was the true owner of Trigosul’s
shares. The Claimant’s argument cannot be accepted, as the legal basis on which it relies
(Article 189 of the Commercial Companies Act) regulates legal situations other than those
of this case, and, thus, does not apply here. Furthermore, this argument is contrary to the
Claimant’s contention in paragraph 97 of its Reply Memorial that the corporate veil should

not be pierced (see paragraph 179 above).

No matter how much the corporate veil could be pierced or Trigosul’s legal personality be
disregarded, the truth is that Dr. Alberelli and his family still appeared as the sole owners

of Trigosul’s shares.

The Claimant then purported to assert that Italba had provided Trigosul with the funds
necessary for its operation (see paragraph 226 above). This argument failed because it was
unsupported by any cogent evidence. Instead, the evidence submitted by Italba rather
confirmed that it was Dr. Alberelli who had made the capital contributions necessary for

Trigosul’s operation.

In the alternative, the Claimant argued that it controlled Trigosul even if the Tribunal were
to find that it did not own it. For such purposes, Italba submitted letters and other
documents, most of which were inapposite or concerned different situations. This evidence

simply confirmed that it was Dr. Alberelli who controlled Trigosul and not Italba.

Given its finding that Italba neither owns, nor controls Trigosul, for the purposes of Articles
1 and 24 of the Treaty and Article 25 of the ICSID Convention, the Tribunal declares that
it has no jurisdiction to settle the dispute between Italba Corporation and the Oriental

Republic of Uruguay and it so states in the dispositif.

As the Tribunal has upheld the Respondent’s first objection on jurisdiction, the Tribunal
does not deem it necessary to rule upon the other jurisdictional objections raised by the

Respondent.

COSTS
Claimant’s Cost Submissions

In its submissions on costs, the Claimant argues that the Respondent should bear all the
costs and expenses of these proceedings. The Claimant’s total costs and expenses incurred
in connection with this arbitration amount to USD 8,923,882.28 22” and are broken down
as follows: (a) USD 7,424,562.89 in respect of Italba’s counsel fees and expenses, (b)
USD 1,022,151.67 in respect of experts’ fees and expenses, (c) USD 2,167.72 in respect
of representatives’ and witnesses’ expenses, (d) the ICSID lodging fee of USD 25,000, and
(e) USD 450,000 in respect of advances towards the Tribunal’s fees and expenses and
ICSID’s administrative fees. In addition, the Claimant seeks compound interest on any
damages and costs calculated annually at a commercial rate from the date of the Award

until the date of payment by Uruguay.”

The Claimant argues that an award on costs to the Claimant is “uniquely appropriate” in
this case because Italba was forced to assert its rights under the Treaty only as a result of
Uruguay’s failure to comply with the “Tribunal de lo Contencioso Administrativo”

229

judgment, destroying the value of Italba’s investment in breach of the Treaty.*”

Furthermore, Uruguay’s abusive conduct in the context of this dispute “greatly aggravated

the harm inflicted by Uruguay’s breaches of the Treaty as well as the costs of this

arbitration.”?°°

Respondent’s Cost Submissions

In its submissions on costs, the Respondent submits that the Claimant should bear all the
costs and expenses of these proceedings. The Respondent’s total costs and expenses

231 and are broken

incurred in connection with this arbitration amount to USD 6,002,836.75,
down as follows: (a) USD 4,151,031.90 in respect of Uruguay’s counsel’s fees, (b) USD
1,401,804.85 in respect of experts’ fees and expenses, and administrative expenses, and (d)
USD 450,000 in respect of advances toward the Tribunal’s fees and expenses, and ICSID’s
administrative fees. In addition, the Respondent seeks the Tribunal to order the Claimant
to pay interest at the LIBOR rate applicable to one-year deposits in U.S. dollars in effect
on the date on which the Award is issued, plus 4%, accruing 60 days after the Parties are

served notice of the Award, compounded semi-annually.?*?

The Respondent argues that an award on costs to Uruguay is justified in this case because
(a) Italba claimed the existence of jurisdiction without having legal standing to do so,?*
(b) Italba presented frivolous claims as to jurisdiction, merits and damages,”** and (c)
throughout these proceedings, Italba has acted in bad faith to interfere with the arbitral
process, using “forged and suspect documents as supposed evidence in support of its

arguments” in a “deliberate attempt to obscure the facts and mislead the Tribunal.”?*>
The Tribunal’s Decision on Costs

“costs follow the event”) should guide the allocation of costs in this arbitration. Each

294. Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention provides:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as
the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses incurred by the
parties in connection with the proceedings, and shall decide how
and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members
of the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the
Centre shall be paid. Such decision shall form part of the award.

295. This provision gives the Tribunal discretion to allocate all costs of the arbitration between

the Parties, including by ordering the losing Party to bear in full the costs of the arbitration

and the legal fees and expenses incurred by both Parties.

The Tribunal has concluded that it has no jurisdiction over Italba’s claims because the
Claimant has failed to prove that Italba owns or controls Trigosul.”? As explained above,
Dr. Alberelli’s endorsement of Trigosul’s share certificates in favor of Italba was not in
conformity with the applicable legal requirements and, therefore, failed to produce effects
concerning Trigosul or third parties.“° Moreover, no evidence was adduced that Italba
shared in Trigosul’s profits or losses, that Italba was overseeing the management of
Trigosul’s business, or that Italba exercised the rights that would have been available to it
if it had actually been a shareholder of Trigosul.”*! Finally, the Claimant failed to prove
that Italba communicated or represented to interested parties that it was negotiating

contracts for Trigosul or that it controlled it.24”

In view of the above, the Tribunal finds that the application of the ‘loser pays’ principle is
appropriate. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that the Claimant shall bear its legal fees
and expenses in full, as well as the costs of the arbitration. The Claimant shall also
reimburse the Respondent’s legal and expert fees and expenses in the amounts requested,”
which the Tribunal finds to be reasonable in view of the Claimant’s costs, the duration of
the proceeding and the complexity of the issues addressed, regarding not only jurisdiction

but also merits and quantum.

Accordingly, the Tribunal orders the Claimant to pay the Respondent the amount of USD
332,507.42 for the expended portion of Uruguay’s advances to ICSID and USD

5,552,836.75 to cover Uruguay’s legal and expert fees and administrative expenses.

The Tribunal notes that the Respondent has requested that it be granted interest on any
costs awarded to it. Having considered the circumstances of this arbitration proceeding

and the evidence adduced by the Parties, the Tribunal has not found sufficient basis to grant

interest on the costs awarded to the Respondent. Accordingly, the Respondent’s request

for interest on costs is denied.

DECISION
For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal decides:

(a) To uphold the objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction raised by the Oriental Republic
of Uruguay on the grounds that Italba Corporation neither owns nor controls Trigosul
S.A., such that Italba Corporation is not an investor for the purposes of Articles 1 and
24 of the Treaty between the United States of America and the Oriental Republic of
Uruguay Concerning the Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of Investment and

Article 25 of the ICSID Convention.
(b) To declare that the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to settle the dispute.

(c) To reject the Claimant’s request that the Tribunal disregard the expert report of

Professor Eugenio Xavier de Mello Ferrand.

(d) To order the Claimant to pay to the Respondent the entirety of the costs of this
arbitration, including the fees and expenses of the Tribunal, ICSID’s administrative
fees and direct expenses, as well as the Respondent’s legal and expert fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this arbitration, assessed in the amount of

USD 5,885,344.17.

(e) All other requests for relief are dismissed.
