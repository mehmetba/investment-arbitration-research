Summary of the Dispute

28. Petitioners began investigating investment opportunities in Kazakhstan in
1999. Petitioners’ investments in Kazakhstan’s natural hydrocarbon resources sector began with
their purchase of controlling shares of two Kazakh companies, Kazpolmunay LLP (“KPM”) and
Tolkynneftagaz LLP (“TNG”).

29. On December 9, 1999, Petitioner Ascom purchased a 62% share in KPM,
a closed joint stock company, which owned the subsoil use rights to the Borankol oil field
pursuant to Contract 305 on Exploration and Extraction of Hydrocarbons at the “Borankol”
deposit (Mangystau Oblast), executed between the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on
Investments and KPM, and dated 30 March 1999.

30. On May 17, 2000, Petitioners’ acquired a 75% interest in TNG, a Kazakh
company that owned the subsoil use rights to the Tolkyn gas field and the Tabyl exploration
block (“Tabyl Block”) pursuant to Contracts 210 and 302 on Exploration and Extraction of
Hydrocarbons at the “Tolkyn” deposit and the Tabyl Block (Mangystau Oblast), executed
between the Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan on Investments and TNG, and dated 12

August and 31 July 1998, respectively.

Case 1:14-cv-00175 Document 1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 8 of 12

31. Through a series of subsequent transactions, Ascom came to own 100% of
KPM, and Terra Raf came to own 100% of TNG. As of July 2000, Petitioners, through their
ownership of KPM and TNG, were the operators for both the Borankol and Tolkyn fields, as
well as the Tabyl Block.

32. Beginning around 2001, KPM and TNG invested substantial sums of
money developing the Borankola and Tolkyn fields, and exploring the Tabyl Block. They
conducted seismic evaluations, drilled and recompleted numerous wells, and built significant
infrastructure for processing, storing, and transporting hydrocarbons. In addition, TNG
commenced construction of a state-of-the-art liquefied petroleum gas (“LPG”) plant to extract
valuable liquid hydrocarbons from natural gas. In total, Petitioners invested (or reinvested) more
than $1 billion in developing these previously-idle oil and gas fields, which employed numerous
local citizens, supplied revenue to the Kazakh treasury, and greatly contributed to the overall
development of the region.

33. Beginning in October of 2008, just as those investments had begun to
mature and generate significant returns, the ROK began a campaign of intimidation and
harassment apparently intended to pressure Petitioners into selling their investments to the state-
owned oil company KazMunaiGas at a substantially depreciated price. Among its numerous
harassing actions, the ROK:

e  Baselessly and publicly accused Petitioners of committing fraud and

forgery in their acquisition of TNG, which impaired their credit rating and

clouded their title to TNG;

e Levied more than $70 million in baseless back taxes against both

companies;

Case 1:14-cv-00175 Document 1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 9 of 12

e Arrested and prosecuted KMG’s general manager for the purported crime

of “illegal entrepreneurial activity,” based on KMG’s alleged failure to

have the correct license to operate a gathering pipeline (which it had

operated for years with no question), ultimately sentencing him to four

years in jail and imposing a fine of US$ 145 million on KPM (even though

it had not been a party to the prosecution); and

e Ultimately, seized all of the assets KPM and TNG outright, under the

pretext of several baseless and minor breaches of the Subsoil Use

contracts.

34. Based on these actions, the Request for Arbitration alleged several claims
under the ECT, including a denial of fair and equitable treatment of Claimants’ investments in
Kazakhstan. The tribunal issued the Award on December 19, 2013.

35. On jurisdiction, the tribunal found that (i) it had jurisdiction over the
Petitioners’ claims because the parties had consented in the ECT to arbitration before the SCC,
(ii) the Petitioners were investors who had made investments within the meaning of the ECT, and
(iii) all other conditions to jurisdiction were met. Award, Sun Decl. Ex. A, {J 709, 747, 813,
830, and 841.

36. On liability, the tribunal found, among other things, that the ROK’s
actions, taken together, “constituted a string of measures of coordinated harassment by various
institutions of Respondent” that “must be considered as a breach of the obligation to treat
investors fairly and equitably, as required by Art. 10(1) ECT.” Id. at ¥ 1095.

37. Article 40 of the SCC Rules expressly provides that “[a]n award shall be

final and binding on the parties when rendered. By agreeing to arbitration under these Rules, the

Case 1:14-cv-00175 Document1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 10 of 12

parties undertake to carry out any award without delay.”

38. Moreover, Article 26(8) of the ECT expressly provides that:

The awards of arbitration, which may include an award of interest,

shall be final and binding upon the parties to the dispute. An award

of arbitration concerning a measure of a sub-national government

or authority of the disputing Contracting Party shall provide that

the Contracting Party may pay monetary damages in lieu of any

other remedy granted. Each Contracting Party shall carry out

without delay any such award and shall make provision for the

effective enforcement in its Area of such awards.

39. Despite these requirements, and Petitioners’ demand that the ROK satisfy
the Award, the ROK has not made any payment to Petitioners under the Award.

Cause of Action

40. Petitioners repeat and reallege the allegations in paragraphs | through 39
as if set forth fully herein.

Al. The arbitration agreement set forth herein at paragraphs 10 through 20
constitutes “an agreement in writing” within the meaning of Article II(2) of the New York
Convention. See ECT, Article 26(5)(a)(ii) (“The consent given in paragraph (3) together with
the written consent of the Investor given pursuant to paragraph (4) shall be considered to satisfy
the requirement for ... an ‘agreement in writing’ for purposes of article II of the United Nations
Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, done at New York,
10 June 1958 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘New York Convention’).”).

42. The Award arose out of a legal relationship that is commercial within the
meaning of 9 U.S.C. § 202.

43. The Award was made in Sweden, a nation that is a signatory to the New

York Convention, and which is a State other than the State where recognition and enforcement is

sought hereby.

Case 1:14-cv-00175 Document1 Filed 02/04/14 Page 11 of 12

44, The Republic of Kazakhstan, Moldova, and the United States also are each
signatories to the New York Convention.

45. The Award is final and binding within the meaning of the New York
Convention and Chapter 2 of the FAA.

46. Upon information and belief, the ROK and its instrumentalities and agents
maintain assets in the United States, and those assets are and have been used for commercial
purposes in the United States and may be executed upon in satisfaction of any judgment entered
in Petitioners’ favor herein.

47. None of the grounds for refusal or deferral of the Award set forth in the
New York Convention applies.

48. The Award is required to be confirmed pursuant to the New York

Convention and 9 U.S.C. § 207.

WHEREFORE, Petitioners pray:

(a) That the Court enter an order pursuant to 9 U.S.C. § 207 confirming the Award
against the ROK; and

(b) That, on the basis of the confirmed Award, the Court enter judgment that the
ROK is liable to Petitioners jointly in the amount of US$ 506,660,597.40 plus (a) compound pre-
judgment interest as set forth in the Award from April 9, 2009 to the date that judgment is
entered herein, and (b) post-judgment interest from the date that judgment is entered to the date
of satisfaction; and

(d) That Petitioners be awarded such other and further relief as may be proper.
