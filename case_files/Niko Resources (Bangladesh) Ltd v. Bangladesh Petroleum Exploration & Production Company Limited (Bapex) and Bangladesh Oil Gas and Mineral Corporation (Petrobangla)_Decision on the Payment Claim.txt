INTRODUCTION

The present case relates to marginal or abandoned gas fields in
Bangladesh that the Government of the People’s Republic of
Bangladesh (the Government) had decided to develop. Niko
Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. (Niko), the Claimant, proposed to
carry out this development. Niko evaluated three such fields
and concluded that two of them, the Chattak and the Feni
fields, were sufficiently promising to continue with a work plan.

With the approval of the Government, Niko concluded on
16 October 2003 a Joint Venture Agreement (the JVA) with the
Bangladesh Petroleum & Production Company, Limited
(BAPEX), the Second Respondent.

The development of the Feni field was successful and gas
supplies from two wells in this field started in November 2004.
BAPEX and Niko (the Joint Venture Partners) began to
negotiate a Gas Purchase and Sale Agreement (GPSA) with the
Bangladesh Oil Gas and Mineral Corporation (Petrobangla), the
Third Respondent. However, due to difficulties in reaching an
agreement on the price for the gas, the finalisation of the GPSA
was much delayed. Eventually it was concluded on
27 December 2006, again with the approval of the Government.

The Joint Venture Partners had already delivered gas to
Petrobangla before the conclusion of the GPSA. They continued
to do so thereafter. Petrobangla made some payments but much
of the gas delivered remains unpaid.

During drilling in the Chattak field, a blowout occurred on
7 January 2005 and another on 24 June 2005. The Government
formed a committee to enquire about the causes of the blowouts
and the damage caused. It concluded that Niko was responsible
for the blowouts and estimated the damage caused by them.

In the fall of 2005, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers’
Association (BELA) and others introduced a petition in the
Supreme Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, against the
Government of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, BAPEX, Niko and
others, seeking inter alia a declaration that the JVA was invalid

and an injunction restraining payments to Niko in respect to the
Feni gas field (the BELA proceedings). The court issued the
injunction against Petrobangla. On 5 May 2010, the court
denied the requested declaration but maintained the injunction.

In May or June 2008, Petrobangla and the Government of
Bangladesh commenced legal action in the Court of District
Judge, Dhaka, against Niko and others, seeking compensation
on the order of Tk746.5 crore as damages for the two blowouts
(the Money Suit). These proceedings are still pending.

The present proceedings were started by two successive
Requests for Arbitration against the two Respondents and the
Government, one filed with the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID or the Centre) on
1 April 2010 (the First Request or RfA I) and registered as
ARB/10/11; the other filed with ICSID on 16 June 2010 (the
Second Request or RfA II) and registered as ARB/10/18. In
these requests Niko sought an award for payment of the
outstanding invoices for the gas delivered (the Payment Claim)
and a declaration that it was not liable for damages in relation
to the blowouts (the Compensation Declaration).

At the First Session of the two arbitrations on 14 February 2011
in Geneva, it was agreed that the two cases were to proceed ina
concurrent manner and that the two Tribunals may render their
decisions in the two cases in a single instrument. In the present
decision the two Tribunals therefore are referred to collectively
as “the Tribunal”.

The Respondents objected to the jurisdiction of ICSID. In a first
phase of the arbitration, the Tribunal decided this jurisdictional
objection in a decision of 19 August 2013 (the Decision on
Jurisdiction). It held that it had jurisdiction with respect to the
claims against BAPEX and Petrobangla but not with respect to
the Government, which was dismissed from the arbitration. The
Tribunal refers to this decision for a detailed account of the
initial phase of this arbitration and the facts related to it.

The proceedings thereafter were divided in two tracks, running
partly in parallel, one dealing with the Payment Claim, the other
with the Compensation Declaration. The Tribunal first

addressed the Payment Claim, which is the sole subject of the
present decision.

In this phase of the proceedings, the Tribunal received written
submissions on 27 September, 28 November 2013, 30 January
and 27 March 2014, held an evidentiary hearing in London from
28 to 30 April 2014 and received post-hearing submissions on
the question of interest on 22 May, 6 June and 17 June 2014. It
now renders its Decision on the Payment Claim.

The Tribunal also heard requests for provisional measures and
decided them in Procedural Order No. 6 of 1 May 2014.

SUMMARY OF THE RELEVANT FACTS

The present dispute relates to two gas fields named Feni and
Chattak (sometimes also spelled Chhatak) in Bangladesh. These
two fields, together with the Kamta gas field, had been declared
by the Government as “Marginal/Abandoned Gas Fields.”

The mineral resources in the Chattak and Feni gas fields are
vested in the People’s Republic of Bangladesh pursuant to
Article 143 of Bangladesh’s Constitution, as confirmed in the
Preamble of the JVA.

The Chattak field (located in Sylhet) was discovered in 1959 by
Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (subsequently renamed Bangladesh
Petroleum Ltd) and brought into production in 1960. It supplied
local users and, from 1974, the Sylhet Pulp and Paper Mill. It
was shut down in 1985 due to increased water production.>

The Feni field (located in Chittagong) was discovered by a
predecessor of BAPEX in 1980. It was in production between
1988 and 1998.°

Both fields were at some point sold or transferred to BAPEX.”
Only the Feni field became productive again and delivered gas,
which is the subject of the present arbitrations.

3.1 The negotiations for the GPSA and initial gas
deliveries

The agreements out of which the present arbitration arose were
the result of negotiations that lasted over several years
conducted by the Claimant and Niko Resources Ltd, its parent
company, on the one hand, and Bangladesh, Petrobangla and
BAPEX, on the other hand. These negotiations started with a
letter and preliminary proposal that Niko Resources Ltd
addressed on 12 April 1997 to the Bangladesh Minister of
Energy and Mineral Resources regarding the development of

> ‘Bangladesh Marginal Field Evaluation - Chattak, Feni and Kamta’ (February 2000), p. B-8 (Annex B
to the JV produced as Attachment A to RfA I and RFA ID)

some marginal and non-productive gas fields in Bangladesh;®
eventually they led to the conclusion of the JVA and the GPSA.

These negotiations were described in detail in the Decision on
Jurisdiction. The summary here is limited to the facts that are
relevant specifically to the Payment Claim and its context.

Following the directions of the Government and Petrobangla, the
JVA between BAPEX and the Claimant was executed on
16 October 2003. Annex C thereto, the Procedure for
Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas _ Fields (the
Procedure) which the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral
Resources (the Ministry) was developed in 2001 and formed the
framework for the JVA.°

The JVA’s “object” or “scope” was the development and
production of Petroleum from the Chattak and Feni fields,
including gaseous hydrocarbons, at Niko’s sole risk and
expense. It defines the investment and operation activity of
Niko, identified as the Operator, and manner in which BAPEX
and Niko cooperate in the context of the project.

With respect to the sale of the Petroleum produced by the
Operator, Article 24.3 of the JVA provides:

“OPERATOR and BAPEX (hereinafter referred to as
SELLER) agree to sell the produced Petroleum to the
Bangladesh domestic market under this JVA. BUYER of
JV gas shall be Petrobangla or a designee of Petrobangla
(hereinafter referred to as BUYER). BUYER & SELLER
shall enter into a Gas Purchase and Sales Agreement
(GPSA) under which the Buyer shall agree to purchase the
Petroleum to which the Seller is entitled to under this
JVA, subject to deliverability and testing and proof of
such Petroleum. OPERATOR shall be free to find a market
outlet within the Country if a market outlet is not given by
Petrobangla within six months after a request is made.”

® The original correspondence is listed in the letter of Niko Resources Ltd to BAPEX dated 1 February
1999, produced in the first phase of this arbitration as Exhibit 9, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.
° The Procedure is also described in Exhibit 18, Appendix B to R-CMJ.1.

33.

34.

35.

36.

The JVA also refers in Article 24.4 to the procedure for
determining the price of the gas:

“The well head price of natural gas and associated
products to be produced by the Seller and delivered to the
Buyer shall be determined through negotiations as per
Article 7 of the ‘Procedure for the Development of
Marginal /Abandoned Gas Fields’. The Well Head Gas
would meet the specifications (quality, pressure etc.) of
the sales gas determined by Petrobangla.”

Article 6.2.2 of the JVA provides that a “Joint Bank Account is
to be opened in Bangladesh and operated jointly by the
representatives of the Operator & BAPEX for receiving sales
proceeds and making distribution to the Parties”. The share
split between the Parties is regulated in Article 23 of the JVA.

Upon conclusion of the JVA, Niko commenced work on the
development of the two fields. The first well it sought to develop
in the Feni field was Feni-3, which tested water instead of gas in
17 of a total of 19 zones.!° Nevertheless, towards the end of the
first semester of 2004, gas production was _ considered
imminent.

Niko then sought to negotiate a GPSA with Petrobangla. These
negotiations lasted for almost two years. The GPSA was
eventually executed on 27 December 2006. The main point of
disagreement during the negotiations was price. Still, Niko
commenced delivery of gas on 2 November 2004 in the absence
of a finalised GPSA. At several occasions during the
negotiations, Niko reduced or suspended deliveries. This met
with immediate objections from Petrobangla which insisted that
Niko resume deliveries and even increase them.

The events during this period have been described in some
detail in the Decision on Jurisdiction.'! In its Memorial on the
Payment Claim, the Claimant refers to and concurs with this

'° Explanations contained in Niko’s letter to the Ministry of 7 August 2004 (year erroneously shown as
2002), produced in the first phase of this arbitration as Claimant's Exhibit 6, p. 475 and paragraph 3 at

account of the facts.!2 The present Decision reiterates elements
of this factual account that are of specific present relevance.

The negotiations commenced with the letter that Niko wrote to
Petrobangla on 19 May 2004, explaining that a skid-mounted
gas plant was to arrive on 1 June and the Feni-3 would go into
production in July 2004. The letter continued:

“We, therefore, would like to initiate discussions with the
Government of Bangladesh and Petrobangla to finalise the
subject agreement so that Feni-3 can be on production as
soon as the gas plant is commissioned.

We understand that pursuant to Article 7 of the
“Procedure for Development of Marginal/Abandoned Gas
Fields” as approved by the Honorable Prime Minister, the
gas price of the Investor shall be negotiated between the
Government, Petrobangla, and the Investor. Moreover,
Article 24.3 of the Bapex-Niko JV stipulates that the
Buyer of the gas from the Feni Gas Field shall be
Petrobangla or its designee.

In view of the above, we request a meeting with the
authorised representatives of the GOB, Petrobangla, and
Bapex to initiate the process to execute the subject
agreement so that Feni-3 well could be on production at
the earliest.”!3

On 6 June 2004, Petrobangla requested that Niko submit a
proposed GPSA for the Feni Gas Field.'4 Niko responded on
14 June 2004, announcing that Feni-3 was completed, that
work on Feni-4 was advancing, and that the gas plant was
expected to be in place and commissioned in time to produce
gas from those two wells by early August 2004. The letter was
accompanied by a draft for the GPSA.!5

Further to a letter from the Ministry dated 15 July 2004,!6 a
committee was formed “to negotiate for finalisation of gas
pricing of Ex. Feni gas field which is being developed by BAPEX-

NIKO”. The Committee, described here as the Gas Pricing
Committee, was composed of a representative of the Ministry in
the function of Convenor!’ and _ representatives from
Petrobangla, BAPEX and Niko. !8

The first two meetings of the Committee took place on 24 July
and 4 August 2004 under the chairmanship of the Convenor.
Minutes of both were drawn up on the letterhead of the
Ministry.'!9 They record that Niko requested a price of
USD 2.75/MCF. At the end of the discussion “the Chair offered
Niko to agree Feni Gas Price at USD1.75/MCF, since Niko
signed the JVA considering this price”. Niko stated that it would
respond later.2°

Niko answered the proposal by a letter to the Additional
Secretary in the Ministry on 7 August 2004, insisting that the
gas price that it sought was reasonable and justified. It
suggested consultations on the economics of the Feni
development.

On 1 November 2004, Petrobangla wrote to Niko, thanking it
“for successful development of Feni gas” and declaring:

“Petrobangla undertakes to buy gas from Bapex-Niko
Joint Venture Feni marginal gas field.

Price of gas will be paid as per agreed and signed GPSA
when finalised.”?!

Gas delivery started on the following day, 2 November 2004,
without an agreement having been reached on the price and
without a contract having been executed.

On 7 January 2005, a first blowout occurred in the Chattack
field, followed by another on 24 June 2005. These blowouts
gave rise to proceedings before the courts of Bangladesh. The
events will be discussed below in Section 3.2; they did not affect
the production from the Feni fields.

On 14 February 2005 Niko wrote to Petrobangla that the

“trial production period has ended. Our gas plants have
been commissioned. We now find ourselves in an
extremely difficult position with our management and
board to justify and continue gas production from Feni
without finalisation of the price of our share of the gas.”2?

The letter went on to ask for an immediate interim payment for
the gas delivered from November 2004 to January 2005 at the
price of USD 2.35/MCF and finalisation of the gas price within
the next ten days, failing which Niko would suspend gas
production from the Feni field.

Petrobangla responded the same day, announcing that it “would
make a lump sum interim payment against the gas supplied from
November, 2004 to January, 2005” without prejudice to the rate
to be agreed.23 On 10 March 2005 Petrobangla announced that
it had “arranged a payment of US$2 million today for the time
being to you on a lump sum basis ...”24 Niko confirmed receipt as
“lump sum partial payment for Niko’s share of gas production for
November, December and January” .25

In a letter of 10 March 2005, BAPEX referred to the letter that
Niko had addressed to the Ministry on 9 March 2005 of which it
had received copy. BAPEX relied on Article 16.1(c) of the JVA
which identified as an event of default if “[aJny of the party
indulges/commits any act which is contrary to the interests of
Bangladesh” and required Niko to withdraw the notice of
suspension of gas production “or else we would be constrained
to take all necessary steps under the JVA to up hold the interests
of the country” .2©

Further meetings of the Gas Pricing Committee were held. After
a meeting on 16 March 2005, Niko wrote to the Ministry, to the
attention of the Minister himself, summarising its

understanding of the differences. The letter contained the
following passage:

“It was expressed by the Chairman of Petrobangla that the
final result of the Committee’s deliberations may be that
we will not reach a consensus on the price. He further
opined that it is possible that the Committee will have to
conclude its deliberations with a report to the Ministry that
a price for the gas could not be agreed. Niko acknowledged
that this could be a possible outcome of the Committee
meetings, however it was requested by Niko that this
conclusion be arrived at as soon as possible so that other
avenues for concluding the price agreement could be
pursued. Mr Osman [the Chairman of Petrobangla]
suggested that if the Committee did not agree on a price
that Niko/Bapex may have to directly approach the
Government of Bangladesh for a final decision.”2’

During these negotiations Niko ordered the motor vehicle which
was delivered on 23 May 2005 to the State Minister for Energy
and Mineral Resources. In June 2005, Niko Canada invited the
Minister, at its costs, to an exposition in Calgary. This was
followed by the Minister’s resignation on 18 June and the return
of the vehicle to BAPEX on 20 June 2005. These events were
discussed at length in the Decision on Jurisdiction;?8 no further
explanations of substance or evidence have been produced in
the present phase of the arbitration.

The Gas Pricing Committee continued its work and held its final
meeting on 23 October 2005.29 It issued a report entitled
“Committee Report on Feni Gas Pricing”; the report is not dated
but the signatures of the members show the dates of 25 and 26
October 2005. The members of the Committee were identified in
the report consisting of, on the one hand, “Officials from
Government”, including Additional Secretary of the Ministry in
the position of the Convener, the Chairman and a Director of
Petrobangla and the Managing Director of BAPEX and, on the
other hand, “Officials from Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd”.
The report concluded as follows:

“Committee’s recommendation:

The Committee could not reach a consensus in respect of
pricing of gas to produce from Feni field. The matter,
therefore, remained unresolved.

The members representing Government side recommend
that the Niko’s share of gas from Feni filed under the
terms of JVA may be purchased by Petrobangla at best at
a price of US$1.75/MCF.”8°

The report included comments by Niko to the effect that it “will
therefore suggest to the GOB this solution [i.e. “to pursue an
arbitrated settlement”] to move forward on the matter’.*! In a
letter to the Ministry dated 25 October 2005, Niko referred to
Article 18.3 of the JVA and proposed that the gas price
determination “be referred to a sole expert to arbitrate ...”.32

This proposal was not accepted and the matter remained
unresolved.

By 24 November 2005 no agreement had been reached on the
gas price and the GSPA, but Petrobangla had made interim
payments to Niko of a total amount of USD 4 million.** Niko
wrote to Petrobangla that as of 28 November 2005 it would
suspend gas production from the Feni Field pending “mutual
resolution” of the gas price, the agreement and execution of a
GPSA, and “settlement of arrears for gas sold to date from the
Feni Field.”*4 Petrobangla responded on the same day,
requesting Niko to withdraw the notice and not to suspend
deliveries. It concluded: “If you are still determined to do so that
will be seriously prejudicial to our national interest and we shall
be constrained to act accordingly.”

Following a letter from Niko dated 26 November 2005,
postponing the start of suspension to 29 November 2005,
Petrobangla wrote on 28 November 2005 requiring Niko to
continue delivering under the terms of the agreement, stating its
position as follows:

°° Claimant’s Exhibit 6, pp 460, 463 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.

*! Claimant’s Exhibit 6, pp. 432, 433 produced in the first phase of the arbitration.

“May it be reiterated that Niko cannot unilaterally decide to
suspend gas production from Feni field at its sole choice
under the JVA without first terminating the same. The
obligation of Niko to deliver gas continuously has arisen on
November 01, 2004 when Petrobangla (vide its letter no
121.16.14/648, dated November O01, 2004) issued the
confirmation sought by Niko, or at least when Niko
reconfirmed the same vide its letter Niko/President/04-
12/036, dated December 11, 2004. As such it is not true
that Petrobangla has not confirmed the agreement as
asked for. May it be also noted that payment of US$ 4
million is obviously a part payment which also establish
that Petrobangla has not only confirmed but also made
interim payment. ”3®

Petrobangla added that it was restrained from making further
payments by an order of 16 November 2005 of the High Court
Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh of which it quoted
the following passage:

“Since the order restraining the respondents 1.9 from
making any payment to respondent No. 10 in respect of
any gas field or any other account passed by the High
Court Division has not been modified by the Appellate
Division that order shall continue.”37

Petrobangla concluded from this order: «As such we cannot
make any payment anymore until the said Order of the Court is
vacated.” Nevertheless Petrobangla insisted that deliveries
should not be suspended;

“We would like to state that we are equally serious to
conclude a GPSA which in our opinion could reasonably
expected to be completed within a month or two, until such
time there should not be any suspension of production.
Accordingly we request you not to take any measures
which might cause us to react otherwise.”38

On 29 November 2005 a meeting between Niko representatives
and Mr Mahmudur Rahman, Energy Advisor of the Ministry,

21

took place at the Ministry. Niko wrote to him on the same day,
thanking him for the meeting and reiterating that Niko

requires the full support of your Ministry and the
Government of Bangladesh to assist us in having the ad-
interim order of the Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005 stayed
as they apply to stopping the government from making
pay ‘s to NRBL. Susp ion of the ad-interim order to
prohibit payments from the Government of Bangladesh is
crucial to allowing us to resume drilling operations and
continue production of gas from the Feni Gas Field.

 

We will be making an application to the Supreme Court
Division in the next few days to request that the ad-interim
order stopping payments to NRBL be stayed. The support
and attendance at the Supreme Court, together with Niko’s
counsel, by the most senior government legal officials
would be most beneficial in this regard.”3°

58. On the same day, 29 November 2005, Petrobangla wrote to

Niko:

“Please be informed that the purchase price of gas of the
Feni Gas Field is fixed at US$1.75/MCF.

We hereby invite you to negotiate the terms of the GPSA for
the production of Feni Gas Field, finalise, agree and
execute the same based on the above price.”4°

59. Niko responded on 30 November 2005, stated its disagreement
with that price and reiterated its proposal to settle the difference
by reference to a sole expert. In the interim it accepted payment
on the basis of USD1.75/MCF “for volumes delivered to date,
and in the future, as partial settlement for the gas sales pending
final resolution and settlement of the gas price in a GPSA”.*!

60. On 5 December 2005, Niko confirmed that it accepted payment
of USD 1.75/MCF on an interim basis until determination by
the proposed expert.

On the same day, Niko sent the draft for an interim GPSA to
BAPEX,*2 which responded on 11 December 2005 with some
suggested changes.*? Niko replied on 14 December, sending
revised version of the draft GPSA and stating that it had
incorporated the requested changes.*4 BAPEX suggested further
changes on 19 December,*® which Niko incorporated in a
further revision of the draft GPSA returned to BAPEX on
20 December 2005.46

On 16 January 2006, Niko announced to BAPEX the temporary
reduction and shut down of production from the Feni field.*7 It
also seems to have made such announcements to Bakhrabad
Gas Systems Ltd (BGSL). BAPEX objected to _ this
communication in a letter of 19 January 2006, stating inter alia:

“In our opinion this sort of unilateral decision and message
to BGSL is a violation of JVA article no 24.3 since
Petrobangla is the only authority & agent of GOB |i.e. the
Government of Bangladesh] that purchases, sells, monitors
and controls the transmission and distribution systems of
gas in the country. ...”.48

On 18 January 2006, a meeting apparently took place between
the “Advisor, Energy & Mineral Division” of the Ministry and
Niko, followed on 19 January 2006 by a meeting between Niko
and Petrobangla. As a follow-up to these meetings, on
22 January 2006, Niko sent to Petrobangla and BAPEX what it
described as the “final version” of the Interim GPSA, already
initialled by Niko.49

This version was not executed. Instead, a meeting between Niko
representatives and the Advisor, Energy & Mineral Resources
Division, at the Ministry took place on 12 February 2006. The
meeting was followed by a letter from Niko to the Advisor dated
13 February 2006 in which it stated that the Advisor’s
“confirmation of the delay in getting final approval from the Prime
Minister’s Office to allow us to proceed with our work was

concerning ...”. Among the matters of concern Niko listed the
finalisation of the Interim GPSA and the appointment by the
Government of legal counsel to represent it in the BELA
proceedings.5°

At a meeting on 14 February 2006 Petrobangla requested Niko
to increase production from the Feni field. This request was
confirmed in a letter from Petrobangla to Niko of 20 February
2006, which referred to the request at that meeting as well as to
“repeated requests” to the same effect.5! On 26 February 2006,
Niko announced to Petrobangla, with copy to the Prime
Minister, the Ministry and others, that as of 27 February 2006 it
planned to shut down all gas production from the Feni field
“until further notice”; no reasons were given for this decision.5?

Petrobangla objected to the decision in a letter of 28 February
2006 and requested Niko “to immediately restore gas production
to an increased quantity”. It added:

“We are carefully scrutinising the draft GPSA you have
submitted and our response to the same shall be
communicated to you in due course. If the shut down has
any connection with finalisation of the GPSA, it appears to
be unnecessary at this point of time when negotiations
even have not started.”53

In a letter to Petrobangla of 2 March 2006 Niko provided
explanations for the shutdown, referring in particular to the
absence of an approved Work Programme and Budget and of a
GPSA.

Petrobangla replied on 5 March 2006, stating that “the gas price
under the JVA is a matter of common understanding of the
Government of Bangladesh (GOB), Petrobangla and the investor’.
That issue could not be subject to arbitration or determination
by a sole arbitrator “since GOB is not going to be a party to that’.
Referring to the draft GPSA that Niko had submitted,
Petrobangla declared that it was “ready and willing to start
negotiation on that. Feel free to contact us.”54 The letter

concluded with a request “to restore gas production with a
promised 10 MMCF increased daily production within 24 hours of
receipt of this letter or else we shall be constrained to take any
measure legally possible” .55

Petrobangla, BAPEX and Niko then met on 7 March 2006. The
following day, on 8 March 2006, Niko wrote to Petrobangla and
to Mr Jamaluddin in his function as Managing Director of
BAPEX and “Member Secretary of the Committee for
Finalisation of Gas Pricing for the JVA”, requesting that a
meeting of the Committee be urgently convened and added:

“Furthermore, we value the relationship we have with the
Government of Bangladesh and considering the national
interest Niko Management after having detail discussion
with the Hon’ble Advisor for the Energy & Mineral
Resources Division decided to turn on the Gas Production
from Feni Gas Filed [sic] as a gesture of our goodwill ...”5°

Gas deliveries did indeed resume; but the negotiations for the
GPSA were completed only on 27 December 2006 when the
GPSA was executed. No evidence has been produced as to
whether the status of the injunction against payments to Niko
was addressed in these negotiations. In particular there is no
indication that Petrobangla informed Niko that, after the
conclusion of the GPSA and until the injunction had been lifted,
it would not make payments that it committed to make in the
GPSA.

3.2 The blowouts and their consequences

As mentioned above, on 7 January 2005 a first blowout
occurred in the Well No. 2 of the Chattak field. The
circumstances and consequences of this blowout are still
controversial. However, it appears that gas escaped from the
well, ignited forming a high flame and caused damage to the
surroundings.

Niko conducted relief well operations in the course of which a
second blowout occurred on 24 June 2005 in the Chattak gas
field at the Relief Well Chattak 2A.

Niko, the Government of Bangladesh, and Petrobangla
investigated the causes and consequences of the two blowouts.
These investigations and their findings will be considered in the
course of the proceedings concerning the Compensation
Declaration. Brief reference to them must be made here, since
the blowouts and their consequences in terms of liability and
the damage caused form part of the background for the court
proceedings in Bangladesh and the injunction on which the
Petrobangla relies as justification for not paying Niko’s invoices
for gas delivered.

Starting on 9 January 2005, the Government of Bangladesh
formed a number of enquiry committees to determine the
causes of the fire and assess various categories of losses.5” The
first committee report was submitted on 10 February 2005;58 it
held Niko responsible for the first blowout. Subsequent reports
in Bangladesh concluded that Niko was responsible for both
blowouts and assessed the quantity and value of the gas lost,5°
the damage to the local population, environmental damage and
other losses.®°

Niko participated in some of these investigations and
committees but not in others. It made its own investigations,
including the engagement of a well-control consultant, who
produced the Safety-Boss report on 24 January 2005.° It
concluded that the blowout was “in relative terms not a serious
event’ and that Niko dealt with it “immediately, responsibly,
effectively and without regard to costs dealing with this
emergency event thereby minimising its impact to all parties” .©2

The Claimant states that it performed remedial work and “made
substantial ex gratia payments to local families, businesses,

religious centres, schools and other organisations as part of its
commitment to fully remediating the potential consequences of the
blowouts”.©° The Claimant quantifies at USD 290’687 the direct
compensation that it paid to members of the local community
affected by the blowouts, in addition to payments through the
local Deputy Commissioner following the conclusions of the
local loss committee.°*

In the fall of 2005, the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers’
Association (BELA) and others issued a petition in the Supreme
Court of Bangladesh, High Court Division, against the
Government of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, BAPEX, Niko and
others, seeking inter alia a determination that the JVA was
invalid, that the payments made in respect of Feni gas
purchases by Petrobangla were without lawful authority and an
injunction restraining payments to Niko in respect to the Feni
gas field or on any other account (the BELA Proceedings).
These proceedings are discussed below in Section 7.2.

In the course of these proceedings, the injunctions on which
Petrobangla relied when suspending payments under the GPSA
and in defence against the Payment Claim were issued.

On 27 May 2008, Petrobangla served legal notice on Niko,
claiming Tk746.50 crore as damages for the blowouts.®5

Niko responded on 9 June 2008, denying liability for any
damages arising from the blowouts at Chattak and that
Petrobangla suffered the alleged damage. It added that the
claims brought by Petrobangla had to be resolved by arbitration
and that it was willing to resolve the issues between the Parties
through arbitration conducted through ICSID, as agreed
between the Parties.©¢

On 15 June 2008, the People’s Republic of Bangladesh and
Petrobangla, further to the notice of 27 May 2008 served by
Petrobangla, commenced proceedings in the Court of the
District Judge in Dhaka against Niko, two of its executives,
GSM, and its drilling manager. They claimed damages in the

amount specified in the Notice (these proceedings are referred to
as the Money Suit).°7

The proceedings in the Money Suit are still pending in the 274
Court of Joint District Judge, Dhaka, with the reference “Money
Suit No. 224/2008”. The merits of the claim have not been
heard;®8 but during the time preceding the hearing in the
present proceedings on the Payment Claim, applications for stay
of the proceedings were made. The matter is further discussed
below in Section 4.2.2and 4.2.3.

3.3. The Payment Claims under the GPSA

After the GPSA had been executed, Niko invoiced Petrobangla on
10 January 2007 for the gas produced from the inception of gas
production in November 2004 to December 2006. These and
subsequent invoices were not paid. Details are described below
in Section 7.1.

After several reminders, on 30 September 2007 Niko sent a
Notice of Default to Petrobangla, claiming payment of the
outstanding amounts.®?

At Joint Management Committee meeting No. 8 on 25 March
2008, Niko and BAPEX reviewed the payments outstanding from
Petrobangla. Niko requested that arbitration be commenced
immediately against Petrobangla under the GPSA; BAPEX did
not agree.7°

On 8 January 2010, Niko served Notice of Arbitration on
Petrobangla under the GPSA.’! By a separate Notice of the same
date, Niko joined BAPEX to the arbitration commenced against
Petrobangla.7? This was followed by the two Requests for
Arbitration on 1 April and 16 June 2010, the latter of which
concerned the outstanding payments under the GPSA.

THE PROCEDURAL HISTORY

4.1 From Registration to the Tribunal’s Decision on
Jurisdiction

A detailed account of the procedural history in the present two
arbitrations until the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction was
set forth in that decision, issued on 19 August 2013. It will
suffice here to recall only the main elements of that record.

Niko Resources (Bangladesh) Ltd. (Niko or the Claimant) filed a
Request for Arbitration dated 1 April 2010 against the People’s
Republic of Bangladesh, Petrobangla, and BAPEX (the First
Request or RfA I). Pursuant to Article 36(3) of the Convention
on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and
Nationals of Other States (ICSID Convention or Convention),
the Acting Secretary-General registered that request on 27 May
2010 and assigned to it ICSID Case No. ARB/10/11.

The Claimant filed a further Request for ICSID Convention
Arbitration, dated 16 June 2010, against the same three
Respondents, i.e., the People’s Republic of Bangladesh,
Petrobangla, and BAPEX (the Second Request or RfA II). The
Acting Secretary-General registered that request on 28 July
2010 and assigned to it ICSID Case No. ARB/ 10/18.

The Tribunals in both arbitrations, collectively referred to as
“the Tribunal”, were constituted on 20 December 2010 in
accordance with Article 37(2)(b) of the ICSID Convention. At the
request of the Parties, the composition of the Tribunal was
identical, consisting of Professor Jan Paulsson, a national of
Sweden, France and Bahrain, appointed by the Claimant,
Professor Campbell McLachlan, a national of New Zealand,
appointed by the Respondents, and Mr Michael E. Schneider, a
national of Germany, appointed as President of each Tribunal
pursuant to the Parties’ agreement.

The First Session in these two arbitrations was held on
14 February 2011. During this Joint First Session the Parties
agreed inter alia that the two cases were to proceed in a
concurrent manner, that the Tribunal may issue one single
instrument in relation to both cases, and that it may deal with

29

92.

93.

the two cases jointly except where circumstances distinct to one
case necessitate a separate treatment. It is in light of this
agreement that in the two arbitrations and in the present
decision, the two Tribunals, as pointed out above, will be
referred to in the singular. The Parties also agreed that the
applicable arbitration rules would be the ICSID Arbitration
Rules in force as of 10 April 2006, that the place of proceedings
would be London, United Kingdom, and that the language of the
arbitration would be English. They confirmed that the Tribunal
was properly constituted in the two cases and that they had no
objection to the appointment of any Member of the Tribunal.

At the Joint First Session, the Tribunal and the Parties also
considered the procedural timetable. It was decided that the
Respondents’ objections to jurisdiction would be dealt with as a
preliminary matter. The Parties subsequently filed several
rounds of written submissions on jurisdiction and a hearing on
jurisdiction was held on 13 and 14 October 2011 in London.

On 19 August 2013, The Tribunal issued its Decision on
Jurisdiction, deciding inter alia that the Tribunal:

(1) has jurisdiction under the JVA and between the Claimant
and BAPEX to decide:

(a) the Claimant’s request for a Compensation Declaration
and

(b) the Claimant’s Cooperation Claim;

(2) has jurisdiction to decide the Claimant’s claim against
Petrobangla for payment under the GPSA;

(3) reserves the questions related to the necessary role (or
otherwise) of BAPEX in relation thereto;

(4) _ will give by separate order directions for the continuation
of the proceedings pursuant to Arbitration Rule 41(4).

4.2 Subsequent to the Tribunal’s Decision on Jurisdiction

Further to its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal provided
the Parties on 27 August 2013 with preliminary proposals for
the organization of the proceedings on the merits and invited
their comments regarding (i) the Payment Claim and the related
Cooperation Claim (collectively referred to as the “Payment
Claim”), and (ii) the requested Compensation Declaration.

On 5 September 2013, the Claimant provided comments on the
Tribunal’s request of 27 August 2013 and proposed a tentative
procedural timetable for the further written and oral procedure
on the merits related to both the Payment Claim and the
Compensation Declaration.

On 16 September 2013, the Respondents provided comments on
the Tribunal’s request of 27 August 2013, disagreeing with the
Claimant’s proposals.

On 19 September 2013, the Tribunal set out the deadlines for
the Claimant’s first written submissions and invited the Parties
to consult and agree on the deadlines for the remainder of the
written procedure.

In accordance with the Tribunal’s 19 September 2013
directions, the Claimant filed on 27 September 2013 its
Memorial concerning the Payment Claim (C-PC.1), together with
exhibits, legal authorities, and a witness statement of Mr Amit
Goyal, as well as its Memorial concerning the Compensation
Declaration (C-CD.1).

Having received on 24 and 25 September 2013 the Parties’ views
regarding the organization of the further procedure, the
Tribunal issued, on 15 November 2013, Procedural Order No.
3 concerning the procedural calendar for the remainder of the
proceedings on the merits in relation to the Payment Claim and
the Compensation Declaration.

The proceedings on the Compensation Declaration follow a
separate track in which, until now, the Claimant has filed, in
addition to C-CD.1, on 29 May 2014 its Reply (C-CD.2) and
BAPEX on 30 January 2014 its Counter-Memorial (B-CD.1). The
Rejoinder of BAPEX is due on 25 September 2014, followed by a

31

101.

102.

103.

104.

105.

hearing in London from 10 to 14 November 2014, with 15
November held in reserve.73 Since they will follow a separate
track, the proceedings concerning the Compensation
Declaration will not be addressed further in the present
decision.

4.2.1 Proceedings on the Payment Claim

Procedural Order No. 3 provided for additional written
submissions on the Payment Claim and a hearing in London.
Following consultations with the Parties and considering the
dates for the written submissions and the availability of the
Parties and the members of the Tribunal, the time for the
hearing on the Payment Claim was fixed for the week starting
from 28 April 2014.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 3, Bapex and
Petrobangla each filed on 28 November 2013 a Counter-
Memorial concerning the Payment Claim (B-PC.1 and P-PC.1);
Petrobangla’s Counter Memorial was accompanied by exhibits
and legal authorities as well as a witness statement of Mr Imam
Hossain.

The Claimant filed its Reply concerning the Payment Claim on
30 January 2014 (C-PC.2), together with exhibits, legal
authorities and a second witness statement of Mr Goyal.

Further to proposals made by the Claimant on 13 December
2013 and comments by the Respondents of 19 December 2013,
the Tribunal issued, on 31 January 2014, Procedural Order
No. 4, modifying and completing the directions with respect to
the means of communication in these proceedings which it had
given at the First Joint Session on 14 February 2011.

On 27 March 2014, Petrobangla filed its Rejoinder concerning
the Payment Claim (P-PC.2), together with exhibits, legal
authorities and a second witness statement of Mr Hossain.

™ These dates were fixed at the hearing in the Payment Claim on 30 April 2014; see Summary Minutes
of that hearing, dated 9 May 2014, paragraph 7.4.

4.2.2R for Provisional Measures related to the Payment
Claim

106. On 23 December 2013, the Claimant filed a request for
provisional measures, requesting the Tribunal to order
Petrobangla to withdraw an attachment application filed on
17 November 2013 in the Money Suit No. 224/2008” before the
2.4 court of the Joint District Judge, Dhaka. Through this
attachment application Petrobangla had sought to attach
approximately USD 27 million, as invoiced by Niko to
Petrobangla under the GPSA.

107. On 2 January 2014, the Tribunal invited comments from
Petrobangla on the Claimant’s request of 23 December 2013.
Petrobangla filed its observations on 31 January 2014.

108. On 6 January 2014, the Respondents requested that, following
their written reply, an oral hearing be held concerning the
request for Provisional Measures, “given the importance which
both the Claimant and Petrobangla attach” to these measures.
The Claimant informed the Tribunal that it saw no need for
such a hearing.

109. Following the receipt of Petrobangla’s Response to the
Claimant’s Request for Provisional Measures, the Tribunal
decided on 16 February 2014 that an oral hearing on the
Claimant’s request be held in conjunction with the hearing on
the Payment Claim, which had been scheduled to commence on
28 April 2014. The Tribunal also fixed deadlines for a further
round of written submissions on the Claimant’s request for
provisional measures.

110. In its letter dated 16 February 2014, the Tribunal moreover
noted that a hearing in relation to the attachment application
had been scheduled to take place in Dhaka on 13 March 2014,
i.e., before the provisional measures hearing in these
arbitrations. The Tribunal hence perceived the need to ensure
that in the meantime the situation relating to the Claimant’s
provisional measures request would not be aggravated, nor that
compliance with a possible recommendation by the Tribunal be
rendered more difficult. The Tribunal invited the Parties to state

™ See above Section 3.2.

111.

112.

113.

114.

115.

116.

what measures they considered necessary to ensure such
result.

In accordance with the timetable set forth in the Tribunal’s
letter dated 16 February 2014, the Claimant filed on 17
February 2014 a reply to Petrobangla’s observations on
provisional measures made on 31 January 2014.

On 28 February 2014, Petrobangla filed a Rejoinder on
Provisional Measures. In this rejoinder Petrobangla introduced
a conditional request for provisional measures, stating: “if
the Tribunal orders Niko’s proposed provisional measures and
adopts the legal theory advanced by Niko in order to grant the
measures sought, it would only be fair, proportionate and
reasonable to order Niko to withdraw its petition for stay of the
Money Suit litigation”. On 24 March 2014, the Claimant filed
observations on Petrobangla’s request for provisional measures.

Having received the Parties views regarding the preservation of
the status quo on provisional measures, the Tribunal issued
Procedural Order No. 5 on 6 March 2014. In this procedural
order, the Tribunal instructed Petrobangla to request the 274
Court of the Joint District Judge in Dhaka to adjourn the
hearing on the Attachment Application until a date after 31 May
2014. The Tribunal further ordered the Claimant to support this
request if and when invited by Petrobangla to do so.

On 14 April 2014, the Claimant informed the Tribunal that Niko
had requested on 13 March 2014 an adjournment of the
hearing on the Attachment Application and that the Court
granted Niko’s application and issued the order on the same day
postponing the hearing in the Money Suit until 12 June 2014.

4.2.3 Hearing on the Payment Claimant__and_ Provisional
Measures

 

In accordance with the directions set out by the Tribunal, a
hearing on the Payment Claimant and on Provisional Measures
was held from 28 to 30 April 2014 in London.

Prior to the hearing, the Tribunal had written to the Parties on
15 April 2014, setting out some preliminary considerations

34

117.

118.

119.

concerning the substance of the dispute that may impact the
scope and organisation of the hearing. With respect to the
Payment Claim, it identified factual questions and legal
considerations which it considered possibly relevant for its
decision; it identified information which it invited the Parties to
provide, in particular with respect to pending court proceedings
relating to the requested provisional measures, and addressed
other matters relating to the organisation of the hearing and
pre-hearing consultations.

After some further correspondence, the Tribunal proposed on 24
April 2014 a tentative agenda and gave further directions for the
organisation of the hearing.

The hearing was attended by the three Members of the Tribunal
and the Secretary and the following persons:

For the Claimant:

Mr Barton Legum, Ms Anne-Sophie Dufétre, Ms Brittany
Gordon, and Mr Matthew Smith of Dentons, Paris; Messrs
Rokanuddin Mahmud and Mustafizur Rahman Khan of
Rokanuddin Mahmud & Associates, Dhaka; and Mr Amit
Goyal, Mr Tim Henry, and Mr Brian J. Adolph of Niko
Resources Ltd.

For the Respondents:
Mr Tawfique Nawaz, Mr Imtiaz Farooq and Dr Dipu Moni of

Juris Counsel, Dhaka; Mr Luis Gonzalez Garcia of Matrix
Chambers, London, and Mr Md. Imam _ Hossain of
Petrobangla, Dhaka.

In the course of the hearing on the Payment Claim, the
Tribunal sought to clarify certain issues identified in the
Tribunal’s letter dated 14 April 2014 and other issues arising
from the Parties’ written and oral submissions concerning the
Payment Claim. Mr Amit Goyal, Controller of Niko Resources
Ltd., and Mr Md. Imam Hossain, Secretary of Petrobangla
testified as witnesses and responded to the Tribunal’s
questions. The Parties were given an opportunity to examine the
witnesses, to develop their case orally and to respond to
questions from the Tribunal.

126.

With regard to the further procedure on the Payment Claim, it
was agreed that Petrobangla would file by no later than 22 May
2014 a written submission on the applicable interest in relation
to the Payment Claim and that the Claimant would file by no
later 6 June 2014 its observations on Petrobangla’s submission.

Subject to these submissions concerning the applicable interest
rates, the proceedings on the Payment Claim were closed
and the Tribunal announced that it would now render its
decision on this claim.

In the course of the hearing on Provisional Measures, the
Parties were given an opportunity to present their case-in-chief,
offer rebuttal statements, and to respond to questions from the
Tribunal.

On 30 April 2014, the last day of the hearing, the Parties
informed the Tribunal that they had reached an understanding
with regard to their respective requests for provisional
measures, which the Parties also provided to the Tribunal in
written form. The Parties’ understanding was embodied in the
Tribunal’s Procedural Order No. 6, issued on 1 May 2014.

During the course of the hearing, the Parties submitted
additional Legal authorities and documentary evidence,
including an agreed translation of the docket in the Money
Suit.75 All of these are listed in the Summary Minutes of the
hearing.

At the end of the hearing, the Tribunal enquired whether there
were any outstanding points or issues to be addressed. Since
this was not the case, the Tribunal declared the hearing closed.
Summary Minutes of the hearing were prepared by the
Tribunal and sent to the Parties on 9 May 2014.

The hearing was recorded and a transcript was prepared by
Ms Georgina Ford and Mr Ian Roberts of Briault Reporting
Services. A copy of the transcript was sent to the Parties and the
Members of the Tribunal on each hearing day. The audio
recording of the hearing was distributed to the Parties at the
hearing and was sent to the Members of the Tribunal on 6 May

5 Exhibit C-98 (revised); See HT Day 5, p. 551.

127.

128.

2014. The Parties were given an opportunity to correct the
transcript. A revised version of the transcript with the Parties
agreed corrections was distributed on 18 June 2014.

Further to the programme agreed at the end of the hearing,
Petrobangla filed its Submissions on Interest in the Payment
Claim on 22 May 2014 (P-PC Interest.1); the Claimant
responded by its Observations on Respondent’s Submission on
Applicable Interest in the Payment Claim (C-PC Interest.1); in
view of new information and evidence contained in the latter
submission, Petrobangla was given an opportunity for
comments, and on 17 June 2014 submitted Observations on
Submissions on Interest in the Payment Claim (P-PC
Interest.2).

The Tribunal deliberated in person and by correspondence and
reached the present decision unanimously.

THE RELIEF SOUGHT BY THE PARTIES AND THE ISSUES
TO BE DECIDED

5.1 The Claimant’s requests for relief

The dispute concerning the Payment Claim was first defined in
the Claimant’s Notice to Arbitrate of 8 January 2010, as
amplified in its Request to Institute Arbitration Proceedings of
16 June 2010 in which the Claimant also identified the relief it
sought as follows:

“...that the following disputes be arbitrated:

(a) Petrobangla’s failure or refusal to pay for gas delivered
under the GPSA from and after November 2, 2004,
including its refusal to pay the invoices rendered to it
under the GPSA, as particularized in Niko’s Notice of
Default to Petrobangla dated December 13, 2007
Ref: NRBL/FIN/07-08-085 (a copy of which was
attached thereto);

(b) Petrobangla’s failure or refusal to pay for gas delivered
under the GPSA from and after November 2, 2004
including its refusal to pay the invoices rendered to it
under the GPSA, to the date of the notice or the date or
[sic] arbitration;

(c) The validity of Petrobangla’s alleged excuses for non-
payment to the Joint Account established by Niko and
Bapex for the purpose of receiving payments under the
GPSA, including

(a) any alleged excuse arising from or relating to
any injunctive or other order made by the Court
in the BELA Proceedings or in any appeal
proceedings relating to the suit;

(b) any set off claimed by Petrobangla arising from
the Compensation Claims, which claims are
described in the Legal Notice dated May 27,
2005 issued on behalf of Petrobangla to Niko (a
copy of which was attached) and/or in the
pleadings in the Money Suit;

(d) If Petrobangla is entitled to any set off on account of
the Compensation Claims, the amount of such set off;

38

(e) Determination of the net amount owed by Petrobangla
to Niko (or alternatively the Seller as defined in the
GPSA), pursuant to the GPSA for gas delivered from
and after November 2, 2004 until the date of the
hearing of the arbitration.”

130. In its Memorial concerning the Payment Claim of 27 September
2013, the Claimant defined the relief sought thus:
“... an award in its favor and against Petrobangla and
BAPEX:

a. Declaring that:

i. Niko is entitled to bring and capable of bringing a
claim for that amount due under the Invoices owed
to Niko on its own; or

ii. In the alternative, that Niko is entitled to bring
and capable of bringing a claim for the entire
amount owed under the Invoices to Niko and
BAPEX;

or

iii. In the further alternative, that BAPEX is
required to cooperate with Niko in advancing a
claim for the total amount owed under the Invoices,
which cooperation includes pursuing arbitration
under Article 13 of the GPSA with Niko and
accordingly BAPEX shall be deemed to consent to
same in specific performance of its obligations;

b. Ordering Petrobangla to pay to:

i. Niko the total amount owing to Niko under the
Invoices, being $25,313,920.00 in USD plus
139,993,479 in BDT; or

ii. In the alternative, Niko the total amount owing to
Niko and BAPEX under the Invoices, being
$25,313,920.00 in USD plus 750,848,445 in BDT,
being both Niko’s share in BDT and BAPEX’s share
in BDT; or

iii. In the further alternative, to Niko and BAPEX
the total amounts owing under the Invoices, being

39

$25,313,920.00 in USD plus 139,993,479 in BDT
to Niko and 610,854,966 in BDT to BAPEX;

c. Ordering Petrobangla to pay interest on any payment
awarded under paragraph 78b,”° above at a simple
annual rate of 5 percent through the date of the
award;

d. Awarding Niko costs in accordance with Article 61
of the ICSID Convention;

e. Ordering that all sums awarded be in freely
transferable and exchangeable funds, in accordance
with the requirements of Article 26.1.6 of the JVA;

f. Ordering post-award interest at an annual rate of 5
percent compounded monthly until the award is
paid in full; and

g- Awarding such other and further relief as the
Tribunals deem appropriate.”

131. In its Reply concerning the Payment Claim of 30 January 2014,
the Claimant restated its request for relief in this way:

“An award in its favor and against Petrobangla and
BAPEX:

(a) Declaring that Niko is entitled to bring and capable
of bringing a claim to that portion of the Invoices
owed to Niko on its own;

(b) Ordering Petrobangla to pay to Niko the total
amount owing to Niko under the Invoices, being
US$ 25’312’747 plus BDT 139°988’337;

(c) Ordering Petrobangla to pay interest on any
payment awarded under paragraph 146b77 above at
a simple annual rate of 5 percent through the date
of the award;

(d) Ordering post-award interest at an annual rate of 5

paid in full;

(e) Awarding Niko costs in accordance with Article 61

and

76 This refers to the preceding paragraph (b) in the same prayer for relief.
7 This refers to the preceding paragraph (b).

40

(f) Awarding such other and further relief as the
Tribunals deem appropriate.”
132. At the last day of the hearing, on 30 April 2014, the Claimant
produced a new version of the relief requested, in the following
terms: 78

“1. Claimant Niko respectfully submits that the Tribunals

5.2 The Respondents’ requests for relief

133. In its Counter-Memorial concerning the Payment Claim of
28 November 2013, Petrobangla sought the following relief:

“Petrobangla submits that the Tribunal should dismiss

the claims in its entirety and should declare that:

(1) For Petrobangla to pay Niko would be inconsistent
with Bangladesh law, and would require

44

134.

135.

(2)

(3)

Petrobangla to violate its legal and constitutional
obligations.

The gas supply contract between the Parties has
been frustrated by the Court’s Order in the BELA
proceedings, and is therefore terminated.

The GPSA was procured by corruption and is
therefore void.

In its Rejoinder of 27 March 2014 Petrobangla reiterated the
request for relief in the Counter Memorial.

During the course of the hearing, Petrobangla presented on
30 April 2014 its request for relief in the following terms:

“Petrobangla requests the Tribunal to declare that:

1.

Petrobangla is not in breach of GPSA and no

interest is to be paid until the date of the decision of

this Tribunal (“Decision”).

Petrobangla cannot be required to violate its

constitutional and legal obligations under

Bangladesh law.

Petrobangla’s non-performance under the GPSA is a

legitimate excuse under Article 14 of the GPSA and

or Bangladesh law.

The Decision or any proceedings thereof do not

constitute an amicable settlement as envisaged in

the Order of High Court Division dated 17.11.2009

(‘High Court Division Order’).

About the dues owed to Niko from Petrobangla, the

following actions need to be taken:

(a) The dues as admitted by the Parties to be put
into 2 (two) separate accounts to be opened in
a bank in Bangladesh acceptable to both
Petrobangla and Niko (“Designated Bank’).
The account will be opened in the name of
Petrobangla, but will be opened for the sole
purpose of holding the said amount. There
will be one USD account and one BDT
account for holding the respective USD and
BDT part of the dues (jointly referred to as
“Accounts’).

(b) The funds in the Accounts will be held by
Petrobangla until disbursed in accordance
with the Decision.

45

136.

137.

138.

139.

(c) The funds in the Accounts will be disbursed
to Niko only when the conditions set out in
the High Court Division Order are satisfied.

(d) The Accounts will be interest bearing at
prevailing interest rates as provided by the
Designated Bank.

6. Petrobangla’s [sic] is entitled to costs in connection
with the Payment Claim.”

In its Counter Memorial of 28 November 2013, BAPEX stated its
position in the following terms:

“(1) Insofar as Niko’s claim is based on a contractual
breach of an alleged direct liability of Petrobangla
under the GPSA as a ‘buyer’ concerning the
amounts ‘owed’ to it under the invoices in this
arbitration, that claim does not require BAPEX’s
approval or co-operation. It is further submitted
that Niko cannot bring a claim against Petrobangla
for the entire sum alleged owed to Niko-BAPEX as
Joint Venture partners.

(2) BAPEX submits that there is no basis for adding
BAPEX as a third party in this arbitration.”

 

“For avoidance of doubt”, BAPEX added in these submissions
that it “is not a respondent in this case”. It made no further
submissions in the proceedings concerning the Payment Claim.

5.3 The issues to be decided

The Tribunal notes that the Parties have set out in detail the
relief requested in this phase of the arbitration and that the
relief so requested varied considerably as the proceedings
evolved. It concludes that the changes in these requests were
considered and intentional. Therefore, the Tribunal considers
the Parties’ respective cases by reference to the latest version of
the relief requested and treats earlier versions of this relief, to
the extent that they have not been incorporated in this latest
version, as abandoned, at least with respect to the Payment
Claim which it now has to decide.

Against this background, the Tribunal has identified the
following issues:

46

(a) The role of BAPEX with respect to the Payment Claim;

(b) The amounts due from Petrobangla;

(c) The force majeure defence in respect to the GPSA or
any earlier agreement;

(d) The obligations of Petrobangla in the absence of a valid
force majeure defence;

(e) Interest;

(f) Costs of the arbitration.

47

140.

141.

142.

143.

144.

145.

THE ROLE OF BAPEX

The GPSA provides that payments shall be made to the “Seller”.
This term is defined on the title page of the GPSA as “the Joint
Venture Partners”, that is to say Niko and BAPEX. The
expression “Joint Venture Partners” is also used in the
Preamble, together with the expression “BAPEX-NIKO jointly”.
In Article 1.13 the Seller is defined as “the BAPEX-NIKO Joint
Venture as described in the Preamble of this Agreement”.

In their submissions concerning the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, the
Parties took conflicting positions concerning the question of
whether Niko could act alone for the “Seller” or for its share in
the amounts due for the gas delivered.

In its Decision on Jurisdiction, the Tribunal examined in detail
whether it had jurisdiction with respect to claims under the
GPSA, in particular those made by the Claimant against
Petrobangla. It concluded that it had jurisdiction to decide on
claims made by Niko against Petrobangla arising under the
GPSA.79

It reserved its decision about the question of whether such
claims, if they exist, must be made for the Joint Venture
Partners jointly or whether they may be made for Niko alone; it
also reserved the decision concerning the position of BAPEX in
the proceedings concerning the GPSA.®°

In the proceedings concerning the Payment Claim, the Claimant
concluded that Niko was entitled to act alone in bringing a claim
to that portion of the Invoices which, according to the JVA, was
owed to Niko; it seeks payment only for that portion.

Although named as Respondent in this part of the proceedings,
BAPEX declared that it was “not a respondent in this case”. The
only objection which BAPEX raised against Niko’s Payment
Claim consisted in stating that “Niko cannot bring a claim
against Petrobangla for the entire sum alleged owed to Niko-

” Paragraphs 529-574 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.
*° Paragraph 574 of the Decision on Jurisdiction.

48

146.

147.

148.

BAPEX as Joint Venture partners”.8! Since Niko does not claim
the entire sum, this objection is moot.

The question remains whether the consent of BAPEX, as one of
the Joint Venture partners, is required for Niko to claim from
Petrobangla payment of a portion of the sums due to the Seller
under the GPSA. Neither the JVA nor the GPSA gives a clear
answer. In the JVA, the JV is defined as the “Joint Venture
between Niko and BAPEX” and there is no clear indication of a
distinct legal personality of the JV; nor has there been, as far as
the Tribunal has been informed, an incorporation of the JV. In
the GSPA there are references to the “Joint Venture Partners”
Niko and BAPEX as “the Seller” and to “the BAPEX-NIKO Joint
Venture” also as “Seller”. Article 11.1.4 makes reference to the
“joint bank account [...] in accordance with Article 6.2.2 of the
JVA” but then distinguishes between the “sales proceeds due to
BAPEX according to the JVA and five percent (5%) of sales
proceeds of NIKO’s share ...”.

The documentary record of the arbitration contains some
indications to the effect that the JV may be considered as a
distinct “legal” or “business entity’.82 Yet there are also
numerous indications to the contrary: in particular the
negotiations and correspondence concerning the conclusion of
the GPSA were primarily conducted between Niko and
Petrobangla. The payment on account which Petrobangla made
in the form of two payments of 2 million US Dollars each was
made to Niko directly. The invoices for the gas delivered were
sent by Niko; they identified separately the amounts due to Niko
and to BAPEX. This practice was followed from the first set of
invoice sent on 10 January 20078 to the last invoice sent on
2 May 2010;8* there is no record of a complaint by either
Petrobangla or BAPEX against this practice. The dispute about
the payment of the Invoices and Petrobangla’s defence based on
the Injunction concerns specifically Niko as a separate entity
and not the Joint Venture.

These are strong indications that, in the dispute with
Petrobangla concerning the payment of the Invoices for the gas

delivered, Niko may act alone, provided it seeks payment only
for its share according to the allocation under the JVA.

In any event, in this arbitration BAPEX has raised no objection
to Niko’s claiming its share of invoices from Petrobangla. In its
Memorial, the Claimant had expressly stated that BAPEX had a
duty to cooperate and was deemed to consent. BAPEX did not
object in its Counter Memorial. If and to the extent to which
BAPEX’s consent to a claim by Niko for its portion of the sales
price were required, BAPEX must be deemed to have given that
consent.

The Tribunal concludes that Niko may pursue its claim for that

portion of the “Seller’s” invoices which concerns the portion of
the sales price due to Niko under the JVA.

THE PAYMENT CLAIM

Niko seeks an order against Petrobangla for payment of
USD 25’312’747 and BDT 139’988’337, plus simple interest at
the rate of 5% per annum.

Petrobangla does not contest that it owes the amount claimed
but raises as defence that, on grounds of force majeure, it was
and continues to be excused for not making the payment. As
long as non-payment is excused on this ground, so it argues,
Petrobangla does not owe interest on the principal. Petrobangla
accepts, however, that the amount owed be placed into an
interest earning escrow account.

In its Counter Memorial, Petrobangla argued that “the gas
supply contract between the parties has been frustrated by the
Court’s Order in the BELA proceedings, and is therefore
terminated”.®5 In its Reply Niko denied that there was merit in
that position and added: “even if Petrobangla was to succeed in
establishing a frustration defence, it would still be liable to pay
Niko for the gas it received, on the basis of the doctrines of
frustration and unjust enrichment”.8¢ Petrobangla did not
pursue this argument in its Rejoinder and, in its final version of
the relief sought, no longer asserted that the “gas supply
contract” had been terminated. The Tribunal concludes that this
claim has been abandoned by Petrobangla.

Petrobangla sought in its Counter Memorial a declaration that
the “GPSA was procured by corruption and is therefore void”.87
The Claimant objected to this request, relying on the Tribunal’s
findings in the Decision on Jurisdiction.** In that decision the
Tribunal had examined the allegations of corruption. It referred
in particular to the conclusion of the High Court Division in the
BELA case “that the JVA was not obtained by flawed process by
resorting to fraudulent means”; it also found that there was no
evidence that the GPSA had been procured by corruption. No
new argument or evidence has been produced since then.
Petrobangla did not pursue the matter further and omitted the
claim in the final version of the relief sought. The Tribunal

concludes that the request concerning the avoidance of the
GPSA on grounds of corruption has been withdrawn.

7.1 The amounts due (the principal)

The amounts owed for the gas delivered are undisputed: they
consist of the amounts due for gas delivered from November
2004 to December 2006 and specified in the 26 invoices sent on
10 January 2007, plus those amounts invoiced monthly for the
gas delivered from January 2007 to the end of April 2010.89

In its Memorial of 27 September 2013, the Claimant quantified
the amounts owed to Niko at USD 25’313°920 and BDT
139°993’479.9° In its Counter-Memorial of 28 November 2013
Petrobangla, relying on the Witness Statement of Mr Hossain,
quantified “the total amount owed for gas supplied by Niko” at
USD 25’312’747 and BDT 139’988’337.°!

In its Reply of 30 January 2014, the Claimant noted that the
difference between the Parties concerning the amounts owed
was small. It declared that the difference resulted from slightly
different approaches to calculating the amounts and that the
“differences between the parties are sufficiently minor that it is
not worthwhile to debate them.” It adopted the amounts that
Petrobangla had stated as owing to Niko.9?

On this basis the Tribunal takes USD 25’312’747 and
BDT 139°988’337 as the undisputed amounts which, after
deduction of payments made already, are owed by Petrobangla
to Niko for its share of the price for the gas delivered during the
period from November 2004 to April 2010.

The GPSA provides in Article 11.1.3 that amounts invoiced
“shall be paid to Seller not later than forty five (45) days from
the date of receiving the invoice by the Buyer”. Article 11.1.4

® Exhibits C-5 to C-7.

°° C-PC.1, paragraph 78.b.i.

°! P-PC.1, paragraph 55. At that paragraph Petrobangla states that the amount indicated is « with
respect to the 26 invoices that followed the lump sum payment ». This is obviously incorrect since both
Parties agree that an amount of some USD 25 million is due not just for the 26 invoices but for the total
deliveries until April 2010. Indeed, Mr Hossain, on whose Witness Statement Petrobangla relies, states
that the amount of some USD 25 million is for the 66 invoices that “have been raised with respect to
gas supplied from feni field” Hossain WS I, paragraph 17.

GPSA adds that all payments “shall be made in the joint bank
account at a scheduled bank of Bangladesh ...”. The Tribunal
concludes that, unless and until the joint bank account had
been established, Petrobangla could not have made any
payment. Therefore, no amount was due before this time.

The Joint Bank Account was opened on 14 May 2007.9° On the
same day, Niko wrote to Petrobangla, requesting immediate
payment of the amounts that had been invoiced by that time.%*

The Tribunal concludes that all invoiced amounts were due and
payable 45 days after the receipt of the invoice by Petrobangla
but not before 14 May 2007.

7.2 The Injunction in its successive versions

The excuse on which Petrobangla relies for not paying the
undisputed amount is the injunction issued by the BELA Court
on 12 September 2005, subsequently upheld in appeal
proceedings, confirmed and transformed.

The injunction in its original form was issued on 12 September
2005. On that day the Bangladesh Environmental Lawyers
Association (BELA) had made the Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005
against 10 respondents, including Bangladesh, represented by
the Secretary, Energy Division, Ministry of Power, Energy and
Mineral Resources (Respondent 1), Petrobangla (Respondent 4),
BAPEX (Respondent 5) and Niko (Respondent 10).95 The petition
sought a declaration that the Niko/BAPEX Joint Venture
Agreement was concluded without lawful authority and had no
legal effect, that it should be “treated as a nullity having been
procured through flawed process and resorting to fraudulent
means and forged documents” and “should be treated as illegal;
[having come] to an end as a result of material breach of the
statutory and legal obligations”. In the petition BELA also
requested that Bangladesh and BAPEX be

P-PC.2, paragraph 17(4), p. 8; at the hearing 14 May 2007 was accepted by Petrobangla as the date
when the joint account had been opened (HT Day 3, p. 118).

directed to take immediate effective measures to
realize full compensation for destruction of the valuable
natural gas resources and the damage to live [sic] and
property and environment by the blow outs resulting from
the respondent No. 10’s failure to discharge its legal
obligations ...”

Pending the hearing of the case, the petitioners applied for a
number of injunctions and orders.

On the same day, 12 September 2005, the Supreme Court of
Bangladesh, High Court Division (Special Original Jurisdiction),
proceeding ex parte, gave directions for further proceedings on
the petition and made inter alia the following order:

“Pending disposal of the Rule, Respondents no. 1 to 9 are
restrained from making any payment of [to?] no. 10 in
respect of Feni Gas Field or any other account up to
22.10.05.”%6

In addition, the order contained directions to Bangladesh,
Petrobangla and BAPEX (Respondents 1, 4 and 5), inter alia

“...to submit a report within 45 days if receipt of this
order specifying the measures that have been taken
against respondent no. 10 to recover compensation for the
successive blow outs, [...] and freeze all bank accounts of
respondent No. 10 maintained in Bangladesh.”

The following day, on 13 September 2005, Niko filed “Civil
Miscellaneous Petition No. 712 of 2005” in the Supreme Court of
Bangladesh, Appellate Division (Civil Appellate Jurisdiction). It
stated that it had learnt about the interim orders of the High
Court Division from the daily newspapers and requested a stay
of these interim orders. It explained in particular that the
freezing of its bank accounts would lead to a stoppage of the
day-to-day operations both for the gas supply from the Feni
Field and the relief operations from the Chattak Field.
Restraining payments to Niko would “add to the adverse effect
on the finance and cash flow required for the continuous

°° Exhibit C-26; also produced as Exhibit R11.

54

operations” of Niko “jeopardising and stopping gas production
and supply”.9”

167. On 14 September 2005, the Appellate Division of the Supreme
Court removed the freezing order concerning the bank accounts,
but left the injunction against payments to Niko intact. It made
the following order:

“Let the application for stay be placed before the Court on
23" October 2005. The interim order so far it relates to
freezing of all the Bank accounts of the Respondent No.
10 maintained in Bangladesh is stayed till that date. The
Respondent No. 10 is restrained from making any foreign
remittance from the Bank Account.”9°

168. The High Court Division considered the matter again on
19 October 2005. It noted that the order freezing Niko’s bank
accounts had been stayed by the Appellate Division and
concluded that “there is no scope to extend the previous stay
order”. Concerning payments to Niko, the court found that no
decision had been made by the Appellate Division and
concluded:

“Since the order retraining the respondents 1-9 from
making any payment to respondent No. 10 in respect of
any gas field or any other account passed by the High
Court Division has not been modified by the Appellate
Division that order shall continue.”°9

169. Niko filed on 23 October 2005 Civil Petition No. 1395 of 2005
(arising out of C.M.P. No. 712) for leave to appeal against the
interim orders of 12 September 2005, essentially on the grounds
exposed in the petition of 13 September 2005. 1°°

°7 Exhibit C-96, p. 12.

°S Exhibit C-27.

® Exhibit C-28. In Petrobangla’s letter of 28 November 2005 (Exhibit R-13) the same passage is
quoted as part of an order of the High Court Division of 16 November 2005; but no order of that date
has been produced. Since the order of 19 October 2005 is uncontested, it does not seem to make any
difference for the issues that have to be decided here whether, in addition, there was a further order on
16 November 2005. The Tribunal therefore leaves the uncertainty about the possible order of

16 November 2005 unresolved.

The Appellate Division addressed the petition on the same day,
23 October 2005, and left the situation unchanged. It made the
following order:

“The order of stay granted earlier is extended till 11
December, 2005 on which date the leave petition will
come up for hearing before the Court.”!0!

On 12 December 2005 the Appellate Division extended its order
for further six weeks;!0? on 24 January 2006 it was extended for
further two months,!°$ on 28 March 2006 for further three
months! and on 26 June 2006 for further six months.!°5 On
12 December 2006, the Appellate Division decided that “the
earlier order of stay is still in force and hence tantamount to
continue”. 106

The Appellate Division considered the Petition No. 1395 of 2005
for a last time at a hearing on 3 October 2007. In its order of
that day, the Appellate Division referred to the High Court’s
order of 12 September 2005 and the order which the Appellate
Division had made in response to Niko’s “leave petition”, i.e. the
stay of the freezing of Niko’s bank accounts in Bangladesh and
the restraining order against making any foreign remittances
from the Bank Account. It concluded:

“The aforesaid order passed earlier by this Division is
extended till hearing of the aforesaid Writ Petition.”107

Thereafter the High Court Division held several hearings in the
BELA proceedings which spanned a period of several months,
starting in February 2009.!°° The Court rendered its judgment

on 16 and 17 November 2009,!°9 finding that the “JVA was not
obtained by flawed process by resorting to fraudulent means”.!10

174. Concerning the claim for compensation and the injunction
against payments to Niko, the High Court Division made the
following order:

“... Niko is directed to pay the compensation money as
per the decision to be taken in the money suit now
pending in the Court of the Joint District or as per the
mutual agreement among the parties. The respondents
are restrained by an order of injunction form making any
payment to respondent No 10. This order of injunction
shall remain in force till disposal of the money suit or till
amicable settlement amongst the parties, whichever is
earlier.”1!!

175. In this form the injunction has remained in force and no
information has been provided to the Tribunal that this version
of the injunction has been modified or terminated.

176. The Money Suit by which Bangladesh and Petrobangla claim
damages relating to the blow outs was filed in the Court of the
District Judge, Dhaka on 15 June 2008.!!2 As explained above,
these proceedings are still pending. The requests for provisional
measures in this arbitration, as they were described above,
relate to these proceedings in the Money Suit.

7.3 Force Majeure defence prior to the conclusion of the
GPSA

177. Petrobangla’s principal line of defence relies on an agreement for
the sale of gas concluded in November 2004. It argues that, in
relation to this agreement, the injunction by the BELA Court,
issued on 12 September 2005 was unforeseen and justifies its

signatures at p. 42 show the dates of 2 and 3 May 2010, the Claimant gave 5 May 2010 as the date
when the final decision was made (C-PC.1, paragraph 43). At the hearing it was clarified that the
judgment was delivered on 16 and 17 November 2009 (HT Day 3, pp. 27, 29, 138; but as explained at
the hearing by Mr Nawaz, the certified copy was issued only on 2 May 2010 (HT Day 3, p. 139).

force majeure defence. The Claimant denies that there is such
an agreement of November 2004 and argues that its claims for
payment are based on the GPSA of 27 December 2006; which
was concluded in full knowledge of the injunction.

The argument of Petrobangla relies on “an oral agreement for
the sale of gas between Niko/BAPEX and Petrobangla in early
November 2004”;!!5 it specifies that this contractual relationship
between Niko and Petrobangla began on 4 November 2004.!!4
Elsewhere in its submissions, Petrobangla states that it was
already “[iJn or around August 2004” that “Petrobangla and Niko
agreed to enter into a commercial relationship to sell and
purchase gas without a signed GPSA”.!15

When on 12 September 2005 the BELA Court issued its
injunction against payments to Niko, according to Petrobangla,
this was “an unforeseen legal impediment beyond the control of
Petrobangla. Since the Order is a Constitutional and legal
impediment to Petrobangla’s performance under the sales
contract with Niko and BAPEX, Petrobangla’s right to invoke
force majeure is a complete defence to Niko’s payment claim”.!!6¢

In support of this argument, Petrobangla relies on the law of
Bangladesh, in particular Article 56 of the Bangladesh Contract
Act 1872, as well as the doctrine of force majeure under
common law and general principles of law.!!7 Petrobangla
insists that the “relevant contract is the oral agreement between
the parties, not the GPSA”;!!§ for this reason, Petrobangla
argues that force majeure provision of Article 14 of the GPSA,
“has no application to that oral agreement”.!19

The Claimant does not contest that, prior to the conclusion of
the GPSA on 27 December 2006, the Parties were in discussion
about an interim arrangement for the period until the GPSA was
concluded. For the Claimant, the interim arrangement was the
subject of correspondence that did not lead to an agreement.

182. Examining the evidence produced with respect to the
arrangement during the interim period, the Claimant concluded

“there was no agreement on volume. There was no
agreement on price until late 2005 when Niko agreed to
Petrobangla's proposal of USD 1.75 per MCF. There was
no agreement on any other term of the interim
arrangement with one exception: all parties agreed that
the price during the interim period would be adjusted
after the GPSA was concluded on the basis of the price
fixed in the GPSA.”!2°

183. The Tribunal considered that immediately before delivery
started in November 2004, Niko had addressed the following
offer to Petrobangla:

“... we will be pleased to put gas on production from the

Feni Gas Field with immediate effect, that is November 1,

2004, pending execution of the Gas Sales and Purchase

Agreement (GPSA).

To facilitate the above we request a confirmation from
Petrobangla that Petrobangla shall purchase and pay Niko
for Niko's share of the gas at USD 2.35/MCF or the
finalized price in the GPSA, whichever is lower, for the gas
delivered during the interim period prior to signing the
GPSA.”!21

184. Petrobangla responded on the following day, 1 November 2004,
thanking Niko for the “successful development of the Feni gas
field”, and stated:

“Petrobangla undertakes to buy gas from Bapex-Niko
Joint Venture’s Feni marginal gas field.

Price of gas will be paid as per agreed and signed GPSA
when finalised.”122

120 HT Day 3, p. 43.

"2! The letter has not been produced, but it is mentioned in Petrobangla’s reply letter dated 1 November
2004 (Exhibit C-3). The quoted passage, on which the Claimant relied during the hearing (HT Day 3, p.
41), is taken from the letter of Petrobangla’s letter of 24 November 2005 (Exhibit C-31) which quotes
the letter in extenso.

122 Exhibit C-3 and R-1.

59

185.

186.

187.

188.

Although this response, as the Claimant pointed out, is not a
clear acceptance of the offer of 31 October 2004, Niko delivered
gas and, even prior to the conclusion of the GPSA, required
payment on an interim basis, for instance in a letter of 14
February 2005.!25 Indeed, as Petrobangla pointed out, it made
two payments of USD 2 million each!?4 and now attributes these
payments to the contractual relationship on which it relies.!25

In these circumstances it may well be that some form of
contractual arrangement existed prior to the conclusion of the
GPSA, even though the manner in which it came about and its
terms were not clearly defined and the persons who concluded it
have not been identified by Petrobangla.!26 However, the
question of whether an agreement prior to the GPSA was indeed
concluded and in what terms need not be resolved for the
following reasons.

As the Claimant rightly points out,!27 the Parties expressly
referred in the GPSA to the correspondence that had been
exchanged prior to the conclusion of that agreement and
addressed the question of the effect that had to be given to it.
They provided in Article 16 the following:

“All the discussions and meetings held and
correspondence exchanged between the Buyer and Seller
in respect of the Agreement and any discussions arrived
at therein in the past and before the coming into force of
the Agreement are hereby superseded by the Agreement
and no reference of such discussions or meeting [sic] or
past correspondence will be entertained by either the
Seller or the Buyer for interpreting the Agreement or
otherwise.”

Any agreement that may have been concluded between the
Parties by the exchange of correspondence, at meetings or
otherwise, thus has been superseded by the conclusion of the
GPSA. In this GPSA the Parties agreed on the delivery of gas to

Jurisdiction, specifically paragraph 56 and the documentary evidence quoted there.

' P_PC.1, paragraph 7.

5 p_PC.1, paragraph 7.

6 The Claimant pointed out at the Hearing that there was no evidence for an oral agreement but
correspondence about the deliveries prior to the conclusion of the GPSA; see HT Day 3, p. 40 ef seq.
7 C.PC.1, paragraphs 56-59.

60

Petrobangla and the payments that Petrobangla had to make for
the gas so delivered. The payments that the Claimant seeks in
this arbitration are based on this GPSA. The Claimant made it
quite clear that its payment claim is based on the GPSA and not
on any prior agreement: the “Payment Claim is based on the
GPSA, which contains a provision on force majeure.” !28

189. It is therefore irrelevant for the claim which the Tribunal must
decide whether, under a now superseded informal contractual
arrangement, Niko had an obligation to deliver gas and
Petrobangla had an obligation to pay; and the Tribunal need not
examine the question of whether, when the injunction was
issued on 12 September 2005, Petrobangla was excused for not
meeting any such payment obligations which may have existed
at that time (prior to their being superseded by the GSPA). All
these questions are moot since there is no claim before the
Tribunal that seeks performance of the superseded agreement,
damages for failure of its performance, or interest for delay in
payments that may have been required under it.

190. The claim which the tribunal must determine concerns payment
under the GPSA of 27 December 2006 by reference to the
obligations acknowledged and created under that Agreement
and under the law applicable to obligations under it. Defences
which Petrobangla may have had against obligations under an
earlier tacit or oral agreement are not relevant for this decision.

7.4 Force Majeure defence against payment obligations
under the GPSA

191. Petrobangla takes the position that a force majeure defence
similar to that on which it relies under the prior tacit or oral
agreement can be invoked in defence against its payment
obligations under the GPSA. The Claimant denies that such
defence is available to Petrobangla and argues that Petrobangla
is in default.

7.4.1 The Parties’ positions

While stating, in its principal line of argument, that the
“relevant contract is the oral agreement between the parties, not
the GPSA”,!29 Petrobangla nevertheless also relies on the force
majeure defence as excuse for not paying the invoices under the
GPSA. As explained above, Petrobangla relies on “the doctrine of
force majeure under international general principles of law”,!5°
on “a force majeure excuse under common law” and specifically
on Section 56 of the Bangladesh Contract Act 1872.13!

In the context of the defence against the payment obligations
under the GPSA, Petrobangla also argues that, when it
concluded the GPSA, it considered the injunction as a “short
term obstacle which would end at the conclusion of the BELA
proceedings” and that it did not and could not expect that the
Injunction continued after the BELA case was dismissed.1!32
Petrobangla also argues that it did what could reasonably be
expected of it to “resolve the legal issues as early as possible” .133

The Claimant points out that all the sources on which
Petrobangla relies make a force majeure or similar defence
available only with respect to events which occur subsequently
to the creation of the obligation and were not foreseeable at the
time when the obligation was created. The Claimant also denies
that Petrobangla made reasonable efforts to remove the
injunction. 134

7.4.2 The requirement that the force majeure event _be

unforeseen

The Tribunal has decided for the reasons just explained that,
with respect to claims based on the GPSA, as they are made in
this arbitration by Niko, the “relevant agreement” is the GPSA
and not some earlier oral or tacit agreement. It is therefore, by
reference to this agreement and the time when it was

concluded, that Petrobangla’s force majeure defence must be
considered.

Section 56 of the Bangladesh Contract Act, 1872 on which
Petrobangla relies for its force majeure defence, provides as
follows:

“A contract to do an act which, after the contract is made,
becomes impossible, or, by reason of some event which
the promissor could not prevent, unlawful, becomes void
when the act becomes impossible or unlawful.”!85
(Emphasis added.)

An event relieves the “promissor” of his obligation only if it
occurred after the obligation has been contracted. This is,
indeed, a general feature of force majeure and similar defences,
which normally apply only if the event is unforeseen and
unavoidable.

In the present case, the Parties have regulated the matter in
Article 14 of the GPSA, which provides that a failure to perform
or a delay in performing shall not be considered a default if
performance is “prevented, hindered or delayed” by certain
events which are further defined in Article 14.1.

The list of events specifically identified as force majeure events,
in Article 14.1, include “actions of government or governments”.
In the Tribunal’s view this includes injunctions by the judiciary,
as that by the BELA Court. In any event, Article 14.1.1 generally
refers to acts which are “beyond the control of such Party”, i.e.
the party affected by the event.

However, one of the conditions for considering an impediment
as a case of force majeure is that it “could not be foreseen”. The
specific clause regulating between the Parties the circumstances
under which the defence of force majeure is available confirms
the general principle, that events prior to the conclusion of the
contract, known to the parties and thus “foreseeable”, do not
qualify as force majeure and are no excuse for non-performance.

5 Legal Authority 14 to P-PC.1

201.

202.

203.

204.

This is undisputed and expressly accepted by Petrobangla.
Events which occurred prior to the creation of the obligation do
not provide a force majeure defence. Petrobangla stated it in the
following terms:

“Petrobangla accepts that, in principle, neither the
doctrines of frustration (encapsulated in s.56 of the
Contract Act) nor force majeure apply to events which
pre-date the contract.”15¢

When the GPSA was concluded, the injunction had been in
place for over 15 months. There can therefore not be a question
whether the Parties could foresee a future injunction preventing
payment to Niko; the Parties were fully aware of this
impediment.

Indeed, Petrobangla had expressly relied on the injunction prior
to the conclusion of the GPSA. During the negotiations for the
GPSA, after deliveries of Gas had commenced, Petrobangla
invoked the injunction of the BELA Court in defence against
Niko’s request for payment. In particular, in a letter of 28
November 2005 Petrobangla referred to this order in response to
Niko’s announcement of a suspension of gas deliveries:

“Mr. Justice Md. Abdul Matin & Mr. Justice Md. Rezaul
Haque of the Divisional Bench of the Honorable High
Court Division of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh vide
their order dated November 16, 2005 in the Writ Petition
no. 6911 of 2005 have been pleased to direct as follows:

[follows the Order of 19 October 2005 as quoted above.]

As such we cannot make payment any more until the said
Order of the Court is vacated.”187

Thus, Petrobangla was fully aware of the injunction, long before
it concluded the GPSA. It may not rely on it as an unforeseen
event. Indeed, Petrobangla expressly admits that the force
majeure event on which it relies was known to it at the time
when the GPSA was concluded:

16 p.PC.2, paragraph 32.
7 Exhibit R-13.

64

205.

206.

207.

208.

“There is no dispute that Petrobangla was fully aware of
the judicial supervention (i.e. the interim injunction) at
the time of signing of the GPSA.”!58

The Tribunal concludes that the injunction of the BELA Court is
not a force majeure event on which Petrobangla may rely as a
defence against the claim for the payment of the invoices.

7.4.3 _The risk of a long duration of the injunction

Petrobangla argues that, when it concluded the GPSA it
expected that the injunction would not remain in place for long,
but would be removed shortly thereafter. Petrobangla states
that, at the time the GPSA was signed:

“... Petrobangla considered that the BELA injunction was
simply a short-term measure which would end at the
conclusion of the BELA case. Petrobangla believed that if
the Court dismissed the BELA claim —- as Petrobangla was
arguing that it should - the Court would automatically
discharge the injunction. Petrobangla expected such a
decision by the BELA Court shortly after the signing of
the GPSA.”189

The Tribunal has difficulties in accepting these explanations
since, by the time the GPSA was concluded, the injunction had
been in place for more than 15 months and there were no
apparent signs that the BELA Court or the Appellate Division
would remove it in the near future. Nor were there apparent
signs that the BELA Court, by disposing of the principal action,
would also put an end to the injunction.

There is no indication that the Parties agreed to suspend
Petrobangla’s payment obligation until the BELA action had
been completed and the injunction removed. Quite to the
contrary, Petrobangla made an unconditional and unqualified
commitment to pay for the gas.

8 p.PC.2, paragraph 44.
89 p.PC.2, paragraph 9.

65

209.

210.

211.

In Article 11.1.3 GPSA, Petrobangla commits to pay for the gas
delivered “not later than forty five (45) days from the date of
receiving the invoice”. In addition, Article 2.1 GPSA makes
express provision for the payment of the gas delivered prior to
the effective date of this agreement:

“This Agreement shall be fully effective from the date of its
signing. However, it is acknowledged and agreed that the
delivery of Gas from 2 November, 2004 shall be paid, after
making appropriate adjustments for the payments already
made, within reasonable time following execution of this
Agreement ...”

Petrobangla accepts that this provision is a clear commitment to
make payment. When discussing the 28 November 2005 letter
quoted above, Petrobangla’s counsel explained what, in his view,
the meaning of this passage in the letter was: “I cannot pay
because of this, because of the order, but I will want to pay and
I will pay.” Asked where in the letter it said “we will pay”, he
responded:

“MR GONZALEZ: In the GPSA. There is Article 2.1 in the
GPSA which says ‘ will pay’.

THE PRESIDENT: By saying, ‘We want to conclude the
GPSA’, you make the commitment to pay? Is that what
you are saying?

MR GONZALEZ: It is clear in the language of the GPSA. It
is Article 2.1 and Niko has made extensive submissions to
the obligation to pay.”!4°

The Tribunal fully agrees. In Article 2.1 GPSA Petrobangla
clearly states “I will pay”, just as Article 11.1.3 contains a clear
payment commitment. Both these commitments for payment
are without any condition. Petrobangla confirmed that neither
the GPSA nor any side agreement or declaration conditions the
payment obligation upon the lifting of the injunction:

“THE PRESIDENT: Is there any reference in the agreement
or outside the agreement or the GPSA or outside the

“0 HT Day 3, p. 96.

66

212.

213.

GPSA that would open a defence for not paying by
reference or as a result of the injunction?

MR GONZALEZ: I believe there is not one, not a
reference in the GPSA.

THE PRESIDENT: And outside?
MR GONZALEZ: Not that I am aware of.

THE PRESIDENT: You showed us the letter of
November --

MR GONZALEZ: Apart from the letter of 28
November 2005 which explicitly says, "I cannot pay until
it is lifted, until the order is lifted", that is -- apart from
that I believe there is no other document reflecting the
legal obstacle that Petrobangla was facing.

THE PRESIDENT: Despite this recognition that you
cannot pay in November 2005, Petrobangla concluded an
agreement with an obligation to pay without reservation.

MR GONZALEZ: Apart from the letter of 28
November, no, there is not a reservation on the GPSA, an
explicit -- ”!41

In the absence of any such qualification or reservation,
Petrobangla assumed the risk of any delay in the lifting of the
injunction.

In these circumstances the fact that, contrary to Petrobangla’s
asserted expectation, the injunction was not lifted shortly after
the conclusion of the GPSA and is still in place, does not relieve
Petrobangla of its payment commitment. In particular,
Petrobangla cannot rely on such delay as a force majeure
defence; such a defence applies to events unforeseen at the time
when the obligation is contracted. It does not apply to events
which are known but which last longer than expected.
Petrobangla has not provided any authority under the law of
Bangladesh or any other law to the effect that the
disappointment of hopes or expectations for the early removal of
an impediment constitutes an event of force majeure.

HT Day 3, p. 117.

67

214.

215.

216.

217.

218.

In conclusion on this point, Petrobangla made a firm
commitment to pay for the deliveries in the past (as per Article
2.1) and all future deliveries within 45 days from the receipt of
the invoice. It did so in full knowledge of the injunction and
assumed the risk of delay in its removal. The Tribunal does not
accept that this injunction may serve as justification or excuse,
relieving Petrobangla from the consequences of its failure to
meet it contractual obligation to pay for the gas delivered by
Niko.

7.4.4 The obligation to take “reasonable action to overcome” the
impediment

 

If it were accepted, contrary to the Tribunal’s conclusion, that
Petrobangla was entitled to rely on the injunction as an event of
force majeure, the Tribunal would have to examine whether
Petrobangla complied with the obligations under Article 14.1.3
which provides:

“When any such event or combination of events has
occurred, such Party shall take all reasonable actions to
overcome any cause that prevents, hinders or delays
performance of its obligations and to minimize the
consequences and shall, insofar as is _ practicable,
continue to perform its obligations hereunder.”

As the Claimant pointed out, similar obligations exist in relation
to force majeure and related defences under common law and
other legal principles. !4?

Petrobangla argues that it made “reasonable efforts” to remove
the injunction. It accepts that, to the extent Article 14 of the
GPSA were applicable, it would have been required under Article
14.1.3 to make such efforts. The Claimant strongly contests
that Petrobangla complied with this obligation.

Petrobangla identifies the following steps as actions to overcome
the injunction:

\ See in particular C-PC.2, pp. 31-33.

68

219.

220.

(a) It filed an “Affidavit-in-Opposition in the High Court
Division in the BELA case, arguing that it should
dismiss the proceedings”;!48

(b) It “[clonsidered whether there were any available
lawful means to overcome the injunction”, in
particular by obtaining legal advice from the
Attorney General of Bangladesh and from counsel
at Admiralty Chamber; and assured Niko that it
was “actively considering ways to resolve the legal
issues as early as possible”;

(c) It took “significant steps to support Niko’s attempts
to lift the injunction”; the attempts mentioned
include considering “different ways of making
payment” and inviting others to “take necessary
action”. 144

The Claimant contests that any of these steps can be considered
as serious measures to overcome the injunction and its effects.
Concerning the Affidavit-in-Opposition, the Claimant points out
that in the affidavit “Petrobangla merely laid out its defence to
the merits of the claims [...] Nothing in this affidavit-in-
opposition shows that Petrobangla sought a ‘discharge of the
Rule and vacating the order of injunction”. The Claimant adds
that “at the hearing in the BELA suit, counsel for Petrobangla
did not argue that the injunction against payment should be
modified or lifted.”145

In addition, the Claimant lists a number of steps that
Petrobangla could have taken to press for the review and
revision of the 2005 injunction and the November 2009
judgement and order. When the Claimant filed on 21 August
2008 an application to modify the Interim Order, it invited
Petrobangla to join or support the application. While BAPEX
filed a separate application, Petrobangla did not — nor did it
otherwise intervene in support of the application. !4©

8 Petrobangla relies in this respect on Exhibit R19, an affidavit of 18 March 2009 in opposition
against the BELA Writ Petition No. 6911 of 2005.

4 P_PC.2, pp. 9- 11, P-PC.1, pp 11-15. The matter was also discussed extensively at the hearing, e.g.
HT Day 3, pp. 122 et seq.

‘5 C-PC.2, paragraph 77 and Goyal WS II, paragraph 80.

46 Goyal WS II, paragraphs 77 and 78.

69

221.

222.

223.

At the hearing, Petrobangla provided explanations about the
availability of some of these possible procedural remedies and
the reasons why it did not pursue them. However, none of them
were taken by Petrobangla. On several occasions at the hearing
the question was put to Petrobangla:

“... why did Petrobangla not make an application to the
BELA Court and say, ‘Put an end to the injunction’.”!47

Petrobangla responded that Niko and BAPEX were the
beneficiaries of the payments to be made by Petrobangla and
they applied for a removal of the injunction; but no application
was made by Petrobangla.!48

The Tribunal pointed out that it was the performance of
Petrobangla’s obligation that was affected by the injunction and
that one would expect that it would be above all Petrobangla
which would apply for the stay of the injunction so that it could
perform the obligation as it says it wanted to do. The Tribunal
put the question squarely to Petrobangla’s counsel:

“PROFESSOR PAULSSON: .... It is a_ straightforward
question then it is for Petrobangla to do something about
this impediment ...

[ol]

PROFESSOR MCLACHLAN: I think the Tribunal’s point to
you, Mr Gonzalez, is your submission to us at the outset
is you were then and are still now under an injunction
from the Bangladesh courts, breach of which will expose
your clients to proceedings for contempt of court and it is
that interdiction which prevents you from doing which
you would otherwise wish to do, which is to pay, and the
most straightforward way of resolving that would appear
to be simply to apply yourself to the court to seek to have
the restriction limited in order to enable you to comply
with your contractual obligations.

Of course, you might have applied and failed. The court
might have said no, but what we are on at the moment is

227.

simply the question given that the legal impediment is one
that rests upon you, why not apply?

MR GONZALEZ: In hindsight, of course, why did not we
do this, why did not we do that? Again, I go back to this
test, the test of reasonableness and it says not to do
everything that you can, all that can be done is what was
reasonable and what our submission is let us look at
what Niko was asking Petrobangla to do and in 2007 the

request, Niko’s request and Niko’s understanding was,
149

Counsel then proceeded to discuss ways that Niko sought to
receive payment despite the injunction - a matter quite different
from the question the Tribunal had asked. The central question
remained: why did Petrobangla itself not take any steps to have
the injunction removed by the Court or in appeal?

The Tribunal finds the answer that it received wholly
unsatisfactory. When signing the GPSA on 27 December 2006,
Petrobangla made a firm commitment to pay for the gas
delivered in the past and to pay for future deliveries within 45
days upon receipt of the invoices. If it was prevented from
making such payments it had to take all possible steps to
remove the impediment. The question is not what Niko could or
should have done or what Niko’s understanding was. The
commitment was made by Petrobangla and Petrobangla had to
take the necessary steps in order to be able to perform its
payment obligations.

Since the impediment which Petrobangla invokes is the
injunction, the most obvious and direct step to take for
Petrobangla to overcome the impediment is and continues to be
an application to the competent court requesting that the
injunction be lifted. Neither in response to the Tribunal’s
questions nor at any other occasion did Petrobangla state that it
had taken such a step; nor did it provide any satisfactory
explanation as to why it had failed to take such a step.

The Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla knowingly assumed
the risk of being prevented from making payments by the

4° HT Day 3, pp. 127-129

71

228.

229.

230.

continuing injunction and failed to take any serious steps to
remove this impediment.

7.4.5 Conclusion on the force majeure defence

The Tribunal concludes that Petrobangla made its payment
commitments under the GPSA in full knowledge of the
injunction prohibiting such payments. It took the risk that this
injunction would continue even after the conclusion of the
GPSA. It may not now rely on the injunction as excuse for not
making the payments that it promised to make.

Therefore Petrobangla’s failure to make the contractual
payments is not excused by the defence of force majeure.
Petrobangla is in default of its payment obligations under the
GPSA.

Despite the failure of Petrobangla to make the payments due
under the GPSA, Niko continued delivering gas, month after
month. It did so for over three more years until April 2010,
issuing no less than 40 additional invoices for monthly
deliveries. Petrobangla enjoyed the benefit of these deliveries
without any counterpart. The law and the Contract require that
Petrobangla must pay the agreed price and, since it has failed to
do so, be held liable for this failure.

INTEREST

8.1 The issues in dispute

The Claimant seeks interest at the rate of 5% on all payments
awarded on account of its invoices for gas deliveries pursuant to
the GPSA; simple interest until the date of the award and
monthly compounding thereafter until full payment.
Alternatively, the Claimant adds: “if the Tribunals are minded to
take a complex approach and apply a variable interest rate,
such as one based on LIBOR, the rate it should apply should be
that of sixth-month LIBOR plus 2%”.15°

Petrobangla objects to the interest claim, in particular to the
application of compound interest. It argues that “interest should
only run from the point at which the terms of the Injunction
granted by the High Court Division in the BELA’s Writ Petition
are satisfied”, adding that Petrobangla should not be penalised
for “obeying the law”.!5! As part of the “actions [which] need to
be taken” according to the relief requested by it at the April
2014 hearing, Petrobangla provides for the deposit of amounts
due in an account at a Designated Bank. This account “will be
interest bearing at prevailing interest rates as provided by the
Designated Bank”.

The Tribunal found that Petrobangla committed to make
payments according to the GPSA and that it did so in full
knowledge of the injunction. Petrobangla failed to make these
payments and may not rely on the injunction as excuse for this
failure. Payments are due as per the terms of the GPSA.

The Parties agree that the claim for interest on Niko’s invoices is
governed by Section 61(2) of the Bangladesh 1930 Sale of Goods
Act which provides as follows:

“In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the Court
may award interest at such rate as it thinks fit on the
amount of price —

° C-PC.1, paragraph 19.
15! p.PC.2, paragraph 64.

235.

236.

237.

238.

(a) To the seller in a suit by him for the amount of the
price from the date of the tender of the goods or from
the date on which the price was payable.”

Concerning the starting date for Petrobangla’s obligation to pay
interest, the Tribunal found that all invoiced amounts were due
and payable 45 days after receipt of the respective invoice but
not before 14 May 2007.!52 According to Section 61(2) of the
Sale of Goods Act, these due dates for the payments also
constitute the dates when interest starts running on each of the
invoiced amounts.

With respect to the rate of interest, there is no statutory rate for
payments in default.!55 Both Section 61(2) of the Sale of Goods
Act, quoted above, and Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code
leave it to the courts to fix the rate. The latter provision reads as
follows:

“Where and in so far as a decree is for the payment of
money, the Court may, in the decree, order interest at
such rate as the Court deems reasonable to be paid on
the principal sum adjudged, from the date of the suit to
the date of the decree, in addition to any interest
adjudged on such principal sum for any period prior to
the institution of the suit, when further interest at such
rate as the Court deems reasonable on the aggregate sum
so adjudged, from the date of the decree to the date of
payment or to such earlier date as the Court thinks fit.”

On this basis the courts apply “commercially reasonable rates of
interest”.!54 This is not disputed; the controversy concerns what
is reasonable in the circumstances.

The Parties agree that with respect to the invoices payable in
taka, the rate of 5%, as sought by the Claimant, is reasonable.
Niko claims interest with respect to these invoices at that rate.
At the hearing, Petrobangla explained that “the prevailing
interest rate on saving accounts in taka, it varies from 5 to 8 per

As explained by Petrobangla at the April hearing (HT Day 5, p. 564); confirmed by the Claimant

cent”.!55. The position was confirmed in  Petrobangla’s
submission on interest, where it stated that it “agrees that
should Tribunal decide to award interest, it could consider the
applicable interest rates on BDT deposits which is around 5% at
the moment”.!5¢

The disagreement between the Parties concerns the rate
applicable to the invoices in US Dollars. Here, too, Niko claims
simple interest at 5%, alternatively a LIBOR based rate.!57
Petrobangla argues that the interest should be calculated at
“interest rate provided by commercial banks in Bangladesh on
USD deposits”.'55 The disagreement between the Parties
concerns, first, the question of whether the rates applicable to
debts in taka should apply also to the invoice amounts in
US Dollars and, second, whether the relevant rates should be
those for deposits or for loans.

In support of its interest claim, the Claimant had submitted a
document from the Central Bank of Bangladesh which showed
interest rates paid by commercial banks in Bangladesh during
the period from January 2009 to September 2013.159
Petrobangla argued at the hearing that the rates shown on this
document applied to deposits in taka and were not applicable to
US Dollars.!©° The document indeed does not indicate that the
rates applied by the commercial banks also apply to deposits or
loans in US Dollars.

Prior to the hearing Petrobangla merely contested that any
interest was due and, with respect to interest concerning
US Dollars, stated in its Rejoinder that interest on deposits in
US Dollars was “based on LIBOR” without further
specification.!©!

At the hearing the Claimant, on the basis of a “quick
calculation”, advanced 3.712% as average LIBOR one month
rate from 2007 to 2014. With an appropriate mark-up, this
would confirm the 5% interest rate claimed also for US

Dollars.!©2. Petrobangla requested time to make its own
investigation with the Central Bank.

The Tribunal granted Petrobangla time to make a submission on
interest rates for US Dollars and for a reply by the Claimant.
These submissions were made on 22 May and 6 June 2014,
respectively. Since the Claimant’s submission contained new
allegations and evidence, the Tribunal granted Petrobangla an
opportunity to comment. Petrobangla submitted these
comments on 17 June 2014. The Tribunal considered the two
questions identified above in light of these submissions,
together with the argument raised in prior submissions and at
the April 2014 hearing.

8.2 Do the commercial interest rates for taka deposits
apply to the claim in US Dollars?

Concerning the application of the agreed rates for taka debts to
the invoices in US Dollars, Petrobangla argued that, when
determining the applicable interest rate, a distinction must be
made according to the “relevant currency”.!® It stated:

“Our submission is that a court in Bangladesh will
normally commercially look at the interest rate that is
prevailing in Bangladesh. Therefore, because it is US
dollar amount the interest rate will be what the Central
Bank says on that —”!64

Petrobangla produced a number of documents from commercial
banks and from the Bangladesh Bank (Central Bank of
Bangladesh). The documents from the commercial banks
showed that, depending on the currency, different interest rates
were quoted. The Bangladesh Bank wrote to the Respondents’
counsel on 20 May 2014, explaining the “Interest on foreign
currency accounts held in Bangladesh” and attached an extract
of the Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Transactions (2009)
edition, spelling out “the basis on which Authorised Dealer
Banks pay interest on foreign currency deposits in accounts
held with them”. The letter continued:

163

P-PC Interest.1, paragraph 4,

'6t HT Day 5, p. 571.

76

246.

247.

248.

“As per regulation referred above, Authorized Dealer
Banks can pay interest on such accounts at the prevailing
Eurocurrency deposit rates. Bangladesh Bank does not fix
interest rates on deposits. Interest rate depends on the
length of time and amount of deposits. Authorized Dealer
Banks apply interest rate on foreign currency deposits
based on their interest earnings against their deposits
placed in international markets. ...”165

The Tribunal concludes that information provided by the
Bangladesh Bank on interest rates distinguishes between rates
for deposits in taka and those in foreign currencies. The
publication on which the Claimant relied for the calculation of
the claimed interest concerns deposits in taka and does not
apply to deposits in US Dollars or other currencies.

The distinction of interest rates according to currencies, as
applied by the Bangladesh Bank, reflects economic reality:
interest rates for a debt in a certain currency are related to the
corresponding economy and thus may vary from one currency
to another, reflecting for instance differences in the rate of
inflation. Irmgard Marboe, in the study on which the Claimant
relies, mentions as an example, the differences in LIBOR rates
for US Dollars and Euros and concludes that “the choice of
currency also plays an important role for the determination of
the interest rate”.166

The Tribunal concludes that the interest rates applicable to
deposits in taka, on which the Claimant relied, are not
applicable for determining interest on the amount due in
US Dollars by Petrobangla. The rates applicable for the
calculation of interest on that amount must be determined
separately by reference to deposits or debts in US Dollars.

8.3 The relevant rate for the debt in US Dollars - rates for
deposits or for loans?

When determining the relevant rate for Petrobangla’s debt in US
Dollars, both Parties refer to LIBOR rates. With its submission
on Interest the Claimant produced a table for LIBOR rates from
January 2007 to May 2014. During this period the six-month
rates varied between a high of 5.40140% in January 2007 anda
low of 0.38780% in February 2010; the average calculated by
the Claimant for this period is 1.57446%.

Petrobangla stated that “interest is paid on one month deposit
in US dollar based on LIBOR’.!67 In its submission on interest
Petrobangla explained that

“... interest rate on USD deposits varies from bank to
bank. Since banks would normally get interest at the rate
of LIBOR on their deposits placed with international
banks, the usual practice for a bank in Bangladesh is,
determine a suitable margin for itself taking into account
its own balance sheet position and then determining
interest rate on UDS [sic] deposits by deducting the
margin from LIBOR.”!68

Later Petrobangla clarified:

« a commercial bank in Bangladesh, while giving
interest on USD deposit would apply ‘LIBOR minus
margin’ approach and it is submitted that the Tribunal
should also opt for the same.”!©

The Claimant also referred to LIBOR, but it claimed a premium
on the published rate. It referred to “the differing credit and
country risks”!7° and explained

“Niko found itself in the position of involuntarily loaning
to Petrobangla an ever increasing sum of money for
almost a decade”.!7!

GPSA, it would have reinvested that money into its
business and generated additional returns at rates
significantly higher than 5% per year. In other words, the
gas payments that Niko should have been receiving each
month since 2004 would have earned returns on
investment, but for Petrobangla’s failure to pay.”!72

The Parties agree that LIBOR rates reflect rates between banks
and are not rates at which Niko or Petrobangla normally may
borrow or lend on the market. The principal issue which the
Tribunal must resolve is whether interest must be calculated by
reference to the Claimant’s approach of “LIBOR plus”, as it
would apply when Niko borrows US Dollars from a bank in
Bangladesh, or at “LIBOR minus” when it would make a deposit
in US Dollars in a such a bank.

When proposing the “LIBOR minus approach”, Petrobangla
argues that it “has been an agreed position of both parties that,
if interest is to be allowed then the appropriate benchmark
would be to consider interest rates given respectively to BDT
deposits and USD deposits by commercial banks in
Bangladesh”; it added that “both Petrobangla and Niko have
submitted interest rates should be linked with interest on
deposits as opposed to interest on lending by commercial
banks”.173

The Tribunal has considered the passage on which Petrobangla
relies when making this affirmation and examined whether it
justifies the conclusion that the Claimant accepted in a binding
manner interest calculation at LIBOR minus. When it first
specified its interest claim, the Claimant indicated a fixed rate of
5%, applicable for both taka and US Dollars. It explained that
interest rates for commercial banks in Bangladesh “were
diverse”. It referred to the tables published by the Bangladesh
Bank mentioned above,!7* and, without presenting any

calculation, proposed the rate of 5%.!75 That calculation may
have been based on rates for varying deposits, but it did not
constitute an acceptance by the Claimant of a “LIBOR minus
approach”, as now applied by Petrobangla.

The Tribunal therefore has no agreed position adopted by both
Parties on which it may rely, but must consider the respective
positions of the Parties, as they were proposed in the
submissions on Interest.

Neither Party has provided any explanation concerning the
factual solution adopted in the circumstances and_ the
alternatives in case the payments would have been made. It is
therefore not known whether Niko had to borrow money to
compensate the amounts withheld by Petrobangla or whether it
would have invested them in operations which would have been
more profitable than US Dollar deposits in Bangladesh.

In this situation the Tribunal, following Section 61(2) of the
Bangladesh Sales of Goods Act, considers what would be
reasonable in the circumstances. In applying such a broad
discretion to the case of an unpaid contract debt the Tribunal is
guided by the objective that the successful party should be
compensated for having been kept out of its money to which it
was entitled.

This objective cannot adequately be achieved by limiting the
compensation to that which the creditor would have obtained by
depositing the funds in a bank account. This is only one of the
options which a creditor has if the debtor makes timely
payment. Especially for a commercial company such a deposit
may well be the least attractive option. Normally such a
company can be expected to invest the money in its business,
as the Claimant states that it would have done.!76

The debtor’s failure to make payment deprives the creditor of
the options which it would have if the payment is made.
Therefore the Tribunal considers that the appropriate reference
is to determine the costs which the creditor would have had to
incur in order to obtain the funds which would provide these

263.

options and of which the creditor was deprived by the debtor’s
failure to pay. For these reasons, the Tribunal takes as
reference the rate at which the Claimant would have had to
borrow the funds.!77

Where, as here, the debt was expressly payable in Bangladesh,
the Tribunal considers that it is the situation in Bangladesh
which has to be considered. The proper approach is therefore to
determine the rate or rates at which Niko could have borrowed
US dollars from a commercial bank in Bangladesh.

The evidence on US Dollar related interest rates produced by
Petrobangla, while confirming the reference to LIBOR as a
“benchmark”,!78 concerns the conditions at which banks accept
deposits and not the conditions at which they lend in US
Dollars. For the Tribunal’s decision they are therefore not
helpful.

The Claimant produced an extract of the 2012/2013 Annual
Report of Bangladesh Bank in which the activities of the Export
Development Fund (EDF) are described. The Fund is intended to
provide to authorised dealer (AD) banks foreign currency
facilities which these lend to Bangladesh exporters. The report
explains the conditions at which these facilities are provided:

“The interest rate on USD under EDF is charged at six-
month LIBOR+2.5 percent out of which LIBOR+1 percent
is for EDF and the rest 1.5 percent is for concerned AD
banks.”!79

Petrobangla confirmed that the rates quoted in this passage are
rates “charged from a customer who borrows from the
Authorised Dealer under the EDF facility”. !8°

"7 This is also the position taken under English law, applying a statutory discretion in similar terms to
the Bangladesh statutes: Peter Cremer v General Carriers SA [1973] 2 Lloyd's Rep 366, 376 per Kerr
J. See also CHITTY on Contracts, vol. I, 30" ed. (2008), 26-178 who conclude from this case that the
Commercial Court awards “interest at a rate which broadly represents the rate at which the successful
party would have had to borrow the amount recovered over the period in question”.

It follows that a commercial enterprise in Bangladesh seeking to
borrow US Dollars may obtain from the EDF programme
facilities at LIBOR +2.5 %. The Tribunal takes this as a credible
representation of commercial conditions in Bangladesh for the
interest on US Dollar loans. The rate of six-month LIBOR plus
2%, as sought by the Claimant, thus is a reasonable rate in the
context of commercial conditions in Bangladesh.

The Claimant also produced extracts from a Production Sharing
Contract concluded by the Government of Bangladesh and
Petrobangla with several other companies which provides under
the heading of “Late Payments” that “overdue payments shall
bear interest at LIBOR plus two percent (2%) ...”.18! The
definitions contained in that contract clarify that reference is
made to six month deposits for US Dollars.!82 Petrobangla
objects that this contract is not applicable in the present
dispute. The Tribunal agrees. However, it takes the rate
provided in this contract as an indication that default interest at
the rate of six month LIBOR + 2%, as claimed by the Claimant,
is commercially not unreasonable.

On the basis of these considerations, the Tribunal concludes
that Petrobangla must pay interest on the outstanding invoices
at six-month LIBOR + 2% for the US Dollar amounts and at 5%
for the amounts in taka.

Throughout the proceedings the Claimant sought simple
interest on the outstanding payments for the period up to the
award. Only for the period thereafter it sought interest at “an
annual rate of 5 percent compounded monthly until the award
is paid in full’.!85 In its Observations on Applicable Interest
dated 6 June 2014, the Claimant confirmed the claim for simple
pre-award interest at the annual rate of 5%.

However, in this very last submission the Claimant added: “if a
commercial rate such as [the LIBOR + 2%] is applied, the
commercial practice of compounding of interest should also be
applied”; it stated that “it would be logical and fair, to

compound interest on a monthly basis to correspond to the
period in which the LIBOR rate is updated in the calculation”.184+

Petrobangla responded by stating that the claim for monthly
compounding “is not either reasonable nor is supported by any
of the materials produced by Niko and therefore should be
rejected”. 185

As explained above, the proceedings on the Payment Claim were
closed at the end of the April 2014 hearing. The submissions
which were authorised thereafter were limited to the narrow
question of the interest rate in Bangladesh for US Dollar debts.
The question of single or compound interest had not been raised
before and was not part of what was allowed as additional
submission at that stage.

Moreover, even in this limited submission on interest rates after
the hearing, Niko stated expressly that it “maintains its position
that interest at a simple annual rate of 5 percent is reasonable
...”186 and confirmed its request that “it is fair to award interest
at a simple annual rate of 5 percent ...”.187 It was only in the
alternative that the Tribunal would award interest at a rate
fluctuating with LIBOR that Niko for the first time requested
that pre-award interest be compounded monthly.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal does not consider the
Claimant’s new claim for pre-award compound interest as
admissible. Moreover, the Claimant having confirmed even after
the hearing its claim for simple interest at the flat 5% rate, the
Tribunal sees no justification for granting compound interest for
the alternative LIBOR + 2% rate.

In denying the Claimant’s request for compound pre-award
interest, the Tribunal does not express any position as to the
question whether compound interest can or must be awarded
under the law of Bangladesh or in ICSID proceedings. It leaves
open the question of whether compound interest should be paid
for the period after the notification of the decision.

As explained in the following section, the Tribunal invites the
Parties to consult with the objective of an interim arrangement,
dealing inter alia with the principal and interest subject of this
decision. If that arrangement is found, the question of interest
most likely will become moot. If the Parties fail to reach an
agreement, the Parties may have to consider the matter further
and, in this context, may also consider the question of whether
compound interest must be paid on the amount due according
to the present decision.

In conclusion, the Tribunal awards simple interest and reserves

the question of compound interest for the period after the
notification of the decision.

THE FUTURE OF THE INJUNCTION AND A POSSIBLE
INTERIM REGIME

The Tribunal has concluded that, in the circumstances of the
present case, the injunction prohibiting payment to Niko is a
risk assumed by Petrobangla against which it failed to take
adequate action and which does not excuse its failure to make
payment under the GPSA. This being said, the injunction is still
in place and, under the law of Bangladesh, is binding on
Petrobangla.

The injunction prohibits Petrobangla and the other respondents
in the BELA suit to make payment to Niko; and it defines its
term:

“This order of injunction shall remain in force till disposal
of the money suit or till amicable settlement amongst the
parties, whichever is earlier.”!8%

The Claimant argues that, according to this order, “all
Petrobangla need do in order to be able to make payment to
Niko is to agree with Niko”.189

The Claimant also argues that such amicable settlement can be
brought about on the basis of the dispute settlement clauses in
the JVA and the GPSA. Article 13 of the GPSA requires the
parties to “make their best efforts to settle amicably through
consultation any dispute arising in connection with the
performance or interpretation of any provision of this
Agreement”. If they fail to settle their dispute amicably, the
dispute may be referred to arbitration and the arbitral tribunal
takes their place in providing the settlement.!%°

Now that the Tribunal has resolved the central point of
disagreement between the Parties and decided that Petrobangla
may not rely on a force majeure defence, the Tribunal does not
exclude that the Parties reach the amicable settlement referred
to in the order of the BELA Court. The Tribunal is encouraged in
this belief by the fact that, at the April 2014 hearing, the Parties

282.

283.

were able to resolve their difference with respect to their
respective requests for provisional measures and made a joint
application which the Tribunal transformed into Procedural
Order No. 6 of 1 May 2014.

Therefore, the Tribunal invites the Parties to seek an amicable
settlement which would satisfy the order of the BELA Court and
permit Petrobangla to meet its payment obligations under the
GPSA. If the Parties were unable to reach such an amicable
settlement, the Tribunal will have to decide and, in this context
will have to address the various interim arrangements which the
Claimant has set out in some of its alternative claims.

It may be of assistance to the Parties if the Tribunal, at this
stage and without wishing to restrict the Parties in their search
for the terms and conditions of their amicable settlement, make
some preliminary observations concerning possible elements of
a settlement arrangement and the Tribunal’s powers to order
them if the Parties fail to reach agreement.

As to possible elements of interim arrangements which the
Parties may agree or, in the absence of such agreement, the
Tribunal may order, it may be useful to consider the following
elements:

(a) Petrobangla has agreed in Article 11.1.4 GPSA to pay
in US Dollars an agreed share of the amounts due for
the gas delivered under the GPSA. As a foreign
currency payment, the amounts due to Niko in that
currency must therefore be freely available.

(b) The Tribunal has been seized of the Claimant’s request
for the Compensation Declaration and, concluding
from the Parties’ submissions made until now, expects
that Niko’s liability for damage caused by the two blow
outs and the quantum of such damage will have to be
addressed. If Niko were found liable for some or all of
that damage, one of the Claimant’s alternative claims,
which expressly refers to the possibility of setting off
claims for compensation of such damage against the
amounts owed under the Payment Claim, would have
to be considered. In the context of the now pending

86

(¢)

(d)

(e)

issues, interim arrangements may have to make
allowance for this possibility.

Niko has made commitments that, at least for the time
being, it will not remove assets from Bangladesh and,
at repeated occasions, Niko has agreed that the
amounts due from Petrobangla “would be used by the
Joint Venture to fund further work as prescribed by
the JVA”.!9! Any such assignment of the funds, if
agreed between the Parties, could be regulated in the
interim arrangement.

Funds payable by Petrobangla may have to be placed
into an escrow account at a bank and at terms to be
agreed, and the conditions for their release may have
to be fixed. These conditions may include the use of
the funds for the purposes of the JVA.

The question of the term of Petrobangla’s obligation to
pay interest may have to be addressed, for instance by
determining that payment of the outstanding amounts
into an escrow account or their reinvestment for the
purposes of the JVA work terminates Petrobangla’s
obligation to pay interest.

For good order’s sake it may be proper that the Parties
jointly notify the High Court Division having issued the
injunction, informing it of any settlement and,
possibly, requesting jointly the termination of the order
prohibiting payment to Niko as contained in the
Judgment of 17 November 2009.

284. The preceding considerations have arisen from the Parties’

285.

explanations and arguments. They are provisional and the
Tribunal may reconsider them when making any order for
provisional measures, or any substantive decision, in the event
the Parties fail to reach agreement.

Concerning the powers of the Tribunal, it should be recalled
that Petrobangla and BAPEX, exercising rights and powers of
the Government as described in the Preambles of the JVA and

! See e.g. Goyal WS II, paragraph 79.

87

286.

287.

288.

289.

290.

referred to in the GPSA, have agreed in the GPSA to submit all
disputes with Niko to ICSID arbitration. In its Decision on
Jurisdiction, the Tribunal found that it has jurisdiction to
decide Niko’s claim against Petrobangla under the GPSA. This
includes jurisdiction with respect to Provisional Measures
according to Article 47 of the ICSID Convention and Rule 39 of
the ICSID Arbitration Rules, including such measures which the
Tribunal may recommend on its own initiative.

The jurisdiction of the present Tribunal is exclusive with respect
to the merits of the dispute validly brought before it. Since the
Parties have not availed themselves of the possibility afforded
under Rule 39 (6) of the ICSID Arbitration Rules to request
provisional measures from judicial or other authorities, the
Tribunal’s exclusive jurisdiction also extends to provisional
measures.

By virtue of its ratification, the People’s Republic of Bangladesh
and all of its organs, including the courts, are bound by the
ICSID Convention and must give effect to awards rendered in
ICSID arbitration.

When the High Court Division and the Appellate Division of the
Bangladesh Supreme Court were seized of issues affecting the
contractual relationship between Niko and Petrobangla, and
when they issued and partially confirmed the injunction against
payment to Niko, the present arbitration had not yet
commenced. As far as the Tribunal was able to determine from
the procedural records of these court proceedings as they were
filed in the present proceedings, no reference was made in the
Bangladesh court proceedings to the existence of the
contractual provision which required that disputes under the
GPSA be submitted to ICSID arbitration.

Now that the present ICSID Tribunal has been seized of the
Payment Dispute, a new situation has arisen. The payments
which Niko must make under the GPSA must be decided by this
Tribunal, including any injunctions against such payments.

The present Tribunal has no reason to believe that, when this
exclusive jurisdiction, founded on the ICSID Convention, is
brought to the attention of the courts in Bangladesh, in
particular the High Court Division having issued the injunction,

88

291.

these courts would disregard the international obligations
assumed by Bangladesh when adhering to that Convention.

The Tribunal is confident that the present Decision on the
Payment Claim settles the dispute with respect to that claim
and that the remaining issues should be susceptible to a
mutually acceptable resolution crafted by the Parties
themselves. The Tribunal nevertheless remains seized of the
dispute in the event such a resolution is not achieved.
