General Remarks

The Tribunal acknowledges at the outset that this arbitration has taken a very long time.
However, there are many reasons for this which the Tribunal believes are worth noting at

the outset.

Two key reasons arose from the damages estimates in both the primary claim and in the
environmental and infrastructure counterclaims. With respect to the former, the Tribunal
concluded after the Quantum Hearing that consideration of the damages claimed by
Perenco required further in-depth work and the adjustment of the financial models that had

been used by the Parties’ experts during the quantum phase.

In the counterclaims proceedings, which continued separately, the Parties were requested
to attempt to negotiate a settlement based on the findings of law and fact made in the
Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim, failing which the Tribunal would appoint an
independent expert to assist in evaluating Blocks 7 and 21 (“Blocks”) and estimating any
environmental damage assessed in accordance with the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.
A negotiated settlement proved not to be possible. It took the Parties some time to jointly
identify a suitable independent expert who could be appointed by the Tribunal, as

contemplated in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.

This Independent Expert was to assess the work performed by the Parties’ experts and to
conduct further sampling in Ecuador in accordance with the Tribunal’s findings set out in
the Interim Decision on Counterclaim. This work was conducted from August to mid-
December 2017 and the Independent Expert Report was not received until 19 December
2018. Thereafter, the Tribunal gave the Parties an opportunity to insert comments into the
Independent Expert Report as well as to submit general comments on his work, and
convened a two-day hearing in The Hague at which the Independent Expert provided a 90-
minute presentation of his findings and responded to the Parties’ written comments, after

which the Parties were given opportunities to put questions to the Independent Expert. The

49.

50.

51.

Tribunal then deliberated in respect of the counterclaims, considered the Parties’

submissions on costs, and finalised this Award.

In light of the foregoing, in the Tribunal’s view, it made sense to deal with all outstanding

damages issues in a single Award.

The Tribunal acknowledges that this has been too slow a process for at least one of the

Parties, but when substantial amounts have been claimed (approximately US$1.5 billion in

the principal claim and US$2.5 billion in the counterclaim), careful consideration and due

deliberation is required.

The Request for Arbitration was filed on 30 April 2008.

This was registered on 4 June 2008.

An Amended Request for Arbitration was filed on 28 July 2008.

The Tribunal was constituted on 21 November 2008.

The first session was held on 7 February 2009.

The Request for Provisional Measures was filed on 19 February 2009.

A hearing on provisional measures was held in Paris on 19 March 2009 which
resulted in a 41-page decision of the Tribunal on 8 May 2009 (“Decision on
Provisional Measures”).

One arbitrator resigned on 16 December 2009 and the proceedings were suspended.
The arbitrator was replaced by Mr. Neil Kaplan CBE QC SBS on 13 January 2010.

The late Lord Bingham, who presided over the first phase of the arbitration,
resigned due to ill health on 17 February 2010. H.E. Judge Peter Tomka was
appointed by the Chairman of the Administrative Council on 6 May 2010.

A hearing on jurisdiction was held in The Hague on 2-4 November 2010. The
Tribunal rendered its first Decision on Jurisdiction, some 44 pages, on 30 June
2011.

While the primary claim was in train, on 5 December 2011, Ecuador filed
counterclaims for alleged environmental harm and infrastructure damages. This
was fully briefed by the Parties and a hearing was held in The Hague commencing
9 September 2013 and concluding on 17 September 2013.

After further briefing by the Parties, the hearing on the merits of the primary claim
coupled with the remaining jurisdictional issues which had been set over to the

merits phase, was heard in The Hague commencing on 8 November 2012 and
concluding on 16 November 2012. The Decision on Liability, running to 234 pages,
was dispatched to the Parties on 12 September 2014. Some delay in the rendering
of this decision was occasioned by the translation of the English original into
Spanish.

On 19 December 2014, Ecuador sought a reconsideration of the Tribunal’s Decision
on Liability. After receiving submissions from the Parties, the request was
considered and then dismissed in a 24-page decision on 10 April 2015.

On 11 August 2015, an Interim Decision on Counterclaim running to 187 pages and
which also had to be translated into Spanish running to 211 pages was dispatched
to the Parties.

As noted above, the Tribunal instructed the Parties to consider the findings of law
and fact made in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim with a view to encouraging
them to negotiate a settlement in light of the Tribunal’s findings. The Parties agreed
to do so but were unable to arrive at a settlement. As a result, the Tribunal proceeded
to act in accordance with the alternative process envisaged in the Interim Decision
on counterclaim, namely, that it would appoint its own expert to evaluate the
environmental condition of the two Blocks.

The damages phase of this arbitration was heard for one week in Paris commencing
9 November 2015.

The oral closing submissions on damages was heard in The Hague on 21 April 2016.

Immediately following the closing submissions on damages, the Tribunal
conducted its first set of in-person deliberations on quantum. In the course of doing
so, it concluded that having regard to the work undertaken by the Parties’ quantum
experts up to closing submissions, the further elaboration of that work was in order
and correspondence on this matter with the Parties ensued.

Shortly after the Quantum Hearing for the primary claim, having consulted on the
matter, on 25 April 2016, the Parties jointly proposed to the Tribunal the
appointment of Mr. Scott MacDonald of Ramboll as the Tribunal-appointed expert
to conduct the sampling contemplated by the Tribunal in the event that the Parties
could not agree on a settlement of the environmental counterclaim. The Tribunal
conferred with Mr. MacDonald as to how he would approach the exercise in light
of the Tribunal’s instructions laid out in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.

On 6 July 2016, Mr. MacDonald was appointed as the Tribunal’s Independent
Expert by Procedural Order No. 16.

From | November 2016 to 5 November 2016, Mr. MacDonald visited Ecuador to
inspect the two Blocks for purposes of working out his subsequent work plan.

The Tribunal continued its quantum deliberations at a meeting held on 25 and 26
November 2016 and further analytical work ensued.

On 7 February 2017, the Burlington tribunal rendered its Decision on
Reconsideration and Award.! After reflection, the Tribunal decided to seek the
Parties’ views as to what, if anything, in that award was relevant to the Tribunal’s
consideration of the matters before it, given that Burlington and Perenco constituted
the members of the Consortium which operated Blocks 7 and 21 and many of the
facts are common to the two disputes. Submissions on the point were received from
the Parties on 18 April 2017.

Also on 18 April 2017, Perenco filed its First Dismissal Application. Perenco
submitted with respect to the environmental and infrastructure counterclaim that the
Burlington award was res judicata for the Parties to the present proceeding and thus
the Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim had been overtaken by the
Burlington tribunal’s determinations of the Consortium’ liability (as established in
a claim brought by Ecuador against Perenco’s fellow Consortium member and
alleged privy, Burlington). It asserted that therefore the environmental expert’s
work should be terminated.

The Tribunal laid down a schedule for further submissions on the point by both
Parties, which was transmitted to the Parties on 3 May 2017, after the Parties failed
to agree on a schedule.

On 23 May 2017, Ecuador filed a response to Perenco’s First Dismissal
Application.

On 10 and 11 June 2017, the Tribunal held an in-person deliberation on quantum in
The Hague.

On 13 June 2017, Perenco submitted a reply on Ecuador’s response to Perenco’s
First Dismissal Application.

On 4 July 2017, Ecuador submitted a rejoinder thereto.
On 18 August 2017, the Tribunal dismissed Perenco’s First Dismissal Application.

Meanwhile, starting on August 2017, Mr. MacDonald and his team began
conducting field work at identified sites for the purpose of preparing the sampling
activities.

On 30 January 2018, Perenco filed its Second Dismissal Application. This was on
the basis that Burlington’s settlement with Ecuador, and payment in full of
Burlington and Perenco’s joint debt on the counterclaims, extinguished whatever
joint liability Perenco as well as Burlington had to Ecuador, and rendered Ecuador’s
further pursuit of the counterclaims moot.

Burlington Resources Inc. v. Republic of Ecuador, \CSID Case No. ARB/08/5, Decision on Reconsideration
and Award, 7 February 2017 (“Burlington award”), CA-CC-60. The Burlington tribunal also issued on the
same date a Decision on C ims, CA-CC-59 (“Burli Decision on Ci ims”) which was
made an integral part of the Burlington award.

(gg) On 5 February 2018, following the Tribunal’s invitation, Ecuador provided its
comments on the Second Dismissal Application and proposed an alternative
briefing schedule following the Parties’ failure to agree on a briefing schedule.

(hh) On 8 February 2018 and on 12 February 2018, the Parties provided further
comments on the way forward with the Second Dismissal Application.

(ii) On 15 February 2018, the Tribunal laid down the briefing schedule after
considering the Parties’ comments and decided that Mr. MacDonald’s work was to
continue. There would be no disclosure in relation to the application nor an oral
hearing.

Gi) Pursuant to this, on 15 March 2018, Ecuador filed its response to Perenco’s Second
Dismissal Application.

(kk) On 5 April 2018, Perenco filed its Reply.
ab On 26 April 2018, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder.

(mm) On 30 July 2018, the Tribunal issued its Decision on Perenco’s Second Dismissal
Application, deciding, by a majority, to reject the application.

(nn) On 19 December 2018, after receiving the Independent Expert Report, the Tribunal
dispatched it to the Parties to seek their comments thereon. After receiving the
Parties’ comments thereon, and as requested by the Parties, the Tribunal held a
hearing on the Independent Expert Report on 11-12 March 2019. The Tribunal also
met on 13-15 March 2019 and 3 June 2019 for the final in-person meetings.

(00) On 19 April and 10 May 2019, the Tribunal received the Parties’ costs submissions
and reply costs submissions in the form requested by the Tribunal.

The following comments are apropos:

(a) There have been a total of 7 hearings in this case;

(b) The pleadings in this case have been voluminous and have run to not less than 3816
pages;

(c) There have been no less than 55 witness statements running to not less than 1028
pages excluding exhibits;

(d) The experts’ reports in this case total 53. They run in total to no less than 2539
pages excluding exhibits;

(e) The evidential record in this arbitration, excluding the items listed above, exceeds
125,302 pages; and

(f) There have been numerous interlocutory skirmishes between the Parties,
unfortunately caused by lack of agreement between them on a number of procedural
issues, which have occupied the Tribunal’s time.

As recorded above, since the completion of the written and oral pleadings, the Tribunal has

deliberated in-person as well as by electronic means. This has been a complex and hard-

fought case. The Tribunal has considered all the points raised by the Parties even though it

has only referred to the most important submissions and points for purposes of its Award.

Part II of this Award contains the Tribunal’s assessment of the damages due to Perenco
for the breaches of Treaty and contract. Part III contains the Tribunal’s assessment of the
damages payable by Perenco to Ecuador for the environmental damage caused by the
Consortium’s operations. Part IV contains the Tribunal’s consideration of the
infrastructure counterclaim by Ecuador. Part V contains the Tribunal’s decision on the
Parties’ respective claims and submissions on costs. This Award follows on from the
Tribunal’s 30 June 2011 Decision on Jurisdiction, the 12 September 2014 Decision on
Liability, the 10 April 2015 Decision on Reconsideration, the 11 August 2015 Interim
Decision on Counterclaim, the decisions on Perenco’s two requests for dismissal of the
Respondent’s counterclaims of 18 August 2017 and of 30 July 2018, and all of them should

be read with and taken as an integral part of this Award.

DAMAGES CLAIMED IN RELATION TO THE BREACH OF THE TREATY AND
THE PARTICIPATION CONTRACTS

The Parties’ Positions in the Damages Phase

The damages phase follows from the Tribunal’s Decision on Liability in which the
dispositif declared that the following breaches had occurred: (i) breach of the Block 7 and
21 Participation Contracts” in respect of Law 42 at 99%, (ii) breach of the Block 21

Participation Contract as a result of the declaration of caducidad; (iii) breach of Article 4

See Contract Modifying the Service Contract to a Participation for the Exploration and Exploitation of
Hydrocarbons in Block 7 of the Amazon Region, including the Contract for the Coca-Payamino Unified Field
(“Block 7 Participation Contract”) and the Participation Contract for the Exploration and Exploitation of
Hydrocarbons in Block 21 of the Amazon Region (“Block 21 Participation Contract”). Collectively
referred to as the “Participation Contracts” or “PSCs.”

of the Treaty? in respect of Law 42 at 99%, and (iv) breach of Article 6 of the Treaty as a

result of the declaration of caducidad.*

1. The Claimant’s Position

With Ecuador’s responsibility having been engaged, Perenco initially requested an Award

of US$1.572 billion in damages.*

Relying upon the testimony of Mr. John Crick (an advisor to the Chief Executive Officer
of Perenco®), the expert reports of Dr. Richard Strickland, and the expert economic and
financial reports of Professor Joseph Kalt of Compass Lexecon, Perenco claimed that it is
entitled to US$1.572 billion, calculated on an ex post basis, to compensate it for its losses

arising out of Ecuador’s breaches of its international law and contractual obligations.

Perenco’s Request for Arbitration had sought declarations that obligations under the Treaty
and the Participation Contracts had been breached, an order that Ecuador declare null and
void the relevant measures, the reinstatement of Perenco’s rights under the Participation
Contracts, an order that Ecuador abide by and perform the terms of the Participation
Contracts, and damages.’ Perenco had also sought Provisional Measures against Ecuador,
seeking to restrain any action to collect Law 42 dues as well as any action to amend,

rescind, terminate or repudiate the Participation Contracts.*

Agreement between the Government of the French Republic and the Government of the Republic of Ecuador
on the Reciprocal Promotion and Protection of Investments (“Treaty” or “BIT”).

Decision on Liability, paragraph 606 and paragraph 713, in particular, paragraphs 713(4), (6), (8), (12) and
(14). The Tribunal also found that certain acts of Ecuador taken between the application of Decree 662 and
caducidad also violated the fair and equitable treatment standard.

CL. Rep. Q., paragraph 278(b): updated proxy date of 1 July 2015 (and other adjustments).

Crick WS II, paragraph 1. Mr. Crick joined Perenco in 1986 and was responsible for all of the geoscience
aspects of the company’s growth until 1995. From 1995 to 2003, Mr. Crick was the technical manager
responsible for the geoscience aspects of the company’s development activity. In 2003, he created and headed
a long-term planning group. He has been in his present position since 2008. (See also Crick WS II, paragraph
4).

Request for Arbitration dated 30 April 2008, paragraph 42; Amended Request for Arbitration dated 28 July

Application for Provisional Measures dated 19 February 2009.

62.

Due to various events, the nature of the relief sought changed over time. Ultimately, when
it came to the quantum phase, Perenco no longer sought reinstatement of its rights under
the Participation Contracts, which had been terminated in July 2010, but instead sought
damages “in an amount that would wipe out all the consequences of Respondent’s illegal
acts and re-establish the situation which would have existed if those acts had not been
committed, valued as of the date of the award, in the amount of US$1.6984 billion, subject
to updating closer to the date of the award.” This amount was then adjusted to US$1.572

billion.!°

This figure of US$1.572 billion was further adjusted downwards to US$1.423 billion as of
18 April 2016. During closing arguments at the Quantum Closing, counsel for the Claimant

stated that:

“.,.with current oil prices, Perenco, in an extension scenario, we have to
confess, likely would not have pursued the Coca and Payamino
waterfloods. ... in the but-for world, Perenco would be developing these
waterfloods as we speak at this time, and in today’s world of relatively low
oil prices, those wells would likely not be economic. Perenco, therefore,
has to be true to the ex post principles that it has espoused, and we feel it’s
a matter of integrity, and, therefore, we would leave those projects to the
side or suggest that you do in valuing damages in an extension case.”!!

Perenco also requests that post-award interest be at commercial, annually compounding
rates, that Ecuador pay all legal and related costs, and all amounts paid by Ecuador pursuant
to the Award be net of any Ecuadorian tax or other fiscal obligations. Finally, Perenco also

seeks dismissal of Ecuador’s counterclaims.

As the damages phase progressed, Professor Kalt helpfully set out his view of the principal

points that divided the Parties. As shown in the table extract from his fourth expert report: !”

2. The Respondent’s Position

The Respondent has requested the following different forms of relief, depending upon the
Tribunal’s findings on key issues. In sum and primarily, it requests that no compensation
be awarded to Perenco in order to account for the unpaid amounts of Law 42 dues that
Perenco owes Ecuador.'* However, should the Tribunal be inclined to award any
compensation at all, such compensation should be calculated in accordance with Ecuador’s

submissions. !°

In response to Professor Kalt, the Respondent’s experts, Professor James Dow and Mr.
Richard Caldwell of The Brattle Group (“Brattle”), presented a “waterfall chart” (the
“Waterfall Chart’) depicting the effects on quantum of certain decisions which Ecuador
contended the Tribunal should take in relation to various aspects of the claim as presented
by Perenco. The Respondent’s initial version of the Waterfall Chart (dated 15 September
2015) was later updated to reflect the situation as of 18 April 2016.'®

Other elements of the DCF analysis on which Brattle and Professor Kalt disagreed include the treatment of
future oil prices, operating costs, capital costs, the tax treatment of tariffs on the OCP pipeline, and pre-award
interest. See Kalt ER IV, paragraph 101 ff.

Resp. PHB Q., paragraph 183. Ecuador had earlier sought during the Liability Phase declarations that the
enactment of Law 42 and implementing decrees and the institution of coactiva procedures did not breach the
Participation Contracts or the Treaty.

 

Resp. PHB Q., paragraph 184. Ecuador asserts that the Quantum Hearing showed that Perenco’s real claim.
amounted to a maximum of $343 million (Resp. PHB Q., paragraph 1).

B. The Main Issues that Separated the Parties

66. At the Quantum Hearing and at the Quantum Closing, it became clear that the main issues

that separated the Parties in relation to the estimation of damages are relatively few.

67. The Respondent’s Waterfall Chart (above) identified five main issues that divided the

Parties:

1. The general approach to the valuation of damages: i.e., whether damages are to be
assessed ex ante or ex post, and whether on a ‘layering’ basis;

2. Whether in the ‘but for’ world, there would have been an extension of the Block 7
Contract (which was due to expire in August 2010), and if so, the nature of such an
extension and its terms;

68.

69.

3. Whether, in estimating the damages for expropriation, the Tribunal should accept
Mr. Crick’s ‘but for’ drilling programme for both Blocks 7 and Block 21 or RPS’
more modest drilling programme;

4. Whether all, or just a portion, of the effects of Law 42 at 99% should be assumed
away in the ‘but for’ analysis; and

5. Whether a ‘true-up’ in favour of Ecuador should be applied, the effect of which
would be to adjust the damages owed to Perenco.

By the time of the closing day’s submissions, counsel for Perenco had narrowed the list to
four issues: (i) restitution, “under which Perenco’s damages should be calculated at Award
date rather than breach date’”’; (ii) production, “whereby the number of wells Perenco would
have drilled and the volumes of oil they would have produced should be based on
Mr. Crick’s forecast and not those of RPS”; (iii) absorption, “pursuant to which Perenco’s
contractual right to absorption of all Law 42 amounts should be valued rather than
ignored”; and (iv) extension, “by which Perenco should be accorded value for the extension
of the Block 7 Contract to which it was entitled and that it and Ecuador both wanted and

would have agreed absent Ecuador’s breaches.”

The Tribunal’s Starting Point

The Tribunal begins by recalling that it is well understood in the jurisprudence on damages
generally, that the assessment of damages whether in contract, tort or under a treaty, is “not
an exact science.”!* Nor is it an exercise in economic theory to which the Tribunal was
much subjected by the Parties in this case. The Tribunal did not find the extensive reference
to economic theory developed principally in the analysis of U.S. judicial decisions to be
helpful to it when estimating a reasonable figure to compensate Perenco for the damage

which it has suffered as a result of Ecuador’s breaches. The Tribunal found the debate over

Tr. Q. (6) 1623:15-1624:8.

EL-281, Joseph C. Lemire v. Ukraine, ICSID Case No. ARB/06/18, Award, 28 March 2011, paragraph 248:
“While the existence of damage is certain, calculating the precise amount of the compensation is fraught with
much more difficulty, inherent in the very nature of the ‘but for’ hypothesis. Valuation is not an exact science.
The Tribunal has no crystal ball and cannot claim to know what would have happened under a hypothesis of
no breach; the best any tribunal can do is to make an informed and conscientious evaluation, taking into
account all the relevant circumstances of the case, not unlike that made by anyone who assesses the value of
a business on the basis of its likely future earnings.”

19

“opportunistic” and “efficient” breach, however interesting to economists, legal theorists
and judges in the United States, to be of no real value to the Tribunal and irrelevant to its
task of deciding the quantum of damages to which Perenco was entitled.'? That said, the
Tribunal has profited from the experts’ highly professional work on the key issues that the

Tribunal has ultimately had to decide in arriving at this Award.

The Tribunal will begin by setting out in general terms how it intends to deal with the
principal issues identified by the Parties. In view of the various determinations made in this
Award and the adjustments that had to be made to the financial models employed by the
experts to incorporate such changes, the Tribunal considers it to be unnecessary to recite

all of the arguments advanced by the Parties.

Certain issues are addressed at the outset. These concern: (i) the date(s) of valuation of
damages; (ii) the Tribunal’s decision to employ two valuation dates; and (iii) the use of
contemporaneous evidence. Having addressed these issues, the Tribunal will then
summarise its general approach to the balance of the issues relating to the quantification of

damages.

1. The Date of Valuation

Perhaps the most significant issue that divided the Parties concerned the date(s) of
valuation. Perenco and its expert (on instructions) chose a single date, namely, the date of
the expropriation on 10 July 2010. Contending that the expropriation was unlawful and
having regard to the restitutionary relief that it initially had sought, Perenco argued that it
should be entitled to the higher of the value of Perenco’s interests in the two Blocks: as of

the date of the declaration of caducidad or as of the date of the Award.?° In this regard,

While the Claimant has contended that the Participation Contracts are governed by Ecuadorian law, it has
also asserted that Ecuadorian law on damages articulates essentially the same standard of, and approach to,
reparation as the international law standard expressed in the Chorzéw Factory case (Cl. Mem. Q., paragraph
17; Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 2). In contrast, the Respondent has proceeded on the basis of international law
while disagreeing that Ecuadorian law articulates the same standard of full reparation as international law
(Resp. C-Mem. Q., paragraphs 17, 28-29). Given the Parties’ focus on the international law issues arising in
the quantum phase, the Tribunal has likewise focused on those issues.

 

 

Cl. Mem. Q., paragraphs 11 & 22; Cl. Rep. Q., paragraphs 34-35 and 46-47. Perenco relies on the approach
taken by the Permanent Court of International Justice in the case of the Factory at Chorzow which

Perenco’s expert, Professor Kalt, described what he saw as the inter-related nature of the
various breaches found by the Tribunal; this led him to aggregate the breaches and to treat
them as culminating in the formal taking of Perenco’s interests in the Participation

Contracts effected by the declaration of caducidad.

The valuation issue was bound up in the Parties’ debate over so-called ‘layering’. While
Perenco argued for a single date (based on the expropriation), for its part, Ecuador and its
experts (on instructions) asserted that Perenco and Professor Kalt had wrongly grouped
together various independent breaches occurring over approximately two and a half years
as if the Tribunal had found a creeping expropriation; this despite the Tribunal’s having
explicitly rejected Perenco’s claim on that point and having held that the coactivas and
Ecuador’s taking over the operatorship of the Blocks after Perenco had suspended
operations could not be counted towards a finding of indirect or creeping expropriation.”!

As counsel for Ecuador put it in closing argument:

“...to be clear, Decree 662 was not enacted, as Perenco suggests implicitly
in its arguments, with the intention of expropriating at some later point [,]
here in 2010, Perenco’s investments. This is not a case of creeping
expropriation. What you need to do is calculate from October 2007
onwards and then, to avoid double-counting, calculate from July 2010
onwards without double-computing the impact of Decree 662.””?

In accordance with Article 36(1) of the ILC Articles on the Responsibility of States for
Internationally Wrongful Acts (the “ILC Articles”), the Tribunal considers that it should
award compensation insofar as such damage is not made good by restitution, which
compensation should cover “financially assessable damages including loss of profits
insofar as it is established.” The Tribunal recalls that it is well-established that the burden

of proving damages lies with the claiming party.”* In the absence of a creeping or indirect

contemplated a different calculation of the damages for an unlawful expropriation than that which would be
made in relation to a lawful one. See also Tr. Q. (6)1625 et seg. (Claimant’s Closing Argument).

expropriation effected by a series of discrete measures, the orthodox approach is for a
claimant to identify the damages caused by each breach at the time of its occurrence.” It
is moreover the case that the focus of the inquiry must be on damages proximately caused

by the breaches found by the Tribunal.”°

The Tribunal thus does not consider Brattle’s efforts to value the impact of Decree 662, the
first unlawful act, on Perenco’s interests in the Blocks to be wrong in principle. Quite the
contrary. The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador as to the suitability, in the circumstances of the
present case, of valuing the breaches as and when they occurred, rather than focusing
exclusively on the last completed breach. The Tribunal considers that counsel for Ecuador’s
characterisation of the facts, quoted above at paragraph 73, is correct. Even during the
provisional measures phase of this proceeding, counsel for Ecuador confirmed that their
client had no intention at that time to expropriate Perenco’s interests in the Blocks. The
Tribunal adverted to this intention not to expropriate in the Decision on Liability when
discussing whether the Ministry should have stayed its hand in declaring caducidad during

the pendency of these arbitral proceedings.”°

As previously held by the Tribunal, Perenco failed to make out a creeping expropriation

claim and its attempt now to employ in its stead what it called an “inter-linked course of

Decision on Liability, paragraph 709, quoting Ecuador’s letter to the Tribunal: “Ecuador intends to carry out
the enforcement of Law 42 in such a way as to avoid any disruption of Perenco’s business. In particular,
Ecuador does not intend to seize any assets of the Consortium beyond oil equivalent in value to the
outstanding debt. Nor does Ecuador intend to terminate the relevant Participation Contracts, or take legal
action against Perenco representatives.” CE-212, Letter from Respondents regarding the Tribunal's Decision
on Provisional Measures and Law 42, 15 May 2009.

conduct” is unavailing.” The breaches are of course inter-linked in that each is a part of
the dispute as it evolved, but each has to be examined at its own time and in its own context.
This is particularly the case when it is recalled that certain acts claimed to be in breach of
contract or of the Treaty were not accepted as such by the Tribunal. For example, while the
Tribunal accepted that Perenco could lawfully suspend operations under the exceptio non
adempleti contractus doctrine, it also accepted that the State could in such circumstances
lawfully intervene in the Blocks so as to safeguard their operating continuity and
productivity after the Consortium suspended operations.”* Similarly, the Tribunal held that
the coactiva dispute, which arose when Perenco’s decision not to pay Law 42 dues led
Ecuador to seek to liquidate the claimed 2008 tax debt, resulted from the acts of both
Parties. The Tribunal held that neither of these acts could be counted towards Perenco’s

theory of a creeping expropriation.””

The Tribunal recalls further that when analysing whether Perenco had made out its claim
of a breach of the Treaty in relation to Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal adverted to the
conflation of different events occurring at different times.*° The Tribunal has had the same
sense in the quantum phase of the proceeding. It considers that Decree 662 and caducidad,
separated as they were by a period of over two years, cannot be lumped together so as to

land on a single date that is then used to value the breaches’ collective impact.

advanced by Perenco.

Decision on Liability, paragraphs 705, 710.

Ibid., paragraph 703.

Ibid., paragraph 580: “In advancing its allegation of breach, the Claimant tended to conflate a series of
measures which were taken at different times over a course of some four years. In its pleadings, the Claimant
tended to lump together: (i) Law 42 at 50%; (ii) the promulgation and application of Decree 662; (iii) the
Correa administration’s demands for the migration of participation contracts to a service contract model; (iv)
the subsequent demand for a faster migration to service contracts than that initially sought; (v) the demands
for payment of levies claimed to have been owed under Law 42; (vi) the launching of coactivas; (vii) the
decision to enforce the coactivas notwithstanding the Tribunal’s recommendation that it not do so during the
pendency of the arbitration; and (viii) the breakdown in negotiations which led to the Consortium’s decision
to suspend operations, which in turn led to the initiation of the proceeding resulting in the declaration of
caducidad.”

79.

Not only did the Tribunal differentiate in its Decision on Liability between Decree 662, the
first completed breach, and caducidad, the last completed breach, it also distinguished
between Decree 662 and the other fair and equitable treatment breaches that followed
before Perenco suspended operations. The Ministry declared caducidad a year later after
requesting Perenco to return to the Blocks on four separate occasions, requests that Perenco
refused to countenance unless Ecuador complied with the Tribunal’s Decision on
Provisional Measures. It was only after the Ministry gave these warnings and Perenco
refused to resume operations that the Ministry made a declaration of caducidad.*! To point
this out is not to excuse the Ministry — the Tribunal has agreed with Perenco that the
caducidad amounted to an expropriation under Article 6 of the Treaty — but rather to make
the point that Perenco’s decision to suspend operations compelled the government to
intervene to protect the Blocks and their production, and the warnings that Perenco should
resume operations or face a declaration of caducidad were based on one of the grounds for

termination listed in Article 74 of the Hydrocarbons Law.*?

Of specific relevance to the proposed single date of valuation based on the “inter-linked
course of conduct” argument, the Tribunal notes that the fair and equitable treatment
breaches themselves were not treated as all in one package in the Decision on Liability. In
addition to rejecting the creeping expropriation contention, the Tribunal differentiated

between the offending measures as follows:

“606....Decree 662 marked the beginning of a series of other measures in
breach of Article 4 taken in relation to the Participation Contracts, namely:
(i) demanding that the contractors agree to surrender their rights under
their participation contracts and migrate to what for a considerable period
of time was an unspecified model, such that the contractors were unable
to discern precisely what they were being asked to move to; (ii) escalating
negotiating demands, in particular in April 2008 when the President
unexpectedly suspended the negotiations and rejected what had recently
been achieved in a Partial Agreement in respect of one of the blocks; (iii)
making coercive and threatening statements, including threats of
expulsion from Ecuador; and (iv) taking steps to enforce Law 42 against
Perenco (and Burlington) for non-payment of dues claimed to be owing, a
portion of which has been held to be in breach of Article 4, and when no

payments were made, forcibly seizing and selling the oil produced in
Blocks 7 and 21 in order to realise the claimed Law 42 debt. This set the
stage for the Consortium’s suspension of operations and ultimately the
declaration of caducidad which formally terminated the Consortium’s
rights in the two blocks.

607. The Tribunal has already noted that Ecuador has not contested the
Claimant’s assertion that Decree 662 was intended to force a renegotiation
of the participation contracts in order to migrate Petroecuador’s
counterparties to service contracts. In the Tribunal’s view, moving beyond
50% to 99% with the application of Decree 662 amounted to a breach of
Article 4 of the Treaty and the measures, taken collectively, just listed also

constituted breaches of Article 4.” [Double emphasis added.]

 

 

As the underlined and italicised passages indicate, the Tribunal distinguished between
Decree 662 and the measures that followed. This is not to suggest that none of these were
related to the others, but the Tribunal was alive to the fact that some of the breaches (and
other alleged breaches which were not accepted as such) arose out of complex interactions
between the Consortium and/or the individual acts of its members, Perenco and Burlington,

and the State.**

The facts and the findings were thus somewhat more complicated than the way in which
they have sometimes been treated in the course of the quantum pleadings. The Tribunal has
accordingly found it necessary to revert to specific prior findings from time to time so as

to provide context for certain findings made in this Award.

Quite apart from the issues of context and timing, the Tribunal considers that Decree 662
had the effect of converting the Participation Contracts into de facto service contracts (and,
as Perenco pointed out during the quantum phase, imperfect ones at that, because they
provided no protection against lower oil prices*), but the decree did not purport to interfere

with the Contracts’ operation below the reference price.*> Perenco continued to both hold

The first led to the coactivas aimed at collecting the claimed tax debt which the Tribunal has found to be a
breach of contract (at paragraph 579 of the Decision on Liability, the Tribunal found that it was not necessary
to consider the measures as a breach of treaty); the second was found to be a breach but one that Perenco was
found to have contributed to; and the third, the State’s intervention to operate the Blocks was found to be a
lawful response to Perenco’s suspension of operations. Decision on Liability, paragraphs 417, 697 and 708.
Cl. Rep. Q., paragraph 132.

As noted in an email report sent shortly after Perenco representatives met with the Minister of Mines: “If we
drill the OSO23 we must explain to the state that this is the last one and that we do it because of contractual

 

25

83.

85.

and exercise those contractual rights up to the date of its decision to suspend operations
(and thereafter, in that Ecuador credited Perenco’s account with revenues derived from
sales of crude oil while it operated the Blocks after the Consortium suspended operations

and up to the declaration of caducidad).*®

Thus, the Tribunal did not see a set of inter-linked measures so closely connected in time
as to convince it to aggregate them and employ the single valuation date for which Perenco
contended. Nor did it consider that the challenges of valuing the breaches individually was
of such complexity as to require the damages estimation exercise to default to a single date

of valuation.

Tribunals are not bound to accept a party’s proposed date of valuation. In Sempra, for
example, while the tribunal ultimately agreed with the claimant’s proposed date, it

observed:

“209. The Tribunal will accordingly use December 31, 2001 as the proper
valuation date. This is not because it believes that the Claimant’s argument
should be given any deference, but simply because the explanation given
shows that there was an investment decision made in good faith. Neither
does the Tribunal share the interpretation which the Claimant has given to
CMS with regard to the payment of certain deference in the choice of a
valuation date. It is apparent that in CMS no acts or decisions taken by the
claimant after the injunction raised any doubt about the date which
triggered the events complained of.”*”

Having regard to all of the circumstances and to its prior findings, the Tribunal therefore
prefers the kind of ‘layering’ analysis proposed by Ecuador’s experts, albeit with important

modifications to Brattle’s approach. The Tribunal intends to value the first completed

obligation with the drilling contractor, and that it is obviously difficult to stop a campaign. so quickly. In other
words we don’t want the state to believe that we carry on drilling because it is still ”

breach and then adjust it in certain ways for reasons explained below. It will then turn to
the subsequent breaches and do the same (if there is evidence of financially assessable
damage proximately caused by each breach). It considers that this approach is consonant

with international law and legal practice.

The Tribunal notes that bound up in the Parties’ debate over ‘layering’ were arguments as
to whether Brattle acted consistently with their declared intention to value the breaches
separately on an ex ante basis. Perenco criticised Brattle for its having focused on the two
breaches of Decree 662 and caducidad specified in the Decision on Liability’s dispositif
without estimating the economic effects of the intervening breaches (demanding that
contracts migrate to services contracts, making escalating contractual demands, and
making coercive and threatening statements).** Yet, the Tribunal would note that this
criticism overlooks the point noted above at paragraph 74 that it is not incumbent upon a
respondent to make a claimant’s case on damages; that burden is the claimant’s.*? Indeed,
a respondent is entitled to simply challenge the claimant’s approach if it sees fit to do so
without proffering an alternative estimation of the damages that might be payable. Perenco
was put on notice of the ‘layering’ approach by the Respondent’s first responsive pleading
in the damages phase.*° The fact that Brattle did not attempt to value escalating contract

demands, for example, did not preclude Perenco from seeking to do so.4! However, while

Brattle ER II, paragraphs 43 and 254; Cl. Rep. Q., paragraphs 257-269 commenting thereon.

The Tribunal takes note of Brattle’s Rebuttal Report (Brattle ER III), where it was stated at f 83: “Professor:
Kalt’s approach to ex-ante assessment also is incorrect if we were to accept the alternative - that it were
possible to quantify separate damages flowing from the separate breaches in paragraph 606. This view would
prompt only the introduction of an additional layer in the damages analysis to reflect the separate FET breach
(which we deem quantifiable) at the associated date of breach. Perhaps this would be the moment when ‘taken
collectively’, the measures identified in paragraph 606 of the Liability Decision amounted to a separate breach
of the FET standard. Because the Liability Decision did not identify any such date, in particular in the
dispositive section, we have not undertaken such an analysis. The addition of a third layer is unlikely to have
a material impact on the damages to Perenco. We stand ready to introduce a third layer in the analysis if
requested by the Tribunal to do so.”

it criticised Brattle’s approach in its Quantum Reply, Perenco continued to base its damages
case on a single valuation date, thus running the risk that the Tribunal might be persuaded
by Brattle’s approach and thus be presented with no attempt to value the breaches arising

between Decree 662 and caducidad.

As for certain other criticisms of Brattle’s ‘layering’ approach, such as Perenco’s
observation that Brattle’s avowed ex ante approach to valuing the impact of Decree 662 on
Perenco was not adhered to when Brattle used ex post information to make its ‘true-up’

argument, these are addressed below.

For its part, Ecuador maintained that the dispute between the Parties evolved over time.
Therefore, it argued that its experts were right to estimate the effects of separate breaches
occurring at different times in order to avoid double counting. Brattle estimated the impact
of Decree 662 as of 4 October 2007, then estimated the impact of caducidad on the already

diminished (but also already compensated) value of Perenco’s interests in the Blocks.

Ecuador observed in this respect that Brattle’s valuation as of the date of Decree 662
accorded with Perenco’s contemporaneous calculations performed in October 2007, just
days after Decree 662 was promulgated. With regard to Law 42 at 50%, Perenco calculated
that the NPV for its interests in the two Blocks through to their date of expiry amounted to
US$239.4 million’; Brattle’s initial NPV calculation of the interests was US$265.7
million*? but this was later adjusted upwards in its Reply Report to either US$282.2 million
(using RPS’ capital costs) or US$295.8 million (using Professor Kalt’s costs). With regard
to Decree 662, Perenco’s contemporaneous NPV calculation for its interests in the two
Blocks was US$154.6 million’; Brattle’s initial values were US$107.7 million* and this
was later updated by Brattle to come to US$127.6 million (using RPS’s costs) or US$127.5

million (using Professor Kalt’s costs).

In disputing Ecuador’s attempt to use an earlier date in assessing damages, Perenco argued
that ‘layering’ was conceptually flawed in this case because Ecuador’s breaches were inter-
related. Such inter-related breaches led to layering being rejected in SAUR.*° Here, each of
Ecuador’s breaches was inextricably linked to the others (and it was irrelevant, in Perenco’s
view, that the Tribunal did not find a creeping expropriation).*” The principle of full
reparation warranted the use of a single valuation date in order to capture the cumulative
effect of the breaches and thereby grant Perenco proper restitution. Brattle’s approach was
inconsistent with the principle that a breaching State could not be given credit for actions
that depressed the value of the investment prior to expropriation (as recognised in

Occidental I1.*®

Perenco argued further that Brattle admitted that they applied ‘layering’ in a way that
reduced Perenco’s damages at every turn. Professor Dow conceded that if ‘layering’ were
done in a different order, Perenco’s damages would be higher.*? Perenco contended that
Professor Dow and Mr. Caldwell also admitted on cross-examination that they had
essentially transferred only the “good” risk and imposed on Perenco the “bad” risk: they
had ignored actual high oil prices after Decree 662 in estimating Perenco’s anticipated
revenues, but reduced Perenco’s damages by offsetting the actual Decree 662 payments
based on those higher oil prices, and then deprived Perenco of the coactiva-seized oil’s
actual market price.*” Brattle’s approach also presumed that in setting an ex ante price, a
willing buyer would have foreseen the whole sequence of later events —including,
ultimately, oil seizure— yet Mr. Caldwell admitted that “nobody standing in October ’07

would have predicted all the set of the chain of events that would actually occur.”*!

Perenco added that Brattle’s various ‘stabilisation’ scenarios made no sense. Professor
Dow and Mr. Caldwell admitted that their lump-sum ‘side payment’ for Decree 662
amounted to continuing to apply Decree 662 to Perenco, even though the purpose of
damages was to wipe out the effects of Decree 662.** It could not be assumed that Perenco
would have ceded all of its future upside for a single payment in October 2007. In addition,
the notion that Perenco’s expectations were immutable as of October 2007 was inconsistent

with the fact that Perenco continued to operate in Ecuador after Decree 662.

Moreover, Brattle had not explained why any ‘hypothetical tax threshold’ between 50%
and 99% was at all appropriate when the Tribunal’s task was to eliminate Decree 662 in its
entirety. Brattle’s ‘stabilisation’ scenarios were built on variations of what Ecuador
contended were the parties’ assumed pre-contractual expectations of the economy of the
Contracts, but Mr. Caldwell could not even articulate the rationale for using such

expectations to determine the damages to which Perenco was entitled under the Treaty.*?
Ecuador responded to Perenco’s contentions as follows.

First, at the Quantum Hearing, Ecuador presented the Waterfall Chart showing the different
components of damages claimed by Perenco and illustrating the impact of correcting each

component.* Perenco did not challenge the figures in the Waterfall Chart.*>

Second, in response to Perenco’s criticism that ‘layering’ was invalid because of the inter-
related nature of Ecuador’s breaches, Perenco did not explain why the breaches were inter-
related and why interrelation would matter at all to ‘layering’.°° Professor Kalt
acknowledged for the first time at the Quantum Hearing that he himself had done a monthly

layering in his ex ante analysis, which stood in contradiction to his and Perenco’s criticism

on ‘layering’.*” Professor Kalt’s ‘mark-to-market’ contingent contract justification for his
ex ante calculation was entirely new at the Quantum Hearing and entirely different from

the logic advanced in his Fourth Expert Report.**

In respect of Perenco’s criticism that neither Ecuador nor Brattle addressed the fact that the
Tribunal found other breaches apart from Decree 662 and caducidad, Ecuador asserted that
Brattle’s 16 October 2015 Expert Report (at paragraphs 88 to 90) addressed this at length
and it was Perenco who chose not to cross-examine Brattle’s experts on this point during

the Quantum Hearing.*?

In respect of SAUR’s rejection of ‘layering’, Ecuador explained that that tribunal rejected
‘layering’ because in that case the first-in-time breach had already deprived the investment
of all value, which was not the case here.™ In Occidental II, the two breaches found by that
tribunal were only weeks apart and hence the issue was not even discussed.*! In contrast,

in the present case the two principal breaches occurred in 2007 and 2010.

Finally, in respect of Perenco’s claim that Brattle had admitted that they applied ‘layering’
in a way that reduced Perenco’s damages at every turn, Ecuador argued that this illustrated
Perenco’s confusion of rather simple economics. Perenco’s sole criticism was directed at
Brattle’s calculation of the ‘true-up’, which was ex post (i.e., considering actual prices)
while calculating damages to Perenco ex ante. As Brattle explained, “the true up adopts an
ex-post perspective inherently, since it must look back and assess what Law 42 amounts
were actually paid by the Consortium and which levies remain outstanding.”®? There was
nothing unsound in this calculation and Professor Kalt never took issue with it. Brattle

further explained that imposing on Perenco the change in oil prices when it chose to

withhold taxes was appropriate, while also acknowledging that the allocation of risks was

ultimately an issue for the Tribunal (hence the sensitivity calculations of the ‘true-up’).

As noted above in paragraph 77, the Tribunal has decided that it is appropriate to seek to
value the damages caused by different breaches occurring at different times. To the extent
that the Tribunal accepts that there were any deficiencies in the way in which Brattle

performed the exercise, these can be remedied in the damages calculation.

Having concluded thus, the Tribunal would also note at this point that Perenco had also
contended, in tandem with its single valuation date approach, that an ex post approach
should be taken where there is an unlawful expropriation and the value of the investment
had increased. Ecuador disagreed. In light of the Tribunal’s analysis above, and its
layering / “clean sheet” approach (discussed below), the Tribunal does not consider it

necessary to delve into the arguments on this point.

2. Has Perenco demonstrated any loss or damage proximately caused by
the post-Decree 662 fair and equitable treatment breaches?
As noted in paragraphs 74 and 85 above, the Tribunal will award damages for any
quantifiable financial losses proximately caused by the breaches determined by it in the
merits phase. Damages will be awarded for Decree 662 and the declaration of caducidad.
This raises the question whether the other breaches of fair and equitable treatment suffered
by Perenco after Decree 662 but before the expropriation have been shown to result in

time was an unspecified model, such that the contractors were unable to discern precisely
what they were being asked to move to; (ii) escalating negotiating demands, in particular
in April 2008 when the President unexpectedly suspended the negotiations and rejected

what had recently been achieved in a Partial Agreement in respect of one of the blocks;

 

iii)
making coercive and threatening statements, including threats of expulsion from Ecuador;
and (iv) taking steps to enforce Law 42 against Perenco (and Burlington) for non-payment
of dues claimed to be owing, a portion of which has been held to be in breach of Article 4,
and when no payments were made, forcibly seizing and selling the oil produced in Blocks

7 and 21 in order to realise the claimed Law 42 debt.”

However, with the exception of the sales of oil seized and sold pursuant to the coactivas,
which must be adjusted in the ‘true-up’ exercise to be consistent with the Tribunal’s finding
on Decree 662, it appears that neither Party’s experts undertook the exercise of quantifying
damages attributable to those breaches during the pleadings phase. Therefore, it might be
that these are breaches for which proximate damage has not been estimated and therefore

no damages can be awarded.® This is the position taken by Brattle.

The Tribunal understands that Professor Kalt’s view was that breaches (i) and (iii) listed

 

above “would be expected to adversely affect Perenco’s investment and production
decisions.”®’ The Tribunal agrees, but it also considers that this already occurred when
Decree 662 took effect and Perenco stopped drilling in both Blocks (except for Oso 23).
Since the Tribunal has found that wells would have been drilled in both Blocks after Decree
662 and Perenco will be compensated for the cash flows associated with those ‘but for’
wells as well as for the loss of the opportunity to negotiate the extension of Block 7 (see
Sections II.D.3 and IF below), in the Tribunal’s view, Professor Kalt’s concerns on these

particular points are met.

Decision on Liability, paragraph 606.

Perenco criticised Brattle’s layering approach for estimating the impact of Decree 662 and caducidad only.
The Tribunal’s understanding is that Professor Kalt also criticised layering but did not offer any quantification
of the damages for these breaches if and when they occurred.

Brattle ER III, paragraph 90
Kalt ER IV, paragraph 49.

33

106.

107.

108.

As for the coactivas issue, the Tribunal will reflect in the Award a sum of damages flowing
from Perenco’s being credited for the depressed auction price received for the seized oil
rather than the market value. The Parties spent considerable time over the course of this
proceeding addressing the impact of the coactivas. There is record evidence on the amounts
of oil seized, the prices at which it was sold and the amounts that were credited to Perenco.
However, the analysis is complicated by the fact that after submitting its claim to
arbitration, Perenco (and Burlington) stopped paying Law 42 dues and instead began to
deposit them in an account located outside of Ecuador. Given that Perenco failed in its
attempt to prove a breach of contract and Treaty for Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal considers
that there is some merit to Ecuador’s ‘true-up’ claim. It follows that some accounting for
Perenco’s non-compliance with Law 42 must be performed. In the Tribunal’s view, this

issue is best addressed as part of its discussion of Ecuador’s ‘true-up’ claim below.

In sum, the Tribunal considers that the financial impact of the non-Decree 662 breaches
has either been accounted for in the ‘but for’ analysis of Decree 662 as of 4 October 2007
or was not quantified by the expert reports submitted with the Claimant’s pleadings on

quantum.

3. Use of a ‘clean sheet’ for the valuation of the expropriation damages

The Tribunal has accepted Ecuador’s submission that the use of a single date for valuing
the damages is not appropriate in the circumstances of this case. The Tribunal recalls that
Brattle defended its ‘layering’ approach based on the need to safeguard against double-
counting:

“We then estimated the FMV of Perenco’s interests in July 2010, when

Ecuador declared Caducidad. The Tribunal deemed Caducidad to amount

to expropriation. Our estimate of the July 2010 FMV of Perenco’s interests

netted off the impact of Decree 662, reflecting our separate quantification

of the damages due in relation to it in the first step. Netting off the impact
of Decree 662 was necessary to avoid double-counting.”**

Brattle ER III, paragraph 67(b).

34

109.

110.

111.

112.

113.

The Tribunal agrees that double-counting must be avoided, but it has arrived at a different

solution from that proposed by Brattle.

This results from the Tribunal’s seeing merit in Perenco’s concern that estimating the
damages as of the first completed breach could be unfair to it. Depending upon how the
compensation for the first completed breach is calculated, it is possible, as Professor Kalt
contended, that factoring in the effects of Decree 662 could have a price-depressing impact

on Perenco’s rights that ended up being expropriated.

Having carefully reflected on the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal has concluded that the
fairest approach to take in the circumstances of the present case is the following: Since at
the time of the first breach it was by no means certain that an expropriation would follow
Decree 662 some 33 months later, the Tribunal will calculate the damages proximately
caused by Decree 662 for the period 4 October 2007 to 20 July 2010. This is on the basis

that Decree 662 was the only compensable breach for that period of time.

In principle, the Tribunal would have also awarded any damages proximately caused by
the subsequent fair and equitable treatment breaches, but it has already found that the
Claimant did not adduce evidence of the financial impact of the post-Decree 662 fair and
equitable treatment breaches. Therefore, no damages can be awarded for those breaches.
But since Perenco’s rights were brought to an end by the act of caducidad, the Tribunal
will re-estimate the loss of those rights according to then-prevailing market conditions and
industry expectations (as well as in light of the hypothetical increased production in the

two Blocks in the ‘but for’ scenario).

Having arrived at this approach, the Tribunal’s initial thinking was that this would be done
based on the ratio between the total number of months between October 2007 and July
2010 and the total number of months from October 2010 until contract expiry. However, a
simple temporal pro-rating would lead to a biased result that could assign a lower value to

cash flows that would have been generated during the October 2007 to July 2010 period

35

114.

115.

116.

than should be the case. In the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal has added up the
discounted cash flows in the October 2007 damages model through to July 2010. This
ensures that the value for the October 2007 layer of damages reflects the actual discounting
and contribution of pre-July 2010 cash flows to the October 2007 fair market value and

also accounts for the full cost of any pre-July 2010 CAPEX.

The result is an initial award of damages for Decree 662’s impact during the roughly 33-
month period between the first completed breach and the last breach. Then, because of the
effect of the expropriation, a new valuation is performed, based on pricing and market
information available as of the date of the expropriation. The initial award of damages
attributable to Decree 662 is capped at that point; this then requires the Tribunal to make
certain determinations as to the nature of the contractual rights that were terminated. These
are included in the calculation and the value of the one-month interest in Block 7 as well

as the approximately 10-year period left on Block 21 will be estimated.

The Tribunal has taken this approach because it accepts Professor Kalt’s concern about
valuing an asset whose value had already been diminished. Thus, rather than valuing what
might be called the ‘below reference price’ contractual rights, in theory compensated by
the prior award of damages, as of the day before the expropriation, the Tribunal will
establish a new valuation of the totality of the contractual rights that were taken away from
Perenco, based on the prevailing market conditions. This analysis will be ex ante, but it
will allow the Tribunal to consider all relevant actual market developments as well as
employ the assumptions as to what Perenco would have done in both Blocks during the

prior period and what it would have done in the remainder of the Blocks’ lives.

Unlike the situation in ADC v. Hungary, where the value of the airport concession rights at

issue had crystallised after the submission of the claim to arbitration and before the date of

This is due to the fact that a pro-rating approach would implicitly assume that the value produced by the field
was constant in each month over the field’s life. Discounting would over-weight cash flows that are nearer
in time relative to those further off in the future. In addition, value is often front-end loaded because
production rates often start high and then decline over time. Declining profiles result in higher revenue and
cash flows earlier in field life than later. Pro-rating would also cause problems with the modeling of capital
expenditures.

the award”°, the Tribunal finds itself in the midst of a period stretching between caducidad
and the date of expiry. Having regard to the Parties’ extensive debate over the use of ex
ante versus ex post valuation data, the Tribunal is concerned about the degree of
randomness associated with employing the date of the Award as the valuation date since a
single significant event can have dramatic effects on valuation given the volatility of the
oil market. In the circumstances of this case, the Tribunal will employ an ex ante willing
buyer-willing seller approach using the price of oil prevailing at the time of the

expropriation (approximately US$76/bbl WTI as of July 2010).
In line with its conclusions that:

(i) there were no inter-linked breaches such as to justify the use of a single date of

valuation;”!

(ii) itis in principle appropriate to seek to value the damages caused by the different

breaches occurring at the relevant times; and

(iii) the contemporaneous evidence of value is a useful check against the Tribunal’s

estimates;

the Tribunal considers that an approach using the well-accepted ex ante approach to
valuation as the primary point of reference is reasonable and appropriate in the
circumstances. (It uses the word “primary” because of the fact that with the passage of time
between the commencement of this arbitration and the rendering of this Award,
Petroamazonas has operated the Blocks and inevitably the testimonial and expert evidence
pertaining to the operation of Block 21, in particular, has mixed ex ante with ex post data.
In the circumstances, the Tribunal has no interest in attempting to ‘unscramble the egg’ by

drawing a strict line between these data.)

4, The Role of Contemporaneous Evidence of Value

The Tribunal is strengthened in its belief that estimating the damages attributable to each
breach and in chronological order is the correct approach to be taken in the circumstances
of this case, by the availability of Perenco’s contemporaneous net present value (NPV)
calculations of the impact of Law 42 at both 50% and 99% on both Blocks. These
calculations were performed immediately after Decree 662’s announcement.” The
spreadsheet for Block 21, for example, which was disclosed by Perenco in the documents
production phase and reviewed by Brattle, shows that the NPV calculation for Block 21

ran, as would be expected, to Block 21 Contract’s expiry date of 2021.7

These documents of the Claimant’s own making are, in the Tribunal’s view, good evidence
of the Blocks’ estimated value with Law 42 at 50% and 99% in light of the existing and
expected market circumstances at the time of the first breach. Brattle studied Perenco’s
calculations and adjusted them; Perenco had, for example, used July 2007 WTI prices
rather than the higher prices prevailing in early October 2007. In fact, Brattle ended up

arriving at somewhat higher NPV calculations than Perenco itself did at the time.”*

Exhibit BR-26.

Exhibit BR-27 (NPV impact of Law 42 at 99%); Exhibit BR-28 (NPV impact of Law 42 at 50%).

See Brattle ER II, paragraph 253: “Damages for this economy of the contract scenario resemble the financial
analysis performed by Perenco, in October 2007 immediately after the introduction of Decree 662. We
estimate that Decree 662 reduced the October 2007 fair market value of Perenco’s Block 7 and 21 interests
by $158 million (excl. prejudgment interest), just less than double the $85 million estimated by Perenco at
the time.” This is further elaborated in footnote 157 to the same paragraph: “Perenco’s estimate of $84.8
million appears in an 9 October 2007 email from Jerome Garcia. With Law 42 at 50%, we estimate the
October 2007 fair market value at $109.1 million for Block 7 and $156.6 million for Block 21. This compares
with the $122.1 million for Block 7 and $117.3 million for Block 21 reported in the Jerome Garcia email. At
Block 21 (where we have the Perenco models), we assume higher prices and costs than Perenco’s models
(PERPROD0032725 (Exhibit BR-27) and PERPROD0032726 (Exhibit BR-28)), and more production. With
Decree 662, we estimate the October 2007 fair market value at $58.8 million for Block 7 and $48.9 million
at Block 21. This compares to the $84.1 million for Block 7 and the $70.5 million for Block 21 estimated by
Perenco at the time. Given the presence of Decree 662, our fair market value estimate for Block 21 is lower:
than Perenco’s because our model assumes higher operating costs.”

 

 

38

120.

121.

122.

In its Reply Post-Hearing Brief, Perenco downplayed the significance of its NPV
calculations, describing them as “back-of-the-envelope, hurried calculations to understand
Decree 662’s immediate impact.”

Ecuador had addressed this contention in its closing submissions at the Quantum Closing.
Slides 122 and 123 of Ecuador’s presentation showed that the calculations were closely
comparable to Perenco’s other valuations, made prior to Decree 662’s coming into effect,
as to the Blocks’ value and indeed in one case what Perenco —acting as a possible willing
purchaser- might be willing to pay Burlington for the latter’s interests in the Blocks just

one month before Decree 662’s promulgation.”° In counsel’s submission:

“This confirms that the allegedly hurried calculation of BR-26 is not such
hurried valuation. It actually follows from a September 2007 valuation,
that’s consistent, and then it’s much higher than the March 2007 valuation.
These were prepared with plenty of time, not in a hurry. And as you can
see at the bottom of the table, we have put Brattle’s valuation. Brattle’s
valuation of Block 7, 111.3 million, is within 10 percent of Perenco’s own
valuations in October and September 2007 and higher than their earlier
valuation of March 2007.

The same happens with Block 21.”77

The Tribunal considers that Perenco’s analysts would have had a good preliminary
understanding of Decree 662’s impact on the company’s interests in the Blocks. The email
chain’s distribution list contains the names of seven Perenco employees who were involved
in analysing Decree 662, including Eric d’Argentré, Perenco’s Country Manager for
Ecuador. Obviously, the calculations were based on the information available to the
company at the time. This necessarily has to be the case when projecting into the future
with a new factor added into the mix. But the projections were being made by employees

with knowledge of (i) the Participation Contracts’ terms; (ii) the Blocks’ performance to

different from what Paddy [Spink] did here —Paddy was our manager for new business— but basically he
was being conservative in evaluating prices so he would assume probably the low case. So, if Conoco was
not putting any value on the extension, then he wouldn’t offer any additional value. That’s standard practice,
basically.”

date and their characteristics and potential; (iii) Perenco’s and the Consortium’ intentions;

and (iv) wider industry market expectations at the time.

During 2007, in the months leading up to Decree 662, Perenco: (i) produced its Mid-Term
Outlook in March; (ii) valued Burlington’s interests in the Blocks with a view to a potential
purchase in September; and (iii) analysed the effect of Decree 662 in October 2007.7* The
Tribunal notes that Professor Kalt commented in his December 2014 expert report that in
his experience, “investors in oil and gas properties and contracts routinely use DCF
analysis in the course of business to provide them with measures of how much they should
value an investment and, in certain cases, how much they should be willing to pay, or be
paid, for oil and gas development projects.””? The Tribunal accepts this and is therefore
inclined to use Perenco’s contemporaneous analysis of the impact of Decree 662 as a check

on its own estimation of the Blocks’ values.

Professor Kalt initially testified that he recalled having seen Perenco’s internal calculations
of Law 42’s effect at 50% and 99% on its interests in the Blocks but then indicated that he
was not sure whether he had seen Perenco’s spreadsheets. In any event, he stated that he
did not find it relevant to discuss them in his reports.*° This was an understandable position
for him to take because it was consistent with his view that the single date approach to
valuation should be taken. Since the Tribunal has nor taken the ‘single date’ approach,
however, it considers Perenco’s NPV calculations to be relevant evidence of its view of the
Blocks’ values in October 2007 with and without Law 42 at 99%. Obviously, that value
would change over time depending upon a host of factors, but it is a good way to check the

results that the Tribunal arrives at.

5. Summary of the Tribunal’s General Approach

The point of departure therefore is the Tribunal’s view that it must estimate the damages
proximately caused by each breach and that this must be done as of the date of their
occurrence. Accordingly, the Tribunal considers primarily on an ex ante basis (and

referring to contemporaneous evidence where possible):

a the financial impact of Decree 662 on Perenco’s interests in the Blocks as of the
date of the first completed breach, 4 October 2007, with a view to estimating the
compensation for the damage caused by that breach;

(ii) and in relation to the foregoing, Decree 662’s specific impact on Perenco’s drilling
plans at the time so as to estimate what they would have been through to contract
expiry for both Blocks in the ‘but for’ world (because this issue drives the expected
levels of production and hence the projections of cash flows in the ‘but for’ world);

(iii) the damages to which Perenco is entitled as a result of the termination of its
contractual rights in relation to Blocks 7 and 21;

(iv) whether, in the ‘but for’ world, Perenco would have enjoyed an extension of its
operatorship in Block 7 after August 2010;

(v) Ecuador’s ‘true-up’ submissions to determine whether any damages calculated
under the foregoing heads need to be adjusted; and

(vi) the applicable rates of interest (to the date of the Award and to the date of payment
of the Award).

Based on its various findings and conclusions, the Tribunal will then estimate the quantum
of damages that should be awarded to Perenco using a ‘harmonised model’ that draws from

the work of both sides’ financial experts.

The Quantum of Damages for Decree 662, the First Completed Breach

The Tribunal did not find a breach of contract or of treaty for Law 42 at 50% and therefore
no damages can flow for Law 42 dues at 50%, at least until the promulgation of Decree

662, for the simple fact that no unlawful act was committed until 4 October 2007.*! The

As the ILC Articles state in Article 31(2), Reparation: “Injury includes any damage, whether material or
moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State.” Commentary (9) notes in this regard that it is
“only ‘[iJnjury ... caused by the internationally wrongful act of a State’ for which full reparation must be
made.” [Emphasis added.]

question is whether or how the analysis changes as of that date. This affects the analysis on

the drilling programme and in turn the volume of oil produced in the ‘but for’ scenario.

1. Economy of the contracts — Whether Law 42 would have been
completely absorbed

(a) Perenco’s Position

Perenco argued that the economy of the Contracts was the specific contractual bargain
reflected in the economic clauses of the Contracts themselves, which guaranteed Perenco’s
full exposure to oil prices regardless of IRR.*? Dr. Pérez Loose and Professor Aguilar both
agreed that, under Ecuadorian law, the ‘economy’ of a contract designates the balance of
rights and obligations that determined the economic benefits of the contract for the
parties.** This also defined the risks that each party would bear during the performance of

the contract.**

The evidence confirmed that Law 42 triggered the clauses. Perenco would have exercised
its ‘absorption’ rights in a ‘but for’ world. The Tribunal must assume that Ecuador would

have honoured its legal obligations in good faith.

Perenco argued that it had not lost its ‘absorption’ rights whether on grounds of res judicata
or waiver. First, the Tribunal has not expressly decided the issue and has not rejected it.
The Tribunal found only that Perenco had not established that Ecuador breached Perenco’s
‘absorption’ rights before Decree 662. Ecuador’s argument, that the Tribunal’s decision to
reject Perenco’s claim that it was futile to exercise its rights when Law 42 applied at 50%
should be applied mutatis mutandis to the situation where Law 42 applied at 99%, is
incorrect because the Tribunal held that pursuing the clauses was indeed futile after Decree

662.

Second, Perenco had not waived those rights. Perenco had paid the Law 42 dues on a ‘bajo

protesta’ (‘without prejudice’ ) basis. It had invoked the Renegotiation Clauses through its

Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 58.
Ibid., paragraph 59.
Id.

42

132.

December 2006 letters. Perenco also claimed a breach of the clauses in this arbitration.
Even if Perenco’s attempts to invoke the clauses were not exercised sufficiently vigorously
in relation to Law 42 at 50%, this did not amount to a waiver of its rights under Ecuadorian
law. Dr. Pérez Loose’s testimony that nothing obliged Perenco to exercise the rights within
a particular time was unchallenged.** The evidence and testimony of Perenco’s witnesses
also confirmed that Perenco continued to seek discussions with Ecuador through various
avenues. Seeking an abatement of Law 42 was one of the key objectives that Perenco’s
CEO set for the Ecuador team in 2007.*° Mr. Combe and Mr. d’ Argentré both testified that
they did intend to further assert Perenco’s absorption rights, but were attempting to find

the right opportunity to do so.*’ This was confirmed by Mr. Marquez.**

Ecuador’s argument that the clauses mandated nothing more than negotiation must be
rejected based on the Tribunal’s findings and the evidence. The Tribunal had already
rejected Ecuador’s contention that the Renegotiation Clauses mandated only that the
Parties negotiate a mutually agreeable offset.8° The Tribunal found that the absorption
clauses “did stipulate the ultimate result, namely, a change in the parties’ respective
participations ‘which absorbs the increase or decrease in the tax burden.’”®? Ecuador
conflated the clauses’ mandated result (full absorption) and the precise means to reach that
result (good-faith negotiations). The December 2006 letters confirm Perenco’s
contemporaneous understanding of the absorption clauses, for example: “the Consortium
will present the numbers which illustrate [the] economic impact on the Contract[s], in order
to determine the percentage of participation which should be adjusted in favor of the

Contractor.”*!

Ecuador’s alternative partial absorption theory was not what the Contracts provide. They
required that the correction absorb the increase or decrease in the tax burden, not only an

increment of the new tax.

(b) Ecuador’s Position

Ecuador stated that its position throughout this arbitration has been that since the economy
of the contract was never disturbed, the invocation of the Participation Contracts’ taxation
modification clauses would not have led to an adjustment of Perenco’s participation, and
therefore no damages are due.”* Ecuador argued that the economy of the contract was a
mathematical-economic equation underlying Clauses 8.1 of the Participation Contracts
which was either the Consortium’s expected average revenue of US$15/bbl or the
Consortium’s expected internal rate of return of around 15%.°* Perenco’s claim to full
absorption found no support in the Participation Contracts themselves (noting in this regard
that the Tribunal had found that the Renegotiation Clauses “did not stipulate how the
correction factor was to be calculated”).™* Further, Perenco’s reliance on Ecuador’s alleged

past practice in relation to VAT, SOTE and ECORAE charges is entirely misplaced.

Even if the Tribunal were to consider that modification was necessary so that the
Consortium might enjoy some form of unspecified ‘upside’ potential on oil prices, such
modification would not simply be to absorb the difference between Law 42 at 50% and
99% but only to absorb such amount necessary to provide the Consortium with the ‘upside’
exposure to oil prices to which the Tribunal appeared to consider that the Consortium was
entitled. As Brattle explained, on this theory, Law 42 would apply to the Consortium at a
rate of 81% for Block 21 and 99% for Block 7, but even at those rates, no modification of

the X factors was necessary.”

It argued further that since the Tribunal found that once Law 42 at 50% was implemented,

”°6 and since Perenco did

“it was incumbent upon [Perenco] to make its case ... at that time
not do so, it was too late to do so in the quantum phase by arguing it would have invoked
its rights “but for” Decree 662.°’ Ecuador considered that Perenco was relying on self-
serving evidence, “non-credible ex post facto testimonies” such as Mr. Marquez’s
statement that Perenco was simply waiting for the right opportunity to discuss the matter
properly.*® The simple truth was that, whether it believed the process was futile or not,
Perenco had determined not to seek the application of the Renegotiation Clauses with

respect to Law 42 at 50%.”

Ecuador argued therefore that Perenco could not now seek to invoke the Renegotiation

Clauses in the quantum phase to claim full absorption of Law 42.

(c) The Tribunal’s Decision

The issue is whether the damages to be awarded in respect of Decree 662 should be
calculated (i) for the entirety of the 99% of the extraordinary revenues set by the Decree;
(ii) for the additional 49% (i.e. above Law 42 at 50%) of the above-reference price value

required to be collected by Decree 662; or (iii) on some other basis.

The Tribunal begins by recalling that its Decision on Liability contains a finding that bears

on this issue. At paragraph 703, it stated:

“In the end, the narrow question for the Tribunal is whether Perenco,
having sought the aid of the Tribunal, could then take comfort that its
refusal to pay the 2008 Law 42 dues to Ecuador would protect it in this
arbitration without any potentially adverse consequences. The Tribunal
has carefully considered the Parties’ positions. It considers that Perenco
had a right to expect that Ecuador would desist from enforcing the
coactivas during the pendency of the arbitration. It also considers that in
deciding to withhold all Law 42 amounts claimed in 2008, Perenco
assumed that the Tribunal would accept its claims that none of the Law 42
dues claimed by the State were permi le under the Contracts or the

Treaty. Given that Perenco has not made out its claims in respect of Law
42 at 50%, the Tribunal holds that even though Ecuador should have
complied with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the coactivas ought
not to be included in the Tribunal’s analysis of the measures said
collectively to constitute an indirect expropriation...In_addition, to the
extent that Perenco has ded_in its claim that the lication_of

Decree 662 at 99% violated Article 4 of the Treaty, as found at paragraphs
606-607 above, the enforcement of the coactivas to collect the claimed
additional 49% constituted a breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard, but it was not an expropriation of the investment.)”! [Emphasis
added.]

The precise wording of this finding precludes awarding damages for Law 42’s effect prior
to the first breach. But the Tribunal also found that futility was proven as of 4 October
2007.'°! Beyond that, the Tribunal did not pass on what might be considered in the damages
phase with respect to the possible exercise of the tax modification clauses (except to note

how the contracts’ provisions were expected to operate). !°?

For the purposes of its damages analysis, the Tribunal considers that it must be assumed
that if Perenco exercised its contractual rights in the ‘but for’ scenario, Ecuador would have
responded in good faith by negotiating an absorption of the additional tax burden effected
by Decree 662. After considering the evidence, the Tribunal finds that in the ‘but for’
scenario for the period after Decree 662 came into effect, Perenco would have sought an
offset. But having regard to the evidence as whole, the Tribunal is not convinced that
Perenco would have sought the complete elimination of Law 42 (i.e. stabilisation at 0%).
Rather, it would have sought to undo the effect of Decree 662 and, to the extent reasonably

possible, Law 42.

The Tribunal’s reasoning in this respect is straightforward: (i) it was clear to all that
Ecuador was moving away from participation contracts and could be expected to require
that any new contracts that it might grant would not follow that model; (ii) even in the ‘but
for’ world, this change in the country’s hydrocarbons exploitation policy would exist as a

lawful fact; (iii) the Block 7 Participation Contract was approaching its expiry (in August

147.

2010) and Perenco was well aware of that fact and the need to adjust its expectations in
order to have any chance of obtaining an extension of its operatorship in Block 7; and (iv)
it is common ground between the Parties and was well understood at the time that Block 7

was the more valuable of the two Blocks.

In these circumstances, the Tribunal believes that Perenco would have recognised that the
extraordinary returns generated under the Participation Contracts due to the significant
increase in oil prices starting in the early 2000s were, for Ecuador, practically-speaking
unsustainable, having regard to the financial implications of the windfalls that had been
generated from the country’s finite hydrocarbon resources under this form of contract.
Moreover, Perenco’s interest in obtaining a contractual extension for Block 7 would have
provided a strong incentive for it to moderate its demands in seeking the full absorption of
Law 42. In short, the Tribunal believes that in the ‘but for’ world, Perenco would have been
most likely to seek a negotiation under the tax modification clauses that would have
reduced the State’s take of the extraordinary revenues, whilst maximising the company’s

chances of its obtaining an extension of its operatorship of Block 7.

The Tribunal thus holds that after Decree 662 entered into effect, Perenco would have been
prompted to trigger negotiations and the Parties would have agreed to Law 42 being

stabilised at 33% starting 5 October 2008, to be applied prospectively, for both contracts.

The Tribunal adds that while it might be that in the ‘but for’ world Perenco would use the
occasion of the tax modification negotiations simultaneously to seek a Block 7 extension,
it cannot be safely assumed that Ecuador would have agreed to an extension. The extension

issue is therefore addressed separately below.

The Tribunal holds that Perenco’s interests in the two Participation Contracts would be
adjusted to a stabilised Law 42 rate of 33% as of 5 October 2008 through to contract expiry.
2. Estimating the Direct Financial Impact of Law 42 at 99%

In terms of valuing the direct financial impact of Decree 662, Perenco’s NPV calculation
performed just after Decree 662 was promulgated permitted the Tribunal to perform a

rough estimate of the value of the company’s interests in the Blocks by subtracting the total

47

value of the revenues foregone in the remaining years of the Contracts in order to arrive at

an estimate of the residual value of Perenco’s interests (what might be termed the “below

Decree 662 reference price” value). This was also valued by Brattle and the results are as

To arrive at a final amount calculated on an ex ante basis, it is necessary to estimate how
many wells Perenco would have drilled in the ‘but for’ world. Here the Parties’ oilfields
experts (Perenco’s Mr. Crick, acting not as an independent expert, but rather as a fact
witness with certain technical expertise, and RPS, Ecuador’s technical experts) held very
different views as to what that drilling activity would have been undertaken but for Decree

662, an issue to which the Tribunal now turns.

3. Decree 662’s Impact on Perenco’s Drilling Plans for Block 7 and

Block 21
The evidence is that the decree led to a virtually immediate stoppage in the Consortium’s
drilling operations.'°° In Exhibit BR-26, the Perenco email which contained the results of
the company’s NPV calculations, there was some discussion about continuing with the plan
to drill Oso 23.'” But this was the sole exception to the cessation of drilling activity. Charts
depicting the company’s well-drilling history produced at the Tribunal’s request after the
Quantum Hearing showed that while Perenco drilled 11 wells in Block 21 in 2005, 13 in
2006 and one in 2007, it did not drill any wells in 2008 or in the first half of 2009
(whereupon it suspended operations).!!° Likewise, for Block 7, Perenco drilled six wells in
2005, 11 in 2006 and five in 2007, but it did not drill any wells in 2008 or in the first half
of 2009."1!

The Tribunal has no doubt that but for Decree 662, in the absence of its securing an
extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract, Perenco would have drilled more wells in
Block 7 up to August 2009 (one year before the Contract’s expiry, whereupon Perenco

would have ceased drilling wells due to the need to ensure an adequate payback before

Cl. Mem. Q., paragraph 47; d’Argentré WS V, paragraph 16; Perrodo WS II, paragraph 7.

Exhibit BR-26: In response to Mr. Daniel Kadjar’s query, “Do you recommend to drill Oso-23 and release
the rig afterwards or to release the rig after Oso-22?”, Mr. d’Argentré wrote in an email, “If we drill the
OSO23 we must explain to the state that this is the last one and that we do it because of contractual obligation
with the drilling contractor, and that it is obviously difficult to stop a campaign so quickly. In other words,
we don’t want the state to believe that we carry on drilling because it is still profitable. To answer your:
question I think we should drill OSO23 and send our termination notification to H&P in the meantime. We
have all drilling equipment ready plus the NPV is still around 3.7MS$.”

contract expiry!!?). As for Block 21 (which, at the time of Decree 662’s promulgation, still
had some 14 years left before the Contract expired), the Tribunal has to estimate a
reasonable drilling programme for that Block, which programme might reasonably be

expected to extend past the declaration of caducidad.

This exercise is also potentially bound up in the evaluation of the drilling activities after
the declaration of caducidad in that there are two periods with which the Tribunal is
concerned: (i) from 4 October 2007 to 20 July 2010; and (i) from 21 July 2010 to contract
expiry. This means weighing the Consortium’s actual plans up to 4 October 2007 which
were then put on hold and considering what would, on a balance of probabilities, likely
have happened in both blocks had Decree 662 not been promulgated. This will be used for
the first period. The Tribunal will then perform a further estimate as to what would have

happened after the declaration of caducidad.

This necessarily raises the question of the fate of the Block 7 Contract because Mr. Crick
indicated that the Consortium would have continued drilling in Block 7 at least up to
August 2009. He testified that this was when, in the absence of an extension, Perenco would
stop drilling new wells due to the need to enjoy a suitable payback period before
surrendering Block 7 to Ecuador.!!? Accordingly, the Tribunal will first consider whether,
in the ‘but for’ world, Perenco would have enjoyed an extension of its operatorship in Block

7 after August 2010.

(a) The question of an extension of the Block 7 Contract after August 2010

With good reason, the Parties have argued this issue at considerable length, since it
accounted for a substantial portion of Perenco’s revised claim of a total of US$1.493 billion

in damages. (See Brattle’s Waterfall Chart reproduced above at paragraph 65.) As already

Tr. Q. (3) 627:14-22 (Mr. Crick’s Direct Presentation).

Crick WS II, paragraph 147: “I have assumed that Perenco would have achieved an average of one well per
month, and I assume that it would have stopped any new investments one year before the end of the contract.
[August 2010 expiry date for the Block 7 Contract].”

50

noted, Perenco’s rights under the contract to the Block 7 Oso Field were the most valuable

of Perenco’s Ecuadorian assets. '!*

According to the Contract, Perenco’s interest in Block 7 was to expire on 16 August 2010,
and as events transpired, this occurred some 27 days after the declaration of caducidad was

issued.!!5

The Contract contained a clause that permitted the Contract to be extended in certain

circumstances:

“Clause 6.2 Production Period: In this case, the Production Period shall

last until August sixteenth (16), two thousand ten (2010); this term may be

extended, provided that it is in the State’s best interest, for the following
reasons:

. When the Production area is located far from existing hydrocarbon
production infrastructure, with the prior approval of the Ministry of
Energy and Mines and for a period of up to five (5) years;

. When the Contractor proposes significant new investments during
the last five (5) years of the Production Period, with the prior
agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines and the approval of
the CEL, provided that adequate amortization periods are required
for those investments;

. If the Commercially Exploitable Hydrocarbon Deposits are
discovered as an exclusive result of new exploration work
performed by the Contractor, the Production Period shall be
extended with the prior agreement of the Ministry of Energy and
Mines and the approval of the CEL.”'!®

(i) Perenco’s Position

Perenco argued vigorously that its contractual rights would not have expired, but rather in
the ‘but for’ world it would have been permitted to operate the field in some form or

another. In this regard, it pointed to evidence of other extensions granted by Ecuador to

Perenco’s Chairman, Frangois Perrodo, likewise stated that the Block 7 Contract extension was a “high
priority” for Perenco and that Perenco was prepared to offer significant value to obtain an extension. Perrodo.

operators during the relevant period.!!’ It also noted that even during the time that it
operated under Decree 662 at 99%, it was negotiating an alternative arrangement with
Petroecuador — the so-called Acta— and that the parties had arrived at an agreement which
was not consummated because Perenco’s fellow consortium member, Burlington, having
decided to withdraw from Ecuador, refused to agree to its terms. As the Tribunal found,
this refusal of its fellow Consortium member was essentially held against Perenco by

Ecuador.!!8

[1] Ecuador did not have unfettered discretion whether or not to grant an

extension

Perenco argued first that the evidence showed that a good faith exercise of Ecuador’s
discretion under Clause 6.2 would more likely than not have led to an extension of
Perenco’s Block 7 operatorship. Ecuador did not have unfettered discretion to refuse to
extend Perenco’s Block 7 operatorship. As Dr. Pérez Loose testified, a fair reading of
Clause 6.2 would be that when any of the three circumstances for extension were met,!!?
the State’s best interest was presumptively satisfied and Ecuador was obliged to grant an

extension, 2°

[2] The Parties could have agreed to extend on different terms

 

Perenco also contested Ecuador’s reading of Clause 6.2 to the effect that it permitted only

an extension of the expiration date of Block 7 Contract, and no amendments of any of the

contract’s other terms, as being both unsupported by the contractual language and
unrealistic. It was indeed discredited by Ecuador’s own sweeping practice of extending the

operatorships of existing contractors on amended contractual terms. '*!

Ecuador had not contested the fact that it was prepared to extend Perenco’s Block 7
operatorship on different terms from the existing ones, and that it would have done so had
it complied with its international and contractual obligations. Ecuador’s witnesses such as
Messrs. Davalos, Palacios, Pinto, and Chiriboga repeatedly acknowledged during the
merits phase that they wanted Perenco to continue operating in Block 7.'”? As for Perenco’s
witnesses, they confirmed that the extension was a high priority for the company and that
they believed that they could have reached an agreement with Ecuador but for the unlawful
acts. This was corroborated by contemporaneous internal documents and correspondence

with Ecuador and was not tested on cross-examination. '3

The Parties’ mutual interest in extending Perenco’s operations in Block 7 was consistent
with the longstanding historical practice in the upstream oil industry generally, and

especially in Ecuador, to extend the contracts of incumbent operators. According to Mr.

Resp. C-Mem. Q, paragraph 118 which cites the amended contracts for Block 10, Block 14, Block 16, Block
17, MDC, PBHI and Tarapoa but asserting that these contracts were not extended.

See Palacios WS I, paragraph 22; Palacios WS II, paragraphs 25, 33: Pinto WS I, paragraphs 22-23; Pinto
WS II, paragraphs 9, 17-18; Chiriboga WS I, paragraphs 12-13; Tr. Q. (4) 936:2-17 (Chiriboga). Counsel for
Perenco also submitted: “Ecuador —and this will be a theme of my presentation— was always, Members of
the Tribunal, a very reasonable partner. Also in his letter of the 1st of March 2006, President Palacio has
stated the following: ‘On repeated occasions I have invited the oil companies that have contracts with the
Ecuadorian State to initiate processes of reaching an understanding for the equitable distribution of the
extraordinary earnings. Nonetheless, these invitations have not been responded to, a situation that further
justifies the reforms proposed without this meaning that the renegotiation process has been closed.’ Well, at
the same time President Palacio was submitting the draft of what became Law 42, President Palacio was
expressly saying that the negotiation could be possible, that he expected —he hoped that he could actually
go to the table, at the table with the oil companies and discuss the oil contracts. [...]

 

As a rapid review of the essential facts from Law 42 to the termination of the Participation Contracts through
caducidad shows, Ecuador was always a reasonable partner. You saw that in the invitations to negotiate in
2005. You saw that in the letter of President Palacio of the Ist of March 2006. And, hence, Ecuador was
always willing to negotiate, but let's go right away to the facts ...” (Tr. M. (1) 275:10-22; 276:1-6; 281:4-11).

Davalos’ testimony on redirect examination, Ecuador apparently declined to extend

contracts only twice over the past three decades. '*+

In 2010 alone, Ecuador executed seven amended oil contracts, extending the terms of six

of the original contracts by between six and fifteen years. !?°

Ultimately, Perenco was open to concluding a reasonable services contract for the
extension period. Perenco argued that Ecuador did not deny that it would be reasonable to
assume that the extension terms would have been somewhere between the parties’ initial
negotiating positions, and somewhat closer to Ecuador’s initial position than to Perenco’s,
a reasonable proxy for which is effectively Law 42 at 37.5%. The Eni (AGIP) services
contract extension provides strong support for this conclusion. That was a services contract
in a neighbouring block in which Ecuador agreed to an eleven-year extension. Perenco
specifically considered an AGIP-type contract as part of its contemporaneous extension
strategy. Therefore, that contract is a good benchmark for the terms that Ecuador would
have accepted for an extension. Perenco noted that Brattle’s reports offered no opinion on

any extension case.

[3] Extension would have been in Ecuador’s best interests

As for Ecuador’s argument that it would have been negligent for the State to extend
Perenco’s operatorship of Block 7 because the economic proposition was unattractive,
Perenco argued that Ecuador’s assertion relied on a flawed economic analysis. In Perenco’s
view, Professor Dow’s analysis assessed the value of a Block 7 extension to only extend to
the acceleration of investment and production, but failed to assess the benefits of partnering
with experienced private contractors. In any event, Professor Dow also undervalued the

benefit of such acceleration.

At the Quantum Hearing, Professor Dow conceded that a contract extension would have
resulted in benefits to Ecuador exceeding the amount paid to Perenco and would thus be in
Ecuador’s best interest.'° Professor Dow admitted that Ecuador’s costs of capital during
the 2008 to 2010 period were likely to be much higher than Perenco’s 12% cost of capital
and that in his calculations of the extension value he failed to account for the high
opportunity costs of Ecuador’s having to invest its own capital in the oil industry instead

of in the public sector. !7”

Further, Ecuador failed to adduce any evidence to support its claims that its policy to
migrate to services contracts and Perenco’s allegedly unsatisfactory environmental

practices meant that extending Perenco’s operatorship was not in Ecuador’s interest. !?

[4] | Perenco had met the conditions for extension under Clause 6.2
Perenco asserted further that it had met the two conditions for extension under Clause 6.2.

First, its discovery of oil in the Hollin reservoir in the Oso field met the requirement of
discovery of new “Commercially Exploitable Hydrocarbon Deposits.” These were “those
deposits of Crude Oil which, in the judgment of the Contractor, are commercial deposits
and are included in an approved Development Plan or an Additional Development Plan.”
Perenco did not need to discover new fields. It was immaterial that Perenco had not raised
its discovery of the Oso Hollin deposit as a possible ground for extension in its September

2007 Budget Committee Meeting (“BCM”).

Second, it proposed significant new investments during the last five years of the Contract.
Perenco had proposed drilling up to 16 further wells in its 2006 Oso Plan of Development
and their positive results would have led to substantial further investment which would in
turn have been grounds for an extension of the Contract. In September 2007, Perenco also

planned to propose additional projects in exchange for a Block 7 extension. Even during

the 2008 negotiations, Perenco agreed to a minimum investment of US$110 million in

Block 7.

[5] Perenco would have drilled 70 new wells in the event of an extension
to 2018

On the assumption that Block 7 would have been extended, albeit on different terms, Mr.
Crick’s ‘but for’ drilling plan for Block 7 focused mainly on the Oso Field. Perenco
observes that not only did it propose precisely the 70 wells included in Mr. Crick’s
programme in its 2008 Internal Review, but Petroamazonas has now drilled some 105 new
wells in Oso, and based on its April 2014 Oso Development Plan, it intends to drill 28
more.!”° Petroamazonas is on track to drill roughly double the number of Oso wells that
Mr. Crick planned.'*° This was confirmed at the Quantum Hearing by Mr. d’Argentré!*!

and Mr. Crick.'*

Mr. Crick’s analysis was reviewed by Dr. Strickland, the Claimant’s independent expert in
these proceedings. His C.V. includes 37 years’ experience performing and supervising
reservoir engineering and geological projects including field studies, economic valuations,

audits and field unitizations. 3

Dr. Strickland reviewed Mr. Crick’s plan and noted that these numbers were based on a
development plan that Perenco created in late 2008 and appeared reasonable in light of the
much greater development of the field that Petroamazonas had since undertaken. '** Since

2009, Petroamazonas had drilled 142 wells in Block 7, 105 of which have been in Oso.'*°

would have agreed to an extension in Block 7, the only question remaining was the
economic terms on which such extension would have been granted. Since the 2008 acta
terms were the product of what the Tribunal has already held to be coercion, '** terms agreed
without such coercion would naturally have been more favourable to Perenco.!*?
176. In Perenco’s submission, the Quantum Hearing demonstrated the reasonableness of

Professor Kalt’s approach to estimating the extension’s value. Ecuador did not deny that it

would be reasonable to assume that the extension terms would have been somewhere

between the parties’ initial negotiating positions, and somewhat closer to Ecuador’s initial

position than to Perenco’s, a reasonable proxy for which is effectively Law 42 at 37.5%.!°

Perenco’s approach towards determining the value of the contract extension is therefore a
reasonable proxy for the value that would have been generated in a fair negotiation between
the parties had Ecuador never acted unlawfully. Perenco has even assumed that Ecuador
would have done better in the negotiations and adjusted the bid-and-ask meeting point to
the lower quartile of the difference between Perenco’s ‘best case’ scenario (no Law 42)

and Ecuador’s ‘best case’ scenario (Law 42 at 50%).'#!

; toot . 142
In Perenco’s submission, the AGIP services contract extension!”

provides strong support
for this conclusion.'*? That was a services contract (hence consistent with Ecuador’s
claimed policy direction) in a neighbouring block in which Ecuador agreed to an 11-year
extension, so it was nearly 40% longer than the period of the extension that Perenco claims
in this arbitration. Perenco specifically considered an AGIP-type contract as part of its
contemporaneous “extension strategy.” '** Therefore, the contract is a good benchmark for
the terms Ecuador would have accepted for an extension. Whether it is used to corroborate

Professor Kalt’s approach'“5, or as a substitute approach, the result is comparable.

Relying upon Professor Kalt’s analysis, Perenco argued that the quantum of damages owed
to Perenco in respect to the extension of Block 7 is in the area of US$600 to 625 million

(US$626 million based on Law 42 at 37.5% or US$604 million based on the AGIP contract,

used as a proxy for which Perenco and Ecuador would have agreed in the ‘but for’

world). '46

(ii) Ecuador’s Position

Ecuador argued that Block 7 would not have been extended for a variety of reasons,
including: (i) Ecuador had the discretion to grant or not an extension, but not to extend it
on different terms; (ii) it would not have been in the State’s interests to grant the extension;
and (iii) Perenco had not met the requirements to trigger the exercise of discretion under
Clause 6.2 of the Contract. The issue before the Tribunal was whether the Participation
Contract should somehow be extended, not whether it would have been renegotiated into
an AGIP-kind of services contract. Moreover, the facts showed that renegotiation failed
due to, among other reasons, Burlington’s decision not to engage in a renegotiation but

rather to exit Ecuador. '*7

[1] Ecuador enjoyed ample discretion to grant or not an extension of the Block
7 Participation Contract

Ecuador argued that the Quantum Hearing demonstrated that Clause 6.2 of the Block 7
Participation Contract encompassed two layers of discretion — the State: (i) “may” extend
the existing contract; and (ii) “if and when it is in the State’s best interest” — which
discretion was triggered, if and only if, at least one of the three technical requirements

under Clause 6.2 was satisfied.

As to the first layer of discretion, the wording of Clause 6.2 of the Contract was clear
(“...this term may be extended, if and when it is in the State’s best interest, for the following
reasons...” [Emphasis added.]). This granted ample discretion to Ecuador to decide
whether to extend, or not, the term of the existing Contract’s Production Period. In

Ecuador’s view, Dr. Pérez Loose was unable to escape the language of Clause 6.2'8 and

Mr. Perrodo had candidly recognised Ecuador’s discretionary power to grant or not an

extension. '”?

Ecuador criticised Perenco’s proposed interpretation for failing to give effect to the

150. 151

expressed intention of the parties '°”; it did not give effect to Clause 6.2 as a whole’”’ as Dr.

152, and the word “shall” in

Pérez Loose ultimately acknowledged under cross-examination
sub-clause 6.2.3 could not override the word “may” in the chapeau of Clause 6.2 which
commanded the entire provision. Sub-clause 6.2.3 related to the act of obtaining the prior
agreement of the Ministry of Energy and Mines, and the approval of the Special Bidding

Committee.

Perenco also could not prove a purported practice in Ecuador of extending all oil contracts
because there was no such practice. As Dr. Davalos had testified, there were two instances
(Texaco and Sinopec) when Ecuador had not granted an extension because they were not
in its best interests. '°? Even if there were such a practice, this could not legally override the

discretion that Ecuador held under Clause 6.2.

Finally, Perenco could not rely on the good faith principle under Ecuadorian law to

transform the word “may” into “shall.”

[2] An extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract would not have been in

the State’s best interest

Clause 6.2 provided a second layer of discretion reserved to the State, given that the
Production Period may only be extended “if and when it is in the State’s best interest.” As
Dr. Aguilar explained, in establishing the public interest, the State must see first whether

the event has occurred. If that occurred, the next step was to decide whether or not it was

appropriate to extend the Contract. '** Extending the Participation Contract would not have

been in Ecuador’s best interests for the following reasons.

First, Ecuador had chosen at the relevant time to adopt a policy of migration from
participation contracts to services contracts. Contrary to Perenco’s contention, Ecuador’s
witnesses had testified to the failed renegotiation of the Participation Contracts and not to
the potential extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract.'°> Even if Perenco argued
that it would have accepted a different model for the extension of its Block 7 operatorship,
Perenco had only calculated the Block 7 extension value based on Law 42 at 37.5%; this
must mean that this was an extension under a participation contract (as Law 42 only applied
to such contracts), Perenco’s last minute change of the basis of its valuation to employ

AGIP’s services contract must be therefore be dismissed outright.

Second, it would have been uneconomical for Ecuador. Ecuador was not just guided by
economic gain, but by a plethora of objectives. Perenco’s expert, Dr. Pérez Loose, was
forced to retract his proposition that the State’s interests were reduced to obtaining the
largest amount of oil possible, as he ultimately admitted that they encompassed other
issues, such as health, the environment, defence, etc.'*° Perenco could not rely on ex post
facto evidence from its own witnesses as to the purported benefits of an extension, and that
it was a high priority for Perenco, to argue that Parties would have agreed on the

extension.'°7

Third, Perenco was not a responsible environmental steward, and it would likely be held

liable for having caused contamination in the Blocks.

[3] Perenco did not meet the technical requirements under Clause 6.2

Perenco suggested that Ecuador had not disproved at the Quantum Hearing that the two
technical requirements in Clause 6.2 invoked by Perenco were met. On the one hand, the
burden of proof falls on Perenco. On the other hand, and as shown by Ecuador in its Post-
Hearing Brief!>8, Perenco failed to demonstrate that it satisfied even one of the technical

requirements under Clause 6.2.

In this respect, Perenco failed to show that it had discovered new Commercially Exploitable
Hydrocarbon Deposits as an exclusive result of new exploration work pursuant to Clause
6.2.3. The evidence adduced at the Quantum Hearing confirmed that Perenco benefited
from existing log data already showing the presence of oil in the Hollin. Mr. Combe also
confirmed that BP, Perenco’s predecessor in the Block, had conducted the first exploration
activities at Oso in the 1980s.'*? The presence of oil was confirmed in 1988!°° and Perenco

was in possession of this information before it drilled Oso 3.!°!

Therefore, Perenco had not included this alleged discovery when it drilled the Oso 3 well
in the Hollin reservoir as part of its strategy for extension in the September 2007 Budget
Committee Meeting. Nor did it allocate any value to an extension when it calculated the

NPV of its investment in 2007.

Perenco did not propose significant new investments before the Participation Contract’s
expiry in order to qualify for an extension. The Quantum Hearing confirmed that Perenco
knew full well that an extension of the Production Period was uncertain. As a consequence,
from 2007 onwards, Perenco acted accordingly and accelerated investments and project

development to ensure payback within the contract’s term:

“Q. So, Mr. Perrodo, is it fair to say that, from 2007, absent a contract
extension, Perenco would only make investments in Block 7 that could be
amortized or paid back before August 2010?

A. [...] my decision was to, you know, make as much money as possible
in case, you know, we wouldn’t be granted an extension, which is clearly
not what we wished for, but that’s the reason why we decided to accelerate
the developments.” !©

[4] Eveninah hetical extension scenario, Mr. Crick’s drilling programme
would not have occurred

Ecuador further criticises Perenco’s Block 7 extension scenario, with the 127-well!®
waterflood project advocated by Mr. Crick, as being yet another “cynical attempt by
Perenco to grossly inflate” its claim.'* Mr. Crick had based his forecast on a flawed
methodology. This flaw was most readily apparent from the significant discrepancy

between Mr. Crick’s forecasted production and the actual production from the Oso field.

The only 2 single well pilot projects undertaken at the Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields
failed to establish the continuity of the Napo U formation rock, the cornerstone for a
successful waterflood project. Confronted with the fact that the pilot well at Lobo did not
have the same impact on two equidistant wells, Mr. Crick conceded that this could be due
to the discontinuity of the formation rock in this field.'®° Dr. Strickland was also forced to
acknowledge that the results from the limited study undertaken (i.e., one injector well in
each of the Lobo and Payamino fields) show heterogeneity (or discontinuity) in the tested

Napo reservoir. !°

Perenco’s subsequent attempt to argue that Mr. Crick’s “S-spot” development pattern
would de-risk the development and account for any discontinuities only reinforced the

inconclusive results obtained by the Consortium. Perenco was equally misplaced in seeking

to support Mr. Crick’s 127-well waterflood project through documents reflecting the risky
investments proposed by the Consortium during the contract extension negotiations. !©’ In
fact, Ecuador argued, these documents: (i) showed that the Consortium was only
contemplating a maximum of 29 waterflood wells in an extension scenario;, and (ii) did

not even mention a ‘5-spot’ development pattern. '®

Ecuador argued that Perenco persisted with Mr. Crick’s 37-well waterflood project in the
Basal Tena reservoir in Coca-Payamino without even having undertaken any pilot testing
in this reservoir and notwithstanding Mr. d’Argentré’s acknowledging that, for a
waterflood project to work, the concept must first be proved in the reservoir.'© Even Dr.
Strickland had to concede that, “[i]n the Basal Tena, [...] the waterflood reserves are more
29170

uncertain there because no pilot has been instigated” causing “greater uncertainty,

thereby further undermining Mr. Crick’s waterflood project.

Further, ex post data, on which Perenco so heavily relied, did not support waterflooding as
a viable development strategy in Block 7. Indeed, Ryder Scott —a company specialised in

m1

waterflood projects ''’— had not once mentioned it in its reports to Petroamazonas.

Finally, Perenco was incorrect in alleging that Mr. Combe and Mr. d’Argentré provided
support for Mr. Crick’s waterflood project. Mr. Combe never even addressed
waterflooding.'’? Mr. d’Argentré did, but his testimony could hardly be presented as
supporting Mr. Crick’s extensive waterflood project given that: (i) he did not know how
many wells Mr. Crick was proposing to drill as part of this project; and (ii) he did not think
Mr. Crick was proposing a lot of development in those fields, because they were already

developed.'”? Perenco failed to point to any evidence indicating that the Consortium

project in the northern part of the Block. Mr. Combe conceded that the Consortium

“envisioned that all the development or future development would be around Oso.”!74

[5] Form and value of an extension

Ecuador argued that both sides’ experts confirmed at the Hearing the unreasonableness of
Perenco’s extraordinarily high extension value (presenting over 40% of Perenco’s claimed
damages). The DCF analysis should not include a hypothetical extension, even more so
when Perenco’s contemporaneous assumptions did not assign any value to a potential

extension.

In assessing the purported value of a hypothetical extension, Professor Kalt did not apply
the terms of the Actas de Acuerdo Parcial of 2008. Instead, Perenco came up with its own
terms for a new contract.!?> Professor Kalt did not calculate a value for a renegotiated
services contract (in light of Ecuador’s policy to migrate to services contracts), and

therefore Perenco failed to discharge its burden of proof.

On the economics of extension, the issue was not whether extension could have created
benefits for Ecuador, but what price Ecuador would have been willing to pay for those
benefits. Perenco’s terms assumed that Ecuador would have agreed to pay more than the
economic benefits it could have expected from an extension. Brattle amply demonstrated
that it would have made no economic sense for Ecuador to agree to an extension on
Perenco’s terms because they gave “more than 100 percent share of the [value generated

by the extension] for the Contractor.”!7°

Ecuador framed the issue as follows: Ecuador would agree to pay Perenco on top of the
standard return an additional US$626 million for Perenco to continue operating Block 7

until 2018 when Ecuador was due to receive the fields for free in August 2010 (i.e. at

Tr. Q. (2) 326:16-17 (Combe).

de Acuerdo Parcial of 2008 would amount to US$1.144 million as of July 2015.

contract expiration) and any contractor could have taken over the operations then — only if
Perenco offered Ecuador benefits no other contractor could. The only unique benefit
Perenco could articulate at the Quantum Hearing was Mr. Crick’s purported knowledge of
the fields — and that Ecuador would have granted an 800% IRR which Professor Kalt
asserted would be worth $968 million.!”” However, this would already be part of the costs
in Brattle’s model, together with the other benefits that any other operator could provide.
Thus, Ecuador’s cost of borrowing is irrelevant: Ecuador could contract with another

private contractor, as it did with YPF in Block 21.

In response to Perenco’s criticism that “Professor Dow’s analysis wrongly assumed that
Ecuador could have reaped all of the extension benefits — except acceleration — for free”,!”8
Ecuador explained that a zero NPV (for the acceleration) did not mean that the costs are
zero, but the costs had already been factored into the calculation (through the discount rate).
Brattle had assumed that Ecuador would pay for an extension the standard return (discount

rate) offered to contractors (i.e. 12%).

Finally, Ecuador pointed out that Perenco’s claim (to justify its unrealistic extension terms)
that Ecuador agreed in the AGIP contract to a 25% rate of return on invested capital was
misleading because (i) the 25% rate of return in the AGIP contract relates exclusively to
investments in exploration or secondary recovery techniques, i.e. high-risk investments!”?;
and (ii) for production from existing fields, the AGIP contract sets a $35 tariff/barrel

produced. The AGIP contract was thus not a good comparable to Block 7.
(iii) The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal has carefully considered this important issue and begins by setting out some

general findings that have guided its analysis.

First, it takes note of the submissions concerning the precise wording of Clause 6.2 of the
Participation Contract. It accepts Ecuador’s argument that the State had a substantial
measure of discretion when it came to deciding whether to grant an extension. Perenco
itself accepted that Clause 6.2 was discretionary and the Tribunal did not find persuasive
Dr. Pérez Loose’s attempt to narrow the scope of Ecuador’s discretion so as to make

contract extension virtually mandatory. !*°

Second, the Tribunal considers that even in the ‘but for’ world an “extension” would at its
best, from Perenco’s perspective, not have entailed an extension of the existing
Participation Contract, but rather the Parties would have agreed that a new model would
govern their relationship. Given the way in which the Parties’ arguments developed, the
Tribunal considers that Perenco essentially conceded this to be the case.'*! Hence its
argument that a services contract in some form would be granted and Law 42 at 37.5% was
used as a proxy for the specific terms that the Parties could have agreed for the extension
period had Ecuador not acted unlawfully.'*? Third, the Tribunal takes note of Ecuador’s
evidence that some contracts were not extended.'** This however is not very compelling
evidence; Mr. Davalos, when cross-examined on this point, was able to identify only two
such instances of non-extension over the past three decades. '* Moreover, Ecuador did not
tender any witnesses to testify that the State would not have extended the operatorship at

issue in the instant case and given that earlier in the proceeding, different witnesses,

8 (Pérez Loose); Loose ER VII, paragraph 52.

Perenco asserted: “Ecuador's reading of Clause 6.2 to permit only an extension of the expiration date of the
Block 7 Contract, and no amendments to any other terms, is unsupported by the contractual language and
unrealistic.” (Cl. Rep. Q., paragraph 164).

Cl. Rep. Q., paragraph 171. See also Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 120: “The unrebutted evidence also shows that
Perenco was open to concluding a reasonable services contract for the extension period. Cf. Tr. Q. (1) 137:14-

187

including former ministers, conceded that Ecuador wanted Perenco to continue to operate,

the absence of such testimony is telling.

The record evidence in fact suggests a willingness on the State’s part to deal with

incumbent operators. As counsel for Perenco pointed out in closing argument:

. in 2010, Ecuador executed seven amended contracts, extending the
terms of all of them, and in 2014, Ecuador extended the terms of three
expiring Services Contracts with another three operators. Thus, even if
Ecuador had discretion to grant an extension, so long as it was exercised
in good faith, the facts compel a conclusion that Ecuador would, indeed,
have extended Perenco’s term in Block 7.”!*°

The evidence of extensions also accords with common sense. There are considerations of
convenience resulting from the incumbent’s knowledge of and experience with the unique
operating characteristics of each oilfield, the operator’s access to a lower cost of capital

186

than that which the State could achieve’*®, the professional relationships between operators

and their counterparts in the State’s regulatory apparatus, and so on.

The Tribunal is convinced that there is substantial evidence that, all other things being
equal, senior officials and ministers of Ecuador would have preferred that Perenco continue
its operatorship of Block 7 rather than its leaving the Block. There is a substantial body of
evidence on the record to support this finding in addition to the general evidence showing

that Ecuador tended to extend operatorships. '*”

The fundamental problem for the extension claim is that it is not possible, on the evidence
before it, for the Tribunal to know what contractual terms might have been arrived at in a

successful negotiation but for the unlawful acts. Having regard to the situation in the last

quarter of calendar year 2008, the Tribunal recalls that, as Perenco asserted in its pleadings

As pointed out by Perenco in Cl. Mem. Q., paragraph 146: “In 2010 alone, Ecuador executed seven amended
oil contracts, extending the terms of six of the original contracts by between six and fifteen years. See
http://www.hidrocarburos.gob.ec/biblioteca/ (website of the Hydrocarbons Secretariat, containing links to the
amended contracts for Block 10, Block 14, Block 16, Block 17, MDC, PBHI, and Tarapoa).” See also CE-

during the merits phase, it did sign the Minutes of Partial Agreement (the actual title of the
Actas), and did what it could to reach a solution acceptable to all parties.'** But it faced
Burlington’s disinterest, Ecuador’s insistence that both members of the Consortium agree
to the new arrangement, and the fact that the minutes themselves did not constitute a

binding legal agreement.

In this regard, the Tribunal recalls what Perenco asserted during the merits phase of the

arbitration:

The Minutes were, rather, without prejudice minutes of the parties’
negotiations, which set forth certain commercial issues on the basis of
which the parties agreed to continue their negotiations. RMP WS {IJ 31-
33, 58-59. The Minutes contained an express reservation of all rights; they
stated on their face that they were not binding; and they expressly referred
to the need for all parties (including Burlington) to execute duly agreed
contractual modifications before any of the points recorded in the Minutes
could take effect. See RMP WS {[ 32; see also, e.g., E-84, p. 2 (“The parties
declare that the information contained in the present Minutes of Partial
Agreement . . . will not be binding.”); ibid. p. 2 (“The parties declare that
these agreements will be incorporated into the general negotiations that
will take place in the following days and will concern mainly the following
points: Arbitration and Mediation Clause. . . .”); E-87, [ 6 and E-89, {8
(“For the application and validity of this agreement the parties shall
negotiate and execute the Transitory Participation Contracts . . ..”); E-87,
p. 2 (“This agreement is without prejudice and does not constitute a waiver
of the rights to which Perenco Ecuador Limited and PETROECUADOR
believe they are entitled .. . .”) and E-89, p. 2 (“The agreements contained
in these minutes are without prejudice and do not constitute a waiver of
the rights to which Perenco Ecuador Limited and PETROECUADOR
believe they are entitled . . ..”). It was perfectly clear to all concerned that
no binding agreement modifying the Contracts could be reached without
Burlington’s agreement. See also GCZ WS { 24 (acknowledging the
Minutes were subject to Burlington approval).'*? [Emphasis added.]

Indeed, when defending its inability to persuade Burlington to continue negotiations,

Perenco argued that “Burlington cannot be faulted for refusing to accept the vague,

incomplete and risky substitute contract it was being offered and to take on faith that its

economic interests would be preserved.” °° [Emphasis added.]

 

This is the fundamental difficulty facing this claim. The October 2008 Acta, which is the
last indication of an apparent shared ‘in principle’ intention to establish a contractual basis
for the Consortium’s continued operation of Block 7, was in the form of “minutes” and
itself was not put into final legal form. The intention of the parties at the time was that, if
finally agreed, the Acta would be a transitory agreement that would be succeeded by some
form of services contract. But the final expression of the Acta itself, let alone the expression
of the parties’ respective rights and obligations in the contract that would follow, were
never reduced to writing. In the end, the Tribunal considers that Perenco’s characterisation
of the Acta as a “vague, incomplete and risky substitute contract” illustrates the inherent

difficulties of choosing a proxy for the Block 7 extension scenario.

Perenco saw the AGIP Contract as a proxy for what would have happened to Block 7 and
adverted to the fact that it had considered a contract of this type as part of its extension
negotiation strategy.!°! This part of its damages claim therefore married together the
financial aspects of that contract with Mr. Crick’s ‘but for’ drilling programme for

Block 7.

But this approach founders on Perenco’s concession that there is no record evidence that
Ecuador ever considered that the AGIP Contract could be a model for an extension of the

Block 7 operatorship for Perenco.!%? For all of these reasons, the idea of employing a

Ibid., paragraph 495.
See Cl. PHB Q., paragraph 130: “The Eni (AGIP) services contract extension (CE-328) provides strong
support for this conclusion. Cf. Tr. Q. (1) 149:16-150:1 (Cl. Opening); PMQ { 153. That was a services
contract (hence consistent with Ecuador’s claimed policy direction) in a neighboring block in which Ecuador
agreed to an eleven-year extension, so one that was nearly 40% longer than what Perenco claims in this
arbitration. Perenco specifically considered an Eni-type contract as part of its contemporaneous ‘extension
strategy’ See, e.g., E-387, Slides 105, 107; BR-32, Slides 36-37; see also Tr. Q. (1) 149:16-150:1 (Cl.
Opening), PMQ { 153. “Therefore, the Eni contract is a good benchmark for the terms Ecuador would have
accepted for an extension. Whether it is used to corroborate Prof. Kalt’s approach (see Tr. Q. (5) 1448:21-
1449:2 (Kalt); JK ER IV 5, 9, 125-126; JK-64), or as a substitute approach, the result is comparable.”

services contract like the Block 10 AGIP Contract as a proxy for what might or might not

have been agreed for Block 7 is, in the end, a bridge too far for the Tribunal.

The Tribunal has also taken note of the fact that much of Perenco’s damages analysis is
based on what Petroamazonas has done since it assumed operation of the Blocks. But the
Tribunal is not convinced that the economics of the operations of Petroamazonas, a State—
owned entity, provides an appropriate “apples to apples” comparator of what Perenco

would have done in the ‘but for’ scenario. !%°

Asa matter of law, the Tribunal is also mindful of the fact that the decisions of international
courts, tribunals, and claims commissions show that while financially assessable damages
are to be awarded, the adjudicator must seek to avoid awarding speculative damages. As
the BG Group tribunal noted:

“,.Damages that are ‘too indirect, remote, and uncertain to be appraised’

are to be excluded. In line with this principle, the Tribunal would add that

an award for damages which are speculative would equally run afoul of
“full reparation” under the ILC Draft Articles.”'"*

Having regard to all of the circumstances, therefore, the Tribunal considers that it is too
remote, uncertain and ultimately too speculative to accept Perenco’s extension argument,
particularly when Perenco itself accepted that it is necessary to use other contractual models
as a proxy for what might have been agreed between the Parties. At the end of the day, it
simply cannot be ruled out that the Parties might have been unable to arrive at an agreement
or for its own reasons the State might have simply decided in an exercise of its lawful
discretion not to extend the Block 7 contract. There is, therefore, in the present
circumstances an insufficient degree of confidence as to the terms of a contract that might

have been concluded such that there could be an estimate of lost cash flows.

All of that said, the Tribunal is firmly of the view that Perenco has adduced persuasive

evidence that it suffered a loss of opportunity and further that this loss is compensable. The

Murphy v. Ecuador took a similar approach in rejecting that claimant’s reliance on what Repsol achieved in
after it took over operations from Murphy. See Murphy v. Ecuador, paragraph 485.

Tribunal notes in this regard that the Burlington tribunal found that the claimant in that
case did not make out its ‘loss of opportunity’ claim. But this points to a key difference in
the facts before the Burlington tribunal and those before the present Tribunal. The
Burlington tribunal appears to have been influenced by the fact that Burlington itself
appeared to have assigned a zero value to the chance of a contract extension in 2007.!%°
The evidence before the present Tribunal is quite different. As the Tribunal’s Decision on
Liability found, Perenco sought ways to preserve its presence in Ecuador and to arrive at
some form of accommodation with the State.!®° Indeed, the Tribunal found that Ecuador’ s
holding Burlington’s recalcitrance against Perenco constituted a breach of the Treaty.!°” It
also appears that Burlington and Perenco argued over the course of action to be followed. !%
In these circumstances, the Tribunal is of the view that in the ‘but for’ world of dealings
between Perenco and Ecuador, there was a real opportunity for the incumbent operator to
extend its operation of Block 7, which opportunity was lost due to the unlawful conduct of

the State.

The loss of opportunity is thus established and compensable and the Tribunal’s estimate of

that loss is addressed below in Section ILI.10.

The upshot of the foregoing analysis is that since the Tribunal has found that it cannot
assume that the extension of Block 7 would have been based on the AGIP contract or some
other proxy, Mr. Crick’s drilling plans for Block 7 for the period after the date of the Block
7 Contract’s expiry on 16 August 2010 cannot be taken into consideration. With the
Participation Contract’s having come to an end shortly after the expropriation, there is no
basis for considering the hypothetical drilling plans that might have been implemented had

the Contract been extended.'?

The Tribunal turns to the ‘but for’ drilling scenarios.

(b) Block 7 ‘but for’ drilling programme from Decree 662 to August 2010

Since the Block 7 Participation Contract expired in August 2010 and in light of the
Tribunal’s finding above, the Tribunal is concerned only with the impact of Decree 662

upon the Consortium’s drilling activities in Block 7 up to August 2010.
(i) Perenco’s position

Having regard to the August 2010 contract expiry scenario, Mr. Crick estimated that 21
new wells (of a total of 70 new wells in the extension scenario) would be drilled. Perenco
notes that, as Mr. Crick explained, for the Oso 19-26 grouping, the average well had a 6-
month payback period and outperformed even the “high case” predicted at the time of
drilling.?°° In fact, Oso 23, the last well that Perenco drilled shortly after Decree 662 was

promulgated, was the best well yet.?”!

Perenco argued that with three years remaining on the Block 7 Contract, in October 2007
it was far from being in a “shut-down mode” and the Consortium was not intending to limit
Block 7 drilling to Oso wells which were expected to pay out the drilling investment by
mid-2007. Following completion of the 8 firm Oso wells in the 2006 Plan of Development
(“POD”), the Consortium would have begun drilling the 8 contingent wells contemplated
by the Plan; those wells would have been re-categorised as “firm” wells. Perenco noted in
this regard that it was common practice in Ecuador to budget only “firm” wells, with the
operator later submitting budget adjustments when the “contingent” wells were moved into

the “firm” category.7°?

Both Mr. Combe and Mr. d’Argentré testified that the September 2007 BCM presentation

showed that Perenco had substantially expanded its estimates of Oso’s oil in place and

planned to move more personnel to Oso and to build a new camp to accommodate them,
and further that the Consortium had constructed the infrastructure backbone for further Oso
development.” Perenco needed time to process the “exciting results” from the firm wells

before choosing additional locations.“ A rig was available to keep drilling.?°°

But for Decree 662, Perenco argued, it would have continued to drill one well per month
in Oso, just as it was doing at the time that Decree 662 came into effect and it would have
continued this drilling programme for as long as it remained profitable to do so.?°° Perenco

asserted that this ought not to be controversial: further Oso wells would undeniably produce

new reserves””” and Perenco indisputably had previously achieved a one-well-per-month

drilling schedule in Oso.7°°

No reasonable operator, amid rising oil prices and excellent results, would decide not to
drill further wells.” As soon as contract renegotiations were underway, Perenco proposed
initially 33, then 70, new Oso drilling locations — hardly a hallmark of disappointment (as
alleged by RPS).?!° Perenco would have continued drilling further wells so long as they
would pay for themselves and make a return prior to contract expiry. Such further drilling

would have been particularly attractive given the high oil price environment, and given the

fact that estimates of the amount of oil in Oso “only grew with each new batch of wells.”?!!

(Perenco noted in this regard that Petroamazonas’ estimates for Oso have continued this

trend, indeed coming in much higher than Perenco’s highest estimate.”!)

The only “uncertainty” was whether Oso was “excellent or merely very good.”?!> While
RPS asserted that the Oso field was not as promising as Mr. Crick asserted on the basis of
four of the 13 Main Hollin wells that were already off production prior to June 2007, Dr.
Strickland explained that in any given field, the number of “bad” wells can be expected to
exceed the number of “good” wells.'* For RPS to imply that Oso was somehow a poor
performer based on the number of wells that had been taken off production was seriously

misleading. The only reason for halting drilling at Oso was Decree 662’s promulgation.”!>

As for the Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields, Mr. Crick also forecasted waterflood
developments.”!© These were noted in Perenco’s 2008 Internal Review and in the
September 2007 BCM.”!’ Dr. Strickland explained that this meant that produced water
would be re-injected into the reservoir. He reviewed the Perenco pilot waterflood results
and found that they showed the required good communication between the wells to
implement a waterflood development. He further confirmed that Mr. Crick’s methodology
was consistent with industry practice and the proposed waterflood projects should be
successful.?!8 (Perenco also contended that this was validated by Ryder Scott, which had

produced a reserves report for Petroamazonas in June 2013.?!°)

The foregoing analysis was reviewed by Dr. Strickland who concluded that Mr. Crick’s

methodology was consistent with that employed by other buyers and sellers of international

Dr. Strickland noted that Mr. Crick had used Petroamazonas’ own production rates and
used decline curve analysis. Dr. Strickland conducted an analysis of wells in Coca-
Payamino, Oso and Lobo and combined Mono and Gacela. In applying the ‘production
performance analysis’/‘decline curve analysis’ methodologies,””! Dr. Strickland found that
the ‘Water to Oil Ratio vs Cumulative’ method did not result in trends that could be
conscientiously extrapolated to make a reliable forecast.”? He instead summed up the
results obtained using the ‘Rate vs Time’ and ‘Rate vs Cumulative’ methodologies to obtain

the Expected Ultimate Recovery (“EUR”) for Block 7.

All the fields except Lobo exhibited good trends under both methodologies. Lobo was the
exception because that field was still being developed with the drilling of additional wells,
such that the decline curve had not yet settled. Dr. Strickland made what he called a

conservative extrapolation for Lobo. He then summed the EURs for the fields calculated

under each technique to determine the cumulative EUR for existing wells in Block 7. He
averaged the EUR calculated and compared it to Mr. Crick’s calculated EUR. Dr.
Strickland found that Mr. Crick’s EUR (118.5 MMStb) was a very close match to Dr.
Strickland’s EUR of 116.6 MMStb (higher only by 2%).? Mr. Crick’s forecasts for the

existing wells were thus in his view valid and reliable.

In response to RPS’s argument that these developments were too uncertain and risky,
during the Quantum Hearing both Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland testified that the proposed
“5-spot” development pattern for the waterfloods would effectively de-risk the

development and account for any minor discontinuities in the reservoirs.?~+
(ii) Ecuador’s Position

In Ecuador’s view, the Quantum Hearing demonstrated that the Consortium did not intend
to extend its drilling campaign at Oso beyond its 8-well commitment (i.e., up to Oso 26).7"5
The only additional drilling that the Consortium was envisaging beyond that was in the
form of “risky” investments intended at the time to satisfy the investment requirement to
be considered for an extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract. The Consortium, in
short, was in a shut-down mode unless and until it was granted an extension.22° RPS’s
conclusion that the Consortium would only have drilled up to 3 wells reflected the strategy
set out in the September 2007 BCM and other contemporaneous documents’, that is, that
there would be no further drilling of the Oso Main Hollin reservoir beyond Oso 26, and the
focus instead would be on “new investment” projects to be undertaken if negotiations for

the extension of the Block 7 Participation Contract succeeded.

233,

In response to Perenco’s maintaining that even in the absence of an extension being granted
it would have drilled 21 new wells at Oso from January 2008 onwards, Ecuador argued
that there was no contemporaneous support for this drilling campaign. The September 2007
BCM made no reference to any drilling beyond Oso 26, even though Mr. d’Argentré
acknowledged at the Quantum Hearing that such meetings were the forum for discussing
further drilling.?> He insisted that “the technical people on the background were
exchanging information and discussing future wells.”??? Yet Perenco failed to provide
proof of such discussions, which only confirmed the lack of evidence in support of its
development programme. It was repeatedly made clear that drilling beyond Oso 26 was

only envisaged in an extension scenario.?*°

Ecuador argued further that Perenco’s reliance upon the proposed construction of a new
camp at Oso as proof of the intention to engage in further drilling was misplaced, because
it was not the “infrastructure backbone for further Oso development”?*!, but rather was

foreseen to rationalise existing production operations in Block 7.?°7

As conceded by Dr. Strickland at the Quantum Hearing, the commercially exploitable
boundaries (or outer edges) to the south, east and north of the Oso field had all been reached
by August 2006.7** By late 2007, it only remained to be determined how far the Main
Hollin reservoir extended to the west following the promising, yet still preliminary, results
from Oso 21. As pointed out by RPS, faced with this uncertainty, Perenco had decided
upon the safer option of infill drilling for the last three Oso wells contemplated on the eve

of Decree 662, rather than investing in further (riskier) wells to probe the western flank of

that field. Perenco was thus in a “shut-down mode” pending an extension being secured for

Block 7.

In fact, on the eve of Decree 662, Block 7 was not the success story that Perenco was now
presenting. First, Perenco misleadingly relied on the Oso mapping update following the
results of Oso 21 to suggest that the Consortium “substantially expanded its estimates of
Oso’s oil in place based on drilling results.”?*+ However, this increase was only reflected
in the maps and was not further mentioned nor quantified during the September 2007
BCM.?* More importantly, if the Consortium was as enthusiastic about Oso at the time as
Perenco contended, the increase of oil in place would have encouraged the Consortium to

schedule further drilling beyond January 2008. But it did not do so.

Second, Perenco disregarded the fact that it was not only a matter of some disappointing
results, but of the location of the disappointing wells in question. RPS referred in this
respect to the “poor results of the first 18 wells drilled in Oso field, particularly the results
of the four failed Main Hollin wells.”?*° These 4 wells, which were probing for the edges”,
indicated limited potential to the north, south, east, and southwest of the Oso field. As a
result, Oso 21 and 23 were drilled in an apparent effort to test the northwest extension of
the reservoir. As explained by RPS, the mixed results that these wells yielded, coupled with
the looming contract expiry in 2010 and the poor quality of the seismic data in the western
flank, would have persuaded the Consortium to limit additional drilling to three infill wells
(Oso 24, 25 and 26), i.e., between Oso 21 and 23, and wells drilled of the main northern
drilling pad (Oso 9). Once Petroamazonas took over operations, it benefited from new

seismic data which allowed it to further step-out drilling to the north and to the west.

Further, the development programme would have required both an amendment to the Oso
Development Plan and further authorisations from the Ecuadorian authorities.” It would
also have required an extensive upgrade to the Block 7 facilities.4° Not only would the
looming contract expiry date not have allowed the Consortium to amortise the US $35
million necessary to undertake this upgrade, but there was also no evidence to show that
the Consortium was even considering such a heavy investment absent an extension of the

Block 7 Participation Contract.”4!

RPS asserted that its forecast for the existing wells was based on a well-by-well analysis
consistent with industry valuation practice.?? The reliability of RPS’ analysis was
confirmed by the fact that its 2P “most likely” forecast is within 10% of actual
production.?“4 Conversely, the forecast for the three new wells was derived from Perenco’s
own AFEs~*° for these wells. Under Case 2746, RPS forecasted 289,200 barrels of 1P™4” and

2P48 oil from the existing wells in Block 7”, a figure undisputed by Perenco.

Ecuador and RPS criticised Mr. Crick’s type-curve forecasting methodology (because he
first determined the initial oil rate for his new wells, before applying to these (and to the

existing) wells a type curve calculated at field level). This could be very imprecise,

differing from reality by as much as 45%, as Mr. Crick himself acknowledged.°°

the justification will include, among other items, production forecasts for the life of the well, sometimes
referred to as the AFE production progno:

Mr. Crick’s production figures were also grossly inflated as compared to the actual
production of the Blocks. Mr. Crick’s forecasting methodology not only failed to accurately
forecast the past, but RPS also demonstrated that the results obtained by applying Mr.
Crick’s decline curve to each of the existing Oso wells from their initial production through
to 31 March 2013 significantly exceeded (i.e. inflated) the actual production of the very
wells for which Mr. Crick claimed to have obtained an excellent match. RPS undertook an
independent check of Crick’s forecasts and provided an apples-to-apples comparison with

actual production, which resulted in an overstatement of reserves of Oso of 21 MMbo.”°!

RPS demonstrated that in order to achieve the claimed “excellent match” between his
forecast and the actual production of the Perenco wells, Mr. Crick had adjusted the data,
thereby discrediting his validation technique.”** For the new wells, Dr. Strickland did not
validate Mr. Crick’s forecast for those wells, which represented some 99 MMbo out of his
total forecast of 122.5 MMbo?*?. RPS also showed that Petroamazonas (unlike Perenco)
had the capacity to handle a significant number of new wells and water production — beyond
that of the 56 wells in Mr. Crick’s analysis — with no operational restriction.*+ Therefore,

contrary to what Perenco alleged,”

the divergence between Mr. Crick’s forecast and
actual production could not be attributed to Petroamazonas’ operational policies, but only

to his flawed methodology.?>°
(iii)Perenco’s response

In response to Ecuador’s and RPS’ arguments, Perenco argued that RPS had wrongly
criticised Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland for employing “aggregate” forecasting methods
derived from group of wells. Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland had explained in detail why

aggregate methods were better suited to the individually unpredictable Block 7 wells than

Despite the earlier criticisms, RPS was forced to admit on cross-examination that Mr.
Crick’s methods in fact produced more accurate results (2%) than RPS’ own results
(8%).7°8 RPS’ only criticism was that Mr. Crick should have begun his forecast not in
August 2009, but rather at the very beginning of each well’s productive life.*? In other
words, the method’s “good match” —its proven reliability in forecasting the future—
should be disregarded because it fails to accurately forecast the past. Yet as RPS readily
agreed, the point of ‘decline-curve analysis’ is “to predict the future.”?°° RPS had itself not
provided a forecast that ran from the start of production of every well; rather, much like
Mr. Crick, RPS has chosen a particular point in history (in RPS’ case, October 2007) as the

start of its forecast and then generated a prediction from that point forward.

RPS did not deny that Dr. Strickland’s independent forecast for the existing Block 7 wells,

which coincided closely with Mr. Crick’s numbers, were reliable and accurate.
(iv) The Tribunal’s decision

In the Tribunal’s view, it is a given that the Consortium’s thinking would have been
dominated by the looming contract expiry. The Tribunal believes that the sharply rising
price of oil leading up to October 2007 would have induced Perenco to seek to drill as
many wells as were economically possible in the Oso field in the time remaining in that
Contract. According to Mr. Crick, in the absence of a contract extension, Perenco would
have stopped drilling in Block 7 in August of 2009 in order to ensure an adequate payback
on the new wells.”°! Mr. Crick estimates that Perenco could have drilled 24 wells per year

in Block 7. The Tribunal agrees and accepts Mr. Crick’s production profiles.

The Tribunal is satisfied that in the ‘but for’ scenario commencing October 2007, to the
extent that it would have engaged in new drilling, Perenco would have concentrated on the
more predictable and technically less challenging Oso field rather than the riskier and more
expensive waterflooding that Mr. Crick proposed for the Lobo and Coca-Payamino fields.
It notes that Mr. Crick himself stated in his second Witness Statement that: “Lobo is one
of the two fields, the other being the Coca-Payamino Unified Field, where, in the event of
an extension to the Block 7 contract, Perenco was prepared to invest in further development
using water injection.””© The Tribunal takes from this statement that drilling in the Coca-
Payamino Unified Field would not have occurred unless a contract extension was granted
and, in any event, the statement accords with the Tribunal’s own sense of the evidence

overall.

Therefore, the Tribunal believes that the drilling that would have occurred in Block 7 ‘but

for’ Decree 662 would more likely have taken place in the Oso field only.

(v) Conclusion on the estimation of how many Block 7 wells

would have been drilled up to August 2009
In the Tribunal’s view, the Consortium would have drilled four wells by January 2008 and
19 wells from February 2008 to August 2009. It has therefore used this number and timing
of wells in its estimate of the damages suffered by Perenco up to the date of the

expropriation.

(c) Block 21 ‘but for’ drilling programme up to caducidad

As noted above, the valuation of this Block is a two-step process. The first step is to value
the future cash flows resulting from Decree 662 as of 4 October 2007 (calculated on the
assumed basis that the Contract would operate until their date of expiry). The second step
requires an estimation of lost future cash flows performed as of 20 July 2010 for Block 21,
20 July 2010 being the date of the declaration of caducidad which took away the remaining

lifespan of the Participation Contract.

As discussed previously, the second estimate is performed on a “clean sheet” basis. That
is, instead of considering Decree 662’s “price-depressing” effect on the value of the assets
through to the date of the Contract’s expiry, to use Perenco’s words, the initial estimated
lost cash flows for Block 21 will be cut off as of the date of the second valuation, and
damages awarded for that period, whereupon a fresh valuation will be performed based on
the conditions prevailing in the market as of the day before the declaration of caducidad
was issued, and a second award of damages will be made for the loss of the Contract’s
remaining life, based upon the market conditions and the operator’s assumed expectations

in the ‘but for’ world of July 2010.

(i) Perenco’s Position

Perenco points out that at the time of Decree 662’s implementation in October 2007, it was
only one-third of the way through its Block 21 operatorship, with nearly 14 years left before
the Contract’s expiry in June 2021. Mr. Crick’s ‘but for’ development programme therefore
addressed this lengthy period of time left in the Contract’s life. Of the 24 wells estimated,
21 would be infill wells drilled in the central, developed part of the Yuralpa field containing

an oil column of at least 90 feet, and the remaining three wells would be located outside of

86

259.

260.

263

this area.2© In Mr. Crick’s opinion, infill wells would have been recommended because of
the water coning mechanism. Perenco noted that Ecuador’s experts, RPS, accepted that
infill drilling would indeed lead to new reserves. Half of RPS’ own proposed wells were

clearly infill.

Perenco pointed that in contrast to Mr. Crick’s approach, RPS, who had previously claimed
in the Burlington case that “additional drilling was not justified in Yuralpa field at all
because the field was fully developed [in 2007]”?, had changed its mind in the present
proceeding and it now proposed a limited six-well programme.”® Perenco noted that even
its minimum investment commitment included in its 2008 negotiations with Ecuador after
Decree 662 was promulgated, which contemplated operations on much less favourable
economic terms than those contained in the Participation Contract, included seven Yuralpa

wells.?°7

Dr. Strickland evaluated Mr. Crick’s forecast as well as RPS’s forecasted performance of
the six new Yuralpa wells that it opined would have been drilled. He concluded that both
programmes were attainable and the question was which was more reasonable. In his
opinion, Mr. Crick’s development plan was more reasonable in terms of the volumes
forecasted and more reflective of what a prudent operator seeking to maximise its

production would do, while RPS failed to explain why a prudent operator would cease

drilling after six successful wells in such a large field.?°

Mr. Crick assumes it will begin in January 2008, instead of July 2008 as proposed in the September 2007
BCM, absent Ecuador’s coercive conduct, earlier in particular given the rise in oil prices at that time. The
difference in date only causes an overall reduction of 2% in Mr. Crick’s numbers. Mr. Crick has provided
revised profiles that use the July 2008 start date for new Yuralpa drilling. This adds a layer of conservatism
to Mr. Crick’s production forecast. Professor Kalt has in turn used Mr. Crick’s revised profiles in his updated
damages calculation.

Dr. Strickland had opined that the critical characteristics of the Main Hollin reservoir

affecting its ability to produce oil were:7

Amount of Oil: There was a large amount of oil in place in the Main Hollin. Since
only a low percentage had been recovered to date, the ultimate recovery was likely
to be even greater than Mr. Crick predicted. In Dr. Strickland’s opinion, if oil prices
were high enough, even more oil could be recovered than that forecasted by Mr.
Crick.

. Geology and Depositional Environment: In the Yuralpa field, the vast majority of

the oil was found in the upper level of the Main Hollin reservoir, which consists of
braided stream channels. The braided stream channels of the Main Hollin had a
porosity of 20-25%, which was considered excellent for oil recovery. The braided
stream channels also had high permeability. Porosity and permeability were two
critical characteristics because they dictate whether oil was capable of moving
through the reservoir to the well bore.

. Water Drive: Yuralpa was a “bottom water drive reservoir.” As oil was produced,

water replenishes the reservoir pores, resulting in a relatively constant pressure of
3,300 psi. The amount of water produced from a well in a water drive reservoir
would increase over time as the invading water reached the well. Typically, the
recovery of oil-in-place in water drive reservoirs was high.

Viscous Oil: The oil in the Main Hollin was relatively heavy and viscous, which
made it easy for the underlying water from the aquifer to break through the oil if
pulled upward towards the low-pressure area around well perforations. This would
lead to the creation of “water cones.”

Presence of Shales: Shales, which are a type of low permeability, non-productive
rock that impede the movement of fluids, were randomly distributed throughout the
Main Hollin. The logs from the Main Hollin confirmed the presence of shales in a
number of well bores in Yuralpa and Oso. However, the location and extent of
shales could not be accurately predicted in the area between wells based on
information from existing wells.

Perenco argued further that RPS wrongly rested its entire development plan for Block 21
on a proposal made at a single Consortium Budget Committee Meeting (BCM) held in
September 2007. It was unreasonable to assume that the Consortium would have proposed
and approved a full development plan for the 14 years remaining on the Block 21 Contract.

Further, RPS’ six proposed wells would produce more than one million barrels each. With

270

am

such productive wells forecasted, it was irrational to assume that the operator would be

content to take no further action in the ensuing years.

The Quantum Hearing testimony made clear that Perenco’s ‘but for’ infill wells in Yuralpa
would produce new reserves. As Dr. Strickland demonstrated in his presentation, RPS’
own model disproved RPS’ longstanding denial of water coning and its contention that
“there are no areas available that would be a good target for infill drilling.”?”° In fact, the
case for infill wells was even better than what RPS’s model had showed: correcting RPS’s
apparent error in its modeling and using the appropriate 40-acre spacing between existing

wells, the simulated infill wells produce even more oil.77!

Hence, Perenco argued that Dr. Gorell’s “puzzling refusal” to call a “conical shape” a
“cone” notwithstanding””, there was no longer any question that infill drilling between the
existing wells’ water cones would be productive. In fact, RPS explicitly “agreed[d] that
you will produce oil [from the infill wells] .”?”? The only remaining debate concerned not
oil production, but the associated water production?”*, with RPS claiming for the first time
in its report filed with the Rejoinder that the water production associated with Mr. Crick’s
wells would substantially exceed the 120,000 barrels of water per day (bwpd) limit imposed
by Mr. Crick.”

Prior to the Quantum Hearing, Perenco had criticised RPS for failing to run the Yuralpa

simulation model, which it used to generate its Yuralpa forecasts, in a reasonable way.””°

Tr. Q. (4) 1042:19-1043:20 (Strickland). The Tribunal observes that Mr. Crick and Dr. Strickland both
proposed 40 acres in the expert reports; however, Dr. Strickland talked about 50 acres during his direct
presentation (working off of RPS’ model) and also reproduced RPS’ 70-acre spacing. He opined that more
oil would be produced from the 70-acre spacing: Tr. Q. (4) 1043:4-8: “If you want 70-acres, then 70-acres
per well is a square that’s 1746 feet per side. Well, that’s a bigger spacing. If you want a bigger spacing,
that’s going to be more oil in place, that’s going to increase recovery, delay the water breakthrough.”

267.

For example, RPS did not assume the behavior of a rational operator who would have
allowed the field’s fluid offtake rate (the amount of fluid produced through operations) to
increase over time.?”” RPS’s own results indicated that even a modest increase in fieldwide
water production significantly increased oil production.?’* RPS nevertheless chose to keep
fluid offtake levels low, with no explanation as to why Perenco would behave so

irrationally.?”

As Mr. Crick explained, in a water-drive reservoir such as the Yuralpa Hollin, where a
powerful aquifer underlies all the oil and could be expected to encroach into the wells,
increasing water-handling capacity was required to maximise the fields’ productivity.”*°
Put simply, to produce greater volumes of oil, the operator must be prepared to produce
and handle ever-greater volumes of water. As RPS was aware, Mr. Crick used a field-wide
limit of 120,000 barrels per day.”*! Yet RPS said nothing about Mr. Crick’s proposed limit
and provided no explanation for its decision to restrain its own forecast with much lower
limits. In fact, Mr. Crick demonstrated that based on the latest data, his initial water
estimate was actually pessimistic and the water production from his proposed new wells

would be entirely manageable.?*?

RPS’ only technical objection (that the water production
associated with Mr. Crick’s wells would substantially exceed the 120,000 barrels of water
per day limit imposed by Mr. Crick) was thus invalid. Hence, RPS’ only technical reason

for opposing Mr. Crick’s Yuralpa development plan is invalid.

Perenco argued further that in contrast to Mr. Crick’s plan, the Quantum Hearing revealed
that RPS’ own water production estimate was premised on a fundamental error: trusting
the full-field Yuralpa model to make an accurate forecast of water production. Dr.

Strickland showed that this is what RPS did. The flaw in that approach was that the model

contained no water-blocking shales beneath the simulated infill wells (it was therefore a
‘worst case’ scenario). Such a model would obviously forecast abundant water production,
when in reality the presence of shales would substantially reduce water production. Dr.
Strickland explained that full field models in a bottom waterdrive reservoir where there are
shales that block water production is not a good forecasting tool.?** Actual data proves that
the model is empirically wrong: it predicts a much higher water-oil ratio (WOR) than has

been actually observed in the field.7**

Perenco also contended that RPS misused a graph displaying Yuralpa’s WOR as a function
of cumulative production. RPS made a water production forecast for both existing and new
wells using a WOR graph that records the behavior of existing Yuralpa wells only.7*° This
made no sense, in that it assumed that the new wells would add no reserves, which is

indisputably false.

Finally, in addition to the vindication of Mr. Crick’s Yuralpa development plan as a
technical matter, the evidence also disproved Ecuador’s contention that the outlook in
Yuralpa was so “bleak” and “disappointing” that Perenco would simply have given up on
the field.*° To the contrary, somewhat lower than expected per-well recoveries compelled
Perenco to drill more wells, even marginally profitable ones, in order to recover this
investment.?*’ The wells were still turning a profit, and as Mr. Caldwell of Brattle
conceded, if Perenco had a reason to drill even marginal wells, there is no economic reason
not to do just that.7*° Hence, the 2007 Yuralpa Study’s six new wells can only be a

minimum, not a maximum —a plan for the next set of work, not the full set of work.?8?

The 2007 Study itself discusses “new infill wells” and lists further analysis to be completed
290

in support of such wells.
Dr. Strickland also reviewed Mr. Crick’s forecasted production volumes, pursuant to his
drilling plan, against a series of tests as well as the actual drilling plans executed by
Petroamazonas. He also considered the critical characteristics of the Main Hollin affecting
its ability to produce oil as set out at paragraph 261 above.”*! Mr. Crick forecasted that the

292

existing wells would recover 52.1 MMStb~* of oil and the new forecasted wells 11.3

MMStb.”

Dr. Strickland noted that the presence of water coning, and the effects of good water-
blocking shales, had been documented in Yuralpa.”** Due to the unpredictability of the
location and extent of shales, it was difficult to extrapolate individual well performance in
the Main Hollin so as to predict reservoir production with reasonable confidence since great
differences existed between wells; however, it was easier to determine what the next group

of wells would likely produce.”

Dr. Strickland also confirmed that additional oil between wells could be recovered by infill
drilling, i.e. placement of new wells, as suggested by Mr. Crick in his development plan

for Yuralpa.”°° Such additional wells would be needed if the operator was to capture the

significant amounts of oil remaining in the Yuralpa field.?°”

Strickland ER I, paragraph 15.

Crick WS II, paragraph 121, noted that that the production from existing wells in Block 21 drilled until
January 2008 was 20.19 million barrels. The additional production from the original Perenco wells between
that date and contract end in June 2021 would be influenced by the new wells, estimated at 31.84 million
barrels, giving a total recovery from the original Perenco wells of 52.03 million (20.19 from 2004 to January
2008 + 31.84 from February 2008 to June 2021).

Dr. Strickland tested Mr. Crick’s forecasts using four types of ‘production performance

 

analysis’ / ‘decline curve analy:

1. Rate vs Time

2. Type Curve

3. Rate vs Cumulative

4, Water to Oil Ratio vs Cumulative?
He found that Mr. Crick’s application of the type-curve analysis was consistent with
industry methods of forecasting future production for fields where individual wells were
not well-behaved (i.e., where the plotted production data for each do not follow a
predictable trend).?°? He confirmed that the data from these wells were not well-behaved
on a well-by-well basis.*°° However, the data was well-behaved on a group or field-wide
prediction basis. Dr. Strickland applied the four techniques to a field-wide analysis of all
wells as of August 2009 and then to each group of wells according to the year that they
were drilled. Comparing Mr. Crick’s calculation to his independently calculated estimates,
Dr. Strickland found that Mr. Crick’s calculations fell within his independent calculations
and therefore he was confident that Mr. Crick reasonably and validly calculated the

reserves and EUR of existing wells in the Yuralpa field.*°!

For the new wells that Mr. Crick forecasted in Block 21, Dr. Strickland applied a different

methodology because historical information did not exist. He found Mr. Crick’s forecasting

302

approach to be consistent with industry practice.*”~ On the basis that wells drilled later in

time would have lower initial rates and per-well EURs, Dr. Strickland plotted the average

Ibid., paragraph 42. Dr. Strickland explained that this technique plots the water-to-oil ratio (“WOR”) on the
y-axis against the cumulative oil production on the x-axis. This type of plot is useful for wells that produce a
great deal of water as compared to oil, as is the case with the wells producing from the Main Hollin. Only
focusing on oil rates may give a pessimistic estimate of reserves in such circumstances. The common
economic cut-off is a WOR of 49, meaning that 49 barrels of water are produced with each barrel of oil. A
WOR of 49 is equivalent to a 98% water cut.

prediction of the average per-well EUR for the next group of wells drilled in Yuralpa.*

Although Mr. Crick’s correlation was acknowledged to be imperfect*”*, Perenco contended
that Mr. Crick’s correlation was a useful and conservative basis for forecasting the new
wells’ production. Decline curve analysis was a reliable forecasting tool where, as here,
there is every reason to believe that Perenco would continue to undertake the necessary
work and investments — just as Petroamazonas has in fact done.*° Although RPS had

argued in its Fifth Report that Mr. Crick used an improper averaging technique in creating

his type curves, Mr. Crick argued that this was not true and RPS made no attempt to revive

this point.2"°

Perenco asserted further that RPS argued for adoption of a 17% decline rate sourced from
Petroamazonas’ Block 21 contract with YPF that RPS had itself explicitly rejected in the
Burlington proceeding. Having conceded that this rate ought never to have been used, RPS
attempted to reach the same steep decline rate by extrapolating the field’s decline over a
period that included the negative impact of Decree 662.*!! On cross-examination, Dr.
Gorell agreed that any extrapolation should be sensitive to the import of historical

events.>!?

Perenco submitted further that Mr. Crick’s forecasts have been verified by other
independent sources, including later estimates from Petroamazonas, Ryder Scott and Dr.
Strickland. RPS on the other hand offered no criticism at all of Dr. Strickland’s Yuralpa
predictions and Ecuador did not cross-examine Dr. Strickland on his forecasting methods

Based on Mr. Crick’s technical work, as reviewed by Dr. Strickland, Professor Kalt then
estimated the value of Block 21 foregone by Perenco as a result of Ecuador’s Treaty and
contractual breaches. He calculated that Perenco’s damages arising from Block 21 suffered
as a result of the breaches amounted to $501.5 million if valued on an ex ante basis*"* and

In Ecuador’s view, the Consortium would have only drilled up to six, not 24, new wells at

Yuralpa.

Ecuador observed that it was not in dispute that the Yuralpa field was Perenco’s first
greenfield project and that its development was strewn with unforeseen challenges and
unexpectedly poor results. As admitted by Mr. Combe, following the sudden and
inexplicable loss of its two best producers in 2004, the field never again met the
Consortium’s 20,000 barrels of oil per day ‘ship-or-pay’ commitment*"®, notwithstanding
investments substantially higher than originally expected.*!’ Subsequent consecutive

drilling campaigns also yielded disappointing results.

Against this backdrop, Perenco halted drilling in February 2007 (months before Decree
662 was promulgated) and, in an attempt to address the significant challenges encountered
at Yuralpa, commissioned a state-of-the-art full-field study. The preliminary results of this
study were presented at the September 2007 BCM. This and a slightly refined and final
version of the Yuralpa Simulation Study issued by Perenco in June 2008 identified two
unswept areas in which the existing wells alone would not have drained the reservoir by
2021. As a result, the September 2007 BCM presentation set out a preliminary programme
of between six and eight new wells in the main and south-eastern fringe areas of the field,
to be drilled starting in July 2008. This was later reduced to between five and seven wells

in the subsequent Simulation Study, in order to effectively sweep the reservoir.*'®

Accordingly, RPS concluded that six new wells would have been drilled at Yuralpa from
July 2008 onwards but for Decree 662: two in the main area of the field, three in the south-
eastern fringe and one re-drill towards the south.*'? Ecuador rejected the contention that

RPS had shifted positions between the Burlington and Perenco arbitrations; the two

tribunals had made different findings and hence different perspectives needed to be adopted

2
as a result.*?°

Perenco’s purported 24-well drilling programme, which would have commenced in July
2008, was at odds with Perenco’s September 2007 BCM presentation and the Yuralpa
Simulation Study issued in June 2008, which contemplated drilling between five and (no
more than) seven horizontal wells so as to effectively sweep the two areas which would

have been otherwise left undrained by 2021.

Neither the Yuralpa Simulation Study nor any contemporaneous document implied, let
alone demonstrated, that there was any significant issue with respect to how Perenco’s
Geoscience department carried out the Study or constructed its state-of-the-art model. Nor
were the conclusions and recommendations criticised or in any way impugned prior to Mr.
Crick’s testimony. The Study simply did not envisage the need for, or indeed identify the
benefit of, proceeding with an extensive infill drilling campaign in the main area of the
Yuralpa field and instead focused on further development of the fringe area, where the oil

column thickness was inferior to 90 feet?!

Yet, Mr. Crick’s evidence was that the Consortium would have set aside the conclusions
and recommendations from this in-depth study and instead embark upon a spur-of-the-
moment 24 vertical well campaign, commencing with 21 infill wells in the main area of

the field. Mr. Crick’s justification was because he wanted to do vertical wells.*””

Mr. Crick’s extensive infill drilling programme was premised on the assumption that water
coning was a pervasive occurrence at Yuralpa.*”* In Ecuador’s view, this was not supported
by any document on the record and infill drilling was inconsistent with the

recommendations of the Yuralpa Study. RPS demonstrated that, consistent with the Kerr

reservoir. As shown in RPS’s 4-well sample simulations, each well drilled gave rise to
extensive lateral water movement, which extended outward with time and, by interacting
with the water movement caused by neighbouring wells, eliminated any “infill” drilling

targets.

Neither Mr. Crick nor Dr. Strickland levied any material criticism against RPS’ simulation
runs or their ultimate conclusion. Dr. Strickland did not outright reject the notion of
extensive lateral water movement. Instead, he sought to downplay its impact by purporting
to show that even in RPS’ 4-well water encroachment model, enough oil remained trapped

between wells so as to warrant drilling the fifth “infill” well. This failed for two reasons:

1. Dr. Strickland focused on representations of the 4-well sample at 12, 19 and 25
months into production. However, this overlooked the fact that the actual Yuralpa
wells were much older than that. On average, the wells drilled in this area would
have been producing between 33 months and 57 months between the
commencement and end of Mr. Crick’s drilling campaign. These wells would have
caused far more extensive water encroachment and left far less recoverable oil
between them.

2. The recovery of any such incremental oil, would be accompanied by the production
of large amounts of water.*> The aggregate water production of 24 such wells
would very rapidly surpass the handling capacity of 45,000 bwpd of the field in
2008, thus requiring substantial investment towards an upgrade. Dr. Strickland did
not seek to quantify the associated water production.*°

Mr. Crick’s development plan and his own run of the Yuralpa model would yield far more
water than his assumed upgraded handling capacity of 120,000 bwpd. In particular,
according to Mr. Crick’s development plan, the water production was expected to increase
steadily up to 180,000 bwpd in 2021. As a remedy to such increase, Mr. Crick provided for
three water shutoff workovers (WSOs) to be carried out per year, starting in 2015.
However, as shown by RPS, such WSOs could not achieve the massive reduction in water
production that they were credited with.*?’ In addition, Mr. Crick’s own run of the Yuralpa

model also yielded water production figures far higher than his stated 120,000 bwpd, which

292.

he then sought to cap through over 100 automatic WSOs. As demonstrated by RPS and

conceded by Mr. Crick, however, such operations were unrealistic and costly.

RPS also took issue with Mr. Crick’s observation that the simulator over-predicted water
production. This was true so long as the field operations remained unchanged, but it was
not a valid assumption to make if 24 new wells were put into production in the reservoir
and the way in which the wells were operated was significantly changed. This meant that
a reasonable proportional cutback of liquid production would inevitably require a
significant reduction in the total amount of oil produced, something which was ignored by
Mr. Crick.>? Moreover, in response to Perenco’s argument that since “the model contains
no water-blocking shales beneath the simulated infill wells” RPS was using a “worst-case

1329

scenario” forecasting tool*”®, it is not possible to accurately predict the location of shales.**°

This meant that Mr. Crick’s 24 new wells were just as likely not to encounter shales as they
were drilled. Even if the shales could be accounted for prior to any drilling, it was not true
that they would have an effect on cumulative water production. Ecuador asserted that such

1

shales would, at best, laterally deviate the otherwise vertical course of water,??! which

would increase the amount of mobile water in the field and consequently the amount of

water produced by another well.***

RPS further asserted that in addition to not imposing a field wide limit on the total water
production, Mr. Crick also changed how the simulation controls the wells by
simultaneously changing well minimum production rates and workover procedures, “all in

manners which tend to increase oil production.”**? RPS found these to be “outrageously

optimistic.”**4

Ecuador also criticised Mr. Crick’s type-curve forecasting methodology** asserting that it
can be very imprecise, differing from reality by as much as 45%, as acknowledged by Mr.
Crick.**° The initial rate of the wells was incorrectly determined; Mr. Crick purported to
derive this rate from an alleged correction between the actual initial rates of 27 Perenco
wells and 11 wells drilled by Petroamazonas, but Mr. Crick conceded at the Quantum
Hearing that this was not a reliable correction*””: its 0.25 coefficient was far below the 0.6
required to find a valid statistical correlation. Moreover, the well data Mr. Crick relied on
to derive this “non-correlation” was selected in an inconsistent manner because he had
chosen to exclude eight wells out of a total of 35 (23% of the available data) on the ground
that he considered them to be “outliers.”*** As RPS pointed out, it is statistically unsound

to exclude 23% of the data.**

Mr. Crick’s attempt to validate his method by reference to “the initial rate from the
Petroamazonas wells to predict the performance of the Petroamazonas wells” is plainly

unavailing, as it is achieved through a circular (and thus technically incorrect) process.

Despite it being “readily acknowledged” to be flawed™°, Perenco sought to re-characterise
Mr. Crick’s initial rate correlation as a useful and conservative basis for forecasting but

Ecuador argued that this relied on statements that Mr. Crick did not actually make at the

Quantum Hearing.*4!

RPS estimated that the aggregate oil production from Block 21 would have totaled 29.64
MMbo through to contract expiry. Such production would have been derived from both the
existing wells (22.83 MMbo) and from the six new wells the Consortium would have
drilled but for Decree 662 (6.81 MMbo).**? RPS’ forecast was derived from the Yuralpa
simulation model which represented the culmination of a major phase of geomodelling and
simulation work carried out by Perenco’s own geoscience department. This model was
undoubtedly the best and most up-to-date prediction tool available to the Consortium from
late 2007 onwards and is therefore, the most appropriate means of forecasting oil

production in Block 21.7

(iii) The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal notes that for Block 21, Mr. Crick’s plan was that all 24 of his Yuralpa field
wells would be drilled in the period commencing January 2008 through to the end of 2009
(assuming two rigs operating, each one taking a month to drill a well*+) and he projected
no additional drilling from the end of 2009 through to contract expiry in 2021, a period of
some 11 years. In his third witness statement, he adjusted his commencement date to July
2008.*4° However, he still contemplated all 24 wells being drilled before the declaration of

caducidad and none being drilled thereafter.
His ‘but for’ drilling programme was thus ‘front-end loaded’.

The Tribunal has taken note of documentary and oral evidence which showed that:

RPS ER IV, paragraph 150, Table 14.

While Perenco sought to depict RPS’ reliance on the 2010 updated version of this model as being inconsistent
with its ex ante approach, the fact remains that RPS was not provided the June 2008 version of the model.
The implications of RPS’ use of the 2010 update would, in any event, appear to be inconsequential in light
of Crick’s own testimony that what happened in 2010 was a typical minor adjustment to the model and not a
full update incorporating all of the knowledge available at the time. See Crick WS III, paragraphs 53-54.
Crick WS II, paragraph 256. Perenco employed such a programme starting in December 2004, where it drilled
28 wells until it halted drilling in order to conduct a field study. RPS ER V, paragraph 143.

qd) Block 21 consistently performed below expectations after its first three months of
production in 2004.*#°

(2) This led to Perenco’s decision to halt drilling in February 2007, some seven months
before Decree 662 came into effect.*4”

(3) Burlington’s parent, ConocoPhillips, produced a Latin America Reserves Review in
May 2007 which noted that drilling in Yuralpa had been “currently halted to conduct
field study (water production key issue)” and further that “disappointing well results
in latter part of 2006 reduced development [drilling] opportunities - Field study
currently underway.”*48

(4) The ConocoPhillips Information Memorandum (also of May 2007) stated that
“*..due to earlier than expected water breakthrough in the latest wells, further drilling
has been put on hold pending the completion of a reservoir and completion practices
study.”3

(5) Based on the preliminary study being performed by Perenco, ConocoPhillips at this
point anticipated nine wells as “potential targets” (four infill and five offset (i.e.,
flank) locations, but by the September 2007 Budget Committee Meeting (BCM), the
number was reduced to five to seven with fewer interior wells.*°°

(6) Perenco informed the BCM of 26-27 September 2007 that there would be “no
investment [in Block 21]... for first half of 2008.”>*'

(7) Perenco’s “preliminary programme” in September 2007 was that five to seven wells
be drilled.

(8) The final report on the field study was distributed only in June 2008, eight months
after Decree 662 came into effect.*

(9) It is conceded by RPS that the field study identified two unswept areas in Block 21
where oil which would not have been drained by the existing wells.**

102

303.

The real questions for the Tribunal are: (i) given the Yuralpa field’s history, at what pace
would drilling have occurred in the ‘but for’ world; and (ii) what would be the financial

impact of the water handling required to exploit the wells in Yuralpa.
RPS noted the following points about the Perenco simulation study:

“Base case reserves were 20.3 MMstb. They were calculated using the
wells that existed as of October 2007, and using the fluid production rates
at that time.

Water handling capacity was 45,000 barrels per day.

Perenco evaluated the potential to increase reserves to 25.7 MMstb by
maintaining the current drawdown in the existing wells. This would
necessitate increase in water handling to 60,000 barrels per day.

L.]
Perenco evaluated drilling between five and seven wells, which could

increase reserves to 32.0 MMstb with the current liquid production rates
in existing wells. [...]”>**

 

Based on the evidence before it, the Tribunal considers that in the ‘but for’ period following
4 October 2007, the Consortium would have been, on the one hand, incentivised to drill by
the rising oil prices experienced in the period leading up to October 2007. On the other
hand, the Consortium would have been more conservative than Mr. Crick in committing to
an ambitious drilling programme, given the hitherto disappointing performance of Block
21. That said, the general view must be that in the ‘but for’ world, particularly with a
relatively long period of time remaining on the Contract and strong oil prices at the time,
the Consortium would have drilled all wells that were technically and economically

feasible.

In the circumstances, and given Mr. Crick’s adjustment in timing, the Tribunal therefore

considers that this programme would have commenced no earlier than July 2008.7°°

the robustness of the Perenco simulation team’s findings regarding the two potentially unswept areas of the
Main Hollin reservoir in Yuralpa and its recommendation to drill 5 to 7 wells to exploit the opportunity to
recover the volumes therein.” [footnotes omitted.]

RPS ER V, paragraph 151.

Mr. Crick initially used a January 2008 start date but later adjusted it to July 2008 which reduced his predicted
oil volumes by 2%. See Crick WS III, paragraph 3.

103

304.

305.

306.

307.

Therefore, when estimating the Yuralpa field’s value for the purposes of calculating the
effect of Decree 662, there would be no increase in the number of Block 21 wells until mid-
2008. As for what would happen thereafter, the Tribunal considers that it would be
appropriate to assume that Perenco would have drilled six wells between Decree 662 and

the declaration of caducidad.

The Tribunal considers that the starting point for the analysis is a model based on the
drilling programme as contemplated in 2008 (six wells) in the period leading up to

caducidad and to adjust for an increased number of wells.

The impact of caducidad’s termination of the balance of Perenco’s contractual rights

The declaration of caducidad terminated the Participation Contracts. This was done only
one month before the Block 7 Participation Contract expired. As already noted, the
Tribunal has declined to assume a particular contractual model that might have governed
the Parties’ relationship in relation to Block 7 and has chosen instead to treat this as a

compensable loss of opportunity, addressed below.

The Tribunal therefore begins by considering the situation in Block 21, which Perenco
would have operated for some approximately 11 years had caducidad not been declared.

This raises Mr. Crick’s ‘but for’ drilling plan for the Yuralpa field.

With respect to the 11 remaining years on the Contract and prices prevailing in the period
leading up to July 2010, had caducidad not been declared, given that there is exploitable
oil in Block 21, the Tribunal considers that Perenco would have conducted further drilling,
particularly when it is assumed as the Tribunal has decided to assume that as of October
2008, the Participation Contracts would be stabilised at 33%. In the end, the Tribunal has
decided to employ a mid-range number of wells from Mr. Crick’s scenario. In the
Tribunal’s view, having regard to industry practices and in particular the desirability of
maximising Perenco’s returns in Block 21 over a still lengthy period of time as well as the
value of accelerating drilling in order to capture as much production as possible, but
mindful of the Block’s history of watering issues, Perenco would have drilled additional

wells after expropriation.

104

308.

309.

310.

Having arrived at this conclusion, the Tribunal is aware of the fact that the Burlington
tribunal took a different view, namely, that having regard to the situation as of September
2007 before the enactment of Decree 662 only six wells were scheduled to be drilled. This
was the number of wells that that tribunal found it was reasonable to assume would it be
drilled in the circumstances. The present Tribunal cannot agree with Burlington’s heavy
reliance on the September 2007 BCM Presentation and accepts Perenco’s argument that
“budget committee presentations are not development plans and that Perenco had not
intended, in the course of a single budget meeting in 2007, to lay out its plans for the 14
years remaining on the Block 21 Contract.” The Tribunal believes that given the 14 year
time horizon, the Consortium would have been likely to drill more wells so long as it

considered that there was commercially exploitable oil.*°”

Knowing that Petroamazonas has to some extent validated Mr. Crick’s modeling of the
Blocks’ productive capacity is of some comfort to the Tribunal that it has arrived at a fair
and reasonable valuation, but at the end of the day the Tribunal’s approach is to: (i) use
market conditions prevailing at the time of the taking; (ii) take the common sense
commercial view that with 11 years remaining on Block 21’s life, Perenco more likely than
not would have sought to maximise its efforts to extract as much value from the Block as
was reasonably attainable; (iii) Perenco’s drilling programme would have been conducted
somewhat more conservatively than Mr. Crick’s plan, but still would have sought to
overcome the Yuralpa field’s technical challenges; and (iv) as Perenco gained more
knowledge and experience with the field, it would have put that knowledge and experience

to commercial benefit in its drilling decisions.

The Tribunal considers that ‘but for’ the declaration of caducidad, Perenco would have
drilled ten wells (in addition to the six wells drilled before caducidad) between 2010 and

2020.

See Perenco’s 18 April 2017 comments on the Burlington award, p. 4.

105

311.

312.

313.

314.

Having considered the record evidence and the arguments of the Parties, the Tribunal
further concludes that the water production levels associated with a 16-well drilling

programme would be 120,000 bwpd.***

Valuation of Perenco’s loss of opportunity to operate Block 7

The Tribunal turns to the valuation of the loss of opportunity to negotiate an agreement to
continue to operate Block 7 until August 2018. As discussed above, this exercise differs
from valuing the loss of profits expected under an executed contract and the question is

how to value this opportunity.

1. Perenco’s Position

Perenco submitted (in the alternative to its asserted claim of US$626 million based on the
AGIP contract, which the Tribunal has already rejected), Ecuador must pay damages for
the value of Perenco’s lost opportunity to obtain and benefit from a contract extension.
Tribunals are willing to apply the loss of chance doctrine even when the probability is low.
Here, Perenco established that an extension would very likely have been granted and at the
very least should be compensated for its loss of chance to operate in Block 7 until 2018.
Perenco’s case was unlike that of the claimants in the Gemplus case, where the claimants
based their extension claim solely on the ground that the concession gave rise to a
legitimate expectation that significant additional revenue could be expected from the
second 10-year period.*°? Perenco had established a strong factual basis for the extension

and this was not a claim for speculative and uncertain damages.

2. Ecuador’s Position

In contrast, Ecuador relied on the Gemplus award, where that tribunal looked at the
language of a similarly drafted clause and concluded that, while the exercise of the State’s

discretion was not unfettered under municipal law, the claimant’s claim for the second

316.

period of ten years was far too contingent, uncertain and unproven, lacking any sufficient
factual basis for the assessment of compensation under the two applicable BITs. At the
relevant date, the concessionaire had no legal right to any extension.* Likewise, while
Ecuador’s discretion was not unfettered under Ecuadorian law, Perenco’s claim for an
eight-year extension was far too contingent, uncertain and unproven, lacking any sufficient
factual basis for the assessment of compensation under the Treaty. At the date of

caducidad, Perenco had no legal right to an extension.**!

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Parties have argued over the relevance of the Gemplus award, where the concession
contract at issue contained a clause that contemplated an extension of the initial 10-year
term. The main reason why that tribunal refused the loss of opportunity claim based on the
possible renewal of the contract stemmed from the fact that the circumstances which
initially threw the motor vehicle registry project into disarray and forced the authorities to
intervene to administer the concessionaire occurred at the very outset of the Concession’s
life.*°? This caused an understandable decline in public confidence in the registry

initiative.*°* Hence, the tribunal had little difficulty rejecting that part of the claim.

However, although it was facing dramatically different factual circumstances than the

present case, and it was then attempting to value a loss resulting from extant contractual

Gemplus v. Mexico., Award, paragraph 12-49.

Resp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 15.

The events in question centered on the arrest of the concessionaire’s general manager, Ricardo Cavallo, for
his alleged role in the Argentinian “dirty war”, his detention in Mexico and subsequent extradition to Spain
at the request of a Spanish investigating judge, and his further extradition to Argentina to face war crimes
charges in that country. Mr. Cavallo’s arrest was quickly followed by the death in murky circumstances of
the senior government official, Dr. Ratil Ramos, responsible for the motor vehicle registry project.
Gemplus v. Mexico, Award, paragraphs 13-96: “As found by the Tribunal, [by the time of termination] the
project was by then already severely damaged from earlier events for which the Respondent bears no liability
under the BITs; and it remained subject to several commercial, legal and political risks. Moreover, it was the
Respondent's own efforts in September 2000 that kept the project even half alive (as regards new vehicles)
and not des d by the twin s of 2000, namely the Cavallo incident
and the death of Dr. Ramos. But for Dr. Blanco’s efforts at the time (at the Secretariat), the Concessionaire
would have failed in or soon after September 2000. Moreover this half-life project, by 24 June 2001, was far
from the project originally envisaged with its business dependent on the registration of both new and used
vehicles.”

tights, the Gemplus tribunal highlighted two points on ‘loss of opportunity’ that resonate
with the present Tribunal. First, there was “no certainty or realistic expectation of this
project’s profitability as originally envisaged, but there was nonetheless a reasonable
opportunity” and that “opportunity, however small, has a monetary value” at international
law. Second, “it would be wrong in principle to deprive or diminish the Claimants of the
monetary value of that lost opportunity on lack of evidential grounds when that lack of

evidence is directly attributable to the Respondent’s own wrongs.”**

This is in line with the present Tribunal’s view. The facts are that: (i) Block 7 was a proven
field with valuable oil reserves; (ii) there is no question that even with a changed
contractual model, Perenco wanted to stay in Ecuador and continue to operate the block;
and (iii) there is considerable evidence that the State itself would have preferred Perenco
to stay in Ecuador. The Tribunal believes that ‘but for’ the breaches, the parties more likely
than not would have arrived at a solution whereby Perenco would be operating Block 7
under a different contractual regime. But the Tribunal has also found that it cannot engage
in the kind of speculation about a specific contractual model which would then be married

with Mr. Crick’s projections in order to arrive at an amount of damages.

Perenco referred the Tribunal to Ripinsky and Williams’ Damages in International

Investment Law, where the authors observed:

“Loss of chance can thus be used as a tool allowing the injured party to
receive some form of compensation for the loss of chance to make profit.
In theory, the loss of chance is assessed by reference to the degree of
probability of the chance turning out in the plaintiff's favour, although in
practice the amount awarded on this account is often discretionary.”*°°

The authors continue:

“Tn some other cases, arbitral tribunals have determined the amount of lost
profits in a discretionary manner. Where this lack of numerical support

322.

was due to the fact that a tribunal could not estimate the loss of profits with
satisfactory precision, such awards may be classified as compensation for
the loss of business opportunity. Amounts awarded under this head of
damage are likely to be conservative and reflect a tribunal’s view of an
equitable, reasonable and balanced outcome rather than being a result of a
mathematical calculation.”*”

The Tribunal observes that the claim here is not to be equated to a lost profits claim based
upon a final, executed contract. There is an element of uncertainty that must be taken into

consideration.

In arriving at its decision, the Tribunal has considered the ILC Articles, particularly Article
36 thereof, and the commentaries (specifically (27) and (32) thereto. Article 36 provides
that:

“1. The State responsible for an internationally wrongful act is under an
obligation to compensate for the damage caused thereby, insofar as such
damage is not made good by restitution.

2. The compensation shall cover any financially assessable damage
including loss of profits insofar as it is established.”

The key point is that financial damage must not only be proximately caused by the unlawful
act(s), but that it also be “assessable”, that is, capable of being assessed. The Tribunal has
already observed that it is also alive to the cases’ and commentaries’ reminder that
international courts, tribunals and claims commissions seek to avoid granting “inherently
speculative” claims or to put it the other way, seek to determine whether there are

“sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of sufficient certainty to

be compensable.”*

Ibid., p. 293.

ILC Articles.

Ibid., Commentary (27) to Article 34. Particularly the concern expressed about the need to ensure that there
is “financially assessable” damage: “Tribunals have been reluctant to provide compensation for claims with
inherently speculative elements. When compared with tangible assets, profits (and intangible assets which
are income-based) are relatively vulnerable to commercial and political risks, and increasingly so the further
into the future projections are made. In cases where lost future profits have been awarded, it has been where
an anticipated income stream has attained sufficient attributes to be considered a legally protected interest of
sufficient certainty to be compensable. This has normally been achieved by virtue of contractual arrangements
or, in some cases, a well-established history of dealings.”

326.

The circumstances of the present case are unusual. The parties arrived at an ‘in principle’
negotiated change to their contractual relationship which contemplated the extension of
Block 7’s term. However, it was Ecuador, and not Perenco, which, due to Burlington’s
recalcitrance, balked at its implementation. The Tribunal found this refusal was a breach
of the Treaty by Ecuador which deprived Perenco of the chance to reach an agreement on
extension.*”° Therefore, the Tribunal considers that Perenco is entitled to compensation for

the loss of that opportunity.

The Tribunal frankly acknowledges that any estimation of the value of the loss of
opportunity is an exercise of discretion and therefore it has decided to award a nominal
value. In this regard, the Tribunal recalls a comment made by the Murphy v. Ecuador
tribunal with which the Tribunal agrees:

“\..The applicable international law standard of full reparation, as

reflected in the Chorzéw Factory judgment and Article 31 of the ILC

Articles on State Responsibility, does not determine the valuation

methodology. Nor does the Treaty. Tribunals enjoy a large margin of

appreciation in order to determine how an amount of money may “as far

as possible, wipe out all the consequences of the illegal act and re-establish

the situation which would, in all probability, have existed if that act had
not been committed.”*7!

Because it is a loss of opportunity to have the contract extended rather than the loss of a
fully crystallised legal right to an extension of a contract, the expected cash flows of which
could be modelled on a DCF basis, such value must necessarily be significantly lower than
the amount claimed by Perenco based on the AGIP contract model applied by Mr. Crick’s
drilling forecasts for Block 7 through to 2018.

In all of the circumstances, the Tribunal holds that an award of US$25 million is
appropriate. It cannot but note that the equities tend strongly in favour of the granting of

this relief. This however is not a decision ex aequo et bono. It is one grounded in law.

Ecuador’s defences on liability and on quantum advanced various arguments to the effect
that Perenco was either the author of its own misfortune or otherwise has contributed to the
harm in respect of which it now seeks damages. This was prominent in Ecuador’s argument
during the liability phase that Perenco and Burlington pursued a so-called “self-
expropriation” strategy in refusing to comply with Law 42 by paying sums into an offshore
account, and calculating that they would be better off keeping that money and not operating
the Blocks.” In the damages phase, Ecuador argued similarly that Perenco contributed to
the coactiva dispute by refusing to pay Law 42 dues, by threatening suit against persons
who purchased the oil at auction, and by suspending operations, knowing that this would

force the State to intervene and ultimately could be a ground for caducidad.*”*

1. Ecuador’s Position

Ecuador thus argued that if Perenco was entitled to any damages at all, they ought to be
reduced on grounds of contributory negligence. It argued that international law is clear that
simple negligence (demonstrating a lack of due care for one’s own property or rights*”*)

that concurrently contributes to a loss is sufficient to establish contributory negligence.*”°

In its view, Perenco’s refusal to pay the amounts due under Law 42 was inherently
negligent because it compelled Ecuador to react. Ecuador argued that its own alleged
breaches of international law were irrelevant to Perenco’s contributory negligence because
the doctrine of contributory negligence exists in order to reduce the damages from a
respondent’s breach on account of the claimant’s own negligent contribution to the loss it
has suffered. Ecuador submitted that if Perenco’s excuse for what Ecuador termed “tax
evasion”>’® (that is, Ecuador’s response was contrary to its international rights) were to be
accepted, the doctrine of contributory negligence would have no possible application.

Ecuador relied in this regard on the awards in Goetz, Occidental and Yukos where tribunals

found the claimants were contributorily negligent for instigating the State’s breach and

therefore the damages to be awarded were adjusted downward.*””

In addition, Ecuador contended, Perenco was negligent, or even reckless, in suspending
ongoing operations in the Blocks and consciously ignoring the risks of environmental harm
and production losses. By suspending operations on short notice,*’* Perenco acted in
reckless disregard even in relation to its own rights, even though it foresaw that Ecuador
would be forced to respond. Even if Perenco were permitted in principle to suspend
operations, Perenco could not do so regardless of the risks. Mr. Perrodo repeatedly
conceded that he decided to suspend operations despite his full awareness of the risks.
Specifically, Mr. Perrodo admitted that he was aware that suspending operations involved
serious risks, including production losses in Blocks 7 and 21 and environmental damage to
the Ecuadorian Amazon.*” He recognised that these risks would force Ecuador to respond
and might result in caducidad.**° He admitted that, consciously disregarding these serious

risks, he decided to suspend operations in Block 7 and 21.°*!

Ecuador argued further that Perenco’s conduct during the Parties’ negotiations was

negligent and led to the breakdown of negotiations. It had rejected Ecuador’s proposals,

be reduced if the claiming party also committed a fault which contributed’ to its loss, and held that in that
case the investor ‘acted negligently and committed an unlawful act’ in failing to obtain prior ministerial
authorization to transfer rights under its participation contract. [...] In Yukos, the tribunal found that, unlike
other Russian companies, Yukos ‘breached the legislation and abused the low tax regimes...through the

making the negotiation process even more difficult. Contrary to what Perenco alleges, the
Tribunal never found that Perenco was justified in terminating the negotiations based on

”382 Perenco’s failure to “make its best efforts” to finalize

“Ecuador’s unlawful coercion.
the renegotiation of the Participation Contracts pursuant to the Actas de Acuerdo Parcial
of October 2008, after having signed three partial agreements throughout 2008, amounted
to an “unjustified” termination of the negotiation which gave rise to culpa in

contrahendo.**

Ecuador further argued that Perenco could not rely on the argument that Ecuador’s
unlawful conduct was the proximate cause of caducidad. A single event might have
multiple proximate causes. The doctrine of contributory negligence depends on this
possibility. Contributory negligence reduces compensation exactly when the respondent
and the claimant both contribute to or proximately cause the claimant’s loss. Article 39 of
the Articles on State Responsibility deals with this situation.*** Ecuador’s alleged
proximate causation does not change the fact that Perenco’s refusal to pay its Law 42 taxes

and its decision to abandon the oil fields directly contributed to caducidad.**°

Finally, if Perenco referred to coactivas and the oil auction as the proximate cause of
caducidad, Perenco’s reckless decision to suspend operations in the Blocks were a more

direct cause of caducidad than the coactivas and the oil auction.

2. Perenco’s Position

Perenco responded that Ecuador bears the burden of proving two elements of its
contributory fault theory. First, Ecuador must show that Perenco committed a wrongful act,

whether intentional or negligent; bad business decisions that might have increased the

investor’s risks do not rise to the level of culpable fault capable of supporting a finding of

contributory fault.>%”

Perenco’s refusal to pay the Law 42 amounts cannot be characterised as negligent because
the Tribunal has already rejected Ecuador’s claim that Perenco had no legal basis to
withhold Law 42 payments. The Tribunal has acknowledged that Perenco was justified in
withholding direct payment of Law 42 dues after commencement of the arbitration.**
Perenco legitimately expected that Ecuador would comply with the Tribunal’s binding
orders and that this relieved Perenco from making those direct payments. Its refusal thus
could not be characterised as a culpable act that manifested a disregard for Ecuador’s rights

and for which Perenco should be penalised.

Moreover, given the position taken by two Ecuadorian Attorney-Generals that Law 42 was
not a tax law and that the dues collected pursuant to it were not collected by Ecuadorian
tax authorities, it was not reasonable and realistic to suggest that Perenco should have paid
Law 42 dues to Petroecuador and then petitioned Ecuador’s tax authorities in order to

contest them.*°°

In relation to Perenco’s suspension of operations following Ecuador’s disregard of the
Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures and issuance of coactivas, the Tribunal had
found that Perenco’s suspension of operations was justified under the exceptio non
adimpleti contractus principle. The defence was open to Perenco and that therefore Perenco
could lawfully suspend operations when faced with a breach of contract without itself being
found to be in breach.*” And, as Mr. Perrodo had testified, there had been no interruptions

in operations and the company had taken the decision to suspend only as a last resort.

Regarding Perenco’s alleged failure to obtain Burlington’s agreement to abandon the

Participation Contracts and agree to an unspecified future contractual form, the Tribunal

had found that Perenco was not liable for Burlington’s decision not to abandon its
contractual rights, that Burlington had good reasons for doing so, that Ecuador acted
abruptly and coercively during the negotiations, and that Ecuador — not Perenco — was
responsible for the failure of negotiations.**! In any event, Ecuadorian law recognises that
liability for breaking off contractual negotiations (culpa in contrahendo) does not arise
unless there are exceptional circumstances. There can be no liability if there was a
legitimate basis to end negotiations. Even if Perenco had terminated negotiations (which,
as the Tribunal found, was not the case), Ecuador’s unlawful coercion of Perenco would

have been a more than sufficient justification.*°

Perenco argued further that Ecuador could not show the second element of contributory
fault, namely, that this fault interrupted the chain of causation. Contributory fault requires
conduct by the investor that breaks the causal nexus such that the injury can be considered
severable.*”? Perenco pointed out that Ecuador’s own authorities recognised that wrongful
conduct by the investor that is a concurrent cause for the loss does not exonerate the State
from liability altogether. Ecuador must prove that Perenco would have suffered the loss

even if Ecuador had not committed its unlawful acts.7°4

The Tribunal has already confirmed that Ecuador’s unlawful conduct was the proximate
cause of caducidad. This was not addressed by Ecuador at the Quantum Hearing.*”
Ecuador could not establish that any of the above was the proximate cause of Ecuador’s
declaration of caducidad. It was Ecuador’s choice in exercising its discretion that directly

triggered caducidad.*”*

Further, Perenco had made it clear it would resume operations if Ecuador complied with
the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures.*”” If that had occurred, the Consortium
would have continued to operate the Blocks, and Ecuador would not have declared
caducidad. The proximate cause was therefore Ecuador’s failure to comply with the

provisional measures, not Perenco’s later suspension of operations.*°*

Ecuador also did not declare caducidad due to Burlington’s attitude but because of a
suspension that was caused by Ecuador’s failure to comply with the Decision on

Provisional Measures.

Finally, Perenco pointed out that Ecuador did not deny that its contributory fault defence
was limited to caducidad in any event. Even if it had any legal or factual basis, it could not
affect damages for Ecuador’s violations of Article 4 of the Treaty or for its breach of the

Contracts through Decree 662.°”

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

The Tribunal recalls that Article 39 of the ILC Articles, entitled “Contribution to the
injury’, states that in the determination of reparation, “account shall be taken of the
contribution to the injury by wilful or negligent action or omission of the injured State or
any person or entity in relation to whom reparation it sought.”*#°° While the inclusion of the
word “wilful” broadens the scope of the article beyond negligence, such broadening does
not, in the Tribunal’s view, appear to be substantial. The ILC Commentaries noted in this
regard that the focus “is on situations which in national law systems are referred to as
‘contributory negligence’, ‘comparative fault’, ‘faute de la victime’, etc.*°'! Commentary
(5) to the article notes further that it allows to be taken into account “only those actions or

omissions which can be considered as wilful or negligent, i.e. which manifests a lack of

due care on the part of the victim of the breach for his or her own property or rights.”4°

The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the basis that in order for Ecuador’s submissions to
succeed, the Tribunal must be satisfied that Perenco manifested a lack of due care for its

own property or rights.

Ecuador has identified a number of instances where it considers Perenco contributed to the

damages which it has suffered.

Putting them in rough chronological order, the first is the contention that Perenco’s overall
conduct during the negotiation process contributed to its loss in that on several occasions,
Perenco rejected Ecuador’s proposals, thus making the negotiation process more difficult,
refused to discuss drafts of transfer agreements that Ecuador proposed on 16 May 2008 and
10 July 2008, did not make its best efforts to finalise the new renegotiation of the
Participation Contracts into services contracts as agreed in the October 2008 Actas, failed
to secure Burlington’s agreement to the final draft transitory agreement despite knowing
that such failure would have serious consequences, and “cynically” sought to reopen the

negotiations in May 2009.4

Second, Ecuador contended that Perenco’s refusal to comply with Ecuadorian law and pay

Law 42 dues was “grossly negligent.”4°+

Third, Perenco’s boycott of the auctions of the seized oil during the coactiva process and
its threatening legal action against any company that participated in the auction was said to

have contributed to its loss.4

Fourth, Perenco was said to have acted negligently and recklessly in suspending operations

while consciously ignoring the risk of environmental harm and production loss. In doing

Resp. PHB Q., paragraph 166; Resp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 106. In an earlier version of this contention,
Ecuador seemed to argue that Perenco was negligent when it stopped paying despite the fact that it was
economically capable of doing so (Resp. C-Mem. Q., paragraphs 316, 323).

408

so, Perenco acted in “reckless disregard for its own rights” despite specifically foreseeing

that Ecuador would be forced to respond.*”°

Fifth, Perenco’s failure to resume operations in the Blocks (after having suspended
operations) despite invitations for it to do was also said to have contributed to the harm

which it suffered.‘°”

Before addressing these claimed instances of contributory fault, it is worth noting that the
first completed breach, Decree 662, set in train two main types of damage: (i) a further
reduced “take” for the contractor; and (ii) the virtual immediate cessation of drilling activity
in both Blocks. Perenco in no way contributed to the damage proximately caused by this
measure. Indeed, the various acts complained of by Ecuador all followed Ecuador’s
decision to ratchet up the State’s take from 50% of the ‘above reference price revenues’ to

99%.

Some of the alleged instances of contributory fault can be dismissed summarily. The
Tribunal cannot accept that Perenco’s overall conduct during the negotiation process
contributed to its loss. None of the alleged instances of contributory fault said to arise from
Perenco’s responses to Ecuador’s contractual demands can be considered to amount to
wilful or negligent conduct within the meaning of Article 39 of the ILC Articles. The
Tribunal has already found that it was Ecuador that escalated its demands and threats over
time and that for its part Perenco sought to accommodate such demands to the best of its
ability.4°* For example, the failure to secure Burlington’s consent to the terms of the
October 2008 Acta simply cannot be viewed as being within Perenco’s control, let alone a

wilful or negligent act on its part.

Likewise, for two reasons, Perenco’s decision to suspend operation of the two Blocks in

July 2009, which the Tribunal has already found in its Decision could be justified under

Resp. PHB Q., paragraph 171; Resp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 106,

Ecuadorian law*”, cannot be viewed as a wilful or negligent act which contributed to the
harm that it ultimately suffered. The Tribunal has found that Ecuador committed a breach
of contract by failing to comply with the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures, that
Perenco had a contractual right to expect Ecuador’s compliance with such, and that faced
with Ecuador’s refusal, Perenco had the right to suspend performance under Ecuadorian
law.*!° (The Tribunal also found that just as Perenco had a right to suspend performance
Ecuador had a correlative right to intervene in order to operate and protect the Blocks.*!')

Ultimately, it was the State’s decision to declare caducidad that amounted to the last

completed breach.

To the extent that Ecuador traces this back to a refusal to pay Law 42 dues, as discussed
below, given the intermediation of the Decision on Provisional Measures, the Tribunal
cannot find that Perenco contributed to Ecuador’s decision to expropriate its interests in

the Blocks.

In addition, to the extent that Ecuador complains that, for example, the day after Perenco
suspended operations, it notified its employees in the Blocks that their employment

contracts were terminated, and therefore it “prematurely manufactured a situation in which

99412

was difficult to resume operations , in the Tribunal’s view, Ecuador has not quantified

the loss that it might have suffered when Petroamazonas had to take over production, nor
has it shown that laying off employees led to a loss occasioned to Perenco for which
Perenco now seeks compensation. (The issue of employee costs is comprehended in the

calculation of lost profits for Block 21 and does not arise to any significant degree in

Ibid., paragraphs 434 — 435.
paragraph 417. In the Tribunal’s view, a plain reading of clauses 22.2.2 indicates that the contracting
parties agreed that they would comply not only with a final award (i.e., in Spanish, the ‘/audo’ is
tribunal), but in addition, they would observe and comply with the decisions (i.e., in Spanish, the ‘decisiones’)
of the tribunal. 657 The latter term constitutes a more capacious category of tribunal decisions of which the
final award forms a part. Thus, under the Participation Contracts, Ecuador was bound to comply with the
Decision on Provisional Measures and its failure to do so constituted a breach of contract.

relation to Block 7 since caducidad applied only to the remaining one month of the

Block 7 Contract’s life.)

As to the steps taken by Perenco to refuse to pay Law 42 dues and instead depositing them
in an off-shore account rather than paying them to Ecuador (which began after the dispute
was submitted to arbitration but before the Tribunal issued its Decision on Provisional
Measures and therefore initially was taken without the cover of a tribunal decision), in the
Tribunal’s view, Perenco did assume the risk that the Tribunal might not uphold its legal
position in all respects. In addition, by declining to pay Law 42 dues to Ecuador, it was or
should have been reasonably foreseeable to Perenco that this could invite a strong response

from the State.

Such a response did in fact occur in the form of Ecuador’s notice of its intention to
commence coactivas in order to liquidate Perenco’s Law 42 debt for 2008.“!3 To that
extent, Perenco’s action exacerbated the situation, but this is not the end of the analysis of
this claimed instance of contributory fault. Not long after the Tribunal held its first meeting
with the Parties —at which Perenco had foreshadowed the possibility of a provisional
measures application— such an application was in fact made. The Tribunal ended up
granting Perenco’s request and recommended such measures. The Tribunal specifically
recommended that Ecuador refrain from taking coactiva measures against Perenco and
further called upon the Parties to negotiate an escrow arrangement that would preserve their
respective claims to the disputed funds pending the outcome of the arbitration.*!* This
proved not to be possible for Ecuador. Ecuador explained its view in a respectful and
nonconfrontational manner that it could not comply with the measures recommended by
the Tribunal and that it was bound to initiate the coactivas. But the Tribunal later found in
its Decision on Liability that Perenco was within its contractual rights to expect that

Ecuador would comply with the Tribunal’s provisional measures recommendations.

The Tribunal recalls the relevant findings in its prior Decision on Liability:

Decision on Provisional Measures, paragraph 22.
Ibid., paragraphs 79, 80.

120

359.

360.

“694. The Tribunal has already found that Perenco had a reasonable expectation under the
Participation Contracts that Ecuador would comply with any decision of the Tribunal. This
contractual expectation was buttressed by the general expectation that any disputing party
has that once the dispute is submitted to arbitration, both parties will seek to conform their
conduct to the Tribunal’s directives, particularly with respect to the non-aggravation of the
dispute.

695. Ecuador found itself unable to comply with the Tribunal’s Decision in this case. The
Tribunal can well understand why in 2009, in applying a domestic law, Ecuador would
wish to liquidate the amounts claimed to be owing for 2008. However, when the matter
was put before the Tribunal, Ecuador’s duty to enforce the law conflicted with its
contractual obligation to comply with decisions of the Tribunal. The Tribunal
recc ded what it considered to be a ible way to protect both Parties’ rights
pending a final determination of their dispute. Regrettably, this was not possible in the
circumstances. Perenco is correct to point out that had the State stayed its hand in relation
to the coactivas, the dispute would not have been aggravated in the way in which it was."">
[Emphasis added.]

 

In adversarial proceedings, a disputing party’s view of its adversary’s conduct as
unacceptable or inappropriate is usually viewed by the other party as perfectly acceptable
and appropriate in the circumstances. In the Tribunal’s view, it is wrong to equate a party’s
zealous protection of its legal rights and interests with wilful conduct or contributory
negligence within the meaning of the ILC Articles. Perenco did assume a risk when it
unilaterally decided to pay the Law 42 amounts into an offshore account. However, and
crucially, it then obtained the protection of a Tribunal recommendation that Ecuador not
take coactiva action, as well as a recommendation that the Parties agree an escrow account
arrangement so that the disputed Law 42 dues could be paid into it pending the outcome of

the arbitration (an arrangement which proved to be unattainable in the circumstances).

Perenco was, in the circumstances, entitled to rely upon the Tribunal’s recommendation
and this cannot be considered to be a wilful or negligent contribution to the loss that it
ultimately suffered when Ecuador enforced the coactivas. While Perenco’s act of self-help
prior to the Tribunal’s consideration of its request for provisional measures was aggressive

and perhaps even provocative, it must be viewed in context. Ecuador itself was hardly

Decision on Liability, paragraphs 694-695.

121

361.

362.

blameless in terms of the way in which it escalated pressure on Perenco.*' In the end, since
provisional measures were granted, the Tribunal does not find Perenco’s conduct in this
regard to be wilful or negligent within the meaning of the ILC Articles once that conduct
received the colour of right conferred by the Tribunal’s ruling in Perenco’s favour. At that
point, Perenco was legally entitled to act as it did and it was Ecuador that acted

inconsistently with the Tribunal’s recommendation.

Although the Tribunal declines therefore to find this to be an act of contributory fault, one
aspect of Ecuador’s argument is accepted. As discussed below, Ecuador’s point is
addressed through the Tribunal’s calculation of the damages owing. In deciding the amount
of compensation owing for the unlawful imposition of Decree 662, the Tribunal has agreed
with Brattle’s view that if a party that claims compensation for the levying of a tax has not
actually paid some or all of the tax, it cannot be compensated for that part of the damages
which have been calculated on the assumption that the tax was paid. Thus, the Tribunal’s

‘true-up’ addresses this aspect of Ecuador’s contributory negligence argument.

Turning to the conduct of the auctions of oil seized through the coactivas, once again the
Tribunal agrees that Perenco contributed to the depressed price of oil obtained in the
coactiva auctions (by threatening suit against would-be purchasers). But when considered
in light of the provisional measures already granted by the Tribunal, Perenco has the better
position. Ecuador was evidently able to sell the seized oil at the market price. Given that it
was the purchaser of the oil, it benefited from the depressed purchase price yet credited

Perenco’s Law 42 debt with the depressed price rather than the market value of that oil. In

Such as, for example, blaming Perenco for failing to get the Acra agreed and threatening it with termination
and even expulsion from the country. In its Decision on Liability, paragraphs 144-145, with reference to the
Parties’ correspondence, the Tribunal recounted the fact that on 24 December 2008, Perenco received a letter
from the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum stating that “as a result of the impossibility of arriving at a final
agreement between the parties, due to the intransigent position of your partner Burlington Resources, I would
be very grateful if you would immediately instruct your work team to initiate the process of reversion of
Block 7, the contract for which ends in the year 2010. Moreover, PERENCO, in its capacity as Operator,
must also immediately assign its negotiating team to early termination of the Block 21 contract, by mutual
agreement.” Perenco then wrote to the Minister of Mines and Petroleum requesting him to reconsider the
position expressed in the letter of 24 December 2008. But on 21 January 2009, the Minister of Mines and
Petroleum announced that the negotiations to have Perenco continue operating in Ecuador had become
“practically impossible.”

ai

doing so, it realised an enrichment that in the Tribunal’s view, having regard to the status
of the provisional measures ruling, it would be unjust to enjoy.*!” For that reason, the
Tribunal cannot find that Perenco acted wilfully or negligently in standing on its rights and
threatening suit against would-be purchasers. In all of the circumstances, it was unfair for
Ecuador to buy the oil at a discount and then credit Perenco for only that depressed value.
For that reason, the Tribunal also includes this in the ‘true-up’ adjustment to the damages,

an adjustment that this time redounds to Perenco’s benefit.

Therefore, the various claims of contributory negligence are unavailing.

The ‘true-up’ issue

This takes the Tribunal to the final part of the damages exercise, which is to consider
Ecuador’s ‘true-up’ case. The essence of the case is that Ecuador considers, among other
things, that since the Tribunal found no breach of contract or the Treaty for Law 42 at 50%
and because, on Ecuador’s reading of the Contracts, their economy was never disturbed at

50% or at 99%, Perenco owes it a substantial amount of unpaid Law 42 dues.

1. Ecuador’s Position
Ecuador contended that the damages owed to Perenco were either nil — once offsetting dues
said to be owed under Law 42 are included in the analysis (the “true-up”) or at best the

Respondent owed Perenco US$114.3 million.*!®

366. Ecuador argued that the Tribunal should apply the ‘true-up’ so as to account for the amount

owed by Perenco to Ecuador as a consequence of: (i) the Consortium’s withholding
significant Law 42 dues (not only Decree 662 dues) since 2008; and (ii) Ecuador’s having
to fund the Blocks’ operations for one full year from July 2009 until July 2010, while

crediting the Consortium with production.

367. Brattle calculated three alternative ‘true-up’ figures depending on the price used to account

for the oil seized and sold by Ecuador under the coactivas (higher prices meaning a lower
debt for Perenco).‘'? Ecuador contended that any compensation should take into

consideration Perenco’s contribution to the reduced sales price for the oil auctioned in the

US$216.2 million (price at which Ecuador sold the seized oil), US$125.6 million (market prices as of the
date of production of the seized oil), and US$83.7 million (market prices on auction date) (Brattle ER II,
Table 1, p. vi). However, this distinction becomes irrelevant in three of the four stabilization scenarios
analyzed by Brattle because the damages net of true up are US$0 regardless of the alternative used (Brattle
ER II, Table 1, p. vi.).

coactivas process. It is undisputed that Perenco boycotted the auctions, which led to the

seized oil being sold at below the prevailing market price.

Ecuador contended that the appropriate amount to be set-off is $216 million, given that
Perenco illegally prevented Ecuador from selling the oil at a higher price. Should the
Tribunal consider that Ecuador was to blame for the reduced auction, the set-off would be

$125.6 million.

Brattle explained that the calculation of ‘true-up’ is ex post in nature (i.e., it employs actual
prices)*”° in contrast to the approach proposed by Brattle (accepted by the Tribunal) of
calculating damages to Perenco ex ante. The ‘true-up’ must adopt an ex post perspective
since it must assess what Law 42 amounts were actually paid by the Consortium and which
levies remain outstanding. Ecuador asserted that Professor Kalt never took issue with the
concept.“”! It further explained that imposing on Perenco the change in oil prices when it
chose to withhold taxes was entirely appropriate, while also acknowledging that the
allocation of risks was ultimately an issue for the Tribunal. Hence the sensitivity

calculations that it performed of the “true-up.”

2. Perenco’s Position

Perenco takes issue with Professor Dow’s claim that his analysis of the impact of Decree
662 as of October 2007 does not benefit from the use of hindsight. This is untrue. When
Professor Dow calculated his “true-up” for Law 42 amounts and for the 2009-2010
operating expenses allegedly owed by Perenco to Ecuador, he improperly mixed his ex ante
calculation with ex post data. This was not an inconsequential error. The oil prices produced
as of October 2007 were substantially lower than the actual prices in the market. Thus, in

Professor Dow’s model, Perenco was made purportedly indifferent to Decree 662 in

Brattle ER II, paragraph 53.
Resp. Rep. PHB Q., paragraph 101(v).

424

October 2007 at relatively low forecasted prices, but that price of indifference sum is then

offset by actual Law 42 assessments made on the basis of far higher prices.*””

On this basis, Professor Dow calculated minimum and maximum true-up amounts of
US$83.7 million and US$216.2 million, respectively.*? Yet in Perenco’s view, there is no
reason why ex post data should be allowed to calculate Perenco’s alleged liabilities, but not
to calculate Perenco’s entitlement to damages. In fact, such mixing of ex post and ex ante
data fails to transfer the risks of oil prices to Ecuador, despite Professor Dow’s claim that
an ex ante approach “acknowledges this transfer of risk, for good or for bad, at the time of
the expropriation.”**4 Professor Dow’s willingness to mix and match ex ante and ex post

information when the result is reduction in Perenco’s damages is unprincipled.

3. The Tribunal’s Decision

For present purposes, the Tribunal considers that to the extent that a ‘true-up’ is appropriate
with respect to unpaid Law 42 levies, after the Consortium suspended payment in April
2008, the true-up must adhere to the ex ante assumptions of future oil prices. Obviously,
this issue is also linked to the level of taxation pursuant to Law 42 that the Tribunal has
decided was not proven to be unlawful prior to the adoption of Decree 662 (i.e., Law 42 at

50% up to October 2008 and Law 42 at 33% thereafter.)

Either way, the Tribunal agrees in this respect with Professor Kalt that Brattle mixed ex
ante and ex post data in order to arrive at its true-up calculations for the difference between
the tax payments assumed in the 4 October 2007 FMV estimation and the actual amounts
that were subsequently calculated by Ecuador and imposed in the latter part of 2007-2008

before prices crashed, and again in 2010, when prices recovered.
Professor Kalt made the point as follows:

“The hypothetical ‘buyer’ of rights in Brattle’s framework (Ecuador) has
essentially said to the hypothetical willing seller (Perenco): ‘Back in

427

October 2007, we agreed I would pay you $X (plus interest) in 2015 for
you to allow me to impose a 99% tax on your revenues for the life of the
Blocks. As it turns out, market conditions were such that I’ve ended up
levying $2X on you, but only actually collecting $.9X from you. So, Iam
going to deduct $1.1X ($2X minus $.9X) from X and I won't have to pay
you anything. After all, you agreed in our fair market transaction back in
2007 to let me levy a 99% tax on you, and you took the risk that my tax
assessments would turn out to be larger than either of us originally
anticipated.”

The Tribunal agrees with the general thrust of this criticism.*?° Ecuador cannot have it both
ways and must be held to its side of the compensation calculation. With an ex ante
approach, the financial impact of the tax is assessed as of October 2007 and that is the
measure of compensation. It would be unfair to permit Ecuador to take the position that an
unforeseen increase in oil prices and consequently higher actual Law 42 levies should be
imposed on Perenco when conducting the ‘true-up’. By the Tribunal’s acceptance of
Ecuador’s argument that damages must be calculated on an ex ante basis, this crystallises
the tax’s impact as of 4 October 2007 in the ‘but for’ world. Ecuador thus foregoes the
right to seek additional amounts based on subsequent unforeseen market developments.
Therefore, the Tribunal will not permit the difference between the anticipated levies used
in the FMV calculations and the actual amounts levied to be set-off against Perenco.*”’ The

‘true-up’ as originally calculated by Brattle has therefore been adjusted to take out Brattle’s

Kalt ER IV, paragraph 56.

The Brattle Group essentially admitted that this was the case at Brattle ER III, paragraph 103: “Professor Kalt
is nevertheless correct that this approach to computing the true-up imposes on Perenco the risk of deviations
between the price and production expectations implicit in our ex-ante assessment of the damages for Decree
662, and the prevailing prices and production when the various decisions to withhold payment, seize oil and
vacate/enter the blocks occurred. Prevailing prices, production and costs at the time of the separate decisions
to withhold payment, seize production and vacate/enter the blocks turned out to be at times higher and at
times lower than those expected in October 2007, resulting in either higher or lower credits to Perenco than
implicit in the ex-ante analysis of Decree 662.” At paragraphs 106-107, Brattle sought to justify its approach,
but the Tribunal considers that it would be most consistent with the ex ante approach to hold both Parties to
the assumed financial impact of the tax going forward.

The Tribunal notes that Brattle has stated at fn 6 of its Brattle ER III that it performed this sort of calculation:
“|. we compute a fourth alternative, which uses October 2007 price expectations instead of outturn prices
(whether actuals or coactivas auctions). This fourth measure insulates Perenco from the risk of deviations
between the price expectations prevailing at the time Ecuador issued Decree 662, and when Perenco then
withheld payment, Ecuador seized consortium production in response, and Perenco finally vacated/Ecuador
entered the blocks. We present these calculations in Appendix E.”

initial use of ex post pricing data which had the effect of increasing the amount that Perenco

was said to owe Ecuador.

There are, however, some ex post developments that in fairness must be taken into
consideration. The payment of damages for Decree 662 calculated on an ex ante basis
assumes not only a particular oil price, as just discussed, but also that the person subject to
the unlawful tax has actually paid it. The Consortium paid Law 42 dues at 99% from 4
October 2007 until 30 April 2008 when it opened the off-shore bank account into which
Law 42 dues were thereafter deposited. Perenco would be unjustly enriched if it received
damages for the period when it did not actually remit the Law 42 fees to Ecuador.

Therefore, the Tribunal has taken that into consideration when calculating the true-up.

It has been further adjusted to reflect the fact that Perenco did not succeed in proving a
breach of contract or Treaty in respect of Law 42 at 50%. However, it reflects the unlawful
demand for an additional 49% of the extraordinary revenues as well as the Tribunal’s
finding that Perenco would have sought absorption pursuant to the Contracts’ modification

clauses and the Parties would have agreed to stabilisation at 33% as of October 2008.

Additionally, it has been adjusted to address Perenco’s share of termination costs related

2.428

to the implementation of Decree 66: as well as Ecuador’s claimed expenses during the

time of Perenco’s suspension of its operatorship.

The ‘true-up’ must also address the coactivas issue in Perenco’s favour. As the Tribunal
noted in its earlier Decision on Liability, it was unfair and inequitable for Ecuador to seize
Perenco’s production in order to satisfy its tax payment demand and then to credit Perenco
with the depressed price rather than the market price. The Tribunal acknowledges that this
occurred in the contentious circumstances of Ecuador’s non-compliance with the
Tribunal’s attempt to prevent the further aggravation of the dispute. It also notes that since
Ecuador successfully defended the claims against Law 42 at 50%, Perenco’s having

assumed the risk that it would prevail on all claims exposed it to the situation it now finds

Exhibits JK-64 and JK-51.

128

429

itself in, namely, that only the collection of Law 42 at 99% was found to amount to a breach
for which compensation is due and therefore Law 42 at 50% — at least up until Decree 662
— must be presumptively treated as lawful. As the Tribunal noted in its previous Decision

on Liability:

“Tt considers that Perenco had a right to expect that Ecuador would desist
from enforcing the coactivas during the pendency of the arbitration. It also
considers that in deciding to withhold all Law 42 amounts claimed in 2008,
Perenco assumed that the Tribunal would accept its claims that none of the
Law 42 dues claimed by the State were permissible under the Contracts or
the Treaty. Given that Perenco has not made out its claims in respect of
Law 42 at 50%, the Tribunal holds that even though Ecuador should have
complied with the Decision on Provisional Measures, the coactivas ought
not to be included in the Tribunal’s analysis of the measures said
collectively to constitute an indirect expropriation...In addition, to_the
extent that Perenco_has ded Ht

 

in its claim that the ication of

Decree 662 at 99% violated Article 4 of the Treaty, as found at paragraphs
606-607 above, the enforcement of the coactivas to collect the claimed

 

 

 

additional 49% constituted a breach of the fair and itabl
standard, but it was not an expropriation of the investment.).”4”° [Emphasis
added.]

In the end, neither Party emerges from this part of the dispute as the clear winner and the

‘true-up’ must reflect this mixed success.

Quantum Based on a ‘Harmonised Model’

Before the Tribunal estimates the financial consequences on Blocks 7 and 21 in light of
Ecuador’s breaches, it is necessary to explain the methodology that was used to estimate
the damages to be awarded for each individual claim in light of the factual and legal

findings that the Tribunal has made in the preceding parts of this Award.

Having considered the Parties’ submissions, the expert evidence and the other evidence on
record, a ‘harmonised model’ was devised through which the Tribunal has calculated the

damages to be awarded.

430

As described above, the Tribunal had been presented with damages valuation based on

430 and Brattle.**! These models employed

spreadsheet models submitted by Professor Kalt
the same overall architecture**” but differed in respect of five major assumptions, which
were the main issues that separated the Parties as ultimately identified and addressed in
Section II.B, as well as other minor differences in assumptions. Given these similarities, a
‘harmonised model’ could be produced through the adjustments of the models to
implement the Tribunal’s findings. These changes are described below and also describes

the ‘harmonised model’ employed by the Tribunal.

1. The ‘harmonised model’

The ‘harmonised model’ assumes away the effect of Decree 662 and caducidad in order to
arrive at the net present value of the discounted cash flows that would have been derived
from Blocks 7 and 21. This is based on the production decisions that the Tribunal has found
Perenco would have made but for the unlawful measures. In order to address Professor Kalt’s
concerns, the Tribunal has employed the model to make an initial valuation of the damage
caused by Decree 662 and then a second valuation of the damage caused by the declaration

of caducidad.

The Tribunal finds that in the ‘but for’ world, Law 42 at 50% would have continued to
apply from October 2007 until 5 October 2008 at which point, by party agreement, the rate
would have been 33%, which rate would have applied from that date through to the

respective expiry dates of the two Participation Contracts.

The Tribunal therefore first seeks to forecast the production in both Blocks in the ‘but for’
world for the first period and for Block 21 for the second period on an ex ante basis. After
estimating the production levels, the production is then priced on the basis of ex ante

expectations at the relevant times. The Tribunal then also seeks to estimate the amount of

Prof. Kalt’s spreadsheet models were provided as Exhibit JK-32 in the first round of pleadings on quantum
and Exhibit JK-64 in the second round.

Brattle’s spreadsheet models were provided as Tables B and C in the first round of pleadings on quantum and
Tables P and O in the second round.

 

The similarities in the models reflected in part the fact that Brattle took Professor Kalt’s original spreadsheet
models and then adjusted them to reflect its own assumptions and inputs.

433

capital expenditure and operating expenditure, and other costs, associated with the assumed
levels of production. The cash flows are then discounted to the relevant date of valuation,

and then brought forward to the date of the Award at pre-award interest rates.

Finally, the true-up is applied to reflect the acts discussed previously that affect the

quantum calculation.

The following sections explain further each of these steps taken in relation to the

‘harmonised model’.

2. Valuation Dates

The first of the major assumptions that had to be adjusted in the ‘harmonised model’ was
the relevant valuation dates. First, Professor Kalt’s modelling of damages flowing from the
period between October 2007 and June 2010, which was done on an ex post basis, was
adjusted to reflect the Tribunal’s conclusion that an ex ante analysis is to be employed. At
the same time, Brattle’s sequential ‘two layer’ approach was then adjusted to create a ‘clean

sheet’ for damages in respect of the expropriation on 20 July 2010.

This means that the damages are estimated in respect of the 4 October 2007 breach on the
basis of forecasted cash flows up until June 2010, and cash flows that would have occurred
between October 2007 and June 2010 are discounted back to the October 2007 valuation
date. For damages flowing from the July 2010 expropriation, this is based on forecasted
cash flows until the expiry of the Blocks 7 and 21 Participation Contracts (16 August 2010
and 8 June 2021, respectively***). If a cash flow would have occurred after July 2010, this
is discounted back to the July 2010 valuation date. The discount rate applied is 12%, which

was the rate utilised by both Parties’ experts.**+

3. Production and Investment

The second issue on which the experts’ models differed was the investment and production
to be forecasted ‘but for’ Ecuador’s conduct. Professor Kalt’s models reflected Mr. Crick’s

analysis and projections; the Brattle models reflected RPS’ analysis and projections.

For Block 7, the Tribunal has estimated that 23 additional wells would have been drilled
during the life of the Block 7 Participation Contract. Four wells would have been drilled
by January 2008 and the remaining 19 would have been drilled between February 2008 and
August 2009. Further, having concluded that Mr. Crick’s production profiles as presented
at the Quantum Hearing were to be preferred over those presented by RPS, and consistent
with Mr. Crick’s forecasts of new oil wells, the Tribunal accepts that all ‘but for’ wells
during the production lifetime of Block 7 would be drilled in the Oso field within Area
Base. The production volume calculated relies on Mr. Crick’s forecasts**> but which are

slightly adjusted for purposes of an ex ante analysis as of October 2007.7°

Mr. Crick also provided forecasts for Coca-Payamino. The ‘harmonised model’ adopts

those numbers without amendments.*”

On this basis, the Tribunal forecasts that the ‘but for’ production in Block 7 would have
been as follows. This is broken down into ‘base’ production i.e. oil which would have been
produced in addition to base production absent Decree 662, and ‘incremental’ production
i.e. oil which would have been produced in addition to base production but for Decree 662.
Risk-adjustment factors as used in Exhibit JK-94 were applied to reflect the proved and

probable reserves planned.

In view of the Tribunal’s decision on the Block 7 extension question, no forecasts for

production in Block 7 from August 2010 onwards are made.

In relation to Block 21, the Tribunal has concluded that an incremental six wells would
have been drilled pre-caducidad and 10 would have been drilled post-caducidad. The pre-
caducidad wells are assumed to have been drilled on a one-well-per-month schedule with
incremental production commencing in August 2008, consistent with the drilling schedule
proposed by Mr. Crick.*** Production for these six wells reflects the production from the

first six wells (all 1P wells) according to Mr. Crick’s schedule.**”

The post-caducidad wells are assumed to have been drilled on a one-well-per-month
schedule with incremental production commencing August 2010. In addition, Mr. Crick’s
testimony was that a small portion of oil produced from the new wells would have been

produced from the existing wells, which were adjusted for in his profiles set out in his

4, Prices for Oil Production

As alluded to above, ex ante prices are applied to the production from each Block.
However, as the evidence showed and which was not disputed, the oil quality of each Block
differs — Block 7 produced Oriente quality crude oil and Block 21 Napo quality. Therefore,
the ex ante prices for oil production from each Block and over different time periods had

to be calculated.

First, ex-ante WTI prices were used. These were NYMEX futures prices as of the two key
dates of valuation: October 2007 and July 2010.**! These prices were slightly increased to

reflect an insurance component embedded in futures prices.

Second, these prices were adjusted to reflect the differences in quality between WTI crude
oil and that produced in Ecuador i.e. Oriente and Napo crude oil. Since Oriente crude oil is
of a relatively higher quality than Napo crude oil, the former generally commands a higher

price. Using the historical price discounts applied to the two types of crude oil produced

Brattle Workpapers, Table D.
Brattle ER II, paragraphs 214-219.

This difference is reflected in the historical price data exhibited in Exhibit JK-57 and Brattle Workpapers,
Table D.

134

401.

402.

in Ecuador relative to WTI prices, the expected ex ante WTI prices were adjusted
downwards to derive the expected ex ante Oriente prices, and downwards further for ex

ante Napo prices.*+

Third, these prices are adjusted further to reflect the specific quality of the crude oil
produced in Blocks 7 and 21. These adjustments were made on the basis of the historical
relationship between the prices and quality of the Oriente and Napo benchmarks and the
prices and qualities of the field-specific oil, and the resulting field-specific price adjustment
factors are consistent with formulas detailed in Ecuador’s own calculations of oil prices in
its Law 42 assessments.**> The field-specific adjustment factors are then applied to the
benchmark oil prices in Ecuador (Oriente for Block 7 Area Base and Napo for Block 21)

to generate field-specific prices.**°

5. Operating Expenses (OPEX)

Benchmark operating costs have been adopted in the ‘harmonised model’. This is
consistent with the experts’ financial models which both used similar operating cost
calculations. However, these calculations were adjusted to reflect an ex ante modelling
perspective as of the two valuation dates. Reliance has largely been placed on the
benchmarks found in Exhibit JK-64, but with the Amazonian Eco-development Fund
(“Fondo ecodesarrollo regién amazénica’”’) benchmarks adjusted to reflect the increase in
its rate between the two valuation dates. This was done by using a 2006-2007 average of
the cost for the October 2007 to June 2010 period and the 2008 cost for the post-July 2010
period.“” The ‘harmonised model’ used by the Tribunal continues to inflate the benchmark
operating costs over time, which is consistent with the expert evidence on this issue.“ It

also credits Ecuador with the outstanding AGIP pipeline tariff balance as of October

6. Capital Expenditure (CAPEX)

In relation to the productions forecasted for Block 7 as set out above, the Oso capital
expenditure is based on Mr. Crick’s evidence which was utilised by Professor Kalt in his
financial model.**° All assumed capital expenditures reflect the same essential build-up of
individual per-well and facilities costs reflected in Professor Kalt’s first Quantum
calculations**! but adjusted to reflect the Tribunal’s conclusions that (i) 4 wells would have
been drilled by January 2008 and 19 wells drilled between February 2008 to August 2009;

and (ii) the starting point for calculations should be on an ex ante basis. The relevant capital

expenditure is risked to reflect the proved and probable reserves planned.**? The resulting

Block 7 expenditures total US$140.8 million.

For Block 21, capital expenditure is estimated following cost information contained in Mr.

Crick’s Yuralpa development plan.

Mr. Crick’s capital expenditure was adjusted to reflect the 16-well programme as found
above. According to Mr. Crick’s Yuralpa development plan, the timing of fluid handling
capital expenditure is tied to when overall fluid rate (oil plus water) approaches
predetermined thresholds. The 16-well scenario results in a slower fluid rate increase
compared to Mr. Crick’s original scenario. This slower fluid rate increase in the
‘harmonised model’ causes delays for some capital expenditures relative to Mr. Crick’s
original schedule. Since Mr. Crick considered the first 16 wells in his drilling programme

to be 1P wells, risking is not necessary.

Further, Mr. Crick considered that the water produced in relation to 24 wells would have
been limited to 120,000 barrels of water per day (bwpd). Given the number of wells the
Tribunal considers would have been drilled, the Tribunal considers that water production
would have been limited to 120,000 bwpd, i.e. there is no additional water production that
needed to be addressed, and therefore there is no need to further adjust for water

sensitivities.

7. Net Present Value of Cash Flows

The section above sets out the Tribunal’s forecasts for productions in Block 7 and 21 over
the two periods of time. In relation to the production between October 2007 and June 2010,
the Tribunal has priced that production on the basis of ex ante expectations in October 2007
of oil prices for each month during this period. Likewise, production from July 2010

onwards was priced at ex ante July 2010 expectations for each month after July 2010.

The cash flows derived from each period are then discounted at a rate of 12% to October
2007 and July 2010, respectively. The discounted cash flows derived for the two periods

are then added up.

Prejudgment interest is then added to the net present value as of 2007 and 2010 to bring
them forward to the date of the Award. First, monthly yields on 10-year US Treasury
notes**> are used as the risk-free benchmark rate. This rate stood at 4.53% in October 2007

and had fallen to 1.75% as of 11 September 2019. Second, in each month between the dates

This is based on actual historical published annualised yield of the 10-year US T-note as reported by the US
Federal Reserve and published daily by the US Federal Reserve Board. This historical yield data is contained
in Prof. Kalt’s Exhibits JK-39 and JK-77C, as well as Brattle Exhibits BR-20 and BR-116. The Tribunal
understands that Federal Reserve publishes annualised yields. The experts have consistently used the same
series of annualised yields throughout the quantum proceedings. Accordingly, a standard formula has been
used to translate the published annual yields to their monthly equivalents: Monthly rate = (1+
Annual yield)"/? — 1.

The series has been subsequently updated to include more historical data, and the most recent calculations
include accrued prejudgment interest through to September 2016.

of valuation and the date of the Award, the monthly prejudgment interest amount is

computed by applying the monthly interest rate**

to the outstanding damages balance
including all accrued prejudgment interest up to the start of that month. Third, different
cumulative prejudgment interests are applied which reflects the different time periods over

which the prejudgment interest accrues.*°°

Accordingly, based on this, the initial amount of damages estimated to be awarded for
Block 7 is calculated to be US$145.2 million and the amount of damages to be awarded for
Block 21 is calculated to be US$273.7 million, totalling US$418.9 million (as of September

2016). As explained below, certain further adjustments must also be made.

8. The ‘True-Up’

The Tribunal must now consider the implications for the quantum of damages thus far
calculated in light of the matters discussed above. First, Perenco had not paid Law 42 dues
since 30 April 2008 and accordingly did not actually suffer losses in that respect. Second,
where Perenco had paid those dues, there was an ‘overpayment’ of actual Law 42 dues paid
relative to Law 42 dues which should have been paid based on ex ante price assumptions.
Third, the coactivas. Fourth, and relatedly, Petroamazonas had incurred costs in operating
the field in Perenco’s absence. Fifth, there were termination costs associated with Perenco’s

exit.
Accordingly, the ‘true-up’ adjusts the quantum of damages already calculated as follows.

First, Ecuador is credited for the amounts of Law 42 dues that Perenco should have paid

but did not pay since 30 April 2008 (based on ex ante prices).

Second, Perenco is given credit for the Decree 662 dues that it did pay calculated based on
real world prices but which were in excess of Decree 662 dues already accounted for in the

‘harmonised’ model.

See ibid.
This results in more prejudgment interest for damages relating to the October 2007 damages as opposed to
that for 2010.

139

416.

417.

418.

419.

420.

421.

Third, the confluence of events and the Parties’ various actions surrounding the coactivas

has been taken into account.

Fourth, Perenco is credited in the ‘true-up’ for the termination costs that it actually incurred
in response to Decree 662.*°° Perenco’s share of the nominal termination costs is $4

million.4°7

Fifth, based on an ex ante analysis, Petroamazonas’ costs based on the operating cost
benchmarks (as already discussed above) and the barrels forecasted by Mr. Crick for the
base wells during the relevant period is US$45.3 million (this is Perenco’s share of the

costs).

In light of these factors and the amounts involved, the Tribunal concludes that a fair amount
for the ‘true-up’ should be US$36.4 million (after discounting and bringing forward the
relevant cash flows). Thus, the total compensation for Blocks 7 and 21 is reduced by that

sum to US$382.5 million.

9. OCP Deductibility
The Tribunal concludes that there should be full tax deductibility in relation to Block 21’s
OCP ship-or-pay costs. Accordingly, this adds US$9 million to the quantum to be awarded
to Perenco. The amount of US$382.5 million is therefore increased by US$9 million to

amount to US$391.5 million.

10. Value of Loss of Opportunity

Finally, the Tribunal concludes that this should be valued at US$25 million. This sum is
added to the amount of US$391.5 million to arrive at a total of US$416.5 million as of
September 2016.

11. Conclusion on Damages in relation to the breach of the Treaty and
the Participation Contracts

The sum of US$416.5 million arrived at above is then brought forward to the date of this
Award by means of multiplying that sum by an adjustment factor of 1.0776 to arrive at a
final figure of US$448,820,400.00. This sum is the damages that are awarded to Perenco
and shall be paid by the Respondent, the Republic of Ecuador.

DAMAGES CLAIMED IN RELATION TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL
COUNTERCLAIM

Circumstances leading to the appointment of Mr. Scott MacDonald as Independent
Expert

The Tribunal has already adverted to its decision to appoint an Independent Expert if the
Parties proved to be unable to settle the environmental counterclaim in light of the findings
of fact and law made in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim. By way of introduction to

this part of the Award, it warrants repeating why the Tribunal acted as it did.
In the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, the Tribunal made the following observations:

“581. The Tribunal has now arrived at the point where it has narrowed
the counterclaim on the principal issues of law and fact. The Tribunal has
set out the main issues of fact and law which have divided the experts.
However, with regard to many of the IEMS/GSI differences, the Tribunal
does not feel able to prefer one above the other. It seems to the Tribunal
that each was attempting to achieve the best result for the party by whom
they were instructed, and that they crossed the boundary between
professional objective analysis and party representation. It is clear to the
Tribunal that the experts were effectively shooting at different targets and
this has made the work of this Tribunal most difficult.

583. | The Tribunal has carefully considered the evidence and has found
that there are certain issues of fact on which it is extremely difficult for it
to make proper determinations. As has been seen, the Tribunal has
completely rejected the IEMS’ mapping exercise based on background
values and has found that the appropriate means for establishing the
volume of contaminated soils is delineation. In addition, the Tribunal has
rejected certain interpretations of the Ecuadorian regulatory standards
applied by IEMS. In applying the proper regulatory standards, the Tribunal
finds that the expert evidence from both sides does not provide a sufficient
degree of confidence as to the actual conditions in the Blocks. The
Tribunal considers that there are too many gaps and conflicts between
TEMS’ and GSI’s evidence on these key issues. For example, GSI did not

141

take samples at all of the sites that IEMS tested; for certain sites where
IEMS found contamination, GSI also tested the soil but took samples at
different depths, and GSI used “indicator parameters” rather than testing
comprehensively for all possible oilfield related contaminants. The
Tribunal considers that these gaps must be filled and the technical conflicts
must be resolved in order to arrive at a fair and proper disposition of
Ecuador’s counterclaim.

584. — Inits post-hearing submission, Perenco essentially posited that the
Tribunal faces an ‘all or nothing’ decision:

The various technical issues on which GSI and IEMS so fundamentally
disagree are relevant not because the Tribunal should take as its task
picking and choosing between the experts on each issue one by one,
cafeteria-style, to arrive at some hybrid approach. There is too much
interrelationship between the issues to make that kind of exercise
productive. Instead, those technical issues are relevant because they
provide the basis on which the Tribunal can assess the two approaches,
and the basis on which the Tribunal should conclude that GSI’s approach
is far more reliable and trustworthy than IEMS’ approach.

585. While the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that given the present
state of the evidence it should not “take as its task picking and choosing
between the experts on each issue one by one, cafeteria-style” — because
the Tribunal does not possess the requisite technical expertise to decide
between experts’ disagreements over highly technical issues — it is equally
uncomfortable with simply picking one set of experts’ conclusions over
the other. The Tribunal well understands that the onus of proof is on a
party who makes an allegation and it could be said that because of the
doubt in which the Tribunal finds itself Ecuador could be said to have
failed in tipping the burden in its favour. However, as the Tribunal is
satisfied that there has been some damage for which it seems likely that
Perenco is liable, the Tribunal is not disposed to dismiss the counterclaim
in limine. Given the Constitution’s embrace of the importance of the
protection of the environment, the most accurate picture of the
environmental condition of the Blocks possible — based on the prior
sampling locations of both IEMS and GSI - must inform the Tribunal’s
decision on the counterclaim.

586. Accordingly, the Tribunal has concluded that it must require an
additional phase of fact-finding in order to arrive at a proper and just
conclusion. It is not content to issue a final determination on the extent of
Perenco’s liability on the basis of the current expert reports.

 

587. As already intimated, the Tribunal intends to appoint its own
independent environmental expert who will be instructed to apply the
Tribunal’s findings set out above and work with the Tribunal and the
Parties to enable the Tribunal to determine the extent of contamination in
the Blocks for which compensation is owed.

142

588. The Tribunal wishes to underscore the fact that the expert chosen
to conduct this investigation (after consultation with the Parties to ensure
complete independence and impartiality) will be the Tribunal’s expert and
will be solely answerable to the Tribunal. In due course, the Tribunal will
provide a protocol for the expert, setting out the precise questions to be
answered in line with the findings made in this Decision. The Parties will
be permitted to attend when the expert and his/her team carries out the
necessary investigations and the Parties will receive a copy of the expert’s
report and will be permitted to comment thereon in due course. Naturally,
the costs involved in this exercise will initially be borne by the Parties in
equal shares with any subsequent allocation of costs to be determined by
the Tribunal at the appropriate time.

593. That said, the Tribunal considers it highly desirable for the Parties
to take time to properly digest the contents of this Decision and its
implications in the overall scheme of things, and they may wish to consider
embarking on a mediation process or some other consensual procedure to
assist in arriving at a mutually acceptable figure. Having regard to the
Tribunal’s findings in relation to: (i) background values; (ii) the temporal
application of the 2008 Constitution to the facts of this case; (iii) the
applicable standards under Ecuadorian law; (iv) the 2008 Constitution’s
variation of the limitations period; (v) the Tribunal’s criticism of the
narrowness of GSI’s sampling practices; (vi) the Tribunal’s rejection of
TEMS’ mapping and unit costs for remediation; and (vii) the fact the
Tribunal will not permit the sampling of areas in the Blocks which were
not previously sampled by either party’s experts, the Tribunal believes that
the remaining issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages
anywhere near the amount claimed by Ecuador. The Parties will doubtless
take all this into account as well as the considerable cost of the further
enquiry which the Tribunal considers is absolutely necessary to arrive at a
just result in the circumstances of this case in deciding whether it is
possible for them to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of this
aspect of the dispute.

594. The Tribunal’s strong preference and hope is that after receiving
this Decision and considering the Tribunal’s findings, the legal aspects of
the counterclaim will have been sufficiently clarified so as to enable the
Parties to agree on a suitable amount of compensation with or without the
assistance of an independent expert or a final Tribunal determination. In
the event that such an agreement is reached, it will be recorded and
included in the Tribunal’s Award. If an agreement is not reached, the
Tribunal will await the results of its expert’s work and make a final
decision which will be included in the Award.”

425. As it turned out, the Parties failed to reach an agreement. They then jointly interviewed and

agreed on the appointment of Mr. Scott MacDonald as the Independent Expert and the

143

426.

427.

428.

429.

430.

431.

Tribunal accepted their recommendation. Accordingly, Mr. MacDonald was formally

appointed as the Independent Expert on 6 July 2016.48

Mr. MacDonald directed a team of environmental specialists of Ramboll in the design and
conduct of the sampling campaign that the Tribunal contemplated in its Interim Decision
on Counterclaim. Under the supervision of the Tribunal, Mr. MacDonald created field
sampling protocols and was assisted by Jose Sananes, Clement Ockay, Miles Ingraham,
Tais dos Santos, Pablo Yoshikawa, Adrian Gomez, Guillermo Gloria and Aldo Rodriguez

(all from Ramboll).4°?

Procedural History

While Mr. MacDonald was reviewing the IEMS and GSI data and was designing his
workplan, the Burlington proceeding concluded. Accordingly, on 2 March 2017, the
Tribunal invited the Parties to comment on that tribunal’s Decision on Reconsideration and

Award and its Decision on Counterclaims.

On 18 April 2017, the Parties filed their comments. On the same date, Perenco also filed

its First Dismissal Application.

On 18 August 2017, following the filing of the Parties’ written submissions, the Tribunal
issued its Decision on Perenco’s First Dismissal Application. It rejected Perenco’s First

Dismissal Application and reserved costs for future determination.

On 27 October 2017, the Parties agreed on the Protocol for the Independent Expert’s

Second Site Visit.

On 30 January 2018, Perenco submitted a Second Dismissal Application. Perenco also
proposed a briefing schedule in its letter accompanying the application and suggested that
while the Tribunal considered Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application, Mr. MacDonald

should suspend work on his report, or complete his report but refrain from submitting it to

Procedural Order No. 16.

the Tribunal and the Parties until the Tribunal’s decision on the Second Dismissal

Application.

On 31 January 2018, the Tribunal invited Ecuador to reply to Perenco’s letter of 30 January
2018. Also, the Tribunal invited the Parties to agree, by 5 February 2018, on the briefing

schedule for Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application.

On 5 February 2018, Ecuador replied to Perenco’s letter of 30 January 2018 and proposed

an alternative briefing schedule for the Second Dismissal Application.

On 6 February 2018, Perenco requested the Tribunal for leave to reply to Ecuador’s letter
of 5 February 2018. On the same day, the Tribunal granted Perenco’s request to comment

on Ecuador’s letter of 5 February 2018.

On 8 February 2018, Perenco replied to Ecuador’s letter of 5 February 2018 regarding the

schedule and procedure for determining Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application.

On 9 February 2018, Ecuador asked the Tribunal for leave to respond to Perenco’s letter

of 8 February 2018. On the same day, the Tribunal granted Ecuador’s request.

On 12 February 2018, Ecuador submitted a reply to Perenco’s letter of 8 February 2018.

On 15 February 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it would decide the Second
Dismissal Application but at the same time Mr. MacDonald’s work would continue. His
Independent Expert’s Report would be submitted to the Parties only if the Tribunal decided

to deny Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application.

On 15 March 2018, Ecuador filed its Response to Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application.
On 5 April 2018, Perenco filed its Reply on Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application.

On 26 April 2018, Ecuador filed its Rejoinder on Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application.
On 30 July 2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties through a letter from its Secretary that

the Tribunal had decided, by a majority, to dismiss Perenco’s Second Dismissal

Application, and reasons for this decision, as indicated in that letter, are now provided in

this Award.

On 3 October 2018, the Independent Expert informed the Tribunal that he would need
additional time to complete his work and submit the Independent Expert Report. No useful
purpose would be served by recounting the various exchanges between the Parties and the
Tribunal relating to the inevitable delays in the production of what turned out to be a most

detailed, useful and comprehensive report.

Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application

The Parties’ submissions and the Tribunal’s reasons for its rejection of Perenco’s Second

Dismissal Application are set out as follows.

1. Perenco’s Arguments

In its Second Dismissal Application, Perenco argues that “Ecuador asserted the same
counterclaims in both the Burlington and Perenco arbitrations.”* Perenco contends that
“the Burlington arbitration has come to a final and irrevocable end, and Ecuador has now
received payment of the entire amount due in respect of the counterclaims that it presented
to the two tribunals” in performance of the settlement agreement between Burlington and
Ecuador dated 1 December 2017 (the “Settlement Agreement”).**! Perenco submits that
Burlington’s settlement with Ecuador, and the full payment of the Burlington’s and
Perenco’s joint counterclaims debt, means that Ecuador’s counterclaims against Perenco

should be dismissed.*°

In its Reply, Perenco disagrees with Ecuador’s contention that its Second Dismissal
Application is untimely. Perenco contends that its failure to raise lis pendens cannot

constitute a bar to its application, because “Jis pendens is not a proxy for satisfaction of a

Second Dismissal Application, paragraph 6.

146

447.

448.

467

468

469

liability, res judicata, mootness, or abuse of process.”46 According to Perenco, the
situation resulting from the Burlington award and Burlington’s payment would have been
the same, “[e]ven if Perenco had sought, and this Tribunal had granted, a temporary stay
based on lis pendens.”** Perenco further claims that its conduct cannot be construed as a
waiver, for it “cannot conceivably have waived in advance the right to rely on intervening
factual circumstances with dispositive effect on the arbitration.”*°° Perenco adds that
Ecuador’s plea of estoppel cannot succeed in this case, as “Perenco had no ‘contradictory
behaviour’, and Ecuador did not change its position in detrimental reliance on Perenco’s

failure to seek a lis pendens suspension.”*°

In support of its submission to dismiss Ecuador’s counterclaims, Perenco advanced three

main arguments:

“(1) satisfaction of the joint and several counterclaims liability
extinguishes Perenco’s underlying obligation to Ecuador...; (2) Ecuador’s
identical counterclaims in these proceedings are moot because there is no
dispute for this tribunal to decide; and (3) Ecuador’s counterclaims are res
judicata because the Burlington CC Decision [i.e. the Burlington Decision
on Counterclaims] is no longer subject to any uncertainty, and continuing
to litigate them would be an abuse of process.’4°7

 

 

Perenco argues that “Burlington’s payment of the Consortium’s counterclaims liability
satisfies and extinguishes the joint debt so that, as a matter of law, Ecuador cannot continue
to pursue Perenco on that debt.”#°* Perenco contends on the basis of the applicable
Ecuadorian law that a joint and several liability is extinguished for all of the joint debtors

when one debtor satisfies that liability.“ According to Perenco, Ecuador has now received

449.

full satisfaction with respect to the counterclaims.*”° Relying on Annex 3 of the Settlement
Agreement, Perenco alleges that Ecuador “accepted that the payment represented ‘the
principal amount and the applicable interest’ ordered by the Burlington tribunal, that it was
paid ‘as the full and final settlement of the environment and infrastructure counterclaims
presented by Ecuador against Burlington[,]’ and that by doing so ‘all obligations and
liabilities related to the Counterclaims against Burlington and the Decision on the
Counterclaims shall be deemed to have been irrevocably, fully and finally paid, discharged,

and satisfied.””*"

Perenco emphasises that Ecuador presented the same claims, obligations and liabilities to
both the Perenco and Burlington tribunals on the basis that Perenco and Burlington were

jointly and severally liable.*””

Perenco asserts that “Ecuador has now received what it
acknowledges to be full satisfaction of the obligation it asserted against Burlington” and
“that obligation is necessarily the same as the obligation it asserted against Perenco.”47
Perenco adds in this respect that the fact “that the factual records before the Perenco and
Burlington tribunals diverge in some respects does not mean the underlying obligations are
legally distinct.”*”* Furthermore, Perenco maintains that Ecuador expressly claimed the
total amount of damages from each of Burlington and Perenco and not the aliquot share.*”°
In addition, Perenco emphasises that “the possibility that the Perenco Tribunal ... might
ultimately determine higher or lower quantification of the counterclaims damages is
irrelevant”, because “the obligation on which those damages were premised has been
satisfied and extinguished.”*7° Perenco stresses that “Ecuador has been satisfied not just

for the ‘amounts’ the Burlington tribunal calculated, but also for the underlying damage or

harm; and not just for the obligations and liabilities the Burlington tribunal specified in its

Decision on the Counterclaims, but for the counterclaims themselves.”477

In its Reply, Perenco responds to Ecuador’s argument that “Perenco was not a signatory to
the Settlement Agreement and that Burlington’s payment can have no effect on
Perenco.”478 Perenco contends that “the operation of satisfaction as a matter of Ecuadorian
law does not depend on, or result from, the content or existence of Annex 3”, because “the
obligation was extinguished through full payment, by operation of law.” In addition to
the arguments put forward in its Second Dismissal Application, Perenco alleges that
“Tt]here would...be no point in acknowledging that Burlington would seek ‘contribution’,
or in Perenco disclosing the Annex to its Tribunal, if Burlington’s payment to Ecuador was

just for its own distinct liability.”4°°

According to Perenco’s interpretation, the provision relied upon by Ecuador “allows joint
debtors to settle their own share of a joint and several liability and provides that such a
settlement would be binding between its signatories only.”**! However, Perenco contests
the applicability of this rule in this case in which “Ecuador did not ‘settle’ Burlington’s
aliquot share of the environmental harm with Burlington”, but “Burlington paid Ecuador...

482 Perenco

full reparation for the environmental harm claimed against the Consortium.
asserts that Ecuador “was prevented [by the Ecuadorian Constitution] from ‘settling’ with
Burlington for anything other than ‘full reparation’ for the joint and several liability”
allegedly according to Ecuador’s own admission.**? Perenco, furthermore, rejects the view
that Ecuadorian law does not recognise the notion of mutual representation, pointing in this

regard to a provision stipulating that “by virtue of an agreement, a will or the law, the full

debt can be sought from any one of the debtors and by any one of the creditors; in that case,

the obligation is solidaria or in solidum.”**4

Perenco maintains that “the satisfaction of Perenco’s and Burlington’s counterclaims
liability also makes Ecuador’s counterclaims in this arbitration moot.”**> Perenco refers to
the case law of the International Court of Justice in which the Court has declined to give
judgment in cases where “circumstances that have since arisen render any adjudication
devoid of purpose”, or the “dispute has disappeared because the object and purpose of the
claim has been achieved by other means.”**° Perenco alleges that this Tribunal recognised
mootness as a separate and independent basis on which to dismiss Ecuador’s
counterclaims, but refrained from doing so because the Burlington Decision on
Counterclaims was at the time subject to annulment proceedings.**” Perenco contends that
this is not the case any longer as “[t]here is simply no question about. ..the final settlement

of Ecuador’s counterclaims.”4**

Perenco states that the fact that “Ecuador believes the Burlington tribunal should have
awarded more damages is not a dispute to be adjudicated.”4*° According to Perenco,
“[mJootness is assessed objectively as to the dispute, not the particular form of relief
ultimately obtained.”*”° In support of this claim, Perenco suggests that in the Nuclear Tests
cases “the dispute had disappeared, since the object of the claim had effectively been

accomplished by ‘other means’ than the relief requested.”*”! It also maintains that, in those

cases, “‘the fact that the applicants did not consider the dispute concluded ‘[did] not prevent
the Court from making its own independent finding on the subject.’”“°? Perenco further
suggests that the reasoning of the Orascom award is instructive for the application of the

principle in the investor-State arbitral context.*”°

In its Reply, Perenco underlines that the mootness doctrine is not limited only to cases in
which the requested relief is specific performance.*™ Perenco places particular emphasis
on the Orascom award. The claimant in that case “sought damages, not specific

because the ‘claims

  

performance” and “the tribunal nevertheless dismissed the claim:

arising from Algeria’s measures have ceased to exist due to the settlement agreement’

between a claimant-controlled company and Algeria.”

Perenco submits that “Ecuador’s counterclaims are also res judicata because of the now
unequivocal finality of” the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims.*”* Perenco asserts that
“res judicata precludes re-litigation of the same dispute” and “applies to privies of the
parties to the dispute.”*°” Perenco asserts that this Tribunal “recognized that the Burlington
Award was formally res judicata”, but denied Perenco’s First Application “because of the
uncertainty about [its] finality...pending annulment.”*”* It furthermore contends that “there

can be no residual argument that Perenco waived res judicata by failing to earlier raise lis

pendens.”*?

In its Reply, Perenco rejects Ecuador’s contention that res judicata is inapplicable because
the party identity requirement is not met.°°? Perenco relies on the Grynberg, Apotex III, and
Ampal-American awards to argue that “res judicata applies to privies or other
stakeholders.”*°! Contrary to Ecuador’s allegations, Perenco adds that privity does not
require ownership, even if the principle has been applied so far only in the specific context
of a shareholder-parent company relationship.» Perenco asserts that “privity exists when
two entities share an identity of interest that means they equally stand to benefit or suffer
economically as a result of an outcome.”*”* According to Perenco, such an identity of

interests exists between Perenco and Burlington.*™*

Perenco also denies Ecuador’s argument that dismissing Ecuador’s counterclaims on the
grounds of res judicata would imply revisiting and reversing the Tribunal’s 2015 Interim
Decision.*°> According to Perenco, “[t]he Tribunal would not need to incorporate
inconsistent findings or in any way prejudice its Interim Decision”, but it would only decide

that the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims “has preclusive effect as of the time it

became res judicata.”*°

Perenco also takes issue with Ecuador’s supplementary request to the Tribunal to apply by
analogy Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention and analyse evidence that was not taken

into consideration by the Burlington tribunal.**’ Perenco argues that Article 51(1) of the

ICSID Convention does not allow “reviving a liability that has already been extinguished”

and, in any case, “such argument lies before the Burlington tribunal, not this one.”>°8

Perenco further contends that “even if this Tribunal were to find that some formal
requirement of the doctrine of res judicata is not met, the doctrine of abuse of process
would still apply.”°° According to Perenco, decisions of other tribunals support the view
that the doctrine of abuse of process precludes “pursuing duplicative claims for a dispute

that has already been resolved.”>!°

In its Reply, even though Perenco concedes the point that Ecuador had the right to
commence proceedings in multiple fora, it stresses that “it would be an abuse of that right
to continue to pursue those parallel proceedings after Ecuador has obtained full satisfaction
and payment.”>!! Furthermore, it claims that there is no support to Ecuador’s argument that
“abuse of process may only occur when multiple proceedings are brought between the same
parties.”>'? In addition, Perenco maintains that it is not necessary to establish that the “sole
purpose for continuing Ecuador’s counterclaims would be to harm Perenco.”>!? Perenco
suggests that multiplication of proceedings could also constitute an abuse of process when
it is done “for the purpose of evading a rule of law” or “in order to maximize its chances

of success.”>!4

Perenco, the approach proposed by Ecuador is conceptually inappropriate, because “the
Burlington tribunal awarded, and Burlington paid, the total amount of damages for the
entirety of the alleged harm.”>!® Moreover, Perenco suggests that the method proposed by
Ecuador would lead to double recovery and is technically not feasible.*!” In its Reply,

Perenco objects to Ecuador’s arguments for the same reasons.°!®

Perenco also rejects Ecuador’s objections to its request for an order of the Tribunal that
would hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental
and infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21.°!° Perenco denies that its request
would require this Tribunal to assume jurisdiction over third parties or subject-matters not
encompassed by Ecuador’s counterclaims.>”° It also rejects the contention that its request
is abusive.°7! Contrary to Ecuador’s allegation that the request is untimely, Perenco argues
that it sought a similar relief in its Rejoinder on the Counterclaims.*” In the alternative,

2. Ecuador’s Arguments

Ecuador requests the Tribunal to dismiss Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application for

several reasons.>7°

Ecuador argues that Perenco is barred from relying on its objections, because they are
untimely.°?’ Ecuador maintains that, according to ICSID Arbitration Rules 41(1), 26(3) and
27, “objections shall be made as early as possible; if not, the practice is to dismiss them
outright.”*8 Ecuador points out that Perenco should have invoked lis pendens when
Ecuador first introduced its counterclaims.>”? In Ecuador’s opinion, the fact that Perenco’s
objections were presented more than six years after the introduction of Ecuador’s
counterclaims should be considered a waiver of these objections.**° According to Ecuador,
Perenco is also precluded from requesting the dismissal of Ecuador’s counterclaims on
account of estoppel.>*! Ecuador argues that it relied on Perenco’s participation in the
counterclaims proceedings without raising any objections and, as a result, Ecuador
“invest[ed] considerable time and public funds to establish Perenco’s liability in the

understanding that it would be adjudicated by this Tribunal.”>*? In its Rejoinder, Ecuador

stresses that Perenco’s failure to raise lis pendens, request a stay of the proceedings or the

consolidation of the counterclaims is also abusive.°*?

Ecuador further contends that Perenco’s objections are barred on the ground of res judicata.
In particular, Ecuador claims that the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims is
incompatible with this Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim in which it made a
number of legal and factual determinations on Ecuador’s environmental counterclaim and

thus constitutes res judicata.*+ According to Ecuador, “holding that the Burlington

 

Decision on Counterclaims is res judicata would go against the widely established
principle that it is the first decision rendered on an issue that is res judicata.”**> Ecuador
further observes that these arguments have been espoused by the Tribunal in its previous

decisions.>*°

Ecuador submits that the finality of the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims does not

1,537

render its counterclaims moot as the requirements of res judicata are not met in this

case.>** Ecuador concedes that the Tribunal’s Decision on Perenco’s First Dismissal
Application found that that application was premature in light of the then-pending
annulment proceedings concerning the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims.>*
However, Ecuador stresses that the Tribunal only considered such proceedings “‘a bar to a

hypothetical argument...which the Tribunal only mentioned without approving it; namely,

that the case was moot.”*“°

Ecuador argues that neither Perenco nor the Consortium were parties to the Burlington

1

arbitration.**! Ecuador emphasises that Burlington and Perenco are legally and

economically independent entities.‘ According to Ecuador, “the party identity
requirement is applied strictly under both international law and Ecuadorian law”, so that
“privies in interest cannot be considered the same parties for the purposes of a res judicata

analysis.”

Ecuador claims in the alternative that Burlington and Perenco are not privies in interest,
since “privity only exists when one party owns the other.”** In its Rejoinder, Ecuador
emphasises that the three tribunals in Grynberg, Apotex III and Ampal-America — upon
whose decisions Perenco relies — “decided to extend the res judicata effect to the
shareholders on the basis that, as shareholders are entitled to claim for investments held
through a corporation under investment law, they must be bound by any previous finding
reached in relation to a claim of this corporation on the same facts.”*4> According to
Ecuador, this rationale cannot be extended to parties that share the same economic interest

in the outcome of a dispute as proposed by Perenco.*“°

Ecuador submits that there is no identity of subject-matter between these proceedings and
the Burlington proceedings. Ecuador notes in this respect a passage in the Burlington
Decision on Counterclaims in which that tribunal indicated that “it reache[d] a conclusion
different from that of the Perenco tribunal.”**" Ecuador observes that there are “material
differences in the evidentiary records before the Burlington tribunal and this Tribunal”
consisting of differences “in the evidence relied upon” and “in the witnesses as well as in
the questions put to the witnesses and experts during the hearings and the Burlington
tribunal’s site-visit where those experts and witnesses were the same.”>** Ecuador asserts

that “the different evidentiary record translated, in turn, into radically different approaches

by the tribunals.”>*? Ecuador draws the Tribunal’s attention, inter alia, to the fact that the
two tribunals “adopted distinct approaches as to how the extent of the contamination and
the obligation to remediate should be assessed.”°°° It also observes that the Burlington
tribunal decided to rely on party-appointed experts and a site visit, whereas the present
Tribunal decided to appoint its own independent environmental expert.*>! In its Rejoinder,
Ecuador contends that, contrary to Perenco’s claims, “when two separate tribunals analyze
different evidence presented in different manners, they do not consider the same facts and,

hence, they decide on different subject-matters.”°>

In the event that the Tribunal finds that the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims is final
and binding in the present proceedings, Ecuador requests the Tribunal to apply by analogy
Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention on revision of awards in order “to pursue its mission
and analyze the new evidence before it, which was not taken into consideration by the

Burlington tribunal when rendering [its] Decision.”**

In its Rejoinder, Ecuador stresses that the site-specific data and analytical results gathered
by Mr. MacDonald constitute a “new potentially decisive fact.”*>* Ecuador agrees with
Perenco that Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention would have entitled the Burlington
tribunal to revise its Decision on Counterclaims, but this rationale applies a fortiori before
this Tribunal while this arbitration is still pending.*°> Ecuador further argues that it would
be entitled to institute proceedings under Article 51(1) of the ICSID Convention, were this

Tribunal to uphold Perenco’s Application.*° To this end, Ecuador requests that

Mr. MacDonald’s Independent Expert Report be communicated to it, even if the Tribunal

ultimately accepts Perenco’s Application.**”

Ecuador rejects Perenco’s submission that its counterclaims constitute an abuse of process.
Ecuador contends that the doctrine of abuse of process is inapplicable in this case for
several reasons. First, Perenco should establish that the sole purpose of continuing
Ecuador’s counterclaims would be to harm Perenco or would be otherwise vexatious which
is not the case in the present proceedings.** Relying on the Lauder and Busta awards,
Ecuador asserts further that pursuing parallel proceedings with a view to maximising its
chances of success does not constitute an abuse of process.°°? Ecuador adds that the cases
cited by Perenco suggest that “the dispute must be brought by the same claimant against
the same respondent” for an abuse to be found.> In Ecuador’s view, the Orascom and
Ampal-American tribunals deemed that companies at different levels of the same
ownership chain were the same party, whereas the Eskosol tribunal’s approach was even
narrower, the tribunal holding that two companies of the same ownership chain were

distinct parties.*°!

Ecuador rejects Perenco’s claim that Ecuador’s counterclaims are moot, arguing that
Perenco’s reliance on mootness is inapposite because all the pronouncements cited by

Perenco related to cases “where specific performance is requested in order to prevent the

occurrence of harm and, either the harm occurred in the meantime, or the responding party

voluntarily complied.”>

Ecuador contends that Perenco’s liability is not extinguished under Ecuadorian law.>® In
its Rejoinder, Ecuador takes issue with Perenco’s argument that the quantification of
damages is a conceptually distinct issue from the existence of the liability itself.°*
According to Ecuador, “tort liability...depends on the extent of the harm suffered.”>®
Ecuador emphasises that the present Tribunal “is entrusted with determining the extent of
the harm to establish the extent of Perenco’s liability” in contrast to the Burlington tribunal

whose mandate was limited to the determination of the extent of Burlington’s liability.*

In Ecuador’s view, the notion of mutual representation is alien to the Ecuadorian joint and
several liability legal regime.*°” Ecuador claims that it was entitled to sue Burlington,
Perenco, or both.*° Furthermore, Ecuador suggests that the non-extinction of Perenco’s
debt can be inferred from the fact that the victim/creditor can commence one or several

proceedings against its co-debtors under Ecuadorian law.>

In its Rejoinder, Ecuador maintains that Perenco’s reliance on the Ecuadorian joint and
several liability regime is misplaced, since the effect of full payment by one co-debtor with
respect to the other co-debtors is not disputed.°”? According to Ecuador, the issue is
“whether the first-in-time decision of one tribunal is or is not binding on the other tribunal
and renders or does not render the second-in-time proceedings moot...when parallel

proceedings are commenced and pursued against different co-authors.”°”! In this respect,

Ecuador reiterates that this Tribunal has established its own criteria for the determination
of the extent of damage for which Perenco will be held liable and the fact that the both
proceedings have materially different evidentiary records.*”? It also points out that the
Burlington Settlement Agreement does not envisage the termination of the Perenco
proceedings by providing, inter alia, that Ecuador will not seek double recovery in these

proceedings.*”?

Ecuador places particular emphasis on a provision of the Ecuadorian Civil Code which
stipulates that “[a] settlement is binding between its signatories only. Where there are
several co-debtors who may have an interest in the settlement, the settlement made by one
of them cannot be enforced by or against the others, except where there is novation and the
underlying obligation is joint and several.”°’+ Ecuador submits that Perenco is not bound
by the Burlington proceedings nor by the Burlington settlement.*” In its Rejoinder,
Ecuador adds that the Burlington Settlement Agreement cannot benefit Perenco, because
“[fJor a settlement to exist, the parties must make reciprocal concessions.”>’® In particular,
Ecuador alleges that “the set off of the damages awarded against Burlington for the
environmental and infrastructure harms” was part of a larger settlement including a
discount to the amount owed by Ecuador as a result of the Burlington award and the

termination of the Burlington proceedings.*”

Ecuador also requests the Tribunal to dismiss Perenco’s request to offset the entirety of
Burlington’s payment from any counterclaims’ damages awarded by the Tribunal. Whilst
Ecuador agrees to avoid double recovery, it maintains that Perenco’s approach is flawed.>’8
According to Ecuador, “[t]he risk of double recovery can only materialize. ..if the Tribunal

finds exactly the ‘same harm’ as the one identified and quantified by the Burlington tribunal

pursuant to its own (different) interpretation of the legal framework and technical
methods.”>”? Ecuador suggests that “‘[s]ame loss’ (or ‘same harm’ in the circumstances)
requires that both tribunals assess the object of the underlying obligation in an identical

manner.”°8°

Ecuador does not dispute that some part of the harm could be the same as that identified by
the Burlington tribunal, but argues that it remains entitled to claim for “any...different or
additional harm and/or costs with respect to the environment and infrastructure in Blocks
7 and 21.”°*! Ecuador contends that Perenco remains liable for any additional and/or
different volumes of soil, mud pits, and groundwater contamination warranting remediation
and/or additional remediation costs in Blocks 7 and 21.°*? With respect to infrastructure
harm, Ecuador claims that Perenco remains liable for any additional item and/or additional

cost identified in Blocks 7 and 21.°*

In its Rejoinder, Ecuador defends the technical feasibility of its approach. It stresses that
Perenco did not challenge the feasibility of Ecuador’s approach with respect to the
infrastructure counterclaim.>** With respect to its environmental counterclaim, Ecuador
further argues that its approach can be applied where Mr. MacDonald finds contamination
in clearly distinct areas or sites from that identified by the Burlington tribunal or where the
depth of contamination can be discerned through a comparison between Mr. MacDonald’s
findings with respect to the contaminated area and the Burlington tribunal’s findings with
respect to the volume to be remediated.**° Ecuador also proposes that in the cases where
the exact shape of the contaminated area is not delineated in the Burlington Decision on

Counterclaims, the Tribunal “could compare abstract square meters of contamination (not

monetary damages) found at the same depth, deduct the overlap, and apply the remediation

Ecuador further requests the Tribunal to reject Perenco’s request for an order that “Ecuador
hold Perenco harmless against any future claims based on alleged environmental and
infrastructure liability arising out of Blocks 7 and 21, before any jurisdiction
whatsoever.”**” Ecuador maintains that this request is unrelated to the application, because
“[w]hether or not Ecuador’s counterclaims must be dismissed in the present arbitration
does not have any consequences on, or relationships with, potential future claims against
Perenco, including by third parties, based on environmental and infrastructure liability
arising out of Blocks 7 and 21.”>** Ecuador contends that Perenco is barred for presenting
such a request at this phase of the proceedings, since it has not previously sought the
authorisation of the Tribunal in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 40(2).°° Ecuador
emphasises that Perenco cannot invoke any special circumstance for its belated
presentation of this request for relief.°°° It adds that Perenco’s request for relief is
unfounded, because Ecuador cannot assume responsibility for claims that may arise from
third parties.*°! For the same reason, Ecuador submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction
to grant such an order.**? Ecuador argues that this request is also abusive, because it is
inconsistent with the other requests formulated in Perenco’s Second Dismissal

Application.>°
In its Response, Ecuador requests the Tribunal to:

“(a) Dismiss Perenco’s Second Application;

(b) Dismiss Perenco’s alternative requests for relief;

3. Tribunal’s Reasons for Rejecting Perenco’s Second Dismissal
Application
486. As noted above, the Tribunal, by a majority, rejected Perenco’s Second Dismissal

Application. The reasons are as follows.

487. The Second Dismissal Application raises issues of both Ecuadorian and international law.
The latter argue in favour of the Tribunal’s continuing the counterclaim proceeding. As for
the former, a review of the Parties’ submissions shows that the position under Ecuadorian

law is not as clear-cut as Perenco has contended.

The Tribunal begins by recalling that it held in the Decision on Reconsideration that its
prior decisions are res judicata and cannot be re-opened.*”° This finding applies with equal
force to the Interim Decision on Counterclaim; the Tribunal cannot reopen and reconsider

its findings, either explicitly or implicitly.

Among the Tribunal’s (explicit and implicit) findings in the Interim Decision on
Counterclaim and the Decision on Perenco’s First Dismissal Application were the

following:

(a) The Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain the counterclaim against Perenco even

though a similar counterclaim was on track in the Burlington proceeding;>””

(b) the counterclaim was not inadmissible;>”*

(c) the Tribunal decided with finality a number of issues pertaining to the interpretation

of the Ecuadorian Constitution and the applicable environmental regulations and

recommended that the Parties settle the dispute;>?

Decision on Reconsideration, paragraph 43: “There is ample prior authority in support of the view once the
tribunal decides with finality any of the factual or legal questions put to it by the parties, as was the case in
the Decision on Liability, such a decision becomes res judicata.”

Id., paragraphs 43 and 51.

Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 593: “Having regard to the Tribunal’s findings in relation to:
(i) background values; (ii) the temporal application of the 2008 Constitution to the facts of this case; (iii) the
applicable standards under Ecuadorian law; (iv) the 2008 Constitution’s variation of the limitations period;
(v) the Tribunal’s criticism of the narrowness of GSI’s sampling practices; (vi) the Tribunal’s rejection of
IEMS’ mapping and unit costs for remediation; and (vii) the fact the Tribunal will not permit the sampling
of areas in the Blocks which were not previously sampled by either party’s experts, the Tribunal believes that
the remaining issues are most unlikely to lead to an award of damages anywhere near the amount claimed by
Ecuador. The Parties will doubtless take all this into account as well as the considerable cost of the further
enquiry which the Tribunal considers is absolutely necessary to arrive at a just result in the circumstances of
this case in deciding whether it is possible for them to arrive at a mutually satisfactory resolution of this
aspect of the dispute.”

(d) the Tribunal did not find the expert evidence adduced by both Parties sufficiently

reliable and accepted Perenco’s argument that it would not be appropriate to ‘pick

and choose’ between the experts in order to fashion relief,

(e) the Tribunal refused to reject the claim on the basis of a failure to discharge the
burden of proof, holding instead that in light of the Constitution’s strong interest in
environmental protection and in the interest of a just and fair result it would appoint
an independent expert if the Parties were unable to negotiate a settlement. The

Tribunal stated that it considered such “further enquiry [to be] absolutely necessary

to arrive at a just result in the circumstances of this case”;°!

(f) it also explicitly instructed that: “If an agreement is not reached, the Tribunal will

await the results of its expert’s work and make a final decision which will be included

in the Award”;®°? and

(g) finally, the Tribunal stated, without qualification, that the Independent Expert Report

would be disclosed to the Parties.

Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 585: “...the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that given the present
state of the evidence it should not ‘take as its task picking and choosing between the experts on each issue
one by one, cafeteria-style’ — because the Tribunal does not po: the requisite technical expertise to decide
between experts’ disagreements over highly technical issues — it is equally uncomfortable with simply picking
one set of experts’ conclusions over the other. The Tribunal well understands that the onus of proof is on a
party who makes an allegation and it could be said that because of the doubt in which the Tribunal finds itself
Ecuador could be said to have failed in tipping the burden in its favor. However, as the Tribunal is satisfied
that there has been some damage for which it seems likely that Perenco is liable, the Tribunal is not disposed
to dismiss the counterclaim in limine. Given the Constitution's embrace of the importance of the protection
of the environment, the most accurate picture of the environmental condition of the Blocks possible — based
on the prior sampling locations of both IEMS and GSI — must inform the Tribunal’s decision on the
counterclaim.”

Having failed to arrive at a negotiated settlement, the Parties jointly agreed on
Mr. MacDonald’s suitability as the Independent Expert and the Tribunal accepted their

joint proposal. The Tribunal then instructed him on how to conduct his sampling.

(a) The international law analysis

From the foregoing, it can be seen that the Tribunal faces two rei judicatae: (i) ) a decision
rendered in this proceeding, which on the basis of the logic of the Decision on
Reconsideration, and on general principle, is binding on Perenco and Ecuador; and (ii) a
decision rendered in a parallel proceeding after the present Tribunal rendered its own
Interim Decision on Counterclaim (that other decision being binding on Burlington and
Ecuador). Perenco now requests that this Tribunal declare that the Ecuador-Burlington
settlement following the Burlington award is binding upon the Parties to this proceeding.
Perenco essentially contends that a res judicata created by a different tribunal, after this
Tribunal had spoken, which award was subsequently reflected in a settlement between the

parties to that dispute, overrides the res judicata created by the present Tribunal.
There are a number of troubling aspects to this argument.

First, from the standpoint of an international tribunal’s duty to exercise its jurisdiction once
established™, it seems counter-intuitive that a tribunal that has made certain findings of
law and fact and has decided that a particular course of action must be followed because of
the infirmities of the expert evidence before it must be bound by the later finding of another
tribunal considering similar issues (based on a different evidential record and in some cases
deciding differently from this Tribunal) and which was less troubled by the infirmities in

the expert evidence.

One can reasonably ask why the res judicata represented by the Interim Decision on
Counterclaim of this Tribunal must yield to the res judicata of a later-in-time decision

rendered by another tribunal that chose a different means of estimating the damage suffered

by Ecuador (and which, when rendering its award, declined to give effect to this Tribunal’s

prior decision).

Second, the Tribunal sees the force in Ecuador’s argument that given the procedure which
the Tribunal previously laid down and which was being followed in the present case, were
the Tribunal to accept the Burlington award as being a final disposition of the counterclaim,
it would essentially be re-opening its Interim Decision on Counterclaim and grafting on to
it reasons and findings made by another tribunal which are inconsistent with this Tribunal’ s

own prior findings.®°

Thus, from the perspective of a de-centralised international legal regime in which
investment treaties confer jurisdiction over ad hoc tribunals which in turn have jurisdiction
only over the parties to the disputes brought before them, and where it is accepted that
different tribunals considering similar matters can arrive at different conclusions, in the
Tribunal’s view, by the time of Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application it was far too late
to turn off the process which the Tribunal had ordered to be conducted and which was

nearing its completion.

Third, the only party which has sought to treat the Burlington Decision on Counterclaim as
having res judicata and preclusive effect on the continued prosecution of the present
counterclaim is Perenco. Likewise, the only party that characterises the Burlington
Settlement Agreement as bringing the environmental and infrastructure counterclaims to
an end is Perenco, a non-party to that agreement. The 2011 agreement on the counterclaim
between Burlington and Ecuador, the Burlington Decision, and the Burlington-Ecuador
Settlement Agreement do not purport to hold that the Consortium’s liability was

definitively and finally determined by that tribunal’s decision.

Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 581: “The Tribunal has set out the main issues of fact and law
which have divided the experts. However, with regard to many of the IEMS/GSI differences, the Tribunal
does not feel able to prefer one above the other. It seems to the Tribunal that each was attempting to achieve
the best result for the party by whom they were instructed, and that they crossed the boundary between
professional objective analysis and party representation. It is clear to the Tribunal that the experts were
effectively shooting at different targets and this has made the work of this Tribunal most difficult.” [Emphasis
added.]

(b) Ecuadorian law on the effect of the Settlement Agreement and Annex 3 on
Perenco’s liability
The Ecuadorian law issue concerns the effect of the Ecuador-Burlington Settlement

Agreement and its Annex 3 on Perenco’s liability to Ecuador under Ecuadorian law.

The stated purpose of Annex 3 to the Settlement Agreement was to amongst other things
ensure that Ecuador does not receive double recovery for the same damage/harm through
the counterclaims against Perenco in the Perenco arbitration. The Settlement Agreement
also explicitly contemplated certain relationships between the Burlington settlement and

the ongoing Perenco arbitration and the implications of the former for the latter.

In the Tribunal’s view, the Settlement Agreement shows that the parties thereto did not
intend for that agreement to affect the prosecution of the Perenco environmental
counterclaim, except to the extent that Burlington secured Ecuador’s agreement not to
pursue it for additional damages and not to seek double recovery for those damages which

were paid pursuant to the Agreement.

The “fairness” argument advanced by Perenco, namely, that Burlington would not have
truly achieved a “full and final settlement and release” from the counterclaims because it
continues to bear exposure to damages on the counterclaims if this Tribunal were to order
a larger quantum of damages, is undermined by the fact that no attempt was made by
Burlington or Ecuador to vary Burlington’s JOAs with Perenco. Without Perenco’s
consent, it was not open to the other two parties to attempt to change the terms of the JOAs,
specifically the contribution provision. Perenco therefore stands in the same position now
as it was in before the Burlington-Ecuador settlement, namely, Perenco has the contractual
right to call upon Burlington to assume its aliquot share of any damages ultimately awarded

by this Tribunal.

While Perenco relies on its joint and several liability with Burlington to argue that the
Settlement Agreement discharges its own liability, it appears that under Article 2363 of the
Ecuadorian Civil Code, Perenco cannot enforce the Settlement Agreement against Ecuador.

That article reads:

170

503.

504.

505.

606

607

608

“A settlement is binding between its signatories only. Where there are
several who may have an interest in the settlement, the settlement made
by one of them cannot be enforced by or against the others, except where
there is a novation and the underlying obligation is joint and several.”°

Ecuador explains that, by virtue of this provision, the civil law notion of mutual
representation does not apply. This means that a debtor (i.e. Perenco) would be not able to
rely on a settlement entered into by the creditor with another co-debtor (i.e. Burlington).

The Settlement Agreement is binding between Ecuador and Burlington only.

Perenco seeks to read Article 2363 of the Ecuadorian Civil Code restrictively. It appears to
argue that the provision only addresses situations where joint debtors to settle their own
share of a joint and several liability and provides that such a settlement would be binding
between its signatories only.” It therefore argues that the provision is inapplicable here
because Ecuador did not settle Burlington’s aliquot share of the environmental harm with
Ecuador. Rather, Burlington paid Ecuador full reparation for the environmental harm
Ecuador claimed against the Consortium. In this regard, Perenco relies on (in addition to
its own pleadings in relation to its First Dismissal Application and the Second Dismissal
Application) the recitals in the Settlement Agreement and the Burlington Decision on

Counterclaims.*

Perenco’s argument can be addressed on two levels: first, whether Burlington and Ecuador
settled the whole of the Consortium’s joint and several liability in such a way as to bind
Ecuador towards Perenco under Article 2363 of the Civil Code; and second, whether as a
matter of Ecuadorian law, Article 2363 of the Civil Code operates in the way that Perenco
contends. With respect to the first issue, the Tribunal considers that it is addressed by the
language in the Settlement Agreement which discusses the limits of that agreement, its
relationship to the dispositif of the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims, and that award’s

relationship in turn to the ongoing Perenco arbitration.

509.

While it is indeed the case that Ecuador was making “a full claim for the alleged
environmental harm in each of the Burlington and Perenco cases”, the Burlington tribunal
clearly contemplated that the present Tribunal could come to a different conclusion on the
quantum of damages and left it to this Tribunal to fashion its decision to prevent double

recovery by Ecuador. The Settlement Agreement itself recognises this state of affairs.

In the Tribunal’s view, the parties to the Settlement Agreement intended that the Burlington
decision was determinative of the liability owed by Burlington to Ecuador, but not

determinative of the entirety of the environmental harm caused to Ecuador more generally.

This appears to accord with the notion of tortious liability in the Ecuadorian civil law
system. In this regard, the Tribunal accepts Ecuador’s submission that the notion of tortious
liability in the civil law system is significantly different from that in the common-law
system. Unlike the common law, which looks for the existence of a relationship between
the tortfeasor and the victim (such as to establish the existence of a duty of care, breach of
which leads to liability), the civil law system is more concerned with whether damage has
been caused by a person’s act(s). If damage occurs, tortious liability follows (without any
inquiry as to whether the parties were in a particular relationship such that tortious liability
could arise). Thus, Ecuador’s explanation, which emphasises the civil law’s preoccupation
with the occurrence of damage, supports the Tribunal’s continued determination of the full
extent of the contamination (subject, of course, to the restrictions laid down for the work
of the Independent Expert). Ecuador has argued that the Burlington tribunal almost
certainly did not accurately estimate the extent of the contamination. (As shall be seen, the
expert opinion of Mr. MacDonald supports this view.) Given that situation, a failure to
properly estimate the damage would mean that the victim of the tortious conduct would be

under-compensated.

The Tribunal considers further that the Burlington tribunal, comprising three distinguished
civil law-trained arbitrators, could be taken to be familiar with the civil law system’s
approach towards tortious liability. The members of that tribunal did not evince any
concern in proceeding independently to decide the Burlington counterclaim even though

their decision was rendered after this Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim, and

172

despite the fact that the Consortium operator (Perenco) was not before them. Moreover,
instead of declaring that they were determining the whole of the Consortium’s liability, the
Burlington tribunal explicitly left it to the present tribunal to address any risk of double

recovery:

“69. The Tribunal is mindful of the separate nature of the two
arbitrations and of its duty to resolve the dispute before it solely on its own
record and merits. This said, the Tribunal is also mindful of the risk of
double recovery, to which it will revert, and of the potential risk of
contradictory decisions. For reasons linked to the value of coherence of
the legal system, it considers that contradictory decisions on identical
issues should be avoided to the degree possible without sacrificing any
party’s rights of due process or fairness. While ruling on the basis of the
record in this case exclusively, the Tribunal will refer to the Perenco
Decision in those instances where, in spite of the desire to avoid
contradictions, it reaches a conclusion different from that of the Perenco
tribunal.

70. As regards the risk of double recovery (item (iv) above), Ecuador
does not dispute that it seeks what Burlington calls “identical overlapping
compensation with regard to the same alleged damage” in both
proceedings. It also agrees that there is a risk of double recovery. This
being so, at the end of the Hearing, Ecuador explained that it does not
intend to recover its claimed damages twice, but that it will rely on
whichever decision proves to be more favorable to its position. Burlington,
on its part, requested that the Tribunal expressly address the risk of double
recovery, such that “if the dispositive part of either of the awards on
counterclaims provides for any compensation, Ecuador would be
prevented from enforcing the second award to the extent that it has already
been compensated by the first”. The Tribunal addresses double recovery
below (Section D).”°” [Emphasis added.]

Therefore, based on the above, the Tribunal finds that the Settlement Agreement could only
have been intended to settle what the Burlington tribunal thought was the damage suffered
by Ecuador (subject to intra-Consortium claims under the JOAs which apply as between

the two Consortium partners and, crucially, subject to what this Tribunal would decide).

Turning to the second issue, it is difficult to read Article 2363 in the manner which Perenco
contends when the provision does not state that it applies only to partial settlements. In any

event, the fact of the settlement by one party that is jointly and severally liable with one or

Ibid., paragraphs 69-70.

173

512.

513.

more others does not in and of itself permit a non-settling party to plead the settlement. By
its own terms, Article 2363 requires not only a relationship of joint and several liability,
but also a novation of the settlement agreement. Thus, on a plain reading of that provision,
Perenco can claim the benefit of Settlement Agreement only if there has been a novation
and the underlying liability is joint and several.°'° There is no allegation that the Ecuador-
Burlington Settlement Agreement has been novated to the benefit of Perenco. Indeed, the
terms of the Settlement Agreement are explicitly to the contrary in that the rights and

benefits of the settlement are expressly limited to the parties thereto.

Finally, the Burlington tribunal expressly recognised “its duty to resolve the dispute before
it solely on its own record and merits” while the Perenco proceeding continued.°!! This
point, with which the Tribunal agrees, has particular salience because of the fundamentally
different approaches taken by the two tribunals on the environmental counterclaim. The
Burlington tribunal decided to conduct a site visit and to rely upon the expert evidence of
TEMS and GSI, picking and choosing between their respective findings on individual items.
This Tribunal believes that its Independent Expert is in a better position to provide a more
technically-sound and more rigorous evaluation of the conditions in the sites than what can
be obtained through a site visit. Nor was it willing to rely upon the reports produced by the
Parties’ experts without their data and findings being evaluated and confirmed (or not) by

an independent expert.

Accordingly, the Tribunal has dismissed Perenco’s Second Dismissal Application®!? and it

now turns to the work of the Independent Expert.

Response, paragraph 100.

Mr. Kaplan cannot agree with the majority on this conclusion. He considers that on its true interpretation the
Settlement Agreement between Burlington and Ecuador releases the other co-contractor, namely Perenco.

The Independent Expert’s Work
1. Mr. MacDonald’s Qualifications

The Tribunal noted above at paragraph 47 that after the Parties were unable to negotiate a
settlement of the environmental counterclaim, they jointly agreed on the appointment of
Mr. Scott MacDonald as the Tribunal’s Independent Expert. Mr. MacDonald’s
qualifications are set out in his Independent Expert’s Report and they are not repeated here.
Suffice to say that he has some 30 years of experience in advising corporate clients,
conducting risk-based multimedia investigations and remediation under various federal,
state and local regulatory programmes on a global basis; performing different types of
environmental assessments, and providing expert witness testimony in litigations and
arbitrations on, among other things, the performance or non-performance of environmental
obligations, defences against claims for primary restoration and compensatory damages for
groundwater in natural resource damages litigation; private-party cost-recovery actions as
related to the source, distribution, and fate of soil sediment and groundwater contamination;
underground storage tanks; cost recovery actions under US legislation, and insurance
coverage disputes. Much of his work has involved the oil sector.°!? Finally, although he
had not previously worked in Ecuador, Mr. MacDonald has experience working throughout

much of Latin America.

2. Scope of the Independent Expert Report
On 19 December 2018, Mr. MacDonald issued his Independent Expert Report. He

confirmed that he was and remained independent of the Parties and also confirmed that the

scope of his work was bound by the Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim.°'*

The following partial summary of the Independent Expert Report is included to set out the
Independent Expert’s description of his work, his findings, and prescriptions for
remediation so as to provide the requisite context for the Tribunal’s discussion of the

Parties’ comments and criticisms of the Independent Expert Report and the Tribunal’s

Independent Expert Report, p. 2.

findings thereon. The following summary of the Independent Expert Report is merely that;
no inference should be drawn from the Tribunal’s attempt to extract and reproduce here
what it considers to be the most salient points made by the Independent Expert. The Report
stands as a whole and is the authoritative statement of the Independent Expert’s views, as
supplemented by his presentation and testimony given during the course of the Expert

Hearing.

Mr. MacDonald began by describing his mandate as to resolve certain key issues bearing
on the extent, if any, of compensable environmental contamination in Blocks 7 and 21 as
determined in accordance with the Tribunal’s findings set out in its Interim Decision on

Counterclaim and the Tribunal’s clarifications of his mandate.

In order to do so, he first reviewed what the Parties’ experts had done, identified what he
considered to be significant data gaps that required resolution, and to the extent that he
found contamination in the sampling conducted at sites that had previously been identified
by one or both of the Parties’ experts as being contaminated, estimated the remediation cost
based on the Tribunal’s finding that in-country cost estimates should be employed.°!> His
Independent Expert Report describes the documentary material provided to him by the
Tribunal and the Parties.°'© This was supplemented by visits to representative sites during
November 2016 and again during field work performed in the fall of 2017.°!’ Finally, under
his direction, Ramboll generated independent data and analyses to close significant data
gaps in the investigation of soils, and generated a technically valid data set to replace prior
groundwater data gathered by the Parties. Ramboll also conducted work needed to
document the compliance status of mud pits previously used by Perenco with applicable

Ecuadorian regulations.°!® Mr. MacDonald described how his samples were taken, how

they were handled, and where they were shipped in order to be analysed by a qualified

laboratory.°!?

Mr. MacDonald stated that his intent was to supplement the existing work performed by

the Parties’ experts in conservative compliance with Ecuador’s laws and regulations so as

to establish a more reliable technical platform to support the Tribunal’s decision in this

matter. As instructed by the Tribunal, his technical work was limited to:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

621

Investigation at sites at which: (i) soil contamination was identified by one or both
Parties above applicable Ecuador regulatory remediation criteria; (ii) groundwater was
previously investigated by the Parties; and (iii) mud pits determined to have been used

by Perenco were present;

For soils, investigation was limited to areas previously assessed by one or both Parties,
where existing data were insufficient to develop a technically valid remediation cost

estimate;

For groundwater, investigation was limited to sites where groundwater sampling had
previously been conducted by the Parties, but where more technically sound
investigation methodologies were needed. Mr. MacDonald’s work was intended to
confirm the presence or absence of groundwater contamination at these sites utilising
more advanced and accepted well installation and sampling methods. The delineation
of groundwater contamination was not requested by the Tribunal and was outside the

scope of this effort; and

For mud pits, investigation was limited to mud pits that were determined to have been

used during Perenco’s operations.

Mr. MacDonald considered that his work was sufficient to significantly narrow the range
of potential environmental cleanup costs at the site. While some uncertainties remained, he

622

stated that he had sought to reduce the degree of these uncertainties.°~~ He considered that

his engineering cost estimates are both locally implementable and technically viable.

The Independent Expert Report was transmitted to the Parties for their review and
comment. The paragraphs that follow are intended to provide a summary of the points made

in the Independent Expert Report.

3. Assessment of Baseline Information

Mr. MacDonald confirmed the Tribunal’s view that despite the work conducted by the
Parties’ experts, considerable uncertainty regarding site conditions remained, and in his
opinion, this was largely attributable to the differing philosophical purposes of the experts’
work as well as their technical approaches to obtaining and processing data. His

Independent Expert Report identified the most significant issues as follows.

The Parties’ experts took different approaches to their analyses. In his view, IEMS
attempted to mirror what he called an “ASTM-type due diligence process”, through which
potential areas of environmental concern could be identified by means of reviewing
documentation provided by the Parties or other sources of information; interviews with

representatives of the Parties

 

site personnel with knowledge of historical site activities
(currently with Petroamazonas) and local community members; and site inspections.
Follow-up sampling was conducted in selected areas to assess whether contamination was

present in areas previously identified as RECs.° Where it did identify contamination

Id.

ASTM (E 1527-05, as cited by IEMS) defines a REC as “The presence or likely presence of any hazardous
substances or petroleum products on a property under conditions that indicate an existing release, a past
release, or a material threat of a release of any hazardous substances or petroleum products into structures
on the property or into the ground, ground water, or surface water of the property. The term includes
hazardous substances or petroleum products even under conditions in compliance with laws. The term is not
intended to include de minimis conditions that generally do not present a threat to human health or the
environment and that generally would not be the subject of an enforcement action if brought to the attention
of appropriate governmental agencies. Conditions determined to be de minimis are not recognized
environmental conditions.”

(defined by IEMS as being above its base values), modeling of the data gathered via the

IDW method was then conducted to derive an estimate the extent of contamination.©*

GSI’s work, on the other hand, was intended to test the validity of IEMS’ findings. GSI
conducted its own site inspections to confirm and/or identify new areas of potential impact,
conducted further characterisation activities with respect to ground water, and used soil
contamination delineation techniques, as well as human health risk assessment tools, to
evaluate IEMS’ findings. GSI’s efforts were, in Mr. MacDonald’s view, more like a
remedial investigation, in which delineation of limited and previously identified areas of

contamination was conducted.

Mr. MacDonald concluded that in the case of both experts, the “technical choices made by
the Parties, intended or not, embedded biases within their findings”:°* IEMS significantly
overestimated actual contamination at the sites while GSI underestimated it.° This

accorded with the Tribunal’s own view expressed in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim.

This resulted in incomplete site characterisation as well as radically different conclusions.
Mr. MacDonald discussed how this affected the experts’: (i) site investigation practices
(discussed in the Report at Section 2.5.2); (ii) data evaluation techniques (discussed in the
Report at Section 2.5.4); and (iii) cost estimation approaches (discussed in the Report at

Section 2.5.5).

In order to evaluate these methods and the results that they generated, Mr. MacDonald
reviewed the Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim and distilled the key findings
which bore on the applicable Ecuadorian environmental standards to be applied. His
summary of the relevant findings is contained in his Independent Expert Report at

Section 3.

He also took note of the Tribunal’s findings on the changes effected to the Ecuadorian legal
regime insofar as the Constitution’s changes to the fault-based liability regime was

concerned, 27

4, The Land Use Issue

Mr. MacDonald noted that the Tribunal rejected Ecuador’s assertion that natural
background conditions were required to be met as a remediation objective at the sites and
therefore provided direction on which numerical criteria should be applied. In the case of
soils, such criteria depend on the land use of the area being evaluated. The basis for

determining land use and the criteria used to classify land use are described below.

(a) Land Use Designations

Neither RAOHE nor TULAS provided clear guidance as how best to identify the applicable
land use criteria for any particular site. GSI evaluated 20 remediation projects at oil fields
in the Oriente operated by Petroecuador, Petroproduccién, and other operators, which
showed that in 80-90% of cases reviewed, the agricultural land use criteria were generally

applied.°?*

GSI considered that IEMS had applied the ‘sensitive ecosystem’ criteria too broadly.
RAOHE defines the sensitive ecosystem criteria as “maximum permitted concentrations
aimed for the protection of sensitive ecosystems such as National Heritage Natural
Protected Areas and other identified in the corresponding site-specific Environmental

Assessment.” These are further described as follows:

(i) National Heritage Natural Protected Areas — Under Articles 66 and 67 of the
Forest and Natural Areas and Wildlife Conservation Law or “LFCANVS” (Ley
Forestal y de Conservacion de Areas Naturales y Vida Silvestre) certain areas are

expressly designated and mapped for protection due to their flora and fauna or their

Ibid., point 5 of Section 1.6.1.
Ibid., fn. 112.

180

532.

533.

constituting ecosystems that contribute to the maintenance of ecological
equilibrium.°” Boundaries for these protected areas include or are in the immediate
vicinity of the Payamino 1/CPF, Payamino 2/8, Payamino 4 and 14/20/24, Payamino

18, Payamino 19, Payamino 23, Waponi-Ocatoe, and Nemoca platforms.°*°

(ii) Environmental Assessment - Under RAOHE, Article 33, indicates that
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIS) may include inter alia an Environmental
Diagnosis — Base Line (Estudio de Impacto Ambiental inclusive el Diagnéstico
Ambiental - Linea Base), which is defined under the Environmental Management
Law (Ley de Gestién Ambiental as a technical administrative procedure which seeks
to determine beforehand the environmental viability of a project, construction

activity, or private or public activity.

Pursuant to RAOHE Article 3.1, the Environmental Diagnosis — Base Line, where
available, would be an appropriate resource to identify site-specific sensitive areas. Article
Al, section 3.2.2, of the RAOHE requires the identification of land ecosystems, vegetative
cover, flora and fauna, aquatic or marine ecosystems, sensitive areas, unique flora and
fauna specimens, endangered or in danger species, and potential threats to the ecosystem.

No further guidance is provided regarding sensitive ecosystems.°*!

(b) Selected Criteria for Classifying Land Use

Mr. MacDonald found that for most of the subject sites, baseline assessments were either
unavailable or did not provide sufficient information to determine whether the site was
located in a sensitive ecosystem.” He took note of the Tribunal’s finding that, given the

importance of the rainforest ecosystem, one should err on the side of the most protective

criteria. For purposes of evaluating sampling results, he therefore applied the following

guidelines:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

The land uses identified within the Interim Decision on Counterclaim and documents
provided by the Parties were reviewed. In most cases, Ramboll’s observations were
generally consistent with those of the Parties. Ramboll relied on its own observations
rather than documentation presented by others; however, Mr. MacDonald stated, in
no case was a conflict between Ramboll’s observations and the determination of an

Ecuadorian authority identified.

Industrial criteria applied within the boundaries of existing platforms or CPFs that
contain processing equipment, operating wells, or dormant wells that could be
returned to service. Operating areas containing other in-use infrastructure (such as
waste transfer stations, soil treatment areas, power oil pumping stations) were also
considered to be industrial. The areas of these platforms are generally defined by

fencing and/or perimeter collection trenches.

Soils that are not situated on platforms were considered to be potentially accessible
to the public, livestock, and wildlife. Such areas were therefore subject to more
stringent, non-industrial criteria (i.e., sensitive ecosystem/ residential or agricultural).
For mud pits located outside of the platform limits, the upper 30 centimeters of
material were assumed to be bio-available and considered to have the same land uses
as neighboring soils. Commercial criteria were generally not applicable to the sites

and are not considered in his work.

Agricultural criteria would apply within cleared areas, open pastures, or areas that
were under active cultivation. The agricultural criteria would also apply to areas

clearly used for animal grazing.

IDEC, paragraph 495.

182

534.

535.

536.

(e) Residential and sensitive ecosystem criteria would apply to all other lands, including:
(i) Designated parks and preservation lands;
(ii) Residential properties;

(iii) | Primary forests, secondary forests, and open pastures that do not appear to be
heavily used by livestock;

(iv) | Formerly cultivated lands that are fallow, or lands that contain both native
and infilled crops, and/or native plants that are harvested; and

(v) Former platforms that have been abandoned or are designated for closure.©*

The very broad applicability of the sensitive ecosystem criteria was intended to best
facilitate restoration of lands that might have been affected by oil extraction activities, but
are protected under Ecuador’s 2008 Constitution. This application also was also considered

to be responsive to the local residents’ dependency upon the natural environment for food.

Where individual parameters were found naturally at concentrations exceeding the most
stringent applicable criteria (either agricultural or sensitive ecosystem/residential), then in
accordance with Ecuador’s regulations, the “background criteria” would apply (see the
further discussion in Section 3.1.2.1 and Appendix C to the Tribunal’s Independent Expert

Report).°>

5. Remediation Standards

The remediation standards applicable to soil, mud pits and groundwater are defined in
TULAS and RAOHE. In the case of soils, published remediation criteria are defined based
on the specific land use of the area investigated and consider the development of

background criteria where baseline conditions indicate the natural presence of regulated

at Section 3.2 of the Independent Expert Report.

(a) Indicator Parameters

Earlier in the proceeding, Perenco’s expert, GSI, contended that the only reliable
parameters that could be used to assess the impact of oilfield operations are TPH (crude
oil), barium (drilling mud), and soil electrical conductivity (produced water). “The
presence of other chemicals in the soil, in the absence of a primary indicator (e.g. nickel
in the absence of elevated barium or TPH) cannot be caused by an oil field material and
was therefore not retained for further investigation.”*° GSY’s contaminant delineation
methodology reflected this opinion; heavy metals that were not also found in the presence
of an indicator compound were not identified as contaminants requiring further delineation

and/or remedy and were not investigated.

In Mr. MacDonald’s view, TPH, barium, and conductivity are useful indicators that, where
elevated, suggest a potential impact on the environment resulting from petroleum
operations. However, heavy metals may also be associated with well drilling operations,
crude oil extraction and/or with formation water management. While Perenco asserted that
its formation waters were reinjected, the potential exists for this material to have been
discharged during its storage, conveyance and management. Therefore, the presence of
heavy metals in soils at levels above background due to petroleum operations could not be
entirely discounted. That said, where metals were found in absence of barium or TPH,
special attention was considered to be merited to assess whether the detections are more

likely to be attributable to oilfield activities or to natural background conditions.™°

(b) Conductivity and pH

Mr. MacDonald concurred with IEMS and GSI that there was limited utility in using
conductivity or pH as parameters to determine the presence or extent of contaminated soils.
Electrical conductivity and pH were included in the assessment of mud pit materials (as

required by RAOHE).™!

7. Analyses
(a) Laboratory and Method Selection

Mr. MacDonald explained that selecting a laboratory for this project was challenging due
to the limited availability of an adequate local facility that could complete all necessary
tests, and which was also satisfactory to both Parties. In the end, ALS Environmental, based
in Houston, Texas, was chosen based on its certifications, its having an office in Ecuador
that could support sample handling and management, and its ability to manage the transport

of the samples from the sites to its laboratory in Houston.

Mr. MacDonald sought to ensure that method selection adhered as closely as possible to
those methods specified by Ecuador in RAOHE Annex 5 and TULAS. However, he noted,
in some cases, the laboratory methods stipulated in the regulations were outdated. He
therefore chose alternatives which, in his professional judgement were appropriate. Details
on the sample management procedures and the methods for analysis used in his work are

provided in Appendices D and E of his Report.

(b) Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons

Mr. MacDonald also gave consideration to the TPH methods selected for use at this site
since the methods specified in RAOHE Annex 5 have largely been withdrawn and are no
longer in professional use.” Two potentially suitable methods were used by the Parties in
their investigations: IEMS used the Texas Natural Resources Conservation Commission
(TNRCC) Method 1005, while GSI used SW846 8015C for soil and groundwater samples
and TNRCC Method 1006 for soil samples. In consultation with the laboratory, Mr.
MacDonald chose to use SW846 8015C for analysis of GRO (C6-C10), DRO (C10-C28),
and ORO (C20-C35), so that the possible sources of the petroleum could be better

Ibid., p. 46 & fn. 126: The following methods and publications were referenced in RAOHE Annex 5, but
were not selected for various reasons: (a) 6/1997 ECY 97-602 is not a method, but is a publication
summarizing multiple TPH methods; (b) EPA 413.1 s used for measurement of oil and grease, not TPH; (c)
EPA 418.1, which was applicable to TPH, was withdrawn by the USEPA in 2007 due to its use of Freon 113
as a solvent; (d) method 1664 (SGT-HIEM) is used for measurement of oil and grease, not TPH; (e) ASTM
D3921-96 was withdrawn by ASTM in 2013, and not replaced due to its limited use by industry; and (f)
German standard DIN 38409-H18 is inactive.

evaluated.“ To compare the results appropriately to the standards, he elected to add these
fractions together to obtain a total TPH value. This technique has the potential for
increasing the reported concentration of TPH in a sample due to overlapping carbons
between the fractions. However, in Mr. MacDonald’s professional opinion, this was a

reasonable and conservative approach.

(c) Metals

All soil, groundwater and mud pit leachate samples were analysed for metals using USEPA
Method SW6020A. Consistent with prior analyses conducted by the Parties’ experts, only
the following metals were analyzed: barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel,

vanadium, and zinc.

RAOHE specifies a number of specific atomic absorption methods for the analysis of
metals. In Mr. MacDonald’s view, IEMS used such methods for metals analyses consistent
with RAOHE. As for TPH, Ecuador allows for substitution of equivalent methods for
metals analysis in place of those listed in Annex 5. As such, GSI used method 6010B, an
inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry method, for all metals.
Ramboll’s selected method 6020A, also performed via inductively coupled plasma mass
spectrometry, was similar to that selected by GSI. All of the methods used by the Parties’
experts and by Ramboll would be considered acceptable and equivalent pursuant to

RAOHE.

TULAS does not identify specific methods, but rather indicates that they should be
consistent with those specified within the Institute of Ecuadorian Normalization or by

ASTM or the USEPA.

(d) Leachability Testing

Mr. MacDonald subjected mud pit samples to both TCLP and SPLP analyses ((EPA SW-
846 1311 and 1312, respectively). The leachate generated would then be analysed for the

parameters required in RAOHE Table 7: TPH, barium, cadmium, total chromium, and
vanadium using the analytical methods described above; and PAHs, using USEPA Method
8270D.

(e) Geotechnical Testing

As part of the monitoring well installation, Mr. MacDonald’s team collected soil samples
from the screened interval in the water bearing zones for sieve and hydrometer analysis to
define the percentage of clay in accordance with ASTM Methods and D6913 and D7928,
respectively. (No geotechnical testing methods are specified in RAOHE or TULAS.)

8. Bounding of Scope and Site Screening
(a) Key Scope Considerations

Mr. MacDonald noted that he was mandated by the Tribunal to conduct additional soil,
groundwater and mud pit sampling in the Blocks as needed to determine the presence
and/or extent of contamination for which remediation is required. The scope of these

activities was further bound as follows:°4

(i) Mr. MacDonald was directed only to consider areas at the sites that were previously
investigated by the Parties. His investigation was not to include sampling either at
new RECs that he may have independently identified, or at RECs previously

identified by the Parties that had not been sampled.

(ii) Only one sampling programme was authorised by the Tribunal. As such, a multi-
phased sampling approach as might be more typical to delineate contamination was
not implemented. Therefore, Mr. MacDonald decided that by use of a “macro”
sampling approach, the data that could be obtained from one field campaign would

still serve to narrow the extent of potential contamination at the sites.

Independent Expert Report, p. 49.

188

550.

(iii)

(iv)

(v)

Mr. MacDonald also sought to identify usable data generated by prior work

conducted by the Parties to avoid unnecessary duplication.

He also determined it was not necessary to delineate every point where contamination
was observed above a standard in soils. In some cases, the available data and other
factors (e.g., topography) were sufficient in his view to reasonably estimate remedial
quantities even if not fully delineated in all directions. In other instances, the
available data suggested that the “exceedance” was likely not related to oil field

contamination but rather to probable background conditions.

Mr. MacDonald also determined that it was appropriate to analyse for the full metal
suite in every sample where any metal was previously detected above applicable
criteria, rather than to restrict the analysis to specific metal exceedances in each area
investigated. He did not test samples for TPH if no TPH was suspected, based on
prior data, nor did he test for metals if prior data suggested only the presence of

hydrocarbons.

(b) Site Screening

Ramboll reviewed all data collected by the Parties for the purpose of developing a sampling

programme in Blocks 7 and 21. Mr. MacDonald stated that the key consideration in this

exercise was to determine appropriate screening criteria with respect to: (i) sites selected

for additional sampling; (ii) data screens for various media or features, including soils,

groundwater, and mud pits; and (iii) the basis and background for the additional site

investigation approach.*> Along with Ramboll’s exercise of professional experience and

judgement, this was considered appropriate to address what he called “significant gaps in

the overall technical analyses” performed by the Parties’ experts.

648

A total of 69 sites were subjected to a “desktop screening” evaluation.™“° Screening

included consideration of:

(a) The numerical criteria defined in RAOHE or, in its absence, TULAS, for

unrestricted, agricultural, and industrial land uses;

(b) Reassessment of land use designations by the Partie:

 

(c) Location and quantity of temporary monitoring wells previously installed by the

Parties;
(d) The historical use of mud pits by Perenco; and

(e) The nature of claims made on behalf of Ecuador.

Initial screening resulted in a proposed suite of work that flagged 38 sites for supplemental
investigation, including 30 sites where soils were to be investigated, 14 sites where
groundwater was to be investigated, and 9 sites where mud pits were to be investigated.

Mr. MacDonald then eliminated the following from his initial workplan:°”

(a) 21 sites were eliminated from consideration because no damages claims were made

in respect of them;%48

Independent Expert Report, fn, 129: Mr. MacDonald used the total of 70 sites presented in IEMS’ cost
estimate; however, Coca 2 and Coca CPF were considered as one site.

Ibid., pp. 49-50.

Ibid., fn. 130: “While numerous sites were included in IEMS? initial financial claim (above the “base value”),
some sites were ultimately excluded from their claim based on application of the regulatory criteria. All such
sites were initially screened out from further investigations by Ramboll. During implementation of the
investigation, Ecuador identified to Ramboll that some soil samples collected from sites where no regulatory
claim was made may have exceeded regulatory criteria (see Appendix B). As a result, Ramboll re-examined
these sites and where appropriate, expanded our program to include sites or areas of sites that had originally
been omitted from the sampling program (e.g. Oso A).”

190

553.

554.

649

(b) Eight additional sites were excluded because there were: (i) no groundwater claims;

(ii) no evidence of mud pit use by Perenco; and (iii) no soil samples contained

contamination above applicable soil cleanup criteria (excluding conductivity); and

(c) Eight additional sites were excluded because: (i) contaminant delineation was near-

complete; or (ii) only marginal exceedances of a single contaminant was detected.

As a result of further consultation with the Parties, the initial screening evaluation was

expanded to incorporate additional facts and findings. The final results of the screening

evaluation are presented in the subsections below.

(i) Sites Excluded from Further Consideration

Certain sites identified by GSI and IEMS did not require any supplemental investigation

based on the results of the Parties’ previous work. The following sites did not require

environmental media to be sampled at each of the 49 sites. The tables below provide Mr.

MacDonald’s rationale for the exclusion of soil, groundwater, and/or mud pit investigations

RAOHE performance criteria, and cover material integrity and quality were selected based
on: (i) whether mud pits were present at a given site; and (ii) whether or not there was

evidence of prior use by Perenco, as based on the timing of mud pit closure (where known)

and oil production well installation (where pit closure dates were not available); and (iii)
other information provided by the Parties, including discussions with the Parties’
representatives in the field. Mr. MacDonald’s assessment of those mud pits that were

associated with Perenco was provided to the Parties for confirmation.

Mr. MacDonald also reviewed documentation presented by IEMS regarding the reworking
of wells, which IEMS had alleged may have resulted in residuals that required disposal.
There was no record of on-site disposal of these residuals for any of the reworking activities
as described in the attached reports; therefore, Mr. MacDonald did not suspect any mud
pits of being “re-opened” for such activities. He also reviewed available leachability testing
data presented by GSI to determine if prior sampling and data evaluation, having regard to
RAOHE Tables 7a/7b, had been adequately conducted. While he considered that the
previous testing had some utility, in all cases, additional testing was needed to assess the

conditions of the pits.

The sites where mud pit testing was not proposed are listed below:°°?

(iv) Groundwater Excluded from Further Consideration

As instructed by the Tribunal, Mr. MacDonald limited his groundwater sampling activities

to those sites where prior testing had been performed by the Parties.? Additionally, he

excluded three sites where testing had been conducted, but in his judgement further testing

was not merited (two of these sites were completely omitted from his programme). His

reasons for this were as follows:

()

(ii)

The Waponi-Ocatoe site was excluded from further investigation because prior

testing by IEMS had identified only the presence of zinc above the applicable

TULAS standard (zinc at 1.38 mg/L). Zinc is not an oil field contaminant, and no

other media at this site indicated the potential presence of oil field contaminants.

The Waponi-Dayuno site was entirely excluded because, although groundwater was

sampled previously by IEMS, Perenco never operated on this platform.

Ibid., fn. 131: Mr. MacDonald notes that in correspondence dated 14 November 2017, Perenco raised some
concerns regarding the groundwater approach, including issues related to both the locations of monitoring
wells and the use of filtration. These matters were addressed in his correspondence dated 28 December 2017
(found at Appendix B to his report).

197

 

(iii) | The Yuralpa Landfill site was tested by IEMS only. GSI had attempted to install a
test well at this facility, but experienced refusal prior to encountering groundwater.
Mr. MacDonald excluded this site because it was the only groundwater location in
Block 21, based on GSI’s experience there was a low probability of success, and the
work would have necessitated the mobilisation of different drilling equipment, which

was not readily available, to the Block.®4

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

562. All other sites where groundwater was sampled by the Parties remained in the supplemental
programme.

(c) Outcome of Screening Evaluation

563. The desktop screening process resulted in a reduction of the number of sites warranting
investigation of soils, mud pits, and/or groundwater from 69 to 49 sites. The sites and media
that were omitted from further review were associated with IEMS’ remediation cost
estimates totaling $119.5 million, or 13.6% of the total regulatory-based claim of $876
million.

564. Table 4.4 of Mr. MacDonald’s report lists the sites and environmental media that were
further investigated, as well as the approximate amount of the IEMS regulatory-based
claims associated with those facilities.

The IEMS cost estimates for groundwater remediation provided in Table 35 of its 2013
Expert Report are the low-end groundwater cost estimates ($2.3 million per site, with those
for Coca 2/CPF and Gacela 1/8/CPF doubled to reflect multi-platform site designations).
The high-end IEMS estimates for groundwater, with contingencies included, were $13.5
million per site. These higher values were referenced in IEMS’ reports, but were not
included in Table 35, so were not incorporated here.

Blue-shaded cells represent IEMS cost estimates that have been excluded from further
review (refer to Sections 4.2.2 and 4.2.3. of Mr. MacDonald’s report). Dark-shaded rows
represent sites that have been excluded from further review (refer to Section 4.2.1 of
report).

9. Sampling Results

Mr. MacDonald’s site-specific sampling plans were prepared for each site and medium that
was retained for consideration after completing the screening. The guiding principles for
these plans are described in summary under Section 5.1 of his Report and in greater detail

in Appendices D and E.

Between 19 September to 15 December 2017, teams were mobilised to Blocks 7 and 21 to
implement the site-specific sampling plans under Mr. MacDonald’s direction. The

summary of his findings is set out below.

In general, the following can be concluded from the mud pit investigation:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

Mr. MacDonald concluded that no information was provided that was sufficient to
confirm that synthetic or clay liners are present beneath any specific mud pit.
Ramboll did not drill through the bottom of the mud pits to determine the presence
or absence of liner material, since this would have compromised the units if the
liners were present. In some cases, Ramboll did observe torn liner material along
some mud pit perimeters but had no information regarding its condition or lateral
extent in the rest of the mud pit. Therefore, Mr. MacDonald decided that, without
exception, the leachability testing data should be conservatively compared to the

standards for unlined mud pits presented in RAOHE Table 7a.

The current land use in the area of each mud pit was identified as part of Ramboll’s
site assessment activities. The cover material analytical data were compared to the
industrial, agricultural, or sensitive ecosystem/residential criteria in TULAS Table

3, Annex 2, and RAOHE Table 6, as applicable.

At least one mud pit did not meet the performance criteria at the 12 sites
investigated. Thirty-three of the 38 mud pits investigated by the Independent Expert
did not meet the performance criteria for unlined mud pits specified in RAOHE
(87%) and 14 of the 38 mud pits did not meet the performance criteria for lined pits
specified in RAOHE (37%). Contaminants that did not comply with the
performance criteria included pH, barium, total PAHs, TPH and conductivity.
These mud pits, as well as two additional mud pits located at Oso 9 that were not
investigated but are inferred to contain contamination similar to that found in
neighbouring mud pits that failed one or more criteria, are considered to require

remediation.

The materials overlying 21 of the 38 investigated mud pits did not meet the soil
remediation criteria applicable to soils based on determination of the applicable
land use in the area. Contaminants that exceeded the criteria included barium,
nickel, cadmium and TPH. In almost all cases (19 of 21 total mud pits), barium was

the contaminant of concern that did not meet the criteria. This, in Mr. MacDonald’s

204

568.

569.

opinion, suggests a high probability that the mud pit cover material is inadequate

or nonexistent and that the mud pit materials are at or near the ground surface.

(e) When reviewed in totality, 100% of the sites that were investigated had at least one
mud pit that did not comply with the leachability standards published in RAOHE
(12/12 sites). In addition, 83% of the sites had at least one mud pit with inadequate

cover material (10/12).

Mr. MacDonald identified the following site-specific findings as of particular interest:

(a) In Céndor Norte, a slope failure was observed immediately adjacent to the mapped
limits of the mud pits. Based on field observations, it appears that the slope failure

envelope may extend into the mud pit.

(b) In Coca 18/19, the data suggest that the extent of Mud Pit 6 is greater than the area

previously mapped by the Parties.

(c) In Lobo 3, the locations of the mud pits were not initially clear. Ramboll inspected
the area and collected vertical composite samples along both the southwest and
southeast edges of the pad to confirm the mud pit locations. It was determined that

the mud pits are located along the southwest edge of the pad.

(d) Oso 9A slopes from the northeast to the southwest and is bound by steep slopes to
the north and east. In the northeastern portion of the site, there is evidence of slope
failure. Torn black plastic, possibly related to a liner system, was observed in the

southwest portion of the site.

(b) Groundwater

Between 13 November and 14 December 2017, Ramboll collected samples from 34
permanent monitoring wells installed at 12 sites. The samples were analysed for TPH and
metals as described above. The findings are presented in Table 5.2 of Mr. MacDonald’s

Report.

To assist in well location orientation, Ramboll has provided REC# as identified by one or both Parties.
At the time of sample collection, sheens and petroleum odors were observed in the samples collected from the following
monitoring wells: COC02-MW01, COC02-MWO02, COCO2-MW03, and COCO2-MW04, GACO1-MW02, JAGO2-MWO1, MONO1-MW01,
MWO2, MW03, MW04, OSO09-MW02, PAYO1-MWO1, PAY02-MWO1, PAY02-MWO02, PAY02-MW04, PAY04-MW03, PAY 13-MW01,
PAY13-MWO2 and PAY 15-MW02.
The ‘TPH concentration in sample JAGO1-MWO1 was at the applicable criteria (325 ug/L).

‘ample JAGO2-MWO2 was analyzed for TPH using method TX1005 instead of method US EPA Method 8015. The detection
method for this sample (450 ug/L) exceeded the applicable criteria of 325 ug/L.

570. In general, the following can be concluded:

(a) Mr. MacDonald considered that Ramboll’s well construction and sampling
techniques allowed it to produce non-turbid, unfiltered groundwater samples that
accurately represent the chemical quality of groundwater at the sites. In all cases,
sampled groundwater was observed to be clear and free of sediments and/or
clouding and had a low turbidity (i.e., less than 14 NTU, and in most cases below

10 NTU).

(b) Ramboll collected soil samples from the water bearing zones at each well to assess
the clay content in the screened interval. This sampling was done, in part, to
determine if there was some correlation between clay content and turbidity levels,
and to address a reference in TULAS with respect to groundwater criteria. While
the clay content varied between locations within and across sites, groundwater
was produced in all wells and there seems to be little correlation between the clay

content and the turbidity levels as determined from well sampling activities. The

207

S71.

(c)

relevance of these findings is discussed further in Section 6.1 of Mr. MacDonald’s

Report.

Based on Ramboll’s sampling results, TPH contamination in groundwater above
the TULAS standard is present in all 12 investigated sites, and in 74% of sampled
monitoring wells. The maximum observed concentration of TPH was 1915 ug/L
at Payamino 2/8, as compared to the TULAS criterion of 325 ug/L. Barium is
found at 58% of the sites, and in 38% of the sampled wells. The maximum
observed concentration of barium was 4700 pg/L at Gacela 1, as compared to the
criterion of 338 ug/L. No other contaminants of concern were identified in the

monitoring wells.

(c) Soils

Between 19 September and 15 December 2017, Ramboll collected and analysed 801 soil

samples from 40 sites. These samples were collected from locations intended to delineate

areas of known soil contamination exceeding Ecuador’s numerical criteria in TULAS

(Table 3 of Annex 2) or RAOHE (Table 6) and to address significant data gaps. In general,

Mr. MacDonald found that the aggregate exceedances of concentration criteria for soils do

not directly correspond to the severity of contamination at a site or the need for site

remediation. However, Mr. MacDonald made two key observations which apply to the

totality of the soil data:

(a)

(b)

The data collected by Ramboll fills data gaps and supplements data previously
gathered by the Parties that indicated oilfield related contamination, primarily
barium and TPH. It can, in his opinion, be relied upon to estimate remedial

footprints.°>

Elevated cadmium and vanadium concentrations are found throughout the Blocks.
As determined through background evaluations conducted by both the Parties and

Ramboll, these concentrations largely appear to Mr. MacDonald to be associated

573.

574.

with natural background conditions.®° Particularly for vanadium, the distribution
of this metal appears to be both widespread and random, with a wide range of
naturally occurring concentrations. There are a few cases where cadmium and
vanadium were found at concentrations above the calculated background
concentrations. In such instances, delineation sampling of these compounds was

conducted.
(i) Block 7
For Block 7, Ramboll’s findings were as follows.°7

Coca 1: Soil exceedances in the low-lying swampy area southwest of the platform (REC
330; historical discharge) were delineated by samples at borings COCO01-01 through
COCO01-06. Petroleum odor was noted in subsurface soils at COC01-02 and COCO01-05.
Neither TPH nor barium were detected above the agricultural criteria in any of the samples.
However, vanadium (up to 180 mg/kg) exceeded the regulatory criterion to the southwest
portion of this area. In combination with topographical features, the data provides an

adequate framework for establishing a remedial footprint.**

Coca 2 / CPF: Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior TPH exceedances were
not fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling around four main

areas:®?

(a) TPH in the area southwest of the platform / CPF (REC 40; oil-water separator
discharge) was delineated by samples at borings COC02-01 through COC02-03

as TPH did not exceed the applicable criterion in any of the samples.

TPH in the area north of the former formation water pit (REC 352) was delineated
by samples at borings COC02-04 and COC02-05 as TPH did not exceed the

applicable criterion in any samples.

TPH in the swampy area southeast of the platform / CPF (REC 354; historical
discharge to swamp) was delineated by samples at borings COC02-06 through
COCO02-15 and COC02-18159 as TPH did not exceed the applicable criterion in
any of the samples. It should be noted, though, that petroleum odor and staining

were noted in subsurface soils at COC02-11 and COC02-14.

TPH in the area west of the Coca 2 mud pit (REC 335), where slight petroleum
odor was noted during well installation next to the mud pit, was investigated by
samples at borings COC02-16 and COC02-17. TPH did not exceed the applicable

criterion in any of the samples.

Coca 4: Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior barium exceedances were not

fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling around one main area:

Barium in soils in the swampy area east of the platform (REC 244; oil-water separator

discharge) were delineated by samples at borings COC04-01 through COC04-04 as barium

did not exceed the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in any of the samples.°

Coca 6: Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior barium and TPH exceedances

were not fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling around two

main areas:°°!

(a)

The area southeast of the platform (not associated with a specific REC), which
is a relatively flat area topographically higher than the swamp area, was further
investigated by samples at borings COC06-01 through COC06-04, primarily to
address barium. Other than the vertical delineation sample, barium (up to 1,070

mg/kg) exceeded the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in all sampling

locations in the area investigated. Vanadium (up to 153 mg/kg) also exceeded

the regulatory criterion in the same area.

A low-lying swampy area (formerly described by GSI as a swale) also southeast
of the platform (REC 257; historical discharge from workover activities) was
further investigated by samples at borings COC06-05 through COC06-13.
Petroleum odor and staining were noted in subsurface soils at COC06-06 and
COC06-10. However, TPH did not exceed the sensitive ecosystem / residential
criterion in any of the samples. Barium (up to 951 mg/kg) exceeded the
applicable criterion along the western side of the swamp and at locations along
the ridge that borders the swamp to the east. Vanadium (up to 216 mg/kg) also

exceeded the applicable criterion around the same areas.

mg/kg) and nickel (up to 52.4 mg/kg) were detected above the applicable criteria.

Pile 1 (not an identified REC but the project record suggested an area of possible
historic disposal of oilfield materials) was further investigated by borings
COC18-12 through COC18-14. Barium (up to 6220 mg/kg) was detected at
concentrations exceeding the applicable sensitive ecosystem / residential
criterion. Vanadium (up to 180 mg/kg) and cadmium (up to 1.35 mg/kg) were

mg/kg) exceeded the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in the deepest interval
sampled (borings CONO1-01 and CONO1-05), and in boring CON01-02. Cadmium (up to
4.97 mg/kg) also exceeded the applicable criterion in all sampling locations. The
boundaries of the sloughed materials were defined using a GPS and serve to define the

remedial footprint.°©°

Gacela 1/8 / CPF: Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior barium and TPH
exceedances were not fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling

around two main areas:°7

(a) The swampy area south of the platform (REC 371; historical discharge) was
further investigated by samples at borings GACO1-01 through GACOI-11.
Petroleum odor and / or staining were encountered in subsurface soils at GACO1-
01, GACO1-02, GACO1-04, GACO1-10 and GACO1-11. However, TPH did not

exceedances were not fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling

around two main areas: °°

(a) The area west and downslope of the platform (which is not associated with a
specific REC) was further investigated by samples at borings GAC02-01 through
GACO02-04. Barium (up to 1,610 mg/kg) exceeded the sensitive ecosystem /

residential criterion in the northeast portion of this area.

(b) The area between the two mud pits on the platform (which is not associated with
a specific REC) was further investigated by samples at borings GAC02-05
through GAC02-08. Petroleum odor and staining were encountered in
subsurface soils at GAC02-06 and GAC02-07. However, TPH did not exceed
the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in any of the samples. Barium (up
to 4,790 mg/kg) exceeded the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in this
area. The data suggests that it is possible that the two mud pits may be

contiguous.

Gacela 4: Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior barium exceedances were
not fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling around one main
area: Barium in soils near the Gacela 4 well (REC 304; possible discharge from wellhead)

(a)

(b)

(c)

The area northwest of the mud pit and around the two open pits (REC 312) was
further investigated by samples at borings JAGO1-01 through JAGO1-03,
JAGO1-15 and JAGO1-17. Nickel (up to 81.9 mg/kg) exceeded the sensitive
ecosystem / residential criterion in all sampling locations. Barium (722 mg/kg
at JAGO1-03), chromium (up to 127 mg/kg at JAGO1-01 through JAGO1-03, and
JAGO1-17) and vanadium (up to 193 mg/kg at all boring locations) also exceeded

the corresponding regulatory criteria.

The area surrounding the valve station (not associated with a specific REC),
where a vanadium exceedance was previously detected (GSI sample JAO1-3T-
01) and historical petroleum impacts were reported by GSI162, was investigated
by samples at borings JAGO1-08 through JAGO1-11. While the samples
collected were not analyzed for TPH, no evidence of crude were identified in
any of these borings. The samples collected from this area indicated the presence
of nickel (up to 40.8 mg/kg) and vanadium (up to 165 mg/kg) above the

regulatory criteria.

The stream bed area and associated swamp (REC 311) was delineated by
samples at borings JAGO1-04 through JAGO1-07, JAGO1-12 through JAGO1-14
and JAGO1-16. Petroleum odor was noted in subsurface soils at JAGO1-06.

borings JAGO2-01 through JAGO2-05 and JAGO2-15 through JAGO2-17.
Borings JAGO2-02 and JAGO2-15 through JAGO2-17 were advanced in the
slope failure area to the northwest of the mud pits. Petroleum odor and / or
staining were encountered in subsurface soils at JAG02-02, JAGO2-04, JAGO2-
15 and JAGO2-17. Consequently, TPH analysis was added for samples at this
site. TPH (up to 1,190 mg/kg) at JAGO2-15 and barium (up to 1,100 mg/kg) at
JAGO02-01, JAGO2-15 and JAGO2-16 exceeded the sensitive ecosystem /
residential criteria in the northern portion of this area. Chromium (up to 114
mg/kg), nickel (up to 220 mg/kg) and vanadium (up to 247 mg/kg) also exceeded
the regulatory criteria at all boring locations, whereas lead did not exceed the

applicable criteria in any of the samples.

The area northwest of the platform (REC 298; possible historical spill) was
further investigated by samples at borings JAGO2-06 through JAGO2-14. What
appeared to be weathered crude was noted at the surface in several locations
within the investigation area. However, TPH was not detected above the
sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion in any of the samples. Barium (up to
7,920 mg/kg) and nickel (up to 88.8 mg/kg) exceeded the applicable criteria at
several locations to the west, north and northeast. Lead (279 mg/kg) and

lead (up to 139 mg/kg), nickel (up to 80.1 mg/kg) and vanadium (up to 213
mg/kg) also exceeded the regulatory criteria in one or more locations south and

west of the Jaguar 3 well.

The eastern platform area (not associated with a specific REC) was further
investigated by samples at borings JAGO3-04 through JAGO03-08 to investigate
elevated vanadium along the eastern side of the platform. Vanadium (up to 196
mg/kg) exceeded the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion at all borings.

area: Barium in the stream area east of the platform (not associated with a specific REC,
but possibly associated with oil-water separator discharge) was delineated by samples at
JAGO7-01 through JAGO7-03, as it was not detected above the agricultural criterion in any
of the samples. Cadmium (up to 1.39 mg/kg) and chromium (up to 65.8 mg/kg) at two
different locations and nickel (up to 63.7 mg/kg) at two locations exceeded the regulatory

criteria in this area.°”>

Lobo 1: Within the areas investigated by Ramboll, the prior barium exceedances were not
fully delineated vertically or horizontally. After additional sampling around one main area:
The area surrounding the mud pit (REC 211) was further investigated by samples at borings
LOBO1-03, LOB01-04 and LOBO1-04A. Petroleum odor was noted in subsurface soils at
LOBO1-04, so TPH analysis was added at LOBO1-04 and LOBO1-04A. However, TPH did
not exceed the agricultural criterion in any of the samples. Barium (up to 10,600 mg/kg)
exceeded the applicable criteria to the south and west portions of this area. Cadmium (up
to 2.62 mg/kg), chromium (up to 88.3 mg/kg), lead (up to 212 mg/kg) and nickel (up to 60

mg/kg) also exceeded the regulatory criteria at these same locations.”

The swampy area furthest to northwest of the CPF (area not associated with a
specific REC) was further investigated by samples at borings PAY01-01 through
PAYO1-05, PAYO1-16 and PAYOI1-17. TPH did not exceed the sensitive
ecosystem / residential criterion in any of the samples. However, barium (up to
812 mg/kg) exceeded the applicable criterion to the west and northwest. At one
location, chromium (up to 69 mg/kg) was also detected above the applicable

At PAY02-01 and PAY02-02, petroleum staining was observed at the surface, and
petroleum odor, staining and beads of free product were noted in subsurface soils and water
at these same locations. Petroleum odor and staining were also noted in subsurface soils at
PAY02-04. However, TPH did not exceed the sensitive ecosystem / residential criterion
in any of the samples. Barium (up to 5,810 mg/kg) exceeded the sensitive ecosystem /
residential criterion in the deepest interval sampled and to the south, west, north and
northwest of the area investigated. At certain isolated locations, cadmium (up to 1.68
mg/kg), chromium (up to 102 mg/kg), lead (up to 182 mg/kg) and vanadium (up to 144

10. Remedial requirements

(a) Conceptual Remedial Plans

Mr. MacDonald identified and evaluated potential soil, mud pit and shallow groundwater
remedial alternatives with reference to four primary criteria: demonstrability, technical
feasibility, regulatory acceptance, and permanence. Considering _ site-specific
characterisation of affected media as well as other environmental conditions, a remedial

technology was excluded from further consideration if it:
(a) Was not generally accepted under TULAS or RAOHE;

(b) Was not well-established;

(c) Necessitated installation of a new significant, reliable and continuous power
source;
(d) Was ineffective;

Ibid., pp. 97-98.
Ibid., p. 98.
Ibid., Section 6.3.1.

228

(e) Required highly specialised equipment that was not locally available; or
(f) ‘Would not meet the remedial objectives.

615. Following this screening process, Mr. MacDonald ranked the retained alternatives by
considering their short-term effectiveness (i.e., risks to human health and the environment
during remedy implementation), long-term effectiveness (i.e., risks to human health and
the environment following remedy implementation), implementability (i.e., ease,
reliability, and flexibility of implementation considering site constraints) and relative costs.
For each criterion, the technologies were scored relative to each other and the cumulative
scores were totaled, weighted, and compared to define preferred options (i.e., the
alternatives with the highest scores). Mr. MacDonald’s preferred remedial options for each

target medium are set out in Table 6.2 to his Report, which is reproduced below:

Notes:

Ex-situ refers to remedial action following removal at a designated on-site or central area.

» In-situ refers to remedial action in place, without the need for excavation and transport to a designated on-site or central area.
On-site refers to a location within the facility or a nearby fa tion outside the facility

This alternative could include consolidation of TPH impacted soils from various sites in a central area and management as a single media.
This alternative could include consolidation of nonconforming soils with nonconforming mud pit materials and management of both as a
single media.

In-situ treatment only refers to liming to adjust pH.

For mud pit materials not conforming to the unlined performance criteria but meeting the lined performance criteria.

Mud pit treatment could include mixing with reagents such as Portland cement, borrow soils, and/or lime.

This alternative is only viable at continuously manned sites where there is an existing power source and means for storage and treatment of
extracted ground water.

The permeable reactive barrier is typically placed in the downgradient side of an affected ground water area. However, given the
predicted relatively low potential for contaminant migration for most sites, such a PRB would not be effective in addressing groundwater
contamination as the PRB relies on sufficient water flowing through the reactive media, A variation of this alternative would involve
placement of reactive media (to oxidize or reduce contaminants) at the base of proposed excavations within such areas where groundwater
sampling has identified contamination.

Mr. MacDonald considered that the conceptual remedy selection for soils conforms to
paragraph 4.1.3.6 and 4.1.3.7 of TULAS Annex 2, Book VI, while that for mud pits
conforms to Articles 52(d)2.3 and 59(b) of RAOHE. These define generally accepted
remedial approaches by the Ministry of the Environment in Ecuador and establish specific
performance criteria. Further, in defining the conceptual remedial approach the following

factors were considered:

(a) Each site was considered in its entirety, such that the selected remedial plan would

address all affected media.

(b) The remedial approach considered for a specific area considered other remedial
activities at the site such that the least number of remedial technologies would be

implemented to simplify implementation.

(c) If water was to be removed (e.g., dewatering of excavation, dewatering of swampy
soils), it was assumed that two modular temporary water treatment systems would

be used and shared between sites.

(d) If remedial action was to be implemented in swampy areas requiring dewatering to
allow construction in “dry conditions” or to manage surface water, it was assumed

that a temporary and reusable dam system would be used.

Mr. MacDonald considered that these factors would allow for remedy optimisation and/or

reduced implementation costs.

(b) Cost Estimates
Mr. MacDonald then developed site-specific cost estimates for the selected conceptual
remedial alternative to address affected media at each site using standard engineering
methods which incorporated local unit costs, where available.”° Remedial cost estimates
were developed in general conformance with the USEPA and USACE guidelines. These
are detailed in Appendix I to his Report. Mr. MacDonald acknowledged that the accuracy

230

619.

620.

701

of estimates at the conceptual remedy design stage would be expected to be less than that
of estimates developed at subsequent design stages, nevertheless, for most sites, he
considered that the available data was adequate to develop reasonable estimates of remedial

costs for the site-specific remedial plans.””!

Where the data was incomplete (e.g., partial
or incomplete horizontal and/or vertical delineation), higher contingencies were used to

account for scope uncertainty.

The quantities used in the development of the remedial costs were mostly defined based on
delineated or inferred horizontal and vertical extents of soil contamination, mapped mud
pit dimensions, and projected groundwater impairment. Where contamination was
identified but not completely delineated or characterised, the Expert employed “order of
magnitude” remedial estimates. For certain remedial activities where quantities (e.g.,
excavation dewatering volume, reagent quantities required to meet remedial goals, depth
of permeable reactive barriers, mud pit configuration), material properties (e.g., water
content or density of excavated materials, swell and shrink ratios for materials) or duration
of treatment process (e.g., landfarming) could not be fully defined, these factors were
assumed based on site-specific conditions and the Expert’s professional experience with

similar projects.

Unit costs and production rates used in the remedial cost estimates were defined from a
combination of: (i) quotes obtained from remedial contractors in Ecuador; (ii) quotes
obtained from United States suppliers of materials (i.e., reagents) with experience in
Ecuador; (iii) verified unit rates previously obtained by the Parties; and (iv) published
remedial unit costs in the United States (e.g., RS Means, RACER) adjusted through the use
of location indices. While some local contractors did not provide definitive quotes in the
absence of a detailed project scope, site details, and the possibility of a site visit, Mr.

MacDonald believed that the unit pricing estimated that he used was adequate for overall

These estimates were based on conditions known at the time of the Report’s writing. With completion of pre-
design investigations and the remedial design activities, adjustments to these estimates were possible.

703,

705

cost projections. The unit pricing used in the cost estimates was inclusive of labor,

equipment, materials, and overhead and profit, unless otherwise indicated.

In developing the remedial cost estimates, the remedial process was subdivided into major

construction tasks, which where were further subdivided as appropriate:

(a)

(b)

(c)

(d)

(e)

Pre-Construction Activities: These include additional pre-design investigation
activities to better define remedial quantities and assess the extent and magnitude
of groundwater impacts, environmental permitting to allow implementation of the
proposed remedial actions and their design. Related Costs were allocated

proportionally to the soil, mud pit and groundwater remedial estimates. ’°”

Site Preparation: These include inter alia equipment and material mobilization
to prepare sites for remedial works. Related costs were allocated proportionally to

the soil, mud pit and groundwater remedial estimates.”°>

Ex-Situ Treatment of Soils - Landfarming: Ex-situ soil treatment through
landfarming is only applicable to soils affected by TPH and ultimately leads to

backfilling of the treated soils and restoration of disturbed areas. 7+

Soil Excavation, Treatment and Disposal: This involves the excavation,
treatment and disposal activities in non-mud pit areas. Excavated materials would
be treated by stabilisation/solidification (i.e., mixing with reagents such as
Portland cement, borrow soils, and/or lime) if impacted by metals (with or without

TPH) or TPH alone.”

Mud Pit Remediation: There are three potential alternatives depending on the
extent of conformance to the RAOHE performance criteria. Specifically, (i) mud

pit materials that do not meet the performance criteria for lined mud pits would be

treated and placed in reconstructed lined mud pits, (ii) mud pit materials that only
fail to meet the unlined mud pit performance criteria would be placed in
reconstructed lined mud pits, and (iii) mud pit materials not conforming to the
unlined pH criteria in RAOHE would be treated in-situ. In all cases, the integrity
of the closed mud pit would need to be ensured through periodic maintenance
(mowing) and use of the mud pit area restricted through installation of a perimeter

fence if one does not already exist.”

Groundwater Remediation: In areas where soil/mud pit and groundwater
sampling have identified collocated contamination, groundwater remediation
activities are integrated with soil or mud pit remediation activities. In the few cases
where there is potential for a higher degree of groundwater contaminant migration,
groundwater remediation would consist of installation of a permeable reactive
barrier. This passive groundwater treatment system would not require operation
and maintenance but would require periodic monitoring to document the

effectiveness of the treatment system.”°”

Construction Management: These relate to the oversight and documentation of
the remedial action and the reporting of the work performed. Associated costs
were allocated proportionally to the soil, mud pit and groundwater remedial

estimates.”

Contingency: Contingency costs were defined based on how well the scope of
the proposed remedy could be defined and ranged from 10% to 30% depending
on complexity and certainty. These were allocated proportionally to the soil, mud

pit and groundwater remedial estimates.”°°

qi) Recurring Costs: These include long-term maintenance and monitoring costs,
applied after remedy implementation. Certain remedies would require periodic
physical inspections and site maintenance. For groundwater remedies, annual
groundwater monitoring for 10 years to document treatment effectiveness have
been considered. While the cap maintenance activities will be required in

perpetuity, for estimating purposes, these costs are assumed to span 30 years.7!°

In addition, based on experience of local contractors that recently conducted remedial work
on behalf of Petroamazonas in the region, a labor cost multiplier of three to five was applied
to those projects to address health and safety and community relations requirements
imposed by Petroamazonas, which affect remedial work productivity and effectiveness.
This factor also accounts for the potential for added security necessary for implementation
of the work. In the absence of detailed cost breakdowns or defined durations for all
construction activities, Ramboll could not reliably determine the degree to which such a
factor should be applied in its remedial cost estimations. Ramboll believed that this factor
may be partially offset by the applied contingencies and the conservative assumptions used
in defining remedial quantities.”'! Quantity and costs are set out at Tables 6.3 to 6.10 of

the Independent Expert Report.

(c) Summary of Cost Estimates

Based on Mr. MacDonald’s consideration of the conceptual remedial plans and possible
viable remediation methods and the associated costs, Mr. MacDonald considered that the

estimates of probable remedial costs for the site-specific remedial plans were reasonable.

Based on these conceptual remedial plans, Ramboll developed site-specific cost estimates
using standard cost estimating methods and in general conformance with the USEPA and

USACE guidelines:”!7

(d)

Remedial quantities were mostly defined based on delineated or inferred horizontal
and vertical extents of soil contamination, mapped mud pit dimensions, and degree
of predicted groundwater impairment. In cases where impacts were identified but
not completely delineated or characterized, order of magnitude remedial estimates

were provided.

For certain remedial quantities or material properties, assumptions were made based

on site-specific conditions and professional experience with similar projects.

Unit costs and production rates used in the remedial cost estimates were defined
from a combination of: (a) quotes obtained from remedial contractors in Ecuador;
(b) quotes obtained from United States suppliers of materials with experience in
Ecuador; (c) verified unit rates previously obtained by the Parties; and (d) published
remedial unit costs in the United States (e.g., RS Means, RACER), adjusted using

location indexes.

For complex sites (e.g., presence of underground pipelines, steep slopes, limited
access, work within swamps), higher contingencies were applied to account for

scope uncertainty.

11. Opinions Regarding the Technical Findings in the Blocks

Mr. MacDonald’s key conclusions and opinions regarding the comprehensive technical

findings in the Blocks are as follows:7!

(a) The field work conducted by Ramboll significantly enhanced the body of
knowledge and technical platform with respect to contamination across the sites in
Blocks 7 and 21 and serves as a credible basis to determine unbiased and

independent cost estimates.

(b) The comprehensive mud pit investigation shows that a large percentage of mud pits
in the Blocks do not meet the performance standards in RAOHE and require

remediation.

(c) Representative data obtained from all of the investigated platforms in the Blocks
shows that groundwater has been impaired by oilfield operations and requires

remediation.

(d) The comprehensive soil investigation adequately defined the extent of oilfield-
related impacts at the Blocks that require remediation. The data gathered was

sufficient to reasonably define remedial quantities.

Ibid., Section 7.

237

627.

628.

629.

(e) The analytical tools and guiding principles used to define media-specific remedial
requirements are consistent with Ecuador’s regulations, professional practices, and

the Tribunal’s direction.

(f) Remedial options for affected media were systematically evaluated to pre-select
locally available, demonstrated, implementable and cost-effective alternatives that
conform to generally accepted remedial approaches described in TULAS or
RAOHE. The remedial options were then assembled into site-specific conceptual
remedial plans to address the affected media. Associated remedial cost estimates
were developed using standard cost estimating methods that incorporate unit costs
from local contractors, published remedial unit costs adjusted using location

indexes.

The Parties’ Comments

Following the transmission of Mr. MacDonald’s Report to the Parties, the Tribunal
permitted the Parties to make two forms of written submissions on the Report, to request
certain documents of each other, and to make oral submissions and pose questions to the

Expert at a two-day hearing held in The Hague on 11-12 March 2019.

In relation to the written materials, the Parties were instructed to annotate the Independent
Expert Report by providing focused comments on each main part of the Report. Their
comments were thus inserted into a “Consolidated Expert Report.” In addition, the
Parties were invited to file general comments on the Report in a separate written submission

not to exceed 30 pages.

After these documents were filed on 22 February 2019, they were transmitted to
Mr. MacDonald for his review. On Day | of the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald gave a
90-minute presentation to the Parties and the Tribunal in which he explained his key
findings and responded to the Parties’ written comments. The Parties were then each given

two hours to cross examine him.

238

630.

631.

632.

This was followed by a witness conferencing session wherein Mr. MacDonald was paired
first with a representative of IEMS and then with a representative of GSI. Each Party was
permitted to put questions to the two experts. On Day 2, the Parties were once again
permitted to put questions to Mr. MacDonald and then to make closing submissions on the

Independent Expert’s work.

1. Ecuador’s Observations on the Independent Expert’s Findings

Ecuador observed that Mr. MacDonald limited himself to a single “data gap filling”
sampling campaign, consistent with the Tribunal’s mandate.”'4 In Ecuador’s view, the
Independent Expert employed best and current industry practices throughout his field
campaign. His Report confirms Ecuador’s position that extensive and widespread
environmental harm was left behind by Perenco in Blocks 7 and 21, and that Perenco was
not a diligent and prudent operator that acted in full compliance with Ecuadorian
environmental regulations.”!> Mr. MacDonald has closed significant data gaps and
estimated higher remediation volumes and costs for said contamination than Perenco’s
experts and effectively vindicated Ecuador’s position that contamination extends beyond
the sampled points and that the use of predictive modelling software (as used by IEMS) to

estimate the full extent of contamination in the Blocks was justified.’!°

Following Mr. MacDonald’s findings and conclusions, and on the basis of newly-available

data, Ecuador updated its claims for such sites where Mr. MacDonald has confirmed

additional remedial volumes and costs compared to its “regulatory case”:7!7

(a) Soil remediation costs:

i. Coca 10/16: at least US$781,000;
ii. Jaguar 1: at least US$3,104,000;
iii. Jaguar 5/CPF: at least US$379,000;
iv. Lobo 4: at least US$717,000;

v. Oso A: at least US$228,000;

vi. Payamino 23: at least US$1,765,000; and
vii. Yuralpa F/CPF: at least US$98,000.

(b) Groundwater remediation costs:

i. Mono CPF: at least US$5,030,000;
ii. Oso 9: at least US$3,415,000; and
iii. Payamino 2/8: at least US$4,343,000.

At the same time, Ecuador argued that Mr. MacDonald did not capture the full extent of
the contamination caused by Perenco, and has estimated only the minimum required
remedial needs arising out of what it called Perenco’s “reckless operations.””!* Ecuador’ s

comments on specific aspects of Mr. MacDonald’s investigation are set out below.

(a) Soil

Ecuador considers that Mr. MacDonald’s investigation of soil contamination was generally

in compliance with the Tribunal’s mandate. 7!”

First, Mr. MacDonald restricted the sampling campaign to previously sampled areas.
Insofar as Perenco criticises Mr. MacDonald for sampling outside of his mandate, Ecuador
argues that the Tribunal’s instruction that “/t]o the extent that the areas surrounding those
points of contamination were not delineated [...] that process of delineation must now
occur’ was complied with when Mr. MacDonald stepped away approximately 10 to 15
metres from the Parties’ samples to collect additional samples in a soil pile a few metres to

the east of Perenco’s auxiliary (and contaminated) pits at Coca 18/19.77!

Second, in Ecuador’s opinion, Mr. MacDonald’s reliance on discrete soil samples (of
intervals of less than 0.3 m) for delineation purposes allowed him to capture the highest

concentrations of contaminants within each sampled interval. This resulted in higher

640.

remediation volumes, in contrast to GSI’s vertical 1-metre composites which

underestimated contamination through dilution.

Ecuador observes that Mr. MacDonald adjusted the applicable criteria to account for
background metals levels where there were likely natural concentrations of heavy metals.
This resulted in the exclusion of hundreds of the Parties’ samples as well as
Mr. MacDonald’s own delineation samples that showed the presence of vanadium and

cadmium exceedances above the thresholds specified in RAOHE and TULAS. 7”?

Turning to land use classifications, Ecuador defends Mr. MacDonald’s methodology

 

against Perenco’s criti

(a) First, contrary to Perenco’s criticism that Mr. MacDonald relied on visual
inspections for land use designations, he did not.’ In any event, Perenco’s own

experts limited their land use designations assessment to visual inspection.”~*

(b) Second, Mr. MacDonald could not be faulted by Perenco for looking at actual land

use when that was Perenco’s case all along.’”°

However, Ecuador itself raised a number of criticisms of Mr. MacDonald’s soil

remediation estimates.

First, even though Ecuador acknowledges that Mr. MacDonald’s guidelines for land use
classification were generally in line with the Tribunal’s mandate to apply the more stringent
land use designation, Ecuador argues that his classifications for certain locations were too
permissive. Ecuador cites as examples the area to the northeast of the platform in Payamino
4 which had been reclassified as “industrial”, and the classification of Coca 1 and Gacela

1/8 as “agricultural”, even though the Consortium and prior operators acknowledged that

areas of water interaction were “sensitive.”””° Ecuador also argues that Lobo 1 should be
remediated to a sensitive ecosystem standard, not agricultural, as it had been abandoned by
Perenco and had not been operated by Petroamazonas, and this would be in line with
Mr. MacDonald’s remediation approach for other platforms which have not been operated

since Perenco’s abandonment.

Second, Ecuador criticises Mr. MacDonald’s exclusion of three sites where soil
exceedances above the applicable regulatory criteria were identified: Lobo 2 samples had
barium exceedances, Payamino 5 samples had barium exceedances, and Payamino 19
samples had TPH exceedances.”2” Mr. MacDonald also excluded from his investigations
seven other sites on the basis that Perenco had not drilled in those sites or Perenco-
associated pits were not identified. However, Ecuador argues, it cannot be ruled out that
Perenco’s activities had taken place at these sites and they should have been investigated
further.’?° Ecuador also argues that Mr. MacDonald should at the very least have delineated

as orders of magnitude.’”°

Third, the Independent Expert’s soil delineation was incomplete. Complete delineation was
only performed at 12 sites. Ecuador points to Mr. MacDonald’s acknowledgement of this
point in his Report as well as at Expert Hearing.’*° To identify the full extent of vertical
and horizontal contamination, sampling should continue until ‘clean soil’ was found;
however, 239 out of 804 samples collected by Mr. MacDonald still were not ‘clean’.
Mr. MacDonald instead estimated the boundaries of contamination based on existing data
and bounding conditions as well as field observations. An example of such incomplete

delineation is Coca 8, where Mr. MacDonald’s sampling still found contamination and

where he assumed an average of 3-metre depth for remediation even though he

acknowledged that exceedances were found at depths of up to 4.5 metres.”*!

Finally, Ecuador criticised Mr. MacDonald’s decision to estimate “orders of magnitude”
for remediation when data was insufficient. There was no guarantee that these estimates
captured all contamination present in those areas. Once again, Ecuador relied on Coca 8 as
an example where there was no reason to believe that Mr. MacDonald’s estimate properly

captured all contamination.

(b) Mud Pits

Ecuador observed that, contrary to Perenco’s contention that it consistently followed good
practices with respect to mud pits, the Expert found that the contents of 34 of 38 sampled
Perenco-associated mud pits failed to conform with RAOHE criteria. All 12 of the
investigated sites had at least one mud pit that did not comply with leachability standards

and 11 of those sites also had at least one mud pit with inadequate cover material.’°7

With respect to Mr. MacDonald’s decision to sample the Oso 9A and 9B off-site pits, which
was criticised by Perenco as falling outside of his mandate, Ecuador argued that he was
right to do so. Mr. MacDonald’s decision to sample these pits was consistent with his
mandate for three reasons: first, said pit area had been previously sampled in 2010 by
IEMS; second, Perenco acknowledged having performed workovers at Oso 9 and drilling
nearby wells and did not deny having used such pits; and third, GSI referred to sampling

conducted by Perenco at the alleged time of the closure of these pits.”*

Ecuador asserted that Mr. MacDonald properly verified the conformance of all mud pit
leachate samples against the criteria in RAOHE Table 7 through the TCLP leachate test
specified by RAOHE. Although Mr. MacDonald also used the SPLP method to

“qualitatively [...] assess the potential for in-situ leaching of detected constituents in mud

648.

649.

pit materials’, he did not rely on SPLP results, as GSI “inappropriately” did, to assess

compliance with RAOHE.™*+

Ecuador also argued that Mr. MacDonald’s decision to treat all pits as unlined was justified,
given that they constitute exposure pathways due to their depth and shallowness of the
phreatic level (i.e., shallow groundwater). This was all the more relevant considering the
lack of evidence of liners in pits, as Mr. MacDonald pointed out.’*° Ecuador recalled that
GST had admitted that it “didn’t conduct a separate test regarding the presence or absence
of synthetic liners.””° Even if Perenco had installed liners (which it has not established),
there was no certainty that the liners fully extended beneath the pits and remained intact.
Indeed, Perenco’s own employees stated that the Consortium was careless when depositing

drilling muds such that some liners cracked under the high temperatures. 7°”

The liner issue aside, Ecuador had a number of criticisms about Mr. MacDonald’s mud pit

investigations.

First, Mr. MacDonald excluded from further investigation mud pits in 30 sites which he
investigated on the basis that Perenco’s use had not been identified.’*® However, there is
evidence that drilling mud and/or other wastes may have been generated by Perenco at
these sites, which indicates that Perenco must have used these mud pits, or that Perenco
failed to demonstrate that these pits are properly closed. These mud pits should, thus, have
been further investigated. This was particularly so, Ecuador contended, given Perenco’s
practice of building and using unreported pits (as admitted by Mr. Saltos to the Burlington

tribunal) that were never approved or even known to the Ecuadorian authorities.”*?

650.

651.

652.

Second, even within the 38 sites that were investigated, it is likely that the concentrations
detected in the mud pit contents by Mr. MacDonald were underestimated. Further, given
the uncertainty as to the actual dimensions of the pits investigated, these dimensions had
to be estimated and Mr. MacDonald had to be cautious when sampling so as “not to

penetrate the bottom of any mud pit,”7°

suggesting that the pits could, in fact, be deeper.
In addition, when the depth of the mud pits was not available from the record, Mr.
MacDonald assumed a depth of only 3.5 metres based on the average depth provided
certain mud pit closure records. The evidence shows that this assumption, however, is
insufficient to account for all the content of the pits needing remediation. For example, in

Coca 18-19, 4 pits built by Perenco were 4.5 metres deep.

(c) Groundwater

Ecuador points out that contrary to GSI’s conclusion that there was no groundwater
contamination in the Blocks, the groundwater was impaired by oilfield operations above
TULAS criteria for TPH and/or barium at all 12 sites investigated by Mr. MacDonald. This
confirmed that groundwater was adversely affected by Perenco’s oilfield operations and

warrants remediation.

Mr. MacDonald’s groundwater sampling campaign — which, Ecuador observed, was
monitored by both Parties’ experts — followed the highest industry standards, as confirmed
by the fact that its results are consistent throughout the samples collected using different
sampling methods (low-flow and RPPS).”*! Mr. MacDonald conducted his sampling
through permanent monitoring wells installed in accordance with industry best practices
and tested the resulting samples against the TULAS criteria. Ecuador argues that Mr.
MacDonald vindicates IEMS’ criticisms of GSI’s tactics to elude confirmation of

groundwater impacts in the Blocks.”

Ecuador’s Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 22.
Ibid., paragraph 22.

245

653.

654.

First, Ecuador considers that Mr. MacDonald’s groundwater monitoring well locations
complied with the Tribunal’s mandate. In arguing that Mr. MacDonald’s sampling
rationale was not be faithful to this mandate, Perenco misunderstands the mandate and the
objective pursued. As explained by the Expert, an “exact duplication of the program
previously implemented by the Parties would have provided a poor data set that would not
meet the Tribunal’s objectives [and] would also have cost three times as much to
execute." Further, only two monitoring wells, in Payamino 1 and Jaguar 2, are not
immediately adjacent to a prior IEMS or GSI monitoring well — and the adjustments of
these well locations were justified due to very high concentrations of TPH in soils at
Payamino 1 and weathered crude oil at Jaguar 2.” In any event, an impact on groundwater
was also identified at both sites in the monitoring wells that were installed in the vicinity
of IEMS’ and GSI’s monitoring wells, thus requiring groundwater remediation regardless

of the results of the monitoring wells whose location is criticized by Perenco.”>

Second, Ecuador observes that Mr. MacDonald installed 34 state-of-the-art permanent pre-
packed screened monitoring wells consistent with current industry practice to “address the
fine-grained subsurface conditions typically encountered in the Oriente Region of
Ecuador” and “to improve the quality of the sample by reducing its turbidity and ensuring
that samples collected from the well were representative of groundwater.” Mr.
MacDonald also took various precautions to prevent contamination from surface water

encroachment. Perenco’s allegation of potential soil contamination encroachment into the

Ibid., paragraph 25 and fn. 72: MacDonald’s 28 December 2017 letter to Perenco, p. 4 (PAY01-MW03 and
JAG02-MW03 “were installed in areas where the Parties had previously collected soil samples, and where
high levels of soil contamination were found by the Parties, but no wells had previously been installed [...].
Evidence of crude oil was also apparent at JAGO2-MW03. The lack of groundwater testing data within these
two contaminated areas would represent a serious data gap that would limit my ability to assess whether
groundwater contamination was present at these two affected sites.”), E-453.

750

monitoring wells through surface waters flatly contradict GSI’s position regarding the

impermeability of clay soils in the area.”4”

Third, Ecuador also observes that Mr. MacDonald measured hydrocarbons in groundwater
samples as per TULAS and duly considered — consistent with IEMS’ approach — the sum
of the GRO, DRO and ORO concentrations (whereas GSI compared the fractions
individually against the TULAS limit).”48

Fourth, Ecuador affirms Mr. MacDonald’s decision not to filter groundwater samples
which had been obtained using Rigid Porous Polyethylene (RPP) passive samplers and
low-flow sampling techniques. Notwithstanding Perenco’s objections, Mr. MacDonald’s
decision not to filter the samples was further corroborated by the similar analytical results

obtained for metals in passive and low-flow samples.”“?

Fifth, Mr. MacDonald’s decision not to exclude groundwater remediation based on soil
clay content is supported by TULAS. Ecuadorian regulations do not indicate that
groundwater in soils with greater than 25% clay and 10% organic matter should not be
remediated.’°° In any event, there is no available information regarding the organic matter
in the samples, hence, the cumulative conditions would not be met. Mr. MacDonald’s
decision is justified by the fact that he was able to extract groundwater from all monitoring
wells, confirming that the presence of clay in soil (even greater than 25%) does not make
soils impermeable. This confirms the high probability of that contaminated groundwater is
being used for drinking purposes by nearby communities and the need to ensure that such

groundwater is properly remediated.”>!

247

658.

659.

660.

In its closing submissions, Ecuador asserted that Perenco’s argument, namely, that clay

content in soil above 25% would not require remediation, *?

is based on a misplaced
reading of the TULAS regulation which focuses on clay percentage found in each
monitoring well as if they were isolated whereas Ecuadorian regulation seeks to protect
groundwater throughout all the locations with potentially usable groundwater.”? As Mr.
MacDonald testified, clay content can vary significantly over short distances within the

same location,”™4

it would not be logical to restore groundwater only in locations with less
than 25% clay as those areas would be re-contaminated by the contaminants in the un-

remediated adjacent areas.”>>

Ecuador also defends Mr. MacDonald’s using a laboratory analysis method which Perenco
argues could misidentify as TPH naturally occurring substances such as waxy leaves.’°°
First, Mr. MacDonald’s testing method was the same as that used by GSI (which has made
no prior complaint of the possibility that waxy organic matter could skew results). Second,
Perenco’s comparison between chromatograms of crude oil and dissolved phase organic
constituents is not appropriate. Third, Mr. MacDonald’s explanations about the detection
of petroleum hydrocarbons in his groundwater samples have been consistent and are

supported by substantial evidence. ’°

Ecuador’s own criticisms about Mr. MacDonald’s groundwater results are the following:
Ecuador points out that the Expert was limited to “confirm[ing] the presence or absence of
contamination.” The scope of his work was not designed to delineate the full extent of the
groundwater impairment in the sites. Hence, in order to determine the “potential extent of
groundwater contamination”, Mr. MacDonald used a predictive analytical tool. The

exercise performed, however, underestimates the full extent of groundwater impacts.”°* In

Payamino 13, for example, using the Groundwater Predictive Tool, Mr. MacDonald
estimated that the identified groundwater contamination could only migrate 1.6m (and
based the remediation costs on a plume dimension of only 1.6m). Yet, no identifiable
potential source of contamination exists within 1.6m of the impacted monitoring wells,
which confirms that the contamination had to migrate from a farther distance and the
remediation costs calculated by MacDonald are underestimated. In short, groundwater

contamination actually extends beyond the limited plume estimated by Mr. MacDonald.’*°

(d) Unit Costs

Ecuador considers that Mr. MacDonald’s current quantification of remedial costs is the
bare minimum. His estimate, which is in the conceptual phase, would be expected to be
less accurate than that developed at subsequent design stages for a remediation plan. With
the significant data gaps that remain to date, a contingency factor of 10% to 30% is

insufficient.”

That said, Ecuador defends Mr. MacDonald’s unit cost estimates as being consistent with

local quotes.7°!

While Perenco accuses Mr. MacDonald as only considering the US
RACER database and asserting that he relied on US-based costs as exhibited in that system,
Ecuador points out that Mr. MacDonald has repeatedly stated that he considered local costs
and submitted evidence of that.”°? RACER was only a litmus test. This is confirmed once
the Hidrogeocol quote is converted for a direct comparison with Mr. MacDonald’s estimate

— they are very similar.’

Ecuador further asserts that Perenco cannot argue that Mr. MacDonald’s unit costs are too
high on the basis of the Ecuambiente quote, Petroamazonas’ December 2018 contract with

Incinerox, or what was declared in Petroamazonas’ bond offering in 2006. First, the

Ecuambiente quote is too low. Second, the Petroamazonas’ contract is not one for
remediation. Third, the bond offering does not provide sufficient details to allow any

reliable conclusions to be drawn from it.”

Perenco also criticised Mr. MacDonald for not having prepared a bid package to establish
local costs. Ecuador points out that GSI also did not prepare a bid package and that did not
prevent them from quantifying the alleged remediation costs— this was admitted by Mr.

Bianchi during the Expert Hearing.’

Finally, Ecuador supported Mr. MacDonald’s proposed remediation technology for
groundwater, which was criticised by Perenco, as being an appropriate choice in the

circumstances. ”°°

2. Perenco’s Observations on the Independent Expert’s Findings

Perenco asserted that Mr. MacDonald’s volume and cost estimates were exaggerated.
Perenco argued further that the Independent Expert Report failed to address issues that the
Tribunal had directed Mr. MacDonald to study.’°7 For the issues that he did address, he
relied on unjustified assumptions instead of on scientific and historical data, erred in his

analyses, and disregarded Ecuadorian regulations and the Tribunal’s own directions.”

Despite the Tribunal’s instructions, Mr. MacDonald has not investigated the cause of the
exceedances, or, where there could be several causes, how to allocate responsibility to

Perenco or any other contributor. Thus, Mr. MacDonald’s US$160 million remediation

cost cannot be a figure for which Perenco alone should bear responsibility.”

In its submissions on the Tribunal’s Independent Expert Report, Perenco focused on what
it identified as nine significant deficiencies that have material financial consequences.’”°
In its closing submissions, Perenco grouped these issues into those relating to (1) soil
volumes, (2) mud pits, (3) groundwater and (4) unit costs.””! Correcting for these errors,
Perenco submitted that the overall remediation cost is no more than US$65 million, of

which only US$25 million can conceivably be allocated to Perenco.”””

Perenco also observed that while Mr. MacDonald “carried out work consistent with good
standards in many respects’, he did not have experience in the Oriente region and was not

a specialist in carrying out such projects in Ecuador.’

(a) Soil

(i) Land use classification

Perenco took issue with Mr. MacDonald’s land use classifications which it asserted was

29774

based on “visual inspection and which is not adequate.

First, Mr. MacDonald’s approach is contrary to the Tribunal’s direction that land use
classifications “should be guided by the Ecuadorian authorities’ practice in relation to the

Blocks” and that prior determinations by the Ecuadorian authorities have “significant

probative value.”7°

Perenco asserted that Ecuadorian authorities have repeatedly accepted the application of
“agricultural”, not “sensitive ecosystem’, criteria in areas surrounding platforms. IEMS

conceded this. TULAS further provides that agricultural lands include those “classified as

agricultural” even if they contain “native flora.”"”® Despite Mr. MacDonald’s assertions
to the contrary, his visual inspection conclusions conflicted with those of the Ecuadorian
authorities — two examples being Coca 6 and Mono CPF, where Ramboll chose ‘sensitive
ecosystem’ even though Ecuador’s own environmental impact studies acknowledged that
areas surrounding the platforms had to be remediated to agricultural standards despite being

surrounded by lush secondary forest.”””

Second, Perenco argues that Mr. MacDonald’s land use classifications reveal a lack of
proper spatial and temporal observations. Mr. MacDonald appears to have taken the
Tribunal’s guideline to apply a more stringent classification in any case of doubt as an
excuse to rely on superficial or perfunctory visual observation instead of conducting a
thorough investigation into how landowners and residents actually use the land over time.
This ignores the full scope of the Tribunal’s directions that land use classifications “should

be reasonable in the circumstances of the particular case.”"*

Perenco points to three examples which were misclassified as sensitive ecosystem: Coca
10-16, where an area just north of the platform that is within a stand of trees which is
actually surrounded by cleared agricultural plantations and a Petroamazonas pit farm;
Payamino 10, which is actually characterised by obvious agricultural activity, large swaths
of cleared areas and a pit farm which appears to contain approximately 20 pits; and Gacela
04, which is a huge Petroamazonas pipeline right of way (even Ramboll recognises that
“operating areas containing other in-use infrastructure” are industrial lands, not ‘sensitive
ecosystem’ )’”°.

Third, Mr. MacDonald also improperly designated “inactive” sites as sensitive ecosystem.
Perenco argued that the fact that a well is “inactive” indicates that it might be reactivated.

The Tribunal held that sensitive ecosystem does not apply to a site that is “expected to be

780

operated for many years to come . . . [and] still distant from any ‘posterior use.’”’*° Yet,
that is what Ramboll did for instance at Lobo 4 and Jaguar 7-8, which it called sensitive

ecosystem simply because the platforms are currently “inactive.”7*!

(ii) Background calculations

Perenco argued that Mr. MacDonald incorrectly excluded all of GSI’s samples of clean
soils to determine background concentrations while relying on ITEMS’ equivalent

samples. 7°

First, Mr. MacDonald’s exclusion of GSI’s background samples because “many” were
“collected in the immediate vicinity of certain platforms and proximate to areas investigated
for oilfield related impacts” directly contravened TULAS, which specifies that samples
should be taken in those areas immediately outside the area under study.’*? Proximity
should have been a qualifying, not a disqualifying, feature of GSI’s background samples.
Even if proximity were a concern, this could not justify a blanket exclusion of all 91 GSI
samples; Mr. MacDonald should also have applied the same threshold to IEMS’ samples,
some of which were even closer to the areas of study than GSI’s samples were.’** In any
event, in the six sites that both IEMS and GSI sampled for background, 50% of IEMS’s
samples are closer to the platforms than GSI’s samples — it cannot be that all of IEMS’s

background samples were uniformly valid whereas GSI’s were not.’*>

Second, the fact that Mr. MacDonald adopted GSI’s chromium background data derived
from GSI’s samples proves that the samples were not in fact “too close” to platforms. If

they had been “too close,” they could not have yielded valid chromium data either.’°°

790

Third, Ramboll’s exclusion of GSI’s background data because GSI “excluded a number of
sample concentrations identified as high outliers from their data sets” also makes no sense.
GSTI’s exclusion of what it considered to be high outlier samples made their background
concentrations more conservative. Even if Ramboll considered this approach to be
inappropriate, the proper response was to include the outlier samples, not exclude all non-
outlier samples. Indeed, Ramboll itself included the GSI outlier samples to run its statistical
test and also made exactly this kind of “correction” to the IEMS data, which it corrected to

account for “typographical/compilation errors” and non-detect results. ’°”

Fourth, Ramboll’s disregard of GSI’s background samples in the belief that they are drawn
from a different statistical “population” than IEMS’s background samples misapplies a
statistical tool.”** Perenco argues that what the data reflect is simply the fact that Block 7,
comprising more than 200,000 hectares and different geological zones, actually has many
subpopulations. Such exists even within IEMS’ own samples.”*? Mr. MacDonald should
not have rejected the GSI samples; even he acknowledged that more background samples

are better.”°°
(iii)Delineation

Perenco asserted that Mr. MacDonald’s delineations ignored the sites’ topography, active
equipment and site features, and its own clean soil samples. Thus, they were inconsistent

with the reality of the sites and result in over-estimating contamination. ””!

First, Mr. MacDonald’s “macro-delineation” approach ignored topography as well as
active equipment and site features. For instance, Ramboll’s delineation in Coca 6 included

a ridge bordering a drainage swale and assumed that contamination west of the ridge could

685.

somehow have extended all the way up the slope and over onto the top of the ridge.” In
Mono CPF, also shown below, Ramboll’s defined remediation area included production

facilities with a flare and API separator.’

Second, Mr. MacDonald’s delineation included remediation of areas where Ramboll’s
samples showed no exceedances or where Ramboll did not even take samples. An example
is Coca 02/CPF, where the delineated area included no detected exceedances at all and
includes a right-of-way pipeline that Petroamazonas constructed after GSI’s and IEMS’s
sampling campaigns.’ Perenco also pointed out that Mr. MacDonald’s delineation would
require remediation of ballast, which is not soil (e.g. in Jaguar 03), remediation of waste
disposal cells (e.g. Payamino Sanitary Landfill) or remediation of areas with no TPH

exceedances (e.g. Yuralpa CPF).”°

(b) Mud Pits

With respect to mud pits, Perenco argued that Ramboll ignored historical and visual
evidence of synthetic liners and as a result applied the wrong regulatory criteria (i.e., the
more stringent exceedance requirements for unlined mud pits) and exceeded the Tribunal’s
mandate and the Parties’ due process rights by sampling pits and that the Parties had not

previously sampled. ”°°

Perenco criticised Mr. MacDonald for assuming “without exception” that Perenco’s pits
were unlined, contrary to the Tribunal’s instruction to further investigate whether those pits

were closed with impermeable liners and to “ascertain whether the drilling muds were

disposed of in a properly constructed sealed pit.””°”

First, even though Mr. MacDonald claimed that drilling through the bottom of the mud pits
to confirm the existence of liners would have compromised the units if the liners were
present, Mr. MacDonald could have manually excavated a shallow portion around the edge
of the pit and ascertained the presence or absence of an impermeable liner on the interior

side slope of the excavation.”

Second, even when Ramboll observed visual evidence of liners at some mud pit perimeters,
it ignored that evidence because “it had no information regarding its condition or latent
extent” and “[p]hotographs taken by Perenco at the time of closure of some mud pits show
that an excavator was typically used to treat the mud pit material in place, which likely
would have resulted in the tearing or ripping of any liner material.””°? However, rather than
treat mud pit material in place, the record shows that Perenco often mixed mud in auxiliary
pits before transferring the muds to actual disposal pits, and the excavators were simply
used to place mud pit materials inside the pits. This practice would not have likely resulted
in the tearing or ripping of any liner material. Ramboll fails to consider this evidence at

all.6°

Third, Ramboll should have taken into account record evidence showing that a number of
Perenco’s pits have impermeable synthetic liners. Contrary to Ramboll’s claim that it was
“not provided any direct evidence as to whether liners are present for any specific mud pit,”
Perenco had submitted pit closure reports, photographs, and testimony demonstrating that
mud pits were lined with impermeable liners.*°! Perenco points to examples such as Oso
9, Coca 19 and Jaguar 9. Accordingly, several pits would meet the regulatory criteria and

would not require remediation.

Perenco also criticised Mr. Macdonald for investigating some pits that were outside of his
mandate and assuming that other pits contained exceedances without having sampled

them.

First, the Tribunal instructed Mr. MacDonald to sample sites which regulatory exceedances
had been identified by either or both of the Parties’ experts. However, Mr. MacDonald
sampled three pits in Oso 9B even though neither GSI nor IEMS went to this site. He also
sampled four pits in Oso 9A, even though the only soil sample, which was collected by
TEMS, showed no exceedances. Mr. MacDonald also sampled Yuralpa Sanitary Landfill
Pit 2 and Yuralpa G Pit 2, even though GSI and IEMS detected no exceedances at these
sites and did not gather any samples from these pits. Perenco argues that Ramboll exceeded
its mandate as it had investigated Oso 9A, Oso 9B, Oso 9 Pits 2 and 4, Yuralpa Sanitary
Landfill Pit and Yuralpa G Pit 2, which were not areas that had been previously investigated
or sampled by IEMS or GSI.*°? This was contrary to the direction in the Interim Decision
on Counterclaim and the mandate identified by Mr. MacDonald in his report®** These were

not areas that had been previously investigated or sampled by IEMS or GSI.°°

Second, contrary to the Tribunal’s instruction, Mr. MacDonald assumed that exceedances
existed in two mud pits in Oso 9 simply on the basis that the adjacent pits did not conform
to the leachate criteria for lined pits, without having taken any samples from those pits and
despite acknowledging that mud pits 2 and 4 were “not investigated by either the Parties or
Ramboll.”®°° This assumption is proven erroneous by Ramboll’s own sampling which

found that Pit 8 in Oso 9 met the performance criteria even though the adjacent Pit 9 did

not. As a result, these nine Oso pits and two Yuralpa pits should be excluded since they are

beyond the Tribunal’s mandate and there is no evidence of exceedances.*”

Further, Perenco argued, based on pit closure reports and other contemporaneous
documents, that there were liners present in properly closed pits at 18 of the mud pits in
five sites.°°® This implies that Perenco complied with RAOHE criteria at the time of
closure. Perenco has also proven that the mud pits, or at least some segment of them, had
intact liners at the time of installation and there is no legitimate specific evidence that there
is any problem with those.* Perenco also argued that IEMS’ field notes either recorded
references to Coca 4 and Payamino concrete pits, which were not made by Perenco, or
record employees as saying that the pits were lined and they had no reason to think there
were any problems with them or that they were leaking.*!° As for the use of excavators,

Perenco argued that it is common practice, which even Petroamazonas follows.

Third, Perenco argued that Mr. MacDonald’s mud pit remediation also suffered from the
following technical deficiencies: Ramboll’s remediation of mud pit 1 at Yuralpa Pad A,
where Ramboll disregarded RAOHE’s performance criteria and the pit would require no
remediation under the correct criteria (Perenco argued that Table 7b criteria applied)*!!;
Ramboll’s disregard of RAOHE’s instructions to test leachates for 6 PAHs (and instead
applied it to the sum of 16 PAHs)*!*; Ramboll’s finding that clean soil cover on pits needs
to be remediated even though it contains no exceedances;*!? and because Ramboll did not

have “specific mud pit dimensions” for the particular pits it sampled in Oso 9A and 9B, it

designated for remediation two entire pit farms comprising many pits, most of which

Ramboll had not even sampled.®!*

(c) Groundwater

With regard to groundwater, Perenco argues that Mr. MacDonald disregarded express
TULAS clay content criteria for groundwater samples and failed to recognise that its own
lab data shows that purported TPH exceedances were due to natural organic matter, not

crude oil.

First, Perenco argues that Ramboll disregards TULAS’ clay content rules and that TULAS
does not apply when clay content is above 25%. TULAS Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5
provides that the “reference quality criteria for groundwater” to which it applies are “soil
with clay content between (0-25.0%).” TULAS therefore does not provide specific criteria
for aquifers with higher clay and/or organic matter content; this means that soils with a clay
content higher than 25% (and an organic matter content of less than 10%) do not need to
comply with the TULAS Table 5 criteria and, accordingly, that exceedances of those
criteria do not constitute environmental harm if the soil has a clay content above 25%. This

was not disputed by IEMS.*!>

In this regard, Perenco further relies on Mr. Bianchi’s explanation given at the Expert
Hearing that the clay content rules are applied straightforwardly in Ecuador.*!®
Mr. MacDonald’s disapproval of the regulatory line drawn in Table 5 is not a valid basis
for the Tribunal to deny it and, Perenco argues, the Ecuadorian regulators’ decision to only
require low barium content in water with less than 25% clay is rational because people do
not drink water that has lots of clay or lots of organic material floating in it.*'’ It is a

compromise as part of the balanced development and balanced environmental approach

that Ecuador wants to take. In any event, IEMS’ first report and other evidence show that
groundwater is actually not the source of drinking water in this area and which may be

another reason why this regulation made sense in the way that it was phrased.*!®

Once groundwater samples with clay content over 25% are excluded, many of Ramboll’s

monitoring wells show no exceedances.

Second, Perenco observes that Mr. MacDonald’s groundwater results returned almost
ubiquitous TPH “hits”, even in areas where no TPH exceedances were identified in the
surrounding soil, and even in areas where neither IEMS nor GSI had ever encountered TPH
in their groundwater sampling. As Mr. MacDonald appeared to acknowledge, these
unexplained TPH exceedances are unusual and should have raised a red flag. In fact, the
type of test that Ramboll’s lab ran uses a method that is not specific to petroleum from
crude oil and can misidentify as TPH naturally-occurring substances like waxy leaves.
Ramboll’s failure to investigate this difference is especially problematic since waxy leaves
are common in the Ecuadorian jungle. Had Ramboll examined chromatograms for its
samples to determine whether they are really oilfield impacts or natural phenomena, it

would have seen that most of them are not crude oil at all.5!

Perenco also criticises Mr. MacDonald’s modelling tool for groundwater.*”° In the swampy
terrain and generally low-permeability soils of Blocks 7 and 21, groundwater moves very
slowly and cannot transport contaminants over significant distances, even over long time
periods. The modeling tool used by Ramboll and the sensitivity analysis conducted should,
by design, provide a conservative overestimate of the true plume dimensions. However,
Ramboll reached a surprisingly high remediation cost of $25 million for groundwater. This
incongruous result should, again, have prompted further analysis of Ramboll’s results.
Perenco points out three issues with Mr. MacDonald’s groundwater modelling: (i) he used

the three-dimensional version of the modelling software, instead of two-dimensional, it

would have predicted far smaller plumes at each site; (ii) his model does not account for
biodegradation of contamination over time and thus overestimates the size of the
groundwater plume; (iii) for a number of plumes reported by Ramboll, no source of the
plume could be identified, which is consistent with other factors that suggest that these

plumes are not present and are an artifact of faulty TPH results in some cases.

(d) Unit Costs

Perenco asserts that Ramboll’s unit costs for remediation do not reflect local costs. Ramboll
failed to consider actual costs spent by Petroamazonas itself for comparable remediation
work, even though the Tribunal had stated that such costs are the “best guide for estimating
comparable remediation works.”®?! Ramboll’s costs are inflated. Ramboll has failed,
contrary to the Tribunal’s directions in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim that
quantification must be based on actual Ecuadorian costs.*?? Perenco also complains that
Ramboll never provided a copy of its quote for groundwater and soil for the Parties’

verification.*

Moreover, for soil in particular, Ramboll’s unit costs bear no relationship to actual costs in
Ecuador, as shown in the two quotes that Ramboll belatedly obtained as well as in
Petroamazonas’ own public documents. Instead, Ramboll generated its soil remediation
numbers through RACER, which provides estimates based on remediation costs in the
United States.*™ This is in stark contradiction to the costs of Petroamazonas that they have

in an actual contract, which were achieved through an appropriate method.

First, Ramboll did not analyse evidence of local costs already in the record of this
proceeding or explain its basis for rejecting them. As GSI had explained, numerous
remediation projects have been completed at oilfield facilities in the Oriente region

pursuant to the requirements of RAOHE and/or TULAS and subject to review and approval

by the Ecuadorian authorities, including projects by Petroecuador and other oilfield
operators. At $410/m.} Ramboll’s gross unit rate for soil remediation substantially exceeds
all of these government-approved remediation projects. Whereas the Tribunal
acknowledged that GSI’s conservative bulk cost estimate for soil remediation of $260/m3
was “much closer” than IEMS’s to actual remediation costs in Ecuador, Ramboll’s figure

is inexplicably more than twice as high.

Second, Ramboll has ignored actual remediation costs incurred by Petroamazonas, which
are readily available in public documents. In December 2018, Petroamazonas signed a
contract for remediation works in Blocks 7 and 21, among others, that includes significantly
lower unit costs for soil remediation: for instance, $39/m3 for treatment and disposal of soil
with TPH and metals, compared to Ramboll’s $160/m. Similarly, in December 2017,
Petroamazonas issued a bond offering, according to which “[i]n 2016, Petroamazonas
incurred expenses of approximately $23.1 million for the implementation of Project
Amazonia Viva,” which included the remediation of “approximately 364,240 cubic meters
of soil[] and 191 sources of pollution” in certain blocks outside Blocks 7 and 21. These
figures imply a bulk unit cost of around $63/m3, while Ramboll’s corresponding bulk unit
cost of $410/m’ is six times higher. The magnitude of these discrepancies between actual,
recent, documented costs for work in the Blocks and surrounding areas, on the one hand,
and Ramboll’s software-generated black box estimate based on remediation in the United
States, on the other, are indicative of the unreliability of Ramboll’s overall approach and

the caution with which the Tribunal should treat it.

Third, Ramboll’s quotes from two local contractors, Hidrogeocol Ecuador and
Ecuambiente, are also not a reliable guide. Ramboll appears to have received the quotes in
late November and December 2018 —an entire year after it concluded the second sampling
campaign in Ecuador, and barely three weeks before Mr. MacDonald submitted the Report
to the Parties. Hidrogeocol’s unit cost for transportation and treatment of soil contaminated
with TPH and heavy metals amounts to $260/m}, six times higher than Petroamazonas’s

actual unit cost of $39/m? for comparable remediation work. Similarly, Ecuambiente’s unit

828,

cost for transportation and treatment of soils with just TPH is $56/m3 while
Petroamazonas’s actual unit cost is $46/m? for comparable remediation work. Ramboll
does not appear to have obtained a range of quotes from other contractors or to have taken
account of the fact that quotes initially provided to foreign companies —especially in a

litigation context— are typically higher.**°

Finally, despite having obtained these inflated quotes, no doubt because they were received
so late, Ramboll did not even apply them in calculating its remediation costs. Instead,
Ramboll increased certain kinds of unit costs based on no apparent reason other than its

unexplained “professional experience.” In circumstances where the Tribunal has held that

“the expert shall be guided by Ecuadorian costs”, that is not an acceptable approach.*?”

Ramboll’s remediation unit costs thus do not establish the actual local costs on which
remediation must be based, as the Tribunal determined. Instead, the Tribunal should apply
the actual costs recently incurred by Petroamazonas itself, which provide the “best guide
for estimating comparable remediation works.” Adjusting Ramboll’s estimated unit costs
to reflect Petroamazonas’s actual costs for soil reduces Ramboll’s soil unit costs by half.
Thus, Ramboll’s soil remediation cost falls from $98 million to $50 million simply by using
local costs, and to approximately $40 million after all technical corrections (before

allocation).°78

Causation and Double Recovery

While Mr. MacDonald was not instructed to investigate causation, in addition to their
comments and submissions with respect to Mr. MacDonald’s investigations and findings,
the Parties addressed this as well as the issue of double recovery in light of the Burlington
tribunal’s decision on Ecuador’s environmental counterclaim. The Parties’ arguments are

set out below.

1. Ecuador’s arguments

Ecuador submits that the Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim is clear that the
burden of proof is on Perenco.*”? Therefore, if there is a regulatory exceedance, Perenco is
responsible unless it can prove that some other person or an external event caused harm.
Perenco has failed to discharge this burden of proof and therefore should be liable, at the

very least, for the contamination confirmed by Mr. MacDonald in Blocks 7 and 21.

First, insofar as alleged contamination caused by operators prior to its assuming operations
in Blocks 7 and 21, Perenco has failed to prove that the extensive contamination confirmed
by Mr. MacDonald was already present in the Blocks when it assumed operations in

2002.83!

Perenco failed to point to documentary evidence confirming its theory that contamination
would have been caused by prior operators: (i) Perenco failed to conduct a comprehensive
written study of the environmental condition of the Blocks at the time of acquisition; (ii)
neither the PSA entered into Perenco and Kerr-McGee nor Perenco’s 2002 Biennial Audit
suggested major environmental problems at the time; and (iii) even Perenco’s 2006 and
2008 superficial and highly selective biennial audits showed a steep decline of the

environmental conditions of the Blocks.**

Perenco cannot attribute the contamination to prior operators (which were limited to 23
sites only). Ecuador’s responses to Perenco’s allegations for five of these sites are as
follows: (i) evidence on record shows that the contamination in Payamino 2-8 dates from
the time of Perenco’s operations; (ii) the exceedance in the swampy area southeast of Coca
CPF was associated with discharge of produced water with oil residue from the API
separator during Perenco’s operations, as confirmed by Mr. MacDonald and acknowledged

by Mr. Salto before the Burlington tribunal; (iii) 1999 spill in Coca 6 migrated to the

southwest of the platform, whilst the area to be remediated identified by Mr. MacDonald
is located to the southeast of the platform; (iv) the Burlington tribunal held Perenco
responsible for the remediation of the Coca 8 pit; and (v) GSI inspected the pit in Payamino
4 and attested that there was no leakage — therefore, any contamination could not be related

to this pit.4*

With respect to Perenco’s denial of liability for 19 sites based on a “simplistic argument”
that the exceedances in these sites mostly related to heavy metals and pit areas and therefore
were caused by drilling pre-dating its operatorship, Ecuador argues that this assumption is
unsupported.**4 For example, Perenco argues that barium exceedances could only arise
from original drilling activities. However, Perenco conducted numerous workovers and its
admitted practice of transporting drilling muds from one site to another for storage, both of
which are likely to have caused the exceedances found.*** In Yuralpa A, Perenco itself also
drilled in the period 2003-2006 and should know whether its drilling caused contamination
on this site.**° There were also numerous unreported oil spills during Perenco’s operations
and there is no evidence that these were properly remediated.**’ Perenco now accepts that
at least part of the contamination in Jaguar 1 was caused by an unreported spill during the
time of its operations and it drilled in Coca 19 in 2003, where Mr. MacDonald confirmed

soil contamination and non-conforming Perenco-associated pits.***

Moreover, if Perenco really wanted to identify the cause and timing of the TPH
exceedances found, it could have conducted (as it had an ample opportunity to do pre- and

post-July 2009) a hydrocarbon fingerprinting analysis or other laboratory forensic

technique. At the least, the tests would be able to show whether a particular release was

fresh or very dated such that it would be pre- or post-Perenco operations.*°°

Further, Perenco inherited all environmental liability for any pre-existing conditions

present in the Blocks.*4°

Ecuador submits further that Perenco-associated pits were found to be non-compliant at all
of the sites investigated by MacDonald.**! This finding is unsurprising and confirms that
Perenco’s poor practices extend to its location, construction, use and management of pits.
There can, thus, be no doubt, that these exceedances are attributable to Perenco. Ecuador
further argues that Perenco is liable, at the very least, for the complete remediation of all
the mud pits investigated by Mr. MacDonald because: (i) Perenco has the burden of proof
regarding the placement of proper pits as it would have such records, but has failed to

discharge it;*"? and (ii) there were many more mud pits that Mr. MacDonald should have,

but did not, investigate.*4?

Second, with respect to alleged contamination caused by Petroamazonas (“PAM”) after it
assumed operations in Blocks 7 and 21, Perenco is not able to prove that any contamination
identified by Mr. MacDonald is attributable to Petroamazonas. Perenco has referred to only
one incident at Mono CPF in 2011 that that would allegedly be the source of the
contamination in one of the areas in that site. However, the limited contents of that 2011
spill make their way to the opposite end of the platform due to the terrain gradient (i.e., the
northeast and not the southeast of the platform, where the contaminated area confirmed by
Mr. MacDonald is located), but it is also chronologically impossible for the contamination
delineated by the Expert to result from a 2011 PAM spill, given that, already during their
first field campaign in October 2010, IEMS had collected samples showing TPH

exceedances in the same area as Mr. MacDonald.*“4 Other than this isolated incident,
Perenco’s only other claim is that Petroamazonas’ new works overtook areas at 9 other

sites. 845

In any event, the evidence on record, including the documents recently disclosed by
Ecuador, confirms that Petroamazonas neither caused nor contributed to the contamination.
First, 11 of the sites and all the pits identified for remediation have not been operated or
used by Petroamazonas.**° Second, as Mr. MacDonald performed a gap filling exercise,
the contamination he found is the same identified by IEMS (and others, like Walsh and
GSI) since 2010. Third, none of those who conducted inspections from 2010 to 2017
observed any environmental incidents after July 2009 and Mr. MacDonald’s report does
not mention any signs of recent contamination observed during Ramboll’s
investigations.**” Fourth, documents recently produced by Ecuador confirm that there were
no incidents reported during Petroamazonas’ operations in 30 sites identified for
remediation. For those sites where an incident occurred, those incidents could not be the
cause of the harm as they occurred at different locations from Mr. MacDonald’s

remediation locations and were, in any event, promptly remediated by Petroamazonas.*#®

In response to the Tribunal’s invitation for comments regarding a possible general
discounting factor to account for Petroamazonas’ possible contribution to the

environmental harm,**? Ecuador makes the following two submissions.

First, as set out above, Petroamazonas has neither caused nor contributed to the harm

identified by Mr. MacDonald, and save for two areas in Coca CPF and Coca 1, none of the

areas identified for remediation were overtaken by Petroamazonas’ new works.*°°

Perenco’s complaint that Ecuador has failed to disclose some of Petroamazonas’ spills
relates to spills either introduced by Ecuador into the record, outside the scope of the
Tribunal’s order for document production or were addressed in Ecuador’s letter of 11

March 2019 and now also part of the record.**!

Second, careful consideration should be given to how the Tribunal determines a
discounting factor if nonetheless the Tribunal were still minded to grant it. Ecuador
anticipates difficulties and perverse incentives if the Tribunal were to allocate
responsibility for groundwater based on the amount of time that each operator ran the
Blocks because: (i) this rewards an operator who concealed the existence of contamination
for years and tactically seeks to deny liability such that it would be able to share

responsibility with the next operator;*>

(ii) a linear time-based rule would unfairly impose
exclusively on Ecuador the burden of the time taken by Mr. MacDonald for completing his
report; and (iii) this assumes the same amount of contamination is generated every year
regardless of each operator’s practices, but the Tribunal cannot assume that Petroamazonas

operates under the same low standards employed by Perenco.*°?

Finally, Ecuador confirms that it is not seeking double recovery for the environmental harm
in the Blocks. It submits that Mr. MacDonald has not found the “same harm” as the
Burlington tribunal and Perenco, therefore, remains liable for the additional and/or
different remedial areas, volumes and costs. In its submissions, Ecuador provided a site-
by-site comparison of areas, depth, volumes and costs to identify overlaps adopting a
conservative approach. Its accompanying explanations specific to soil, mud pits and

groundwater are as follows.

Soil: no overlap can exist in relation to (i) sites for which the Burlington tribunal did not
award any remedial costs; (ii) sites where Mr. MacDonald delineated different areas; (iii)
sites or areas where Mr. MacDonald’s sampling has confirmed contamination extends

beyond or deeper than the Burlington tribunal’s findings; (iv) sites or areas where the

726.

horizontal and vertical extent of the contamination estimated by Mr. MacDonald and the
Burlington tribunal are similar, but for which Mr. MacDonald estimates higher remediation

costs.

Mud pits: the Burlington tribunal awarded only US$11,106,050 for the remediation of
mud pits at five sites (two of which were not considered by the Expert). Conversely, Mr.
MacDonald concluded that (i) additional mud pits warrant remediation, and (ii) higher
remediation costs — with respect to those awarded by the Burlington tribunal — would be
required for remediating mud pits at Condor Norte (US$2,484,000 by Mr. MacDonald v.
US$1,070,000 in Burlington) and the Payamino WTS (US$2,978,000 by Mr. MacDonald
v. 2,025,000 in Burlington). Hence, Perenco is liable for the higher remediation costs at
Céndor Norte and Payamino WTS (i.e., US$2,367,000) as well as the full remediation costs

estimated for non-compliant mud pits at 11 sites.

Groundwater: the Burlington tribunal awarded only US$5,040,000 for groundwater
remediation at Coca CPF, Payamino 14/20/24 and Payamino 15 (i.e., US$1,680,000 per
site). Conversely, Mr. MacDonald concluded that nine additional sites require groundwater
remediation and estimated higher costs for the remediation of Coca 2/CPF (US$3,001,000
by Mr. MacDonald v. US$1,680,000 in Burlington). Perenco is, therefore, liable for the
difference in groundwater remediation costs for Coca 2/CPF (US$1,321,000) as well as the

full remediation costs estimated by Mr. MacDonald for the nine additional sites.

Finally, as it pertains to the well abandonment costs claimed by Ecuador for the seven sites
in Perenco’s November 2008 Well Site Abandonment Plan that it never carried out (and
that PAM has never operated), Ecuador is entitled to any abandonment costs in addition to

the US$929,722 granted by the Burlington tribunal.

Based on Ecuador’s calculations, therefore, it is entitled to recover US$130,801,100 from

Perenco.**4

2. Perenco’s arguments

In sum, Perenco argues that it cannot be liable at all for harm it did not cause; it cannot be
solely liable for harm to which others contributed; and it certainly cannot be presumed to
be liable for any conditions observed in the Blocks only years after its departure.*°> The
fact that sampling found exceedances in Blocks 7 and 21 many years after Perenco’s
investment there was expropriated is not proof that Perenco caused those exceedances, and

without proof of causation, there simply is no liability.

Perenco argues that the Tribunal decided in its Interim Decision on Counterclaim that the
“onus of proof is on a party who makes an allegation” and that it is Ecuador who must
disprove that Petroamazonas caused exceedances.**® Ecuador’s failure to do so cannot be
remedied by presuming causation.**’ Perenco can only be prima facie liable for
exceedances identified during Perenco’s operatorship and can relieve itself of liability by

demonstrating that someone else caused the harm. This must mean that Petroamazonas as

729.

730.

731.

the current operator is strictly liable for harm save insofar as it can demonstrate that, in this

case, Perenco, caused the harm.

There is no more reason to presume that Perenco, as one of several past operators, is liable
for conditions identified years after it was ousted than to presume that any other prior
operator is liable for them.*** It would be unjust to do so when Petroamazonas has
extensively developed the Blocks, turned forests into pit farms, dug up soils designated for
remediation to make rights-of-way for new pipelines, and experienced dozens of spills that
were only recently disclosed and even more which were not.*°? There are also no inequities

on the facts of the case that justifies the shifting of the burden of proof to Perenco.

According to Perenco, the adjustment of Ramboll’s remediation costs for causation would

reduce those costs by almost a third.

First, most of the identified exceedances were caused by prior operators: (i) exceedances
identified by Ramboll are largely associated with barium which in turn is associated with
drilling that occurred prior to Perenco’s operatorship — Perenco did not drill wells in many
of the sites where soil exceedances were detected, including seven of the eight “inactive”
sites that the Tribunal had identified; (ii) at least some of the TPH exceedances also stem
from Ecuador’s or other operators’ tenure, e.g. Payamino 2-8, where a major environmental
incident occurred during CEPE’s operatorship, or Coca 6, where major spills occurred in
1999 and later in 2011; (iii) that is likewise the case for groundwater at sites where Ramboll
identified barium exceedances, which can only be causally related to production well
drilling, but where Perenco did not drill wells; and incidents that may have led to TPH
contamination did not occur during Perenco’s operations, e.g. Payamino 4-14, where
Perenco did not drill wells and no TPH were identified in the 2011-2013 sampling

campaigns.

Ibid., paragraph 12.
Ibid., paragraph 17.

271

732.

733.

734.

735.

Second, for the sites where Perenco may have contributed to the exceedances, there will
inevitably be difficulties in allocating liability between Perenco and Ecuador. Perenco
submits that the application of a discounting factor based on length of operatorship may be
appropriate for both soil and groundwater. Such a discounting factor must, however, take
into account the full history of operations at the given site, and cannot begin simply in
2002. The effluxion of time alone means that, for example, for groundwater, more than

70% of the remediation costs must be allocated to Ecuador.**!

Third, for mud pit remediation, the Tribunal recognised that Perenco’s liability is limited
to the contents of the mud pits that Perenco built and used. Perenco cannot be held solely
liable, however, for pit cover material (which Ramboll has treated as ordinary soil) that
shows near-surface exceedances unrelated to Perenco’s drilling of the associated wells.*
Perenco further notes that there were mud pits which were already closed by the time of

Perenco’s operations. *°

Perenco submits that it is not surprising that Perenco contributed to only a fraction of the
issues identified in the Blocks. Environmental standards and practices were different in the
1980s and 1990s than they were during Perenco’s operatorship.*™ Perenco’s involvement
in the Blocks was comparatively limited, both in time and in nature. Perenco’s tenure lasted
less than seven years compared to the 49 years that Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino Unified
Field have been in operation and 47 years for some areas in Block 21. Petroamazonas has
since developed the Blocks far more aggressively and has more than doubled the impact

that Perenco could have.
Perenco proposes that the following principles of allocation be adopted:

(a) Pits: 100% attributed to Perenco;

Ibid., paragraph 18.

Ibid., paragraph 19.

736.

737.

867

(b) Groundwater: allocation by ratio of time;

(c) Soil: in summary, according to the type of soil exceedance, which might be
categorized as follows: (i) barium only or barium with other metals (but no TPH);
(ii) barium with TPH only (no other metals); (iii) barium, TPH and other metals;
(iv) TPH only (no barium, no other metals) or other metals only (no barium, no
TPH).*°°

The application of these principles would result in remedial costs of US$25,600,465:°°7

Perenco submits that this is reasonable and likely high. Its proposed methodology: (i)
adjusts soil volumes at only 16 of Ramboll’s 49 sites; (ii) allocates to Perenco 60% of the
cost for Payamino 2-8; (iii) allocates to Perenco full responsibility for barium exceedances
at sites Perenco drilled, even though Petroamazonas may have done workovers there; (iv)
allocates to Perenco full responsibility for mud pits it built or used, even though approved
pit closure reports show there was no fault, and even though Petroamazonas may also have
used them; (v) allocates to Perenco its share of responsibility for metals-only exceedances,

even if there is no barium or TPH to link them to oil operations; and (v) includes a cost

contingency of up to 30%, despite Ramboll having filled gaps with another thousand

samples.5®

Perenco submits that this figure of US$25 million should be further adjusted in light of the
Consortium’s US$42 million settlement payment. This payment must be deducted from the
total remediation cost to avoid double recovery. This would lead to an award of zero

damages if all adjustments are applied.*?

Even if the corrected unit costs allocated to Perenco were to exceed US$42 million, the
Tribunal should order that Ecuador cannot simply offset any such residual remediation cost
from the damages it owes to Perenco, but that it must deposit that amount, along with its
share of the overall remediation costs, in a remediation fund that Ecuador must use solely
for the purpose of remediating the Blocks.*” This is the only way to ensure that the
Tribunal’s objective of protecting the environment is truly achieved, that Ecuador fulfills
its promises to use the funds to remediate, and that the entire counterclaims process is not
subverted for Ecuador’s opportunistic monetary gain, it should not reduce Perenco’s

damages but be paid into a remediation fund.*”!

The Tribunal’s Analysis

1. The Tribunal’s view of the Expert’s work

As can be seen from the summary of the Parties’ submissions, many issues were raised by
one Party or the other which bear upon the quantification of damages. The Tribunal

considers that these ranged from the important to the irrelevant.*”* To the extent that the

Id.

As an example of the latter, the Tribunal saw no value in Perenco's attempt to diminish the Expert's work by
reason of his lack of prior experience in Ecuador. It was the Parties themselves who identified, interviewed,
and proposed Mr. MacDonald to the Tribunal. Both Parties were aware of his experience, which is extensive,
and includes work in other Latin American countries. The fact that he had not previously worked in Ecuador:
is of no import or relevance.

274

TAL.

742.

874

Tribunal does not expressly deal with an issue raised by a Party, that does not mean that it

has not been considered.

To begin, the Tribunal addresses the overall quality and reliability of the Report. The
Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. MacDonald and his team from Ramboll acted impartially and
independently and with a high level of technical proficiency. Mr. MacDonald began his
work by performing an intensive data review exercise in order to familiarise himself with
the work previously done by the Parties’ experts and with the Tribunal’s findings in the
Interim Decision on Counterclaim.’ During his testimony at the Expert Hearing, he
indicated that he also consulted local advisors and counsel in Ecuador in an effort to fully
inform himself of the regulatory regime so as to be able to discharge his mandate. *7* When
it came to estimating remediation costs, Mr. MacDonald engaged a local consultant,

Hidrogeocol Ecuador, to assist in obtaining quotations for remedial work.’”>

Although the Tribunal addressed the principal issues of Ecuadorian environmental law in
the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, certain secondary issues remained to be addressed
by the Expert in discharging his mandate. The Tribunal considers that he made reasonable
decisions within the framework of Ecuadorian environmental law and administrative

practice.

Consolidated Expert Report, p. 2: “My findings and opinions are based upon documents provided by the
Tribunal and the Parties, as listed in Section 8.0, supplemented by my visits to representative sites in Blocks
7 and 21 during October/November 2016 and again during fieldwork performed in the fall of 2017. I also
relied upon various regulatory documents, standards, and scholarly and technical publications that are
applicable to this matter. Finally, under my direction, Ramboll generated independent data and performed
the relevant technical analyses to close significant data gaps in the investigation of soils and generated a
technically valid data set to replace prior groundwater data gathered by the Parties. Under my direction,
Ramboll also conducted work needed to document the compliance status of mud pits previously used by
Perenco with applicable Ecuadorian regulations."

Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 269:15-19: “...I was not precluded from reading the regulations,
interpreting them, nor of having conversations with other consultants in Ecuador, including environmental
counsel where I was pushing and probing.”

878,

Mr. MacDonald and Ramboll conducted the sampling exercise transparently and
considered suggestions made by the Parties’ experts and representatives.” The

Consolidated Independent Expert Report noted in this regard:

“Tt is important to note that the Parties have had the opportunity to pose
questions and comment on my work throughout this engagement,
including before and during the performance of the field campaign. In
addition, representatives of the Parties were present during all onsite
activities, including the initial exploratory visit to the Blocks as well as
during the performance of sample mark-outs and collection of samples
from all investigated media. The field program was implemented over a
four-month period and issues raised by the Parties during that time were
always considered; in certain cases, my approach was adjusted to
incorporate expanded information or to address concerns (when these were
reasonable and technically valid). It was not always possible to reach full
agreement with both Parties, as their commitments to their clients and
strategic approaches differed from my own. However, in all cases, a
respectful dialogue was established with both Parties, and to my
knowledge neither expressed concerns regarding bias for or against either
Party in this matter. Relevant correspondence, emails, and other
documentation of this dialogue between the Parties and myself or field
personnel is included in Appendix B.”*””

Mr. MacDonald acknowledged that he did not accept every suggestion from a Party, but
that is hardly surprising, given how far apart the Parties’ experts were in their own
approaches and findings.*”* Moreover, again unsurprisingly, in a few instances, due to

technical considerations, he chose not to precisely replicate a location at a site where one

Mr. MacDonald noted that: "there was significant communications with the Parties, both legal counsel, as
well as their Experts, in advance of the site work. There were frequent briefings with the Parties during the
site work, all right, routine written and verbal communications responding to questions and careful
consideration of all matters raised by the Parties, with adjustments made where we thought reasonable and
appropriate." Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 21:21-22:7. See also his Direct Presentation, Slide 4,
where he adverted to communications with the Parties before the site work was conducted, frequent briefings
with the Parties during the site work, routine written and verbal communications to respond to questions or:
concerns raised by the Parties, and consideration of all matters raised by the Parties, with adjustments made
where reasonable.

 

 

Consolidated Expert Report, Section 1.3.

Ibid., p. 1: “The underlying technical investigations performed by each Party were based on differing
conceptual frameworks, with Ecuador taking a more traditional due diligence approach with Phase II site
investigation activities, while Perenco performed follow-up confirmatory, delineation and/or risk assessment
studies. Further, in several cases, the Parties interpreted applicable regulations in different ways, conducted
their fieldwork and data analysis using inconsistent protocols, and where similar remedial approaches were
considered, developed dissimilar cleanup costs. Together, the investigations and evaluations did not provide
the Tribunal with an adequate or consistent set of facts that could be used in their deliberations.”

or the other of the Parties’ experts had taken a particular sample; this was the case in

relation to two groundwater monitoring wells (at PAY01-MW03 and PAY04-MW03).°”?

The Parties were, as already noted, given an opportunity to make written submissions and
insert comments into the Independent Expert Report. They were also given the opportunity
to cross-examine Mr. MacDonald on both days of the two-day Expert Hearing. Mr.

MacDonald was a careful, credible, knowledgeable and objective expert witness.

The Tribunal notes further that the Parties collected “split groundwater samples.”**° The
Parties were thus free to employ their own laboratory analyses to check the Expert’s results.
Although both Parties have criticisms of the Report (Perenco being more critical of his
work than Ecuador), with one significant exception,**! neither Party challenged the results

of the laboratory testing.**? The Tribunal therefore considers that the handling of the

See Consolidated Expert Report, p. 68 — at two sites, the parties had not installed wells at locations- previous
placement was not appropriate and adjusted the locations, i.e. Pay01-MW03 in REC 66 and JAGO2-MW03.
See also the letter of 28 December 2017 which states that 65% of groundwater wells were proposed in the
immediate vicinity of wells previously installed by one or both Parties. Are located next to wells — 22/34 of
the proposed wells. For 12 of 34 locations at nine sites, 5 were placed within site areas that were previously
subjected to groundwater testing, but not at the exact locations of prior wells: 4 were located in areas with
significant data gaps; 3 were placed near prior wells that had been previously installed within mud pits and
to correct for contamination.

 

The only qualification to this statement concerns the taking of groundwater samples where it was necessary
due to the low flow rate for the splitting of the samples to be done sequentially. Thus, by agreement of the
Parties, the Expert took the first sample from a particular groundwater well, the second sample went to IEMS
and the third sample went to GSI. See Expert's Direct Presentation, Slide 67.

Perenco alleged that the type of test that Ramboll’s laboratory used to detect total petroleum hydrocarbons
(TPH; sum of GRO, DRO and MRO), was “not specific to petroleum from crude oil" and "known to
misidentify naturally-occurring plant waxes and insoluble paraffin wax, which fall in the same carbon range
as petroleum on this analysis" and that there were stark differences between his analysis and what GSI found.
The Expert addressed this during his Direct Presentation, starting at Slide 67, which noted that “Neither IEMS
nor GSI has made their data available, nor provided necessary detail; thus, cannot comment on what is
described as remarkably different results.” Both Parties collected split ground water samples as part of
Ramboll’s 2017 field campaign, but their analytical data from that split sampling was never provided to the
Expert by either Party so that the allegedly “stark differences” could be evaluated by him. In addition, the
testing method used (EPA Method SW-8015C) was agreed to by both Parties in advance and had been used
previously by GSI in its work.

The Tribunal considers such issues as the Parties’ disagreements over Mr. MacDonald’s treatment of
background criteria, combining (or not) of data sets, use of the “upper predictive limit” method, the
“chromatogram issue”, the use of inference, predictive tools, macro-delineation, and contingencies to
estimate the extent of contamination (and sensitivity analyses to confirm estimates), the merits and demerits
of different methods of compositing soil samples, and so on to fall squarely within the province of expertise

samples, from extracting them at site through to transporting them to ALS, and their further
analysis in Houston, Texas, was conducted in accordance with best practices and therefore

rendered the technical evaluation of the samples valid, accurate and reliable.

To be sure, like the Parties, the Tribunal had questions about certain decisions taken by the
Independent Expert. This was inevitable, given the manifold uncertainties inherent in
estimating a single operator’s legal responsibility for its slice of contamination that resulted
from oilfield operations conducted in some parts of the Blocks for many years (particularly
in Block 7 and the Coca-Payamino unified field).*** The Tribunal’s views on the Expert’s

determination of certain disputed issues is addressed below.

In the course of its deliberations, the Tribunal reviewed the Consolidated Independent
Expert Report, the Parties’ separate written submissions, as well as the testimony and
closing submissions given at the Expert Hearing. Most of the questions and objections that
the Parties have raised concern technical matters that fall within the Expert’s expertise and
judgement and the Tribunal considers that it is not appropriate to second-guess his technical
determinations. That is why he was appointed in the first place: to provide, in an objective
and neutral fashion, the expertise and judgement which the Tribunal considered the Parties’

experts had failed to provide.

The Tribunal therefore considers that it is necessary for it to deal only with two major sets
of issues. The first set of issues concerns how to determine Perenco’s share of the
responsibility for remediating the contamination in the Blocks (as between Perenco and its
predecessors and successor). The second set of issues concerns the scope of the Expert’s

mandate and whether he acted consistently with it.

and interpretation of results. These are quintessentially technical matters that the Expert dealt with and the
Tribunal accepts his views on these matters.

2. Causation and attribution of responsibility

Mr. MacDonald’s estimation of the cost of remediating the “total measured

contamination”**4 in Blocks 7 and 21 amounts to US$159,881.00.8°> The central question

for the Tribunal is how much of this contamination is Perenco’s responsibility.**°

The Tribunal considered that the Expert’s work should be focused on estimating the total
measured contamination in the Blocks, leaving it to the Tribunal to decide the issues of
causation and the resulting division of responsibility for remediation costs as between

Perenco and other operators.**”

The Interim Decision on Counterclaim made the following findings on how Perenco’s

responsibility would be fixed:

“While it [the Tribunal] agrees with Perenco that it cannot presume that
Perenco is the author of all harm that has been detected, once a regulatory
exceedance resulting from a potentially hazardous activity is shown,
Perenco is prima facie responsible therefor.**

The Tribunal is thus inclined to employ a strong rebuttable presumption
that if there is a regulatory exceedance, that in itself is evidence of fault.
Any alternative approach would make it too onerous for a claimant
because it would likely lack sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the
operator failed in its duty of care in many if not most instances in which
regulatory exceedances have occurred. The Tribunal considers that
regulatory exceedances are indicative of operational failures and therefore
should be taken as falling below the standard of care.**°

By “total measured contamination”, the Tribunal means that amount of contamination which the Expert
defined from prior investigations and his sampling in the Blocks as per the instructions of the Tribunal. Due
to the limitations on his mandate, it is not to be taken as a complete estimation of total contamination in the
Blocks because there could be contamination that was not detected by either of the Parties’ experts and Mr.
MacDonald was restricted to working on the sites that they had examined.

Independent Expert Report, Table 6.11. Summary of Remedial Cost Estimates.

Throughout this section of the Award, the Tribunal di: different operators’ “responsibility.” Of course,
the Tribunal only has Perenco and Ecuador before it. It can identify contamination which is attributable to
the acts of Perenco’s predecessors, but it lacks jurisdiction to assess damages payable by non-parties to the
arbitration.

      

Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 591: “... the Tribunal recognises that the conditions likely to
exist in 2015 might have been affected by the actions of Petroamazonas. It might therefore be necessary for
the Tribunal to determine Perenco’s share of any responsibility for contamination in order to ensure that it is
not made responsible for the acts of Petroamazonas.”

In sum, if a regulatory exceedance occurred, Perenco is to be taken to have
fallen below the requisite duty of care and will be held liable unless it can
prove on a preponderance of evidence: (i) an occurrence of a force majeure
event; (ii) that it did not fall below the standard of care in respect of that
specific instance of contamination; or (iii) that some other person caused
the harm.”*° [Emphasis added.]

In its comments on the Independent Expert Report and at the Expert Hearing, Perenco
focused mainly on persuading the Tribunal that other operators are responsible for most of
the contamination that has been determined by the Expert. Perenco’s case was that its
seven-year operatorship was sandwiched between other operations conducted by other
operators for longer periods of time and therefore most of the damage found by the Expert

must be attributed to those operators.

First, Perenco argued that most of the identified exceedances were attributable to prior
operators because barium, which is associated with drilling, was identified and most of the
well drilling occurred prior to Perenco’s operatorship. Perenco also argued that at least
some of the TPH exceedances stemmed from Ecuador’s or other operators’ tenures, during

which major incidents had occurred.*?!

Second, for sites where it is difficult to allocate liability between Perenco and Ecuador,
Perenco submitted that the application of a discounting factor based on length of
operatorship may be appropriate, taking into account the full history of operations at a given

site. °°

Third, Perenco accepted its liability with regard to the contents of the mud pits that it had
built and used. However, it contended that it cannot be held solely liable for pit cover

material that showed near-surface exceedances unrelated to Perenco’s drilling of the

associated wells.*°? It also denied liability for mud pits which were already closed by the

time of Perenco’s operations.***

At paragraph 735 above, the Tribunal has reproduced Perenco’s proposed principles for

allocating responsibility and they will not be repeated here.*>

Ecuador took a very different view from Perenco, arguing that Perenco was under a duty

to maintain the Blocks in good condition, which included remediating any environmental

incidents as well as properly locating and constructing and/or closing mud pits.**°

However, Perenco “ran low-cost operations focused on extracting all the crude it could as

fast as possible and at minimum cost, in complete disregard of the environment.”*””

Ecuador argued that Perenco had failed to prove that the contamination (which was a

minimum estimate**) was caused by prior operators or by Petroamazonas.

First, according to Ecuador, contemporaneous documents did not show environmental
issues in the Blocks when Perenco took over. They also showed that the conditions of the
Blocks declined and incidents occurred during Perenco’s operatorship.*”? Further,
Perenco’s argument attributing responsibility to other operators based on barium was
unsupported*” and in any event, could have been caused by Perenco’s workovers and

transporting of drilling muds for storage.°! Perenco could have done tests to assess the

Ibid., Slide 93.

Ecuador’s Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 2: “Such
extensive contamination obviously came as no surprise to Perenco, given its previously established sub-
standard management of the Blocks, the numerous spills and other environmental incidents during its
operatorship, its inadequate steps (to the extent undertaken) to remediate these incidents, its practice of
concealing (or, at the very least not reporting) such incidents to the authorities, its inadequately located,
constructed and/or closed mud pits, and its general failure to properly maintain the Blocks’ facilities,
including the flowlines, pipelines and tanks containing crude oil.”

Ibid., paragraph 2.

As Ecuador stated in its comments in the Consolidated Expert Report, p. 22: “MacDonald's conclusions
should thus be viewed as the minimum discovered remedial needs."

timing of TPH exceedances (but it did not do so). In addition, incidents occurring prior to
Perenco’s operatorship occurred outside Mr. MacDonald’s remediation locations.” In any
event, Perenco inherited all environmental liability for any pre-existing conditions present

in the Blocks.°°

Ecuador argued further that Perenco also cannot attribute contamination to Petroamazonas
because 11 of the sites and all mud pits identified for remediation were not operated or used
by Petroamazonas.””* Mr. MacDonald’s gap-filling exercise confirmed the contamination
found by IEMS and there were no new contamination incidents observed either during
post-July 2009 inspections or by Ramboll.*® Incidents occurring during Petroamazonas’
operatorship took place at different locations or were such that they could not have caused

the contamination found, and in any event, were promptly remediated.?”°

Second, Ecuador submitted that the allocation of responsibility for groundwater based on
amount of time of each operatorship would: (i) reward an operator who concealed the
existence of contamination for years and tactically seeks to deny liability such that it would
be able to share responsibility with the next operator;”’ (ii) also unfairly impose
exclusively on Ecuador the burden of the time taken by Mr. MacDonald to complete his
report; and (iii) assume the same amount of contamination is generated every year
regardless of each operator’s practices, but the Tribunal cannot assume that Petroamazonas

operates under the same low standards as Perenco.°°*

Third, Ecuador argued that Perenco is liable, at the very least, for the complete remediation
of all the mud pits investigated by Mr. MacDonald because: (i) Perenco has the burden of

proof regarding the placement of proper pits as it would have such records, but has failed

to discharge that burden;®” and (ii) there were many more mud pits that Mr. MacDonald

should have investigated, but did not.

The Tribunal considers that, as reflected in Perenco’s general approach, there are two

temporal aspects to the causation issue. The Tribunal accordingly begins with two

fundamental principles.

First, the Tribunal agrees with Perenco that it cannot be held responsible for any

contamination caused by Petroamazonas after it took over the Blocks in July 2009. As the

Interim Decision on Counterclaim stated:

And:

Second, although Perenco is prima facie liable for all contamination in the Blocks, it cannot

be held responsible for any contamination that the evidence shows was caused by other

course of conducting oilfield operations, Petroamazonas might have
caused spills and other contamination. The key period of time was that

conducted their sampling activities. During this period, it is possible that
the condition of the Blocks could have been adversely affected by the
succeeding operator and this must be borne in mind. To the extent that
there is any evidence of environmental harm occurring in the Blocks
during the post 16 July 2009 period, Perenco bears no liability. Under the

The Tribunal will discuss each in turn.

(b) The Petroamazonas issue

The Tribunal is alive to the possibility that given the effluxion of time, Petroamazonas could
have caused contamination that could be erroneously attributed to Perenco. Insofar as the
sampling exercises are concerned, there are two time periods to be considered. First, due to
the 15-month period between Perenco’s suspension of operations and the beginning of
TEMS’ first sampling campaign, it is possible that contamination caused by Petroamazonas
could have been discovered by the Parties’ experts when they sampled the Blocks. Second,
it is also possible that the sites that were sampled by the Tribunal’s Independent Expert
could have been contaminated during the period between the end of the Parties’ experts’

sampling and the time when Ramboll conducted its sampling activities.

This is not an academic issue. During the original hearing on the counterclaim, Perenco
directed the Tribunal to examples of Petroamazonas having experienced spills after it took
over operations in the Blocks.?'? In its written submissions on the Independent Expert
Report and at the Expert Hearing, Perenco continued to refer to evidence of spills caused

by Petroamazonas.°!*

In the period leading up to the March 2019 Expert Hearing, the Tribunal considered
whether a discounting factor of some type, having regard to the two operators’ respective
tenures in the Blocks, might be appropriate, but it formed no firm view on the matter. In

Procedural Order No. 17, issued after the receipt of the Independent Expert Report and in

See Perenco’s Post-Hearing Submission on Counterclaims dated 6 November 2013, fns. 96 and 100, referring
to CE-CC-360 regarding Petroamazonas’ 2012 spill at Yuralpa Pad E and CE-CC-357 regarding
Petroamazonas’ 2011 spill at Coca 6.

See Perenco’s Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, paragraph 12: “It has
also experienced dozens of spills that it only very recently disclosed, and even more spills that it did not
disclose. For instance, in May 2012, El Comercio reported on the ‘Fifth Spill of Hydrocarbons in Ecuador
this Year,’ noting that there had been ‘one spill per month in oil Blocks operated by Petroecuador and
Petroamazonas,’ including in Block 21. Petroamazonas also reported spills that occurred on 1 March 2015 at
undisclosed locations in Payamino; on 16 September 2009, in Payamino; and on 4 January 2014 in Oso 9.”
See also fns. 18 and 20, referring to the following: CE-CC-438 (2011 Spill Report for Coca 6), CE-CC-439

anticipation of the Expert Hearing, the Tribunal invited the Parties to address this issue in

their written submissions:

“On the separate issue raised in the correspondence, namely, the question
of sorting out issues of causation for those sites which have been
successively worked by Perenco and Petroamazonas, the Tribunal has
been considering how to attribute liability in such circumstances. It
considers that the issue will to some extent be clarified by the production

of documents contemplated in this order. Once _a_fuller_picture_of
Pe onas’ possible contribution to any identified ination is

developed, the Tribunal will be in a better position to determine how to
proceed. The Tribunal reminds the Parties that the estimation of damages

is not a scientific exercise and it might be necessary to employ a general

discounting factor in order to arrive at a just and reasonable award. The
Parties are encouraged to address this issue in their written

submissions.”°!5 [Emphasis added.]

As a result of the document production exercise, the Parties’ focused written submissions,
and the testimony and oral submissions at the Expert Hearing, the Tribunal has arrived at

a better understanding as to how to deal with the Petroamazonas issue.

Starting with the first period of time, the Tribunal notes that the period of time elapsing
between Petroamazonas’ assumption of operations and IEMS’ first sampling campaign was
some 15 months.*!® Although it cannot be completely ruled out that some contamination
was caused by Petroamazonas prior to IEMS commencing its work (or during the time that
it took IEMS and GSI to complete their studies)?!7, the Tribunal is satisfied that it is
unlikely that one or the other of the Parties’ experts, particularly Perenco’s experts, would

have identified any new contamination that they thought occurred after Perenco’s

operatorship and included it as being caused by Perenco.?!*

Procedural Order No. 17, paragraph 15.

IEMS’ work commenced in the fourth quarter of 2010 and although IEMS did not identify all of the areas in
respect of which it ultimately claimed contamination was found, it did do a substantial amount of initial
sampling during the October - November 2010 period.

See e.g. GSI ER I, paragraph 201, noting that the results of their site inspections showing operating
deficiencies which in GSI’s opinion pertained to the operating practices of Petroamazonas. See also Saltos
WS I, paragraphs 302 and 310 -318.

Ecuador argued that the areas evaluated by the Expert were those that IEMS had evaluated since 2010. “In
addition, no recent contamination caused by the current operator has have (sic) been witnessed by any of the
actors that have been inspecting the Blocks since 2010 (the Consortium's experts and representatives

285

772.

773.

774.

With respect to the second period of time (the period of Petroamazonas’ operation between
the completion of IEMS’/GST’s work and the commencement of Mr. MacDonald’s work),
the Tribunal notes that the “territorial bounds” of the Independent Expert’s sampling
exercise were defined principally by IEMS (because GSI viewed its mandate as being
mainly one of checking the sites previously sampled by IEMS).°!? Insofar as there might
have been supervening contamination caused by Petroamazonas, the Tribunal considers
that the risk of attributing any such contamination to Perenco has been substantially
reduced by the Independent Expert’s circumscribed mandate to sample only at those sites
which were previously sampled by the Parties’ experts (Perenco’s mud pits excepted; see

below) and by other steps explained below.

Had the Independent Expert been instructed to conduct a de novo investigation, he could
well have identified contamination caused by Petroamazonas which occurred outside of
the sites previously identified by IEMS/GSI. But his restricted mandate reduced the
likelihood of that occurring. Since the initial IEMS data were collected within a relatively
short period of time after Perenco ceased operations, IEMS’ identification of allegedly
contaminated sites effectively serves as an “environmental conditions baseline.” Any
Petroamazonas spills and releases occurring outside of the sites where IEMS and/or GSI

sampled were not legally relevant to the Independent Expert’s task.

The only possibility for the Independent Expert’s erroneously capturing more recent
contamination by Petroamazonas to Perenco would be if Petroamazonas were to have

contaminated a site where exceedances were previously identified by either or both of the

included) nor were reported by MacDonald during his visit in October/November 2016 or during his 4-month
field campaign in the fall of 2017. ” Consolidated Expert Report, p. 10.

Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 234: “In its first report of 20 September 2012, GSI noted that
it had been tasked to ‘provide an objective evaluation of the work conducted by IEMS and, at the same time,
achieve a i of current itions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities
investigated by IEMS.’” The Consolidated Expert Report noted at p. 14: “GSI’s primary approach was to
either refute the RECs or refine the extent of contamination identified by IEMS (This was not their exclusive
effort; GSI also identified additional RECs based on their own field observations and due diligence).”

 

286

775.

776.

777.

Parties’ experts and the Expert could not differentiate between the new contamination and

the old.

A safeguard against that possibility was the Tribunal’s direction in the Interim Decision on

Counterclaim that:

“The Parties will be permitted to attend when the expert and his/her team
carries out the necessary investigations and the Parties will receive a copy
of the expert’s report and will be permitted to comment thereon in due
course.”°°

The Parties accepted this invitation. The Independent Expert noted that he discussed many
issues pertaining to the sampling exercise with Parties’ representatives during the process
of organising his work and that Party representatives were present when the Independent
Expert and/or his team conducted their activities in the Blocks.°*! An example of the
Parties’ ability to monitor Ramboll’s field work is recounted in the Consolidated
Independent Expert Report. The Report noted that when surface soils were to be sampled
at the Gacela 02 site, GSI expressed concern about the soils potentially being affected by
recent vegetation-control burning activities believed to have been conducted using diesel
fuel as an accelerant.°2? As a result, Ramboll collected additional samples from the
uppermost 10 cm soil interval; Mr. MacDonald reported that the Parties agreed that the

results from these samples should satisfy GSI’s concern.**

Given this attention to detail, in the Tribunal’s view, it is most unlikely that GSI would
have failed to point out recent contamination to Ramboll if it had spotted any. There is no

indication that they did so.** The presence of the Parties’ own representatives thus served

Ibid., paragraph 588. See also paragraph 611(19).

Id.

Rather, Perenco and its technical representatives raised various objections on the basis that Ramboll was
sampling in locations for which prior work of IEMS and GSI revealed no exceedances or that were already
well delineated or choosing locations not confined to sampling locations identified previously by IEMS or
GSI, which Perenco alleged to be outside the scope of the Expert’s mandate (see the correspondence of 13
September 2017 and 14 November 2017). Perenco also objected to Ecuador's attempt to have Ramboll
consider locations where there was “visual evidence” of potential contamination (see its letter of 14

287

TB.

779.

780.

926

to further reduce the possibility that any contamination caused by Petroamazonas since the

time of IEMS’ and GSI’s sampling campaigns will be wrongly attributed to Perenco.

Nevertheless, because an undetected layering of spills cannot be ruled out, the Tribunal
took a further step in agreeing with Perenco that Petroamazonas’ spill reports and related
documents should be produced to Perenco. This would enable the Parties to cross-check
the sites identified in those documents against the sites identified by the Independent Expert
to see whether any of the contamination he had identified could have been caused by

Petroamazonas.

The Tribunal found Perenco’s initial request for the production of documents to be overly

broad in that it asked the Tribunal to:

“...direct Ecuador to immediately produce all relevant documentation
pertaining to the environmental condition of the Blocks post-July 2009.
Based on information in the record and publicly available information, that
documentation should include annual environmental reports, bi-annual
environmental audits, internal monitoring reports, oil spill reporting
records, work orders issued by Petroamazonas to contractors assessing,

itigati ing, or diating potential envir 1 impacts in
the Blocks, and any transactional documents with new operators
describing the environmental conditions in the Blocks post-July 2009.”°

The Tribunal decided that while this request was properly motivated and made timeously,
it should be more narrowly focused on whether Petroamazonas caused any spills at the
particular sites identified by the Independent Expert as requiring remediation. It was

unnecessary to require production of documents relating to any sites which were excluded

6

from his investigation®”° or where the Independent Expert did not find contamination

November 2017). The Tribunal notes Ramboll’s letter of 28 December 2017 in response to Perenco’s letter
of 14 November 2017, where the Expert noted that there had been consistent dialogue with the Parties
throughout the scoping and implementation process related to field activities and that the Parties’ technical
representatives were present when the locations of the monitoring wells and other testing locations were field-
marked in August, as well as throughout the entire sampling programme, including during the groundwater
monitoring well installations, which commenced in mid-September 2017.

because the rest of the Blocks fell outside of his mandate. Procedural Order No. 17

therefore directed that:

. as contemplated in Ecuador’s offer quoted above at paragraph 11 [of
Procedural Order No. 17], only documents relating to those sites are
relevant for the purpose of the estimation of damages. The Tribunal
believes that Perenco is entitled to have access to such documents and it
would not be unduly burdensome for Ecuador to produce them on a rolling
basis.”°?7

After the order was issued, starting on 29 January 2019, Ecuador began to produce
responsive documents, namely, annual environmental reports of Blocks 7 and 21 as well
as spill and clean-up reports for sites identified by the Tribunal’s Expert as requiring
remediation.°?® Ecuador informed the Tribunal that within two weeks of the order, it had
provided some 120 documents relating to environmental incidents during Petroamazonas’
operatorship of the two Blocks.°”’ By letter dated 7 February 2019, Ecuador stated that it
produced 214 responsive documents to Perenco (and that this had been acknowledged by

Perenco on 5 February 2019°°°)°3!; and on 12 February 2019, Ecuador provided additional

See Ecuador's letter of 31 January 2019, p. 1. “Ecuador informs the Tribunal that it produced additional

in its 25 January 2019 letter) today. A search for itional potentially respi is
still ongoing Ecuador will produce any additional responsive documents (if any) without delay.”

 

See Perenco's letter of 5 February 2019: “Unfortunately, although on January 29 and 31, 2019 Ecuador
produced 214 documents, this production is neither complete nor satisfactory. Ecuador has produced annual
environmental reports for Blocks 7 and 21, as well as some spill and clean-up records of incidents that
occurred since 2009. However, it has not produced: (i) any biannual reports for Blocks 7 and 21, (ii) reports
of other environmental incidents that occurred post-July 2009 at the sites Mr. MacDonald has identified for
remediation, or (iii) work orders issued by Petroamazonas to contractors assessing, mitigating, managing or
remediating potential environmental impacts at relevant sites, and that would contain information on the
remediation costs that Petroamazonas has actually incurred to address environmental impacts at relevant sites.
For the reasons Perenco has already explained, and the Tribunal acknowledged in Procedural Order No. 17,
this information is critical to ensure that Perenco is not being held liable for the acts of its successor —
especially when that successor is Ecuador, the counterclaimant here. Ecuador's belated and incomplete
production is highly prejudicial to Perenco and grossly unfair. Ecuador must forthwith make a more complete
production.”

documents to Perenco.*’~ Ecuador’s comments in the Consolidated Independent Expert

Report note that it produced some 2500 responsive documents to Perenco.?*

Although Perenco complained about the extent of Ecuador’s compliance with the

34, it did not place much emphasis on such complaints.**> Both Parties

Tribunal’s order
have been represented in this arbitration by capable counsel and the Tribunal is loath to
find that Ecuador did not produce the relevant Petroamazonas documents pertaining to spill
incidents in the areas of concern to the Expert. It proceeds on the basis that Ecuador duly

complied with the terms of Procedural Order No. 17.

The Tribunal has taken further note of the fact that at the Expert Hearing, Perenco did not
direct the Independent Expert to many of the Petroamazonas spill reports.°*° This suggests

that the documentary evidence produced to Perenco was not as supportive of its contention

  

Ecuador's ‘production [as being] neither complete nor satisfactory’ in a misguided effort to discourage the
Tribunal from allowing the introduction of records of workovers performed by Perenco. Yet, Ecuador has
complied (and continues to undertake its best reasonable efforts to comply) with PO 17.” Ecuador added:
“Ecuador commenced disclosing responsive documents to Perenco, on a rolling basis, on 29 January 2019
(ie., only 14 days after PO 17) by producing a first back of some 100 post-July 2009 spill clean-up reports.
Subsequently, on 31 January 2019 Ecuador disclosed over 100 documents (including annual environmental
audits for Block 7 and 21 since 2010). In sum, Ecuador has produced over 200 documents within two weeks
from the Tribunal's order.” Finally, Ecuador responded to Perenco's complaint that it was not providing
reports for relevant sites: “Ecuador can confirm that there are no records of any spills during Petroamazonas’
operations at 24 sites. There are, therefore, no additional spill reports to be disclosed.” Finally, Ecuador
indicated that Petroamazonas had recently advised that it identified additional responsive documents
including the biennial audits conducted at Blocks seven and 21 which Ecuador would promptly disclose as
soon as they were retrieved.

 

 

See Ecuador's letter of 12 February 2019, which stated: "Ecuador hereby informs the Tribunal that it has
produced additional documents to Perenco today."

Consolidated Expert Report, p. 250.

See Perenco's letter of 5 February 2019 quoted above. In addition, Perenco’s 22 February 2019 submission
stated at paragraph 12: “Ecuador’s eleventh-hour document production leaves a picture that is far too
incomplete to adequately depict ten-years’ worth of [Petroamazonas’] operations’ environmental impacts.”
See Perenco’s Closing Presentation, Slides 81 and 84 regarding its allegation that Ecuador failed to disclose
certain environmental incidents and Ecuador’s representation that Lobo 4 had not been operated after 2009.
The main example being a Petroamazonas spill at Coca 6. See Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 173-
175, Mr. Friedman’s cross-examination of Mr. MacDonald with respect to the spill at Coca 6.

that a substantial amount of the contamination identified by Mr. MacDonald should be

attributed to Petroamazonas’ activities as Perenco had hoped.°*”

There seems to be a good reason for this: having regard to the documentary evidence
produced by Ecuador, it appears that 35 spills and releases were reported to have occurred
in the relevant areas since July 2009.°** They were mainly small quantity spills or releases
that were remediated or occurred within secondary containment. More important for the
Tribunal’s determination is that 26 of the 35 spills evidently occurred away from areas
identified by Mr. MacDonald as contaminated or at sites where his conceptual remediation
plan addresses only mud pits that were constructed and used by Perenco. Further, five of
the spills occurred at sites where the remediation plan addresses elevated metal
concentrations (e.g., barium). Moreover, there is no mention in the Independent Expert
Report of any recent spills witnessed at sites where Ramboll tested. This led Ecuador to
assert that while the Expert observed crude oil in swampy areas at some sites (e.g., Coca 2

and Payamino 2/8), he did not observe conditions that would indicate recent releases.°°?

In sum, in relation to what might be called the ‘Petroamazonas temporal issue’, given the
totality of the circumstances (including the Independent Expert’s restricted mandate, his
and his team’s consultations with the Parties’ experts and counsel throughout his sampling
activities, and the spill reports and other documents produced by Ecuador), the Tribunal
has concluded that the use of a generally applicable discounting factor based exclusively
upon a split between the length of time that Perenco and Petroamazonas’ operated in the
Blocks would, by itself, be too crude a method of allocating responsibility and

insufficiently connected to the record evidence. The Tribunal concluded that a closer look

Although counsel argued in favour of a discounting factor with respect to soil and groundwater remediation
costs based on the relative length of time of Petroamazonas and Perenco in the operation of the Blocks, it
pointed to little evidence drawn from the spill reports and other documents produced to it to prove that any
of the contamination that had been estimated by Mr. MacDonald was attributable to Petroamazonas. Tr. (1)

evaluated since 2010. In addition, no recent contamination caused by the current operator has have been [sic]
witnessed by any of the actors that have been inspecting the Blocks since 2010 (the Consortium’s experts and
representatives included) nor were reported by MacDonald during his visit in October/November 2016 or
during his 4-month field campaign in the fall of 2017.”

at the sites where contamination was found was required before using any discounting

factor based on, for example, the respective length of the two operators’ tenures.

(c) Contamination caused by prior operators

The second temporal issue, namely, the possibility of Perenco being wrongly held
accountable for contamination caused by prior operators is, in the Tribunal’s view, a much

more significant and difficult issue.

Resolving this issue is complicated by the fact that Perenco’s documentary evidence of its
own evaluation of the Blocks’ condition in 2002 was _ non-existent.
Mr. Wilfrido Saltos testified that an evaluation of the Blocks was performed when Perenco
acquired its interests, but when requested, Perenco was unable to produce any written audit
of the Blocks prepared by or for it in order to ascertain their condition at the time of
acquisition.“ The most it could show was that it obtained a representation and warranty
from the seller, Kerr-McGee, that the latter had complied with all applicable Ecuadorian
laws relating to the environment, with the exception of certain matters listed in two
schedules to the contracts.°*! One of the schedules, Schedule 3.9(a), was admitted into the

record earlier in this proceeding.”

The Tribunal considered Schedule 3.9(a) to be of some assistance to ascertaining the state

of the Blocks’ environmental condition in 2002. It noted:

“For present purposes, while the Tribunal considers that Schedule 3.9(a)
provides a helpful contemporaneous assessment of the Blocks, it cannot
be considered to be a definitive and exhaustive analysis of their
environmental condition. There might have been contamination of which
Kerr-McGee was unaware or which it might have failed to disclose. There
is no indication that Perenco challenged Kerr-McGee’s list of
noncompliant issues by informing it of contamination or other regulatory
problems which had not been disclosed to it under Schedule 3.9(a) nor is
there any evidence of Perenco’s having ever complained to Kerr McGee
that it had made anything other than an accurate disclosure. Schedule 3.9

(a) thus provides a starting point for distinguishing between any
contamination that might have occurred prior to Perenco’s acquisition of
its interests and any contamination which occurred thereafter.”
[Emphasis added.]

Schedule 3.9 (a) was thus one helpful piece of evidence, a starting point, but hardly

dispositive of the question of the Blocks’ environmental condition.

The other schedule, Schedule 3.9(b), which listed all wells in the Contract Area and a
description of their status, was not included in Perenco’s redacted version of the Purchase
and Sale Agreement produced earlier in the counterclaim proceeding. The Tribunal
considered that this should be produced in the next phase of this proceeding because it
might shed additional light on the condition of the Blocks in 2002.**4 Schedule 3.9(b) was

duly produced by Perenco, but it only lists the status of each well in the Blocks at the time

  

of acquisition and provides no additional insight into their environmental condition.°*>

The Tribunal also considered that if the Parties were unable to settle this part of the case
on the basis of the Interim Decision on Counterclaim’s findings and the Tribunal had to
proceed to this phase of the proceeding, it would be helpful to examine DINAPA-CSA-
1602001-20001697 of September 2001, if a copy of that letter could be located, because it
set out the authority’s view of what needed to be done at the time in order to bring the
Operator into compliance with its legal obligations.™*° This was duly submitted by Ecuador
as E-445. Regrettably, it did not advance matters. A comparison of DINAPA’s 4 September

2001 inspection letter to Schedule 3.9(a) shows that the Schedule essentially reproduces it.

The Tribunal recalls its prior discussion of the evidence as to the environmental conditions
of the Blocks at the time of Perenco’s acquisition of its interests in the Production Sharing

Contracts:

CE-CC-432, produced under cover of Perenco’s letter dated 25 January 2019. The schedule listed some 50
producing wells, 10 shut-in wells, three P & A wells (“plugged and abandoned”), one TA well (“temporarily
abandoned”) and three water disposal wells in Block 7; and two plugged and abandoned wells, seven
temporarily abandoned wells, and one testing well in Block 21.

“Tn both the Parties’ written pleadings and in their experts’ reports, there
was considerable debate over whether certain instances of contamination
were attributable to the actions of Perenco or to other parties who carried
on operations in what became Blocks 7 and 21 before Perenco arrived on
the scene. In view of the Tribunal’s finding that under the fault-based
regime Perenco can avoid liability if it can demonstrate that a particular
instance of contamination resulted from the acts of another person, this
necessarily requires the Tribunal to consider the environmental conditions
of the two Blocks at the time that Perenco acquired its interests from Kerr-
McGee.”*"”

The Interim Decision on Counterclaim reviewed evidence of prior contamination which
was submitted by Perenco.*4* Perenco returned to some of this evidence during its closing
submissions in the latest phase of this proceeding.” It also made the important point that

Ecuadorian environmental law has become more rigorous over time.”°°

Drilling in the Coca-Payamino unified field dates back to 1971, with successive operators
CEPE and BP, Petroproduccién, Oryx, then Petroproducci6n again, and then Kerr-McGee,

all preceding Perenco’s entry into that field some 30 years after CEPE and BP first

conducted exploratory drilling.**!

In Block 7, CEPE and BP, Kerr-McGee and Petroproduccién, then Kerr-McGee, all
operated prior to Perenco. Unsurprisingly, more wells were drilled by the preceding

operators in the Coca-Payamino unified field and Block 7 (Oso excepted) than by Perenco

itself. °°

Tr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 513:17-514:3: “You are being confronted with old legacy liabilities,
for the most part, things that happened a long time ago under a different regulatory regime. They might not
have even been violations of the environmental regulations at the time, but, nevertheless, they occurred on
the State's watch or at a time when operations were for the State's benefit, and Perenco had no role in it.
Perenco was not even in the picture.”

GSI prepared a Table in Appendix B.4 to its first expert report which listed on a site by site basis, the drilling
of certain wells (Payamino 02-08, Mono CPF/Mono 1-5/1W, Payamino 1, Gacela 01-08, Coca 18-19, Coca
01, Coca 04, Coca 06, Coca 08, Coca CPF, Gacela 02, Jaguar 02, Jaguar 07-08, Mono Sur / Mono 6-9, 11,

In Block 21, which does not have as long a history as Block 7°* (Perenco itself
characterised Block 21 as a “greenfield development project” because there was “no oil
producing infrastructure”*™*), Kerr-McGee preceded Perenco.”° Indeed, of the 77 wells
listed in Schedule 3.9(b) to the Kerr-McGee Purchase and Sale Agreement, only nine were
located in Block 21 and none of them were operating at the time of acquisition.°»° Insofar

as the wells at the Yuralpa field in Block 21 are concerned, Perenco drilled the lion’s share

957

of those wells®*’ until Petroamazonas began operations.?**

It appears that some 84 spills and releases were reported to have occurred prior to
September 2002, of which four were not specifically tied to a site but only to Block 7 or an

oilfield (e.g., Coca, Mono-Jaguar, Payamino).?°° GSI also used a somewhat lower number;

activities at those pre-2002 sites would be associated with prior operators, not the Consortium. Indeed,
available information indicates that some wells drilled prior to 1990 were completed without use of
mud/cuttings pits, resulting in discharge of excess drilling mud and cuttings to the surrounding area.”

It appears that Yuralpa 1 was drilled in 1972 by Texaco. See GSI ER I Appendix B.4. The next wells to be
drilled were Yuralpa Centro 1 (October 1997), Dayuno 1 (September-October 1987), Sumino (an injection
well) (May 1998), Yuralpa Centro 2 (April 1999), Nemoca (December 1999), and Waponi and Ocatoe (both
in August 2000).

In its Revised Memorial dated 5 August 2011, Perenco asserted at paragraph 42: “Block 21 is a 155,000
hectare plot several hundred kilometers east of Quito. LC WS {] 4. At the time Perenco acquired its interest
in Ecuador, Block 21 was literally a greenfield development project: there was no oil producing
infrastructure.”

CE-CC-432. The wells are Yuralpa-1, Dayuno-1, Yuralpa C-1, Chonta-1, Sumino-1, Yuralpa C-2, Nemoca-
1, Waponi-1, and Ocatoe-1. The first two were ‘plugged and abandoned’ and all of the rest were ‘temporarily
abandoned’.

See GSI ER I Appendix B.4, pp. 4-5.

Perenco noted, at paragraphs 45-47 of its Revised Memorial, dated 5 August 2011, that: Block 21 was
essentially a “greenfield development project” because there was no there was “no oil producing
infrastructure.” Perenco stated: “by the end of the first quarter of 2004, the Consortium had brought
production from zero to close to 22,000 barrels a day.” However, due to a “technical setback [which] caused
a drop in the production of Block 21’s most productive wells which, at the time, had been producing
approximately 12,000 barrels per day... Perenco was forced to drill additional wells that were not originally
contemplated and to commit additional capital to restore production.” “Consequently, by the end of the first
quarter of 2006 — when Ecuador enacted Law 42 — the Consortium had invested $197 million in Block 21...
It had drilled over 25 production wells, as opposed to the 12 originally contemplated, and was producing
nearly 16,000 barrels per day.”

See Appendix B of GSI ER I and the 1998 Grizzle Report. See also summary table from Perenco Ecuador to
DINAPA, Technical Report — Environmental Characterization of Platform Payamino 2-8 (“Walsh Report”),
and Records of Petroamazonas’ post-July 2009 spills (provided by Ecuador as Exhibit E-460 submitted with

it included with its first expert report in 2012 as Appendix B.3, which identified 55 “pre-
Perenco” spills and releases.” A brief description of the nature and quality of the release
and any recovered product was included in the summary table. At 11 of these sites, the
reported releases were more than 20 barrels, and some of these releases were reportedly
significant (i.e., 150 barrels at Coca 8 and 110 barrels at Gacela 6). However, GSI did not
provide details on, among other things, where the releases took place within a given site,
what media was affected (e.g., soil, surface water), how the affected media were addressed
(if at all), or provide the supporting documents used by it in order to create its summary

table.

That said, the Tribunal accepts the thrust of Perenco’s position that there had to be pre-
existing contamination because there is evidence to support the findings that: (i) the
Ecuadorian legal framework governing the environmental aspects of oilfield operations
was less rigorous than RAOHE and TULAS (the former promulgated in 1995 and then
amended in 2001 and the latter promulgated in 2003); and (ii) at least some operators”

practices were conducted to that less rigorous standard in the 1980s and 90s.

For example, an internal environmental assessment report on the Coca-Payamino field
prepared for Oryx in 1994 by Patrick Grizzle and Nancy Sahr (when Oryx took over
operations in that field), was troubling. In addition to identifying various practices which
needed improvement, the report noted:
“There is presently no reporting or written procedures within
PetroProduccion [sic] for environmental pollution or spill incident

reporting. An incident reporting system should be put in place as soon as
possible.”°°? [Emphasis added.]

The 1994 report unfortunately contained no results of sampling and analysis. The authors

thought from a visual inspection that the contamination was “minimal”, but added that: “as

801.

this study did not include sampling and analysis, no confirmation of contamination levels
can be made.”°* In the Tribunal’s view, it is more likely than not that Petroproduccion
and other operators at the time caused damage, but there is little in the way of hard
information as to the extent of the contamination that might have resulted from the laxity
in environmental practices at that time. As the Tribunal previously noted when it discussed
the issue in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, visual inspections are important, but in
and of themselves are not sufficient to identify and determine the extent of

contamination.°™

There is some evidence that some of the spills identified in 1994 at least were remediated.
The March 1996 Internal Environmental Audit of Oryx Ecuador Operations, also
performed by Mr. Grizzle and Ms. Sahr, which followed up on a 1995 audit, noted that:

“Several environmental issues were noted during the audit. Several of
these were noted in the 1995 Audit and some have been corrected or
partially corrected.”°® [Emphasis added.]

Ibid., paragraph 382, quoting Exhibit E-261, Environmental Ass
Coca-Payamino Field dated May 1994, p. 4.

Ibid., paragraph 409: “... The Tribunal agrees with Ecuador that the fact that rapid growth of vegetation might
obscure a visual inspection of contaminants, does not mean that they disappear for remediation purposes.
Hence, while as GSI emphasised, visual inspections are an important part of conducting a thorough
assessment, they are hardly adequate to the task of ascertaining the extent of contamination and the Tribunal
is not content to rely upon an expert’s visual evaluation.” Perenco itself pointed this out, at paragraph 266 of
its Rejoinder on Counterclaims, when commenting on the various audits performed when Oryx was the
operator, specifically in relation to the Jungal swamp/Payamino 2-8 contamination: “Comments in later audits
that the area affected by a subsequent 1991 spill by Petroproduccidn ‘has been revegetated and is doing well’
would not establish that this was due to remediation, whether of the 1991 spill or the 1987 incident. Today,
the Jungal swamp is still heavily vegetated, appears to be doing well to the naked eye, and shows no obvious
signs of contamination, yet both IEMS and GSI have confirmed TPH and barium exceedances in that
location.” There is also evidence of crude oil both on the slope leading to the swamp and within the swamp
itself.

The 1998 Grizzle report, commissioned at a time when Oryx was negotiating to take over
the operation of the Coca-Payamino field, followed the same format and general content
of the previous years’ reports. The report essentially provided a photographic snapshot of
conditions at 27 sites. It generally shows that, other than a single spill at Coca 6, historical
events can be described as small quantity spills or releases that seemed to result from poor
operation and maintenance practices (e.g., leaky valves and flanges, damaged secondary
containment systems, overflowing oil/water separators, overfilling of diesel tanks). The
most significant and largest quantity of spills were observed within the CPFs (Coca CPF
and Payamino CPF) and not the platforms.*® In the end, the 1998 Grizzle report did not
seek to identify the specific releases, to estimate quantities, or to ascertain when the releases

occurred.
The Interim Decision on Counterclaim noted that:

“.. when Oryx was negotiating to resume the operatorship of the Coca-
Payamino Field (it evidently had been operated by Petroproduccién for
some eighteen months), a Mr. Patrick Grizzle (who appears to have been
an Oryx employee) conducted an inspection from 12 to 14 January 1998.
Mr. Grizzle’s view was that environmental conditions had deteriorated in
the period during which the field was being operated by Petroproduccion

and he was critical of its operatorship. Oryx had operated the field from
1995 to 1997 and Mr. Grizzle recorded what he viewed as backsliding

from many of Oryx’s better practices. He appears to have reached this

conclusion entirely on visual inspections (many photographs are attached

to the report). Once again, according to the report, no sampling of soils,

surface water or groundwater were taken.”°°’ [Emphasis added.]
It is not in dispute between the Parties that in the period leading up to Perenco’s suspension
of operations in July 2009, most of the production wells in the Block 7 and the Coca-
Payamino field (excluding Oso) were drilled before Perenco arrived in Ecuador. In its
Closing Presentation, Perenco listed 57 wells that pre-dated its operatorship of Block 21.

(In contrast, it listed 15 wells for which it appeared to take responsibility in that Block.)

The Tribunal itself noted in its Interim Decision on Counterclaim, at paragraph 405, that the record evidence
indicated “some problems with the Coca-Payamino Field and the Oso | platform” which predated Perenco's
operatorship.

Given the Grizzle-Sahr reports, in particular, the comments on Petroproducci6n’s
backsliding (quoted in paragraph 385 of the Interim Decision on Counterclaim just noted)
and various other pieces of evidence pertaining to wells that were drilled before Perenco’s
operatorship, the Tribunal is reluctant to rely upon the Purchase and Sale Agreement’s
schedules as constituting an exhaustive and definitive statement of the Blocks’
environmental condition. The Tribunal cannot but note however that Perenco should have
better inspected and documented the conditions of the Blocks before signing the SPA and
its schedules. It is due to its neglect that the schedules do not provide an exhaustive and

definitive statement of the Blocks’ condition in 2002.

The 1998 Grizzle-Sahr report neatly illustrates the challenge facing the Tribunal in
differentiating between contamination in the Blocks which is plainly legally irrelevant and
that which might be legally relevant to the present exercise. The 1998 report observed that
there had been a release at Coca 6. But that release occurred in an area that is some distance
away from the area at Coca 6 that is included in Mr. MacDonald’s conceptual remedial
plan and hence no question of Perenco’s liability arises.°° However, the Grizzle-Sahr
report also identified three sites where reported releases might have contributed to
contamination in areas which the Independent Expert identified as warranting remediation.
Given the annual inspections and recommendation made therein, and Grizzle and Sahr’s
noting that some progress had been made in dealing with matters identified in previous
reports, it is possible that Kerr-McGee took steps to remediate these incidents prior to its
selling its interests in the Blocks to Perenco, but there is insufficient evidence on the record
for the Tribunal to be satisfied on this point. The Tribunal therefore proceeds on the basis

that some of the contamination at the following three sites predated Perenco’s operatorship:

— Coca 2/CPF - Oil releases from the API separator that discharged to the swampy
area to the southeast of the facility.

— Payamino 1/CPF - The presence of historical facility pits with several thousand
barrels of crude to the west of the CPF, which could have potentially overflown to
the north, towards the catchment area and the swampy area to the north/northwest
of the facility.

970

— Payamino 23 — Spills were observed behind the power oil system and at the north
entrance and an open reserve pit was still in place to the south of the power oil
facility.°”°

This shows the potential for the layering of contamination by different operators. This
situation militates in favour of allocating responsibility based on the length of tenure or

based on some other weighting factor.

In the end, the Tribunal is satisfied that the contemporaneous documentary evidence
indicates that there was contamination caused by operators in the Blocks in the decades
preceding the period of Perenco’s operatorship. The visual inspections recorded in the
various reports just quoted identified a variety of different shortcomings and in some

instances Grizzle and Sahr gave “poor housekeeping” marks for various wells.°”! It is

  

sufficient for the Tribunal to know that there were extensive drilling operations in the Coca-

Payamino field and other parts of Block 7 and a few wells were drilled in Block 21 before

Perenco arrived and that there is contemporaneous documentary evidence showing that at

In respect of the first two of these sites, the Tribunal considers that the substantial majority of the
contamination found by the Expert was caused by Perenco’s predecessors.

Following a May 1994 audit, Grizzle and Sahr concluded that the following sites suffered from poor
housekeeping which “infers inferior operating procedures reflected by obvious debris, minimal or no
maintenance of equipment and buildings, numerous operational spills, and inadequate vegetation and erosion
control” (p. 12) (only those sites delineated by Mr. MacDonald are listed here): Payamino 4, Payamino 10,
Payamino 13, Payamino 15, Payamino 16, Payamino and Coca CPF (but the report says that the level of
contamination was minor, see p. 44), and Coca 8. See E-261.

Following a 11-14 March 1996 inspection, Grizzle and Sahr noted that the poor housekeeping at Payamino
10 had been corrected (p. 9) whereas this still persisted at Payamino 16 (p. 11). Their report also noted that
Jaguar 7’s sewage system was “extremely poor” and there were poor storage practices (p. 6). More generally,
the report considered that the practice of discharging of sewage into a stream had to be reconsidered, not just
for Mono 3, but as a whole, in order to protect the health of people on location and those living along the
streams (p. 6). See E-262.
The copy of Grizzle and Sahr’
and does not discuss specific

6-9 June 1997 report provided to the Tribunal appears to have been truncated
ites. See E-263.

After the 22-23 June 1998 internal environmental audit, Grizzle and Sahr did not refer to housekeeping
conditions, but instead noted the various issues and steps required with respect to various sites. Generally,
the following sites were noted as requiring or still requiring remediation (mostly affected soil): Lobo 1
facility, Jaguar 2, Jaguar 3, Jaguar 7, Mono 1, Mono 5, Gacela 1/8, Gacela 2, Gacela 4, Gacela 5, Gacela CPF
(once again, only those sites delineated by Mr. MacDonald have been set out here).

that time there was a relative laxity when it came to conducting drilling operations and

other oilfield activities in an environmentally-protective manner.

Perenco has also directed the Tribunal to other evidence of spills prior to its assumption of
the operatorship of the two Blocks. The Tribunal accepts Perenco’s contention that certain
contaminants, in particular, barium (with or without other metals (i.e. cadmium, chromium,
lead, nickel and/or vanadium)), should be taken to be associated with the installation of
production wells. Given the documentary evidence showing substantial drilling of such
wells prior to 2002, it follows that barium exceedances at those sites have been shown by
Perenco, on a preponderance of evidence, to have resulted from the actions of its
predecessors. Given the location of those wells, together with the mud pits constructed and
used by Perenco’s predecessors, and the Tribunal has been able to exclude liability, either

wholly or partially, for different parts of the various sites investigated.

The Tribunal recognises that in attempting to “unscramble the contamination egg”, it is
dealing with knowns and unknowns.?”? Notwithstanding the work conducted by the
Parties’ experts and supplemented by the Tribunal’s Independent Expert, this exercise is
not one of scientific certainty. But, as noted above at paragraph 69, the estimation of

damages is not a science and a court or tribunal must work with the evidence before it.

To be clear: before using a time-based weighting system in respect to a particular site, areas
within the site that could be clearly designated as “non-Perenco” or “Perenco” were
segregated and placed in the corresponding “bucket” of responsibility. In addition, where
other criteria could be used, these were applied in lieu of the time-weighted approach. But
sometimes it has been necessary to allocate responsibility between successive operators.
So far as prior operators are concerned, the time of first well drilling at a specific site is
used as the starting point and July 2009, when Perenco ceased operations in the Blocks, is

used as the end date (with the exception of sites where the ‘Petroamazonas temporal issue’

events and therefore inferences are typically applied to complement analytical results.

813.

applies).°” This tends to bias in favour of Perenco, and therefore is a conservative estimate
of its responsibility, because it does not consider the possibility of later contaminant release
dates and the fact that some fields were drilled but not heavily exploited until Perenco
arrived (i.e, Oso and Yuralpa).?”* As for any allocation as between Perenco and
Petroamazonas, to the limited extent that it is used (for the reasons previously given), the
time-weighted system uses July 2019 as the end date. This is relevant only for a few sites
for groundwater (Coca 2/CPF, Gacela 1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF) and therefore assumes

much less importance than the system used for Perenco and prior operators.

3. Did the Independent Expert act within his mandate?

Turning to the second set of issues, virtually all of them are bound up with the exercise of
technical judgement and expertise. Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the following

questions pertaining to the Independent Expert’s mandate should be addressed.
Specifically, did the Independent Expert:

Adhere to the Tribunal’s restrictions on site sampling?
Follow the Tribunal’s instructions on establishing the land-use criteria?

Exceed his mandate with respect to mud pits by resolving to apply RAOHE Table
7(a) to all mud pits?

Exceed his mandate with respect to groundwater monitoring by resolving to apply
TULAS to groundwater samples taken from wells installed in sites where the clay
content exceeded 25%?

See paragraph 785 above.

Consolidated Expert Report, pp. 24-25: “The first petroleum exploration activities within Block 7 and the
CPUF reportedly occurred in the early 1970s, when Texaco drilled exploratory oil wells at the Coca 1, Condor
1, and Zorro | platforms. British Petroleum (BP) also constructed an exploratory well at Oso 1 in 1970. Oil
extraction activities do not appear to have occurred until approximately December 1985 when BP began
developing the area under a service contract...” As for Block 21, “Texaco began oil exploration activities in
Block 21 during the early 1970s at the Yuralpa | platform. Further activities were not conducted within the
Block until March 1995, when Oryx conducted further exploratory environmental impact and seismic studies.
When Perenco began operating at Block 21 in 2002, it contained a small number of wells (approximately
nine) and Central Processing Facilities (CPFs). Upon the July 2009 takeover of the operations, operations
within Block 21 had increased substantially.”

302

Adhere to the Tribunal’s instruction that when estimating costs of any remediation
for which Perenco is liable, the Expert shall be guided by Ecuadorian costs?°”°

(a) The Independent Expert’s sampling mandate

814. The Tribunal recalls that Mr. MacDonald was instructed to review the work performed by
the Parties’ experts and to sample at those sites where either or both of the Parties’ experts

had found evidence of contamination. The Tribunal reasoned that:

“590. ... IEMS and GSI had ample opportunity to take samples in
whatever parts of the Blocks either considered necessary. The Tribunal’s
expert will therefore confine his/her work to the specific sites at which soil
samples were taken and groundwater sampling wells were drilled.
Although, due to the differences between IEMS and GSI’s sampling
practices, it will be necessary for the expert to re-sample at those sites
where contamination was detected by one or the other party’s experts and
to delineate the extent of any such contamination, the Tribunal’s expert
will not sample other sites that the Parties’ experts did not sample.°”°

592. ... the Tribunal wishes to make clear that this course of action is not
intended to provide any opportunity for the Parties to provide new
evidence (except that called for by the Tribunal in aid of its expert). They
have had ample opportunity to present their cases. The purpose of the next
phase is for the Tribunal’s expert to validate one approach or the other in
respect of the remaining technical issues.”°"”

815. In addition, the Tribunal observed:

“596. It need hardly be said that every attempt must be made to base the
determination of damages owed on the situation existing at the time of the
Consortium’s departure in July 2009.”°’8

816. Mr. MacDonald was thus instructed not to perform a de novo study of the environmental
condition of the two Blocks. The Tribunal recognised that this instruction meant that there
would almost certainly be contamination in the two Blocks which was not captured either

by the Parties’ experts or by the Tribunal’s Independent Expert:

o7s Such issues as the interpretation of chromatograms, calculation of background values and ‘order of
magnitude’ issues are considered to fall within his sphere of expertise and competence.

“595. The Tribunal is mindful that it is almost certain that the sampling
performed by both experts did not adequately capture all of the
contamination. Indeed, notwithstanding its initial declaration that its
intention was to “achieve a comprehensive assessment of current
environmental conditions for each of the 74 oilfield facilities investigated
by IEMS in the CPUF, Block 7, and Block 21 area”, this is not what GSI
did. As Ecuador pointed out, GSI accepted that it confined its investigation
to seeking to invalidate RECs identified by IEMS. Mr. Connor further
confirmed that GSI did not attempt to comprehensively estimate the
amount of contamination in the Blocks, separately from its review of
TEMS’ work, and acknowledged that both experts could have missed
i of ination. Be this as it may, the present exercise is
concerned with an accurate and impartial analysis of the work that was
done by the experts — who had ample opportunity to examine the Blocks.
Their work must now be evaluated by the expert in accordance with the
Tribunal’s findings.”°” [Emphasis added.]

Two other points warrant mention. First, as noted above, Mr. MacDonald was instructed
not to consider the allocation of responsibility to Perenco for its share of the contamination
which he determined to exist in the relevant sites. Secondly, he was also instructed to

perform his work without regard to the determinations made by the Burlington tribunal.**°

(b) Did the Expert exceed his mandate in conducting sampling at sites that were

not sampled by either of the Parties’ experts?
Perenco complained that certain sites which the Expert decided to sample had not been
found to be contaminated by either of the Parties’ experts. The Expert moreover assumed
that certain mud pits contained exceedances without his having sampled them.°*! Perenco
therefore submitted that the Tribunal must exclude these sites (pits at Oso 9A, Oso 9 B,
Oso 9, Pits 2, 4, Yuralpa SL pit, and Yuralpa G, pit 298?) from the total measured

contamination in Blocks 7 and 21.°8

By “total measurable contamination” the Tribunal refers to the Expert's estimation of the total contamination
in those areas of the Blocks which were previously identified by one or the other of the Parties’ experts and
then sampled and further delineated by the Expert. Due to the Expert's restricted mandate, this is not to be
taken as a firm estimate of all of the potential contamination in the two Blocks.

During his opening presentation to the Parties and the Tribunal on 11 March 2019, at which
he reviewed his work and responded to the Parties’ written comments, Mr. MacDonald
began by summarising the “mandates that guided the scope of work.”°** The first two

points on his slide stated:

“Investigation of soil and groundwater was restricted to areas already sampled by
the Parties.

Investigation of mud pits was limited to those known to have been used by

Perenco.”°85
Mr. MacDonald thus differentiated between sampling of soils and groundwater, on the one
hand, and sampling of mud pits, on the other. Having regard to the Interim Decision on
Counterclaim as a whole, the Tribunal considers that this was a not unreasonable
interpretation of the Tribunal’s directions. With respect to the first point on Mr.
MacDonald’s slide, at paragraph 590 of the Interim Decision, the Tribunal stated: “The
Tribunal’s expert will therefore confine his/her work to the specific sites at which soil

samples were taken and groundwater sampling wells were drilled....”°°°

With respect to mud pits, the Interim Decision on Counterclaim was clear in expressing the
Tribunal’s intention that Perenco would be liable for any exceedances found in mud pits
that Perenco had used. When the general instructions were developed in the Interim
Decision on Counterclaim (assuming an expert might have to be appointed), it appeared to
the Tribunal that the principal difference between the Parties in respect of mud pits was not
the number of mud pits that Perenco had used, but rather of that universe of pits, how many
were lined as opposed to unlined? This can be seen in the discussion in paragraph 502 of

the Interim Decision on Counterclaim:

“502. The Schedule of Closed Mud Pits attached as Appendix A to the
Claimant’s Post-Hearing Brief on Counterclaims, which was prepared
with both Parties’ involvement and for which the Tribunal is grateful,

shows that there are substantial disagreements as to whether

many pits were lined or unlined. The ‘Master List’ records disagreement
in at least 26 of 79 cases; the ‘Pits Constructed by Perenco’ list shows an
even higher percentage of disagreement (14 of 18). The ‘Pits Constructed
by Prior Operators’ shows 12 disagreements (of 63 entries) and many (36)
unknowns.”°*” [Emphasis added.]

To be clear, Perenco did not complain that the Independent Expert sampled mud pits that
had been used by other operators.°** Perenco did not take issue with the Consolidated

Independent Expert Report’s statement that:

“Per the Tribunal, the condition of non-Perenco pits, either those
constructed before September 2002 or after July 2009, were not relevant
to the claim and were excluded from Ramboll’s assessment.”°*?

The Consolidated Independent Expert Report moreover explicitly notes that Mr.
MacDonald limited his sampling to the pits that the Parties’ representatives agreed had
been used by Perenco.°”° Perenco’s grievance is that the Independent Expert either sampled

mud pits admittedly used by Perenco but which had not been previously sampled by the

991

Parties’ experts’”” or that he did not sample certain pits used by Perenco, but rather only

inferred contamination of such pits.°”

It was not the Tribunal’s intention that Perenco would be able to avoid liability for any
exceedances determined by the Independent Expert for mud pits which Perenco had used.

From the Tribunal’s perspective, the key objectives insofar as mud pits were concerned

Ibid., paragraph 502.

The Notes to Table 5.1 indicate instances where mud pits were identified as being associated with non-
Perenco operations and therefore were not sampled. See notes 4 and 5.

Parties agreed were ciated with prior Perenco operations. All of the Perenco mud pit areas were inspected,
and almost all were sampled. ...”

 

Ibid., p.93: “At Oso 9A and 9B, however, Ramboll designates for remediation 7 mud pits even though neither
IEMS nor GSI found evidence of exceedances in these sites. Consequently, these areas were beyond the
scope of Ramboll’s investigation.”

contents: Ramboll found that pit 8 in Oso 9 met the performance criteria even though the adjacent pit 9 did

were twofold: (i) to have Mr. MacDonald ‘get to the bottom’ of the lined/unlined pit dispute
between the Parties; and (ii) to ensure that Perenco would not be held liable for pits
constructed by prior operators which it did not use. This was made clear at 604 of the

Interim Decision on Counterclaim:

“604. The same exercise must be performed in relation to the mud pits
used by Perenco up to 16 July 2009. Perenco cannot be held liable for pits

constructed by prior operators which it itself did not use, because by
definition it would be able to show that any damage caused from leachates

escaping from such pits cannot be attributed to it. It can only be held liable
for damage resulting from the pits which it used or built. It is necessary to
ascertain whether the drilling muds were disposed of in a properly
constructed sealed pit or disposed of in an unsealed pit or one that was
improperly constructed and which therefore may be more susceptible to
leaching.”°** [Emphasis added.]

As part of his planning process, Mr. MacDonald provided a list of mud pits to the Parties
for their comment.” Included on that list were Oso 9A and Oso 9B.°” (Perenco’s use of
both of these sites had been noted in GSI’s 2012 expert report.?*°) As for the Yuralpa
sanitary landfill pit and Yuralpa G, pit 2, the history of Block 21’s development is clear:
As reflected in GSI’s list of wells drilled in Yuralpa, with the exception of three wells
drilled by Texaco (Yuralpa 1) and Oryx (Yuralpa Centro | and 2), the Yuralpa field was
developed by Perenco.*” As for Oso 9, pits 2, 4, these pits were not sampled by Mr.
MacDonald, but they were situated within a large mud pit area and the pits surrounding
these two (pits 1, 3, and 6°°*) were sampled. All of those sampled pits showed regulatory

exceedances. The estimation of contamination at these two pits resulted from Mr.

Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 604.
This correspondence was supplemented by discussions with Party representatives. Mr. MacDonald
commented: “... I think the pit — I'll call it the "Pit mandate" — was through available information and
attempts, very strong attempts, to affirm with the Parties that no one had an objection.” Tr. (1) (MacDonald)
(11 March 2019) 132:16-19.

During the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald noted that he had sent an email or a letter regarding the sampling
of Oso 9A and 9B. “It was clear to us from representations made in the field that those areas received mud
pit materials from Perenco.” Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 130:15-17.

MacDonald’s drawing an inference from the regulatory exceedances which he had

confirmed at the surrounding pits.°”?

The Tribunal understood from its mandate discussions with the Independent Expert at the
outset of his work that he considered sampling roughly half of Perenco’s pits and inferring
from the results of that sampling estimates of contamination in the balance of the pits. In
the end, Mr. MacDonald did far more sampling than inferring:

“The mud pits considered in our work were therefore limited to those that

the Parties agreed were associated with prior Perenco operations. All of

the Perenco_mud_pit areas were inspected, and_almost_all were
sampled.”!°° [Emphasis added.]

Given what the Tribunal stipulated in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, specifically
its stated intention to have all mud pits used by Perenco assessed, the Tribunal does not
consider that Mr. MacDonald’s reasons for deciding to sample or assign responsibility by
means of the limited use of inference to the mud pits listed above at paragraph 818 to be

unreasonable. It holds therefore that he did not step outside of his mandate.

(c) Did the Expert exceed his mandate in not conducting sampling at sites that
were sampled by either of the Parties’ experts?
While Perenco raised many objections that would, if accepted, have significantly narrowed
the scope of contamination found by the Expert, Ecuador raised a different set of issues
focusing on Mr. MacDonald’s inability or failure, as the case may be, to sample certain

sites which were sampled by one or the other of the Parties’ experts.

Ecuador pointed out that the Expert did not sample every site where contamination was
found by one or the other of the Parties’ experts. For example, IEMS investigated the

groundwater situation at the Yuralpa landfill (“Yuralpa LF”), but Ramboll was not able to

Independent Expert Report, Table 5.1: “Mud Pits 2 and 4 at Oso 9 are associated with Perenco but were not
investigated by Ramboll or the Parties. The contents of these two mud pits are likely of similar quality as that
found in neighbouring Mud Pit 1 and Mud Pits 3 and 5, respectively.”

sample this site due to logistical difficulties. !°°' Ecuador argued that since at least one well
at every site has a detected exceedance of TPH and/or barium, it would be reasonable to
assume that the groundwater at Yuralpa LF would be equally affected. !°°? Ecuador noted
further that Perenco also installed wells at Yuralpa B and used mud pits at that site. Due to
an oversight, Ramboll did not investigate the Perenco mud pits at that site.!°? Given that
Mr. MacDonald found that 87% of the mud pits constructed or used by Perenco did not
conform to the performance criteria of RAOHE, Ecuador argued that it was reasonable to
assume that the mud pits at this site would also not have met the standards prescribed by
RAOHE. !™ Finally, during the Expert Hearing, Ecuador referred to evidence that Perenco
had disposed of mud pit materials generated at other sites at Payamino 16.!°° Again,
considering that 85% of the Perenco mud pits did not conform to RAOHE’s performance
criteria, Ecuador argued that it is reasonable to assume that the mud pits at this site would

also not have conformed to RAOHE.!°6

The Tribunal has given due consideration to this concern and believes that it is fair, in view
of the above circumstances, to adjust upward by US$7.7 million the damages estimated by

Mr. MacDonald and found by the Tribunal to be allocable to Perenco.

A related issue is Ecuador’s attempt to have the Tribunal increase the damages because of
the fact that Perenco performed certain workovers of production wells that had been drilled
by its predecessors. Ecuador contended that just as the initial drilling of the production
wells would have generated wastes, so too would the workovers. In the period leading up

to the Expert Hearing, the Tribunal agreed with Ecuador’s request that Perenco produce its

workover reports. 007

This issue was raised relatively late in the proceedings. Perenco objected to this on the
grounds that even though seven years ago Perenco produced some evidence about
workovers that it had performed, Ecuador was now seeking to expand the record on that
historical point, while continuing to withhold the same kind of information about its own
operations that actually was relevant to the Tribunal’s decision at this stage, i.e. records of
Petroamazonas’ post-July 2009 records of workovers that it had been ordered to
produce.!8 (The Tribunal has already expressed its disagreement with Perenco’s

characterisation of Ecuador’s alleged failure to comply with Procedural Order No. 17.)

In the end, the Independent Expert agreed with Perenco that the issue had been raised
relatively recently and that the workover reports that he had received early on in his work
were relatively few in quantity. It was only in the last phase of the counterclaim proceeding
that he was given more documentation relating to workovers.!°” From his review of the
documentation, although Mr. MacDonald agreed with counsel for Ecuador that workovers
typically would generate residues!°!°, based on the information before him (which
indicated the use of drilling fluids, but not what chemical additives were used, nor whether
barium sulphate was used), he was unable reasonably to estimate Perenco’s potential

contribution at sites where workovers were performed.

This is an exercise of technical judgement and the Tribunal declines to second-guess the

Independent Expert on this determination. Ecuador’s workover claim is therefore rejected.

(d) The land-use debate

During his visits to the Blocks, Mr. MacDonald examined the Napo River Basin and the

dominant features of the Blocks which he then briefly described in his Report:

“... L observed that local topographic conditions of the platforms varied
significantly, with some located in hilly regions steep-sloped gullies,
others within swampy lowlands, and still others within agricultural
settings. Almost all sites, however, were surrounded by rainforest of

varying ecological value (e.g., primary and secondary forests; forests with
evidence of concurrent agricultural use). As described further... while
some portions of this forest are designated as having special significance,
this entire rainforest ecosystem is considered to be environmentally
sensitive and to have intrinsic value, regardless of whether it is
pristine.”!0!!

 

Both Parties objected to certain land-use designations employed by the Independent Expert.
Leaving aside a few other objections to his designations, the main issue of dispute between
the Parties on this aspect of the Report was that Ecuador considered that certain sites that
the Independent Expert designated as “agricultural” should have been designated as
“sensitive ecosystem” and that that two water bodies should have been classified as
sensitive ecosystem areas rather than agricultural.'°!? Perenco considered that certain sites
that the Independent Expert designated as “sensitive ecosystem” should have been
considered “agricultural.” It is not necessary to repeat the objections in detail; they are set

out above at paragraph 670 et seq above.

The approach to be taken by the Independent Expert was set out in the Interim Decision on

Counterclaim at paragraph 495, under the heading: “Conclusion on land-use criteria”:

“491. ... the Tribunal considers that the treatment of this issue should be
guided by the Ecuadorian authorities’ practice in relation to the Blocks.
The evidence shows that the authorities accepted the application of
industrial land-use criteria in certain parts of Blocks 7 and 21, in particular,
in the January 2003 Remediation Plan relating to the Payamino Sanitary
Landfill, Payamino 22, Payamino CPF, Coca CPF and Jaguar CPF as
approved by the Ministry, the report of a clean-up of a spill at Payamino
19 in June 2009, the Consortium’s EIS for the construction of the Oso A
and Oso B platforms and the Yuralpa Norte platform in April and October
2006, and, most significantly, in the environmental impact studies
commissioned by Ecuador in 2010.

492. Ecuadorian authorities similarly accepted the application of
agricultural land-use criteria in areas surrounding platforms in Blocks 7
and 21 such as in the Ministry-approved remediation plan for the May
2007 spill from the Oso 2 flow line, the January 2008 Ministry-approved
remediation plan for a spill in the Gacela-Payamino flow line in October
2007, and in the environmental impact studies commissioned by Ecuador
in 2010. In the present proceeding, IEMS itself accepted that the areas

Ibid., p. 10. Ecuador also argued that the Expert failed to fully capture the extent of contamination in the
tested areas.

311

surrounding Coca 6, Coca 8, Lobo 3, Lobo 1, Oso 9, Mono CPF, and
Payamino CPF were primarily used for agricultural purposes.

493. This is not to say that, once selected, the land-use criteria are
irrevocable and_the decision cannot be changed. However, there is
significant probative value to be derived from the authorities’ acceptance
of a particular land-use criterion with respect to the same area for the
purpose of measuring soil remediation.

494, It is also clear to the Tribunal that the sensitive ecosystem designation
is not limited to designated protected zones. RAOHE makes clear that the
designation applies in areas “such as the National Heritage of Natural
Areas and others identified in the corresponding Environmental Study.”
GST’s initial approach was to restrict the use of the sensitive ecosystem
criterion to those areas alone. The Tribunal notes that GSI itself accepted
that the “sensitive ecosystems criteria” might apply to a number of sites in
the Blocks which intersected with State-designated sensitive ecosystem
areas: Payamino CPF, Payamino |, Payamino 2-8, Payamino 19, Waponi-
Ocatoe and Nemoca”.

(3.1) Conclusion on land-use criteria

495. The Tribunal concludes that that in view of the 2008 Constitution’s
imperative in favour of the protection of the environment, in any case of
doubt where _a_site could be considered to fall under either of two
ignati the more stringent land-use designation should be applied.
In the Tribunal’s view, where a posterior land use has not been designated,
Article 395.4 of the 2008 Constitution’s focus on full restoration should
guide in determining the appropriate land use and it should be in favour of
the most envirc lly ive designation that is ible in the
i of the particular case. At the same time, the prior
determinations of the Ecuadorian authorities have significant_probative
value.”!°'3_ [Emphasis added.]

838. This was repeated in a summary form in the Tribunal’s Interim Decision on Counterclaim
at paragraph 611(15):
“In any case of doubt as to the applicable land-use criteria, subject to

prior determinations of Ecuadorian authorities which have significant
probative value, the more stringent land-use designation applies.”'°'

1015

In these instructions, the Tribunal wished to give the Independent Expert a degree of
latitude to determine what was appropriate in the circumstances of a specific case. If the
Ecuadorian authorities had previously made certain land-use determinations, those were to
be given “significant probative value”, but the Tribunal did not intend by this indication to
hold that any such prior determinations would be dispositive of the question in specific
cases and that the Independent Expert could not use his own judgement given the specific
characteristics of a particular site. (Otherwise, the Tribunal would have used words to the

effect that “the Ecuadorian authorities’ prior land-use determinations shall govern”.)

It is important to recall that having sampled the sites, the Independent Expert was then to
delineate the extent of contamination (because IEMS’ mapping methodology had been
rejected and because the Tribunal had doubts about GSI’s delineations). Thus, the issue of
land-use criteria would arise only once Ramboll had identified the location and type of
contamination and delineated its extent. Many of the determinations were not black and
white; Mr. MacDonald noted, for example, that TULAS defined agricultural land as
including lands that “maintain a habitat for permanent and transient species, in addition to
native flora.” !°'> Thus, reasonable people can differ as to when or whether a particular site
that exhibited agricultural characteristics could also have a part thereof which could be
considered to be sensitive ecosystem. In the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, the
Tribunal recognised that there could be cases of doubt where a site could be considered to
fall under either of two designations and directed that in such circumstances, the more
stringent designation should be applied. The intention was that the Independent Expert
should bear in mind how a particular site had been treated by the authorities in the past, but
if for some reason he considered that a more stringent land-use designation should apply,
he could so determine. At the same time, however, the Independent Expert was not obliged
to default to the sensitive ecosystem designation as Ecuador’s submissions seemed to
imply. Thus, in some instances, Mr. MacDonald adopted a land-use classification which

was favourable to Perenco’s position (which Ecuador considered to be insufficiently

stringent), and in other instances he adopted a classification which was favourable to

Ecuador’s position (and contested by Perenco as being unduly stringent).!°!°

Mr. MacDonald and his team surveyed the situation in the two Blocks, studied the record
of this counterclaim, including prior filings with the Ecuadorian authorities, and consulted
Ministry of Agriculture maps. After conducting the sampling activities, they plotted the
delineated areas of contamination on some 51 sites (using aerial photographs). The
Tribunal considers that it is not in a better position to make these site-by-site land-use

determinations and therefore declines to interfere with them.

(e) Mud pits
The issue of mud pits is more of a technical issue than a mandate issue, but in view of the
amount of time spent on the issue during the course of this counterclaim, the Tribunal
deems it appropriate to discuss the Independent Expert’s decision to apply RAOHE Table

7(a) to all of Perenco’s mud pits.

The Tribunal has already adverted to the “lined/unlined mud pit” controversy. Perenco’s
historical practice with respect to mud pits was not well-documented. Earlier in this
arbitration, after being ordered to produce documents pertaining to the design and
construction of mud pits, Perenco stated that it: “...does not have a specific written policy
for the construction, cleaning, monitoring, testing, and closing of pits.”!°!” Perenco relied
primarily on Mr. Saltos’ testimony and a note of interviews of former employees of Perenco
prepared by IEMS as well as some photographic evidence to show that liners were used in
some pits. However, the Tribunal was also mindful of a statement made by a former
Perenco employee to the effect that even when such liners were laid down, the wastes were
not deposited properly. !°'* For this reason, the Tribunal found that the evidence “was mixed

and not fully supportive of Perenco’s position because one former employee stated that

In his presentation on Day 2 of the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald reacted to both Party’s critiques of his
designations (dealing with Ecuador’s criticism at Slides 7-11 and Perenco’s at Slides 39-46.)

undue care was taken in depositing drilling muds such that the liners cracked under the
high temperatures.”!°!” This raised the possibility that even if Perenco lined some pits, the
way in which it prepared the pits, mixed the muds, or deposited them in the pits could

damage any liners that might have been laid down.

Moreover, earlier in the Counterclaim proceeding, Perenco’s experts treated all of
Perenco’s mud pits as if they had been “sealed” (essentially equating mud pits with no
impermeable liner laid down prior to depositing the mud, but which were said to be lined

with clay, with pits with impermeable liners). The Tribunal disapproved of this approach:

There also appears to be a disagreement on whether a pit which might have
been built in clay soil is to be considered to be “sealed”; GSI’s Mr. Connor
believed so, while IEMS did not. The Tribunal is not prepared to equate
what have been assumed to be impermeable clay-based pits with those that
have been lined within an impermeable synthetic barrier. This would first
require the Tribunal to assume that the bottom of an unlined pit was in fact
clay. IEMS adduced evidence that this was not necessarily the case; in
some instances sandy soil is located near the pits. During cross-
examination, Mr. Connor admitted that, for example, when looking at a
Coca 8 pit, GSI did not do any geotechnical testing and assumed that the
bottom of the pit was lined with clay.'°

The existence of liners capable of acting as an impermeable barrier between the muds and
the surrounding soil (and potentially groundwater) is of pivotal importance because
RAOHE prescribes two different standards in its Table 7. A stricter standard for the
treatment of the muds is applied to unlined pits than that applied to pits which have been

lined with an impermeable barrier.

Thus, the Independent Expert was instructed to satisfy himself as to the state of the mud
pits that Perenco used or constructed. The Tribunal advised that “if a pit has an
impermeable liner, Table 7(b) applies. If there is no impermeable liner, Table 7(a) applies.
In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective standard in Table 7(a)

applies.” !02!

847. Mr. MacDonald and his team examined the mud pits that had been used by Perenco. Among
other things, the mud pits were “visually inspected to assess the physical integrity of the
mud pits, identify the presence of any distinct soil cover layer, and determine whether there
was evidence of any synthetic mud pit liner material.”!°?? At footnote 180 of his Report,

the Independent Expert commented:

“The Parties have not provided any direct evidence as to whether liners
are present for any specific mud pit. As part of Ramboll’s investigation,
borings were designed to terminate above the suspected bottom of the mud
pit to avoid puncturing any potential liners (if present) and creating a
vertical migration pathway for contamination. Photographs taken by
Perenco at the time of closure of some mud pits show that an excavator
was typically used to treat the mud pit material in place, which likely
would have resulted in the tearing or ripping of any liner material that
might have been present. Therefore, Ramboll has conservatively assumed
that none of the pits are lined or that any liner is likely not intact.”!°%
[Emphasis added.]

848. He restated this finding in the comments following Table 5.1, the summary table on mud

pits findings:

‘No information was provided sufficient to confirm that synthetic or clay
liners are present beneath any specific mud pit. It should be clarified that
Ramboll did not drill through the bottom of the mud pits to determine the
presence or absence of liner material, since this would have compromised
the units if the liners were present. In some cases, Ramboll did observe
torn liner material along some mud pit perimeters, but had no information
regarding its condition or lateral extent in the rest of the mud pit.
Therefore, without exception, the leachability testing data was
conservatively compared to the standards for unlined mud pits presented
in RAOHE Table 7a.”!°*4 [Emphasis added.]

849. Thus, in the end, Mr. MacDonald was not persuaded that there was sufficient evidence of
competent impermeable liners (i.e., liners that, if actually installed prior to disposing of

muds, had maintained their integrity) such as to justify applying the less strict standard

expressed in RAOHE Table 7(b).'° In his Opening Direct Presentation at the Expert
Hearing, Mr. MacDonald stated that like GSI, Ramboll also observed portions of liner
material on the ground surface around some mud pits, but such material “was observed in
only at 8 of the 38 inspected Perenco mud pits (21%), with geogrid observed near the
surface of the pits in an additional three mud pits (likely as part of the cover material).”!°76
The closure reports and photographic evidence to which Perenco referred Mr. MacDonald
during the Expert Hearing raised questions in his mind. He testified that in two of the three
pit closure reports that he had been able to review, even though it appeared that plastic
liners had been laid down, Perenco itself had tested the pit contents against the more
stringent Table 7(a) of RAOHE rather than the standard applicable to lined pits.!°” He
noted further that the photos showed that an excavator was operating within the pit (in order
to mix the mud) and opined that this would imperil the integrity of any liner. He observed
further that there were gouging markings on the side of the pits which indicated that the
excavator was using a bucket with teeth which could cause damage to any liner that had

been laid down. !8

Notwithstanding Perenco’s cross-examination of Mr. MacDonald on the point, given the
absence of a written protocol and detailed pit closure reports, as well as the limited
photographic evidence of closure practices, together with the Expert and his team’s
inspection of the sites, the Tribunal considers that Mr. MacDonald was entitled to
determine that the more stringent standards should be applied. The Tribunal recalls in this

regard its prior instruction that: “In any case of doubt, the more environmentally protective

During the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald testified: “We only had three mud pit closure reports; Coca 19,
Jaguar 9, and Yuralpa landfill. That we looked at. They have pictures. They have some description, they are
in Spanish, but I can read Spanish. José reads it better than I do. And —but nonetheless, in no instance did
the reports describe or show treatment of mud pit materials outside of the mud pits. They show the contrary.
Two of the three sites, there is damage to the liners shown in the photos, and if two of the three sites the
Contractor for Perenco compared the mud pit testing results, the performance criteria for unlined pits. Okay.
So, there's no record and no evidence of competent liners that we've been provided with.” Tr. (1)

standard in Table 7(a) applies.” !°”° Therefore, the Tribunal leaves the Expert’s approach

undisturbed.

(f) | Groundwater sampling

The Independent Expert was instructed as follows:

“On the matter of groundwater testing, the expert shall undertake
groundwater sampling in accordance with the Tribunal’s determination of
the appropriate technical standard under Ecuadorian law and industry
practice as set out in this Decision. Its sampling shall be confined to the
sampling locations identified by IEMS and GSI. Given the effluxion of
time, it might be necessary to allocate responsibility for remediation as
between Perenco and Petroamazonas. The Tribunal will await the expert’s
report in this regard.”!070

Between 13 November and 14 December 2017, Ramboll collected samples from 34
permanent monitoring wells installed at 12 sites. The samples were analysed for TPH and
metals. The results of the laboratory testing are set out in Table 5.2 of the Report. In

summary terms, the Expert found:

“Based on Ramboll’s sampling results, TPH contamination in
groundwater above the TULAS standard is present in all 12 investigated
sites, and in 74% of sampled monitoring wells. The maximum observed
concentration of TPH was 1915 ug/L at Payamino 2/8, as compared to the
TULAS criterion of 325 yg/L. Barium is found at 58% of the sites, and in
38% of the sampled wells. The maximum observed concentration of
barium was 4700 ug/L at Gacela 1, as compared to the criterion of 338
ug/L. No other contaminants of concern were identified in the monitoring
wells.”!°!

Ecuador had no substantial criticisms of the Independent Expert’s work in this regard.!°*?

There appears to be no suggestion by Perenco that Mr. MacDonald sampled at sites not

Consolidated Expert Report, third bullet after Table 5.2.

Ibid., p. 51: “As MacDonald correctly points out at Section 3.2.3 (at p. 43), RAOHE does not specify
numerical cleanup standards for groundwater. He thus appropriately proceeded to compare the groundwater:
Maximum Permissible Limits from TULAS Book VI, Annex 1, Table 5 to the groundwater concentrations
determined for barium, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, zinc, and TPH. This is precisely what
IEMS and GSI did as part of their investigations.”

sampled by IEMS or GSI (although he did acknowledge that due to technical
considerations, two wells [PAY01-MW03 and JAGO2-MW-3] were advanced within areas

of high levels of soil contamination). !°?

However, Perenco took issue with Mr. MacDonald’s application of TULAS’ Table 5
groundwater criteria to soils with a clay content greater than 25%, “even though TULAS
specifically excludes such soils from these criteria.”!°*4 Perenco argued that if a soil
contained a clay content of greater than 25%, the regulation simply did not apply. During
the Expert Hearing, counsel for Perenco cross-examined Mr. MacDonald on the point and
during the expert witness conferencing session he also elicited testimony from GSI’s

Mr. Bianchi to this effect. !°> Mr. MacDonald disagreed with Mr. Bianchi on this point.!°*

The Tribunal sees both sides to this disputed point and the result is a closer call than for the
preceding issues. It is odd that the table specifies a clay percentage at all and for that reason
Perenco’s argument is hardly implausible. But TULAS does not go on to state that if the
clay content of the soil is greater than 25%, there is no need to investigate and/or remediate
the groundwater for contaminants. In this sense, the Tribunal can see the logic of the

position taken by the Independent Expert.

In the end, the Tribunal has decided to accept Mr. MacDonald’s approach for the following

two reasons.

E-453.

Consolidated Expert Report, p. 58.

Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 269:3-12: “one thing that is very clear in Ecuador, and it's not that
different in other countries in the region, when the regulations state something, you stick to that regulation.
And if it says 25 percent clay —I don't know the word in English —"fiscalizar"— you can't be regulated
when you're not falling within the regulation. It just doesn't apply. So, in the case when clay is greater than
25 percent, the regulation doesn't apply, and it says that. It applies when it's less than 25 percent.” See also.

Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 269:13-270:4: “This is one we might just have to disagree about, which
is okay. But, again, we were —I was not precluded from reading the regulations, interpreting then, nor of
having conversations with other consultants in Ecuador, including environmental counsel where I was
pushing and probing. It's no different than the TPH issue. It's very clear, for example, in RAOHE, that there
is absolute freedom to suggest alternative analysis under those regulations, and I interpret TULAS to be no.
different. So, again, I think we have a different view on this one.”

First, the Independent Expert’s summary of groundwater investigation findings (Table 5.2)
lists the lithology, in terms of percentage of clay, of each site and it shows variability in
such percentages at a site. For example, Mono 1, CPF records a clay content of 34.1% to
the north of the platform, 14.9% to the northeast of the platform, 38.8% to the east of the
platform in the mud discharge area and 18.2% to the south of the platform.!°*’ The Tribunal
sees force in the point made by Ecuador that the clay content of soils can vary, sometimes
substantially, at a particular site and it makes little sense to exclude groundwater
contamination manifesting itself in wells drilled in soils containing more than 25% clay
content when there are neighbouring wells drilled in soil that contains less than 25% clay
content that also manifest contamination. !°* The Tribunal shares Ecuador’s concern that
variability in clay content could lead to ineffective remediation if the 25% “cutoff rule”

contended for were to be applied.

Second, and related to the point just made, Mr. MacDonald pointed out at the Expert
Hearing that the permanent wells installed by Ramboll were able to capture groundwater

irrespective of the clay content of the soil.!°° In his words:

“There’s evidence of groundwater impairment at all wells. We meet the
definition of groundwater. There is no narrative in TULAS that says there
isn’t some remedial obligation if you have more than 25 percent clay, for
example. So, that’s what we did.”!"°

The Tribunal takes from his testimony that TULAS sets standards for the protection of

groundwater, not clay, and if the water extracted from a well (irrespective of the percentage

Tr. (2) (MacDonald) (12 March 2019) 403:7-19.

Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 70:14-18: “water encountered by Ramboll at all sampling locations
meets the definition of "groundwater" by TULAS, subsurface water that is located in the saturated zone where
all pore space filled with water at or above the atmospheric pressure.”

Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 71:14-19. In response to Perenco’s contention that the groundwater
samples had been misinterpreted and the chromatograms really showed plant wax, the Expert noted: “...for
those wells where it believed we weren’t —the findings weren't reflective of petroleum, in each and every
well the groundwater had changed, it had odors, in some cases we had petroleum droplets, in some cases
there was weathered crude in areas where we put the monitoring wells.” Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March

of clay content of the soil from which the groundwater was drawn) is contaminated, the

TULAS standards should apply.!°!
Therefore, the Tribunal leaves the Independent Expert’s approach undisturbed. !°4?

(g) Did the Expert adhere to the Tribunal’s instruction that when estimating
costs of any remediation for which Perenco is liable, “he shall be guided by
Ecuadorian costs”?

Perenco asserted that, in contravention of the Tribunal’s instructions, Ramboll’s unit costs
for remediation do not reflect local costs. !° It complained that Ramboll never provided a

copy of its quotes for the Parties’ verification!** but instead generated its soil remediation

numbers through a database (the “RACER” database) developed in the United States.!°45

These numbers, Perenco argued, substantially exceeded GSI’s unit costs, which themselves

had been based on the upper range of actual local costs. !°°

Perenco also asserted that Ramboll’s two quotes from two local contractors, Hidrogeocol
Ecuador and Ecuambiente, were obtained belatedly in the process of the Expert’s finalising
his report and were not reliable guides. Hidrogeocol’s unit cost for transportation and
treatment of soil contaminated with TPH and heavy metals amounted to $260/m;, six times
higher than Petroamazonas’ actual unit cost of $39/m3 for comparable remediation
work. !°47 Similarly, Ecuambiente’s unit cost for transportation and treatment of soils with

just TPH was $56/m3, while Petroamazonas’ actual unit cost was $46/m3 for comparable

Expert’s Direct Presentation, Slide 64; Tr. (1) (MacDonald) (11 March 2019) 70-71.

As noted previously, it was contended that the Expert's groundwater samples were starkly different from the
results obtained by IEMS and GSI, But Mr. MacDonald pointed out in his Direct Presentation, Slide 68, that:
“Neither IEMS nor GSI has made their data available, nor provided details; thus, cannot comment on what is
described as remarkably different results.”

remediation work. !#* In Perenco’s view, the Expert did not appear to have obtained a range

of quotes from other contractors nor to have taken account of the fact that quotes provided

to foreign companies —especially in the context of litigation— are typically higher. !*

Perenco submitted, therefore, that the Tribunal should apply the actual costs recently
incurred by Petroamazonas itself, which provide the “best guide for estimating comparable
remediation works.” !°°° These were available from Petroamazonas’ own public documents
and they showed, in Perenco’s submission, that remediation works in Blocks 7 and 21 were

substantially lower than Ramboll’s estimates, e.g. $39/mé for treatment and disposal of soil

with TPH and metals, as compared to Ramboll’s estimate of $160/m3. 1051

In sum, Perenco’s criticism of the Independent Expert’s approach to unit costs was that

1052

even though Ramboll claimed that RACER was used only as a reference, '"’~ it had actually

relied on RACER estimates rather than the belatedly obtained local quotes from
Hidrogeocol or Ecuambiente (which were also exaggerated, given the litigation context) or

more appropriately, Petroamazonas’ costs, as evidenced by publicly-available

documents. !°

The Tribunal considers it useful to set out Mr. MacDonald’s explanation of Ramboll’s costs
“solicitation process.”!°™4 The first part of his explanation referred to various criticisms

made by Perenco and addressed them in turn:

Belated solicitation of quotes'°**: “So, one here is that we appear to receive
the quotes in late November and December [of 2018]. ... but the actual
quote —what we’ll call ‘solicitation process,’ began much earlier in the
year.

For ease of reading, the Tribunal has inserted subject titles into this extract of the transcript.

322

What was in the Expert Report was simply the most recent communication
that we had. It was not to suggest that that was the date we got some
information and in two weeks’ time we put it all together. ... So, our
solicitation process began, really, in the first quarter of 2018 and, again,
the December quotes are simply the latest versions after many revisions
and clarifications between folks that we reached out to in Ecuador.

Too few quotes: Ramboll does not appear to have obtained a range of
quotes from other contractors. Actually, that’s not true. That quote or cost
information were solicited from seven contractors in Ecuador and actually
total of 11. Four didn’t have an interest. But there were communications
with several and I’ll explain in a minute how we did this, taking into
account quotes provided to foreign companies are higher.”!°%°

866. Mr. MacDonald then discussed the safeguards that Ramboll took in an attempt to ensure
that higher quotes would not be provided either due to its being a foreign company or
because the quotes were being used in the context of litigation and therefore might be

inflated:

. we solicited and utilized a consultant in Ecuador, Hidrogeocol. ...
they’re consultants, and they oversee remedial work and believed that
them asking for certain things would be faster, more effective than us
because they are local.

They know each other, and we think generally that proved true.

The other thing is that these quotes, you know, in a litigation context, are
typically higher. We required Hidrogeocol to sign a nondisclosure
agreement, so details of the Project, identity of the, I mean —sure, people
know what's going on in eastern Amazon, sure, to some degree, but we
addressed this by just this factor.

So, he was talking to them on a local level, not in the context of litigation.
not in the context of a U.S. entity, you know, per se, to try to get as true as
information as possible. And, well, we did—it was an iterative process and
we certainly, over time, incorporated them into our remedial cost
estimation.” !°’ [Emphasis added.]

 

 

 

867. Mr. MacDonald then explained how RACER was used in Ramboll’s cost estimation

process:

“We used RACER. RACER is a database which contains information on
many, many projects, 1500 or so from global locations.

1063

And the idea actually—for full disclosure, the U.S. Air Force developed
this database... And over time it became a global database, inputting
information from other companies' similar projects. And we use RACER
as a bit of a litmus test, confirmation resource, and particularly when there
are variations between costs from local contractors, the only costs that had
some component of—I'll call it "RACER thinking" related to the
treatment, transportation, disposal of soils. ...

In particular, and that was because we've seen a wide range of costs
coming out of Ecuador, and we wanted to see how it felt, sort of looked
within the context of RACER as a sort of a litmus test and a lot of folks
think that the estimates within RACER often come within 10 percent of
actual remediation costs.
Now, I'm not saying that holds true in each and every case, but it is actual
experiences companies have had in different places in the world; so why
not look at it? It was a I but most all of our costs
came from this iterative process of getting actual unit cost pricing from
local contractors in Ecuador.” !°* [Emphasis added.]

 

 

 

Given the above explanations, the Tribunal accepts that what looked from a reading of the
Independent Expert Report at first blush to be a last-minute push to find some remedial
cost estimates, was in fact the culmination of a more deliberative process that had gone on
for roughly eight months with the intermediation of a local Ecuadorian firm subject to non-
disclosure obligations. It further accepts Mr. MacDonald’s view that the “use of RACER
does not negate the fact that [Ramboll’s] costs are very heavy Ecuador-oriented”!°>? and
that RACER was used as a “confirmatory tool.”!° The Tribunal notes that Perenco has
argued that Ramboll’s estimated costs were higher than the numbers provided in the
Ecuambiente quote!°*! but as Mr. MacDonald testified, the unit pricing Ramboll received
“came out of Ecuador”!°, but was too low for the conceptual remediation plan that he and
his team developed and therefore the estimates were adjusted upwards. !°° The Tribunal

accepts that this as a proper exercise of Mr. MacDonald’s professional judgement.

Finally, with respect to its argument that the Tribunal should apply Petroamazonas’ costs,
Perenco relied on Petroamazonas’ 2018 Incinerox waste management contract (and a
statement in its 2017 bond offering from which Perenco calculated the cost of the

remediation that Petroamazonas had performed), asserting that these are valid prices given

> 1064

that they were obtained through “an open proposal and bid process’ which is “a good

way to get low prices”!°©. In its closing submissions, Perenco highlighted the following

text from these documents:

2018 Petroamazonas Contract

“Clause Five: Scope of the Work.-

5.3 - Treatment and/or final disposal of the removed waste, owing, for that
purpose, to comply with the environmental legal requirements applicable
to waste managers and all applicable environmental regulations.” !°
Petroamazonas’ 2017 Bond Offering

“On July 1, 2013, Petroamazonas’ board established Project Amazonia
Viva, which was later approved by the Ministry of the Environment on
June 3, 2014. This project seeks to eliminate sources of pollution and
remediate contaminated soils, which resulted from exploration and
production activities predating Petroamazonas’ own operations. Currently,
the project encompasses elimination and remediation efforts in exploration
blocks 11 (Bermejo), 56 (Lago Agrio), 57 (Shushufindi Libertador), 58
(Cuyabeno), 60 (Sacha), and 61 (Auca), which are carried out in
accordance with the Public Policy on Comprehensive Reparation and
existing environmental regulations, under the supervision and monitoring
of the Ministry of the Environment. For the period ending December 31,
2016, approximately 364,240 cubic meters of soil were remediated and
191 sources of pollution were eliminated as part of Project Amazonia
Viva. As a result, Petroamazonas was able to recover approximately 4,959
barrels of crude oil during the 2016 period. To date, Petroamazonas has
remediated approximately 732,956 cubic meters of soil and eliminated 520
sources of pollution since the implementation of Project Amazonia Viva
in 2014.

In 2016, Petroamazonas incurred expenses of approximately U.S.$23.1
million for the implementation of Project Amazonia Viva. For 2017,
Petroamazonas has an annual budget of U.S.$26.6 million for such project.
As of October 2017, Petroamazonas has invested approximately U.S.$19.4
million in this project.”!°°” [Perenco’s emphasis]

The Tribunal has carefully considered the Incinerox contract issue, in particular, because it
is related to Petroamazonas’ own remediation efforts in the Blocks and therefore seems to

be highly relevant.

At the Expert Hearing, Mr. MacDonald pointed out that there was “significant variability”
in the unit costs provided to Petroamazonas. For example, while Perenco pointed to a
contractor who evidently provided soil remediation services for TPH and metals at a cost
of US$39.06/m°, a different Petroamazonas contract carried a price of US$455.88/m?, some
12 times higher, for remediation services.'°°* Mr. MacDonald noted further that the scope
in the Incinerox contractual documents did not identify the specific remedial technologies
that would be employed. Therefore, he was skeptical of the suggestion that there really was
true comparability between the Incinerox contract’s services and what he contemplated

should be done:

“,.We've seen a couple of these RFPs. I cite two of them here, for soil
remediation of petroleum and metals, $39 a cubic meter to $455 a cubic
meter. Our unit pricing was 160, $150-160 a cubic meter. And —but the
scope in Petroamazonas' contract_documents did not identify specific
remedial technologies. So, you have to know more in order to determine

whether there's a valid comparison.
So, and it doesn't mean that our unit cost pricing is unreasonable. We

believe that it's not.”!© [Emphasis added.]

And:

“4t’s not clear specifically whether if some d what
is it and where is it embedded in these costs. So, I think we're very
confident in the unit pricing that we've developed for treatment,
transportation, and disposal. What's also clear in Ecuador is that the kinds
of materials and the contamination at these sites do require treatment. It's
not a direct excavate, transport, dispose. So, there's a treatment component
and that has to be carefully understood and clear. And at least from my
initial glance of this, it wasn't entirely clear_whether was
contemplated or not.”!°” [Emphasis added.]

The Tribunal shares the Independent Expert’s doubts that the services contemplated by the
Incinerox-Petroamazonas contract are comparable in scope and sophistication to what is

required to implement his remediation plan.

The Tribunal notes further Mr. MacDonald’s concern that the reverse auction process
employed by Petroamazonas serves to bring costs down but “‘it’s not guaranteeing that there

isn’t some effect ... of work quality.”!°’! Perenco itself adverted to this in its closing

submissions and it is an important point, in the Tribunal’s view. !°”

Mr. MacDonald moreover did not believe that it could be assumed that Petroamazonas’

costs are reflective of local costs in general. He testified in this regard at the hearing:

“Now, here's the thing with Petroamazonas, and, yes, they do some of their
own remedial work; right? Whether it's spills, releases, other things, and
they are doing it themselves; ... so, they themselves might provide things
like security, and community relations, and areas for equipment storage,
and all the infrastructure, and borrowed materials and, I mean, various
other things that might go into a remediation project, but that's different
than a potentially then a third-party implementing remedial work on behalf
of a responsible party.

So there is no basis for us to assume at this stage that if any remedial work
is done that is done by Petroamazonas. I don't know that, as opposed to a
third-party contractor. And I suspect that —but, again, I don't know, but
they would have to be very dedicated resources, so I didn't see here that it
was our job to try to handicap our costs assuming that Petroamazonas
would implement any remedial work at the end as opposed to a third
party... .!°73 [Emphasis added.]

In the end, the Tribunal is satisfied that Mr. MacDonald’s costs are usable, reasonable and

consistent with the Tribunal’s prior direction that local unit costs be employed.

4, The Tribunal’s quantification of the damages payable by Perenco

Having reflected on the evidence and the Parties’ submissions, the Tribunal began by
seeking to focus on the “knowns” of the contamination identified by the Independent
Expert. Contamination associated with Perenco’s mud pits and wells were first addressed.
As for the other forms of contamination, the Tribunal focused on: (i) the type of
contamination; (ii) where the contamination was located; (iii) whether the substances
detected were associated with drilling or with ongoing oilfield operations; (iv) whether any
of the wells where the contamination was found were drilled by Perenco; (v) how long a
platform had been used before Perenco arrived on the scene; (vi) whether there was record
evidence showing spills or other contamination at the site prior to, or during, Perenco’s
operatorship; and (vii) whether, in the case of groundwater contamination, the groundwater
monitoring well at which the contamination was detected was proximate to contamination
or a site feature (e.g., mud pit, formation water pit) which had already been attributed to
either a predecessor or to Perenco.!* The Tribunal also took note of instances where
Perenco accepted partial or full responsibility for contamination at a particular site or area

of a site.

If a site was one which was contaminated by barium and the well had been drilled by a
Perenco predecessor, the Tribunal decided that contamination should not be attributed to
Perenco. For example, Lobo 01 was drilled in February 1989; 100% of the remediation

costs ($1.361 m) was allocated to the ‘Perenco predecessors’ responsibility bucket’.

Conversely, if an incident of contamination was indubitably tied to Perenco’s operations
(Perenco-drilled wells and mud pits being the leading examples), or one for which Perenco
accepted partial or full responsibility (e.g., Mono CPF, where Perenco accepted
responsibility for “some costs” for an oil spill in 2008!°7>), the estimated remediation costs
associated therewith were included in ‘Perenco’s responsibility bucket’. For example, the

Jaguar 9 production wells were drilled by Perenco in July 2004. The $541,000 for soil

Some groundwater contamination was attributed to a likely source (say a mud pit). If it was non-Perenco,
then all remedial responsibilities were assigned the predecessor(s) (e.g., Coca-2-MW 1), and if Perenco’s,
then all remedial responsibilities were assigned to Perenco (e.g., Oso 9).

Annex 1 to Perenco’s Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, p. 15.

328

879.

880.

881.

882.

1076

remediation found by the Independent Expert was allocated entirely to Perenco’s

responsibility bucket.

Likewise, the mud pits at Oso 9, 10-12, 15-20 give rise to a $5.317 million remediation
cost and a groundwater remediation cost of $3.415 million. Both were allocated to Perenco.
The Tribunal reasoned in this regard that groundwater impairment areas adjacent to mud
pits or former formation water pits were more likely than not to be associated with those
structures and were therefore attributed to the entities that constructed or used them.!°7
(The Tribunal also considered that in some cases it could not discount contributions by
Petroamazonas to groundwater impairment (e.g. the API separator at Coca 2/CPF, Gacela
1/CPF and Payamino 1/CPF). Hence for groundwater impairment remediation costs, in
those cases, the Tribunal not only allocated costs as between Perenco and its predecessors,

but also included Petroamazonas in the time-weighted allocation.)

As noted above at paragraph 877, the Tribunal also considered the type of contaminant.
Barium was associated with well drilling and allowed the Tribunal to allocate barium
exceedances to the category of the drilling operator (i.e., Perenco or its predecessors).
Where the environmental media were affected by TPH, the Tribunal considered that this
was a result of an operational release of crude oil. Such operational releases could occur

before, during, or after Perenco’s operatorship.

Thus, for certain issues, particularly in the areas of soil and groundwater contamination,
the time-based allocation method was also employed. Given that contamination can occur
from ongoing operational mishaps and mix with contamination caused by previous
operators, allocating responsibility based on time of operations is, in the Tribunal’s view,

an appropriate method to deal with the uncertainty.

As a result of this exercise, the Tribunal considered that responsibility could fall within

five combinations of persons responsible therefor:

An example going in the opposite direction is Coca 2. The impairment north of the formation water pit and
west of the mud pit was fully attributed to predecessors.

329

883.

884.

1077

(i) Instances where the contamination identified by the Independent Expert was
attributable to Perenco’s predecessors only (for example at sites where
exceedances of barium alone or with other metals were associated with well
drilling conducted by a prior operator);

(ii) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco (for example
where exceedances of barium alone or with other metals was associated with
well drilling by Perenco or in the case of Perenco’s mud pits);

(iii) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco, its
predecessors and its successor (for example, where each used a particular
operational structure (e.g., an API separator) at a site where groundwater
impairment was found);

 

(iv) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco and its
predecessors, but not to Petroamazonas (due to the limitations on the
Independent Expert’s sampling discussed above which lessened the chances
of post-Perenco contamination being found); and

(v) instances where the contamination was attributable to Perenco and
Petroamazonas (due to the fact that the site was developed by Perenco and
Petroamazonas continued operations there).

In the latter three combinations, in some instances, the Tribunal allocated the costs of
remediation as between Perenco and another party or parties based on record evidence of
timing of well drilling and/or mud pit construction and use, spills or other incidents, and
taking into consideration Perenco’s express assumption of responsibility (but not being
bound by any limitations contained therein). In other cases, the time-weighted approach
was employed when the record evidence could not be used to discern between Perenco’s

predecessors’ activities and those of Perenco.

For example, with respect to Jaguar 01, which was drilled from November 1987 to January
1988 and operated by Perenco’s predecessors before Perenco arrived on the scene, in
Annex | to Perenco’s comments on the Independent Expert’s Report, Perenco assumed
responsibility for “some costs” for soil and groundwater remediation. !°”’ The Tribunal has
fixed responsibility on Perenco for the impact of TPH contamination around the valve

station, which had resulted from an oil spill reported in 2005-06, as well as partial

Annex | to Perenco’s Comments to the Independent Expert Report dated 22 February 2019, pp. 2 & 5 (based
on Ramboll’s Estimated Costs).

330

885.

886.

1078

responsibility for the swampy area downslope of the valve station. In this case, the Tribunal
has allocated US$1.997 million to Perenco’s predecessors and US$1.107 million to
Perenco. (The latter figure does not include US$438,000 for remediation of TPH detected
in groundwater which the Tribunal attributes to a release in 2005/06, during Perenco’s

operatorship.)

Similarly, in Jaguar 02, drilled in January 1994 and taken out of service in 2000, and
therefore only operated by Perenco’s predecessors, there was a pre-existing non-Perenco
mud pit which experienced a slope failure. This was not attributed to Perenco.
Contamination in the barium and other metals-affected areas northeast of the platform, west
of the mud pit, and along the northern stream was also attributed to Perenco’s predecessors.
For the areas with surficial crude resulting from the spill in 2006, Perenco was considered
wholly responsible. In Annex | of Perenco’s comments on the Report, Perenco assumed
responsibility for “some costs” associated with soil remediation due to an oil spill “of
unknown date” and “some costs” for groundwater remediation. !°78 In the result, a small
part of the responsibility was allocated to Perenco (US$196,000 for Perenco versus

US$8.308 million to its predecessors).

In cases of likely layering of contamination by successive operators, the Tribunal employed
a time-based allocation of remedial costs based on Perenco’s length of operatorship as a
percentage of (i) its predecessors’ operatorships, (ii) Petroamazonas’ operatorship, or (iii)
both. The timeframe selected to allocate responsibility as between Perenco and its
predecessors assumed that releases to the environment began at the time of the first
production well installation and continued through to July 2009. For affected areas that
could be attributed to CPF operations, the initial release was assumed to have occurred
when the CPF was constructed. In this respect, the allocation of responsibility to Perenco
is conservative, because it does not consider the possibility of later contaminant release
dates and the fact that not all of the oil fields were actively exploited by prior operators

after the date of first production well installation.

887.

888.

889.

Time-weighted sharing was used for soil contamination (when the record evidence could
not be used to allocate costs, as noted in paragraph 883 above), and groundwater
impairment. For example, with respect to the Gacela 02/CPF, for the groundwater
impairment downstream of the API separator, the Tribunal considered it appropriate to
allocate some responsibility to Petroamazonas due to its continued use of the separator. For
the groundwater impairment to the southeast of the facility, the soil samples were collected
shortly after Perenco’s tenure came to an end and responsibility therefor is allocated as
between Perenco and its predecessors. As a result, Perenco was assigned US$452,530 in
remedial costs, its predecessors were assigned US$458,990, and Petroamazonas was

assigned US$485,480 in remediation costs.

The approach taken by the Tribunal, as just described, had been applied to each site and
the results of this process are set out in Annex A to this Award which sets forth the
Tribunal’s findings in tabular form for: (i) sites where Perenco used mud pits and/installed
crude oil production wells; (ii) sites where responsibility for soil remediation is allocated
between prior operators and Perenco; (iii) groundwater sites where responsibility is
allocated between prior operators, Perenco, and Perenco’s successor; and (iv) certain other

sites that the Tribunal has accepted give rise to responsibility on Perenco’s part.

Applying the foregoing approaches, the remedial responsibilities estimated by
Mr. MacDonald in the Independent Expert Report were allocated as follows (prior to

further adjustment):

A. Mud pits and Perenco-installed wells

The total remedial estimate of US$50,017,000 is associated with sites where
Perenco used mud pits or installed production wells.

Of this sum:

US$49,604,320 is attributed to Perenco,

US$114,080 is attributable to Perenco’s predecessors, and
US$298,600 is attributable to Perenco’s successor.

recovery of damages.

The Tribunal noted at paragraph 1086 of its Decision on Counterclaims:
Decision, the Perenco tribunal has issued no decision yet on the counterclaims before it. Therefore, this

For sites operated by Perenco where it did not use mud pits or install production
wells, total remedial costs for soils amount to US$88,538,000.

Of this sum:

Applying the time-based allocation method, US$27,522,810 is attributed to
Perenco, and

US$61,015,190 is attributable to Perenco’s predecessors.
Groundwater

Total remedial costs for groundwater amount to US$21,326,000.
Of this sum:

Applying the time-based allocation method, US$8,856,760 is attributed to
Perenco:

US$11,250,680 is attributable to Perenco’s predecessors, and

US$1,218,550 is attributable to Perenco’s successor.

The total attributed to Perenco before adjustment is US$85,938,890.
Adjustment

The Tribunal has found that it must make an upward adjustment to this figure
to account for certain sites identified by Ecuador which the Expert overlooked
or was unable to sample. It has thus added the sum of US$7.7 million for
remediation of mud pits at Payamino 16 and Yuralpa B, and the remediation of

groundwater at the Yuralpa landfill.

This brings the total to US$93,638,890.

Effect of the Burlington award

The Tribunal turns to the issue of how to deal with the Burlington award. It will be recalled

that that tribunal left it to the present Tribunal to sort out the question of potential double-

‘As of the date of the present

1085

In the latest phase of this proceeding Ecuador has not disputed that there is a substantial
territorial overlap between the contamination to be remediated as estimated by
Mr. MacDonald and that estimated by the Burlington tribunal. 1080 Tt is evident, however,
that Mr. MacDonald identified for remediation larger areas and additional volumes of soil
contamination, additional mud pits and additional sites with groundwater contamination,
and used higher in-country remediation costs than the Burlington tribunal estimated.!°*!
Ecuador argued that Mr. MacDonald thus did not find the same harm as the Burlington
tribunal and Perenco remained liable for the additional and/or different remedial areas,

volumes and costs. !°*

 

Ecuador therefore proposed a framework based on a site-by-site comparison of areas,
depths, volumes and costs between identified by Mr. MacDonald and the Burlington
tribunal.!°* In case of any uncertainty, Ecuador stated that it had assumed there was an
overlap and gave credit to Perenco. Under the framework, on Ecuador’s analysis, Perenco

was liable for US$130,801,100: !°%*

(a) Soils: Perenco was liable for the additional remedial volumes and costs
for the following: (i) sites for which the Burlington tribunal did not award
any remedial costs; (ii) sites where Mr. MacDonald delineated different
areas; sites or areas where Mr. MacDonald’s sampling concluded that
contamination extended beyond or deeper than the Burlington tribunal’s
findings; (iii) sites or areas where the horizontal and vertical extent of the
contamination estimated by Mr. MacDonald and the Burlington tribunal
were similar, but in respect of which Mr. MacDonald estimated higher
remediation costs. !°85

 

Tribunal lacks the necessary information or basis to adopt any specific measures — to fashion its decision, to
borrow Ecuador’s phrase — to prevent double recovery, a task that it must leave to the Perenco tribunal as the
one deciding in second place. This being said, this Tribunal nonetheless states that, as a matter of principle,
the present Decision cannot serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage.”

(b) Mud pits: Perenco was liable for the higher remediation costs at Condor
Norte and the Payamino WTS as well as the full remediation costs
estimated for non-compliant mud pits at 11 sites, for a total of
US$ 28,304,000. 1°86

(c) Groundwater: Perenco was liable for the nine additional sites identified
by Mr. MacDonald as requiring groundwater remediation and the
estimated higher costs for the remediation of Coca 2/CPF.!87

In addition, Ecuador argued that it was entitled to abandonment costs in addition to the
US$929,722 granted by the Burlington tribunal for the seven sites listed in Perenco’s
November 2008 Well Site Abandonment Plan that was never carried out and which sites

Petroamazonas never operated. '°8*

Perenco’s argument on this point in essence was that the Burlington payment pursuant to
the Settlement Agreement “irrevocably, fully and finally paid and discharged, and
satisfied” all of the Consortium’s obligations and liabilities related to Ecuador’s

1089

counterclaims. If that argument was not accepted, at the very least, in Perenco’s

submission, that amount paid must be set off from any remediation costs that this Tribunal
might award to Ecuador in this proceeding.!”” Perenco argued that Ecuador did not dispute
this.!°! Applying its proposed corrections to Mr. MacDonald’s findings, which would
result in damages lower than what Ecuador had already received in full satisfaction of its

counterclaims, the Tribunal should enter an award of zero counterclaims damages. 1092

The Tribunal obviously has charted a different course from that proposed by either Party.
It has not estimated damages of US$130,801,100 payable to Ecuador by Perenco, nor has

it agreed with Perenco’s ‘zero counterclaims damages’ contention.

By the time of the Expert Hearing, Ecuador was acknowledging that a substantial overlap
environmental damages existed between the US$39,199,373 awarded by Burlington and
what Mr. MacDonald has found. (At the Expert Hearing, Ecuador indicated that the
maximum amount subject to double-recovery was US$29,078,900.)!°°? Mindful of the
Burlington tribunal’s statement that “as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot
serve and may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage”!*, the

Tribunal has thought long and hard about how to protect against double recovery.

The two tribunals have addressed the issues in significantly different ways, both
substantively, in terms of their findings on Ecuadorian law, and technically, in terms of
evaluating the expert evidence of contamination in the Blocks. The Burlington tribunal
relied upon IEMS’ and GSI’s sampling as augmented by the tribunal’s site visit to the
Blocks. The present Tribunal had doubts about the work of both side’s experts and opted
to make the main findings on Ecuadorian law that would allow the Parties the possibility
to negotiate a settlement and if they were unable to do so, the Tribunal indicated its

intention to appoint an independent expert.

No disrespect at all is intended to the distinguished members of the Burlington tribunal,
each of whom the present Tribunal holds in high regard, by the present Tribunal’s deciding
that Mr. MacDonald was better situated than that tribunal to estimate the extent of
contamination. The work performed by Mr. MacDonald and his team from Ramboll is
more likely to have comprehensively and accurately analysed the work of IEMS/GSI (both
their strengths and weaknesses) than the Burlington tribunal was able to do. After
thoroughly reviewing that work and designing a further sampling campaign in consultation
with the Parties, Mr. MacDonald was, in the present Tribunal’s view, in a far better position
to capture and delineate the extent of the contamination in the areas of the Blocks that he
was permitted to measure. Hence, the Tribunal has decided to treat the US$39,199,373

awarded by the Burlington tribunal, and paid by Burlington in its settlement, as a down

payment towards the total amount of damages that the present Tribunal has determined are

payable by Perenco, the actual operator of the Consortium.

The grand total after adjustments of US$93,638,890 stated above at paragraph 889 is thus
further adjusted by crediting to Perenco the prior payment of US$39,199,373 to arrive at a
figure of US$54,439,517 which Perenco shall pay to Ecuador.

6. Direction on Ecuador’s use of the proceeds

Perenco argued that any damages awarded to Ecuador should not be used to offset the
damages owed to Perenco. The Tribunal should instead order that Ecuador deposit that
amount into a remediation fund that Ecuador must use solely for the purpose of remediating
the Blocks.'> This, according to Perenco, was the only way to ensure that the Tribunal’s
objective of protecting the environment was truly achieved and that Ecuador fulfilled its
promises to use the funds to remediate, and that the entire counterclaims process is not
subverted for Ecuador’s opportunistic monetary gain.!°*° Perenco noted that Ecuador had
no objection to such an order and all that a remediation fund would do would be to hold it

to its word.!°7

On this point, Ecuador’s Attorney-General confirmed at the Expert Hearing Ecuador’s
prior statement during the earlier counterclaims phase that “any damages that will be
granted to Ecuador for the counterclaims would be devoted to the restoration of the
ecosystems and Ecuador wouldn’t have any problem whatsoever if the Tribunal felt an
order to this point should be made, an order saying that any damages that would be granted
to Ecuador shall be devoted to the full restoration of the ecosystems as provided for in the

Constitution of Ecuador.” !08

The Tribunal has reflected on the Parties’ submissions. Insofar as Perenco’s request for two
separate awards of damages being made, one in favour of each Party, with the
counterclaims damages to be paid into a remediation fund, the Tribunal observes that
making an order that would require continued monitoring of Ecuador’s remediation
activities would be inconsistent with the Tribunal’s role under the ICSID Convention.
Subject only to the limited procedures contemplated in Articles 49-51 of the Convention,

upon issuing its Award, the Tribunal is functus officio.

The Tribunal moreover believes that it is in both Parties’ interests to bring this lengthy
proceeding to an end and thereby allow both to move forward. For that reason, the Tribunal
has decided to issue a single Award which specifies the damages owed by each Party to the

other, together with awards of costs associated therewith.

At the same time, the Tribunal expresses its firm expectation, based on solemn
representations made by both counsel for Ecuador and the Attorney General himself, which
the Tribunal has accepted, that the proceeds of the damages award made in favour of
Ecuador in the environmental counterclaim will be devoted to remediation of the Blocks.
The State has made plain its interest in remediating the contamination caused by oilfield
operations in the Oriente region of Ecuador. The Tribunal therefore states its clear
expectation that the monies payable to Ecuador will be devoted to this important task and

will not remain in the State’s general revenues.

DAMAGES CLAIMED IN RELATION TO THE INFRASTRUCTURE
COUNTERCLAIM

The Tribunal now turns to consider the infrastructure counterclaim. A number of points

need to be made in respect of this counterclaim:

(a) Ecuador raised exactly the same infrastructure counterclaim in the Burlington

arbitration as it has in this case against Perenco. ©

See Resp. PHB CC, paragraphs 118 & 122: Declaring “that Claimant is liable towards Ecuador for the costs
required to remedy the poor state of the infrastructure of Blocks 7 and 21 left behind by Perenco, given

(b) Both counterclaims are based on the alleged breaches of the identical provisions in
the PSCs for Blocks 7 and 21 1100 | and of Ecuadorian law. !!°!

(c) As can be seen in Annex B to this Award, the witnesses in respect of both
infrastructure counterclaims appear to be almost identical.

(d) The Burlington tribunal held a site visit which this Tribunal did not.!!?

(e) The amount claimed in both counterclaims was virtually identical.!!°

(f) Having visited the premises and heard from witnesses, the Burlington tribunal
awarded Ecuador the sum of US$2,577,119 itemized as follows: !!%
(i) ~—US$503,572.76 for the Gacela T-104 and Payamino-tanks, as well as minor
repairs to the pipelines;
(ii) US$1,462,553.43 for repairs related to pipelines and fluid lines; and
(iii) US$561,900 for Block 7 engines and US$49,093.58 for new vehicles.

Claimant's breach of [the Contract and Ecuadorian law]” and Ordering “Claimant to pay damages for its
failure to return the Blocks’ infrastructure in good condition to Ecuador, in an amount quantified at
US$17,231,458.85.” c.f. Burlington Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 53: Declaring “(ii) That
Burlington is liable towards Ecuador for the costs required to remedy the poor state of the infrastructure of
Blocks 7 and 21 left behind by Burlington” and Ordering “(iv) Burlington to pay damages for its failure to
return the Blocks’ infrastructure in good condition to Ecuador in an amount quantified at US$17,417,765.42
with interest at an adequate commercial interest rate from the date of disbursement thereof until the date of
the Award.”

See hs 892 & 908 of i Decision on Ci ims, where both Ecuador and Burlington
refer to Clause 5.1.8 of the Block 7 PSC and to Clause 5.1.7 of the Block 21 PSC.

See Resp. PHB CC, paragraph 102: “Perenco’s low-cost operations breached Articles 5.1.7 and 5.1.8 of Block
7 and 21 [Participation Contracts] which required it to use equipment and technology in accordance with the
best standards and practices of the international oil industry. Regardless of whether Perenco’s no-investment
policy was in breach of its contractual obligations, the Hearing confirmed that Perenco returned the Blocks”
infrastructure to Ecuador in appalling condition exceeding normal wear and tear in breach of the ‘obligation
de résultat’ in Articles 5.1.22 and 18.6 of Block 7 [Participation Contract] (Articles 5.1.21 and 18.6 of Block
21 [Participation Contract]) and Article 29 of the [Ecuadorian Hydrocarbons Law No. 2967] ...” c.f.
Burlington, Decision on Counterclaims, paragraphs 891-892: “Ecuador argues that, under both the PSCs and
Ecuadorian law, the Consortium was under a dual obligation (i) to construct, maintain and replace the
infrastructure on Blocks 7 and 21 in accordance with industry standards and (ii) upon contract termination,
to return the Blocks to the State in good working condition. According to Ecuador, the Consortium breached
both obligations and Burlington is accordingly liable for the remedial costs” and “Ecuador contends that ...
Article 29 of the Hydrocarbons Law, incorporated by reference in the PSCs, also provides for an obligation
to turn over the infrastructure to the State ‘in good condition’.”

(g) The Burlington case has now been completed with an award of 7 February 2017.!!°

(h) Ecuador, while initially seeking annulment of the damages awarded against it in
favour of Burlington and also of the decision on its environmental counter-claim,

did not seek annulment of the damages awarded to it in respect of the infrastructure

counterclaim. !!°°

(i) _ Ecuador and Burlington thereafter entered into the Settlement Agreement pursuant

to which the application for annulment of the Burlington award was withdrawn.!!°7

G) This Tribunal has already ruled that it will not dismiss the infrastructure

counterclaim or the environmental counterclaim on the grounds of res judicata.'!°

Accordingly, this Tribunal will have to consider the infrastructure claim, but must take into
account that another tribunal has already ruled on it and awarded damages in respect of it.
That tribunal not only heard virtually the same evidence about the same breaches and
considered the same allegations as to damage, but personally observed the climatic and

other conditions when it conducted its site visit.!!

What is more, as noted above, Ecuador did not seek the annulment of the part of the

Burlington award relating to infrastructure, '’'” so it must be assumed for present purposes

that it was content with such an award. Ecuador has rightly stated that it cannot benefit

from double recovery, so in many respects this Tribunal’s task is largely duplicative. |!!!

It is necessary at the outset to pay careful regard to what the Burlington tribunal said in

paragraphs 1080 to 1086 of its Decision on Counterclaims which are set out below: !!!?

“1080. As a final matter, the Tribunal must address the issue of double
recovery. As mentioned in paragraph 70 above, Burlington has called the
Tribunal’s attention to the potential risk of double recovery in respect to
the Respondent’s counterclaims since Ecuador “made a full claim for the
alleged environmental harm in each of the Burlington and Perenco cases.”
Burlington requests that the Tribunal address the “potentially pernicious
consequences” deriving from that risk so that “if the dispositive part of
either of the Awards on counterclaims provides for any compensation,
Ecuador would be prevented from enforcing the second award for the
extent that it has already been compensated by the first”.

1081. The Tribunal notes that there is no dispute between the Parties on
the issue of double recovery. More specifically, first, there is no question
that Ecuador claims compensation for the same damages in these and in
the parallel Perenco proceedings. For Burlington, Ecuador is “twice
seeking 100% recovery of precisely the same alleged damages for
precisely the same alleged injury on precisely the same legal and factual
bases.” Ecuador, for its part, does not deny that it seeks compensation for
the same harm in both cases, although it distinguishes the two arbitrations
in various ways, stating for instance that the arguments or the evidence in
both cases are not “exactly the same”. Ecuador actually relies on the joint
and several liability of the Consortium partners to justify its claim against
Burlington although only Perenco operated the blocks.

1082. Second, it is also common ground that claiming compensation for
the same damage in parallel proceedings creates a risk of double recovery.

See Response, paragraph 110: “Ecuador has always agreed to avoid double recovery in relation to its
counterclaims, as stated in numerous occasions throughout both this and the Burlington arbitration. Ecuador’ s
latest undertaking was made in the context of the Burlington Settlement, whereby it accepted that ‘Ecuador
no tiene derecho a recibir y no procuraré una doble compensacién en relacién con los mismos montos y
daiios ambientales y de infraestructura, constantes en la Decisién sobre las Reconvenciones en contra de
Burlington’ .” See also fn. 158: “Hearing on Counterclaims, Transcript (ENG), D8:P2426:L12-P2428:L8
(Arbitrator Kaplan, Silva Romero) (“ARBITRATOR KAPLAN: So if [Ecuador] were to recover something
in this one less than your full claim, then you would seek the balance in the other one; is that right? MR.
SILVA ROMERO: I think we have the duty to inform the Burlington Tribunal about the damages we would
obtain in the Perenco Tribunal, indeed. Yes, sir.”); Burlington 2014 Hearing on Counterclaims, Transcript
(ENG), D7:P2341:L13-1 (Opening, Silva Romero) (“The second comment I am specifically instructed to
make today is that we don’t want the Burlington Tribunal to have any concern regarding double recovery.
This is not what Ecuador is looking for. Ecuador is simply looking for the restoration of the ecosystems in
Blocks 7 and 21”, E-440. See also, Burlington Decision on Counterclaims, {| 70, CA-CC-59.”

Burlington Decision on Counterclaims [footnotes omitted].

 

    

 

341

In this context, Ecuador submits that whichever Tribunal issues the later
award on Ecuador’s counterclaims can readily address the risk and thus
Burlington’s fear of “pernicious consequences” is misplaced:

“Ecuador ... adds that its counterclaims will not result in ‘pernicious
consequences’. If Claimant alludes to the issue of double recovery, the
prohibition thereof exclusively applies when a party has already been
indemnified by a third party. In addition, Claimant cannot pretend to
ignore that any second award in the present cases against the Consortium
members could be fashioned in such a way as to prevent double recovery’.
International law, Ecuadorian law and international decisions offer
numerous mechanisms for preventing double recovery, including by
taking into account the monetary relief granted by any prior award”.

1083. Third, there is common ground between the Parties that a creditor
can only be compensated once for a given harm, and rightly so, as a
number of arbitral tribunals have acknowledged that the “prohibition of
double recovery for the same loss is a well-established principle.”

1084. Fourth, the Tribunal takes note that, prior to the end of the Hearing
on counterclaims, counsel for Ecuador clearly stated that Ecuador does not
seek double recovery in its claims against the Consortium members:

“The second comment I am specifically instructed to make today is that
we don’t want the Burlington tribunal to have any concern regarding
double recovery. That is not what Ecuador is looking for.”

1085. The Tribunal takes due notice of Ecuador’s representations, which
are in line with the general principle prohibiting double recovery.

1086. As of the date of the present Decision, the Perenco tribunal has
issued no decision yet on the counterclaims before it. Therefore, this
Tribunal lacks the necessary information or basis to adopt any specific
measures — to fashion its decision, to borrow Ecuador’ s phrase — to prevent
double recovery, a task that it must leave to the Perenco Tribunal as the
one deciding in second place. This being said, this Tribunal nonetheless
states that as a matter of principle, the present Decision cannot serve and
may not be used to compensate Ecuador twice for the same damage.”
(Emphasis on the original)

Nevertheless, consistent with the Tribunal’s independent duty to consider the case

presented to it, the Tribunal will briefly explain its views.
The Tribunal bases its determination of the counterclaim on two major considerations.
The first is that it is satisfied that in the declining years of the Blocks Perenco would, on

the balance of probabilities, have been less concerned about maintaining the facilities than

hitherto.!!!? Accordingly, it would not surprise the Tribunal that there were in fact some

breaches of the obligations in the PSCs set out below.

On the other hand, the Tribunal is conscious of the challenging conditions of operating in

the Amazon rainforest and the predisposition towards rust and corrosion in that climate.!!'4

The Tribunal is also conscious that the Blocks had been operated both before and after

Perenco’s tenure of the Blocks. !!!5

Legal Position

It is not disputed that certain clauses of the PSCs cover the Consortium’s obligations with

respect to the infrastructure of the Blocks not only during the operation of Blocks 7 and 21,

but also upon the termination of the PSCs.!!!6

Clause 5.1.8 of the PSC for Block 7 and clause 5.1.7 of the PSC for Block 21 required the
Consortium to use qualified personnel and suitable equipment and technology during the

operation of the blocks.

Clause 5.1.8 reads as follows:!!!7

“5.1 Obligations of the Contractor: ...

See also paragraph 252 above: “In the Tribunal’s view, it is a given that the Consortium’s thinking would
have been dominated by the looming contract expiry. The Tribunal believes that the sharply rising price of
oil leading up to October 2007 would have induced Perenco to seek to drill as many wells as were
economically possible in the Oso field in the time remaining in that Contract. According to Mr. Crick, in the
absence of a contract extension, Perenco would have stopped drilling in Block 7 in August of 2009 in order
to ensure an adequate payback on the new wells. Mr. Crick estimates that Perenco could have drilled 24
wells per year in Block 7. The Tribunal agrees and accepts Mr. Crick’s production profiles.”

Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraph 408.

The comments made with respect to Ecuador’s claim for environmental damages are likewise applicable to
the infrastructure claim. See Interim Decision on Counterclaim, paragraphs 490, 589, 591, 597 and 598.

See Ecuador’s Counter-Memorial on Liability and Counterclaims, paragraphs 916, 918-919, referring to
Clauses 5.1.7 and 5.1.21 of the Block 21 Participation Contract and Clauses 5.1.8 and 5.1.22 of the Block 7
Participation Contract as well as Clauses 18.6 of the two Participation Contracts and Article 29 of the
Hydrocarbons Law, incorporated by reference into the Participation Contracts. C,f Perenco’s Counter-

5.1.8 Employ qualified personnel, as well as equipment, machinery,
materials and technology, in accordance with the generally accepted
norms and practices of the international petroleum industry.”

Clause 5.1.7 similarly provides:!!!8

“5.1 Obligations of the Contractor: ...

5.1.7. To use personnel, equipment, machinery, materials, and
technology in accordance with the best standards and practices generally
accepted in the international hydrocarbon industry.”

Upon termination of the PSCs, clauses 5.1.22 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 7 and clauses
5.1.21 and 18.6 of the PSC for Block 21, provide that the Consortium shall return the wells
together with all equipment, tools, machinery, installations (acquired for and during the
term of the PSCs) to Petroecuador in good condition except for normal wear and tear, and

at no cost. These provisions provide precisely as follows:

Block 7 PSC!!

“5.1.22 Upon termination of this Contract, deliver the wells, property,
installations, equipment and infrastructure works related to this Contract
to PETROECUADOR, at no cost and in good condition, in accordance
with the provisions of Article twenty-nine (29) of the Hydrocarbons Law.”

“18.6 Upon the term of this Contract, either due to expiration of the
Exploitation Period or for any other reason during the same Period, the
Contractor shall deliver to PETROECUADOR, withouth cost and in good
condition, the wells which were in production and, in good condition
except for normal wear, all equipment, tools, machinery, installations and
other items which were acquired for purposes of this Contract.”

“5.1.21 Upon termination of the Contract, the Contractor shall deliver to

facilities, and equipment that were required for the purpose of the Contract
in accordance with article 29 of the Law on Hydrocarbons.”

“18.6 Upon termination of this Contract at the end of the Exploitation

production conditions, the wells that are active at such time as well as, in
good condition except for normal wear and tear, all other equipment, tools,
machinery, facilities, and other movable and immovable property acquired
for the purposes of this Contract.”

It is also necessary to refer to Article 29 of the Hydrocarbon Law noted above which states:

“[U]pon termination of an exploration and exploitation contract, due to
expiration of its term or for any other reason arising during the exploitation
period, the contractor or associate must turn over to PETROECUADOR,
at no cost and in a good state of production, the oil wells that are in activity
at the time; as well as, in good condition, all equipment, tools, machinery,
installations, and other real or personal property that were acquired to fulfil
the contract’s purposes [...].” !!?!

With regard to the obligation to comply with the generally accepted international petroleum
industry’s practices, it is important to note that Article 10 of RAOHE provides that the

contractor “shall apply, at least” the API standard “and any other rule or standard of the

petroleum industry.” !!22

“Norms and Standards:

In hydrocarbon operations, PETROECUADOR and contractor shall
apply, at least, the practices recommended by the American Petroleum
Institute “API” particularly the following: “Exploration and Production
standards” and “Manual of Petroleum Measurement standards” and any
other rule or standard of the petroleum industry.”

Furthermore, RAOHE does provide for specific standards in relation to infrastructure and

contains several references to the API standards. It is not disputed between the Parties that

the API standards combine preventative as well as predictive maintenance techniques. !!”°

As the Burlington tribunal noted, and as has occurred in the present case, both Parties
challenge the credibility or relevance of each other’s witnesses and experts. The Tribunal
bears in mind that the witnesses gave evidence relating to matters occurring some years
previously and in those circumstances, just like the Burlington tribunal,!'™ the Tribunal
places more reliance on contemporary documents which may assist regarding the

determination of the state of the infrastructure as of the date of takeover.

An important part of Perenco’s defence to the infrastructure counterclaim was its reliance
on two contemporaneous reports prepared by SGS in 2009 and 2010 (“SGS Reports”).!!75
Both of these reports assess the condition of the infrastructure, which included the
equipment facilities and other assets of both Blocks 7 and 21 according to five categories
ranging from very good to very bad. These reports concluded that the significant majority
of the infrastructure is considered to be in good or very good condition. This report seems
to tie up with Ecuador’s claim for compensation in Burlington with respect to only 3 tanks

(out of 89) and 3 pumps (out of 16).!!¢

It is true that Ecuador invites the Tribunal to place little reliance on the SGS Reports on the
grounds that they are no more than inventories of assets.!!?” The Tribunal disagrees as it
places considerable reliance on the SGS Reports, especially where other evidence is

lacking.

See e.g. Burlington Decision on Counterclaims, paragraphs 933-936.
CE-CC-217; CE-CC-240.

Ecuador withdrew its claim for the purchase of 5 power oil pumps as those had not been acquired yet, see
Ecuador’s Reply on Counterclaims, para 519.

See CE-CC-348 (total number of tanks). Regarding Ecuador’s claim with respect to tanks in the present case,
see Montenegro WSI, para 23, bullet point 6: only tank repaired was the Payamino T-102 tank; Ecuador’s
Reply on Counterclaims, paras 521, 529: T-104 tank of Gacela CPF has been repaired, and emergency repairs
carried out Payamino T-102 tank and the Yuralpa T-400 tank.

The Tribunal notes that Ecuador in its Resp. PHB CC, paragraph | 12 seeks to explain that it is complaining
that “at least 12 tanks were returned in poor condition ..., not 3 as wrongly alleged by Perenco.”
Regarding its claim with respect to pumps, see CE-CC-217, Amortizables B7 and Amortizables B21 (total
number of pumps). Ecuador’s claim is for (i) a new transfer and horizontal multistage pumps in the Oso and
Gacela fields (Montenegro WSII, Annex 3, p. 4); (ii) repairs to two power oil pumps in the Coca field (Luna
WS III, para 153; Luna WS III, Annexes 77-78; Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraph 519).

1128

1129

Another important point to bear in mind as mentioned earlier, is that Petroamazonas
expanded its operations and increased drilling and production on both Blocks from at least
January 2010 onwards.'!?* As the Burlington tribunal remarked, and with which this
Tribunal agrees, “this expansion and increase in production would entail a need to improve
the existing infrastructure.”''?? Ecuador has submitted before both tribunals that none of
the amounts it is claiming is associated with the expansion of production in the Blocks.
However, one thing is clear and that is that evidence of Petroamazonas’ expansion activities
do make it difficult to establish the facts as they were when the Consortium left the Blocks.

The Tribunal needs to keep this in mind throughout.

At the end of the hearing on the counterclaims and after closing submissions thereon, the
Tribunal, after careful deliberation, formed the view that Ecuador’s claims in relation to
the infrastructure counterclaim were excessive in value. The Tribunal formed the view that
there were some breaches of the obligations, which sounded in damages, but in the light of
all the evidence presented, the Tribunal was of the view that the damages were in the region

of approximately US$2 million.

The Tribunal has read the Burlington award and finds itself in general agreement with the
items of breach found by that tribunal regarding the infrastructure counterclaim. The
Burlington tribunal considered the various items of that counterclaim in great detail and as
their conclusions to a great extent accord with this Tribunal’s view of the matter, no useful
purpose can be served by a detailed recitation of evidence (virtually identical in both cases)
and of the arguments relating to each head of claim. However, the Tribunal will set out

briefly its reasoning and conclusions with regard to the disputed items.

See Perenco’s Counter-Memorial on Counterclaims, e.g. paragraphs 31, 376, 512 describing costs being
claimed that are allegedly associated with Ecuador/Petroamazonas’ expansion of the Blocks c.f; Ecuador’s
Reply on Counterclaims, Section 4.4.3, denying that it has included the costs associated with Petroamazonas’
expansion of Block 7 but not denying that there are current plans for expansion in Block 7.

Tanks

Ecuador contends that the Consortium’s practices of purchasing storage tanks which were
substandard and of recycled parts of old tanks from several fields to build “new” tanks was
not in line with international standards and requirements.''*° Like the Burlington tribunal,
this Tribunal is not satisfied that Ecuador has substantiated that the Consortium failed to

construct or maintain tanks in accordance with industry standards and practices.

This Tribunal too relies upon the evidence of Dr. Egan that all the tanks were manufactured
in accordance with API 650.'!! There is evidence that the tanks were regularly inspected

1132

and records kept,” that there was monitoring of corrosion of the tanks according to API

653, that there was an effective cathodic protection programme in place, !!*3

that plans had
been devised to repair the large tanks in the blocks and that the Consortium kept Ecuador
apprised of tank repairs.''*+ This Tribunal also agrees that the fact that Ecuador limits its
comments to a small percentage of the tanks and claims damages with respect to only 12
of them, is some indication that the Consortium’s maintenance plan was, on the whole,

adequate.

The Tribunal also notes Dr. Egan’s point that inspections were carried out by
Petroamazonas between one and three years after the takeover of the Blocks and that the
type of corrosion identified by Petroamazonas was one that could occur quite quickly.!!?°
This conclusion leads to some doubt as to whether the corrosion found was in fact due to
insufficient maintenance by the Consortium and the Tribunal bears in mind that the burden
of proof is on Ecuador. The Tribunal cannot be satisfied that the damage to the tanks, the
subject of complaint, was caused by the Consortium’s operations. It seems to the Tribunal

more likely than not, that the tanks’ condition deteriorated since Petroamazonas took

control of the Blocks and this negates any liability on the part of the consortium.
Accordingly, the Tribunal too is satisfied that Ecuador has not established that the
Consortium breached its obligations to construct and maintain tanks according to industry

standards.

Further, in addition to constructing and maintaining the tanks Ecuador alleges that the
Consortium returned certain tanks in a condition that is not consistent with normal wear
and tear.''*° In its Post-Hearing Brief, Ecuador states that it seeks damages in relation to

“at least 12 tanks [that were] returned in poor condition not 3 as wrongly alleged by

 

Perenco.”!!*7 The Tribunal has reviewed the record and while, as noted above, Ecuador did
comment on the alleged poor condition of 12 tanks, it has only provided details about the
repairs works and costs for three specific tanks and so the Tribunal will briefly consider

these three.

1. Gacela T-104 Tank

The documents provided show that this tank was inspected in 2010, 2011 and 2012.'!°8 An
inspection in December 2010 discovered some problems with the roof and found a high
level of oxidation.'!*° The 2011 inspection showed that the corrosive processes had
worsened and it was concluded that a “complete replacement’ of the roof was

“required.” !\4°

When it had been inspected in December 2008 and again in April 2009, just months before
the Consortium suspended operations, the roof was still in sufficiently good condition.!'4!
Dr. Egan asserts that Ecuador failed to explain how the issues at the time of the inspections
conducted between December 2010 and February 2012 were attributable to the

Consortium. The issues complained of were only documented as “new situations” one and

a half years later, in December 2010.!!*? Dr. Egan also argued that it was entirely possible
that the minimal corrosion identified in April 2009 rapidly progressed and became visible
in December 2010; in fact, the December 2010 inspection indicated that the hole in the roof

was “new.” 1143

Dr. Egan extrapolated from this that it was also in good condition in July 2009.!!44

Contrary to the Burlington tribunal’s finding, this Tribunal was persuaded by Dr. Egan’s
analysis given the close timing of the April 2009 inspection. While there may have been
some incipient corrosion, the bulk of it appears to have occurred after the Consortium left
the Block. The Tribunal believes that it is far more likely than not that the cause of the

corrosion found cannot be attributable to the Consortium’s operations.

The Tribunal can see no reason why Ecuador should be reimbursed for the costs that it

claims.

2. Payamino T-102 Tank

Ecuador contends that inspections of this tank took place between 2010 and 2011 and to
establish this it has provided a contract signed between Petroamazonas and Conduto to
perform the repairs on tank T102 — mainly involving cleaning and painting the tank, both
internally and externally.!!4> What is significant is that this document does not contain any

description of the state of the tank at that time.

There is, however, documentary evidence prior to July 2009 which is contained in a
document prepared by the Consortium in April 2008 in which it set out the basis for the
bidding process to repair the Coca and Payamino tanks.!'#° This document establishes that

in March 2008 this tank required further inspection and repair, but was not in a critical

condition at that time. The document stated that this tank should be cleaned and painted.!!47
The Consortium did develop a project plan with a proposed start date in October 2009 with
the duration of some two months to conduct the necessary repairs, but by that time the

Consortium was no longer operating the Blocks. !!48

However, the point remains that had the Consortium continued to operate the Blocks they
would have incurred the expense for which it had planned and in those circumstances the
Tribunal can see no reason why Perenco should not bear the cost of these repairs which it

would have borne if events had taken a different course.

Ecuador has claimed US$322,960.42, which it has clarified to be on account of the
emergency repairs carried out on several fluid lines and pipelines, the Payamino T-102
tank, the Yuralpa T-400 tank, the Jaguar and Yuralpa camps, etc.''*? The Tribunal agrees
with the Burlington tribunal that Ecuador has not fully justified the claims for other repairs
and improvements which are set out in Annex 3 to Mr. Montenegro’s 2" Witness
Statement. The Tribunal further agrees with the Burlington tribunal that the amount
recoverable under this head of claim should be reduced to US$210,130.76 which is the sum

referable for the repairs made to this tank and pipelines.!!°°

3. Yuralpa T-400 Tank

In July 2009, the SGS Report described the condition of this tank as good or very good.!!°!

In relation to this tank, two inspections were carried out in March 2011. The first inspection
suggested substantial repairs to the interior of the tank and identified certain problems

which did not pose an immediate risk to the mechanical construction and integrity of the

Solfs WS2, Annex 34, pp. 15-17 in the English translation.
Intertek ER II, paragraph 93, referring to CE-CC-343.
Ecuador's Reply on Counterclaims, paragraph 529.

 

The Tribunal notes that the Burlington tribunal subtracted all items that manifestly do not relate to repair:
done to Payamino Tank T-102 or pipelines, such as, inter alia, improvements done to the Jaguar camp’s
dining room and kitchen, or replacement of floors in the Yuralpa offices. (see fn. 1982 of Counterclaims
Decision). The Tribunal agrees with this approach.

tank.!!>? The second report found that there was no evidence of any problems that might
put the mechanical construction and integrity at risk.''*? It is also fair to point out that all
references to this tank in the SGS Reports indicate that the tanks were in good or very good

condition. !!4

However, the biggest problem is that the first inspection which identified a defective
condition of this tank dates from March 2011 which is some two years after the Consortium
had ceased operations. Bearing in mind that the SGS Report in June 2009 describes the
condition of the components of this tank in favourable terms, the Tribunal considers that
Ecuador has failed to establish that any damage to this equipment and costs incurred
relating to the condition of this equipment were caused by the Consortium. Consequently,

this claim is dismissed.

Claims relating to fluid lines and pipelines

The Burlington tribunal addressed this matter in great detail between paragraphs 965 and
1006 of its Decision on Counterclaims. This Tribunal has considered these paragraphs
carefully and has considered all the documents referred to therein, which were also
submitted in this proceeding. This Tribunal agrees with the discussion and analysis
conducted by the Burlington tribunal and can see no useful purpose in setting out this

somewhat technical matter all over again.

The claim under this head is US$1,667,655.83. This is based on Mr. Luna’s evidence, but
the Tribunal notes, as did the Burlington tribunal, that in his last witness statement he
assessed this claim at US$1,462,553.43 broken down in five component parts set out in
paragraph 1005 of the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims.!'!** Bearing in mind that
Ecuador is not seeking the replacement of the pipeline system, but has limited its claims to

the cost of two inspections and urgent and necessary repairs as set out in the paragraph just

referred to, this Tribunal agrees that Ecuador should be compensated in the sum of

US$1,462,553.43.

Claims related to generator engines

This claim relates to various power generator engines in Blocks 7 and 21 which, it is
alleged, were in a very bad state when the Consortium abandoned the blocks. Ecuador’s
claim focuses on Wartsila engines 2, 3 and 4 in Block 21 and on all 27 Caterpillar engines
in Block 7. Ecuador’s allegation is that the Consortium failed to conduct proper overhauls
of these machines and further that it used harmful crude-diesel fuel mix in the Block 7
engines which caused damage to them. The claim here is based on the costs of overhauls,
reduced engine life and the purchase of a new alternator for Wartsila engine 4. The total
cost claimed hereunder is US$6,540,010.57 of which US$4,744,733.75 relates to Block 21
and US$1,795,276.18 relates to Block 7.

As to the claim in relation to overhauls it is not in dispute that engines require preventative
maintenance which includes monitoring, testing and overhauls. However, having
considered the evidence and in particular Mr. Luna’s witness statements and Dr. Egan’s
expert report as well as the Consortium’s maintenance records, this Tribunal agrees with
the Burlington tribunal’s reasoning - as set out between paragraphs 1021 and 1026 of the
Burlington Decision on Counterclaims-, that Ecuador has failed to provide sufficient
evidence of any alleged failure to perform timely overhauls to its generator engines or to
prove that such failure increased the maintenance costs or reduced the useful life of the

engines. Consequently, this claim is denied.

Ecuador also contends that damage was caused by the use of a crude-diesel fuel blend. This
apparently was a cheaper diesel crude mix and Ecuador submits that the effect of this mix
was disastrous on the engines. There is no dispute that the Consortium did use a crude-

diesel fuel blend in Block 7, but Perenco contends that this was not an unreasonable choice

353

948.

949.

950.

951.

1156

1157

1158

1159

and it was one which had government approval and, in any event, had no lasting impact on

the engines. !!°6

It is not contested that the Consortium decided to stop using this blend after approximately
seven months. Mr. d’Argentré claimed that this was due to cost issues, but the Tribunal is
not satisfied that cost was the sole reason and is entitled to infer that this was due, at least

in part, because the blend was not properly working.

It is true that the Ministry of Mines and Petroleum knew of the practice of using this blend
and that there was no opposition to it.!!*7 Nevertheless, the Tribunal considers that the
responsibility for the good condition of the equipment still lay with the Consortium. The
documents provided to the Tribunal show that the use of the blend could lead to higher
maintenance costs and affect engine life. Further, as has been stated, the Consortium itself

discontinued the use of this blend.

For the above reasons and for those also stated in the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims
on this issue, the Tribunal is satisfied that the use of the blend did affect the condition of

the engines.

Ecuador claims a total of US$1,795,276.80 in connection with engines in Block 7 with
US$1,123,800!!>8 for the reduction in the engines’ useful life, which Ecuador estimates to
be a reduction of 30% in useful life, '!5° due to a lack of regular maintenance and the use of
the crude diesel blend. However, as this Tribunal has already rejected Ecuador’s contention
that the Consortium’s alleged lack of regular maintenance reduced engine life and as
Ecuador has not satisfactorily established what proportion of the reduction in useful life
can be attributed to the use of the blend, the Tribunal is left in somewhat of a quandary.
The Burlington tribunal, in the exercise of its discretionary powers in matters of quantifying

damages, thought it appropriate to grant Ecuador half of the amount claimed for reduction

of the useful life of Block 7 engines and thus granted a sum of US$561,900.''® This
Tribunal is not bound to exercise its discretion in exactly the same way but considers it to

be a reasonable sum and will grant US$561,900 under this head of claim.

Claims related to pumps, electrical systems, IT equipment, and road maintenance
1. Pumps

Ecuador alleges that the Consortium operated with too few pumps, and that those that were
used were obsolete, did no preventative or predicted maintenance, had no or not sufficient
back-up systems and lacked the necessary stock of spare parts.''®! It alleges that when
Petroamazonas took over the Blocks it had to purchase new pumps to replace the ones
currently in place. However, there is no evidence that it ever replaced the pumps and at that
time it had performed overhaul on pumps 2 and 4 of Coco CPF which it claimed costs of

US$33,662.45. 1162

This claim is unsustainable because for some time after taking over the Blocks Ecuador
was still operating the pumps that it now claims are obsolete but for two pumps in Coca
CPF. In relation to these two pumps Ecuador did perform overhauls at the cost set out
above which is claimed here. As the Burlington tribunal remarked, the fact that 158 of 160
pumps were present in the Blocks when control passed to Petroamazonas in July 2009 and
had not been overhauled or replaced after the takeover led that tribunal to infer that these
pumps were not in the dire condition that Ecuador alleges. '!®? Having considered the matter

afresh, this Tribunal agrees with the Burlington tribunal.

As for the two pumps which were overhauled, the report upon which Ecuador relies is dated
September 2012, which was three years after Petroamazonas took over.!!™ This is of no

assistance to the Tribunal in assessing the state of the pumps in July 2009.

This claim is dismissed.

2. Electrical systems

Similarly as the Burlington tribunal, '!!®

the Tribunal dismisses the claim on the grounds of
absence of proof that the expenses related to the purchase of the new variators were caused
by the Consortium’s improper maintenance or by bad condition beyond normal wear of the

electrical system of the Blocks in July 2009.

3. IT equipment and software

The claim under this head is that the Consortium did not have proper maintenance software
in accordance with industry standards. Accordingly, when Petroamazonas took over, it
incurred costs in order to upgrade the technology used in its offices and implemented
“Maximo” which was a new computerised maintenance management system (CMMS).

Mr. Luna quantified this claim at US$151,601.96 which included the purchase of

1166

computers, cameras and the cost of hiring personnel to implement the system. Tf one

excludes the purchase of computers, Ecuador quantifies this claim at US $81,384.96.!!97

This claim for US$151,601.96 is not sustainable. The Consortium had another management

software in place, the SAP system, which was characterized by Dr. Egan as an

21168

“internationally recognized management system which is “comprehensive”!!® and

complying with industry standards.

1172

Ecuador does not dispute this, but contends that the Consortium did not give nor offer
access to the SAP maintenance data when it left the Blocks and thus Petroamazonas had to
purchase the Maximo system from scratch.'!”° While the Burlington tribunal placed
reliance on a letter written by the Consortium to Petroamazonas on 23 July 2009 to
“propose a technical meeting to ensure an orderly post-takeover transition’, the letter was
in fact referring to the transition of employees and contractors and not specifically the

system. In all the circumstances, the Tribunal awards the sum of US$81,384.96.

Road maintenance and vehicles

Ecuador seeks to recover the amounts which it spent on the purchase of new vehicles (
US$98,107.16) and road maintenance (US$381,127.64).!'7! The Tribunal notes that
Ecuador has not put forward any documentary evidence showing the need to repair or
replace specific vehicles. However, it notes that the SGS Reports do identify two vehicles,

both Toyota Land Cruisers, that were either in “very bad” or “good” but damaged
condition.!!7? The Burlington tribunal took the view that as Ecuador was claiming the cost
of purchasing four similar vehicles for US$98,187.16, that tribunal should grant Ecuador
half this claim, namely US$49,093.58. In this Tribunal’s opinion, the fact that Ecuador has
not put forward any documentary evidence supporting the need to repair or replace specific
vehicles is sufficient for this claim to be dismissed. Accordingly, this Tribunal will not

follow the Burlington tribunal which granted half the claim, namely, US$49,093.58.

The claim in respect of roads and road maintenance is dismissed for lack of proof that these

expenses were caused by the Consortium’s negligence.

Luna WS III, paragraph 45, responding to Mr. d’ Argentré’s WS III, paragraph 36: “Ecuador omits the fact
that the Consortium was willing to transfer all of its maintenance records in an orderly fashion.”

Other claims

Ecuador also seeks compensation for other repairs and the upgrade of facilities, the
purchase of back-up equipment, spare parts and materials to bring the Blocks’ operation
into line with industry standards. These works include the reconditioning of wells, the

refurbishment of camps and a new communication tower in Gacela CPF.!!73

The Tribunal finds these claims have not been sufficiently particularised or proven by
Ecuador. The Tribunal is satisfied that the infrastructure of the Blocks was generally in
proper condition and that Ecuador’s expansion plan and increases in production were likely
to require improvements to existing equipment and facilities in any event. Accordingly,

these additional claims are rejected.

Conclusion on the Damages Regarding the Infrastructure Counterclaim

For the reasons set out above, the Tribunal concludes that it will grant a total of

US$2,315,969.15 in respect of Ecuador’s infrastructure counterclaims itemised as follows:
(a) US$210,130.76 for the Payamino T-102 tank;

(b) US$1,462,553.43 for repairs related to pipelines and fluid lines;

c) US$ 561,900 for generator engines; and
(d) US$81,384.96 for IT equipment and software.

The Tribunal now turns to the issue of double recovery. There is no dispute between the

Parties that Ecuador can only recover this sum or receive the benefit of it once.!!4

As Burlington and Ecuador have settled their differences by the payment in full of the
Burlington award which included US$2,577,119 for Ecuador’s infrastructure counterclaim
(in other words, a deduction was made from Burlington’s damages) it cannot be right for

this Tribunal to award the same or part of the same sum twice. Therefore, consistent with

See e.g. Montenegro WS III, paragraph 7; see also E-211.
See paragraph 907 above. Further, see generally Perenco’s First and Second Dismissal Applications.

358

967.

968.

the agreement of Ecuador not to seek double recovery, this Tribunal concludes that because
the Burlington infrastructure damages are higher than the sum awarded by this Tribunal,
Ecuador has been made whole on the infrastructure counterclaim, and this sum shall not be

included as part of Ecuador’s counterclaim damages.

971.

The starting point of any consideration for costs is Article 61(2) of the ICSID Convention

which empowers the Tribunal to “except as the parties otherwise agree, assess the expenses

incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and decide how and by whom

those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal and the charges for

the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid.” The Tribunal has had to consider not

only Perenco’s Treaty claims but also claims of both Parties under the Participation

Contracts, Ecuador’s claims being in the form of counterclaims.

The Participation Contracts provide that each Party shall incur the fees of the Arbitrator
which they appointed, share half of the fees of the Presiding Arbitrator, and pay all the

expenses incurred in the arbitration as determined by the Tribunal.

In its submissions, Perenco states that: “The Blocks 7 and 21 Participation Contracts
provide a method of allocating costs that, with some exceptions, is generally consistent
with the default rule under the ICSID Convention by giving the Tribunal discretion of
allocating costs, except for arbitrator fees and costs of ICSID facilities.”!!7* It however
states that “[t]he contract claims . . . added few incremental costs to the Treaty claim” and
that “[i]t is therefore not sensible to allocate the arbitrators’ fees ... according to the
Participation Contracts.”!'”? Ecuador agrees.''®? In light of the Parties’ agreement, the
Tribunal will not apply the Participation Contracts’ approach to the allocation of

arbitrators’ fees.

The Tribunal considers that tribunals usually take into account three factors in determining

issues of costs.

i. First, the parties’ success on their respective claims or counterclaims;
ii. Second, their procedural conduct throughout the arbitration; and
iii. Third, the reasonableness of the costs actually claimed by them.

It is well established that arbitrators in ICSID cases have a wide discretion and there is no

rebuttable assumption as there is in other rules that costs should follow the event.

There are a number of features in this case which, it is argued by one Party or the other,
have had an impact on the costs of these proceedings and which the Tribunal should take

into account. The Tribunal will consider each in turn and give its decision as to whether

each has any merit and if so, whether it has a bearing on the award of the costs of these

proceedings.

Ecuador declined to abide by the Tribunal’s Decision on Provisional Measures

Perenco submits that Ecuador’s decision not to abide by the Tribunal’s Decision on
Provisional Measures, dated 8 May 2009, vastly altered the face of this arbitration and

added to its complexity, length and expense.!!*!

In paragraph 695 of its Decision on Liability, the Tribunal noted that:

“The Tribunal recommended what it considered to be a reasonable way to

protect both Parties’ rights pending a final determination of their dispute.

Regrettably, this was not possible in the circumstances. Perenco is correct

to point out that had the State stayed its hand in relation to the coactivas,

the dispute would not have been aggravated in the way in which it

was,7!182
Now that the case is at its end, the Tribunal, having reviewed the history of this dispute in
the course of the final deliberations conducted in relation to the making of this Award, can
go further. At the time when, despite the provisional measures, the Respondent threatened
to proceed with the coactivas, the Tribunal made clear to Ecuador that the Tribunal “must

necessarily take a serious view of any failure to comply”''®>

with its provisional measures
determination. The Tribunal had given careful consideration to a means that would allow
the Parties to continue with the arbitration without threatening the underpinnings of their
contractual relationship and aggravating their dispute. The escrow account, which Perenco
proposed and the Tribunal considered could reasonably do the job of protecting the
Respondent’s fiscal interests, would have had all contested Law 42 dues paid into an

account and made payable to Ecuador if it prevailed on the merits. Regrettably, Ecuador

1184

did not see fit to agree the escrow arrangement and instead commenced the coactivas.!!*

This led to a series of events culminating in the total breakdown in the Parties’ relationship.

Irrespective of Ecuador’s reasons for not complying with the Tribunal’s Decision on
Provisional Measures, the fact of the matter is that its refusal changed the nature of this
arbitration to the detriment of Perenco. Had Ecuador complied, this arbitration would likely

have been quite different;

(a) Perenco would likely still be operating both Blocks;

(b) With no coactivas, there likely would have been no suspension of

operations, and hence no declaration of caducidad;

(c) The right to operate Block 7 would likely have been extended in a new

contractual form on mutually acceptable terms;
(d) The Law 42 damages claim would have been relatively straightforward;
(e) The accounting evidence would have been far more straightforward;

(f) Both the liability and quantum phases would have been shorter and less
expensive;

(g) There might well not have been a counterclaim as the post-termination
provisions of the Participation Contracts would not have been engaged; as the
continuing operator, Perenco would have had a commercial incentive to re-invest
in infrastructure maintenance and environmental protection; had it not done so,
Ecuador had sufficient contractual and statutory remedies to enforce the same;

(h) This arbitration would not have lasted 11 years;

(i) There would have been no need for over 50 submissions and seven hearings;

and

(0) The total cost to both Parties would have been greatly reduced.

1185

1186

In the light of all of the above, the Tribunal considers that it is appropriate to take into
account Ecuador’s conduct in this arbitration when considering the overall issue of who

should pay how much to whom.

Ecuador’s objections to jurisdiction
1. The joining of Petroecuador to the proceedings

Perenco instituted these proceedings not only against Ecuador but also against
Petroecuador. However, the Tribunal found that it had no competence over
Petroecuador.!!'®> Petroecuador claims as the reimbursement of the costs of its legal
representation and expenses incurred US$49,629.76 in respect of this arbitration, with
simple interest at a commercially reasonable rate from the date they were incurred until

payment.!!86

This sum is reasonable to the Tribunal and it will accordingly order Perenco to pay
Petroecuador US$49,629.76, together with simple interest at an annual rate of 3% which
shall accrue from 30 June 2011 (the date of dispatch of the Tribunal’s Decision on

Jurisdiction), until the date of full and final payment.

2. Objections to jurisdiction

Ecuador also raised objections to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to hear the claims. The
Tribunal found it necessary to deal with the jurisdictional issues in two steps (issuing the
Decision on Jurisdiction and then, after further evidence and submissions, the Decision on
Liability). The Tribunal does not consider the objections to be frivolous and Ecuador’s
interest in having the Tribunal determine whether the principal claim could proceed was
fully understandable. Nevertheless, ultimately Perenco prevailed on almost all
jurisdictional issues except for the one relating to Petroecuador and the one relating to the
claim regarding the declaration of caducidad in respect of Block 7 Contract. This will be

taken into account in the award of costs.

Perenco received less than claimed

Ecuador suggests that the Tribunal can take into account the fact that Perenco’s claim was
“grossly inflated.” ''*’ It is true that Perenco claimed US$1.423 billion (as of 18 April 2016,
following some downward adjustments from US$1.698 billion) and ultimately was
awarded US$448,820,400. The Tribunal notes that it is not uncommon for an award to be
for a sum less than that claimed. The issue for the Tribunal is whether Perenco’s claim was

unreasonably inflated.

The principal reason for the lower award of damages is that the Tribunal could not agree
with Perenco’s contention that the damages should be calculated on the basis that that the
Block 7 Participation Contract would have been extended. The decision to award damages
only for the loss of opportunity of that possible extension led to a significant reduction in

the amount payable to Perenco.

As for the calculation of the damages prior to the declaration of caducidad, in the end, the
Tribunal took a different approach from that suggested by Professor Kalt, but it did not
conclude that his approach and analysis were frivolous. The Tribunal decided to adopt the
‘layering’ approach which led to a lesser sum. Professor Kalt’s views were not absurd nor
fanciful. The Tribunal simply decided that a different approach led to a more appropriate

but still substantial figure for damages.

For its part, Ecuador’s quantum experts were instructed to base their assessment of
damages on certain assumptions (not accepted by the Tribunal) that, with certain notable
exceptions (such as the ‘layering’ approach to valuing damages resulting from different
breaches occurring at different times, the ‘true-up’ and the Waterfall Chart), prevented their
written reports prepared during the quantum phase of the proceeding from truly assisting
the Tribunal. Based on these instructions, Professor Dow and his team came up with the
surprising result that Perenco suffered no loss and in fact was indebted to Ecuador. No
disrespect is intended to Brattle by the making of this observation. The problem was that

during the initial part of the quantum phase, Brattle acted on instructions which did not

1189

comport with the essential facts as found by the Tribunal, with predictable results in terms
of the persuasiveness of their initial estimates of damages. In the end though, the Tribunal’s

view is that both Parties’ experts provided helpful assistance to it.

Ecuador submitted a motion for reconsideration of the Tribunal’s Decision on Liability
which was dismissed by the Tribunal!!* and Ecuador should bear Perenco’s costs relating
thereto. Perenco has not specified them separately but they have been included as part of
the “Costs on Liability and Motion for Reconsideration.” They are included in the sum

awarded by the Tribunal to Perenco for its costs relating to the principal claim.

In view of the above, the Tribunal believes that Perenco is entitled to reimbursement of its
costs in successfully pursuing its claims against Ecuador. However, the Tribunal is of the
view that the reimbursement should be reduced to a reasonable level of these costs, taking
into account in particular that not all expert evidence assisted the Tribunal in reaching its
decision. Therefore, out of total costs of US$29,407,653 that Perenco incurred in relation
to its “Principal Claims”, the Tribunal decides that Ecuador shall reimburse Perenco

US$23 million.

Ecuador’s counterclaims against Burlington and Perenco

Burlington and Perenco were the joint and several contractors for both Blocks 7 and 21.
They were referred to as “the Consortium” and Perenco managed the Blocks on behalf of

the Consortium.

Both Burlington and Perenco commenced treaty claims against Ecuador (under different
treaties) and contract claims under the same Participation Contracts. Burlington’s Request
for Arbitration was dated 21 April 2008 and Perenco’s was dated 30 April 2008.

Burlington, however, withdrew its contract claims on 6 November 2009. 1189

In each of the arbitrations, Ecuador filed counterclaims seeking substantial compensation
for environmental damage to parts of the Amazon rainforest affected by the works of, in
effect, Perenco, as well as damages for the alleged failure to return the Blocks’
infrastructure in reasonable condition as required by the Participation Contracts. Ecuador
raised its counterclaims against Burlington on 17 January 2011 and then on 5 December

2011 raised the same counterclaims against Perenco.

The counterclaims raise three issues: (i) the question of duplication of proceedings; (ii) the
initial estimation of the extent of the environmental damage; and (iii) the proportionality

of what has actually been awarded to that which was initially claimed.

1. Duplication of proceedings

On 24 June 2011, counsel for Perenco wrote to the Respondent’s counsel suggesting that
considerable sums could be saved by Ecuador if it maintained counterclaims just in the

Burlington proceedings, and went on to suggest ways in which this could be achieved.

On 29 June 2011, the Respondent rejected this suggestion, relying on the fact that both
Burlington and Perenco had thought fit to institute their own proceedings and thus two
counterclaims was the consequence. Perenco accepted this position; it did not see fit to

1190

oppose the Perenco counterclaim on admissibility or jurisdictional grounds and for

some six years the Burlington and Perenco counterclaims proceeded along separate paths.

The issue thus arises whether Ecuador has unreasonably complicated these proceedings
and thereby exacerbated the costs and delay by claiming the same damage from both
Burlington and Perenco in two distinct arbitration proceedings. The counterclaim brought
by Ecuador could have been maintained against Burlington alone or against Perenco alone.
If the former, Perenco would be liable to compensate Burlington for 50% of any damages
so proved as a joint and several co-contractor. If the latter, Burlington would be liable to

compensate Perenco for 50% of any damages so proved as a joint and several co-contractor.

That is, at least up to two applications, dated 18 April 2017 and 30 January 2018, respectively, to dismiss the
counterclaim on grounds of res judicata.

1193

Has Ecuador attempted to have two bites of the same cherry?

The costs of the Burlington counterclaim hearing were substantial and led to an award in
Ecuador’s favour in the sum of almost US$42 million against a stated claim of
US$2,797,007,091.42.!!9! The same claims were made against Perenco and, as will be seen
above, has led to an Award in favour of Ecuador in the sum of US$93,683,890 from which
the amount of US$39,199,373 awarded in the Burlington Decision on Counterclaims and

paid by Burlington, has to be deducted, so as to avoid double recovery.!!°?

Accordingly, the Tribunal needs to decide whether the counterclaims against Perenco has

added to the costs because it could have only been dealt with in the Burlington proceedings.

There is no doubt that the launching of two counterclaims based on the same subject-matter
was calculated to increase Ecuador’s overall chances of success. But as the Tribunal
observed earlier, parallel investment treaty arbitral proceedings brought by claimants
(sometimes in tandem with commercial claims concerning the same facts) have been found

not to be abusive even if there might be an element seeking two bites of the same cherry.!!9

Indeed, to the extent that the counterclaims issues were the same in the two proceedings,
the real question is why Ecuador would counterclaim against Burlington at all, given that
Perenco was the operator, the party with first-hand knowledge of the operations, and
therefore the actual (as opposed to the nominal) author of some of the contamination that

the Tribunal’s Independent Expert has found in the oilfields.

If Ecuador had acted with a view to seeking relief in the most efficient way, Burlington
would have been spared the costs of defending itself against the claims made against the
actions of the Consortium’s operator. But that ultimately plays no role in the assessment of

costs in this proceeding. For the reasons just stated, Ecuador logically should have

Burlington award, in particular the Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 52(iii), which is an integral part of
the Burlington award.

The remaining sum awarded by the Burlington tribunal has been treated as negativing any further award of
damages for the infrastructure counterclaim.

The CME and Lauder cases being a leading example.

1194

proceeded against Perenco, not Burlington, and any costs thrown away in the Burlington

arbitration are not relevant to assigning responsibility for costs in the present proceeding.

The Tribunal has already held, by a majority, that under Ecuadorian and international law,
Ecuador had a right to make counterclaims against both members of the Consortium and
in its view, the exercise of that right by Ecuador was not abusive. This view was evidently
shared by the Burlington tribunal, because it made no attempt to hold that its award on
damages in favour of Ecuador had the effect of putting all extant counterclaims to an end.
To the contrary, as already discussed, that tribunal left it to this Tribunal, as the later-in-

time tribunal, to sort out the issue of double recovery.

The Tribunal considers that launching the counterclaims in two proceedings was not
necessary because as shown above it would have been possible to have them pursued just
in one proceeding. But Ecuador stood on its rights, as it was entitled to do, and resisted

Perenco’s attempts to have the counterclaims consolidated.

The Tribunal concludes that the maintenance of two counterclaims was an attempt
(successful as it turned out) to have two bites at the cherry. It was an inefficient, costly and
time-consuming way of obtaining a decision. But Ecuador had the right to commence two

proceedings and no objection was taken by Perenco until it was far too late in the process.

2. The estimation of environmental damage

As has been seen, the counterclaims against Perenco had a lengthy history. At the end of
the hearing on the counterclaims, the Tribunal found that it was not prepared to accept the
findings of either side’s principal environmental experts and ordered an independent report
by the Tribunal’s Independent Expert, Mr. MacDonald, which led to an Award eventually
in favour of Ecuador. Based upon the evidence then before it, the Tribunal believed that

1194

there would be contamination for which Perenco would be held liable’*”*, and the amount

of damages awarded has turned out to be substantial.

1198

The Tribunal has not lost sight of the fact that Perenco initially argued that the
environmental counterclaims should be rejected “in its entirety and ... costs [awarded] in
its favour. . . [together with] such other and further relief as the Tribunal deemed just and

proper.”!!95

At the same time, also as anticipated by the Tribunal!!°°, the sum awarded by the Tribunal
is nowhere near what Ecuador originally claimed in the proceeding (quantified at
US$2,279,544,559 for soil clean-up costs, US$265,601,700 for groundwater remediation
costs and US$3,380,000 for further groundwater studies (subject to payment of compound

interest from the date of the Award until the date of full payment). !!°”

Given that Ecuador’s counterclaims were for a sum well in excess of US$2.5 billion,
Perenco had to take this very seriously indeed. The environmental counterclaim was
heralded by exaggerated allegations of an environmental catastrophe. It was based on
criteria that were divorced from the actual Ecuadorian legislative framework and using

inflated ex-country remedial costs.

At the same time, Perenco did itself no favours by seeking the dismissal of the counterclaim

“in its entirety” and acknowledging only in the most grudging manner a minor
environmental liability. While Ecuador’s experts could be accused of “gold-bricking” the
claim, Perenco’s experts could be accused of “lead-bricking” it, finding at every turn an

opportunity to ignore or reduce potential liability.

In short, neither side’s principal environmental expert gained the confidence of the
Tribunal.!!%8 For that reason, the Tribunal will direct that each side will bear the costs of

its own environmental experts.

1201

At the end of the first counterclaims hearing, while it was not able fully to rely on Ecuador’ s
evidence, the Tribunal considered that there was almost certainly some contamination for
which Perenco would be responsible. Moreover, certain evidence of Perenco’s own making
was a matter of concern to the Tribunal.!!% For this reason, the Tribunal encouraged the
Parties to settle the environmental counterclaim based on the findings of fact and law that
it had made in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, while holding out the prospect that
if they were unable to agree a settlement, an independent expert would be appointed. In the
end, Ecuador benefited from this decision by being able to rely upon the Independent

Expert’s subsequent findings. °°

Given that Ecuador ultimately prevailed on the environmental counterclaim, albeit with a
much smaller award of damages than originally sought, it will be awarded a portion of its
costs. The Award does not include Ecuador’s expert fees and costs as its environmental
expert reports did not assist the Tribunal in its task and it had to appoint the Independent

Expert.

3. Disproportionality between what was claimed and what was awarded

The Burlington tribunal awarded Ecuador the sum of US$41,776,492.77 in respect of its
counterclaims.'7°! This Tribunal has awarded US$93,683,890 for the environmental

counterclaim (and has held that the Burlington tribunal’s award of infrastructure damages

The May 2010 “Jungal Memorandum”: prepared by Perenco regarding the characterisation of the
environmental issues in Payamino 2-8, when Perenco and a landowner but not the Ecuadorian authorities,
had knowledge of the condition of a contaminated swampy area, and company officials debated what to do,
being the leading example. The Interim Decision on Counterclaim, at paragraph 438, recounted the options
set out in the memorandum:

  

438. The memorandum then set out “possible solutions” to the problem including, “conventional
remediation” of the location, “confine the problem and justify leaving the area as it is”, “dismiss the is
(which it was noted could lead to a lawsuit and “multimillion dollars compensation” as well as lead the State
to “force us to remedy the site under their conditions” in a situation where “the cost will reach amounts very
difficult to estimate now” and “the reputational cost to Perenco will also be very high”).

 

The memorandum added: “The State will probably assume that we are hiding many more [environmental]
damages and will scrutinize the operations area in search for more damages and it will probably find them.”

Quoted in the Interim Decision on Counterclaim, at paragraph 439.

Even then, Ecuador persisted in characterising the situation in the Blocks as an environmental catastrophe, a
characterisation which Perenco took exception to, and rightly so, in the Tribunal’s view.

See Burlington Decision on Counterclaims, paragraph 1099.B.

1202

has already fully compensated Ecuador). There is accordingly a substantial mismatch
between the amount claimed by Ecuador and the amount actually recovered. In the
Tribunal’s view, the counterclaims were overstated, in particular the environmental
counterclaim, which was based upon a number of incorrect assumptions. The Tribunal is
satisfied that the huge amount claimed by Ecuador in its counterclaims has added
substantially to the costs of these proceedings. As has been noted above, the counterclaims
would likely not have been raised had the Decision on Provisional Measures been honoured

by Ecuador.

d'? and there

Perenco’s two Applications for Dismissal of Ecuador’s Counterclaims faile
is no reason why Perenco should not bear the costs relating thereto. They have not been
specified by Ecuador separately but rather included in its costs relating to counterclaims.
They are part of the costs which Perenco has to reimburse Ecuador in connection with the

counterclaims.

In view of the above considerations relating to the counterclaims and taking into account
the outcome on the counterclaims reached, the Tribunal decides that Perenco shall
reimburse Ecuador for the latter’s costs incurred in relation to the counterclaims the amount

of US$6,276,153.

Comments on Ecuador’s costs submissions

Finally, the Tribunal was somewhat surprised by the nature, tone and content of Ecuador’s
submissions on costs. Their analysis of these proceedings is in the opinion of the Tribunal

not realistic.

To state that Ecuador is in effect the prevailing party in this arbitration is simply untenable.
Ecuador’s submission that it is in fact the successful party and indeed the injured party in
these proceedings is not accepted given the Tribunal’s previous findings on the overall

outcome of the proceeding.

See Decision on Perenco’s First Dismissal Application and this Award, paragraph 514, above.

Costs of the Proceeding

1020. The costs of these proceedings, which have been paid out of the advances made by the

Parties, are as follows:

(a) Arbitrators fees and expenses USS 2,720,449.19
(b) Environmental expert’s fees and expenses 1203 US$5,205,011.95
(c) ICSID’s administrative fees US$324,000.00

(d) Direct expenses (estimated) !?+ US$1,254,592.59
TOTAL: US$9,504,053.73

1021. The Tribunal, taking into account that Perenco prevailed on its principal claim, while

1203

1204

Ecuador was successful with its counterclaims, and in the exercise of its discretion, decides
that the costs of the proceedings, including those of the Tribunal’s Independent Expert,

shall be borne equally by the Parties.

This amount includes the estimated cost of US$10,000 for the removal of the investigation derived waste.
The final waste disposal costs will be calculated once all the waste is weighed and disposed of pursuant to
Ecuadorian law. The Tribunal has directed the Independent Expert to finalise arrangements with its local
subcontractor to urgently dispose of such waste.

 

ICSID will provide a detailed final statement of the case account to the Parties. The remaining balance will
be reimbursed to the Parties in proportion to the payments that they advanced to ICSID.

Notes

1. All costs in thousands of USD.

2. For these sites, allocated costs for soil and groundwater are provided and not included in Tables 2 and 3.
3. During the March 2019 hearing, Ecuador provided evidence indicating that Perenco had transferred to and disposed of mud pit materials from other sites at Payamino 16. Perenco did not dispute this. Considering that 85% of the Perenco mud pits did not conform to the performance criteria of
RAOHE, the Tribunal considers it more likely than not that the mud pits at this site would not have conformed to RAOHE considering that Perenco's site operations did not differ during its tenure. The estimated remedial cost and allocation of responsibilities for mud pits at Payamino 16 is set out

in Table 4.

4, Ecuador investigated groundwater at the Yuralpa Landfill, but the Independent Expert did not investigate groundwater at this site for logistical reasons. Considering that at least one well at every site has a detected exceedance of TPH and/or barium, it is reasonable to assume that groundwater
at Yuralpa LF would be similarly affected considering that Perenco's site operations did not differ during its tenure. The estimated remedial cost and allocation of responsibilities for groundwater at the Yuralpa Landfill is set out in Table 4.

5. Perenco installed wells at Yuralpa B and used the mud pits at the site. Due to an oversight, Ramboll did not investigate the Perenco mud pits at this site. Considering that 85% of the Perenco mud pits did not conform to the performance criteria of RAOHE the Tribunal considers it more likely
than not that the mud pits at this site would also not have conformed to RAOHE considering that Perenco's site operations did not differ during its tenure. The estimated remedial cost and allocation of responsibilities for mud pits at Yuralpa B are set out in Table 4.

2. Oryx installed a well and closed a mud pit at the site in 1993. Th evidence is that mud pit material was disposed in 5 of 6 mud pits at Payamino 16. Perenco did not dispute this at the March 2019 hearing. Inthe
absence of any data to indicate which RAOHE leachability criteria is not met (i.e., unlined or lined mud pits), a range of remedial costs was estimated. The estimated costs have been allocated 80% (Perenco) and
20% (non-Perenco)

3. During the March 2019 hearing, Ecuador noted that Perenco had installed wells at Yuralpa B and mud pit sampling should have been performed; Perenco did not dispute this. Perenco installed six of the seven
wells at this site. The mud pit area has been estimated from available aerial photographs and in the absence of any data to indicate which RAOHE leachability criteria is not met (i.e., unlined or lined mud pits), a
range of remedial costs was estimated. The allocation of this estimated cost has been based on the number of wells installed by Perenco (85%) versus non-Perenco (15%).

4. A range of remedial costs was estimated for mud pits. The low estimate considers that the mud pit does not conform to RAOHE's performance criteria for unlined pits, such that the remedy would consist of
excavation of the mud pit material, lining of the mud pit and placement of the untreated material in the lined mud pit. The high cost estimate considers that the mud pit does not conform to RAOHE's performance
criteria for lined pits, such that the remedy would consist of excavation of the mud pit material, treatment of the excavated materials, lining of the mud pit and placement of the treated material in the lined mud
pit.

5. The well location at Yuralpa LF sampled by IEMS is over 40m from the mud pit disposal area, where leachability testing indicated barium exceedances above the lined mud pit criteria. The high reasonable
prediction of groundwater contaminant migration from other sites indicates the potential for barium to migrate such distances.

6. Arange of costs was estimated for groundwater remediation based on the surface area of mud pits to be remediated. The low estimate is based on the order of magnitude estimate, while the high estimate
integrates the groundwater remedy (placement of reactive media for treatment of TPH impacted groundwater) with the remedy of the mud pits. The assumed affected groundwater at this site is fully

attributed to Perenco, who constructed and used the mud pits.
