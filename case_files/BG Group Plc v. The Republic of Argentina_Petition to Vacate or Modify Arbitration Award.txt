THE ARBITRATION - PROCEDURAL HISTORY

6. On April 25, 2003 BG served upon Argentina a Notice of Arbitration (Exhibit B).

7. BG nominated as arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg (“Berg”). Argentina
nominated Alejandro M. Garro (““Garro”). Berg and Garro selected Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez as
the third arbitrator and President of the Arbitral Tribunal so constituted. The Arbitral Tribunal
was formally constituted on June 22, 2004.

8. BG filed and served its Statement of Claim dated February 7, 2005.

9. Argentina filed and served its Answer dated November 7, 2005.

10. The Arbitral Tribunal conducted a preliminary conference in New York on
October 29, 2004. It issued a scheduling order dated November 8, 2004 that scheduled a hearing
for January 30 through February 6, 2006. In fact, the hearing occurred in Washington, D.C. on
July 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, 2006.

11. On December 24, 2007, the Arbitral Tribunal issued the Award in favour of BG
and against Argentina in the amount of $185,285,485.85, which amounts to 78% of the amount

BG had claimed), together with costs and attorneys’ fees of $1,302,623 and £2,414,141.10, plus

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 4 of 29

interest from January 6, 2002 until the date the Award is paid (or a total of $186,588, 108.85 plus
£2,414,141.10).

12. Argentina was notified of the Final Award on December 24, 2007.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

13. The claims raised in the Arbitration between the parties to the proceedings were
allegedly based on the Bilateral Investment Treaty by and between the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of
Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 11 December 1990 (the
“Argentina-U.K. BIT”, or the “BIT”).

14. The complex facts in this case are compounded by the events that took place in

Argentina before and subsequent to the execution of the BIT.

I. PRIVATIZATION

15. In 1989, Argentina enacted necessary economic measures, as part of a wide
reformation process, to reduce inflation and the public deficit. Law 23.696 of 17 August 1989
provided, inter alia, for the privatization of certain state owned companies in many sectors
including the gas transportation and distribution industry - Gas del Estado, Sociedad del Estado
(Gas del Estado), electricity, telecommunications, and water and sanitation.

16. The restructuring of the gas industry for the purpose of its privatization was set
forth in Decree 48/91, Decree 633/91, Law 24.076 (the Gas Law) and Decree 1738/92 (the Gas
Decree).

17. In 1991, Argentina enacted Law 23.928 of 27 March 1991 (the Convertibility

Law), which established a 1 to 1 fixed parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 5 of 29

18. The assets of Gas del Estado were divided into two transportation companies and
eight distribution companies. One of the gas distribution companies was Distribuidora de Gas
Metropolitana S.A. This entity’s corporate name subsequently changed to MetroGAS.

19. Pursuant to Resolution 874/92 of 12 July 1992, an international public tender was
called for in order to sell a controlling interest in the transportation and distribution companies.

20. Gas Argentino, S.A. (GASA) was the successful bidder for the 70% ownership
interest of MetroGAS. GASA, a consortium of investors consisting of BG, Compafifa Naviera
Pérez Companc S.A. Comercial, Financiera, Inmobiliaria, Minera, Forestal y Agropecuaria
(Pérez Companc), Astra Compafifa Argentina de Petréleo S.A. (Astra) and Invertrad S.A. (the
Initial Shareholders) was formed for the sole purpose of holding this ownership interest.

21. BG’s initial 41% interest in GASA increased on August 11, 1998 when it
acquired an additional 13.67% interest via a transfer from Pérez Companc through British Gas

International BV, its wholly owned subsidiary (BG International).

II. THE LICENSE

22. On December 21, 1992, the then Argentine President issued Decree 2459/92,
which granted the predecessor of MetroGAS a 35-year exclusive license (the “MetroGas
License”) to distribute natural gas in the City of Buenos Aires and the southern and eastern
greater metropolitan Buenos Aires area.

23. Pursuant to its terms the MetroGAS License is governed by the laws of Argentina.

24. The MetroGAS License provided that tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars

and expressed in pesos, within the framework of the Convertibility Law.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 6 of 29

25. Under the adjustment provisions of the MetroGAS License, tariffs would be
adjusted every six months in accordance with the U.S. PPI (the “U.S. PPI Adjustment’);

26. MetroGAS was entitled to a review every five years to maintain tariffs at a level
sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return after covering costs, taking into account the
licensees efficiencies and investments (the “Five Year Review”); and

27. Beyond the Five Year Review, MetroGAS could also request an “extraordinary

review” based summarily on “objective and justified” grounds (the “Extraordinary Review”).

Ill. THE ECON

 

IC CRISIS AND STATE OF NECESSITY

28. During the decade of 1990, Argentina was seen as a model of successful
policymaking. By pegging its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar under a currency board type
arrangement in 1991, Argentina ended hyperinflation, reducing inflation rates to single-digit
levels. The World Bank in 1998 rated Argentina second only to Singapore among emerging
markets in the quality of its bank supervision (Perry and Serven 2002). Greater economic
stability attracted foreign investment, which contributed to acceleration in economic growth.!

29. The collapse of the Brazilian currency — among several external shocks that
severely affected the Argentine economy - led to sharp declines in export revenues, and
economic growth was negative for three years in a row.

30. In 2001, a run on Argentine banks occurred causing Argentine central bank
reserves to fall by $500 million in one day, and as a result, the Argentine government imposed a
$1,000 per month limitation on personal bank withdrawals.

31. Subsequently, the IMF withheld from Argentina a $1.24 billion loan instalment.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 7 of 29

32. Riots and upheavals dominated Argentina and five Presidents took office within a
period of 12 days.

33. On December 24, 2001, Argentina announced it could no longer guarantee
payment on foreign debt.

34. As a result of the entire situation, on January 6, 2002, Argentina enacted the
Emergency Law, declaring a state of emergency throughout the country.

35. In 2002, Argentina faced inflation of over 70% and an economic contraction that
rivalled the Great Depression that struck the United States.”

36. In facing the worst recession of its history, the Argentine government adopted a
series of policies and measures (the “Measures”) to bring stability back to the country. Among
other measures, the Emergency Law:

a. terminated the currency board established by the Convertibility
Law which had pegged the peso to the dollar (parity between the peso and the U.S. dollar had
been destroyed already by market forces);

b. set aside dollar denominated adjustment clauses converting
dollar-denominated agreements under Argentine law into peso-denominated agreements;

c. eliminated the U.S. PPI adjustment mechanism by prohibiting
indexation clauses tied to international price indices, and

d. converted dollar denominated tariffs into pesos at the rate of

one peso to one U.S. dollar.

IV. THE ARBITRATION

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 8 of 29

37. BG’s claims in the Arbitration focused on the argument that the Measures
damaged MetroGAS and caused economic loss:

In short, as a result of [the] Measures, MetroGAS’s
business is no longer viable. MetroGAS’s tariff revenue is
no longer sufficient to cover its costs and provide a
reasonable rate of return, as promised in the Regulatory
Framework. Some three years after the January 2002 Law
was enacted, the absence of a renegotiated Licence or
material tariff increase means that MetroGAS remains in a
critical financial condition and at the mercy of its creditors.
38. BG further alleged that Argentina had breached the following provisions of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT:
a. Article 5 by expropriating BG’s (i) shareholder interest in
GASA and MetroGAS and, alternatively, (ii) rights under or related to the MetroGAS License;
and
b. Article 2.2 (i) by failing to provide BG fair and equitable
treatment and protection and security, (ii) by taking unreasonable and discriminatory measures,
(iii) by failing to observe obligations entered into with regard to BG’s Investments, and (iv) for
acts of its judiciary.
39. BG requested that the Tribunal rule:
a. that it had jurisdiction over the parties’ dispute and reject
Argentina’s objections to such jurisdiction as well as its motion to dismiss BG’ claims;
b. that Argentina had breached Article 5(1) of the Argentina-U.K.
BIT by expropriating BG’s investment without just compensation;

c. that Argentina breached Article 2(2) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT

by mistreating BG’s investment in violation of the standards of treatment provided therein;

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 9 of 29

d. that Argentina compensate BG in an amount of $238.1 million
plus interest at the average interest rate applicable to U.S. six-month certificates of deposit,
compounded semiannually;

e. in favour of BG for such additional relief as the Tribunal
considers appropriate; and

f. that Argentina pay the costs of the arbitration proceedings,
including the Tribunal’s fees and expenses, and the cost of BG’s legal representation, plus
interest.

40. Argentina requested that the Tribunal:

a. Dismiss BG’s claims for lack of jurisdiction and award
expenses to Argentina, including costs and expenses of the Tribunal and all other expenses paid
by Argentina related to the this arbitration and

b. Dismiss BG’s complaint, with costs to be paid by BG.

GROUNDS REQUIRING VACATION OF THE AWARD
I. The Tribunal Exceeded Its Authority and Lacked Jurisdiction
Al. The Arbitrators exceeded their authority by disregarding terms of parties'
agreement. State, Office of Employee Relations v. Communications Workers of America, AFL-
CIO, 154 N.J. 98, 711 A.2d 300, 159 L.R.R.M. (BNA) 2401 (1998)
42. Article 8 of the BIT states in pertinent parts:
a. Disputes with regard to an investment which arose within
the terms of this Agreement between an investor of one
Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party, which
have not been amicably settled shall be submitted, at the
request of one of the Parties to the dispute, to the decision

of the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the investment was made;

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 10 of 29

b. The aforementioned disputes shall be submitted to
international arbitration in the following cases:

i. if one of the parties so requests, in any of the
following circumstances:

I. where, after a period of eighteen months has
elapsed from the moment when the dispute
was submitted to the competent tribunal of the
Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment was made, the said tribunal has not
given its final decision;

Il. where the final decision of the aforementioned
tribunal has been made but the Parties are still
in dispute;

ii. where the Contracting Party and the investor of
the other Contracting Party have so agreed...

43. In essence, BG would have been able to recourse to international arbitration if the
following two requirements are met:

a. a period of eighteen months has elapsed from the time when the dispute was
submitted to the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory
the investment was made, Argentina in this case, and

b. the aforementioned tribunal has not made a final decision, or even if it has, the
Parties were still in dispute.

44. BG did not file its grievances with the Argentine courts, as it was required to do
by agreement, but rather it invoked the application of the Most-Favoured Nation Clause
(MFNC), and brought its claim directly to the International Centre for the Settlement of
Investment Disputes (the “ICSID”).

45. BG claimed that, according to customary international law, it was excused from

exhausting the local remedies before going to international arbitration since its claims could have

never been resolved within the period of time required by the BIT.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 11 of 29

46. The Tribunal referred to customary international law but limited its review for the
purpose of understanding the evolution of International Investment Law (“IIL”). 3

47. The Tribunal correctly recognized that the investment bilateral treaties have
transformed IIL to determining the filing parameters against the Government in whose territory
an investment has been made. Thus, it concluded that BG’s reliance on the exceptions to the
customary international law rule of exhaustion of local remedies in this matter was difficult to
accept.

48. The Tribunal agreed with Argentina that as a matter of treaty law, investors acting
under the Argentina-UK BIT must litigate in the host State’s courts for 18 months before they
can bring their claims to arbitration.

49. Notwithstanding this clear conclusion, the Tribunal arbitrarily decided to excuse
BG from abiding by the terms of the very Treaty BG sought to enforce. Furthermore, the
Tribunal has construed the disputed agreement in a completely irrational way. See Anthony v.
Kaplan, 324 Ark. 52, 918 S.W.2d 174 (1996).

50. The Tribunal capriciously concluded that “the regular operation of the courts in
Argentina came under significant pressure after promulgation of the Emergency Law.”

51. The Tribunal referred to Decrees No. 214/02, 320/02 and 1090/02 and to Ministry
of Economy Resolution No. 308/02.

52. Based on these regulations, the Tribunal charged the Argentine Government with
exercising “significant pressure on the local judiciary after promulgation of the Emergency

Law.

> Award, | 148

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 12 of 29

53. The Tribunal failed to make findings of fact and conclusions of law but rather
based its decision on:

“....The Tribunal is also persuaded that under the dire
circumstances surrounding the emergency measures, the
Executive Branch sought to prevent the collapse of the
financial system by (i) directly interfering with the normal
operation of its courts, and (ii) by excluding litigious
licensees from the renegotiation process.”

54. The tribunal cited no facts or precedents to support its charge against the
executive branch of a sovereign nation for its alleged interference with the Argentine judicial
system.

55. Furthermore, the Tribunal failed to support its erroneous conclusion with any
reasoning sufficient to justify its decision. In fact, as can be seen from the Tribunal’s review of
the parties positions on this point, the issue that the Tribunal referred to was not discussed by the
parties.

56. On the contrary, it disregarded the fact that Decree No. 214/02 — Section 12,
modified by Decree No. 320/02, only ruled the temporary stay of enforcement of precautionary
measures and stay of execution in those legal processes filed against the Argentine Government
by virtue of the emergency legislation. This stay, which was originally enacted for a period of
180 days, was extended only once (through Decree No. 320/02) for another 180 days.

57. These regulations were not an obstacle for BG to bring its grievance against the
local courts in Argentina.

58. Assuming arguendo that the aforementioned regulations would have impaired

BG’s claim in the Argentine courts, BG was obligated nonetheless under the BIT to prosecute its

© Award, {[ 155

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 13 of 29

claim before the local courts. Only after a period of eighteen months where decision had not
been reached, BG could have submitted its claim to international arbitration.

59. Furthermore, BG lacked standing to arbitrate MetroGAS’ claim. BG claimed
damages on the value of its shares allegedly caused by (or derived from) measures adopted by
Argentina which had a negative impact on the activities of MetroGAS and, hence, on the value
of its shareholding in GASA and in MetroGAS. Despite of recognizing that the measures
adopted by Argentine Government only affected Metrogas’s rights, the Tribunal granted BG a
compensation because of such measures.

60. The Tribunal exceeded their powers in (i) permitting BG to arbitrate its claims
contrary to the terms of the BIT and (ii) bringing a derivative claim on behalf of MetroGAS.

IL. The Arbitral Tribunal Erred by Arbitrarily Rejecting Argentina’s Evidence of
the Applicability of the State of Necessity Doctrine.

6l. Despite abundant evidence that Argentina suffered an economic crisis of epic,
even historical, proportions the Arbitral Tribunal summarily rejected Argentina’s claim that its
state of emergency justified application of emergency measures pursuant to the state of necessity
doctrine. The Arbitral Tribunal misunderstood applicable law, the state of necessity doctrine, and
failed to correctly apply the doctrine.

62. Indeed, the Arbitral Tribunal recognized that Argentina had encountered
extraordinary and sudden economic travails. “The Tribunal is also persuaded that under the dire
circumstances surrounding the emergency measures, the Executive Branch sought to prevent the
collapse of the financial system...”

63. Despite such recognition of “dire circumstances surrounding [the enactment of the
temporary] emergency measures”, the Arbitral Tribunal summarily and without reasoning

rejected the application of the state of necessity doctrine.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 14 of 29

64. In a mere, short seven paragraphs of the Award (totaling 467 paragraphs and 138
pages) the Arbitral Tribunal arbitrarily dismissed Argentina’s state of necessity defense.

65. The Arbitral Tribunal rested its entire unreasonable rejection of the state of
necessity defense on the false assumption that “...the Argentine-U.K. BIT implies such an
exclusion” (emphasis added).

66. The Argentine-U.K. BIT neither overtly nor impliedly implies the exclusion of
the state of necessity defense.

67. The Arbitral Tribunal offered no reasoning whatsoever to support the conclusion
that “*...the Argentine-U.K. BIT implies such an exclusion” (emphasis added).

68. The Arbitral Tribunal failed in the Final Award to point to any provision in the
Argentine-U.K. BIT containing such alleged implication. The Arbitral Tribunal failed in this
regard for good reason; there is, in fact, no such implied provision in the Argentine-U.K. BIT.

Il. |The ICC International Court of Arbitration Erred in Permitting Albert Jan van
den Berg to Serve as Arbitrator

69. The International Court of Arbitration exceeded its authority by failing to
disqualify Berg from serving as arbitrator as Argentina had requested the Arbitral Tribunal do.
The impartiality and objectivity required of Berg were fatally compromised by his prejudice and
bias against Argentina.

70. By way of background, as a result of Argentina’s 2001 economic crisis, no fewer
than thirty international arbitration proceedings were commenced against Argentina.

71. Berg had been appointed as arbitrator by claimants in four such arbitrations —
LG&E, BG, Enron and recently in case brought by Italian nationals. Even though he ruled
against Argentina in the first three cases, as regards state of necessity, a crucial issue for

Argentina’s defense, the reasoning of the first Tribunal that decided on the merits of the case, in

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 15 of 29

the LG&E case, contradicted that of the other two Tribunals, in the Enron and BG cases, without
any dissenting or, at least, separate opinion rendered by Berg that could have explained his
change of mind in such a short period of time. In the Decision on liability in the LG&E case,
which involved an investment in the natural gas sector, Berg recognized that Argentina’s crisis
justified the application of Article XI of the Argentina-US BIT — a provision that authorizes the
adoption of measures necessary to protect public order and essential security interests — and also
of the state of necessity under customary international law. This was an unprecedented decision,
since it was probably the first time in which an international tribunal admitted the application of
the state of necessity as such to the facts of the case. Only 7 months later, in the Enron decsision,
Berg found, regarding the same crisis, with respect to another investment as well in the gas
sector - and applying the same treaty - that Argentina could not rely on Article XI of the
Argentina-US BIT and on the state of necessity to justify the same measures he had analyzed in
the LG&E decision.

72. Finally, in this arbitration, Berg decided the very same issues he had earlier ruled
on based on nearly identical facts (the only principal difference being that the BIT was with the
U.K, not the U.S.).

73. Based on the same facts, the same issues, the same measures and the same time
period, Berg rejected the state of necessity doctrine — the Argentina-UK BIT not having an
Article XI-type clause - and found Argentina liable for substantial damages.

74. The chart below sets forth the inconsistency in the three decisions rendered by

Berg involving identical facts, issues, measures and time period.

75. Due to his arbitrary and abrupt change of mind between the time of the LG&E

 

and Enron decisions, which Berg never even tried to explain through a separate opinion,
Argentina challenged Berg in this proceeding. The International Court of Arbitration of the
International Chamber of Commerce (the “ICC Court”) rejected the challenge, without providing
any reasons..

76. Berg’s capricious stance in treating Argentina’s necessity defense evidences
partiality against Argentina. Further, the ICC Court exceeded its power in rejecting Argentina’s
challenge in the circumstances of the case. For these two reasons, the Award should be vacated.

77. Further, Argentina argued here, as it did in the LG&E case, the defense of state of
necessity. The term ‘state of necessity’ under international law describes a situation in the
presence of which a state is excused from performing an international obligation. Such situation
is generally believed to be an actual threat to a state’s essential interest.

78. By this failure to recognize, or acknowledge, Berg’s prior treatment of the defense

of necessity and his views on Argentina’s performance under the applicable BIT, the Arbitration

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 17 of 29

Tribunal clearly failed to arbitrate the dispute in an impartial and objective manner and, in so
doing, the Tribunal exceeded its authority under § 10(a)(4) of the Federal Arbitration Act. 7
IV. Corruption, Fraud or Undue Means

79. Section 10(a)(1) of the FAA provides that the Final Award may be vacated
“[w]here the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.”

80. Evidence of such corruption, fraud, or undue means is present in this matter.

81. Counsel for BG is also counsel in several other arbitration actions commenced
against Argentina, including Total S.A. v. Reptiblica Argentina (ICSID Case No. ARB/04/1). In
January 2008 a hearing on the merits for this case was carried out in Washington D.C. At that
hearing Argentina learned that the witness statements prepared for use in such arbitration had
been written by counsel for Total based on interviews with the witnesses.

82. Total and BG were represented by the same law firm. Witness statements
presented in this case have many passages that are identical or substantially identical to a witness
statement presented in the Total case. This would show that such witness statements do not
necessarily reflect what the witness saw, thought or believed at the time to which the statement
refers. Rather, they reflect what Counsel would have witness declare, with unrelated fact
witnesses saying roughly the same in two different cases, in order to influence the Tribunals in
this case and in the Total case by undue means.

83. It should be borne in mind that the “similar” witness statements prepared in the
two cases were inter alia directed to evince the witnesses’ expectations, as officials of BG and
Total, in relation to Argentina’s promises as to how it would treat their investments, in light of
the gas regulatory framework. The concept of the investor’s legitimate expectations has evolved
as one of the main features of international investment litigation, having a fundamental bearing

17

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 18 of 29

on the issue of whether the standard of fair and equitable treatment was breached (precisely the
standard which the BG, Enron and LG&E Tribunals found Argentina had breached and on the
basis of which those Tribunals granted damages to the claimants). By constructing the statements
of (at least) two witnesses in this case and one in the Total case, counsel “created” the legitimate
expectations of those witnesses for the purpose of the underlying and the Total proceedings, in
order to unduly support their allegation as to the breach of the fair and equitable treatment
standard, allegation which proved successful.

84. In the present arbitration claimant put forth witnesses, William Harvey Adamson
(“Adamson”) and Richard Souchard (“Souchard”), and in the Total v. Argentina litigation the
claimant, represented by the same counsel as BG, put forth witness Francois Faurés (“Faurés”).

85. For example, compare {| 53 of the Faures statement with 47 of Adamson’s:

53. | The WACC was the weighted average of TGN’s: (a) cost of debt; and (b) cost
of equity. In using the WACC methodology to discount cash flows,
ENARGAS recognised that TGN (in common with the other Licensees) had

leveraged itself with debt to finance its investments, as explained above.

cost of debt capital; and (b) cost of equity capital. In using the
WACC methodology to discount cash flows, ENARGAS

86. Compare {| 54 of the Faures statement with J 48 of Adamson’s:

54. In calculating the WACC in the RQT I, ENARGAS determined that a
reasonable debt to equity ratio for TGN was 37:63. Given that the cost of debt
was lower than the cost of equity. a higher level of debt produced a lower
WACC, which in tum resulted in lower tariffs for consumers. By using a debt
to equity ratio of 37:63 in its WACC calculation applicable to tariffs for the
second five-year period, ENARGAS was thus able to pass the benefit of
TGN’s gearing onto consumers. In addition, ENARGAS used a cost of debt

(or interest rate) of 12.6 per cent that reflected the cost of intemational debt

In the RQT |, in calculating the WACC, ENARGAS determined that a

reasonable debt to equity ratio for MetroGAS and the other distribution companies

was 30:70. Given that the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity, a higher level
of debt produces a lower WACC, which in tum results in lower tariffs for consumers.
By using a debt to equity ratio of 30:70 in its WACC calculation applicable to tariffs
for the second five-year period, ENARGAS was able to pass the benefit of
MetroGAS’s gearing on to consumers. In addition, ENARGAS used a cost of debt

(or interest rate) of 13.02% that reflected the cost of international debt and not local

debt. In this way it was able to further lower the WACC and the tariffs.

The second Five-Year Review, or RQT IL, scheduled for 2002, never took
place. It was suspended by certain measures taken by the government, which I
outline briefly below. However, by the time it was suspended, ENARGAS
had already performed the WACC calculation (Which was based on the same
methodology as the calculation used in the RQT I) that it intended to apply to
fix the tariffs for the third five-year period of 2003 to 2007. The report on the
calculation of the WACC was issued by ENARGAS after I became involved
with TGN, on 13 November 2001.39

In calculating the WACC to be applied in the RQT II, ENARGAS determined
that a reasonable debt to equity ratio for TGN was 46:54, thus increasing this
ratio —(for the benefit of consumers) in accordance with TGN’s increased
gearing (50:50 at that time). In its RQT II calculations, ENARGAS also used
an even lower cost of debt — again for the benefit of consumers- than in the
RQT I, of 11.3 per cent. On the basis of its calculations, ENARGAS
determined that the WACC for TGN was 11.5 per cent, or 10.4 per cent in

“real” inflation adjusted terms.

strikingly

51. Incalculating the WACC to be applied in the RQT II, ENARGAS determined
that a reasonable debt to equity ratio for MetroGAS and the other distribution
companies was 29:71. In its RQT II calculations, ENARGAS used an even lower
cost of debt (or interest rate) than in the RQT I, of 11.3%. On the basis of its
calculations, ENARGAS determined that the WACC for MetroGAS (and the other

distribution companies) was 12.1% (real, ie. inflation adjusted).

89. Likewise, { 60 of the Faures statement and { 66 of Adamson reveal strong
similarities:

The January 2000 Agreement

60. In December 1999, a new President, Fernando de la Rija, took office in
Argentina. In advance of the US PPI adjustment of gas transportation and
distribution tariffs scheduled for January 2000, the newly elected govemmment
became concemed about an unusually sharp increase in US inflation over the
previous six months compared to local inflation. The government feared that
the, albeit small, impact this increase would have on consumer gas tariffs
might evoke an adverse consumer reaction in the context of a deepening

recession in Argentina,

The January 2000 agreement

66. In advance of the US PPI adjustment of gas transportation and distribution
tariffs scheduled for January 2000, the newly elected Government became concemed
about an unusually sharp increase in the US inflation over the previous six months,
particularly compared to local inflation. The Government feared that the (albeit
small) impact this increase would have on gas prices might evoke an adverse
consumer reaction in the context of a deepening recession in Argentina. This was
particularly so given that Mr de la Réa’s party had promised a reduction in public

service tariffs in its election campaign.
90. Further comparisons of the two statements demonstrate duplication:

66. After seven and a half years of uncontested application of the US PPI
adjustment, in August 2000, the Argentine ombudsman brought a claim before
the Argentine courts to strike down that mechanism in the gas transportation
and distribution sector, alleging that it was unconstitutional, The ombudsman
also sought an injunction suspending the July Agreement and Decree
669/2000.

20

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 21 of 29

75. Once again, Argentina failed to live up to its agreement. The stabilisation
fund was never created. More importantly, after seven and a half years of
uncontested application of the US PPI adjustment, in August 2000, the Argentine
ombudsman started proceedings before the Argentine courts alleging that the US PPI-
linked adjustment of the tariffs in the gas industry was unconstitutional. These
proceedings were extended to include a request by the ombudsman for an injunction
suspending the provisions of Decree 669/2000. The Judge responsible for the case
issued an injunction on 18 August 2000 suspending the application of Decree
669/2000, pending resolution of the underlying claim of unconstitutionality.

69. The Court of Appeals of Buenos Aires eventually rejected all appeals against
the injunction on 5 October 2001.37 TGN, together with the other Licensees,
ENARGAS and the government, filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of

Argentina. However. these proceedings were swiftly overtaken by even more

draconian measures taken by the government in January 2002, which I outline

below.

together with ENARGAS and the Licensees, against the injunction. On 5 October
2001, the Court of Appeal of Buenos Aires dismissed all appeals against the
injunction. MetroGAS, together with the other Licensees, ENARGAS and the

 

Government, filed an appeal with the Supreme Court of Argentina. However, these
proceedings were swifily overtaken by even more draconian measures taken by the

Government in January 2002, which I outline below.

91. Paragraphs 71/72 and 78/79 of the respective Faures and Adamson statement are

similar, if not identical:

Ill ARGENTINA’S MEASURES FROM JANUARY 2002

71. At the end of 2001, the economic difficulties in Argentina deepened leading to
another change in government. President Duhalde took over on 1 January
2002

A. THE EMERGENCY LAW AND IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS

72. On 6 January 2002, the new administration implemented a new economic plan
whose main pillar was (and remains) the Public Emergency and Reform of the

Exchange Rate Mechanism Law (the Emergency Law).

21

B. THe JANUARY 2002 Law AND SUBSEQUENT REGULATIONS.

to another change in Government, President Duhalde took over on I January 2002.

The January 2002 Law
79. On 6 January 2002, the new administration implemented a new economic
plan, in the form of the Public Emergency and Reform of the Exchange Rate
Mechanism Law (the January 2002 Law).

92. Further comparisons:

74. This rate was artificial given that the Emergency Law and its subsequent
regulations also abolished the peso-dollar peg that had been in force in
Argentina since 1991, with the result that the market exchange rate soared to
approximately four pesos to one dollar, eventually stabilising at a rate of

approximately three to one at the end of 2002.

one dollar, and frozen at that value. This rate was artificial given that the January
2002 Law and its subsequent regulations also abolished the peso-dollar peg that had
been in force in Argentina since 1991, with the result that the market exchange rate
soared to four pesos to one dollar, eventually stabilising at a rate of three to one. As a

result, MetroGAS’s revenue plummeted to one third of its previous dollar value.

93. Paragraphs 87 and 84 of the Faures and Adamson statements show still more
similarities:

87. The renegotiation process began around March 2002. Each company affected
by this process was required to submit certain information to the
Renegotiation Commission. The information consisted of: (a) a description of
the impact caused by the “emergency”, (b) a summary of the recent economic
and financial situation of the company. (c) information on the progress of the
company’s contract, (d) information on the company’s pending liabilities, (e)
the company’s proposals for overcoming the state of “emergency” and (f) an
initial presentation to the Renegotiation Commission and an executive

summary.

Argentina also advances the extraordinary argument that tariffs were only to be

calculated in dollars for as long as the Convertibility Law remained in force.?!

Argentina set out to create a Gas Regulatory Framework that would be capable

of attracting foreign investment by ensuring adequate rewards over the period

of the TGN Licence (some 35 or 45 years). A conditional link to the

first place.
14.

Argentina goes on to allege that the dollar-calculated tariffs were only to be

calculated in dollars for as long as the Convertibility Law remained in force
(Statement of Defence, [1]598; 604; 609; 618). This is counter-intuitive. Argentina

set out to create a regulatory framework capable of attracting foreign investment by

ensuring that the investment was adequately rewarded over the period of the Licence
(some 35 or 45 years). A conditional link to the Convertibility Law would have
entirely defeated this objective ~ indeed in such a case, there would have becn no
need to have dollar tariffs in the first place.

24

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 25 of 29

32, Given Argentina’s record of economic instability, the Convertibility Law
could never have constituted sufficient protection for foreign investors, since
its long-term continuance was not assured. Foreign investors, including Total,
‘would simply not have been prepared to assume the risk of devaluation in
Argentina. Thus, while the Convertibility Law was enacted as part of a larger
set of macro-economic reforms that Argentina undertook to balance its
economy, the Government offered dollar tariffs as the comerstone of the Gas
Regulatory Framework enacted specifically to attract investors into the gas
privatisation. In this context, it was clear to Total and to our legal advisors at
the time that the calculation of TGN’s tariffs in dollars provided a layer of
protection over and above the Conventibility Law for the period of the

 

Licence.

33. As is clear from the Licence, (i) the calculation of the tariffs in dollars and (ii)
the rate used to convert those dollar tariffs into pesos for billing purposes are
two distinct processes. Essentially, the conversion into pesos is a technical
process done to facilitate invoicing customers in pesos for a dollar-based tariff.
Itis logical that the Convertibility Law (enacted in 1991) was mentioned in the
TGN Licence simply because it was the exchange rate system prevailing at the
time (December 1992). Moreover, the Licence stipulates that dollar tariffs are
to be converted at the rate set out in the Convertibility Law “and its subsequent
modifications”> This meant that if the exchange rate changed from 1:1 as it
did in January 2002, the dollar tariffs should simply have been converted into

pesos at the new exchange rate.

privatisation, since its long-term continuance was not assured. Foreign investors,
including BG, were simply not prepared to assume the (clear and present) risk of
devaluation in Argentina. Thus, while the Convertibility Law was enacted as part of a
larger set of macro-economic reforms that Argentina undertook to balance its
economy, the Government offered dollar-calculated tariffs as the cornerstone of the
regulatory framework enacted specifically to attract invesiors to the privatisation of
the gas industry. In this contest, it was always clear to BG, and to our legal advisors,
that the calculation of MetroGAS's tariffs in dollars provided a layer of protection
over and above the Convertibility Law for the period of the Licence.

16. As is clear from the Licence, the calculation of the tariffs (in dollars) and the
rate used to convert those dollar tariffs into pesos for billing purposes were two
different things entirely. Convertibility (enacted in 1991) was simply the exchange
rate system prevailing at the time the Licence was granted (December 1992).
Moreover, as is also clear from the Licence, dollar-calculated tariffs were to be
converted into pesos for billing purposes in accordance with the parity set out in the
Convertibility Law and_its modifications. This meant that if the exchange rate
changed from one:one, as it did in January 2002, the dollar-calculated tariffs would be
converted into pesos at the new market exchange rate.

 

96. Returning to a comparison between Faures and Adamson:

25

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 26 of 29

43. 1 should note that when local inflation was higher than the US PPI, as it
generally was from 1992 (when the rules regulating TGN’s tariff structure
were set out) until 1998, as illustrated in the graph below, the Licensees never
argued that the resulting adjustment of tariffs was “unreasonable”. They
simply accepted that this was the bargain struck at the time of privatisation,
and dutifully decreased their tariffs in accordance with decreases in the US
PPI. It seems to me that Argentina should not be allowed to profit from the
commitment to the US PPI adjustment of tariffs when it suits it (fe when the
US PPI was lower than Argentine inflation) and disregard it completely when

it does not suit it (ie when the US PPI became higher than Argentine inflation).

31. [should note that when the Argentine Wholesale Price Index (IPM - Indice de
Precios al Mayorista) was higher than the US PPI (as it generally was from 1993
until 1998), the Licensees never argued that the adjustment of tariffs which resulted

as “unreasonable”. They simply accepted that this was the bargain struck at the
time of privatisation. It seems to me that Argentina should not be allowed to profit
from its decision to include the guarantee of the US PPI adjustment of tariffs when it
suits it (i.e, when the US PPI was lower than the equivalent Argentine index) and
disregard it completely when it does not suit it (i.e. when the US PPI became higher
than the equivalent Argentine index).

32. Argentina’s argument that the tariffs resulting from the US PPI adjustment
due in January 2000 “no longer reflected the evolution of MetroGAS’s costs” is
similarly incorrect. Adjustment in accordance with the US PPI was not supposed to
reflect the evolution of MeiroGAS's costs, but to reflect the fact that tariffs were
calculated in dollars. The purpose of this adjustment was to ensure that the tariffs
maintained their “real dollar” value between five-year tariff reviews. In any event,
the small tariff increase that the adjustment would have involved in no way implied a
distortion in MetroGAS's cost structure as argued by Argentina, particularly since the
majority of MetroGAS's costs, including its financial costs, were denominated in

doliars.

97. There are further comparisons that are cumulative. They are not included in order
not to burden the court. The inference is plain that such witness statements were harmonized and
prepared conjointly in such a way that each witness ignored or failed to address the particular
facts in the present arbitration. The statements in effect became the statements of non-parties and

thereby lacked probative value.

26

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 27 of 29

Vv. Disproportionate and Unfair Award

98. The Arbitral Tribunal ruled in favour of BG, ordering Argentina to pay it
$185,285,485.85, together with costs and attorneys’ fees of $1,302,623 and £2,414,141.10, plus
interest from January 6, 2002 until the date the Award is paid. The total Argentina must pay
amounts to $186,588,108.85 plus £2,414,141.10.

99. The Arbitral Tribunal held that Argentina did not violate Article 5 of the BIT
(expropriation) but did breach Article 2.2 of the BIT.

100. The Arbitral Tribunal recognized that Article 2 of the BIT provided no standard
for the calculation of compensation flowing from its breach.

101. Not deterred by the lack of a agreed standard for the calculation of damages, the
Arbitral Tribunal relied on a 1928 decision that merely established a broad standard (“breach of
an engagement involves an obligation to make reparation in an adequate form”).

102. It also turned to the draft ILC Articles, which are not so different from those
expressed in the 1928 decision (“...responsible state is under an obligation to make full
reparation for the injury caused by the...wrongful act’).

103. The Arbitral Tribunal also required that the damages complained of be
proximately caused by the wrongful act.

104. The Arbitral Tribunal then adopted a method to calculate damages that neither BG
nor Argentina sought.

105. The Arbitral Tribunal rejected the standard it should have applied, namely the
discounted cash flow method, and instead focused on an unreasonable comparison. It took the
value of an isolated 1998 transaction involving a transfer of GASA shares, which took place

before the measures at issue where adopted, and compared it against the value of another

27

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 28 of 29

transaction that took place after the measures were adopted. The Tribunal found that the first
transaction reflected the value of the company in which BG had invested, before the measures
were adopted, and that the second transaction reflected the value of that company after the
measures were adopted. The difference between the two values, the Tribunal found, reflected
BG’s damages (in the proportion of its shareholding participation). The serious flaw of the
Tribunal’s “method”, however, is that, from the time of the first transaction that occurred at the
peak of Argentina’s economy in the 1990s- and the second transaction, Argentina endured three
years and half of economic recession that resulted in a substantial reduction in the value of all
Argentine companies —as reflected in the free-fall of the Buenos Aires stock exchange- and that
period of the economic recession occurred prior to the measures, Argentina was held liable for
damages resulting not from its measures but from the general macroeconomic crisis.

106. Indeed, the use of a value of an allegedly “comparable” transaction from 1998 in
order to evaluate a pre-measures value was a manifest excess use of powers by the Tribunal. As
the Tribunal itself recognized, in the period from 1998 to 2002, the fall in GDP amounted to 25%
and the fall in GDP per capita amounted to 70%, independently of the measures at issue in the
arbitration. However, the value of BG’s participation in Metrogas, according to the Tribunal,
remained constant.

107. In using this method to calculate damages the Tribunal exceeded its powers in as
far as BG requested compensation for the alleged damages from the measures adopted by
Argentina. However BG never alleged that it could be compensated for the general effects of the
macroeconomic crisis in Argentina. In deciding to use this method for calculation of damages the
Tribunal in this case held Argentina responsible for all the effects of the macroeconomic crisis

that had afflicted it and did not isolate the alleged effects of the Measures. This is particularly

28

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 29 of 29

serious taking into account that the discounted cash flow method, which had been advocated by
both parties, allowed for the distinction between the effects of the measures and the effects of the
macroeconomic crisis on the investment.

108. This resulted in the multi-million dollar award against Argentina.

WHEREFORE, Argentina requests that this Court enter an order vacating or modifying
the Award and for such other and additional relief as the Court may deem appropriate or
necessary.

declaration in support of the Republic of Argentina’s motion to vacate or modify the Arbitral
Award (the “Award” or Final Award”) issued in the District of Colombia on December 24, 2007.

Tam the Assistant Attorney General of the Republic of Argentina for International Legal

Affairs.

THE PARTIES

1. Petitioner is the Republic of Argentina (“Argentina”) acting through the
Procuraci6n del Tesoro de la Nacién (Office of the Attorney General) whose principal office is
located at Posadas 1641, Buenos Aires, C.P. 1112, Republic of Argentina.

2. Respondent BG Group Plc. (“BG”) is a British corporation located at 100 Thames

Valley Park Drive, Reading Berkshire, RG6 1PT, in the United Kingdom.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 2 of 10

3. Petitioner seeks to vacate or modify that certain award (the “Award”) dated
December 24, 2007 rendered pursuant to arbitration (the “Arbitration”) that resulted in a
substantial monetary award in favor of BG and against Argentina (a copy of the Award is
annexed hereto as Exhibit A).

JURISDICTION

4. This court has jurisdiction over each of the parties and the subject matter of this
Petition pursuant to 9 U.S.C. §§ 201 et seq. because Argentina and BG agreed that Washington,
D.C. would be the seat of the Arbitration and of the final award, and they conducted the
Arbitration hearing within New York City and Washington, D.C. in July 2006 pursuant to the
United Nations Commission on International Trade Law Arbitration Rules (UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules) (9 U.S.C. §201).

5. This court has jurisdiction to vacate or modify the Award pursuant to the Federal
Arbitration Act (the “FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 10(a) and 11, which states in pertinent part:

Section 10(a): In any of the following cases the United States
court in and for the district wherein the award was made may make
an order vacating the award upon the application of any party to

the arbitration:

(1) Where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue
means.

(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption in the
arbitrators, or either of them.

(3) Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to
postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing
to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of
any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been
prejudiced.

(4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly
executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the
subject matter submitted was not made.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 3 of 10

(5) Where an award is vacated and the time within which the
agreement required the award to be made has not expired the court
may, in its discretion, direct a rehearing by the arbitrators.

Section 11: In either of the following cases the United States court
in and for the district wherein the award was made may make an
order modifying or correcting the award upon the application of
any party to the arbitration

(a) Where there was an evident material miscalculation of figures
or an evident material mistake in the description of any person,
thing, or property referred to in the award.

(b) Where the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not
submitted to them, unless it is a matter not affecting the merits of
the decision upon the matter submitted.

(c) Where the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting
the merits of the controversy.

The order may modify and correct the award, so as to effect the
intent thereof and promote justice between the parties.

THE ARBITRATION - PROCEDURAL HISTORY

6. On April 25, 2003 BG served upon Argentina a Notice of Arbitration (Exhibit B).

7. BG nominated as arbitrator Albert Jan van den Berg (“Berg”). Argentina
nominated Alejandro M. Garro (““Garro”). Berg and Garro selected Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez as
the third arbitrator and President of the Arbitral Tribunal so constituted. The Arbitral Tribunal
was formally constituted on June 22, 2004.

8. BG filed and served its Statement of Claim dated February 7, 2005.

9. Argentina filed and served its Answer dated November 7, 2005.

10. The Arbitral Tribunal conducted a preliminary conference in New York on
October 29, 2004. It issued a scheduling order dated November 8, 2004 that scheduled a hearing
for January 30 through February 6, 2006. In fact, the hearing occurred in Washington, D.C. on

July 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14, 2006.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 4 of 10

11. On December 24, 2007, the Arbitral Tribunal issued the Award in favour of BG
and against Argentina in the amount of $185,285,485.85, which amounts to 78% of the amount
BG had claimed), together with costs and attorneys’ fees of $1,302,623 and £2,414,141.10, plus
interest from January 6, 2002 until the date the Award is paid (or a total of $186,588, 108.85 plus
£2,414,141.10).

12. Argentina was notified of the Final Award on December 24, 2007.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND

13. The claims raised in the Arbitration between the parties to the proceedings were
allegedly based on the Bilateral Investment Treaty by and between the Government of the United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of the Republic of
Argentina for the Promotion and Protection of Investments of 11 December 1990 (the
“Argentina-U.K. BIT”, or the “BIT”).

14. The complex facts in this case are compounded by the events that took place in

Argentina before and subsequent to the execution of the BIT.

I. PRIVATIZATION

15. In 1989, Argentina enacted necessary economic measures, as part of a wide
reformation process, to reduce inflation and the public deficit. Law 23.696 of 17 August 1989
provided, inter alia, for the privatization of certain state owned companies in many sectors
including the gas transportation and distribution industry - Gas del Estado, Sociedad del Estado

(Gas del Estado), electricity, telecommunications, and water and sanitation.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 5 of 10

16. The restructuring of the gas industry for the purpose of its privatization was set
forth in Decree 48/91, Decree 633/91, Law 24.076 (the Gas Law) and Decree 1738/92 (the Gas
Decree).

17. In 1991, Argentina enacted Law 23.928 of 27 March 1991 (the Convertibility
Law), which established a 1 to 1 fixed parity between the Argentine peso and the U.S. dollar.

18. The assets of Gas del Estado were divided into two transportation companies and
eight distribution companies. One of the gas distribution companies was Distribuidora de Gas
Metropolitana S.A. This entity’s corporate name subsequently changed to MetroGAS.

19. Pursuant to Resolution 874/92 of 12 July 1992, an international public tender was
called for in order to sell a controlling interest in the transportation and distribution companies.

20. Gas Argentino, S.A. (GASA) was the successful bidder for the 70% ownership
interest of MetroGAS. GASA, a consortium of investors consisting of BG, Compafifa Naviera
Pérez Companc S.A. Comercial, Financiera, Inmobiliaria, Minera, Forestal y Agropecuaria
(Pérez Companc), Astra Compafifa Argentina de Petréleo S.A. (Astra) and Invertrad S.A. (the
Initial Shareholders) was formed for the sole purpose of holding this ownership interest.

21. BG’s initial 41% interest in GASA increased on August 11, 1998 when it
acquired an additional 13.67% interest via a transfer from Pérez Companc through British Gas

International BV, its wholly owned subsidiary (BG International).

II. THE LICENSE

22. On December 21, 1992, the then Argentine President issued Decree 2459/92,

which granted the predecessor of MetroGAS a 35-year exclusive license (the “MetroGas

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 6 of 10

License”) to distribute natural gas in the City of Buenos Aires and the southern and eastern
greater metropolitan Buenos Aires area.

23. Pursuant to its terms the MetroGAS License is governed by the laws of Argentina

24. The MetroGAS License provided that tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars
and expressed in pesos, within the framework of the Convertibility Law.

25. Under the adjustment provisions of the MetroGAS License, tariffs would be
adjusted every six months in accordance with the U.S. PPI (the “U.S. PPI Adjustment’);

26. MetroGAS was entitled to a review every five years to maintain tariffs at a level
sufficient to provide a reasonable rate of return after covering costs, taking into account the
licensees efficiencies and investments (the “Five Year Review”); and

27. Beyond the Five Year Review, MetroGAS could also request an “extraordinary

review” based summarily on “objective and justified” grounds (the “Extraordinary Review”).

Ill. THE ECON

 

IC CRISIS AND STATE OF NECESSITY

28. During the decade of 1990, Argentina was seen as a model of successful
policymaking. By pegging its exchange rate to the U.S. dollar under a currency board type
arrangement in 1991, Argentina ended hyperinflation, reducing inflation rates to single-digit
levels. The World Bank in 1998 rated Argentina second only to Singapore among emerging
markets in the quality of its bank supervision (Perry and Serven 2002). Greater economic
stability attracted foreign investment, which contributed to acceleration in economic growth.!

29. The collapse of the Brazilian currency — among several external shocks that
severely affected the Argentine economy - led to sharp declines in export revenues, and

economic growth was negative for three years in a row.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 7 of 10

30. In 2001, a run on Argentine banks occurred causing Argentine central bank
reserves to fall by $500 million in one day, and as a result, the Argentine government imposed a
$1,000 per month limitation on personal bank withdrawals.

31. Subsequently, the IMF withheld from Argentina a $1.24 billion loan instalment.

32. Riots and upheavals dominated Argentina and five Presidents took office within a
period of 12 days.

33. On December 24, 2001, Argentina announced it could no longer guarantee
payment on foreign debt.

34. As a result of the entire situation, on January 6, 2002, Argentina enacted the
Emergency Law, declaring a state of emergency throughout the country.

35. In 2002, Argentina faced inflation of over 70% and an economic contraction that
rivalled the Great Depression that struck the United States.”

36. In facing the worst recession of its history, the Argentine government adopted a
series of policies and measures (the “Measures”) to bring stability back to the country. Among
other measures, the Emergency Law:

a. terminated the currency board established by the Convertibility
Law which had pegged the peso to the dollar (parity between the peso and the U.S. dollar had
been destroyed already by market forces);

b. set aside dollar denominated adjustment clauses converting
dollar-denominated agreements under Argentine law into peso-denominated agreements;

c. eliminated the U.S. PPI adjustment mechanism by prohibiting

indexation clauses tied to international price indices, and

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 8 of 10

d. converted dollar denominated tariffs into pesos at the rate of

one peso to one U.S. dollar.
IV. THE ARBITRATION
37. BG’s claims in the Arbitration focused on the argument that the Measures
damaged MetroGAS and caused economic loss:
In short, as a result of [the] Measures, MetroGAS’s
business is no longer viable. MetroGAS’s tariff revenue is
no longer sufficient to cover its costs and provide a
reasonable rate of return, as promised in the Regulatory
Framework. Some three years after the January 2002 Law
was enacted, the absence of a renegotiated Licence or
material tariff increase means that MetroGAS remains in a
critical financial condition and at the mercy of its creditors.
38. BG further alleged that Argentina had breached the following provisions of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT:
a. Article 5 by expropriating BG’s (i) shareholder interest in
GASA and MetroGAS and, alternatively, (ii) rights under or related to the MetroGAS License;
and
b. Article 2.2 (i) by failing to provide BG fair and equitable
treatment and protection and security, (ii) by taking unreasonable and discriminatory measures,
(iii) by failing to observe obligations entered into with regard to BG’s Investments, and (iv) for
acts of its judiciary.
39. BG requested that the Tribunal rule:

a. that it had jurisdiction over the parties’ dispute and reject

Argentina’s objections to such jurisdiction as well as its motion to dismiss BG’ claims;

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 Filed 03/21/2008 Page 9 of 10

b. that Argentina had breached Article 5(1) of the Argentina-U.K.
BIT by expropriating BG’s investment without just compensation;

c. that Argentina breached Article 2(2) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT
by mistreating BG’s investment in violation of the standards of treatment provided therein;

d. that Argentina compensate BG in an amount of $238.1 million
plus interest at the average interest rate applicable to U.S. six-month certificates of deposit,
compounded semiannually;

e. in favour of BG for such additional relief as the Tribunal
considers appropriate; and

f. that Argentina pay the costs of the arbitration proceedings,
including the Tribunal’s fees and expenses, and the cost of BG’s legal representation, plus
interest.

40. Argentina requested that the Tribunal:

a. Dismiss BG’s claims for lack of jurisdiction and award
expenses to Argentina, including costs and expenses of the Tribunal and all other expenses paid
by Argentina related to the this arbitration and

b. Dismiss BG’s complaint, with costs to be paid by BG.

Grounds for Modifying or Vacating the Award

Al. As further detailed in Petition annexed hereto, Argentina requests that the

Award be vacated or modified on the grounds that:

a. The Tribunal exceeded its authority and lacked jurisdiction when it permitted
the BG Group to bring its complaint to the Tribunal rather than first
commence an action in the Courts of Argentina.

Case 1:08-cv-00485-RBW Document1-3 — Filed 03/21/2008 Page 10 of 10

b. The Arbitral Tribunal erred by arbitrarily rejecting Argentina’s evidence of
the applicability of the State of Necessity Doctrine,

c. The ICC International Court of Arbitration and/or the Arbitral Tribunal erred
when it permitted Albert Jan van den Berg to serve as arbitrator,

d. The Tribunal ignored the fact that BG Group perpetrated fraud on the
Tribunal, and

e. The Tribunal erred by awarding disproportionate and unreasonable damages
to BG Group,

42. The Tribunal’s violations materially affected the outcome and

unduly harmed the Petitioner.

Saldarriaga, and Sylvia Noury of Freshfields Bruckhaus
Deringer, and Francisco Macias of Marval, O'Farrell & Mairal.

2. The Respondent in this arbitration is The Republic of
Argentina (Argentina), acting through the Procuracién del
Tesoro de la Naci6n, located at Posadas 1641, Buenos Aires,
Argentina. Argentina was represented by Osvaldo César
Guglielmino, Cintia Yaryura, Jorge Barraguirre and Florencio
Travieso of the Procuracién del Tesoro de la Nacién. At the
hearing, however, the following individuals also appeared for
Argentina: Adolfo Gustavo Scrinzi (Subprocurador de la
Nacion), Felix Helou, Tomas Braceras, Rodrigo Ruiz-Esquide,
Nicolas Stern, Ariel Martins, Ignacio Torterola, Charles
Massano, Carlos Winograd, Alicia Federico and Mauricio
Longin D'Alessandro.

Il. The Tribunal and the Procedure

3. BG filed its Notice of Arbitration of 25 April 2003
pursuant to the Agreement between the Government of the
United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and
the Government of the Republic of Argentina for the
Promotion and Protection of Investments of 11 December
1990 (the Argentina-U.K. BIT or the BIT).! Article 8 of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT provides that:2

(1) Disputes with regard to an investment which
arise within the terms of this Agreement between an
investor of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party, which have not been amicably
settled shall be submitted, at the request of one of the
Parties to the dispute, to the decision of the

1. Exhibit J-69.
2. Where available, official English text of quotes shall be used.

competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the investment was made.

(2) The aforementioned disputes shall be
submitted to international arbitration in the following
cases:

(a) if one of the Parties so requests, in any of the
following circumstances:

(i) where, after a period of eighteen months has
elapsed from the moment when the dispute was
submitted to the competent tribunal of the
Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment was made, the said tribunal has not
given its final decision;

(ii) where the final decision of the afore-
mentioned tribunal has been made but the
Parties are still in dispute;

(b) where the Contracting Party and the investor of
the other Contracting Party have so agreed.

(3) Where the dispute is referred to international
arbitration, the investor and the Contracting Party
concerned in the dispute may agree to refer the
dispute either to:

(a) the International Centre for the Settlement of
Investment Disputes (having regard to the provisions,
where applicable, of the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States
and Nationals of other States, opened for signature at
Washington DC on 18 March 1965 (footnote omitted)
(provided that both Contracting Parties are Parties to
the said Convention) and the Additional Facility for
the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and
Fact-Finding Proceedings); or

(b) an international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitration
tribunal to be appointed by a special agreement or
established under the Arbitration Rules of the United
Nations Commission on International Trade Law.

If after a period of three months from written
notification of the claim there is no agreement to one
of the above alternative procedures, the Parties to the
dispute shall be bound to submit it to arbitration
under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law as then in

force. The Parties to the dispute may agree in writing
to modify these Rules.

(4) The arbitral tribunal shall decide the dispute in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
laws of the Contracting Party involved in the dispute,
including its rules on conflict of laws, the terms of any
specific agreement concluded in relation to such an
investment and the applicable principles of
international law. The arbitration decision shall be
final and binding on both Parties.

(5) The provisions of this Article shall not apply
where an investor of one Contracting Party is a
natural person who has been ordinarily resident in
the territory of the other Contracting Party for a
period of more than two years before the original
investment was made and the original investment
was not admitted into that territory from abroad. But,
if a dispute should arise between such an investor and
the other Contracting Party, the Contracting Parties
agree to consult together as soon as possible so that
they can reach a mutually acceptable solution.

4. Because the Parties failed to agree on submission of
the dispute to the International Centre for the Settlement of
Investment Disputes (ICSID), BG submitted to arbitration
under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations
Commission on International Trade Law (the UNCITRAL
Rules).

5. The Parties designated arbitrators in accordance with
Article 7(1) of the UNCITRAL Rules. BG appointed Professor
Albert Jan van den Berg and the Republic of Argentina
appointed Professor Alejandro M. Garro. Messrs. van den
Berg and Garro designated Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez as
President of the Arbitral Tribunal. The Tribunal was
constituted on 22 June 2004. The Arbitral Tribunal
appointed Mrs. Lucia Ojeda as its Administrative Secretary.

6. On 29 October 2004 a Preliminary Conference was
held in New York City to address issues related with the
conduct of the proceedings.

7. The Tribunal sees no need to burden the text of this
Award with a recital of correspondence with counsel. Nor is it
necessary to set out the content of the procedural orders

issued by the Tribunal,? which are all part of the written
record of the proceedings. No unresolved procedural issues
were extant as of the end of the hearing.

8. On 6 June 2007 Argentina challenged Professor Albert
Jan van den Berg pursuant to Article 11 of the UNCITRAL
Rules. BG rejected the challenge by letter of 11 June 2007.
Professor van den Berg stated his position by letter of 12 June
2007, declining to withdraw from office.

9. Argentina initially refused to submit the challenge to
the ICC International Court of Arbitration (ICC Court), the
appointing authority under Article 12(1)(b) of the UNCITRAL
Rules. Following failure by the Parties to agree on a new
authority that would be willing to make a decision on the
challenge, Respondent sought the designation of a new
appointing authority by the Permanent Court of Arbitration.
By letter of 15 August 2007, the Secretary-General of the
Permanent Court of Arbitration informed the Parties that it
had no power to replace the ICC Court as appointing
authority.

10.On 17 September 2007 BG informed the Tribunal of the
Parties’ joint request for the suspension of the preparation of
the award until | October 2007. By letter of 3 October 2007
BG informed the Tribunal that the suspension period had
expired without the Parties having agreed to an extension
and, therefore, that the Tribunal should resume _ the
preparation of the award.

ll. On 10 October 2007 Respondent submitted the
challenge to the ICC Court. On 21 December 2007 the
Secretariat of the ICC Court informed the Parties that, at its
session of that same day, the ICC Court had decided to reject
the challenge of Professor Albert Jan van den Berg.

12. Respondent filed its Memorial sobre Excepcién de
Incompetencia del Tribunal Arbitral with objections to
jurisdiction and admissibility on 24 March 2005. Claimant
filed its Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction on 9 May 2005.

3. The Arbitral Tribunal issued procedural orders on 30 June 2004
(Procedural Order No. 1), 8 November 2004 (Procedural Order No. 2,
amended on 24 June 2005, 5 July 2005, 13 July 2005, and 12 August
2005), 3 December 2004 (Procedural Order No. 3), 9 June 2005
(Procedural Orders Nos. 4 and 5), | July 2005 (Procedural Order No. 6),
10 February 2006 (Procedural Order No. 7), 14 June 2006 (Procedural
Order No. 8) , and 23 May 2007 (Procedural Order No. 9).

On 9 June 2005 the Arbitral Tribunal decided not to bifurcate
the proceedings (Procedural Order No. 5). Hence, this award
affirms the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and it also adjudicates
the merits of the dispute.

13. The hearing was held on 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14
July 2006 (the Hearing). The following witnesses appeared
before the Arbitral Tribunal:

a)

b)

Ill. Findings of Fact

16. The findings of fact set out in this Chapter of the award
are based on the documentary evidence and on the written
and oral testimony on the record.

A. BG’s Investment in Argentina

1. The Privatization of the Gas Industry

17. In 1989 Argentina took economic measures to reduce
inflation and the public deficit. Law 23.696 of 17 August 1989
provided, inter alia, for the privatization of certain state-
owned companies, including the gas transportation and
distribution monopoly Gas del Estado, Sociedad del Estado
(Gas del Estado). Almost two years later, Law 23.928 of 27
March 1991 (the Convertibility Law) established a | to | fixed
parity between the Argentine peso and the US dollar.

18. The gas industry was restructured for the purpose of its
privatization as set out in Decree 48/91, Decree 633/91, Law
24.076 (the Gas Law) and Decree 1738/92 (the Gas Decree).

 

The assets of Gas del Estado were divided into two
transportation companies and eight distribution companies.
One of the gas distribution companies was Distribuidora de
Gas Metropolitana S.A. This entity's corporate name
subsequently changed to MetroGAS.

19. Article 50 of the Gas Law created the Ente Nacional
Regulador del Gas (ENARGAS), at the time under the
responsibility of the Ministerio de Economia y Obras y
Servicios Ptiblicos (Ministry of Economy, Public Works and
Services). ENARGAS was, and remains at the time of the
rendering of this award, the regulatory agency charged with
the implementation and application of the new legal
framework for the privatization of the gas industry in
Argentina.

20. The transportation and distribution companies were
incorporated by Decree 1189/92 and the privatization process
was launched with the publication on 21 July 1992 of
Resolution 874/92 of 12 July 1992, which called for an
international public tender to sell a controlling interest in the
transportation and distribution companies. The terms,
conditions and rules governing the public bid were set out in
the Bidding Rules issued by the Ministerio de Economia y
Obras y Servicios Piiblicos (the Bidding Rules).* Resolution
874/92 also provided for the sale of a 70% interest in
MetroGAS.

21. The Republic of Argentina promoted the international
public tender among foreign investors by means of an English
language memorandum dated “September 1992” (the
Information Memorandum).5

22. On 2 December 1992, Decree 2255/92 approved model
licenses for the provision of gas transportation and
distribution services by the companies to be privatized.

23. Finally, on 21 December 1992, the President of
Argentina issued Decree 2459/92, which granted the
predecessor of MetroGAS an exclusive license to distribute
natural gas in an area comprising the City of Buenos Aires
and the southern and eastern greater metropolitan Buenos
Aires (the MetroGAS License).6 Decree 2459/92 was also

4. Exhibit J-100.
5. Exhibit J-101.
6. Exhibit J-113.

signed by Dr. Domingo F. Cavallo, then Minister of Economia
y Obras y Servicios Piblicos.

2. BG’s Participation in the

Privatization Process

24. Gas Argentino, S.A. (GASA) was the successful bidder
for the 70% ownership interest of MetroGAS that was
tendered for sale by Respondent in 1992. GASA was formed
by BG, Compania Naviera Pérez Companc S.A. Comercial,
Financiera, Inmobiliaria, Minera, Forestal y Agropecuaria
(Pérez Companc), Astra Compania Argentina de Petréleo
S.A. (Astra) and Invertrad S.A.’ (the Initial Shareholders) for
the sole purpose of holding this ownership interest. BG
initially owned 41% of GASA. On 11 August 1998 BG acquired
an additional 13.67% interest from Pérez Companc through
British Gas International BV, its wholly owned subsidiary (BG
International).8

25. On 28 December 1992, GASA, the Initial Shareholders,
MetroGAS, the Estado Nacional and Gas del Estado entered
into a Share Transfer Agreement.? The Estado Nacional and
Gas del Estado were represented by the Ministerio de
Economia y Obras y Servicios Piblicos.

26. After the Share Transfer Agreement, Argentina
continued to own 30% of MetroGAS, but it immediately
transferred 10% to an employee share program. In 1994,
Argentina offered the remaining 20% for sale in 1994 on the
Argentine stock market and on the New York Stock Exchange.
Between 1994 and 1998, BG increased its investment in
MetroGAS from 28.7% (held through GASA) to 45.11% (held
through GASA and BG International).!°

7. On 20 January 1993, Invertrad S.A. assigned its 14% interest in GASA
to Argentina Private Development Trust Company Limited (APDT). APDT
subsequently changed its corporate name to Argentina Private
Development Company Limited and assigned all its shares in GASA to
YPF.

8. BG International is a wholly owned subsidiary of BG Gas Netherlands
Holding BV (BGNH, also a wholly owned subsidiary of BG. On 12
November 1993, BG transferred to BGNH all of its shares in GASA.
Subsequently, BGNH’s GASA shares were transferred to BG International.
9. Exhibit J-115. MetroGAS and BG also entered into a Technical
Assistance Agreement dated 28 December 1992 and renewed on 28
December 2002.

10. BG, through BG International, purchased additional shares in
MetroGAS in 1994 (5.5%) and 1998 (1.34%).

 

 

 

B. The Regulatory Framework

27. The Regulatory Framework allegedly relied upon by
BG at the time of its investment in Argentina included:

a) Law 24.076 of 20 May 1992 (the Gas Law);

b) The Gas Decree 1738 of 18 September 1992 (the
Gas Decree); and

c) The MetroGAS License dated 21 December 1992
(the MetroGAS License).

28. The Tribunal will examine these legal texts seriatim.

1. The Gas Law (20 May 1992)

29. One of the stated objectives of the Gas Law was to
guarantee that the tariffs to be collected for the regulated
services were to be “. . . justas y razonables de acuerdo a lo
normado en la presente ley”."!

30. Pursuant to the Bidding Rules and the Information
Memorandum, the foundations for the tariff regime are to be
found in Title IX of the Gas Law. Thus, the following
principles of the Gas Law are relevant to ascertain the
expectations of the Parties at the time:

a) gas distributors operating efficiently and
prudently were to be given the opportunity to
collect “. . . ingresos suficientes para satisfacer
todos los costos operativos razonables .
impuestos, amortizaciones y una rentabilidad
razonable .. .”;!2

b) to achieve “rentabilidad razonable”, tariffs would
provide for a return commensurate to the return
of other activities of equal or comparable risk, and
they must be a function of the efficient and
satisfactory delivery of service;!3

c) tariffs would be adjusted by applying a
methodology based on international market
indicators “. . . gue reflejen los cambios de valor

Il. Article 2(d).
12. Article 38(a).
13. Article 39.

de bienes y servicios representativos de las
actividades de los prestadores...";!4 and

d) tariffs would be subject to review every five
years,'5 or on an extraordinary basis.!6

 

31. The Gas Law does not expressly address the currency
in which the tariffs were to be calculated or expressed. The
transportation and distribution tariffs are the object of
regulation in the Gas Decree and in the MetroGAS License, to
which this award now turns.

2. The Gas Decree (18 September 1992)

32. Article 41(1) of the Gas Decree introduces the US dollar
as the currency in which to assess and calculate the value of
transportation and distribution tariffs.

En la adecuaci6n normal y periddica de la tarifas
que autorice, [ENARGAS] se ajustard a los siguientes
lineamientos:

(1) Las tarifas de Transporte y Distribucién se
calculardén en Doélares." El Cuadro Tarifario
resultante serd expresado en pesos convertibles
segtin la Ley No. 23.928,'8 teniendo en cuenta para
su reconversion a pesos la paridad establecida en el
Articulo 3 del Decreto No. 2.128/91."°

33. Paragraph 3 of Article 41 of the Gas Decree builds on
Article 41 of the Gas Law by requiring incorporation in the
respective licenses?® of a mandatory tariff adjustment
methodology based on international market indicators.

14. Article 41.

15. Article 42.

16. Upon the request of the service provider (Article 46), or ex officio by
ENARGAS (Article 47).

17. Article 1(1) of the Gas Decree defines “Délar” as “. . . la moneda de
curso legal en los Estados Unidos de América’.

18. The Convertibility Law (Exhibit J-79).

19. Article 3 of the Decreto No. 2.128/91 (Exhibit J-86) establishes a | to 1
parity between the Argentine peso and the US dollar (“El PESO sera
convertible con el Délar de los ESTADOS UNIDOS DE AMERICA, a una
relaciin de UN PESO... . por cada Délar, para la venta, en las
condiciones establecidas por la Ley 23.928”).

20. Though Article 41 of the Gas Decree uses the Spanish term
habilitaciones, Article 4.5 of the Decree provides that such habilitaciones
take the form of a license.

 

34. Moreover, Article 42 of the Gas Decree fixes a time
limit for ENARGAS to issue rules relating to the methodology
for the review of tariffs every five years, as provided in Article
42 of the Gas Law. The Gas Decree offers some guidance to
the regulator:

(....) La revisién global del método empleado para
el cdlculo de las tarifas . . . se mantendrd por un
nuevo periodo de Cinco (5) afios contados a partir de
su vigencia, procurando observar los principios de
estabilidad, coherencia y previsibilidad tanto para
los Consumidores como para los Prestadores.

 

[ENARGAS] estableceraé las normas de
procedimiento para la revisién del método empleado
en el cdlculo de las tarifas que asegure la
participacion de los sujetos de la Ley (....)

35. Article 46 of the Gas Decree provides in turn for a set
of guidelines to proceed with the extraordinary review of
tariffs:

[ENARGAS] deberd establecer los requisitos que
deberdn cumplir los Transportistas, Distribuidores 0
consumidores en sus solicitudes de modificacién de
Tarifas o del Reglamento del Servicio a fin de
acreditar la necesidad de tales modificaciones.

Las modificaciones contempladas en el Articulo 46
de la Ley deberdn basarse en circunstancias
especificas no previstas con anterioridad, y no
podrdan ser recurrentes. Las mismas no incluyen el
reajuste que contempla el Articulo 42 de la Ley.

36. This analysis of the Gas Decree concludes by restating
one of its opening provisions. Article 4.5 gives reassurance to
licensees that their license may not be modified without their
consent:

. .. .) Las licencias otorgadas no . . . serdn
modificadas durante su vigencia sin el
consentimiento de los licenciatarios. No se
considerardn modificaciones a la licencia (i) las
modificaciones que [ENARGAS] introduzca en el
Reglamento del Servicio, sin perjuicio del derecho de
[ENARGAS] 0 del licenciatario a_requerir el
correspondiente ajuste de las tarifas si el efecto neto
de tal modificacién alterase en sentido favorable o
desfavorable, respectivamente, el — equilibrio
econémico - financiero existente antes de tal

modificaci6n; y (ii) los reajustes de la Tarifa que
conste[n] como anexo de la licencia y que se
practiquen de acuerdo con la_ Ley, esta
Reglamentacién y los términos de la respectiva
licencia. Al convocar a licitaci6n en caso de extincién
de una licencia, [ENARGAS] podrd modificar los
términos de la licencia vigente hasta ese momento.

37. The interpretation of the Gas Law and the Gas Decree
was the object of considerable disagreement between the
Parties. The Tribunal will address that controversy later in
this award. In so doing, the Tribunal will turn to the Bidding
Rules and to the Information Memorandum in order to
ascertain the understanding of the parties at the time of the
conclusion of their agreement.

3. The MetroGAS License (21
December 1992)

38. On 21 December 1992 the President of Argentina
issued Decree 2459/92 which granted the predecessor of
MetroGAS a 35 year exclusive license to distribute natural gas
in the City of Buenos Aires and the southern and eastern
greater metropolitan Buenos Aires.?! As indicated above,
Decree 2459/92 was also signed by Dr. Domingo F. Cavallo,
then Minister of Economia y Obras y Servicios Piblicos.

39. The text of Decree 2459/92 is itself brief. It comprises
eight Articles over six pages, plus three Annexes setting out in
detail the terms of the MetroGAS License: (i) the Reglas
Bdsicas (Annex 1); (ii) the Reglamento de Servicio (Annex
II); and (iii) the Tariffs (Annex III). The provisions of the
MetroGAS License relevant to the dispute between the Parties
are primarily located in Annex I (Reglas Bdsicas).

40. Before an examination of the rules set out in Annex I,
the Tribunal records that Article 1 of this Presidential Decree
provides that the MetroGAS License is granted under the
terms and conditions set out, inter alia, in the Gas Law, the
Gas Decree, Annex I (Reglas Bdsicas) and Annex III (Tariffs).

21. Exhibit J-113 (the MetroGAS License was subject to a 10 year
extension).

41. Section 9.2 of the MetroGAS License”? confirms the
application of the US dollar as the currency of reference for
the calculation and adjustment of tariffs:

El Anexo III del Decreto que aprueba estas Reglas
Badsicas contiene la tarifa que puede percibir la
Licenciataria.

La tarifa se ha calculado en dolares estadounidenses.
Los ajustes a que se refiere el punto 9.3. serdn
calculados en dolares estadounidenses.

El Cuadro Tarifario resultante o recalculado se
expresard en el momento de su aplicacién a la
facturacién en pesos ($) a la relacién para la
convertibilidad establecida en el art. 3° del Dto.
2128/91, reglamentario de la [Ley de
Convertibilidad] y sus eventuales modificatorios.

Dicha tarifa sélo sera modificada de conformidad
con lo establecido en la Ley [24,076],*> el Decreto
Reglamentario, estas Reglas Bdsicas y las
disposiciones de la misma Tarifa.

42. The tables of Annex III (Tarifas) setting out the
different tariffs indicate in the upper right hand corner that
they are expressed “en $ convertibles ley 23,928" .?5

43. Section 9.3 of the MetroGAS License sets out a useful
recapitulation of the tariff adjustment regime:

De acuerdo con los términos de la Ley y su Decreto
Reglamentario, se prevén las siguientes clases de
ajustes de tarifas:

a)  Periddicos y de tratamiento preestablecido

—  Ajuste por variaciones en los indicadores
de mercado internacional (articulo 41 de
la Ley)

—  Ajuste por variaciones en el precio del Gas
comprado

22. Unless otherwise specified, all references in the award to Sections of
the MetroGAS License are to Sections in Annex I (Reglas Basicas).

23. The Gas Law.

24. The Gas Decree.

25. Law 23,928 is the Convertibility Law.

—  Ajuste por variaciones en el costo del
Transporte

b) Periédicos y de tratamiento a preestablecer por la
Autoridad Regulatoria

—  Ajuste por la revisiébn quinquenal de
tarifas (articulo 42 de la Ley)

c) No recurrentes

—  Ajuste basado en circunstancias objetivas
y justificadas (articulo 46 de la Ley)

—  Ajuste por cambios en los impuestos
(articulo 41 de la Ley)

44. To summarize further the adjustment provisions of the
MetroGAS License:

a) tariffs would be adjusted every six months in
accordance with the US PPI (the US PPI
Adjustment);26

b) MetroGAS was entitled to a review every five years
to maintain tariffs at a level sufficient to provide a
reasonable rate of return after covering costs,
taking into account the licensees efficiencies and
investments (the Five Year Review);2’? and

  

c) outside the Five Year Review, MetroGAS could
also request an “extraordinary review” based on
“objective and justified” grounds (the
Extraordinary Review).?8

45. It is a matter of record that only one Five Year Review
was completed with respect to MetroGAS (RQT I in 1997),
and that a second Five Year Review (RQT II) was in progress
in January 2002, but was never concluded. On 8 February
2002, ENARGAS notified MetroGAS that the RQT IT process
was suspended pending completion of the renegotiation
process mandated by Law 25.561 adopted on 6 January 2002
(the Emergency Law).?9

26. Section 9.4.1.1 of the MetroGAS License. The License defines “PPI” as
“>... el ‘Indice de Precios del Productor — Bienes Industriales (1967 =
100) publicado por la Oficina de Estadisticas Laborales del
Departamento de Trabajo de los Estados Unidos .
27. Sections 9.4.1.2, 9.4.1.3 and 9.4.1.4 of the License.
28. Section 9.6.1 of the License.

29. Exhibit J-295.

   
 

46. The MetroGAS License also provides for the stability of
the Regulatory Framework and its tariff regime.

47. First, Section 9.1 of the MetroGAS License requires
that modifications to the Reglamento de Servicio be
responsive to the evolution and need to improve service, and
it calls for consultations with the licensee and a tariff
adjustment if the economic and financial equilibrium is
disturbed:

El Reglamento del Servicio podrd ser modificado
periddicamente, después de la fecha de vigencia, por
la Autoridad Regulatoria, para adecuarlo a la
evolucién y mejora del Servicio Licenciado. Cuando
tales modificaciones no se deban a la iniciativa de la
Licenciataria, corresponderd la previa consulta a la
misma. Dichas modificaciones no podradn alterar las
presentes Reglas Basicas y, si alteraran el equilibrio
econ6mico-financiero de la Licencia, dardn lugar [a
la] revisién de la Tarifa segiin lo determine la
Autoridad Regulatoria.

48. Section 18.2 of the MetroGAS License further
elaborates on the principles of stability and compensation:

El Otorgante no modificara estas Reglas Bdsicas, en
todo o en parte[,] salvo mediante consentimiento
escrito de la Licenciataria y previa recomendaci6n
de la Autoridad Regulatoria.

Las disposiciones que modifiquen el Reglamento del
Servicio y la Tarifa que adopte la Autoridad
Regulatoria no se considerardn modificaciones a la
Licencia en ejercicio de sus facultades, sin perjuicio
del derecho de la Licenciataria de requerir el
correspondiente reajuste de la Tarifa si el efecto neto
de tal modificacién alterase en sentido favorable o

desfavorable, respectivamente, el — equilibrio
econ6mico-financiero _existente antes de tal
modificacion.

49. Second, Section 9.8 of the License provides as follows
with respect to price controls:

No se aplicardn al régimen de tarifas de la
Licenciataria congelamientos, administraciones y/o
controles de precios. Si a pesar de esta estipulacién
se obligara a la Licenciataria a adecuarse a un
régimen de control de precios que estableciere un
nivel menor al que resulte de la Tarifa, la

Licenciataria tendrd derecho a una compensacién
equivalente pagadera por el Otorgante.

50. Upon expiration of the license term, MetroGAS would
be entitled to receive compensation in cash to the lower of:3°

a) the net book value of the assets;3! and

b) the net proceeds of a new competitive bid.

Sl. Finally, the MetroGAS License is governed by the laws
of Argentina and it includes the following jurisdictional clause
in Section 16.2:

Para todos los efectos derivados de la presente
Licencia en su relacién con el Otorgante,2 la
Licenciataria se somete a la competencia de los
tribunales en lo Contencioso Administrativo Federal
de la Capital Federal. En las controversias con otras
partes relativas a la Licencia, serd competente la
justicia federal.

52. The Tribunal will now turn to the crisis which
precipitated the dispute between the Parties.

C. The Crisis

53. Starting in 1998, external developments contributed to
the demise of the currency regime implemented by, inter alia,
the Convertibility Law:33

a) capitals stopped flowing to emerging markets
following the Asian crisis and the Russian default
of 1998;

b) demand weakened in Brazil, one of Argentina’s
major trading partners;

30. Section 11.3.1 of the MetroGAS License.

Le, the book value net of cumulative amortization of the essential
s, including historical cost (also net of cumulative amortization) of
the investments made by the Licensee during the term of the License not
challenged by ENARGAS. For purposes of this calculation, (a) investments
are to be determined on the b: of the price paid for the ntial assets
by MetroGAS in 1992, plus the original cost of subsequent investments,
converted into dollars and adjusted by US PPI, and (b) amortization shall
be calculated in US dollas plying normal rules of useful life of the
assets, regardless of the historic cost in Argentine currency or accelerated
amortization for fiscal purposes (Section 11.3.1 of the MetroGAS License).
32. Section 1.1 of the License defines Otorgante to mean “the National
Executive Branch” (el Poder Ejecutivo Nacional).

c) the price of Argentina’s exports relative to its
imports decreased considerably;

d) Argentina lost competitiveness abroad as a result
of the devaluation of the Brazilian currency and
the appreciation of the dollar; and

e) monetary policy was tightened by the U.S. Federal
Reserve in 1999 and 2000.

54. Given the Convertibility Law, Argentina could not
apply exchange rate adjustments and it lacked a monetary
policy to address the combined effect of these external
developments.*4 This led to a slowdown of the economy in
1998 and Argentina eventually plunged into a profound
recession.*5 The recession worsened in 2001, precipitating an
acute economic, social and political crisis.

55. Between 1999 and 2002, cumulative loss of GDP was
about 25% and real per capita GDP fell from $8,302 in 1998
to $2,595 in 2002.36 Public debt and the fiscal deficit
increased.*7

56. On 1 December 2001, Decree 1570/01 imposed
exchange controls and severe restrictions on the withdrawal
of funds from the banking system (the corralito).38 Argentina
subsequently declared a default on its foreign debt and the
IMF withheld funds scheduled to be delivered to Argentina by
the end of that year. The IMF also publicly withdrew its
support of Argentina’s economic program.?9

 

57. | The attack on the peso intensified. In the first days of
December 2001 on average 500 million dollars were being
withdrawn from the banking system every day. During the
last quarter of that year the Central Bank lost 11 billion dollars

37. Fiscal debt increased to 8% of GDP and the Balance of Payments
Current Account showed deficits every year between 1999 and 2001
(Folgar Witness Statement, p. 6).

38. Exhibit J-282. Corralito was the informal name for these measures
taken in order to stop a bank run. The corralito almost completely froze
bank accounts and forbade withdrawals from U.S. dollar-denominated
accounts. The Spanish word corralito is the diminutive form of corral,
which means “corral, animal pen, enclosure". The term alludes to the
restrictions imposed by the measure.

of reserves and 25% of funds on deposit vanished from the
financial system.4°

58. The crisis had social and political repercussions.

59. In May of 2002 unemployment peaked at 21.5% from
18.3% in October of 2001.4! Average wages decreased almost
70% in 7 months, from US$569.90 in October of 2001 to
US$190.00 in May of 2002.4? By the first quarter of 2002,
domestic consumption, including demand for public services,
had shrunk 20%.43

60. Five Presidents took office within a period of 12 days.
On | January 2002, Eduardo Duhalde became President and
on 6 January 2002 Argentina enacted the Emergency Law,
declaring a state of emergency throughout the country.44 The
Parties disagree as to whether the state of emergency has
been overcome.*5 The state of emergency is currently set to
expire on 31 December 2007.4¢

6l. The next Section of the award describes the corralito,
the Emergency Law and other measures taken by the
government of Argentina to address the crisis.

D. The Measures

62. Starting in 1999, Argentina adopted a series of
measures to address macroeconomic pressures, social unrest
and political instability. These measures had an effect on BG's
investment in MetroGAS and their examination is critical to
the adjudication of this dispute.

1. Suspension of the Application of

the US PPI

63. At the invitation of the Secretary of Energy, on 6
January 2000 all licensees, including MetroGAS, agreed to a
six month suspension (until | July 2000) of the US PPI
adjustments pursuant to the Gas Law (Article 41), the Gas
Decree (Article 41) and the MetroGAS License (Section 9.4.1.1

of the Reglas Basicas) until | July 2000. The Acta Acuerdo“’
which formalizes this agreement stated that:

a) the suspension was exceptional “. . . y por tinica
vez" ;48

b) the suspension was without prejudice to the
integrity of the Regulatory Framework, the
licenses and the “. . . compromisos y contratos
celebrados como resultado de la privatizacién de
Gas del Estado”;4?

c) the licensees would not be indemnified in case of
damage suffered as a result of the suspension;5°
and

d) the suspension should not be deemed as a
precedent, or as an amendment to the existing
legal framework.*!

64. Argentina did not implement the adjustment upon
expiry of the suspension on | July 2000. Instead, the
government once again invited the licensees to accept a two-
year deferral of the adjustment.52 Pursuant to the new
agreement, dated 17 July 2000:

a) tariffs payable as from July 2000 could be
increased by the US PPI uplift due in January
2000; and

b) the US PPI adjustments applicable from July
2000 to January 2002 were to be deferred until
30 June 2002.

65. This agreement was formalized by Decree 669/00,
signed by the President of Argentina. Decree 669/00
recognized that the licensees had a “derecho legitimamente
adquirido” to US PPI tariff adjustments.*3 The Presidential
Decree also acknowledges that bilateral investment treaties
are a part of the legal framework relevant to investments in
Argentina.*4

66. Decree 669/00 and the agreement concluded on 17
July 2000 were challenged before local courts by the
Argentine Ombudsman (Defensor del Pueblo de la Nacién)
on grounds that the US PPI adjustment mechanism was
unconstitutional and in breach of the amended Convertibility
Law. On 18 August 2000, a federal administrative court (the
Juzgado Nacional de Primera Instancia en lo Contencioso
Administrativo Federal No. 8) issued an injunction staying
the application of Decree 669/00 and the agreement of 17
July 2000.55

67. The injunction was appealed by both MetroGAS and
the Argentine authorities. The appeal memorial filed by the
Ministry of Economy and ENARGAS sheds light on the
purpose of the Regulatory Framework:

Cuando en los afios noventa se encaré en la
Argentina el amplio proceso privatizador, la
inflacién no habia sido derrotada. Para_atraer
inversores, en ese contexto se decidié ofrecer un
marco contractual que asegurara la estabilidad de
la_ecuacién_econémica _inicial, evitando que las
tarifas fueran licuadas por el incesante aumento de
precios, al punto de hacer inviable la explotacién
rentable de la actividad.

 

 

El instrumento elegido, en la mayoria de los casos,
fue fijar tarifas en délares con la cldusula de ajuste
segun la inflaci6n estadounidense, que
histéricamente habia seguido un curso mucho mds
estable que la argentina.

momento del procedimiento licitatorio, se le dio al
ajuste en cuestion. ... Tal sentido esta dado en que,

Consorcios que participaron en la Licitacién —

68. Pending the decision on appeal, in August of 2000 and
every 6 months thereafter, ENARGAS ordered MetroGAS to
maintain its tariffs at the approved rate for May of 2000.%°

69. On 5 October 2001, the Federal Court of Appeals
upheld the injunction against the application of the US PPI
adjustment mechanism.5?7 In reaching its decision, the
appellate court noted that “dollarized” tariffs protected the
licensees against exchange rate fluctuations.58 An appeal to
the Supreme Court was soon to be overtaken by other
measures adopted by Argentina in January of 2002. The
MetroGAS tariffs have therefore not been adjusted for
inflation since July of 1999.59

2. The Corralito

70. By the end of 2001 Argentina was heavily indebted and
with an economy in stagnation. Pegging the exchange rate at
one U. S. dollar per Argentine peso further made its exports
uncompetitive and it also effectively deprived the state of an
independent monetary policy. Fearing an economic crash and
a devaluation, many Argentines, especially companies, were
transforming pesos to dollars and withdrawing them from the
banks in large amounts, usually transferring them to foreign
accounts.

71. On | December 2001, the government enacted Decree
1570/01 in order to stop this process from further threatening
the banking system.® This Decree froze all bank accounts,
initially for 90 days. Only a small amount of cash was allowed
for withdrawal on a weekly basis, initially 250 pesos.

72. The corralito had a paradoxical effect. Attempts to
withdraw funds from the banks intensified and the cash
restrictions exacerbated the recession and angered the public.

ariffs of MetroGAS. However, the application of this decree was
suspended by judicial injunction. Further attempts to increase tariffs were

also blocked by injunctive measures adopted by Argentine courts
(Exhibits J-398 and J-401).

after violent riots, but the restrictions of the corralito were
not lifted at the time.

3. The Emergency Law and Ancillary

Regulations

73. On 6 January 2002, Argentina enacted the Emergency
Law.°! This Law declared a state of “emergency” for a limited
period of time originally due to expire on 10 December
2003,°2 but subsequently extended until 31 December 2004,°3
31 December 2005, 31 December 2006 and 31 December
2007.°°

74. Among other measures, the Emergency Law:

a) abolished the currency board established by the
Convertibility Law which had pegged the peso to
the dollar;®”

b) set aside dollar denominated adjustment
clauses;68

c) eliminated the US PPI adjustment mechanism by
prohibiting indexation clauses tied to
international price indices;®

d) converted dollar denominated tariffs into pesos at
the rate of one peso to one US dollar;7°

e) prohibited licensees from suspending or altering
the performance of their obligations;”! and

f) prescribed that the law would be applicable
irrespective of any “vested rights”.72

61. Exhibit J-287.

October 2003.

72. Article 19 (“La presente ley es de orden piiblico. Ninguna persona

75. The Emergency Law also authorized the Executive
Branch of government to “renegotiate” its agreements with
public service providers.” Originally conducted under the
auspices of the Comisién de Renegociacién de Contratos de
Obras y Servicios Piublicos which operated from February of
2002 until July of 2003,% the renegotiation process was
subsequently taken over by the Unidad de Renegociacién de
Contratos de Obras y Servicios Piiblicos or UNIREN.75

76. Article 11 of the Emergency Law and Decree 214/027
further (i) ordered that private dollar denominated
obligations be converted into pesos at a rate of one peso to
one dollar, and (ii) abolished indexation by reference to
international indicators. Decree 214/02 also established that
“pesified” obligations were to be adjusted by application of a
Coeficiente de Estabilizacién de Referencia or CER. Pursuant
to Decree 410/02, however, the “pesification” would not
apply to obligations governed by foreign law.””

77. During the arbitration, BG argued that these and other
measures adopted by Argentina after January of 2002 had a
discriminatory effect which adversely impacted its investment
in Argentina. Chapter VIII of this award shall address the
measures in question and their effect in the renegotiation
process.

4. The Renegotiation Process
78. The Comisién de Renegociacién de Contratos de

Obras y Servicios Piiblicos was created by Decree 293/02 of
14 February 2002 to assume responsibility over the

 

provision is in contrast with Decree 669/00 (Exhibit J-226) which had
earlier recognized that the licensees had a “derecho legitimamente
adquirido” to US PPI tariff adjustments.

73. Article 9 (“Autorizase al Poder Ejecutivo nacional a renegociar los
contratos comprendidos en lo dispuesto en el Articulo 8° de la presente
ley. En el caso de los contratos que tengan por objeto la prestacién de

criterios: 1) el impacto de las tarifas en la competitividad de la economia
y en la distribucién de los ingresos; 2) la calidad de los servicios y los
planes de inversion, cuando ellos estuviesen previstos contractualmente;
3) el interés de los usuarios y la accesibilidad de los servicios; 4) la
seguridad de los sistemas comprendidos; y 5) la rentabilidad de las
empresas.”)

renegotiation of public service contracts.78 Although this
Renegotiation Commission was unable to conclude its task
within the statutory term of 120 days, it did produce a report
dated 24 January 2003 which notes a sharp decline in the
economics of the MetroGAS operations:79

79. On 3 July 2003, the administration of President
Kirchner replaced the Comisién de Renegociacién de
Contratos de Obras y Servicios Puiblicos with UNIREN.®° On
21 October 2003, Congress enacted Law 25.790 governing the
renegotiation process.*! Article 2 of this Law 25,790 expressly
authorized UNIREN to depart from the existing Regulatory
Framework and licenses:

Las decisiones que adopte el Poder Ejecutivo
nacional en el desarrollo del proceso de
renegociacién no __se__hallardn__limitadas _o

dic das por las estipulaciones idas_en
los marcos regulatorios que rigen los contratos de
concesién_o licencia de los respectivos servicios
publicos.

[..]
[Emphasis added]

80. There is no dispute between the Parties that the stated
objective of the Emergency Law and the purpose of
subsequent legislation, including Law 25.790, was to establish
a new deal with the licensees. Return to the original legal
framework as presented by the Information Memorandum
and the Bidding Rules was accordingly not an alternative.8?
This was confirmed at the hearing by the Executive Secretary
of UNIREN, who testified that a return to dollar denominated
tariffs was not possible.83

81. Further, Article 11 of Resolution 308/02*4 and Article |
of Decree 1090/0285 expressly exclude from the renegotiation
process any licensee that sought redress in an arbitral or
other forum.

82. In the circumstances, five years’ failed to yield a
successful settlement of the dispute between the Parties.

IV. Summary of the Contentions of the Parties and

Relief Sought

83. The prayer for relief below is presented verbatim as
submitted by the Parties in their Post—Hearing Brief. Their
contentions are summarized here and subsequently analyzed
in more detail.

A. BG’s Position

84. Claimant argued that Argentina’s measures described
in Section III.D above have damaged MetroGAS:8?

In short, as a result of Argentina’s Measures,
MetroGAS's business is no longer viable. MetroGAS's
tariff revenue is no longer sufficient to cover its costs
and provide a reasonable rate of return, as promised
in the Regulatory Framework. Some three years after
the January 2002 Law was enacted, the absence of a
renegotiated Licence or material tariff increase means
that MetroGAS remains in a critical financial
condition and at the mercy of its creditors.

85. BG's case on the merits is that Argentina has breached
the following provisions of the Argentina-U.K. BIT:88

a) Article 5, by expropriating BG’s (i) shareholding in
GASA and MetroGAS and, alternatively, (ii) rights
under or related to the MetroGAS License; and

b) Article 2.2 (i) by failing to provide BG fair and
equitable treatment and protection and security,
(ii) by taking unreasonable and discriminatory
measures, (iii) by failing to observe obligations

entered into with regard to BG’s Investments, and
(iv) for acts of its judiciary.

BG requests that the Tribunal:

a)

b)

c)

d)

e)

B.

declare that the dispute is within the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal and that all of Argentina's
objections to the jurisdiction and competence of
the Tribunal and the admissibility of BG’ claims be
dismissed;

declare that Argentina breached Article 5(1) of the
[Argentina-U.K. BIT] by expropriating BG's
investment without compensation;

declare that Argentina breached Article 2(2) of the
[Argentina-U.K. BIT] by  mistreating BG's
investment in violation of the standards of
treatment provided therein;

order that Argentina compensate BG in an
amount of US$238.1 million plus interest at the
average interest rate applicable to US six-month
certificates of deposit, compounded  semi-
annually;

award BG any such additional relief as the
Tribunal considers appropriate; and

order that Argentina pay the costs of these
proceedings, including the Tribunal’s fees and
expenses, and the cost of BG's legal
representation, subject to interest.

Argentina’s Position

Argentina requests the following from the Tribunal:

a)

b)

Se declare la falta de competencia del Tribunal
respecto de la controversia planteada por la
Demandante, con costas a cargo de BG,
incluyendo todos los gastos del Tribunal y los
gastos incurridos por la Reptblica Argentina en
relacion con el presente arbitraje;

Subsidiariamente, se solicita se rechace en forma
total la demanda de BG Group plc, con costas.

30

88. Argentina’s defense on the merits is based on its
allegation that it has not breached the Argentina-U.K. BIT
and on the doctrine of state of necessity.

Vv. Applicable Law

89. Both Parties agree that the issue of the law applicable
to the dispute is addressed in Article 8(4) of the Argentina-
U.K. BIT.89 Article 8(4) of the BIT provides that:

The arbitral tribunal shall decide this dispute in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the
laws of the Contracting Party involved in this dispute,
including its rules on conflict of laws, the terms of any
specific agreement concluded in relation to such an
investment and the applicable principles of
international law.

90. This provision points to the application of the treaty
itself, Argentine law (including its rules on conflict of laws)
and “the applicable principles of international law”. The
Parties do not disagree that these are the relevant sources of
law under the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

9. It is undisputed that treaty law determines, for
example, who qualifies as an “Investor”?! as well as the
various types of property rights that constitute an
“Investment”.°? Equally clear and not subject to dispute by
the Parties is that the substantive standards for treatment of
investors are matters governed by the treaty, without any
need for reference to Argentine law.%3 Indeed, the

89. Alegato Final de la Repiiblica Argentina (“Alegato Final"), paragraph
107; Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 137.

90. See Alegato Final, paragraphs 117-21, in particular paragraph 117
(“...[E]s claro que el Tribunal no podria dejar de aplicar el derecho
interno argentino asi como tampoco podria dejar de aplicar el TBI 0 los
principios de derecho internacional que resulten aplicables.”). See also,
Post-Hearing Brief, paragraphs 137-40.

91. Argentina-U.K. BIT, Article 1(c)(i)(bb).

92. Argentina-U.K. BIT, Article I(a).

93. Respondent does not question that breach of the substantive
obligations set out in Articles 2.2 and 5 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT is
governed by the BIT. See, e.g., Alegato Final, paragraph 132 (“[I]a
Argentina sélo podré ser responsable internacionalmente si el Tribunal,
partiendo del andlisis de todas las fuentes de derecho aplicables,
comprueba que la conducta de la Argentina es incompatible con alguna
disposicién del TBI’). See also ibidem, paragraph 137. After pointing to
the prominent role played by Argentine law in defining the type of
property rights making up an “investment”, referring to E] Paso Energy
International Co. v. Republica Argentina (CIADI ARB.03/15/, Decis:

 

 

  

 

 

31

preeminence of the BIT as lex specialis governing this
dispute, on matters expressly covered by this bilateral treaty,
is expressly acknowledged by both Parties.°4

92. It is also beyond dispute that the contours of the
concept of “asset” included in the definition of “investment”
in Article l(a) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, is governed by
Argentine law.®> Article 1(a) of the BIT provides that:

“investment” means every kind of asset defined in
accordance with the laws and regulations of the

Contracting Party in whose territory the investment
ismade...

[Emphasis added]

 

sobre Jurisdiccién 27 April 2006), Argentina highlights the relevance of
ascertaining whether the investor's rights may have been illegally
restricted and whether such restriction may be imputed to Argentina for
having violated “the high standards” set forth in the BIT (“/ejn
conclusién: la Reptiblica Argentina considera que para determinar qué
derechos posee la Demandante, su existencia y extension, debe aplicarse:
© elderecho argentino, a efectos de determinar qué derechos
fueron adquiridos mediante la inversi
© una vez determinado esto, debe verse si ese derecho ha sido
ilegalmente restringido; y

 

e = por iiltimo, si tal restriccidn constituye ademds una violacion a
los altos estaéndares del TBI atribuible al Estado Argentino.”

94. See Alegato Final, paragraph 118 (‘[Ila primera fuente de derecho
contenida en el articulo 8.4 del TBI es el mismo tratado. Es claro que las
cuestiones reguladas por el Tratado son ley especial (lex specialis)
respecto del derecho internacional general . . .”; subsequently making the
point that the BIT is not a self-contained, stand-alone legal framework but
must be “integrated” with underlying principles of international law. BG’s
Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 140 (also contending that “. . . the conduct
of the host state [must be] examined on the basis of the substantive
standards of treatment set out in the treaty. Thus, the treaty as

d by general i ional law is the icable law in this

 

phase.”).
95. See Alegato Final, paragraph 124 (“Es decir, el derecho argentino es el
que determina cudles son los derechos adquiridos por la inversién (en
otras palabras: cudl es el contenido de la propiedad del inversor”); Post-
Hearing Brief, paragraphl40 (“[a]t the first stage, the tribunal must
decide, if it is a matter of contention, whether particular assets or rights
constituting the alleged investment exist, their scope and in whom they
vest. The law of the host state and/or the investment constitute an
investment as defined by the treaty’). Although Argentine private
international law is included within the bodies or sources of law
mentioned in Article 8(4) of the BIT, neither Party relied upon it, so the
matter under discussion here is the role played by Argentine substantive
municipal rules of law.

 

 

32

93. Where Claimant and Respondent disagree is on: (i)
whether the Argentina-U.K. BIT requires the Tribunal to
follow an order of priority in applying the sources of law set
out in Article 8(4) of the BIT; and (ii) whether Argentina's
alleged liability is exclusively a function of domestic law, as
argued by Respondent, or whether this issue falls squarely
under the terms of the BIT and underlying principles of
international law, as argued by the Claimant.

94. The Tribunal shall deal first, and only to the extent that
it is relevant to settle this dispute, with the interplay between
international and Argentine internal law under Article 8(4) of
the Argentina-U.K. BIT. Second, assuming that the terms of
the treaty and underlying principles of international law are
silent regarding the protection to foreign investors in a
situation of emergency, as propounded by Respondent, the
Tribunal shall discuss whether Argentine internal law may be
applied to fill the alleged gap.

95. It must be borne in mind that there is no contract
concluded between BG and the Republic of Argentina, and
that the dispute between the two focuses on the scope of
protection to which BG’s investment is entitled. Because this
is precisely the purpose of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, in
adjudicating its jurisdiction and, if need be, the substance of
this dispute, the Tribunal must rely on the terms of this
bilateral treaty as the primary source of law.

96. Regarding the remission in Article 8(4) of the BIT to
national and international law, the Parties seem to make
much of the issue whether international law and Argentine
law are to be deemed of equal rank, as proposed by
Respondent, or whether the latter ought to yield to the
former, as contended by Claimant.% In the opinion of the
Tribunal this focus is misplaced. In the first place, the
doctrinal and jurisprudential authorities brought to the
attention of the Tribunal fail to yield any collision or
contradiction between the protection to which Claimant's
property rights are entitled under Argentine constitutional
and administrative law and the protection it receives under
international law. If anything, the constitutional

96. See Alegato Final, paragraph 111, referring to Respondent's expert on
this issue, Professor Benedict Kingsbury, for the proposition that when the
treaty itself refers to the application of domestic law, such domestic law
holds equal rank with international law. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing
Brief, paragraphs 138 et seq., to the effect that under fundamental
principles of international law, the latter prevails over domestic law.

  

33

jurisprudence developed by the Supreme Court of Argentina
around Articles 14 and 17 of the Constitution points to the
protection of property rights lato sensu,®’ giving rise to a duty
to provide full compensation in cases where the State deems
it fit for reasons of public policy and regardless of whether an
emergency is invoked or not, to unilaterally terminate or
modify the terms of a deal concluded with a private party.98
Thus, the question of the hierarchy that one source of law
bears with regard to the other fades in relevance in this case,
where property rights would be fully protected under
Argentine domestic law in any event.

97. More importantly, the interplay between international
law and municipal law under Article 8(4) of the BIT should
not overlook that the former may be deemed incorporated
into the latter, depending on the status conferred to
international treaties and international law in general by a
particular constitutional system. This is particularly relevant
to the case of Argentina, whose constitutional framework and
doctrine have traditionally admitted the direct application of
international law whenever feasible and, at least since the
constitutional reform undertaken in 1994, expressly
providing for the principle that international treaties preempt
provincial and federal law.9? Accordingly, the challenge of
discerning the role that international law ought to play in the
settlement of this dispute, vis-a-vis domestic law, disappears
if one were to take into account that the BIT and underlying
principles of international law, as “the supreme law of the
land”, are incorporated into Argentine domestic law,
superseding conflicting domestic statutes.!00

98. In its Alegato Final, Respondent relied on the
unquestionable gravity of the crisis that exploded in
December 2001 to introduce the argument that the measures
allegedly affecting BG’s investment, which found support in

97. See, e.g., Exhibit JL-30 (Gregorio Guitiérrez v. Compania Hispano
Americana de Electricidad, 158 Fallos 268 (1930)), holding that the right
of property protected by Articles 14 and 17 of the Argentine Constitution
refers to all types of interest, tangible or intangible.

98. See, e.g., Exhibit J-14 (Compafiia de Tranvias Anglo Argentina v.
Nacién Argentina, 262 Fallos 555 (1965)), where the Supreme Court,
making clear that it was not passing judgment on the government's
sovereign power to adopt any economic policies it deems appropriate, yet
held the State liable for the unilateral modification of the terms of a
on contract insofar as it infringed on the conc i

the Emergency Law adopted in January 2002,'°! must be
regarded as a suitable response to the “extraordinary and
unforeseeable” magnitude of the crisis, fully justified under
the doctrine of “unforeseeable changed circumstances”
(teoria de la imprevisién) of Article 1198 of the Argentine
Civil Code.!0?

99. The Tribunal notes that Article 1198 relates to the law
of contracts and that the dispute between the Parties does not
arise out of contract. More specifically, Article 1198 of the
Argentine Civil Code does not apply in the context of an
international investment dispute governed by Article 8(4) of
the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

100. Although the Tribunal finds that the BIT is the primary
source of rules to assess Respondent's liability, the bilateral
investment treaty is not a self-contained legal framework,
isolated from international and domestic law. Yet, the
domestic law defense of unforeseen changed circumstances is
of little assistance to Respondent here. The process for the
privatization of Gas del Estado and the resulting Regulatory
Framework clearly demonstrate a concern for economic and
currency instability, a systemic and hardly unpredictable
occurrence in Argentina’s modern history.

101. See supra, paragraphs 53 to 62, where this award discusses and
acknowledges the extraordinary gravity of the Argentine cri leading to
the adoption of the Emergency Law and ancillary measures.

102. Article 1198, in its current version, was enacted in 1968,
incorporating for the first time the “teoria de la imprevisidn” (or doctrine
of unforeseen changed circumstances). Article 1198 provides that:

“Los contratos deben celebrarse, interpretarse y ejecutarse de

buena fe y de acuerdo con lo que verosimilmente las partes

entendieron o pudieron entender, obrando con cuidado y

prevision.

En los contratos : sy en los unil :
sos y ivos de ejecucién diferida o continuada, si la
prestaciin a cargo de una de las partes se tornara
excesivamente onerosa, por acontecimientos extraordinarios e
imprevisibles, la parte perjudicada podrad demandar la
resolucién del contrato. El mismo principio se aplicara a los
contratos aleatorios cuando la excesiva onerosidad se produzca
por causas extrafias al riesgo propio del contrato.

En los contratos de ejecucién continuada la resolucién no
alcanzaré a los efectos ya cumplidos.

No procederd la resolucin, si el perjudicado hubiese obrado con
culpa o estuviese en mora.

La otra parte podré impedir la resolucién ofreciendo mejorar
equitativamente los efectos del contrato.”

 

 

 

 

35

101. The rejection of the concept of rebus sic stantibus
under the Argentine Civil Code is not a dismissal of
Argentina’s defense under the international law doctrine of
state of necessity. The Tribunal will address this question in
Chapter IX of the award.

102. In brief, the Tribunal shall apply:

a) the Argentina-U.K. BIT with respect to the
jurisdictional objections raised by Argentina
under the treaty itself;

b) to the extent that jurisdiction is affirmed,
Argentine law to the determination of the concept
of “asset” in Article I(a) of the Argentina-U.K.
BIT;

c) to the extent that jurisdiction is affirmed, the
Argentina-U.K. BIT and such other relevant
principles of international law as may have been
relied upon by the Parties.

103. In addition, the Tribunal will be mindful of the
Argentine Regulatory Framework for the transportation and
distribution of natural gas, as it was presented to foreign
investors at the time of the privatization of Gas del Estado
and as subsequently modified by Argentina.

VI. Jurisdiction and Admissibility

104. Argentina raised objections to the jurisdiction of this
Tribunal and to the admissibility of BG’s claims.

105. The Tribunal will address Argentina’s objections in the
following order:

a) Is BGan “Investor”?

b) Has BG made an “Investment” in Argentina?
c) Are BG’s claims admissible?

d) Is the dispute contractual?

e) May BG bring “derivative claims”?

f) Are measures of general application actionable
under the Argentina-U.K. BIT?

36

g) Is the renegotiation process an obstacle to this
Tribunal’s jurisdiction?

106. Respondent's allegation that Argentine courts have
exclusive jurisdiction over this dispute is related with
questions (d) and (e) above, and it will be adjudicated in
Section E below.

A. Is BG an “Investor”?

107. BG relies on Section 1(c)(i)(bb) of the definition of
“Investor” in the Argentina-U.K. BIT:

“investor” means:

(i) in respect of the United Kingdom:

(bb) companies, corporations, firms and
associations incorporated or constituted under
the law in force in any part of the United
Kingdom or in any territory to which this
Agreement is extended in accordance with the
provisions of Article 12.

108. It is not disputed that BG is a company incorporated
and constituted under the laws in force in the United
Kingdom. A copy of BG's Certificate of Incorporation,
Memorandum and Articles of Association are on the
record.!03

109. BG therefore qualifies as an “Investor” under the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

110. The Tribunal now turns to the question of whether BG
made an “Investment” in Argentina within the terms of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

B. Has BG Made an “Investment” in
Argentina?

lll. Article 1 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT includes the
following definition of “Investment”:

(a) “investment” means every kind of asset defined
in accordance with the laws and regulations of
the Contracting Party in whose territory the

103. Exhibit J-188.

37

investment is made and admitted in accordance
with this Agreement and in particular, though
not exclusively, includes:

(i) movable and immovable property and any
other property rights such as mortgages,
liens or pledges;

(ii) shares in and stock and debentures of a
company and any other form of
participation in a company, established in
the territory of either of the Contracting
Parties;

(iii) claims to money which are directly related
to a specific investment or to any
performance under contract having a
financial value;

(iv) intellectual property rights, goodwill,
technical processes and know-how;

v

business concessions conferred by law or
under contract, including concessions to
search for, cultivate, extract or exploit
natural resources.

A change in the form in which assets are invested
does not affect their character as investments. The
term “investment” includes all investments, whether
made before or after the date of entry into force of
this Agreement, but the provisions of this Agreement
shall not apply to any dispute concerning an
investment which arose, or any claim concerning an
investment which was settled, before its entry into
force;

(b) “returns” means the amounts yielded by an
investment and in particular, though not
exclusively, includes profit, interest, capital
gains, dividends, royalties and fees.

112. BG contends that it holds the following “Investments”
in Argentina:

38

a) an indirect participation in the Argentine
companies MetroGAS (45.11%)!®4 and GASA
(54.67%);!0

[Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT]

b) the following rights over the economic value of the
License, !96

(i) claims to money and performance under
contracts entered into by MetroGAS, and

(ii) benefits from the License granted to
MetroGAS to carry out gas distribution
services in Argentina;

[Article 1(a)(iii) and (v) of the BIT]
c) rights that the MetroGAS License be respected.!0
[Article 1(a)(v) of the BIT]

113. Initially, Argentina argued that BG had not provided
sufficient evidence of its ownership interest in GASA and
MetroGAS.'!08 In response, BG _ provided additional
explanation and evidence of this participation.'°? Testimony
at the hearing further established that BG’s interest in GASA
and MetroGAS is no longer contested.!!° Additionally,
Argentina has not subsequently denied that BG’s ownership
interest in GASA and MetroGAS are an “Investment” within
the meaning of Article 1(a)(ii) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT. On
the contrary, Argentina’s Alegato Final acknowledged that “. .

114. Argentina does, however, argue that shareholders may
only bring claims with respect to measures taken by
Argentina that directly interfere with their corporate rights.
The thread of this argument runs across a number of
Argentina’s jurisdictional objections and the Tribunal believes
that it is best addressed when it turns to the issue of
“derivative claims” in Section E.

115. For now, the Tribunal will focus on whether the rights
identified in Paragraphs 112(b) and (c) above constitute an
“Investment” for purposes of the Argentina-U.K. BIT. A
determination on this point requires consideration of
Argentina’s contentions that:

a) the definition of “Investment” in the BIT requires
that the term “asset” be defined by reference to “. .
. the laws and regulations of the Contracting
Party in whose territory the investment is made”;
and

b) the Spanish version of the BIT (titulos de crédito)
prevails with respect to the meaning of the term
“claims to money” in Article 1(a)(iii).!!2

1. “Asset” or “Activo”

116. Argentina relied heavily on the reference in Article 1(a)
of the BIT to “.. . the laws and regulations of the Contracting
Party in whose territory the investment is made”. More
specifically, Argentina asserts that:

a) the term “asset” in Article l(a) of the BIT should
be defined by reference to the laws of Argentina;

b) the Spanish version of the treaty (“. . . el término
‘inversion’ designa todo elemento del activo . . .”)
requires construing the term “activo” as it is
understood in generally accepted accounting
principles; and

c) because MetroGAS has not included the
MetroGAS License as an “activo” in its
accounting, rights under the License are not an
asset under the definition of “Investment” of the
BIT.

112. The term used in the Spanish version of the BIT is “titulos de crédito".

40

117. As to the first point, BG conceded that Argentine law
governs the issue of “. . . whether a particular asset exists
and in whom it vests.”''3 The Tribunal agrees with both
Parties: the renvoi of Article 1(a) of the treaty requires this
Tribunal to apply the laws of Argentina to the interpretation
of this part of the definition of “Investment” in the Argentina-
U.K. BIT. As a matter of conventional international law, this
demarche is necessary to determine whether rights associated
with the MetroGAS License are protected under the BIT.

118. A first conclusion emerges from Argentine law. The
existence of the MetroGAS License and certain rights
associated with it is unquestionable. The Regulatory
Framework presented to international investors in order to
promote interest in the privatization of Gas del Estado is
determinative of this issue. This is not a finding as to the
precise content of those rights, or as to BG’s ius standi to
exercise them — the award will deal with this issue later - but
merely as to whether those assets were in existence as a
matter of Argentine law. Argentina has taken a position with
respect to the content, ownership and survival of those rights,
but it has not denied their existence.!!4

 

119. The next question is whether Claimant’s rights under
the Regulatory Framework described in Chapter III.B of this
award, including the MetroGAS License, constitute an
“activo” pursuant to the definition of “Investment” in the
Spanish version of the BIT, or an “asset” as set out in Article
1(a) of the English language version of the treaty.

120. Neither Party offered a definition of “activo”!'5 under
any Argentine law of general application. In the absence of a
statutory definition, the Tribunal must turn to the
interpretive work of the courts.

113. “Responses to the Questions of the Arbitral Tribunal of 10 July 2006”,

p.3.

114. For this reason alone, Respondent's reliance on Exhibit JL-490

(Encana Corporation v. The Republic of Ecuador, Award of 3 February

2006) is misplaced . This matter is inapposite to this case.

115. At the hearing, BG asserted that “activo” under Argentine law means
. todo derecho, sea de cardcter real o personal susceptible de valor

patrimonial.” It did not, however, provide any legal cite as the source of

ince to the Tribunal’s

to the Questions of the

 

 
 

Arbitral Tribunal of 10 July 2006”, p. 3).

41

121. In Industria Mecdnica S.A. v. Gas del Estado
CUndustria Mecdnica) the court took an ample patrimonial
view of the constitutional protection of property rights:!!°

[Sleguin la jurisprudencia de esta Corte, el término
propiedad empleado en los articulos 14 y 17 de la
Constitucién Nacional ampara todo el_patrimonio
incluyendo derechos reales y personales, bienes
materiales e inmateriales, [. . .] y en general todos
los intereses apreciables que un hombre pueda
poseer fuera de si mismo, su vida y libertad, entre
ellos los derechos emergentes de los contratos.

[Emphasis added]

122. Almost 20 years earlier, in Compania de Tranvias
Anglo Argentina v. Nacién Argentina (Compafiia de
Tranvias), in a situation where certain measures had
disturbed the economics of a concession, the Supreme Court
focused on damage to the investor's patrimony as a whole:!”

[las] normas tuvieron por consecuencia determinar
mayores erogaciones para el concesionario; lo cual
justificaba indemnizacién 0 aumento de tarifas. No
debe olvidarse . . . que quien asi legislaba era a su
vez poder concedente y como tal, tenia la obligacién
de respetar la economia general del contrato, es
decir su ecuacion econémico financiera.

123. The property rights protected by the courts in
Argentina are not limited to assets registered for accounting
purposes, as the Spanish term “activo” might suggest. This
conclusion is not altered by Argentina’s reliance on the
contractual definition of “Activos Afectados al Servicio” and
“Activos Esenciales” set out in Section 1.1 of the Share
Transfer Agreement.!'8 First, this contract does not trump the
broader notion of property embraced by Compafiia de
Tranvias and Industria Mecdnica S.A. Second, the Share
Transfer Agreement itself acknowledges that transfer of the
physical assets did not entitle MetroGAS to engage in the
distribution of gas, as the holding of a license is mandatorily
required for that purpose.!!9

116, Exhibit JL-154, pp. 859-860.

117. Exhibit J-14.

118, Exhibit J-115.

119. For instance, clauses 4.3(g), 4.4(d) and 6.1(i) (Exhibit J-115).

42

124. While Argentina was critical of reliance on the
Tranvias case in a different context,!2° its criticism confirms
the need to focus on property rights. For instance, in its
Alegato Final Respondent argued that Argentina’s offer to
renegotiate constitutes an acknowledgement of the investor's
property rights.!2) Recognition of these rights was not
contingent on their registration as an “activo” in the books of
MetroGAS.

125. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal finds no
support for the contention that property rights are an “asset”
only to the extent that they are listed as an “activo” for
accounting purposes in a company’s books. There is no
question that MetroGAS received, in terms of value,
something more than the physical assets inventoried in the
Share Transfer Agreement. MetroGAS was granted a license
and other statutory rights without which the physical assets
could not have been put to use. In fact, the MetroGAS License
was to enter into force on the very same day as the transfer of
the physical assets.!22

126. Interpreted in the light of Argentine jurisprudence, the
term “activo” in Article 1(a) of the Spanish language
Argentina-U.K. BIT is not semantically different from the
concept of “asset” employed in the English version. Thus
construed, both terms are broader than the accounting
reading advocated by Argentina and hereby rejected by the
Tribunal.

127. The Tribunal consequently finds that the rights
conferred under the Regulatory Framework described in
Chapter III.B of this award, including under the MetroGAS
License, come under the term “activo” and “asset” in the
definition of “Investment” set out in Article I(a) of
respectively the Spanish and English versions of the BIT.

120. Paragraphs 159 to 167 of the Alegato Final set out Argentina's
position with respect to this case in the context of its allegations of force
majeure and imprevision under Argentine law.

121. “No hay afectacion sustancial del derecho de propiedad en la medida
que existe un reconocimiento de ese derecho a través del proceso de
renegociacion, y una voluntad de Argentina de readecuar el contrato . .
.” (Alegato Final, paragraph 166(d)).

122. Clause 4.2.2 of the Share Transfer Agreement (Exhibit J-115).

43

2. “Claims to Money” — “Titulos de
Crédito”

128. Argentina also pointed to a discrepancy between the
two authentic language versions of Article 1(a)(iii) of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.!23

 

Spanish Version English Version

 

(iii) titulos de crédito (iii) claims to money which are
directamente relacionados con | directly related to a_ specific
una inversion especifica y todo | investment or to any
otro derecho a una prestaci6n | performance under contract
contractual que tenga un valor | having a financial value.

financiero.

 

 

 

 

 

129. Respondent conceded that the laws and regulations of
Argentina do not provide a definition of titulo de crédito.'4
Argentina, nonetheless, drew the Tribunal’s attention to the
narrow legal meaning of the term according to many legal
scholars:!25
. .. el documento escrito, firmado, nominativo, a la
orden o al portador, que menciona la promesa
unilateral de pago de una suma de dinero o de una
cantidad de mercaderia, con _ vencimiento
determinado o determinable; o de consignacién de
mercaderias o de titulos especificados y que
socialmente sea considerado como destinado a la
circulacion.

130. For Argentina, Article 1(a)(iii) of the BIT only extends
protection to investors where their “Investment” takes the
form of a “titulo de crédito” (i.e., a “negotiable instrument”).
Conversely, BG believes that the English term “claims to
money” is broader in scope and includes claims to money
under contracts entered into by MetroGAS. Simply put, the
divergence of the Spanish “titulo de crédito” and the English
“claims to money” is semantically irreconcilable.

131. The Tribunal’s analysis therefore begins with Article 33
of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the Vienna

Convention), which specifically addresses the interpretation
of multilingual treaties:!26

1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or
more languages, the text is equally authoritative in
each language, unless the treaty provides or the
parties agree that, in case of divergence, a particular
text shall prevail.

2. A version of the treaty in a language other than
one of those in which the text was authenticated shall
be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so
provides or the parties so agree.

3. The terms of a treaty are presumed to have the
same meaning in each authentic text.

4. Except where a particular text prevails in
accordance with paragraph 1, when a comparison of
the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning
which the application of Articles 31 and 32 does not
remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts,
having regard to the object and purpose of the treaty,
shall be adopted.

132. The presumption of Paragraph 3 is rebuttable where,
like here, the difference in meaning is not removed by
reference to Articles 31!27 and 32.!28 Paragraph 3 of Article 33

133. The United Kingdom and Argentina introduced their
BIT with the following paragraphs:

The Government of the United Kingdom of Great
Britain and Northern Ireland and the Government of
the Republic of Argentina;

Desiring to create favourable conditions for greater
investment by investors of one State in the territory of
the other State;

Recognising that the encouragement and reciprocal
protection under international agreement of such
investments will be conducive to the stimulation of
individual business initiative and will increase
prosperity in both States;

Have agreed as follows . . .

134. Adoption of the Spanish term of the BIT as advocated
by Argentina would considerably restrict the coverage of the
treaty, discourage “greater investment” and defeat the shared
aspiration expressed by Argentina and the U.K. in executing
this instrument in 1993.

135. The Tribunal is also persuaded by Argentina’s
expression of its own understanding of the treaty prior to this
dispute. As recalled earlier, Decree 669/00 expressly
acknowledges that investors in the privatization of Gas del
Estado would be entitled to protection under “. . . Tratados de
Proteccién Reciproca de Inversiones . . .” entered into by
Argentina.'29 It was clear at the time that BG’s investment in
MetroGAS would not take the form of “titulos de crédito” as
this term is now understood by Argentina.

136. Likewise, Resolution 308/02!3° and Decree 1090/02!3!

of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from

interpretation according to Article 31:
a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or
b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.”

arbitration. It is difficult to understand why Respondent
would seek to prohibit investment arbitration, if the
underlying rights sought to be enforced do not qualify as an
“Investment”, as now argued by Argentina.

137. For these reasons, the Tribunal adopts the English text
of Article 1(a)(iii) of the Argentina-U.K. BIT for purposes of
this award.!32

3. Conclusion

138. The Tribunal finds that BG’s ownership interest as
described in Paragraph 112(a) of this award is an
“Investment” for the purposes of Article 1(a)(ii) of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

139. The Tribunal also finds that “claims to money which
are directly related to a specific investment or to any
performance under contract having a financial value”
squarely fall within the definition of “Investment” of the BIT.
Nonetheless, as noted in Paragraph 118, the survival and
precise content of those rights, and BG’s standing to exercise
them, will be taken up by the Tribunal in Sections D and E
below.

Cc. Are BG’s Claims Admissible?

140. The Argentina-U.K. BIT provides that recourse to
arbitration is possible only where disputes have been
submitted for 18 months to the competent tribunal of the
State which hosts the investment and: (i) the tribunal has not
issued a final decision; or (ii) the parties are still in dispute
after the decision. To recall, the text of Article 8(1) and (2)
provides:

(1) Disputes with regard to an investment which
arise within the terms of this Agreement between an
investor of one Contracting Party and the other
Contracting Party, which have not been amicably
settled shall be submitted, at the request of one of the
Parties to the dispute, to the decision of the competent
tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose territory
the investment was made.

132. Conventional international law provides further confirmation of this
finding. “Claims to money” are an “investment” pursuant to Article 1(6)(c)
of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). The ECT translation of the term into
Spanish is “créditos pecuniarios”.

 

47

(2) The aforementioned disputes shall be submitted
to international arbitration in the following cases:
(a) _ if one of the Parties so requests, in any of
the following circumstances:

(i) where, after a period of eighteen
months has elapsed from the
moment when the dispute was
submitted to the competent tribunal
of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the investment was made,
the said tribunal has not given its
final decision;

(ii) where the final decision of the
aforementioned tribunal has been
made but the Parties are still in
dispute;

(b) where the Contracting Party and the
investor of the other Contracting Party
have so agreed.

141. Argentina argued that failure by BG to bring its
grievance to Argentine courts for 18 months renders its
claims in this arbitration inadmissible. It is to be noted that
Article 8(1) of the BIT entitles Argentina to trigger domestic
litigation of treaty disputes,!33 and there is no evidence on the
record that Argentina even attempted to do so.

142. BG argued that this requirement is senseless as there is
no chance that in a case of this nature a decision could ever be
rendered within the eighteen-month period. BG further
contended that the MEN clause of the Argentina-U.K. BIT34
entitles BG to rely on the more favorable treatment extended
by Argentina to US investors. The Argentina-U.S. Bilateral
Investment Treaty does not require prior recourse to local
courts for a period of 18 months. Finally, BG relied on the
customary international law rule that the requirement of

133. Article 8 provides that investment disputes under the BIT shall be
submitted “. . . at the request of one of the Parties to the dispute, to the
decision of the competent tribunal of the Contracting Party in whose
territory the investment was made.”

134. Article 3: “(1) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject
investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting Party to
treatment less favourable than that which it accords to investments or
returns of its own investors or to investments or returns of investors of
any third State. (2) Neither Contracting Party shall in its territory subject
investors of the other Contracting Party, regards their management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or dis of their investments, to
treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its own investors
or to investors of any third State.”

 

  

48

exhaustion of local remedies may be disregarded in cases
where “. . . the course of justice is unduly slow or unduly
expensive in relation to the prospective compensation.” !35

143. Customary international law becomes relevant, but
only as a point of departure for the Tribunal’s analysis of the
evolution of international investment law. Under traditional
international law, mistreated investors did not have standing
to sue the host State of their investment. Instead, they had to
rely on their home State’s willingness to espouse their claim
by offering diplomatic protection. Diplomatic protection, in
turn, would only give rise to international proceedings if local
remedies were exhausted.'3°

144. Exhaustion of local remedies, however, is not an
absolute bar to international adjudication. Article 15 of the
International Law Commission Draft Articles on Diplomatic
Protection attempts to codify the exceptions:

Local remedies do not need to be exhausted where: (a)
there are no reasonably available local remedies to
provide effective redress, or the local remedies
provide no reasonable possibility of such redress; (b)
there is undue delay in the remedial process which is
attributable to the State alleged to be responsible; (c)
there was no relevant connection between the injured
person and the State alleged to be responsible at the
date of injury; (d) the injured person is manifestly
precluded from pursuing local remedies; or (e) the
State alleged to be responsible has waived the
requirement that local remedies be exhausted.

145. The proliferation of bilateral investment treaties has
effected a profound transformation of international
investment law. Most significantly, under these instruments
investors are entitled to seek enforcement of their treaty
rights by directly bringing action against the State in whose
territory they have invested. Investors may seek redress in
arbitration without securing espousal of their claim or
diplomatic protection. The Argentina-U.K. BIT is a paradigm
of this evolution.

135. “State Responsibility’, Report by Robert Ago, ILC Special
Rapporteur, Yearbook of the ILC 1977, vol. II (Part Two, page 48,
paragraph 50, footnote 204). Quoted by BG with approval in its Post-
Hearing Brief, paragraph 185 (emphasis omitted).

136. The rule i: . an important principle of customary international
law .. .”. Exhibit JL-195 (Case Concerning the Elettronica Sicula S.p.A.
(United States of America v Italy), Judgment of20 July 1989, ICJ Reports
1989, E.L.S.L).

 

 

 

49

146. For the reasons mentioned above, BG's reliance on the
exceptions to the customary international law rule of
exhaustion of local remedies in this matter is difficult to
accept. The Tribunal accepts Argentina’s position that as a
matter of treaty law investors acting under the Argentina-
U.K. BIT must litigate in the host State’s courts for 18 months
before they can bring their claims to arbitration.

147. As a matter of treaty interpretation, however, Article
8(2)(a)(i) cannot be construed as an absolute impediment to
arbitration. Where recourse to the domestic judiciary is
unilaterally prevented or hindered by the host State, any such
interpretation would lead to the kind of absurd and
unreasonable result proscribed by Article 32 of the Vienna
Convention, allowing the State to unilaterally elude
arbitration, which has been the engine of the transition from
a politicized system of diplomatic protection to one of direct
investor-State adjudication.

148. In this case, the regular operation of the courts in
Argentina came under significant pressure after promulgation
of the Emergency Law. Concerned with judicial decisions
which might undermine the full implementation of
emergency legislation, the administration of President
Duhalde enacted Decree 214/02,'37 whose purpose was to bar
recourse to the courts by those whose rights were felt to be
violated:

... la preservaci6n de la paz social como el necesario
reordenamiento de las relaciones juridicas, no se
compadece con la masiva concurrencia a_ los
tribunales de quienes procuran la resolucién de sus
pretensiones, cuando ellas son de imposible
satisfacci6én, sin causar dafio irreparable a la
economia y al derecho de todos aquellos que no
podrian ver satisfechos sus propios derechos de
propiedad, de producirse el colapso final del sistema
financiero.

149. As a matter of policy, Decree 214/02 provided for a
stay of all suits brought by those whose rights were allegedly
affected by the emergency measures adopted by the
government:
. corresponde disponer la suspension temporaria
de la tramitacién de todos los procesos judiciales y
medidas cautelares y ejecutorias en los que se

137. Exhibit J-292.

demande o accione en razon de los créditos, deudas,
bligaciones, deposi 0 reprogr iones

 

E
financieras que pudieran considerarse afectados por
las normas y disposiciones dictadas en el marco de
la crisis y la emergencia.

150. Article 12 is the operative provision which implements
the stated policy objective:

. se suspende por el plazo de . . . (180) dias el
cumplimiento de las medidas cautelares en todos los
procesos judiciales, en los que se demande o accione
contra el Estado Nacional y/o las entidades
integrantes del sistema financiero, en razén de los
créditos, deudas,  obligaciones, depésitos 0
reprogramaciones  financieras que _—__pudieran
considerarse afectados por las _ disposiciones
contenidas en el Decreto N° 1570/01, en la [Ley de
Emergencia], en el Decreto N° 71/02, en el presente
decreto, en el Decreto N° 260/02, en las
Resoluciones del MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA y en
las Circulares y demds disposiciones del BANCO
CENTRAL DE LA REPUBLICA ARGENTINA
dictadas en consecuencia y toda otra disposicién
referida a dicha normativa.

Por el mismo lapso se suspende la ejecucién de las
sentencias dictadas con fundamento en dichas
normas contra el Estado Nacional, los Estados
Provinciales, los  Municipios o la CIUDAD
AUTONOMA DE BUENOS AIRES, sus entidades
autdrquicas o descentralizadas 0 empresas o entes
estatales, en todos los procesos judiciales referidos a
dicha normativa.

151. The Tribunal notes that the Emergency Law remains in
full force five years after its promulgation in 2002, and there
is no indication on the record that its enforcement has been
attenuated since its original promulgation.!38

152. Decree 320/02!39 provides further insight into the
intervention of the Executive Branch of government to
prevent judicial adjudication and enforcement of property
rights after the adoption of the Emergency Law. The
introductory paragraphs of this decree, signed by President
Duhalde on 15 February 2002, recall the State’s authority to

138. Law 26,204 extended the application of the Emergency Law until 31
December 2007 (Exhibit J-740).

51

restrict the regular exercise of patrimonial rights,'4° and
underscore that the policy objectives of the Emergency Law
and its regulations may be defeated by unfettered judicial
challenge.'4!

153. It is not within the province of this Tribunal to pass
judgment on the policy reasons prompting promulgation of
Decrees 214/02 and 320/02, nor to question the sovereign
prerogative in their adoption. However, it seems fitting to
examine the reasonableness of the expectation that judicial
remedies should have been exhausted at a time where the
Executive Branch was seeking to prevent any judicial
interference with the emergency legislation.

154. Later, in June and August of 2002, Argentina provided
in Resolution 308/02'42 and Decree 1090/02'43 that any
licensee seeking judicial redress would be excluded from the
renegotiation process of its license. The relevant provisions in
fact create an incentive for licensees not to go to the courts:

Article | of Decree 1090/02

Los concesionarios que efectuaren reclamos por
incumplimiento contractual fuera del proceso de
renegociacién . . . quedardn automdticamente
excluidos de dicho proceso.

Article 11 of Resolution 308/02

Las empresas concesionarias o licenciatarias que
mientras se desarrolle el proceso de renegociacién
en curso, efectuaren una presentaciébn en sede
judicial o ante un tribunal arbitral, articulada sobre
el presunto incumplimiento contractual fundado en
las normas dictadas en razén de la emergencia,
serdn intimadas por el MINISTERIO. DE
ECONOMIA, como Autoridad de Aplicacién del
régimen dispuesto por el Decreto 293/02, a desistir
de tal accién, bajo apercibimiento de que si no lo
hicieran, se instardn los actos para disponer su
exclusion de dicho proceso.

140. The eleventh Considerando of Decree 320/2002 (Exhibit J-298)
relies on the Supreme Court precedent that extraordinary circumstances
authorize the State to “. . . restringir el ejercicio normal de algunos
derechos patrimoniales tutelados por la Constitucion .

141. This is the legislative intent expressed in the Considerandos of Decree
320/02 (Exhibit J-298).

142. Exhibit J-347.

143. Exhibit J-334.

 

 

 

52

155. Argentina took the position in this arbitration that, had
BG brought its grievance to domestic courts, Argentina would
have collaborated to promote achievement of a prompt final
judgment.'*4 The Tribunal must assume this to be true under
normal circumstances. However, the Tribunal is also
persuaded that under the dire circumstances surrounding the
emergency measures, the Executive Branch sought to prevent
the collapse of the financial system by (i) directly interfering
with the normal operation of its courts, and (ii) by excluding
litigious licensees from the renegotiation process.

156. The Tribunal has given due consideration to Minister
Rosatti’s opinion that it would take Argentine courts more
than six years to reach a decision in a case like this.'45 Yet, this
opinion is not central to the Tribunal’s finding on this issue.
Rather, the Tribunal notes that a serious problem would loom
if admissibility of Claimant’s claims were denied thus
allowing Respondent at the same time to:

a) restrict the effectiveness of domestic judicial
remedies as a means to achieve the full
implementation of the Emergency Law and its
regulations;

b) insist that Claimant go to domestic courts to
challenge the very same measures; and

c) exclude from the renegotiation process any
licensee that does bring its grievance to local
courts.

157. The Tribunal consequently finds admissible the claims
brought by BG in this arbitration, thus rendering unnecessary
the examination of the relevance of Article 3 of the BIT (Most
Favored Nation) to determine whether Claimant should have
sought relief by the courts of Argentina during at least a
period of 18 months before resorting to arbitration.

D. Is the Dispute Contractual?

158. Article 8(2) of the BIT provides for arbitration of
certain investment disputes. Argentina argued that:!46

144, Alegato Final, paragraph 234.

145. Exhibit J-439.

146. Memorial sobre Excepcién de Incompetencia del Tribunal Arbitral,

53

a) Argentina did not assume any commitment with
respect to BG;!47

b) the dispute submitted to arbitration by BG is not a
“dispute with regard to an investment” within the
terms of the treaty;

c) BG's claim is contractual in nature; and

d) a claim for expropriation requires “something
more” than a breach of contract.

159. The Tribunal’s focus for the moment concerns
jurisdiction only and thus Argentina’s claim that there has
been no expropriation will be addressed below in Chapter VII.
Argentina’s other objections fall into one of two categories:
the existence or not of specific commitments (paragraph
158(a) above) and the nature of BG’s claim (paragraph 158(b)
and (c) supra). The Tribunal now takes up these issues
seriatim.

1. Specific Commitments

160. The privatization of the gas industry in Argentina
during the 1989-1992 period and the ensuing Regulatory
Framework were described earlier in Chapter III of this
award. This Section of the award examines the
representations directly or indirectly made by Argentina
during that process.

161. As mentioned, the concept of Gas del Estado's
privatization originated in Law 23696 of 17 August 1989.
Shortly thereafter, on 11 December 1990, Argentina and the
United Kingdom executed their BIT.

162. As indicated earlier, under the Gas Law enacted on 20
May 1992 tariffs were to be “just and reasonable”.'48 While
the Gas Law is silent as to the currency for the calculation or
expression of the tariffs, it does provide that:

a) prudent and efficient gas distributors would
collect “. . . ingresos suficientes para satisfacer
todos los costos operativos razonables .

147. Alegato Final, paragraph 247.
148. Article 2(d).

tariffs must be such that they provide for
“rentabilidad — razonable” (i.e., a return
commensurate to the return of other activities of
equal or comparable risk);!5°

tariffs would be adjusted by reference to
international market indicators;!5! and

tariffs would be subject to review every five
years,'52 or on an extraordinary basis.!%3

163. The Bidding Rules, the Gas Decree and the MetroGAS
License are more explicit about the currency for the
calculation and expression of the tariffs.

164. Section 7.1 of Annex F of the Bidding Rules of 20 July

1992 provides that:!54

165.

Las tarifas estén expresadas en pesos convertibles
seguin la Ley 23,928 a la paridad de | = 1 con el délar
estadounidense. Las mismas . . . serdn ajustadas
inmediata y automdticamente en caso de variacién
de la paridad. A estos efectos se considerard la
cantidad de moneda argentina necesaria para
adquirir un dolar estadounidense en la plaza de
Nueva York.

Section 7.5 of the Bidding Rules permits tariff

adjustment for inflation in accordance with US PPI:

La tarifa del Distribuidor . . . y la tarifa de
transporte .. . serdn [ajustadas] semestralmente .. .
de acuerdo con la variacién operada en el indice de

150. Article 39.
151. Article 41.
152. Article 42.

153. Upon the request of the service provider (Article 46), or ex officio by

ENARGAS (Article 47).
154, Exhibit J-100.

55

166. The Gas Decree of 18 September 1992 establishes that
the US dollar is the currency for the calculation of
transportation and distribution tariffs.

En la adecuaci6n normal y periddica de la tarifas
que autorice, [ENARGAS] se ajustard a los siguientes
lineamientos:

(1) Las tarifas de Transporte y Distribucién se
calcularén en Délares.'° El Cuadro Tarifario
resultante serd expresado en pesos convertibles
seguin la Ley No. 23,928,'*© teniendo en cuenta para
su reconversion a pesos la paridad establecida en el
Articulo 3 del Decreto No. 2.128/91.!*"

167. Further, Article 41(3) of the Gas Decree requires
inclusion in the respective licenses of a tariff adjustment
methodology based on international market indicators.

168. Article 42 of the Gas Decree mandates ENARGAS to
issue rules applicable to the review of tariffs every five years.
The Gas Decree offers the following guidance to the regulator:

(....) La revision global del método empleado para
el cdlculo de las tarifas . . . se mantendrd por un
nuevo periodo de Cinco (5) afios contados a partir de
su vigencia, procurando observar los principios de
estabilidad, coherencia y previsibilidad tanto para
los Consumidores como para los Prestadores.

[ENARGAS] estableceraé las normas de
procedimiento para la revisién del método empleado
en el cdlculo de las tarifas que asegure la
participacion de los sujetos de la Ley. (....)

169. Article 46 of the Gas Decree applies to the
extraordinary review of tariffs:

[ENARGAS] deberd establecer los requisitos que
deberdn cumplir los Transportistas, Distribuidores 0
consumidores en sus solicitudes de modificacién de
Tarifas o del Reglamento del Servicio a fin de
acreditar la necesidad de tales modificaciones.

155. Article 1(1) of the Gas Decree defines “Délar”
curso legal en los Estados Unidos de América’.
156. The Convertibility Law (Exhibit J-79).

157. Article 3 of the Decreto No. 2.128/91 (Exhibit J-86) establishes a | to
1 parity between the Argentine peso and the US dollar.

“... la moneda de

 

56

Las modificaciones contempladas en el Articulo 46
de la Ley deberdn basarse en circunstancias
especificas no previstas con anterioridad, y no
podrdan ser recurrentes. Las mismas no incluyen el
reajuste que contempla el Articulo 42 de la Ley. (.. .

»

170. Article 4.5 provides reassurance to licensees that their
license may not be modified without their consent:

(... .) Las licencias otorgadas no . . . serdn
modificadas durante su vigencia sin el
consentimiento de los licenciatarios. No se
considerardn modificaciones a la licencia (i) las
modificaciones que [ENARGAS] introduzca en el
Reglamento del Servicio, sin perjuicio del derecho de
[ENARGAS]o del licenciatario a_ requerir el
correspondiente ajuste de las tarifas si el efecto neto
de tal modificacién alterase en sentido favorable o
desfavorable, respectivamente, el — equilibrio
econ6mico-financiero existente antes de tal
modificacién; y (ii) los reajustes de la tarifa que
conste[n] como anexo de la licencia y que se
practiquen de acuerdo con la_ Ley, esta
Reglamentacién y los términos de la respectiva
licencia. Al convocar a licitaci6n en caso de extincién
de una licencia, [ENARGAS] podrd modificar los
términos de la licencia vigente hasta ese momento.

 

171. The Information Memorandum of September 1992 was
circulated to raise interest in the privatization of Gas del
Estado among foreign investors.!58 This Memorandum touted
the availability of real dollar tariffs:!5°

 

The privatisation of Gas del Estado offers an unique
investment opportunity. Outlined below are some of
the attractive characteristics of the privatisation.

Attractive tariffs, in real dollar terms.
[Emphasis in the original] The initial tariffs have
been set at a level intended to provide the new
companies with an attractive return on investment,
including the investment necessary to renovate the
systems. The tariff regulation, which is based on the
U.K. style of price capping formula, allows the new

companies to maintain the real dollar value of their
tariffs and provides incentives to invest in improving
efficiency.

 

[Emphasis added.]

172. The Information Memorandum draws attention to the
tariff and adjustment regimes of the Gas Law and of the Gas
Decree:!6°

The Gas [Law] provides that:

e tariffs should be at a level which enables the
licensee to earn a reasonable rate of return; and

e profitability should reflect the efficiency of the
licensee and satisfactory performance of the
licensed service.

The Gas [Law] specifies also that Licensees shall
adjust tariffs in accordance with a mechanism which
refers to appropriate international market indicators,
modified by a factor intended to promote efficiency
while providing the licensee with an incentive to
invest in the system. The adjustment mechanism
shall be reviewed every five years by the NGRE,
taking account of the two principles stated above.
This mechanism has been adopted in a number of
other major utilities internationally and is described
as “price capping with periodic regulatory review”
(also commonly known as “RPI-X”).

C..)

 

The Regulatory Decree sets out the principles of tariff
regulation and the licence contains the detailed
adjustment formula. The tariffs and prices are
calculated in U.S. dollars and expressed in convertible
Argentine pesos as provided in the Convertibility Law
(No. 23,928 and its Decree No. 2128/91). The allowed
adjustments will also be calculated in U.S. dollars.

Licensees may adjust their tariffs semi-annually to
reflect changes in the U.S. Producer Price Index
(PPI), which will be used as the market indicator
mentioned in the Gas [Law] (... .)

160. Exhibit J-101, pp. 26 and 27. These principles are restated in
Appendix A of the Information Memorandum.

58

173. MetroGAS received its 35 year License on 21 December
1992. The MetroGAS License:

a) confirms the application of the US dollar as the
currency of reference for the calculation and
adjustment of tariffs (Article 9.2);

b) Annex III includes an indication that tariffs are
expressed “en $ convertibles ley 23,928”"'®! (Annex
IID;

c) sets out the different tariff review and adjustment
mechanisms (Articles 9.3, 9.4 and 9.6);

d) requires that modifications to the Reglamento de
Servicio respond to the evolution and need to
improve service, and it calls for consultations with
the licensee and a tariff adjustment if the
economic and financial equilibrium is disturbed
(Article 9.1);

e) requires the consent of the licensee to modify the
Reglas Basicas of the License (Article 18.2); and

f) prohibits price controls and entitles the licensee to
compensation in case of departure from this rule
(Article 9.8).

174. Finally, on 28 December 1992, GASA, the Initial
Shareholders, MetroGAS, the Estado Nacional and Gas del
Estado entered into a Share Transfer Agreement.'©? Clause
4.2.2 of this agrerement provides for the entry into force of
the MetroGAS License.

175. The genesis of Argentina’s privatization of Gas del
Estado and the representations made to foreign investors at
every step of the process are irreconcilable with Respondent's
defense. While formally the Regulatory Framework and the
MetroGAS License apply to MetroGAS, the record
unequivocally shows that the entire privatization process was
designed to invite the participation of foreign investors. How
the investment is structured is frequently a function of
regulatory requirements or fiscal considerations. This,

161. Law 23.928 is the Convertibility Law.
162. Exhibit J-115.

59

however, does not remove the focus from foreign investors as
the main target of Argentina's privatization efforts.

176. It is also difficult to square the investment protection
paradigm offered by the Argentina-U.K. BIT with Argentina's
position that its commitments are to MetroGAS alone. BG is
entitled to rely on these commitments in connection with its
allegations of breach of the substantive provisions of the BIT
with respect to its “Investment” in Argentina. But this is a
matter for Section E below.

2. Nature of BG’s Claims

177. Under Article 8 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT, treaty
disputes with regard to an “Investment” may be submitted to
arbitration.

178. As already noted, BG contended that its “Investment”
for purposes of the Argentina-U.K. BIT takes the form of (i)
an indirect ownership interest in GASA and MetroGAS; and
(ii) certain rights. BG’s Statement of Claim describes the
“Investment” as follows:'63

49. Since article I(a)(ii) of the UK Treaty defines
investment as inter alia “shares in stock” and “any
other form of participation in a company, established
in the territory of either of the Contracting Parties”,
BG's participations in the Argentine companies
MetroGAS and GASA _ constitute protected
investments under the U.K. Treaty.

50. Moreover, BG has (i) interests in claims to money
and performance under contracts entered into by
MetroGAS; and (ii) benefits from the Licence granted
by the Government to MetroGAS to carry out gas
distribution services in Argentina. These also
constitute protected investments under Article
1(a)(iii) and (v) of the UK Treaty.

179. BG has thus submitted to arbitration a dispute relating
to damage to such ownership interest and rights. This is,
according to BG, the dispute “with regard to an investment”
in the instant matter. BG argued that Argentina breached the
BIT with respect to the following “Investments”:

a) BG’s indirect equity in MetroGAS and GASA
(Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT); and

163. Statement of Claim, paragraphs 49 and 50

60

b) BG’s rights under Article 1(a)(iii) and (v) of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

180. Argentina has objected to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction
on grounds that Argentina has not consented to the
arbitration of this dispute:!6+

60 Observe el Tribunal que el desacuerdo planteado
en el caso sub examine esta referido a las
disposiciones contenidas en una licencia otorgada
para la distribucién de gas natural y en el marco
regulatorio respectivo. Tales desacuerdos no estan
vinculados con la tinica inversion realizada por BG y
en consecuencia no habilitan la jurisdiccién arbitral
de conformidad con el articulo 8 del TBI. Las
alegadas disputas juridicas que puedan surgir de
dicha licencia e instrumentos deberdn ser sometidas,
conforme se explica infra, a la jurisdiccién de
tribunales nacionales libremente consentidas por las
partes correspondientes. La Repiiblica Argentina no
niega que los  contratos  puedan  constituir
inversiones protegidas. Para protegerlos,
simplemente, se  requiere que los contratos
pertenezcan al inversor, lo que aqui no ocurre.

61 Conforme lo expresa LA DEMANDANTE en el
pdarrafo 389 de la Demanda, todos los compromisos
que supuestamente la Repiiblica Argentina habria
violentado surgen directamente de la licencia y de
instrumentos que forman el marco regulatorio del
gas. Por ello, debieron ser planteados en el foro
pactado, que no es un tribunal del CNUDMI. LA
DEMANDANTE, consciente de la prorroga de
jurisdiccién que libremente habia pactado Metrogas,
intenta confundir al Tribunal sobre la_ real
naturaleza de sus reclamos.

181. The fact that claims under a treaty may relate to
underlying rights set out in domestic law, or in a concession,
license or contract is not, in and of itself, an impediment to
adjudication in the treaty forum. The Tribunal finds
persuasive support for this proposition in other investment
arbitration awards relied upon by Claimant.'® The Tribunal

Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/12, Award of 14 July 2006,

refers in particular to the Annulment Committee findings in
Compania de Aguas del Aconquija SA and Vivendi Universal
(formerly Compagnie Générale des Eaux) v Argentine
Republic:

. .. where ‘the fundamental basis of a claim’ is a treaty
laying down an independent standard by which the
conduct of the parties is to be judged, the existence of
an exclusive jurisdiction clause in the contract
between the claimant and the respondent state or one
of its subdivisions cannot operate as a bar to the
application of the treaty standard. At most, it might
be relevant — as municipal law will often be relevant —
in assessing whether there has been a breach of the
treaty.

182. In Eureko v. Poland the tribunal followed the Vivendi
Annulment Committee decision in upholding its authority to
“... consider whether the acts of which Eureko complains,
whether or not also breaches of [contract], constitute
breaches of the treaty” .'©7

183. The Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to determine if
the measures complained of by Claimant constitute a breach
of the treaty with respect to “Investments” made by BG,
regardless of whether or not the same measures are in breach
of the MetroGAS License.

184. Still, BG’s claims are properly before this Tribunal only
to the extent that BG has standing to bring them. In other
words, the question is whether BG is entitled to claim that
Argentina has breached the Argentina-U.K. BIT with respect
to its “Investments” as follows:

a) BG’s indirect equity in MetroGAS and GASA
(Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT); and

b) BG's alleged rights under Article 1(a)(iii) and (v) of
the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

185. The next Section of this award examines the issue of
derivative claims.

E. May BG Bring “Derivative Claims”?

186. BG argued that Argentina breached the Argentina-U.K.
BIT with respect to the following BG “Investments”:

a) BG’s indirect equity in MetroGAS and GASA
(Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT); and

b) BG’s rights under Article 1(a)(iii) and (v) of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

187. The Tribunal will thus examine the derivative nature of
BG's treaty claims with respect to equity (Article 1(a)(ii) of the
BIT) and with respect to “Investments” that take the form set
out in Article 1(a)(iii) and (v) of the BIT.

1. Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT

188. Paragraph 113 of this award records Argentina’s
acknowledgement that BG holds an indirect shareholding
interest in GASA and in MetroGAS. This interest falls
squarely within the definition of “Investment” in Article
1(a)(ii) of the BIT.!68

189. In responding to specific Tribunal questions, BG
argued that Argentina dismantled the tariff regime applicable
to MetroGAS and destroyed the promised economic
equilibrium. This, in turn, allegedly abolished its rights to:!©°

a) “... tariffs sufficient for [MetroGAS] to pay back
interest and capital on its debt to third parties . .
.”;and

b) “...recover the value of its equity stake (all of the

sums spent in MetroGAS on acquiring its
shareholding and in growing the business through

168. “[‘I]nvestment’ means every kind of asset defined in accordance with
the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment is made and admitted in accordance with this Agreement and
in particular, though not exclusively, includes: . . . (ii) shares in and stock
and debentures of a company and any other form of participation in a
company, established in the territory of either of the Contracting Parties; .

   

169. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 245.

63

reinvested income), and a reasonable rate of
return on those amounts...”

190. Thus articulated, BG’s claims are derivative. BG does
not claim that Argentina’s measures were specifically directed
against its shareholding in GASA and MetroGAS. BG claims
instead that damage to the value of its shares was caused by
(or derives from) measures adopted by Argentina which had a
negative impact on the activities of MetroGAS and, hence, on
the value of its shareholding in GASA and in MetroGAS.

191. Argentina objected to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal
on grounds that derivative claims are proscribed by
international law and by domestic corporate law.

192. In support for its position under international law,
Argentina initially relied on Barcelona Traction, Light and
Power Co Ltd,' and it later invoked other more recent
decisions, including GAMI v Mexico."!

193. The Tribunal finds the GAMI decision apposite and
compelling as it relates generally to derivative claims, and
specifically to the significance of Barcelona Traction.

194. GAMI, a U.S. investor, owned 14.18% of a Mexican
company (GAM) in the business of producing sugar. GAM
owned 5 sugar mills which were formally expropriated by the
Mexican government in September of 2001.

195. Mexico did not expropriate GAM, nor did it formally
seize GAMI’s shares in GAM. GAMI’s argument was that the
formal expropriation of the sugar mills rendered its shares
worthless because the mills were GAM’s only productive
asset.

196. The GAMI tribunal framed the issue of derivative
shareholder claims as follows:'72

The disputing Parties have devoted considerable
efforts to the issue whether GAM is entitled to claim

States, (GAMD, UNCITRAL /NAFTA, Final Award of 15 November 2004,

on account of its derivative prejudice as a
shareholder. The heart of this debate is whether
governmental acts or omissions that adversely affect
GAM may be pleaded as breaches of NAFTA because
they had the result of reducing the value of GAMI’s
stake in GAM.

197. The tribunal found that “[c]hapter I] [of the NAFTA]
does not require a claimant shareholder to be a majority or
controlling owner for his investment to qualify for
protection.”'? In its submission to the GAM/ tribunal, the
United States acknowledged that investors like GAMI were
entitled to bring action under the North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA) on their own behalf. However, the
United States argued that they may only do so with respect to
damage to their own interest, and not for injuries to the
corporation. Both Mexico and the United States relied on
Barcelona Traction in support for this proposition.!74 The
Tribunal disagreed:!75

The Tribunal . . . does not accept that Barcelona
Traction established a rule that must be extended
beyond the issue of the right of espousal by
diplomatic protection. The ICJ itself accepted in
E.L.S.I. [footnote omitted] that US shareholders of an
Italian corporate entity could seise the international
jurisdiction when seeking to hold Italy liable for
alleged violation of a treaty by way of measures
imposed on that entity.

198. The GAMI tribunal found support for its findings in
Goetz v Burundi:'7©

Le Tribunal observe que la jurisprudence antérieure
du CIRDU ne limite pas la qualité pour agir aux
seules personnes morales directement visées par les
mesures litigieuses mais létend aux actionnaires de
ces personnes, qui sont les véritables investisseurs.

199. Like the GAM tribunal, this Tribunal relied on Vivendi
for a more explicit confirmation of the legitimacy of derivative
shareholder claims:!7”

. it cannot be argued that CGE did not have an
“investment” in CAA from the date of conclusion of
the Concession Contract, or that it was not an
“investor” in respect of its own shareholding, whether
or not it had overall control of CAA. Whatever the
extent of its investment may have been, it was
entitled to invoke the BIT in respect of conduct
alleged to constitute a breach...

200. The conclusion of the tribunal’s reasoning in GAM is
directly on point to the instant dispute:!78
. . The fact that a host state does not explicitly

interfere with share ownership is not decisive. The
issue is rather whether a breach of NAFTA leads with
sufficient directness to loss or damage in respect of a
given investment. Whether GAM can establish such a
prejudice is a matter to be examined on the merits.
Uncertainty in this regard is not an obstacle to
jurisdiction.

201. The Tribunal finds that no authority on the record,
including Consortium Groupement L.E.S.I. DIPENTA v.
Algeria, leads to a different conclusion or presents an
interpretation of Barcelona Traction that is inconsistent with
the findings in GAMI.

202. But Barcelona Traction is inapposite to this case for
other reasons as well:

a) the case does not stand for what Argentina
purports - the central legal principle decided in
Barcelona Traction is that the right of diplomatic
protection of a corporate entity should be
attributed to the State of incorporation, a point of
law not at issue here;

b) the ICJ specifically stated that it was not deciding
whether shareholders could bring a claim for

losses to their interests, since the only claim made
was for losses to the enterprise;!8° and

c) even if Barcelona Traction were somehow
relevant to the case at hand, the agreement of
Argentina and the U.K., as set out in the BIT
would override an international decision from
1970.

203. Under the Argentina-U.K. BIT, BG is clearly an
“Investor” and its shareholding interest in GASA and
MetroGAS is undoubtedly an “Investment”.

204. For this reason as well Argentina’s reliance on
principles of domestic corporate law must fail. BG’s claim is
made under the Argentina-U.K. BIT. BG is an “Investor” who
has made an “Investment” in Argentina within the definition
of Article I(a)(ii) of the treaty. It is further uncontroverted
that BG’s shares in GASA and MetroGAS are “assets” within
the meaning ascribed to the term in this award pursuant to
Argentine law. The meaning of the BIT is to be determined
not by analogy with private law rules, but from the words of
treaty itself and in the light of the purpose which it sets out to
achieve.!8!

205. This Tribunal therefore has jurisdiction to hear BG's
claims as they relate to its indirect shareholding in MetroGAS
and GASA (Article 1(a)(ii) of the BIT).

180. The ICJ held: “. . . The Belgian Government claims that shareholders
of Belgian nationality suffered damage in consequence of unlawful acts of
the Spanish authorities and, in particular, that the Barcelona Traction
shares, though they did not cease to exist, were emptied of all real
economic content. It accordingly contends that the shareholders have an
independent right to redress, notwithstanding the fact that the acts
complained of were directed against the company as such. Thus the legal
issue is reducible to the question of whether it is legitimate to identify an
attack on company rights, resulting in damage to shareholders, with the
violation of their direct right . The Court has noted . . . that the Belgian
Government did not base its claim on an infringement of the direct rights
of the shareholders. Thus it is not open to the Court to go beyond the
claim as formulated by the Belgian Government and it will not pursue its
examination of this point any further.” Exhibit JL-108 (Barcelona
Traction, Light and Power Co Ltd (Belgium v Spain), Judgment 5
February 1970, ICJ Reports 1970 paragraphs 48 and 49).

181. The Loewen tribunal took this view in the context of a NAFTA
dispute: Exhibit JL-398 (The Loewen Group, Inc. and Raymond L.
Loewen v United States of America, Loewen, ICSID Case No
ARB(AF)/98/3, Award 26 June 2003, paragraph 233).

 

 

 

 

 

67

2. Article 1(a)(iii) and (v) of the BIT'®2

206. Under Article 1(a)(iii) and (v) of the BIT, the term
“Investment” also includes:

a) claims to money which are directly related to a
specific “Investment”;

b) claims to performance under contract having a
financial value; or

c) business concessions conferred by law or under
contract.

207. BG argued that its “Investment” takes the form of:

a) “... claims to money and performance under
contracts entered into by MetroGAS”;'®3 and

b) “... benefits from the Licence granted by the
Government_to_MetroGAS to carry out gas
distribution services in Argentina.”'84

[Emphasis added]

208. BG's grievance is that Argentina breached the BIT
causing damage to BG’s “claims to money” and “claims to
performance” under the MetroGAS License:!85

Here BG has an interest in the economic value of the
Licence, i.e. the right for MetroGAS to receive a net
stream of income allowing it, commercial risks aside,
to recover its investment and to obtain a reasonable
rate of return. This is the asset that qualifies as a
“claim to money” and “a claim to contractual
performance under contract having financial value”
under Article I(a)(iii) and thus as a_ protected
investment under the Treaty. [Footnote omitted].

 

182. “[‘I]nvestment’ means every kind of asset defined in accordance with
the laws and regulations of the Contracting Party in whose territory the
investment is made and admitted in accordance with this Agreement and
in particular, though not exclusively, includes: . . (iii) claims to money
which are directly related to a specific investment or to any performance
under contract having a financial value; . . . (v) business concessions
conferred by law or under contract, including concessions to search for,
cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources.

185. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 176.

 

 

  

 

 

68

Further, BG has an interest that the rights of
MetroGAS under the Licence (that is, the basic
premises of MetroGAS’ tariff regime) be respected,
since those rights underpin precisely the economic
value of the Licence . . . BG’s interest in those Licence
rights is the asset that qualifies as a protected
investment under Article |(a)(v) of the Treaty.

[Emphasis added]

209. Does BG own “claims to money” and “claims to
performance” or other rights under the MetroGAS License?
May BG put “claims to money” and “claims to performance”
or assert other rights derived from the MetroGAS License
before this Tribunal? One of these two questions must be
answered in the affirmative in order to establish BG's ius
standi.

210. The answer to the first question is a matter of record.
BG is not a party to the MetroGAS License!8° and Claimant
has not established that it can directly assert claims (to
money, performance or otherwise) under the MetroGAS
License. The question then becomes whether BG can bring
those claims before this Tribunal indirectly, acting on behalf
of MetroGAS.

211. Argentina correctly noted!8’ that some treaties include
a mechanism for foreign investors to bring claims on behalf of
an entity in the territory of the host State which they own or
control. One example is Article 1117 of the NAFTA:!88

1. An investor of a Party, on behalf of an enterprise of
another Party that is a juridical person that the
investor owns or controls directly or indirectly, may
submit to arbitration under this Section a claim that
the other Party has breached an obligation under:

(a) Section A or Article 1503(2) (State Enterprises),
or

(b) Article 1502(3)(a) (Monopolies and _ State
Enterprises) where the monopoly has acted in a
manner inconsistent with the Party's obligations
under Section A, and that the enterprise has incurred
loss or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that
breach.

212. Article 25(2)(b) of the Washington Convention
addresses standing from the perspective of the entity in the
territory of the host State:

(1) The jurisdiction of the Centre shall extend to
any legal dispute arising directly out of an
investment, between a Contracting State (or any
constituent subdivision or agency of a Contracting
State designated to the Centre by that State) and a
national of another Contracting State, which the
parties to the dispute consent in writing to submit to
the Centre. When the parties have given their
consent, no party may withdraw its consent
unilaterally.

(2) “National of another Contracting State” means:

(a) any natural person who had the
nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the
date on which the parties consented to
submit such dispute to conciliation or
arbitration as well as on the date on which
the request was registered pursuant to
paragraph (3) of Article 28 or paragraph
(3) of Article 36, but does not include any
person who on either date also had the
nationality of the Contracting State party
to the dispute; and

(b) any juridical person which had the
nationality of a Contracting State other
than the State party to the dispute on the
date on which the parties consented to
submit such dispute to conciliation or
arbitration and any juridical person which
had_the nationality of the Contracting
State party to the dispute on that date and
which, because of foreign control, the
parties have agreed should be treated as a
national of another Contracting State for
the purposes of this Convention.

[Emphasis added]

213. Under both the NAFTA and ICSID treaties the
“investor” must own or control the local entity.

70

214. The Argentina-U.K. BIT is of little assistance to BG. It
does not provide a mechanism for BG to bring claims derived
from the License on behalf of MetroGAS. “Disputes with
regard to an investment” may only include “an investor of
one Contracting Party and the other Contracting Party.”!89
BG does not have standing to seize this Tribunal with “claims
to money” and “claims to performance”, or to assert other
rights, which it is not entitled to exercise directly. There is no
authority on the record, including CMS,!% identifying the
source of the Tribunal’s authority to depart from Article 8 of
the BIT.

215. This finding is consistent with BG’s analysis of its own
alleged damages. BG’s expert did not provide a valuation of
damage to BG’s rights in the MetroGAS License independent
of the loss of value of its shareholding interest in GASA and
MetroGAS. The theory, of course, is that any damage to
MetroGAS will reflect on the value of BG’s equity ownership
in GASA and MetroGAS. This finding does not disturb the
end result.

3. Conclusion

216. This Tribunal has jurisdiction over BG's claims of
breach of the Argentina-U.K. BIT relating to its shareholding
interest in GASA and MetroGAS.

217. BG does not have standing to seize this Tribunal with
“claims to money” and “claims to performance”, or to assert
any other right, derived from the MetroGAS License.

218. These determinations and the Tribunal’s finding in
paragraph 183 of the award are also dispositive of Argentina’s
contention that domestic courts have exclusive jurisdiction
over BG's claims. Any rights which MetroGAS might have
under the jurisdictional clause of the MetroGAS License are
not an obstacle to the jurisdiction of this Tribunal over the
claims of BG as set out in paragraph 216 above.

F. Are Measures of General Application
Actionable under the Argentina-U.K. BIT?

219. Argentina took the position in this arbitration that
measures of general application are not actionable under the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

Para poder solicitar la aplicacién de un tratado de
proteccion de inversiones, las medidas que se alegan
perjudiciales deben estar dirigidas especificamente
contra_aquéllas. Medidas universales que estan
destinadas a impactar sobre inversiones y sobre no
inversiones, sobre nacionales y sobre extranjeros, no
constituyen materia para ser consideradas por este
Tribunal. Una_ atribucién semejante importaria
hacer caer bajo la competencia de este Tribunal una
politica ptiblica y no un conflicto legal.

 

[Emphasis added]

220. Respondent found support for this position in
Methanex Corporation v. United States of America,'!9! a
matter under Chapter 11 of the NAFTA (Methanex I).

221. Objecting to Argentina’s submission, BG contended
that it does not complain of economic conditions in
Argentina, nor does it take issue with the government's
general economic policies or measures. Rather, so BG, its
claims relate to the measures that directly and specifically
violate concrete commitments that Argentina made to BG as a
foreign investor in the privatized gas industry and that the
measures infringed specific protections that Argentina owes
to UK investors under the BIT.'%2

222. As regards Methanex I, BG submitted that the case
was based on NAFTA, not on a bilateral investment treaty,
and that the jurisdictional threshold set by Article 1101(1) of
the NAFTA requires a stronger connection between the
measures complained of and the investment than that
provided by Article 8 of the BIT. BG contended that in any
event, the findings support BG’s case rather than Argentina’s.
Referring in this connection to the decision of the tribunal in
Pope & Talbot v Canada, BG submitted that the measures
need not be primarily directed at the investment as the
measures complained of effectively repudiated the specific

191, Exhibit JL-372 (Methanex Corporation v. United States of America,
Partial Award, 7 August 2002).
192. Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paragraph 61.

72

and fundamental guarantees deliberately provided by
Argentina to entice BG’s investment and on which BG relied
in making that investment.!%3

223. Indeed, the Tribunal notes that the Argentina-U.K. BIT
does not include language like the text at issue in Methanex I
(i.e., Article 1101 of the NAFTA) and the instant dispute is not
a NAFTA dispute. However, this decision merits examination
as it was heavily relied upon by Argentina.

224. At issue in Methanex were measures of general
application enacted by the State of California to ban the sale
and use of methyl tertiary-butyl ether, or MTBE, a gasoline
additive. On 7 August 2002 the Methanex J tribunal rendered
a partial award addressing whether measures of general
application are actionable under the NAFTA. Concretely, the
Methanex I tribunal interpreted the following provision of the
NAFTA:

Article 1101: Scope and Coverage

1. This Chapter applies to measures adopted or
maintained by a Party relating to:

(a) investors of another Party;

(b) investments of investors of another Party in
the territory of the Party; and

(c) with respect to Articles 1106 and 1114, all
investments in the territory of the Party.

[Emphasis added]

225. Argentina finds support in two Methanex I
assumptions and findings, (i) that Article 1101(1) creates a
restrictive jurisdictional threshold, and (ii) that the “relating
to” language of Article 1101(1) of the NAFTA requires some
“legally significant connection” beyond effect between the
complaining investor and the measures that are subject to
complaint:!%4

We decide that the phrase “relating to “ in Article
1101(1) NAFTA signifies something more than the
mere effect of a measure on an investor or an

193. Counter-Memorial on Jurisdiction, paragraphs 72-75.
194, Exhibit JL-372, cit, paragraph 147.

73

investment and that it requires a legally significant
connection between them, as the USA contends.
Pursuant to the rules of interpretation contained in
Article 31(1) of the Vienna Convention, we base that
decision upon the ordinary meaning of this phrase
within its particular context and in the light of the
particular object and purpose in NAFTA’s Chapter 11.

226. However, the Tribunal is not convinced that the
decision in Methanex I is of any support to Argentina’s
objections. First, Methanex I was not about the rights of an
investor (BG) that is a shareholder injured by measures that
also injure the local companies (GASA and MetroGAS) in
which it invested. Rather, Methanex I had to do with the
rights of a producer of an input (methanol) of a product
(MTBE), when that final product is banned or restricted.

227. Second, for the reasons set out below, the Tribunal
does not believe that Methanex I provides a correct
interpretation of the NAFTA.

228. The Methanex I tribunal viewed Article 1101(1) of the
NAFTA as a jurisdictional threshold for an investor seeking to
bring an investor-state claim, as opposed to a part of a
general “scope and coverage” provision meant to introduce
Chapter 11. Methanex I turns Article 1101 into a provision that
makes the scope and coverage of Chapter 11 vary according to
who is the complaining party, an interpretation at odds with
the text and context of Article 1101 and the NAFTA.

229. Article 1101(1) is similar to introductory provisions in a
number of other Chapters of NAFTA. Like those other
introductory provisions, Article 1101 (1) sets out the scope of
obligations under Chapter 11, including the obligations of
Canada, Mexico and the United States, as well as the
obligations of each government to all covered investors and
their investments.

230. The context of Article 1101(1), as well as the object and
purpose of the NAFTA, demonstrate that the interpretation of
Article 1101(1) in Methanex I cannot be sustained. Several
Chapters of NAFTA have exceptions to obligations that would
simply be unnecessary if measures that did not “relate to”
other NAFTA investors or their investments were outside the
scope of the obligations. These exceptions would also be
unnecessary if some “legally relevant connection” beyond or
in addition to effect were necessary for a measure to be within

74

the scope of the obligations. For instance, the following
NAFTA provisions would be pointless under the
interpretation of NAFTA Article 1101(1) in Methanex I:

a) Article 1101(4), preserving the right of the State to
perform basic social services such as law
enforcement and public education;!%>

b) Articles 1109(4) and (5);!96

c) Mexico's energy reservations in Annex IIT and
other exceptions in Annexes VI and VII of the
NAFTA;!97

d)_ the reservations listed by Canada, Mexico and the
United States in Annexes V and VI;!98

e) Article 1401(3) allowing NAFTA Parties to
exclusively conduct or provide for public pensions
plans and social security systems;

f) Articles 1405(5), (6), and (7), concerning equal
competitive opportunities;!99

g) Article 1411 on transparency;2 and

195. Since the exercise of these functions by the state does not “relate” or
“refer” to foreign investors or indeed have any other connection other
than effect on foreign investors or their investments.

196. The “equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of
laws relating to . . . bankruptcy” and the other laws mentioned in those
provisions would not require exemption from the transfers obligations,
since such laws do not refer to foreign investors or their investments nor
have a relationship beyond effect.

197. Because the non-discriminatory measures of general application
listed there do not “relate or refer to” any investor or investment, and they
would thus ipso iure escape the coverage of Chapter 11 under Methanex I.

198. Because none would be within the scope of the NAFTA if “relating to”
meant “referring to” or some other relationship beyond the effect of the
measures on foreign investors or their investments.

199. Paragraphs 5, 6 and 7 establish an “equal competitive opportuniti
standard to deal with the problem that applying exactly the same
measures to all investors and institutions, domestic or foreign, may
sometimes result in disparities of treatment (a situation commonly
referred to as de facto denial of national treatment). Under the Methanex
J theory, measures that were non-discriminatory on their face but had
discriminatory effects would be outside the scope of the Chapter, and
there would be no need to have special rules for sing their legitimacy.
200. This provision would have little meaning if it would only apply to
measures that “relate to ” or “refer to” foreign investors. The provision

   

 

 

75

h)_ the reservations laboriously listed by the three
countries in Annex VII.?0!

231. Applied to the instant matter, Methanex I would
discharge Argentina of its BIT obligations simply because its
measures do not, on their face, target any investor, and it
would render the promises used to attract foreign investment
meaningless.

232. Finally and tellingly, Article 8(1) of the Argentina-U.K.
BIT refutes Argentina’s position that not all measures come
under its application. This provision bans not just direct
seizures of an investment, but also “.. . measures having an
effect equivalent to nationalization or expropriation”. If
accepted, the Methanex I interpretation would largely nullify
the prohibition of indirect expropriation and measures
tantamount to expropriation.

233. The Tribunal finds no basis for adopting an
interpretation that would render the substantive rights and
obligations of the Argentina-U.K. BIT ineffective.

G. Is the Renegotiation Process an Obstacle
to this Tribunal’s Jurisdiction?

234. Argentina’s position is quite simple: this Tribunal is
precluded from adjudicating BG’s claims because the
renegotiation process contemplated by the emergency
legislation may yield a successful outcome and a new
license:202

157. El corolario de las medidas tomadas por la
UNIREN en acuerdo con las Licenciatarias es que
resulta inminente la aprobacién final de la
renegociacién de la_ licencia de  Metrogas,
garantizdndose que la relacién contractual seguird
adelante por el prolongado lapso restante.

 

clearly is intended to be a comprehensive obligation, and not only limited
by a strained interpretation of Article 1101(1).

201. For example, the United States has a reservation in Annex VII related
to financial services which applies generally to offers on commodity
futures and options, thereby affecting both domestic and foreign
investors/investments alike. Why would it be necessary for the United
States to take an exception to the obligations of the treaty if this is a
measure of general application.

proceso de renegociacion de los contratos.

235. More precisely, Argentina took the position that BG
should be stripped of standing because MetroGAS might
accept a new deal:203

159... . la inminente suscripcién de los Acuerdos
referenciados con la licenciataria Metrogas, pone en
evidencia la total ausencia de legitimacién de LA
DEMANDANTE para incoar el presente arbitraje,
pues ha quedado sin sustento su reclamo, y por ende
las alegadas pérdidas que dice haber sufrido, todo lo
que se enmarca en una desafortunada decisién
empresaria, debiendo asumir el riesgo y cargar
exclusivamente con las consecuencias de su decisién.

236. In opposition, BG contended that the renegotiation
process is irrelevant to jurisdiction and, in any event, that
Argentina’s objection is misplaced, given that the
renegotiation process relates to MetroGAS, not to BG. BG has
never participated in the renegotiation process and its claims
under the BIT are entirely independent of that process.
Further, BG submitted that Argentina is trying to use this
process to hide the devastating impact of the measures it
took.204

237. The Tribunal recalls here Argentina’s measures
adopted during the summer of 2002, attempting to preclude
investors from seeking redress in arbitration or before local
courts.25 Coupled with the finding of lack of jurisdiction now
sought by Argentina, these measures would yield the
following result:

a) only MetroGAS would have standing to appear in
the renegotiation process;

b) the exclusive forum to bring grievances would be
UNIREN (to the exclusion of the courts and
arbitration under the Argentina-U.K. BIT);

c) the licensees and their foreign affiliates could not
expect to enforce the original terms of the
Regulatory Framework (including their license);
and

d) any substantive right under the BIT would be lost.

238. Argentina, however, has offered no authority and no
plausible interpretation of the BIT that would support a result
so inconsistent with the object and purpose of the treaty, and
so destructive of its representations to BG.

239. More generally, Argentina’s argument that BG’s claims
are subject to the renegotiation process is irrelevant to a
determination as to this Tribunal’s jurisdiction. The claims
are admissible and properly before the Tribunal as set out in
Sections C to F above, and any determination as to the merits
of BG’s claims is a matter of substance. BG’s claims under the
treaty are independent of the renegotiation process. BG may
at any time withdraw them, or even forego enforcement of an
award, if the renegotiation were to yield a result to its
satisfaction. The CMS tribunal properly addressed this
issue:206

It is not for the tribunal to rule on the perspectives of
the renegotiation process or on what TGN might do in
respect of its shareholders, as these are matters
between Argentina and TGN or between TGN and its
shareholders.

240. Argentina’s jurisdictional objection as it relates to the
renegotiation process is accordingly dismissed.

H. Conclusion

241. In its examination of BG’s claims for breach of Articles
5 and 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT the Tribunal shall
consider Argentina’s representations and commitments as set
out in Section D above.

242. Subject to paragraph 217 of this award, the Tribunal
has jurisdiction with respect to all of BG’s claims which are
admissible in this arbitration.

Argentina, ICSID Case No ARB/OI/8, Decision of the Tribunal on

243. BG does not have standing to seize this Tribunal with
“claims to money” and “claims to performance”, or to assert
in this arbitration any other right, derived from the
MetroGAS License.

VII. Article 5 of the BIT (Expropriation)

244. BGcontended that Argentina has breached Article 5 of
the BIT as it allegedly expropriated BG’s investments without
compensation. BG's primary case on expropriation is that
Argentina has expropriated its shareholding in MetroGAS
through the substantial destruction of the value of that
shareholding in breach of commitments in the Regulatory
Framework. BG's alternative case is that Argentina has
expropriated its rights under or related to the Licence, i.e.,
BG's interest over the economic value of the Licence and BG’s
interest that the rights of MetroGAS under the Licence be
respected. Argentina objected to BG’s contention and
submitted that there has been no violation of Article 5 of the
BIT.

245. Article 5 of the BIT provides as follows:

(1) Investments of investors of either Contracting
Party shall not be nationalised, expropriated or
subjected to measures having effect equivalent to
nationalisation or expropriation (hereinafter referred
to as “expropriation”) in the territory of the other
Contracting Party except of a public purpose related
to the internal needs of that Contracting Party on a
non-discriminatory basis and against prompt,
adequate and _ effective compensation. Such
compensation shall amount to the genuine value of
the investment expropriated immediately before the
expropriation or before the impending expropriation
became public knowledge, whichever is the earlier,
shall include interest at a normal commercial rate
until the date of payment, shall be made without
delay, be effectively realizable and be freely
transferable. The investor affected shall have a right,
under the law of the Contracting Party making the
expropriation, to prompt review, by a judicial or other
independent authority of that Contracting Party, of
his or its case and of the valuation of his or its
investment in accordance with the principles set out
in this paragraph.

(2) Where a Contracting Party expropriates the

assets of a company which is incorporated or
constituent under the law in force in any part of its

79

own territory, and in which investors of the other
Contracting Party own shares, the provisions of
paragraph (1) of this Article shall apply.

246. The Tribunal summarizes in the following paragraphs
the Parties’ contention with regard to BG’s expropriation
claim.

A. Summary of Parties’ Contentions

1. BG's Position

247. As to BG’s primary case, the substantial destruction of
the value of BG’s shareholding in MetroGAS, BG contended
that it is based on the well-established principle that a
substantial deprivation of the value and economic benefit of
an investment even without any alteration of formal
ownership rights qualifies as an expropriation. In this
connection, BG referred to the Wood-Collins Report,
demonstrating that the value of BG’s investment in MetroGAS
has suffered a reduction of 99% in value due to the measures
adopted by Argentina, described in Section D of Chapter III
above.207

248. BG contended that, from a legal standpoint, a finding
of expropriation does not require a demonstration that the
host State has benefited from the taking. In any event, so
argued BG, Argentina has admitted that its measures had a
redistributive effect, transferring wealth to which BG was
entitled. Further, BG submitted that the purpose for the
adoption of the infringing measures is irrelevant: under
Article 5(1) of the BIT compensation is due even where the
expropriation is “for a purpose related to internal needs”.?°8

249. In addition, BG submitted that Argentina permanently
eliminated the tariff regime guaranteed under the Regulatory
Framework, since there is no prospect that BG will be
reinstated to the position it enjoyed before Argentina adopted
the measures.?09

250. BG contended that Argentina disregards a wealth of
international case law holding that regulatory and/or police
power measures constitute expropriation if contrary to
specific commitments and assurances granted to investors.

207. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraphs 223-225.
208. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 226.
209. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 227.

  

80

This is of particular relevance in the case of indirect
expropriation where the investor retains formal title but the
value of the rights attached to such title is diminished or
destroyed. The measures can be said to, not only affect the
value of the business, but effectively “deprive” the value of the
business. 2!0

251. Under BG's alternative case, BG submitted that its
rights under or related to the Licence are assets that qualify as
a protected investment under Article |(a) of the BIT, and in
particular sub-paragraphs (iii) and (v) of this provision. BG
contended that Argentina's abolition of the right to economic
equilibrium and the tariff regime underpinning this principle
constitutes an expropriation of BG’s rights under or related to
the Licence.?!!

2. Argentina’s Position

252. Argentina denied that any expropriation under Article
5 of the BIT has occurred. Argentina contended that the
reasonableness, proportionality and the purpose of the
emergency measures need to be taken into account to
ascertain whether there has been an expropriation under the
BIT.2!2

253. In contending that only an indirect or de facto
expropriation may be of relevance to the present dispute,
Argentina submitted that the wording of Article 5 of the BIT
makes it apparent that the measures must at least produce
the same effect as an expropriation.?'3

254. Argentina further indicated that MetroGAS recorded a
net income of US$99.3 million during the first semester of
2006. Argentina also argued that the value of MetroGAS
shares has increased since the crisis and that this increase is
consistent with the term of 35 years for which the MetroGAS
License was stipulated.?!4

255. In emphasizing the wide scope of the regulatory and
police powers of a State, Argentina insisted that a claim for
indirect expropriation calls for a test of proportionality,
balancing the lawfulness and significance of purpose of the

81

measures, including whether such purpose could have
reasonably been achieved in a less detrimental manner,
against the damage suffered as a consequence of the
measures.?'5

256. As to BG's expectations under the Regulatory
Framework, Argentina contended that the applicable
Regulatory Framework is the same as that approved when BG
decided to invest, adapted to the new macroeconomic context
resulting from the crisis. In analyzing the Regulatory
Framework, Argentina contended that contrary to BG's
allegations, Argentina had not amended specific regulations
concerning the gas industry, but has issued a general rule
applicable to the society as a whole. According to the
Emergency Law, the goal was “ordenar el contexto
macroecon6mico a partir de la crisis, manteniendo las
mismas condiciones de previsibilidad para la inversion.”
Further, Argentina drew attention to Sections 18.2 and 18.3 of
the MetroGAS License, in which it is held, inter alia, that any
provisions of the License may be held invalid and
unenforceable pursuant to a judgment of the local courts.
Thus, the Emergency Law and the provisions adopted as a
consequence thereof could not be in breach of the BIT.2!6

257. Further, Argentina submitted that BG's claim for
expropriation is inadmissible on grounds of unjust
enrichment as, between 1992 and 2001, MetroGAS collected
from users an overcharge amounting to between 6% and 7%
as prevention of an economic emergency. This means that
loss of profitability was anticipated with the payment of the
country risk overcharge.?!7

B. The Tribunal’s Findings

258. In determining whether Argentina has violated Article
5 of the BIT by expropriating BG's investment, the Tribunal
has to define what constitutes expropriation, as it is not
defined in the BIT.

215. Alegato Final, paragraphs 327-329.
216. Alegato Final, paragraphs 331-336; 390-398. For Section 18.2 of the
MetroGaS Licence, see paragraph 48 above. Section 18.3 of the MetroGAS
License provides that: “Si alguna disposicién de esta Licencia fuera
declarada invdlida 0 inexigible por sentencia firme del tribunal
competente, la validez y exigibilidad de las restantes disposiciones de
esta Licencia no serdn afectadas. Cada estipulacion de la Licencia sera
valida y exigible en la mayor medida permitida por la ley aplicable.”

217. Alegato Final, paragraphs 369-370.

82

259. For the purpose of the present dispute, direct
expropriation is of no relevance, since it is “understood as the
forcible appropriation by the State of the tangible or
intangible property of individuals by means of
administrative or legislative action” .2'8 This is not what has
happened in this case because Argentina has not appropriated
BG's investment. Rather, the Tribunal has to consider
whether Argentina has adopted “measures having effect
equivalent to... expropriation”, as provided in Article 5(1) of
the BIT, constituting indirect expropriation.?!9

260. Tribunals have defined indirect expropriation as
measures that have the effect of “interfering” with or
“neutralizing” property.

261. This standard appears in the Iran-U.S. Claims
Tribunal's Starrett Housing Corporation:22°

[I]t is recognized in international law that the
measures taken by a state can interfere with property
rights to such an extent that these rights are rendered
so useless that they must be deemed to have been
expropriated, even though the state does not purport
to have expropriated them and the legal title to the
property formally remains with the original owner.

262. Subsequent tribunals, including Jmpregilo, Lauder,
and Pope & Talbot, have likewise applied this standard in
determining whether an investor's property has been
indirectly expropriated.

263. The Impregilo Tribunal provided that:22!

expropriation mention the ‘interference’ of the Host

law in general with respect to the definition of expropriation see JL-405,

State in the normal exercise, by the investor, of its
economic rights.

Moreover, the effect of the measures taken must be of
such importance that those measures can be
considered as having an effect equivalent to
expropriation.

264. The Lauder Tribunal held that “. . . indirect
expropriation or nationalization is a measure that does not
involve an overt taking, but that effectively neutralizes the
enjoyment of the property.” 222

265. Finally, Pope & Talbot held that indirect expropriation
required consideration of “. . . whether that interference is
sufficiently restrictive to support a conclusion that the
property has been ‘taken’ from its owner.”?23

266. Most recently, the tribunal in LG&E Energy Corp.,
LG&E Capital Corp., LG&E International Corp. v. The
Argentine Republic summarized as follows the requirements
for establishing indirect expropriation under the Argentina-
U.S. BIT as follows:274

Generally, the expression “equivalent to
expropriation” or “tantamount to expropriation”
found in most bilateral treaties, may refer both, to the
so-called “creeping expropriation” and to the de facto
expropriation. Their common point rests in the fact
that the host State’s actions or conduct do not involve
“overt taking” but the taking occurs when
governmental measures have “effectively
neutralize[d] the benefit of property of the foreign
owner.” Ownership or enjoyment can be said to be
“neutralized” where a party no longer is in control of
the investment, or where it cannot direct the day-to-
day operations of the investment. As to the
differences, it is usual to say that indirect
expropriation may show itself in a gradual or growing
form —creeping expropriation— or through a sole and

Arbitration, Final Award, 3 September 2001, paragraph 200).

dated 13 September 2001, paragraph 604).

84

unique action, or through actions being quite close in
time or simultaneous —de facto expropriation.

267. Thus, the question with regard to BG’s primary case is
whether the measures adopted by Argentina, as described in
Chapter III.D above, have had the effect of “interfering with”
or “neutralizing” the benefit of BG’s property, specifically, of
BG’s shareholding in MetroGAS.

268. The Tribunal notes that a State may exercise its
sovereign power in issuing regulatory measures affecting
private property for the benefit of the public welfare.
Compensation for expropriation is required if the measure
adopted by the State is “irreversible and permanent and if
the assets or rights subject to such measure have been
affected in such a way that “.. . any form of exploitation
thereof. . ." has disappeared. . . ."?25 Conversely, a measure
does not qualify as equivalent to expropriation if the
“investment continues to operate, even if profits are
diminished” .??6

269. Having considered the foregoing, the Tribunal
concludes that Argentina has not violated Article 5 of the BIT,
as it did not expropriate BG’s investment.

270. Specifically, the impact of Argentina's measures has
not been permanent on the value of BG's shareholding in
MetroGAS. It might well be that the measures adopted by
Argentina were severe causing a fluctuation of BG's
investment during the crisis. However, MetroGAS’ business
never halted, continues to operate, and has an asset base
which is recovering.

271. Further, in reliance on the set of requirements set forth
in Pope & Talbot, the Tribunal does not see that a substantial
deprivation of BG’s shareholding in MetroGAS has occurred,
depriving BG of the control of the investment in MetroGAS or
managing the day-to-day operations of MetroGAS. Nor have
the measures caused the arrest and detention of MetroGAS
officials or employees. Nor has Argentina interfered in the
administration of the company, impeding the distribution of
dividends to MetroGAS’ shareholders, or interfering in the
appointment of officials and managers.

225. Exhibit JL-397 (TECMED SA v. The United Mexican States, 1CSID
Case No. ARB(AF)/00/2, Award dated 29 May 2003, paragraph 116).
226. LG&E (paragraph 191); see also Pope & Talbot (paragraphs 101-102).

85

272. It follows that BG’s alternative case in relation to BG’s
rights under or related to the License must fail as well, given
that the Tribunal does not find that the measures adopted by
Argentina caused a permanent, severe deprivation of BG's
rights with regard to its investment.

VIII. Article 2.2 of the BIT (Promotion and

Protection of Investment)

273. In addition to expropriation, BG argued that Argentina
has breached the standards of treatment provided in 2.2 of
the BIT. Argentina objected to BG’s contention.

274. Article 2.2 of the BIT provides as follows:

Investments of investors of each Contracting Party
shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment and shall enjoy protection and constant
security in the territory of the other Contracting
Party. Neither Contracting Party shall in any way
impair by unreasonable or discriminatory measures
the management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of investments in its territory of investors of
the other Contracting Party. Each Contracting Party
shall observe any obligation it may have entered into
with regard to investments of investors of the other
Contracting Party.

A. Fair and Equitable Treatment

275. What follows is a summary of the numerous legal and
factual contentions of BG and Argentina as presented in the
Parties’ written and oral submissions with respect to Article
2.2 of the BIT.

1. Summary of Parties’ Contentions

a. BG’s Position

276. BG contended that Argentina treated BG’s investment
unfairly and inequitably in failing to provide BG with a stable
and predictable investment environment in accordance with
its legitimate and reasonable expectations.

277. Referring to the origin of the standard of fair and
equitable treatment and_ its relationship with the
international minimum standard of treatment, BG contended
that fair and equitable treatment is an overriding general duty

86

which encompasses other standards and certainly the
international minimum standard for the treatment of aliens.

278. In reliance upon recent case law, BG contended that
the minimum standard of treatment, also as interpreted by
the NAFTA Free Trade Commission in relation to Article
1105(1) of the NAFTA, equating fair and equitable treatment
with the customary international law minimum standard of
treatment of aliens, has evolved such that it is an autonomous
treaty concept to be given its plain meaning, and thus not
simply synonymous with the customary international
minimum standard. In BG's view, case law has consistently
held that fundamentally altering the investment framework
against legitimate investor expectations is by definition unfair
and inequitable.22’

279. To the extent that Argentina relied upon its well-
intentioned measures to face a state of emergency, BG
contended that Argentina ignores that the standard of fair
and equitable treatment is an objective standard and that it is
not necessary to establish bad faith, as recently held in Azurix
Corp. v. Argentina.?28

280. With respect to the factual scenario, BG submitted that
Argentina lured investors like BG into investing in its recently
privatized gas industry by representing to them that the

investment would be governed by a stable tariff regime, which
would guarantee them a reasonable real-dollar income.

281. BG contended that the tariff regime owed its promised
stability to the following main features:

a) that tariffs would provide efficient and prudent
operators with sufficient revenue to cover all
reasonable costs, including the cost of capital,
taxes, amortization and a “reasonable rate of
return” (the “economic-financial equilibrium” or
the principle of “recovery of costs”);

b) that tariffs would be calculated in U.S. dollars and
converted to pesos for billing purposes at the
applicable exchange rate;

c) that tariffs would be adjusted every six months in
accordance with the US PPI;

d) that tariffs would be subject to the Five-Year
Review and the Extraordinary Review, which
would ensure the continued economic-financial
equilibrium of the License;

e) that tariffs would not be frozen or subject to price
controls without compensation; and

f) that the tariff regime would not be changed
without the Licensees’ consent.?29

282. BG asserted that after enticing BG to invest,
Argentina took a series of damaging measures that destroyed
the key guarantees of the Regulatory Framework under which
BG reasonably expected to operate. These measures were at
odds with the stability and predictability of the investment
framework required by the principle of fair and equitable
treatment. In summary, BG submitted that since August
2000 MetroGAS has operated in an unpredictable and, to a
large extent, incomprehensible investment environment,
because the government of Argentina:

a) suspended the US PPI adjustment of tariffs, by

way of an injunction issued in August 2000 and
subsequent decisions of ENARGAS;

229. Statement of Claim, paragraphs 12 and 433; Post-Hearing Brief,
paragraph 5.

88

b) flatly abolished the calculation of MetroGAS’
tariffs in dollars, as the Convertibility Law of 2002
converted the July 1999 dollar tariffs into pesos at
the artificial rate of one to one and definitely
abolished the adjustment of those tariffs in
accordance with the US PPI;

  

c) effectively abolished the tariff review mechanisms
established under the Regulatory Framework.
Both the Five-Year Review and the Extraordinary
Review, would have required Argentina to adjust
those peso tariffs to cover MetroGAS’ drastically
increased costs in order to assure its reasonable
rate of return; and

d) established a _ little more than fictitious
renegotiation process, which has produced no
concrete serious offer to re-establish the
guarantees of the tariff regime, or alleviate the
imbalance of the License.?3°

b. Argentina’s Position

283. Argentina objected to the violation of the standard of
fair and equitable treatment under Article 2.2 of the BIT and
contended that the impact of the collapse on BG’s business is
related to a general crisis in which the measures adopted were
aimed at maintaining the sustainability of the economy in
general, and of the public service companies in particular.

284. Argentina submitted that the fair and equitable
treatment is not an independent standard and it argued that
this standard only requires treating investors in accordance
with the international minimum standard. Argentina
criticized that BG’s broad interpretation turns the fair and
equitable treatment standard into a strict liability standard
with negative consequence for both the States and
international law. Argentina relied on certain NAFTA and
ICSID decisions and suggested that this is also the position
held by the United States when approving their several BIT
models.??!

Eastern Credit Limited, Inc. and A.S. Baltoil v. The Republic of Estonia,

 

89

285. Referring to Article 8.4 of the BIT, Argentina stated
that the Parties expressly stipulated the applicability of the
law of the State party to the controversy, in this case, the law
of the Argentine Republic. Therefore, the Tribunal must take
into account the determination of the powers of the State to
issue measures tending to protect their public policy, and the
acknowledgment of any such powers on the basis of the rules
contained in the BIT. In Argentina’s view, the well-intended
measures taken by Argentina were reasonable and justified in
terms of the macro-economic context in which they were
adopted to face the state of emergency. Thus, it must be borne
in mind that under international law, the fair and equitable
treatment standard must be applied differently in normal
circumstances and under an emergency situation.?32

286. In Argentina’s view the Regulatory Framework has not
been subject to radical change and it has at all times been
honored. Contrary to BG’s intention, Argentina held that the
Regulatory Framework offers no guarantees, including the
alleged guarantee to dollar denominated tariffs. Further, BG
may not claim a right to annual profitability for 35 years, plus
amortizations or short-term profits, as in cases of financial
investments, since BG made an investment in public service
assets. It has to be noted that the impact of the collapse on
BG’s business is related to a general crisis in which the
measures adopted were aimed at maintaining the
sustainability of the economy in which public service
companies operate.233

  

287. As to BG’s submission that States are to maintain
stable investment environments in accordance with the
investor's legitimate expectations, Argentina submitted that
the Parties did not include a “stabilization clause” in the BIT.
Therefore, it is inadmissible for BG to try to achieve the same
effect, as it would seem to imply that the State cannot modify
the provisions on the basis upon which the investment was
made. Emphasizing that the Emergency Law was grounded,
Argentina asserted that even if BG’s interpretation of the

standard of fair and equitable treatment were to follow, its
claim ought to be dismissed nonetheless.234

288. In summary, Argentina submitted that the program
which has been applied since 2002 had the following
priorities:

a) initiating a path towards the recovery of economic
activities;

b) immediately handling the urgent social situation
brought about by the economic depression;

c) preventing the collapse of the financial system;

d) precluding the dilution of saving deposits frozen
within the financial system;

e) re-organizing the Argentine, provincial and
municipal financial systems;

f) facilitating the performance of such contracts as
may have been affected by the crisis, precluding
the unjust enrichment of certain groups and the
resulting poverty of others; and

g) normalizing financial relations with the rest of the
world and with multilateral credit organizations
affected by the default on public debt.?95

2. The Tribunal’s Findings

289. The Tribunal must determine whether the measures
adopted by Argentina and described in Chapter III.D above
are in breach of the standard established under the first
sentence of Article 2.2 of the BIT:

Investments of investors of each Contracting Party
shall at all times be accorded fair and equitable
treatment and shall enjoy protection and constant
security in the territory of the other Contracting
Party.

290. The Parties raised the issue of the relationship between

the undefined concept of fair and equitable treatment in the
BIT and the international minimum standard under general

234. Alegato Final, paragraphs 471-474.
235, Alegato Final, paragraph 466.

91

principles of international law. More precisely, BG argued
that fair and equitable treatment in the Argentina-U.K. BIT is
an overriding general duty which encompasses other
standards - and certainly the international minimum
standard. Conversely, Argentina took the position that the fair
and equitable standard of Article 2.2 of the BIT affords no
protection in addition to the international minimum
standard. Thus, at the very least, there is no dispute between
the Parties that a breach of the international minimum
standard automatically yields a violation of the obligation to
accord fair and equitable treatment under the Argentina-U.K.
BIT.

291. For the reasons set out below, this Tribunal has
concluded that the measures adopted by Argentina fall below
the international minimum standard and it is consequently
not necessary for this award to examine whether the
Argentina-U.K. BIT provides a more generous independent
standard of protection.

292. The Tribunal’s analysis starts with the standard of fair
and equitable treatment as aptly articulated in Waste
Management II - drawing from the SD Myers, Mondev, ADF
and Loewen decisions:?36

. . the minimum standard of treatment of fair and
equitable treatment is infringed by conduct
attributable to the State and harmful to the claimant
if the conduct is arbitrary, grossly unfair, unjust or
idiosyncratic, is discriminatory and exposes the
claimant to sectional or racial prejudice, or involves a
lack of due process leading to an outcome which
offends judicial propriety—as might be the case with a
manifest failure of natural justice in judicial
proceedings or a complete lack of transparency and
candour in an administrative process.

293. This point of departure is particularly fitting as all of
these NAFTA tribunals were under an obligation to consider
that the concept of fair and equitable treatment “. . . does not
require treatment in addition to or beyond that which is
required by the customary international law minimum
standard of treatment of aliens.”237

236. Exhibit JL-429 (Waste Management, Inc. v. United Mexican States,
ICSID Case No. ARB(AF)/00/3, Award dated 30 April 2004, paragraph
98).

237. See Notes of Interpretation issued by the NAFTA Free Trade
Commission in 31 July 2001.

92

294. But Waste Management II is apposite to the instant
for one more reason: its unambiguous statement that
commitments to the investor are relevant to the application of
the minimum standard of protection under international law:

In applying [the] standard it is relevant that
treatment is in breach of representations made by the
host state which were reasonably relied on by the
claimant.

295. As illustrated by Generation Ukraine v. Ukraine, this
principle is also recognized in the context of litigation under
bilateral investment treaties:2°8

. the protection of [legitimate expectations] is a
major concern of the minimum standards of
treatment contained in bilateral investment treaties.

296. And as illustrated by Revere Copper and Brass, Inc. v.
Overseas Private-Investment Corp., the importance of
assurances given to investors predates the BIT generation:2°9

We regard these principles as particularly applicable
where the questions is, as here, whether actions taken
by a government contrary to and damaging to the
economic interests of aliens are in conflict with
undertakings and assurances given in good faith to
such aliens as an inducement to their making the
investments affected by the action.

297. In this connection, the tribunal in LG&E summarized
the nature of the investor’s expectations as follows:24°

It can be said that the investor's fair expectations
have the following characteristics: they are based on
the conditions offered by the host State at the time of
the investment; they may not be established
unilaterally by one of the parties; they must exist and
be enforceable by law. . .

298. The duties of the host State must be examined in the
light of the legal and business framework as represented to
the investor at the time that it decides to invest. This does not

imply a freezing of the legal system, as suggested by
Argentina. Rather, in order to adapt to changing economic,
political and legal circumstances the State’s regulatory power
still remains in place. As previously held by tribunals
addressing similar considerations, “. . . the host State's
legitimate right subsequently to regulate domestic matters in
the public interest must be taken into consideration as
well.”241

299. Similarly, the tribunal in CMS concluded that:242

It is not a question of whether the legal framework
might need to be frozen as it can always evolve and be
adapted to changing circumstances, but neither is it a
question of whether the framework can be dispensed
with altogether when specific commitments to the
contrary have been made.

300. The words of the President of Argentina in his
presentation of the BIT to the Argentine Congress in 1992
highlight the need to establish a climate of stability and
confidence to attract investments:243

...A través de ellos, los estados aceptan mantener
inalterables durante su vigencia ciertas normas de
tratamiento de inversiones, con lo que se espera
establecer un clima de estabilidad y confianza para

atraer inversiones.
[Emphasis added]

301. As to the requirement of bad faith, Argentina relies on
the findings in Genin44 and Waste Management II.2*> In the

241. Saluka Investments v. Czech Republic (UNCITRAL Partial Award
dated 17 March 2006, paragraph 304); see also Exhibit JL-374 (Marvin
Feldman v. The United Mexican States, NAFTA ICSID Case No.
ARB(AF)/99/1 Award dated 16 December 2002, paragraph 112):
“[g]overnments, in their exercise of regulatory power, frequently change
their laws and regulations in response to changing economic
circumstances or changing political, economic or social considerations.
Those changes may well make certain activities less profitable or even
uneconomic to continue.”

former decision, the tribunal held solely that a violation of the
minimum standard “would include acts showing a willful
neglect of duty .. . or even subjective bad faith” (emphasis
added). In the latter, the tribunal found that the standard set
forth in the Neer case, involving willful neglect of duty and
bad faith, has been rejected. Therefore, the Tribunal holds
that, in concurrence with prior arbitral findings, the violation
of the standard of fair and equitable treatment does not
require bad faith by the host State.?46

302. The Tribunal is mindful of the evolution of the
international minimum standard. The NAFTA tribunal in
Thunderbird summarized this evolution as follows:247

The content of the minimum standard should not be
rigidly interpreted and it should reflect evolving
international customary law. Notwithstanding the
evolution of customary law since decisions such as
[the] Neer Claim in 1926, the threshold for finding a
violation of the minimum standard of treatment still
remains high, as illustrated by recent international
jurisprudence. For the purposes of the present case,
the Tribunal views acts that would give rise to a

95

breach of the minimum standard of treatment
prescribed by the NAFTA and_ customary
international law as those that, weighed against the
given factual context, amount to a gross denial of
justice or manifest arbitrariness falling below
acceptable international standards.

303. In the instant matter, the measures adopted by
Argentina fall below the international minimum standard for
several reasons.

304. Faced with the economic crisis of inflation and public
deficit of the late 1980s, Argentina sought to attract in
particular foreign investors to invest in formerly state-owned
gas companies. The Gas Law, Gas Decree and MetroGAS
License, described in detail in Chapter III.B above, were all
part of an attractive Regulatory Framework addressing
specific risks with the emphasis on an efficient, just and
reasonable tariff regime. It is not a mere coincidence that the
different regulations were enacted within two years after the
BIT was signed.

 

305. Of predictable interest to foreign investors were those
parts of the Regulatory Framework in conjunction with the
specific commitments represented by Argentina, as described
in Chapter VI.D.1 above, in which Argentina guaranteed,
inter alia, (i) to apply U.S. dollars as the currency of reference
for the calculation of tariffs before their conversion in
Argentine pesos for billing purposes (Article 41(1) of the Gas
Decree and Section 9.2 of the Reglas Bdsicas of the
MetroGAS License); (ii) semi-annual adjustment regime of
the tariffs in accordance with the US PPI (Section 9.4.1.1 of
the Reglas Bdsicas of the MetroGAS License; (iii) the
entitlement of the revision of the tariffs every five years, and,
upon request an “extraordinary review” on “objective
grounds” to maintain that tariffs are at a sufficient level to
provide a reasonable rate of return (Article 38 of the Gas
Law); and (iv) the reassurance that the licenses may not be
modified without the consent of the licensees, entitling the
investor to compensation in case the Government changed
the tariff regime (Sections 9.8 and 18.2 of the MetroGAS
License). The availability of real-dollar tariffs was specifically
highlighted in the Information Memorandum circulated by
Argentina to promote the privatization amongst foreign
investors.748

248. See paragraphs 160-176 above.

96

306. These conditions appealed to BG, and resulted in its
investment in MetroGAS. Considering also the incorporation
of provisions relating to the stability of the Regulatory
Framework in the MetroGAS License,?49 BG could reasonably
rely on the Regulatory Framework.

307. Argentina, however, entirely altered the legal and
business environment by taking a series of radical measures,
starting in 1999, as described in Chapter III.D above.
Argentina’s derogation from the tariff regime, dollar standard
and adjustment mechanism was and is in contradiction with
the established Regulatory Framework as well as the specific
commitments represented by Argentina, on which BG relied
when it decided to make the investment. In so doing,
Argentina violated the principles of stability and
predictability inherent to the standard of fair and equitable
treatment.

308. In this connection it bears emphasis that the second
suspension of the US PPI, formalized by Decree 669/00,
recognized that the licensees had “derecho legitimamente
adquirido” to the US PPI tariff adjustments?5° and
acknowledged that Bilateral Investment Treaties are a part of
the legal framework relevant to investments in Argentina.25!
As it turns out, the gas distribution tariffs have not been
adjusted for inflation since July 1999 and, thus, have
remained frozen at pre-crisis values.

309. Argentina also breached the international minimum
standard in relation to UNIREN’s authorization to
renegotiate the Government agreements with public service
providers. As stated at paragraph 80 above, the Emergency
Law and subsequent legislation were enacted to promote a
new deal with the licensees, impeding the application and
execution of the original Regulatory Framework. Also,
Argentina enhanced the violation of the standard of fair and
equitable treatment under the BIT by formalizing in

249. See paragraphs 48-51 above.
250. Exhibit J-226, Decree 669/00, page 2: “Que dicho sistema de ajuste
constituye una premisa bdsica, condicién de los pliegos licitatorios y de
las ofertas adjudicadas que fueron su consecuencia, y por lo tanto
importa un derecho legitimamente adquirido por parte de las
Licenciatarias adjudicatarias de cada licencia.”

251. Exhibit J-226, Decree 669/00, page 1: “Que el proceso privatizador y
las inversiones resultantes encuentran amparo legal en la normativa
vigente, y en especial, también en los Tratados de Proteccién Reciproca

por diversas ley

 

 

97

Resolution 308/02 and Decree 1090/02 the exclusion from
the imposed renegotiation process of any licensee that sought
redress in an arbitral or other forum.

310. In summary, when the situation of currency
devaluation materialized, Argentina fundamentally modified
the investment Regulatory Framework, which, as stated
above, provided for specific commitments that were meant to
apply precisely in a situation of currency devaluation and cost
variations. Thus, Argentina reversed commitments towards
BG, when BG relied the most on its legitimate and reasonable
expectations of a stable and predictable business and legal
investment environment.

B. Protection and Constant Security

311. Further, the Parties are in dispute about the scope and
application of the second part of the first sentence of Article
2.2 of the BIT, which reads “Investments of investors of each
Contracting Party .. . shall enjoy protection and constant
security in the territory of the other Contracting Party’.

312. BG submitted that the measures taken by Argentina
were at odds with Argentina’s active protection and constant
security obligation of BG’s investments, as required under the
first sentence of Article 2.2 of the BIT.

1. Summary of Parties’ Contentions
a. _BG’s Position

313. BG follows the decision of the tribunal in Azurix, by
linking the standard of fair and equitable treatment to the
general duty to protect investments.?52

314. In reliance on the findings in AAPL253 AMT?54 and
CME,*> BG submitted that the standard of protection and
constant security provided in the BIT is one of due diligence,
requiring Argentina to exercise reasonable care and actively
protect BG’s investment. Thus, the duty of protection and

security of investments is infringed by government measures
that fail to apply the rules specifically designed to govern and
protect the investment by withdrawing protection and
security previously granted to an investment, regardless of
whether property is physically destroyed or whether judicial
remedies may be available.25¢

315. More specifically, BG contended that in accordance
with AAPL the duty to ensure the protection and security of
the investment embodies an “objective standard of vigilance”
which is violated by the “mere lack or want of diligence,
without any need to establish malice or negligence."257

316. Referring to the decision in AMT, BG submitted that
the tribunal interpreted the standard as requiring the active
conduct of the host State in taking “all measure of precaution
to protect the investments."258

317. As to the scope of the standard, BG relies on CME,
which found that:

The host State is obligated to ensure that neither by
amendment of its laws nor by actions of its
administrative bodies is the agreed and approved
security and protection of the foreign investor's
investment withdrawn or devalued.?*°

318. With respect to BG’s factual contentions concerning
the violation of Argentina’s protection and constant security
obligation, BG submitted that Argentina’s duty involved, in
particular, and at the very least, the application of the
Regulatory Framework that it set up for the specific purpose
of ensuring the viability, legal and economic protection and
security of the investment. BG asserted that Argentina did
exactly the opposite, in complete disregard for the protection
and constant security of BG’s investment.2©° The detailed
factual contentions of BG are set forth in paragraphs 276-282
above. Although they relate to the standard of fair and
equitable treatment, they are relevant with regard to the
standard of protection and constant security as in BG’s view

the duty of protection and constant security of investments is
part of the standard of fair and equitable treatment.

b.  Argentina’s Position

319. Argentina denied that it has violated the standard of
protection and constant security under the BIT and criticized
that BG does not specify which duty to act it has violated.
Argentina contended that BG has neither a factual nor a legal
basis to make Argentina responsible for having omitted due
diligence.

320. In contesting the relevance of the case law relied
upon by BG, Argentina stated, without the benefit of any
references, that jurisprudence and doctrine are unanimous in
conceiving that the standard of protection and security is a
standard of “physical protection”. BG, however, has not
invoked any act of physical violence against its investment.26!

321. Relying on Tecmed, Argentina highlights that “the
security and protection guarantee is not absolute and that it
does not impose upon the Government issuing it strict
liability.”. In the context of the present case, Argentina
submitted that MetroGAS had all the possibilities of resorting
to the legal system in force in Argentina in order to protect its
contractual rights under the same terms and conditions as
any other litigant.262

322. Finally, Argentina relies on the notion of emergency
and draws attention to the fact that, during the period under
examination, the country was undergoing the worst
economic, social and institutional crisis of its history.2°

2. The Tribunal’s Findings

323. The Tribunal can be relatively brief in relation to the
allegations of BG. BG’s claim with respect to the standard of
protection and constant security must fail.

324. The Tribunal observes that notions of “protection and
constant security” or “full protection and security” in
international law have traditionally been associated with
situations where the physical security of the investor or its

261. Memorial de Contestacion, paragraph 574.
262. Memorial de Contestacin, paragraphs 575 and 576.
263. Memorial de Contestaci6n, paragraph 577.

100

investment is compromised. Indeed, the authorities relied
upon by BG confirm this:

a) in AAPL the tribunal had to determine under the
Sri Lanka-U.K. BIT whether the physical
destruction of property of AAPL and the killing of
a farm manager and permanent staff members
were in violation of the provision of protection
and security under Article 2.2 of the Sri Lanka-
U.K. BIT; 264

b) in AMT the tribunal found that under the U.S.—
Zaire BIT, Zaire had violated the protection and
security standard required by the treaty in
relation to lootings carried out against AMT’s
investment.?6>

325. Similarly at issue in E.L.S.J was the occupation of the
investor's plant by its workers following its requisition by the
Mayor of Palermo*®6 and Wena Hotels Limited v. Arab
Republic of Egypt relates to the forceful seizure of
property.267

326. The Tribunal is mindful that other tribunals have
found that the standard of “protection and constant security”
encompasses stability of the legal framework applicable to the
investment. By relating the standards of “protection and
constant security” and “fair and equitable treatment” such
tribunals have found that the host State is under an obligation
to provide a “secure investment environment’ .2°8 However,
in light of the decisions quoted above, the Tribunal finds it
inappropriate to depart from the originally understood
standard of “protection and constant security”.

2007, paragraph 303, referring to the Argentina-Germany BIT which
includes, however, the qualified term of “legal security” in the relevant
provision.

 

 

101

327. Considering the facts of this dispute and the Parties’
submissions, the Tribunal notes that BG has not alleged
physical violence or damage in the implementation of the
measures adopted by Argentina, nor does the Tribunal see
that such violence or damage has in fact occurred.

328. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina has
not breached the standard of protection and constant security
set out in Article 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

Cc. Unreasonable and Discriminatory
Measures

329. BG also contended that, in violation of the second
sentence of Article 2.2 of the BIT, Argentina impaired BG’s
use and enjoyment of its investment by unreasonable and
discriminatory measures, by placing a disproportionate and
discriminatory burden on MetroGAS and BG. Argentina
objected to BG’s allegations.

330. The second sentence of Article 2.2 of the BIT provides
as follows:

Neither Contracting Party shall in any way impair by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures the
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or
disposal of investments in its territory of investors of
the other Contracting Party.

1. Unreasonable Measures

(a) Summary of Parties’
Contentions

@ ~~ BG’s Position

331. BG contended that Argentina’s measures are
unreasonable because they dismantled the entire tariff regime
of the gas distribution industry.

332. As the term “unreasonable measures” is not defined,
BG relies on the following definition provided by the
commentator R. Happ that,

[I]t is possible to understand ‘unreasonable’ in two
different ways: Either as a procedural concept, that is
whether the governmental measure furthers the
government's objectives (sic.) is the less restrictive
measure and whether the impairment is proportional
to the achieved end; or as a substantive concept.
However, since it is always in the eye of the beholder

102

whether the measure is substantially reasonable or
not, the substantive concept approach must be
rejected.”209

333. BG submitted that Argentina’s unreasonable measures
of dismantling the entire tariff regime of the gas distribution
industry are “contrary to the expectations of BG and of any
reasonable and impartial person”. According to BG,
Argentina’s Regulatory Framework created and_ fuelled
legitimate expectations which were specifically incompatible
with the sorts of measures that it subsequently adopted. It
was, thus, unreasonable to strip BG of the key guarantees
upon which its investment was based.270

334. Further, BG contended that the measures are
unreasonable, because, in comparison to BG, other sectors
were excluded from the scope of the pesificacién and freezing
of prices and tariffs, or otherwise benefited from
compensatory and mitigating measures, or were at least
permitted to increase their prices in accordance with
inflation.?7!

Gi) Argentina’s Position

335. In its defence, Argentina contended that the measures
adopted where justified and proportional to the aim sought
and within the context of the collapse of the Argentine
economy.

336. In equating the legal meaning of “unreasonable” with
“arbitrary”,?’2, Argentina contended that the arbitrariness
standard demands the verification of certain extremes: (i) the
capricious violation of the legal system in force without
reason or justification; and (ii) the determination of the
context which gives rise to the adoption of the government
measures. For Argentina, measures are not arbitrary absent a

271. Statement of Claim, paragraph 452.

272. The Tribunal notes that the Spanish versions of Argentina's
submissions refer also to “medidas arbitrarias” and not only to “medidas
irrazonables” (see, e.g., Alegato Final, paragraph 476).

premeditated intent to breach the rules in force and to act ina
way contrary to the law.273

337. Argentina submitted that by respecting the law, it took
adequate steps to safeguard the general welfare of all players
in the Argentine economy, including foreign investors.
Explaining in detail the aim of each measure taken by it,
Argentina contended that the actions taken were reasonable
and proportional to the purpose sought. Argentina’s goal was
that companies could continue to operate, to obtain revenues
and make a profit. Argentina puts special emphasis on the
commenced renegotiation process of utility contracts to
which MetroGAS is part as well.274

338. In the alternative and in reliance on £.L.S./., Argentina
contended that an action taken by the host State may be
considered illegal and yet not be arbitrary under international
law.275

(b) The Tribunal’s Findings

339. The Tribunal has to determine whether the
measures taken by Argentina, described in Chapter III.D
above, are unreasonable in a way that impairs the “. . .
management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal . . .”

of BG’s investment in Argentina.?76

340. The term “unreasonable” is not defined in the BIT.
Therefore, the Tribunal has to look at its ordinary meaning
for international law.

341. While there might be some overlap, the Tribunal does
not deem it appropriate to equate “unreasonableness” and
“arbitrariness”. First, the term “arbitrary” does not appear in
Article 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT. Moreover, one
connotation of “arbitrariness” under international law
involves a breach beyond the ordinary meaning of “reason”
seemingly calling for “. . . a willful disregard of due process of

273. Alegato Final, paragraphs 476-479.

Final, paragraphs 471-482.

276. Article 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

104

law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises, a sense of
juridical propriety."2”

342. Like the “fair and equitable treatment” standard,
“reasonableness” should be measured against the
expectations of the parties to the bilateral investment treaty,
rather than as a function of the means chosen by the State to
achieve its goals:278

. . As with the fair and equitable standard, the
determination of reasonableness is in its essence a
matter for the arbitrator's judgment. That judgment
must be exercised within the context of asking what
the parties to bilateral investment treaties should
jointly anticipate, in advance of a challenged action,
to be appropriate behaviour in light of the goals of the
Treaty.?”°

343. Thus, withdrawal of undertakings and assurances
given in good faith to investors as an inducement to their
making an investments is by definition unreasonable and a
breach of the treaty.

344. Argentina adopted certain measures to address its
economic, political and social crisis. It is not for this Tribunal
to pass judgment on the reasonableness or effectiveness of
such measures as a matter of political economy. Rather, this
Tribunal is concerned with the interpretation and application
of Article 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT. As indicated above,
Argentina unilaterally withdrew commitments which induced
BG to make its investment in Argentina and this constitutes
unreasonable action and a breach of this provision of the
treaty.

345. Argentina guaranteed, inter alia:

(a) the application of U.S. dollars as the currency of
reference for the calculation of tariffs before their
conversion into Argentine pesos for billing
purposes;

277. Exhibit JL-195 (Elletronica Sicula S.p.A. (E.L.S.1.) (United States of
America v. Italy), 1989 ICJ Report 1989 RLA 56, Judgment dated 20 July
1989),

278. See paragraphs 294 to 300 of this award.

279. Exhibit JL-352 (CME Czech Republic B.V. v. Czech Republic,
UNCITRAL, Partial Award dated 13 September 2001, paragraph 158).

105

(b) a semi-annual adjustment regime of the tariffs in
accordance with the US PPI;

(c

revision of the tariffs every five years;

(d) an “extraordinary review” mechanism based on
“objective grounds” to ensure that tariffs provide a
reasonable rate of return; and

(d) the reassurance that the licenses may not be
modified without the consent of the licensees,
entitling the investor to compensation in case the
government changed the tariff regime.

The availability of real-dollar tariffs was specifically
highlighted in the Information Memorandum
circulated by Argentina to promote the public tender
amongst foreign investors.?80

346. Unilateral withdrawal by Argentina of these key
components of the Regulatory Framework was from the
perspective of the Argentina-U.K. BIT unreasonable and it
was therefore in breach of the second sentence of Article 2.2
of the treaty.

2. Discriminatory Measures

(a) Summary of Parties’
Contentions

@ ~~ BG’s Position

347. BGcontended that the measures adopted by Argentina
discriminated against BG. BG stressed that in contrast to
other sectors of the Argentine economy that were permitted
to recover swiftly from the impact of the measures, Argentina
consciously placed a disproportionate burden on largely
foreign-controlled energy companies like MetroGAS.

348. BG advocated a flexible interpretation of what
constitutes a “discriminatory” measure. In reliance on
Feldman and Occidental, BG contended that measures may
be discriminatory even if not based on nationality, and even
where discrimination is not express or intentional. Rather, it
suffices that the measures have a discriminatory effect.

280. See paragraphs 160-176 above.

106

Further, according to BG, it is not necessary that differential
treatment be in the same economic sector.?8!

349. BG submitted that the Argentine Government itself
noted the discrimination by stating that “one sector transfers
resources to another."?82 The measures taken by Argentina to
limit the impact of its measures in sectors such as oil and gas
production, banking and public contracts, were not made
available to gas distributors and transporters. Thus,
Argentina’s measures were and _ continue to _ be
discriminatory.283

Gi) Argentina’s Position

350. Argentina objected to BG's legal and factual
contentions and invoked the principle of discriminatory
treatment articulated in E.L.SJ. and Genin: i.e., that
discriminatory treatment is to give foreign investors a less
favorable treatment than that granted to nationals.284
Argentina added to this understanding the notion that
discrimination is characterized by capricious, unreasonable
or absurd criteria.785

351. Argentina submitted that the measures were general in
nature, aimed at overcoming a period of generalized collapse
of the economy and extended equally to all inhabitants, in all
sectors. Thus, foreign investors as licensees of public services
cannot remain outside this situation. The measures taken by
Argentina affected all entities falling within the special
category set forth in Article 8 of the Emergency Law,
including BG. Argentina explained that each public service is
governed by different regulations, agreements and
characteristics that provided for different rate adjustments
from the ones established in the provisions applicable to the
natural gas industry: 286

No puede pretenderse vdlidamente que el régimen
aplicable al agua potable y a las cloacas sea igual al
aplicable al gas natural o a los transportes ptiblicos
o ala electricidad o al servicio postal: todos ellos son

servicios puiblicos pero no por ello estan sujetos a las
mismas normas o regimenes.287

352. Argentina also relied on the renegotiation process,
which it portrayed as evidence of equality of treatment of
MetroGAS and BG.?88

353. It was also Argentina’s position that at no time did
MetroGAS or BG receive unequal treatment within the same
sector, as MetroGAS was not subject to a special or more
onerous sacrifice.

(b) The Tribunal’s Findings

354. The Tribunal notes Claimant’s reliance on Marvin
Feldman v. Mexico and Occidental v. Ecuador in support for
its claim of discrimination.?8° Both of these cases relate to the
alleged breach of an obligation which, in the Argentina-U.K.
BIT, is set out in Article 3.29° Claimant did not argue that
Argentina breached Article 3, nor did it provide an
explanation of the relationship between Article 2.2 and
Article 3.

355. Nonetheless, the Tribunal accepts for the sake of its
analysis, that a measure in breach of the national treatment
or MEN standards of Article 3 of the BIT would unavoidably
also be “discriminatory” in the sense of the second sentence of
Article 2.2 of the BIT.

356. In determining whether discrimination has occurred,
the Tribunal considers it appropriate to follow the “three-
part” test discussed in Thunderbird v. Mexico.?9! Under this
test, it is necessary to:

 

287. Memorial de Contestacion, paragraph
288. Memorial de Contestacién, paragraphs 530-568; Alegato Final,
paragraphs 486-495.
289. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 379.
290. Article 3 of the BIT provides follo “() Neither Contracting
Party shall in its territory subject investments or returns of investors of
the other Contracting Party to treatment less favourable than that which it
accords to investments or returns of its own investors or to investments or
returns of investors of any third State. (2) Neither Contracting Party shall
in its territory subject investors of the other Contracting Party, as regards
their management, maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal of their
investments, to treatment less favourable than that which it accords to its
own investors or to investors of any third State.”
291. Exhibit JL-489 (International Thunderbird Gaming Corp. v. The
United Mexican States, NAFTA UNCITRAL, Award dated 26 January
2006, paragraph 170).

   
 
 

 

 

 

108

a) identify the relevant entities of the national
treatment comparison, to determine whether
they are in like circumstances;

b) consider the relative treatment received by each
such entity so as to ascertain the best level of
treatment available to any other domestic or
foreign investor; and

c) consider such factors as may be relevant to justify
any difference in treatment.

357. It may well be that the measures adopted by Argentina
did differentiate gas-distribution companies from other
public service providers. However, there is no discussion on
the record as to why BG was “in like circumstances” to
companies operating, for instance, in the transmission and
distribution of electricity.

358. In fact, it would at first glance appear that MetroGAS
was not “in like circumstances” relative to other licensees who
did not agree to the suspension of the US PPI adjustments at
the invitation of the Secretary of Energy on 6 January 2000,
and again on 17 July 2000.

359. The Tribunal notes that also by applying the standards
set out in E.L.S.J. to establish the existence of discriminatory
measures, as suggested by BG, it is not apparent that
Argentina’s measures were “not taken under similar
circumstances against another national."?92

360. Under the circumstances, the Tribunal is not
convinced that Argentina’s measures discriminated against
BG in the sense of the second sentence of Article 2.2 of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

D. Observance of Obligations Entered Into
With Regard to BG’s Investments

361. The final part of Article 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT
provides that:
Each Contracting Party shall observe any obligation it
may have entered into with regard to investments of
investors of the other Contracting Party.

292. JL-195 (Case Concerning the Elettronica Sicula S.p.A. (United States
of America v Italy), Judgment of 20 July 1989, ICJ Rep. 1989, pages 61-
62).

109

362. In reply to a question put to the Parties by the
Tribunal, BG took the position that Argentina had breached
the Argentina-U.K. BIT by violating the MetroGAS License:293

Argentina's violations of the Licence do amount to a
violation of the Treaty, and in particular the
prohibition of expropriation without compensation,
fair and equitable treatment, and all the subordinated
standards of treatment of Article 2(2) of the Treaty.

363. This claim must fail in the light of the Tribunal’s earlier
finding that BG does not have standing to seize this Tribunal
with “claims to money” and “claims to performance”, or to
assert other rights, derived from the MetroGAS License (see
Chapter VI.E.2 above).

364. However, BG also contended that the same principles
included in the MetroGAS License were incorporated in the
Gas Law, the Gas Decree and the Bidding Rules.294 Chapters
If.A-B and VI.D.1 of this award discuss the genesis of the
privatization of Gas del Estado. Chapter VI.D.1 focuses in
particular on the representations made by Argentina to
promote interest in the privatization and attract foreign
investors, including BG.

365. The rules announced by Argentina in the Information
Memorandum and materialized in the Gas Law, the Gas
Decree and the Bidding Rules were clearly not addressed at
MetroGAS alone. As indicated in paragraph 176 of this award,
BG is entitled to rely on these commitments in connection
with its allegations of breach of the substantive provisions of
the BIT with respect to its “Investment” in Argentina.

366. In Chapter VHI.A above, this Tribunal has already
concluded that the adoption of measures by Argentina which
destroyed key elements of the much publicized Regulatory
Framework, constitutes a breach by Argentina of its
substantive obligation under the Argentina-U.K. BIT to
accord BG fair and equitable treatment.

IX. National Emergency and State of Necessity

367. Defending the measures as described in Chapter TI.D
above, Argentina submitted that the severe economic, social
and political crisis it has undergone exempted Argentina from

293. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 282.
294. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 283.

110

liability in light of a state of emergency or a state of necessity.
Argentina referred in its primary defense to Article 4 of the
BIT, contending that it has not violated any standard of the
BIT. Alternatively, Argentina resorted to the doctrine of
“necessity” under customary international law. To
summarize, Argentina argued that even if the Tribunal finds
that there has been a violation of the BIT, measures adopted
by Argentina to palliate the greatest crisis in Argentine
history were justified by a “state of necessity” under both
Argentine and customary international law.29> BG objected to
both defenses.

368. The Tribunal will now summarize the Parties’
contentions.

A. National Emergency under the BIT

369. Article 4 of the BIT provides as follows:

Investors of one Contracting Party whose investments
in the territory of the other Contracting Party suffer
losses owing to war or other armed conflict,
revolution, a_state of national emergency, revolt,
insurrection or riot or resulting from arbitrary action
by the authorities in the territory of the latter
Contracting Party shall be accorded by the latter
Contracting Party treatment, as regards restitution,
indemnification, compensation or other settlement,
no less favourable than that which the latter
Contracting Party accords to its own investors or to
investors of any third State. Resulting payments shall
be freely transferable.

[Emphasis added]
1. Summary of Parties’ Contentions
a.  Argentina’s Position

370. Argentina submitted that Article 4 of the BIT expressly
establishes the case of a foreign investor suffering losses by
virtue of a state of national emergency. Thus, the BIT
legitimates actions taken by the host State, provided that the
foreign investor is treated in equality with other investors,

295. Initially, Argentina submitted as a separate defence that the
measures it had adopted were constitutional under Argentine law (see
Memorial de Contestacién, paragraphs 686-700). However, during the
course of the proceedings, Argentina appe: to have incorporated this
defence in the state of necessity defence under international law.

 

lll

domestic or foreign, with respect to losses suffered in the
territory of the host State.2%°

371. As to the standard required under Article 4 of the BIT,
Argentina contended that there should be no discrimination
as regards measures established to repair or compensate
losses suffered. The term “losses” incurred is used in a broad
sense, including any kind of harm. With regard to
compensation, Argentina highlighted that Article 4 of the BIT
does not demand for payment of compensation, but refers to
the treatment given to investors as regards “restituciones,
indemnizaciones, compensaciones u otros
resarcimientos.”"297

372. Relying on AAPL, Argentina submitted that the losses
allegedly incurred are not limited to destruction of property
due to armed hostilities, insurrections or other uses of force,
but refer to any situation of risk or disaster on a national level
calling for immediate action.298

373. Objecting to BG’s comparison drawn on the basis of
Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT, which BG submitted was

in “exculpatory expression” not contained in the Argentina-
U.K. BIT, Argentina contended that the principle enshrined in
Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT exists regardless of its
inclusion in the BIT. According to Argentina, a bilateral
investment treaty cannot prevent a State party from adopting
such measures as it deems necessary to maintain the public
order and guarantee the protection of its own essential
security interests.29

374. Following this interpretation, Argentina contended
that it acted in accordance with Article 4 of the BIT. The
measures adopted by Argentina were due to a state of
national emergency, pre-dating the adoption of the measures.
Thus, the losses the population suffered were not the result of
the measures taken by Argentina, but the result of the
combination of factors leading to the state of emergency,
including:

paragraphs 496-497.

a) the resignation of the constitutional President of
the Argentine Republic amidst an extraordinary
political-institutional collapse, followed by a
succession of several presidents;

b) _ the strong devaluation of the national currency in
the international markets;

c) the collapse of the Argentine banking system;
and

d) the serious social crisis with poverty, indigence
and unemployment rates hitting record levels
and tens of people killed in the midst of
confrontations in the Federal Capital City, as well
as in the rest of the country.30°

375. Argentina stated that in light of these severe
circumstances, the enactment of the Emergency Law was a
measure to mitigate the damages suffered by society as a
whole, by according equal treatment to all national and
foreign companies.3°!

b. _BG’s Position

376. BG disagrees that Article 4 of the BIT has an
exonerating effect. The only point of concurrence with
Argentina’s interpretation of Article 4 of the BIT is that in
BG’s view this provision does not require Argentina to make
reparation to a protected investor on any specific basis.
Article 4 provides that if any domestic or third-state investor
is accorded any such reparation for loss suffered in a situation
of “national emergency”, among others, then qualifying
investors under the BIT “shall be accorded... treatment...
no less favourable” 302

377. BG objected to Argentina’s submission that Article 4 of
the BIT is not limited to cases of physical destruction of
property caused by force in circumstances of armed conflict.
According to BG, Article 4 of the BIT is in the nature of
provisions commonly referred to as “war and_ civil
disturbance” clauses or “losses due to war” clauses. The

300. Memorial de Contestacién, paragraph 676; Alegato Final,
paragraphs 513-515.

301. Memorial de Contestacién, paragraph 678; Alegato Final,
paragraphs 520-521.

302. Reply, paragraph 396.

113

purpose of Article 4 of the BIT was to cover cases in which
general international law or insurance contracts exclude state
responsibility altogether, or the payment of compensation.
BG submitted that in any event, neither Article 4 of the BIT
nor any other provision of the BIT “legitimizes” the measures
adopted by Argentina, or Argentina's failure to provide
compensation 30

378. In summary, BG’s position is that Article 4 of the BIT
operates in situations where: (i) an investor has suffered
damages as a_ result of armed conflict or similar
circumstances; but (ii) that investor does not have a specific
entitlement to reparation under another provision of the BIT
or customary international law; and (iii) another investor,
whether domestic or foreign, has been granted reparation,
whether by operation of another treaty, domestic law, or
simply on a discretionary basis. In such circumstances,
Article 4 of the BIT provides that a qualifying investor is
entitled to “treatment no less favorable” than that accorded to
the investors who have been accorded compensation or other
forms of reparation. BG relied also on the findings of the
tribunals in AMT and AAPL.304

379. Further, BG submitted that the content of Article 4 of
the BIT is clear from the context of the BIT as a whole. In
relation to Article 2.2 of the BIT, BG submitted that in the
event that the treatment established under Article 2.2 of the
BIT is not afforded, and Article 2.2 of the BIT is accordingly
breached, reparation is due under general rules of customary
international law. Similarly, the right to receive “prompt,
adequate and effective compensation” according to Article 5.1
of the BIT requires no support from Article 4 of the BIT in
order to operate. Therefore, BG concluded, Argentina cannot
invoke Article 4 of the BIT to restrict the distinct obligations
incumbent upon it under Articles 2.2 and 5.1 of the BIT.3

380. Finally, BG contended that even if Article 4 of the BIT
were applicable in the present case, it would only underline
the preferential treatment that Argentina accorded to several
other sectors and _ activities. BG submitted that as

decision in CMS where the tribunal analyzed Article XI of the Argentina-
U.S. BIT, which includes in BG's view a typical exculpatory language

compensation for the impact of the Emergency Law,
Argentina has adopted special rules with respect to several
categories of investors, including gas producers, banks,
construction companies, seaport and airport operators .306

2. The Tribunal’s Findings

381. The Tribunal finds that no state of emergency defense
is available to Argentina under the Argentina-U.K. BIT. In the
Tribunal’s view, neither Article 4 of the treaty, nor the BIT as
a whole, exonerate Argentina’s breaches on grounds of state
of emergency or state of necessity.

382. Applying the interpretive principles of Article 31 of the
Vienna Convention, this Tribunal concludes that Article 4 of
the BIT does no more than ensure that the State does not
treat the foreign investor less favorably than its own investor
or investors of any third State with regard to “restitution,
indemnification, compensation or other settlement” in case
the foreign investor suffers losses due to, inter alia, a state of
national emergency. Article 4 of the BIT provides for a
specific expression of the national treatment and most
favored nation standard in relation to the compensation of
losses resulting from certain actions. Article 4 is merely
concerned with the situation where nationals of the host State
are indemnified or compensated, or benefit from a
settlement. In this context, foreign investors should not be
treated less favourably. Liability and compensation are thus
expressly mandated, not excused.307

383. In this context, the tribunal in CMS held under the
Argentina-U.S. BIT, which contains a similar provision as the
present Article 4 of the BIT, that:

The plain meaning of the Article [Article IV(3)] is to
provide a floor treatment for the investor in the
context of the measures adopted in respect of the
losses suffered in the emergency, not different from
the applied to nationals or other foreign investors.
The Article does not derogate from the Treaty rights
but rather ensures that any measures directed at

306. Reply, paragraphs 160 and 415-416.
307. Note in this context also the title of Article 4 of the BIT:
“Compensation for Losses”.

11s

offsetting or minimizing losses will be applied in a
non-discriminatory manner.3°8

384. The fact that Article 4 of the BIT contemplates the
state of national emergency as a distinct category of
exceptional circumstances is of no assistance to Argentina.
This fact was noted by the tribunal in LG&E in respect of a
similar provision in the Argentina-U.S. BIT (Article IV.3).309
However, the tribunal in LG&E did not accept Argentina’s
invocation of state of necessity on the basis of Article IV.3 of
the Argentina-U.S. BIT, but rather of Article XI for a limited
period of time (1 December 2001 — 26 April 2003).

 

385. The Tribunal notes that the Argentina-U.K. BIT does
not include a national security exception analogous to Article
XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT.3!° Consequently, the Tribunal
need not express an opinion as to a possible national security
exception, or its impact on a State’s obligation to pay

308. Exhibit JL-464 (CMS Gas Transmission Company v the Argentine
Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/OI/8, Award of 12 May 2005, paragraph
375); see also Enron Corporation Ponderosa Assets, L.P. v. The Argentine
Republic, ICSID Case No. ARB/O1/3, Award dated 15 May 2007,
paragraph 320, referring to Article IV(3) of the Argentina-U.S. BIT, which
contains similar wording as Article 4 of the present BIT: “The Tribunal
must note that the only meaning of Article IV(3) is to provide a minimum
treatment to foreign investments suffering losses in the host country by
the simultaneous interplay of national and most favored nation
treatment, and this is only in respect of measures the State “adopts in
relation to such losses”, that is corrective or compensatory measures.
AMT (paragraph 6.14), referring to Article IV(1)(b) of the U.S.—Zaire BIT,
which wording is similar to Article 4 of the present BIT and ing that
Article IV(I)(b) of the U.S—Zaire BIT “reinforce[s] further the
engagement of the responsibility of the State for ensuring the protection
and security of the investment made . . . in accordance with. . . the BIT.”

v The Argentine Republic (LG&E), ICSID Case No. ARB/O2/1, Decision
on Liability of 3 October 2006, paragraphs 243 and 261). Article IV(3) of
the Argentina-U.S. BIT provides: “Nationals or companies of either Party
whose investments suffer losses in the territory of the other Party owing
to war or other armed conflict, revolution, state of national emergency,
insurrection, civil disturbance or other similar events shall be accorded
treatment by such other Party no less favorable than that accorded to its
own nationals or companies or to nationals or companies of any third
country, whichever is the more favorable treatment, as regards any
measures it adopts in relation to such loss
310. Article XI of the Argentina-U.S. BIT: “This Treaty shall not preclude
the application by either Party of measures necessary for the
maintenance of public order, the fulfillment of its obligations with
respect to the maintenance or restoration of international peace or
security, or the protection of its own essential security interests.”

 

 

 

 

 

 

116

compensation for breaches of the BIT, as it was done in the
LG&E award, rendered under the Argentina-U.S. BIT.

386. Further, there is no support for Argentina’s submission
that, in the absence of an express provision, Article XI of the
Argentina-U.S. BIT should automatically be read into the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

387. Accordingly, the Tribunal concludes that Argentina
cannot invoke a state of emergency or state of necessity on the
basis of the BIT to excuse liability for the breach of Article 2.2
of the BIT.

B. The State of Necessity under Customary
International Law

388. Having reached the above conclusion, the Tribunal
turns now to Argentina’s alternative defense that it be
excused from liability based on the state of necessity under
customary international law.

389. As stated above, Argentina has contended in the
alternative that in the event the Tribunal should come to the
conclusion that there was a breach of the BIT, Argentina
should be exempt from liability in the light of the doctrine of
state of necessity or state of need under customary
international law, as codified in Article 25 of the International
Law Commission’s Draft Articles on Responsibility of States
for Internationally Wrongful Acts (hereinafter the “ILC Draft
Articles”). BG objected to the application of the doctrine of
necessity in this case and submitted that even if it were
applicable, its constituent elements, as set forth in Article 25
of the ILC Draft Articles, are not made out on the facts of this
case; ultimately, even if one were to concede Argentina's
defense of necessity, the legal consequence would be that
Argentina has an obligation to compensate BG for the losses it
incurred since the inception of the adopted measures,
pursuant to Article 27 of the ILC Draft Articles.

390. The Tribunal finds it useful to quote in full Article 25 of
the ILC Draft Articles:

1. Necessity may not be invoked by a State as a
ground for precluding the wrongfulness of an act not
in conformity with an international obligation of that
State unless the act:

117

(a) Is the only way for the State to safeguard
an essential interest against a grave and imminent
peril; and

(b) Does not seriously impair an essential
interest of the State or States towards which the
obligation exists, or of the international community
as a whole.

2. In any case, necessity may not be invoked by a
State as a ground for precluding wrongfulness if:

(a) The international obligation in question
excludes the possibility of invoking necessity; or

(b) The State has contributed to the
situation of necessity.

1. Summary of Parties’ Contentions
a.  Argentina’s Position

391. Argentina contended that the exoneration of a State
from international liability in case of a “state of necessity” is
expressly recognized by customary international law, as
codified in Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles. State of
necessity, according to Argentina, is a defense contemplated
in international law that is binding both for the Argentine
Republic and for the United Kingdom. In Argentina’s view, a
“state of necessity” exists where the State is compelled to
depart from an international obligation with another State in
order to preserve an essential state interest in a situation of
grave or imminent danger. In this connection, Argentina
contended that it complied with legal emergency criteria
provided for in its National Constitution.3!!

392. Argentina referred to several cases supporting its
position that the legal protections accorded to foreign
investors under bilateral investment treaties do not deprive
States parties of their sovereign powers to maintain public
order and address emergencies. Argentina submitted that
such cases suggest that State obligations to foreign investors
and investments are qualified by non-textual but legally

711 et seq.; Alegato Final, paragraphs 522-525.

operational understandings about the continuation of State
emergency powers and other State powers.3!2

393. Following the requirements set forth in Article 25 of
the ILC Draft Articles, Argentina contended that the
Argentine government was compelled to act due to a serious
emergency situation which compromised its essential
interests, its economic-financial survival, as well as social and
institutional stability. Argentina referred in particular to the
statements of Mr. Ratti and Mr. Simeonoff, explaining the
budgetary and financial limitations of the Argentine State and
the impoverishment of the population causing unprecedented
social unrest.3!3

394. Referring to the requirements of Article 25(1)(a) of the
ILC Draft Articles, Argentina further contended that the
measures adopted amounted to the only way of protecting the
essential interests of the State. In this regard it is Argentina’s
position that “the only way” criterion for a plea of necessity
can best be met by introducing a proportionality and rational
alternative test. Argentina expanded on its view of the
appropriate test to be applied by the Tribunal: (i) whether the
measures had a legitimate objective; (ii) whether the
measures were adapted to the pursuit of such objective; and
(iii) whether the government adopted the less disruptive
alternative. In Argentina’s view the pesification of dollar-
denominated obligations and the restructuring of the private
and public obligations was a proportionate and reasonable
solution within the context of the very serious emergency in
Argentina. Argentina pointed out that the existence of
diverging points of views as to whether the adopted measures
were the only way to cope with the crisis in late 2001 is not an
impediment to the application of the “state of necessity”
defense, as there will always be controversy regarding
governmental, economic and financial measures.3!4

395. Argentina also submitted that the measures it adopted
did not seriously affect any essential interest of any other
State, or of the international community.3!5

396. In addition, Argentina contended that none of the
international obligations invoked by BG exclude the state of
necessity, especially in the light of Article 4 of the BIT, which
foresees situations which may constitute a state of
necessity.3!6

397. Further, Argentina submitted that it has not
contributed to the occurrence of the “state of necessity”.
Argentina points to external factors that decisively led to the
emergency situation, including the rise in interest rates, the
crisis in other emerging markets, the devaluation in Brazil,
and the ensuing decline in exports. Argentina supported its
view by reference to the statement of its expert witness Prof.
Roubini.3"7

398. Finally, Argentina rejected BG’s contention that should
the defense of a state of necessity be accepted, the State
invoking it is indefectibly bound to redress the damages
suffered. Argentina contended that on the contrary, it would
make no sense to accept that the State acted in a state of
necessity, protecting its essential interests, and to demand
reparation, thus risking the very essential interests that the
State intended to protect. Objecting to BG's reliance on
Article 27 of the ILC Draft Articles, Argentina referred to its
expert witness Prof. Kingsbury, stating that the ILC Draft
Articles do not set forth that compensation should be granted
in all cases where the state of necessity is alleged.3!8

b. _BG’s Position
399. BG objected to Argentina’s contentions.

400. As a preliminary point, BG submitted that the U.K.
formally opposed to the inclusion by the ILC of a provision on
“necessity” (i.e., the present version of Article 25 of the ILC
Draft Articles). BG highlighted that the ILC Draft Articles are
a non-binding codification of customary international law. As
a consequence, Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles can have

317. Memorial de Contestacién, paragraphs 718-725; Alegato Final,
paragraphs 539-542.

318. Alegato Final, paragraphs 543-548.

120

no application in bilateral relations involving the U.K., and
therefore no role in a claim under the present BIT. BG
characterized the U.K. as a “persistent objector’ to the rule
set forth in Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles.3'9

401. Further, BG criticized Argentina’s understanding that
the State’s obligations under a BIT become qualified by that
State’s powers to take measures in a situation of emergency
under a national law of general application. In BG's view this
places Article 8(4) of the BIT and Argentine law on a footing
of equality, a result that would be inconsistent with Article 27
of the Vienna Convention according to which treaty
obligations preempt conflicting national law. Further, the lack
of workable definitions of and distinctions between
“emergency” and “necessity” would grant the State a self-
judging power to escape its international obligations. BG
confirmed, though, that some BITs, including U.K. BITs, do
expressly grant a right of derogation in times of “extreme
emergency”, and that right is both explicit and carefully
circumscribed in the relevant texts. However, the present BIT
grants no such right.320

402. As tothe content of Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles,
BG submitted that Argentina bears the onus of proving that
all requirements of the doctrine of necessity as reflected in
Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles have been met without
interruption from January 2002 (when the Emergency Law
was enacted) to the present day.3?!

403. In focusing on specific questions with regard to the
requirements of Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles, BG
contended that Argentina is debarred from invoking Article
25 of the ILC Draft Articles because it failed to satisfy the
general requirements of the second paragraph of this
provision. Given the object and the purpose of the BIT,
Argentina may not dispose of guarantees freely extended to
attract BG's long-term investment on the argument that
certain risks have materialized, when the very purpose of the
guarantees was to transfer the associated risks to
Argentina.322

404. Further, BG contended that Argentina contributed to
its economic crisis. BG submitted that the evidence shows

320. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraphs 302-309.

321. Reply, paragraphs 430 er seq.; Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 310.
322. Reply, paragraphs 441-447.

121

that Argentina’s crisis was largely brought about by successive
government failures to address chronic and serious structural
economic problems. Relying, inter alia, on Professor
Roubini’s expert report and an IMF study, BG submitted that
several endogenous causes contributed to Argentina’s crisis,
highlighting fiscal problems and labor-market “rigidities”.
According to the IMF study, for instance, the principal causes
for the crisis were home-grown and the “chief locus of
vulnerability [of the Argentine economy] was the increase in
public-sector indebtedness."323

405. BG also took exception with Argentina’s understanding
of Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Draft Articles. Specifically, BG
disagreed with Argentina’s assertion that the words “the only
way” are not to be read on their face but should be interpreted
as importing a test of “proportionality and _ rational
alternatives”. In BG’s view the words “the only way” are
clearly designed to discourage abuse of the doctrine of
necessity. BG further stated that Argentina’s reading of
Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Draft Articles confirms the risk of
abuse of the doctrine of necessity historically expressed by the
U.K.. BG contended that the findings of an ICSID tribunal
and the ICJ confirm the only interpretation that is consistent
with the express language, negotiating history, and legislative
intent of Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Draft Articles. In any
event, BG indicated that the “pesificacién” and freezing of
MetroGAS' tariffs fail Argentina’s proportionality test.324

406. Finally, BG contended that Argentina was unable to
prove the “grave and imminent peril” that allegedly forced
Argentina to take the measures it took. Argentina’s economic
difficulties, acute as they were from December of 2001 to
January of 2002, never mounted to a “grave and imminent
peril” to an “essential interest” of the Argentine State within
the meaning of Article 25(1)(a) of the ILC Draft Articles as
illustrated by the fact that: (i) the institutions of Government
continued to operate at all times in accordance with the
Constitution; (ii) the GDP per capita on purchasing power
parity terms remained the highest in Latin America,
according to the IMF; and (iii) since May 2002 the economic
indices have reached historic records surpassing pre-crisis
levels, particularly in the case of GDP and unemployment. It
is thus not possible to argue that an “economic crisis”

continues to exist in Argentina and consequently Argentina
cannot invoke necessity to excuse the measures it adopted.325

2. The Tribunal’s Findings

407. In the Tribunal’s view, Argentina’s defense relating to
Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles fails whether the Tribunal
rejects or accepts the application of this provision.

408. Article 25 may relate exclusively to international
obligations between sovereign States. From this perspective,
Article 25 would be of little assistance to Argentina as it
would not disentitle BG, a private investor, from the right to
compensation under the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

409. Furthermore, the Commentary to the ILC Draft
Articles indicates that a defense based on necessity is
precluded “where the international obligation in question
explicitly or implicitly excludes reliance on necessity.”326 It
can be argued that the Argentina-U.K. BIT implies such an
exclusion. Thus, Argentina would not be entitled to invoke
necessity to unilaterally revoke vested rights (e.g., a dollar
denominated tariff and economic equilibrium) designed
precisely to operate in situations where a run on the currency
would lead to a situation of necessity. There is no question
that Argentina is entitled to adopt such measures as it deems
appropriate to emerge from the state of emergency. However,
it remains obligated to pay compensation. This is one view as
to how bilateral investment treaties operate to induce foreign
investment. Assuming that necessity were to justify some fair
and non-discriminatory measure by Argentina, an obligation
to compensate would still obtain by virtue of the BIT.227

410. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to apply Article
25,328 it must be recalled that this “is a most exceptional
remedy subject to the very strict conditions because

326 Exhibit JL-358 (United Nations Report of the International Law
Commission, 53rd session (2001), A/56/10 at p. 204).

327. Certainly, where the bilateral investment treaty at hand contait
exculpatory provision and such provision finds application, compensation
is not payable to the extent that such provision exonerates that party from
liability.

“persistent objector” to this provision (Post-Hearing Brief, paragraphs
296-301).

 

 

    

123

otherwise it would open the door to elude any international
obligation” 22° The tribunal in LG&E said it appropriately:

The concept of state of necessity and the
requirements for its admissibility lead to the idea of
prevention: the State covers itself against the risk of
suffering certain damages. Hence, the possibility of
alleging the state of necessity is closely bound by the
requirement that there should be a serious and
imminent threat and no means to avoid it. Such
circumstances, in principle, have been left to the
State’s subjective appreciation, a conclusion accepted
by the International Law Commission. Nevertheless,
the Commission was well aware of the fact that this
exception, requiring admissibility, has been
frequently abused by States, thus opening up a very
easy opportunity to violate the international law with
impunity. The Commission has set in its Draft
Articles on State Responsibility very restrictive
conditions to account for its admissibility, reducing
such subjectivity.33°

411. The Tribunal does not believe that Argentina has met
the “very restrictive conditions”, given that measures adopted
by Argentina included: (i) luring BG and other investors to
accept a temporary suspension of the dollar denominated
tariff and the adjustment mechanism by indicating that the
measures would be temporary; (ii) threatening companies
that resorted to arbitration; (iii) attempting to force investors
which commenced arbitration to withdraw these proceedings
as a condition to negotiations; and (iv) setting up a
mechanism for the revision of the concessions that was never
intended to restore the conditions of Argentina’s initial
representations.

412. Accordingly, whether the Tribunal accepts or rejects
the application of Article 25 of the ILC Draft Articles, the
result is the same: Argentina may not invoke the “state of
necessity” doctrine under customary international law to
excuse liability for breach of Article 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K.
BIT, or its obligation to pay compensation under the treaty.

v The Argentine Republic (LG&E) (ICSID Case No. ARB/02/1) Decision
on Liability dated 3 October 2006 (paragraph 248). The tribunal in LG&E
did not rely on the ILC Draft Articles for concluding that Argentina can
invoke state of necessity. Instead, that tribunal relied on Article XI of the
Argentina-U.S. BIT, a provision which, as noted above, does not exist in
the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

 

124

X. Damages

413. Considering the Tribunal’s findings above that
Argentina has breached the BIT with respect to the standard
of fair and equitable treatment and by adopting unreasonable
measures under Article 2.2 of the BIT, the Tribunal now turns
to: (i) the appropriate standard for determining damages; and
(ii) the quantification of any such damages.

414. Claimant seeks: “. . . full compensation for Argentina's
breaches of the Treaty, which amounts to the loss in the fair
market value of its investment in MetroGAS caused by the
Measures.” 33!

415. Claimant's expert, Mr. Wood-Collins, applied a
discounted cash flow (DCF) methodology to calculate “. . .
that the Measures have reduced the value of BG's investment
in MetroGAS as at 1 January 2002 by US$238.1 million.”332
This is the amount of damages sought by Claimant for the
alleged violation by Argentina of Article 2.2 and/or Article 5.1
of the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

416. Argentina took the position that:

a) any liability is excused by “unforeseeable changed
circumstances” (teoria de la imprevisién) under
Article 1198 of the Argentine Civil Code, an issue
already addressed by the Tribunal in Chapter V
above;

b) the renegotiation process would yield such
restitution as BG may be entitled to;333

c) BGis not entitled to full reparation;3*4 and
d) the Wood-Collins report is flawed.335

417. The Tribunal acknowledges that MetroGAS may wish
to make its peace with Argentina in the context of the
domestic renegotiation process. This, however, has not
occurred. This Tribunal continues to be seized in this
arbitration with a mandate under the Argentina-U.K. BIT to

125

determine the standard and quantum of damages to which
BG might be entitled.

418. The Tribunal has concluded that Argentina did not
breach Article 5 of the BIT and so this award deals only with
reparation for the breach of Article 2.2 of the BIT.39¢

A. Standard

419. Unlike Article 5 (Expropriation), Article 2 of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT does not provide a_ standard for
compensation. Claimant relied on international law and the
awards of prior tribunals in support for its position that it is
entitled to the fair market value of its investment in
MetroGAS.

420. BG argued that the reparation standard for
expropriation set out in Article 5 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT
applies equally to a breach of Article 2.2 of the treaty. BG
found support for the automatic extension of the standard of
Article 5 in CMS v Argentina. The argument appears as
follows in BG’s Post-Hearing Brief (footnotes omitted):337

Article 5(1) of the Treaty defines such compensation
in the event of an expropriation as the genuine, or fair
market, value of the investment, immediately before
the expropriation, plus interest until the date of
payment. The Treaty contains no such provision for
compensation payable in respect of a breach of Article
2(2). However, when faced with a similar case of
cumulative breaches of treaty, the tribunal in CMS v
Argentina resorted to the same standard of “fair
market value” to determine the compensation due,
noting that:

“while this standard figures prominently in respect of
expropriation, it is not excluded in other cases where
the effect of the breach results in important long term
losses.”

421. This reasoning is scant. In fact, principles of treaty
hermeneutics militate for the conclusion that one should not
read into Article 2.2 of the BIT a standard which Argentina
and the U.K. expressly confined to Article 5 of the BIT.

336. As found by the Tribunal in Sections A and C of Chapter VIII of this
award.
337. Post-Hearing Brief, paragraph 331.

126

422. For other reasons, however, “fair market value” can be
relied upon as a standard to measure damages for breach of
the obligation to accord investors treatment in accordance
with Article 2.2 of the BIT. While the Tribunal is disinclined
to automatically import such standard from Article 5 of the
BIT, this standard of compensation is nonetheless available
by reference to customary international law.

423. BG's analysis of international law focuses on the
principle established in 1928 by the Permanent Court of
International Justice in the Case Concerning the Factory at
Chorz6w.*38 This matter addressed the issue of compensation
for the expropriation of a nitrate factory at Chorzéw in Upper
Silesia.

424. In its decision on jurisdiction of 26 July 1927, the
Permanent Court found that reparation is due for failure to
apply a convention even where the convention itself is silent
on the issue:339

It is a principle of international law that a breach of
an engagement involves an obligation to make
reparation in an adequate form. Reparation therefore
is the indispensable complement of a failure to apply
a convention and there is no necessity for this to be
stated in the convention itself.

425. The Permanent Court elaborated further on the
standard of reparation in adjudicating the merits of the
dispute on 13 September 1928:340

The essential principle contained in the actual notion
of an illegal act — a principle which seems to be
established by international practice and in particular
by the decisions of arbitral tribunals — is that
reparation must, as far as possible, wipe out all the
consequences of the illegal act and reestablish the
situation which would, in all probability, have existed
if the act had not been committed. Restitution in
kind, or, if this is not possible, payment of a sum
corresponding to the value which a restitution in kind
would bear; the award, if need be, of damages for loss

sustained which would not be covered by restitution
in kind or payment in place of it — such are the
principles which should serve to determine the
amount of compensation due for an act contrary to
international law.

426. As stated above, Factory at Chorzéw is also about
expropriation. However, its vitality was energized and its
scope broadened beyond the law of takings by Article 31 of the
ILC Draft Articles:*4!

1. The responsible State is under an obligation to
make full reparation for the injury caused by the
internationally wrongful act.

2. Injury includes any damage, whether material or
moral, caused by the internationally wrongful act of a
State.

427. Under this rule, which seeks to codify customary
international law, the obligation of the responsible State to
make full reparation relates to the “. . . injury caused by the
internationally wrongful act.” The injury, as stated by
paragraph 2 of Article 31, includes any material damage

caused by the wrongful act. Material damage here “. . . refers
to damage to property .. . which is assessable in financial
terms.”342

428. The damage, nonetheless, must be the consequence or
proximate cause of the wrongful act.343 Damages that are “too
indirect, remote, and uncertain to be appraised” are to be
excluded.344 In line with this principle, the Tribunal would
add that an award for damages which are speculative would
equally run afoul of “full reparation” under the ILC Draft
Articles.

429. The Tribunal will be guided by these principles.
Provided that the damage is not speculative, indirect, remote
or uncertain, the Arbitral Tribunal may have recourse to such
methodology as it deems appropriate in order to achieve the
full reparation for the injury caused to BG by Respondent's
breach of Article 2.2 of the Argentina-U.K. BIT.

B. Calculation
430. BG's expert Mr. Wood-Collins:

a) assessed the loss in the fair market value of BG’s
investment in MetroGAS as at | January 2002;

b) adjusted the result of (a) above to account for the
part of the loss which might be borne by the
creditors of GASA and calculated BG’s “historical
loss” for the period of January 2002 to December
2005.345

431. The Tribunal now turns to these calculations.
1. The GASA Debt Restructuring

432. As indicated above, GASA owns 70% of MetroGAS and
BG owns 54.7% of GASA. Thus, BG's share of MetroGAS
owned through GASA is 38.3%. Combined with the 6.8% of
MetroGAS that BG owns directly, BG’s share of MetroGAS is
45.1% 346

433. At the time that the Emergency Law was promulgated,
GASA had US$70 million in outstanding debt. This debt was
purchased in 2004 and 2005 by two investment funds,
Ashmore and Marathon. On 7 December 2005, GASA entered
into an agreement with the Ashmore and Marathon Funds to
restructure its debt.347

434. Pursuant to this agreement, GASA’s debt was to be
cancelled in exchange for: (i) the issue by GASA and/or
transfer by its shareholders to Ashmore Funds of 30% of
GASA’s shares; (ii) the transfer to Ashmore Funds of
approximately 3.65% of shares in MetroGAS held by GASA;
(iii) the transfer to Marathon Funds of approximately 15.35 %

345. The Post-Hearing Brief updates the calculation to 1 September 2006
(paragraph 456).

346. 45.11% more exactly.

347. Exhibit J-604. “Ashmore Funds” and “Marathon Funds” are terms

129

of shares in MetroGAS held by GASA. After the restructuring,
BG’s investment in MetroGAS would be reduced by 18.8%,
from 45.1% to 26.3%.

435. This transaction is subject to approvals in Argentina.
Section 4.2(i) of the Master Restructuring Agreement
provides that:

4.2 Conditions Precedent to the Consummation of
the Restructuring. The Closing is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the following conditions:

ted

. . . Governmental Approvals. (i) The Company
and each of the Creditors shall have received a
certified copy of each authorization, consent, order,
approval, license, ruling, permit, exemption, filing or
registration specified on Schedule | hereto. . . . (ii)
The New GASA By-Laws and the issuance by the
Company of New Equity shall have been approved by
the Comisién Nacional de Valores.

436. It is a matter of record that not all required approvals
have been issued by the Argentine authorities and that none
have been waived. The transactions contemplated by the
Master Restructuring Agreement have therefore not closed
and the restructuring of the GASA debt has not been
consummated. In addition, the creditors are now entitled to
terminate under Section 7.2 of the Master Restructuring
Agreement:

7.2. Termination.
[..]

b) Termination by the Creditors. Each of the
following events and circumstances shall be a
“Creditor Event of Terminator” hereunder:

ted

(vii) The Closing shall not have occurred by one
year from the Execution Date [7 December 2006]
other than as a result of non-compliance by a Creditor
with its obligations hereunder.

437. Under the circumstances, this award cannot assume
that the necessary approvals will be secured and there is no
guarantee that the Master Restructuring Agreement will
remain in force. The Arbitral Tribunal will therefore proceed

130

on the basis that no restructuring of the GASA debt has been
successfully completed.

2. Loss in Fair Market Value

438. Using DCF analysis, Mr. Wood-Collins valued BG's
45.1% investment in MetroGAS immediately before and after
promulgation of the Emergency Law.%48 The difference
between the two valuations, adjusted to consider GASA debt,
yields the following result:349

Damages to BG’s investment in MetroGAS as at 1 January 2002
Total Loss at 1 January 2002
Future value of BG's MetroGAS shares

Without Measures US$277.7 m

With Measures US$2.3 m

Damage US$275.4 m

Without Measures US$239.4 m
With Measures US$1.3 m
Damage US$238.1 m.

Notes
1. Cost of discharging BG's 54.7% share of GASA’s US$70.0 m debt.
2. Cost of reducing BG’s share in MetroGAS from 45.1% to 26.3%.

439. This Tribunal has reached the conclusion that the
Wood-Collins Report leads to a result which is uncertain and
speculative. Specifically, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Mr.
Wood-Collins’ US$1.3 million valuation of BG's investment in
Argentina in his “With Measures” scenario.

440. The Wood-Collins Report dismisses valuations of
US$21.3million and US$18.8 million with __ little
explanation.*5° More importantly, during testimony, Mr.
Wood-Collins failed to satisfactorily reconcile his valuation of

348. Although Mr. Wood-Collins refers to “With Measures” and “Without
Measures” scenarios, his “Without Measures” valuation does not consider
any of the pre-Emergency Law measures listed in his Letter of Instruction
(Annex A, Wood-Collins Report).

US$1.3 million with the implied value of the
Ashmore/Marathon transaction, whereby US$38.2 million of
debt was cancelled in exchange for an 18.8% interest in
MetroGAS.35! Regardless of the motivations of these funds,
BG was willing to relinquish an 18.8% indirect interest in
MetroGAS in exchange for a US$38.2 million write-off. This
transaction would result in a post-Emergency Law value of
BG's 45.11% interest in MetroGAS of US$91,825,244.15.352 In
the Tribunal’s view this transaction provides an objective
indication of the value of BG's investment after the
Emergency Law.

441. The record also includes evidence of a transaction
involving an interest in MetroGAS before the enactment of
the Emergency Law.353 Mr. Wood-Collins considered this
transaction:354

4.22 On 12 July 1998, Perez Companc sold 25% of
GASA for US$75 million. This implies that
100% of GASA was worth US$300 million. At
that time GASA had debts of US$130 million
and its sole asset was 70% of the shares of
MetroGAS. As such, those shares in MetroGAS
must have been valued at US$430 million.

 

4.23 Consequently, 100% of the MetroGAS shares
must have been valued at US$614.3 million and
therefore BG's 45.1% share of MetroGAS had an
implied value of US$277.0 million.

442. Considering that BG’s exact total (direct and indirect)
ownership interest in MetroGAS is 45.11%, the implied value
of such interest is actually US$277,110,730. It is the
Tribunal’s view that this is also a better proxy of the value of
BG’s investment before promulgation of the Emergency Law.

443. Consequently, the Tribunal’s calculations based on
actual transactions yield the following damage to BG's
investment:

351. Tr. Wood-Collins 1265:13 to 1279:16, 1291:13-1293:13.

352. (1) $70,000,000 (BG's share of the GASA debt) x 54.67% (BG's
ownership in GASA) = $38,269,000; (2) $38,269,000 (value to BG of
cancellation of its share of the GASA debt) / 18.8% (capitalization of the
GASA debt to Ashmore and Marathon) = $203,558,510.64; (3)
$203,558,510.64 (total implicit value of MetroGAS) x 45.11% (total BG
interest in MetroGAS) = $91,825,244.15

444. Argentina shall thus pay BG damages in the sum of
US$185,285,485.85.

445. In its Reply, BG articulated its prayer for damages as
follows:355

(. . .) In view of the foregoing, BG requests that the
Tribunal:

(.)

(d) Order that Argentina compensate BG in the
sum equivalent to $238.1 million, plus interest
at the average interest rate applicable to US six
month certificates of deposit, compounded
semi-annually;

(.)

446. It is noteworthy that BG’s Reply does not include an
independent claim for historical loss. In its Post-Hearing
Brief, BG further stated the following with respect to
historical loss:35°

(©. .) the historical loss forms an important
component of BG's total loss, and has not been
challenged.

447. Thus, because the Tribunal has already adjudicated
BG's claim as articulated, there is no need for the award to
independently address historical loss. Nonetheless, to the
extent that BG’s pleadings could be interpreted as asserting
an independent claim for historical loss, the Tribunal records
that there is no support for any such claim.

448. Mr. Wood-Collins’ calculation of historical loss results
from certain projections prepared by MetroGAS in September
of 2001 (the MetroGAS 2001 Projections). The date of these
projections is unclear. Claimant stated that they were
prepared by MetroGAS on 21 September 2001.357 Mr. Wood-

Collins dates them on 27 September 2001.358 However, the
actual “MetroGAS spreadsheet” that Mr. Wood-Collins used
as a source for his calculations is not on the record.

449. The MetroGAS 2001 Projections as presented by
Annex E of the Wood-Collins Report are oblivious to the
economic crisis that preceded the measures adopted by
Argentina in January of 2002. Annex E projects a historical
spike in the payment of dividends by MetroGAS (i.e., over
US$280 million for the 2002-2005 period)%*? precisely at a
time (September Of 2001) where internal and external shocks
rendered the Argentine economy particularly vulnerable. As
indicated in paragraph 54 of this award, Argentina could not
address the combined effect of these shocks through
exchange rate or monetary policies.

450. This is a fact that the business community could not
ignore even in the absence of the measures that Argentina
adopted a few months later. The Tribunal recalls here that the
MetroGAS 2001 Projections were prepared by MetroGAS at a
time when the adjustment of tariffs for US inflation had
already been suspended and was subject to challenge before
the Argentine courts.

451. From a legal perspective, there is no evidence on the
record of a dividend policy approved pursuant to the
corporate procedures set out in the By-Laws of MetroGAS.36°

452. For these reasons, to the extent that Claimant has
made an independent claim for historical loss, the Tribunal
finds that it is not reasonable to rely on the MetroGAS 2001
Projections in support for any such claim. In addition, the
Tribunal notes that implicit in the valuation of the Pérez
Companc and Ashmore/Marathon transactions discussed
above is an expectation of cash flow to equity.

453. For these reasons, the Tribunal does not enter any
decision for payment of damages in excess of the sum set out
in paragraph 444 above.

358. Wood-Collins Report, Annex E.
359. These payments also exceed the 95% dividends policy adopted by
MetroGAS in its “2001 Plan Assumptions” set out in Exhibit CRA-10 of
the Wood-Collins Report.

360. Exhibit J-117.

C. Interest

454. This Tribunal agrees with BG that interest at a
reasonable commercial rate is appropriate to compensate BG
in full for Argentina’s breach of the Argentina-U.K. BIT. The
Tribunal further finds, however, that interest should run from
6 January 2002, the date of promulgation of the Emergency
Law, and not from | January 2002, as argued by BG, until
payment of this award by the Republic of Argentina.

455. The rate of interest is a function of the instrument in
which BG could have reasonably invested funds available to it
on 6 January 2002. The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Wood-
Collins that investment in a highly secure, dollar
denominated, liquid and short-term instrument would have
enabled BG to rapidly redeploy its funds.*' The Tribunal
further accepts that US Treasury six-month certificates of
deposit meet these criteria and that interest should be
compounded semi-annually. The Tribunal finally notes that
Argentina did not address BG’s claim to interest or the
reasonableness of assuming US Treasury certificates of
deposit, and it did not challenge the authorities relied upon
by BG in support for its position on compound interest.36
The Tribunal finds that these authorities are persuasive.

456. The Tribunal notes in particular that the standard of
“full reparation” articulated in Section X.A above would not
be achieved if the award were to deprive Claimant of
compound interest. If invested in January of 2002, the sums
awarded would have earned compound interest — investment
in six month certificates of deposit involves earning
compound interest.

361. Wood-Collins Report, paragraph 8.2.
362. Exhibit JL-190 (FA Mann, “Compound Interest as an Item of
Damage in International Law” (1988), 21 University of California Davis
Law Review 577); Exhibit JL-268 (JY Gotanda, warding Interest in
International Arbitration”, (1966), 90 American Journal of International
Law 40); Exhibit JL-350 (Metalclad Corp v The United Mexican States,
Case No ARB(AF)/97/1, Award of 30 August 2000, paragraphs 128 and
131); Exhibit JL-328 (Emilio Agustin Maffezini v The Kingdom of Spain,
ICSID Case No ARB/97/7, Award of 13 November 2000, , paragraphs 96-
97); Exhibit JL-322 (Compafiia del Desarrollo de Santa Elena, SA v The

2000, paragraphs 128-130); Exhibit JL-464 (CMS Gas Transmission
Company v the Argentine Republic, ICSID Case No ARB/O1/8, Award of
12 May 2005, paragraph 471).

 

135

457. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that Respondent
shall pay Claimant interest on the sum of US$185,285,485.85
from 6 January 2002 until the date of payment, at the
average interest rate applicable to US six-month certificates
of deposit, compounded semi-annually.

XI. Costs

458. BG brought a claim for US$238.1 million plus interest.
This award finds for BG in the amount of US$185.3 plus
interest. BG therefore prevailed with respect to 78% of the
amount it claimed.

459. As to jurisdiction and admissibility, while this Tribunal
has entered an affirmative finding on jurisdiction, it also
concluded that BG does not have standing to bring “claims to
money” and “claims to performance”, or to assert other rights,
derived from the MetroGAS License (see paragraph 217
above).

460. Under the circumstances and pursuant to Article 40 of
the UNCITRAL Rules, the Tribunal finds that it is reasonable
for Argentina to bear 70% of: (i) the costs of the arbitration as
fixed in paragraph 462 below; and (ii) BG's legal fees and
expenses.

461. Pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, the
fees of the Tribunal are hereby fixed as follows:

a) Guillermo Aguilar Alvarez,
US$323,168.13
b) Albert Jan van den Berg,
US$328,308.14
c) Alejandro Garro,
US$197,095.17
462. In addition, the expenses of the Arbitral Tribunal
amount to US$261,907.82. This sum includes the fees and
expenses of the Administrative Secretary, the costs of
translating the award, and the administrative fee of
$59,312.50 paid to ICSID as custodian of the funds deposited

by the Parties pursuant to Article 41 of the UNCITRAL Rules
(Section 16 of Procedural Order No. 2). Moreover, the costs of

136

the Preliminary Conference and of the evidentiary hearing are
US$126,020.74. This yields a total for the costs of the
arbitration, including Tribunal fees and expenses, and costs
of the Preliminary Conference and evidentiary hearing, of
US$1,236,500.00.

463. The Parties paid the deposit fixed by the Tribunal to
cover its fees and expenses (Article 41 of the UNCITRAL
Rules) as follows:

a) Claimant:
US$618,250.00
b) Respondent:

US$618,250.0
Total: US$1,236,500.00

464. There was a shortfall for payment of arbitral fees after
16 July 2006, caused by events set out in the Tribunal's letter
to the Parties of 25 September 2007. All three arbitrators and
the Tribunal's Administrative Secretary have waived a portion
of their fees in order not to burden the Parties with a request
for supplemental payments. Accordingly, nothing remains
payable.

465. In addition, BG submitted a claim for legal fees and
expenses in the sum_ of US$624,390.00963 and
GB£3,448,773.00. In the Tribunal’s view, these sums are
reasonable.

466. Accordingly, to comply with the Tribunal’s order as set
out in paragraph 460 above, Respondent shall pay Claimant:

a) the sum of US$247,300.00 for costs of the
arbitration as fixed in paragraph 462 above; and

b) the sum of US$437,073.00 and GB£2,414,141.10
as legal fees and expenses incurred by Claimant in
this arbitration.

363. This compri
updated in BG's cos

 
 

the amounts set out in paragraphs 461 to 464, as
submission of 4 June 2007.

137

XII. Decision

467. For the foregoing reasons, the Arbitral Tribunal
unanimously renders the following award:

(dd) Subject to decision number (2) below, this Arbitral
Tribunal has jurisdiction with respect to all of BG
Group Plc.’s claims which are admissible in this
arbitration.

(2) BG Group Plc. does not have standing to seize this
Tribunal with “claims to money” and “claims to
performance” under the Argentina-U.K. BIT, or to
assert in this arbitration any other right derived from
the MetroGAS License.

(3) The Republic of Argentina breached Article 2.2 of the
Argentina-U.K. BIT.

damages to BG Group Plc.’s investment claimed in this
arbitration.

(5) The Republic of Argentina shall pay BG Group Plc.
interest on the sum set out in decision (4) above from 6
January 2002 until the date of payment, at the average

deposit, compounded semi-annually.

(6) The Republic of Argentina shall pay BG Group Plc. the
sum of US$247,300.00 for costs of the arbitration.

(7) The Republic of Argentina shall pay BG Group Plc. the
sums of US$437,073.00 (four hundred thirty seven
thousand and seventy three US dollars) and
GBE£2,414,141.10 (two million four hundred and
fourteen thousand one hundred and forty one British
Pounds and 10/100) for legal fees and expenses
incurred by BG Group Plc. in this arbitration.

(8) All other claims are rejected.
