INTRODUCTION

A. The Claimant

Eureko B.V. (“Eureko” or “Claimant”) is a Dutch private company with limited
liability, having its statutory seat in Amsterdam and its head offices in Zeist,

The Netherlands.

The group of companies headed by Eureko is a financial services group that offers a
range of insurance products internationally, including health insurance, life and non-life
insurance, pension products, asset management and banking. Eureko operates in the
Slovak Republic through two companies: (i) Union poistovia as.
(‘Union Insurance”), incorporated in 1991 by the Government of the Slovak Republic
and privatised in 1992, in which Eureko acquired shares in 1997; and (ii) Union
zdravotna poist’oviia, a.s (“Union Healthcare”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Eureko
incorporated in 2006 and funded by Eureko.' This arbitration primarily concerns

Eureko’s investment in Union Healthcare.

Eureko is represented in this arbitration by Marnix Leijten, Rogier Schellaars, Albert
Marsman, and Patrick Ploeger of De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V., Claude
Debussylaan 80, 1082 MD Amsterdam, The Netherlands; and by René Visser and
Nynke Hupkens of Eureko B.V.

B. The Respondent

The Slovak Republic (“Slovak Republic” or “Respondent”) is a sovereign State,
formerly a part of the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic. It gained independence on
1 January 1993 and joined the European Union (“EU”) on 1 May 2004. The Slovak
Republic is a multiparty parliamentary democracy, with executive power lying with

the government headed by a Prime Minister.”

Respondent is represented in this arbitration by Andrej Solar and Andrea Holikova of
the Slovak Republic Ministry of Finance, Stefanovicova 5, 817 82 Bratislava, the
Slovak Republic; Martin Maisner, Milo Olik, Pavel Cernohorsky and David Fyrbach

Ave. NW, Washington, DC 20004-2400, United States of America.

C. The Dispute

Claimant initiated this arbitration on the basis of claims that the Slovak Republic has
violated the 1992 Agreement on Encouragement and Reciprocal Protection of
Investments between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Czech and Slovak

Federal Republic (“Treaty” or “BIT’)?

Claimant complains that various legislative measures introduced by Respondent after
a change in government in July 2006 constituted a systematic reversal of the 2004
liberalisation of the Slovak health insurance market that had prompted Eureko to
invest in the Slovak Republic’s health insurance sector. According to Claimant, these
actions destroyed the value of Eureko’s investment. Claimant characterises the
measures as constituting an unlawful indirect expropriation of its investment in Union
Healthcare, in breach of Article 5 of the BIT. Claimant further alleges that
Respondent’s conduct amounts to a violation of the BIT’s standards of protection
contained in its provisions on (i) fair and equitable treatment including as to non-
discrimination (Article 3(1) of the BIT), (ii) full protection and security (Article 3(2)
of the BIT), and (iii) free transfer of profits and dividends (Article 4 of the BIT).
Claimant seeks, inter alia, compensation in an amount exceeding €100 million for
damages suffered as a result of the Slovak Republic’s alleged breaches of the Treaty,
as well as costs, interest and a declaration to the effect that the Slovak Republic has

breached and continues to breach its obligations under the Treaty.”

The Slovak Republic challenged the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the dispute under the
principles of ratione personae and ratione materiae and raised a further jurisdictional
objection based on the Slovak Republic’s membership of the EU. It denies that it has
expropriated or otherwise violated any obligation—international or otherwise—

purportedly owed to Eureko, that any of Eureko’s claims are viable as a matter of fact

and law, and that Eureko has suffered any cognizable damages or injury. Respondent

asserts that it has complied fully with all applicable international legal requirements.®

In accordance with the procedure agreed with the Parties, this Award on Jurisdiction,
Arbitrability and Suspension deals exclusively with Respondent’s jurisdictional
objection based on the Slovak Republic’s membership of the EU. In essence,
Respondent argues that, as a matter of international law, EU law, Slovak law and
German law, the accession of the Slovak Republic to the EU in May 2004 terminated
the BIT or rendered its arbitration clause inapplicable, and accordingly this Tribunal
lacks jurisdiction to hear the dispute (the “Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection’).

Claimant denies this.

PROCEDURAL HISTORY

A. Commencement of the Arbitration

Pursuant to Article 8 of the Treaty and Article 3 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules,
Eureko sent a Notice of Arbitration to Respondent on 1 October 2008, which

Respondent received on 3 October 2008.
Article 8 of the Treaty provides in the relevant parts as follows:

(1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible,
be settled amicably.

(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in
paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not
been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either
party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.

(5) The arbitration tribunal shall determine its own procedure applying the
arbitration rules of the United Nations Commission for International Trade
Law (UNCITRAL).

(6) The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into
account in particular though not exclusively:

e the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

e the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements
between the Contracting Parties;

e the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;

e the general principles of international law.

B. Constitution of the Tribunal

12. By letter dated 17 October 2008, Claimant appointed Professor Albert Jan van den

Berg as the first arbitrator.

13. On 26 November 2008, Respondent appointed His Excellency Judge Peter Tomka as

the second arbitrator.

14. On 20 December 2008, the co-arbitrators jointly appointed Professor Vaughan Lowe QC

as the presiding arbitrator.

15. The Tribunal and the Parties signed Terms of Appointment on 5 March 2009,
confirming the constitution of the Tribunal and designating the International Bureau
of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“PCA”) to act as registry in the arbitration. It

was agreed that the language of the proceedings would be English.”

16. The Tribunal held a procedural hearing with the Parties on 19 March 2009 at the
Peace Palace in The Hague. On that date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order
No. 1, taking into account the agreements reached at the hearing. In Procedural Order
No. 1, the Tribunal determined Frankfurt, Germany to be the place (seat) of the
arbitration, while reserving the Tribunal’s right to conduct hearings and meetings at
any location considered appropriate.* Procedural Order No. | also provided, inter
alia, for a preliminary schedule for the Parties’ submissions, for the use of
teleconference as a means of communication between the Tribunal and the Parties, for

the methods of production of evidence and for confidentiality undertakings.

17. By letter dated 7 April 2009, Judge Tomka notified his co-arbitrators and the Parties
of his decision to resign as arbitrator in the present case, with effect from 30 April
2009. On 6 May 2009, Respondent notified the appointment of Mr. Van Vechten
Veeder QC as substitute arbitrator, who formally accepted the appointment on 18 May
2009. The PCA drew the Parties’ attention to the fact that both Mr. Veeder and
Professor Lowe are members of Essex Court Chambers. By e-mails from Respondent
dated 27 May 2009 and from Claimant dated 5 June 2009, both Parties confirmed in

writing that they had no objection to Mr. Veeder’s appointment.

C. Written Proceedings

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 1, Claimant filed its Statement of Claim,

with accompanying exhibits, on 16 June 2009.

Respondent filed its Statement of Defence, with accompanying exhibits, on 30 October
2009. In addition to rejecting Claimant’s claims, Respondent asserted that Eureko had
not presented sufficient facts to establish either jurisdiction ratione personae or ratione
materiae? Respondent also introduced the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, arguing
that the Slovak Republic’s membership in the EU deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction
because, inter alia: (i) the European Community treaty (“EC Treaty”)'° governs the
same subject matter as the BIT and therefore the BIT should be considered terminated
and/or inapplicable pursuant to Articles 59 and 30 of the Vienna Convention on the
Law of Treaties (“VCLT” or “Vienna Convention’),'' (ii) the arbitration clause in the
BIT cannot apply because it is incompatible with the EC Treaty, as the ECJ has
exclusive jurisdiction over Eureko’s claims, and (iii) clauses such as Article 4 of the
BIT relating to free transfer of capital have been held by the European Court of Justice

(“ECJ’) to be incompatible with EU law, which is supreme.'?

On 3 December 2009, having considered the matters raised during a teleconference held
with the Parties the previous day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2. In
Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal decided to hold a preliminary jurisdictional
phase dedicated to Respondent’s Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, and set a schedule
for the Parties’ submissions, for requests for document disclosure and for a hearing on
the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection. The Tribunal noted from the teleconference
that there had been no agreement between the Parties on any form of consolidation of
hearings on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection in this case with those in other
pending cases against the Slovak Republic in which similar issues might also arise.
With respect to the ratione personae jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal requested
Claimant to produce evidence of the extent of its shareholding and written assurances

as to its continued ownership of the claim, after which Respondent would be given an

Statement of Defence, {{[ 125-126.

opportunity to particularise any outstanding concerns. With respect to the ratione
materiae jurisdictional objection, the Tribunal ordered the Parties to proceed by way
of concurrent requests for document production in the form of “Redfern Schedules.”
The Tribunal reserved any decision on how and when to resolve the ratione materiae

issues until after it had reviewed the Parties’ positions.

Pursuant to Procedural Order No. 2, the Parties exchanged requests for disclosure of
documents related to the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection on 4 December 2009, and
replies and responses on disclosure on 11 and 17 December 2009. On 21 December
2009, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, deciding the outstanding issues

of document production.

On 29 January 2010, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Claimant provided
evidence of the extent of its shareholding in Union Healthcare at all relevant times
and written assurances as to its continuous ownership of the claims that it has brought
against Respondent in this arbitration. By letter dated 22 February 2010, Respondent
stated that it raised no questions regarding the Claimant’s jurisdiction ratione
personae. By letter dated 25 February 2010, the PCA informed the Parties that the
Tribunal, after review of the Parties’ positions, decided that no action needed to be

taken on the question of jurisdiction ratione personae.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent submitted its Memorial on
the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 29 January 2010
(“Jurisdiction Memorial”) and Claimant submitted its Counter-Memorial on the
Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 26 February 2010
(“Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial’). The Parties’ jurisdictional arguments are set

out in more detail in Part IV below.

On 5 February 2010, in accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent filed a
request for disclosure of documents with respect to the so-called ratione materiae
concerns (relating, inter alia, to the objective criteria of an “investment” and
Claimant’s compliance with Slovak law), and Claimant sent a letter stating it was not
in a position to submit such a request in the absence of specific allegations by
Respondent. On 5 March 2010, Claimant filed objections to Respondent’s document
requests relating to the so-called ratione materiae concerns, to which Respondent

replied on 12 March 2010. Further correspondence amongst the Parties ensued and

the Tribunal held a teleconference on 8 April 2010. Following the teleconference, on

8 April 2010, the Tribunal informed the Parties in writing that:

i. The Tribunal has decided not to order any disclosure at this time.

ii. The Partial Award on Jurisdiction [i.e., the present Award] will decide only
the “Intra EU” challenge.

iii.

The Tribunal is not minded to arrange a second jurisdictional stage devoted to
the ratione materiae challenge if it rejects the “Intra EU” challenge.

iv. Points (ii) and (iii) above are without prejudice to the right of the Respondent
to raise arguments based on ‘illegality’ and / or ‘business risk’ in relation to
questions of liability and / or quantum, if the case proceeds that far.

vy. Similarly, both Parties will be able to make fresh requests for disclosure in
relation to questions of merits and / or quantum, if the case proceeds that far.

In accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, Respondent submitted its Reply on the
Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 23 March 2010
(“Jurisdiction Reply”) and Claimant submitted its Rejoinder on the Intra-EU
Jurisdictional Objection with accompanying exhibits on 16 April 2010 (“Jurisdiction
Rejoinder’).

On 14 April 2010, Respondent submitted a document entitled “Respondent’s Position
on Amicus Curiae Brief of the European Commission” in which Respondent proposed
that the European Commission be invited to participate in the Intra-EU Jurisdictional

phase of the arbitration proceedings as amicus curiae.

On 15 April 2010, the Parties jointly filed a “List of agreed uniform terminology for
key entities in the arbitration,” the contents of which are incorporated in the List of

Defined Terms at the front of this Award.

On 21 April 2010, each Party sent the Tribunal a short summary list of headings under
which it would be making its oral submissions at the hearing on the Intra-EU

Jurisdictional Objection.

D. Hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection

On Saturday, 24 April 2010, a hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection was

possibility of approaching the European Commission and the Netherlands

Government to provide comments to the Tribunal.

E. Post-Hearing Proceedings

After the hearing on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection and following consultations
with the Parties, on 10 May 2010, the Tribunal wrote to the Director General of the
Legal Service of the European Commission providing information about the present
arbitration, referring to observations that the European Commission had made in the
Eastern Sugar BV (Netherlands) v. Czech Republic arbitration (“Eastern Sugar’)
concerning the effect upon the Tribunal’s jurisdiction of the fact that both the
Respondent and the national State of the Claimant are Member States of the Eu,” and
inviting the European Commission to submit any further observations on that

jurisdictional question that it might wish to communicate to the Tribunal.

Also on 10 May 2010, following consultations with the Parties, the Tribunal wrote to
the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs noting that the Netherlands

Government had already provided a letter to the Claimant for purposes of the present

arbitration,'* and inviting the Netherlands Government to provide to the Tribunal any

further observations that it might have on the jurisdictional question.

By e-mail dated 28 May 2010, the European Commission requested copies of
Eureko’s claims. After consultation with the Parties, the Tribunal provided the Notice

of Arbitration and Statement of Claim to the European Commission on 17 June 2010.

On 10 June 2010, the Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs responded to the
Tribunal’s invitation on behalf of the Netherlands Government with a letter setting out
its position on the jurisdictional question, as is described in more detail at

paragraphs 155 to 163.

By e-mail dated 11 June 2010, Claimant drew the Tribunal’s attention to an award
dated 9 October 2009 (made public, in redacted form, on 2 June 2010) in the matter of
Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic, an arbitration brought pursuant to the Austrian-
Slovak BIT under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules. Claimant pointed out that in
that case the Slovak Republic had raised no objection to jurisdiction based on the fact

that the BIT in question was between two EU Member States.

By letter dated 23 June 2010, the Netherlands Government sent a further letter to the
Arbitral Tribunal attaching a formal written statement in the form of a “Note Verbale”
from the Slovak Republic dated 16 June 2010 that had been sent in response to a
request from the Netherlands Government of 4 May 2010. This document is

described in more detail below at paragraphs 164 to 166.

On 7 July 2010, the European Commission responded to the Tribunal’s invitation
setting out its observations on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, as is described in

more detail below at paragraphs 175 to 196.

On 12 July 2010, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4, in which the
Tribunal: (i) re-affirmed its order to Claimant to produce documents covered by
paragraph 2.4 of Procedural Order No. 3 by Monday, 2 August 2010; (ii) ordered
Respondent to produce the Slovak Republic’s Reply to the European Commission’s
“Article 226” letter by 13 July 2010 (the “226-Reply”); and (iii), recalling both
Parties’ desire for the expeditious and efficient resolution of the dispute, and
Claimant’s willingness to proceed to prepare immediately for the merits “at its own

risk” without waiting for the Award on Jurisdiction to be rendered, set 2 August 2010

as the date by which Claimant should submit its Memorial on the Merits (which

Claimant proceeded to do).

On 13 July 2010, Respondent complained to the Tribunal that, as revealed in the
European Commission’s Observations, Claimant had sent the European Commission
an “ex parte communication” on 11 June 2010. Claimant provided a copy of the
communication in question to Respondent and to the Tribunal on 13 July 2010. Also
on 13 July 2010, Respondent produced to Claimant and to the Tribunal a copy of its
226-Reply.

On 19 July 2010, the Tribunal declined a request by Respondent to allow disclosure
of the European Commission’s observations in this arbitration to an arbitral tribunal

constituted in another arbitration involving the Slovak Republic under the same BIT.

On 19 July 2010, each Party submitted comments on the observations provided by the
Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs and the European Commission, as well as
on the (redacted) Austrian Airlines v. Slovak Republic award and the 226-Reply

(“Post Hearing Submissions”).

Further comments relating to the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection were received
from the Parties on 22 July, 29 July, 4 August, 6 August and 10 August 2010. On
16 August 2010, the Tribunal confirmed to the Parties that it considered that it had all

the material it needed for its deliberations on the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection.

HISTORICAL AND FACTUAL BACKGROUND

The summary below is drawn from the Parties’ pleadings and is presented to give
context to the timing of the investment and alleged BIT violations against the
background of the Slovak Republic’s entry into the EU. It in no way presents factual
determinations by the Tribunal that would be binding or could affect any assessment

at any later stage of this case.

A. The Slovak Republic’s Entry into the European Union
Starting in 1989 with the collapse of the Soviet Eastern Bloc, Czechoslovakia (from
1990 the Czech and Slovak Federative Republic (“CSFR”’)) underwent a
transformation from a system of central economic planning to a market economy.

According to the Slovak Republic, this transformation necessitated the creation of a

“sufficient legal framework, which would safeguard the functioning of the new
system and protection of the participating subjects.” Integration into the European
Community and Council of Europe was a priority in fostering the economic and
political stability desired, while ensuring the protection of foreign entities entering a

then-emerging market.'°

In 1989 Czechoslovakia initiated contact with the European Community.
Negotiations resulted in the conclusion on 16 December 1991 of the European
Agreement Establishing an Association between the European Community on the one
hand, and the CSFR, Hungary and Poland on the other (“CSFR Association

Agreement”).'° That Agreement was subject to ratification.

During the same period, the CSFR concluded the Interim Agreement on Trade and
Trade-related Matters by and between the CSFR, European Economic Community
and the European Coal and Steel Community, which entered into force from 1 March
1992. The CSFR also concluded bilateral agreements on the promotion and
protection of investments, including the BIT with The Netherlands, which was signed

on 29 April 1991 and came into force from 1 October 1992,!7

The CSFR became a member of the Council of Europe and a signatory to the
European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms
(“ECHR”) on 21 February 1991. The ECHR has been in force for the CSFR since 18
March 1992.

The Slovak Republic separated from the CSFR and became an independent State on
1 January 1993. It succeeded to the CSFR-Netherlands BIT, as well as to the ECHR,
as of the day of its independence. Because of the split of the CSFR, the CSFR
Association Agreement was never ratified. The Slovak Republic had to renegotiate
its relationship with the European Community by concluding the Agreement
Establishing an Association between the European Communities and their Member

States [including The Netherlands] and the Slovak Republic on 4 October 1993

B. Liberalisation of Slovak Heath Insurance Sector in 2004 and Eureko’s
Entry to Market

The Slovak Republic established a mandatory and universal public health insurance

system in 1993. This system, administered by a single state-owned Health Insurer,

was modified in 1994 to permit the creation of other state-owned and private entities

to perform public healthcare functions”!

By 2004, the public health insurance system had accumulated a substantial deficit.
The Slovak Republic addressed this deficit by an infusion of funds from the state
budget and a series of reforms to liberalise the legal framework of the health
insurance market. The 2004 reforms aimed at achieving a mix of public and private
investment.” Among other things, the reforms (i) eliminated administrative expenses
caps and enabled insurance companies to compete for clients, (ii) reduced the scope of
the mandatory health-care package by providing for supplementary health insurance
through voluntary additional out-of-pocket co-payments by the beneficiaries,
(iii) gave health insurers leverage in setting prices for services, as well as the ability to

make and use profits from the provision of such services, (iv) enabled privatisation of

state-owned health care providers by providing for conversion of existing health
insurance companies into joint-stock companies, (v) envisaged the use of surplus
funds by joint-stock companies, and (vi) established an independent Health Care

Regulator to supervise and control the health insurance market.*

According to Claimant, the 2004 liberalisation was “instrumental in making
investment in the Slovak health insurance sector attractive to Eureko.” Eureko
resolved to invest in the Slovak health insurance market through the incorporation of
Union Healthcare on 9 March 2006. By 1 January 2007, Union Healthcare had
obtained a share of around 8.5 percent in the Slovak health insurance market and

received top rankings and awards within the industry.?>

C. Reforms in the Slovak Republic Health Insurance Sector in 2006 - 2009

On 17 June 2006 parliamentary elections in the Slovak Republic resulted in the
victory of the SMER Social Democracy party. The new Slovak Government
introduced measures amending the 2004 reforms. Claimant bases its claim on nine of
these measures:”° (i) the cap on operating expenses, (ii) the ban on brokers, (iii) the
repositioning of the Healthcare Regulator and the entire management board, (iv) the
amended network requirements obliging health insurance companies to contract with
specific state hospitals, (v) the ban on the distribution of profits to shareholders, (vi)
the changes to the redistribution system, (vii) the scrutiny of the budgets of health
insurance companies, (viii) the newly-introduced solvency requirements, and (ix) the

ban on the transfer of insurance portfolios.

D. Dispute Between Eureko and Slovak Republic and Complaint to the EU

On 28 February 2008, Eureko filed a complaint with the European Commission.
According to Eureko, this filing was made in order to impress upon the Slovak
Government Eureko’s view that its policies are not in line with basic EU law
principles that had been a cornerstone of Eureko’s confidence in investing in the

Slovak Republic. The complaint led to the opening of an infringement procedure by

Article 226 provides th:
Treaties, it shall deliver a reasoned opinion on the matter after giving the State concerned the opportunity to submit its
observations. If the State concerned does not comply with the opinion within the period laid down by the Commission,
the latter may bring the matter before the Court of Justice of the European Union.” That provision is Article 258 of the
TFEU. The Complaint procedure was registered under reference number 2008/4268. See Observations of the European
Commission dated 7 July 2010 (hereafter “European Commission Observations”), 7.

the European Commission against the Slovak Republic under Article 226 of the EC
Treaty.?’ The infringement procedure, including the European Commission’s
administrative investigation into the Slovak health care legislation, is currently
ongoing.”®
Noting that Eureko’s influence on the progress and direction of this complaint
procedure is “limited,” that “ancillary proceedings in the European Court of Justice
can by their very nature not result in a damages award,” and that Eureko’s damages
“cannot be redressed through other EU-channels,” Claimant explained that it was
forced to turn to arbitration to seek redress.2? On 4 March 2008, Eureko sent the
Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic a “trigger letter” setting out its grievances with
respect to the reforms to the health insurance sector and formally notifying its
intention to commence arbitration proceedings under the BIT. After attempts at
amicable settlement failed, Eureko formally commenced an arbitration by a Notice of

Arbitration dated 1 October 2008.*°

ARGUMENTS ON THE “INTRA-EU JURISDICTIONAL OBJECTION”

The “Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection” was first raised in Respondent’s Statement of
Defence dated 30 October 2009, in accordance with Article 21(3) of the UNCITRAL
Arbitration Rules. Respondent further articulated the grounds for its Intra-EU
Jurisdictional Objection in its Jurisdiction Memorial, Jurisdiction Reply, oral

argument during the hearing on 24 April 2010, and Post-Hearing Submission.

According to Respondent, as of the date of the Accession Treaty (1 May 2004), the
EC Treaty has governed the relationship between the Slovak Republic and the
Netherlands.*! By acceding to the EU, the Slovak Republic became a part of a
specific system of law which creates a much more complex, wide-reaching and

elaborate framework of investment protection and human rights than that provided by

 

“If the Commission considers that a Member State has failed to fulfil an obligation under the

the BIT.” Respondent points out that Claimant has simultaneously complained of
breaches of the BIT and breaches of the EC Treaty and ECHR and also commenced a
complaint procedure with the European Commission.*? Respondent contends that
these treaties cannot be applied simultaneously or in parallel and that the application

of the BIT is therefore excluded.“

Essentially, Respondent’s arguments underlying the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection

can be summarised as follows:

e As a matter of public international law, pursuant to Article 59
(“Termination or suspension of the operation of a treaty implied by
conclusion of a later treaty”) of the Vienna Convention, the BIT was

terminated upon the Slovak Republic’s accession to the EC Treaty.

e As a matter of public international law, pursuant to Article 30
(“Application of successive treaties relating to the same subject-
matter”) of the Vienna Convention, since the Slovak Republic’s
accession to the EC Treaty the arbitration clause in the BIT can no

longer be considered applicable.

e As a matter of EU law, which forms part of the law of the Slovak
Republic (applicable by this Tribunal pursuant to Article 8(6) of the
BIT), the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the arbitration clause is
incompatible with the EC Treaty, the principle of autonomy of EU law,

and the principle of supremacy of EU law.

e As a matter of German law (the law of the place of the arbitration) the

Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the dispute is not arbitrable.

These arguments are each detailed further below, along with Claimant’s response to
such arguments, as articulated in Claimant’s Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial,
Jurisdiction Rejoinder, oral argument during the hearing on 24 April 2010, and

Post-Hearing Submission.

Claimant describes the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection as boiling down to “an

outright denial, by the Slovak Republic, of rights offered to a party that has invested

in its economy to seek redress from an arbitral tribunal under the BIT because the
Slovak Republic has chosen to enter the European Union.”*> Claimant notes also that
the objection first came to light over a year after the arbitration commenced, had
never been mentioned in prior discussions and is undermined by multiple statements

in which the Slovak Republic has held out the BIT as valid and binding.**

Both Parties stressed the importance of the issues at stake. For example, at the
hearing, Respondent stated that the Tribunal’s decision “may affect entire
jurisprudence in this matter and numerous disputes in the future,” noting that “the
uncertain fate of the old Intra-EU BITs provokes an ever growing debate in the whole
of Europe without unfortunately clear outcome at the moment.”*” Claimant, for its
part, asserted that Respondent’s logic would “mark the end of arbitration” in the EU,
because every tribunal that touched upon a question of EU law, considered by a

respondent to be difficult, would be forced to say it has no jurisdiction.**

A. Termination of the BIT under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention

The Parties presented detailed arguments based on the VCLT. According to
Respondent, the BIT was effectively terminated upon the Slovak Republic’s accession

to the EC Treaty by virtue of Article 59 of the VCLT, which provides as follows:

Termination or Suspension of the Operation of a Treaty
Implied by Conclusion of a Later Treaty

(1) A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a
later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:

(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that
the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that
treaty; or

(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with
those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of
being applied at the same time.

Claimant asserts that the following requirements must be satisfied in order to fulfil the
conditions for termination under Article 59: (i) the two treaties must relate to the
same subject matter; (ii) the two States must have intended Eureko’s investment to be

governed by the EC Treaty instead of the BIT; and (iii) the provisions of the BIT must

be so far incompatible with the provisions of the EC Treaty that the two treaties are
not capable of being applied at the same time.*? Claimant denies that these conditions

are met.

1. Do the BIT and the EC Treaty relate to the same subject matter?
Respondent’s Position

65. Respondent argues that the BIT and the EC Treaty relate to the same subject matter
because they cover the same types of investors and investments, serve the same

purposes, offer the same standards of protection, and provide for equivalent remedies.

66. With respect to investors, the definition in BIT Article 1(b) includes investors that are
natural persons citizen of contracting parties or legal entities established in
accordance with the law of the contracting parties. The EC Treaty, Article 48(1),

protects all citizens of EU Member States including natural persons and legal entities.

67. With respect to covered investments, Article 1(a) of the BIT defines investments as
“every kind of asset invested either directly or through an investor of a third State”
and lists examples. Under EU law, the protection of investments is provided for by
the freedoms of the internal market, such as the freedom of establishment, the free
movement of goods, persons, services and capital.*° Although the EC Treaty does not
define “capital,” an explanatory note to a Council Directive and decisions of the ECJ
have, according to Respondent, confirmed that the term “investments” in the Council

Directive covers the same type of investments as those covered by the Bir."!

68. Respondent argues that the BIT and EC Treaty serve identical purposes, which are
fundamentally to broaden and strengthen mutual economic relationships and to
promote the flow of capital and economic development of the contracting parties,
while at the same time guaranteeing fair and equitable treatment. Respondent points

to the preamble of the BIT and to Articles 2, 3 and 12 of the EC Treaty.

According to Respondent, the standards of protection offered by the two treaties are

the same. For example:

With respect to the establishment of investments, Respondent compares the
undertaking in Article 2 of the BIT to promote the investments between the two
countries to Articles 2 and 3 of the EC Treaty, in which the Slovak Republic
undertook to eliminate any restrictions preventing foreign investors’ access to the
market in the territory of another Member State. Article 56 of the EC Treaty

further prohibits any restrictions on the free movement of capital and payments.”

With respect to equal treatment and non-discrimination, Respondent notes the
similarities between the promise in Article 3(1) of the BIT “not to impair, by
unreasonable or discriminatory measures, the operation, management,
maintenance, use, enjoyment or disposal” of an investment, and the principles of
non-discrimination and equality of treatment fundamentally protected by EU law
through Articles 12 and 43 of the EC Treaty and under the Charter on
Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Respondent acknowledges that
Article 3(3) of the BIT makes some exceptions to equal treatment in certain
circumstances. Respondent points out that Claimant itself invoked EU law to
support its argument that the Slovak Republic failed to provide fair and equitable

treatment of Eureko’s investment as required by the Bir.#

In relation to free movement of payments, Respondent points to the “identical”
protections offered by Article 4 of the BIT (guaranteeing that payments related to
an investment may be transferred) and Article 56 of the EC Treaty (prohibiting
“all restrictions on the movement of capital” and “all restrictions on payments”

between Member State:

 

..’). Respondent additionally invokes recent decisions of
the ECJ in cases brought against Austria, Sweden and Finland, relating to
breaches of their obligations as EU Member States arising from the investment
treaties that they had concluded with third (i.e., non-EU) countries (hereafter the

“Extra-EU BIT Cases”)."°

e Respondent argues that the standard of “full protection and security” under
Article 3(2) is similarly guaranteed under the EC Treaty, by virtue of the rules of
the internal market. The ECJ has held such internal market rules to include
protection of investment from physical interventions, impairment or neutralisation
measures which might discourage investors from other Member States.“°
Respondent acknowledges that the EC Treaty in some respects goes beyond the
guarantees offered by the BIT but contends that the EC Treaty “exhaustively

covers the standard of full protection and security of investments.”

e Respondent argues that the protection of proprietary rights is one of the
fundamental rights guaranteed by both the BIT (through Article 5 on
expropriation) and EU law, especially within the scope of the freedom of
movement, freedom of establishment, free movement of capital and Article 17(1)

of the ECHR.”

At the hearing on 24 April 2010, Respondent submitted a “Comparative Table”
illustrating that all the rules in the BIT allegedly breached by Respondent are covered

by the EC Treaty, as summarised below:

 

BIT EC Treaty

 

Free Transfer of Capital (Art. 4) Free Movement of Capital (Art. 56)

 

Fair and Equitable Treatment (Art. 3(1)) | Prohibition of Discrimination (Art. 12)

 

Full Security and Protection (Art. 3(2)) Freedom of Establishment (Art. 43)

 

Indirect Expropriation (Art. 5) Freedom of Establishment (Art. 43)

 

 

 

 

Finally Respondent argues that both the BIT and EU law provide the same system of
remedies where investments have been impaired as a result of state action. Under
EU law, investors pursue their claims before national courts with involvement of the
ECJ via a preliminary ruling procedure; and under the BIT investors can have their
dispute heard before an arbitral tribunal. Both mechanisms aim at the same objective,
namely the protection of investments. Under both mechanisms, investors may seek

E-SR Award on Jurisdiction, etc.

Respondent characterises Claimant’s approach to what constitutes the “same subject
matter” for the purposes of the VCLT as too narrow. According to Respondent, the
VCLT requires that both treaties “relate to” the same subject matter: not that they
cover or regulate exactly the same subject matter. If particular conduct is such as to
attract the application of both treaties, then the treaties relate to the same subject
matter. This broader interpretation is, according to Respondent, consistent with the

position taken by the ILC and in Oppenheim’s International Law.

Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s assertion that the EC Treaty merely covers the
promotion of investments, pointing out that the EC Treaty also covers all aspects of
investment protection in a manner comparable to the standards guaranteed by the
BIT, including fair and equitable treatment, full security and protection and even the
possibility of dispute resolution against the State.”

Respondent dismisses the two “precedents” — the Binder and Eastern Sugar cases —

relied upon by Claimant.*!

Respondent questions their binding value as there is no
formal rule of precedent in international arbitration. Respondent states that the
Tribunal should in any event not follow Eastern Sugar because: (i) the violations
complained of by the claimant in Eastern Sugar occurred before the Czech Republic’s
accession to the EU, and the principle of supremacy did not therefore come into play;
(ii) the important Extra-EU BIT Cases were decided by the ECJ after the award in
Eastern Sugar, (iii) when assessing the “same subject-matter” argument, the Eastern
Sugar tribunal only took into account the EU regulation of free movement of capital
and not other rules of EU law that overlap with the BIT; (iv) the Eastern Sugar
tribunal failed properly to address the opinions of EU institutions; and (v) the Eastern
Sugar tribunal incorrectly concluded that the EU “does not provide for possibility for
an investor to sue a host state directly,” despite the possibility of investors claiming

damages through a national court under the interpretative supervision of the ECJ.?

Respondent also maintains that a further award cited by Claimant, Austrian Airlines v.
Slovak Republic, should have no impact on the current proceedings.** Respondent
explains that in the Austrian Airlines case the Slovak Republic had raised other strong
jurisdictional objections and did not have any reason to complicate the proceedings by
raising in addition the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, which would have required
inviting the European Commission to share its views. This approach was vindicated
as Respondent was ultimately successful on its other jurisdictional objections. The
Austrian Airlines case was, moreover, a factually distinct proceeding from the present
arbitration. The fact that a party does not develop a certain argument in one case does
not estop that party from subsequently developing and advancing such a line of
argumentation in different proceedings. Nor does it impact on the validity of the
Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection itself, the seriousness and significance of which is
demonstrated by the level of interest amongst European institutions, Member States
(including the Czech Republic, the other original party to the BIT), academics and

practitioners.**

Respondent notes Claimant’s failure to address the Extra-EU BIT Cases, which are
relevant because (i) they address the legal overlap between the EC Treaty and Extra-
EU BITs regarding the protection of investments, and (ii) they are concerned with
situations in which there is a conflict between treaties, arising from the impossibility
of applying restrictions on the free movement of payments and capital adopted by the
Council under the EC Treaty where at the same time the Extra-EU BITs forbid such
restrictions.” Respondent argues a fortiori that the principle established in the
Extra-EU BIT Cases also applies to intra-EU BITs because both kinds of BITs relate
to the same subject-matter. Intra-EU BITs may also compromise the effectiveness of
EU law which the Member States are obliged to ensure pursuant to Article 10 of the
EC Treaty.” 7

At the hearing, Respondent argued that the subject matter of the EC Treaty not only

relates to the same aspects of investment protection as the BIT but in many aspects,

especially with regard to the area of full security and protection and indirect
expropriation, the protection granted by EU law under freedom of establishment is

substantially more extensive.*

Moreover, the fact that there has never been a BIT
concluded between two EU Member States confirms there is overlapping subject-

matter.”
Claimant's Position

78. Claimant rejects the proposition that the BIT and EC Treaty relate to the same subject
matter. This is because the EC Treaty deals with initiation of investments, while the
BIT primarily aims to protect investments once made. The EC Treaty is primarily
concerned with the integration of the economies of the Member States and removal of
restrictions on trade and investments and thus establishes the freedom to make
investments. While the EC Treaty provides for free movement of capital and
freedom to establish undertakings, it does not require Member States to afford
investments “fair and equitable treatment,” “full security and protection” or dispute

resolution through arbitration.

79. The expression “relating to the same subject-matter” must, according to Claimant, be
interpreted strictly and narrowly. It should not apply when a later general treaty
impinges indirectly on specific provisions of an earlier treaty.! The EC Treaty is a

general wide ranging treaty regulating agriculture, fisheries, public health, culture,

consumer protection, citizenship and development cooperation. While the EC Treaty
contains some provisions on the free flow of capital and payments and freedom of
establishment, the BIT has more detailed and particularised provisions on the
protection to be afforded to investments. Thus, even if the EC Treaty offers some
protections of investments, this does not mean the BIT and the EC Treaty relate to the

same subject matter.

80. In support of its position, Claimant refers to arbitral “precedents” in two similar
disputes involving EU investors against the Czech Republic. Claimant distinguishes
these cases from the Extra-EU BIT Cases, which it says are entirely different from

cases involving intra-EU BITs and therefore irrelevant to the present proceedings.

E-SR Award on Jurisdiction, etc.

26 October 2010

The first case is the March 2007 partial award in Eastern Sugar, involving a claim by
a Dutch investor against the Czech Republic under the Czech-Netherlands BIT, which
is identical to the BIT in the present case. The Czech Republic had argued that
Article 59 of the VCLT resulted in the BIT no longer being effective, that the BIT
could be considered terminated following the accession of the Czech Republic to the
EU, that the intra-EU investment regime as at the date of accession superseded the
obligations in the BIT and that the BIT would breach the non-discrimination principle
in Article 12 of the EC Treaty. The tribunal in Eastern Sugar rejected the Czech
Republic’s argument under Article 59 of the VCLT. The Eastern Sugar tribunal did
not accept that the EC Treaty and the BIT in question covered the same subject

matter.

The second case relied on by Claimant is a June 2007 award on jurisdiction in Binder
v. Czech Republic, between a German investor and the Czech Republic under the
German-Czech BIT. According to Claimant’s sources, the Czech Republic argued
that the BIT was no longer applicable in view of the Czech Republic’s accession to
the EU and investment protection offered by EC law, that intra-EU BITs are
inconsistent with the “mutual trust principle’ under EC law and the exclusive
jurisdiction of the ECJ, that there is discrimination against investors from EU Member
States where investors have no similar rights to those under the BIT and that
Article 59 of the VCLT causes termination of the BIT. The Czech Republic sought a
stay of proceedings pending a statement by the competent EU authorities or a
preliminary ruling from the ECJ. The tribunal dismissed the Czech Republic’s
arguments in their entirety, holding that the intra-EU BIT and EC law were compatible

and still in force.

Additionally, Claimant draws attention to the award in Austrian Airlines v. Slovak
Republic, an arbitration brought pursuant to the Austrian-Slovak BIT. Claimant
points out that in that case the Slovak Republic raised seven jurisdictional objections
but none related to the termination or inapplicability of the Austrian-Slovak BIT on

the basis that both Austria and the Slovak Republic are members of the EU. In fact,

the objections concerned the interpretation of the Austrian-Slovak BIT, thus
presuming its continued validity and applicability.©° According to Claimant, this
shows that the Slovak Republic has no genuine concern about the Intra-EU
Jurisdictional Objection but rather considers it an “argument of last resort” to be used
to cause substantial delay.” Claimant notes that the Eastern Sugar tribunal
considered as relevant the position that the respondent State had taken towards

intra-EU BITs in other arbitral proceedings.

At the hearing, Claimant was asked about the possible impact of the Lisbon Treaty.
Claimant stated that even if Article 307 could possibly be relevant to intra-EU BITs
(which it is not), or if the EU competence in respect of “foreign direct investment”
covered everything that BITs covered (which it does not), at most the only possible
ruling could be that a Member State breaches its obligation under EU law by having
treaties in place that fall within the exclusive competence of the Community, and that
would entail only the obligation to terminate them. There is no support, according to
Claimant, for the proposition that, as a result of the Lisbon Treaty, all EU BITs would
be automatically terminated as a matter of law. That would leave an “enormous gap”

in the protection of investors.”

Addressing the Extra-EU BIT Cases, Claimant notes that the ECJ determined that the
member states had not complied with their obligation to bring the relevant BITs in
line with EU law but until such amendments are made, the BITs remain fully in force.
Even under the Lisbon Treaty, the BITs remain in force and do not lapse or
automatically expire under public international law. At any rate, according to
Claimant, expropriation issues remain with the individual member states under the

Lisbon Treaty.”

Claimant, in its Post-Hearing Submission of 19 July 2010 noted that although the Slovak Republic was ultimately
successful in having the case dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the objections were not so strong as to have justified
omitting the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection, as shown by the fact that the award was not unanimous.

2. Did the Parties intend the EC Treaty to replace the BIT?
Respondent’s Position

86. Respondent argues that by concluding the Accession Treaty, “the intention of the

contracting parties was to replace the former treaty with the later one.”7!

Against the
backdrop of the Slovak Republic’s efforts to join the EU, the ultimate objective of the
BIT was to help the Slovak Republic accede to the EU and create a trading platform
on which basis the nationals of Member States could invest in the Slovak Republic
without fears of uncertainty or lack of a legal framework for foreign investments.
However, when the Slovak Republic acceded to the EU on | May 2004, that trading

platform “became obsolete.”

87. According to Respondent, the BIT was merely an accessory to the Association
Agreements and since those were terminated by the accession of the new Member
States, so was the applicability of the BIT.” The Accession Treaty itself proves that
the intention of the Slovak Republic and the Netherlands was that their mutual
relations, including those relating to the subject matter of the BIT, should be governed
by EU law. Any other methods of interpreting the intention of the States, such as the
statements and communications cited by Claimant, are redundant and irrelevant to the
present case since the termination of the BIT is implied by the conclusion of the

Accession Treaty.

88. This conclusion is not impeded by Article 3(5) of the BIT (which envisages more
favourable treatment under later agreements) because Article 3(5) does not prohibit
changing or replacing the BIT itself.” Further, Article 3(5) is incompatible with the
principles of direct effect and supremacy. In any event, Article 3(5) is also deemed to
have been terminated along with the rest of the BIT pursuant to Article 59 of the
VCLT.

89. Respondent rejects Claimant’s argument that the BIT and EC Treaty were already
operating in parallel before the Accession Treaty, under Articles 12 and 56 of the EC

Treaty. These provisions could only have applied to Respondent’s nationals under the

Article 3(5) of the BIT provides: “If the provisions of law of either Contracting Party or obligations under international
law existing at present or established hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement
contain rules, whether general or specific, entitling investments by investors of the other Contracting Party to a treatment
more favourable than is provided for by the present Agreement, such rules shall to the extent that they are more
favourable prevail over the present Agreement.”

principle of personal applicability, and did not impose obligations on Respondent
itself under EU law. Respondent also considers Claimant’s argument on Article 6(12)
of the Act on Accession attached to the Accession Treaty as irrelevant to this dispute
because that provision concerns “external agreements or conventions” and not intra-

EU BITs.

As evidence that Respondent was of the opinion that its post-Accession BITs would
be considered inapplicable, it submitted with its Jurisdiction Memorial Exhibit R-46,
an e-mail dated 5 April 2004 from the Slovak Ministry of Finance to the economic
and commercial counsellors at diplomatic missions of several EU Member States in
Bratislava (the “5 April 2004 E-mail’). The 5 April 2004 E-mail stated as follows:
One of the priorities of Accession of the Slovak Republic in the
European Union is accomplish obligations concerning harmonisation of
international trade agreements — Agreement for protection and reciprocal

promotion of investment contains Articles which are not compatible with
the acquis communautaire.

The officials of the Slovak Republic have already made initial contact
with the European Commission concerning this issues, and as a reply we
have received this opinion from Mr. Jérn Sack — expert of the Legal
Service of the European Commission in Brussels:

‘For the second point (BITs among MS) we have agreed in a
coordination meeting at the Commission that these become
obsolete under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention, but that the
parties should notify each other that they agree on that’.

On the basis of the above-mentioned, as well unofficial information from
the European Commission, we would like to initiate the reception
common procedure concerning to harmonization BIT’s with Member
States and Accession Countries.

We would like to know your unofficial opinion to our proposal as soon
as possible.

At the hearing, Respondent was asked whether any of the States who were recipients
of the 5 April 2004 E-mail had replied to the request for “unofficial opinion[s] to our
proposal.””° Respondent obtained information about five such responses. One was
from Poland which opined that “from the day of accession articles which are not
compatible with the EU acquis communautaire according to the Article 59 in
connection with Article 30 par. 3 of Vienna Convention are terminated (/ex posteriori

derogate lex priori). Therefore there is no need to initiate any procedure.” One

response was from a German counsellor, who “without having the occasion to consult
with the competent ministries in Berlin” gave his “rather personal — i.e., totally
unofficial — opinion” that the “whole complex of Foreign Trade will be harmonized
and coordinated by the EU. Therefore the BIT would become obsolete. About this
fact the parties concerned should give notice to each other.” According to
Respondent, a response from Greece opined that the BITs are still valid parallel to
EU law; and responses from Latvia and France reserved their right to make their
opinions later, which they never did. Respondent remarked that these responses

showed “how different the interpretation of this issue is.” 76

Respondent maintains that irrespective of any notification procedures, the Slovak
Republic’s accession to the EU had the legal consequence of terminating the BIT.
The Netherlands and Slovak Republic “definitely intended to govern their
relationships with the nationals of their respective counterparty under EU law.” This
is a necessary consequence of the fundamental characteristics of EU law, including
supremacy, direct applicability and direct effect. According to Respondent, so long as
the intention of the Parties is to terminate the earlier treaty, an explicit intention to

terminate the former treaty is not required for purposes of Article 59 of the VCLT.”

In other words, termination of the BIT occurs ex /ege without notification to the other
party. The Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection concerns a legal question that cannot be
affected by unilateral statements made by the parties to the BIT, as confirmed by
VCLT Articles 31(2) and (3). Thus, the position of the Dutch Government, as set out
in a letter provided to Eureko (described below in Section V.A), can have no effect on
the legal consequences relating to the conclusion of the Accession Treaty seven years
earlier. Similarly, statements made by Slovak authorities referring to the possibility
of investors commencing arbitration have no import because they fail to address the
validity, termination or applicability of the BIT, and in any event were made after
Eureko established Union Healthcare and could not have been relied on by Eureko at

the time of establishing its investment.”

At the hearing, Respondent was asked by a member of the Tribunal whether it had
followed Article 65 of the VCLT, which establishes “a procedure to be followed with

respect to invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a

treaty,” requiring a state to notify its counterparty of its claim and the reasons
therefor. Respondent had two answers. First, the 5 April 2004 E-mail was an explicit
communication relating to termination of the Treaty. Second, notification is not in
any event a requirement for termination when the termination occurs automatically by

virtue of Article 59 of the VCLT.”

Respondent was also asked about the statement of the European Commission included
in the Eastern Sugar award. Respondent acknowledged the European Commission’s
position, at least at the time of Eastern Sugar, to be that there was no automatic
termination of intra-EU BITs, but stressed that it was important for the Commission to

be invited to present its views in the present arbitration.*°

In response to a question about the termination provisions in Article 13(3) of the BIT,
Respondent stated that first, Claimant’s investment took place only after the Slovak
Republic entered the EU, and thus the termination occurred before the investment was
made. Second, Article 13(3) should apply only to termination by an act of a

Contracting Party, and not to the termination ex /ege under the VCLT.*!

Claimant's Position

98.

” Transcript, pp. 16-2
Transcript, p. 23.

Transcript, pp. 2-
Jurisdiction Counter-Memorial, 4 78-80.

Claimant argues that the requirement in Article 59(1)(a) of an intention to terminate
the BIT has not been met. Rather, the EC Treaty and the BIT were intended to
function alongside each other. According to Claimant, numerous indicators show the

absence of any intent to terminate the BIT.

First, when concluding the BIT, the two States had in mind that future treaties
between them would complement the parties’ rights and obligations, and not that such
provisions would replace provisions in the BIT.” For example, Article 8(6) of the
BIT explicitly acknowledges the permissibility of other treaties relating to investment
protection by referring to “other relevant Agreements between the Contracting
Parties” as a possible source on which a tribunal may rely to decide an arbitration.
Similarly, Article 3(5) of the BIT refers to the possibility of more favourable
provisions in “obligations under international law existing at present or established
hereafter between the Contracting Parties in addition to the present Agreement.”

Claimant notes that even prior to the Slovak Republic’s accession to the EC Treaty,

 

 

28

99.

100.

101.

 

E-SR Award on Jurisdiction, etc.

26 October 2010

the BIT and EC Treaty already functioned alongside each other to the extent that
Slovak investors were eligible to invoke some aspects of the EC Treaty as external

investors.*?

Second, Claimant says that the Accession Treaty itself evidences that the Netherlands
and the Slovak Republic did not intend to replace or terminate the BIT, because

Article 6(12) of the Act attached to the Accession Treaty provides that:

The new Member States shall take appropriate measures, where
necessary, to adjust their position in relation to [...] those international
agreements to [...] which other Member States are also parties, to the
rights and obligations arising from their accession to the Union.

Tf the intent had been implicitly to terminate these treaties, there would be no need to
require “measures” in order for agreements to be “adjusted” to the rights and
obligations arising under the EC Treaty.

Third, neither State manifests on its website or in its official treaty records any

intention to terminate the BIT and have the subject matter governed solely by the EC

 

Treaty. The BIT is listed as a treaty in force on the official websites of the Slovak
Ministry of Finance and the Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs.“ Claimant recalls
that the Eastern Sugar tribunal held that implicit termination could not be found in
circumstances where both contracting parties to the BIT still list the BIT as an
international treaty to which they are party. The Eastern Sugar tribunal found that it
was not the common intent of the Netherlands and the Czech Republic for the

EC Treaty to supersede the BIT.

The Netherlands also publicly affirms the BIT to be valid, as is reflected in its official
record of treaties and on the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs website.*> The
Netherlands Government also confirmed explicitly, in a letter of 10 February 2010,
responding to questions from Eureko, that it considers the BIT to be “in force.”*° The
Netherlands Government stated that the “Slovak Republic has never indicated to the
Kingdom of the Netherlands in any way that the [BIT] is no longer in force or that its
applicability could be in doubt”; nor had the Slovak Republic “indicated any wish to

negotiate termination of the [BIT].”

Claimant further observes that the Slovak Republic has taken no steps to invoke the
termination provisions in the BIT. The sole evidence submitted by Respondent to
suggest otherwise was the informal 5 April 2004 E-mail, which does not appear to
have been effectively sent to or received by the Dutch Embassy (there were flaws in
the e-mail address used) and in any event is “blatantly insufficient to terminate a
BIT.” Further the 5 April 2004 E-mail refers to “harmonization of BIT’s,” which
would not be necessary and would not have been proposed had the intra-EU BITs
been automatically terminated.** Claimant does not consider the German or Polish
responses to the 5 April 2004 E-mail (produced at the hearing) to be supportive of

Respondent’s position.”

Claimant proffers a number of statements by the Slovak Republic, made in the context
of the 2007 Reforms, holding out the BIT to be valid and binding. For example, two
communications from the Slovak Ministry of Finance to other government
departments warned of likely arbitrations “for breach of bilateral investment treaties
due to indirect expropriation of shares”? Similarly, the Government’s Legislative
Board raised the prospect of investors having “the option to revert to arbitration to
claim ... compensation of damages from the Slovak Republic” pursuant to the BIT.”!
Finally, in 2008, the Ministry of Finance stated that if certain measures were taken,
then “[f]rom an international perspective, such step of the State might be interpreted
as an unreasonable intervention with the rights of foreign investors guaranteed by the
State under agreements on support and mutual protection of investments ... and their

992

violation may give rise to international arbitrations. All these statements were

made some three to five years after the Slovak Republic’s accession to the EU.

The Slovak Republic also made statements directly to Eureko that are “wholly
incompatible with the Slovak Republic’s argument that the BIT has terminated upon
its accession to the EU.” For example, in a January 2007 letter, a Minister Valentovié

assured Eureko that the proposed Ministry of Health procedures would be “in

accordance with EU regulations and bilateral treaties between the Slovak Republic

BIT itself or any particular article therein was terminated. The German e-mail is mysterious but does not make

and the Netherlands.””* In subsequent communications there was no mention that the
BIT was considered invalid.” When the prospect of arbitration was raised, the
Minister of Finance referenced the possibility of reaching an “amicable settlement”

within the meaning of the BIT.

According to Claimant, the above-described statements of the Contracting Parties to
the BIT are “highly relevant” to the analysis under VCLT Article 59 because they
reveal whether or not there was the requisite implicit intent on the part of the BIT
Contracting Parties to terminate the treaty. Such intent is an essential element of the
Article 59 test, and it is therefore wrong for Respondent to dismiss the statements as

irrelevant to the resolution of “purely legal” issues under the VCLT.

At the hearing, Claimant was questioned about the European Commission’s letter
quoted in the Eastern Sugar partial award. Claimant highlighted that the European

Commission had stated as follows:”>

the EU Acquis does not entail at the same time the automatic termination of
the concerned BITs or necessarily the non-application of all their provisions.
Without prejudice to the primacy of Community law, to terminate these
agreements Member States would have to strictly follow the relevant
procedure provided for this in the agreements themselves. Such termination
cannot have a retroactive effect.

Claimant reiterated that there was nothing on the record to indicate that the European
Commission considered that the treaties had been rendered inapplicable, as a matter

of law and in their entirety, at the moment of accession.”°

A member of the Tribunal pointed out that the European Commission’s letter cited in
Eastern Sugar appeared to reflect a distinction between situations in which the facts
that had occurred before accession, and situations such as those where the alleged
violations occurred after the Slovak Republic’s accession to the EU. Claimant
nevertheless considered that this should not make a difference to the legal proposition
that a BIT is not automatically terminated but requires strict procedures to be

followed in order to effect termination.”

109. As an alternative to a finding that the BIT was terminated by virtue of Article 59(1)(a)
of the VCLT, Respondent argues that Article 59(1)(b) is, in any event, satisfied. That
is, the provisions of the EC Treaty are so far incompatible with those of the BIT that
the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time. Under
Article 59(1)(b), a conflict occurs when the performance of one treaty necessarily
causes a breach of the other treaty: in other words, the obligations arising out of the

BIT and the EC Treaty cannot both be fulfilled at the same time.”*

110. Respondent posits that the provisions on the free movement of payments and the
protection and security of investments guaranteed under the BIT are incompatible
with the EC Treaty because Article 58 of the EC Treaty permits exceptions to the free
movement of capital relating to taxation and financial supervision or public policy and
security. Thus a State may be in breach of the BIT but be in compliance with the

EC Treaty.”

111. Respondent further argues that the expropriation clause in Article 5 of the BIT is
incompatible with the regulation of expropriation and damages under EU law, which
is derived largely from the ECHR.'” This is because EU law enables possible
restrictions on proprietary rights “necessary for the general interest” which could
cause a breach of Article 5 of the BIT. Respondent argues that Article 5 of the BIT

would also breach Article 10 of the EC Treaty, dealing with loyal cooperation.

112. Respondent criticises Claimant’s failure to address the Extra-EU BIT Cases, even
though those cases precisely define what should be considered an incompatibility

between EU law and international law instruments.

113. According to Respondent the arbitration clause in Article 8 of the BIT is also
incompatible with the EC Treaty for two reasons: (i) the arbitration clause violates

the exclusive competence of the ECJ to interpret EU law; and (ii) the EC Treaty does

not provide for arbitration proceedings between investors and Member States leading

to a discrimination problem.'!

As to the first, arbitral tribunals, unlike national courts, are not entitled to raise
preliminary questions of EU law to the ECJ, pursuant to Article 234 of the EC Treaty.
Were an arbitral tribunal to resolve questions of EU law in the absence of a referral to
the ECJ, this would seriously jeopardise the uniform application of EU law.

Respondent disagrees with Claimant’s statement that the ECJ has held that arbitral

tribunals are under an obligation to apply fundamental EU law.

Although it is
common ground that this Tribunal should apply EU law, according to Respondent,
this Tribunal is prevented from doing so because it is not able to ensure the uniform
application and interpretation of EU law, which is the role of the ECJ under
Article 220 of the EC Treaty. Even if this Tribunal could request a national court to
assist, the national court could not do so because it does not ultimately decide the case

on its merits.'

Respondent explains that the uniform application of EU law may not be sufficiently
safeguarded by the possibility of annulment or enforcement proceedings in national
courts because: (i) such proceedings are not obligatory; (ii) such remedies are limited
by specific prerequisites and not every misinterpretation of the law results in the
annulment of an award or refusal of its recognition and enforcement; and (iii) if such
proceedings are commenced outside the EU, then the national courts will neither be

obliged nor entitled to request a preliminary ruling from the ECJ.

On discrimination, Respondent argues that the arbitration clause is incompatible
because it fundamentally violates the principle of equality as stipulated in Article 12
of the EC Treaty. Article 12 prohibits discrimination on the grounds of nationality.
Investors from Member States which have not concluded BITs with the Slovak
Republic would be discriminated against as a result of the Arbitration Clause. Thus
the fact that only certain EU nationals may seek compensation for damages caused by
a breach of EU law before an international arbitral tribunal is discriminatory and in
violation of Article 12 of the EC Treaty. In this connection, Respondent dismisses the

reasoning of the arbitral tribunal in the Eastern Sugar arbitration as based on an

“unconvincing” and “cursory analysis.”!* Because the BIT leads to unequal
treatment of EU nationals, the Eastern Sugar tribunal ought to have found that
compliance with one treaty (the BIT) causes breach of the other treaty (the EC Treaty)

and there thus exists an incompatibility for purposes of Article 59(1)(b) of the VCLT.

Respondent rejects Claimant’s suggestion that the discriminatory effects of the BIT
could be removed by offering the same rights granted under the BIT to investors from
other Member States. This is because the EU has exclusive power to govern and
amend the rights relating to the free movement of goods, persons, services and capital.
As a result, the Member States do not have competence to enter BITs. Even if they
did have such competence, this would not remove the discriminatory effect of the BIT
retrospectively, as the Vienna Convention’s concept of “incompatible” provisions
includes any provision in a treaty which requires a party to act in a way which
necessarily causes a breach of a later treaty. The arbitration clause in the BIT is such
a provision because its invocation by Claimant necessarily causes discrimination
against citizens from other Member States by the Slovak Republic and the
Netherlands. Hence, the BIT must be deemed to have been terminated or inapplicable

because of its incompatibility with the EC Treaty.

In response to a question from a member of the Tribunal at the hearing, Respondent
confirmed its view that any complaint that could be made under the fair and equitable
treatment provision in the BIT (and not only those complaints specifically raised in
the present arbitration) could also be made under the provisions on equality and the
prohibition of discrimination in the EC Treaty. In response to a question concerning
the example of a flat corporate tax, to be applied in a non-discriminatory manner but
which could be said to be unfair and inequitable, Respondent said that this could be an
example of a measure incompatible with the BIT but permitted by EU law, and
therefore a clear example of incompatibility between the two Treaties. The question
was posed whether “incompatibility” describes a situation where something that is
forbidden under the BIT is permitted by EU law, or only where something that is
forbidden under the BIT is mandated by EU law. According to Respondent,
incompatibility occurs when an act is permissible under one treaty, but not

permissible under the other. 105

Claimant's Position

120.

121.

122.

123.

Claimant argues that the BIT and EC Treaty are not “so far incompatible ... that the
two are not capable of being applied at the same time.” Article 59(1)(b) requires,
according to Claimant, a “gross incompatibility,” to such an extent that the parties
must be considered to have intended to abrogate the earlier treaty. As Claimant

argued with respect to Article 59(1)(a), such intent is absent.

Further, according to Claimant, the weight of opinion in the literature supports the
view that Article 59(1)(b) requires an incompatibility of “regimes” of both treaties as
a whole, and not merely an incompatibility between some provisions of the treaties.
The incompatibility must be such that the two treaties are “not capable of being
applied at the same time” and therefore that it is “not at all possible” for them to be
simultaneously applied. Claimant points to the fact that various tribunals in intra-EU
BIT disputes have rendered awards, showing that such treaties are perfectly capable

of being applied at the same time.'°°

Claimant observes that the dispute resolution mechanism in Article 8 of the BIT is not
incompatible with the EC Treaty, as is shown by the fact that the ECJ has repeatedly
held that arbitral tribunals are under an obligation to apply fundamental EU law,
despite the fact that arbitral tribunals in and by themselves are not empowered to raise

preliminary questions. '°”

Ultimately, the uniform application of EU law is
safeguarded by national courts in exercise of their competence to set aside or refuse to
enforce arbitral awards or in their capacity to submit preliminary questions to the

Ecy.'

Claimant disputes Respondent’s contention that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible
with Article 12 of the EC Treaty (prohibiting discrimination on grounds of
nationality). According to Claimant, Article 8 of the BIT merely grants Dutch
investors a right to be heard by an arbitral tribunal, and if the Slovak Republic
considers the exercise of this right to be discriminatory vis-a-vis non-Dutch investors

it should grant those non-Dutch investors the same right. Discriminatory behaviour

should be remedied by granting others a similarly favourable position, not by placing

all parties in a similarly unfavourable position.!°°

According to Claimant, the Eastern Sugar tribunal rejected arguments based on
discrimination and also observed that the European Commission had not commenced
infringement proceedings against either the Netherlands or the Czech Republic, which
would have been expected if the Czech Republic were correct about incompatibility.
Similarly, according to sources relied upon by Claimant, the Binder tribunal
dismissed the Czech Republic’s arguments in their entirety, holding that the intra-EU
BIT and EC law are compatible and still in force. The Binder tribunal found no
discrimination and no conflict between the substantive protections offered by the BIT

and the terms of the EC Treaty, and thus no need to debate the primacy of EC law.'!°

At the hearing, Claimant responded to questions about discrimination. Claimant
argued that where Investor A may bring a State to arbitration, but Investor B cannot
bring that same State to arbitration, the State cannot renege on its promise to
Investor A by invoking its own discriminatory act. The proper remedy would be for
Investor B to seek a right to arbitration. It was discussed whether this in any event
presented a problem of compatibility in terms of Article 30 or Article 59 of the
vcLT.'"' In this context, the Extra-EU BIT cases were recalled, and Claimant

pointed out that the ECJ did not refer to discrimination in those cases.

Claimant also points to statements by organs of the EU itself which it says confirm
the validity of the intra-EU BITs — in particular, the 2007 annual report of the EU’s
Economic and Financial Committee (“EFC”) in which the EFC argued for the
eventual termination of “remaining” intra-EU BITs and invited Member States to
address their concerns. In the subsequent annual report, the EFC noted that there are
over 190 intra-EU BITs and that the Commission had informed Member States of the
need to address the issue “through bilateral actions.” The 2008 EFC annual report

noted that “most Member States did not share the Commission’s concern in respect of

arbitration risks and discriminatory treatment of investors and a clear majority of

Member States preferred to maintain the existing agreements.”!!?

B. Inapplicability of the BIT’s Arbitration Clause BIT under Article 30 of
the Vienna Convention

Respondent’s Position

127.

128.

Respondent argues that even if Article 59 of the VCLT does not operate to terminate
the BIT, the Tribunal has no jurisdiction to decide this case because the arbitration
clause in the BIT is not “compatible” with the EC Treaty within the meaning of

Article 30 of the VCLT, which provides:

Successive Treaties Relating To The Same Subject Matter

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later
treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in
operation under article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent
that its provisions are compatible with those of the later treaty

Unlike Article 59, Article 30 requires no proof of the parties’ intentions and does not
relate to the incompatibility of the treaties as a whole, but rather to the incompatibility
of individual provisions. In this arbitration, Claimant asserts the Slovak Republic
violated Articles 3(1), 3(2), 4 and 5 of the BIT, all of which, according to Respondent,
were supplanted by EU law. Therefore, the dispute has to be solved under EU law.
However, the Tribunal lacks the competence to apply and interpret EU law.
According to Respondent, Article 30(3) of the VCLT therefore renders the arbitration

clause inapplicable, and the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to decide the case.

Claimant's Position

129.

Claimant argues against an application of Article 30(3) of the VCLT on the grounds
that the BIT and EC Treaty do not “relate to the same subject matter” (as previously
discussed) and that Article 8 is not incompatible with provisions of the EC Treaty (as

discussed in the context of Article 59(1)(b)).!!

'? Exhibits C-89, C-90. With respect to the statements of the EFC in its Annual Reports of 2006-2008, Respondent

submitted in its Jurisdiction Reply that these do not represent the opinions of the Commis

ion, and when read in context

 

they clearly imply, inter alia, that at least some of the provisions of the BIT have been superseded by EU law and the
Commission’s belief that the application of the BITs causes discrimination.

130. Claimant points out that the Eastern Sugar tribunal rejected the VCLT Article 30(3)
argument with respect to the arbitration clause. That tribunal found that “the fact that

[the EC Treaty] does not provide for a possibility for an investor to sue a host state
directly, and that in international BIT arbitration this is an essential feature of most
bilateral investment treaties, is in itself sufficient to reject the Czech Republic’s

equivalence argument.”! 4

131. Claimant’s responses to the European Commission’s observations on the applicability
of VCLT Article 30(3) in the present arbitration are discussed below at

paragraphs 205 to 207.

C. Inapplicability of the BIT and Incompetence of the Tribunal as a Matter
of EU Law

Respondent’s Position

132. In the alternative to a finding of inapplicability under the VCLT, Respondent argues
that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction as a matter of EU law, which the Tribunal is bound
to apply in accordance with Article 8(6) of the BIT. Article 8(6) provides as follows:

The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in
particular though not exclusively:
e the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

e the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements
between the Contracting Parties;

e the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;

e the general principles of international law.

133. According to Respondent, this provision obliges the Tribunal to take into account
EU law as part of the “law in force of the Contracting Party concerned.” By the
accession of the Slovak Republic to the EU, the acquis communautaire has become
part of the Slovak legal order with supremacy over other legal rules. The notion of

supremacy stems from both ECJ jurisprudence and the Constitution of the Slovak

Republic.' s

wut that Eastern Sugar is the only published decision dealing with the relationship between an intra-EU BIT and
EU law; but the tribunal in that case only did so through the prism of Article 59 of the VCLT, and not through

Respondent complained that Claimant had not complied with an order from the
Tribunal that it produce exchanged correspondence with the European Commission,
from a certain date range, relating to the alleged breach of EU law by the Slovak
Republic. As a result, Respondent requested the Tribunal to draw the following
adverse inference from Claimant’s failure to produce such correspondence: “the
Tribunal should consider it to be proved that the legal subject matter of the Dispute is
governed by EU law.”!!© However, because the ECJ has an “interpretive monopoly”
with regard to EU law under Articles 220 and 234 of the EC Treaty, and the Tribunal
lacks the competence to refer to the ECJ for a preliminary ruling, the Tribunal has no

jurisdiction to decide a dispute governed by EU law.'!7

Several of Claimant’s BIT complaints correspond to complaints under EU law. For
example, unlawful expropriation contrary to Article 5 of the BIT is also governed by
Article 6(2) of the EC Treaty and the ECHR, as well as by Articles 43 and 56 of the
EC Treaty on indirect expropriation. Parallel application of both EU law and the BIT
is not possible, according to Respondent, because of the supremacy and direct effect
of EU law. Respondent argues that as a matter of national law the supremacy of
EU law enables EU law to supersede the legal systems of its Member States,
including bilateral treaties concluded between Member States, as confirmed by the
Ecy."8 In support of this argument, Respondent points out that no intra-EU BITs

have ever been concluded between Member States after their accession to the EC/EU.

According to Respondent, the ECJ considers EU law to prevail over bilateral treaties
concluded between Member States as it does over rules of national law.'!? Thus,
EU law should be applicable and take priority over the provisions of the BIT.'°
Respondent concludes that “due to the fact that the subject matter regulated by the
BIT is comprehensively covered by EU law, the provisions of the BIT are no longer
applicable ... and thus the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to decide on the breach of the

EC Treaty is not given.”!7!

Respondent argues that, under the principles of direct applicability and supremacy of
EU law, intra7EU BITs are contrary to EU law. The unity of the acquis
communautaire does not allow for any difference in the position of EU law within the
legislation of individual Member States. Uniform application of EU law can only
occur when all member states accord priority to EU law over any other rule of law,
including the intra-EU BITs (supremacy of EU law), and provide for the direct and
immediate application of EU law (direct effect). Application of a rule of law
belonging to a legal system outside that of the EU would undermine the creation of
the internal market and result in the resolution of matters of EU law being removed

from the ambit of the ECJ.'??

At the hearing, Respondent acknowledged that with Frankfurt as the place of
arbitration and therefore with German law as the lex loci arbitri, the doctrine of
separability of the arbitration clause would apply in this case, but Respondent did not

consider this to be problematic.'?*

Respondent also acknowledged that all over
Europe there are arbitration tribunals, particularly in commercial arbitration, that
apply EU law on a regular basis. According to Respondent, such tribunals are wrong
to do so, as such questions of EU law should be sent to the ECJ for a preliminary

interpretation and arbitral tribunals have no competence to do so.

It was put to
Respondent that although a tribunal cannot make a reference to the ECJ, an arbitration
matter may end up before a national court and that national court may itself make a
reference to the ECJ. Respondent acknowledged this to be possible, but pointed out
that if the parties had agreed to a seat of arbitration outside of the ECJ, such as

Switzerland, there could be no referral to the Ecy.!?>

Claimant's Position

139.

 

In answer to Respondent’s argument referring to the applicable law under Article 8(6)
of the BIT, Claimant contends that the argument is (i) untimely and thus inadmissible,
(ii) incomprehensible, and (iii) in any event based on a misreading of Article 8(6) of

the BIT, which expressly permits the Tribunal to apply both the provisions of “this

Agreement and other relevant Agreements” as well as “the law in force of the

Contracting Party concerned.” 126

Claimant addresses Respondent’s request that the Tribunal draw from Eureko’s
non-production of certain correspondence with the European Commission the adverse
inference that “the legal subject matter of the dispute is governed by EU law.”
Claimant submits that the procedural history shows Respondent to have changed its
motive for requesting the documents, and that the requested inference is incapable of

being drawn from the documents in question.'?”

Claimant considers Respondent’s exposé about the principles of “supremacy” of EU
law over national law to be irrelevant. Claimant points out that the BIT is not a
national law but an instrument of public international law. EU law is not superior to
and does not take precedence over international law. A rule of international law is not
automatically rendered inapplicable if it contravenes a rule of EU law, and at most an
EU Member State may be obliged to amend or terminate such an international law
obligation. However such an international law obligation remains fully in force as

long as the Member State does not actually procure its amendment or termination.

Claimant explained at the hearing that under Respondent’s logic, every tribunal that
would touch upon an issue of EU law that a respondent considered to be controversial
would be forced to declare that it had no jurisdiction because the tribunal could not

26 October 2010

Under German law, an arbitral award issued in a non-arbitrable dispute may be set
aside by a German court under Section 1059(2)(2)(a) of the ZPO.'° Under
Section 1030 of the ZPO, disputes involving an economic interest can be the subject
of an arbitration agreement unless any other German legal regulation stipulates that

national courts have exclusive jurisdiction.

According to Respondent, EU law constitutes an integral part of the legal order
applicable in Germany as an EU Member State. Thus, any and all statutory
provisions of EU law governing the protection of investments constitute an integral
part of the German legal order. In this case, Claimant asserts a breach of both EU law
and the BIT. As the whole area covered by the BIT overlaps with legal regulations
arising under EU law, the Tribunal would inevitably be deciding on a breach of EU
law. EU law does not allow the conferral on an arbitral tribunal of jurisdiction over
the area covered by the BIT and therefore, Respondent argues, the dispute would be

non-arbitrable under Section 1030(3) of the ZPO.

Claimant's Position

146.

147.

Claimant considers that Respondent’s argument based on arbitrability must fail
because Article 8(6) obliges the Tribunal to apply EU law as one of the sources of
law. This is consistent with ECJ jurisprudence on the obligation upon arbitral
tribunals to apply EU law, subject to limited review by state courts subsequent to the

conclusion of arbitral proceedings.'*!

Claimant argues that if the ECJ were exclusively competent to interpret EU law, the
European Commission would not have invited Eureko “to seek redress ... through
arbitration and conciliation procedures available.” The fact that an arbitral tribunal
is not competent to raise preliminary questions before the ECJ does not render an
arbitration agreement invalid. Claimant observed that the Eastern Sugar tribunal

rejected a similar argument based on arbitrability brought by the Czech Republic.

E. Request to Submit the Dispute to ECJ or Stay the Arbitration Pending
ECJ Decision

Respondent’s Position

148. As an alternative to a finding that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction, Respondent requests
that, in the event the Tribunal finds itself competent to submit the request for a
preliminary ruling of the ECJ, the Tribunal (i) submit such a request to the ECJ after
consulting the Parties; and (ii) stay the arbitration pending the ECJ’s decision." As
discussed below at paragraphs 197 to 203, Respondent is supportive of a similar

proposal put by the European Commission.
Claimant's Position

149. Claimant’s primary objective in having filed a complaint with the European
Commission was to remain active as a health insurer in the Slovak Republic and thus
help persuade the Slovak government to change its approach. Having filed the
complaint, proceedings between the European Commission and an EU Member State
are out of the control of the complainant. The complaint proceedings must be seen as
complementary to the BIT arbitration, instigated under two different treaties and two

- . 3
sets of procedural and substantive norms.'**4

150. Claimant opposes Respondent’s suggestions that the arbitral proceedings be stayed
and that the Tribunal submit a request to the ECJ, because the Tribunal is not
competent to do so. As discussed below at paragraphs 204 to 211, Claimant similarly
rejects a proposal by the European Commission that the Tribunal suspend the

arbitration.

F. Request that the European Commission be Invited to Participate in the
Arbitration

Respondent’s Position

represented by the European Commission, to participate in the jurisdictional phase of

the proceedings as an amicus curiae to express the EU’s view on the application of

the BIT."

Claimant's Position

152.

153.

154.

Bs

In its written submissions, Claimant opposes the suggestion that the European
Commission be invited to submit an amicus brief, on the basis that this would result in
additional delay and costs and could not in any event be relevant or decisive with
respect to the Tribunal’s consideration of its jurisdiction on the basis of Article 8 of

the BIT.'*°

At the hearing, Claimant compared the relevance of what the European Commission
thinks about the validity of the BIT with what the two contracting parties to the BIT
think about the validity of the BIT. As with Eureko’s views, the European
Commission’s views on the validity of the BIT are not relevant to the application of
Article 59 of the VCLT. That is why Claimant considered the correspondence
between Eureko and the Commission to be irrelevant in the document production
phase. It is also why Claimant considered it unnecessary (not to mention a possible
source of delay) for the European Commission to be invited to participate as an
amicus curiae in the arbitration. By contrast, the views of the Slovak Republic and
Netherlands, being contracting parties to the BIT, directly weigh on the question of
“intention” for purposes of Article 59 of the VCLT. That is why Claimant argues that

OBSERVATIONS FROM THE NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT AND THE
EUROPEAN COMMISSION

At the conclusion of the 24 April 2010 hearing, the Tribunal consulted with the
Parties about the possibility of approaching the Government of the Netherlands and

the European Commission for written observations. It was agreed that such

were requested in order to keep the proceedings as efficient as possible.'*

A. Written Observations of the Netherlands Government
1. Netherlands Government Letter of 10 June 2010

155. On 10 June 2010, the Netherlands Government, by letter from the Ministry of
Economic Affairs, responded to the Tribunal’s invitation to provide observations with
regard to the question whether or not the BIT is still legally valid and subsequently

whether or not the Tribunal has jurisdiction to adjudicate this claim.

156. The Netherlands Government noted that the BIT was in force long before the Slovak
Republic’s accession to the European Union. The Government concurred with the
following statements made by the European Commission quoted in the Eastern Sugar

partial award:

However the effective prevalence of the EU acquis does not entail, at the same
time, the automatic termination of the concerned BITs or, necessarily, the non-
application of all their provisions. Without prejudice to the primacy of
Community law, to terminate these agreements, Member States would have to
strictly follow the relevant procedure provided for this in regard in the
agreements themselves. Such termination cannot have a retroactive effect.

157. The Netherlands Government noted that according to ECJ jurisprudence, the EU must

respect international law in the exercise of its powers, in particular with respect to the

oo . -: . «139
termination and suspension of international treaties.

158. |The Netherlands Government emphasised that the legal validity of the BIT is:

solely governed by Article 13(2) of the BIT, and where necessary by the
Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and general public international
law. Thus, this BIT can only be terminated by informing — at least 6 months
before — the other Contracting Party about its intention to terminate the BIT.
The Netherlands so far has never received any indication from the Slovak
Government that it has the intention to terminate the BIT. Similarly, the
Slovak Government so far has also not expressed towards the Netherlands
Government its wish to renegotiate the BIT. Nor did The Netherlands express
any intention in this direction towards the Slovak Republic.

159. The Netherlands Government referred to the letter it had provided to Claimant’s
counsel in response to a request in January 2010. After receipt of that letter, the

26 October 2010

Netherlands approached the Slovak Republic officially in order to confirm that the
BIT remains fully in force, and in order to receive a confirmation to that effect by the
Slovak Republic. As at 10 June 2010, the Slovak Republic had provided oral and

informal assurances of the BIT’s validity.

The Netherlands Government stated that the conditions in Article 54 of the VCLT for
the termination of a treaty, namely termination in conformity with the provisions of
the Treaty or by consent of all parties after consultation with the other contracting

States, had not been met here. !°

The Netherlands Government concluded that:

The Netherlands affirms again that the BIT in question in this dispute
continues to be fully in force. Consequently, there is also no reason to doubt
the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal in this dispute. Accordingly, Article 8
of the BIT, which prescribes international arbitration as a dispute settlement
tool for disputes between an investor and a Contracting Party, is fully
applicable. In the view of The Netherlands, European Union law aspects
cannot and do not affect in a way the existing jurisdiction of this Arbitral
Tribunal. Thus, this Arbitral Tribunal should fully exercise its jurisdiction and
adjudicate this dispute.

On a more general level, the Netherlands Government stated that it was aware of
recent developments regarding BITs and EU law. First, the Extra-EU BIT Cases were
not directly relevant for the present dispute; but in order to accommodate these
judgments, all Member States and the European Commission were in close
discussions with each other “to adopt a common attitude.” Second, with the entry into
force of the Lisbon Treaty on 1 December 2009, a transfer of competence from the
Member States to the EU has taken place regarding foreign direct investments and the
protection of investments as laid down in Article 207 of the TFEU. According to the
Netherlands Government, the way the EU will exercise this new power still needs to

be determined.
Finally, the Netherlands Government observed that:

Currently, the European Union Member States are awaiting proposals from the
European Commission regarding the future policy towards the new competence
pursuant to article 207 TFEU, which will also touch upon the matter of existing
BITs of the Member States. The Netherlands is actively involved in working
towards a practical solution that takes into account the concerns of the European

 

“The termination of a treaty or the withdrawal of a party may take place: (a) in conformity with
ns of the treaty; or (b) at any time by consent of all the parties after consultation with the other contracting

  

States.”

Commission, while at the same time secures the interests of the Member States
and the protection of investors in the European Union.

Considering this ongoing process between the Member States and the
European Commission, The Netherlands deems it inappropriate to anticipate
or even predetermine the question of the status of intra-EU BITs in the present
dispute before an international ad hoc Arbitral Tribunal. Legal certainty for all
Contracting Parties to BITs and for investors and their investments is of the
utmost importance to the Netherlands. Therefore, casting any doubt on the
legal validity of existing intra-EU BITs would be unnecessarily harmful and
undermine the rights and legitimate expectations of investors relying on
existing BITs.

2. Netherlands Government Letter of 23 June 2010 appending

Note Verbale from the Slovak Republic
On 23 June 2010, the Netherlands Government sent a further letter to the Arbitral
Tribunal attaching a Note Verbale received by the Netherlands Government from the
Slovak Ministry of Foreign Affairs in response to a request from the Netherlands

Government on 4 May 2010.
The Slovak Note Verbale included the following statement:

According to competent authority of the Slovak Republic, the Ministry of the
Finance of the Slovak Republic, the validity of the BIT has not been
terminated in accordance with article 13 of the BIT.

However, according to competent authority of the Slovak Republic, the
Ministry of the Finance of the Slovak Republic it is nonetheless important to
analyze the issue as to whether the BIT is valid and applicable, since the
validity and applicability of the BITs concluded between EU Member States
have been repeatedly challenged in investment disputes and also in debates
between International Law experts and European Law experts, as well as
among EU Member States.

In light of those observations, the Slovak Republic invited the Netherlands “to
commence discussions regarding the validity and applicability of the BIT,” while
inviting other EU Member States and the European Commission to join these

discussions:

Only within the scope of this broad discussion it is possible find a common
solution and eliminate the current legal uncertainty.

The Ministry of Finance of the Slovak Republic deems this issue to be of the
utmost importance for the future of investment protection in Europe.

3. Parties’ comments on Netherlands Government observations and
Slovak Republic Note Verbale

Respondent’s Position

167.

168.

169.

170.

Respondent notes that the observations of the Netherlands Government do not
exhaustively consider the legal status of intra-EU BITs. Indeed, the observations
should have “no substantial impact on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal,” because “the
Netherlands Government failed to substantiate its assertions ... omitted to present its
observations with respect to the inapplicability of the BIT as a result of its
incompatibility with the EC Treaty,” and relied on only one portion of the European

Commission’s views as cited in the controversial Eastern Sugar award.!"!

In relation to the Netherlands Government’s reference to Article 54 of the Vienna
Convention, Respondent notes that Article 54 does not purport to contain an

exhaustive list of means to terminate a treaty.'”

According to Respondent, the Netherlands Government misinterprets the alleged
confirmation by the Slovak Republic of the validity of the BIT. By its Note Verbale,
the Slovak Republic merely confirmed that the BIT had not been terminated by means
of the procedure under Article 13 of the BIT (a fact never contested by Respondent.)
The Note Verbale actually reiterates the importance of considering the validity and
applicability of the BIT. In this context, the Slovak Republic invited the Netherlands
and other Member States to participate in discussions that might lead to a common

solution to the legal uncertainty.“

Respondent thus concludes that the observations from the Netherlands Government

are not persuasive with respect to the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection.

Claimant's Position

171.

172.

Claimant emphasises that the observations of the Netherlands leave no doubt

whatsoever that the Netherlands considers the “the BIT ... is still fully in force.”

According to Claimant, the Slovak Republic “has also in effect admitted that the BIT
has not terminated,” though according to the Note Verbale the Slovak Republic
confirmed only that the BIT has not “terminated under its own provisions.”

the ambiguous language in the Note Verbale that it is “important” to “analyse”
validity of the BIT, Claimant considers that the Slovak Republic’s position is

inconsistent and disingenuous. Claimant thus states:

If the Slovak Republic had truly believed that the BIT had terminated as of its
EU accession, it could have simply communicated so to its treaty partner (and
to Eureko upon notification of a claim under the BIT). Its failure to give that
simple confirmation evidences that the Slovak Republic is not truly convinced
that the BIT has terminated...

Claimant concludes that there can be no doubt the BIT is a treaty in force that has not

terminated under Article 59 of the VCLT.

With respect to incompatibility, Claimant notes that the Netherlands considers that
“European Union law aspects cannot and do not affect in a way the existing
jurisdiction of this Arbitral Tribunal.” Claimant also notes the absence of any
argument in the Slovak Republic’s Note Verbale that the arbitration clause is not

applicable. 4

B. Written Observations of the European Commission

On 7 July 2010, the European Commission submitted detailed observations in
response to the Tribunal’s invitation to update and elaborate upon the observations

that had been submitted in 2006 to the tribunal in Eastern Sugar.

1. Distinction between extra-EU BITs and intra-EU BITs

At the outset of its observations, the Commission distinguishes between extra-EU
BITs (of which there are over 1000) and intra-EU BITs (of which there are

‘5 The Commission’s concerns about extra-EU BITs relate to

approximately 190).
questions of treaty making competence and incompatibility with mandatory EC law
relating to investment, other capital movements and payments. With the entry into
force of the Lisbon Treaty, the EU has exclusive competence in respect of foreign
direct investment as part of the common commercial policy (TFEU, Art. 207(1),
Art. 3(1)(e)). The Commission refers to a new proposal for an EU Regulation
establishing the terms and procedures under which Member States are authorised to
maintain in force, amend or conclude extra-EU BITs. That proposal expressly does

not encompass intra-EU BITs. According to the Commission, “unlike intra-EU BITs,

it is important to clarify that the European Commission does not take issue with third
party arbitration mechanisms set out in these BITs entered into with non-EU

countries.”

The Commission’s concerns with intra~-EU BITs are of “a different order” and relate
to the compatibility of such BITs with mandatory provisions of EU law and with the
EU’s judicial system.'*6 Intra-EU BITs amount to an “anomaly within the EU
internal market.” There is at the very least a partial overlap between intra-EU BITs
and the internal market provisions of the EU, and this calls into question the

permissibility of the continued existence of intra-EU BITs.

In the EU judicial system, the Luxembourg courts have exclusive jurisdiction
(i) to determine, in infringement proceedings, whether EU Member States have
fulfilled their EU law obligations, and (ii) to give preliminary rulings on questions of
EU law as requested by EU domestic courts and tribunals. EU Member States are
prevented from submitting their disputes to “any other method of dispute settlement”
under the principle established in the “MOX Plant” case between the UK and Ireland,
in which the ECJ found that it had exclusive jurisdiction in resolving a dispute
between two EU Member States that was at least partially covered by EU law.'*7 As
a consequence, EU Member States that resort to an inter-State arbitration mechanism
provided for under an intra-EU BIT for matters partially covered by EU law, are in

breach of Article 344 of the TFEU.

For investor-State arbitration, under a BIT, an international tribunal independent from
the host State may be seized with the matter; but under the EU judicial system,
investors must either address a national court (which may or must refer questions of
interpretation to the ECJ) or alternatively call on the Commission to initiate
infringement proceedings. According to the Commission, “the arguments in favour of
maintaining an investor-State arbitration mechanism for intra-EU BITs are not

persuasive from an internal EU law perspective.”'“*

The Commission asserts that where there is a conflict with EU law, the rule of pacta
sunt servanda does not apply to agreements between EU Member States, because of

the jurisprudence establishing that “EU law takes supremacy not only over the

national legal systems, but also over bilateral agreements concluded between Member
States.” This applies to pre-accession bilateral treaties between Member States. The
ECJ has consistently held that in cases of conflict between bilateral agreements

between Member States and EU law, the latter prevails.' The Commission explains:

[A]s a result of the supremacy of EU law vis-a-vis pre-accession treaties
between Member States, conflicts between BIT provisions and EU law cannot
be resolved by interpreting and applying the relevant EU law provisions in the
light of the BIT. Only the inverse approach is possible, namely interpretation
of the BIT norms in the light of EU law. The foregoing has implications as
regards the ability of private parties (investors) to rely on provisions of an
intra-EU BIT that are in conflict with EU law. Under EU law, a private party
cannot rely on provision: an international agreement to 'y_a_ possible
breach of EU law. This includes resort to judicial settlement mechanisms that
conflict with the EU judicial system. Furthermore, in the EU legal system,
national legislation of an EU Member State that is incompatible with EU law
does not become ‘invalid’; it merely cannot be applied where it conflicts with
EU law. The same applies in the Commission’s view, to existing intra-7EU
BITs that contain provisions that are incompatible with EU law: neither the
BIT as such nor the conflicting provisions become ‘invalid’; but they cannot
be applied where they conflict with EU law. [emphasis in original]

 

 

Even when general principles of law, including the Vienna Convention, are followed,
“the conclusion cannot be any different: for all states that accede to the EU, the EU
treaties are to be regarded as a ‘later treaty’, /ex posterior.” The pacta sunt servanda
tule only applies to extra-EU BITs.' This results from an unambiguous conflict rule
that forms part of the acquis communautaire that Member States sign up to when they
join the EU.

The Commission notes that its continued concerns regarding the compatibility of

intra-EU BITs with EU law are well known to all Member States, and claims that:!>!

Eventually, all intra-7EU BITs will have to be terminated. Commission
services intend to contact all Member States again, urging them to take
concrete steps soon. Furthermore, while the Commission is in favour of
consensual solutions with EU Member States, as guardian of the EU treaties it
cannot exclude eventually having to resort to infringement proceedings against
certain Member States.

2. Discrimination issues with intra-EU BITs

The Commission considers there is serious potential for discrimination between

EU investors from different Member States, which is incompatible with EU law. That

is because some investors are covered by a BIT and granted the opportunity to resort
to investor-State arbitration while others are not. Arbitration is seen by some as more
attractive, though the Commission does not accept that arbitration is more efficient
than redress through national courts or through a complaint to the Commission. In
any event, the availability of a choice of dispute resolution procedures gives some
investors an advantage over investors from other Member States, and thus constitutes

forbidden discrimination against those other EU nationals.'°?

The Commission rejects the suggestion that discrimination be resolved positively, not
by eliminating the investor-State arbitration mechanism but by extending the
preferential treatment to all investors from other EU countries. Such a suggestion is
unacceptable from an institutional EU law perspective and misunderstands the EU
judicial system, which is “firmly opposed to the ‘outsourcing’ of disputes involving
EU law” to tribunals outside the EU courts, for the reasons set out by the ECJ in the
MOxX Plant case.'*

3. Competing judicial and arbitral mechanisms

The Commission considers that granting the opportunity for arbitration to all investors
would “inevitably promote competing judicial and arbitral mechanisms, increase
‘forum shopping’ by litigants and contribute to the risk of further fragmentation of

international law.” The Commission explains:

Continued resort to outside dispute settlement mechanisms by EU subjects
based on intra-EU BITs also reveals mistrust in the courts of EU Member
States. This has no place in the current post-enlargement context, which is
rooted in mutual trust between Member States and founded on the development
of a common favourable investment environment. Mutual trust in the
administration of justice in the European Union is one of the principles regarded
as necessary by the European Court of Justice for the sound operation of the
internal market.

The Commission also contests Eureko’s assertion that a damages award would be
unavailable to it under the EU legal system, and recalls the well-settled and “inherent”
principle established by the ECJ in Francovich that a victim has a right to

compensation for damage caused as a result of breaches of EU law.'*4

4, Termination of the Dutch-Slovak BIT is desirable but has not
happened automatically under VCLT Article 59

With respect to the BIT in this arbitration, the Commission states that “both EU
Member States should terminate this type of bilateral agreement.” However, the
Commission acknowledges that neither party appears to have taken any decisive step
formally to terminate this BIT. The Commission does not discern in the 2003 Act of
Accession any intention of the parties to abrogate earlier intra7EU BITs. The
Commission thus agrees that “the entire Dutch-Slovak BIT has not been implicitly
terminated or suspended by virtue of Article 59(1) of the Vienna Convention.”
However, the Commission argues that “EU law prevails, which means that private

parties are not entitled to rely on EU-inconsistent provisions of this agreement.” 15s

5. Some BIT provisions are inapplicable under VCLT Article 30(3)

According to the Commission, even where it appears the BIT is not rendered invalid
or terminated as a whole, those provisions of a BIT that are inconsistent with EU law
cannot be applied. The Commission observes that Eureko has invoked EU law as
well as breaches of the BIT to support its contention that the Slovak Republic failed to
offer fair and equitable treatment and restricted the freedom of capital movement with
respect to its investment. The Commission recalls that Eureko lodged a complaint
with the Commission based in part on the same grievances as the arbitration claim,
and that this led to infringement proceedings being opened against the Slovak
Republic. The Commission states that the investigation is currently ongoing, but is
“unable at this stage to disclose the scope of its investigation into the Slovak

legislation and administrative practice.”!*6

The Commission asserts that the Tribunal is bound to take EU law into account by
virtue of Article 8(6) of the BIT. Both as a matter of the internal EU conflict rules of
supremacy, and as a matter of public international law, the Tribunal cannot apply

provisions of the BIT that are incompatible with EU law.

The Commission argues that Article 30(3) of the VCLT applies where two treaties
cover the “same subject matter” and provisions of the earlier treaty are “incompatible”

with those of the later treaty, and that both of these conditions are satisfied here.

E-SR Award on Jurisdiction, etc.

26 October 2010

On the “same subject matter” element, the Commission argues that the Eastern Sugar
tribunal was mistaken in holding that the BIT and EC Treaty do not cover the same
subject matter because it “it did not inquire correctly into the standards of ‘sameness’
under Article 30 of the Vienna Convention. Rather it simply assumed that the two
treaties would have to relate to ‘the same precise subject matter.’” The Commission
argues that the better approach, and that of the ILC, is that the two treaties need only
be of a “similar or comparable degree of generality” so that their parallel operation
could lead to incompatible results. In the instant case, both the BIT and the TFEU
“would have a normative claim to rule on the legality of Slovakian Health Care
legislation. It follows that the two treaties relate to ‘the same subject matter’ within
the meaning of Article 30 of the Vienna Convention.” There can be no doubt that the
treaties pursue similar objectives. Comparing various provisions in the two treaties in
both the establishment and post-establishment phase of an investment, the
Commission concludes that the BIT and the TFEU relate to “the same subject matter”

within the meaning of Article 30 of the Vienna Convention.

On the “incompatibility” element, while the Commission believes there is no
“incompatibility” within the meaning of Article 59(1)(b) of the Vienna Convention
between the BIT in its entirety and the TFEU, there is “incompatibility” of certain

provisions, within the meaning of Article 30(3) of the Vienna Convention.
The Commission takes the view that:'°”

There are some provisions of the Dutch-Slovak BIT “that raise fundamental
questions regarding compatibility with EU law. Most prominent among these
are the provisions of the BIT providing for an investor-State arbitral mechanism
(set out in Art. 8), and the provisions of the BIT providing for an inter-State
arbitral mechanism (set out in Art. 10). These provisions conflict with EU law
on the exclusive competence of EU courts for claims which involve EU law,
even for claims where EU law would only partially be affected. The European

Commission must therefore ... express its reservation with respect to the
Arbitral Tribunal’s competence to arbitrate the claim brought before it by
Eureko B.V.

6. Suspension of proceedings until doubts resolved by ECJ

The Commission believes that were this Tribunal to proceed now, there would be a
real risk that it might come to a different view than the Commission (which is dealing
with the pending infringement case) or eventually, the ECJ. Thus, the Commission

states:

‘57 European Commission Observations, {| 80.

54

195.

196.

E-SR Award on Jurisdiction, etc.
26 October 2010

The prospect of two conflicting decisions involving EU law is most unwelcome.
In addition, there is a related risk that the Arbitral Tribunal might render an
award that is not compatible with EU law. An arbitral award that has been
rendered in violation of EU law may not be executed and enforced in an
EU Member State. A Member State that would do so nonetheless, risks
infringement proceedings.

Accordingly, the Commission proposes a similar course of action to that in the MOX
Plant case, where the arbitral tribunal concluded that:

In the circumstances, and bearing in mind considerations of mutual respect and

comity which should prevail between judicial institutions both of which may be

called upon to determine rights and obligations as between two States, the

Tribunal considers that it would be inappropriate for it to proceed further with

hearing the Parties on the merits of the dispute in the absence of a resolution of

the problems referred to. Moreover, a procedure that might result in two

conflicting decisions on the same issue would not be helpful to the resolution of

the dispute between the Parties.
The Commission suggests that this Tribunal suspend the present arbitration because:
(i) EU law forms part of the law that this Tribunal must apply by virtue of Article 8(6)
of the BIT and the fact that Eureko itself invokes EU law; (ii) the EU law to be
applied includes the principle of exclusive competence of the EU courts in respect of
disputes between EU law subjects that involve EU law; (iii) the Commission has
already opened an infringement case against the Slovak Republic in connection with
Eureko’s complaints; and (iv) the “considerations of mutual respect and comity” form
part of the general principles of law that the Tribunal must apply by virtue of
Article 8(6) of the BIT.

7. Parties’ comments on the European Commission’s observations

Respondent’s Comments

197.

Respondent considers that the Commission’s observations are “of the utmost
importance” to the Tribunal’s jurisdictional decision. The observations confirm the

significance of the Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection and thus undermine Claimant’s

158

accusations that Respondent has brought a frivolous challenge. In this respect,

Respondent draws the Tribunal’s attention to an e-mail from the Commission of
19 July 2010 inviting Member States to meet to discuss their views and concerns

regarding intra-EU BITs. 159

26 October 2010

Respondent draws support from the Commission’s position that the BIT and
EC Treaty relate to the “same subject matter” in light of the purposes of both treaties,
the content of the basic freedoms, the procedural protections offered (including the
right to damages) and the significance of the Extra-EU BIT Cases. Claimant’s
preference for a narrow interpretation of “same subject matter,’ by contrast, is

rejected by the Commission.'©

Respondent acknowledges that the Commission found no explicit statement of the
Contracting Parties that the BIT should be terminated, but points out that the
Commission did not focus on evidence of the Contracting Parties’ intention that as of
the date of accession EU law should govern investment protection as contained in the

BIT.!°!

Respondent notes that the Commission did not examine in depth the question of
incompatibility of the BIT and EU law. Nevertheless, Respondent concludes from the
Commission’s observations that “in every case whereby an investor claiming the
breach of the BIT is simultaneously entitled to claim a breach of the EC Treaty
(TFEU), the parallel operation of both treaties is precluded. Due to the principle of
supremacy, the exclusive jurisdiction of the EU courts and finally as consequence of
the discriminatory effects of the BIT, the invocation of such an Arbitration Clause

would therefore breach EU law.”!

According to Respondent, the Commission “unambiguously expresses that from the
perspective of EU law, the European legal norms automatically supersede any other
national norms, including intra-EU international treaties, from the moment they
conflict, with every intersection between intra-EU BITs and EU law having thus to be

resolved in favour of EU law.” The principle of supremacy also applies “from the

perspective of international law.”!3

Respondent notes the Commission rejects Claimant’s stance on discrimination and on

the principle of the uniform application and interpretation of EU law. loa

Finally, Respondent is convinced that “the Tribunal in the present case is facing the

same circumstances and therefore should follow the example of the MOX Plant

Claimant highlights that the Commission unequivocally confirms that the BIT has
“not been implicitly terminated or suspended by virtue of Article 59(1) of the Vienna
Convention” and that this is consistent with the view already been expressed in

Eastern Sugar. 166

With respect to inapplicability of the arbitration clause under Article 30 of the VCLT,
Claimant considers the Commission’s observations run contrary to ECJ jurisprudence
and are internally inconsistent. Claimant suggests that the Commission’s positions
are “induced by political doctrine rather than legal reasoning,” citing as examples of
opinionated statements the Commission’s remarks that (i) intra-7EU BITs are “an
anomaly within the EU internal market,” and (ii) intra-EU BIT arbitrations conducted
to date “reveal mistrust in the courts of the EU Member States” which has “no place

in the current post-enlargement context.”!®7

Claimant argues that questions of supremacy of EU law are only relevant after it is

established that an incompatibility exists.

Claimant describes the Commission’s analysis with respect to discrimination as a
basis of incompatibility as “inconsistent” and “irreconcilable.” On the one hand, the
Commission notes that some investors will have the opportunity to resort to
arbitration while others do not. On the other hand, the Commission states that the
systems of enforcement of investor rights under the BIT and TFEU offer “at least
equivalent protection,” and the Commission denies that arbitration is “more efficient”
than redress before national courts. In any event, Claimant maintains that it is not the
offer of arbitration that is discriminatory, but the refusal to grant a similar benefit to
other EU investors.'°* Claimant points out that the ECJ did not find discrimination in
the Extra-EU BIT Cases. Claimant also notes as “telling” the fact that the
Commission has never brought an infringement case against a Member State with an

intra-EU BIT in place.

Claimant also criticises the Commission’s position on the competence of an arbitral
tribunal to resolve EU law disputes as being “devoid of reality.” Claimant notes that
numerous arbitral tribunals all over the EU render awards on a daily basis that involve
the application of EU law, and such practice is fully accepted, even mandated, by the
ECJ since the Nordsee case.'© According to Claimant, this long-standing ECJ case
law is ignored by the Commission and runs contrary to the Commission’s assertion of

the “exclusive competence of EU courts for claims which involve EU law.”

Claimant distinguishes the MOX Plant case from the present case. MOX Plant was
based on UNCLOS, a treaty that explicitly provides that dispute resolution procedures
in regional treaties shall have precedence over those contained in UNCLOS. Further,
the MOX Plant case was between two EU Member States, thus falling under TFEU
Article 344, whereas the present case between a Member State and a private party
falls under no such EU law provision. For these two reasons, MOX Plant should not
be applied to suspend the proceedings in this arbitration. A suspension would in any

event “bring nothing but unacceptable delay.”!”°

Claimant also observes that: (i) the Commission itself had advised Eureko to turn to
arbitration;!”! (ii) the Commission has advocated the use of investor-state arbitration
in the context of extra-EU BITs and described it as an “established feature” of
investment agreements essential to attracting investors;'”* and (iii) the Commission’s
position would reduce intra-EU BITs to meaningless agreements between states that

provide only unenforceable protections to private parties.!7°

Finally, Claimant complains that the Commission has neglected to fully inform the
Tribunal of its views and status of the infringement proceedings. According to
Claimant, the Commission’s initial conclusion, expressed in a November formal
notice, was that “the Slovak Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under the EC

Treaty.”

In April 2010, the Commission completely reversed its position and
informed Eureko that it intended to close the complaint procedure on the basis that

EU law does not apply to Eureko’s investment in the first place (because the freedom

of establishment and freedom of movement of capital do not apply).'”° According to
its 7 July 2010 observations, however, the Commission is apparently now looking
further into the facts of the infringement case and states that “EU law is incontestably
relevant to the dispute before the Arbitral Tribunal.” Claimant considers these
changes in position to be “disconcerting” and sufficient reason to reject the
Commission’s appeal to “considerations of mutual respect and comity ... between
judicial institutions.” Claimant is anxious that it will be left without a forum to
recover damages if it is denied arbitration and at the same time is confronted by
assertions from both the Commission and the Slovak Republic (in its 226-Reply) that

its dispute is not covered by the EU legal system.!7°

ANALYSIS BY THE TRIBUNAL

The Tribunal has considered carefully the submissions made by the Parties, as well as
the observations of the Government of the Netherlands and of the European
Commission, all of which were helpful and for all of which the Tribunal thanks their
respective authors. All of the points made in those submissions have been taken into
account by the Tribunal, even though it is not here necessary to address and decide in

turn each and every one of these submissions and observations.

In particular, the Tribunal wishes to emphasise that its decisions are here limited both
by the requirements of this particular case and by the scope of the arguments
presented by the Parties. This award is thus necessarily confined to the specific
circumstances of the present case; and the Tribunal does not here intend to decide any
general principles for other cases, however ostensibly analogous to this case they
might be. For example, this case arises from a BIT concluded in 1991 before the
CSFR Association Agreement, the Association Agreement and the Accession Treaty;
it does not arise from a multi-lateral treaty or a treaty to which the EU is a party or
signatory; and, moreover, these arbitration proceedings were instituted in 2008 before
the Lisbon Treaty came into force, amending the EU Treaty and the EC Treaty (now
the TFEU).

As a preliminary matter, the Tribunal must satisfy itself of the existence and extent of
its jurisdiction. It considers that its jurisdiction is fixed by laws (as explained further
below), and that such jurisdiction cannot here be created, continued or extended by
arguments based on the possible operation of doctrines of acquiescence, waiver or
estoppel in respect of acts or omissions of Respondent (or Claimant). In any event,
the Tribunal has not found it necessary to rest any part of its decision upon the
ostensible attitude of either Party to these arbitration proceedings — still less upon that
of the Government of the Netherlands or of the European Commission — to the
question of the status of the BIT or the existence, continuation or extent of the

jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

It is important to bear in mind, as a paramount factor relating to jurisdiction, that the
Tribunal is established by, and derives its powers (if any) from, the consent of the

Parties. That consent operates at two successive stages.

The first stage originates from the agreement between the Netherlands and the Slovak
Republic in Article 8 of the BIT dated 29 April 1991 that investors of one Contracting
Party'*! have a right to submit disputes with the other Contracting Party before an

arbitration tribunal. Article 8 (1) and (2) read as follows:

Article 8

(1) All disputes between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party concerning an investment of the latter shall if possible,
be settled amicably.

(2) Each Contracting Party hereby consents to submit a dispute referred to in
paragraph (1) of this Article, to an arbitral tribunal, if the dispute has not
been settled amicably within a period of six months from the date either
party to the dispute requested amicable settlement.

As a matter of international law, those provisions constitute an offer which can be

 

 

accepted by an investor. At this first stage, the Tribunal is concerned with the consent
of the Netherlands and the Slovak Republic as expressed in Article 8 of the BIT, to be

interpreted in accordance with international law and, in particular, the VCLT.

The second stage originates from the offer’s acceptance by Claimant, as an investor
and national of the Netherlands, here effected through the initiation of arbitral
proceedings under Article 8 of the BIT. Upon such acceptance there is consent
between the investor and the Contracting Party to submit to the jurisdiction of the
tribunal constituted in accordance with the BIT, in respect of the dispute referred to it.
Providing that all other conditions stipulated in the BIT, including those relating to
such matters as the nationality of the investor, the six-month delay and the
investment, have been met, the tribunal established in accordance with the BIT has at

least prima facie jurisdiction over the dispute.'*

This second stage operates both under international law and, here, also under German
law as the /ex loci arbitri applying to UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings where the

agreed place of arbitration is Frankfurt in the Federal Republic of Germany (within

'S!_As defined in Article 1(b) of the BIT: viz., “the term ‘investors’ shall comprise: i.e. natural persons having the nationality
of one of the Contracting Parties in accordance with its law; ii. legal persons constituted under the law of one of the
Contracting Parties.”

'S2 Unlike some BITs (such as the 1997 Germany-Philippines BIT, Article 9) the Netherlands-Slovak Republic BIT does not

explicitly confine the right to initiate arbitration to the investor; but it is not neces:

the meaning of Article 16 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules and § 1043 of the
German Arbitration Law, the Tenth Book of the German Code of Civil Procedure).
As a result, this is a German arbitration; and this Tribunal is an ad hoc German
arbitration tribunal subject to German law and not an international tribunal (such as an
ICSID tribunal under the 1965 Washington Convention). Germany is a founding

member of the EU; and German law includes, of course, EU law.

The Tribunal cannot derive any part of its jurisdiction or authority from EU law as
such: its jurisdiction is derived from the consent of the Parties to the dispute, in
accordance with the BIT and German law. Although EU law, as between the EU and
member States of the EU (including Respondent and the Netherlands, but not
Claimant), operates at the level of international law, EU law operates, as between the

Parties, as part of German law as the lex loci arbitri.

It is, however, possible that the Parties’ consent and the jurisdiction flowing from
such consent might be circumscribed not only by the terms of the BIT itself but also
both by international law applicable to the BIT and by provisions of German law
incorporating EU law. Indeed, as explained above, the consent of the Parties can be
or become qualified by the operation of legal provisions that lie outside the text of the

BIT, whether at the first stage or second stage (or both).

In the present case, Respondent argues, in effect, that EU law operates in this way.
EU law has, in Respondent’s submission, displaced or rendered inapplicable the
provisions of the BIT. Respondent also argues that the arbitration cannot proceed
because the dispute is non-justiciable under German law as the /ex loci arbitri. As
further explained below, this latter argument depends upon the non-arbitrability of the

dispute under EU law, as part of German law.'*?

In the view of the Tribunal, the proper framework for its analysis of these arguments
is, in the first place, the framework applicable to the legal instrument from which the
Tribunal derives its prima facie jurisdiction. Just as the Court of Justice of the
European Communities has held that its own perspective is dictated by the treaties
that established it,'** so the perspective of this Tribunal must begin with the

instrument by which and the legal order within which consent originated, i.e., the first

stage described above. That framework is the BIT and international law, including

applicable EU law.

Whatever legal consequences may result from the application of EU law, those
consequences must be applied by this Tribunal within the framework of the rules of
international law and not in disregard of those rules. Those consequences may
operate in a number of distinct ways. For example, EU law may affect the capacity of
a State to consent to an international treaty, or may affect the performance of
obligations under the treaty, or may be part of the law applicable to determine the
scope of obligations under the treaty, or may affect the manner in which disputes
arising under the treaty must be settled and the jurisdiction of tribunals established

outside the EU legal order. These distinctions are important in the present case.
Respondent puts forward its objections to jurisdiction under four broad headings:

A. Termination of the BIT under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention on

the Law of Treaties (‘VCLT’)

B. Inapplicability of the BIT under VCLT Article 30

Cc. Inapplicability of the BIT under EU law

Dz Non-arbitrability of the dispute under German law
In addition, Respondent has made submissions concerning the proper relationship

between this Tribunal and the institutions of the EU. These arguments and

submissions are considered in turn in the following paragraphs.

A. Termination of the BIT under Article 59 of the Vienna Convention

Respondent has been a State Party to the VCLT since 28 May 1993; and the
Netherlands since 9 April 1985.'85 While the VCLT does not apply retrospectively, it
is widely regarded as reflecting customary international law. Respondent has argued
on the basis of the provisions of the VCLT, and neither Party has suggested that the

tules set out in the provisions which it discusses are not applicable to the BIT.

VCLT Article 59 provides for the termination of treaties. It is convenient to set it out

in full at this point:

See above, note 11.

63

233.

234.

235.

E-SR Award on Jurisdiction, etc.
26 October 2010

Article 59. Termination or suspension of the operation
of a treaty implied by conclusion of a later treaty

A treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a
later treaty relating to the same subject matter and:

(a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that
the parties intended that the matter should be governed by that
treaty; or

(b) the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with
those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of
being applied at the same time.

The earlier treaty shall be considered as only suspended in operation if it
appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that such was the
intention of the parties.

The Tribunal rejects the submission that the BIT has been terminated in accordance

with the rules set out in VCLT Article 59. There are three main reasons for this

The first main reason is that the operation of VCLT Article 59 is subject to the
provisions of VCLT Article 65 (“Procedure to be followed with respect to invalidity,
termination, withdrawal from or suspension of the operation of a treaty”). WCLT

Article 65(1) — (3) read as follows:

Article 65. Procedure to be followed with respect to
invalidity, termination, withdrawal from or
suspension of the operation of a treaty

A party which, under the provisions of the present Convention, invokes
either a defect in its consent to be bound by a treaty or a ground for
impeaching the validity of a treaty, terminating it, withdrawing from it or
suspending its operation, must notify the other parties of its claim. The
notification shall indicate the measure proposed to be taken with respect to
the treaty and the reasons therefor.

If, after the expiry of a period which, except in cases of special urgency,
shall not be less than three months after the receipt of the notification, no
party has raised any objection, the party making the notification may carry
out in the manner provided in article 67 the measure which it has
proposed.

If, however, objection has been raised by any other party, the parties shall
seek a solution through the means indicated in article 33 of the Charter of
the United Nations.

In the view of the Tribunal, it is therefore clear from the text of the VCLT that the

invalidity or termination of a treaty must be invoked, according to the Article 65

64

E-SR Award on Jurisdiction, etc.

26 October 2010

procedure. The VCLT'* does not provide for the automatic termination of treaties by
operation of law (with the exception of treaties that conflict with rules of jus

cogens). 187

236. The Tribunal does not regard Respondent’s e-mail dated 5 April 2004188 as a
notification for the purposes of VCLT Article 65. That e-mail was phrased as a
request to be told the “unofficial position” of the addressees on Respondent’s proposal
to initiate a common procedure to “harmonize” BITs. It was not a notification to the
Netherlands that Respondent regarded the BIT as terminated. Moreover, the e-mail

appears not to have been followed up by Respondent.
237. VCLT Article 65(5) provides that:

5. Without prejudice to article 45,!"*"! the fact that a State has not previously
made the notification prescribed in paragraph | shall not prevent it from
making such notification in answer to another party claiming performance
of the treaty or alleging its violation.

238. In the present case it is not “another party” to the treaty that is alleging its violation.
Claimant is not a party to the BIT, which was concluded by the Netherlands and (via
the initial ratification by Czechoslovakia) the Slovak Republic, now Respondent. It
is, however, not necessary for the Tribunal to decide whether VCLT Article 65(5)
would permit Respondent to give a notification of invalidity in answer to a request for
arbitration made by an investor under the BIT, because the Tribunal considers that in
any event the other conditions for the application (and hence the invocation under

Article 65) of VCLT Article 59 are not met.

239. The second main reason for dismissing this objection to jurisdiction is that the
application of VCLT Article 59 is expressly limited to situations where there are
successive treaties “relating to the same subject-matter.” (see Article 59(1) cited
above). The same phrase appears in VCLT Article 30 in a different context; but while

the notion of “sameness” may be common to those two instances, the manner in

from or suspending the operation of a treaty. A State may no longer invoke a ground for invalidating, terminating,
withdrawing from or suspending the operation of a treaty under articles 46 to 50 or articles 60 and 62 if, after becoming
aware of the facts: (a) it shall have expressly agreed that the treaty is valid or remains in force or continues in operation,
as the case may be; or (b) it must by reason of its conduct be considered as having acquiesced in the validity of the treaty
or in its maintenance in force or in operation, as the case may be.” Article 45 is not applicable in the present case.

26 October 2010
which the overlap between the treaties is approached is manifestly not common. This

is evident from the roles accorded by the VCLT to Articles 30 and 59.

Article 59 is concerned only with the termination of the entire treaty. Article 30, in
contrast, is concerned with the priority between particular provisions of earlier and
later treaties relating to the same subject-matter.!° While Article 30 is, therefore,
focused on particular provisions, the question under Article 59 is whether the entire
treaty should be terminated by reason of the adoption of a later treaty relating to the
same subject-matter. The very fact that these situations are treated separately in the
VCLT points to the need under Article 59 for a broader overlap between the earlier

and later treaties than would be needed to trigger the application of Article 30.

This conclusion is borne out by a comparison of the terms of Article 30 and
Article 59. Under Article 30 the test is whether the two successive treaty provisions
are “compatible.” Under Article 59 the test is whether the provisions of the later
treaty are “so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are
not capable of being applied at the same time.” Article 30 may be triggered by the
slightest incompatibility between the provisions of the earlier and later treaties.

Article 59 clearly requires a broader incompatibility between the two treaties.

Nothing in Article 59 requires that the two treaties should be in all respects co-
extensive; but the later treaty must have more than a minor or incidental overlap with
the earlier treaty. In any event, it is also necessary, as Article 59 expressly stipulates,
that either (a) it appears from the later treaty or is otherwise established that the
parties intended the later treaty to govern the subject-matter or (b) the provisions of
the treaties that relate to the subject-matter are so far incompatible as to preclude the
concurrent application of the two treaties. One or other limb of that test must be

satisfied if WCLT Article 59 is to operate.

The Tribunal observes that while test (b) requires incompatibility between treaty
provisions, test (a) does not. Test (a) would apply even in circumstances where
successive treaties contain identical provisions. The result would be that it is the
provisions in the later treaty that govern. That may be significant for questions of

jurisdiction that turn upon the date of the governing instrument, for example.

' This point was explained by the ILC in its Commentary on the draft of article 59 (then numbered article 56): see
http://untreaty.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/commentaries/1_1_1966.pdf, at pp. 252-3 (paragraph 4).

26 October 2010

In the present case, the Tribunal does not consider that either of the two tests is met.
As far as an intention that the later treaty should “govern the matter” is concerned, it
is plainly established that the Parties to the BIT — Respondent and the Netherlands —
subsequently intended that EU law should apply in full between them. There is,
however, no evidence of any intention that the provisions of EU law should result in
the termination of the entire BIT. Nothing in the text of the EU treaties produces that
result; and the necessary intention is not established by extraneous evidence. Indeed,
such evidence as there is indicates that there was no or, at least, no clear intention that
the BIT should be terminated by any of the CSFR Association Agreement, the

Association Agreement, the Accession Treaty or the Lisbon Treaty.

Moreover, the BIT establishes extensive legal rights and duties that are neither
duplicated in EU law nor incompatible with EU law. The protections afforded to
investors by the BIT are, at least potentially, broader than those available under
EU law (or, indeed, under the laws of any EU Member State). Those rights and duties
are central to the purpose of the BIT. This, too, indicates that no intention that

EU law should entirely displace the BIT can be inferred.

The claims in this case are made under Articles 3(1) (fair and equitable treatment;
non-discrimination), Article 3(2) (full protection and security; non-discrimination),
Article 4 (free transfer of profits and dividends), and Article 5 (expropriation),

pursuant to Article 8 (investor-state arbitration) of the Bir.!”!

26 October 2010

The question of the relationship between free transfer of capital under a BIT and free
movement of capital under EU law arose in the Extra-EU BIT cases. The European
Court of Justice held in those cases that the BIT “free transfer” provisions might be a
bar to limitations on free movement of capital imposed under EU law, which
EU Member States would be obliged to implement, and that the compatibility of the
BIT with EU law could not be ensured. The Court considered that there was no
adequate mechanism under international law that would allow an EU Member State to
derogate from its BIT obligations in respect of the free movement of capital in order

to fulfil its obligations under EU law.

The situation in the present case is different. The situation would not be one in which
the EU State sought to invoke its internal law (including EU law) against an investor
from a non-EU State in order to derogate from its BIT obligations.'”? In the present
case, both the EU State and the investor from another EU State would be subject to
the same provisions of EU law. It is, accordingly, at least arguable that there is no
incompatibility between the BIT and EU law on this point. The Tribunal does,
however, accept that it is at least arguable that there is a duplication of rights to free
movement of capital, which exist both under the BIT and under EU law. Nonetheless,
that fact cannot determine the question of jurisdiction here because the Tribunal
considers that the other material BIT provisions are not duplicated in EU law, quite

apart from Article 8 of the BIT.

The Tribunal does not accept the submission that the protection afforded by the BIT
provision on fair and equitable treatment is entirely covered by a prohibition on
discrimination. Respondent does not allege that there is any principle of EU law that
specifically forbids treatment that is not fair and equitable. The Tribunal does not
consider that any such principle, independent of concepts of non-discrimination,
proportionality, legitimate expectation and of procedural fairness, is yet established in

EU law.

Treatment might be unfair and inequitable even if it is imposed on everyone

regardless of nationality or, indeed, of any other distinguishing characteristic.'°°

The Tribunal takes no position on the question whether such a plea should succeed.

A flat-rate corporation tax might be an example.'”° Respondent accepted that such a
measure might be prohibited by the BIT but permitted by EU law.'°” That possibility
precludes an a priori determination that every claim of a violation of the fair and
equitable treatment standard must fall within the scope of a prohibition on
discrimination. Similar hypothetical examples can readily be imagined that relate to

other principles of EU law.

It cannot, therefore, be assumed (as the first test in WCLT Article 59 requires) that
EU law is so comprehensive and legally certain as to have been impliedly intended to
govern this question. It cannot be assumed that the Parties intended that a right so
central to the purpose of the BIT would be displaced by the narrower and more

loosely defined rights accorded by EU law.

Respondent argues that this hypothetical situation, where an action that would violate
the BIT is permitted by EU law, is a clear example of incompatibility between the
BIT and EU law. Incompatibility is a matter to be considered under test (b) in VCLT
Article 59. Respondent said that incompatibility occurs when one act is permissible
under one law, but not permissible under the other. The Tribunal does not share that

view.

Article 59 is concerned with situations where “provisions of the later treaty are so far
incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of
being applied at the same time.” That could only arise in the hypothetical situation if
the Member State had either a legally-protected right under EU law or a legal duty
under EU law to impose the flat-rate tax. It would not arise where, because no law
forbade it, the State simply had the freedom to impose such a tax if it so chose. True,
the BIT obligation would prevent the State from enjoying its freedom under EU law
to impose a flat-rate tax: but all treaty obligations consist in the fettering of a State’s

freedom to act.

Accordingly, in the view of the Tribunal the fair and equitable treatment provision in

the BIT does not fall under either limb of the test set out in VCLT Article 59.

The Tribunal has focused on the scope of the protections afforded by the BIT and by

EU law, rather than on the question whether on the facts of this particular case the

claim based on the fair and equitable treatment provision could be raised under

EU law. There are several reasons for this focus.

As discussed further below, the question here is one of jurisdiction; and the extent to
which either the BIT or EU law covers the claim cannot be answered until the merits

of the case have been considered.

The Tribunal also considers that the question of overlap and incompatibility must,
under VCLT Article 59, relate to the same legal relationship. Thus, a treaty provision
guaranteeing non-discrimination does not have, even indirectly, the “same
subject-matter” as a treaty provision guaranteeing fair and equitable treatment, even if
on the facts of a particular case a claim might be raised under either provision and the
claimant might be able to recover compensation for the entire loss under either
provision. In this respect the notion of the same “subject-matter” has certain common
features with the notions of “identity” that operate in the context of the doctrine of

res judicata.

The Tribunal’s decision in relation to the fair and equitable treatment provision in the
BIT alone is sufficient to dismiss Respondent’s submission that all BIT claims are
covered by provisions of EU law. It is enough that one such claim made by the
Claimant does not necessarily lie within the scope of the protections afforded by
EU law to conclude that the BIT offers protections wider than those afforded by
EU law. The fair and equitable treatment claim, however, is not the only claim that is

not wholly covered by EU law.

In the view of the Tribunal the BIT right to “full protection and security” is not
exhausted by the rights flowing from the freedom of establishment under EU law.
The right to full protection and security subsists for as long as the investment remains
in place, no matter how long after it has been established and no matter whether or not
the treatment complained of is discriminatory. While the freedom of establishment
under EU law entails various ancillary rights, the Tribunal does not consider that
those rights cover the entire ground that the right to full protection and security might

be said to cover.!°*

Similarly, the protection in Article 5 of the BIT against expropriation is by no means
covered by the EU freedom of establishment. While it certainly overlaps with the
right to property secured by Article 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (and
the First Protocol to the ECHR, as applied under EU law), the BIT provision on
expropriation is not obviously co-extensive with it. Both the considerable body of
jurisprudence on indirect takings that has emerged in the context of BITs, and also the
fact that the BIT protects “assets” and “investments” rather than the arguably
narrower concepts of “possessions” and “property” protected by the EU Charter on
Fundamental Rights, give rise to the possibility of wider protection under the BIT

than is enjoyed under EU law.

Thus, EU law does not provide substantive rights for investors that extend as far as
those provided by the BIT. There are rights that may be asserted under the BIT that
are not secured by EU law. Consequently, it cannot be said that it is implicit in the
text of the EC Treaties that Respondent and the Netherlands intended that it should
supplant the BIT.

Nor can it be said that the provisions of the BIT are incompatible with EU law. The
rights to fair and equitable treatment, to full protection and security, and to protection
against expropriation at least, extend beyond the protections afforded by EU law; and
there is no reason why those rights should not be fulfilled and upheld in addition to

the rights protected by EU law.

The third main reason for rejecting the jurisdictional challenge based on VCLT
Article 59 may be stated simply. An essential characteristic of an investor’s rights
under the BIT is the right to initiate UNCITRAL arbitration proceedings against a
State party (as the host State) under Article 8 of the BIT. Such a consensual
arbitration under well-established arbitration rules adopted by the United Nations, in a
neutral place and with a neutral appointing authority, cannot be equated simply with
the legal right to bring legal proceedings before the national courts of the host state;
and, moreover, the Jocus standi of an investor under the BIT, with its broad definition
of “indirect” investments under Article 1, is unlikely to be replicated under the court

procedures of an EU Member State.

Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s submission that the BIT provisions
have been displaced by EU law as a result of the principle set out in Article 59 of the

Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties.

The consequence is that in any particular case investors protected by the BIT may
have wider rights than those given under the substantive provisions of EU law to
investors of (other) EU Member States. Affording such wider protection to those
investors while not affording it to investors of other EU States may violate EU law
prohibitions on discrimination. But that is not a reason for cancelling Claimant’s
wider rights under the BIT. More significantly, it is still less a reason for treating the
Parties’ consent to these arbitration proceedings as invalid or otherwise ineffective,
particularly where the first stage of such consent pre-dated the relevant EU Treaties,

the second stage pre-dated the Lisbon Treaty, and Claimant is an EU investor.

There is moreover no reason, legal or practical, why an EU Member State should not
accord to investors of all other EU Member States rights equivalent to those which the
State has bound itself to accord to investors of its EU bilateral investment treaty
partners — or, indeed, to investors from States that are not members of the EU.
Certainly, it is not for an arbitral tribunal to cancel rights created by a valid treaty in
order to safeguard a State party against the possibility that it might one day decide to
apply the treaty in a way that could violate its obligations under one or more other

later treaties.

B. Inapplicability of the BIT under VCLT Article 30

Respondent’s argument that the provisions of the BIT are inapplicable because of the

operation of the rules set out in VCLT Article 30 can be dealt with briefly.

VCLT Article 30 is concerned with situations of incompatibility between particular

provisions in successive treaties. In so far as it is relevant, it reads as follows:

Article 30. Application of successive treaties
relating to the same subject-matter

1. Subject to Article 103 of the Charter of the United Nations, the rights and
obligations of States parties to successive treaties relating to the same
subject-matter shall be determined in accordance with the following
paragraphs.

2. When a treaty specifies that it is subject to, or that it is not to be
considered as incompatible with, an earlier or later treaty, the provisions
of that other treaty prevail.

274.

3. When all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to the later treaty
but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended in operation under
article 59, the earlier treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are
compatible with those of the latter treaty.”

Article 30(1) refers to the provision of Article 103 of the UN Charter which gives
obligations arising under the Charter priority over other treaty obligations. It is not
relevant in this case. Article 30(2) deals with situations where there is an express
provision governing relations between successive treaties. There is no such provision

in this case. Article 30(3) is the material provision for the present case.

It has already been explained that in the view of the Tribunal there is no
incompatibility in circumstances where an obligation under the BIT can be fulfilled
by Respondent without violating EU law. That conclusion is not affected by the

principles of supremacy, direct effect or direct application of EU law.

More importantly, it is difficult to see how Article 30 could deprive the Tribunal of
jurisdiction based upon the Parties’ consent derived from Article 8 of the BIT
(whether operating the first stage, second stage or both), even if there may be
circumstances in which a true incompatibility between the BIT and EU law arises.
Any such incompatibility would be a question of the effect of EU law as part of the

applicable law and, as such, a matter for the merits and not jurisdiction.

The one exception would be if Article 8 of the BIT, which provides for arbitration
between the investor and the State, were by itself incompatible with EU law. It could
not be incompatible when the BIT was made; but it might be argued that it is
incompatible with the CSFR Association Agreement, the Association Agreement, the
Accession Treaty or the Lisbon Treaty. If that were so, that would, at least arguably,

deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction.

There is, however, no rule of EU law that prohibits investor-State arbitration. Far
from it: transnational arbitration is a commonplace throughout the EU, including
arbitrations between legal persons and States; and the European Court of Justice has
given several indications of how questions of EU law should be handled in the course
of arbitrations, including important questions of public policy.!”° It cannot be asserted
that all arbitrations that involve any question of EU law are conducted in violation of

EU law. The argument that the availability of arbitration for some but not all EU

investors would amount to discrimination in violation of EU law?” was addressed

above, where it was decided that the answer is to extend rights and not to cancel them.

The fact that there might be remedies available to the Claimant in national courts
through Francovich procedures does not alter the position. One of the central
purposes of arbitration is to provide the disputing parties, by their consent, with an
alternative to proceedings in national courts. Moreover, an arbitration clause in a BIT
is specifically included to address the substantive protections afforded to investors

under the BIT.

Reference was made to the ruling of the ECJ in the MOX Plant case, that by virtue of
Article 344 TFEU (ex Article 292 TEC) and the principle of loyalty the ECJ had
exclusive jurisdiction over disputes between two Member States. Whatever the
implications of that ruling might be for Article 10 of the BIT, which is concerned with
disputes between the BIT Contracting Parties, the ruling is not applicable to disputes
under Article 8, which are not disputes between Contracting Parties but investor-State
disputes. There is no suggestion here that every dispute that arises between a Member
State and an individual must be put before the ECJ; nor would the ECJ have the

jurisdiction (let alone the capacity) to decide all such cases.

The argument that Article 8 of the BIT is incompatible with EU law is therefore
unsustainable. Accordingly, the Tribunal dismisses Respondent’s submission that the
Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because the BIT provisions have been disapplied by
EU law as a result of the principle set out in Article 30 of the Vienna Convention on

the Law of Treaties.

C. Inapplicability of the BIT under EU Law

Respondent’s third line of argument is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction because, as
a matter of EU law, EU law has direct effect and prevails over both national law and
international treaties, and because only the European Court of Justice can interpret

EU law.

The Tribunal does not accept this argument. EU law may have a bearing upon the
scope of rights and obligations under the BIT in the present case, by virtue of its role

as part of the applicable law under BIT Article 8(6) and German law as the /ex loci

arbitri. But that is a question for the merits stage, not a question that goes to

jurisdiction.

The only basis — beyond the arguments already discussed in relation to VCLT Articles
30 and 59 — on which the Tribunal might arguably be deprived of jurisdiction on the
basis of the status of EU law is that the Tribunal needs to consider and apply EU law
in order to decide the present case and yet is entirely precluded from considering and
applying any such EU law by the Parties’ consent derived from Article 8 of the BIT or

German law.

Even assuming, for the sake of argument, that the questions that the Tribunal will
need to address might be identified accurately prior to the merits stage, and that they
include questions of EU law, that proposition is unsustainable. Indeed, the Tribunal
considers it the opposite of the truth. Far from being precluded from considering and
applying EU law the Tribunal is bound to apply it to the extent that it is part of the

applicable law(s), whether under BIT Article 8, German law or otherwise.

The argument that the ECJ has an “interpretative monopoly” and that the Tribunal
therefore cannot consider and apply EU law, is incorrect. The ECJ has no such
monopoly. Courts and arbitration tribunals throughout the EU interpret and apply EU
law daily. What the ECJ has is a monopoly on the final and authoritative
interpretation of EU law: but that is quite different. Moreover, even final courts are
not obliged to refer questions of the interpretation of EU law to the ECJ in all cases.

The acte clair doctrine is well-established in EU law.?”!

The fact that, at the merits stage, the Tribunal might have to consider and apply
provisions of EU law does not deprive the Tribunal of jurisdiction. The Tribunal can
consider and apply EU law, if required, both as a matter of international law and as a

matter of German law. This jurisdictional objection therefore is rejected.

D. Non-Arbitrability of the Dispute under German Law

Respondent’s argument, based upon the alleged non-arbitrability of the dispute under
German law, turns upon the proposition that the dispute is outside the jurisdiction of
the Tribunal by virtue of EU law and that German law as the lex loci arbitri must

therefore treat the dispute as non-arbitrable.

The Tribunal has found that EU law does not deprive it of jurisdiction; and
accordingly, as already indicated above, the jurisdictional objection based on German

law must also fail in limine.

E. Relationship between the Tribunal and EU Institutions

Submissions were made on the question of the proper relationship between this
Tribunal and EU institutions. The Tribunal understands that there is a relationship
between them and that, like all courts and tribunals in the EU, it must take proper

account of that relationship.
The Tribunal is bound by Article 8(6) of the BIT, which stipulates that:

The arbitral tribunal shall decide on the basis of the law, taking into account in
particular though not exclusively:

e the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned;

¢ the provisions of this Agreement, and other relevant Agreements
between the Contracting Parties;

¢ the provisions of special agreements relating to the investment;

¢ the general principles of international law.

The question of the content of EU law and its role in the present case is one for the

merits stage, as decided above.

Without prejudice to arguments that might be raised at that stage, the Tribunal
considers that in principle EU law appears to fall within the scope of the first two and
the last of these bullet points (“the law in force of the Contracting Party concerned”;
“other relevant Agreements between the Contracting Parties” and as part of “the
general principles of international law’). Accordingly, the Tribunal considers that in
principle the EU legal doctrines, including those of supremacy, precedence, direct
effect, direct applicability, are part of the body of EU law that might fall to be applied
by the Tribunal in this case under Article 8(6) of the BIT.

On the other hand, the Tribunal notes that its jurisdiction is confined to ruling upon
alleged breaches of the BIT. The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to rule on
alleged breaches of EU law as such. The manner and extent to which that clear and
fixed limitation on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal may impact upon the cases
presented by the Parties will become clear at the merits stage and will be addressed at

that stage.

The Tribunal’s findings, set out above, leave it in no doubt that it has jurisdiction in

this case and that it can and, by virtue of its mandate, should exercise it in this case.

The Tribunal has considered whether it would be appropriate to suspend these
arbitration proceedings until the EU Commission and/or the ECJ have come to a
decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement case. While the Tribunal wishes
to organise its proceedings with full regard for considerations of mutual respect and
comity as regards other courts and institutions, it does not consider that the questions
in issue in the infringement case are so far coextensive with the claims in the present
case that it is appropriate to suspend its proceedings now. Should it become evident
at a later stage that the relationship between the two sets of proceedings is so close as
to be a cause of procedural unfairness or serious inefficiency, the Tribunal will

reconsider the question of suspension.

DECISION
For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal:

(a) DISMISSES the “Intra-EU Jurisdictional Objection” advanced
by Respondent and decides that it has jurisdiction over the
dispute;

(b) REJECTS Respondent’s request to suspend the proceedings until
the European Commission and/or the ECJ have come to a

decision on the EU law aspects of the infringement proceedings;

(c) RESERVES all questions concerning the merits, costs, fees and
expenses, including the Parties’ costs of legal representation, for

subsequent determination; and

(d) INVITES the Parties to confer regarding the procedural calendar
for the merits phase of the arbitration, and to report to the

Tribunal in this respect within 14 days of receipt of this Award.
