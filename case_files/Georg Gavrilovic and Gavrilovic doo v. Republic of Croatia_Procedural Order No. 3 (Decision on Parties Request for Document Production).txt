By Procedural Order No. 2, the Tribunal ordered a procedure for each Party to serve on
the other Party a request for production of documents. In response, the recipient was to
provide the other Party with: (a) the documents in its possession, custody or control that
were responsive to the request; and/or (b) a statement in writing of its objections to
production, with reference to the objections listed in Article 9(2) of the International Bar
Association Rules on the Taking of Evidence in International Arbitration (the “IBA
Rules”). Finally, the requesting Party was ordered to comment in writing on any
response or objection made to production and file those submissions with the Tribunal,

with a copy provided to the other Party.

For convenience, hereafter in this Order:

(a) the “Requesting Party” is the party seeking production of documents; and

(b) the “Objecting Party” is the party who objects to production of the documents sought.

On 17 April 2015, the Tribunal received from each of the Parties their submissions in the
form of a Redfern Schedule. Those Schedules set out, in respect of each category of

documents sought, the following matters:

(a) the relevance and materiality of that category according to the Requesting Party;

(b) the responses or objections from the Objecting Party in respect of that category; and

(c) the reply of the Requesting Party.

The objections set out in Article 9(2) of the IBA Rules are, of course, central to the
resolution of the issues the subject of the Parties’ respective submissions. It is useful to

extract it in full here:

The Arbitral Tribunal shall, at the request of a Party or on its own motion, exclude
from evidence or production any Document, statement, oral testimony or
inspection for any of the following reasons:

Page 2 of 13

(a) lack of sufficient relevance to the case or materiality to its outcome;

(b) legal impediment or privilege under the legal or ethical rules determined by
the Arbitral Tribunal to be applicable;

(c) unreasonable burden to produce the requested evidence;

(d) loss or destruction of the Document that has been shown with reasonable
likelihood to have occurred;

(e) grounds of commercial or technical confidentiality that the Arbitral Tribunal
determines to be compelling;

(f) grounds of special political or institutional sensitivity (including evidence that
has been classified as secret by a government or a public international
institution) that the Arbitral Tribunal determines to be compelling; or

(g) considerations of procedural economy, proportionality, fairness or equality of
the Parties that the Arbitral Tribunal determines to compelling.

This Order is made pursuant to paragraph 5 of Procedural Order No. 2, by which the
Tribunal is required to determine the issues raised by the Parties’ submissions on

production.

Having carefully considered the submissions of the Parties, the Tribunal has determined.
the Claimants’ requests and Respondent's requests in, respectively, Annexures A and B to

this Order.

Where the Tribunal has ordered production, it has rejected all of the objections to
production the subject of Article 9(2) of the IBA Rules. Where, on the other hand,
production has not been ordered, it has upheld one or more of those objections. Further,
where the Objecting Party has made a positive assertion as part of its objection, such as,
for example: (i) it has already provided all documents answering the category; (ii) there
are no documents answering that category; or (iii) the relevant documents never existed,

that assertion is noted.

For the sake of clarity, the Tribunal notes that in ruling on document production requests,

the Tribunal has made certain preliminary determinations regarding the relevance of the

Page 3 of 13

categories of documents sought. These determinations are based on the information

provided, and are without prejudice to the Tribunal’s eventual assessment of the

definitive relevance and/or materiality of the underlying facts.

The key used in Annexures A and B is explained by reference to the general principles

(a) not located any documents responsive to this category
in its possession, custody or control;

(b) has produced the only documents responsive to this
category in its possession, custody or control; or

(c) any documents in its possession, custody or control
have already been submitted as part of the arbitration.

In those circumstances, noting the Objecting Party’s
response, the Tribunal considers it futile to order
production.

10. The Tribunal has noted the following request of the Respondent with respect to several

categories of documents:

[G]iven the risk of obstructive behaviour by the Claimants, the Respondent
respectfully requests the Tribunal to order that the Claimants provide a sworn
statement or affirmation declaring that a good faith and diligent search for
documents has been made and giving details of the steps taken and individuals
questioned in the course of the implied search.

The Tribunal sees no need to make the requested order. Each Party has an obligation to
arbitrate in good faith, and the Tribunal trusts this obligation will be fulfilled in regard to

the production of documents.

11. In accordance with Procedural Order No. 2, the Parties shall produce all documents

ordered for production within three weeks of the date of this Order.

12. In addition, any further applications for disclosure emanating from the rulings the subject

of Annexures A and B are to be filed within three weeks of this Order.

For and on behalf of the Tribunal,
