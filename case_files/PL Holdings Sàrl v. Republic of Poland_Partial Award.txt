IV. SUMMARY OF THE CLAIM AND DEFENSE

 

10.

11.

It is Claimant’s contention in this proceeding that Poland has expropriated Claimant’s
qualifying investment in Poland and done so without compensation,” in violation of
the Bilateral Investment Treaty (“BIT”) between Poland and the Government of the
Kingdom of Belgium and the Government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg (“the
Treaty”),2 whose stated purpose is “the [e]ncouragement and the [r]Jeciprocal
[p]rotection of [iJnvestments.”

The relevant chronology, as presented by Claimant in these proceedings is as follows.
On 1 December 2010, Claimant became the owner of 55% of the shares in a Polish
bank known at the time as WestLB Bank Polska Spélka Akcyjna (“WestLB Bank
Polska”) and subsequently renamed as Polski Bank Przedsiebiorzcosci Spélka Akcyjna
(“PBP Bank”). On 18 July 2012, PL Holdings purchased the other 45% share in PBP
Bank from a Polish corporation, Dom Maklerski IDM Spélka Akcyjna (“IDM”), so that
Claimant became the sole shareholder of PBP Bank.

In June 2013, Claimant also acquired an interest in a second Polish bank, FM Bank
Spélka Akcyjna (“FM Bank”).

On 1 July 2013, FM Bank and PBP Bank were merged into a new entity known as FM
Bank PBP Spélka Akcyjna (“FM Bank PBP”), with Claimant becoming the 99.59%
shareholder of FM Bank PBP. (The remaining 0.41% interest in FM Bank PBP is owned
by a third party individual, Piotr Stepniak). Claimant contends that this merger took

place at the insistence of the KNF. Claimant further asserts that Poland knew that

2 Statement of Claim, para. 1.
2 Statement of Claim, paras. 4-5.

Claimant had the intention of exiting its investments by way of an i

 

offering (“IPO”).*

12. Shortly following the merger, the KNF took a series of measures that are the subject of

 

this proceeding. These measures consisted of an order to PL Holdings prohibiting its

exercise of voting rights in connection with its shareholding in FM Bank PBP and an
order to PL Holdings compelling it to sell its shares in the FM Bank PBP.>

13. Claimant maintains that it had no choice but to comply with the measures, as they
were compulsory and immediately enforceable under Polish law. According to
Claimant, these measures amount to an expropriation, defined in Article 4 of the
Treaty as “measures of direct or indirect dispossession.”®

14, On 30 April 2015, Claimant and Mr. Stepniak sold all of their respective shareholdings
in FM Bank PBP to Porto Group Holdings Limited, an affiliate of AnaCap Financial
Partners III LP (“AnaCap”).

15. More specifically, Claimant alleges in this proceeding that:”

e the measures taken against it lacked any factual or legal basis under Polish law

e the measures did not genuinely pursue any legitimate aim or public purpose

e the measures were manifestly disproportionate

e Claimant had violated no provision of Polish law

e Respondent never raised any concerns about Claimant’s alleged failure to meet
certain financial commitments made in June 2010 before imposing the
measures

e Respondent denied Claimant an effective administrative or judicial remedy for
purposes of challenging these measures prior to the forced sale deadline of 30
April 2015.

Claimant contends that the Treaty requires full reparation for Respondent’s violation,

 

entailing pay of full y i and r i of the
situation that would most likely have prevailed if Respondent’s breach of the Treaty
had not occurred.®

Claimant’s Expert, Paul Rathbone of CEG, calculated the value that Claimant would
have received from its investment, had the compulsory sale not been ordered and had
Claimant been allowed to pursue its growth strategy and then mount an IPO in the
Warsaw Stock Exchange, thus arriving at a loss initially valued at 1,888,413,217 Polish
Zlotys (“PLN”).

In support of its claim, Claimant adduced witness statements by the following

persons:
e Mr. Pawel Boksa ( “Boksa ws”)
e Mr. Pawel Gieryriski ( “Gieryriski ws”)
e Mr. Slawomir Lachowski (“Lachowski ws”)
e Mr. Piotr Stepniak ( (“Stepniak ws”)

Claimant d expert opini by the jing persons:

e Dr. Stanislaw Kluza (“Kluza op.”)?
e Prof. Dr. Kern Alexander (“Alexander op.”)
e Dr. Paul Rathbone of CEG (“Rathbone op. or “CEG op.”)

Respondent denies having expropriated Claimant’s property or having otherwise

violated its obligations under the Treaty. It maintains that the actions challenged here

were all legitimate exercises of its right to regulate in the public interest fully
consistent with the principle of proportionality and not otherwise arbitrary,
unreasonable or discriminatory.

rights in connection with the actions taken.

alleged breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty

e an order requiring Claimant to pay all the costs of the arbitration, including all

the Respondent, with post-award interest on the amount that the Tribunal
awards to the Claimant as costs

e anorder of such other relief as the Tribunal deems appropriate

PROCEDURAL HISTORY OF THE CASE

On 26 November 2014, Claimant filed a request for arbitration with the Arbitration
Institute of the SCC, as supplemented on 27 November 2014. In that request, it
nominated Professor Julian D. M. Lew as arbitrator.

On 2 December 2014, the SCC notified the Republic of Poland of the filing and invited
it to submit an answer by 30 December 2014. On 30 December 2014, Respondent
denied any and all allegations, claims and relief sought by Claimant and requested an
extension of time to answer the request for arbitration. Upon being invited by the
SCC on 2 January 2005 to comment on the request, Claimant urged on 3 January 2015
that the request be denied. However, on 5 January 2015, the SCC granted Respondent

an extension of time until 19 January 2015 to file an answer and appoint an arbitrator.

28.

29.

30.

31.

32.

On 16 January 2015, Respondent wrote to the SCC, nominating as arbitrator Michael
E. Schneider, stating its preference for Stockholm, Sweden or Prague, Czech Republic
as arbitral seats, and taking the position that the arbitral proceedings should be
governed by the 2010 SCC Arbitration Rules. On 26 January 2015, Claimant insisted
that the proceedings were properly governed by the SCC Rules adopted and in force as
of 1 January 1988.

On 12 February 2015, the SCC stated its intention to appoint as chair of the tribunal in
this case Professor George A. Bermann of Columbia Law School in New York, New York
USA, and inquired as to his ability to serve in that capacity. Professor Bermann
replied, indicating his ability and willingness to serve.

On 13 February 2015, the SCC informed the Parties of the following determinations:
that the SCC did not manifestly lack jurisdiction over the dispute, that the seat of
arbitration was Stockholm, Sweden, and that the advance on costs was fixed at
€426,000, to be paid by the Parties in equal shares.

On 16 February 2015, the SCC confirmed that Professor Bermann had been appointed
as chair in the case. On the same day, Professor Bermann confirmed his acceptance
and affirmed his impartiality and independence. On the following day, the SCC
reported Professor Bermann’s appointment to the Parties.

On 6 March 2015, the advance on costs having been paid, the SCC referred the case to
the Tribunal. On 12 March 2015, Professor Bermann wrote to the SCC for clarification
of various matters. The SCC responded to Professor Bermann’s inquiry the same day.

Still on the same day, Professor Bermann wrote to the Parties’ counsel to (a) urge as

33.

34,

much cooperation and collaboration in general between them as possible, (b) request
that Counsel endeavor to agree on a procedural timetable for the case, and (c) request
Counsel to communicate in no more than two pages their position on the applicable
SCC Rules. On 24 March 2015, Counsel reported to the Tribunal that they had agreed
that the 2010 SCC Rules would be applicable.

On 2 April 2015, Counsel reported agreement on all procedural matters but one, viz.
the timing of production of documents. On 13 April 2015, Counsel related to the
Tribunal further procedural matters as to which they had reached agreement and
posed certain questions, to which the Chair of the Tribunal replied the following day.
The Tribunal eventually issued Procedural Order no. 1 on 6 May 2015, setting out a
basic but detailed procedural framework and calendar of stages in the arbitration,

consistent with the agreement between the Parties.

 

On 3 August 2015, Claimant reported to the Tribunal that it could not meet the initial
deadline for submitting its Statement of Claim due to the fact that doing so depended
on the availability of the testimony of a key witness who at the last moment declined
to testify due to fear of repercussions at the hands of the Respondent. On 4 August
2015, the Tribunal, without making any finding on that charge, granted Claimant an
extension for filing its Statement of Claim until 7 August 2015. On that day,
Respondent rejected any suggestion of witness intimidation on its part and requested

an extension of the deadline for its Answer to the Claim equal in length to the

extension granted to Claimant. The Tribunal granted that request. On that same day

35.

36.

37.

as well, Claimant submitted its Statement of Claim, accompanied by four witness
statements and three expert opinions.
On 11 August 2015, the SCC extended until 23 January 2017 the time for rendering the
final award in this case.
On 13 August 2015, Claimant requested that Respondent provide assurance that
Respondent, including the KNF, had done and would do nothing, directly or indirectly,
to interfere with the ability of Claimant’s fact and expert witnesses to testify freely in
the proceedings without fear of adverse consequences or otherwise to interfere with
Claimant’s ability freely to present its case. On 7 September 2015, Claimant reported
that it had still not received from Respondent the assurance requested. On 9
September 2015, Respondent declined to give the requested assurance in the absence
of any evidence by Claimant of actual witness intimidation. On the same day, the
Tribunal stated that Respondent could not be expected to make an affirmation of the
sort requested by Claimant in the absence of any substantiation of the charge of
intimidation. The Tribunal stated:
Rather, the Tribunal considers that, under the present circumstances, the
shared interest of all in the complete integrity of this proceeding can be
satisfied by reminding counsel that the Tribunal operates on the firm
assumption that the parties and their counsel would not and will not engage,
directly or indirectly, in witness intimidation. The Tribunal further considers
the parties and counsel to have made an implied commitment to that very
effect. Should any such intimidation nevertheless be shown to have occurred,
the Tribunal will draw appropriate inferences.

On 14 September 2015, Claimant’s Expert, Mr. Paul Rathbone, provided certain Polish-

language originals and English-language translations that had been missing from his

Report on the Valuation of PL Holdings’ Investment in FM Bank PBP, dated 31 July
2015.

On 17 September 2015, the procedural schedule was amended to reflect one-week
extensions to both Parties for their filing of, respectively, their Statement of Claim and
Answer thereto.

On 13 November 2015, Respondent submitted its Statement of Defence, accompanied
by three witness statements and three expert opinions.

On 27 November 2015, each Party submitted to the other its request for document
production. On 18 December 2015, each Party filed objections to certain of the
other’s production requests. On 28 December 2015, the Parties replied to the
respective stated objections.

On 13 January 2016, Respondent provided certain corrections to appendixes to the
Respondent's Statement of Defence.

On 22 January 2016, the Tribunal, which was in receipt of both Parties’ Redfern
Schedules, issued Procedural Order no. 2, ruling on both Parties’ requests for and
objections to production. On 29 January 2016, Claimant complained of Respondent’s
failure to produce certain documents as ordered by the Tribunal, while also
reformulating, at the Tribunal’s suggestion, one of its own production requests. On 1
February 2016, Respondent requested additional time to respond to Procedural Order
no. 2. On the same date, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 3, dealing with

Claimant’s complaints over delays in document production by Respondent.

43.

44,

45.

46.

For a period starting 5 February 2016, Counsel discussed Respondent’s assertion of
confidentiality with regard to the production of certain documents and exchanged
drafts of a Confidentiality Order. By Procedural Order no. 4, dated 16 February 2016,
the Tribunal gave instructions to Counsel with regard to claims of confidentiality and
the functioning of an eventual confidentiality regime. There followed Procedural
Order no. 5, dated 20 February 2016, in which the Tribunal laid down further
particulars about the confidentiality regime. Counsel ultimately agreed upon a
Confidentiality Order that the Tribunal was able to issue on 22 February 2016.

On 15 February 2016, Respondent reformulated two of its discovery requests that the
Tribunal had rejected as originally formulated. The Parties discussed the reformulated
requests between 15 and 18 February 2016, and through Procedural Order no. 6 of 22
February 2016, the Tribunal again rejected the requests as reformulated.

On 23 February, 2015, Respondent made further production of documents pursuant to
the Tribunal’s orders. There ensued discussions between 23 and 24 February 2016
over the completeness of Respondent’s production.

On 26 February 2016, Claimant submitted its Statement of Reply, accompanied by

second witness statements of Mr. Boksa. Mr. Gierynski, Mr. Lachowski, Mr.

 

Pawlowski, and Mr. Stepniak; second expert opinions of Dr. Rathbone and Dr.
Alexander; and a first joint witness statement of Experts Professors Zoll and Oplustil
and Dr. Spyra. In submitting its Statement of Reply, Claimant also requested

permission to supplement that Statement by way of an annex, basing that request on

the asserted lateness of document production by Respondent. Over Respondent’s

47.

48.

49.

50.

objection, the Tribunal granted the request. Claimant filed its supplement on 4 March
2016.

On 22 March 2016, Respondent requested an extension of time until 13 July 2016 for
filing its Rejoinder, a request to which Claimant objected on 24 March 2016. On 28
March 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 7, indicating the Tribunal’s
proposed approach to adjustment of the hearing schedule and requesting Counsel to
meet and confer on a mutually agreeable solution. Following further discussion, the
Parties reached agreement on an extended deadline of 27 May 2016 for Respondent’s
filing of its Rejoinder, which the Tribunal accepted and confirmed by Procedural Order
no. 8 dated 4 April 2016.

On 15 April 2016, Counsel informed the Tribunal that they had agreed to hold hearings
in London, England, even though the seat of arbitration remained Stockholm, Sweden,
and conveyed other logistical information upon which the Parties had agreed. The
Tribunal indicated on 17 April 2016 that it had no objection to the hearings being held
in London, England rather than Stockholm, Sweden.

On 4 May 2016, the Tribunal requested an update from Counsel on the hearing
schedule, receiving an update the following day. In correspondence exchanged
between 10 and 17 May 2016, Counsel discussed certain hearing arrangements.

On 21 May 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 9, confirming hearing days,
hearing costs, and other hearing arrangements. On 29 May 2016, the Tribunal
rendered a Reissued Procedural Order no. 7, to reconfirm certain previously settled

procedural determinations.

On 29 May 2016, the Tribunal reissued Procedural Order no. 9, replacing the original
Procedural Order no. 9, reflecting two minor changes proposed by Counsel. On the
same day, the Chair of the Tribunal requested Counsel’s consent for the Chair of the
Tribunal alone to participate in the pre-hearing conference with Counsel. Both parties
agreed.

On 6 June 2016, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal complaining about a new jurisdictional
objection advanced in Respondent’s Rejoinder of 27 May 2016. By that jurisdictional
objection, Respondent argued that the Treaty itself was no longer in effect since it was
superseded by Poland’s accession to the European Union (“EU”) or was otherwise
inapplicable on account of EU law, invoking Articles 30 and 59 of the Vienna
Convention on the Law of Treaties (“VCLT”) and Article 344 of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union (“TFEU”). Respondent further argued that EU law
offers investors from other EU Member States, such as Luxembourg, adequate
investor protection and that interpretation of EU law is entrusted exclusively to the
courts of the EU. Claimant asked the Tribunal to rule the objection inadmissible as

interposed too late in the proceedings. Respondent replied on 9 June 2016, arguing

20

54,

55.

that the objection was not entirely new, but even if new, was one for which it should
be entitled, in light of the importance of the question, to amend its pleadings. There
followed further communications on the matter from Claimant and Respondent on 13
June and 16 June 2016, respectively.

The Chair of the Tribunal wrote to Counsel on 12 June 2016, establishing an agenda for
the pre-hearing conference call scheduled for 21 June 2016 at which all procedural

aspects of the hearing would be confirmed or addressed, as the case may be, including

Claimant’s to it’s new jurisdicti bjecti On 17 June 2016,
Counsel gave the Tribunal a progress report on agreement over procedural matters
surrounding the hearing. On the same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no.
10, establishing rules governing court reporting services, interpretation services and
printing costs. On 19 June 2016, Respondent reported to the Tribunal further
procedural matters on which Counsel had managed to reach agreement, as well as
procedural matters on which differences of view remained. On 21 June 2016, Counsel
on both sides indicated the names of the individuals who would be attending the pre-
hearing conference.

There took place on 21 June 2016 a telephone pre-hearing conference among Counsel
and the Chair of the Tribunal on behalf of the full Tribunal. Following the conference
call and a discussion among the members of the Tribunal, the Chair reported the

Tribunal’s grant of Respondent's request that fact witnesses not remain present in the

hearing room following their testimony and expressed the Tribunal’s desire to receive

21

56.

57.

post-hearing briefs, for which deadlines, page limits and other particular would be
communicated at a later time.

On 22 and 23 June 2016, Counsel itemized the procedural matters on which Counsel
had not yet reached agreement. On 23 June 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural
Order no. 11, confirming matters of procedure subsequently agreed upon by the
Parties and indicating that it would postpone until after the hearings a ruling upon
Claimant’s objection to Respondent’s having filed new jurisdictional defenses on 2
May 2016.

On 24 June 2016, Respondent furnished to opposing Counsel and the Tribunal copies
of documents that corrected mis-translations and replaced illegible versions. Between
24 and 30 June 2016, further disagreements arose between Counsel over the number

of copies of certain documents to be produced to the other Party, over the adequacy

 

of the copies of certain exhibits, and over a request for Counsel to identify in advance

 

matters on which witnesses would be examined on direct. On 26 June 2016, the
Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 12, both confirming additional procedural
matters on which the Parties had reached agreement and ruling on pending
procedural matters on which the Parties had failed to reach agreement. Remaining
items were resolved by the Tribunal informally by email to Counsel on 30 June and 1
July 2016. On 1 July 2016, Counsel supplied the Tribunal with a revised schedule of
witnesses for the hearing. On the same day, Claimant, with Respondent’s agreement
subject to a reservation of rights, offered into evidence nineteen new Exhibits and an

additional excerpt.

On 30 June 2016, at the Tribunal’s request, Claimant indicated the matters upon which
it intended to examine Profs. Zoll and Oplustil and Dr. Spyra.

On 1 July 2016, the Chair of the Tribunal made certain requests to Counsel regarding
the presence and availability of documents in the hearing room. On the same date,
Counsel provided the Tribunal with exact time allocations for each of the witnesses at
the hearing.

On 4 July 2016, Claimant advised the Tribunal of ongoing discussions between Counsel
regarding arrangements whereby witness Dr. Kluza, who feared a conflict of interest,
given his new position at another bank also dealing with the KNF, could nevertheless
testify. A number of communications on the matter were exchanged over the
following few days.

On 5 July 2016, Respondent objected to Claimant’s introduction into the record of
certain new exhibits, at which point Respondent sought to withdraw the consent it
had previously given to the admission into evidence of other exhibits.

On 6 July 2016, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 13, determining the
modalities of examination and cross-examination of Dr. Kluza and the admissibility of
new documents into the record. There followed, on 7 July 2016, Procedural Order no.
14, specifying the proper matters for examination at the hearing of legal experts
Professors Zoll and Oplustil and Dr. Spyra. Following that Order, Claimant provided
additional information on matters to be covered in the direct examination of those

Experts. On 9 July 2016. Claimant reported that witness Dr. Kluza would attend the

23

63.

64,

hearing. On 10 July 2016, Respondent communicated the Confidentiality Undertakings
signed by all court reporters present at the hearing as well as by both interpreters.

Hearings in the case were held on 11 to 15 and 17 to 20 July 2016 at the International
Dispute Resolution Centre in London. On 17 July 2016, Claimant introduced into the
record two new exhibits. On the same day, Respondent reported that it was in the
process of seeking to locate the minutes of the KNF meeting of 8 April 2014, as
requested by the Tribunal. On the same day, the Tribunal requested minutes of the
July 2015 KNEF meeting at which the Second KNEF Decision was taken. On the next

day, Respondent indicated that it was in the process of looking for them. On the same

 

day, Claimant offered into evidence a further new exhibit. On 19 July 2016,
Respondent delivered Respondent's Experts’ Confidentiality Undertakings, as well as

certain additional legal exhibits. It too delivered a new exhibit. On 20 July 2016,

Respondent identified certain documents as the quarterly reports reflecting execution

 

of the recovery plan from 2014 until the last quarter of 2015, as well as an exhi

 

it,
dated 15 October 2014, consisting of a communication from KNF relating to the sale
process in the autumn of 2014. On the same day, Claimant and Respondent produced
as new exhibits, respectively, charts referred to by the Polish law Experts during their
expert witness conference.

Prior to the close of hearings on 20 July 2016, the Tribunal delivered to Counsel a

description of the further quantum reports it was asking the Experts to produce.

On 25 July, 2016, Claimant submitted additional legal authorities. Claimant also wrote
on 25 July 2016, requesting indications from the Tribunal as to the matters, if any, the
Tribunal specifically wished the Parties to address in their post-hearing briefs.

On that same day, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order no. 15, as amended by a
message from the Chair of the Tribunal the following day, asking Counsel to furnish a
joint list of documents that the Tribunal had requested during the hearings and the
status of those requests. In Procedural Order no. 15, the Tribunal also provided
guidelines (in the form of Annex A to the Order) for the Experts’ preparation of
quantum reports that the Tribunal had requested on 20 July 2016, for post-hearing
briefs on the merits, and for post-hearing briefs on the admissibility and merits of
Respondent’s new jurisdictional objection. The Tribunal invited the Experts to meet
and confer prior to producing their quantum reports. In Annex B to the Order, the
Tribunal posed questions the Tribunal wished Counsel to address in post-hearing
briefs.

On 27 July 2016, Respondent’s Expert, Mr. Caldwell requested clarification concerning
the quantum report that the Tribunal had requested in Procedural Order no. 15. Ina
communication of the same day, Claimant objected to Respondent’s unilateral
request for clarification. On 28 July 2016, Claimant set out the answers that had been
provided by Mr. Rathbone to questions and requests of Mr. Caldwell.

On 2 August 2016, Mr. Caldwell submitted a response to Mr. Rathbone’s

Supplementary Expert Report. On 12 September, the Experts provided the Tribunal a

25

joint response to the first item in the directions given to the Experts in preparing the
quantum reports.

On 15 September 2016, Respondent submitted its post-hearing submission on its
additional jurisdictional objection, as requested by the Tribunal in Procedural Order
no. 15.

On 21 September 2016, Claimant registered with the Tribunal numerous complaints
over Respondent’s alleged failure of compliance with the Tribunal’s various requests

for post-hearing pr of d and d replied on 25 September
2016, rejecting Claimant’s complaints as unfounded. Respondent also asked the
Tribunal to issue an order requiring the Parties to produce, within the shortest time
possible, any documents not in the file, but relevant to the case. Claimant objected to
the request as an improper attempt to bring in belatedly new documents and
arguments.

By Procedural Order no. 16, dated 27 September 2016, the Tribunal dealt with
requests for and objections to the production of certain documents at the post-
hearing stage. d up with LI i the ing day. Claimant
in turn made production in accordance with the requirements set out in Procedural
Order no. 16.

On 7 October 2016, Mr. Caldwell submitted the quantum report previously requested
by the Tribunal. Mr. Rathbone submitted his quantum report on 8 October 2016,

accompanied by an Excel spreadsheet jointly agreed to by the Experts.

The Parties filed simultaneous post-hearing briefs on 14 October 2016.

On 15 October 2016, Claimant submitted its post-hearing submission on Respondent’s
additional jurisdictional objection, as requested by the Tribunal in Procedural Order
no. 15.

On 22 October 2016, Claimant wrote to the Tribunal seeking instructions on costs
submissions and requesting closure of the proceeding.

On 25 October 2016, in connection with Claimant’s request for closure of the
proceeding, Respondent, among other things, informed the Tribunal and opposing
counsel that on 21 October 2016 (one week after the post-hearing briefs were
submitted), the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw had issued a ruling
dismissing the Claimant’s and Abris’ challenge to the Second KNF Decision.

Respondent asked that the ruling be admitted in evidence in the case. On 31 October

 

2016, Claimant d jission into evid of the tt Administrative Court
judgment and renewed its request that the proceedings be closed.

On 9 November 2016, the Chair of the Tribunal wrote to Counsel, allowing
Respondent to file the Regional Administrative Court judgment, with an English
translation, doing so by no later than 18 November 2016, with any comments it
wished to make, but in any event identifying the specific relevance and materiality of
the judgment respecting issues in this arbitration. Claimant was given until 28
November 2016 to make any comments it wished to make with respect to the

judgment and in response to the comments made by Respondent. The Tribunal

 

indicated that it would determine the admissibility of the judgment in the course of its

continuing deliberations. In the letter, the Tribunal ordered the proceedings closed,

subject to acceptance of the communications of 18 and 28 November 2016, referred
to above. Third, the Tribunal set 10 December 2016 as the deadline for submission of
the Parties’ statement of costs, with comments, if any, on the other Party’s
submission due by 20 December 2016. Lastly, the Tribunal stated that the deadline for
issuance of the Award would be 15 April 2017.

On 16 November 2016, the Parties jointly submitted to the Tribunal, at the Tribunal’s
request, a chart setting out the provisions of Polish law relevant to the case. On the
same day, the Tribunal advised Counsel that it would defer decision on the
admissibility and merits of Respondent’s new jurisdictional defense until rendition of
the Award.

On 29 November 2016, Respondent provided the Tribunal and opposing counsel with
an English-language translation of the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court’s
judgment of 21 October 2016. On 23 December 2016, Claimant objected to reopening
of the record to introduce the translation of the Regional Administrative Court’s
judgment, adding that, should the Tribunal decide to admit the judgment into
evidence, it should also admit the Claimant’s 20 December 2016 appeal of the
judgment.

At the request of the Tribunal dated 9 November 2016, Claimant and Respondent both
filed a Statement of Costs on 9 December 2016 and replies to the other side’s

Statement of Costs on 20 December 2016.

THE REGULATORY LANDSCAPE

28

81.

82.

83.

A. The KNF and its Regulatory Context

(i) The Powers of the KNF
THE KNF, established pursuant to the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments
(“Financial Trading Act”),° consists of seven persons, three of whom (a chair and two
vice-chairs) are appointed by the Polish Prime Minister, one of whom is appointed by
the Polish President, one of whom is an officer of the National Bank of Poland, and
two of whom are cabinet ministers. The KNF in turn is supervised by the Polish Prime
Minister who receives annual reports of the KNF and may dismiss the KNF chair and,
at the request of the KNF chair, the KNF vice-chairs.
Prior to 2008, when the Financial Trading Act came into effect, banking supervision in
Poland was exercised by the General Inspectorate of Banking situated within the
National Bank of Poland. In 2000 and 2007, the Inspectorate was managed by Mr.
Wojciech Kwa$sniak, the General Inspector of Banking Supervision.
The Polish Banking Act of 29 August 1997 (“the Banking Act”)** confers on the KNF
responsibility for ensuring the safety of funds held in Polish bank accounts. To that
end, the KNF monitors compliance by Polish banks with the Banking Act, as well as
with Article 70, paragraph 2, of the Financial Trading Act.‘2 The KNF thus assesses,
among other things, banks’ financial standing (including the adequacy of their

capitalization) and management systems.

The

king Law the KNF’s functions as 213

assessing the financial situation of banks, including analysis of their solvency,
asset quality, payment liq 'y and financial results

examining the quality of bank management systems, in particular risk
management and internal control systems

examining the compliance of credit, cash loans, letters of credit, bank
guarantees and sureties and bank securities with the applicable regulations
testing security and timely repayment of credit and cash loans

examining whether the limits referred to in Article 71 of the Banking Law are
respected, and evaluating processes for identifying, monitoring and controlling
exposure concentration, including large exposures

examining compliance of the operations of the banks with the KNF’s standards
regarding acceptable risk in banking operations, risk management, including
the adaptation of the bank’s processes of identifying, monitoring and reporting
risks to the type and scale of the bank’s operations

assessing the estimation, maintenance and review of the internal capital of
banks.

 

The KNF has authority to adopt resolutions and to issue administrative decisions and

orders. The KNF’s administrative decisions and orders take the form of:

permits for the establishment and entry into operations of banks

decisions approving the appointment of the members of a bank’s management
board

recommendations reflecting best practices

orders to banks to take certain remedial measures in response to violations of
banking regulations

sanctions, ranging from cash penalties, to suspension of management board
members, restrictions on a bank’s business, and revocation of a banking
license, to appointment of a receiver in bankruptcy.**

The role of the KNF as described above is influenced by developments in the banking

regulation and supervision system within the European Union. EU law — in the form of

3 Polish Banking Act, art. 133, para. 2 (CLA-5).

4 Polish Banking Act, arts. 11, para. 2, 25n, 138, 141, 143-146 (CLA-5). According to witness Stanislaw Kluza, the
KNF typically imposes penalties on a bank’s management board, but may, in exceptional circumstances, impose
them ona bank’s shareholders. Kluza op., paras. 11, 42.

directives and regulations’ — requires Member States to establish a “competent
authority” to supervise the functioning of credit institutions, including banks. In
Poland, that authority is the KNF. As such, the KNF is instructed to follow the
guidelines and recommendations issued by the European Banking Authority,
established at the EU level. Pursuant to that authority, the KNF is responsible for
ensuring the stability of the financial system, by which is meant a condition in which
the financial system —- intermediaries, markets and market infrastructures — can
withstand shocks without major disruption in financial intermediation or in the
effective allocation of savings to productive investment.*¢

As stated in the expert opinion of Mr. Zapadka:

For European countries, including Poland, these concepts are of particular
importance in the context of turmoil in the global and European financial
markets caused by the subprime crisis in 2008. Since then, both in Polish law
and EU law special attention to issues regarding ensuring the systemic safety
for the functioning of all financial market participants, attention to
strengthening the role of prudential supervision over the financial market,
attention to safety of collected clients’ funds, attention to reducing
information asymmetry in relation between the financial institution and
customers, and finally attention to the transparency of activities of financial
institutions, risk management, high standards of internal audit and the
compliance function.’”

Article 12, paragraph 1, of the Banking Act provides that a bank may be established in
Poland as (a) a State-owned bank, (b) a cooperative bank, or (c) a joint-stock
company. There was, as of 31 March 2015, only one State-owned bank, Bank
Gospodarstwa Krajowego (“BGK”), but there were 563 cooperative banks, 38
commercial banks, and 28 branches of foreign credit institutions.1®

According to Claimant, the Polish banking sector has grown steadily over the last
decade. In 2014, the net income of the Polish banking sector was the largest in

history, standing at PLN 16.2 billion, and it has grown further since.’?

HISTORY OF THE INVESTMENT AND THE DISPUTE

In this Section, The Tribunal relates the basic history of the present dispute.

. Establishment of FM Bank and PBP Bank

On 26 March 2008, Abris Fund | established an entity called Abris Holdings 1 S.a.r.l.,
later renamed FM Holdings,”° for the purpose of establishing a new bank in the form
of a joint-stock company.”_ Under the Banking Act, in order to establish a new bank,
there must be three founders.”? In this case, those three were (a) FM Holdings, (b)

the International Finance Corporation (“IFC”) (a member of the World Bank Group

promoting the private sector in developing countries), and (c) Mr. Piotr Stepniak, an
experienced businessman in the Polish banking sector.

The founders accordingly applied to the KNF on 12 August 2008 for a banking
license.?3 Almost one year later, on 31 July 2009, the KNF approved the application to
establish the new bank, FM Bank,?* which occurred on 6 August 2009. The
shareholdings in FM Bank stood at that time as FM Holdings, 89%; the IFC, 10%; and
Mr. Stepniak 1%. On 19 October 2009, FM Bank was registered in the Register of
Businesses of the National Court Register.2>

On 22 October 2009, FM Bank applied to the KNF for a permit to begin operations.?°
The permit was granted and FM Bank began operations on 23 February 2010. 2”

In the same general period, Mr. Pawel Gierynski, representing PL Holdings, became
interested in acquisition of WestLB Bank Polska (“WestLB”), a relatively small bank
in cial and ii 28 He was introduced to
that possibility by WestLB’s CEO and Management Board President, Mr. Maciej
Stanczuk. While negotiating with WestLB, Mr. Gierynski, on 28 December 2009, met
with KNF officials to discuss Abris’ interest in acquiring WestLB, either through 100%
ownership or through ownership shared with IDM, a Polish brokerage house and asset

manager experienced in IPOs, on the understanding that Abris would retain majority

ownership. According to Respondent, the KNF reminded Mr. Gierynski of the process

for obtaining the KNF’s permission to exercise voting rights attached to the shares ina
Polish bank.?9
Mr. Gierynski eventually joined with IDM to make that purchase. On 12 March 2010,
WestLB Bank Polska’s German parent corporation entered into a sale and purchase
agreement with IDM and PL Holdings.2° According to the KNF, it learned about this
transaction only through the press and expressed to Claimant its concern that the
transaction had not been brought to it attention beforehand.3+
In connection with their application to exercise voting rights in WestLB Bank Polska,?2
Claimant and Abris CEE (as parent company) were required to present their
investment strategy, as well make certain commitments. On June 15, 2010, in
response to requests from the KNF expressed at meetings? and in writing,?* Claimant
submitted a “List of the Shareholders’ Commitments,” addressing five matters?>:

e shape of the Bank’s corporate bodies

97. This list was the subject of discussion at a meeting at the KNF on 15 June 2010 and in
other exchanges, as a result of which the KNF requested revision of some wording of
the commitments.*°

98. The Parties disagree over which of them insisted on the idea of keeping the two banks
separate. According to Claimant, the KNF requested a commitment by Claimant not to
integrate PBP Bank and FM Bank,?” while the KNF insists that having the banks
operate independently was Mr. Gieryriski’s own preference.?®

99. In response to KNF’s request for a reworded List of Commitments,?? Claimant
presented a revised list to the KNF on 21 June 2010.”° The revised list sought to satisfy
KNF’s demands, while adding a commitment to float PBP Bank’s shares on the
Warsaw Stock Exchange within two to three years of their acquisition and a
commitment by PBP to take no action that would cause it to compete with FM Bank.

100. On 27 October 2010,*: the KNF issued a decision permitting Claimant to exercise its
voting rights in WestLB Bank Polska on the basis of the commitments specified in

Claimant’s 21 June 2010 letter. Witnesses Gieryriski and Boksa testified that that they

reassured the KNF that they had no intention to merge the two banks, and no interest
n doing so.*? The testimony of Mr. Stepniak is to the same effect.*?

On 27 October 2010, the KNF approved the application of PL Holdings and Abris-EMP
to exercise voting rights in WestLB Bank Polska.“* The decision stated that “analysis of
the business strategy presented by the Applicants for WestLB Bank Polska S.A.
suggests that there is no risk of the Applicants exerting an adverse impact on the
bank’s stable and prudent management.”45

On 2 November 2010, the KNF approved a change of name of WestLB Bank Polska to
PBP Bank. The following month, PL Holdings purchased the 55% shareholding in PBP

Bank still held by the Bank’s German parent.

B. Lead-up to a PBP Remedial Plan

On 2 September 2011, the KNF sent a letter to PBP Bank stating that, as a result of its
financial situation and results up to that point, it was required to prepare a “remedial
plan.”46 On 12 September 2011, PBP Bank replied to the KNF objecting to the KNF’s

profitability. It added that it thought preparation of a remedial plan would have an
adverse effect on the Bank’s financial situation.

Discussions between the KNF and PBP Bank took place throughout September and
October 2011. According to Claimant,*® at a meeting in late October between Mr.
Stariczuk (President of PBP’s Management Board) and Mr. Wojciech Kwaésniak (Vice-
president of KNF), Mr. Kwasniak agreed that imposing a remedial plan at that time
would be premature.*?

On 10 February 2012, PBP Bank’s Board updated the KNF with fi ‘ial
information through the end of 2011, urging the KNF to formally withdraw its request
for a remedial plan.®° It expressed concern that news of the initiation of a remedial
plan would adversely affect the Bank’s development of its credit portfolio and deposit
base. The KNF responded on 15 March 2012 to the effect that any reversal of the
request for a remedial plan depended on the Bank’s financial performance.*+

On 1 July 2013, pursuant to the KNF’s instruction, FM Bank and PBP Bank were
merged into FM Bank PBP. In consideration for the assets of FM Bank, PBP Bank
issued shares to FM Holdings and to Mr. Stepniak.*? PL Holdings subsequently
acquired FM Holdings’ shares in FM Bank PBP by issuing PL Holdings shares to FM

Holdings. Then, on 18 July 2013, PL Holdings acquired IFC’s shares in FM Bank.®? Asa

result, PL Holdings came to hold a direct 99.59% interest in FM Bank PBP, with Mr.
Stepniak holding a 0.41% interest.

In March 2012, a listed Polish company that was one of PBP’s primary creditors and a
new entrant into the Polish construction industry — Dolnosalaskie Surowce Skalne
Spéslka Akeyjina (“DSS”) — underwent a financial collapse. On 12 April 2011, PBP Bank
had bought Series F bearer bonds issued by DSS worth PLN 60 million, representing
about 1/5 of the Bank’s net book value.** As a result of DSS’ collapse, PBP Bank
experienced a net loss for 2011.55 According to Respondent, the investment was
made at the fierce insistence of IDM, which as underwriter earned a substantial
commission for the transaction. Further, according to Respondent, Mr. Stariczuk
objected to the investment as unsafe and imprudent, but was overridden.** According
to Mr. Staniczuk’s testimony, the DSS bonds, which were supposed to be fully secured,
were in fact unsecured, and the Bank had full knowledge of that, as well as of DSS’
difficulties, since September or October 2011, but did not have a plan of action.*”
According to Respondent, discord between Abris and IDM clearly surfaced at the 19
April 2012 meeting at the KNF to discuss the problem,*® and, although Abris informed

the KNF on 24 April 2012 that IDM and Abris had reached agreement on a buy-out of

subsequent meeting of 22 May 2012 with the KNF.©

109. A consensus emerged at the 22 May 2012 meeting in favor of injection into the Bank
by Claimant of a cash amount approximately equal to the loss suffered from the DSS
Bonds, either through buying out the DSS Bonds or issuing new shares.**

110. The Parties disagree as to their understandings of the form that a buy-out of the DSS
loans would take. Claimant argues that the Bank was meant merely to transfer title to
the bonds to Claimant by way of a loan (entailing deferred payment), whereas
Respondent argues that nothing short of an immediate injection of cash was
contemplated.* Respondent alleges that Abris deliberately misled the KNF into
thinking that it had paid cash for the bonds.®? Ultimately, the KNF insisted that Abris
and the Bank agree on an actual purchase of the bonds by Abris,® and prevailed.

111. According to Respondent, PBP Bank already showed a loss in the fourth quarter of
2010 and continued to show a loss each month up to August 2011, so that it was
threatened with a balance sheet loss for the financial year ending 31 December 2011.

5° Respondent maintains that the Claimant has filed an incorrect translation of Article 142(1), mistakenly

translating the Polish term strata bilansowa as “net loss” rather than the correct term “balance-sheet loss.” Thus

the provision would read:

In the event of a bank suffering a balance-sheet loss, being threatened with such a loss or finding itself in
danger of insolvency or a loss of liquidity, the bank’s management board shall immediately advise the

39

sheet loss, it must immediately inform the KNF and submit a recovery plan, which
Claimant apparently did not do.*” On 2 September 2011, the KNF exercised its right
under Article 142(1) to require the Bank to submit a remedial plan within a 30-day
period. KNF’s letter stated:

The analysis of the Bank’s financial data indicates a considerable
deterioration in its economic and financial position, shown mainly by the
considerable worsening of financial results observed since Q4, 2010. In 2010,
net profit was at a level of PLN 4 million, compared to PLN 23 million in 2009.
The adverse trends regarding the financial result were more pronounced this
year. The Bank has suffered losses since the beginning of 2011. At the end of
Q1 2011, the accumulated net loss was PLN 1.7 million, which, according to the
information provided by the Bank, arose from lower revenues in the early
months of 2011 in connection with the process of ownership transformations,
the implementation of a new strategy and the reconstruction of the Bank’s
loan portfolio and client database. At the end of June 2011, the net loss
declined to a level of PLN 205 thousand, but, according to data as at the end of
this July, the loss increased again to a level of over PLN 2 million, mainly
because of increasing operating expenses. ...

In the presented financial forecasts, in 2011, the Bank assumed that net
profit would be achieved at a level of PLN 13.6 million, which is influenced by a
considerable increase in the loan portfolio up to a level of PLN 1.3 billion
(actual at the end of June of this year being 23%), an increase in the interest
result to the amount of PLN 28.3 million (actual at the level of 7%) and
operating expenses at a level of PLN 43.3 million. As at 30 June 2011, most of
the amounts forecast in the financial plan were not achieved in a manner that
ensures the achievement of the target profit at the end of 2011.

 

 

112. Ata meeting with the KNF on 19 April 2012, Mr. Gierynski and Mr. Boksa, together
with a representative of IDM, broached two solutions to the DSS bonds problem. One
solution was that PL Holdings and IDM purchase the DSS bonds at nominal value with

a deferred payment. The other was for PL Holdings to buy out IDM’s stake in PBP

Bank and then buy the DSS bonds from PBP Bank, with payment for the bonds
deferred until PL Holdings’ exit from the PBP Bank.® According to Claimant, while
KNF approved both proposals, IDM rejected the former, largely because it itself
needed a cash injection to enable it to avoid bankruptcy.” Accordingly, on 24 April
2012, Abris informed the KNF that IDM was ready to sell its 45% stake in PBP Bank and
that PL Holdings stood ready to execute that transaction. This arrangement did not
satisfy the KNF which, on 27 April 2012, reiterated its requirement that PBP prepare a
remedial plan.” Despite this fact, Claimant hoped that the requirement of a plan
would still be withdrawn if Claimant managed to remove the DSS bonds from the PBP
Bank’s books.72

On 2 May 2012, Mr. Gieryrniski and Mr. Boksa again met with Mr. Kwasniak, reiterating
PL Holdings’ willingness to buy IDM’s stake in PBP Bank and then buy the DSS bonds.”
According to Claimant, Mr. Kwasniak accepted that course of action, including the fact
that PL Holdings would defer payment of the bonds until its exit from its investment in
PBP Bank, and stated that it did not require KNF approval.”* Evidently, however, IDM
was not following through, and Mr. Boksa so reported to KNF.”>

On 22 May 2012, at the KNF’s invitation,”° Mr. Gieryfiski attended a meeting of the

KNF Board of Directors at which PBP’s financial situation was to be discussed. In

attendance for the KNF, alongside Mr. Kwasniak, were Andrzej Jakubiak (Chairman of
the KNF), Leslaw Gajek (Vice-Chairman of the KNF), as well as Witold Koziriski and
Ludwik Kotecki. According to Claimant, Mr. Gierynski informed the KNF officials that
PL Holdings still preferred to buy out IDM’s stake in PBP Bank, and those officials were
agreeable to that approach, again stating that no formal KNF approval would be
needed for that transaction.

On 12 July 2012, a further meeting was held at which Mr. Boksa presented to the KNF
the terms of the offer PL Holdings had received to purchase IDM’s 45% stake in PBP
Bank.”” However, Mr. Kwaésniak pointed out that, having failed to solve the DSS
problem by 30 June 2012, PBP Bank could not help but show a loss in its year-end
accounts.’® According to Mr. Gieryriski, Mr. Kwasniak nevertheless expressed approval
of the proposed deal with IDM.”9

The next day, Mr. Boksa informed the KNF that agreement had been reached with
IDM for PL Holdings’ purchase of the bonds.®° That transaction closed on 18 July 2012,
with PL Holdings acquiring IDM’s 45% share in PBP Bank for PLN 95 million and
becoming 100% owner of the Bank, while at the same time acquiring the DSS bearer

bonds from PBP Bank.®? On 24 July 2012, PBP’s Management Board wrote to the KNF

77 Boksa ws, para. 24. According to the terms of the offer, PBP Bank would transfer title to the DSS bonds to PL
Holdings by way of a loan, in return for interest payments from PL Holdings and payback by PL Holdings of the
value of the bonds at the end of 2015.

confirming PL Holdings’ acquisition of the IDM shares and its removal of the bad debts
from PBP’s portfolio.

On 23 November 2012, Mr. Kwasniak informed Mr. Stariczuk that the KNF disapproved
of the transactions “in terms of business risk and quality of the Bank’s equity.”®2
Despite Mr. Boksa’s effort to dissuade Mr. Kwasniak by reminding him of the history
of the transactions,?? Mr. Kwasniak stood firm, claiming that the DSS bond
arrangement “[was] not what [Claimant] declared earlier before the KNF and during
the meetings with the KNF Chairman and Deputy Chairman.”®* Nevertheless, Mr.
Kwasniak told PL Holdings in the same letter that it expected PL Holdings to make the
payment to PBP Bank for purchase of the DSS bonds by the end of 2012.®° In early
2013, PL Holdings complied with the KNF’s directive, paying PBP Bank an additional
PLN 60 million for the DSS bonds.®°

The fact remained that Claimant had been unable to close the IDM and DSS bonds
transactions before the end of June 2012, i.e. before the date for approval of PBP’s
2011 financial year-end accounts. Consequently, the loss of PLN 73.763 million due to
the DSS bonds remained on PBP’s 2011 accounts.2” Claimant maintains that, without

that item, PBP Bank would have shown a profit of PLN 6.414 million.®®

c. The PBP Bank Remedial Plan

On 12 September 2011, the Bank informed the KFN that, in its opinion, the request to
prepare a recovery plan was premature.®? After several exchanges and meetings, on
25 October 2011, the KNF asked the Bank to provide detailed financial forecasts for
the remainder of 2011 and a budget for 2012.°° On 31 October 2011, Mr. Kwaésniak
stated that the KNF was not prepared to formally withdraw its request for a remedial
plan, but would reassess the Bank’s financial situation at the end of 2011.°*

On 4 November 2011, PBP Bank submitted to the KNF its financial forecasts for the
remainder of 2011, and on 11 February 2012 submitted its preliminary, unaudited
financial results for 2011.9? These data revealed that the Bank had realised a net
profit of PLN 8.72 million, which was PLN 4.78 million less than planned in the
approved budget for 2011, but PLN 7.69 million higher than the projections presented
in September. According to Respondent, “[t]he Bank’s financial results, therefore,
finally seemed to be on the plus side, although this was not yet conclusive evidence
that the Bank’s financial position had been permanently rectified.”

On 15 March 2012, the KNF reiterated that it could only withdraw its request for a
remedial plan if an examination of the Bank’s existing and projected financial situation
justified that step, and to that end, requested further information from the Bank.

“The measures taken by the Management Board must guarantee the Bank’s safe

development over a long-term perspective and cannot lead to any potential
destabilization of the banking system.”

122. On 27 April 2012, following a great many exchanges over the IDM and DSS bonds
transactions, the KNF decided to require PBP to prepare a remedial plan.°® In its letter
of that date, the KNF attributed its request to the Bank’s adverse financial situation.
Respondent cites as evidence of that situation a decline in the Bank’s equity and in its
capital adequacy, the latter to a point below that recommended by the KNF.9”

123. On 2 May 2012, the Bank informed the KNF that it had not managed to meet the KNF’s
liquidity requirements, due largely to a decline in deposits.°® According to
Respondent, the Bank attributed that decline not merely to the DSS losses, but also to
the difficulties that IDM was experiencing, having sustained a significant loss in 2011
reflected in its financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2011.°° Further, the Bank
advised the KNF that it had formally requested Abris and IDM for liquidity
assistance,’ pursuant to the commitment to provide such assistance they had made
when applying to the KNF for consent to exercise voting rights in the Bank.*
According to Mr. Stariczuk, the assistance that the Bank received from Abris and IDM
was entirely insufficient.1°2 Consequently, the Bank’s senior management met with

the National Bank of Poland (i.e., the central bank), as well as with the Ministry of

Finance and the Bank Guarantee Fund, to discuss the possibility of an emergency
loan. Respondent cites as a further source of concern the high degree of
concentration in both the Bank’s depositor base and its loan portfolio. The KNF
accordingly conducted an analysis of the bank’s exposure related to the construction
industry, in which companies other than DSS had also failed.?°> It concluded that, as
of 30 April 2012, the Bank’s exposure included two unsecured loans that amounted to

approximately PLN 38 million.1°° At the KNF’s urging, the Bank reclassified the loans

 

and made appropriate provision for their loss.°”

The record suggests that the Bank’s inability to meet required liquidity levels
continued until the second half of August 2012.1

However, Claimant observes that the KNF required preparation of a remedial plan
even before it could know for a fact that the IDM and DSS bonds transactions would
not close before 30 June 2012, and that the KNF maintained its demand even after it
knew that the books of PBP Bank for 2012 would show a large accounting profit.1°
Respondent, on the other hand, denies that the KNF ever led the Bank to believe that
it would not need to prepare a remedial plan if it successfully dealt with the DSS Bond

issue.1°

In accordance with the KNF’s demand, on 6 June 2012, PBP Bank and Claimant
submitted a draft PBP Bank remedial plan for the period between 1 July 2012 and 30
June 2013.

The draft remedial plan was discussed at a 13 June 2012 meeting at which the KNF
expressed some reservations.'"? The KNF wanted, among other things, a provision for
loss of certain loans, further reduction in concentration of deposits and loans,
additional action on the liquidity front, submission of a model of bank functioning,
consideration of merger and additional shareholders, and greater capitalization. The
Parties addressed specifically and in positive terms the prospect of an eventual merger
with FM Bank.1!2

On 13 June 2012, PBP Bank wrote to the KNF asking permission to make certain
adjustments to the remedial plan as submitted on 6 June 2012 and to furnish the
revision by no later than 29 June 2012.11? PBP Bank worked through the month of
June on revising the 6 June remedial plan.1** At a meeting of the Supervisory Board of
PBP Bank on 28 June 2012, Mr. Stariczuk, who was President of the PBP Bank
Management Board, presented five possible scenarios for the future of PBP Bank to be
used in the revised remedial plan, as follows:

continuation of the present model

maintenance the corporate profile, but modification of the business model
merger with a retail bank

introduction of a new investor
dissolution of the Bank

While the second option had the advantage of being achievable more quickly,
discussion at the Supervisory Board meeting revolved mainly around the third and
fourth.145

On 29 June 2012, the Supervisory Board adopted a resolution to submit the revised
remedial plan to the KNF,??° which PBP Bank did on the same day,?”” laying out all the
options while indicating its preferences.

A favored option was to bring in additional shareholders. To this end, the KNF
examined the possibility of a particular cooperative bank, Spotdzielczy Bank Rzemiosta

i Rolnictwa (“SK Bank”) becoming a shareholder of the PBP Bank.14® In the meantime,

 

at a 12 July 2012 meeting, Mr. Kwasniak raised the possibility with Abris of a merger

initial favor.72° When it became

   

with FM Bank,""? a possibility that met with Abri:
clear that SK Bank was not in fact in a position to contribute the capital needed, the
KNF came to the view that merger with FM Bank was the best solution.*2+

On 29 August 2012, the KNF informed PBP Bank that the 29 June 2012 version of the
remedial plan could not be accepted, and invited the Bank to submit an adjusted
version of the plan within 30 days.?2? It specifically asked that, in addition to

addressing financial concerns that the KNF did not think the Bank had adequately

addressed, consideration be given to the alternative of a merger with another banking

entity through a common shareholder.’?3 Claimant describes this request for a merger
on the KNF’s part as a “volte-face.”124

Claimant’s witnesses testified that, at a meeting at the KNF on 3 September 2012, Mr.
Kwasniak indicated that the KNF was maintaining its request for an amended remedial
plan and that the bank with which he urged PBP Bank to merge was FM Bank.
According to Claimant, Mr. KwaSsniak stated to Mr. Gierynski and Mr. Boksa in very
strong terms at a 7 November 2012 meeting that any remedial plan proposed by PBP
Bank had to entail a merger with FM Bank.?2> Evidently Mr. Kwasniak also floated the
alternative of PL Holdings selling its 100% shareholding in the PBP bank, a course of
action Claimant strongly opposed.’2° According to Respondent, Mr. Gierynski
appeared entirely amenable to the idea of a merger with FM Bank.’2” Due to what
appeared to it to be a reversal of position by the KNF on the merger, Claimant asked
KNF to confirm that it was released from the commitment it had made in 2010 not to

merge.

[Mr. Kwagniak banged on the table and shouted something to this effect (I cannot recall the precise
words): “Don’t you understand what we want from you? We want you to merge the banks. We won’t
approve any remedial plan that does not include a merger. We will reject any remedial plan you submit
and appoint a receiver.”

226 Mr. Gieryriski testified to this effect:

Selling PBP Bank was not a realistic option. PL Holdings had invested with a particular time horizon in mid, wishing to
grow the bank to the limit of its capital injection and then exit the investment through a staged IPO at the appropriate
time. To sell at this point did not make financial sense; PL Holdings would not have been able to grow the business to
the limit of the capital injection it had provided thereby realising as much as possible the value of its investment in
PBP Bank.

Asale of the bank at that point would have been a fire sale, which would have been reflected in the level of the offers
received. Also, after only a year or so of operations, PBP Bank’s business was only just beginning to develop in the
way anticipated.

At the deadline of 15 November 2012 that the KNF had established for PBP Bank’s
submission of an amended remedial plan, PBP Bank submitted a document titled
“[A]djusted Remedial Plan for [PBP Bank] for the years 2013-2015.”?28 The plan was
premised on a merger with FM Bank.!2°
On the next day, Mr. Boksa wrote to the KNF reiterating his question whether the KNF
was reversing the commitment it had required in 2010 and seeking confirmation
merger was the KNF’s “preferred option.”22°
The KNF responded to these questions in two separate letters, each dated 19
November 2012. The first letter stated that the KNF had never requested or received
an undertaking by Claimant not to pursue a merger.*31_ The second letter confirmed
that a merger between the PBP Bank and the FM Bank to form a single entity was “the
preferred route.”132
Shortly thereafter, on 23 November 2012, the KNF rejected the amended remedial
plan that PBP Bank had submitted on 15 November 2012. According to the KNF, the
plan did not adequately effect the merger intended:
The idea of merger, as presented by the Bank, in fact, means preserving the
split into two banks, and not into two divisions, and deprives the Bank of the
synergy effect in terms of both business and costs. The operation of the merger
of the two banks should lead to a full integration of the processes of future
operations, including risk management, so that the merged Bank operate[s] as
an integrated whole. Moreover, the Bank has presented an approximate

schedule for the merger of the banks, failing to specify the expected
operation’s time framework, which needs to be supplemented. At the same

agreement was reached on a merger plan by both banks’ management boards and approved by both banks’ shareholders.

time, the presented development diagram of the separated parts, including the
retail area, within the indicated corporate structures, indicates the intent of
the non-merger of both institutions.
In its letter, the KNF gave PBP Bank a period of 21 days to produce another version of
the remedial plan.
Claimant represents that, starting then, PL Holdings and Abris, in conjunction with the
two banks, worked on a new remedial plan premised on a full merger between FM
Bank and PBP Bank, though both PL Holdings and Abris had misgivings about the
merger.434 On 17 December 2012, PBP Bank submitted its further amended plan,?*>
which the Bank described as “based on the assumption of a full-scale merger, taking
into account the integration of all corporate processes and functions, including the
ones related to risk management.”?3° It contemplated the merger taking place on 30
June 2013.
By letter of 9 January 2013, the KNF responded positively to this latest remedial plan,

On 18 March 2013, FM Bank and PBP Bank jointly presented the KNF with an
application for permission to merge which indicated that PBP Bank would be the
surviving entity. The application was also to serve as a business plan of the merged

bank.

D. The Merger with Meritum Bank

According to Claimant, it came to the view that, despite the prospective merger, a gap
in banking services remained. The merged bank would manage to cater to the
microloans market (FM Bank’s advantage) and the corporate banking market (PBP
Bank’s advantage), but would leave untouched “the middle.”*2° Claimant identified
Meritum Bank ICB Spélka Akcyjna (“Meritum Bank”) as the best candidate to fill that
gap.’“° Thus, a three-way merger was contemplated.

The chair of Meritum Bank’s Supervisory Board was at that time Mr. Slawomir
Lachowski, an experienced Polish banking executive. According to his own witness
testimony, Mr. Lachowski (a) had developed the first internet bank in Poland, (b) had
contributed to the restructuring of the very large Polish bank, PBG Bank, and (c) as
CEO of another Polish bank, BRE Bank, had successfully implemented a remedial
plan.**1 In conversation with Mr. Krzysztof Kulig, a partner at Meritum Bank’s largest

(but not majority) shareholder, Innova Capital Sp. z. 0.0. (“Innova”), Mr. Gieryriski,

139 Boksa ws, paras. 34-36; Gierynski ws, para. 45. According to Mr. Gierynski:

[Meritum Bank] had some strengths that FM Bank and PDP Bank did not have and some weaknesses where FM Bank
and PBP Bank did not have any, so there were a number of potential synergies. It was also 47%-owned by Innova
Capital Sp. z. 0.0 (“Innova”), another private equity fund, which meant it would likely have a similar time horizon in
mind for the investment...

came to the view that Mr. Lachowski would serve well as CEO and President of the
Management Board of a prospective three-way merged bank.142

On 22 January 2013, Mr. Gieryniski and Mr. Kulig requested a meeting with the KNF to
discuss a possible three-way merger.’*? That meeting — attended by seven KNF
officials — took place two days later. According to Claimant, the KNF reacted positively
to the idea because it was compatible with the policy of consolidating smaller banks
and creating more universal ones.1“4 However, Mr. Kwasniak stated that the merger
between PBP Bank and FM Bank should be consummated first (by the end of June
2013) followed by a merger of that merged bank with Meritum Bank (by the end of
2013), i.e. via two two-way mergers.’*° There is some dispute between the Parties
over how the suggestion of appointing Mr. Lachowski as President of the
Management Board of the merged bank, which arose at the meeting, was received.
While Mr. Gieryfiski reported touting Mr. Lachowski’s knowledge and experience,1*°
Respondent suggests that even Mr. Gieryriski did not display perfect confidence in
those respects.14” Apparently, Mr. Kwasniak took no definitive position at the time on

Mr. Lachowski’s candidacy.18

deputy president of the prospective three-way merged bank.

Negotiations among the three banks ensued, with Mr. Lachowski, who was highly
optimistic about the prospect, taking the lead.*4° On 11 February 2013, Mr. Kulig, Mr.
Boksa and Mr. Lachowski signed a letter of intent to produce a three-way merger,
whose essentials were recorded in a document titled “Project Boat: Term Sheet.”25°
During this period, Mr. Lachowski familiarized himself with PBP Bank (and its remedial
plan) and FM Bank.15+
On 6 June 2013, Mr. Lachowski presented to the KNF the proposed strategy for the
eventual three-way merger and a business plan.45? As stated in the “Project Boat:
Term Sheet,” the eventually merged bank would be “perceived as less risky (due to
larger scale) and capable of more dynamic growth thanks to larger capital base ... and
customer reach.”
According to Claimant’s witnesses, the Meritum Bank shareholders other than Innova
(i.e., the EBRD and Wolfensohn) did not support the idea of a three-way merger and it
could not therefore go through. According to Respondent, however, Meritum Bank
itself acquired “cold feet” over the merged bank’s likely susceptibility to market
volatility:

Works on the transaction were stopped, because during the commercial due

diligence investigation, the shareholders of Meritum Bank decided, that due to

a significant concentration of both deposits and credits, the PBP Bank business

model is less stable and more prone to fluctuations, and thus bears a higher
risk than the other entities. This risk associated with the PBP Bank business

149 Lachowski ws, para. 20, Boksa ws, para. 38; Gieryriski ws, para. 51. Mr. Lachowski testified (Lachowski ws, para. 19)
that: “Considering the different profiles of the businesses of each of the three banks, a skilful execution of the
merger would create an opportunity to develop a competitive business and operational model.”

model outweighed the potential positive contribution which could result from
the merger of Meritum Bank and FM Bank, and led to the decision of the
shareholders of Meritum Bank on the withdrawal from the project.453

In any event, at a meeting on 25 July 2013, the merger talks collapsed.45* On the same

day, Mr. Boksa so informed the KNF.1°>

E. The FM/PBP Merger
The Polish Banking Act required PBP Bank and FM Bank to seek approval of the KNF
for the proposed merger.45* On 15 March 2013, the FM Bank and PBP Bank
Management Boards approved the merger plan and three days later submitted to the
KNF the merger application, together with a business plan for the merged bank for
2014-2016.457 On 26 April 2013, the KNF, while requiring a number of adjustments,
expressed a favorable view of the business plan. It stated that “[a]nalysis of the
Business Plan has shown that if all of its assumptions are realized, this would create an
opportunity to achieve permanent improvement of the situation of the merged Bank,
while reducing the risk generated by the Bank.”458 Then on 20 May 2013, the two

banks submitted a revised business plan as requested.459 Among the information

 

provided at the KNF’s request was an indication of the responsi ‘ies of individual

Management Board members for different elements of the business plan. Further

comments by the KNF led to some further revisions submitted to the KNF on 29 May
2013.16 PBP Bank evidently understood that this revised business plan would also
serve as PBP’s remedial plan.’ A further revised draft, approved by the banks, titled
Remedial Plan of June 2013 (“June 2013 Remedial Plan”), was submitted to the KNF on
10 June 2013.16

The banks informed the KNF that Mr. Tomasz Maciejewski (then First Deputy
President of FM Bank) would become CEO and President of the Management Board of
the merged bank, while Ms. Elzbieta Bhagat (then Vice-President of the Management
Board of PBP Bank) would join the Management Board of the merged bank.*® In early
March 2013, Mr. Gieryriski offered the position of Deputy President of the
Management Board of the merged bank to Mr. Starniczuk, who had expected to have a
position on the merged bank’s Supervisory Board. Mr. Stariczuk had immediate
reservations about that assignment, but appeared to accept it.‘ According to
Respondent, the only reason Mr. Staniczuk agreed to this arrangement was because he
had been promised that, as soon as the three-way merger took place, he would
become deputy president of that bank, which he considered to be a great deal bigger
and stronger entity than the two-way merged bank on its own.'© The implication is

that if Mr. Stariczuk had known the three-way merger would not take place and that

he would only be deputy president of the two-way merged bank, he would never have
agreed.

The final business plan submitted to the KNF on 10 June 2013, showed the following
lineup of officers of the merged bank:?%

Mr. Maciejewski: President of the Management Board

Mr. Stariczuk: Deputy President of the Management Board

Michal Zielke: Deputy President of the Management Board

Stefan Swatigkowski: Deputy President of the Management Board
Krzysztof Jaczewski: Deputy President of the Management Board
Jarostaw Lejko: Deputy President of the Management Board

On 18 June 2013, the KNF approved the June 2013 Remedial Plan,*®” enabling the
merger to take place and the merged bank, known as “FM Bank PBP” to be
established, effective 1 July 2013. The shareholding in FM Bank PBP was PL Holdings,
99.59% and Mr. Stepniak, 0.41%. According to Respondent, since the composition of
the Management Board was an element of the remedial plan, any changes to its

required an d tother dial plan.1®

F. Changes in Management Board Composition

Toward the end of June 2013, the Supervisory Board of PBP Bank (as the surviving
entity of the imminent merger) set about appointing the merged bank’s Management
Board, as outlined above. Among other things, in order to appoint Mr. Stariczuk as
Deputy President of the Management Board, he had to be removed from his position

as President of the PBP Bank’s Management Board. On 20 June 20 2013, PBP Bank’s

General Counsel sent draft minutes of a meeting of PBP Bank’s Supervisory Board to
Mr. Stariczuk which reflected that he would be resigning from his previous position as
President of the Management Board of PBP Bank. According to Claimant, it was
unexpected that Mr. Stariczuk would refuse to resign,*©° but in fact he did so refuse.1”°
Mr. Gierynski then met on an emergency basis with Mr. Staficzuk to remind him that
he had agreed to become Deputy President of the Management Board.17+

152. PBP Bank’s Supervisory Board met on 24 June 2013 to make the appointments to the
Management Board. The Supervisory Board made all the appointments provided for
in the June 2013 Remedial Plan, with the exception of Mr. Stariczuk as Deputy
President.’”2, The next day, Mr. Stariczuk sent a letter to the KNF, copied to Mr.
Gierynski, urging that it take action against Mr. Maciejewski’s appointment as
President of the Management Board, since Mr. Stanczuk had not resigned from that
position.’”? On 26 June 2013, the Supervisory Board of PBP Bank adopted a resolution
accepting Mr. Stariczuk’s resignation as President of the PBP Bank’s Management
Board,1”4 basing that resignation on his approval of the remedial plan submitted to the
KNF on 17 December 2012, which had identified Mr. Maciejewski as Management
Board President. Respondent argues forcefully that Mr. Stariczuk’s failure to reject the

169 statement of Claim, para. 132; Gieryriski ws, para. 61. It was unexpected because Mr. Stariczuk had previously

appeared to accept that he would become a Deputy President of the merged bank’s Management Board and

because he had signed the June 2013 Remedial Plan which showed him in that position. Gieryriski ws, para. 61; KNF

remedial plan cannot be properly considered a resignation as bank official because it
was insufficiently clear and decisive.1”> According to Respondent, the Supervisory
Board, rather than dismiss Mr. Stariczuk (and pay whatever consequences attend such
action) improperly named Mr. Maciejewski as Management Board President while Mr.
Stariczuk technically still occupied that post.1”° The result was the irregular situation of
having two occupants of a single position.

That same day, after the meeting, Mr. Stariczuk sent an email to the Supervisory
Board members in effect refusing any position on the Board other than President but
also refusing to resign from the Board.?””

On 1 July 2013, in accordance with the agreed upon schedule, the two-way merger
creating FM Bank PBP became effective. When Mr. Stanczuk refused to accept the
departure package offered him, the Supervisory Board finally on 10 July 2013
dismissed him from the Management Board altogether.*78

On 12 July 2013, FM Bank PBP notified the KNF of the Management Board changes
and reported what had transpired between the Supervisory Board and Mr.
Stariczuk.1”2 On 22 July 2013, the KNF sent a letter to FM Bank PBP affirming the KNF’s
approval of the merger and reiterating that the merger plan also constituted a

remedial plan within the meaning of Article 142 of the Banking Law.7®°

Respondent is critical in these proceedings of the way in which Mr. Staniczuk’s
on the Board was handled. In dent’s view, the
Supervisory Board of PBP Bank did not properly inform Mr. Stariczuk of his anticipated
position in the merged bank. More generally, the Board failed to ensure the “diligent
selection of people for managerial positions” and instead acted in a manner that “can
be best described as careless and unprofessional.”?81 According to Respondent, Abris’
handling of the matter was unlawful and in breach of both its investor commitments
and the remedial plan.1®?

Mr. Stariczuk’s dismissal had left an obvious vacancy on the Management Board.
Following conversations between Mr. Gieryriski and Mr. Lachowski, the latter
indicated that he would welcome involvement with FM Bank PBP and the opportunity
to consolidate the two-way merger.1®? He reiterated that sentiment in conversations
with Mr. Boksa.1** At a 29 July 2013 meeting among Mr. Boksa, Mr. Gieryniski and Mr.
Lachowski, the latter revealed a keen interest to work with FM Bank PBP.28 At the
beginning of August, Mr. Lachowski met with Mr. Maciejewski. According to
Claimant, Mr. Lachowski acknowledged in the discussion the need to act in accordance
with the remedial plan.*8° According to Mr. Lachowski, Mr. Maciejewski stated that if

the Supervisory Board should want to appoint Mr. Lachowski as President of the

Management Board, he would be willing to step down and become a Deputy
President.1®”

On 5 August 2013, Mr. Lachowski met with Mr. Gieryriski and Mr. Boksa to explain
how he proposed to implement the remedial plan as well as improve the functioning
of the Management Board."®* The next day, Mr. Lachowski presented his views to the
entire Board.'®° Finally, on 8 August 2013, the Supervisory Board appointed Mr.
Lachowski to the Management Board. At the same meeting, Mr. Maciejewski
tendered his resignation as CEO and President of the Management Board, and was
appointed First Vice-President of the Management Board (CFFO).1°? Mr. Lejko and Mr.
Zielke resigned from the Management Board and became directors of FM Bank PBP.1°2
On the same day, FM Bank PBP issued a press release reporting that Mr. Lachowski
would serve as acting President of the Board until consent of the KNF was obtained,’
and the news was reported in the press.’ In his testimony, Mr. Kwasniak described
the KNF’s learning about a bank president’s appointment only through the press as
unprecedented.'®> According to Respondent, “[this] series of unconsulted changes to
the Bank's Management Board, following other events described in [the] Statement of

Defence, left the KNF's trust in Abris shattered.”

On Monday, 12 August 2013, Mr. Boksa sent a letter to the KNF informing it of all the

in ition of the Board and ining their rati 196

These included the 10 July 2013 dismi: of Mr. ficzuk from the

 

Board, Mr. Maciejewski’s 8 August 2013 resignation from the position of Management
Board President and appointment as the first Vice-President of the Board, Mr.
Lachowski’s 8 August 2013 appointment as President of the Management Board, and
the 8 August 2013 resignations of Mr. Lejko and Zielke as Management Board
members. It is uncontested that all of these changes were made without prior
consultation with the KNF, and in the case of Mr. Lachowski also without the KNF's
prior approval. However, the new appointments were evidently identified as “acting”
only.

The 12 August 2013 letter from Mr. Boksa stated that “the decision [of Mr. Stariczuk to
resign] compelled the Bank’s Supervisory Board to search urgently for a candidate
who would strengthen the composition of the Bank’s Management Board and who
would give a guarantee of implementing the plan approved for the Bank.” It added
that the person chosen, Mr. Lachowski, was an individual whose “education and
professional experience ... gives a guarantee of [FM Bank PBP’s] prudent and stable
management.”

The KNF regarded the changes in composition of the Management Board notified to it
by Mr. Boksa as improper.

According to Article 22b(1) of the Banking Act, as it then stood:

The appointment of two management board members, including the
president, shall require the approval of the Polish Financial Supervision
Authority. The application for such approval shall be submitted by the
supervisory board.1°”

In addition, in its commitments as investor, Abris undertook to consult with the KNF

 

when filling positions in the Management Board.1**

Respondent claims that the KNF assigned great importance to the declared

of the Board r | in particular Mr.
Maciejewski’s appointment as President of the Board, inasmuch as he had personally
coordinated preparation of the remedial plan that the KNF ultimately approved.

Given FM Bank’s and PBP Bank’s financial challenges, KNF reportedly considered
staffing of the Management Board to be a key element in ensuring effective
implementation of the merged bank’s remedial plan.19? According to Respondents’
expert witness, Mr. Zapadka, while a change of management board members would
not ordinarily be a matter of major concern, it is a matter of major concern when a
bank is subject to a remedial plan whose correct implementation is essential.2°°

That same morning, 12 August 2013, Ms. Iwona Kozlowska, Deputy Director of the
KNF’s Department of Commercial and Specialised Banking and Payment Institutions,
called Mr. Gieryfski on behalf of Mr. Kwasniak. According to Mr. Gieryrfiski, Ms.
Kozlowska demanded that the Supervisory Board of FM Bank PBO “invalidate” all

decisions it had taken at its meeting of 8 August 2013, notably all changes to the

197 Banking Act of 29 Aug. 1996 (Exh. RLA-2).

Management Board.2°! Mr. Gieryriski reiterated the reasons for those decisions and,
when Ms. Kozlowska was unmoved, he stated that he refused to take the requested
action. According to Mr. Gierynski, Ms. Kozlowska essentially told him, “you need to
realize that we are prepared to take serious steps if you don’t do this.” Further,
according to Mr. Gieryrnski, when he reiterated his unwillingness, Ms. Kozlowska said

“so now you will see.”2°2

In her testimony, however, Ms. Kozlowska denies ever
having demanded that the Supervisory Board annul Mr. Lachowski’s appointment.
According to her, she did no more than state that the KNF “would conduct further
supervisory activities in this case.”?°? The Respondent asserts that she did nothing
more than “loyally inform[ ] Mr. Gieryfiski that the KFN may take suitable actions in
connection with this situation.”?%

In his witness statement, Mr. Gieryriski affirms that Polish law does not allow the

Supervisory Board chairman to unilaterally invalidate decisions by the Supervisory

Board merely because instructed to do so.?°>

G. The KNF’s Proceedings against FM Bank PBP

Because, in Respondent’s words, “the situation with the Bank was out of control,”2>
the KNF took action. On 14 August 2013, the KNF instituted two proceedings: one

against FM Bank PBP and the other against PL Holdings and Abris-EMP. These

proceedings contemplated, respectively, an order establishing a receivership (to be
managed by a KNF-appointed trustee)?°” and an order prohibiting PL Holdings from
exercising its voting rights as FM Bank PBP shareholder.” The first set of proceedings
was explained in the following terms:
an impact on the efficacy of executing the remedial plan by making a change to
the position of Management Board President, which forms a deviation from
the remedial plan accepted by KNF, [a change that] may not just adversely
affect the introduced conditions for stable management but may also pose a
threat to the proper execution of the remedial plan in the financial and
economic area.
The second proceeding was similarly described as prompted by fear of “an adverse
impact on the prudent and stable management of FM Bank PBP S.A.” According to
Mr. Kwasniak, there was “nothing extraordinary or non-standard” about the
proceedings.2°° Moreover, according to Respondent, Claimant was afforded all
reasonable procedural protections.7!°
In a letter of the same date to the Supervisory Board, the KNF clarified that the

proceedings were being | hed due to ch to the of the

 

207 Notification from the KNF to FM Bank BPB of the commencement of an administrative proceeding to appoint a
receiver, 14 Aug. 2013 (Exh. C-131). Appointment of a receiver is authorized by Article 145(1) of the Banking Act if
the KNF finds that a bank’s performance of a remedial plan is ineffective.

President of that Board.”1*

 

On 19 August 2013, Mr. Boksa requested a meeting with the KNF to discuss ini ‘ion
of the proceedings and the board changes that evidently had prompted the KNF to
bring them.?!2 There followed a 21 August 2013 meeting between Mr. Boksa and Mr.
Gierynski, on the one hand, and several KNF representatives, including Mr. Jakubiak,
on the other. Mr. Boksa explained the reasons for the Board changes,?3 while Mr.
Gierynski apologized for the press report on Mr. Lachowski’s appointment and offered
to step down as Chairman of the FM Bank PBP Supervisory Board.?"* The Supervisory
Board followed up, at Mr. Jakubiak’s request, with detailed written explanations of
the changes.24> In a letter to the KNF, Mr. Boksa asserted, among other things, that
the changes were “aimed at ensuring the bank’s prudent and stable management,”
and reported that Mr. Gierynski would step down as Chairman of the Supervisory
Board, effective 31 October 2013.7° He was eventually replaced on 31 October 2013

by Mr. Tomasz Bieske.??”

eventually approved Mr. Lachowski’s appointment on 22 July 2014.79

172. Upon application by Mr. Boksa on 13 September 2013, the KNF approved the
appointment of Mr. Wojciech Papierak to the Management Board of FM Bank PBP.?2°
At a 30 September 2013 meeting, the Supervisory Board adopted a resolution
changing the scope of Mr. Lachowski’s responsibilities, entrusting him with temporary
supervision over the Corporate Banking Division and defining Mr. Papierak’s
responsibility for supervising the Micro-Enterprise Banking Division.222 These changes
were reported to the KNF on 1 October 2013.?22

173. On 9 October 2013, the KNF asked the Supervisory Board of the FM Bank PBP to
further explain what had occurred in July and August 2013,?2? and Mr. Boksa furnished
those explanations on 21 October 2013.774

174. As part of the administrative proceedings contemplating receivership of the FM Bank

PBP, between 5 and 20 November 2013, the KNF conducted interviews with several

218 Motion for approval of S. Lachowski as President of the management Board of FM Bank PBP, 4 Sept. 2013 (Exh.
C-134). Mr. Boksa explains in his witness statement that the passage of time before the application was due to the
necessity of collecting a great many documents pertaining to Mr. Lachowski’s background and professional
experience. Boksa ws, para. 66.

persons (Mr. Gieryriski, Mr. Boksa, Mr. Lachowski, Mr. Maciejewski and Mr. Stariczuk)
concerning the changes to the Management Board.?2>

There followed, in connection with the receivership proceeding, a comprehensive
inspection by the KNF of the FM Bank PBP pursuant to Article 133 of the Banking Act.
This inspection was conducted over a four-week period between 25 November and 20
December 2013. According to Mr. Boksa, the inspection entailed visits by 30 KNF
inspectors to FM Bank PBP’s headquarters.226

There resulted a detailed 61-page inspection record, with exhibits, dated 31 January
2014 (“Inspection Record”).22” The Parties offer dramatically different descriptions of
the Record.

As described by Claimant, the Record reported essentially three management
“irregularities”:

e issuance of “opinions” by the Supervisory Board that amounted to binding
instructions and reflected arrogation to the Supervisory Board of management
decisions belonging to the Management Board

¢ conclusion by the FM Bank PBP of two contracts for services rendered by acting
President Mr. Lachowski that were part of his business activities

e conclusion by the FM Bank PBP of a contract for legal services contracts with

Mr. Lachowski and with a law firm, one of the partners of which (Wojciech
Fabrycki) was a member of the Supervisory Board

227 Report of the comprehensive inspection of FM Bank PBP, 31 Jan. 2014 (“Inspection Record”) (Exh. C-162).

178. That aside, the Inspection Record concluded that, as of 30 September 2013, “the
economic and financial situation of FM Bank PBP S.A. was stable and did not endanger
the security of the funds deposited in the bank accounts.”22°

179. In Respondent’s view, however, the inspection did not merely show management
irregularities on the part of the Bank, but also established that those irregularities
represented violations of law. Thus, the Supervisory Board’s issuance of binding
opinions to the Management Board might constitute a violation of Article 375 of the
Commercial Companies Code. Moreover, the KNF described the service contracts
entered into with Mr. Lachowski and with Mr. Fabrycki’s law firm as evidencing
potential violations of various corporate governance conflict of interest rules. To this
extent, the Record was “rather disastrous for the Bank.”222

180. On 18 February 2014, the Bank wrote to the KNF attempting to explain the few
concerns that the KNF had expressed. Regarding the “opinions,” the letter stated that
the Supervisory Board had issued only one such opinion, which approved the
extension of financing to an FM Bank PBP client. (Ultimately, the financing was
refused.) Regarding the contract for services with Mr. Lachowski, the letter explained
that Mr. Lachowski’s appointment as acting President of the Management Board was
itself based on a management contract under which Mr. Lachowski performed his
services in that capacity. The additional services were rendered pursuant to a separate
consultancy contract pertaining to certain project-specific services. The letter reported

that the Bank’s entry into that other contract was ratified by a reputable law firm,

28 Inspection Record, p. 2 (Exh. C-162).
29 statement of Defence, para. 129.

whose opinion was attached to the letter. However, the Bank indicated its willingness

 

to terminate that other contract if the KNF so wished. Finally, the letter stated that
the Bank had specifically asked the law firm, with which it already had a contract for
services, whether appointing one of its partners to the Supervisory Board was lawful
and had been informed that it was. The Bank hastened to add in the same letter that
Mr. Fabrycki had, out of an excess of caution, resigned from the Supervisory Board,
effective 1 March 2014.?30

On 2 April 2014, the KNF sent FM Bank PBP a set of post-inspection recommendations
(“Post-Inspection Recommendations”) instructing the Bank to correct their regularities
cited in the Inspection Record.?2 According to Claimant, the Supervisory Board of the
Bank was ordered to discontinue the issuance of binding instructions to the
Management Board on the granting of loans. It was also ordered to discontinue
entering into service contracts with persons or entities linked to members of either
the Supervisory or Management Board. It added:

Failure to implement the foregoing recommendations may lead to KNF
applying the supervisory measures provided for in Article 138 Section 3 and
Article 141 Section 1 of the entitled Banking Law.?32

Respondent portrays the Post-Inspection Recommendations differently. Rather than
merely address the three irregularities referred to above, they gave notice of the

Bank’s multiple violations of law. The Recommendations read, in part, as follows:?3?

This admonition is issued for the following reasons:

1. Performance of banking activity in breach of the regulations, resulting in
irregularities in the system, including the risk

system and the internal control system, including in particular the following:
1.1. Article 70 sec. of the Act entitled Banking Law of 29 August 1997 — failure
to perform an assessment of the debtor’s creditworthiness, and granting a loan
to a client that is not credit worthy without implementing detailed measures of
securing loan repayment or presenting a business recovery plan whose
performance would — in the bank’s opinion — ensure achievement of
creditworthiness within the specified time period.

  

1.2. KNF’s Resolution No. 258/2011 of 4 October 2011 in terms of lack of the
following:

1.2.1. analysis of the impact of interest rate changes on the capital’s economic
value for the bank’s portfolio - which amounts to breach of § 13 sec. 7 of the
resolution,

1.2.2. adjustment of the system of internal limits to the scale and complexity of
conducted operations — which amounts to breach of § 17 sec. 1 of the
resolution,

1.2.3. assessment of operational efficiency of the internal audit unit — which
amounts to breach of § 41 sec. 2 of the resolution,

1.2.4. review of the internal capital estimation process in 2012 — which
amounts to breach of § 51 sec. 1 of the resolution.

1.3. KNF’s Resolution No. 386/2008 of 17 December 2008 in terms of taking
into account in:

1.3.1. the basic and supplementary provision — the liquidity of commercial
papers, despite lack of market analyses confirming the accepted estimates of
their value — which amounts to breach of § 6 sec. 4 of the resolution,

1.3.2. the basic liquidity provision — the State Treasury bonds designated to be
traded according to nominal price — not in the amount attainable in 7 days —
which amounts to breach of § 1 item 4 of Attachment no. 1 to the resolution.
1.4. Attachment no. 1 item 5 of the Finance Minister’s Regulation of 27 January
2011 in the matter of requirements for the calculation systems kept in the
entities subject to the mandatory guarantees system — the Bank Guarantee
Fund’s calculation system was not included in critical applications.

 

 

1.5. Act of 16 November 2000 on Combating Money Laundering and Financing
Terrorism in the scope of the following:

The

1.5.1. lack of periodic verification of assessment of the measures related to
prevention of money laundering and financing terrorism — which amounts to
breach of Article 8b sec. 3 of the act,

1.5.2. failure to send information on a timely basis to the General Inspector of
Financial Information — which amounts to breach of Article 12 sec. 2 item 1 of
the act.

1.6. Finance Minister’s Regulation of 21 September 2001 in the matter

of defining a model transaction register, the manner of keeping it and the
procedure for delivering data from the register to the General Inspector of
Financial Information — in terms of erroneous and untimely recording of data in
the transaction register - which amounts to breach of § 2 sec. 2 of the
regulation.

2. Failure to implement the recommendations related to asset quality, market
risk and capital adequacy issued by KNF on 25 March 2013 after a
comprehensive inspection conducted in FM_ Bank SA (letter
DIB/SPK/7110/125/16/2012/2013/MG) concerning, among other things, the
following:

2.1. analysis of revenues and costs incurred by clients applying for loans as part
of the express offer, including in particular analysis of revenues and costs
incurred by clients,

2.2. periodic verification of the applicants’ representations on the amount of
income, on the basis of an adequate sample,

2.3. review of the client economic and financial standing at least once a year,
2.4. development of stress tests designated for estimation of change of the
Bank’s economic value, assuming a sudden and unexpected interest rate
change by 200 business points,

2.5. acceptance of assumptions for stress tests that take into consideration the
Bank’s activities related to deposits and credits and which ensure adequate risk
assessment,

2.6. formalizing the rules for conducting stress tests implemented in the capital
planning process.

Further, a bank is required to respond in accordance with a strict time-frame.?*> First,
a bank must, within one month of receiving the recommendations, provide the KNF a
detailed schedule of the tasks required in order to implement them, specifying dates
and manner of execution of the tasks as well as the persons directly responsible for
their execution and the relevant Board bers. A bank’s

board must furnish the KNF quarterly progress reports by the end of the month
following the end of the relevant quarter.236

In fact, the KNF took no further action against the Bank.

KNF Measures against Claimant

(i) The First KNF Decision

Six days after making its recommendation to the FM Bank PBP, the KNF, on 8 April
2014, issued a decision (“First KNF Decision”) addressed to PL Holdings and Abris-EMP
suspending their voting rights as shareholders of FM Bank PBP and requiring PL
Holdings to sell all of its shares in the Bank by 31 December 2014.73”

The KNF based its ban on the exercise of voting rights on Article 25n, paragraph 1, of

the Banking Act, authorizing imposition of such a ban:

Where this is justified by the requirement of prudent and stable management
of a domestic bank, in view of assessment of the financial standing of an entity,
including the founder of a domestic bank, which has obtained, directly or

236 | etter from the KNF) to FM Bank PBP, 2 Apr. 2014, p. 28 (Exh. C-171). The Recommendations state that failure to implement
them may lead the KNF to impose certain supervisory measures provided for in Article 138, Section 3, and Article 141,
Section 1 of the Banking Act. Id.

indirectly, the right to exercise votes at a general meeting at levels specified in
Art. 25, para. 1, or has become, directly or indirectly a domestic bank’s parent
company, due to possible impact of this entity on the bank, in particular, when
it is proved that the entity fails to respect the commitments referred to in Art.
25h, para. 3, or the commitments referred to in Art. 30, para. 1b.738

188. Article 25n, paragraph 4, goes on to provide that “in the case of the decision referred
to in para. 1, the Polish Financial Supervision Authority may, by way of decision, order
disposal of shares within the time fixed.”

189. The KNF based its conclusion that PL Holdings and Abris-EMP “acting through their
representatives on the Supervisory Board of FM Bank PBP, have exerted an adverse
impact on the Bank’s sound and prudent management” on the following findings: 229

e the Supervisory Board made changes to the Management Board’s composition
that created serious legal and operational risks

e the Supervisory Board issued binding instructions on matters within the
competence of the Management Board

e the Supervisory Board had the Bank enter into service agreements with the
acting President of the Management Board and a law firm co-owned by a
member of the Supervisory Board

e the Supervisory Board failed to comply with the obligations in relation to the
composition of the Management Board

190. The changes to which the KNF objected included (a) dismissal of Mr. Staficzuk from

the Bank’s Management Board, (b) resignation of Mr. Lejko and Mr. Zielke from the

 

Bank’s Board, (c) resi; ion of Mr. iej ki as President of the
Bank’s Management Board and his appointment as First Vice-President, and (d)
appointment of Mr. Lachowski as member of the Bank’s Management Board and

entrusting him with the duties of the President of the Board.

PL Holdings claims that, by the time of the First KNF Decision, certain of the KNF’s
concerns had already been addressed. Thus, Mr. Fabrycki had resigned from the
Supervisory Board, as of 1 March 2014,74° and by 25 March 2014, the Bank had
changed its loan decision process to confine the Supervisory Board’s role in that
process. These changes were made prior to the KNF’s issuance of its Post-Inspection
Recommendations on 2 April 2014.

On 9 April 2014, the day following issuance of the First KNF Decision, the KNF invited
members of the Supervisory Board of FM Bank PBP to a meeting on 11 April 2014.744
At that meeting (attended by Mr. Bieske, Mr. Boksa, Mr. Gieryrfiski and Mr. Stepniak
for the Bank and by Mr. Kwasniak, Mr. Parys and several other officials for the KNF),
the KNF delivered to the Supervisory Board members a letter detailing the failures by
the Board of its obligations.?42

According to Mr. Stepniak, he was prohibited by Mr. Kwasniak from recording the
meeting,?“? even though, in Mr. Stepniak’s opinion, he had the right to do so.2“ Also
according to Mr. Stepniak, Mr. Kwasniak insisted that there was no requirement that a
minority shareholder be involved in the proceedings.”“>

On the same day, however, the KNF formally discontinued the receivership

proceedings, as placing the Bank in receivership was unwarranted:

Analysis of the evidentiary material gathered during the pending
administrative proceeding, the progress in the execution of the Remedial Plan
giving consideration to the Bank’s economic standing and the findings of the
comprehensive inspection conducted in the Bank according to its status as at
30 June 2013 do not point to material deviations from executing the objectives
and assumptions adopted by the Bank and laid down in the Remedial Plan.
Accordingly, a receiver in the FM Bank PBP SA would be groundless and
pointless.?46

Respondent maintains that there is no contradiction between the KNF’s adoption of
the First KNF Decision, on the one hand, and its termination of the receivership
proceedings against the Bank, on the other. It explains that, while the Bank’s
Supervisory Board was adversely affecting the management of the Bank (thus
requiring issuance of the First KNF Decision), the Bank was not deviating from

execution of the remedial plan (thus obviating the need for a receivership).247

 

PL Holdings and Abris-EMP pursued two remedies against the First KNF Decision.
First, on 18 April 2014, PL Holdings and Abris-EMP requested repeal of the Decision,
citing Article 25n, paragraph 6, of the Banking Act?4? and asserting that “the

Bank reported on 29 April 2014 that no loans would thereafter be granted without the
Management Board’s approval and that the Management Board would no longer be
required to obtain the Supervisory Board’s consent to deviate from financing rules.?>+
That letter also reiterated the Bank’s undertaking that it would no longer enter into
service contracts with entities related to Management or Supervisory Board
members.?>2 The Bank thus certified to the KNF that the latter’s Post-Inspection
Recommendations had been fully implemented.

On 11 July 2014, the KNF stated that the request for repeal of the First KNF Decision
was premature and should be withdrawn because, while the decision was a final
administrative decision, it was still subject to appeal and therefore not “a final
decision within the meaning of the Code of Administrative Procedure.”2>3 The KNF

confirmed this position by a decision of 18 July 2014.754

(ii) The Second KNF Decision

On 24 April 2014, PL Holdings and Abris-EMP applied to the KNF for reconsideration of
the First KNF Decision on the basis of the Decision’s alleged invalidity.2°> In a decision
of 24 July 2014 (“Second KNF Decision”), the KNF partially affirmed and partially

overturned the First KNF Decision. It affirmed the First KNF Decision’s ban on PL

basis of an employment contract and that Mr. Fabrycki had resigned from the Bank’s Supervisory Board.

Holdings’ exercise of voting rights, but overturned the order to PL Holdings to sell all
of its shares in FM Bank PBP by 31 December 2014.

In support of its affirmance of the voting rights ban in the Second KNF Decision, the
KNF did not mention the specific irregularities that it had identified in the course of its
inspection of the Bank in November 2013 and on which it had based the First KNF
Decision. Rather, the KNF found that PL Holdings and Abris-EMP had failed in their
obligations to “carefully select persons for managerial positions, with a special focus
on experience in the banking sector and skills in banking risk management, and [to]
consult with KNF [on] the filling of positions of management board members and the
Bank’s chief accountant.”25° The Decision explained that, since the KNF’s approval of
the Bank’s remedial plan in June 2013 was based on the listing of the Management
Board members at that time, the subsequent changes that the Supervisory Board

made to the ition of the Board a breach of the
conditions of the KNF’s approval of the remedial plan.?5”

In support of overturning the order to PL Holdings to sell its shares in the Bank by 31
December 2014, the Second KNF Decision cited a procedural rule according to which
the KNF could adopt such a drastic order only after first having imposed a less severe

one. Thus, the voting rights ban and the order to sell the shares could not be ordered

at the same time.?°* The KNF explained:

Repealing the decision in the part relating to the order to dispose of the bank’s
shares is connected exclusively with formal and legal issues and does not
change the fact that PL Holdings s.a.r.I. and Abris-EMP Capital Partners Limited
did not meet their investor commitments towards the KNF, which, in the KNF’s
opinion, had a negative influence on the prudent and stable operations of the
bank.
When taking the decision, the KNF was guided by the need to limits its legal risk.
Issuing both decisi h idently iled an additional risk of litigation.?°°
Thus, by its own account, the KNF repealed its order to PL Holdings to sell its shares in
the Bank for purely procedural reasons and without prejudice to reopening those
proceedings. In fact, within one day the KNF recommenced proceedings which
eventually led, on 18 November 2014 to a forced sale order.?©°
On 22 September 2014, PL Holdings applied to the KNF for suspension of the
prohibition on the exercise of voting rights in the FM Bank PBP.2*? The KNF denied the
request on 22 September 2014.7
During the time that PL Holdings was pursuing these remedies, there remained the
matter of Mr. Lachowski’s appointment as CEO of FM Bank PBP and President of the
Bank’s Management Board. As noted,” on 8 August 2013, the Supervisory Board had

appointed Mr. Lachowski, subject to KNF approval, as acting President of the Bank’s

Management Board. The Bank then collected and on 4 September 2013 submitted to

 

The administrative decision ordering the sale of all the FM Bank PBP shares was issued simultaneously
with the decision prohibiting the exercise of the voting rights. In so doing, the authority failed to realize
that, in the prevailing circumstances, it did not have the competence to order the sale of the shares.

the KNF the application materials as required by Article 22b, paragraph 1, of the
Banking Act.?* According to the relevant provisions of the Banking Act, approval of a
candidate for appointment as president of the management board of a bank could be
denied on only certain specified grounds. The individual must:
e have been convicted of a fiscal offence, or
e have been found responsible for documented losses at his or her place of
employment, or
e have been prohibited from performing business activities, or
e have failed to guarantee the sound and prudent management of a bank or to
have not been adequately educated.7®>
On 9 October 2013, the KNF inquired further as to why Mr. Maciejewski had resigned
as President of the Management Board of the Bank and why Mr. Lachowski had been
appointed as President of the Management Board prior to receiving the KNF’s consent
to that appointment.2 Then, on 21 October 2013, Mr. Boksa reiterated the
explanations he had given in a 27 August 2013 letter to the KNF.2°”
There then followed a series of notices by the KNF to the Bank reporting extensions of
the deadline for deciding on the Bank’s application for Mr. Lachowski’s approval.
Thus, on 31 October 2013, the KNF extended the deadline to 20 December 2013, citing
a need to further examine Mr. Lachowski’s banking sector experience.? On 10

December 2013, the deadline was further extended to 28 February 2014, the stated

reason being that the KNF was awaiting the results of the KNF’s inspection of the FM

Respondent maintains that the KNF’s process for reviewing Mr. Lachowski’s
appointment was not a dilatory one. It claims that the length of time required was
due to various concerns raised by Mr. Lachowski’s activity in the banking sector over
the years. For example, some of the consumer loan contract clauses used by a bank
(the BRE Bank) of which Mr. Lachowski was CEO and President of the Management
Board were subsequently found to be abusive, and that bank was sued by clients in a
well-publicised class action lawsuit.2”2, According to Mr. Kwaéniak, the KNF found it
necessary to examine Mr. Lachowski’s entire career working in financial institutions,
and given the length of his service in that sector, the process was necessarily time-

consuming.?73

273 Kwasniak ws, pp. 8-9:

The KNF had to examine a series of issues associated with the candidate, inter alia, his experience, years
in service, career in financial institutions so far and professional record in PBP Bank and after the merger.
We were also aware that since 2008 Mr. Lachowski has not fulfilled any functions in the management
boards of companies in the banking sector. The KNF examined his activity associated with foreign
currency loans granted by the bank managed by him previously, the number of suits filed by clients of the
bank he was leading; how the post-inspection recommendations in the area of money laundering were
implemented in the bank he was leading; his behaviour as a member of the Supervisory Board of Meritum
Bank covered by the recovery plan, including the reasons of termination of his cooperation with Meritum
Bank. All those activities took time.

Respondent also suggests that the abruptness with which Mr. Lachowski left the Presidency of Meritum Bank's
Supervisory Board was a cause of concern. Letter from Meritum to the KNF, 17 June 2014 (Exh. R-24), in which Mr.
Lachowski’s successor as President of the Meritum Bank’s Supervisory Board seriously criticized the manner of Mr.
Lachowski’s departure from Meritum Bank. See Statement of Defence, para. 149.

208.

209.

On 14 May 2014, the KNF finally interviewed Mr. Lachowski as witness in the
proceedings over his appointment. Present at the interview, in addition to Mr.
Lachowski, were Mr. Stepniak and Mr. Gieryfiski, as well as FM Bank PBP’s General
Counsel. According to the minutes of the meeting, the questioning revolved around
the legal form of Mr. Lachowski’s relationship with the Bank.?”* On the following day,
the KNF probed further into the form of cooperation between Mr. Lachowski and the
Bank, focusing on the identity of the persons who negotiated the terms and conditions
of Mr. Lachowski’s employment and on the legal opinions received by the Supervisory
Board in determining the lawfulness of the pair of agreements between Mr. Lachowski
and the Bank.?”> Although the Supervisory Board believed that it had already much
earlier supplied this information to the KNF, it provided the documents and other
information requested.?”° Following this exchange, on 30 May 2014, the KNF extended
once again the deadline for acting upon Mr. Lachowski’s application to 8 July 2014,
citing its need for information from third-party institutions.2””

Aggrieved by the KNF’s actions, the Supervisory Board of the FM Bank PBP on 17 June
2014 petitioned the KNF to remedy the harm done in delaying action on Mr.
Lachowski’s appointment.2”?_ Filing a petition of this sort is admittedly a prerequisite

administrative court.?”° Then, on 22 July 2014, approximately eleven months following
the application’s filing, the KNF finally approved Mr. Lachowski’s appointment as
President of the Management Board of the FM Bank PBP.2®° The decision was taken
by a vote of 3-2, with Mr. Jakubiak and Mr. Kwasniak, KNF Chairman and Vice-
Chairman, respectively, in the minority.27°*
As noted,”®? in its Second Decision, the KNF overturned the order to PL Holdings to sell
its shares on the ground that that very severe order could not be imposed at the same
time as the less severe sanction of a loss of voting rights. However, the KNF evidently
considered it unnecessary to wait any length of time between issuing successively an
order banning the exercise of voting rights and an order commencing proceedings
with a view to compelling the sale of shares:
Although it may occur — which the lawmaker himself does not exclude — that
both administrative resolutions under analysis are issued by the regulatory
authority on the same date, these administrative decisions may in no way be
treated as the same from the legal point of view, and should be treated as
autonomous and separate acts.2°
(iii) | The Third KNF Decision

On 25 July 2014, only one day after issuing the Second KNF Decision, the KNF

instituted further proceedings against PL Holdings in contemplation of an eventual

order to PL Holdings requiring its sale of shares.?®4 According to PL Holdings, KNF
already made it clear to PL Holdings’ representatives at a 31 July 2014 meeting that
the KNF intended to issue an order compelling PL Holdings to sell its shareholding in
FM Bank PBP.25 To PL Holdings, the outcome of the proceeding initiated on 25 July
2014 was thus predetermined.?®

Finally, on 18 November 2014, the KNF issued a decision (“Third KNF Decision”)
ordering PL Holdings to sell all of its shares in FM Bank PBP by 30 April 2015.78” This
Decision was adopted on the basis of a 3-2 vote among KNF representatives, with one
representative abstaining.?®° In the Third KNF Decision, the KNF reiterated that the
August 2013 Management Board changes made by the Supervisory Board constituted
a violation of PL Holdings’ commitment “to consult the KNF on the filling of positions
on the management board and the chief accountant of the Bank.”28° Somewhat
peculiarly, the KNF cited in further justification of the Third KNF Decision the fact that
PL Holdings could not exercise its voting rights, a sanction that the KNF itself had
imposed.?°°

On this occasion, unlike on the occasion of the Second KNF Decision, the KNF relied

upon the same irregularities that it had identified in the course of its inspection of the

284 KNF notification to PL Holdings of the commencement of an administrative proceeding to issue an order to sell
the shares in FM Bank PBP, 25 July 2014 (Exh. C-220).

Decision appears to ignore the fact that by the end of August 2014, all the KNF’s Post-

Inspection Recommendations relating to those irregularities had been rectified.

I. Claimant’s Resort to Judicial Remedies

There is apparent agreement between the Parties that it is only after the KNF had
issued the Second KNF Decision that PL Holdings was entitled to appeal to a court of
law. On 25 August 2014 — before the KNF rendered its Third KNF Decision on 18
November 2014 —- PL Holdings and Abris-EMP filed a complaint in the Regional
Administrative Court in Warsaw challenging the First KNF Decision’s prohibition on PL
Holdings’ exercise of voting rights and the part of the Second KNF Decision upholding
that ruling,2°2- On 4 February 2015, the Regional Administrative Court refused to
suspend performance of the Second KNF Decision.”

On 13 March 2015, PL Holdings and Abris-EMP (by then renamed Abris Fund 1)
appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court against the lower court’s refusal to
suspend enforcement of the Second KNF Decision.?** On 29 May 2015, the Supreme

Administrative Court dismissed the appeal.?°>

295 statement of Claim, para. 247. By the time PL Holdings filed its Statement of Claim in this proceeding on 7
August 2015, the Supreme Administrative Court had not yet formally issued this 29 May 2015 ruling with a
statement of reasons.

85

216.

217.

By this time, PL Holdings had already on 3 December 2014 filed a motion with the KNF
for reconsideration of the Third KNF Decision, which required PL Holdings to sell its
shares in FM Bank PBP by 30 April 2015, alleging that Decision’s invalidity.2°° Under
Polish administrative law, the filing of such a motion for reconsideration to the KNF
and its denial by the KNF is a prerequisite to filing a challenge in the Regional
Administrative Court.?97

PL Holdings’ access to the Regional Administrative Court in relation to the Third KNF
Decision thus had to await a ruling by the KNF on PL Holdings’ request for
reconsideration of the Third KNF Decision. The KNF’s ruling on the motion was long in
coming. On 28 December 2014, the KNF, citing the complexity of the case, postponed
its deadline for issuance of the ruling until 4 March 2015.7°8 Then, on 2 March 2015,
the KNF, citing the need for further study of the Bank’s financial situation, further
postponed its deadline for issuance of the ruling until 30 April 2015.2°° Thus, the KNF
extended its deadline for issuing its ruling on reconsideration to the very date by
which PL Holdings had been ordered to sell its shares. Even then, however, in 27 April
2015, the KNF, citing a need for more thorough analysis, extended the deadline once
more, until 23 June 2015.2 The 23 June deadline was extended still again on 22 June
2015 until 2 September 2015. By this time, PL Holdings (along with Mr. Stepniak) had

already -- on 30 April 2015 — sold its shareholdings in FM Bank PBP to Porto Group

Holdings Limited (“Porto Group”), an affiliate of AnaCap Financial Partners III LP
(“AnaCap”).2°? The KNF gave as its reason for the latest extension the need to analyze

PL Holdings’ sale agreement with Porto Group.

J. Claimant’s Sale of its FM Bank PBP Shares

Throughout this period, PL Holdings took the position that — because the Third KNF
Decision was still in effect and was immediately enforceable — it was bound by that
Decision to sell its shareholdings by 30 April 2015.39? According to PL Holdings, it
understood that, under Article 25n, paragraph 5, of the Banking Act, failure by PL
Holdings to execute the order by the date prescribed would expose it to
administrative sanctions in the form of a fine of as much as PLN 10 million
(approximately € 2.5 million at the current exchange rate), as well as to placement of

the Bank in receivership, r ‘ion of its license, and liquidation? PL
Holdings maintains that, in light of what it regarded as the KNF’s drastic actions up to
that point, it had real reason to fear that those measures might in fact be imposed.2%

Respondent, however, takes the position that Claimant was not in fact under an

immediate obligation to dispose of its shares in the Bank pursuant to the Third KNF

Decision because, under Polish law, that Decision is not enforceable as long as a

motion for reconsideration is pending.*°° In its view, Claimant’s sale of its shares was
accordingly voluntary.
On 28 April 2014, by which time the KNF had issued the First KNF decision, compelling
sale of the shares, Abris-EMP informed the KNF of PL Holdings’ intention to sell its
shares in FM Bank PBP.2°° To that end, Abris invited proposals from financial advisers
for preparation of a vendor due diligence report (“VDD Report”), ultimately selecting

the KNF to be executed by no later than 31 December 2014.3 The date set for ial
offers was the end of July 2014.3

On 21 July 2014, PL Holdings and Abris-EMP informed the KNF that they had initiated
discussions with interested investors and provided a provisional timeline.??° The next

day, PL Holdings requested a meeting with the KNF to furnish additional details and

answer any questions the KNF might have, and a meeting was contemplated for 31

July 2014.341 However, on 24 July 2014, the KNF issued the Second KNF Decision that
overturned the order to PL Holdings to sell its shares in FM Bank PBP.

222. By the time of the scheduled 31 July 2014 meeting, the KNF had, as noted,?’? re-
instituted proceedings 25 July 2014 with a view to issuance of an order compelling
sale by PL Holdings of its FM Bank PBP shares. According to PL Holdings, at the
meeting, the KNF indicated that it still intended to require PL Holdings’ sale of its
shares.313_ At the meeting, PL Holdings reaffirmed its game plan and schedule for
selling the shares, identifying to the KNF the identity of interested investors.?* At that
point, the KNF expressed disfavor of a sale of the shares to private equity funds,?*° as
well as concern over certain potential investors that KNF regarded as insufficiently
experienced.?1©

223. PL Holdings thus continued to pursue sale of the shares by the stated deadline of 31
December 2014 laid down in the First KNF Decision.?!” The deadline for the sale was
postponed to 30 April 2015 only on 18 November 2014, when the Third KNF Decision
was issued. On 13 August 2014, PL Holdings and Abris-EMP gave the KNF a shortened
list of potential investors, namely, those that had signed confidentiality agreements in

possibly be taken even within approx. two weeks. They did not specify when the order to sell the shares would be

issued, but the starting point is to be 31 December 2014.

relation to the sale.34® The list of fourteen included three banks, five private equity
funds, and six other investors. Ultimately, six of them delivered non-binding offers.
These included: (a) Alior Bank S.A. (“Alior Bank”), (b) AnaCap, (c) Bank Ochrony
Srodowiska S.A. (“BOS”), (d) JRJ Group, (e) Lone Star Fund IX (US) LP, Lone Star Fund IX
(Bermuda) LP, Lone Star Fund IX Parallel (Bermuda) LP (“Lone Star Funds”), and (f) Mr.
Michael Solowow, though the last one eventually withdrew. On 4 September 2014, PL
Holdings and Abris-EMP informed the KNF of the five remaining non-binding offers,
indicated that the due diligence processes of all five would begin on 8 September
2014, and asked the KNF whether it had objections to any of the five.*4? Thereafter
two additional investors - OTP Bank (“OTP Bank”) and Euro Bank S.A. (“Euro Bank”) —
entered the competition, and PL Holdings so informed the KNF.22° By then, the
deadline for completion of due diligence had been reset at 29 October 2014 and the
deadline for submission of binding offers had been reset at 3 November 2014.321

Ultimately, binding offers were submitted by four among the group — Alior Bank, BOS,
OTP Bank, and AnaCap — and PL Holdings and Abris-EMP so informed the KNF.222 By
26 November 2014, PL Holdings had in hand binding offers from Alior Bank, BOS, and

225. In early 2015, while Alior Bank and AnaCap pursued their due diligence and prepared
new offers, the KNF launched an “Asset Quality Review (“AQR”) of FM Bank PBP.22°
The AQR is a method for assessing the value of a bank’s assets introduced by the

European Central Bank in response to the financial crisis, to be performed by national

 

banking authorities.?2” No Polish bank figured on the ini list of 124 European banks
on which the ECB was to conduct an AQR. And when, on 6 March 2014, the KNF
identified the selected banks operating in Poland for which an AQR would be
performed starting in April 2014, the FM Bank PBP was not among them.?”85 The 15
banks chosen were ones that were considered to be “systematically-significant,” that
were listed, or that quoted WIBOR/WIBID rates, and they accounted for 79% of the
total commercial bank assets in Poland. The results were published on 26 October
2014.29

226. On 27 January 2015, the KNF informed FM Bank PBP that it was to the subject of a
new AQR, and demanded that certain data be produced for that purpose by mid-

February.?2° On the next day, the Management Board of the Bank requested an

extension of the deadline for the production of documents, due to the effort that their
collection entailed, and the request was granted.??4
At this time, sale negotiations with AnaCap and Alior Bank were ongoing. In February

2015, AnaCap offered a higher purchase price than any other company,*2 and on that

 

basis, on 24 February 2015, PL Holdings granted it exclusivity, until 25 March 2015,333

 

following which, on 11 March 2015, Alior Bank withdrew. On 25 February 2015, the
day after granting AnaCap exclusivity, PL holdings and Abris-EMP so informed the
KNF.334 When on 18 March 2015, PL Holding extended AnaCap’s exclusivity to 3 April
2015, PL Holdings likewise so informed the KNF.32>

By 2 April 2015, the structure of the sale and purchase agreement with AnaCap had
been determined and was communicated to the KNF.32° Claimant pointed out that
AnaCap, like the other potential investors, had insisted that certain Receivable Claims
(“the Warsaw Receivables”) were carved out of the Bank’s assets as part of the deal.
In its 17 April 2015 reply, the KNF did not yet take a position on the purchase and sale
transaction.33”

The AQR procedure concerning FM Bank PBP concluded on 6 March 2015 and on 10
April 2015, KNF representatives informed the Bank’s Management Board of the KNF’s

preliminary findings. According to those findings, FM Bank PBP needed to undergo

asset impairment adjustments of approximately PLN 69 million.23® According to PL
Holdings, the coincidence in time between the final AQR report and the deadline for
the sale of the Bank shares meant that the preliminary AQR findings had to be
provided to AnaCap.?°?

On 17 April 2015, the same day on which the KNF replied to PL Holdings’ 2 April 2015
letter communicating the draft purchase and sale agreement with AnaCap, without
taking a position on the transaction, PL Holdings received a revised and drastically

reduced offer from AnaCap. AnaCap had lowered its purchase offer from PLN 100

 

million (net) to PLN 30 million, thus by PLN 70 million, an amount largely

 

corresponding to the asset impairment adjustment that had been announced by the
KNF.34°

According to PL Holdings, at that late date — less than two weeks prior to the 30 April
2015 sale deadline — PL Holdings had no choice but to go through with the deal.24+
Thus, on 30 April 2015, even without having received any approval or disapproval of
the transaction by the KNF, PL Holdings executed a sale and purchase agreement
(“SPA”) with Porto Group Holdings Limited, an AnaCap affiliate, on AnaCap’s new and
dramatically less favorable terms.42, Moreover, AnaCap had refused to agree to PL

Holdings’ proposal that it be entitled to terminate the SPA in the event that the KNF,

232. On 24 April 2015, PL Holdings wrote to the KNF complaining about the timing of the
AQR and the harm caused to PL Holding in its negotiations for the sale of FM Bank PBP
shares.34

233. The sale transaction closed on 8 October 2015 and the KNF was notified on the
following day.245

234. However, the final AQR report contained no requirement that the Bank provide for
any particular exposure.*“° Basically, it ordered the Bank to review a specific loan
agreement, which the Bank then did, resulting in a decision to make provision in an
amount of only PLN 5 million.247 According to PL Holdings, “the damage caused by the
KNF’s deliberate timing of the AQR process and the KNF’s preliminary report of an
additional PLN 69 million provision (which ultimately was not required) had been
done and it was irreversible.”34*

235. As noted, on 21 October 2016, the Regional Administrative Court in Warsaw issued a

ruling dismissing the Claimant’s and Abris’ challenge to the Second KNF Decision.

THE CLAIM

The Tribunal sets out here the basic assertions of Claimant on jurisdiction, applicable

law, claims on the merits, and the relief requested.

. Jurisdiction

The Claimant bases the jurisdiction of this Tribunal on the Treaty between the Polish
People’s Republic, on the one hand, and the Kingdom of Belgium and the Government
of the Grand-Duchy of Luxembourg, on the other, regarding the Encouragement and
the Reciprocal Protection of Investments (“the Treaty”), which was concluded in
Warsaw on 19 May 1987 in three equally authentic languages: French, Dutch and
Polish.349 The Polish Council of State ratified the Treaty on 18 February 1988.3°° The
Parties to the Treaty exchanged instruments of ratification in Brussels on 2 July
1991,35! and the Treaty entered into force on 2 August 1991. The record in the case
contains a translation into English of each language version.?>2

In concluding the Treaty, Poland has agreed that covered disputes between Poland
and an investor of Luxembourg nationality may be submitted to arbitration under the
Treaty.

The Claimant has met the following conditions laid down in Article 9 of the Treaty,

according to which:

241.

a) The disputes between one of the Contracting Parties and an investor of the
other Contracting Party shall be subject to a written notification accompanied
by a detailed memorandum sent by said investor to the relevant Contracting
Party.

b) Within the meaning of this Article, the term “dispute” refers to the disputes
with regard to the expropriation, nationalization, or any other similar
measures that affect the investments, and in particular, the transfer of an
investment to public ownership, putting it under public supervision, as well as
any other deprivation or restriction of rights in rem by sovereign measures that
might entail consequences that are similar to those of expropriation.

Said disputes shall, as much as possible, be settled amicably between the two

parties involved.

¢,

With respect to notification, on 19 May 2014, Claimant sent Respondent a written
notification of the dispute, with specific reference to talks aimed at its amicable
resolution.?*? Claimant asserts that Respondent rejected Claimant’s offer to pursue
amicable settlement in a letter of 18 November 2014.3°* Claimant accordingly, on 26
November 2014, submitted a request for arbitration to the Arbitration Institute of the
Stockholm Chamber of Commerce.

Claimant asserts that it is an “investor” having made an “investment,” within the
meaning of the Treaty. The Treaty, in Article 1.1 defines an “investment” as “any kind
of asset,” specifically including “shares of stock and other forms of investment
interests in companies.” From 1 December 2010, Claimant owned shares in FM Bank
PBP and its predecessor PBP Bank. It is undisputed that this shareholding constitutes

an investment.

242. The Treaty makes the presence of an “investor’ dependent on its nationality.
Claimant was incorporated on 15 January 2010 under the laws of Luxembourg and
registered under Luxembourg law on 3 February 2010.*°> It has its head office and

makes its essential business decisions at 5 Rue Guillaume Kroll, 1882 Luxembourg.

B. Applicable Law

243. According to Article 9(5) of the Treaty:

The arbitral organization shall make its award on the basis:

-- of the national law of the Contracting Party that is a party to the dispute, in
the territory of which the investment is located, including the rules regarding
conflict of laws;

-- the provisions stipulated in this Treaty;

-- the terms of any special commitment that might have been made regarding
the investment;

-- the generally accepted rules and principles of international law.

(i) The Treaty and International Law

244. Claimant urges in particular that, despite the fact that national law is first mentioned,
it is the Treaty provisions and international law that should predominate in the
analysis.35°

245. Insofar as expropriation is concerned, the Treaty provides in Article 4(1):

The investments made by investors of one of the Contracting Parties in the
territory of the other Contracting party may be expropriated or subject to

247.

other measures of direct or indirect dispossession that have a similar effect
only if the following conditions are met:

(a) the measures are adopted in the public interest and in accordance with
due process;

(b) they are neither discriminatory nor contrary to a special commitment as
stipulated in Article 7, paragraph 2.; and

(c) they are ied by provisi that sti the pay of
compensation.

 

The Treaty defines neither “expropriation” nor “dispossession,” nor does it indicate
what would constitute a “similar” direct or indirect effect. For this and other reasons,
reference may be made to Article 31 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties,
according to which “[a] treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the
ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the
light of its object and purpose.” Claimant maintains that the concept of
“dispossession” is wider than that of “expropriation.”35”

Claimant further asserts that, to establish expropriation, an investor need not show an
improper motive or intent on the host State’s part, and that the fact that a measure
serves a public purpose does not immunize it from being considered an
expropriation.*** Further, an expropriation need not take the form of a direct physical
taking, but may consist of a forced transfer of the investor’s assets or an interference
in management or enjoyment of assets so extreme as to deprive the investor of their

use or enjoyment.3°?

(ii) European Union Law

248. Claimant suggests that, as part of international law, the law of the European Union is
applicable in the present case.*® In addition to serving as the framework in which
supervision of financial institutions by competent Member State authorities is
conducted, European law embraces a principle of proportionality. In that regard,
Claimant cites Article 65 of Directive 2013/36/EU, which requires that sanctions
imposed by national banking authorities be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive.”
Further Article 70 states as follows:

Art. 70. Effective application of penalties and exercise of powers to impose
penalties by competent authorities.

Member States shall ensure that when determining the type of administrative
penalties or other administrative measures and the level of administrative
pecuniary penalties, the competent authorities shall take into account all
relevant circumstances, including, where appropriate:

(i) the gravity and duration of the breach;

(ii) the degree of responsibility of the natural or legal person

responsible for the breach;

the financial strength of the natural or legal person responsible

for the breach, as indicated, for example, by the total turnover

of a legal person or the annual income of a natural person;

(iv) the importance of profits gained or losses avoided by the natural
or legal person responsible for the breach, insofar as they can be
determined;

(v) the losses for third parties caused by the breach, insofar as they
can be determined;

(vi) the level of cooperation of the natural or legal person
responsible for the breach with the competent authority;

(vii) | previous breaches the natural or legal person responsible for the
breach;

(viii) any potential systemic consequences of the breach.

 

 

36° Statement of Claim, paras. 346-351.

Claimant observes that Directive 2013/36/EU also requires that the addressee of
supervisory measures taken by competent authorities be informed that it has a right of
appeal (art. 72) and a right of judicial recourse (art. 55). Claimant also cites various
procedural and substantive protections guaranteed by the European Convention of

Human Rights.2*+

(iii) Polish Law
249. Among the sources of Polish law that Claimant finds relevant to the present case are

the Polish Constitution,?® the Act on Financial Market Supervision,*® the Polish

 

Banking Act,?°* the Act on Proceedings before Administrative Courts,?°> Act of 5

 

December 2014 amending the Act on Trading in Financial Instruments and Certain
Other Acts,3® the Code of Administrative Proceedings,**” and KNF Resolution no.
312/2012 of 27 November 2012 (on bank inspections).?°

250. Claimant also invokes the principle of proportionality in Polish administrative and

constitutional law.?® It cites, in addition, numerous decisions of the Polish courts.

Claimant maintains that Poland is responsible, as a matter of international law, for the
conduct of the KNF.37°

Claimant further claims that Poland’s conduct constitutes an illegal expropriation
within the meaning of the Treaty and applicable principles of international law.
According to it, neither the order depriving PL Holdings of its voting rights in FM Bank
PBP, nor the order to PL Holdings to sell its shares in FM Bank PBP, satisfies the
conditions for lawful expropriation within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the Treaty.372

In support of this contention, Claimant seeks to show that the orders referred to in
the preceding paragraph effectively deprive Claimant of its investment by depriving it
of the economic use and enjoyment of the investment.?”? Because it was barred from
voting at the Bank’s general shareholders’ meeting, Claimant has been prevented
from, among other things, approving FM Bank PBP’s financial statements in violation
of Polish accountancy law, making changes in the composition of the Bank’s
Supervisory Board, approving the Bank’s issuance of bonds, injecting new capital into
the Bank, and retaining employees. It also could not effectively execute the Banks’
remedial plan.

Claimant asserts that the orders in question also precipitated a significant withdrawal

of deposits?”? and prevented it from pursuing valuable business opportunities.?”4

Ultimately, in Claimant’s view, the KNF’s actions compelled Claimant to make a forced
sale of its shares in FM Bank PBP, thus sustaining a loss of reasonably anticipated
profits that would have been made in a sale at a more opportune time.?”>

The measures taken by the KNF cannot, according to Claimant, be justified as
legitimate bona fide regulations because they were arbitrary, inappropriate, out of
proportion with the public purpose allegedly served, and not taken in good faith.?”°
With regard to proportionality, Claimant underscores the extreme severity of the
effect of the KNF’s measures on the Claimant and its investment in FM Bank PBP,
coupled with the availability to the KNF of less draconian measures.?”” To meet the
proportionality test, an adverse measure must be suitable for achieving a legitimate
aim, must be the least restrictive of available sanctions, and must present benefits
that outweigh its costs. Claimant maintains that, for a variety of reasons, none of the
three measures taken by the KNF meets any of these requirements, even assuming
they are in their nature rationally related to the KNF’s mission of ensuring the prudent
and stable management of the Bank.

As regards the orders’ suitability, Claimant calls attention to the fact, among others,
that the alleged irregularities did not in themselves breach any Polish banking law,
that Claimant ultimately satisfied all the obligations called to its attention by the KNF,
that none of the irregularities Claimant was accused of engaging in threatened the

Bank’s sound and prudent management, that the KNF exaggerated the number and

260.

seriousness of the alleged irregularities, and that the KNF approved the remedial plan
notwithstanding its objections to certain alleged irregularities. Claimant maintains in
particular that it properly and effectively rose to the challenge, following Mr.
Stariczuk’s unexpected departure from the Management Board, of bringing onboard a

person of the requisite skills, knowledge and experience who was able and wil

 

take charge of the Bank’s operations.?7°

Claimant’s witness, Dr. Kluza, former KNF chair, testified that:
| do not consider that any of those purported justifications demonstrate a
failure by PL holdings and Abris as majority shareholders, let alone one that
justified the adoption of severe measures against them under the Banking Act.

In particular, none of the reasons directly engaged the legal responsibility of
the majority shareholder ...379

Turning to the necessity of the measures imposed, Claimant observes that the KNF has
a broad range of administrative measures and penalties at its disposal under Polish
and EU law when it considers the prudent and stable management of a bank to be at
risk. An initial question is whether the KNF reasonably took the position that its
concerns could only be met by reinstating the Management Board as identified in the
remedial plan.28° Claimant points out that the KNF chose to address no supervisory
measures to the Management Board, but only the Supervisory Board, even though
many of the KNF’s grievances pertained to management of the bank.3#+

In his testimony, Dr. Kluza maintains that the Banking Act furnishes adequate

remedies far less drastic than those imposed, including imposing additional capital

requirements, suspending or discharging a member of the Management Board,

 

limiting the permissible scope of banking activity, enj

 

ing bank officials to take or

 

refrain from taking certain actions, issuing public statements, or imposing a financial
penalty.?®2 Professor Alexander opines that “[i]n the circumstances it faced, it must be
the case that the KNF could have chosen less restrictive penalties than compelling the
shareholder to sell its shares.”?83 Dr. Kluza testified that he could not recall “any
situation in which [he] decided to adopt such supervisory measures to a commercial
banking sector entity during [his] term of office as the Chairman of the KNF.”2®
According to Claimant, the KNF ordered Innova to sell its shares in Meritum Bank after
that bank’s remedial plan had been in place for more than a decade, while it initiated
proceedings against Claimant when the Bank’s remedial plan had been in effect for
less than a month.2®> Turning finally to the relative costs and benefits of the measures
imposed by the KNF, Claimant argues that all of the factors set out in Article 70 of
Directive 2013/36/EU militate in favor of a milder rather than a harsher sanction.3®°

Claimant argues more particularly that Claimant’s deprivation of voting rights was
even perverse in that it actually disabled the Claimant from taking the various actions
that might have addressed the bank’s financial difficulties.*8” As Respondent itself

FOR ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

[T]he KNF was aware that the situation, where the key investor could not
exercise its voting rights on shares, in the long term, would have a negative
influence on the situation and thus on the value of the Bank.

To that extent, the voting rights ban contributed to whatever operational difficulties

the bank was experiencing.?®*

Claimant also considers the KNF to have violated its procedural rights by, for example,
improperly under Polish law imposing simultaneously a freeze on voting rights and an
order compelling the sale of shares,?8° by refusing to lift sanctions even when
irregularities had been cured,?”° by failing to act on a motion for reconsideration

within one month,?% by having the motion for reconsideration decided by the same
officials who adopted the challenged measure initially,?°? by altering over the course
of the three decisions taken the grounds on which those measures were based and
invoking ex post rationales for its decision,?® by failing to give notice that the First
KNF Decision might order not only loss of voting rights but also the compulsory sale of
shares,? by prejudging outcomes and, above all, by repeatedly postponing the
deadline for reconsideration of its Third Decision until such time as Claimant’s shares
were required to be sold, thereby effectively depriving Claimant of its right of appeal

and the judicial protection thereby afforded.?°* According to Claimant, the shares had

to be sold by 30 April 2015 because the order to sell them was immediately
enforceable under Polish law,?2” and Mr. Kwasniak, in breach of the principle of
transparency, did nothing to inform Claimant that the 30 April deadline had been
suspended on account of the pendency of the KNF’s reconsideration.?*

Claimant rejects Respondent’s charge that it neglected to avail itself of a number of
legal remedies available to it. According to Claimant, none of them gave it a
reasonable chance within a reasonable time of vindicating its rights, but were either
inapt or futile.3°° Claimant maintains that it pursued every appeal route identified in
the KNF decisions as required by Polish law.*

Finally, Claimant asserts that the KNF’s measures manifest a lack of good faith. In
support of this contention, Claimant argues that, by the time it issued the Second and
Third Decisions, the KNF should no longer have had any concerns over the sound and
prudent management of the Bank.*°? More pointedly, Claimant takes the position
that the KNF acted more out of “personal agendas and apparent animosities” than out

of “any genuine or rational concerns.”4°2

297 For this assertion, Claimant cites Article 11, paragraph 2, item 5 of the Banking Act: “Decisions of the Polish
Financial Supervision Authority with respect to ordering the sale of shares by a specified date shall have the force
of a final administrative decision and shall be subject to immediate enforcement.”

It is not seriously maintained that the measures taken by the KNF were accompanied
by the payment of compensation corresponding to the real value of Claimant’s
investment. Respondent has in fact paid Claimant no compensation.*

Finally, while Claimant advances only a claim of expropriation and no other, it invokes
Respondent’s violation of the principle of “fair and equitable treatment” as probative

of expropriation.“

D. Relief Requested

Claimant seeks full compensation in damages for the alleged expropriation, in an
amount restoring Claimant to the position it would have been in had Respondent not
breached the Treaty.

More specifically, to quote the Claimant, damages are sought in an amount reflecting
“the difference between (i) the value of its investment under the counterfactual
assumption that the KNF had not ordered the Claimant to sell its investment and that
the Claimant remained free to benefit from the implementation of the strategy
developed by the Bank; and (ii) the amount for which the Claimant has agreed to sell
its investment to AnaCap, under duress and in ‘fire sale’ conditions.”*°> Claimant had
planned to sell its shares in a two-stage IPO on the Warsaw Stock Exchange, with the

first stage taking place in 2017 and the second in 2018.

In support of its claim, Claimant submits an expert report prepared by Mr. Paul
Rathbone of the consulting firm CEG Europe, based in London. Mr. Rathbone
essentially calculated the value that the Claimant would have received from its
investment if it had been allowed to retain ownership through the period of
anticipated growth and execution of the IPO. He initially employed a combination of a
“comparative multiples-based valuation” and a “cash to equity” model, taking 30 April
2017 and 30 April 2018 as the date of the first and second IPO stages, and the date of
the award as the valuation date. (Claimant accordingly does not claim pre-award
interest.) On that basis, Mr. Rathbone initially quantified damages at PLN
1,888,412,217.4%6

Claimant also claims entitlement to compounded post-award interest.*°”

THE DEFENSE
Respondent advances a jurisdictional defense, a defense on the merits and a challenge

to Claimant’s calculation of damages.

A. Alleged Lack of Jurisdiction

Respondent asserts that Claimant does not qualify as an investor under the Treaty and
that the Tribunal accordingly lacks jurisdiction to hear and decide the present dispute.
Basically, Respondent contends that the Treaty, as drafted, protects investments

made and not investments merely held.* The relevant Treaty provisions follow:

406 Statement of Claim, para. 606.
407 Statement of Claim, paras. 714-726.

108

Art. 3(1). Each of the Contracting Parties agrees to ensure, within its territory,
that the investments made by investors of the other Contracting Party receive
fair and equitable treatment that precludes any unjustified or discriminatory
measures that could hinder the management, the maintenance, the use, the
possession, or the liquidation of said investments.

Art. 4(1). The investments made by investors of one of the Contracting Parties
in the territory of the other Contracting Party may be expropriated or subject
to other measures of direct or indirect dispossession that have a similar effect
only if the following conditions are met...

(emphasis added).

274. Respondent further maintains that, in any event, the investor in the present case is

Abris, not PL Holdings. Respondent cites Article 25 of the Polish Banking Act, according

to which:

A party is deemed to become indirectly a parent undertaking of a domestic
bank or to take up or acquire shares or voting rights on shares of a domestic
bank indirectly when it becomes a parent undertaking of a party that directly
becomes a parent undertaking of a domestic bank or directly takes up or
acquires shares or voting rights on shares, and also a party that takes actions as
a result of which it will become a parent undertaking of a party that is a parent
undertaking of a domestic bank or that holds shares or rights on shares in a
domestic bank.*°?

275. According to Respondent, the record shows that PL Holdings was established purely as

a special purpose vehicle for the sole purpose of the sale and purchase of the shares in

WestLB Bank Polska.*?° Indeed, permission to exercise voting rights at the WestLB

Bank Polska General was granted by the KNF to Abris, not PL Holdings.*1_ Moreover,

Abris is registered in Jersey and operates out of Poland, and has no relationship with

Luxembourg.’?2_ Respondent concludes that “it was Abris which made the investment,
for which the Claimant is seeking protection in these proceedings, while the Claimant
was only a tool in Abris’ hands merely formally holding (possessing) FM Bank PBP’s
shares.”413

In its Rejoinder of 27 May 2016, Respondent interposed an additional jurisdictional
objection based upon the impact on the Treaty of Poland’s accession to the EU.
Respondent argues that Poland’s accession to the EU superseded, or otherwise
rendered the Treaty inapplicable, as a matter of international law under Articles 30
and 59 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Moreover, EU law offers
investors from other EU Member States, like Luxembourg, adequate investor
protection, and interpretation of EU law is entrusted exclusively to the courts of the
EU. Accordingly, the Tribunal is without jurisdiction to entertain and decide the

present dispute.**4

B. The Merits

At the outset, Respondent describes as undisputable “the principle that the State’s
exercise of its sovereign powers within the framework of its police power may cause
economic damage to those subject to its powers as administrator without entitling
them to any compensation whatsoever.”*15 Respondent thus invokes the State’s

“right to regulate,” which it defines as the “right to independently and fully regulate in

certain areas without such regulation being considered as being in breach of a given
treaty. Unlike an expropriation measure, an exercise of the right to regulate does not
give rise to an obligation on a State to pay compensation.*?°
According to Respondent, a claim of expropriation should be viewed through the
prism of the fair and equitable treatment standard.“!” Fair and equitable treatment is
denied when a State fails to apply measures in a proportional manner, acts arbitrarily
or violates due process. To satisfy the proportionality principle, a measure must be
suitable for achieving a legitimate government purpose, necessary for doing so, and
justifiable in terms of costs and benefits.*1®
Respondent gives national law a major role in the conduct of a proportionality
analysis:

Within the prerequisites of the breach formed by the relevant provisions of the

BIT, it should be national law that should have the deciding role.**9
The relevant Polish legal provisions, according to Respondent, are the Constitution of
the Republic of Poland, the Financial Market Supervision Act, the Banking Act, and the
Polish Administrative Procedures Code (“APC”). According to Respondent, the APC
embraces a series of fundamental procedural rights, notably:
the principle of the rule of law
the principle of explaining
the principle of active participation of the parties in proceedings

the principle of disclosure of the proceedings to the parties
the principle of inspiring trust in public authorities

e the principle of two instances

e the principle of weighing public interest and the equitable interest of the
parties

e the principle of impartiality

e the principle of material truth*?°

On the merits, Respondent insists that the KNF acted at all times properly under the

Polish Banking Act to ensure the prudent and sound management of the FM Bank PBP.

As formulated in its Post-Hearing Brief:

[T]the administrative proceedings and KNF’s decisions were a result of a few
years’ poor management of the Bank, disregard or ignorance of the Investor’s
commitments and improper or negligent implementation of supervisory
decisions. This process began long before the instigation of the administrative
proceedings, which were the last act of the drama.*2+

In Respondent’s view, Claimant, as investor in the Bank, repeatedly violated its
regulatory obligations towards the KNF, even while its financial situation remained

highly precarious, largely due to liquidity deficiencies and credit risk.*22_ In particular,

 

the Bank’s lack of liquidity and inadequacy of share capital presented, in the KNF’s
view, a very serious and real threat to the stability of the Bank and to the Polish
banking market generally.*2? Among Claimant’s faults were its failure to the keep the
Management Board composed of the persons specified in the Bank’s remedial plan.*74

According to Respondent, “[t]he risk to the prudent and stable management of the

Bank was confirmed in practice by the fact that the change to the [Management

Board] and the new strategy pushed through by the Board threatened the
implementation of the [remedial plan].”425 No less important, though, was Claimant’s
allegedly dilatory conduct in addressing the Bank’s difficulties, including most notably
its failure to support the Bank financially for a prolonged period of time, nearly a
year,*2° as well as its pursuit of the BankSmart Project, at the end of April and
beginning of May 2014, after closure of the receivership proceedings.*2” Respondent
rejects what it views as Claimant’s attempt to shift responsibility from the Supervisory

Board to the Management Board, since it is the former that adopts the remedial plan

it.428

 

and supervises the Management Board’s compliance wit!
Respondent maintains that the measures taken were not only within its authority, but
were also the only adequate measures available to it in responding the situation it
faced.’?° The KNF insists that all non-restrictive measures — such as engaging the Bank
and its investors in problem-solving efforts and requiring compliance with the Bank’s
remedial plan — were unsuccessful. It asserts, supported by the testimony of Mr.
Zapadka, that, in the face of the Bank’s failure to implement the remedial plan,*?° the
only restrictive instruments at KNF’s disposal under the circumstances were those

specified in Article 25n of the Banking Act.*3+_ (According to Respondent, measures

431 Zapadka ws, paras. 143-144. Article 25n provides:

(1) If this is required for the prudent and stable management of a domestic bank, because of the
assessment of the financial situation of the entity ... which, directly or indirectly, received the right to
exercise voting rights at a general meeting ... or because of the possible influence of that entity on the
bank, in particular, if it is found that the entity fails to meet the obligations referred to in Article 25h,

113

prescribed by Article 138 of the Banking Act could not be applied to Claimant because
they apply directly only to Banks themselves.“2) Respondent also denies that the loss
of voting rights prevented Claimant from participating at general shareholders
meetings, formulating resolutions, or implementing the Bank’s business strategy.
According to Respondent, Claimant could have increased the Bank’s share capital
without going through the general shareholders meeting, simply by granting the Bank
a subordinated loan or having the Bank issue subordinated bonds.*33

284. If the KNF’s treatment of FM Bank PBP was unprecedented, as Claimant maintains, it
is only, according to Respondent, because Claimant’s actions and inactions were
themselves unprecedented.**4 Thus the measures taken by the KNF were reasonable
and in conformity with the principle of proportionality.4?°

285. From a due process point of view, Respondent maintains that Claimant was fully
apprised of the charges against it and had a wholly adequate opportunity to

participate in the proceedings and to be heard.** It also had every reason to expect

If the decision referred to in para. 1 is issued, the KNF may, by way of a decision, order the sale of the
Shares within a set deadline.

If the shares are not sold within the deadline referred to in para. 4, the KNF may impose a fine of up
to PLN 10,000,000 on the shareholder of the domestic bank, establish a receivership at the domestic
bank or revoke the authorisation to establish the bank and issue a decision to wind up the bank...

At the request of the shareholder or the parent company, the KNF shall revoke the decision issued
under para. 1, if the circumstances which justified issuing that decision have passed.

that information gathered in the proceeding that contemplated receivership would be
used in the proceeding contemplating a prohibition on the exercise of voting rights.*”

286. As for the KNF’s delay in issuing a decision on reconsideration, Respondent rejects
Claimant’s contention that Polish law in all circumstances required its issuance within
a period of one month. Rather, each case is decided on its own facts, and the
proceedings against Claimant involved especially complex determinations and were
conducted by a new team having to deal with the case ab novo.*38 In any event,
whatever the delay, the outcome of the reconsideration exercise would have been the
same.*39

287. Respondent disputes Claimant’s contention that the Third KNF Decision was
immediately enforceable and compelled Claimant to sell its shares. According to
Respondent, the Third KNF Decision could be deemed immediately enforceable only
under one of three circumstances, none of which was present. To be immediately
enforceable as against the addressee, either (a) a measure of some sort must have
been requested by it, or (b) the KNF must have declared the measure to be
immediately enforceable under Article 108 of the Administrative Procedures Code, or
(c) a specific provision of law must have so declared.“*° Respondent denies that the
provision relied on by Claimant — Article 11, paragraph. 2, item 5 of the Banking Law**+
— constitutes such a provision because the Third KNF decision required Claimant to

441 according to the referenced provision, “[d]Jecisions of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority with respect to
ordering the sale of shares by a specified date shall have the force of a final administrative decision and shall be

dispose of its shares, not to sell them. Accordingly, Claimant was entitled to appeal
the decision before the Regional and Supreme Administrative Courts before disposing
of the shares. The sale of shares did not become mandatory until a decision on
reconsideration was issued and the case was finally heard and decided by the
administrative courts.

Respondent insists that while Claimant availed itself of some remedies at its disposal —
applications for reconsideration of the First and Third KNF Decisions and challenge to
the Second KNF Decision in the administrative court — it neglected to avail itself of
others. Thus, Claimant could have applied for a stay of enforcement of the First and
Third KNF Decisions under Article 135 of the Polish Code of Administrative
Procedure.“ (Respondent notes that Claimant did seek a stay of enforcement of the

Second KNF Decisi

 

n.“43) Similarly, Claimant did not seek explanation of the Third KNF
Decision, as provided for by Article 113, section 2 of the Polish Code of Administrative
Procedure.“ Article 37 of the same Code also entitled Claimant to specifically seek a
remedy for the KNF’s delay in ruling upon Claimant’s reconsideration request.

All in all, Respondent maintains that Claimant’s sale of shares was voluntary and

accordingly could not be regarded as the result of an expropriation. “°

443 Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 174.

#45 Statement of Defence, para. 425. Respondent denies that the KNF’s communications with Claimant over the
sale of shares was “threatening.” It was, according to Respondent, nothing more than a warning, about which
Claimant sought no explanation. Respondent's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 146.

In any event, according to Respondent, whatever procedural irregularities or
shortcomings that may have occurred did not rise to the level of a violation of
international law.“¢

As far as good faith is concerned, Claimant was unable to establish any motives of the
KNF in its treatment of Claimant other than those dictated by the need to protect the

Bank and its customers.”

C. Challenge to Claimant’s Damages Calculation

Respondent disputes the validity of the comparable multiples-based and discounted
cash flow methods of calculating damages employed by Dr. Rathbone.“ Respondent
challenges not only the accuracy of the data relied upon by Dr. Rathbone, but also
several of Dr. Rathbone’s assumptions regarding the feasibility of Claimant
implementing the December 2014 Business Plan“? and the likelihood and value of the
business opportunities that Claimant allegedly lost.4°°

Using three alternative methodologies — a transactional values method, a market

approach, and income approach — Respondent’s Expert, Dr. Caldwell, initially arrived

 

at a valuation of between PLN 250 million to PLN 350 million, from which it is

 

necessary to deduct the PLN 249.9 million received from the actual sale.** He

entitled to compounded interest.

between the Parties?

Xl. DETERMINATIONS ON JURISDICTION

A. Is Claimant an Investor within the Meaning of the Treaty?

(a) Respondent’s Position

296. As detailed earlier, Respondent argues that, while Claimant is a Luxembourg entity
and thus has the requisite nationality under the BIT, it is not actually the investor in
this case. The actual investor is Abris, which is neither Claimant in these proceedings
nor a Luxembourg entity, being registered in Jersey. Claimant is merely a “tool”

through which Abris made and controlled its own investment in Poland.

(b) Claimant’s Position
297. Claimant, having its head office and place of incorporation in Luxembourg, is a
national of “the other Contracting State,” as required by the Treaty, and there is no
basis upon which it might be described as a “shell company.”“53 Claimant itself made
the investment in FM Bank PBP, conducted all its business and held all its meetings in
Luxembourg, and oversaw the functioning of the Bank from there. There is no basis

on which to conclude that the investor in FM Bank PBP is Abris, not PL Holdings.

(c) Findings of the Tribunal

453 Exh. C-244,

119

298.

299.

300.

301.

The Tribunal notes that, although Respondent challenged Claimant’s investor status at
the outset of these proceedings, it has not seriously pursued this jurisdictional
defense. For that reason, the Tribunal may be justified in considering it as abandoned.
However, the status of Claimant as investor, for purposes of the BIT, is a matter that
goes to the very authority of the Tribunal to adjudicate the present dispute. For that
reason, the Tribunal nevertheless addresses it.

Respondent has adduced no evidence in these proceedings to contradict Claimant’s
representations that it itself made the investment in FM Bank PBP, that it conducted
all its business and held all its meetings in Luxembourg, and that it oversaw the
functioning of the Bank from there. Certainly the fact that Claimant raised additional
capital for the Bank from Abris when needed to maintain the required capital ratio
does not deprive Claimant of investor status. In any event, the KNF plainly treated
Claimant as the investor and addressed all of its decisions to it. Respondent
undoubtedly bears the burden of proving that Abris, not PL Holdings, made the
investment in this case, and it has made no apparent effort to do so.

Respondent’s jurisdictional defense based on Claimant’s failure to satisfy the

requirements of an investor within the meaning of the BIT is accordingly rejected

B. Does Poland’s Accession to the EU deprive this Tribunal of Jurisdiction?

(a) Respondent’s Position

As noted, , while participati in these pr dings, challenges the
Tribunal’s authority to adjudicate the present dispute on the ground that the

Accession Treaty whereby Poland acceded to the European Union superseded the

120

302.

303.

304.

earlier BIT. Claimant bases this argument on both Articles 30 and 59 of the Vienna

Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT).

Article 30(3) provides that “when all the parties to the earlier treaty are parties also to

the later treaty but the earlier treaty is not terminated or suspended ..., the earlier

treaty applies only to the extent that its provisions are compatible with those of the

later treaty.” According to Respondent, the dispute resolution provisions of the BIT

are incompatible with the Treaty of Accession because once Poland has acceded to the

EU, its treatment of an investor from another Member State (here, Luxembourg) is

governed exclusively by EU law and may be challenged exclusively in the courts of the

EU or its Member States.

Somewhat similarly, VCLT Article 59 provides in pertinent part that:
[a] treaty shall be considered as terminated if all the parties to it conclude a
later treaty relating to the same subject-matter and: (a) [i]t appears from the
later treaty or is otherwise established that the parties intended that the
matter should be governed by that treaty; or (b) [t]he provisions of the later
treaty are so far incompatible with those of the earlier one that the two
treaties are not capable of being applied at the same time.

Because EU law and the BIT relate to the same subject-matter and because both the

BIT’s substantive protections and its dispute resolution provisions are incompatible

with the intra-EU investor protection under EU law, the BIT is terminated, and the

authority of the Tribunal to adjudicate the present dispute is lacking.

Finally, under Article 344 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union

(TFEU), “Member States undertake not to submit a dispute concerning the

interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of settlement other than

121

305.

306.

those provided for therein.” This provision vests exclusive authority to adjudicate the
present dispute in the European judiciary.
(b) Claimant’s Position

Claimant contends that neither Article 30 nor Article 59 of the VCLT operates to
deprive this Tribunal of authority to adjudicate the present dispute. Article 30 has no
application because there is in fact no incompatibility between the BIT and the rights
and obligations that Poland incurred upon acceding to the EU. As for VCLT Article 59,
not only is there no incompatibility, but the BIT and the European treaties do not
relate to the same subject-matter to begin with, as required in order for Article 59 to
apply. For its part, TFEU Article 344 has no application because the present case is not
one in which a Member State has submitted a dispute “concerning the interpretation

or application of the [European] Treaties.”

(c) Findings of the Tribunal
Respondent interposed this jurisdictional objection to these proceedings in its
Rejoinder, well after the period for stating its defenses had passed. Moreover, this
particular jurisdictional objection is one that Respondent could readily have
interposed on a timely basis, i.e., with its Answer to the Request for Arbitration or
with its Statement of Defence. All the circumstances that Respondent points to were
in existence and known at that time. The Tribunal would accordingly be justified in

granting Claimant’s request that the defense be rejected as out of time.

The Tribunal does not, however, follow that course. The objection that Respondent
belatedly raises is a fundamental one, implicating the subsistence of the BIT pursuant
to which this Tribunal sits and thus this Tribunal’s very jurisdiction to adjudicate. It
also of course implicates important sovereign assertions not only by Poland but also
by the European Union. For these reasons, the Tribunal sees fit to address the
objection, notwithstanding its untimeliness. The Tribunal notes for the record that it
has given Respondent ample opportunity to explain the objection and has given
Claimant ample opportunity to refute it. Both parties availed themselves of these
opportunities.

The Tribunal notes that this is by no means the first occasion on which a Respondent
State has challenged the jurisdiction of an investor-State arbitral tribunal on the
ground that the BIT by virtue of which the tribunal sits has been superseded and
terminated by the Respondent State’s accession to the EU. A jurisdictional defense
along these lines has been advanced in several investor-State disputes,*>* in many of
which the European Commission has intervened as amicus curiae. So far as this
Tribunal can tell, in none of those prior cases has this jurisdictional defense
succeeded.

The Tribunal does not view the situation any differently than it has been viewed by
earlier tribunals faced with what might be called this “intra-EU BIT” defense. An easy

answer to the challenge would be that this Tribunal determines its jurisdiction solely

454 See, for example, Eastern Sugar B.V. (Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic, SCC case no. 088/2004 (Mar. 27,
2007); Micula v. Romania, ICSID case no. ARB/05/20 (Sept. 24, 2008). For similar ruling on challenges to the
enforceability of the Energy Charter Treaty in intra-EU cases, see AES Summit Generation Ltd and AES-Tisza Eromii

on the basis of the instrument that purports to found its jurisdiction and not on the
norms of an entirely different legal order. Other tribunals faced with a challenge of
this sort have maintained, rightly, that the treaty from which the tribunal emanates is
for all practical purposes the tribunal’s “constitution,” and it is on that instrument and
that instrument alone that the tribunal’s authority depends.*°>

However, the Tribunal finds it unnecessary to make a pronouncement of this sort in
order to reject Respondent’s jurisdictional objection because it finds that
Respondent’s defense fails on the merits. This is because neither Article 30 nor Article
59 supports Respondent’s contention that the BIT in this case is no longer of legal
force and effect.

The Tribunal fails to see the incompatibility, within the meaning of VCLT Article 30
between the BIT and the treaty by which Poland acceded to the EU. The BIT
authorizes an investor of one of the signatory States to institute a claim against the
other signatory State for breach of the investor protection norms enshrined in the BIT.
The Tribunal discerns no incompatibility between an investor’s recourse to a remedy
under the BIT and the possibility that it could obtain redress through invocation of EU
law’s free movement principles or recognition of property rights.

So far as Article VCLT Article 59 is concerned, the Tribunal need not even reach the
question whether “the provisions of the later treaty are so far incompatible with
those of the earlier one that the two treaties are not capable of being applied at the

same time.” This is because that inquiry is to be made only once it is found that the

455 RREEF Infrastructure (G.P.) Limited and RREEF Pan-European Infrastructure Two Lux S.a r.l. v. Kingdom of Spain,
ICSID Case No. ARB/13/30, para. 74 (6 June 2016).

124

313.

two treaties relate to the same subject-matter. The Tribunal does not doubt that EU
law affords an investor from one Member State in another Member State certain
protections. To a considerable extent, the foreign investor derives directly effective

rights from the European Treaties’ provisions on free movement of capital and

 

freedom of establishment as well as from their prohibition against nationality
discrimination. They also ensure in this context treatment of investors in accordance
with the principle of proportionality and with respect for the right of property.
However, the subject-matter of the BIT and the subject-matter of EU law, insofar as it
protects investors from one Member State in the territory of another, are by no
means congruent. The BIT in this case, like most BITs, affords foreign investors rights
that are wider than those afforded by EU law. The principle of proportionality in EU
law notwithstanding, the principle of “fair and equitable treatment” which undergirds
a great number of the awards rendered pursuant to BITs has no analog in EU law,
particularly compared to the extensive arbitral jurisprudence that has developed on
the basis of that provision. The Tribunal also sees merit in the observation by other
investor-State tribunals that the right of an investor under a BIT to submit its claims to
arbitral dispute resolution is a highly valuable right that is indissociable from the
substantive rights with which it deals, and one that the EU system does not afford.*°°

The Tribunal concludes that neither Article 30 nor Article 59 of the VCLT operate to
nullify the BIT in this case and thereby negate the authority of this Tribunal to resolve

the present dispute.

456 See Eastern Sugar B.V. (Netherlands) v. The Czech Republic, SCC Case No. 088/2004, para. 164 (27 Mar. 2007).

125

314.

315.

It remains to consider TFEU Article 344. Like virtually every other tribunal that has
faced this question, the Tribunal finds that the argument based on Article 344 TFEU
misses its mark. Article 344 provides that “Member States undertake not to submit a
dispute concerning the interpretation or application of the Treaties to any method of
settlement other than those provided for therein.” From all indications what Article
344 bars is an action by one Member State against another on a claim implicating the
interpretation or application of EU law. The leading case was indeed one in which the
United Kingdom succeeded in barring Ireland from submitting a dispute between the
two States to the court established by the United Nations Convention on the Law of
the Sea.“5” But the dispute before this Tribunal is decidedly not between two Member
States even if it ultimately arises out of a treaty between them. Rather, it is a dispute
by an investor from one Member State against another Member State. To a dispute of
this character, TFEU Article 344 has no application.

The Tribunal observes that Member States and the European Commission alike have
advanced a more sweeping proposition, namely that the European courts enjoy a
monopoly over the interpretation and application of EU law and that no other courts
or tribunals may engage in that exercise. The argument assumes of course that this
Tribunal will have occasion to interpret or apply EU law and that is by no means a
foregone conclusion. But even if it were, the Tribunal rejects any such assertion. So
far as the Tribunal knows, no other jurisdiction in the world has asserted a monopoly

— much less succeeded in asserting a monopoly — over the interpretation and

application of its law, even though it may of course claim to have “the last word” on
the meaning of its law.

The Tribunal is aware that there is currently pending a case before the European Court
of Justice in which that Court is being asked to rule precisely on the question whether
intra-EU BITs entered into prior to one of the Member State’s accession to the EU
survive.*5®= The pendency of that case does not spare this Tribunal the obligation to
address this matter. Nor does the Tribunal have occasion to consider how the decision
this Tribunal takes today would be affected were the European Court of Justice to rule
that the intra-EU BITs entered into prior to a member State’s accession to the EU no
longer have legal force or effect. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects Respondent’s
argument that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction to determine the claim in this
Arbitration.

The Tribunal accordingly rejects Respondent’s defense based on the incompati

 

between the BIT under which this case is proceeding and EU law.

DETERMINATIONS ON THE MERITS

A. Did Respondent Expropriate Claimant’s Investment?

(a) Claimant’s Position

Claimant’s position has been laid out in some detail earlier. Suffice it here to recall
that Claimant invokes the Treaty’s guarantee of compensation to investors for

investments “expropriated or subject to other measures of direct or indirect

458 Slovak Republic v. Achmea, Case C-284/16.

127

319.

320.

dispossession that have a similar effect.”45° According to Claimant, there can be no
question that the KNF Decisions carried out an expropriation in the sense of depriving
Claimant of the use and enjoyment of its property in the host State. Claimant was
deprived of its voting rights for a period of nearly 18 months, from April 2015 until the
sale of shares. Even if the loss of voting rights did not completely destroy the value of
Claimant’s shares in FM Bank PBP, the requirement that it sell its shares surely did.
(b) Respondent’s Position
As noted earlier, Respondent emphasizes that, even if a forced sale of shares
constitutes a deprivation of the use and enjoyment of those shares, Claimant was not
required to sell the shares at the time it did, namely 30 April 2015. Thus no
expropriation took place.
(c) Findings of the Tribunal

At least technically, Claimant was not deprived of its investment, but rather of certain
rights forming part of it, viz, the right to vote its shares in the Bank and the right to
dispose of the investment as it saw fit (here, more specifically, the right to offer the
shares in an IPO rather than selling them three years earlier through a different
procedure and under different less favourable circumstances). However, the KNF
measures severely restricted these rights, rights that constitute essential elements of
the right of ownership. These restrictions thus deprived the Claimant of the full
benefit of its rights of ownership to such an extent as to constitute an expropriation.

A State may be deemed to expropriate private property even if it does not itself take

459 Exh. CLA-1.

128

321.

322.

323.

324.

ownership of it. Expropriations in investor-State arbitration are commonly found to
have occurred without any actual physical deprivation of the property in question. In
indirect expropriation cases, the investor almost invariably retains ownership;
expropriation will have occurred because, notwithstanding that fact, the investment
has been deprived of virtually all value.

To the extent that Respondent advances a distinction between having to “sell” one’s
shares and having to “dispose” of them, it advances a distinction without a difference.
For all practical purposes, a “sale” of shares is nothing less than a form of “disposal” of
them. Certainly both represent serious interferences with a party’s rights of
ownership.

In fact, the terms of the BIT do not literally require proof of expropriation in any
narrow definition of the term. It also addresses “other measures of direct or indirect
dispossession that have similar effect.” Whether or not forfeiture of voting right
constitutes a “dispossession,” and it arguably does, the forced sale of property most
certainly does.

The Tribunal accordingly finds that the action taken by the KNF represents an

expropriation, within the meaning of the Treaty.

B. Did Respondent Satisfy its Obligations of Compensation under the Treaty?

(a) Claimant’s Position
While it expropriated Claimant’s property, Respondent admittedly has paid Claimant

no compensation. Respondent is accordingly obligated to make full compensation for

129

325.

326.

327.

the damage Claimant suffered as a result of the expropriation, placing Claimant as
fully as possible in the position it would have been in had the expropriation not

occurred.

(b) Respondent’s Position

Because Respondent did not expropriate Claimant’s assets, Respondent is under no
duty of compensation. Having voluntarily sold its shares at the time it did, Claimant

suffered no compensable loss.

(c) Findings of the Tribunal
It is undisputed in this case that Respondent, having denied any liability to Claimant,
has not deemed it necessary to offer Claimant any compensation, and it has not done
so. This does not mean that Claimant remained entirely uncompensated for what it
regards as the forced sale of its shares, since Claimant did of course secure some value
in the sale. That amount would have to be deducted from any recovery to which
Claimant may be entitled on the basis that it was required by the KNF to sell its assets

in April 2015 rather than being able to offer the shares, as planned, ina later IPO.

C. Did the Measures Taken by the KNF Comport with the Principle of Proportionality?

(a) Claimant's Position
Claimant’s position has been laid out in detail earlier. Claimant fully concedes a State’s

“right to regulate,” in the sense of adopting measures legitimately needed for

130

328.

329.

330.

safeguard of the public good.“ However, the right to regulate does not entitle
States, under an international investment treaty, to take measures that are
disproportionate, arbitrary or discriminatory. More specifically, it is for this Tribunal

to determine whether the measures in question “were taken in good faith, (ii) were

 

proportionate to the public welfare objective, (iii) were non-discriminatory, and (iv)
accorded with basic due process rights.”4°+

An inquiry into proportionality in particular entails an inquiry into whether the
measure in question:

e was taken in furtherance of a legitimate and substantial public interest and
was a suitable one for serving the legitimate and substantial public interest
invoked

© was necessary, in the sense that no less drastic measure would have sufficed

e was disproportionately severe for the Investor, compared to the purposes
meant to be achieved (i.e., proportionality stricto sensu)

Although Claimant intimates that the KNF acted out of hostility and bias, it does not
squarely question whether the actions taken by the KNF are one whose objective is
furtherance of a legitimate and substantial public interest. But, even if a legitimate
and substantial public interest is meant to be served, other requirements of the
proportionality principle must be satisfied.

Claimant thus first contests the suitability of the KNF’s measures, and on numerous
grounds. Prime among them is the claim that all three KNF decisions were predicated

chiefly on failures by Claimant that in all cases Claimant had by then already promptly

rectified. Claimant also underscores how soon after the order to Claimant to sell its

460 Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 35.

shares was vacated in the Second KNF Decision the KNF opened proceedings
envisaging that very same sanction.

Turning to the Bank’s financial situation and to the DSS investment in particular, it was
not Claimant, but the Bank’s Management Board itself, that was responsible for that
ill-advised investment.*® In any event, and most importantly, Claimant was once
again highly proactive in addressing the situation once it surfaced and discussions with
the KNF were underway.*63

Although the KNF referred increasingly over time to the Bank’s level of liquidity and
exposure to credit risk, the fact remains that neither the First, Second nor Third KNF
Decisions was based on those considerations.“ In any event, the liquidity concerns
of the KNF in regard to PBP Bank related to the period between the end of April and
August 2012, during which time the Bank was heavily influenced by conduct of
Claimant’s co-shareholder, IDM.*®> Claimant addressed that situation promptly and
effectively.*6©

The KNF had asked PBP Bank to prepare a remedial plan on a merger with FM Bank
largely to improve liquidity in PBP Bank, and in fact none of the Bank’s quarterly

reports between the July 2013 merger and the end of 2014 (i.e., after the Third KNF

 

Decision) showed any breach by the Bank of liquidity standards.’°”

334. As for the financial situation of PBP Bank more generally, it had improved
substantially by the time of the merger with FM Bank.’ According to Claimant, the
KNF failed utterly to appreciate how much the Bank’s fortunes had been affected by a
single bad investment, i.e., namely the DSS bonds, and how promptly and
cooperatively Claimant participated in addressing the problem. More generally, the
KNF failed to give the Bank a reasonable opportunity to put its forward-looking
development plans into practice.

335. Turning to the necessity prong of the proportionality principle, Claimant disputes that
the KNF’s decisions were necessary as a matter of Polish law for the prudent and
stable management of the Bank.

336. The KNF unquestionably enjoys a broad range of powers. These include measures
that may be directed to banks’ management bodies pursuant to Articles 138 and 143
of the Banking Act, rather than to the shareholders.“*? Employing them would have
been appropriate to the extent the KNF was genuinely concerned about bank
operations (as its comprehensive inspection of the Bank had indicated), since it was
the Bank’s, not the shareholders’, primary responsibility to implement the KNF’s
recommendations on banking operations.

337. The final prong of the proportionality analysis (“proportionality strictu senso”) entails
a determination of whether the costs of a measure manifestly outweigh its benefits.
Any such analysis requires consideration of the magnitude of the risks that a given

measure purports to address. The KNF predicated the measures it took on the

propositions that FM Bank PBP was not managed in a sound and prudent manner,
that this state of affairs was attributable to Claimant acting through the Bank’s
Supervisory Board, and that the Bank’s operations threatened the stability of the
Polish banking sector at large. However, the KNF has failed to establish any of these
propositions. Under those circumstances, the measures taken by the KNF cannot meet
this final element of the proportionality principle.

The KNF’s Decisions were also discriminatory. When the KNF was concerned over the
financial situation of Meritum Bank, it gave its parent, Innova, twelve months to
dispose of its shares in the Bank, which had itself been subject to a remedial plan for

over ten years (compared to FM Bank PBP’s having been subject to a remedial plan for

 

less than a month when KNF initiated proceedings).*”° Also, contrary to the usual
practice,*”1_ the KNF subjected FM Bank PBP to an AQR less than six months after the
two-way merger had taken place, and just at the time that Claimant was engaged in
the sale process. Indeed, it released the results of the AQR on the same day as the
deadline for the Claimant’s forced sale of shares.*72

European Union law, which is applicable to this case, if only as an element of

international law, fully subscribes to the principle of proportionality. The EU’s Capital

Requirements Directive (“CRD”)*”? specifically requires that administrative measures,

including penalties, be “effective, proportionate and dissuasive,”*” give due

consideration to “all relevant circumstances,”*”> and guarantee a right of appeal.*7°

(b) Respondent’s Position

A critical commitment in the remedial plan adopted in June 2013 was the composition
of the Bank’s Management Board and the competences of its members.*””? Changes
made in these arrangements on 8 August 2013 without consultation of the KNF were
violations of that i Although Claimant disclaii re ibility for the
changes, and attributes them to members of the Management Board itself, Claimant
as shareholder both inspired and agreed to them.*”? Claimant cannot shift
r ibility to the Board for decisi for which it was, for all practical
purposes, responsible. Nor can it sharply distinguish between itself and the
Supervisory Board, inasmuch as it dominated the latter.47°

Ms. Kozlowska did not, as alleged, invalidate the Board changes, but merely required
that they be reversed and that the original composition and assignments be restored.
Though it apologized, Claimant did not, however, do as directed. That is what
prompted the KNF to bring proceedings contemplating a receivership and deprivation

of voting rights.*8°

342. Although the three KNF Decisions made primary reference to particular actions of the
Bank’s Supervisory Board — notably its changes in composition of the Bank’s
Management Board — in fact those measures were taken against the background of a
pattern of poor bank management, disregard of investor commitments — on such
matters as liquidity and adequate capitalization —- and improper or negligent

implementation of the KNF’s supervisory decisions.*°+

 

343. Upon receiving the KNF’s consent to exercise voting rights in the PBP, Claimant made

the following commitment:

Financial support provided by the Applicants in an event posing a threat to the
Bank’s liquidity: The Applicants, acting as a shareholder in the Bank will ensure
that the Bank’s liquidity, capital position and solvency ratio remain at a
satisfactory and stable level for the Bank to be able to discharge its financial
obligations. The Applicants as Bank shareholders will take the above actions in
particular in a situation posing a threat to the Bank’s liquidity or a need to
strengthen its capital position or a need to provide the Bank with sufficient
own funds.*22

 

The Claimant violated this commitment by failing to increase the Bank’s share capital
when the Bank did not meet the KNF’s liquidity standards,*8? and, as admitted by Mr.
Gieryriski, the liquidity standards were violated as early as 30 April 2012. 484 This
situation lasted for a year. Despite calls from the Management Board,“®> Claimant,
invoking a number of excuses — including difficulties with its co-shareholder IDM —
refrained from taking the needed action. Claimant did not, as it asserts, react

promptly to problems that the KNF brought to its attention. For example, once the

DSS bonds problem surfaced, Claimant was dilatory, for nearly a year, in taking
remedial steps, such as purchasing the bonds.

In terms of proportionality, the measures taken by the KNF were unquestionably
suitable in light of the legitimate interest they served.

After deciding to abandon receivership proceedings as “useless,” because the
remedial plan was being implemented, the KNF was informed in May 2014 that the
Management Board intended to pursue a new business strategy — the so-called
BankSmart Project*®° — that the KNF believed to be at odds with the assumptions
underlying the Banks’ remedial plan.*8” Claimant knew about Mr. Lachowski’s plans
and accepted them,“®* although when the KNF requested that the remedial plan be
modified, Mr. Lachowski submitted the requested update.“®° Ultimately, on 10
October 2014, the KNF rejected the update.’*°

It is true that FM Bank PBP, under its new ownership, is today implementing the
BankSmart Project, to which the KNF had objected in Claimant’s case. However, the
Bank is today in a different situation, its owners having increased the Bank’s share
capital and having developed an extensive branch network.*92

By the time the KNF took its Second and Third Decisions, it was presented with new
grounds for ordering the disposal of shares. The Bank’s new and problematic strategy

had unexpectedly came to light. Although the KNF requested an updating of the

remedial plan, and although Claimant provided an update, the new strategy could not

be reconciled with the requirements of the remedial plan:

The fact that as of the date of this decision KNF has not accepted the updated
remedial plan submitted by the Bank on 14 August 2014 continues to be of
significance. The Bank was advised that the findings of the analysis on the
updated remedial plan indicate that it cannot be accepted in the form
presented to KNF as a remedial plan within the meaning of Art. 142 section 2
of the Act entitled Banking Law. In particular, the forecasts pertaining to the
rate of growth in the level of profit earned and the credit portfolio evoke
doubts and reservations. . .. Considering the foregoing KNF could not recognize
that the assumptions made in this respect by the Bank guarantee the
achievement of one of the overriding objectives of the remedial plan, i.e. to
cover the Bank’s losses from previous years. The updated remedial plan does
not afford the opportunity to assess the accepted assumptions as forming a
basis for the safe and stable development of the banking activity conducted,
and thereby as providing for permanent improvement in the Bank’s economic
and financial standing.*°?

 

 

The proportionality principle requires that a State take only those measures that are
reasonably necessary to achieve its stated public interest goals, and must avoid any
that are needlessly onerous.

Claimant is mistaken in asserting that the KNF had available to it adequate remedies
that were significantly less drastic. Among those mentioned by Claimants are
sanctions that could have been addressed to the Management Board rather than the
Supervisory Board, and Claimant in particular. But since it was Claimant that bore
responsibility for the bank’s precarious situation, it would not have been rational to

apply corrective measures against members of the Bank’s other governing bodies.*°?

138

350.

351.

Respondent takes the position that finding a lack of proportionality requires finding
that there is no rational connection between the measures adopted and the public
interest.44

Claimant exaggerates the impact of its loss of voting rights on its ability to supervise
Bank operations soundly and effectively. A shareholder retains the right to participate
in the division of profits (dividends), the pre-emptive right to acquire newly issued
shares, the right to participate in the distribution of the company’s assets in the case
of its liquidation, the right to participate in the general meeting, the right to submit
draft resolutions for the general meeting, right to obtain information, the right to sell
shares, and other rights determined in the Statute.*°> Moreover, there were no legal
obstacles to the Claimant’s participation in the GSM or submission of draft
resolutions, following the prohibition of the exercise of voting rights.*°° The
competences of the Management Board were in no way restricted.*°” More generally,
the prohibition was no obstacle to implementing the Bank’s strategy for 2014-2017.
That strategy provided for the issuance of subordinated debt.*®® Under Polish law,
investors are allowed to grant subordinated loans to a bank, and commonly do so.*°?
However, the Claimant never took the initiative, even though that was a means of

increasing the Bank’s share capital without exercising voting rights.

In sum, the KNF had good reason to find that Claimant’s actions presented a serious
risk to the prudent and stable management of the Bank, one that can be described as
“alarming.”°° By contrast, the new owner of the Bank has managed the Bank in a
prudent and stable manner.>°

In regard to good faith, the KNF in fact exercised a good deal of restraint and tolerance
inasmuch as the circumstances would have justified it in excluding Claimant from the
banking sector as unreliable, but the KNF chose instead to work with Claimant and the
Bank to improve matters.5°2 The KNF would have no reason to act, and did not act, in
the interest of anything other than the interest of the Bank and its customers.°°? Any
suggestion that the KNF discriminated against Claimant by treating it more harshly
than it treated Innova in the case of Meritum Bank can be explained by the greater

degree of cooperation that Innova displayed in working with the KNF.

(c) Findings of the Tribunal
Through its three decisions, the KNF imposed sanctions on Claimant as the holder of
shares in FM Bank PBP. The question which the Tribunal must examine is whether
Claimant engaged in serious misconduct and whether the measures ordered by the
KNF addressed these wrongdoings in a proportional manner. Whether the measures
taken by the KNF vis-a-vis Claimant were taken in violation of the principle of

proportionality is indeed one of the most highly contested issues in this case.

Application of the principle of proportionality inevitably entails an exercise in
judgment on the part of a court or tribunal, and this case is no exception. Regardless
of the law specifically applicable to the principle of proportionality in this case, the
principle is understood in largely similar terms across jurisdictions. To satisfy the
principle, a measure must (a) be one that is suitable by nature for achieving a
legitimate public purpose, (b) be necessary for achieving that purpose in that no less
burdensome measure would suffice, and (c) not be excessive in that its advantages are

outweighed by its disadvantages.

Suitability

There can be no serious doubt that the KNF’s measures were ones whose objective is
to further a legitimate and substantial public interest and ones that, if the
circumstances justified it, would be appropriate. Although Claimant intimates that
the KNF acted out of hostility and bias, that assertion has simply not been established.
However, the Tribunal nevertheless seriously questions the suitability of the measures
taken under the circumstances of this case.

The most serious reproaches made against Claimant by the KNF in this case, and those
that would most persuasively justify strong action by the KNF for the protection of the
banking system, concern the capitalisation of the bank and its liquidity. To be sure,
forcing a shareholder to sell its shares may under some circumstances be justified, as

when a controlling shareholder fundamentally fails to meet its basic obligations with

141

359.

360.

respect of the capitalisation of the bank and its liquidity. But it is highly questionable
whether that state of affairs prevailed at the time of the three KNF decisions.

While the Bank was indeed undergoing financial difficulties and while the Claimant
may not have been as forthcoming or diligent as the KNF could rightfully expect, the
KNF expressed no immediate need for additional financial support at the time of the
First Decision. By that time, the financial situation of the Bank had substantially
improved and KNF recognised that “the progress in the execution of the Remedial Plan
giving consideration to the Bank’s economic standing and findings of the
comprehensive inspection conducted in the Bank according to its status as at 30 June
2013 do not point to material deviations from executing the objectives and
assumptions adopted by the Bank and laid down in the Remedial Plan.”5°* On the
contrary, Claimant was addressing the Bank’s financial problems. As early as three
days after the First Decision was issued, the KNF declared that placement of the Bank
in receivership would have been “groundless and pointless.”°°> No adverse change in
the Bank’s financial situation thereafter occurred in the period leading up to the Third
KNF Decision. When that decision was issued, the Bank’s financial problems were
substantially less serious.

This will in turn explain why the KNF did not justify its decisions on the basis of such
considerations as illiquidity or insufficient capitalisation. In light of the evidence

before it, the Tribunal must conclude that the reliance on “the Bank’s lack of liquidity

361.

362.

and inadequacy of share capital” on which the Respondent chiefly predicates its
case*° was not the motivation for the KNF decisions.

The contemporaneous justifications that KNF advanced in support of its decisions are
of an entirely different nature. They concern essentially (i) changes in the Bank’s
Management Board that had been made during the period of July and August 2013, as
described above, and (ii) certain irregularities in management of the Bank that had
been identified in the Inspection Record and that the KNF attributed to the
Supervisory Board, and hence to Claimant.°°” More specifically, the KNF complained
that the Supervisory Board had failed to inform the KNF of important personnel
changes in the Management Board and that it had committed such irregularities as
Mr. Lachowski’s consultancy agreement, potential conflicts of interest of another
Board member, and a direction given in one instance by the Supervisory Board to the
Management Board on a matter within the latter’s competence. In short, even the
KNPF’s Third Decision was largely predicated, not on financial conditions at the Bank,
but on Claimant’s failure “to consult the KNF on the filling of positions on the
management board and the chief accountant of the Bank”® and the “irregularities”
referred to earlier.5°

As rationales for the KNF decisions, these are unconvincing. To begin with, the
circumstances surrounding the personnel changes, and in particular the need for Mr.

Lachowski’s designation as Management Board President, were to some extent

beyond Claimant’s control. Mr. Starficzuk had led Claimant to believe that he was
willing to serve as Vice President of FM Bank PBP, even if he actually harbored no
intention of doing so.>!° Despite having heard rumors that the three-way talks with
Meritum Bank might collapse, he signed the Bank’s remedial plan which clearly stated
that he would serve as Vice-President of the two-way merged Bank. By the time the
KNF approved the Bank’s remedial plan, it had already been informed by Claimant of
Mr. Stariczuk’s departure from the Management Board.>!4

Claimant acted swiftly in response to Mr. Stariczuk’s unexpected departure by seeking
to identify a person who had the requisite knowledge, skill and experience and who
was willing and immediately available to serve.>? As for Mr. Lachowski’s eventually
replacing Mr. Maciejewski as President of the merged Bank, it is undisputed that Mr.
Lachowski was better suited to that role.*?? The KNF had always known that Mr.
Lachowski was to become President of the Bank after the three-way merger, that is,
within a period of six months, voicing no objections.*** Moreover, Mr. Lachowski had
in any event been appointed on an “acting” basis, which is not an unusual practice in
the banking sector.>5

That change, as well as the change in positions of Mr. Lejko and Mr. Zielke, were a

result, not of dictates by Claimant, but of discussions within the Management Board,

and more particularly discussions between Mr. Lachowski and Mr. Maciejewski.>?°
Respondent has never demonstrated how the changes made to the Management
Board were detrimental to the Bank or to implementation of the remedial plan.>?”
Notably, notwithstanding its stated reservations, the KNF ultimately unreservedly
approved Mr. Lachowski’s appointment as President of the Bank. The absence of any
ultimate objections to his appointment calls into question whether the KNF had
serious doubts in the first place.>18

Moreover, Claimant did not fail to keep the KNF informed of developments during the
period of time in question and it responded to the KNF’s inquiries in a consistently
diligent manner.*?9 Claimant was entirely forthcoming in its explanations for the
Management Board changes — explanations offered at Claimant’s meeting with the
KNF on 21 August 2003 and in writing on 27 August 2013.57° Even after the
Management Board changes of which the KNF complained, the KNF approved the
Bank’s remedial plan.

As far as the other cited “irregularities” are concerned, it is undisputed that Claimant
and the Bank took promptly all corrective action needed to address the KNF’s

concerns. By the time of all three KNF Decisions, either these irregularities had already

been corrected or Claimant had assured the KNF that they would not recur.>22 Nor is
there any indication that any of these irregularities had in fact recurred by the time of
the Third KNF Decision.

Nor has a ingful link b the stated irregularities
and the Bank’s financial performance. It has never been demonstrated, nor frankly
even suggested, that the failure of consultation on personnel changes or the other
irregularities, as such, threatened the Bank’s sound and prudent management.
Moreover, whatever its failings, Claimant and the Supervisory Board were hardly
defiant. Besides correcting errors made, Mr. Gieryfski formally apologized and offered
to step down as Chairman of the Supervisory Board, effective 31 October 2013.52? He
was in fact eventually replaced in that position on 31 October 2013 by Mr. Tomasz
Bieske.°23

The Tribunal also has doubts, in terms of suitability, about the timing of the KNF’s
decisions. Only six days after issuing extensive formal recommendation to the FM
Bank PBP following its conduct of an in-depth inspection of the Bank and its
supervision, the KNF issued its First Decision to PL Holdings and Abris-EMP suspending
their voting rights as shareholders of FM Bank PBP and requiring PL Holdings to sell all
of its shares in the Bank by 31 December 2014.54 The Tribunal cannot reconcile the
issuance of detailed recommendations for future conduct with the adoption of such

severe sanctions a mere six days later. It is all the more puzzling in view of the

521 See para. 197, supra.

Report’s lusion that “the ic and fii ‘ial sit ‘ion of FM Bank

 

 

PBP S.A. was stable and did not endanger the security of the funds deposited in the
bank accounts.”525

Also troubling is the fact that on 25 July 2014, a mere one day after issuing its Second
Decision (which, as noted, was prompted by a legal requirement that the KNF assess
the effectiveness of the order depriving Claimant of its voting right before imposing an

additional more serious ion), the KNF i pri di ing the
very much more serious sanction of an order requiring PL Holdings to sell its shares.°26
Respondent has not refuted Claimant’s allegation that at a meeting held less than one
week later, the KNF indicated to Claimant’s representatives that it indeed intended to
issue an order compelling PL Holdings to sell its shareholdings in the Bank.>2” These

factors support Claimant’s icion that the of the pr on

 

25 July 2014 was predetermined.°2®

Finally, even if the Bank’s financial difficulties, rather than these various irregularities,
had motivated the KNF to take action, the measures ordered were not appropriate.
This is certainly the case of Claimant’s loss of voting rights. A sanction of that sort

cannot be regarded as for resolving the Bank’s fi ‘ial probl quite to
the contrary. Suspension of those rights voting rights may not altogether prevent the

shareholder from taking action to improve the Bank’s financial situation, but it quite

obviously does not facilitate any such action. Certainly, the KNF cannot plausibly cite

in further justification of this Decision the fact that PL Holdings could not exercise its
voting rights, when that is a sanction that the KNF itself had imposed.°2°
The Tribunal concludes that, in the circumstances, the KNF measures cannot be

justified by concerns relating to the capitalisation of the bank and its liquidity.

Necessity

Also problematic is the second prong of the proportionality analysis, namely whether

 

the KNF had at its di I less dri jan means for achieving the legiti and
substantial public interest it considered to be at stake.

To the extent that the KNF measures were motivated by the various irregularities
cited above, the question whether less drastic means were available to the KNF does
not even arise. Given Claimant’s prompt and adequate remedying of those
irregularities, no serious sanction at all was warranted, much less an unnecessarily
drastic one. However, even if sanctions were warranted on these grounds, any
number of lesser measures than deprivation of voting rights or a forced sale could
readily be imagined.

Necessity for the KNF measures plausibly arises only in connection with the Bank’s
financial problems, and here the KNF unquestionably had numerous less drastic
measures at its disposal. Claimant properly points out that the KNF chose to address

no supervisory measures to the Management Board, but only the Supervisory Board,

529 See Mr. Kwasniak’s testimony at Transcript, Day 7, p. 105, lines 19-21. See also Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief,
paras. 65-67.

148

377.

378.

even though many of the KNF’s grievances pertained to management of the bank.>2?
As noted by Claimant, the Banking Act equips the KNF to issue a wide range of orders
to bank management that, if issued and complied with, could have gone some
distance in meeting the KNF’s objectives.°34

Leaving that aside, Respondent has not attempted to survey all the milder available
remedies and sanctions it could have addressed to Claimant and the Supervisory
Board and show that they would have been inadequate for accomplishing KNF’s
purposes. Dr. Kluza convincingly recited a good number of measures readily at the
KNF’s disposal that would have substantially enabled it to address the problems that
the FM Bank PBP presented. These included suspending or discharging a member of
the Management Board, limiting the permissible scope of banking activity, enjoining
bank officials to take or refrain from taking certain actions, issuing public statements,
or imposing a financial penalty, among others.°?? Professor Alexander similarly opines
that “[i]n the circumstances it faced, it must be the case that the KNF could have
chosen less restrictive penalties than compelling the shareholder to sell its shares.”°??
The Tribunal finds that Respondent has not successfully refuted these arguments. The
Tribunal also notes Dr. Kluza’s uncontradicted testimony that neither the KNF nor its
predecessor body had ever taken as drastic a measure as dispossessing an investor of

its shares in a bank.5?4 Nor has Respondent attempted to show that the situation

381.

presented by FM Bank PBP was unprecedentedly dangerous, as one would have
expected under these circumstances.

The non-necessity of the measures ostensibly taken by the KNF on the basis of the
Bank’s financial performance is confirmed by the timing of the KNF measures, as
described above. Reference has already been made to the fact that only six days after
issuing its formal Inspection Report, based on a detailed investigation and
accompanied by extensive recommendations, the KNF issued its First Decision to PL
Holdings and Abris-EMP suspending their voting rights as shareholders of FM Bank
PBP and requiring PL Holdings to sell all of its shares in the Bank by 31 December
2014.55 It is difficult, under these circumstances, to consider issuance of the First KNF
Decision the “least drastic means” available to the KNF.

The Tribunal also cannot fail to take into consideration in this regard the potential
impact of the KNF’s First and Second Decisions — namely depriving Claimant of the
right to exercise the voting rights associated with its shares — on Claimant’s ability to
respond to the KNF’s concerns over the health of FM Bank PBP. It is difficult to regard
as the “least drastic means” available for addressing a legitimate concern of a State a
measure that lessens the addressee’s capacity to respond to that concern.

Turning in particular to the KNF’s Third Decision, it will be recalled that the KNF had
predicated its Second Decision in large part on the necessity of giving a first remedial
measure an opportunity to achieve its objectives before adopting a second more

drastic one. It is precisely for that reason that the KNF was not allowed by law to

384.

combine both the loss of voting rights and forced sale of shares in a single decision.
The very fact that, notwithstanding that principle, the KNF initiated the procedure
leading to the Third Decision, requiring sale of the shares, so closely on the heels of —
i.e., one day after — its Second Decision, depriving Claimant of its voting rights, again
makes it difficult to conclude that the KNF had no less draconian measures at its
disposal than those it took.

Similarly, the KNF launched proceedings against the Claimant and the Bank almost

 

 

ly upon of Mr. Lach ki’s i and without taking
the opportunity to ensure that its suspicions surrounding Mr. Lachowski and his likely
performance as Bank President had any basis.>2° This timing too strikes the Tribunal
as precipitous and not in keeping with the requirement of resort to the “least drastic
means.”
As an aside, the Tribunal notes, without relying on it for its conclusion, that the KNF
adopted its Third Decision by a vote of 3-2 (with Mr. Kwasniak in the minority), and
one representative abstaining.°?”

Excessiveness

As its final prong, the principle of proportionality requires that a measure taken not be
excessive in relation to the purposes meant to be served. There is no question that
the measures taken — the forced sale of shares in particular — were exceptionally
harsh. The question, in connection with this third prong, is whether the situation

facing the KNF was so dire as to justify them.

536 Claimant's Post-Hearing Brief, para. 20.

386.

Admittedly, Claimant, acting through the Supervisory Board, failed to act in prompt
compliance with all of its commitments. But in determining whether the sanctions
imposed were excessive, within the meaning of the proportionality principle, it is
important to keep Claimant’s shortcomings in perspective. For example, Claimant
clearly should have notified the KNF in advance of personnel changes in the
Management Board, and failed to do so. However, it is uncontested that at the time
of making the changes, the Supervisory Board identified the new personnel as holding
office in an “acting” capacity only. This does not excuse the failure to notify, but it
does mitigate that failure. More important, and as noted, Claimant and the Bank took
promptly all corrective action needed to address the concerns said to underlay the
KNF’s First Decision. By the time of the Second and Third KNF Decisions, those
concerns had been dissipated. And they had certainly been dissipated by the time the
KNF mounted its inspection into the Bank.

Also troubling, in connection with the claimed excessiveness of the sanctions imposed
on Claimant is the KNF’s launch of an “Asset Quality Review (“AQR”) of FM Bank PBP.
The KNF launched that inquiry in early 2015, just while Alior Bank and AnaCap were
pursuing their due diligence in connection with possible acquisition of Claimant’s
shares in the FM Bank PBP Bank.*?° In these proceedings, the absolute necessity for
the inquiry was never established, and its timing was, at best, unfortunate. It is not

contested that, upon apprising AnaCap of the AQR results, which Claimant was

obligated to do, AnaCap had lowered its purchase offer from PLN 100 million (net) to
PLN 30 million, thus by PLN 70 million.52°
To justify imposing as severe a sanction as a forced sale of shares — or dispossession,
within the meaning of the Treaty — the KNF should have been persuaded not only that
the situation was dire, but also that the shareholders had shown themselves to be so
utterly unwilling or unable to take corrective action if specifically ordered to do so
that dispossession was the KNF’s only option. Claimant’s witness, Dr. Kluza, former
Chairman of the KNF, testified that:
| do not consider that any of those purported justifications demonstrate a
failure by PL Holdings and Abris as majority shareholders, let alone one that
justified the adoption of severe measures against them under the Banking Act.

In particular, none of the reasons directly engaged the legal responsibility of
the majority shareholder ...54°

 

Dr. Kluza further testified that he could not recall “any situation in which [he] decided
to adopt such supervisory measures to a commercial banking sector entity during [his]
term of office as the Chairman of the KNF.”541

In short, the documents and testimony in the case fall well short of refuting the
Claimant’s contention that the KNF’s measures were excessive, within the meaning of
the proportionality principle.

Conclusion on Proportionality
The Tribunal does not doubt that the KNF acted in what it considered to be the public

good. Nor does it question that protecting the stability of a country’s banking system

is a matter of great public importance. There are certainly circumstances in which the
measures taken to that end would be entirely justifiable and in keeping with the
principle of proportionality.

However, in order to reach the conclusion that such was the case here, the Tribunal
would have to find that, under the circumstances, (a) the measures taken by the KNF
were suitable and appropriate in achieving its stated public interest concerns, (b) the
KNF had no less draconian means available to it or tried those less draconian means
and found them to fail, and (c) the measures taken were not excessive in light of the

magnitude of the public interest said to be at stake. The Tribunal cannot so conclude.

D. Did the KNF Seriously Violate Claimant’s Procedural Rights?

(a) Claimant’s Position
The KNF violated Claimant’s procedural rights both in taking the challenged measures
and in conducting its reconsideration.
As a general matter, Respondent advances justifications for the measures taken
against Claimant other than those that were advanced at the time and that figure in
the KNF Decisions themselves as the basis of those decisions.**2 Such ex post facto

rationales cannot serve as a defence in these proceedings. They show, in any event,

that Claimant was not, as due process requires, properly informed of the charges

against it so as to enjoy a right to be heard before adverse decisions were taken.

 

More particularly, as to the First KNF Decision, Respondent gave Claimant no notice

 

that it would seek to impose the sanction of a forced sale of shares. A bar on voting
rights was the only sanction of which Claimant was given notice.*? It was also
admittedly contrary to Polish law for the KNF to impose both sanctions
simultaneously.5“4 Moreover, Claimant was not given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard on its i with its ii i in ad of i of the
First KNF Decision.°4° The KNF conducted no interviews in connection with its
proceeding against Claimant, relying exclusively on interviews conducted in
connection with its proceeding against the Bank.>*°

In addition, the KNF |. hed pr di almost i diately upon

of Mr. Lachowski’s appointment and without any effort to ensure that its suspicions
surrounding Mr. Lachowski and his likely performance as Bank President had any
basis.54”

The Second KNF Decision was also marred by procedural irregularity. Under

established practice, decision-makers in an initial KNF decision should be excluded

from a proceeding for reconsideration.*** The evidence suggests that, in fact, no fresh
consideration was given to the initial decision to deprive Claimant of its voting
rights.>49

The KNF initiated proceedings leading to the Third KNF Decision, re-imposing the
order to Claimant to sell its shares, immediately upon issuance of the Second KNF
Decision overturning the previous order to the same effect.°°° That the KNF’s mind
was again made up is supported by Mr. Kwasniak’s invocation at the hearing of his
“wife’s approach who told [him] that: when you misuse my trust, you would never
regain it.”552

Worse yet, reconsideration of the Third KNF Decision was postponed five times,>>? to
the point that action on the request for reconsideration was extended even beyond
the deadline for the compulsory sale of shares. It is undisputed that these delays
were in violation of Polish law, which requires administrative authorities to review
their decisions within one month of a request for reconsideration.**? Nor is there any
presumption in Polish law that the silence of the administration for any particular

length of time is to be considered as either tacit approval or disapproval of a

request.°>4

Importantly, under Polish law, reconsideration is a prerequisite for judicial review.>>>
However, the KNF’s repeated postponements deprived the Claimant of the possibility
for review of the Third KNF Decision by an independent and impartial adjudicator.
Moreover, there is no evidence suggesting that the KNF conducted any substantive
evidentiary proceedings throughout this extended period.°*°

Claimant had no reason to believe that the order to sell its shares was impliedly
suspended as a result of the successive postponements. The KNF never informed the
Claimant directly or indirectly that the 30 April 2015 deadline had been suspended by

virtue of the Claimant’s reconsideration application.°>”

(b) Respondent’s Position
Respondent takes the position that in order for an investor to invoke procedural
irregularities in support of its claim, it must establish a denial of justice, or a willful
disregard of due process of law.*>* The KNF did not “cross the line.”°5?
The fact that the witnesses were notified that they would be interviewed as part of a
receivership proceeding, but have their interviews used in a proceeding for a

prohibition on the exercise of voting rights cannot be regarded as a gross due process

violation.5® In any event, Claimant had access to all the evidence collected in the
receivership proceeding and suffered no detriment.
Contrary to Claimant’s assertions, the timing and manner in which the KNF dealt with

Claimant’s application for reconsideration of the Third KNF Decision conformed to the

 

relevant CAP provisions. It could not r bly be d that the r ideration
procedure could be completed in one month, even if the law so required.
Postponements are, in any event, permitted, as here, where the matter was referred
to an entirely new team. The KNF’s handling of the request for reconsideration was
tainted neither by animosity nor by a “hidden agenda,” as alleged.>**

Finally, even if there were shortcomings in the KNF’s mode of proceeding, they have
no bearing inasmuch as “[t]he only issue of material relevance is that all decisions at
question were justified and legitimate.”°©? Otherwise put, the KNF’s alleged
procedural shortcomings are irrelevant to [proportionality], as, contrary to the

Claimant’s opinion, ... proportionality should be assessed as regards the merits.°°

(c) Findings of the Tribunal
Although the Tribunal’s finding that the measures taken by the KNF failed the
principle of proportionality is sufficient to justify the conclusion that Respondent

violated its obligations of investor protection under the Treaty, the Tribunal is also

troubled by several aspects of the way in which the KNF proceeded in this case,
unreasonably ignoring Claimant’s right to a timely hearing on this issue.

As a procedural matter, the KNF never should have issued in its First Decision the
combination of an order depriving Claimant of its right to vote its shares and an order
requiring it to sell its shares. As noted, the KNF did not allow its prohibition on
Claimant’s exercise of voting rights to demonstrate its effectiveness as a sanction
before embarking on the process of imposing the even more draconian requirement
that Claimant dispose of its shares. That represented a serious breach of the KNF’s
own procedural obligations, albeit one the KNF sought — purely formalistically — to
remedy through its Second Decision.

The proceedings over Mr. Lachowski’s candidacy as President of the Management
Board were protracted in the extreme and bordered on the abusive. It was in August
2013 that Claimant requested approval of Mr. Lachowski’s candidacy as President of
the Management Board and on 4 September 2013, at the KNF’s request, it supplied
the materials required by Article 22b, paragraph 1, of the Banking Act> for obtaining
the KNF’s approval. The KNF extended the deadline for making that decision multiple
times over a long period. On 31 October 2013, the KNF extended the deadline to 20
December 2013;5* on 10 December 2013, it extended the deadline to 28 February

2014;5 on 21 February 2014, it extended the deadline to 1 April 2014;5°” and on 28

to justify each extension on the ground that further investigation was needed,°° only
on 14 May 2014, did the KNF finally interview Mr. Lachowski. But then, on 30 May
2014, the KNF extended the deadline once again, this time to 8 July 2014.57? On 17
June 2014, the Supervisory Board of the Bank took remedial action, petitioning the
KNF to put an end to the delay in acting on Mr. Lachowski’s appointment,>”! this step
being a prerequisite under Polish law for bringing a complaint before a regional
administrative court. Finally, on 22 July 2014, approximately eleven months following
the application’s filing, the KNF finally approved Mr. Lachowski’s appointment as
President of the Management Board of the FM Bank PBP.°72

408. There are additional procedural irregularities cited by Claimant and unrefuted by
Respondent. But the most egregious procedural irregularity is KNF’s repeated and
lengthy postponements of its reconsideration, upon request, of the Third KNF
Decision. As noted, reconsideration was postponed five times, to the point that action

on the request for reconsideration was extended even beyond the deadline for the

568 Letter from the KNF to FM Bank PBP, 28 Mar. 2013 (Exh. C-168).

The KNF had to examine a series of issues associated with the candidate, inter alia, his experience, years
in service, career in financial institutions so far and professional record in PBP Bank and after the merger.
We were also aware that since 2008 Mr. Lachowski has not fulfilled any functions in the management
boards of companies in the banking sector. The KNF examined his activity associated with foreign
currency loans granted by the bank managed by him previously, the number of suits filed by clients of the
bank he was leading; how the post-inspection recommendations in the area of money laundering were
implemented in the bank he was leading; his behaviour as a member of the Supervisory Board of Meritum
Bank covered by the recovery plan, including the reasons of termination of his cooperation with Meritum
Bank. All those activities took time.

compulsory sale of shares. These delays are in manifest violation of Polish law, which
requires administrative authorities to review their decisions within one month of a
request for reconsideration, even if extensions are possible.5”? This exceptionally
prolonged and repeated failure to act on Claimant’s petition for reconsideration
effectively barred Claimant’s fundamental right of access to court for redress since,
under Polish administrative law, a judicial challenge cannot be mounted until a party’s
reconsideration request has been addressed.

This episode reproduced the same pattern of prolonged and inadequately explained
delay that Claimant experienced in connection with the proceedings for approval of
Mr. Lachowski as Management Board President.

The Tribunal concludes that, at the very least, the procedural abuses recounted here
compounded the lack of proportionality of the measures imposed on Claimant by the

KNF.

E. Did Claimant Sell its Shares Voluntarily?

Decision was not immediately enforceable is incorrect.>”* Under Article 11.2.5 of the

FOR ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

Banking Act, failure to execute the required sale on time would have had serious
consequences.°”>

The Parties are in agreement that the First KNF Decision was immediately enforceable,
insofar as it barred Claimant from exercising its voting rights in the Bank.5’° But the
Third KNF Decision was immediately enforceable also, since any failure to execute the
sale on time would have triggered serious consequences under Article 25n.5 of the

Banking Act.577

(b) Respondent’s Position

Because the Third KNF Decision was not immediately enforceable, and because
reconsideration proceedings were ongoing, Claimant was under no compulsion to sell
its shares by 30 April 2015. It could have waited, not only until a reconsideration
ruling was rendered, but also until the administrative courts had ruled on Claimant’s
challenge. Claimant freely chose to dispose of its shares before the KNF issued its
reconsideration decision.

In fact, Claimant did not ultimately dispose of its shares until 8 October 2015, over five
months beyond the 30 April 2015 deadline later.5”* All that was concluded on 30 April
2015 was a preliminary share purchase agreement.>”?

Claimant cannot complain that the KNF failed to inform it that the Third KNF Decision

was not immediately enforceable or that the pendency of the reconsideration

proceeding in any event suspended enforcement of the Decision. The administration
is under no legal obligation to inform Parties that are well represented legally of their
legal rights and remedies and the timing in which they may or must be asserted, and
nothing prevented Claimant from making its own inquiries or seeking confirmation of
its understandings. The fact that the KNF made repeated reference to the sale
deadline in its communications with Claimant®®° does not mean that the deadline was
in fact fixed and immovable. The Claimant may have been convinced that the Decision
was immediately enforceable despite the pendency of the reconsideration process,>**
but Claimant’s belief is not decisive of what its rights and remedies actually are.
Interestingly, on 26 November 2014, Claimant filed its notice of arbitration, even
before filing its application for reconsideration of the Third KNF Decision on 3
December 2014.

As for actions called for in the Third KNF Decision, Claimant was free to hold off on

them, not only until the KNF ruled on the request for reconsideration, but also until

 

the matter was finally decided by the administrative courts. Claimant’s interests were
fully secured by the fact that the Third KNF Decision was not immediately
enforceable.5®

Even if the Decision were immediately enforceable, this would not amount to

deprivation of the right of appeal. Appeal is still available even after an immediately

enforceable order is in fact enforced.>®? “Moreover, under Polish law it was absolutely
not possible for the KNF to ‘close the door’ to the review of its decisions by
administrative courts or to hamper the Claimant in requesting compensation before

Polish civil courts.”°*4

(c) Findings of the Tribunal

The Tribunal is unable to conclude that Claimant’s sale of shares in April 2015 was
voluntary.

There is conflicting expert legal testimony as to whether as a matter of law the order
to sell the shares was immediately enforceable, in the sense that failure to sell by the
deadline would have led to their seizure or otherwise been punishable; the legal
experts are in full contradicti t ‘, d itself ad d the
understanding that the Third KNF Decision could be deemed immediately enforceable
under three particular circumstances, none of which it maintained were present. The
Tribunal disagrees. Two of the circumstances are admittedly not present in this case
and cannot justify immediate enforceability. According to the first, a measure is
immediately enforceable if it is one that the addressee itself requested. The second
circumstance is one in which the KNF would have expressly declared the measure to
be immediately enforceable under Article 108 of the Administrative Procedures Code,

which of course it did not do. Neither is available to the Claimant here.

What matters, h , is the third cir that d admits renders a
decision of the KNF immediately enforceable, namely that a specific provision of law
so prescribes.5®> According to Article 11, paragraph. 2, item 5 of the Banking Law,
[d]ecisions of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority with respect to
ordering the sale of shares by a specified date shall have the force of a final
administrative decision and shall be subject to immediate enforcement.
Respondent claims that this provision is inapplicable because it comes into play, by its
terms, only if the KNF “order[s] the sale of shares by a specified date,” whereas in the
present case, the KNF did not order Claimant to “sell” its shares, but merely to
“dispose of” them. Accordingly, a conclusion that the Third KNF Decision was
immediately enforceable cannot be predicated on this basis either.
The Tribunal finds Respondent’s reasoning on this score to be untenable. It was
obvious to all that the means by which Claimant would almost certainly “dispose of”
its shares would be to “sell” them.
The Tribunal also rejects Respondent’s contention that Claimant, being well
represented legally, should have known that it did not need to sell its shares by the
end of April 2015. Even if Respondent correctly asserts that the order to Claimant to
sell its shares was suspended until the request for reconsideration was acted upon,
the KNF gave Claimant no assurance that if the Third KNF Decision was upheld,
Claimant would enjoy a reasonable period of time in which to arrange for disposal of

its shares.

424.

425.

For the following reasons, however, the Tribunal does not find it necessary to reach an
ultimate legal conclusion on the immediate enforceability vel non of the Third KNF
Decision.

Claimant properly took the KNF’s orders to sell its shares seriously, acting on the Third
KNF Decision in accordance with the terms in which it was framed. It initiated the
process promptly even after the First KNF Decision, which had required sale by 31
December 2014, on the assurance by its legal advisers that both the prohibition on
voting rights and the sale order were immediately enforceable.**° As noted earlier,
even after the Second KNF Decision overturned the sale order, the KNF made it clear
to the Claimant that “it intends to issue a decision ordering to sell the bank’s shares
again.”5°7 PL Holdings had to expect that, under Article 25n, paragraph 5, of the
Banking Act, failure by PL Holdings to execute the order by the date prescribed would
expose it to administrative sanctions in the form of a fine of as much as PLN 10 million
(approximately € 2.5 million at the current exchange rate), as well as to placement of
the Bank in receivership, revocation of its banking license, and liquidation.>** There is
no evidence to refute the notion that Claimant genuinely and reasonably considered
itself bound to make the sale by the 30 April 2015 deadline.

But the Tribunal finds that, even if Claimant were mistaken in its belief that the Third
Decision was immediately enforceable, the KNF owed it to Claimant, at some point

over the long period of postponements of decision on its part, to so inform Claimant.

427.

Upon examination by the Tribunal, Mr. KwaSniak repeatedly insisted that the KNF had
absolutely no obligation to do so.

The Tribunal disagrees. It finds that, despite Respondent’s suggestion to the contrary,
the KNF was not only obligated to act much more quickly than it did on the request for
reconsideration, but ought properly to have advised Claimant that enforcement of its
order to sell the bank shares had the effect under Polish law of suspending
enforcement of the requirement to sell the Bank shares. The Tribunal finds that good
governance requires nothing less. Respondent had ample opportunity over that long
period to apprise Claimant of that fact, but chose not to do so.

The KNF could not have been unaware that Claimant considered the Third Decision to
be immediately enforceable. Already on 21 July 2014, PL Holdings and Abris-EMP
informed the KNF that they had initiated discussions with interested investors and
provided a provisional timeline.*®° At a 31 July 2014 meeting between Claimant and
the KNF, the KNF affirmatively stated that it still intended to require PL Holdings’ sale
of its shares,>°° and so Claimant proceeded to explain to the KNF how it planned to go
about selling its shares and who it contemplated as interested investors.°°? The KNF

even injected its own views, disfavoring sale of the shares to private equity funds®*?

possibly be taken even within approx. two weeks. They did not specify when the order to sell the shares would be
issued, but the starting point is to be 31 December 2014.

and cautioning Claimant about the risk of selling to insufficiently experienced
investors.°°? On 13 August 2014, the KNF was presented by Claimant with a “short
list” of potential investors.>*4 Having ordered the sale of shares well in advance of
Claimant’s contemplated future IPO, the KNF could not reasonably expect that
Claimant suddenly sought to sell its shares voluntarily. The KNF could only suppose
that Claimant understood that it had no choice.

But, worse yet, the KNF actually led Claimant to believe that it had no choice but to
sell upon the stated deadline. As late as January 2015, the KNF, in asking Claimant for
an update on the sale, referred expressly to “the deadline for selling the shares
specified in KNF’s decision of 18 November 2014”5% which was the Third KNF Decision
and which indeed required sale by 30 April 2015. At the hearing, Mr. Kwasniak was
unable to square that reference with the notion that the sale order had somehow
been suspended as a matter of law. Thus, even if, as a purely legal matter, the sale
order was not immediately enforceable, the KNF did not make the slightest effort to
inform Claimant of that fact; instead it made statements that confirmed the existence
of a binding deadline by which the Claimant had to sell.

Under these circumstances, it would be unjust to Claimant to treat its sale of shares as

if it were purely voluntary.

(a) Claimant’s Position

To begin with, unlike other Polish BITs,>°* the Treaty at issue in the present case does
not impose an exhaustion of remedies requirement. In such circumstances investor-
State tribunals have generally not imposed an exhaustion of remedies requirement
either, except where the Claimant specifically bases its claim on a denial of justice.59”
In fact, however, Claimant in this case pursued all of the appeal routes, by way of
reconsideration or judicial review, that it can reasonably be expected to have pursed,
and certainly all of the ones of which it was notified by the KNF.5%

On 3 December 2014, the Claimant filed its motion with the KNF for reconsideration of

 

the Third KNF Decision, alleging that Decision’s invalidity.°°? Under Polish
administrative law, the filing of such a motion for reconsideration to the KNF and its
denial by the KNF is a prer isite to filing a chall in the ional Administrative
Court.©° However, Claimant was unable to pursue an appeal against the Third KNF
Decision due to the KNF’s repeated postponements in its reconsideration of that
decision.

Respondent is mistaken in asserting that there remain other remedies that Claimant

was required to exhaust before initiating this arbitration. Respondent first invokes the

597 See Inmaris Perestroika v. Ukraine (CLA-25, para. 302); Abengoa v. Mexico (CLA-210, para. 626); Crystallex v.
Venezuela (CLA-212).

598 Polish law requires the KNF to notify aggrieved parties of the remedies for appealing an adverse decision.
Claimant availed itself of all the remedies notified to it. See Exhs. C-173, C-218, C-242, C-427.

right under Polish law to challenge an administrative body’s delay in rendering a
decision. However, such a challenge must first be lodged with the body that is accused
of delay, and the administrative court that hears the challenge ordinarily takes six
months or so to rule.®! In any case, the court’s ruling is not a ruling on the merits, but
merely on the matter of delay.®? Respondent next invokes the possibility of filing a
complaint directly to the administrative court on account of delay, but that too only
produces a ruling on the delay issue and not on the merits. In order to turn to the
administrative court for a remedy on the merits, a party must first seek and await
reconsideration by the KNF, and even then cannot expect a ruling from the court in
less than six months. Claimant, it is said, could also have moved before the KNF for a
stay of enforcement of the Third KNF Decision.®°? Claimant did seek such a stay of
enforcement of the Second KNF Decision on 10 September 2014,°% but the KNF
rejected the request twelve days later,©> as did the administrative courts.©° Claimant
also could have sought from the KNF an explanation of the Third KNF Decision, but
that yields nothing more than a clarification of what the KNF has ordered;°” there is
no suggestion in the record that clarification was needed. According to the Experts,

there is no remedy in Polish law for requesting an extension of the deadline for

disposal of the shares.®° Claimant could only have sought reconsideration, which it of
course did.°°?

Thus, apart from the fact that the KNF brought none of these other remedies to
Claimant’s attention, none of them would have given Claimant a reasonable chance
within a reasonable time of having its claims heard.®?° Given the administrative
court’s exceptionally long delay in ruling on Claimant’s appeal from the Second KNF
Decision, and given the repeated postponements of action on Claimant’s request for
reconsideration of the Third KNF Decision, these avenues, even if available, would

have been of purely hypothetical value only.***

(b) Respondent’s Position
Claimant did not make systematic use of the remedies available to it. According to
Article 135 CAP, "[i]n justified cases the appellate authority may stay the immediate
enforcement of [a] decision.”*!2_ Claimant filed a motion to stay enforcement of the
Second KNF Decision, but inexplicably refrained from filing a similar motion in
connection with the First and, above all, the Third KNF Decision.®? The most likely
explanation is that, contrary to its assertion in this case, Claimant did not in fact view

the Third KNF Decision as immediately enforceable.°!*

Similarly, Claimant had at its disposal a remedy under Article 113 APC in the form of a
request for explanation of an administrative decision in the event of any uncertainty
concerning its scope or effect. It could thus have asked the KNF directly whether the
Third KNF Decision was immediately enforceable.

Also available to Claimant, but not exercised, was the remedy afforded by Article 37
CAP. Under that provision, a Party may challenge directly the failure of an
administrative authority to issue a decision within the prescribed time limit.

In sum, Claimant cannot properly prosecute a claim of expropriation under the Treaty without

having taken sufficient and due care to make use of the existing local remedies.

(c) Findings of the Tribunal

The extent to which investors are required to exhaust remedies prior to initiating
investor-State arbitration under BITs is not a settled matter. The reference here is not
of course to specific preconditions to arbitration (such as mediation or litigation in
national court for a stated length of time), but rather to a general exhaustion of
remedies requirement.

Some BITs expressly impose an obligation to exhaust administrative and/or judicial
remedies before resorting to arbitration. Many of the early BITs did precisely that.
Thus, for example, the 1976 Germany-Israel BIT provided that “[l]ocal judicial

remedies shall be exhausted before any dispute is submitted to an arbitral

172

tribunal.”*5 The 1981 Romania-Sri Lanka BIT states that “each Contracting Party
hereby requires the exhaustion of local administrative or judicial remedies as a
condition of its consent to conciliation or arbitration.”*© The examples can be
multiplied.

441. The prevailing view, however, is that in the absence of treaty language of this sort, no
generalized exhaustion of remedies requirement is applicable.*? The ICSID

Convention, not applicable to this case of course, so states in Article 26:

Consent of the parties to arbitration under this Convention shall, unless
otherwise stated, be deemed consent to such arbitration to the exclusion of
any other remedy. A Contracting State may require the exhaustion of local

inistrative or judicial r dies asa of its to arbitration
under this Convention.®!*

But non-ICSID investor-State tribunals have largely taken the same position.*!°
442. The Treaty in the present case contains no requirement of exhaustion of remedies.

The Tribunal concludes that Claimant was not therefore obligated under the Treaty to

 

exhaust either administrative or judicial remedies prior to instituting arbitration.

443. The Tribunal notes, however, that Claimant was in any event anything but idle with
respect to availing itself of local remedies. As noted, on 25 August 2014, Claimant
challenged both the First and relevant portion of the Second KNF Decisions in the

15 Treaty between the Federal Republic of Germany and the State of Israel concerning the Encouragement and
Reciprocal Protection of Investments (24 June 1976), art. 10, para. 5.

Warsaw Regional Administrative Court.®° It was unsuccessful both in that court®2+
and on appeal in the Supreme Administrative Court.22, We know that on 21 October
2016, Claimant’s challenge to the Second KNF Decision was finally rejected on the
merits by the Warsaw Regional Administrative Court.

As for the Third KNF Decision, Claimant duly filed for reconsideration, which is a
prerequisite to any subsequent judicial challenge,°?? and it is that request that the KNF
repeatedly postponed deciding. To that extent, the KNF obstructed Claimant’s access
to the principal remedy available to it under local law. The parties disagree over
whether certain other remedies cited by Respondent would have been effective in
addressing Claimant’s objections to the KNF Decisions. However, no determination of
that matter is required. The Tribunal finds that, though not required under the Treaty
to do so, Claimant invoked or sought to invoke the most important and direct
remedies offered under Polish law.

Failure to exhaust remedies is accordingly no basis for denying Claimant

compensation under the Treaty to which it is otherwise entitled.

As set out above, the Tribunal has determined that Respondent expropriated
Claimant’s shares of stock in FM Bank PBP by compelling Claimant to sell those shares
at a highly disadvantageous moment and before Claimant was even in a position to
mount its intended IPOs. Claimant is therefore entitled to damages in an amount
equal to the difference between the profit it can reasonably be expected to have
made if the IPOs had occurred as planned and the price paid by AnaCap in purchasing

those shares at the time it did.

Paul Rathbone’s First Expert Report
Claimant’s Expert, Paul Rathbone, submitted an independent expert report on
valuation dated 31 July 2015. In that report, Mr. Rathbone made a valuation of
Claimant’s investment in FM Bank PBP under the counterfactual assumption that the
KNF had not issued its rulings barring Claimant from exercising its voting rights and
requiring it to dispose of its entire stake in the Bank by 30 April 2015. Absent the
KNPF’s rulings, Claimant would have remained free to implement the business plan that
the Bank had developed in 2013, in anticipation of a sale by Claimant of its shares
through a staged IPO at a later time of its choosing.©* Though the actual date of sale
of the Bank to the buyer, AnaCap, was 30 April 2015, Mr. Rathbone set as his date of
valuation 31 December 2016, a date chosen on the basis of an estimate that that

might be the date of issuance of the award in this case.°?°

The IPO offerings were never contemplated to have taken place in December 2016,
but rather at later dates. It is accordingly necessary to update any 31 December 2016
valuation of Claimant’s shareholdings in the Bank to reflect their actual value at the
time the contemplated IPO would have occurred. The investment memorandum
prepared in anticipation of the merger of FM Bank and PBP Bank identified as a
leading exit strategy a pair of IPOs, the first contemplating disposal of a tranche of
40% of Bank shares on 30 April 2017, and the second contemplating disposal of a
tranche of 60% of Bank shares on 30 April 2018.56

Mr. Rathbone prefers a forward-looking basis for calculation rather than one based on
the Bank’s profile as of the time of the alleged expropriation itself. At the time of the
Third KNF Decision, the Bank, in Mr. Rathbone’s words “had just gone through its
merger,... was just started on its restructuring plan and its results were pretty
poor.”®27 He considers it unreasonable to assess the Bank’s financial value before the
strategic plan “had a chance to really get up and running.”®® He regards his
methodology as appropriate for a “growth company.”°?

Mr. Rathbone disfavors using the bids actually received during the auction process as
evidence of value because he doubts that they at all adequately reflected the Bank’s
real financial promise in the years immediately ahead.°*° For example, AnaCap had a

very different business strategy which included closing the corporate unit and

promoting instead the consumer finance unit.**4 Above all, he characterizes the sale to
AnaCap as “a forced or fire sale.”®2 He also doubts the accuracy of so-called
comparable transactions, since they were entered into prior to the merger, prior to
the new strategic plan (especially the retail banking launch) and prior to the new
management team.*?

Mr. Rathbone’s basic methodology consisted of what he identifies as a “comparative
multiplier approach,” which essentially entails the following steps. First, he
establishes a net profit projection figure by using the projections shown by the Bank
for the two calendar years in question, 2017 and 2018. Mr. Rathbone had at his
disposal, as the basis for such projections, eight different sets of financial projections
drawn up for various purposes, beginning with the remedial plan of June 2013 and
ending with an updated March 2015 set of numbers.®4 For several reasons,°> Mr.
Rathbone considered the Bank’s five-year (2014-2019) December 2014 business plan
to be the most valid source.*° According to Mr. Rathbone, the January 2014 plan
failed to consider the retail banking launch and more specifically, the BankSmart
project championed by Mr. Lachowski,®?” as well as his introduction of a credit risk

management system.*® While the July 2014 plan had begun to reflect the retail

banking launch, *° and was the one given to prospective bidders, it failed to take into
account the fall in interest rates that occurred in autumn 2014.° The December 2014
business plan was an apt one to use because it was conservative in that it specifically
reflected the detrimental effects of KNFs decisions insofar as Claimant’s loss of voting
rights impeded the infusion of new capital to fund growth and generated staffing
problems, in the form of staff departures and difficulties in recruitment.**? While
admitting that the Bank was in a rather weak, even poor, financial situation in 2014
and into 2015, Mr. Rathbone viewed the Bank as in a turnaround mode.*? He
testified that he had a high degree of confidence that the December 2014 Business
Plan projections could be achieved.** By contrast, Mr. Rathbone believed that the
March 2015 Business Plan reflected detriment from the KNF measures and, in
particular, the pressure to sell.**> According to him, if one were to use the March 2015
figures, one would have to imagine that the IPOs would be postponed.©*

The December 2014 business plan (encompassing the Banks’ micro-lending, corporate,
retail and treasury units) reported actual net income in 2014 of PLN 203.936 million

and projected net income for years 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019, respectively, of

and PLN 635.917 million, representing a cumulative average of 26%.°*” (The income
growth here projected is based on an average projected growth rate in banking assets
for that period of 26 %.°**)

By way of check, Mr. Rathbone compared the December 2014 growth projections with
the historical growth (in the period of 2009 to 2014) of a group of comparable publicly
traded banks on the Warsaw Stock Exchange (WSE), namely Bank Pocztowy, Alior
Bank, and Meritum Bank, all of which resemble FM Bank PBP in terms of business
focus and size.™° For the performance of a fourth comparable bank (mBank), Mr.
Rathbone exceptionally used the 2003 to 2008 period, because it was a time in which
that bank, under the leadership of Mr. Lachowski himself, pursued a particular focus
on the retail sector.

Mr. Rathbone finds in the growth data of these banks confirmation of the
reasonableness of FM Bank PBP’s projected growth rate for the 2014-2019 period and
evidence that those projections were not overly optimistic.°*

In accordance with the “comparative multiplier approach,” Mr. Rathbone then
selected a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) multiple, a formula he regards as the most common
to be used in an IPO valuation, particularly of a growth company.®*?_ A P/E multiple is

a standard means of establishing the value of a stock and is arrived at by dividing the

651 Rathbone Rpt., para. 109. As a further check, Mr. Rathbone tried to calculate what Claimant’s return on
investment would have been if it had been able to hold its asset to maturity. Based on past investment data, he
arrives at a return on investment of 28 % which he considers to fall within normal expectations. Id., para. 112.

actual stock price by earnings per share (EPS), thus indicating how many years at that
earning level would be required to equal the stock price. Mr. Rathbone selected a P/E
multiple by consulting the P/E multiples of listed Polish banks at 20 July 20 2015, the
closest practicable date close to finalization of his report. Examination of the financial
data yielded a median P/E of all WSE-listed banks of 15.6.°°? To arrive at a more exact
figure, Mr. Rathbone then confined himself to data for the three WSE-listed banks
(Alior, Millennium and Getin Noble) having business most comparable to FM Bank
PBP’s. That resulted in a median P/E of 15.3,°"4 the figure he chose to use.

For greater precision, the comparative multiplier approach calls for applying the
chosen multiple to a company’s “maintainable” rather than merely “base” profits
figure,°> the former being meant to more accurately reflect the company’s future
prospects and risks. To arrive at the Bank’s maintainable profit figure, Mr. Rathbone
made two adjustments to its expected net profit figures for 2017 and 2018 based on
the Bank’s December 2014 Business Plan. These adjustments related to the Bank’s so-
called “Warsaw Receivables” and to contemplated Bank projects that were not
consummated on account of the KNF measures, but were probable.

The Warsaw Receivables refers to the amount the Bank was owed by the City of
Warsaw as compensation for a forced sale of property. The Bank had acquired this
asset in 2011 and 2012. Though the exact amount of the debt remains in dispute, it

was valued in the Bank’s 31 December 2013 balance sheet at PLN 210.9 million. As

Claimant’s sale of the Bank to AnaCap in April 2015 approached, Claimant learned that
AnaCap was unwilling to include this asset in its acquisition of the Bank, with the
result that Claimant itself was required to purchase it from the Bank at book value.
For this reason, Mr. Rathbone removed the effects of the Warsaw Receivables from
the Bank’s financial projections. Mr. Rathbone in effect asserted, and Mr. Caldwell on
cross-examination conceded, that “the Claimant didn’t receive the Warsaw Receivable
as a form of consideration for the shares of the Bank.”

Second, at the time the KNF took its measures, the Bank was conducting several sets
of negotiations with certain large retail organizations to whose customers the Bank
sought to provide mobile banking services.°°” Mr. Rathbone attached a reasonable
probability of success to achieving at least one of the contemplated opportunities,
namely the so-called White Label project.°® Because the project had not yet reached

the stage of Board approval at the time of the KNF measures, its success could not be

 

assured and it was not refl d in the D ber 2014 i Plan. hb

nevertheless considered its success to be “real and measurable” and its inclusion in
the valuation to be warranted. ®°° Inclusion of the White Label Project in the valuation
necessitated an increase in the amount of Claimant’s required capital contribution to
d ratio. Mr. ‘hb idered that the

the i capital

Abris Il Fund would have provided this capital and he therefore included this increase

in his estimate of Claimant’s cash outflow.®° According to Mr. Rathbone, the KNF’s

actions necessarily aborted this project.°©? Otherwise, in his view, the KNF would have

had no reason not to approve it.°°?

When these two adjustments are made, the maintainable profit figures for 2017 and

2018 were PLN 145.39 million and PLN 173.38 million, respectively. Applying the 15.3

P/E multiplier to these maintainable profit levels yielded the following analysis of IPO

proceeds:
(a) A first tranche of the IPO, to be performed on April 30. 2017, would
cover 40% of the Bank’s shares and be based on the year’s maintainable profit
figure of PLN 145.39 million. That figure, when multiplied by the 15.3 P/E
multiple, yields IPO proceeds of PLN 889.79 million. From that amount is
deducted 6%, or PLN 53.39 million, to account for expenses associated with the
IPO itself (such as underwriting, legal and accounting fees), thus yielding net
proceeds on the first tranche of PLN 836.4 million.
(b) A second tranche of the IPO, performed on April 30. 2018, would cover
60% of the Bank’s shares and be based on that year’s maintainable profit figure
of PLN 173.38 million. That figure, when multiplied by the 15.3 P/E multiple,
yields IPO proceeds of PLN 1.591,660 billion. From that amount is likewise
deducted 6%, or PLN 95.5 million, to account underwriting, legal, accounting
and like fees, thus yielding net proceeds on the second tranche of PLN
1.496,160 billion.

The total proceeds of the two IPOs would amount to PLN 2.332.560 billion. This

amount, however, would need to be discounted to 31 December 2016 through a

Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) calculation to reflect the time value of money and the

risk of delay in receiving funds.**? Using a standard capital asset pricing model tailored

463.

to the Polish banking sector, he arrives at a cost of capital rate of 8.40%.° This
operation resulted in a discounted value of the IPO proceeds, as of 31 December 2016,
of PLN 2.157 billion, from which is deducted PLN 228 million in additional equity
required of Claimant between 2014 and 2017 to enable the Bank to meet its capital
adequacy requirements. The resulting sum is PLN 1.929,390 billion.

PL Holdings was not, however, the Bank’s sole shareholder. Mr. Stepniak would still
have held a 0.41% interest in the Bank, valued at PLN 7.9 million, leaving Claimant’s
net IPO proceeds at the level of PLN 1.921,481,566.

For Mr. Rathbone, there still remain two adjustments to be made. First, Claimant must
account for the proceeds of its actual April 30, 2015 sale of the Bank to AnaCap for
PLN 29,878,410 million, thus reducing the potential recoverable damages to PLN
1.891,603,156 billion. Second, Mr. Rathbone takes into account the fact, while
Claimant will not have received the proceeds from the IPOs until 2017 and 2018, it will
already have received in 2015 the proceeds from the sale of the Bank to AnaCap. To
capture the time value of that sum of money, Mr. Rathbone “uplifts” the purchase
price paid by AnaCap, using the same cost of capital as used earlier (i.e., 8.4%) by the
amount of PLN 3,189,939.

With that final deduction made, Claimant’s loss as of 31 December 2016 is quantified

by Mr. Rathbone at PLN 1.888,413,217 billion.

Paul Rathbone’s Second Expert Report

664 Rathbone Rpt., paras. 187-194.

464.

465.

466.

On 26 February 2016, Mr. Rathbone issued a Second Report, taking account of and
responding to Mr. Caldwell’s First Report. This Report echoes most of the themes set
forth in Mr. Rathbone’s First Report.
Mr. Rathbone reaffirms the correctness of basing the Bank’s valuation on a forward-
looking methodology, predicated on the Bank’s December 2014 Business Plan.
It is clear to me that the Business Plan of December 2014 was closely based on
the Bank’s Strategy for 2014-2017 developed by its management prior to the
dispute between PL Holdings and the KNF, and only adjusted to reflect real
events that had occurred in the intervening period between the preparation of
the two plans. That strategy in turn was developed from and consistent with
the Remedial Plan of June 2013 that was formally accepted by the KNF. |
remain of the opinion that the plans were professionally prepared and provide
the most suitable basis for the valuation of the Bank in a “but for” scenario.®©>
According to Mr. Rathbone, by contrast,
Mr. Caldwell does not use any of FM Bank PBP’s projections in his “income
approach” valuations. Instead he uses a projected asset growth model, which
takes industry average growth rates for banking assets, applies these to the
Bank’s actual figures at the end of 2014 and derives a set of financial
projections by using industry ratios. | believe that his approach wholly fails to
take account of the particular circumstances of FM Bank PBP.°°°
Mr. Rathbone accordingly criticizes all but Mr. Caldwell’s “income calculation” as
based on projections that are unduly negative. He finds particularly objectionable Mr.
Rathbone’s use of the AnaCap sale price as a transaction-based proxy for the worth of
the Bank, due to the combined facts that (a) Claimant was not a “willing seller,” (b)
the Bank was not at that time in a decent state to be sold (it was “unready”), (c)

competition among bidders was minimal due to the circumstances and timing of the

sale, and (d) the market believed that PL Holdings was being forced to sell and it

685 2d Rathbone Rpt., para. 16.

467.

468.

behaved accordingly.°*” All in all, the sale to AnaCap cannot be regarded as a “fair
market value” sale. The two other transactions employed by Mr. Caldwell as
comparators under the “transaction” approach are in Mr. Rathbone’s view, for a
variety of reasons, simply not comparable.%® As for Mr. Caldwell’s “market
approach,” it allegedly ignores the Bank’s growth potential by focusing unduly on the
Bank’s earnings and assets in and around the date of expropriation.°”°

According to Mr. Rathbone, both his methodology and his reliance on the December
2014 Business Plan are “totally consistent with PL Holdings’ status as part of a private
equity fund, where a ‘restructure, grow and exit’ strategy is very commonplace.”°7+
According to Mr. Rathbone, Mr. Caldwell clearly ignores the fact that PL Holdings is a
P/E investor and disregards the reality of how such investors manage with their
investments.

Although Mr. Caldwell’s income calculation has the merit of being forward-looking,
the figures used in making that calculation are, in Mr. Rathbone’s estimation, flawed.
Mr. Caldwell’s income ion thus fails to r ize that “PL Holdings was forced
to sell its investment early, at a price that did not reflect its growth prospects, and was
thus denied the opportunity to implement its investment strategy to grow its

investment and divest according to that investment strategy.”°”?_ For much the same

reason, he finds fault, among other things,°”? with Mr. Caldwell’s use of a P/BV
multiplier, in preference to a P/E multiplier, on the ground that the former is
appropriate only for a mature business with steady growth, but not for a growing
business that had only just been restructured and was embarking on a new business
strategy under new management, pursuant to a remedial plan that had been agreed
to by the KNF. °74

That said, Mr. Rathbone does introduce several changes in his calculations. On the one
hand, he defers to Mr. Caldwell’s observation that there is often an IPO discount in
the case of a new entrant, reflecting: (i) a lack of history of provision of good quality
non-financial information, and (ii) an incentive for investors to buy the shares, to
ensure that the IPO is a success and to encourage an aftermarket. He concedes that
most practitioners would include an IPO discount, and so proceeds to apply a 12%
discount to the initial IPO, that figure being the average of the discount rates quoted
by Mr. Caldwell.°7° On the other hand, Mr. Rathbone believes he had erred in

including underwriting fees among the prospective costs of the IPO, since it is in fact

673 According to Mr. Rathbone, Mr. Caldwell unjustifiably includes two additional risk premia within his discount
rate calculation and imputes asset growth and a return on assets figures by looking at the Polish banking sector as
a whole, rather than at comparable subsectors. 2d Rathbone Rpt., para. 129.

874 2d Rathbone Rpt., paras. 11-12. Thus, Mr. Caldwell mistakenly build his projections “on the Bank’s assets and
depressed earnings in 2014 [which fails to] represent the true underlying value of the shares.” 2d Rathbone Rpt.,
para. 157:

Whilst | agree that the recent history of one of the predecessor banks (PBP Bank) had raised some serious
challenges, | believe that Mr. Caldwell’s description of the merged Bank is unduly negative. His review
ignores the history of the second predecessor bank (FM Bank), the effect of the new management
brought in after the merger and the restructuring plan that management had developed, based on the
Remedial Plan agreed with the KNF, and that the Bank had started to implement.

unusual to pay underwriting fees in Poland. He thus reduces the IPO expense
percentage from 6% to 1 %.°7°

In addition, Mr. Rathbone agreed not to disregard the Warsaw Receivable fully, but
rather to charge it to Claimant to the extent of the portion of the compensation
already paid in the amount of PLN 2,636,264.°77 However, he maintains that
Claimant’s lost earnings must include a portion of expected proceeds from the White
Label project.®78

680 Rathbone explains: “As discussed in section 1, | have only accounted for the Warsaw Receivable to the extent
that it has generated cash.”

681 Mir. Rathbone explains: “The IFC Deferred Consideration is equal to the higher of PLN 4,155,278 and 50% of
the exit value of 12,526 shares in the Bank at the first transaction where PL Holdings sells more than 12,526 shares.
As discussed in section 6.2.1, on 16 October 2015 PL Holdings paid the IFC PLN 5,068,641 to settle this liability.
However, under my counterfactual scenario, the sale to AnaCap does not take place, and the first time that the IFC
Deferred Consideration will be triggered is the IPO in June 2017. Thus I need to account for the additional deferred
consideration that PL Holdings would have to pay the IFC under my counterfactual scenario.”

682 Mir, Rathbone explains: “This calculation is complicated by the fact that, under my counterfactual, the Bank will
have to issue new capital, thus diluting the IFC stake. On 31 December 2014 FM Bank PBP had 308,907 shares of
PLN 1,000 in issue. According to my valuation model (Table 9), new equity of PLN 220.8 million will be required for
the years 2016- 2018 to meet capital requirements155. Assuming that new equity was issued at par, this would
need 220,800 new shares at PLN 1,000 each to be issued. Thus the share capital at IPO would be 529,707 shares.

(b) Respondent’s Position
473. Claimant has no entitlement to damages both because no expropriation occurred and

because, even if it suffered a loss of property, it did so as a result of Respondent’s

 

legitimate use of its authority and responsibilities in regulating the Polish banking

 

sector.

Andrew Caldwell’s First Expert Report

474. Against the possibility that the Tribunal might find Respondent liable to Claimant in
this case, Respondent’s Expert, Andrew Caldwell, submitted an expert report dated 6
November 2015, reviewing and critiquing the report submitted by Mr. Rathbone.

475. Comparison of the Experts’ reports is rendered difficult due to Mr. Caldwell’s having
been instructed by counsel to value FM Bank PBP as of 18 November 2014 rather than

December 2016, as Mr. Rathbone had been instructed to do. Mr. Caldwell was told

 

My valuation of the 2017 IPO is PLN 889.79 million less the IPO discount of 12%, so 783.02 million. This is
for 40% of the company, so the valuation of the whole company at IPO would be PLN 1,957.55 million. Thus the IFC
Deferred Consideration payable upon the first IPO would be 50% of 12,526/529,709 of this amount, or PLN 23.145
million. | have thus added back the PLN 5.069 million actually paid and deducted the PLN 23.145 million payable
under my counterfactual in my damages calculation.”

683 Mr. Rathbone explains: “The uplift on the purchase price reflects the fact that, under my counterfactual case,
various payments and receipts occur at various times, so | need to adjust these amount for the time value of
money. | have thus calculated interest on each of the various amounts from the assumed date of each transaction
to the date of the valuation, using the same cost of capital as | have used for discounting the IPO proceeds.”

191

that 18 November 2014, the date of the Third KNF Decision, should be treated as the
date of the alleged breach and that valuation as of that date had the advantage of
logically not reflecting any adverse effects on valuation due to Respondent’s alleged
breach.

As a general matter, Mr. Caldwell considers it safer, in the presence of considerable
uncertainty, to avoid forward-looking valuations of the Bank’s short-term prospects
and the longer-term prospects at the time of a future IPO event, and rely instead on
more or less contemporaneous transactions in the shares.*** He evidently would feel
differently if he regarded the Bank as a fully mature business.®° In fact, Mr. Caldwell
doubts that Mr. Rathbone’s projections could in fact be achieved.® For these
reasons, Mr. Caldwell prefers not to base his valuation on any of the Bank’s business
plans.®7

As alternative methodologies, Mr. Caldwell successively a “transactional value”
approach, a “market” approach, and an “income” approach.

Under a transactional value approach, one considers recent comparable arm’s length
transactions in, or offers for, the asset in question. In this case, these transactions
arguably include (a) Claimant’s acquisition in July 2012 of a 45% share in PBP Bank
from IDM, (b) Claimant’s acquisition of a 10% share in FM Bank from IFC as part of the
FM Bank and PBP Bank merger, and of course (c) the transaction resulting in AnaCap’s

offer for the Bank, already discussed. As for the first, it reveals a PBP Bank value at

684 Tr., 19 July 2016, p. 174, lines 14-20.
685 Tr., 19 July 2016, p. 207, lines 11-17.

the time of PLN 211 million which, considering the relative values of FM Bank and PBP
Bank, suggests an adjusted valuation of the merged bank of between PLN 375 million
and PLN 394 million.®® As for the second, it reveals a merged bank value of PLN 243.2
million.©°

However, Mr. Caldwell focuses, by way of transaction on the AnaCap transaction, i.e.,
on the assumption that the value of the investment, had Claimant been allowed to
keep it, would be reflected in the amount that AnaCap was prepared to pay for it
following the July 2014 to April 2015 period during which Claimant was marketing its
shares in the Bank to potential purchasers.°° The bases for this assumption are
several. First, AnaCap and the other potential investors had presumably been supplied
all the necessary information and had had the time needed to conduct due
diligence. Second, the data they relied on were drawn from the Bank’s July 2014
Business Plan,°°? which Mr. Rathbone admits “is the latest plan available that is not

materially affected by the damage to the business caused by some of the KNF’s

 

action.” Third, AnaCap actually raised its October 2014 bid by PLN 20 million when
it revised its offer in February 2015." Finally, the July 2014 Business Plan data were

actually more optimistic than the December 2014 Business Plan data were.

688 Caldwell Rpt., para. 8.4.4.

689 Caldwell Rpt., para. 8.3.7.

690 Caldwell Rpt., para. 6.1.15.

691 In fact, Mr. Caldwell concludes that the auction process was such as to allow “potential buyers to be properly
identified, canvassed and informed, and to conduct their own diligence and decision-making processes.”
“Therefore, it appears reasonable to consider the result of the process as a strong indicator of value.” Caldwell

481.

The offer made by AnaCap on 25 February 2015 was in the amount of PLN 100 million,
plus the value of the Warsaw Receivables, estimated as PLN 220 million, yielding a
total valuation of PLN 320 million. Mr. Caldwell sees no reason why AnaCap would
not, on that basis, have offered a figure that adequately reflected the Bank’s real
prospects for growth and profit over the years immediately ahead. Mr. Caldwell
writes:

| would expect AnaCap and other bidders to have considered all potential exit

routes in preparing their offers, and therefore these offers would reflect value

accruing from such an exit, using the bidders’ own views on exit values and
adjusted for the risk and timing.°°>

Put differently, the offer that Claimant received from AnaCap — being the highest offer
— should be regarded as reflecting the most positive market assessment of the Bank’s

true value.

However, Mr. Caldwell recognizes that, while AnaCap offered to buy the Bank for PLN
320 million on 24 February 2015, it actually reduced that offer by PLN 70 million in
April 2015, in the wake of the KNF’s critical AQR evaluation of the Bank. Although
Mr. Caldwell considers that reduction in valuation to be justified by the AQR results
themselves, °° he allows that the range of damages plausibly recoverable by Claimant
could possibly be extended under this valuation approach to between PLN 0 and PLN

71 million.

695 Caldwell Rpt., para. 6.2.1.
696 Caldwell Rpt., para. 6.1.42. He adds: “It may also partly reflect the strong position that a buyer enjoys in an
exclusivity period in many Merger & Acquisition (“M&A”) processes.”

194

482.

483.

Alternatively, under a market approach, one relies on comparable market data, based
either on transactions in listed shares in other banks or on bank mergers and
acquisitions. Here the valuation figures that result depend upon whether the
calculation is made using P/E multiples or P/BV multiples. Using P/BV multiples as

applied to transactions in listed shares in other banks, Mr. Caldwell arrives at a Bank

 

valuation range of between PLN 163.4 million and PLN 253.8 million.” Using P/E

 

multiples as applied to such transactions, he arrives at a Bank valuation range of
between PLN 167.4 and PLN 221.3 million.®®? Looking at mergers and acquisitions

among other banks, Mr. Caldwell arrives at a valuation for the merged Bank in the

 

range of PLN 233 million to PLN 320.9 million.°°?

 

Under a third method entertained by Mr. Caldwell, one adopts an essentially forward-
looking approach, assessing the present value of future income flows, which of course
ultimately requires a discounting of expected future flows. This approach, unlike the
transaction or market approaches, and somewhat like Mr. Rathbone’s approach,
assumes the existence of a reasonable basis for estimating future cash flows.” Mr.
Caldwell prepared his projection of future income on the basis of less optimistic

pti than Mr. hb did. For le, he posited (a) a five-year growth

 

rate of 7.35% , (b) an opening return on assets of -0.46%, (c) a growth of return on

assets of 1.3% by year five, (d) a required increase in equity capital of 9%, and (e) a

discount rate to present based on a cost of equity of 13%.”°! Using this income

valuation approach, Mr. Caldwell arrives at a valuation for the merged Bank in the

 

range of PLN 256.1 million to 264 million.” Cross-examining counsel asked Mr.
Caldwell why he assumed a 7.35% growth rate when the Bank’s actual growth rate up
to December 2014 as 31%.” Mr. Caldwell replied that he was merely “trying to take
a conservative view as to what the bank could do in its present condition as [of] 18
November [2014].”704
Assembling the results of Mr. Caldwell’s valuation alternatives reveals a valuation
range of between PLN 250 million and PLN 350 million.”
Mr. Rathbone’s assessment took as its financial point of departure the Bank’s
December 2014 Business Plan, and proceeded from there. Mr. Caldwell believes that
the projections contained in that business plan were unrealistic and in fact
unachievable,’ and he criticizes Mr. Rathbone for accepting them unqualifiedly.”””
Mr. Rathbone’s approach to calculation of losses is dependent on an
assumption that, but for the alleged breach related to certain KNF actions, FM

Bank BPB would have achieved the results as projected in the December 2014
Business Plan.

He accepts these figures without making any form of qualification or
adjustment as to the likelihood of them being achieved. In my experience, it is
very rare for a trading company, especially one that has been recently created
or merged, and that is introducing new lines of business, to achieve the precise
results as set out in a medium term plan. Ignoring this fact can have a
significant impact on valuation. Mr. Rathbone’s methodology omits any

element of failing to achieve its forecast result for its then-existing business,
and falls outside what might be seen as normal valuation practice.”

Mr. Caldwell identifies a certain number of general weaknesses observable in the
Bank’s operations and its circumstances toward the end of 2014 of which he believes
Mr. Rathbone fails to take due account.”°° These include: (a) a highly concentrated

depositor base (risking a liquidity crisis if any one of the top depositors were to

 

withdraw); (b) a high cost-to-income ratio; (c) falling interest rates; (d) a rise in non-
performing loans; (e) a highly concentrated corporate loan portfolio, and (f) certain

regulatory and operational risks. According to Mr. Caldwell, the 25 July 2014 Vendor

 

Due Diligence Report, prepared by Ernst & Young upon initiation of the auction
process,”?° echoes these same weaknesses. On cross-examination, however, Mr.
Caldwell conceded that interest income in both FM Bank and PBP Bank grew
consistently between 2010 and 2012.74 Nor did he disagree with cross-examining
counsel’s representation that in 2012 FM Bank was the highest growth bank in Poland
and also had the highest return on equity.”!2_ Mr. Caldwell nevertheless stood by his

testimony that the financial performance of the banks was consistently weak.743

While falling short of terming them squarely unachievable, Mr. Caldwell characterizes

 

 

hi of the D ber 2014 i Plan projecti as ing.”714 The

challenges are that (a) any growth policy based on an increase in new lending

increases the risk of credit losses; (b) the Bank would face stiff competition from other
banks for the secure but small “professional” loan segment the Bank was targeting; (c)
the bank needed to make a major investment in information technology; and (d) the
Bank’s projected rate of growth, both in income from banking operations and return
on equity, was unrealistic and beyond what competitor banks were achieving.”*5

In sum, Mr. Caldwell views the December 2014 Business Plan “as a marketing tool to
present FM Bank PBP in the best possible light, to encourage bidder interest and
higher offers.”7! He characterizes the forecasts as “aggressive.”7!7

Mr. Caldwell’s reasons for considering the Rathbone Report to be unduly optimistic
are numerous. For example, Mr. Rathbone’s counterfactual assumed that all profits of
the Bank profits would be plowed back into it and no dividends paid. Mr. Caldwell
questions how attractive that scenario would be to potential IPO investors.”4* Mr.
Caldwell further notes that, according to the December 2014 Business Plan

projections, maintainable net profits after tax would grow at a rate of 126% between

 

2016 (PLN 64.3 million) and 2017 (PLN 145.4 million), more than doubling.”*° Replacing
a forward multiple with a historical multiple would greatly reduce the Bank’s
valuation and expected IPO proceeds.’2° Third, the Bank’s retail banking activity

contemplated by the Business Plan had only been launched in July 2014, and growth

would require heavy marketing and an offer of high enough interest rates to attract

new depositors.’21 Then too, Mr. Caldwell challenges Mr. Rathbone’s assumption that
the needed subordinated debt could in fact be raised from independent sources, could
be priced as per the December 2014 Business Plan, or would qualify as Tier 1 capital
for capital adequacy purposes (requiring still additional capital infusion if it did not),72?
and questions whether Abris would be willing and able to fund the December 2014
Business Plan.”23

In addition, Mr. Caldwell calls into question the comparability of the peer banks
chosen by Mr. Rathbone,’”* as well as Mr. Rathbone’s choice of time periods for
measuring bank growth rates.”25 With respect to the latter, Mr. Caldwell notes that
the original strategy set out in in the Bank’s Investment Committee paper
contemplated a single IPO in 2016 based on 2015 results.”2° Mr. Caldwell considers
that if Mr. Rathbone’s methodology were to be used, but (a) the IPOs were not
postponed until 2017 and 2018 but made in 2016 as once contemplated, and (b) the
July 2014 Business Plan numbers rather than the December 2014 Business Plan
numbers were used, Mr. Rathbone’s suggested gross IPO proceeds of PLN 2.332.6
billion would fall to PLN 1.813.1 billion.”2” (The decline would be even sharper if

historical rather than forward multiples were used.72°).

An additional objection to Mr. hbone’s ion is his addition of the White
Label project to the Bank’s December 2014 Business plan.” Mr. Caldwell still
considered that project to be insufficiently developed to be considered a significant
element of the Bank’s value.”2°

On the other hand, Mr. Caldwell’s challenge to Mr. Rathbone’s treatment of the
Warsaw Receivables in Mr. Rathbone’s methodology is not particularly clear.”24_ Mr.
Caldwell does not apparently accept that Mr. Rathbone fully removed the effects of
the Warsaw Receivables from the Bank’s financial projections due to the fact that the
Receivables had contributed a major component of the book value of the Bank’s
entity and that, but for it, the Bank would have been inadequately capitalized and
would have required an additional equity injection of the same amount.722

From a purely methodological point of view, Mr. Caldwell again rejects Mr.
Rathbone’s wholesale reliance in his model on P/E multiples. He thinks that unless
some consideration is given to the principal alternative method, viz., a “Price-to-Book
Value Multiples,” or P/BV multiples, approach,”?? a valuation is necessarily flawed.

Mr. Caldwell concludes his Report by performing a calculation according to Mr.

Rathbone’s methodology, rather than his own, but utilizing component figures he

79 Caldwell Rpt., paras. 6.2.22-6.2.32. Mr. Rathbone valued the White Label Project opportunity at PLN 363 million

connection with the FM Bank and PBP Bank merger. Caldwell Rpt., paras. 7.3.3-7.3.5.

considers more accurate and realistic than those that Mr. Rathbone employs. This
entails the following:

e First, Mr. Caldwell uses figures from the March 2015 Business Plan rather than
either the July 2014 or December 2014 Business Plan. While the March 2015
Plan shows lower net profit than the December 2014 Plan, Mr. Caldwell states
that this may be attributed not to an adverse impact of the KNF’s actions
(which would have affected the December 2014 Business Plan figures as well)
but to widely acknowledged reduced interest rates.”*4* Mr. Caldwell insists
that, while less optimistic than the December 2014 figures, the March 2015
figures remain unrealistic.73>

e Second, Mr. Caldwell removes the White Label project opportunity for the
reasons given.736

e Third, Mr. Caldwell applies a 13% cost of equity.”7”

e Fourth, Mr. Caldwell applies a 15% IPO discount to the first IPO tranche.”28

495. On the basis of all these adjustments, the discounted cash flow valuation at 31
December 2016 — using Mr. Rathbone’s methodology subject to Mr. Caldwell’s
adjustments — would be PLN 1.034,400 billion. When minority shareholder Mr.
Stepniak’s interest is deducted, the resulting valuation of Claimant’s shares becomes

1.030,100 million. 72°

Andrew Caldwell’s Second Expert Report
496. Like Mr. Rathbone, Mr. Caldwell subsequently submitted a second expert report. In
this report, dated 26 May 2016, Mr. Caldwell, while maintaining 18 November 2014 as

the valuation date, echoes most of the criticisms he had initially leveled at Mr.

Rathbone’s analysis, challenging notably the achievability of the December 2014
Business Plan.
By way of methodology, Mr. Caldwell stands by his position that the AnaCap sale and

earlier transactions in shares of FM Bank PBP and its predecessors are apt

 

comparators, rejecting Mr. Rathbone’s criticisms of that position. He denies that the
disposal process was too abbreviated and compressed or was for related reasons
conducted as a “fire sale.”
While Abris may have had a plan to enhance the value of the bank in the
future, this would only be reflected in the current value to the extent that
potential buyers found the value creation plan credible and were prepared to
pay an increased acquisition price as a result.”“°
Mr. Caldwell claims to have made all the necessary adjustments to the two previous
transactions in FM Bank and PBP Bank shares — viz., the IFC transaction and the IDM
transaction — so that they too are apt comparators.” He notes that the Claimant
itself valued FM Bank PBP at PLN 397.9 million in October 2013,” thus only just
beyond Mr. Caldwell’s projected range of value of between PLN 250 million and PLN
350 million. Mr. Caldwell also stands by his market approach valuation, justifying his
decisions to accept or reject valuations of other banks claimed by Mr. Rathbone to be
comparable.’43

Mr. Caldwell maintains that his income-based projections properly assume moderate,

rather than unduly optimistic, profitability in line with prevailing industry patterns.”

As before, he does not assume an IPO exit, but merely a stable ongoing business to
which he attaches a “terminal value,” based on expected cash flow, growth rate and
risk quantified in light of industry patterns.”> According to Mr. Caldwell, Mr.
Rathbone understates the challenges of growing a retail deposit base”*® and the
Bank’s vulnerability from a liquidity standpoint.’*”

An important feature of Mr. Caldwell’s Second Report are data from 2015 showing, in
his view, that the December 2014 Business Plan projections were indeed over-
ambitious. He notes, first, that the Bank itself reported a loss of PLN 100.8 million in

2015,” thus explaining AnaCap’s determination that it would have to provide a

 

capital injection of PLN 432.9 million.”*° Mr. Caldwell cites further data to the effect

 

that the Bank’s liabilities grew from Q1 2014 to Q2 2015, while net interest income
and net profit decreased, and also that, while the Bank was profit-making in the first
two quarters of 2014, it was loss-making from Q3 2014 to Q2 2015.”° These results
may reflect the persistence of low interest rates and newly introduced Polish usury
regulations.’>2

Mr. Caldwell remains of the view that, even if the value of the Warsaw Receivables

cannot be assessed with exactitude, it cannot be ignored because it remained an asset

of Claimant even after the sale to AnaCap. In his view, to value it only to the extent

of moneys received, as does Mr. Rathbone on Claimant’s instruction, entails double
recovery,’>? and thus some effort should be made to assess its value. Noting that the

Bank rejected the City of Warsaw’s settlement offer of PLN 160 million, Mr. Caldwell

 

ultimately attaches a value of PLN 201.1 million, reflecting the extent to which the
receivable can be expected to be collected.’5>3

As for the White Label project, Mr. Caldwell finds the project to have made very
limited if any progress since his First Report, notwithstanding efforts on Abris’ and FM
Bank PBP’s parts.’>* He thus remains of the view that that it should be excluded from
any calculation of the Bank’s worth.

Mr. Caldwell continues to believe that the discount-to-present-value rate should be
subject to increase on account of a premium to which the Bank would be subject in
borrowing due to its size and history. He thus rejects Mr. Rathbone’s use of an 8.4%
rate in favor of a 13% rate.”> “It is clear ... that Mr. Rathbone’s choice of a COE [cost
of equity] of 8.4% is significantly lower than any of the much larger quoted Polish
banks, all of [which] appear to be well established and mature. A COE of 8.4% is
clearly out of line with any common sense consideration of an appropriate cost of
capital.”75°

Mr. Caldwell notes Mr. Rathbone’s decision, on the basis of a 2012 report, to reduce

IPO costs from 6% to 1%. However, using a later 2014 version of the same report, Mr.

Caldwell raises that 1% figure for IPO costs to 2.05% for the first tranche and 1.09% for
the second.”5”

As in his First Report, Mr. Caldwell finally performs a calculation based on Mr.
Rathbone’s counterfactual approach, but using what Mr. Caldwell considers to be
more reliable figures. As before, he (a) relies on the March 2015 rather than December
2014 Business Plan, (b) excludes earnings from the White Label opportunity, (c)
applies a 13% cost of equity, and (d) applies a 15% IPO discount in relation to the first
IPO tranche. As noted, he now estimates IPO costs as 2.05% on the first tranche and
1.09% on the second. On this basis, Mr. Caldwell arrives at an adjusted counterfactual
Bank valuation of PLN 1.088.9 million.’5®

However, Mr. Caldwell finds that Mr. Rathbone’s calculation is still flawed. First, he
finds that Mr. Rathbone failed to update his P/E multiples, as his First Report indicated

he would. Employing Mr. ‘hb ’ Itip! I i but updating on the basis

 

of new data available in February 2016, Mr. Caldwell arrives at a mean P/E multiple of
12.6x, and uses that figure.”°° He also faults Mr. Rathbone for failing to include
Poland’s bank tax in the maintainable net profit calculation. According to Mr.

Caldwell, if these additional adjustments are made, the resulting valuation is PLN

 

740.2 million, a decrease of PLN 1.1921 billion compared to Mr. Rathbone’s revised

 

valuation of PLN 1.9323 billion. Mr. Caldwell graphs this as follows:

757 2d Caldwell Rpt., para. 5.3.6. Mr. Caldwell also recognizes that, in his Second Report, Mr. Rathbone included an
IPO discount of 12% to the first IPO tranche.

Though, like Mr. Rathbone, Mr. Caldwell updated some of his calculations in light of
information received subsequent to his First Report, his conclusion that Claimant’s
damages fall in the range between PLN 0 million and OLN 100 million remains

unchanged.’®

(c) The Experts’ Post-Hearing Submissions

At the hearing, Mr. Rathbone submitted an updated report (“Third Rathbone Rpt.”)
dated 11 July 2016, in which he undertook to modify his Report in light of recent
market changes as of 4 July 2016. The Tribunal thereupon invited Mr. Caldwell to
submit a supplemental report of his which he did on 2 August 2016 (“Third Caldwell
Rpt.”).

While continuing to rely on the Bank’s December 2014 projections as a source of net
profit information, Mr. Rathbone provided the following: (a) an update of the P/E
multiple for use in his valuation of the Bank (b) an update of the cost of equity, and (c)
an update to his calculation of value to equity based on the revised multiple. He also
opined on the effect of the new bank tax introduced in Poland in 2016.

In Mr. Rathbone’s post-hearing report, he updates P/E multiples as of 4 July 2016,
showing a drop from 16.0x to 14.4x, although, if he continued to use the forward P/E
multiples for Alior Bank, Millennium Bank and Getin Noble Bank, which had become,
15.8x, 10.9x and 13.0x, respectively, the average would have been 13.2x. However,

based on the fact that Bank Millennium and Getin Noble Bank have exposure to Swiss

761 2d Caldwell Rpt., para. 3.4.1.

208

$12.

513.

514.

franc mortgages, he excludes them from consideration, giving him, on the basis of
Alior Bank alone, a P/E multiple of 15.8x, in lieu of the 15.3x figure in his First Report.
Mr. Rathbone continues to employ the 12% discount rate he posited in his Second
Report.

Following more recent reports of Warsaw IPO costs, Mr. Rathbone raises the figure for
IPO expenses to 2% of net IPO proceeds. He also recalculates the cost of equity at
8.65% as compared to 8.32% in his First Report.

Mr. Rathbone argues that the new Polish bank tax does not affect banks operating
under an official remedial plan, and therefore FM Bank PBP would not pay the tax
until 2018 when the five-year remedial plan agreed in 2013 expires, and that in any
event effects of the tax would be significantly mitigated by the banks being able to
pass on the cost to customers.

As a result of the updated information, Mr. Rathbone values FM Bank PBP at PLN

 

illion, as reflected in the following tables.

As a result, Mr. Rathbone calculates Claimant’s losses at PLN 1,898.84 million.

In his supplemental report, dated 2 August 2016, Mr. Caldwell contests certain of Mr.
Rathbone’s assertions. He rejects Mr. Rathbone’s revised P/E multiple as based on a
single comparator (Alior Bank) and faults it for failing to consider a historical earnings
multiple. According to Mr. Caldwell, there was no substantial change in the two
banks’ exposure and, by reducing the sample size in this way, Mr. Rathbone increased
his valuation result, despite a decline in market prices and a reduction in P/E multiples
across the sector. By correcting what he considers an error, Mr. Caldwell reduces the
P/E multiple from 15.8x to 11.3x.762

As for the bank tax, Mr. Caldwell reiterates his contention that it is inconceivable that
the Bank could launch an IPO in 2017 if it were still subject to a remedial plan, so one
can only assume that the remedial measures would be lifted in advance of the 2017
IPO, in which case the Bank tax would be applicable. He also discredits the notion that
the Bank would be able to pass along the tax to its customers.7®

On the basis of adjustments made in his Second Report and the new adjustments
made here, Mr. Caldwell arrives at the following counterfactual-based results for

valuation and losses:

518. Toward the close of the hearings, the Tribunal invited the Experts both to file brief

updated reports and, following that, to address certain questions, doing so, to the

214

519.

extent possible, jointly. Mr. Rathbone filed a supplementary report (“Supp. Rathbone
Rpt.”) on 26 August 2016 and Mr. Caldwell filed his (“Third Caldwell Rpt.”) on 2 August
2016.

In response to the Tribunal’s request that they identify the factors having the greatest
impact on valuation, the Experts submitted a joint memorandum dated 12 September

2016. They identified the key factors as:

Potential Adjustments to the Plan

1. Basis by which to extend the projections to 2018, to the extent that an IPO in 2018 is assumed.
2. Actual performance for Q1 2014
3. Actual performance for Q2 2014

4. Effect of “Project Berlin”: expansion of BankSmart to Germany, approved by Management Board in
August 2014

5. Effect of White Label

6. Impact of interest rate cuts post 14 April 2014

7. Impact of PBP loans that became non-performing.

8. Effect of developments in the Warsaw Compensation Receivable claims

9. Imposition of bank tax in February 2016

10. Any additional capital requirements required as a result of the above adjustments

11. Any additional capital requirements required as a result of increased regulatory capital requirements
applied across the Polish Banking sector.

Valuation Assumptions

12. Appropriate date for market data (30 April 2015 or latest date available)
13. Basis of IPO pricing/multiplier

14, Basis of IPO discount/costs

15. Discount rate/cost of equity

16. Treatment of Warsaw Receivable

17. Other adjustments to valuation in order to arrive at damages

18. Interest rate from 30 April 2015 to date of hypothetical IPO

19. Interest rate from date of hypothetical IPO to date of settlement

The Tribunal had also asked at the close of the hearings, on 20 July 2016, that the
Experts (a) quantify the financial impact of each of the stated factors and (b) identify

the applicable interest rate and source for calculating interest on damages for any

216

521.

523.

losses. On these matters, the Experts submitted separate reports, Mr. Caldwell’s
dated 7 October 2016 (“Fourth Caldwell Rpt.”) and Mr. Rathbone’s dated 8 October
2016 (“Fourth Rathbone Rpt.”).
Importantly, the Experts settled jointly on a single Agreed Financial Model (“Agreed
Model”) for calculating damages, if any. The Agreed Model is described by Mr.
Caldwell as follows:
[The Agreed Model] takes projected net profits for 2014 to 2017 from the
January 2014 business plan (either the basic or the investor version) and makes
a series of adjustments to arrive at a projection of net profits, including those
for 2018. The most significant of these adjustments relate to interest rates and
the Warsaw Receivable. This projection is then used to calculate equity cash
flows (consisting of capital injections and IPO proceeds) which are discounted
at a cost of equity to arrive at a value of the Claimant’s equity at 30 April 2015.
The alleged damages are then calculated by deducting the value received by
the Claimant in the sale to AnaCap and making certain other adjustments.”
The Experts also managed, in a most welcome exercise in good faith, to narrow their
differences on certain disputed points and arrive at agreed figures for a number of the
factors enumerated above.
For example, the Experts agreed on increasing the Bank’s 2014 net profit in the
January 2014 Basic Plan by PLN 2.844 million to reflect FM Bank PBP’s improved actual
performance against budget for the period 1 January 2014 to 8 April 2014.7 They

also agreed that the Bank’s actual performance in Q2 2014 was PLN 8.931 million

against a budget of PLN 4.593 million, a favourable variance of PLN 4.338 million.

217

524.

525.

526.

527.

528.

Since the Q1 and Q2 figures are cumulative, the net favourable variance for Q2 alone
is agreed to be PLN 1.494 million.”

With respect to the Warsaw Receivables, Mr. Rathbone had most recently suggested a
value of PLN 33.0 million, or 15% of its book value. Mr. Caldwell stated that he was
prepared to accept such a write-down of 85%, provided it was accompanied by
recognition of the need for a commensurate capital injection to address the resulting
capital shortfall of PLN 148.4 million.”©7 However, in his Fourth Report, Mr. Rathbone
now believes, based on recent decisions of Polish authorities and the attitudes of all of
the potential buyers, that the Receivables have little or no market value and are to be
fully omitted in the calculation of damages.’®

As for the IPO discount, the Experts compromised and agreed upon an IPO discount
rate of 13.5% and IPO costs of 2.0% in their counterfactual scenarios.”°

In addition, the Experts came to agreement on the methodology for calculating
additional capital requirements, though they disagree on the content and application
of the Tier 1 capital requirements.””°

The Experts further agreed to use the most recent available market data, i.e. data
available on 15 September 2016, even though the Tribunal had designated 30 April
2015 as the valuation date.’ This is agreeable to the Tribunal.

But other differences remain.

In his Fourth Report, Mr. Rathbone made certain assumptions as the basis for his
adjusted counterfactual calculation. He made assumptions in particular about net
profits in 2018,””? arriving at a projected profit for 2018 of PLN 173.02 million.

Mr. Rathbone decided to take into consideration the Bank’s planned expansion of
BankSmart to Polish customers working in Germany, pursuant to the so-called Project
Berlin, a plan approved by the Management Board in August 2014. Project Berlin had
been included in the December 2014 Business Plan and thus in Mr. Rathbone’s
previous valuations. Although the decision to embark upon the project was made

subsequent to the 14 April 2014 KNF decision, Mr. Rathbone considers that it would

7?Mir. Rathbone made the following assumptions in arriving at net profits, He assumed that for 2018 the following

ratios would remain constant as compared to the 2017 projections in the January 2014 Investor Plan: Tier 1 Ratio
(Tier 1 Capital/ Risk Weighted Assets (“RWA”)) and Net Profit as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (“Return on

RWA’).

He also assumed that these other ratios would remain constant for 2018 projections for loans and

advances and for total assets: (a) RWA as a percentage of Loans and Advances; (b) Net Interest Margin (Net
Interest Income/Loans and Advances); and (c) Total Assets as a percentage of RWA.

He continues (4* Rathbone Rpt., paras. 11-14):

My calculation of the projected 2018 net profit of PLN 173.02 million follows the following logical
argument:

(a) The Tier 1 Capital at the end of 2017 was projected to be PLN 485.6 million. This would
increase in 2018 by the 2017 retained profits, once they were approved by the Board at the
annual general meeting. The 2017 net profits were projected in the January 2014 Investor Case
to be PLN 135.6 million, so the 2018 Tier 1 Capital, excluding any additional capital raise, would
be PLN 621.2 million.
(b) The Tier 1 Ratio in 2017 was projected in the January 2014 Investor Case to be 9.2%. Thus |
calculate Risk Weighted Assets at the end of 2018 to be PLN 6,743.6 million, against the balance
projected by the January 2014 Investor Case at the end of 2017 of PLN 5,271.8 million.
(c) Net Profit as a percentage of Risk Weighted Assets (“Return on RWA”) in 2017 was 2.88%
according to the January 2014 Investor Case. Again, assuming that this remained constant during
2018, and using the average RWA for 2018 (i.e. the average of RWA at the start and end of the
year), the net profit for 2018 is PLN 173.02 million.
| believe that these are conservative assumptions, since the January 2015 Investor Case showed
continually rising Return on RWA. In Table 3 below, I have set out the key statistics as well as the growth
rate in profits implied by the above approach. One can see clearly that, as a result of this approach, the
high profit growth projected in the January 2014 Investor Case slows after 2016, and my projected 2018
net profit figure implies an annual growth of just 28%, compared with 85% in the preceding year as per
the January 2014 Investor Plan.

clearly have been approved, since simply taking advantage of new EU passport rules,
and he thus includes both the profits and related capital requirements as adjustments
to the January 2014 Investor Plan.”7?

Although Mr. hb had luded the P/E i of two of his three comparator
banks (Bank Millennium and Getin Noble Bank), subsequent pronouncements by the
Polish Government in August 2016 had lifted the uncertainty over the Swiss Franc
mortgages. As a result, he reverted to his original use of an average P/E across three
comparator banks (Alior Bank, Bank Millennium, and Getin Noble Bank) resulting in a
17.4x forward profit.””4

Mr. Rathbone also adjusted his interest rate figures on the basis that, while they were
in recent decline, the Management Board expected them to rise again in the near to

It should be added, however, that Mr. Caldwell continues to favor other approaches.
He would also consider assuming a full exit in 2017, which he considered more likely,
and notes that Mr. Rathbone had stated that, were the January 2014 business plans to
be adopted with adjustments for lower interest rates, he would model a two-stage
IPO in 2016 and 2017.’7% But even if a two-stage IPO is assumed, Mr. Caldwell
continues to believe that the Plan would have been constrained by the continuing low
interest rate environment and that large capital injections would have been required,
particularly after a substantial write-off of the Warsaw Receivables. On that basis, he
finds that Claimant would have suffered no loss.’7?

Mr. Caldwell prefers using the January 2014 Basic Plan as opposed to the January 2014
Investor Plan, since only the former was approved by the Bank’s Supervisory Board
and since he finds the latter unduly optimistic. But, for completeness, he utilizes both.
Employing the January 2014 Basic and Investor Plans, Mr. Caldwell makes a series of
assumptions consistent with what he considers to be the most likely developments,’®°

and arrives at the following figures to be employed in his counterfactual calculation.

77 4* Caldwell Rpt., para. 3.5.3.
780 The assumptions Mr. Caldwell makes are these:

(I) the loan portfolio will grow by 7% between 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2018, based on
the forecast lending growth for Polish banks in 2018 in an analyst report prepared by JP Morgan
dated 26 February 2016;

(ll) the net interest margin (expressed as net interest income a percentage of the average of total
loans at the year end and total loans at the previous year end) will be equal to that achieved in
2017, based on the fact that the predicted WIBOR rate in 2017 from Bloomberg is materially the
same as the rate in 2018.10 | applied this margin to the average 2017 and 2018 loan portfolio
balances to calculate 2018 net interest income;

(Ill) the net fee and commission income margin will be equal to that achieved in 2017.11 | applied
this margin to the average 2017 and 2018 loan portfolio balances to calculate 2018 net fee and
commission income;

(IV) the net FX result will be equal to the amount earned in 2017;

However, Mr. Caldwell continues to posit declining interest rates in the period
following the January 2014 Plans and to adjust net profits accordingly.”*+

Although the Experts agreed to use the date of 15 September 2016 to measure
earnings and share price, they continue to differ on choice of a P/E multiple.”*2 They
also continue to differ on choice of comparable banks. Also, based on recent data,
Mr. Caldwell rounds up his estimated cost of equity, taking into account a small
company and a company-specific premium, to 13.5%.783

Mr. Caldwell also excludes from consideration the so-called Project Berlin, a plan to
market FM Bank PBP’s mobile banking services to the Polish community living
elsewhere in the EU that was approved by the Management Board in August 2014. He
does so because the Tribunal directed the Experts to consider the Bank’s plans at the
time of the KNF’s First Decision (8 April 2014) in projecting its results and valuation.”®*
He takes the same position with the White Label project.7®>

Mr. Caldwell also adjusts the Bank’s assets in the amount of PLN 43.3 million based on
a Deloitte Report on impairment of the Bank’s non-performing loans. He also assumes

that the Bank would have been required to maintain a Tier 1 capital requirement of

11.25% from 1 January 2016.86 As for the Polish bank tax, Mr. Caldwell continues to
consider it appropriate for inclusion in the counterfactual scenario.’®”

On these bases, Mr. Caldwell calculates a counterfactual value of FM Bank PBP as of
30 April 2015 and adds interest to 31 December 2016, while deducting (a) the amounts
actually received by the Claimants (including in relation to the Warsaw Receivable)
and (b) the counterfactual deferred consideration that would have been paid to IFC.
Turning to damages, Mr. Caldwell makes a calculation based not only on the two-
tranche 2017/2018 IPO to which the Tribunal pointed (relying both on the January
2014 Basic and Investor Plans), but also (a) the January 2014 Basic Plan with a one-
stage IPO in 2017 and (b) the January 2014 Investor Plan with a one-stage IPO in 2017;
and (c) using the January 2014 Investor Plan with a two-stage IPO in 2017 and 2018.

The damages results are as follows:

Clearly, whether a one-stage 2017 IPO or a two-stage 2017/2018 IPO is envisaged, if

the January 2014 Basic Plan is used in the counterfactual, Claimant is actually better

off than it would have been had the alleged expropriation not occurred, and so no
damages would be payable. It would be entitled to damages if the January Investor

Plan were to be used.

In conclusion, Mr. Caldwell suggests that, if additional capital contributions would be
required between April 2015 and the IPO and if Claimant, through its owners Abris
Fund | and Abris Fund Il, lacked sufficient funds to make such contributions, there
would be need of third party contribution, resulting in a dilution of Claimant’s
ownership interest in the Bank. Mr. Caldwell predicts that an additional PLN 435
million in additional outside equity would be required, with Claimant’s investment in
the Bank diluted by at least 50% with a commensurate reduction in the Claimant’s

share of the eventual IPO proceeds. 7°°

(d) Findings of the Tribunal
The Tribunal has found that Respondent deprived the Claimant of essential ownership
rights by suspending the voting rights of the shares and ordering it to sell the shares
and, to that extent, breached its obligations under the BIT.7°° It must accordingly
compensate the Claimant for the resulting loss.
As indicated in its prior instructions to Counsel and the Experts, the Tribunal finds that
the valuation of the FM Bank PBP and the assessment of damages are to be conducted

on the basis of the Agreed Financial Model described more fully below." This

789 4* Caldwell Rpt., para. 7.4.3.

791 See para. 554, infra.

550.

approach basically corresponds to the forward-looking formula which was initially
elaborated by Mr. Rathbone and which figured among the methodologies that Mr.
Caldwell employed.

As concerns the specific values to be assigned to the factors comprising these
formulas, the Tribunal has studied the successive opinions of both Experts in detail,
focusing on their disagreement as to the correct values to be assigned to each. The
Tribunal specifically took into consideration for these purposes the various factors
that the Experts included in their joint list of factors relevant to the valuation of the
Bank and the assessment of Claimant’s loss. Except to the extent that Experts
ultimately reached agreement on a particular variable-specific value, the Tribunal
proceeded on the basis of the reports to determine for itself the value most
appropriately assigned to each of the factors. Each of these decisions is set out and
explained in the subsections of the Award that follow.

However, in consideration of the number of variables involved in these calculations,

ling computational

 

the extreme complexity of the formulas, and the necessity of avoi
error, the Tribunal has decided to give the Experts the opportunity to conduct jointly
the relevant calculations, on the condition that they utilize the formulas prescribed by
the Tribunal’ and, for each factor, the value specifically assigned to it by the Tribunal
in this Award. The Tribunal believes that, having made these determinations, the
Tribunal has placed the Experts in a position to perform fully both the valuation of the

FM Bank PBP and the calculation of compensable damages, and to do so jointly. The

792 See para. 548, supra.

230

Tribunal’s instructions to the Experts in conducting the calculations are elaborated in
greater detail in Procedural Order no. 17 bearing the same date as this Award.

551. The present Award is accordingly issued in the form of a Partial Award, reflecting not
only the Tribunal’s determination on jurisdiction and liability, but also its
determination of the values for each of the variables on the basis of which the
valuation of Claimant’s equity interest in the Bank and the calculation of damages are
to be performed. To that very limited extent, the Tribunal reopens the proceedings,
pursuant to Article 34 of the SCC Rules, which permits reopening of the proceedings
“in exceptional circumstances.”’°3 For the reasons indicated above — the number of
variables involved in these calculations, the extreme complexity of the formulas, and
the necessity of avoiding computational error in determining quantum — the Tribunal
considers the circumstances sufficiently exceptional to warrant following this course
of action.

552. Discussion of each of the relevant parameters follows, with the Tribunal’s specific

determination set out in italics in the final paragraph of each subsection.

Valuation Methodology
553. The Tribunal acknowledges Mr. Caldwell’s emphatic preference for a valuation
methodology based on largely historical considerations (including but by no means
limited to the AnaCap offer) rather than a valuation based on projections. It is true

that the former tend to be less speculative in nature than the latter, but they also tend

793 According to Article 34, “[iJn exceptional circumstances, prior to the making of the final award, the Arbitral
Tribunal may reopen the proceedings on its own motion, or upon the application of a party.”

231

554.

to deny effect to the particular circumstances of a party’s loss, and it is such particular
circumstances that are the most proper touchstones of analysis. Certainly, to take
AnaCap’s offer as a guide to valuation would be inconsistent with the very rationale
upon which liability is imposed in this case, namely the prejudice caused to Claimant
by KNF’s wrongful actions. While the case for relying upon other transactions of a
similar kind or on the performance of presumably comparable actors is stronger than
the case for relying on the AnaCap offer, they too fail to take into consideration the
particular circumstances of Claimant’s loss of expectation in this case.

Rather than abandon a forward-looking methodology based on projections particular
to Claimant and its business plans, the Tribunal prefers to focus on ensuring that, in
conducting such an analysis, adjustments are made where necessary to render
assumptions reasonable. Accordingly, as instructed by the Tribunal, and in accordance
with the Experts’ Agreed Financial Model, the Experts are to employ a counterfactual-
based forward-looking scenario. On the basis of that methodology, the Experts take

as their point of departure the Bank’s January 2014 business plan, using that plan as

 

ani

 

itial basis for valuing net profits for the years 2014 through 2017, coupled with a
projection for 2018, adjusting those figures in various ways to better ensure their
reliability.’%* These projections, as adjusted, are subjected to a P/E multiple,
ultimately resulting in a value that is then discounted by reference to the cost of
equity in order to arrive at a valuation at 30 April 2015. This projection is then

discounted at a cost of equity to arrive at a value of the Claimant’s equity interest at

794 See para. 521, supra.

232

555.

556.

30 April 2015. It is from this valuation, subject to further adjustments, that is
deducted the price paid to Claimant by AnaCap in connection with the sale of the
Bank, to arrive at damages, making allowance of course for the fact of a minority
shareholder in the Bank.”9>

Thus, the bank valuation and damages calculations are to be performed by the Experts

on the basis of the above-described methodology.

Business Plan as Point of Departure
On 20 July 2016, the Tribunal directed the Experts to conduct their valuations of the
Bank on the basis, as starting point, of the Investor Case Plan of January 2014. The
Tribunal selected this date as the latest business plan prior to any possible impact of
the KNF’s decisions addressed to Claimant, the first of which was dated 8 April 2014,
the purpose being to reflect the Bank’s strategies over the next several years (in
particular, but not limited to, development of its retail sector) while at the same time
avoiding distortions to the fullest extent possible. In his fourth and final expert
opinion, Mr. Caldwell urged that, rather than employ the January 2014 Investor Case
Plan, the Tribunal should apply the January 2014 Basic Plan, which he considers more
conservative and which was formally approved by the Supervisory Board. The
Tribunal disagrees. In the Tribunal’s view, the Investor Case Plan corresponds better

than the Basic Plan to the counterfactual-based methodology that the Tribunal also

795 4* Caldwell Rpt., paras. 3.1.2-3.1.3.

233

557.

558.

559.

directed the Experts to employ.’ The Basic Plan, though somewhat forward looking,
represents essentially the formal bank budget for the year 2014 rather than a
projection of what were taken to be reasonable business development prospects
under new management. Moreover, the investor Case Plan is the one that the Experts
principally used in their prior opinions based on the counterfactual-based
methodology.

The Tribunal acknowledges Mr. Caldwell’s concern that the January 2014 Investor
Case Plan may have been unduly optimistic and accordingly has undertaken in the
analysis that follows to take fully into account, as to each factor, the extent to which
Claimant’s projections may be overly optimistic or otherwise unreasonable. That will
be apparent as the analysis proceeds.

Accordingly, the business plan on the basis of which the valuation commences shall be

the January 2014 Investor Case Plan.

Updating of Business Plan with 2018 Projections
The January 2014 Investor Case Plan included projections through 2017, but not
through 2018. The Tribunal finds that the Experts are in agreement that, basically,
constancy between 2017 calculations and 2018 calculations should be posited. For
convenience and clarity, the Tribunal adopts and prescribes the assumptions detailed

in Mr. Caldwell’s Fourth Expert Opinion, as follows:

796 4* Caldwell Rpt, para. 3.1.3.

234

(i) the loan portfolio will grow by 7% between 31 December 2017 and 31
December 2018, based on the forecast lending growth for Polish banks in 2018
in an analyst report prepared by JP Morgan dated 26 February 2016;

(ii) the net interest margin (expressed as net interest income a percentage of the
average of total loans at the year end and total loans at the previous year end)
will be equal to that achieved in 2017, based on the fact that the predicted
WIBOR rate in 2017 from Bloomberg is materially the same as the rate in 2018.
| applied this margin to the average 2017 and 2018 loan portfolio balances to
calculate 2018 net interest income;

(iii) | the net fee and commission income margin will be equal to that achieved in
2017. | applied this margin to the average 2017 and 2018 loan portfolio
balances to calculate 2018 net fee and commission income;

(iv) the net FX result will be equal to the amount earned in 2017;

(v) the cost of risk as a percentage of loan portfolio will be equal to 2017. | applied
this cost of risk ratio to the average 2017 and 2018 loan portfolio balances to
calculate 2018 cost of risk;

(vi) other operating income and costs would be equal to 2017. These relate only to
the Micro Lending business line, and are at a consistent level of PLN 240,000
from 2014 to 2017 in the January 2014 Basic Plan, therefore | forecast the same
cost in 2018;

(vii) | the cost to income ratio would be equal to 2017. | applied this ratio to the net
operating income, after cost of risk, to calculate 2018 operating expenses; and

(viii) | applied a tax rate of 19.5% to the resulting net profit before tax to calculate
net profit after tax. This rate is agreed between Mr. Rathbone and me as the
applicable tax rate for FM Bank PBP.79”

560. The Experts are accordingly instructed to extrapolate projections for 2018 in

accordance with the guidelines set forth in the immediately preceding paragraph.

Adjustment to Actual Performance to 8 April 2014

797 According to Mr. Rathbone:
It is ... reasonable to assume some continued growth, but perhaps not at the same rate. | have decided
that the appropriate way to do this is simply to assume that profits for 2017 will be reinvested in capital
for 2018, and that the returns on that capital will be the same as those returns for 2017. | believe that this
is conservative, since under the January 2014 Investor Case, the Bank’s key return statistics increase each
year rather than remain stable

4* Rathbone Rpt, para. 10.

235

561.

562.

564.

The Tribunal specifically instructed that the January 2015 Business Plan “be adjusted
to make allowance [for] the actual performance of the Bank during the time up to the
First Decision,”’ i.e., for the period from 1 January 2014 to 8 April 2014. As a result,
the Experts agreed to adjust the January 2015 Business Plan to take account of a
“variance to budget” of PLN 2.844 million.’°?

The Experts shall accordingly make an adjustment to actual performance to 8 April

2014 as provided for in the immediately preceding paragraph.

Adjustment for Lower Interest Rates
The Experts are in agreement that interest rates fell significantly in the period
following the January 2014 Business Plan and that that would negatively affect FM
Bank PBP’s profitability. They therefore further agree that the January 2014 Business
Plan’s projection of net profits must be lowered. °°
Mr. Caldwell provides a detailed analysis of the impact of falling interest rates on the
Bank’s profitability and concludes that the adjustment should be determined in

accordance with the following table:°°

margins would have a negative impact of between PLN 37 million and PLN 47 million

 

on profit before tax each year. He then observes that, in consideration of this
reduction in profit, the Bank’s management introduced a series of offsetting cost
savings in personnel and administrative expenses, which he factors in to lessen the
impact. In all fairness, Mr. Rathbone concedes that some of these savings resulted
from measures taken by the KNF which, in a forced sale environment, actually
impeded retention and recruitment and saved money, but for which Claimant should
take no credit. Thus, he takes into account only 50% of the personnel cost savings and
75% of the administrative cost savings as mitigating measures. The justification for
considering these savings is that they stem from actions taken in direct response to
interest rate developments.°”

Mr. Rathbone’s calculation is thus as follows:®°>

567. The Tribunal is not convinced that the personnel and administrative cost savings

568.

569.

invoked can legitimately be used to offset the effect of the interest rate decline,
largely because it views them as insufficiently linked to that decline, because the
evidence supporting these claims of saving is not apparent, and because they were in
fact not reflected in the January 2014 Investor Case Plan..

The Tribunal finds both Experts’ calculations of the profitability effects of the interest
rate decline (with the costs savings offset in Mr. Rathbone’s calculation removed from
consideration) to be equally convincing. Absent a compelling reason to prefer one
Expert’s account over the other’s, the Tribunal orders that the impact of the interest
rate decline be measured as the average for each year of the two Expert’s
assessments of that impact.

The Experts shall accordingly adjust the figures in the January 2014 Business Plan to

reflect the impact of the lower interest rates that followed, using as that figure the

238

570.

571.

572.

average of Mr. Caldwell’s and Mr. Rathbone’s measurements of impact, it being
understood that there is to be no offset in impact to reflect the Bank’s putative
personnel and administrative cost savings as reported by Mr. Rathbone.
Inclusion of Project Berlin

Project Berlin, it will be recalled, refers to the Bank’s plan to market its mobile
banking services to the Polish community living elsewhere in the EU®* and was
approved by the Management Board in August 2014. Mr. Caldwell excludes this
initiative on the ground that, because subsequent to the January 2014 Business Plan,
Project Berlin cannot be taken into consideration in terms of projected profits.2°>

Mr. Rathbone disagrees. He argues that not only was Project Berlin included in the
December 2014 Business Plan and therefore figured into the Experts’ previous
valuations, but more importantly that the initiative was “a perfectly routine business
decision made by management to take advantage of new rules on EU passporting.”°°°
The Tribunal rejects Mr. Caldwell’s objection, noting that Project Berlin was adopted
by the Management Board before the sale of shares and was sufficiently concrete to
justify its inclusion in the Bank’s valuation. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Caldwell
offered no objection, as he did with respect to the White Label Project, to the effect
that launch of the project was altogether too uncertain. In sum, the Tribunal has no

basis for excluding Project Berlin in calculation of net profits.

The Experts shall accordingly take Project Berlin into account in their valuation of the

Bank.

Inclusion of the White Label Project

The question whether the White Label Project should be counted in the valuation of
the Bank has been a live one throughout the proceedings. Mr. Rathbone has
maintained from the start that the Project was sufficiently promising that the profits
associated it should be added to the baseline profit figures drawn from the bank’s
business plan. Thus, for example, Mr. Rathbone stated in his First Opinion that the
Bank’s baseline net profit for 2018, projected to be PLN 137.61m, should be enhanced
by PLN 35.77m, resulting in a maintainable net profit figure of PLN 173.38m.

Mr. Caldwell, by contrast, has been consistently of the view that doubts as to whether
the White Label Project would come to fruition are such that it should be disregarded
in its entirety in assessing the Bank’s maintainable net profit.

In his Second Opinion, Mr. Rathbone insisted that, though project success was not
assured, the value of the White Label Project could not be altogether ignored.
According to him, “simply to say ‘too remote’ is wrong — any true arms’ length buyer
would attribute some value to the option for the White Label Project.”®°” Mr.
Rathbone cites testimony suggesting that Bank officers genuinely and reasonably

believed the project had a high probability of success®°® and that the circle of

580.

interested partners had actually widened.*°° Mr. Rathbone’s views thus have not
faltered over time.*!°

For his part, Mr. Caldwell has remained skeptical, noting the scarce evidence over time
that the Project had seriously advanced.®" Significant for him is the fact that the
Project lacks Board approval or incorporation in any business plan, and that a similar
project, contemplating a joint venture with a different mobile telephone company,
likewise has faltered.®12

The Tribunal finds the anticipated profit attributed to the White label Project to be
highly speculative, especially in light of its apparently slow progress over time. While
the possibility of success might, in theory, justify attaching some value to this
prospective asset, the Tribunal has simply no basis for doing so. It accordingly
disregards the Project in calculating the Bank’s maintainable net profit figure.

The Experts are instructed to leave the White Label project out of consideration in

their valuation of the Bank.

Inclusion of Warsaw Receivables as Bank Asset
The difficulties associated with the Warsaw Receivables have been canvassed
repeatedly in connection with the Parties’ argumentation and the Experts’ opinions.

Treatment of the Receivables is complicated by the fact that they arise both in the

valuation of the Bank and in assessment of Claimant’s losses. In this section, the
Award deals only with the former.

The financial statements of FM Bank PBP for the year ending 31 December 2014 were
signed off by the Management Board on 27 May 2015 with the Warsaw Receivables
shown as included at full book value, with no impairment. This was done on the basis
of an independent valuation from a major accounting firm and signed off on by both
Bank management and the auditors. Moreover, on 16 October 2015, Claimant was
obliged to purchase the Warsaw Receivables at full book value as part of the forced
sale of the Bank to AnaCap, which did not want the asset.®43 For these reasons,
according to Mr. Rathbone, it was proper for the January 2014 Business Plan to
include the Warsaw Receivables at full book value. This is because, in the
counterfactual scenario, the asset would either have been recovered or would have
been considered recoverable at the time of the IPO.®44

However, this is where treatment of the Receivables at the damages calculation phase
enters the picture. As will be seen,®> the Experts have reached agreement, for
purposes of computing Claimant’s loss, on a valuation of the Receivables at 15% of
book value or PLN 33.0 million, and the Tribunal accepts that determination. That
being the case, the Tribunal does not see any reason why the same value should not

be attributed to the Receivables in the valuation of the Bank.

814 4 Rathbone Rpt, para. 36.
815 See para. 618, infra.

242

583.

584.

585.

Account must still be taken of the fact, consistently emphasized by Mr. Caldwell, that
the Bank’s financials recorded the Warsaw Receivables PLN 220.0 million book value
as an asset. But if the asset were written off to the tune of 85%, that would require an
immediate offsetting capital injection in order for FM Bank PBP to remain within its
required capital limits. According to Mr. Caldwell, Tier 1 equity of PLN 148.4 million
would need to be injected to compensate for the Warsaw Receivables impairment.®*¢
Though the Tribunal finds considerable merit in Mr. Caldwell’s contention, it is not
comfortable simply assuming that the additional capitalization required would
necessarily be of the same amount as the reduced value of the Receivables. The
Tribunal thus favors a somewhat more conservative assumption that additional Tier 1
equity of PLN 100 million would need to be injected.

Accordingly, the Experts shall include the Warsaw Receivables as assets of the Bank,
however assigning them a value, for Bank valuation purposes, of PLN 33.0 million.
However, the Experts must also assume that Claimant would be required to inject PLN
100 million in additional Tier 1 equity. That factor must either be taken into account
either here or in connection with computation of Claimant’s loss (see paragraphs 619-

620, infra).

Adjustment for Impairment of Loans

Mr. Caldwell insists that the January 2014 Business Plan be further adjusted to

recognize the impairment of loans that were identifiable as non-performing between

816 4* Caldwell Rpt, para. 4.3.55.

243

587.

FOR ATTORNEYS' EYES ONLY

January 2014 and April 2015. \
ES

Mr. Rathbone, using the Bank’s own reports, identifies three corporate loans as
impaired. He then compares the cost of risk actually charged in the 2015 financial
statements (PLN 127.54 million) with the cost of risk projected in the January 2014
Business Plan for 2015 (PLN 99.49 million), concluding that the difference of PLN 28.05
million is the maximum additional loss that could be attributable to reclassified loans.
Deducting 19.5% tax relief from the maximum loss yields a net downward adjustment
of PLN 22.70 million.®1°

The Tribunal sees no reason to adopt the most “pessimistic” of the figures supplied by
Deloitte, as Mr. Caldwell proposes. It finds more persuasive Mr. Rathbone’s separate
and detailed calculation resulting in a number within the Deloitte range. The Tribunal

accordingly assesses the loan impairment value at PLN 28.05 million. However, the tax

819 4 Rathbone Rpt, paras. 32-33.

588.

589.

590.

savings realized as a result of the non-performance of the loans must also be taken
into account in mitigation of the loss.

The Experts are accordingly instructed to value the Bank’s loan impairment at PLN
28.05, subject specifically to a deduction from that loss of tax relief at the rate of

19.5%.

Bank Tax
A question newly raised in Mr. Caldwell’s Second Report concerns the then recently
enacted Polish bank tax. Mr. Rathbone initially ignored the new tax because it had
not been approved and because there was to be an exemption for banks subject to
remedial plans. However, Mr. Caldwell was able to point out in his second report that
the tax bill was in fact signed into law in January 2016. According to Mr. Caldwell, the
bank tax formula is the following:

0.44% x (total assets — PLN billion size threshold — Treasury Bonds and Bills —
Equity).82°

Mr. Rathbone affirms that “it is unlikely that FM Bank PBP’s results would be
significantly affected by the tax, and ... thus excluded it from [his] calculations.”821 He
thus considers the tax as irrelevant to the Bank’s valuation. First, he maintains that
recognition of the claimed exemption was obvious from reading the statutory
language itself. He also argues that, even if the tax were levied on the Bank, it would

be able simply to “pass along” the tax to the Bank’s customers. (Mr. Caldwell

80 2d Caldwell Rpt, paras. 5.5.5.
®1 2d Rathbone Rpt, para. 25.

245

591.

592.

disagreed that the Bank could pass the tax along to customers due to Poland’s anti-

usury restrictions, which limit allowable interest rates to twice the statutory rate of

interest (currently 5%)).822

As it turns out, Mr. Rathbone is correct in his assertion that the new bank tax will have

no application to FM Bank PBP because it does not apply to banks under a remedial

plan.®23 On its face, the Bank is not subject to the tax.

Mr. Caldwell also called into question the notion of an exemption for banks subject to

remedial plans®”*:
I do not see it as a credible scenario where FM Bank PBP would launch an IPO
while still operating under a remedial plan. Were the Claimant to go ahead
with an IPO in such a scenario, this would inevitably raise serious concerns
among investors as to why the remedial plan was in place, what restrictions it
placed on the bank’s ability to operate freely, and what was the risk that such
restrictions would not be lifted in the future. If the remedial plan restrictions
were still in effect in 2017 and the Claimant had decided to press on with an
IPO, regardless of the effect on investors’ appetite for the Bank’s shares, then
there would need to be a significant pricing discount, in addition to the 12%
IPO discount applied by Mr. Rathbone. This additional discount has not been
allowed for in his calculations. | therefore consider an IPO in 2017 would not be
plausible unless the restrictions had already been lifted, in which case the bank
tax would apply and Mr. Rathbone’s point would be negated.®25

Mr. Caldwell’s contention cannot, however, be maintained. First, it cannot be

assumed that a remedial plan would cease to be in effect. Second, the impact of a

remedial plan on prospective buyers’ readiness to buy cannot be known. Any such

effect would depend not only on the content and terms of the plan, but also on an

assessment of the constraints on bank operations that such a plan imposes.

The Tribunal concludes that the bank tax is to be excluded from consideration in the

Experts’ conduct of the valuation.

Maintainable Profit Adjustment

Now that the principal items of inclusion and exclusion from the net profit calculation
have been determined, it is appropriate to ask whether some general allowance
should be made for the fact that the January 2014 Investor Plan is predominantly
based on projections of increased profits that are, by their nature, speculative. From
the beginning, the Experts have debated whether the projections in that Plan were
realistic.

In his Second Report, Mr. Rathbone mounted a spirited defense of his reliance on the
projections, arguing that Mr. Caldwell focused too heavily on the Bank’s depressed
earnings in early 2014 and more generally on the period during and immediately after
the merger. In his opinion, Mr. Caldwell had given too little attention either to the
Bank’s new and vigorous management operating under a new remedial plan that had
the KNF’s approval or to various indications of the Bank’s serious turnaround.®2° He
similarly found that Mr. Caldwell focused excessively on the difficulties associated
with one of FM Bank PBP’s predecessors (PBP Bank) and too little on the superior
record of the other (FM Bank).°2”

More generally, Mr. Rathbone considered Mr. Caldwell to have greatly overstated the

challenges facing the Bank and sought, with some effectiveness, to rebut each of the

6 2d Rathbone Rpt, para. 165.
®27 2d Rathbone Rpt, para. 162.

247

597.

bases of Mr. Caldwell’s more negative assessment. Thus, to Mr. Caldwell’s assertion
that the Bank lacked a market presence in retail, Mr. Rathbone cited testimony by Mr.
Boksa offering evidence of visible success in that sector.®2® Mr. Rathbone found that,
in his stated concern over the Bank’s historical credit loss performance, Mr. Caldwell
unfairly overlooked the new risk management structures and processes that had been
put in place,®29 largely pursuant to KNF recommendations.®*° In Mr. Rathbone’s
opinion, Mr. Caldwell similarly overlooked the Bank’s well-documented response to
its informational technology challenge.®* As for overall growth in income from
banking operations, Mr. Rathbone cited evidence that the Bank was demonstrably
emerging from a period of poor results immediately following the merger.

While Mr. Rathbone considered Mr. Caldwell to have underestimated the Bank’s
progress, Mr. Caldwell considers Mr. Rathbone to have overestimated them. In his
Second Report, Mr. Caldwell maintained his skepticism, citing various indicators of the
Bank’‘s relatively poor health.2?2. On this occasion, he underscored what he regarded
as the Bank’s particular vulnerability from a liquidity standpoint, due to its heavy
dependence on internet deposits and the high degree of concentration among
depositors, with over 30% of deposit sourced from the Bank’s top ten depositors.®?3

He also reported a higher incidence of loan impairment than expected.®*4 All in all, Mr.

Caldwell considers the Bank’s anticipated growth “highly ambitious when viewed in
comparison with the other Polish banks that Mr. Rathbone considers comparable.”®?>
There would necessarily be a considerable challenge for the Bank in launching a new
stand-alone retail business division upon which so much of the Bank’s earnings were
predicated.®2° The Tribunal agrees with Mr. Caldwell’s suggestion that Investors
would necessarily be cautious in light of the Bank’s need to expand rapidly into new
customer segments under new technological circumstances.®3”

Mr. Caldwell also questions the ease with which the Bank could achieve the required
infusions of Tier 1 capital, as planned, through the issuance of subordinated debt in
the large amounts anticipated. Mr. Rathbone contends that either there is enough
capital available or, if not, it would be provided by the shareholders as needed to
maintain the appropriate ratio.®?® However, there remains some uncertainty whether
the required amounts could be raised in the quantity and at the pricing projected, and
apparently even some uncertainty as to whether all such subordinated debt would
qualify as Tier 1 capital. *°°

In his First Report, Mr. Rathbone suggested that business plan figures might have been
more favorable but for the adverse actions taken by the KNF.®“° However, it was to
avoid that very distortion that the Tribunal has directed the experts to a business plan

that precedes the KNF’s interventions.

603.

To be clear, Mr. Caldwell does not take the view that the Business Plan goals are
impossible, or unachievable or unprecedented among banks. He simply considers
them overly optimistic.2+

Although the Tribunal adheres to the counterfactual forward-looking methodology
advanced by Mr. Rathbone, on the ground that it is best suited to reflect the Bank’s’
actual promise under new circumstances, it nevertheless takes note of the fact that
Mr. Caldwell’s alternative methodologies yielded markedly lower valuations.®*? As Mr.
Caldwell calculates it, a transaction-value-based approach yields between PLN 83.1m
and PLN 357.8m, while market approach yields a valuation range of between PLN
233.0m and PLN 320.9m*3 and an income approach yields values in the range
between PLN 256.1m and PLN 264.0m.*4 These estimations present the distinct
advantage of being based on actual transactions, and that is their strength. They
promise a kind of “reality check.” On the other hand, however, they also assume
comparabilities across a sector and over time, while de-emphasizing any given
economic actor’s distinctive features, circumstances, and strategies.

In this section of the Award, which dwells on the factors that the Experts jointly
consider most important in valuating the FM Bank PBP, the Tribunal has proceeded
systematically on a factor-by-factor basis, taking into consideration Mr. Caldwell’s

legitimate concerns and making adjustments with a view to achieving more sober and

605.

realistic projections. It has done so in connection with both the factors treated in
previous subsections and the factors treated in the sections that immediately follow.
Notwithstanding this effort on the Tribunal’s part to strike an appropriate balance in
its consideration of each valuation factor, the Tribunal cannot be sure of fully
capturing the element of uncertainty in the projections upon which the valuation in
this case is based. The Tribunal notes that Mr. Rathbone himself made certain
concessions that would support a modest lowering of the Bank’s projections. Thus, he
acknowledged not only the general uncertainty associated with of projections, but
also the fact that quite different results would emerge if different IPO dates and/or
different business plans were used as points of departure.®4°

These considerations lead the Tribunal to the conclusion that, in light of the
uncertainties, it is only fair and appropriate to adjust FM Bank PBP’s net profit figure
somewhat downward, albeit conservatively. It believes that, combined with the
factor-specific adjustments detailed in this section, such a reduction will yield a more
realistic result. It accordingly concludes that, in addition to those factor-specific
adjustments, the net profit figure ultimately arrived at should be reduced by a 10%
margin. Any such percentage is necessarily somewhat arbitrary, but a reduction of
this magnitude will, in the Tribunal’s overall assessment, yield a sounder and fairer

outcome.

The experts are asked, after having made all categorical adjustments to business plan
projections, and before applying the P/E multiple, to reduce the net profit figure by

10%.

The P/E Multiple
Although the Experts have changed over time the P/E multiple they are willing to
employ in the valuation, at no point in time have they agreed on a figure.
In his First Report. Mr. Rathbone considered the forward-looking P/E multiples of the
three best comparator banks (Alior Bank, Getin Noble Bank and Millenium Bank)
listed on the Warsaw Stock Exchange as of 20 July 2015. Their average P/E multiple
was 15.3x,846 a figure falling below the median, 15.6x, of all Polish banks. Mr.
Rathbone promised to update the multiples at a later point to reflect the latest
available data.®47
Mr. Caldwell initially objected, preferring that historical P/E multiple be introduced as
a reality check.*4® However, in his Second Report, Mr. Caldwell chose to follow Mr.
Rathbone’s method of analysis, based on data as of 17 February 2016 from the same
three comparator banks. On that basis, Mr. Caldwell arrived at an average forward
P/E multiple of 12.6x.°4?
There followed considerable changes of opinion. In his Third Report, Mr. Rathbone

eliminated from consideration both Getin Noble Bank and Bank Millenium, due to the

fact that they, unlike FM Bank PBP, held Swiss franc mortgages which appeared to
operate as a liability under Polish law. That left Mr. Rathbone with a single
comparator bank — Alior Bank — resulting in an assumed P/E multiple of 15.8x, a
multiple that Mr. Rathbone described as conservative.®°° Mr. Caldwell strongly
objected, reminding Mr. Rathbone that he himself had previously impugned the
notion that reliable assessments can be made on the basis of a single comparator.®**+
Mr. Caldwell found the 15.8x figure particularly inapt, given Mr. Rathbone’s own
admission that, between 2014 and 2016, the median P/E multiple for his original list of
nine “selected banks” had fallen from 15.6x to 14.0x, and the median of all listed
banks had fallen from 16.0x to 14.4x..85 The two banks he eliminated from
consideration, Getin Noble Bank and Millennium Bank, had P/E multiples in 2016 of
13.0x and 10.9x, respectively, which, if combined with the Alior Bank figure, would
produce an average of 13.2x. Mr. Caldwell convincingly points out that Mr. Rathbone
was already taking the Swiss Franc mortgage issue into account in his First Report
when he had included all three banks as “those [banks] whose business seems closest
to that of FM Bank PBP,”®>? and that the intervening period between his First and
Third Reports had not brought any major changes in that regard.°5*

As it turns out, the Polish Government ultimately decided not to require banks to pay
for foreign exchange losses on Swiss franc mortgages, with the result that Mr.

Rathbone reincorporated the two excluded banks into his analysis and arrived, using

updated data, at a median P/E multiple of 17.4x.°°5 However, Mr. Rathbone expressly
conceded that this figure was very much a matter of judgment and was necessarily
heavily contingent on market movements. He also expressly allowed that the Tribunal
might want to take a more “long distance” approach and rely on the banking sector
average P/E over the last ten years of around 15.0x.85°

All things considered, and in light of the wide fluctuations in figures over time, the
Tribunal does in fact find itself more comfortable with a longer-term figure such as
15.0x, which also happens to fall between the two Experts’ extreme numbers.

The Tribunal accordingly directs the Experts to employ in the valuation they perform a

P/E multiple of 15.0x.

Warsaw Receivables as Claimant Asset
With the final bank valuation figure in hand, one can turn to valuation of Claimant’s
loss. That figure must of course be reduced to reflect the proceeds of sale to AnaCap
in the amount of PLN 29,878,410. But, in addition, Claimant must account for the
value of the Warsaw Receivables of which it became the owner upon AnaCap’s refusal
to purchase it.
The Warsaw Receivables having been excluded from net profits, and thus from the

basic Bank valuation, the question arises as to how they should be treated in the

 

 

context of the AnaCap tr: i Mr. ‘hb: ation of

 

itially

the Receivables at that stage as well, precisely because AnaCap refused to purchase

them and paid no value corresponding to them. The asset, he concluded, had little or
no value.

Mr. Caldwell initially disagreed, insisting that, even if AnaCap refused to buy the asset,
the fact remained that Claimant thereby retained it, and must account for its book
value.

In his Second Report, Mr. Rathbone made a modest concession, acknowledging that it
would be appropriate to lessen Claimant’s loss by a factor reflecting the Receivables’
actual fair market value.®*” Finding it impossible to identify with any confidence the
fair market value of the Receivables, Mr. Rathbone was prepared simply to include in
the calculation, as a diminution of loss, any proceeds actually that Claimant might
receive in relation to the Receivables.

In his Second Report, Mr. Caldwell adduced evidence suggesting that the Warsaw
Receivables have actual value. He cited a legal opinion from the law firm of Hogan
Lovells, dated 13 June 2014, in which the firm assessed the probability of success in
litigation as “significantly exceeding 50%.”*°8 He also noted that Claimant rejected a
settlement offer of PLN 160m made by the City of Warsaw.®*? Indeed, Mr. Rathbone
himself admitted that Alior Bank had expressed a willingness during the bidding

process to buy the Receivables at 15% of book value.®© Finally, Mr. Caldwell observes

 

that the Bank’s D ber 2014 i Plan had d the ivables as an

 

element of its capitalization position, without which it would have exhibited a

1 shortfall. i di id that the Warsaw Receivables

 

 

had significantly diminished in value, as compared to its book value of PLN 220m, in
his Second Report Mr. Caldwell maintained his position that the full book value should
be deducted from PL Holdings’ claimed losses.®*

Eventually, however, Mr. Rathbone’s agreed to value the Warsaw Receivables at 15%
of their book value, or PLN 33.0 million, a proposition in which Mr. Caldwell
eventually concurred.®® The Tribunal accepts that valuation.

Mr. Caldwell, however, is still unwilling to overlook the fact that the Bank’s financials
recorded the Warsaw Receivables PLN 220.0 million book value as an asset. If the
asset were written off to the tune of 85%, that would require an immediate offsetting
capital injection in order for FM Bank PBP to remain within its required capital limits.
According to Mr. Caldwell, Tier 1 equity of PLN 148.4 million would need to be
injected to compensate for the Warsaw Receivables impairment.®*

The Tribunal has already dealt with the probable capitalization shortfall, finding that

ion would be

 

an injection of additional capital in the amount of PLN 100 mi
required.*°> The need for that injection should not however be taken into account
twice. The Tribunal leaves it to the Experts to decide whether that adjustment is more
appropriately made in the context of the Bank’s valuation (as suggested at paragraphs
580-584, supra) or in connection with the calculation of Claimant’s loss (in which case

it would be taken into account here).

622. There is one caveat. In his Fourth Report, Mr. Rathbone states:
| am instructed that the Claimant has made an offer to surrender the rights
under the usufruct claims if the Respondent agrees that no deduction will be
made to damages for the Warsaw Receivable in the arbitration. In this way, the
Claimant will be made whole but any risk of double recovery will be avoided. If
this offer is accepted, then the asset should be valued at nil in the damages
calculation, because it will be transferred to the Respondent. On the basis that
this offer is still open, and on the basis that the Claimant has repeatedly
assured the Tribunal that it will not seek double recovery in respect of the
Warsaw Receivable, | have consequently attributed no value to the Warsaw
Receivable in calculating my damages.®©
623. However, the Tribunal is unaware of the status of the offer by Claimant described by
Mr. Rathbone and cannot therefore assume that it stands and will be accepted.
Should the Experts agree that the offer stands and would be accepted, then in
principle they should attribute no value to the Warsaw Receivables either for
purposes of valuating the Bank or for reducing Claimant’s net losses.
624. Accordingly, in assessing Claimant’s losses, the Experts must deduct the amount of
PLN 30.0 million, as the agreed upon value of the Receivables of which Claimant
retains ownership. The only circumstance in which this deduction is not to be made is if

Claimant’s offer to transfer the Receivables to Respondent, reported in paragraph 621,

supra, still stands and Respondent accepts it.
IPO Discount

625. Mr. Caldwell has suggested that the anticipated IPO proceeds, at least in the first

tranche, should be subject to an IPO discount even before discount to present values is

866 4 Rathbone Rpt, paras. 54-55.

257

performed.®®” He explains that the counterfactual analysis followed by Mr. Rathbone
assumes that all retained profit in any given year would be contributed to capital in
the following year, with the result that shareholders would receive no dividends. Mr.
Caldwell insists that the prospect of an absence of dividends over a prolonged period
would cause a prospective buyer of the Bank to lower its valuation. Citing literature
on IPO discounts, Mr. Caldwell, proposes a discount figure of 15%.°*

Mr. Rathbone came around to Mr. Caldwell’s view that an IPO discount should be
applied, due to the lack of a history of good information about the Bank and the
likelihood that Claimant would feel it needed to give a special incentive to buy.
However, he agreed to an IPO discount of 12% only.®®

Ultimately, however, the Experts themselves compromised and agreed on an IPO
discount of 13.5%.°7°

Thus, in calculating Claimant’s loss, the Experts shall subject the valuation of the bank

to an IPO discount of 13.5%.

IPO Costs

To avoid any unjust enrichment, and to act in keeping with the counterfactual
scenario, the Tribunal must deduct from Claimant’s losses all transaction costs

associated with the two IPOs, including notably underwriting costs, on the one hand,

and legal and accounting fees, on the other. Mr. Rathbone initially estimates those as
5% for the former and 1% for the latter, for a total of 6%,°”1 In his Second Report, Mr.
Rathbone reduced the IPO cost factor from 6% to 1% due to his learning that it is
highly unusual to pay underwriting fees on IPOs in Poland.®”? Mr. Caldwell, citing a
more recent study, proposed IPO costs of 2.05% in connection with the first IPO
tranche and 1.09% in connection with the second.®73

As in the case of the IPO discount, however, the Experts ultimately agreed on a
common IPO cost figure, settling on a cost of 2.0% for each tranche.”

Accordingly, Claimant’s damages are to be reduced to reflect projected IPO costs at

the rate of 2% per IPO tranche.

Discount Rate

The Experts agree that, in order to arrive at a quantum in this case, the future cash
flows stemming from the counterfactual IPOs must be reduced to present value. Both
Experts base this rate in principle on the cost of equity.

Mr. Rathbone initially selected as the cost of equity 8.40%, arrived at by totaling three
components: risk-free rate (3.19%), equity risk premium (5.20%) and adjusted beta
(1.01 %).8’5 Based on later market data, he raised the cost of equity to 8.65%.°76

Mr. Caldwell posited a somewhat higher discount rate. Much of the difference

appears to stem from his including in the cost of equity two additional components,

namely a “small company premium,” reflecting smaller companies’ relatively greater
difficulty accessing funds, and a “company-specific premium,” reflecting additional
difficulties that any particular small company might, on account of its peculiar
circumstances, encounter. With those additional components included, Mr. Caldwell
arrives at a cost of equity of between 11.7% and 14%, settling on a figure of 13%.°””
Mr. Rathbone regards use of both the small company premium and the company-
specific premium as discredited in the literature, citing in particular Professor
Damodaran (relied upon for other purposes by Mr. Caldwell), who described those
premiums as no longer relevant.278

The Tribunal is comfortable with Mr. Caldwell’s inclusion of a modest small company
supplement, but not the further inclusion, on top of that, of a company-specific
supplement. The Tribunal prefers remaining in the suggested range of 9.75 to 11%,
and sees no reason to elevate that figure beyond 9.75%

In discounting future cash flows to present value, the Experts are to use a discount

rate of 9.75%.

The preponderance of the scientific evidence suggests that the use of a company-specific risk premium cannot be
admissible as expert testimony because the use is not reliable. In particular, current practitioner techniques that
incorporate a company-specific risk premium into cost-of-capital applications fail all four judicial checks for reliability
of testimony. Thus our paper serves as a warning to valuation experts about the dangers associated with including a
CSRP in their cost-of-capital models.

In his Fourth Report, Mr. Caldwell for the first time states that it is necessary to
determine to what extent, if any, Claimant’s ownership (expressed as a percentage of
total equity) would have changed between January 2014 and the IPO. Mr. Caldwell
asks in effect (a) whether additional capital contributions would be required, (b)
whether the Claimant, through Abris Fund | and Abris Fund Il, would have had had
sufficient funds to provide such capital contributions, and (c) what the impact would
be in terms of share ownership if there were a shortfall and Claimant were required to
resort to third party contributions, thus diluting its share ownership.
Given the obvious and significant requirement for further equity capital, in my
opinion it would be incorrect to assume that the Claimant would provide 100%
of this requirement without strong evidence of its ability to do so, including
details of its concentration limits, commitments to other investments, and
confirmation of no other formal or informal restrictions. The impact of third
party investment being required would be significant, as it would be based on
much lower valuations than the IPO, being much earlier in FM Bank PBP’s
development stage than the IPO, and the investment would be in response to a
capital shortfall, and therefore be an urgent requirement which would leave
the existing owners in a weak negotiating position.879
Because it views this consideration as largely an afterthought and in any event so
inherently speculative, the Tribunal declines to assume any further dilution of
Claimant’s shareholdings in FM Bank PBP.

Accordingly, apart from the dilution traceable to Mr. Stepniak’s minority interest in

the Bank (see paragraph 640, infra), no dilution of share ownership is to be assumed.

The Minority Shareholder’s Interest

Due to its not being the sole shareholder of FM Bank PBP, Claimant would not in any
event be entitled to the entirety of the proceeds of the sale to AnaCap. The minority
shareholder, Mr. Stepniak, holds a 0.41% interest in the Bank. Claimant is therefore
entitled only to an amount equal to 99.59% of the proceeds.

Accordingly, the loss valuation must be reduced by the value corresponding to Mr.

Stepniak’s 0.41% shareholding interest in the Bank.

B. Is Claimant Entitled to Recover Interest and, if so, in what Amount?

(a) Claimant’s Position

Claimant does not seek pre-award interest of any kind. However, it seeks post-award
interest, i.e., interest accruing from the date of rendition of this Award until payment
of the Award.

Mr. Rathbone is of the view that interest should be charged on any award at the
discount rate (cost of equity) up to the date of the hypothetical IPO, i.e., 30 April 2017,
thereby making Claimant whole in terms of what it would have received had the IPOs
gone ahead. In his First Report, he posited 8.40% as the cost of capital and thus as the
appropriate rate of interest for this period, while allowing that a somewhat lower rate
might appropriately be applied to the periods following 30 April 2017 and 30 April
2018, in the event the award is not paid by then, since, under the counterfactual
scenario, Claimant would have converted its investment into cash, which would earn a

lower rate of return.®®° In his Fourth Report, Mr. Rathbone states more specifically

880 Rathbone Rpt., paras. 217-218.

262

645.

646.

647.

that interest for the periods following 30 April 2017 and 30 April 2018 should be

charged at the Polish statutory rate of interest. Under Article 481 of the Polish Civil
Code, interest for default in payment is computed as the sum of the reference rate of
the National Bank of Poland plus 5.5 percentage points. As the reference rate is
currently 1.5%, the current interest rate on defaults would be 7.0%.

According to Claimant, the prevailing practice of investor-State tribunals is to award
compound rather than simple interest,8®! and there is no reason to deviate from that

practice in this case. Thus, interest should be calculated on a compound basis.

(b) Respondent’s Position
According to Respondent, even if it is held liable in damages to Claimant and obligated
to pay any post-award interest that accrues, such interest must be calculated on a
simple, rather than d, basis. d does not, h , propose that
any specified rate of interest be used.
Respondent’s Expert, Mr. Caldwell finds that, in the event damages are awarded,

interest should be applied from 30 April 2015 to the date of award. As for applicable

881 Claimant cites the award in the case of Gemplus v. Mexico, Exh. CLA-121, paras. 16-26, as follows:

{I{t is clear ... that the current practice of international tribunals (including ICSID) is to award compound
and not simple interest. In the Tribunals opinion, there is now a form of ‘jurisprudence constante’ where
the presumption has shifted from the position a decade or so ago with the result that it would now be
more appropriate to order compound interest, unless shown to be inappropriate in favour of simple
interest, rather than vice-versa.

Claimant also cites Ripinsky and Williams, Damages in International Investment Law (BIICL, 2008), Exh. CLA-220, p.
387, as follows:

As far as international investment law is concerned, there has been a reversal of the presumption of
simple interest: a significant number of recent tribunal decisions provide a strong indication that
compound interest has come to be treated as the default solution. This may be due to the nature of
economic activity of the claimants in investor-State disputes and strong theoretical support for granting
compound interest in such cases.

interest rate and its source, he considers that the most appropriate rate to apply in
this case is a risk-free rate based on the yields on Polish government bonds. On that
basis, he posits a rate of 1.64%. He concedes that if the Polish statutory interest rate
were to be used, that rate for the period between 30 April 2015 and 31 December

2015 was 8%, a figure that dropped to 5% on 1 January 2016.°2

(c) Findings of the Tribunal
The Tribunal considers that the most appropriate interest rate for post-award interest
in this case is the rate designated by Polish law for interest on overdue debts. Article
481 of the Polish Civil Code prescribes an interest rate for those purposes consisting of
the reference rate of the National Bank of Poland plus 5.5 percentage points. The
current reference rate being 1.5%, post-award interest on this Award shall be paid at a
rate of 7.0%. The Tribunal has been shown no reason why interest should be payable

on other than a simple basis.

COSTS AND FEES

The matter of the allocation between the Parties of costs and fees in connection with

this proceeding shall be determined in the Final Award in this case.

In view of the foregoing, the Tribunal rules as follows:

A. Claimant is entitled to a declaration that Respondent committed a breach of its

obligations under Article 4(1) of the Treaty on account of its expropriation of
Claimant’s shareholdings in FM Bank PBP through restrictions taking the form of a
suspension of its voting rights and the compulsory sale of shares.

Claimant is entitled to compensation of losses due to Respondent’s expropriation
of Claimant’s shareholdings in FM Bank PBP through restrictions taking the form of
a suspension of its voting rights and the compulsory sale of shares. The amount of
compensation will be determined on the basis of the specific values assigned in
this Partial Award to the factors upon which valuation of the FM Bank PBP and
Claimant’s losses depend under the methodology prescribed in this Partial Award.
Computation of the value of FM Bank PBP and Claimant’s losses shall be
performed jointly by the Experts appointed by the Parties in this case and in
accordance with the provisions of Procedural Order no. 17 dated 24 June 2017.
These amounts shall be included in the Final Award issued in this case.

Claimant is entitled to post-award interest on the amount of liability to be
determined in the Final Award from the date of that Award until its full

satisfaction at the rate of 7% computed on a simple basis.

. The allocation of responsibility for costs and fees (including attorneys’ fees) will be

determined in the Final Award issued in this case.

E. Neither Party is entitled at this time to any additional relief.
