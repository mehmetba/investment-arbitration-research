Petition to Enforce Arbitral Award

Petitioners Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.A.R.L. (formerly Antin Infrastructure
Services Luxembourg S.A.R.L.) and Energia Termosolar B.V. (formerly Antin Energia
Termosolar B.V.) bring this action to enforce an arbitral award (the “Award”) issued on June 15,
2018 in ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31 against Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain (“Spain”),
following arbitration proceedings conducted in accordance with the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (the “ICSID
Convention”). Pursuant to Article 54 of the ICSID Convention and 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, arbitral
awards issued under the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral attack and must be

enforced and given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a court

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 2 of 9

in the United States. Accordingly, Petitioners request that this Court (1) enter an order enforcing
the Award in the same manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states,
and (2) enter judgment in Petitioners’ favor in the amounts and currency denominations specified
in the Award.

A certified copy of the Award is attached as Exhibit A to the Declaration of Matthew S.
Rozen (“Rozen Decl.”), Exhibit 1 hereto. A copy of the ICSID Convention is attached hereto as
Exhibit 2.

Parties

1. Petitioners Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.A.R.L. and Energia Termosolar
B.V. are the entities that obtained the Award. Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.A.R.L. isa
private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg. Energia
Termosolar B.V. is a private limited liability company incorporated under the laws of the
Netherlands. At the time of the Award, Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.A.R.L. was
named Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.A.R.L., and Energia Termosolar B.V. was
named Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.A.R.L. changed
its name on July 23, 2018, and Energia Termosolar B.V. changed its name on July 25, 2018.

2. Respondent, the Kingdom of Spain, is a foreign state within the meaning of the
Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (“FSIA”), 28 U.S.C. §§ 1330, 1332, 1391(f), 1602-1611.

Jurisdiction and Venue

3. This Court has subject-matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to the FSIA,
28 U.S.C. § 1330(a), because this is a “nonjury civil action against a foreign state” on a claim
“with respect to which the foreign state is not entitled to immunity” under the FSIA. Pursuant to

Section 1605(a)(1) of the FSIA, Spain is not entitled to immunity from this Court’s jurisdiction

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 3 of 9

in an action to enforce an ICSID Convention award because it has waived that immunity by
agreeing to the ICSID Convention. See Blue Ridge Investments, L.L.C. v. Republic of Argentina,
735 F.3d 72, 84 (2d Cir. 2013). Further, pursuant to Section 1605(a)(6) of the FSIA, Spain is not
immune from suit because this is an action to enforce an arbitral award governed by the ICSID
Convention, which is a treaty in force in the United States for the recognition and enforcement of
arbitral awards. Id. at 85.

4. This Court also has subject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(b),
which provides that “[t]he district courts of the United States . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction
over actions and proceedings” to enforce awards entered under the ICSID Convention.

5. This Court has personal jurisdiction over Spain pursuant to the FSIA, 28 U.S.C.

§ 1330(b). Venue is proper in this Court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391(f)(1) and (4).

6. The Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seg. does “not apply to
enforcement of awards rendered pursuant to the [ICSID] convention.” 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).
Thus, the FAA’s jurisdictional requirements do not apply to this action.

The Underlying Dispute

7. Beginning in 2007, Spain adopted legislation with the goal of attracting
investment in renewable energy production, including concentrated solar power projects, within
its territory. Award J 91-108 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). In reliance on the financial incentives
and inducements provided by these legislative measures, Petitioners invested approximately
EUR 139.5 million in solar power projects in Spain’s territory. Jd. ff 109-34, 359. Spain
subsequently adopted a series of laws between 2012 and 2014 retrenching on, and eventually

revoking, the economic incentives on which Petitioners had relied in investing in solar power

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 4 of 9

projects. Id. §{ 139-53. The rescission of these incentives caused substantial harm to the value
of Petitioners’ investments. Id. §§ 154, 725.

8. Petitioners’ investments in solar power projects were protected by the Energy
Charter Treaty (“ECT”), which “establishes a legal framework in order to promote long-term co-
operation in the energy field.” Award §{ 209-10, 216 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A); see generally
ECT (Exhibit 3 hereto).

9. Spain is a contracting party to the ECT,! and consented to submit disputes arising
under that treaty to arbitration under the ICSID Convention. See ECT, art. 26(3)(a), (4)(a)(i)
(Exhibit 3 hereto).

10. Article 26(3)(a) of the ECT provides that “each Contracting Party hereby gives its
unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration . . . in accordance
with the provisions of this Article.” Article 26(4)(a)(i) further provides that where “the
Contracting Party of the Investor and the Contracting Party . . . to the dispute are both parties to
the ICSID Convention,” the dispute will be submitted for arbitration under that convention.

11. Spain is a party to the ICSID Convention.” Infrastructure Services Luxembourg
S.A.R.L. and Energia Termosolar B.V. are investors under the ECT, and are incorporated under
the laws of Luxembourg and the Netherlands, respectively, both of which are also contracting

parties to the ICSID Convention? and the ECT.* ECT, art. 1(7) (Exhibit 3 hereto); Award

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 5 of 9

4§ 209-10 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). Accordingly, Spain consented to arbitrate the underlying
dispute pursuant to the ICSID Convention.

12. On November 1, 2013, Petitioners filed a request with the International Centre for
Settlement of Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) for arbitration under the ICSID Convention.
Award § 6 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). Petitioners contended that Spain’s legislative actions that
resulted in the devaluation of Petitioners’ investments constituted a breach of Spain’s obligations
under the ECT. Jd. 4 155.

13. An ICSID arbitral tribunal (the “Tribunal”) was constituted on August 7, 2014.
Award § 10 (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). The Tribunal conducted a Hearing on Jurisdiction and
Merits in Paris, France, from October 19 through October 25, 2016. Id. ¥ 33.

14. On June 15, 2018, the Tribunal issued the Award, finding that Spain had breached
its obligations under Article 10(1) of the ECT by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to
Petitioners’ investments within Spain’s territory. Award J 748(b) (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A).

15. The Award requires Spain to pay EUR 112 million as damages. Award § 748(c)
(Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). The Award further requires Spain to pay interest on the damages
award at a rate of 2.07 percent from June 20, 2014 until the Award is paid in full, compounded
monthly. /d. § 748(d). In addition, the Award requires Spain to pay USD 635,431.70 in
arbitration costs and GBP 2,447,008.61 in legal representation costs and expenses. Id. § 748(e).

16. The ICSID Convention provides that a party that believes an arbitral award
contains a “clerical, arithmetical or similar error” may request that the tribunal rectify the error.
ICSID Convention, art. 49(2) (Exhibit 2 hereto). Unlike other forms of relief from an arbitral
award, a request for rectification does not stay enforcement of the award. Compare id., art.

49(2), with id., art. 52(5) (party who seeks “annulment” of an arbitral award may request a stay

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 6 of 9

of enforcement, and enforcement shall be stayed provisionally pending a ruling on that request).
Accordingly, the ICSID Convention provides that “[t]he award shall be binding on the parties”
and “[e]ach party shall abide by and comply with the terms of the award,” notwithstanding the
pendency of a request for rectification of the award. Id. art. 53(1).

17. On July 24, 2018, Spain submitted a Request for Rectification of the Award to the
Tribunal, alleging that the Tribunal erred in computing the amount of compensatory damages.
Spain has requested that the Tribunal (a) reduce the award of compensatory damages from EUR
112 million to EUR 84 million, and (b) reduce the award of costs to correspond with the reduced
damages computation. Spain has not applied for or obtained a stay of enforcement of the Award
pending its request. Thus, the Award remains binding and enforceable, notwithstanding Spain’s
Request for Rectification.

18. The Tribunal has not ruled on Spain’s Request for Rectification as of the filing of
this Petition. If the Tribunal were to grant Spain’s request, any adjusted amounts would
“become part of the award.” See ICSID Convention, art. 49(2) (Exhibit 2 hereto).

Legal Basis for Relief

19. The ICSID Convention provides that contracting parties must “recognize an
award rendered pursuant to [the] Convention as binding and enforce the pecuniary obligations
imposed by that award within its territories as if it were a final judgment of a court in that State.”
ICSID Convention, art. 54(1) (Exhibit 2 hereto). The ICSID Convention further provides that a
contracting state “with a federal constitution may enforce such an award in or through its federal
courts and may provide that such courts shall treat the award as if it were a final judgment of the

courts of a constituent state.” Id.

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 7 of 9

20. The United States is a contracting party to the ICSID Convention and is therefore
obligated to enforce the Award as if it were a final judgment of a court in the United States.
That obligation is fulfilled by 22 U.S.C. § 1650a, which provides:

(a) An award of an arbitral tribunal rendered pursuant to chapter IV of the

convention shall create a right arising under a treaty of the United States. The

pecuniary obligations imposed by such an award shall be enforced and shall be

given the same full faith and credit as if the award were a final judgment of a

court of general jurisdiction of one of the several States. The Federal Arbitration

Act (9 U.S.C. § 1 et seq.) shall not apply to enforcement of awards rendered

pursuant to the convention.

21. Arbitral awards issued against a foreign state pursuant to the ICSID Convention
may be enforced by bringing a plenary action in federal court in compliance with the
requirements for commencing a civil action under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and with
the personal jurisdiction, service, and venue requirements of the FSIA. See Micula v. Gov't of
Romania, 104 F. Supp. 3d 42, 49-50 (D.D.C. 2015); Mobil Cerro Negro, Ltd. v. Bolivarian
Republic of Venezuela, 863 F.3d 96, 100, 117-18, 119-20 (2d Cir. 2017).

22. Awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are not subject to collateral
attack in enforcement proceedings under 22 U.S.C. § 1650a. “Member states’ courts are ... not
permitted to examine an ICSID award’s merits, its compliance with international law, or the
ICSID tribunal’s jurisdiction to render the award; under the Convention’s terms, they may do no
more than examine the judgment’s authenticity and enforce the obligations imposed by the
award.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at 102. The ICSID Convention therefore “reflects an
expectation that the courts of a member nation will treat the award as final.” Id.; see also id. at

118 (noting that an “ICSID award-debtor ... [is] not ... permitted to make substantive challenges

to the award”); see also ICSID Convention, arts. 53(1), 54(1) (Exhibit 2 hereto). Consistent with

> https://icsid.worldbank.org/en/Pages/icsiddocs/List-of-Member-States.aspx.

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 8 of 9

this mandate, 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a) provides that the FAA “shall not apply to enforcement of
awards rendered pursuant to the convention,” thereby “mak[ing] [the FAA’s defenses]
unavailable to ICSID award-debtors in federal court proceedings.” Mobil Cerro, 863 F.3d at
120-21. District courts thus enforce ICSID awards without allowing substantive challenges to
enforcement of the awards. See, e.g., Duke Energy Int’l Peru Investments No. 1 Ltd. v. Republic
of Peru, 904 F. Supp. 2d 131, 132-34 (D.D.C. 2012); Republic of Panama v. Jurado, No. 8:12-
cv-1647, Doc. 18 (M.D. Fla. June 13, 2013).

Cause of Action and Request for Relief

23.  Arbitral awards issued pursuant to the ICSID Convention are subject to
mandatory enforcement in the courts of the United States, which must give those awards the
same full faith and credit as a final judgment issued by a state court. 22 U.S.C. § 1650a(a).

24. The Award was rendered in accordance with the ICSID Convention against Spain
and in Petitioners’ favor. Petitioners are therefore entitled to enforce the Award’s pecuniary
obligations against Spain.

25. Accordingly, Petitioners are entitled to an order (a) enforcing the Award in the
same manner as a final judgment issued by a court of one of the several states, and (b) entering
judgment in Petitioners’ favor in the amount specified in the Award.

26. Petitioners request that the Court enter judgment in the currencies specified in the
Award. See Award § 748(c), (e) (Rozen Decl., Exhibit A). This Court has authority to enter
judgment in a foreign currency when requested by the judgment creditor. See Cont’ Transfert
Technique Ltd. v. Federal Gov't of Nigeria, 603 F. App’x 1, 4 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Cont’l Transfert

Technique Ltd. v. Federal Gov't of Nigeria, 932 F. Supp. 2d 153, 158 (D.D.C. 2013), aff'd, 603

Case 1:18-cv-01753 Document1 Filed 07/27/18 Page 9 of 9

F. App’x 1 (D.C. Cir. 2015); accord Leidos, Inc. v. Hellenic Republic, 881 F.3d 213, 220 (D.C.
Cir. 2018).
WHEREFORE, Petitioners request that the Court enter an order:
(a) enforcing the Award against Spain in the same manner as a final judgment issued by a
court of one of the several states; and
(b) entering judgment against Spain and in Petitioners’ favor in the following amounts
and currency denominations:
(1) EUR 112 million in compensatory damages;
(2) interest thereupon from June 20, 2014 to the date of payment in full at the rate
of 2.07 percent, compounded monthly;
(3) USD 635,431.70 in arbitration costs; and
(4) GBP 2,447,008.61 in legal representation costs and expenses;
or any other adjusted amount that subsequently becomes part of the Award pursuant to Article

49(2) of the ICSID Convention.
