L INTRODUCTION

1. The present dispute has been submitted to the International Centre for Settlement of
Investment Disputes (“ICSID”) on the basis of the Agreement between the Government of Canada
and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt for the promotion and Protection of
Investments, which entered into force on 11 March 1997 (the “BIT”)! and the Convention on the
Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States, which entered

into force on 14 October 1966 (the “ICSID Convention”).

2. In this Award, the Tribunal first introduces the Parties (Section II) and provides an
overview of the factual background to the dispute (Section III). Section IV sets out the procedural
history leading up to this Award, and Section V recalls the Parties’ requests for relief. The Tribunal
then addresses the objections to jurisdiction and admissibility (Section VI), before turning to the

claims on the merits (Section VII). The Parties’ requests for costs are considered in Section VIII.

3. Ultimately, the Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction over all claims except the national
treatment claim. On the merits, the Tribunal dismisses the remaining claims. The Tribunal’s Award

is set forth in Section X.

4. In reaching the decisions contained in this Award, the Tribunal has carefully reviewed and
considered all the arguments presented by the Parties in both their written and oral submissions.
The fact that a specific argument is not expressly referenced in this Award does not mean that it
has not been considered, as the Tribunal includes only those points which it considers most relevant

for its decisions.

' CL-001, BIT (English Version); CL-002, BIT (French Version); CL-003, BIT (Arabic Version). GTH refers to this
agreement as the “BIT,” whereas Canada refers to it as the “FIPA.” Although the Tribunal has no preference for one
of these terms over the other, it has chosen to use a single term, “BIT,” for consistency.

IL. THE PARTIES

5. The claimant is Global Telecom Holding S.A.E. (“GTH” or “Claimant”), a joint stock
company incorporated under the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt (“Egypt”) and listed on the
Egyptian Stock Exchange.? GTH, which was formerly known as Orascom Telecom Holding
S.A.E., operates mobile telecommunications networks in several markets around the world. Its
registered office is 2005 Nile City Towers, North Tower, Cornish El Nile, Ramlet Beaulac, 11221
Cairo, Egypt.*

6. The respondent is Canada (also referred to as the “Respondent”), a sovereign State.

Canada has been an ICSID Contracting State since 1 December 2013.

Ill. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

7. The following summary is intended to provide a general overview of the factual
background to the dispute between the Parties. It is not intended to be an exhaustive description of
all facts considered relevant by the Tribunal. Further factual material will be addressed in the

context of the Tribunal’s analysis of the issues in dispute below.

A. OVERVIEW OF CANADA’S WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET

8. Oversight of the Canadian wireless telecommunications industry is exercised primarily by
two Canadian government authorities. Industry Canada, headed by the Minister of Industry (the
“Minister”), manages the radio frequency spectrum in Canada pursuant to the
Radiocommunication Act.‘ The Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications
Commission (the “CRTC”) regulates telecommunications carriers pursuant to the

Telecommunications Act.>

Public Version

9. In addition, telecommunications providers are subject to generally applicable legislation
such as the Canadian Competition Act, pursuant to which the Competition Bureau reviews mergers

and acquisitions and investigates anti-competitive practices.°

10. The Canadian telecommunications market has expanded significantly since the late 1990s.
However, by 2007, the market was highly concentrated, with 94% of market share held by three
dominant carriers: Rogers Communications Inc. (“Rogers”), Bell Canada (“Bell”), and TELUS
Communications Company (“Telus”) (together, the “Incumbents”).’ Mobile wireless spectrum
was also concentrated in the hands of the Incumbents. Canadian consumers were paying high

prices and service penetration was low, relative to other markets.”

B. THE 2008 AWS AUCTION

11. In 2007, Industry Canada identified new Advanced Wireless Services (“AWS”) spectrum
for release by auction.'° In light of the market and spectrum concentration prevailing at the time,
Industry Canada viewed the auction as an opportunity to open the market to new wireless operators

(“New Entrants”).!!

12. On 16 February 2007, Industry Canada initiated the consultation phase for the auction of
AWS spectrum licenses to be held in 2008 (the “2008 AWS Auction”) with the publication of the
Consultation on a Framework to Auction Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range including Advanced
Wireless Services (the “2008 AWS Auction Consultation”). !? In this document, Industry Canada

noted its overall objective of fostering a competitive wireless telecommunications market and

Advanced Wireless Services: Briefing to ADM SITT, 21 November 2006, slide 6 (“the auction is a unique opportunity

Framework as “Any entity, including affiliates and associated entities, which holds less than 10 percent of the national
wireless market based on revenue.” C-004, AWS Auction Policy Framework, p. 5.

identified certain barriers to market entry, including the “unavailability of spectrum” and the “high
fixed cost of building a wireless network” to replicate the networks controlled by Incumbents. '?
The document also stated that “[floreign investment restrictions have the effect of limiting
potential entry in the telecommunications market thereby reducing the competitive discipline that

the threat of entry can provide.” '*

13. Industry Canada sought input on, inter alia: (a) whether it was necessary to adopt measures
in the 2008 AWS Auction to enable market entry; (b) if so, whether setting aside spectrum for
New Entrants or introducing spectrum caps would be most effective in fostering competition;
(c) the possibility of mandating that Incumbents offer roaming services to New Entrants; and

(d) the proposed conditions of license. !>

() The Spectrum Policy Framework and Licensing Procedure

14. On 13 June 2007, Industry Canada published a revised Spectrum Policy Framework for
Canada, which provides the general “policy foundation” for the spectrum management in
Canada.'° It stated that Canada’s objective was to “maximize the economic and social benefits that
Canadians derive from the use of the radio frequency spectrum resource.”!” It stressed the
importance of relying on market forces “to the maximum extent feasible” and stated that

“{r]egulatory measures, where required, should be minimally intrusive, efficient and effective.”!*

15. Then, in September 2007, Industry Canada released the Licensing Procedure for Spectrum
Licences for Terrestrial Services, providing the general policies and procedures applicable to the
issuance and transfer of spectrum licenses. !° With regard to the transfer of licenses, this document
states that spectrum licenses obtained through an auction process enjoy “enhanced transferability

and divisibility rights” and that such “licences may be transferred in whole or in part (either in

applicable to the transfer of spectrum.”!

(2) The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework and Licensing Framework

16. On 28 November 2007, Canada published its Policy Framework for the Auction for
Spectrum Licences for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range (the
“2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework”).”* Further to the 2008 AWS Auction Consultation,
Industry Canada had decided to set aside spectrum for New Entrants in the 2008 AWS Auction

and to provide for mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing.

17. Both Parties have highlighted the following general statement set out in the 2008 AWS

Auction Policy Framework:

The department is committed to government policies which seek to rely on market forces
to the maximum extent feasible for the provision of telecommunications services to
Canadians. This policy approach can only be pursued in an environment where market
forces can be expected to deliver, now and in the future, a level of competition sufficient
to protect the interests of users. Accordingly, in making this resource available, a critical
consideration has been to implement an auction framework that will help ensure that
market forces support a telecommunications infrastructure that delivers innovation and
consumer choice at competitive prices.”

18. Various measures and terms set forth in the Policy Framework are relevant to the current

dispute, including the following:

a. Set-Aside Spectrum: Canada reserved 40 MHz (approximately 40%) of the spectrum
that was to be auctioned for bidding exclusively by New Entrants.”* This is referred to

as the ‘set-aside’ spectrum.

b. Mandatory Roaming: Canada mandated that Incumbents provide roaming to AWS
licensees outside of the licensees’ territory for ten years (the term of the AWS license)
and roaming within the licensees’ territory for five years while the licensees built out
their network, with a possible five-year extension for New Entrants that met specified
rollout targets.?> Incumbents were required to make roaming “available at commercial
rates,” described as rates “that are reasonably comparable to rates that are currently
charged to others for similar services.””° Further, arrangements were to be offered
“wherever technically feasible” and negotiated in good faith within certain time
frames.”’ In the event that “the parties [were] unable to come to an agreement within
the established time frame, the parties [would] be required to undertake binding

arbitration.”?8

c. Mandatory Tower/site Sharing: Canada mandated tower/site sharing wherever
technically feasible in order to prohibit exclusive site arrangements. Sharing
agreements were to be negotiated in good faith within prescribed time frames.
Licensees would “be directed to binding arbitration to resolve disputes where they

cannot finalize an agreement to share within certain time frames.””°

d. Rollout Targets: The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework set forth roll-out targets
to be achieved within five years, which would be taken into account by Industry Canada

in deciding whether to renew the AWS licences after the ten-year licence term and in

considering applications from New Entrants for an extension of mandated in-territory

roaming beyond the initial five-year period.*°

e. Five-Year Transfer Restriction: The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework stated that
“Tw]hile all licence transfers must be approved by the Minister, licences obtained
through the set-aside may not be transferred to companies that do not meet the criteria

of a new entrant for a period of 5 years from the date of issuance.”?!

19. One month after releasing the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, on 22 December
2007, Industry Canada released the Licensing Framework for the Auction for Spectrum Licences
for Advanced Wireless Services and other Spectrum in the 2 GHz Range (the “2008 AWS Auction
Licensing Framework”), which described the rules and requirements for bidding in the 2008
AWS Auction and called for applications.*? Potential investors that wished to participate in the
2008 AWS Auction were required to submit an application by 10 March 2008, together with a

letter of credit to serve as a deposit in the auction.**

20. In the lead up to the application deadline, Industry Canada took questions regarding the

2008 AWS Policy and Licensing Frameworks and released its answers on 27 February 2008.*+

(3) Mandatory Roaming & Tower/Site Sharing Policies

21. The 2008 AWS Policy and Licensing Frameworks left the specific procedures, policies and
time frames related to mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing to be set forth in the final

conditions of license (“COLs”), which would be released later. In November 2007, in parallel with

its release of the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, Canada had initiated a consultation on

the proposed COLs relating to conditions of license to mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing.*>

22. On 29 February 2008, Industry Canada released the results of this consultation in a notice
of the final Conditions of Licence for Mandatory Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing

and to Prohibit Exclusive Site Arrangements.*°

23. In May 2008, Industry Canada initiated consultations on the arbitration rules and
procedures that would apply to roaming and tower/site sharing disputes, the results of which were
released on 29 November 2008 in a circular titled Industry Canada’s Arbitration Rules and

Procedures.*”

(4) The Ownership & Control Rules

24. The 2008 AWS Auction was also subject to Canada’s ownership and control rules (““O&C
Rules”). At the time, under the Telecommunications Act and the Radiocommunications
Regulations, any radiocommunications common carrier was required to be “Canadian-owned and

controlled.” With respect to a corporation, this meant that Canadians had to own “not less than 80

per cent of the corporation’s voting shares issued and outstanding.”*

25. Further, under the Canadian Telecommunications Common Carrier Ownership and Control
Regulations, a non-Canadian could not own more than 33 1/3% of the voting shares of a holding

company of a Canadian carrier.*? The CRTC had authority to review compliance of the O&C Rules

under the Telecommunications Act, while Industry Canada was responsible for ensuring

compliance with the identical O&C Rules under the Radiocommunication Regulations.

26. In August 2007, Industry Canada released an updated circular advising on the procedures

relating to “Canadian Ownership and Control.”*°

(5) Results of the 2008 AWS Auction

27. The 2008 AWS Auction began on 27 May 2008 and closed on 21 July 2008. Canada raised
CAD 4.3 billion in revenue through the auction, and six New Entrants won licenses.*! One of those
New Entrants was Wind Mobile, a joint venture between GTH and a Canadian operator, as
discussed below.*? Wind Mobile won 30 AWS spectrum licenses (covering a population of 23.3

million) at a price of CAD 442.1 million.

(6) The Conditions of License

28. In November 2008, Canada released the updated COLs, which applied to the licenses
obtained through the 2008 AWS Auction.“* With regard to the mandatory roaming and tower/site
sharing, the COLs adopted the conditions set out in Industry Canada’s notice of 29 February

2008.*> Other portions of the COLs relevant to the present dispute include the following:

1. Licence Term

This licence is issued for a 10-year term. The process for issuing licences after this
term and any issues relating to renewal will be determined by the Minister of
Industry following a public consultation.

2. Licence Transferability and Divisibility

The licensee may apply in writing to transfer its licence in whole or in part
(divisibility), in both the bandwidth and geographic dimensions. Departmental
approval is required for each proposed transfer of a licence, whether the transfer is

Cc. GTH’s INVESTMENT IN WIND MOBILE
(wD GTH’s Entry into the Canadian Market

31. The 2008 AWS Auction generated significant interest by potential investors, including
Globalive Communications Corp. (“Globalive”), a Canadian telecommunications operator.”
Globalive began seeking investors with which it could partner to participate in the auction. At the

same time, GTH had learned that Canada was planning to set aside spectrum in the 2008 AWS

Action for New Entrants and saw a potentially promising investment opportunity in the Canadian
market.
32. Globalive and GTH entered into talks in February 2008 to explore the possibility of a joint

venture. On 6 March 2008, they executed a memorandum of understanding, by which GTH agreed

to (a) enter into an exclusive negotiation period with Globalive and Po

Po GTH’s investment committee had received information
concerning Globalive’s background and experience and its proposed joint venture structure, as
well as the Canadian legal and regulatory framework and important terms of the 2008 AWS
Auction.>? GTH also sought advice from the Canadian law firm fF regarding
compliance with the O&C Rules.**

33. On 10 March 2008, Globalive Wireless LP (later known as Globalive Wireless
Management Corp. and operating under the brand name Wind Mobile) (“Wind Mobile”) filed an
application to participate in the 2008 AWS Auction and provided the required deposit

35. As noted above, through its participation in the auction, Wind Mobile was issued 30 AWS

spectrum licenses for a total of CAD 442.1 million.*”

(2) The Structure of GTH’s Investment

36. On 30 July 2008, GTH entered into an investment agreement with Globalive
Communications Holdings Ontario Inc. (“GCHO”) and Mojo Investments Corp. (“Mojo”),
another Canadian company.** In this agreement, GTH agreed that it would advance funds for the
total amount of the spectrum licenses through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Global Telecom
Holding Canada Limited (““GTHCL”) (known at the time as OTHCL), and that those licenses and
all related rights would be held by Wind Mobile.”

37. The following day, 31 July 2008, GTH entered into two shareholder agreements (together,
the “SHAs”):

a. an agreement under which GTHCL and Globalive Investment Holdings Corp.
(“Globalive Investment”) owned all the shares in Globalive Canada Holdings Corp.

(“Globalive Holdco”), which was in turn the sole owner of Wind Mobile; and

38. In light of the existing O&C Rules, GTH could not hold more than 20% of Wind Mobile’s
voting shares. However, according to GTH’s General Counsel, Mr. David Dobbie, GTH
understood “that there was a policy movement in Canada towards a relaxation of the O&C
Rules.” Thus, the SHAs and the Articles of Incorporation for Globalive Investment gave GTH

the right to take voting control over Wind Mobile if the O&C Rules were relaxed in the future.

commence the review of Wind Mobile’s compliance with the O&C Rules.’? Over several months,
Wind Mobile and its legal representatives met with Industry Canada to discuss areas of concerns
and possible changes to the investment structure to address those concerns.” It is undisputed that
at the time, Industry Canada knew of the provisions allowing GTH to take voting control of Wind

Mobile if the O&C Rules were relaxed in the future.”

(2) Review by the CRTC

46. On 22 December 2008, the CRTC wrote to Wind Mobile and the other New Entrants
offering to conduct a review of their compliance with the O&C Rules under the
Telecommunications Act prior to the commencement of their operations.’* In response, on 3 April
2009, Wind Mobile submitted its ownership documents, which had been approved by Industry

Canada, to the CRTC for review.”

47. Shortly thereafter, Telus wrote to the CRTC advocating for a “more fulsome and
transparent review” of Wind Mobile’s ownership, citing public documents that “give rise to
legitimate concerns that appropriate governance controls be put in place to ensure that Globalive
is controlled in fact by Canadians.”*® Shaw then wrote to the CRTC supporting Telus’ request.*!
Wind Mobile responded to the Incumbents’ request in a letter of 5 May 2009, arguing that the

public review sought by Telus and Shaw “would be highly discriminatory and contrary to the

principles of administrative fairness.”**

48. After receiving this correspondence, on 22 May 2009, the CRTC initiated consultations
concerning its O&C Rules review process.*? At the conclusion of the consultations, on 20 July
2009, the CRTC established a new four-tier framework for the O&C review process.*# In most
cases, the CRTC would conduct a bilateral, confidential Type 1 review.®> However, the CRTC

explained that:

in exceptional circumstances, the Commission will hold an oral, public, multi-party
proceeding (Type 4 review) where an ownership or governance structure is of a

complex or novel nature, such that in the Commission’s view its determination will
hold precedential value to industry players and the general public, where the
Commission considers that the evidentiary record would be improved by third-party
submissions, and the Commission further considers that the appearance of parties
would more easily allow the Commission to complete and test the evidentiary
record. Under this type of review, documentary evidence filed by the carrier under
review will be available for public inspection. Third parties will have an opportunity
to file written submissions and request to provide oral submissions on that evidence.
At the conclusion of the review process, a public decision will be issued.*°

49. On the same day, the CRTC notified Wind Mobile that it would conduct a Type 4 review
of Wind Mobile’s ownership.*’

50. In the following months, the CRTC issued written interrogatories to Wind Mobile,
accepted written comments from the public and held two days of oral hearings. During this process,
further changes were made to Wind Mobile’s structure in response to concerns expressed by the
CRTC.® Yet ultimately, the CRTC determined that Wind Mobile did not satisfy the O&C Rules.
In its decision of 29 October 2009 (the “CRTC Decision”), the CRTC found that Wind Mobile
had “met the test for legal control” but was “controlled in fact by Orascom, a non-Canadian” and

therefore did “not meet the requirements set out in section 16 of the [Telecommunications] Act

and [was not] eligible to operate as a telecommunications common carrier.”*?

51. The CEO of Wind Mobile at the time, Mr. Ken Campbell, wrote to the Minister of Industry,
opposing the CRTC Decision. He stated that:

the CRTC made this determination, which is not required by law, knowing that it could kill
our business and totally undermine the Government’s pro-competitive and pro-consumer
spectrum policy.

52. After the CRTC Decision was issued, the Governor in Council (the “GiC’”) commenced a
review pursuant to its authority under the Telecommunications Act to vary decisions of the CRTC.
The GiC disagreed with the CRTC’s finding that Orascom controlled Wind Mobile in fact. Thus,
on 10 December 2009, the GiC varied the CRTC Decision (the “GiC Decision”).! It held that
Wind Mobile satisfied the O&C Rules under the Telecommunications Act and was eligible to

E. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MANDATORY ROAMING AND TOWER/SITE SHARING

56. As noted above, in parallel with the 2008 AWS Auction, Industry Canada adopted a policy
of mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing, pursuant to which licensees were required to
negotiate in good faith and provide other operators roaming and tower/site sharing at reasonable

commercial terms.

57. After the 2008 AWS Auction, Industry Canada received complaints from both Incumbents
and New Entrants (including Wind Mobile) that licensees were not following the COLs on
roaming and site/tower sharing.°’ By letter of 15 May 2009, Wind Mobile sought clarification
from Industry Canada regarding the conditions on roaming, noting that a response “is much needed
and will be greatly appreciated and is, in fact, required for Rogers and [Wind Mobile] to usefully

advance our negotiations and, if necessary, to proceed to arbitration.”*

58. On 1 June 2009, Industry Canada responded as follows:

While Industry Canada may provide clarifications on the existing conditions of
licence, I would like to remind you that Industry Canada will only formally rule on
technical feasibility or potential breaches of the conditions of licence. Disputes
regarding the commercial aspects, terms or costs related to the roaming agreement
should be dealt with through negotiations between the parties, and if necessary, the
arbitration process as set out by Industry Canada.°?

59. GTH alleges that the arbitration process was not a viable option and that Wind Mobile
therefore “had no commercial choice but to agree to the terms imposed by Rogers in order to
provide service to subscribers in areas where it did not have any towers or coverage.”!”

60. With regard to tower/site sharing, Industry Canada released a consultation document in
February 2009. Based on the responses, in April 2009, it released its Guidelines for Compliance

with the Conditions of Licence Relating to Antenna Tower and Site Sharing and to Prohibit

Exclusive Site Arrangements.'°! Yet as of July 2010, New Entrants requesting to share on towers

were only 4.5% successful in reaching agreements, according to Industry Canada statistics.!

6l. In November 2010, the Minister announced that Industry Canada was commencing a
review of its roaming and tower/site sharing policy.'°? Industry Canada retained the consulting
firm Nordicity to assess the effectiveness of the policy, and Nordicity provided its final report in

May 2011.!%*

62. In March 2012, Industry Canada launched a public consultation on proposed changes to
the COLs on roaming and tower/site sharing. '°> Wind Mobile commented on the proposal in May
and June 2012 and also met with the Minister of Industry in January 2013 to push for regulatory
change. Wind Mobile suggested, inter alia, that (a) domestic wholesale roaming rates be capped,

(b) the rates be subject to CRTC review, (c) existing roaming agreements be reopened, and

(d) exclusivity provisions in roaming agreements be prohibited.!

63. On 7 March 2013, Industry Canada released revised COLs and the Revised Frameworks
for Mandatory Roaming and Antenna Tower and Site Sharing, setting out the changes to the COLs
for mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing and to the arbitration rules and procedures. !°’ Wind
Mobile met with Industry Canada officials again in May and October 2013, continuing to press for

additional changes and clarifications to the policy. !°°

64. In 2013 and 2014, the CRTC also assessed the competitiveness of the mobile wireless
services market to determine whether regulatory changes were required. In July 2014, the CRTC
banned the use of exclusivity clauses in roaming agreements, based on its finding that Rogers had
improperly used such clauses to prevent New Entrants from negotiating better deals with other

operators. !°°

65. In addition, on 19 June 2014, the Canadian Parliament amended the Telecommunications
Act to prohibit carriers from charging other carriers more than the average amount they charged
their own subscribers for roaming.'!° Finally, in May 2015, the CRTC adopted caps on certain

roaming rates, !!!

F. GTH’s APPLICATION FOR VOTING CONTROL OF WIND MOBILE AND THE NATIONAL
SECURITY REVIEW

67. At the time of the 2008 AWS Auction, Canada’s O&C Rules prevented GTH as a non-
Canadian company from acquiring voting control over Wind Mobile. The 2008 AWS Auction
Policy Framework noted that the CRTC was reviewing the O&C Rules, which “act as restrictions

on foreign investment which constitutes a barrier to market entry,” but that [r]emoval or

liberalization of these requirements would require legislative changes.” '!>

G. THE 2013 TRANSFER FRAMEWORK

85. In the years following the 2008 AWS Auction, Canada became concerned about the
prospect of spectrum concentration once the five-year restriction on the transfer of set-aside
licenses expired. Industry Canada had announced that that it would be holding 700 MHz and 2500
MHz spectrum auctions and that there would be spectrum caps so that New Entrants could access
prime spectrum.'4* Yet the viability of the New Entrants was in question, and it was unclear

whether they would participate. !”

86. Against this background, on 14 January 2013, Shaw (a New Entrant) announced that it had
reached an agreement with Rogers (an Incumbent) to sell Rogers a purchase option on its set-aside
licenses. '*° Industry analysts saw that the market was consolidating, '°! and Wind Mobile strongly

opposed the deal, urging Industry Canada to “immediately revoke Shaw’s AWS licenses.” !>>

87. On 7 March 2013, Industry Canada released a Consultation on Considerations Relating to
Transfers, Divisions and Subordinate Licensing of Spectrum Licences (the “2013 Transfer

Consultation”). It proposed that in certain cases, Industry Canada would conduct a “detailed

review” of proposed license transfers in which it would consider whether the transfer would

learning that New Entrants were contemplating selling their spectrum licenses to Incumbents, and

that his plan was to have the new rules in place before the five-year transfer restriction expired.!**

89. Together with the 2013 Transfer Consultation, Industry Canada issued a press release titled

“Harper Government Puts Consumers First in Telecommunications Plan, and the Minister of

Industry gave a speech in which he stated:

the objective of promoting competition in the wireless sector. To be clear, our

denied Telus’ application to obtain Mobilicity’s spectrum licenses. He stated:

95. The Minister also announced that, under the new transfer policy (which had yet to be
published), “proposed spectrum transfers—including AWS spectrum transfers—that will result in

undue concentration and therefore reduce competition will not be permitted.” He further stated:

[L]et me be clear—our government will not hesitate to use any and every tool at
our disposal to:

* protect consumers;

 

* promote competition; and

* promote at least four wireless providers in every region of the country. !°
96. On the same day, the Minister made similar statements before the House of Commons. 166

97. On 28 June 2013, Industry Canada released the Framework Relating to Transfers,
Divisions and Subordinate Licensing of Spectrum Licences for Commercial Mobile Spectrum (the
“Transfer Framework”).'©’ The stated purpose of the Framework was “to provide guidance to

licensees as to how transfers of spectrum licences will be reviewed, as well as to introduce

additional conditions of licence regarding the transfer of control of spectrum licences.” !®*

107. In March 2015, Industry Canada held an auction of AWS-3 spectrum licenses, in which
certain spectrum was set aside for New Entrants.'’? Wind Mobile acquired a block of set-aside

spectrum licenses through this auction for CAD 56.4 million.'°

108. On 24 June 2015, Industry Canada approved two transfers of set-aside spectrum licenses
to Rogers: (a) Rogers’ purchase of the set-aside spectrum licenses of Shaw (a New Entrant) for
CAD 350 million; and (b) Rogers’ acquisition of Mobilicity (a New Entrant) for
CAD 440 million.'*! As part of these transactions, Rogers transferred all of Mobilicity’s AWS

spectrum to Wind Mobile, and Shaw’s AWS spectrum was split between Wind Mobile and Rogers.

In return, Wind Mobile transferred a some of its existing AWS spectrum to Rogers. !°

109. In an announcement on the same day, the Minister of Industry stated:

Today our government approved a series of spectrum licence transfers between
Rogers, Shaw, Mobilicity and WIND. These transfers will result in at least four
wireless firms in every region of the country being able to offer the latest
technology, world-class service and more choice to all Canadians and their

IV. PROCEDURAL HISTORY

111. On 28 May 2016, GTH submitted to ICSID a Request for Arbitration, including exhibits 1

to 36 and Annexes A to I.

112. On 6 June 2016, in accordance with Article 36 of the ICSID Convention, the Secretary-
General of ICSID registered the Request for Arbitration and so notified the Parties. In the Notice
of Registration, the Secretary-General invited the Parties to proceed to constitute an arbitral

tribunal as soon as possible pursuant to Articles 37 to 40 of the ICSID Convention.

113. By correspondence of 12 and 13 August 2016, the Parties informed ICSID of their agreed
method of constituting the Tribunal. The Parties agreed that the Tribunal would be composed of
three members, with each Party appointing one arbitrator, and third, presiding arbitrator to be
appointed pursuant to a list procedure. In this regard, the Parties specified that they would

exchange lists of candidates for the President of the Tribunal without copying ICSID.

114. In accordance with the Parties’ agreed method of appointment, GTH appointed Mr. Gary
Born, a national of the United States of America, as arbitrator. Canada then appointed Professor
Vaughan Lowe, a national of the United Kingdom, as arbitrator. Professor Lowe accepted his

appointment on 19 August 2016, and Mr. Born accepted his appointment on 25 August 2016.

115. On 30 August 2016, the Parties informed ICSID that they had agreed to an amended

schedule for the list procedure by which the presiding arbitrator was to be appointed.

116. On 19 January 2017, the Parties jointly requested ICSID’s assistance in appointing the
President of the Tribunal. Specifically, the Parties asked ICSID to provide them with a list of seven
candidates, which had been pre-screened for conflicts and availability. Upon receipt of the list,
each Party had the option to agree to appoint a candidate from the other Party’s previously
exchanged lists of candidates. Otherwise, each Party would be permitted to strike two names from
the list and rank the remaining candidates from one to five, with one being the most preferred. The

candidate with the lowest total score would be appointed.

117. At ICSID’s request, the Parties specified on 25 January 2017 that in the event of a tie

among candidates, the candidate with the lowest difference between the points assigned by each

35

Public Version

Party would be appointed. If the tie were still not resolved, the Parties would attempt to agree on
one of the candidates with the lowest total score. In the absence of agreement, the Secretary-

General would select and appoint the President from among those candidates.

118. On 6 February 2017, ICSID provided the Parties with the requested strike-and-rank list.

119. Pursuant to the Parties’ agreed procedure, considering the results of the Parties’ rankings,
the Secretary-General appointed Professor Dr. Georges Affaki, a national of France and Syria, as

President of the Tribunal. Professor Affaki accepted his appointment on 21 February 2017.

120. On the same date, in accordance with ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(1), the Secretary-General
notified the Parties that all three arbitrators had accepted their appointments and that the Tribunal
was therefore deemed to have been constituted on that date. The Parties were provided copies of
the declarations required under ICSID Arbitration Rule 6(2) signed by Professor Affaki, Mr. Born

and Professor Lowe, as well as the accompanying statements of Mr. Born and Professor Lowe.

121. Following its constitution, the Tribunal consulted with the Parties regarding the format and
date of the first session. The Tribunal determined that the first session would be held by

teleconference on 21 April 2017.

122. On 10 March 2017, in preparation for the first session, the Secretary of the Tribunal
transmitted to the Parties a draft agenda and a draft procedural order, which had been approved by
the Tribunal. The Parties were invited to confer on procedural matters and to inform the Tribunal

of any agreements they reached or, in the absence of agreement, of their respective positions.

123. On7 April 2017, the Parties submitted a joint draft procedural order reflecting the Parties’
agreement on most procedural issues. A limited number of matters remained in dispute, including
the place of the proceeding, confidentiality and the “number and sequence of pleadings, including
whether the proceedings should be bifurcated to deal with Canada’s preliminary objections on

jurisdiction and admissibility.” !°°

'°5 Email from the Claimant (on behalf of the Parties) to the Tribunal of 7 April 2017.

36

Public Version

124. Later on 7 April 2017, GTH submitted a letter addressing the disputed procedural issues.
Canada submitted (a) a request for bifurcation, including legal authorities RL-001 to RL-036, and

(b) a letter addressing the other disputed procedural matters.

125. On 14 April 2017, Canada submitted a letter containing its response to GTH’s letter of
7 April 2017. On the same day, GTH filed a Submission on Bifurcation, Publication and Place of
Proceeding, together with legal authorities CL-001 to CL-0018.

126. Also on 14 April 2017, the Tribunal confirmed that the Parties would be given an
opportunity to make oral presentations on the issue of bifurcation during the first session. The
Tribunal noted that, after hearing the Parties’ presentations, it would consult the Parties regarding

the need for any further procedure.
127. The first session was held by teleconference as scheduled on 21 April 2017.

128. Following the first session, the Tribunal determined that it would be premature to decide
whether to bifurcate the proceeding at that stage, and that the Tribunal would be better-placed to
decide after receiving the Respondent’s jurisdictional objections. The Tribunal informed the

Parties of this determination on 2 May 2017.

129. | The Tribunal continued to consult the Parties regarding the outstanding disputed procedural
issues, encouraging them to agree as far as possible. The Parties were able to reach agreement on
certain matters, including that the place of arbitration would be Paris, France. On 13 June 2017,
the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 1 (“PO1”), embodying the agreements of the Parties and
the decisions of the Tribunal regarding the procedure to govern the arbitration. The Procedural

Timetable was attached as Annex A of PO1.

130. With regard to issues of confidentiality and transparency, the Parties were directed to
consult and agree on a draft confidentiality order. PO1 provided that The Tribunal’s awards,
decisions and orders would be published on the ICSID website, subject to the redaction of

confidential information under a Confidentiality Order to be agreed by the parties.

131. On31 August 2017, Mr. Born provided the Parties with a supplemental statement pursuant

to Arbitration Rule 6.

37

Public Version

132. In accordance with the Procedural Timetable, on 29 September 2017, GTH filed its
Memorial on the Merits and Damages, together with exhibits C-001 to C-254, legal authorities
CL-001 to CL-089,!°° the Expert Report of Santiago Dellepiane A. and Pablo T. Spiller, and the
Witness Statements of Kenneth D. Campbell, Michael C. Connolly, David L. C. Dobbie and
Andrew M. Dry (“Merits Memorial’).

133. On 5 October 2017, Mr. Born provided the Parties with a supplemental statement pursuant

to Arbitration Rule 6.

134. On 26 October 2017, the Parties submitted a draft Confidentiality Order. They sought the
Tribunal’s resolution of one disputed issue. On 30 October 2017, the Tribunal issued the

Confidentiality Order applicable to the proceeding.

135. On 15 November 2017, Canada filed its Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility and
Request for Bifurcation, together with exhibits R-001 to R-078, legal authorities RL-038 to RL-
163 and the Expert Report of Prof. Dr. Mohamed S. Abdel Wahab (“Jur. Memorial’).

136. On 29 November 2017, GTH filed its Response to Canada’s Request for Bifurcation.

137. On 14 December 2017, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 2 (“PO2”), in which it
decided to deny the Respondent’s request for bifurcation. Accordingly, the arbitration proceeded

in accordance with the Procedural Timetable applicable to a joined proceeding,

138. On 26 February 2018, Canada filed its Counter-Memorial on Merits and Damages,
including exhibits R-079 to R-264 and legal authorities RL-164 to RL-242, the Expert Report of
The Brattle Group, and the Witness Statements of Jennifer Aitken, Peter Hill and Iain Stewart

(“Merits Counter-Memorial’”).

139. In accordance with Section 15.1 of PO1 and the Procedural Timetable, on 28 March 2018,

each Party served on the other Party a request for the production of documents. Subsequently, each

1% The legal authorities previously submitted with the Claimant’s submission of 14 April 2017 were refiled with the

38

Public Version

Party set forth its objections to the other Party’s requests for documents and then its responses to

the other Party’s objections.

140. On 2 May 2018, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they were in the process of
discussing their document requests with a view to reaching agreement on additional points. The
Parties jointly requested that the deadline to submit the document request schedules to the Tribunal

be extended. On 3 May 2018, the Tribunal confirmed the Parties’ agreed extension.

141. On 14 May 2018, each Party submitted its document production schedule to the Tribunal.

The Respondent also submitted a cover letter and supporting documentation.

142. By correspondence of 15 and 16 May 2018, the Parties made further, unsolicited

submissions relating to the document requests.

143. On 1 June 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 3, including Annexes A and B
(“PO3”) containing its decisions on the Parties’ document requests. In PO3, the Tribunal stated

that it was “not ordering the production of any document subject to legal privilege.” !°”

144. On 18 July 2018, GTH informed the Tribunal that the Parties had agreed to extend a
number of deadlines on the Procedural Timetable. The following day, the Tribunal approved the

Parties’ agreement.

145. By letter of 21 August 2018, Canada requested a further extension of time to complete its
document production pursuant to PO3 and proposed a revised Procedural Timetable to
accommodate this extension. At the Tribunal’s invitation, GTH submitted a response to the
Respondent’s letter on 24 August 2018. GTH opposed the requested extension. On 27 August
2018, the Tribunal informed the Parties of its decision on the matter and issued a revised

Procedural Timetable.

146. On 9 October 2018, GTH submitted a letter to the Tribunal, together with Appendices A
to G, in which it objected to certain categories of privilege claimed by Canada. On 10 October

2018, the Respondent informed the Tribunal by email that it intended to submit a response to

7 PO3, 4 14.

39

Public Version

GTH’s letter. By email of 11 October 2018, the Tribunal took note of both GTH’s letter and

Canada’s email.

147. On 17 October 2018, Canada submitted an electronic copy of its response to GTH’s letter
of 9 October 2018. Canada subsequently filed a hard copy of the response, together with exhibits
R-265 to R-292 and legal authorities RL-243 to RL-255. In its response, Canada informed the
Tribunal that there were also outstanding issues related to GTH’s production of documents and

privilege claims, but did not make any application to the Tribunal in this respect.

148. On 2 November 2018, Canada submitted a letter, together with exhibits R-293 to R-295
and Appendices A to F. It requested that the Tribunal (a) order GTH to conduct a document-
by-document review and to produce several categories of documents over which it had asserted

privilege; and (b) stay the proceedings until the Tribunal had an opportunity to address these issues.

149. On 3 November 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 4 (“PO4”), addressing
GTH’s objections to the Canada’s privilege claims. Pursuant to PO4, Canada was required to
conduct a review of withheld and redacted documents, and to produce any documents not subject

to privilege in light of the Tribunal’s guidance.

150. In the cover email to PO4, the Tribunal invited GTH to comment on Canada’s letter of
2 November 2018. The Tribunal also asked for an update regarding the Parties’ redaction of the

procedural orders which had been issued but not yet published.

151. On 5 November 2018, GTH submitted its Reply on Merits & Damages and Counter-
Memorial on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, including exhibits C-255 to C-401, legal authorities
CL-090 to CL-183, the Expert Report of Dr. Hani Sarie-Eldin and the Second Expert Report of
Santiago Dellepiane A. and Pablo T. Spiller (“Merits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial’).

152. By letter of 8 November 2018, Canada (a) sought an extension to the deadline for its
compliance with PO4; (b) informed the Tribunal that the Parties had reached agreement on the
redaction and publication of PO3; and (c) identified a number of disagreements between the Parties
regarding the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information in PO2

and the Parties’ submissions.

40

Public Version

153. On 10 November 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties in response to Canada’s letter of
8 November 2018. The Tribunal (a) granted the requested extension; (b) confirmed that PO3 would
be published without its Annexes as agreed by the Parties; and (c) set a pleading schedule for the

issue of the designation of information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information.

154. One 12 November 2018, GTH submitted two letters, together with exhibits C-402 to C-428
and legal authorities CL-184 to CL-188. The first letter responded to Canada’s letter of
2 November 2018 concerning GTH’s production of documents and privilege claims. The second
letter was in response to Canada’s letter of 8 November 2018 concerning the designation of

information as Confidential or Restricted Access Information.

155. By email of 14 November 2018, Canada sought leave to respond to GTH’s letter of

12 November 2018 concerning the Claimant’s privilege claims.

156. On 15 November 2018, the Tribunal wrote to the Parties, noting its concern with the
multiplication of submissions and replies in relation to privilege claims. The Tribunal informed
the Parties that it had decided not to grant Canada leave for a further submission, and would instead
convene a procedural telephone conference to discuss with the Parties a means to ensure the
production of responsive documents within a useful time period while retaining the agreed hearing

dates in April 2019.

157. On 16 November 2018, Canada submitted its reply on the issue of confidentiality, in

accordance with the Tribunal’s instructions of 10 November 2018.

158. On 19 November 2018, the President held the case management teleconference with the
Parties. An audio recording of the teleconference was made available to the Parties and the
Tribunal following the call. During the teleconference, at the invitation of the President, the Parties
agreed to take a number of steps aimed at completing the document production phase as efficiently

as possible.

159. By letter of 22 November 2018, the Tribunal reminded the Parties of the various steps
agreed during the case management teleconference. In accordance with the Tribunal’s directions,

both Parties submitted letters on 25 November 2018 providing certain information requested by

4l

Public Version

the Tribunal. GTH submitted exhibits C-429 to C-431 with its letter, and Canada submitted

exhibits R-295 to R-298 with its letter concerning privilege under the ICA.

160. On 29 November 2018, the Parties submitted a Stern Schedule containing their respective
positions on the disputed issues relating to GTH’s assertion of legal privilege. It was accompanied
by Canada’s exhibits R-299 to R-320 and legal authorities RL-256 to RL-261, and GTH’s legal
authorities CL-189 to CL-192.

161. On 2 December 2018, GTH confirmed that its positions in the Stern Schedule did not take
account of new arguments advanced by Canada and that it would be available if the Tribunal

wished to hear GTH’s position on these matters.

162. On7 December 2018, GTH confirmed that the Parties had agreed to the redactions of PO2,
and provided the non-confidential version of the Order, which was published on the ICSID

website.

163. On 13 December 2018, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 5, including Annex A
(“POS”), containing its decision on each outstanding issue of legal privilege that had been

identified by the Parties in their Stern Schedule dated 29 November 2018.

164. In POS, the Tribunal addressed the Parties’ submissions on whether there is an exception
to the waiver of privilege where parties have a common interest. The Tribunal held that, “the onus
is on GTH to demonstrate that the law applicable to privilege for each communication recognises
common interest privilege and that the communication qualifies for common interest privilege.” !°*
GTH was granted leave to present evidence concerning the attachment of common interest

privilege for each relevant communication, provided that it did so without delay.

165. The Tribunal also noted in POS that if the Parties sought further guidance or a
determination from the Tribunal in relation to limited waivers of legal privilege, the Tribunal

would require better particularised pleadings in this respect.

42

Public Version

166. By email of 20 December 2018, GTH informed the Tribunal that it planned to make
submissions with respect to common interest privilege and limited waiver of privilege, pursuant
to POS. In response, the Tribunal encouraged the Parties to attempt to reach an agreement on these
matters. The Tribunal instructed the Parties that, if they were unable to reach such an agreement,

they should make precise submissions in the form of a Stern Schedule.

167. On 7 January 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal that they had been unable to reach
agreement on the remaining issues of legal privilege. On behalf of the Parties, Canada submitted
the Stern Schedule containing the Parties’ respective positions on these matters.'” It was

accompanied by Canada’s exhibits R-321 to R-358 and GTH’s exhibits C-432 to C-447.

168. On 11 January 2019, the Parties informed the Tribunal of certain agreements they had
reached relating to the Procedural Timetable. They provided further clarification about their
agreement on 23 January 2019, and in response, the Tribunal issued a revised Procedural

Timetable on 28 January 2019.

169. On 18 January 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 6, including Annex A
(“PO6”) containing its decision on common interest privilege, limited waiver of privilege and

subject matter waiver of privilege.

170. By letter of 22 January 2019, Canada requested information regarding the relationship
between Mr. Born and GTH’s counsel, Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, LLP. GTH responded on
27 January 2019, and Mr. Born provided a statement on 28 January 2019. On 30 January 2019,
Canada stated that it appreciated the clarifications and had taken note of Mr. Born’s statement that
no present or past relation with Gibson Dunn & Crutcher, LLP affects his independence or

impartiality in this arbitration.

171. By letter of 27 January 2019, GTH sought leave to (a) include in the evidentiary record
documents produced pursuant to PO6, and (b) adduce new evidence of un-waived privilege for
certain categories of documents. The Tribunal responded on 30 January 2019. It granted GTH’s

first request, noting that Canada would be permitted to submit any responsive evidence within

1 The Claimant subsequently informed the Tribunal that its supporting documentation had not been properly
numbered in the Stern Schedule and filed a corrected version.

43

Public Version

seven days after GTH filed the new documents. Regarding GTH’s second request, the Tribunal

invited Canada to comment.

172. On 3 February 2019, Canada submitted its Rejoinder on Merits and Damages and Reply
on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, including exhibits R-359 to R-598, legal authorities RL-262 to
RL-329, the Second Expert Report of The Brattle Group, the Second Legal Expert Report of Prof.
Dr. Mohamed S. Abdel Wahab, and the Rejoinder Witness Statements of Jenifer Aitken, Peter Hill

and Iain Stewart (“Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply”).

173. By letter of 12 February 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been
unable to reach agreement on the remaining issues of legal privilege. Canada requested “that the
Tribunal apply Article 3.8 of the IBA Rules and organise the tendering by GTH of certain non-

disclosed and redacted documents to a Tribunal-appointed neutral expert.”

174. Upon the invitation of the Tribunal, GTH responded to Canada’s letter on 15 February
2019. GTH opposed Canada’s request for an expert review of the disputed documents and
suggested that the Tribunal itself conduct a review to resolve the Parties’ outstanding dispute over
the two categories of documents addressed in GTH’s letter of 27 January 2019 and certain other

redacted documents.

175. Canada responded to GTH’s proposal by letter of 18 February 2019. Canada stated that it
was “willing to proceed with the Tribunal reviewing certain documents rather than appointing an

independent expert to do so.”

176. By letter of 19 February 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that, in light of the Parties’
agreement, the Tribunal would conduct the review of documents. The Tribunal instructed the
Parties to consult regarding the precise scope of the Tribunal’s review and offered guidance in this
regard. The Tribunal also instructed GTH to submit a hyperlinked schedule of the disputed

documents to the Tribunal no later than 25 February 2019.

177. On 25 February 2019, GTH informed the Tribunal that, despite the Parties’ continued
discussions regarding GTH’s privilege claims, there remained more than 160 documents in
dispute. GTH shared its view that “it would be neither procedurally fair nor proper for the Tribunal

to review all of these documents.” Therefore, GTH stated that “the only timely and procedurally

44

Public Version

fair way forward is to accept Respondent’s suggestion that an independent third party be appointed

to review all of the disputed privileged documents.”

178. The Tribunal responded to the Parties on the same day. It noted that, considering Canada’s
letter of 12 February 2019 and GTH’s letter of 25 February 2019, the Tribunal understood there to
be a joint application by the Parties to appoint an independent expert to review the disputed
documents. The Tribunal granted the application and confirmed that it had identified a list of
potential candidates and instructed ICSID to contact them to inquire about their availability and
independence. The Parties were instructed to consult and attempt to agree on detailed Terms of

Reference and a list of documents to be provided to the expert.

179. The Parties submitted their joint proposed Terms of Reference on 28 February 2019. After
reviewing the Parties’ proposal and making certain additions, the Tribunal provided the revised
Terms of Reference to the Parties for their consideration. Both Parties subsequently confirmed

their agreement with the revised Terms of Reference.

180. On 1 March 2019, the President of the Tribunal held a pre-hearing teleconference with the
Parties to discuss the organization of the upcoming hearing. Following the teleconference, the

President deliberated with his co-arbitrators regarding the outstanding issues.

181. On2 March 2019, the Tribunal informed the Parties that it intended to appoint Dr. Patricia
Shaughnessy to serve as the independent expert, and that Dr. Shaughnessy had confirmed her
availability and independence. The Parties were given until the following day to raise any objection

to the appointment.

182. As neither Party raised any objection, on 3 March 2019, the Tribunal confirmed the

appointment of Dr. Shaughnessy as the independent expert, and she signed the Terms of Reference.

183. On 4 March 2019, GTH provided Dr. Shaughnessy with a hyperlinked schedule of the
disputed documents. Dr. Shaughnessy conducted her review and, on 12 March 2019, submitted

her assessment to the Tribunal.

184. On 14 March 2019, the Tribunal issued two orders: Procedural Order No. 7 (“PO7”)

containing the Parties agreements and the Tribunal’s decisions relating to the organization of the

45

Public Version

hearing; and Procedural Order No. 8, including Annex A (“PO8”), by which it adopted Dr.

Shaughnessy’s assessment of the privilege issues.

185. On 5 March 2019, GTH filed its Rejoinder on Jurisdiction and Admissibility, including
exhibits C-448 to C-455, legal authorities CL-193 to CL-213, the Second Expert Report of
Dr. Hani Sarie-Eldin and the Second Witness Statement of Mr. David L. C. Dobbie (Jur.

Rejoinder”).

186. On 18 March 2019, GTH wrote to the Tribunal, challenging the completeness of Canada’s

document production pursuant to PO3 and requesting certain relief from the Tribunal.

187. In response, the President of the Tribunal wrote to the Parties to encourage them to confer
together with an aim to reaching a consensus on the matters outlined in GTH’s letter. In the event
the Parties were unable to agree, the President invited Canada to provide a response. By letter of
23 March 2019, Canada informed the Tribunal that the Parties had been unable to resolve their

disagreement and set out its response to GTH’s letter of 18 March 2019.

188. On 25 March 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural Order No. 9, including Annex A
(“PO9”) containing its decision on GTH’s request of 18 March 2019.

189. A hearing on jurisdiction, merits and quantum took place at the Word Bank Office in Paris

from 1 to 12 April 2019 (the “Hearing”). The following persons were present at the Hearing:

190. On 23 April 2019, GTH submitted an application requesting that the Tribunal make certain
inferences in relation to five exhibits on the record: C-258, C-261, C-262, C-264, and C-333.
Canada requested leave to respond, which the Tribunal granted. On 29 April 2019, Canada
submitted its response. The Tribunal then invited GTH to indicate whether it wished to reply, and

in response, GTH stated that it did not consider it necessary to comment further at that time.
191. On 24 May 2019, each Party submitted its Post-Hearing Submission.
192. On 11 June 2019, each Party submitted its Submission on Costs.

193. On 21 November 2019, GTH submitted a letter to the Tribunal seeking leave to submit
nine new documents into the record. GTH attached these nine documents as Appendices A to I to

the Application.

194. On24 November 2019, the Tribunal acknowledged receipt of the Application and provided
instructions to the Parties. The Tribunal noted that GTH had referenced being prejudiced by not
being able to make arguments or to cross examine witnesses on the nine documents. In this regard,

the Tribunal stated:

The Tribunal is concerned about allegations of impairment of a Party’s right to fully state
its case. Claimant is invited to specify by no later than 27 November 2019 whether the
Application is limited to seeking leave to submitting the nine appendices A to I on the
record or is also meant to include any further requests.

196. By email of 26 November 2019, GTH replied to the Tribunal’s query and confirmed that
“the Application is limited to seeking leave to submit Appendices A to I into the record as new

Factual Exhibits and does not seek other relief.”

197. On 4 December 2019, Canada submitted its response to the Application, together with

Annex A and Appendices A to F.

198. On 8 December 2019, the Tribunal issued Procedural No. 10, including Annex A
(“PO10”), addressing GTH’s request of 21 November 2019. The Tribunal decided to grant GTH’s

request with respect to each of the nine documents.

199. In the meantime, on 27 November 2019, the Parties jointly requested that the Tribunal

VI. JURISDICTION AND ADMISSIBILITY

206. Canada’s position is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction over GTH’s claims because: (a)
GTH does not qualify as an “investor” under Article I(g) of the BIT; (b) Article II(4)(b) of the BIT
deprives the Tribunal of jurisdiction over GTH’s claims concerning the Transfer Framework;
(c) the claims are time-barred under Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT; and (d) Article IV(2)(d)
excludes GTH’s national treatment claims from dispute resolution under the BIT. Canada objects
to the admissibility of GTH’s claims relating to the treatment of Wind Mobile on the basis that

GTH lacks standing to bring these claims.

207. The following table reflects Canada’s view of how its objections affect GTH’s claims.7°

208. Inresponse, GTH asserts that Canada’s objections must be dismissed because the Tribunal
has jurisdiction over all of GTH’s claims, and the claims relating to the treatment of Wind Mobile

are admissible.

209. Below, the Tribunal addresses the applicable legal standard and each of Canada’s five

objections. The Tribunal’s decision on jurisdiction and admissibility is contained in Section VI.G.

A. APPLICABLE LEGAL STANDARD
(wD Canada’s Position

210. Canada submits that the burden of establishing the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over GTH’s
claims lies with GTH.”” As stated by the tribunal in Tulip v. Turkey, “it is for Claimant to satisfy
the burden of proof required at the jurisdictional phase,” and this burden remains with the claimant
even when a jurisdictional objection is raised by a respondent.?° In this regard, Canada cites

National Gas v. Egypt, in which the tribunal reasoned as follows:

Although it is the Respondent which has here raised specific jurisdictional objections, it is
not for the Respondent to disprove the Tribunal’s jurisdiction. Under international law, as
a matter of legal logic and the application of the principle traditionally expressed by the
Latin maxim “actori incumbit probatio”, it is for the Claimant to discharge the burden of
proving all essential facts required to establish jurisdiction for its claims.?°°

211. Thus, according to Canada, only when a claimant has proven the facts necessary to

establish jurisdiction does “the burden shift[] to the respondent to show why, despite the facts

proved by the claimant, the tribunal does not have jurisdiction.”?°”

212. Further, in Canada’s view, a State’s consent to jurisdiction must be “clearly and
208

unambiguously ascertained”; if there is any ambiguity, a tribunal should decline jurisdiction.
213. Canada contends that, in this case, its consent to arbitration contained in Article XIII of the
BIT is conditioned on a potential claimant satisfying certain requirements and procedures.””
According to Canada, these conditions are fundamental bases of its consent. Canada highlights
Article XIII(5) of the BIT, which states that “[e]ach Contracting Party hereby gives its
unconditional consent to the submission of a dispute to international arbitration in accordance with

the provisions of this Article.”?!°

214. For Canada, it follows that GTH must prove that it has fulfilled all the requirements of

Article XIII of the BIT in order to establish the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.7!!

(2) GTH’s Position

215. In its submissions on the legal standard applicable to Canada’s preliminary objections,
GTH does not challenge Canada’s position regarding the burden of proof.*!* GTH focuses instead
on the applicable rules of treaty interpretation, arguing that Canada’s objections rest on a flawed

interpretation of the BIT.?°

216. GTH submits that the Tribunal must interpret the BIT’s jurisdictional requirements in
accordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (the “WCLT”), which provides the

principles of customary law applicable to treaty interpretation.?!*

217. According to GTH, Canada’s interpretation of the BIT is inconsistent with these rules in

the following ways:

d.

(3)

Canada fails to interpret the ordinary meaning of certain terms in accordance with
Article 31 of the VCLT. In particular, Canada’s interpretation “undermines the BIT’s

purpose to promote the free flow of investments between the Parties.”?!°

Canada ignores the express terms of the BIT and instead improperly relies on
supplementary means of interpretation, such as Canada’s other treaties. This approach

is contrary to Article 32 of the VCLT. ?!°

Canada does not attempt to find the meaning of terms that best reconciles the multiple
authentic texts of the BIT (the English, French and Arabic versions) and instead relies

on interpretations that cannot be supported by all three versions.?!”

There are no special rules of interpretation for treaty provisions dealing with a State’s
consent to arbitration. Yet, in an attempt to heighten the standard of proof, Canada
mischaracterizes the law and asserts that State’s consent to a tribunal’s jurisdiction

must be “unambiguously ascertained.”?!®

The Tribunal’s Analysis

218. The Tribunal notes that there is no disputed issue that it needs to decide on this matter at

this stage. The Tribunal need not decide on issues such as the burden of proof and treaty

interpretation in the abstract and will instead consider such matters when relevant in relation to

each jurisdictional objection in the sections below.

B. WHETHER GTH Is A QUALIFYING INVESTOR UNDER ARTICLE I(G) OF THE BIT

219. Canada’s first objection is that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione personae over all

GTH’s claims because GTH does not qualify as an “investor” under Article I(g) of the BIT.

Public Version

GTH argues that Canada’s objection is based on a misreading of the BIT and must be

dismissed.

221.

222.

(dd) Relevant Provision of the BIT

Article I(g) of the BIT defines “investor” as follows:

(g) “investor” means [...] in the case of the Arab Republic of Egypt:

any natural or juridical person, including the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt
who invests in the territory of Canada.

L..]

the term “juridical person” means any entity established in accordance with, and
recognized as a juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt: such as public
institutions, corporations, foundations, private companies, firms, establishments and
organizations, and having permanent residence in the territory of the Arab Republic of
Egypt.7!?

The Parties have also referred to the Arabic and French versions of this provision, which

together with the English are all equally authentic texts.

223.

224.

The definition of “investisseur” found in Article I(f) of the French BIT reads as follows:

« investisseur désigne » [...] Dans le cas de la République arabe d’Egypte : toute personne
physique ou morale, y compris le gouvernement de la République arabe d’Egypte, qui fait
un investissement sur le territoire canadien :

L..]

par le terme « personne morale », il faut entendre toute entité constituée en conformité avec
les lois de la République arabe d’Egypte et reconnue comme personne morale par ces lois:
dont les institutions publiques, les personnes morales proprement dites (ou corporations)
les fondations, les compagnies privées, les firmes, les établissements et les associations,
ayant le droit de résidence permanente sur le territoire de la République arabe d’Egypte.?”°

(2) Canada’s Position

225. Canada submits that GTH has failed to prove that it (a) was established in accordance with,
and recognized as juridical person by the laws of Egypt and (b) had its “permanent residence” in
Egypt at the time it filed the Request for Arbitration.” Thus, GTH is neither an “investor” under
the BIT nor a “National of another Contracting State” within the meaning of Article 25(2)(b) of
the ICSID Convention, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction ratione personae over GTH’s

claims.”

a. Establishing the Tribunal’s Jurisdiction Ratione Personae Under the ICSID
Convention and the BIT

226. According to Canada, GTH must prove that it was an “investor” under Article I(g) of the

BIT at the time it filed the Request for Arbitration on 28 May 2016 in order to establish the

Tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae under the ICSID Convention and the BIT.?”4

227. Canada highlights that its consent to arbitrate under Article 25 of the ICSID Convention
extends only to “a national of another Contracting State,” within the meaning of Article 25(2).??°
Canada asserts that Article 25(2)(b), which applies to juridical persons, “does not impose any

particular test” for determining the nationality of a juridical person and instead “leaves broad

(Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2009) [Excerpt], p. 284 (“The tribunal’s jurisdiction ratione personae

accordance with the relevant provision in the investment treaty and the municipal law of that contracting state party

discretion to the Contracting States to define ... corporate nationality, under the relevant BIT.”??6
Thus, in Canada’s view, the definition of “national of another Contracting State” is determined by
the nationality requirements contained in the applicable treaty. In the present case, those nationality

requirements are set forth in Article I(g) of the BIT.

228. Similarly, Canada asserts that its consent to arbitrate under Article XIII(1) of the BIT

extends only to a dispute with “an investor of the other Contracting Party.”??7

229. Therefore, Canada concludes, if GTH cannot prove that it qualified as an “investor” under
Article I(g) of the BIT “at the time of the alleged breaches, and that it continued to qualify as such

until the time that it commenced arbitral proceedings,” the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione

personae.?*8

b. Interpretation of Article I(g) of the BIT

230. Canada’s position is that under Article I(g) of the BIT, GTH must show that it had
permanent residence in Egypt on the date it submitted the Request for Arbitration.?? Canada

advances a number of arguments to support this interpretation.

231. First, in Canada’s view, the ordinary meaning of Article I(g) is that an entity must fulfil
two requirements to qualify as a “juridical person” in Egypt: the first requirement is to be

“established in accordance with, and recognized as a juridical person by the laws of the Arab

Republic of Egypt.”?*° Canada notes that these requirements are linked by the word “and,” which

indicates that the second requirement is separate from, and additional to, the first requirement.?*!

232. Second, Canada relies on the principle of effet utile, arguing that a contrary interpretation
would render the words “and having permanent residence in the territory of the Arab Republic of
Egypt” meaningless.”*? Canada cites Tenaris v. Venezuela, in which the tribunal applied the effet

utile principle to give meaning to the terms “sede” (seat in Portuguese) and “siége social” in the

 

applicable treaties. The tribunal stated that “if ‘siége social’ and ‘sede’ are to have any meaning,

and not be entirely superfluous, each must connote something different to, or over and above, the
purely formal matter of the address of a registered office or statutory seat.”?* Canada also cites
CEAC v. Montenegro and Mera v. Serbia, in which the tribunals found that the phrase “having its

seat ...” introduced an additional requirement into the definition of investor.7*4

233. Third, Canada asserts that its interpretation is supported by the context of the definition of
“investor” in the BIT, which includes a differently worded definitions for Canadian and Egyptian
investors.”*> The definition of a Canadian investor (which covers “any enterprise incorporated or
duly constituted in accordance with applicable laws of Canada, who makes the investment in the
territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt”) requires only incorporation and not permanent residency.
In Canada’s view, if the Contracting Parties had wanted both Canadian and Egyptian investors to
be covered by an incorporation test only, they would not have drafted asymmetrical definitions of
“investor” and included the permanent residency requirement in the definition of an Egyptian

234. Canada rejects GTH’s argument that Canada’s approach would undermine the reciprocal
nature of investment protection under the BIT.?*” For Canada, “an expectation that a BIT applies
in exactly the same way, to the same types of entities in both jurisdictions would be unrealistic,”
especially because the relevant rules of corporate law differ among States.?** Canada adds that
asymmetrical definitions of “investor” in investment treaties are not uncommon.” Indeed, the

scope of natural persons who qualify as investors under the BIT also differs between Canada and

Egypt.“°

235. Fourth, Canada argues that the equally authentic Arabic version of the BIT supports its
interpretation of Article I(g).74! The Arabic version is similar to the English version, except that it
includes the terms “which have” (in Arabic) instead of the present participle “having.” Thus,
according to Canada, the clause referring to permanent residency is introduced with the words
“and which have,” indicating a separate and additional requirement.”

236. Fifth, Canada denies that the equally authentic French text of the BIT undermines its
interpretation.**? Canada acknowledges that the French text is “slightly different” from the English
and Arabic texts, in that the final clause of the definition of “personne morale” (“juridical person’’)
is “ayant le droit de résidence permanente sur le territoire de la République arabe d’Egypte”
(“having the right to permanent residence in the Arab Republic of Egypt’). Thus, the word “and”
does not appear as in the English and Arabic texts, and the French text refers to “the right to
permanent residence” instead of “permanent residence.”“+

237. In Canada’s view, any difference in the meaning among the three authentic texts is removed
by the application of Article 31 of the VCLT.** In particular, Canada argues that the inclusion of
the phrase “ayant le droit de résidence permanente” in the French text, when read in context,
indicates that the Contracting Parties intended for only a subset of entities that meet the first

requirement to fall within the definition of “investisseur.”**°

238. Sixth, Canada argues that the principle of effet utile requires that the words “ayant le droit
de résidence permanente” be interpreted as adding something to the first part of the definition.

According to Canada:

Egyptian law does not recognize a concept of permanent residence for either natural or
juridical persons, meaning there is no right of permanent residence for legal entities under
Egyptian Law. In order for these terms to be given meaning, and be read consistently with
the English and Arabic texts, the reference to having a right of permanent residence in the

French text must be understood as requiring that the entity actually have permanent

residence in Egypt.
239. Seventh, Canada argues that its interpretation is the only way to reconcile the three
authentic texts of the BIT.*** In this regard, Canada points out that if the Tribunal does not find
that an interpretation of Article I(g) of the BIT under Articles 31 and 32 of the VCLT removes the
difference in meaning between the French version and the English and Arabic versions, the
Tribunal must adopt the meaning that best reconciles the three versions, in light of the object and
purpose of the Treaty.*4? According to Canada, because two of the three authentic versions of the
BIT require permanent residence in Egypt, the phrase “ayant le droit de résidence permanente”

should be interpreted as requiring the effective exercise of that right.*°°

240. Eighth, Canada denies that this interpretation would “stifle the object and purpose of the
BIT” by restricting its scope, as GTH alleges.*>! Canada urges the Tribunal to avoid overly broad
interpretations of the BIT on the basis of GTH’s “myopic view of a treaty’s object and purpose
that would systematically favour investors to the detriment of host States every time interpretive

issues need to be resolved.”?5?

47 Jur. Memorial, {| 62. Canada submits that “both experts on Egyptian law agree that the concept of ‘permanent

241. Finally, Canada contends GTH has not clearly explained the meaning it ascribes to the

words “and having permanent residence in the territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt,” and that,

in any event, none of the interpretations GTH advances is viable.”>?

242. In particular, Canada does not accept that the phrase refers to “another example of a type
of entity that qualifies as an Egyptian juridical person.”?°+ Canada agrees with GTH that the words
“such as” followed by a colon introduce a non-exhaustive list of entities that satisfy the
requirement of being established in accordance with, and recognized as juridical persons by
Egyptian law.?°> However, Canada argues that the list stops at the word “organizations” and is
followed by a participle clause (beginning with “..., and having”) which introduces an additional

condition.”°°

243. Similarly, Canada does not agree with GTH’s assertion, in relation to the French text, that
the phrase “ayant le droit de résidence permanent” is intended to “describe[] a common
characteristic amongst the preceding list of example entities.”?>” Canada highlights that this phrase

is set off with a comma and that “ayant” is not preceded by the word “or.”?°* In Canada’s view,

this means that the verb “ayant” is attached to the subject “toute entité’ rather than to any of the
example entities listed, and that the final clause must contain a separate requirement.”

Furthermore, Canada argues that GTH’s interpretation is not supported by its own expert on

ee” Thus, he evidently does not consider permanent

residence to be an inherent characteristic of the entities listed in Article I(g).

c. The Meaning of Permanent Residence

244. Canada submits that the concept of “permanent residence” in Article I(g) of the BIT refers

to the jurisdiction with which the entity has the strongest attachment and where it currently resides

and intends to continue residing.°!

245. In advancing its interpretation, Canada urges the Tribunal to interpret “permanent
residence” as an autonomous treaty concept in accordance with the VCLT.?° In Canada’s view,
this is necessary because Egyptian law does not recognize the concept of “permanent residence,”
especially in the context of juridical persons.” According to Canada, approaching “permanent
residence” as an autonomous treaty standard would be consistent with a number of arbitral
decisions addressing criteria such as “permanent residence” or “siége social.”?*+ For example, in
Binder v. Czech Republic, the tribunal decided that “permanent residence should be considered to

be a treaty concept and should as such be given an autonomous meaning and be interpreted

according to the principles of [the VCLT].”?°

246. Therefore, Canada considers the ordinary meaning of the terms “permanent” and

266

“residence,” with reference to the Oxford Dictionary,“°° and concludes that:

the ordinary meaning of “permanent residence” in a jurisdiction indicates that a juridical
person must have strong and enduring ties to that jurisdiction in terms of its business
activities, management and operations, and an intention to maintain these ties. Moreover,

these ties must be stronger than the entity’s ties to any other jurisdiction at the time when
the permanence of residence is assessed.7°”

247. According to Canada, this interpretation is supported by arbitral decisions interpreting

“permanent residence” requirements of investment treaties in the context of natural persons.?°* In

Binder v. Czech Republic, the tribunal found that an investor’s permanent residence is in the State
to which “the investor has the strongest attachment.” In Uzan v. Turkey, the tribunal found that

for a natural person to be “permanently residing” in a State, they must be legally permitted to

reside in that jurisdiction and must permanently reside there as a matter of fact.?”°

248. Canada also relies on Professor Abdel Wahab’s opinion that maintaining a principal place
of management in Egypt is “an indispensable prerequisite and a condition sine qua non of a
permanent residence.”?”! Canada disagrees with the opinion of Dr. Sarie-Eldin, who attempts to
equate “permanent residence” with “registered office.”?’? In Canada’s view, if that had been

Egypt’s intention, it would have included “registered office” as a requirement in the BIT, as it did

in its investment treaty with Finland.?”*

249. Finally, Canada offers an alternative argument in case the Tribunal disagrees that
“permanent residence” is an autonomous treaty standard or seeks guidance from Egyptian law. In

that event, Canada “agrees with GTH that the concept of domicile as understood in Egyptian law

e. Whether GTH was “established in accordance with, and recognized as a
juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt”

the BIT, GTH must show that it was “established in accordance with, and recognized as a juridical

person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt.””” In its Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply,
Canada set out a new allegation that GTH has not satisfied this requirement.*°° Canada states that
it “advances this argument for the first time in its Rejoinder because [it] is based on documents

produced in response to Canada’s document requests.”*"!

256. Canada’s position is that GTH cannot rely on its registration in the Egyptian Commercial
Register to establish that it is an “investor” under the BIT because GTH does not, as a matter of

fact, meet the requirements applicable to a joint stock company under Egyptian law.*°

257. In this regard, Professor Abdel Wahab cites Article 1 of the Companies Law of Egypt,
which provides that “[e]very company incorporated in the Arab Republic of Egypt shall locate its
principal place in Egypt.”* Thus, according to Professor Abdel Wahab, “having the actual

principal place of management in Egypt is a prerequisite to validly incorporate a JSC” and is also

“necessary to maintain the JSC’s good standing.”*™

258. In Professor Abdel Wahab’s opinion, the principal place of management of a juridical
person in Egypt “is the physical place where its actual board meetings are held.”*°> As noted above,
Canada alleges that GTH held no board meetings in Egypt after February 2015.*°° While GTH
alleges that it still holds general assembly meetings in Egypt, Professor Abdel Wahab considers
this irrelevant to determining the principal place of management because “the general assembly is

simply a meeting of shareholders and not the directors, who are entrusted with managing and

operating the company.”*”7

a. Interpretation of Article I(g) of the BIT

262. GTH argues that there is no “permanent residence” requirement in the BIT, as asserted by
Canada.*!? GTH considers that this is clear from the ordinary meaning of Article I(g) of the BIT

in all three authentic language versions.*!

263. In GTH’s view, Article I(g) of the BIT contains a broad definition of an Egyptian investor
this is a “juridical person” (“any entity established in accordance with, and recognized as a
juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt’), followed by the words “such as” and
acolon, which introduces a non-exhaustive list of entities that could qualify as a “juridical person”
separated by commas.*'* GTH notes that the phrase “and having permanent residence in the
territory of the Arab Republic of Egypt” follows the colon and is separated from the preceding

examples by acomma.*!> Therefore, GTH argues that this phrase “is yet another example of a type

of entity that qualifies as an Egyptian juridical person.”?!°

264. In this regard, GTH rejects Canada’s argument that the sentence resumes after the non-

exhaustive list of examples to introduce an additional condition applicable to “any entity.”?!7

According to GTH, the “dispositive grammatical rule on this issue is that a sentence does not

resume following a colon.”*!8

53 GTH considers that resort to supplementary means of interpretation is unnecessary because the ordinary meaning
of the BIT is clear. However, GTH argues that Egypt’s model BIT confirms its interpretation. Egypt’s model BIT
provides a definition for an Egyptian “juridical person” that replaces the commas separating each element of the list
in Article I(g) of the BIT with semi-colons. In GTH’s view, this makes it even clearer that Egypt intended “having
permanent residence” to serve as another example of a qualifying entity, rather than a separate requirement. Merits

Public Version

265. Turning to the French version of the BIT, GTH submits that there are two important
features of the text which confirm that “permanent residence” is not an independent requirement:
(a) after the list of examples, the text refers to entities “having the right to permanent residence”
in Egypt; and (b) that phrase is not preceded by the word “and.”!° Thus, in GTH’s view, that

“phrase describes a common characteristic amongst the preceding list of example entities,” and

any entity with the right to permanent residence in Egypt may qualify as a “juridical person.”??°

GTH asserts that this interpretation is consistent with Article 53 of the Egyptian Civil code, which

states that a juridical person is “entitled to ... [a]n independent domicile.”*7!

266. With respect to the Arabic version of the BIT, GTH notes that text is similar to the English
version and considers that the punctuation should be inferred from the English version.*?”
According to GTH, in the Arabic version, the phrase “and which have permanent residence” refers
back to the other example entities on the list.°”> For GTH, this is confirmed by the use of the plural

term “have,” because if the phrase referred to “any entity,” as Canada submits, it would have used

the singular “has.”>2+

267. GTH recognizes that there are differences in the language of the three authentic versions
of the BIT and asserts that the Tribunal must adopt the interpretation that best reconciles the three

texts.°?> In this regard, GTH states:

that the items in a list must be “equivalent grammatical units,” arguing that the authority cited by Canada does not
state such a requirement. Jur. Rejoinder, J 19; RL-265, The Chicago Manual of Style (17th ed. 2017), {ff 6.127-6.129.

The consistent element across the three equally authentic versions of the BIT is that while
entities having permanent residence form part of or describes the list of entities that qualify
as Egyptian juridical persons under the BIT, permanent residence is not an independent
requirement to qualify as an Egyptian juridical person investor.*”°

268. GTH contends that Canada’s alternative interpretation of Article I(g) of the BIT, which
adds a separate requirement that an entity must have a permanent residence in Egypt, is contrary

to the ordinary meaning of the three authentic texts of the BIT.*?”

269. GTH denies that the asymmetrical definitions of Egyptian and Canadian investors
somehow support Canada’s interpretation.*”* According to GTH, Canada’s argument undermines
the reciprocal promotion of investment and the equal and non-discriminatory treatment of
investors.°2? Further, GTH asserts that the definition of a Canadian “enterprise” investor is
“consistent in both structure and substance” with the definition of an Egyptian “juridical
person.”**° It includes “any enterprise incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with

[Canadian law]” and then lists examples.**!

270. Moreover, GTH argues that Canada fails to give meaning to the terms “the right to” in the
French version of the BIT, contrary to the principle of effet utile.*** GTH cites Canada’s
acknowledgement that its interpretation “accords with two out of the three versions of the
Canada-Egypt FIPA.”>* For GTH, this is insufficient to meet the mandate of Article 33(4) of
the VCLT.*** GTH considers Canada’s interpretation would also “stifle the object and purpose of
the BIT.”*

b. Meaning of Permanent Residence
271. GTH reviews the dictionary definitions of the terms “permanent” and “residence” and
concludes that the ordinary meaning of “permanent residence” is a place where an entity resides

for a continuing period.**°

272. GTH sees no basis for Canada’s argument that “permanent residence” indicates a single
place where an entity has the “strongest attachment.”*>” GTH’s submissions on this point include

the following arguments:

a. Canada’s interpretation is inconsistent with the ordinary meaning of “permanent

residence.”***

b. Canada’s interpretation would require multinational companies to have a single

permanent residence, which is illogical in light of the reality of corporate personality.**°

c. Tribunals have recognized that even natural persons may have more than one

permanent residence.*°

d. Canada attempts to impose something like a dominant nationality test, which is not

recognized as a general principle of international law.**! Canada’s own authorities

e. Canada draws its interpretation from two cases that address the question of whether a
natural person could advance a claim against the State of their nationality, which is
irrelevant in the present case.**? In any event, these decisions do not help Canada. In
Binder v. Czech Republic, the tribunal’s decision was based on the parties’ agreement
that the claimant could be an investor of only one of the State parties to the relevant
treaty, and the tribunal refused to exclude “the possibility of two permanent
residences.”*“4 In Uzan v. Turkey, the tribunal’s decision was based on specific treaty

language, which is not found in the BIT.*4°

273. GTH considers that although Egyptian law is of limited relevance in interpreting the BIT,

Egyptian law could provide the Tribunal with insight into Egypt’s intent in drafting Article I(g).*4°

In this regard, the Parties’ experts on Egyptian law agree that Egyptian law does not recognize the
concept of “permanent residence” for juridical persons.**” However, according to GTH, the

concept of “domicile” under Egyptian law is analogous to the concept of “permanent residence”

d. Whether GTH_ was “established in accordance with, and recognized as a
juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt”

277. In response to Canada’s position that GTH is not “established in accordance with, and
recognized as a juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt,” GTH contends that

this objection is untimely and, in any event, wrong.**

278. GTH refers to the requirement in the ICSID Arbitration Rules that jurisdictional objections
must be raised “as early as possible” and “no later than the expiration of the time limit fixed for
the filing of the counter-memorial.”** GTH asserts that, by raising this objection in its Merits
Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, Canada has failed to comply with this Rule. GTH does not accept
Canada’s explanation that the objection is based on documents GTH produced in the document
production phase.**” According to GTH, “every document except one Canada has cited to form
the factual basis of this objection is a publicly available document that Canada has had access to
for the duration of this Arbitration.”** The one document originating from GTH’s document
production could not have given rise to the new objection, as Canada itself states that this document
“expressly recognized” the points contained in the public documents.* Thus, GTH argues that

Canada’s objection must be dismissed as untimely.

279. In any event, GTH further argues that Canada’s objection has no merit, as GTH has been
established in accordance with and recognized as a juridical person by the laws of Egypt at all

times.37°

280. According to GTH, Canada’s position is based on Professor Abdel Wahab’s incorrect view

that an Egyptian joint stock company must have its “principal place of management” in Egypt.*”!

Dr. Sarie-Eldin explains that the relevant requirement is that a joint stock company must maintain

a “principal place” in Egypt that is registered on the commercial register.*”” GTH asserts that it
has met this requirement because at all times, the address on its commercial register was the Nile
City Towers complex in Cairo.*”> Thus, GTH is a valid Egyptian joint stock company, and no
Egyptian regulatory authority has alleged otherwise, despite knowing that some of GTH’s

functions have moved to The Netherlands.*”4

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis

281. The Parties dispute whether GTH was a qualifying “investor” of Egypt at the time of the
submission of the Request for Arbitration on 28 May 2016, as the term is defined in BIT Article
(g)275

282. The BIT provides two separate, and different, definitions for “investor” according to
whether the investor is Canadian or Egyptian. In this arbitration, only the latter is relevant. Within
the definition provided in Article I(g) for an Egyptian investor, separate meanings are ascribed to
an investor who is a natural person and to an investor which is a juridical person. Given the
undisputed status of GTH as a corporation,*”° only the definition of juridical person in Article I(g)

of the BIT is relevant to determine whether GTH is a protected investor.

283. As indicated in the BIT, the treaty has been authenticated in three languages: Arabic,
English and French, “all versions being equally authentic.”?’’ In relevant parts, Article I(g)

provides:

“investor” means: [...]

In the case of the Arab Republic of Egypt: [...]

any natural or juridical person any natural or juridical person, including the Government
of the Arab Republic of Egypt who invests in the territory of Canada. [...]

(ii) the term “juridical person” means any entity established in accordance with, and
recognized as a juridical person by the laws of the Arab Republic of Egypt: such as public
institutions, corporations, foundations, private companies, firms, establishments and
organizations, and having permanent residence in the territory of the Arab Republic of
Egypt?”

284. The corresponding terms in the equally authentic French and Arabic versions are as

follows:

285. As is obvious on their face, the three linguistic versions of the BIT are not identical. For
example, the Arabic version omits the reference to “and recognised as a juridical person by,” which
is found both in the English and in the French versions.**! Punctuation marks are also
inconsistently inserted in the relevant subparagraphs across the three linguistic versions. That said,
none of those differences casts doubt on the requirement in the BIT that an Egyptian investor that
is a juridical person must be established in accordance with the laws of Egypt and must have

permanent residence in the territory of Egypt.

relevant to its jurisdictional case. Day 2, Tr. 123:8-10.

82

Public Version

286. The foregoing two conditions of establishment and of permanent residence are cumulative.
GTH’s attempt to question the application of a requirement of permanent residence to a juridical
person based on its reading of the punctuation marks in Article I(g)(ii) of the BIT goes counter to
the explicit terms of that provision. Indeed, GTH’s submission that, because of the positioning of
the colon and of the comma in subparagraph (ii), the requirement of permanent residence only
applies to the specific categories listed after the colon but not generically to “any entity
established” goes counter to the ordinary meaning of the conjunction “and” appearing in the
English and in the Arabic version, and to the acceptable usage of the comma in the French version.
Taken together, those conjunction and punctuation mark, when read in light of Article 33(4) of the
VCLT, denote the intention of the drafters of the BIT to close the illustrative list of non-exhaustive
categories of juridical persons investors of Egypt (such as public institutions ... and organisations)
and return to a general requirement of “permanent residence” that is applicable to all juridical

persons regardless of the category.

287. The Tribunal notes that both Parties have made submissions on the point that the French

version of the BIT refers to “ayant le droit de résidence permanente,” which translates in English
as “having the right to permanent residence” in Egypt. On its face, that reference appears to set a
different standard from the equally authentic English and Arabic versions which require the
investor to “have permanent residence.”*** Neither Party nor their experts has suggested that the
French version sets a different standard that must prevail over the other versions of the BIT. In any
event, the Tribunal considers that it has been plainly evidenced in fact that GTH had been
established — not only had the right to become established — in accordance with the laws of Egypt
and remained so on the date of the Request for Arbitration,**? and that it is recognised as a juridical

person by the laws of Egypt and remained so on the date of the Request for Arbitration.*** The

because if it is fictitious in a way, not reflective of reality, the company risks nullity. That is the issue. MR BORN: But
when you say “risks nullity”, do you mean that non-compliance with that requirement is an automatic nullity, or that
something has to be done by legal process? A. (Professor Abdel Wahab) No, it has to be done by way of legal process.
MR BORN: And until that legal process is completed, the company is still a company? A. (Professor Abdel Wahab)
Yes, indeed.”

 

 

83

Public Version

following brief exchange at the hearing between the Tribunal and Canada’s Egyptian law expert

helpfully confirms those facts:

288.

MR BORN: Can I interject, just so that I’m sure I understand your testimony. I think you
agreed with Ms Madden that GTH is incorporated in Egypt and remains recognised under
Egyptian law as a joint stock company?

A. Indeed, Professor.°8°

This is further corroborated by GTH’s Egyptian law expert’s unqualified evidence at the

hearing:

289.

The second issue: is GTH established and recognised under Egyptian law? And again, my
conclusion is: yes, it is. Definitely and without any doubt, it has been incorporated in
compliance with Egyptian law and continued to be in compliance with Egyptian law, and
continues to be an Egyptian company. Because the only requirement to be an Egyptian
national as a company is to be incorporated under Egyptian law, and this is where you get
your nationality as an Egyptian company.**°

Canada’s submission that GTH “is not an entity established in accordance with the laws of

Egypt”*®” because GTH allegedly does not have a principal place of management in Egypt is

rebutted by the production by GTH of a contemporaneous extract from the Commercial Register,

approved by the Egyptian government, certifying that GTH has its headquarters in Egypt

290.

388

That first requirement for a qualifying investor under Article I(g)(ii) being established, the

Tribunal is therefore left with the task of determining whether GTH had permanent residence in

the territory of Egypt on the relevant date. The term “permanent residence” is not defined in the

BIT. Likewise, both Egyptian law experts instructed by the Parties agree that the term is not

defined either in Egyptian law.**° The Parties agreed in their pleadings,** and reiterated at the

hearing, that it is an autonomous treaty concept:

[MS TABET:] Now, how to interpret the concept of “permanent residence”: the best way,
by interpreting the treaty, if we accept that it’s an autonomous standard, not one that refers
to Egyptian law, is to adopt an ordinary meaning definition of “permanent residence”.

THE PRESIDENT: So you accept that “permanent residence”, in the definition of Egyptian
investor, is an autonomous concept of the treaty, and that the Tribunal does not have to
look at Egyptian law for interpreting it?

MS TABET: I think that is our position, and we have made alternative submissions as well.

THE PRESIDENT: Right. Could Claimant remind me if on that point that concords with
your submission? Do you accept that the Tribunal has to look only at the treaty to interpret
“permanent residence” in the definition of Egyptian investor?

MS MADDEN: Yes, this is a public international law question.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you. So the Tribunal does not have to look at the course of
conduct, or precedent in Egyptian diplomacy in concluding similar treaties; we’ll just
concentrate on that particular treaty?

MS MADDEN: [ think that’s right, yes, sir.
THE PRESIDENT: Canada confirms?

MS TABET: Yes.

THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, that’s helpful.°?!

291. The Tribunal will therefore be guided in its interpretation of the term “permanent
residence” by the rules of interpretation of treaties set out in VCLT, including in particular Articles

31 to 33.

Article 31. General rule of interpretation

1. A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be
given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose.

2. The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition
to the text, including its preamble and annexes:

(a) any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in
connexion with the conclusion of the treaty;

(b) any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the
conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the
treaty.

3. There shall be taken into account, together with the context:

(a) any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty
or the application of its provisions;

85

292.

Public Version

(b) any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement
of the parties regarding its interpretation;

(c) any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties.

  

4. A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended.

Article 32. Supplementary means of interpretation

Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory
work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning
resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the
interpretation according to article 31:

(a) leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or

(b) leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable.

Article 33. Interpretation of treaties authenticated in two or more languages

1. When a treaty has been authenticated in two or more languages, the text is equally
authoritative in each language, unless the treaty provides or the parties agree that, in case
of divergence, a particular text shall prevail.

2. A version of the treaty in a language other than one of those in which the text was
authenticated shall be considered an authentic text only if the treaty so provides or the
parties so agree.

3. The terms of the treaty are presumed to have the same meaning in each authentic text.

4. Except where a particular text prevails in accordance with paragraph 1, when a
comparison of the authentic texts discloses a difference of meaning which the application
of articles 31 and 32 does not remove, the meaning which best reconciles the texts, having
regard to the object and purpose of the treaty, shall be adopted.*°?

The Tribunal finds no support in the BIT for Canada’s contention that “permanent

residence,” as used in the BIT, requires strong and enduring ties “that must be stronger than the

entity’s ties to any other jurisdiction at the time when the permanence of residence is assessed.”*?

For an international corporation engaged in business in numerous markets to be required to have

a single permanent residence would be an extraordinary limitation and a departure from customary

and legitimate means of doing business that ought only be considered where the BIT itself or,

absent that and in accordance with the VCLT, its preparatory work or the circumstances of its

conclusion warrant such a construction. No such evidence is adduced by Canada. The Tribunal
considers that a juridical person can have more than one permanent residence absent an overriding

mandatory limitation in the applicable laws.

293. The Tribunal agrees with Canada that the Contracting Parties agreed to promote foreign
investments only according to the terms of the BIT and its scope provisions.*°** However, where
those terms are provided without limitation as is the case in Article I(g)(ii) for “permanent
residence,” the Tribunal cannot imply arbitrary limitations for that would unbalance the BIT’s
substantive provisions.*°° As GTH rightly points out,*°° Canada’s reliance on Binder v. Czech
Republic overlooks the essential linchpin on which that award rests expressis verbis: “the Parties
agree that the BIT envisages a permanent residence in one State only.”**” There is no evidence of

any such agreement between the Parties in these proceedings as concerns the Egypt-Canada BIT.

294. The Tribunal also considered Canada’s Egyptian law expert’s opinion that, under Egyptian
law referred to in Article I(g)(ii), “permanent residence” means the principal place of management.

To that end, the expert testified as follows:

So if a company that is presumably an Egyptian joint stock company just maintains an
office, this is not demonstrative of domicile or permanent residence, as indicative also of
the company being a foreign company, because an Egyptian company would have its
principal place of management in Egypt.***

295. Domestic procedural matters such as the address where a company may be validly served
with legal documents and other corporate issues governed by the Egyptian Companies Act*” are
of little assistance to this Tribunal for the purpose of determining its jurisdiction over an investor
pursuant to the identification of its permanent residence, an autonomous treaty concept.*”° The
Tribunal considers that any contention implying a notion of exclusiveness in the identification of
the permanent residence of a company faces the difficulty that, in all three linguistic versions of
Article I(g)(ii), “permanent residence” is ascribed no qualifications, and requires no minimum bar
or specific material manifestations. A registered office, as evidenced in the contemporaneous
Commercial Register extract adduced in evidence, suffices to show “permanent residence”.‘°!

also accepts that the determination of the relevant place is a factual determination.* The
officially-certified, signed and stamped extract of the Commercial Register,** an Egyptian
government-issued document, referring to the headquarters of GTH at the relevant time as being
located in Egypt, is accepted by the Tribunal as sufficient evidence of the company’s establishment

in accordance with, and of its recognition as a juridical person by, the laws of Egypt.

299. As to submissions attempting to infer support from the concept of natural persons’ domicile
under any of the Contracting Parties’ domestic laws, they are simply irrelevant in the case of

corporate investors, because the BIT explicitly differentiates in Article I(g) between their

definition in subparagraph (ii) and that of individual investors in subparagraph (i).

As such, GTH meets the requirements for an “investor” as defined in the BIT.

Cc. WHETHER ARTICLE II(4)(B) OF THE BIT DEPRIVES THE TRIBUNAL OF JURISDICTION
OVER GTH’s CLAIMS RELATING TO THE VOTING CONTROL APPLICATION

301. Canada’s second objection is aimed at GTH’s claim concerning the national security

review conducted in the context of GTH’s attempt to acquire voting control of Wind Mobile.

According to Canada, this claim is excluded from the dispute resolution provision of the BIT

pursuant to Article II(4)(b) of the BIT, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction over the claim.

302. GTH argues that Canada’s objection must be dismissed because GTH’s claim does not
relate to an “acquisition” within the meaning of Article II(4) of the BIT.*!? Rather, it relates to the
exercise of rights already acquired at the time it made its investment, before the national security
review. Alternatively, GTH asserts that its claim concerns the process leading up to | |

ee not the decision itself and is therefore permitted

under Article II(4)(a) of the BIT.4

(dd) Relevant Provision of the BIT

303. Article II(4) of the BIT provides that:

(a) Decisions by either Contracting Party, pursuant to measures not inconsistent with this
Agreement, as to whether or not to permit an acquisition shall not be subject to the
provisions of Articles XIII or XV of this Agreement.

(b) Decisions by either Contracting Party not to permit establishment of a new business
enterprise or acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise by
investors or prospective investors shall not be subject to the provisions of Article XIII of
this Agreement.*!*

(2) Canada’s Position

304. Canada submits that the ordinary meaning of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT is unambiguous:
any decision falling within the scope of the provision is excluded from investor-State dispute
settlement.*!> In other words, Canada has not consented to arbitrate any dispute arising out of a
decision covered by Article II(4)(b) of the BIT, regardless of whether such a decision is subject to

obligations contained in the BIT.*'°

305. In Canada’s view, the object and purpose of Article II(4)(b) is to allow the Contracting
Parties to retain their sovereignty over decisions concerning the establishment or acquisition of
businesses, which can be sensitive.*!? Canada asserts that most investment treaties contain some

form of limitation or exclusion in this respect.*!*

306. According to Canada, decisions made pursuant to the ICA fall within the scope of Article
II(4)(b) of the BIT. Canada argues that this is by design; it “has always sought in all of its trade

and investment agreements a broad exclusion for its ICA review process and the result of such

of Wind Mobile was clearly an “acquisition” within the meaning of Article II(4)(b).4° According
to Canada, it is undisputed that through the proposed transaction, GTH sought to convert Class D

313. In light of the above, Canada asserts that the challenged measures fall within
Article II(4)(b) as a decision not to permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a

share of such enterprise.

(3) GTH’s Position

314. GTH’s primary position is that Article II(4) of the BIT is irrelevant because the Voting

Control Application was not an attempted “acquisition” within the meaning of that provision.**!

Therefore, Canada’s objection must be dismissed.

315. In this regard, GTH argues that the subject of its Voting Control Application was neither
the acquisition of Wind Mobile nor the acquisition of shares in Wind Mobile, but rather a
conversion of GTH’s non-voting shares into voting shares in order to take control of Wind

Mobile.” GTH asserts that it could not acquire something it already owned.

316. GTH does not accept Canada’s “highly formalistic argument about the mechanics of a

share conversion,” which in GTH’s view, ignores the fact that GTH was seeking to exercise its

pre-existing right to obtain control over Wind Mobile once the O&C Rules were relaxed.”

317. GTH alleges that at the time it submitted the Voting Control Application, Canada
recognized that the transaction was not an acquisition but a share conversion. i

318. According to GTH, Canada supports its objection by expanding the scope of the term
“acquisition” in Article II(4) to cover “all forms of transactions that lead to gaining control or
ownership of the enterprise.”#45 In GTH’s view, there is no basis for this addition to the text; if the
Contracting Parties had intended Article II(4) to cover an acquisition of control, they would have

done so.“

319. Similarly, GTH sees Canada’s submissions relating to the ICA as an attempt to improperly
expand the scope of Article II(4).” According to GTH, the language of the ICA is clearly broader
than Article II(4) in that it allows Canada to review a proposed investment when a non-Canadian
seeks “to acquire control of a Canadian business.”#* Yet Canada seeks to import this domestic
law into the BIT to avoid its international obligations.” GTH notes that the BIT does not contain
a reference to the ICA, whereas Canada has explicitly and clearly named that legislation “where it

meant to do so in other treaties.”4°

320. GTH submits that in considering Canada’s objection, the Tribunal should not simply
“accept Canada’s bald assertion that its actions fall under any particular carve-out,” but should

examine the factual record and consider whether Canada’s conduct was bona fide.**!

321. GTH’s alternative argument is that, even if the Tribunal were to find that the Voting
Control Application was an “acquisition,” GTH’s claim does not fall within the exclusion of
Article II(4).*°? According to GTH, when Article II(4) is considered as a whole, it becomes clear
that the provision covers only decisions relating to acquisitions and not to the process of reaching

such decisions. *?

322. Based on a comparison of the language of subparagraphs (a) and (b) of Article II(4), GTH

makes the following observations:

a. Article II(4)(a) covers all acquisitions, whereas Article II(4)(b) covers only
“acquisition[s] of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise.”

Therefore, only Article II(4)(a) could apply to the Voting Control Application, given

that the alleged “acquisition” related to voting control of Wind Mobile.**+

b. Article II(4)(a) refers to the decision-making process (“whether or not to permit”),
whereas Article II(4)(b) refers to the decision itself. Therefore, the exception to dispute

resolution does not apply to a decision-making process relating to acquisitions.*>

323. GTH concludes that, even if Article II(4) were applicable, it could not exclude GTH’s

claims because the subject of those claims Bo
that decision-making process falls within the Tribunal’s jurisdiction under Article II(4)(a). In
addition, GTH asserts that under Article II(4)(a), Ee
fF remains subject to dispute resolution because the dispute arises from measures

inconsistent with its obligations under the BIT.”4°*

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis

324. The decisions in this section of the Award are taken by a majority of the Tribunal.

325. In support of its second jurisdictional challenge based on Article II(4)(b) of the BIT,
Canada advances both its construction of the relevant BIT provision and policy reasons to show
rr 1h
from the arbitration mechanism set out in Article XIII of the BIT.**? The Tribunal, by a majority,

finds neither of those two grounds to be convincing.

326. First, Canada’s reference to its treaty practice allegedly systematically excluding from
international treaty dispute settlement mechanisms ICA-related decisions in respect of the
establishment or acquisition of a business enterprise is insufficient to deny the Tribunal’s
jurisdiction under the BIT. The Tribunal must determine the scope of its jurisdiction with reference
to the terms of the BIT, as interpreted in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT. Consistent with
its alleged practice, Canada could have specifically referred to its foreign ownership and control
legislation in Article II(4)(b) of the BIT; it has not done so, although the ICA had been enacted in
1985 and, as such, predated the BIT.

327. The additional argument that Canada refrained from specifically naming the ICA in the
BIT to afford symmetrical protection to both Contracting States is not persuasive either. The BIT

features other protections afforded nominally to one or the other of the Contracting States and their

457

458 Merits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial, { 174.
+59 Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, {1 96 et seq

98

Public Version

respective nationals without any consistent symmetrical approach (e.g., Article I(g) and the

Annex).

328. Second, the Tribunal is not persuaded by Canada’s argument that, for the purpose of
acquiring voting control of Wind Mobile, GTH’s intended conversion of Class D non-voting
shares of Wind Mobile into Class B voting shares involves an “acquisition of shares” within the

meaning of Article II(4)(b) or, as Canada put it more synthetically at the hearing:

The share conversion is an acquisition of shares, and in this case it also amounts to an
acquisition of Wind Mobile.*°

329. The Amended and Restated Shareholders’ Agreement**! to which Canada refers mentions
in section 4 of Schedule C a conversion of Class D non-voting shares into Class B voting shares
on the basis of one Class D share for each Class B share. The fact that the mechanism involves a
return of Class D share certificates and the issue of Class B share certificates does not mean, absent
evidence of an animus novandi, that new Class B shares are acquired. It is simply that the
shareholder’s rights over the shares are enhanced with the ability to vote. Had the conversion of
Class D shares into Class B shares involved an obligation to “acquire” ownership of the Class B
shares to achieve the conversion, GTH would in all logic have had to “sell” its Class D shares
which, being nominative, would have had to be annulled. This would have triggered a reduction
in Wind Mobile’s corporate capital, even for a scintilla temporis, until capital is increased with the
issue of the new Class B shares. A complex annulment/issue/acquisition of share process of that
sort would be expected to be mentioned in a sophisticated document like the Amended and
Restated Shareholders’ Agreement. No such mention can be found therein. The fact is that the

Agreement only refers to a conversion of shares, and does so consistently throughout. As GTH

“© Day 2, Tr. 113:16-18. See also Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, {| 100 (“The share conversion process thus

res of Wind Mobile that it did not previousl: ly own. The exclusion in Article II(4)(b) is not limited to certain types

of share acquisitions. Conversion of shares is one of the ways of realizing an acquisition of shares, because the

shareholder has to return the original certificates (i.e. ceases to own them), and in exchange receives new shares from
the company. The fact that the term conversion is used does not negate the legal nature of the transaction taking place
whereby one set of shares is cancelled in exchange for another set of shares with different attributes”).

puts it: “GTH sought to convert non-voting shares that it already owned by exercising a preexisting

right, that GTH had already acquired, to assume voting control of its investment.“

330. As to Canada’s argument that GTH has referred in some of its correspondence to
“acquisition,” it is difficult to draw any firm inferences out of inconsistent references, the reason
being that those references often are made to issues other than the conversion of the non-voting

shares. Importantly, those references — if they were to be considered — ought to be read against

ine following ster
331. Canada ran a further case to the effect that:
the acquisition of voting shares would also have amounted to an acquisition of the
enterprise resulting from an acquisition of legal control. Article II(4) applies to decisions
not to permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such
enterprise.'** There is no basis on which to limit the exclusion to certain forms of

acquisitions of an existing business enterprise. Acquisitions of existing business enterprises
are often realized through acquisitions of control.

  

w

32. Canada supports its contention by referring to subsection 28(1) of the ICA, which includes
a reference to the acquisition of voting control.’ The difficulty for Canada is that the BIT refers
to the “acquisition of an existing business enterprise, or a share of an enterprise,” but not to the
acquisition of voting control. One cannot be held to be necessarily subsumed in the other. Absent
a reference in the BIT to the acquisition of legal control, and in conformity with the general rule

of interpretation in Article 31(1) of the VCLT, the majority of the Tribunal considers that the BIT

Public Version

refers in Article II(4)(b) to the acquisition of an enterprise or a share thereof in the sense of

ownership as opposed to control.

333. It should be added that the object and purpose of the treaty — a general interpretation
standard under Article 31(1) of the VCLT - commands that potentially choosing a broad
interpretation of the terms of the treaty so as to read a reference to an “acquisition of an existing
business enterprise or a share of such enterprise” as including an acquisition of legal control should
only be considered with caution. Broadening exclusions from the protections accorded in the BIT
by a Contracting Party to nationals of the other Contracting Party, beyond their explicit terms,
would hardly be conducive to the encouragement of the creation of favourable conditions for

investors to make investments.

334. Therefore, the Tribunal, by a majority, decides that it cannot accept Canada’s assertion that
the challenged measures fall within the scope of Article II(4)(b) of the BIT as a decision not to
permit the acquisition of an existing business enterprise or a share of such enterprise. The objection

on jurisdiction is therefore rejected.

335. With the above determination made, the Tribunal need not go into the additional argument
that GTH adduces seeking to differentiate between “a decision” and “the process of reaching that

decision.”4°

336. One Member of the Tribunal considers that the exception under Article II(4) of the BIT to
the right of the investor to submit disputes to arbitration is applicable to the present dispute. This
Member considers that the measure complained of here concerned the acquisition of voting control
over Wind Mobile and thus constitutes an “acquisition ... of an existing business enterprise” within
the meaning of Article II(4), interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to
be given to those terms in their context and in the light of the object and purpose of the BIT. The

467

focus in that Article in its English and French texts*°’ is on the acquisition of a “business

enterprise,” i.e., an economic entity rather than a legal entity; and from the point of view of the

466 Thid., W169 et seq. Day 1, Tr. 167:10.

467 While the Arabic text may have a narrower meaning or connotation, confining the reference to a ‘company’ rather
than an ‘enterprise’, this Member considers that the best reconciliation of the treaty texts, in accordance with the
principle set out in Article 33(4) of the VCLT, points to a wider concept of a ‘business enterprise’.

Contracting Parties, for whose benefit the Article II(4) exception is established, the acquisition of
control is at least as significant in the context of the control of foreign investment (with which the
BIT is by its nature essentially concerned) as is the acquisition of rights of financial participation
in a business without any correlative rights to control that business. Furthermore, this Member
considers that the object and purpose of the treaty is not confined to the promotion and protection
of investments, but must be understood to include both the fair treatment of investments and the
preservation of certain regulatory competences for the State hosting the investment. The majority
of the Tribunal has considered the minority’s opinion, but decided that it does not change its

interpretation of the provision.

D. WHETHER ARTICLE IV(2)(D) OF THE BIT DEPRIVES THE TRIBUNAL OF JURISDICTION
OVER THE CLAIMANT’S NATIONAL TREATMENT CLAIMS

337. Canada’s next objection targets GTH’s claim that Canada breached its national treatment

obligations contained in the BIT. Canada submits that this claim is precluded by the reservation it

made pursuant to Article 1V(2)(d) of the BIT, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction ratione

materiae over the claim.**

338. In response, GTH argues that this objection must be dismissed because (a) Canada never
exercised its right to make or maintain an exception under Article [V(2)(d), and (b) in any event,
Canada did not reserve the right to maintain exceptions with respect to investments made in the

telecommunications sector.

(dd) Relevant Provisions of the BIT

339. Article IV(ID)(d) of the BIT specifies that the Contracting Parties’ national treatment

obligations “do not apply to: [...] the right of each Contracting Party to make or maintain

exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.“

340. The Annex states:

1. In accordance with Article IV, subparagraph 2(d), Canada reserves the right to make and
maintain exceptions in the sectors or matters listed below:

46 CL-001, BIT (English version), Article V(I)(d).

- social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security or
insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public training;
health and child care);

- services in any other sector;

- government securities - as described in SIC 8152;

- residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land;

- measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas Accords.

2. For the purpose of this Annex, “SIC” means, with respect to Canada, Standard Industrial
Classification numbers as set out in Statistics Canada, Standard Industrial Classification,
fourth edition, 1980.47°

(2) Canada’s Position

341. Canada submits that the BIT imposes no national treatment obligations on Canada within
the sectors listed in its Annex, because Canada has reserved the right to act inconsistently with
those obligations under Article V(1)(d).47! Canada has listed all service sectors in its Annex, which
includes the telecommunication sector.47? Therefore, GTH’s national treatment claim, which
relates exclusively to the telecommunications sector, is excluded from the scope of the BIT’s

national treatment provisions.*”?

a. Whether Canada has Made an Exception Under Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT

342. According to Canada, it may make or maintain an exception pursuant to Article [V(2)(d)
at any time by adopting or maintaining measures or by according treatment that would otherwise

be inconsistent with the national treatment obligations; it is not required to take any additional

steps to exercise this right.*”*

343. Canada argues that its interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) is based on the ordinary meaning

of the text, which is “that Canada has maintained policy flexibility to not accord national treatment

to investors of Egypt and their investments within the matters or sectors listed in the Annex.”47°

Canada considers that the dictionary definitions of the terms “make,” “maintain” and “exception”
support its interpretation.*”° Further, according to Canada, the text simply does not specify any
procedural requirements that must be fulfilled to trigger the exception. In particular, Canada points
out that the BIT does not contain a notification requirement, unlike some other investment
treaties.4”’ Thus, there is no basis for GTH’s assertion that Canada must notify Egypt and its

investors before exercising its right to make an exception.*”®

344. Canada contends that its interpretation is reinforced by the context of Article 1V(2)(d), and
in particular by Egypt’s list of excepted sectors or matters, which uses language that is not
compatible with GTH’s argument that a State must enact a reservation before it becomes
effective.*”? Canada also refers to the object and purpose of Article IV(2)(d), which in its view, is
“to ensure that Canada’s national treatment obligations in its FIPAs do not unduly limit Canada’s
policy space.”**° Canada notes that when then BIT was negotiated in the 1990s, “it was common

for BITs to include only very weak or no national treatment obligations.”**!

345. Turning to past arbitral decisions, Canada cites Lauder v. Czech Republic and Lemire v.

The Lauder tribunal found that the reservation allowed the State to “treat foreign investment less
favorably than domestic investment ... in the sectors or matters for which it has reserved the right
to make or maintain an exception in the Annex to the Treaty.”4*? The Lemire tribunal characterized
the national treatment obligation in the relevant treaty as “a general principle, subject to an
exception (for investment in listed sectors and matters).”**4 According to Canada, the tribunals in
these cases ultimately decided that the exceptions did not apply, but for reasons not present in this

case. “85

future.”*°° Canada considers that Article XVI of the BIT, which GTH cites to support its
interpretation, reinforces Canada’s position. It requires the Contracting Parties, within two years
after the entry into force of the BIT, to notify one another of any existing non-conforming

measures; it does not apply to future measures, which by their very nature cannot be identified.*”!

347. Canada further contends that the BIT does not distinguish between the reservation of a
right and the exercise of a right, as GTH suggests.*”” In this regard, Canada refers to “denial of
benefits” clauses, which are found in certain investment treaties and often use the language of a

reservation of rights. According to Canada, tribunals have found that such language allows the

State to deny the treaty rights at the time they are being claimed.“

b. Whether the Annex Includes Telecommunications

348. Regarding the scope of the exception, Canada’s position is that the Annex of the BIT

excludes all services, including telecommunications.*** Canada highlights that the first exclusion

listed in the Annex is “social services,” which is followed by “services in any other sector.”

Canada reads these together to mean that all service sectors, including social services, fall within
the scope of the exception.4° Thus, Canada sees no basis for GTH’s position that

telecommunications are not covered by the Annex.

349. In Canada’s view, its interpretation of the Annex is confirmed by Canada’s treaty practice.
It argues that nearly all its investment treaties from 1994 to the late 1990s contain provisions

identical or similar to Article IV(2)(d) the Annex of the BIT, which contains a broad exception for

all services from Canada’s national treatment obligations.*?’ Canada opposes GTH’s argument
that Canada specifically identified telecommunications in other treaties when it sought to exclude
that sector.4°8 Canada points out that GTH cites treaties from 2013 and 2014, which reflect an
“evolution in the architecture of Canada’s FIPAs over the past three decades.”*? These treaties

and the BIT all exclude telecommunications, albeit in different ways.°0?

350. In addition, Canada considers GTH’s position that telecommunications is not a service
“plainly wrong and contradicted by the fact that the measures at issue clearly relate to the provision

of telecommunications services by Wind Mobile.”°°!

351. In this regard, Canada considers GTH’s reliance on the Standard Industrial Classification
misplaced because (a) it is referenced in the BIT only with respect to “government securities” and
not “any other services”; (b) it does not contain a single category for all services in which
telecommunications would fall; and (c) it refers to “telecommunications broadcasting and

transmission services” and therefore does not suggest that telecommunications are not services. °°

(3) GTH’s Position

352. GTH’s position is that Canada’s objection must be dismissed because Canada did not
exclude telecommunications from its national treatment obligations.*°? GTH argues that Canada
has not exercised its right to make an exception under Article IV(2) of the BIT and that, in any

event, the Annex does not cover telecommunications.>™*

a. Whether Canada has Made an Exception Under Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT

353. GTH acknowledges that Canada has a right under Article TV(2)(d) to make and maintain
exceptions to national treatment protection.*°> However, GTH contends that this is “simply a right
reserved to make an exclusion in the future,” and the exercise of this right requires more than the

mere adoption of a measure.>°°

354. For GTH, this is clear from the ordinary meaning of Article TV(2) and the Annex.*°’ GTH
points out a distinction between Article [V(a)-(c) and Article IV(d): while the former refer to
“measures” that the Contracting Parties can make or maintain without violating the national
treatment obligation, the latter only permits the Contracting Parties to “make or maintain
exceptions” within certain sectors specified in the Annex.°° Thus, the provision identifies certain
existing exceptions to national treatment and leaves it to the States whether to exercise their right

to make further exceptions in the future.°

355. Turning to the Annex, GTH highlights that Canada “reserve[d] the right to make and
maintain exceptions” in the listed sectors.°!° In GTH’s view, if Canada had wished to make the
exception rather than reserve the right to do so, it would have used different language. GTH points
to Article IV(2)(a)(ii) of the BIT, which expressly excludes certain future non-conforming

measures.*!!

356. GTH asserts that such a reservation of rights cannot be equated with the exercise of a right,

512

as recognized by numerous arbitral tribunals.”’~ According to GTH, Canada attempts to equate the

two concepts by relying almost exclusively on its 2004 Model BIT, which is irrelevant to the
present case.*!? In any event, unlike the BIT, the 2004 Model BIT clearly states that the national
treatment provisions “shall not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains with

respect to sectors, subsectors or activities, as set out in its schedule to Annex 11.”5'4 GTH finds this

difference in language from that of the BIT “telling.”>!>

357. Therefore, GTH argues that Canada must affirmatively exercise its right to make
exceptions to national treatment “by providing notice to investors that are subject to the BIT’s
protections,” and that such notice cannot have retroactive effect.*!° As support for this point, GTH

cites arbitral decisions addressing “denial of benefits” clauses.>!’ GTH considers that Article XVI

b. Canada’s interpretation would render the first item in the list (“social services”)

superfluous.*7°

c. In any event, the telecommunications sector is not a service sector; it also covers

infrastructure, construction and product sales.527

d. Canada’s own Standard Industrial Classification, which is referenced in the Annex to

the BIT, classifies telecommunications as a utility, not a service. °28

e. In other investment treaties, Canada has expressly exempted measures with respect to
“telecommunications services” but did not do so in the BIT. Indeed, in other treaties,
Canada exempted “telecommunications services” in addition to “the establishment or

acquisition in Canada of an investment in the services sectors.”*”?

361. Therefore, GTH submits that even if Canada were able to exercise its right to make an
exception merely by adopting a non-conforming measure (which GTH denies), this jurisdictional
objection must still be dismissed because telecommunications does not fall within Canada’s

purported exception.

362. Finally, GTH adds that Canada’s national security review would not fall within the
purported exception in any case because it is not a measure targeting “services”; rather, it targets

all foreign investments regardless of the sector.>*°

invokes this provision as an objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction, and GTH has responded on
that basis. In the Tribunal’s view, the issue might be better characterised as a question of
admissibility or even merits, given its relevance to substantive protection rather than to the dispute
resolution provisions of the BIT. However, this distinction carries no practical consequence in the
present circumstances. Regardless of how one chooses to characterise Canada’s objection, its
operation is the same: if the Tribunal upholds the objection, it will not consider GTH’s national
treatment claim any further. Therefore, the Tribunal will address Canada’s objection as pleaded

by the Parties.
364. The decisions in this section of the Award are taken by the Tribunal acting by a majority.

365. The Tribunal must determine whether, pursuant to Article [V(2)(d) and the Annex of the
BIT, measures taken in the telecommunications sector are excluded from the scope of Canada’s
national treatment obligations. To reach that determination, the Tribunal will address in turn two
main questions: (a) has Canada validly made an exception under Article IV(2)(d)? and (b) if so, is
telecommunications captured by that exception? With respect to each of these questions, the
Tribunal’s fundamental task is to interpret the relevant provisions of the BIT in accordance with

Article 31(1) of the VCLT.

366. Article IV of the BIT is structured as a statement of general principle in paragraph (1),
subject to a number of exceptions set forth in paragraph (2). Specifically, paragraph (2) states that
paragraph (1) and certain other provisions of the BIT “do not apply to” subparagraphs (a) to (d).
Subparagraph (a) refers to “existing non-conforming measures” and a very specific category of
measures adopted after the date of the entry into force of the BIT (relating to ownership and
participation in State entities). In turn, subparagraphs (b) and (c) refer to the continuation, renewal

and amendment of such measures.

367. Of primary interest to the Tribunal is Article [V(2)(d), which provides that the national
treatment obligation in paragraph (1) “does not apply to ... the right of each Contracting Party to
make or maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex.” >*! The text makes
clear that the right to make an exception in a sector or a matter is subject to only one condition:

°3! The Arabic version of the Annex (but not in the English and the French versions) also includes Egypt’s reservation
of right to make and maintain exceptions in specifically listed matters. This is not disputed between the Parties.

112

Public Version

the sector or matter must be listed in the Annex. In the Annex, Canada “reserves the right to make
and maintain exceptions” in five categories, including “social services” and “services in any other
sector.”**? This language, similar in all three authentic linguistic versions of the BIT, leaves no
room for doubt that Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation

533 such

with respect to “services.” Unattractive as the result may seem to the dissenting minority,
is the Parties’ agreement as recorded in the explicit terms of the BIT. The Tribunal is neither
expected nor empowered to rewrite the Treaty to make its substantive protections more efficient
for the interests of a party. The Tribunal is not expected either to adapt the application of the terms

of the Treaty to suit the variable size of the concerned sectors in the Canadian economy.***

368. A remaining question is whether Canada may exercise that right by simply adopting or
applying an inconsistent measure, or whether Canada must take an intermediary step to “activate”
that right. Canada’s position is that the “right to make exceptions is the right to take inconsistent
measures,” whereas GTH contends that Canada must affirmatively exercise its right to make
exceptions, such as “by providing notice to investors that are subject to the BIT’s protections.” >*°
369. The Tribunal finds that the correct, and most reasonable, interpretation of Article IV(2)(d)
and the Annex supports Canada’s position. In particular, there is simply no basis in the text of the
BIT to impose an additional procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the

exception.>*
370. In this regard, it is useful to consider Article XVI of the BIT, which provides:

1. The Contracting Parties shall, within a two year period after the entry into force of this
Agreement, exchange letters listing, to the extent possible, any existing measures that do
not conform to the obligations in subparagraph (3)(a) of Article II, Article IV or paragraphs
(1) and (2) of Article V.

532 The scope of this category is discussed below, beginning at '[ 375.

535 Day 2, Tr. 140:9-16; Jur. Rejoinder, { 46, 48. See the summary of the Parties’ positions in Section VI.D(2) and
(3) above.

936 As Canada highlights, many BITs include express notice requirements for exceptions such as those permitted by
Article IV(2)(d).

113

Public Version

2. Each Contracting Party shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that its laws, regulations,
procedures, and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered
by this Agreement are promptly published or otherwise made available in such a manner
as to enable interested persons and the other Contracting Party to become acquainted with
them.

371. Article XVI(1) sets out a process by which the Contracting Parties are to notify one another
of any existing non-conforming measures, but there is no such process prescribed for exercising
the right granted by Article IV(2)(d). The obvious indication is that if the Contracting Parties had
intended for that right to be subject to any notification requirement beyond listing the relevant
sector or matter in the Annex, they would have included it in the text of the BIT.>*’ Even if there
were any want of diligence on the part of Canada in publicising this fact under Article XVI(2)
(Transparency) of the BIT, that could amount to a breach of Article XVI(2) but would not, of itself,

imply any violation of any other Article of the BIT.

372. With regard to the Annex, the reference to “services in any other sector” must be read in
the context of the four other listed items. These refer to matters as specific as “government
securities — as described in SIC 8152” and “residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront
land” and “measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas
Accords.” The specificity of these categories also suggests that no further action by Canada is
required or contemplated prior to its entitlement to rely upon these asserted “exceptions.” Although
“services in any other sector” is broader than the other items listed, there is no indication in the

text that it should be treated differently.

373. The Tribunal can but note that the text of the Annex could have been drafted in clearer
terms. For instance, Canada could have stated that its national treatment obligation does not apply
to non-conforming measures in the listed sectors or matters. At the same time, the Tribunal
understands that the terms used (“reserves the right to make exceptions”) reflect the fact that

Article IV(2)(d) is largely forward looking. While Article IV(2)(a) to (c) are primarily concerned

°37 Tt is worth noting that GTH does not allege any violation of Article XVI. From the record, it is clear that the text
of ICA was available to investors at all times and that, as a matter of fact, GTH knew of the national security review
provisions that were adopted in 2009.

114

Public Version

with existing measures (and thus refer clearly to excluded “non-conforming measures”), the main

purpose of Article IV(2)(d) is to exclude measures that might be adopted in the future.

374. In any event, the Tribunal must interpret the text of the BIT as it is, not as it should have
been drafted in an ideal situation. As already mentioned, the text leaves no doubt that Canada has
the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation in “services,” and the Tribunal
declines to subject that right to a notice requirement or other procedural hurdle which is not
included in the BIT. Thus, the Tribunal concludes that under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex,
Canada may adopt or apply measures with respect to “services” that are not in conformity with its

national treatment obligation.

375. It is important to emphasize that this exception is limited to the national treatment
provisions of the BIT. Canada remains obligated to provide Egyptian investors fair and equitable
treatment when adopting or applying any measures in relation to “services” under Article II(2)(a)
of the BIT, and Canada must be reasonably transparent in the adoption of laws, regulations and

procedures that might affect “services” under Article XVI(2).

376. The Tribunal now turns to the question of whether “services in any other sector” includes
telecommunications, which is the sector at issue in the present case. The Tribunal has no difficulty

finding that it does.

377. As noted above, the first item listed in the Annex is “social services,” followed by “services
in any other sector.” The only plausible interpretation is that all services, including social services,
fall within the scope of the Annex.>** The Tribunal cannot accept GTH’s argument that “services
in any other sector” should be read more narrowly to give meaning to the reference to “social
services” in the preceding item. That Canada chose to divide services into two categories, and
provide further elaboration in respect of the first category, does not alter the clear language of the

Annex.

378. While the breadth of the category “services in any other sector” might seem surprising, the

language is consistent with many of Canada’s investment treaties from the mid- to late- 1990s,

538 Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, | 132.

which contain similar exceptions for services.>*? In any event, it is not for the Tribunal to judge

the extent to which a State chooses to guarantee investors national treatment (or not).

379. The Tribunal is also unpersuaded by GTH’s assertion that telecommunications is not a
service sector. That assertion fails to reflect reality and runs contrary to GTH’s own description of
Wind Mobile’s activities, which were aimed at providing mobile telecommunications services to

Canadian customers.*?

380. In light of the findings above, the Tribunal concludes that GTH’s national treatment claim,
which relates exclusively to the telecommunications sector, is excluded from the scope of the
BIT’s national treatment provisions. Accordingly, the national treatment claim is dismissed and

will not be considered on the merits.

E. WHETHER THE CLAIMS ARE TIME-BARRED UNDER ARTICLE XIII(3)(D) OF THE BIT

381. Canada’s submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis over certain of
GTH’s claims because they are time-barred pursuant to the limitations period contained in Article

XIII(3)(d) of the BIT.

382. GTH argues that its claims relating to Canada’s cumulative, or composite, breaches of the
BIT are not impacted by the notification period in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, and the Tribunal

should therefore dismiss Canada’s objection.

(dd) Relevant Provision of the BIT

383. Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT provides:

An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in accordance
with paragraph (4) only if: [...] not more than three years have elapsed from the date on

53° RL-026, Canada-Ukraine FIPA, Article IV(2)(d), Annex; RL-027, Canada-Trinidad and Tobago FIPA, Article

1V(3), Annex I; RL-028, Canada-Armenia FIPA, Article IV(2)(d), Annex.

4 Tn this regard, the Tribunal agrees with Canada that GTH’s reliance on the Standard Industrial Classification is
misplaced because it is referenced in the BIT only with respect to “government securities” and not “any other
services.”

which the investor first acquired, or should have first acquired, knowledge of the alleged
breach and knowledge that the investor has incurred loss or damage.™*!

(2) Canada’s Position

384. Canada submits that the Tribunal lacks jurisdiction ratione temporis over GTH’s claims
challenging (a) the CRTC’s O&C review of Wind Mobile and (b) Canada’s alleged failure to
maintain a regulatory framework for roaming and tower site/sharing favourable to New
Entrants.°42 In Canada’s view, these claims fall outside the strict limitations period in
Article XIII(3)(b) of the BIT, and GTH cannot evade that limitations period by alleging that the

measures are part of a composite breach.*4?

385. According to Canada, Article XIII(3)(d) places a strict limitation on when an investor may
submit a dispute to arbitration: an investor may not submit a claim if more than three years have
elapsed since it first acquired knowledge, or should have first acquired knowledge, of the alleged
breach and alleged loss arising out of that breach.** If this condition is not met, Canada has not
consented to arbitrate the dispute, and the Tribunal therefore lacks jurisdiction.**> Several tribunals
considering the limitations period in Articles 1116(2) and 1117(2) of NAFTA (which contain the
same language as Article XIII(3)(d)) have confirmed that the limitations period is a fundamental
basis of a State’s consent to arbitrate, and an investor’s failure to comply deprives the tribunal of

jurisdiction.**°

386. Canada contends that GTH cannot evade the limitations period by alleging that the

measures form part of a cumulative or composite breach.*4” In Canada’s view, GTH has repeatedly

changed its characterization of the measures relating to the CRTC review and the roaming and
tower/site sharing framework throughout this proceeding in an attempt to circumvent

Article XIII(3)(d).*48 However, Canada sees no merit in any of GTH’s theories.

387. Canada asserts that Article XIII(3)(d) is a “clear and rigid limitation defense ... not subject
to any suspension, prolongation or other qualification.”*“? In particular, as stated by the tribunal in
Grand River v. United States, a claimant cannot “base its claim on the most recent transgression,
[when] it had knowledge of earlier breaches and injuries.”*°° Canada contends that GTH must not
be permitted to toll the limitations period by tying untimely measures to more recent ones.*>! In

Canada’s view, that would strip Article XIII(3)(d) of any purpose.**?

388. In any event, Canada considers that GTH has failed to prove a cumulative or composite
breach.*? Canada states that establishing a composite breach “requires demonstrating that the

measures were all unified by a common purpose or intent.”*** This is a fact-specific inquiry.°>> In

“48 Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, {ff 142-143. Canada points out that in the Request for Arbitration (9 97(a), 97(b)

this regard, Canada cites Rusoro v. Venezuela, in which the tribunal examined whether a series of
measures shared a sufficient “connection” to consider them “a unity” for purposes of the relevant

limitations period and found no such linkage.>°°

389. In addition, Canada argues that a composite act as defined in Article 15 of the International
Law Commission’s Articles on Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (the
“ILC Articles”) “refers to obligations which can only be breached through a series of measures
rather than through an individual act,” such as those relating to genocide and crimes against

humanity.>°’

390. Canada recalls that the composite act as alleged by GTH includes (a) the CRTC review,
(b) the roaming and tower/site sharing regulatory framework, (c) the treatment of GTH’s Voting
Control Application, and (d) the Transfer Framework. In Canada’s view, these are separate,
distinct measures, and GTH has failed to show any link among them other than the alleged impact
on Wind Mobile.*>* For example, the CRTC is “‘an arm’s-length regulator” separate from the arms
of the Government involved with the other measures, and it carried out its review pursuant to the
Telecommunications Act, a distinct legal basis.*°’ Similarly, the roaming and tower/site sharing
regulatory framework shares no link with the other measures and applied to all New Entrants, not
only Wind Mobile.*® The ICA review was conducted on the distinct basis of national security

concerns by an arm of Industry Canada that is not involved with telecommunications policy.*°!

391. Thus, Canada asserts that these four measures must be considered separately, and the result

is that the claims relating to the CRTC review and the regulatory framework for New Entrants are

untimely.>° According to Canada, GTH does not contest that these measures, if considered on

their own, fall outside the limitations period.*

392. Moreover, in Canada’s view, the evidence clearly shows that GTH had knowledge of these
alleged breaches and the damages arising out of them before the cut-off date of 28 May 2013.
In particular, Canada considers that GTH had the requisite knowledge in relation to the CRTC
review by late 2009, and in any event by April 2012, when leave to appeal the GiC Decision to the

Supreme Court of Canada was denied, closing the final opportunity for it to be reversed.*®

393. Regarding the regulatory framework for New Entrants, Canada points to GTH’s
submissions that Canada took action to enforce the regulatory framework only in March 2013,
with the release of the revised COLs on mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing.* Thus, on
GTH’s own case, it had the requisite knowledge relating to Canada’s alleged failure to enforce the

regulatory framework no later than March 2013.

394. Canada concludes that GTH’s claims relating to these two measures fall outside the
limitations period in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, and they must be dismissed for lack of

jurisdiction ratione temporis.

review and the regulatory framework for New Entrants as part of GTH’s claims of cumulative

breaches.*°

396. GTH acknowledges that the CRTC review and Canada’s alleged failure to ensure a level
playing field to New Entrants occurred more than three years prior to the date of filing of the
Request for Arbitration. As a result, GTH asserts that it is not claiming those as stand-alone or
separate breaches.*©? However, GTH submits that those breaches are part of a cumulative breach,

which was not known until June 2013.57

397. GTH points to the description of “composite act” found in Article 15 of the ILC Articles
and its Commentary.*”! Article 15 states that a composite breach is “a series of actions or omissions

defined in aggregate as wrongful,” which “occurs when the action or omission occurs which, taken

with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to constitute the wrongful act.572

398. Thus, GTH considers that a composite breach occurs on the date of the final act causing
the series of acts to amount to a breach, and a wronged party cannot have knowledge of the breach
until that date.>”° In this regard, GTH also cites Société Générale v. Dominican Republic, in which

the tribunal recognized that:

there might be situations in which each act considered in isolation will not result in a breach
of a treaty obligation, but if considered as a part of a series of acts leading in the same
direction they could result in a breach at the end of the process of aggregation.°”*

399. GTH rejects Canada’s characterization of a composite act under international law.>” First,
GTH does not agree that acts must be “unified by a common purpose or intent”>”° to form a
composite breach, and contends that Canada’s position is based on a misreading of its
authorities.°”” In GTH’s view, “the only linkage required is that the acts together must lead in the
direction of the breach.”*”* GTH argues that this is consistent with Canada’s own statement that a
composite breach may occur when a series of acts is “converging action towards the same result”
and with the decisions in the cases cited by Canada, namely Techmed v. Mexico, Paushok v.

Mongolia, and Société Générale v. Dominican Republic.”

400. Second, GTH denies that the concept of a composite breach applies only to obligations
breached by a series of measures rather than single acts. In GTH’s view, Canada’s position is not

supported by the text of the ILC Articles and runs counter to arbitral decisions recognizing that

FET obligations may be breached by a composite act.**”

401. According to GTH, the theory of composite breach addresses the present case exactly.
Canada subjected GTH to “a pattern of conduct that gradually eroded the framework upon which

GTH’s investment was premised.”**! Some of Canada’s acts do not amount on their own to a

breach of the BIT.**? In particular, GTH does not allege that the CRTC review and Canada’s failure
to enforce the roaming and tower/site sharing regulatory framework are discrete breaches.>*
However, with the benefit of hindsight, this pattern of conduct amounts to a composite breach,

“which crystallized by the time of Canada’s unlawful treatment of GTH’s efforts to take voting

control of its investment.”>*+

402. GTH highlights that under Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, the notification period does not
start to run until the investor has knowledge of the breach and the damage arising from that
breach.**> GTH finds the use of the word “breach” significant because “the BIT recognizes that
the date of a breach may be distinct from any one fact establishing the breach.”**° According to

GTH, Canada ignores the text and conflates the date of “breach” with the date of the underlying

factual events.**”

403. In the present case, GTH submits that it could not have known of Canada’s cumulative
breach of the FET standard or the resulting damage until June 2013 at the earliest.>** It was at that
time, with Canada’s treatment of GTH Voting Control Application, that the totality of

circumstances first amounted to a breach of FET.**°

404. Therefore, GTH submits, Article XIII(3)(d) does not apply, and the Tribunal has

jurisdiction over GTH’s claim.

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis

405. GTH does not argue that either (a) the CRTC ownership and control review or (b) the
alleged failure of the Government’s measures related to roaming and tower/site sharing amounts
to an independent breach of the BIT.°°° GTH also acknowledges that the “duplicative O&C
Reviews and Canada’s failure to maintain a favourable regulatory environment are acts that took
place prior to June 2013.”*°! However, GTH submits that, pursuant to the test set out in Article

XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, it could only have known after June 2013 that those acts formed part of a

cumulative breach.*” Specifically, GTH claims that it was only Po
Po in June 2013 that GTH “acquired knowledge of the alleged breach” in

the terms of Article XIII(3)(d).*” As stated by GTH’s counsel at the hearing:

The cumulative breach took place no earlier than June 2013, so GTH could not have known
of the breach, it could not have known of the loss before then.>4

406. After considering the opposing arguments by the Parties on the issue of the time bar, the
Tribunal decides that whether GTH’s allegation of a composite breach”? is sustained is a question
for the merits, not a question of jurisdiction. For jurisdictional purposes, the Tribunal only needs
to decide whether the two-pronged test set out in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT is satisfied: i.e., that
GTH had only acquired actual or constructive knowledge (a) of the alleged breach as pleaded in
its claim and (b) of the resulting loss or damage having occurred, within the three-year limitation
period prior to the submission of the Request for Arbitration on 28 May 2016.>*° If it were to be
established that one or more breaches became known, or should have become known, to the
investor more than three years before it submitted its dispute to arbitration, the claim in relation to

that specific breach will be time barred under Article XIII(3)(d), without prejudice to the other

unrelated breaches giving rise to admissible claims under the same provision or under other

provisions of the BIT.

407. However, the investor’s actual or constructive knowledge of the breach is only one part of
the test set in Article XIII(3)(d). Time limitation will only bar a claim if, in addition to the breach
having become known to the investor more than three years before it submitted its claim to
arbitration, the loss or damage resulting from that breach also became known to that investor more
than three years before it submitted its claim. All three equally authentic linguistic versions of the
BIT confirm the cumulative nature of the ‘time of knowledge’ test of the limitation period in

Article XII(3)(d).

408. The Tribunal notes that GTH does not argue that either the CRTC ownership and control
review or the alleged failure of the Government’s measures related to roaming and tower/site
sharing is “an independent breach of the BIT.”°*’ Whether the series of actions or omissions in
relation thereto are part of a wider, cumulative breach of the BIT, as alleged by GTH,»*” or distinct

and separate measures as alleged by Canada,” is a matter for the merits. The same applies to the

question of identifying the links in the chain,®”

if any, between those two time-barred actions of
Canada and the other alleged breaches, namely, the national security review and the Transfer

Framework.

409. Accordingly, the Tribunal need not decide whether it has jurisdiction on inexistent claims.
Determining whether a composite breach has occurred depends on the characterisation of the
specific facts underlying those claims and the rights and obligations set in the BIT. The Tribunal

addresses these questions below in the Merits section of the Award.

410. In understanding the time bar in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, the precedents arising under

a different treaty, NAFTA, adduced by Canada in support of its defense ratione temporis, are of

little assistance. This is because of the differences in the relevant terms of each treaty. While, as
submitted by Canada, the English version of Article 1116(2) of NAFTA is identical on its face
to Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT, the equally authentic French versions of each of those two treaties
differ. Indeed, the French version of NAFTA Article 1116(2)°? provides: “Un investisseur ne
pourra soumettre une plainte a l'arbitrage si plus de trois ans se sont écoulés depuis la date a
laquelle l'investisseur a eu ou aurait dit avoir connaissance du manquement allégué et de la perte
ou du dommage subi.” This may be translated in English as requiring that the investor “knowledge
of the alleged breach and of the incurred loss or damage.” In contrast, the French version of the
BIT requires of the investor to “avoir connaissance de la violation prétendue et du préjudice ou
du dommage qu’elle lui a causés.”°? This may be translated in English as requiring that the

investor has “knowledge of the alleged breach and of the loss or damage caused by that breach.”

411. The Tribunal considers that, under Article XTII(3)(d) of the BIT, for the investor to acquire
knowledge, whether actually or constructively, that it has incurred loss or damage caused by the
alleged breach, all the actions or omissions necessary to constitute the alleged breach must have
occurred. This is particularly true in the case of a composite act, as alleged by GTH on the basis
of Article 15 of the ILC Articles. It is only when the last of the actions or omissions necessary
to constitute the wrongful act occurs (which, as the ILC noted, is not necessarily the last act in the
),006

series

required in Article XIII(3)(d) of the BIT.

412. The Tribunal therefore dismisses Canada’s time bar objection to jurisdiction based on

Article XIII(3)(d) as unfounded, given that GTH is not asserting any claim for separate breaches

64 The Parties have not pointed in their submissions to this difference between the terms of NAFTA and those of the
BIT. However, the Tribunal is only relying on the BIT, the three authentic versions of which have been pleaded, not
on NAFTA which is not relevant to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction.

695 See J 406 above.

6° The Commentary to ILC Article 15 states that the Article “defines the time at which a composite act ‘occurs’ as
the time at which the last action or omission occurs which, taken with the other actions or omissions, is sufficient to
constitute the wrongful act, without it necessarily having to be the last of the series.” RL-233, International Law
Commission, ILC Articles with commentaries (2001), {7.

in relation to the alleged facts pertaining to the CRTC review and to the roaming and tower/site
sharing measures. The Tribunal does so without prejudice to the possibility that, as a matter of the
merits of the case, particular elements of the claim as presented by GTH are liable to be dismissed
because they are not shown to be elements of a composite act that comes to completion only within

the three-year period.

F. WHETHER THE CLAIMANT HAS STANDING TO BRING CLAIMS RELATING TO THE
TREATMENT OF WIND MOBILE

413. Canada objects to the admissibility of GTH’s claims which, in Canada’s view, relate to the

treatment of Wind Mobile. Specifically, Canada submits that GTH lacks standing to bring its

claims concerning measures that allegedly affected (a) Wind Mobile’s competitiveness as a New

Entrant in the Canadian telecommunications market, and (b) the transferability of Wind Mobile’s

licenses.

414. GTH’s position is that it has standing under Article XIII(3) of the BIT to bring claims
relating to both direct and indirect loss or damages it suffered as a result of Canada’s alleged
breaches of the BIT. In GTH’s view, Canada’s objection must be dismissed because it is based on

an irrelevant provision of the BIT and a non-existent principle of international law.

(dd) Relevant Provision of the BIT

415. Article XIII of the BIT concerns the “Settlement of Disputes between an Investor and the

Host Contracting Party.” It provides in relevant part:

1. Any dispute between one Contracting Party and an investor of the other Contracting
Party, relating to a claim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the former
Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement[] and that the investor has incurred loss
or damage by reason of, or arising out of, that breach, shall, to the extent possible, be settled
amicably between them.

L..]

3. An investor may submit a dispute as referred to in paragraph (1) to arbitration in
accordance with paragraph (4) only if:

(a) the investor has consented in writing thereto;

(b) the investor has waived its right to initiate or continue any other proceedings in relation
to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement before the courts or tribunals
of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement procedure of any kind;

127

416.

Public Version

L..]
4. The dispute may, at the election of the investor concerned, be submitted to arbitration
under:

(a) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID)

L..]
5. Each Contracting Party hereby gives its unconditional consent to the submission of a
dispute to international arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this Article.

L..]
7. A tribunal established under this Article shall decide the issues in dispute in accordance
with this Agreement and applicable rules of international law.

L..]

12. (a) A claim that a Contracting Party is in breach of this Agreement, and that an
enterprise that is a juridical person incorporated or duly constituted in accordance with
applicable laws of that Contracting Party has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or
arising out of, that breach, may be brought by an investor of the other Contracting Party
acting on behalf of an enterprise which the investor owns or controls directly or indirectly.
In such a case

(i) any award shall be made to the affected enterprise;
(ii) the consent to arbitration of both the investor and the enterprise shall be required;

(iii) both the investor and enterprise must waive any right to initiate or continue any other
proceedings in relation to the measure that is alleged to be in breach of this Agreement
before the courts or tribunals of the Contracting Party concerned or in a dispute settlement
procedure of any kind.”

(2) Canada’s Position

Canada argues that GTH and Wind Mobile cannot be equated with one another, following

the principle of international law that an enterprise and its shareholders have separate legal

personality.’ This principle was set forth by the ICJ in the Barcelona Traction case, and the Court

recognized that harm to a shareholder does not create a right for the shareholder to seek

compensation for measures taken against the enterprise.”

417. Canada distinguishes between direct and derivative/reflective shareholder claims.
According to Canada, a claim is derivative if the alleged harm to the shareholder resulted from the
treatment of the corporation.®!° In that case, the shareholder has no independent right of action

under international law.°!!

418. Canada asserts that the BIT contains two separate standing provisions to cover these two
types of claims: Articles XIII(3) for direct claims and XIII(12) for derivative claims.°!? In
Canada’s view, to “have standing under Article XIII(3) for a claim concerning an investment in
shares or loans, an investor must allege direct harm to its shareholder or creditor rights or
entitlements.”°!? On the other hand, Article XIII(12) provides a narrow exception to the general
principle of separate legal personality by allowing a shareholder to bring a claim on behalf of an
enterprise incorporated in the host State. When a shareholder brings a claim under Article XIII(12),
both the shareholder and the enterprise must consent to arbitration and waive any right to initiate
other proceedings relating to the challenged measure, and any damages are to be paid to the

enterprise.°!*

419. According to Canada, a claim for “indirect loss following the enterprise’s loss ... may only
be made under Article XIII(12),” and the conditions of that provision must be fulfilled.°!> The
investor cannot bypass these conditions by bringing a claim based on the treatment of an enterprise
under Article XIII(3), as GTH attempts to do in this case.°'® Canada asserts that such a tactic is

not permitted under the plain wording of Article XIII(3), which provides that an investor’s right

by both company and shareholder does not imply that both are entitled to claim compensation. ... Thus whenever a
shareholder's interests are harmed by an act done to the company, it is to the latter that he must look to institute
appropriate action; for although two separate entities may have suffered from the same wrong, it is only one entity
whose rights have been infringed”).

to claim on its own behalf is limited to “a claim... that the investor has incurred loss or damage.”°!7

That tactic would also render Article XIII(12) useless or redundant.°!®

420. Canada denies that the difference between Articles XIII(3) and XIII(12) is limited to the
treatment of damages and should be addressed with the merits, as GTH asserts.°!? Canada
maintains that these are provisions that govern standing to bring a claim, and that the Contracting

Parties did not consent to arbitrate claims that fail to comply with them.*°

421. Canada argues that the distinction between Articles XIII(3) and XIII(12) must be respected
to avoid “serious negative consequences,” such as: (a) the possibility that multiple shareholders
would bring claims arising out of the same treatment to a corporation, compromising judicial
economy and potentially resulting in inconsistent decisions; (b) overriding creditors’ rights; (c) the
possibility of double recovery where both a shareholder and corporation seek damages in relation

to the same measures; and (e) overriding managements’ control of business decisions.°!

422. Canada does not consider EnCana v. Ecuador, cited by GTH, to offer useful guidance on
the application of Articles XIII(3) and XIII(12), as Ecuador had raised a different standing
objection under a different treaty.°7? At the same time, Canada cites certain cases under NAFTA,
which according to Canada, contains standing provisions (Articles 1116 and 1117) that are similar
to those in the BIT.’ For example, in GAMI v. Mexico, although the tribunal accepted jurisdiction,

it rejected the claimant’s argument that Mexico’s treatment of the claimant’s subsidiary rendered

the claimant’s shares worthless. The tribunal reasoned that an investor must show that a breach of

the treaty “leads with sufficient directness to loss or damage in respect of a given investment.”°4

423. Canada also cites BG v. Argentina, in which BG alleged that Argentina’s measures
negatively impacted BG’s domestic subsidiary and brought claims relating to that subsidiary’s
licence, to which BG was not a party. The tribunal found that “BG does not have standing to

seize this Tribunal with ‘claims to money’ and ‘claims to performance,’ or to assert other rights,

which it is not entitled to exercise directly.”°°

424. According to Canada, “certain tribunals have wrongly overridden the corporate form to
permit shareholder reflective loss claims on the basis that BITs are /ex specialis.”°”’ Canada sees

nothing in the text of Article XIII(3) of the BIT that would allow such a departure from the

customary international law principle of separate corporate personality.°*

425. Canada does not accept that the definition of “investment” in Article I(f) of the BIT

specifies standing rights and allows an investor to bring a derivative claim under Article XIII.°?

Canada acknowledges that shares in an enterprise may be an investment, but argues that to have
standing under Article XIII, an investor must claim that breach relates to the rights or entitlements
associated with those shares.©° For Canada, this is clear from the fact that Article XIII does not
state that an investor may bring claims for a loss to its investment.®! While GTH cites cases in
which tribunals have inferred from the definition of “investment” that shareholders have standing

to claim damages arising from loss incurred by an enterprise, Canada argues that these cases

provide no useful guidance to the Tribunal because they are based on the interpretation of treaties

without the same provisions on standing as those in the BIT.°

426. Canada further argues that GTH’s use of the term “bundle of rights” cannot expand its
rights in relation to its shares in Wind Mobile. In any event, this term has most often been used

to refer to property or contractual rights, which Canada considers broader than rights attached to

shares or debt.°™*

427. On the basis of the above, Canada contends that GTH cannot bring a claim for alleged
breaches and damages suffered by Wind Mobile.®> Canada notes that, at the relevant time, GTH
held debt and an indirect non-controlling minority interest in Wind Mobile.©° However, GTH’s
allegations regarding the regulatory framework for New Entrants and the transferability of Wind
Mobile’s spectrum licences do not concern any impairment of the rights associated with GTH’s
shareholding or loans. Rather, GTH alleges that Canada’s failure to ensure a favourable regulatory
framework hurt Wind Mobile and its operations (not its shareholders).°*’ Similarly, GTH alleges
that the Transfer Framework impaired spectrum licenses which are held by Wind Mobile (not by

GTH).°** In particular, Canada argues that neither the Transfer Framework nor any other measure

ever prevented GTH from selling its shares in Wind Mobile.®? For Canada, it follows that these

measures “did not interfere with GTH’s investment.”™”°

428. Thus, Canada concludes that GTH’s derivative claims could only have been brought under
Article XIII(12) of the BIT. Because GTH failed to do so, it lacks standing to assert claims relating

429. GTH submits that pursuant to Article XIII, it has standing to bring all its claims.
According to GTH, “Canada’s measures affected both Wind Mobile and GTH’s investment, and
GTH claims only for the loss it has suffered as a result of the impact to its investment.”°? GTH

asserts that this is permitted by the ordinary meaning of the BIT.%*

430. GTH first considers the definition of “investment” contained in Article I(f) of the BIT,
which covers “any kind of asset,” including “shares stock, bonds and debentures or any other form
of participation in a company,” “money” and “rights.”4> GTH states that its “investment includes,
among other things, its indirect shareholding in Wind Mobile, its loans, and all of the associated

rights that relate to its equity and debt investments.”°*°

431. According to GTH, it is a well-recognized principle of international investment law that

this “bundle of rights and legitimate expectations” that comes with owning shares of a company

like Wind Mobile are protected under the BIT.’ Therefore, a State can breach its obligations

63° Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, 185.

64 Merits Rejoinder and Jur. Reply, { 184. Canada states that GTH’s “damages calculations highlight the fact that its
alleged loss from these measures is only reflective of Wind Mobile’s loss ... The implications for GTH’s debt and
equity investment are derived from the effect on Wind Mobile’s value.” /d., { 188.

under an investment treaty by damaging the rights and legitimate expectations of an enterprise in

which the investor has shares, even if the State has not interfered directly with the shares.°48

432. GTHasserts that it is permitted to submit a claim for any breach of the BIT if it has incurred
damage. GTH points to Article XIII(1), (3), and (4) of the BIT, by which GTH, as a qualifying
investor under Article I(g) of the BIT, may submit a dispute to arbitration if the dispute “relat[es]
to aclaim by the investor that a measure taken or not taken by the ... Contracting Party is in breach
of this Agreement[] and that the investor has incurred loss or damage by reason of, or arising out
of, that breach.”°° GTH has claimed (a) that several measures taken or not taken by Canada are
in breach of the BIT, and (b) that GTH incurred loss or damage due to those breaches. Thus, in
GTH’s view, it has properly submitted its claims under the relevant provisions of the BIT.°°!
Contrary to Canada’s position, nothing in Article XIII requires GTH to “claim that the breach

relates to the rights or entitlements associated with its shares.”°?

433. GTH recognizes that Article XIII(12) of the BIT permits an investor “acting on behalf of
an enterprise” to bring a claim for damage incurred by that enterprise. However, GTH argues
that it is not bringing a claim for damages incurred by Wind Mobile. Indeed, GTH states that it
“cannot invoke Article XIII(12) as it no longer owns Wind Mobile and would therefore not have

standing under that article.”°* Therefore, Article XIII(12) is irrelevant in this case.

434. In addition, GTH considers Canada’s interpretation of Article XIII to be inconsistent with

Article VII, which protects both “investments” and “returns” from unlawful expropriation and thus

foresees claims by shareholders who no longer control assets that have been expropriated.°>

According to GTH, its interpretation of Article XIII is supported by the only other decision

to address a nearly identical provision in another BIT.°° In EnCana v. Ecuador, EnCana brought

claims under the Canada-Ecuador BIT with respect to Barbadian subsidiaries involved oil and gas

exploration in Ecuador.®’ One of Ecuador’s jurisdictional objections was that EnCana was “not

claiming in relation to its own loss but rather in relation to loss suffered by” its subsidiaries.°* The

tribunal stated that:

436.

437.

The Tribunal does not interpret Article XIII(12) as limiting the clear words of Articles I
and XIII(1) which allow an investor to maintain a claim for loss suffered to itself arising
from a breach of the BIT. ... True, it does distinguish between loss or damage suffered by
a locally incorporated enterprise and loss or damage suffered directly or indirectly by the
investor itself. Circumstances can be envisaged where a breach of the BIT affecting a
locally incorporated subsidiary would have caused no loss or damage to the parent — e.g.,
where no consequence flowed from the breach either to the returns to the parent or to the
share value of the subsidiary. ... But an investor which alleges that it has suffered loss or
damage, directly or indirectly, through a breach of the BIT is entitled to bring proceedings
under Articles XTII(1) and (2). If it cannot prove compensable loss or damage, it will fail
on the merits; that does not affect the jurisdiction of a tribunal constituted in accordance
with Article XIII(4) to entertain its claim.°?

GTH asserts that this reasoning is directly applicable to the present case.°°

On the other hand, GTH contends that Canada relies on a purported general principle of

international law that is irrelevant to investment treaty arbitration: the separation of legal

personality between an enterprise and a shareholder.®°! According to GTH, Canada’s argument

of the consequences identified by Canada could arise in this case because GTH is not claiming in
respect of damage incurred by Wind Mobile. On the other hand, GTH sees significant practical

problems with Canada’s approach. In this regard, GTH states:

GTH sought to invest in the Canadian telecommunications market as an Egyptian investor,
it had no choice but to agree to a shareholding structure by which it would invest in the
Canadian enterprise through the ownership of shares. Now, Canada seeks to preclude GTH
from claiming damage to its investment due to Canada’s measures by referring to the very
shareholding structure Canada had required GTH to create.”

440. Finally, GTH addresses Canada’s factual assertion that GTH always had the ability to sell
its shares in Wind Mobile despite the Transfer Framework.*’! GTH argues that this assertion is

wrong as a matter of fact and is, in any event, a question for the merits.°””

441. In sum, GTH’s position is that Canada’s objection to GTH’s standing must be dismissed

because it has no basis in the BIT.

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis

442. The Tribunal notes that the definition of “investment” under Article I(f) is broad. It includes
any kind of asset owned or controlled directly or indirectly by an investor of one Contracting Party
in the territory of the other Contracting Party. Shares are specifically listed amongst the non-
exhaustive examples in that provision of the BIT, as are bonds and debentures and claims to
money.°” GTH’s indirect shareholding in Wind Mobile and the debt owed to it by Wind Mobile
are therefore qualifying investments that are protected by the BIT. Moreover, earlier in this Award,

the Tribunal ruled that GTH is a qualifying investor that benefits from the BIT’s protections.°*

673 CL-001, BIT (English version), Article I(f) (“‘investment’ means any kind of asset owned or controlled either
directly, or indirectly through an investor of a third State, by an investor of one Contracting Party in the territory of
the other Contracting Party in accordance with the latter’s laws and, in particular, though not exclusively, includes:
... (ii) shares, stock, bonds and debentures or any other form of participation in a company, business enterprise or
joint venture; (iii) money, claims to money, and claims to performance under contract having a financial value”).

4 See above Section VIB.

Public Version

443. The Tribunal notes that GTH asserts that it is not bringing a claim under the BIT on behalf
of Wind Mobile or for damages incurred by Wind Mobile, but claims pursuant to Article XTII(1)
in respect of its own loss as an investor in Wind Mobile, i.e., as a shareholder and a creditor of
Wind Mobile. The Tribunal considers therefore that GTH need not comply with the terms of
Article XIII(12) of the BIT. As GTH’s counsel stated during the Hearing:

So that’s exactly what GTH did: they brought the claim under Article [XTII](1); they
waived their right to bring these claims under any other forum, even whether or not they
could have aside. So we think Article XIII(12) is just simply irrelevant here.°”>

444. The Tribunal notes approvingly the pragmatic approach that the EnCana v. Ecuador
tribunal has taken: an investor that qualifies for the protection of the treaty, and which alleges that
it has suffered loss or damage that is separate from that suffered by its locally-incorporated
subsidiary, is entitled to bring proceedings to recover those alleged separate damages under the
equivalent of Article XIII(1).°° Whether that investor prevails on the merits is a matter that does

not relate to the debate on the jurisdiction of the Tribunal.

445. The decisions in the large number of investment cases to which GTH refers, holding that
an investor has standing to claim damages because of the loss in the value of its shares or debt,
does not mean that Barcelona Traction was wrongly decided; nor is this Tribunal suggesting that
Barcelona Traction has become irrelevant in light of more recent investment arbitral jurisprudence
such as CMS v. Argentina.” Barcelona Traction was essentially about diplomatic protection.°”
This arbitration is predicated primarily on the terms of the BIT. Those terms broadly define

qualifying investments to include the indirect holding of shares and claims to money, and permit

taken by the host State in breach of the BIT.

446. Accordingly, the Tribunal decides that GTH has standing under Article XIII(1) of the BIT

to submit a dispute to arbitration in accordance with the conditions set out in Article XTII(3).

G. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON JURISDICTION

447. The Tribunal upholds Canada’s objection to the Tribunal’s jurisdiction over GTH’s claim
that Canada violated its national treatment obligations set forth in the BIT. The Tribunal denies

Canada’s remaining objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.

448. Consequently, the Tribunal dismisses GTH’s national treatment claim and finds that it has
jurisdiction over each of GTH’s remaining claims, the merits of which will be considered in the

following Section.

VII. MERITS

A. FAIR AND EQUITABLE TREATMENT

449. GTH submits that Canada has breached its obligation to provide fair and equitable
treatment (“FET”) under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by (a) blocking GTH from selling Wind
Mobile to an Incumbent;°” (b) subjecting GTH to an arbitrary national security review process
that lacked transparency and due process;°*° and (c) Canada’s cumulative conduct over the lifetime

of GTH’s investment.®*!

450. Canada argues that GTH has based these claims on an overly-broad reading of

Article II(2)(a) and denies that there has been any breach of its FET obligation.®*”

451. In the following Sections, after recalling the relevant provision of the BIT, the Tribunal
considers the applicable legal standard and each of GTH’s FET claims by first setting out the

Parties’ respective positions and then its own analysis.

(dd) Relevant Provision of the BIT

452. Canada’s FET obligation is set forth in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT as follows:

Each Contracting Party shall accord investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party

(a) fair and equitable treatment in accordance with principles of international law [...].°?

(2) Applicable Legal Standard
a. GTH’s Position

453. GTH asserts that FET is a flexible standard, which allows a tribunal to “fill in any potential
gaps not explicitly covered by other treaty protections in order to safeguard the object and purpose

of the BIT.”°4

2685

454. According to GTH, the ordinary meaning of the terms “fair” and “equitable must be

interpreted in the context of the BIT’s object and purpose to promote and protect foreign

investment between Canada and Egypt, as stated in the preamble:

RECOGNIZING that the promotion and the protection of investments of investors of
one Contracting Party in the territory of the other Contracting Party will be conducive to

between them.°°

455. In addition, GTH highlights the placement of Article II(2)(a) within a provision titled

“Establishment, Acquisition and Protection of Investments,” which also provides that the

Contracting Parties “shall encourage the creation of favourable conditions for investors.”°*7

456. Thus, considering the ordinary language of Article II(2)(a) in context, GTH argues that the
FET standard protects investors against conduct that (a) is unreasonable, arbitrary, discriminatory
or inconsistent;*** (b) lacks transparency;®*? (c) denies the investor due process; or (d) frustrates

an investor’s legitimate expectations.©! GTH elaborates on these protections as follows.

457. According to GTH, unreasonable or arbitrary treatment which violates a host State’s FET

obligation includes any of the following, even if adopted in good faith:

a. a measure that inflicts damage on the investor without serving any apparent legitimate
purpose;

b. a measure that is not based on legal standards but on discretion, prejudice or personal
preference;

c. a measure taken for reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision
maker;

d. a measure taken in willful disregard of due process and proper procedure.”

458. In addition, GTH asserts that a measure may be arbitrary if it is disproportionate to the
alleged objective.°* GTH does not accept Canada’s articulation of the standard for arbitrary and
discriminatory treatment, which relies on cases interpreting a separate treaty provision dealing
with arbitrary and discriminatory measures.©* However, as confirmed by the Tribunal in Lemire
v. Ukraine, a State action that does not amount to a breach of that separate provision may still

violate the FET standard.©°

express purpose of encouraging investment, a State should be held accountable for fundamental or

expectations is not a “freestanding obligation” is contradicted by the cases it cites, which all hold
that an investor’s legitimate expectations are a relevant consideration in identifying a breach of
FET. Further, contrary to Canada’s position, there is no requirement that an investor's
expectations be based on “specific and express representations.” Rather, legitimate expectations
may be created by implicit representations or the legal and business framework in place at the time

of the investment.”

standard of treatment” under customary international law, as asserted by Canada.”°! GTH agrees

with Professor Schreuer’s statement that “in the absence of a clear indication to the contrary, the

fair and equitable treatment standard contained in BITs is an autonomous concept.””°

461. According to GTH, Canada’s interpretation of Article II(2)(a) is unsupported by the text
and renders the words “fair” and “equitable” meaningless.” GTH specifically rejects Canada’s

reliance on the phrase “in accordance with principles of international law” as a reference to the

customary international law minimum standard of treatment. GTH highlights that the term
“customary” does not appear in Article II(2)(a). In its view, the proper interpretation of the
phrase, which gives meaning to all the terms of Article II(2)(a), is that “FET cannot be contrary to

the principles of international law and, to the extent there is any difference between the two,

principles of international law act as a floor but not as a ceiling.”7°

462. GTH contends that if the Contracting Parties had intended to provide treatment in
accordance to the minimum standard of treatment, they would have used that formulation.” Yet
the phrase “minimum standard of treatment,” is not found anywhere in the BIT.”°’ GTH points out
that Canada has included those words in other treaties. For example, NAFTA expressly refers to
the “Minimum Standard of Treatment,” as does Canada’s 2004 BIT.”° On the other hand,
Canada’s 1994 Model BIT, on which the BIT is based, uses the language of Article II(2)(a).’°

463. GTH further argues that tribunals have repeatedly rejected interpretations such as the one
advanced by Canada in this case. In particular, GTH cites Vivendi v. Argentina, Suez v. Argentina,
Crystallex v. Venezuela, Gold Reserve v. Venezuela, and Arif v. Moldova.” In each of these cases,
the FET clause in the applicable treaty provided for FET in accordance with principles of
international law, and in each case, the tribunal rejected the respondent’s argument that the clause

should be interpreted to guarantee only the minimum standard of treatment. The Vivendi tribunal

specifically stated that there was “no basis for equating principles of international law with the
minimum standard of treatment.””!! The Crystallex tribunal found that the FET clause in the
Canada-Venezuela BIT was an autonomous standard, having observed that “[u]nlike treaties such
as NAFTA, which expressly incorporate the minimum standard of treatment, the Canada-

Venezuela BIT nowhere refers to such minimum standard.”7!

464. GTH argues that Canada has found no support for its position in past arbitral decisions;
instead, Canada cites cases that stand for an entirely different proposition: that the minimum
standard of treatment has evolved over time and now affords the same level of treatment as an
autonomous FET clause.”? For example, the tribunal in Rusoro v. Venezuela stated that the
“discussion of whether Art. II.2 of the BIT incorporates or fails to incorporate the CIS Standard

when defining FET has become dogmatic: there is no substantive difference in the level of

protection afforded by both standards.”?'*

465. In any event, even if the minimum standard of treatment were relevant, GTH contends that
it provides far greater protection than Canada suggests.’'> Tribunals applying this standard have

found that it covers measures that are unreasonable, arbitrary, lacking in transparency, without due

important element of the minimum standard of treatment.”!7

standard of treatment with evidence of State practice, GTH contends that “the wealth of analysis
done by other tribunals to define the contemporary scope of the minimum standard of treatment is

more than sufficient to establish the parameters of that standard.”7!®

principle of the minimum standard of treatment.”!° In Canada’s view, this is clearly indicated by
the words “in accordance with principles of international law,” which distinguish Article II(2)(a)

from an autonomous FET standard.

468. According to Canada, it follows a consistent treaty practice of tying the FET clause to the

minimum standard.’° The language in Article II(2)(a) is found in Canada’s other treaties,’?!

Venezuela and OI Group v. Venezuela.”’ For example, the Koch Minerals tribunal specifically
found that a treaty provision similar to Article II(2)(a) of the BIT “necessarily incorporates a
reference to the level of protection that International Law provides to foreigners, that is, to what is

known as the customary minimum standard.”7°8

471. In this regard, Canada rejects GTH’s reliance on the omission of the word “customary” in
Article II(2)(a); Canada notes that this word is also absent from other treaties, including NAFTA,

which incorporate the minimum standard of treatment.’

472. For Canada, because Article II(2)(a) is a customary international law standard, it follows
that the burden is on GTH to provide evidence of State practice and opinio juris to support its
position regarding the elements of the fair and equitable standard in the BIT.7*° In Canada’s view,
GTH has failed to meet this burden. GTH relies solely on past arbitral decisions, which are not

evidence of State practice.”*!

473. In any event, Canada contends that, even if the Tribunal were to find that Article II(2)(a)
provides protection beyond the minimum standard of treatment, it should reject GTH’s argument
that investors are entitled to broad protections in relation to unfair and arbitrary measures,

legitimate expectations, transparency and due process.”

474. According to Canada, GTH’s “allegations ignore the fact that international law generally
grants a high level of deference to States with respect to domestic policy choices and balancing of

public interest and individual rights.”’*> Whether the FET standard is autonomous or based in

customary international law, Canada’s position is that FET does not permit tribunals to second
guess a State’s policy choice or the justification of that choice.” This has been confirmed in

several arbitral decisions; for example, the tribunal in Crystallex v. Venezuela stated that:

governmental authorities should enjoy a high level of deference for reasons of their
expertise and competence (which is assumed to be present in those institutions called to
make the relevant decisions) and proximity with the situation under examination. It is not
for an investor-state tribunal to second-guess the substantive correctness of the reasons
which an administration were to put forward in its decisions, or to question the importance
assigned by the administration to certain policy objectives over others.’

475. Canada further contends that an overly-broad reading of Article II(2)(a) would be
inconsistent with the object and purpose of the BIT because, as stated by the tribunal in Saluka v.
Czech Republic, “an interpretation which exaggerates the protection to be accorded to foreign
investments may serve to dissuade host States from admitting foreign investments.””*°

476. As to the specific contents of the FET standard, Canada rejects each of the elements

advanced by GTH.

477. First, Canada argues that the FET standard does not protect against unreasonable or
arbitrary measures unless they are devoid of any legitimate purpose and contrary to the rule of
law.”*7 In the ELSI case, the ICJ stated that “[a]rbitrariness is not so much something opposed to
arule of a law, as something opposed to the rule of law... It is a wilful disregard of due process of

law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises a sense of judicial propriety.”’** Similarly, the

tribunal in Lemire v. Ukraine stated that “the underlying notion of arbitrariness is that prejudice,

preference or bias is substituted for the rule of law.””*

478. Second, Canada denies that the FET standard includes a freestanding obligation to protect
an investor’s legitimate expectations.” Canada accepts that legitimate expectations may be a

relevant factor in assessing whether a measure constitutes a breach of the FET standard, but to

.741

establish a breach, that measure would still have to be grossly unfair or unjus Moreover,

legitimate expectations can only be considered at all if the State has made specific and express

representations to an investor to induce the investment. 4?

479. Canada further contends that, in light of the State’s sovereign authority to legislate and to
adapt its legal system to changing circumstances, an investor cannot have a legitimate expectation
that the legal or business environment will remain the same, unless the State has provided an
explicit and specific representation to that effect.”* As stated by the tribunal in Mobil v. Canada,
FET “does not require a State to maintain a stable legal and business environment for

investments.””** Thus, in Canada’s view, an investor’s own expectations about the legal regime

applicable to its investment “are irrelevant and impose no obligations on the State.”74>

480. Third, Canada submits that the FET standard does not impose a general obligation of
transparency.”*° According to Canada, while a complete absence of transparency could be a

relevant factor in the FET analysis, there is no support for GTH’s position that a measure “lacking

in transparency” constitutes a breach of FET.”4” In addition, a lack of transparency, to the extent
relevant to the FET analysis, would be considered in light of all the surrounding circumstances.
Thus, in the context of national security concerns, it would be unreasonable to expect a government

to act with full transparency. "8

481. Finally, Canada rejects GTH’s assertion that the FET standard guarantees broad due
process protections for investors outside the context of judicial proceedings. According to Canada,

GTH has failed to define the scope of this protection and to provide any support for its position.”

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis

482. As can be noted from the summaries above, the Parties differ as to the content and scope
of the FET obligation expressed in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. In construing the scope of that
obligation as agreed between the Contracting Parties in the BIT, the Tribunal will have regard to
the general rule of interpretation in Article 31 of the VCLT. Contrary to other disputed terms in

Contracting Party “in accordance with principles of international law.”

483. Inreviewing the object and purpose of the BIT, the Tribunal notes that both the Preamble?”

Canadian investors in Egypt, and for Egyptian investors in Canada, and their recognition that the
protection of investments made by their respective nationals in the territory of the other
Contracting State will be conducive to the stimulation of business initiative and to the development
of economic cooperation between those States. The Tribunal considers those objectives to be

important in construing the terms of the BIT in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT.

484. Dealing first with Canada’s argument that the fair and equitable treatment standard set out
in the BIT is limited to the minimum standard of treatment under customary international law, the
Tribunal concludes that there is no basis for such an interpretation. Any such limitation runs
counter to the explicit terms used in Article II(2)(a) and to the ordinary meaning to be given to

those terms in their context and in the light of the BIT’s object and purpose.

485. Article II(2)(b) refers to fair and equitable treatment in conformity with principles of
international law; it does not refer to the minimum standard of treatment. The authentic French
and Arabic texts of the BIT are identical to the English text.” This Tribunal finds no support for
Canada’s endeavour to override the terms of the BIT and to draft into Article II(2)(b) a reference
to the minimum standard that would limit the potential application of a wider range of international

law principles than the minimum standard alone.
486. It is worth recalling the words of Dr. F.A. Mann, recalled by the Vivendi tribunal as follows:

As Dr. F.A. Mann, one of the twentieth century’s leading authorities on the interaction
between municipal law and public international law wrote in 1981:

“the terms ‘fair and equitable treatment’ envisage conduct which goes far
beyond the minimum standard and afford protection to a greater extent and
according to a much more objective standard than any previously employed
form of words. A Tribunal would not be concerned with a minimum,
maximum or average standard. It will have to decide whether in all
circumstances the conduct in issue is fair and equitable or unfair and
inequitable. No standard defined by any other words is likely to be material.
The terms are to be understood and implied independently and
autonomously”.

Dr. Mann’s conclusions have been echoed by others. Like Dr. Mann, an UNCTAD Report
on Fair and Equitable Treatment concluded that “where the fair and equitable standard is
invoked, the central issue remains simply whether the actions in question are in all the

752 To be precise, the authentic French and Arabic texts of the BIT refer in Article II(2)(a) to “the principles of
international law” [emphasis added], while the English text omits “the”. However, no submissions were made that the
omission is a relevant factor in construing the FET obligation in the BIT and the Tribunal does not consider that it is
critical to that effect.

circumstances fair and equitable or unfair and inequitable”. Stephen Vascianne reached the
same conclusion in his extensive study of the concept of fair and equitable treatment.’>

487. In other international treaties to which Canada is a party, explicit reference is made to the
“minimum standard of treatment.” This includes Article 1105 of NAFTA and Article 5 of
Canada’s 2004 Model BIT.” In particular, NAFTA, signed in 1992, predates the BIT. The
concept of the minimum standard was well known to Canada when negotiating and signing the
BIT. Yet, the BIT does not make reference thereto. Canada’s agreement with Egypt expressed in
the BIT is to be enforced, and this Tribunal shall therefore construe the FET obligation in

accordance with principles of international law.

488. In assessing whether the FET obligation has been breached, a tribunal must determine
whether, in all of the circumstances of the particular case, the conduct properly attributable to the
State has met the treaty requirement that it be “fair and equitable.””° The stricter standard of
“grossly unfair or unjust” conduct averred by Canada is not supported by the text of the BIT.’
Further, as recognised by the CMS v. Argentina tribunal, FET is an objective standard which is
“unrelated to whether the Respondent has had any deliberate intention or bad faith in adopting the

measures in question. Of course, such intention and bad faith can aggravate the situation, but are

not an essential element of the standard.”7°*

The Tribunal notes the Tecmed v. Mexico tribunal’s holding in construing Article 4(1) of

the Mexico-Spain BIT (1996), which is similar in its terms to Article II(2)(b) of the BIT:

490.

The Arbitral Tribunal considers that this provision of the Agreement, in light of the good
faith principle established by international law, requires the Contracting Parties to provide
to international investments treatment that does not affect the basic expectations that were
taken into account by the foreign investor to make the investment. The foreign investor
expects the host State to act in a consistent manner, free from ambiguity and totally
transparently in its relations with the foreign investor, so that it may know beforehand any
and all rules and regulations that will govern its investments, as well as the goals of the
relevant policies and administrative practices or directives, to be able to plan its investment
and comply with such regulations. Any and all State actions conforming to such criteria
should relate not only to the guidelines, directives or requirements issued, or the resolutions
approved thereunder, but also to the goals underlying such regulations. The foreign investor
also expects the host State to act consistently, ie. without arbitrarily revoking any
preexisting decisions or permits issued by the State that were relied upon by the investor
to assume its commitments as well as to plan and launch its commercial and business
activities. The investor also expects the State to use the legal instruments that govern the
actions of the investor or the investment in conformity with the function usually assigned
to such instruments, and not to deprive the investor of its investment without the required
compensation. In fact, failure by the host State to comply with such pattern of conduct with
respect to the foreign investor or its investments affects the investor’s ability to measure
the treatment and protection awarded by the host State and to determine whether the actions
of the host State conform to the fair and equitable treatment principle. Therefore,
compliance by the host State with such pattern of conduct is closely related to the above-
mentioned principle, to the actual chances of enforcing such principle, and to excluding the
possibility that state action be characterized as arbitrary; i.e. as presenting insufficiencies
that would be recognized “...by any reasonable and impartial man,” or, although not in
violation of specific regulations, as being contrary to the law because: ...(it) shocks, or at
least surprises, a sense of juridical propriety.”?

In answer to Canada’s concerns about potential limits on the State’s ability to regulate, this

Tribunal does not consider that the FET obligation, as interpreted in accordance with the terms of

the BIT, improperly or unreasonably restricts the State from legislating and adapting its legal

system to changing circumstances. In doing so, however, the State may not ignore the interests of

an investor that relied on the State’s earlier course of action.”

491. The above being determined, the Tribunal need not determine in the abstract theoretical
issues such as the breadth of protection that an investor is entitled to claim in relation to unfair and
arbitrary measures, legitimate expectations, transparency and due process. The Tribunal will
consider whether there has been a breach of the FET obligation in relation to each specific claim
advanced by GTH in Sections (3) to (5) below based on the relevant facts and the evidence adduced

in the case.

(3) Whether the Transfer Framework Breached the Respondent’s Fair and
Equitable Treatment Obligation

a. GTH’s Position

492. GTH claims that Canada violated Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by denying GTH the ability to
transfer the set-aside spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after the five-year transfer restriction had
expired.’”*' According to GTH, Canada’s action constitutes two distinct breaches of the FET
standard: (a) Canada frustrated GTH’s legitimate expectations; and (b) Canada subjected GTH to

unreasonable and arbitrary treatment.’

(i) GTH’s Expectations
493. GTH asserts that a fundamental component of the 2008 AWS Auction Framework was a
finite five-year restriction on the transfer of set-aside spectrum licenses, after which New Entrants
would be permitted to sell their licenses to an Incumbent.’ The purpose of this restriction was to
prevent New Entrants from engaging in arbitrage with their spectrum license and to encourage

licensees to put the spectrum to meaningful use.”°*

494. However, according to GTH, “Canada knew that it could not introduce an indefinite ban

on the sale of set-aside spectrum licenses to Incumbents because it knew that investors would not

of spectrum licenses by speculators and those whose intent is to preclude access to the spectrum by their
competitors.”) (GTH’s emphasis); Merits Reply and Jur. Counter-Memorial,  277(b).

purchase spectrum licenses with such a restriction.””® Thus, GTH alleges that Canada deliberately
introduced the finite five-year period to induce New Entrants to invest in the Canadian

telecommunications sector.”

495. GTH argues that Industry Canada and all the New Entrants understood and expected that
after expiration of the five-year restriction, the New Entrants would be permitted to transfer their
spectrum licenses to Incumbents.’°” Mr. Michael Connolly testifies that Industry Canada intended
to allow market forces to return after five years and had accepted the possibility that there might
be no New Entrants left in the market after that period.”

496. According to GTH, its expectation that Canada would uphold this condition was supported

by the following facts:

a. In the Licensing Procedure for Spectrum Licences for Terrestrial Services (the
“Spectrum Licensing Procedure”), Industry Canada confirmed that relevant

spectrum licenses enjoyed the “privilege” of “enhanced transferability and divisibility

rights.”7

b. Canada had recognized “the importance of relying on market forces in spectrum
management” and confirmed that regulatory measures, if and when adopted, would be

minimally intrusive.””°

c. Industry Canada’s past practice was to allow the sale of a New Entrant to an Incumbent

after a transfer restriction period had expired.’”!

d. Canada had assured investors that the “spectrum licenses may be transferred in whole
or in part (either in geographic area or in bandwidth) to a third party subject to the

conditions stated on the licence and other applicable regulatory requirements.”7”

e. The five-year transfer restriction was memorialized in Wind Mobile’s set-aside

spectrum licenses in unambiguous terms:

Licenses acquired through the set-aside of spectrum . . . may not be transferred or leased
to, acquired by means of a change in ownership or control of the licensee, divided among,
or exchanged with companies that do not meet the criteria of a new entrant, for a period
of 5 years from the date of issuance.”

497. GTH submits that it relied on the 2008 AWS Auction Framework in making its investment,
including Canada’s assurances that GTH would be permitted to transfer Wind Mobile’s spectrum
licenses to an Incumbent after the five-year restriction period.7”* This was, in GTH’s view, a
critical exit option. Mr. David Dobbie testifies that “GTH would not have been likely to invest in
Canada, and certainly not at the price we bid in the Auction, had we been informed at the outset
that we would not be allowed to sell our investment to an Incumbent.”’” Similarly, Mr. Andy Dry
testifies that it would be difficult to justify investing as a New Entrant without a clear, stable

liquidity right attached to the spectrum licenses.’°

498. GTH asserts that Canada itself recognized how important it was for investors to have “the
fullest possible knowledge of the spectrum at issue and the auction procedures and rules prior to
the auction.”””” The 2001 Spectrum Auction Framework stated that “[u]nderstanding exactly what
is being auctioned is very important for bidders to develop business plans, secure adequate

financing and develop a bidding strategy.”””* More specifically, according to Mr. Connolly’s

testimony, Industry Canada was “fully aware that an indefinite ban on any sale of set aside

spectrum would deter New Entrants from bidding in the AWS Auction.””””

499. GTH observes that the auction was a success for Canada, “generat[ing] almost $4.3 billion
in revenues for the Government of Canada.””®° In GTH’s view, this success was the direct result
of Canada’s representations to investors, including with respect to the five-year transfer

restriction. ”*!

500. However, GTH alleges that when the time approached for it to exercise this critical exit

option, Canada changed the rules and prevented GTH from selling Wind Mobile to an Incumbent,

782

thereby frustrating GTH’s legitimate expectations.'”” In this way, “Canada decided to penalize

GTH for its substantial investment and resulting success and hold it hostage.”’*? GTH’s position

is summarized as follows:

by enacting the 2013 Transfer Framework and denying GTH its right to sell Wind Mobile’s
licenses to an Incumbent after the Five-Year Rollout Period, Canada frustrated GTH’s
legitimate expectations by subverting a critical condition GTH relied on when it made the
decision to invest in Canada. This is an unambiguous breach of Canada’s obligation to
accord GTH’s investment FET under the BIT.”

501. GTH identifies four ways in which the Transfer Framework and 2013 Spectrum Licensing
Procedure fundamentally changed the terms of the 2008 AWS Auction and Wind Mobile’s
licenses.’*> Canada (a) removed the “enhanced transferability rights” of the licenses;’*° (b) gave

Minister Paradis unfettered discretion to approve and reject transfer applications for any reason;’*’

(c) adopted a new policy objective to have “four wireless providers in every region of the country,”
which it would “use any and every tool at its disposal” to achieve;7** and (d) added new criteria

for transfer requests. ’°°

502. According to GTH, Industry Canada made it clear that under the new Transfer Framework,
it would deny any transfer request that jeopardised its fourth provider policy. For example,
Minister Paradis told the House of Commons that “[s]pectrum set aside for new entrants was never
intended to be transferred to incumbents and as such will not be approved now, nor will it likely

be in the future.”7°°

503. GTH denies that having a guaranteed fourth player had always been the objective of the
2008 AWS Auction. It points to a December 2012 internal Industry Canada presentation, which
stated that “aside from the 5-year restriction on AWS spectrum, there are no other specific
conditions” for spectrum transfer, and that “[c]hanging the current IC approach to license transfer
requests would require consultation.”7”!

504. GTH rejects Canada’s reliance on the fact that transfers of the spectrum licenses were
always subject to the Minister’s approval and that the Minister had the right to amend the
conditions of the licenses.””? In GTH’s view, it was reasonable in the circumstances for New
Entrants to expect that the Minister would approve transfers after expiration of the five-year

restriction.”? Further, Canada informed prospective investors that the Minister’s discretion to

amend conditions to licenses under the Radiocommunications Act 5(1)(b) “would be exercised on

an exceptional basis.”7"4

505. According to GTH, Canada’s internal documents show that the Minister’s authority in this
regard was narrow. In a 2012 memorandum, Industry Canada described the “Status quo” as

follows:

IC would not be in a position to object to spectrum license transfers that would reduce the
limited pool of spectrum available to new entrants and increase incumbents’ spectrum
dominance. The Competition Bureau would be the sole body that could review spectrum
license transfer requests with competitive impacts in mind, with any objections involving
a lengthy legal process.’”°

506. That memorandum also suggests that including spectrum concentration as a factor in the
review of transfer requests would be “additional Ministerial discretion,” and that extending the
five-year restriction would be “changing the rules of the set-aside near the end of the 5 year

period.””"°

507. GTH also opposes Canada’s arguments that the Transfer Framework did not prohibit the
transfer of Wind Mobile License’s to an Incumbent, and that GTH never submitted a transfer
application to Industry Canada. According to GTH, Canada made clear that any transfer from a
New Entrant would not be approved; under such circumstances, “no reasonable New Entrant
would have thought to submit a futile application that the Government had already made clear

would be rejected.””°”

(ii) Unreasonable and Arbitrary Treatment

508. GTH submits that Canada’s adoption of the Transfer Framework was also unreasonable
and arbitrary, constituting a second, independent breach of Article II(2)(a).’°® GTH considers it “a
politically motivated pivot towards the new goal of engineering a fourth player, spurred by public
criticism regarding anticipated market consolidation after the expiration of the Five-Year Rollout

Period.””°

509. According to GTH, Canada had no credible policy objective behind its actions. Rather, the
policy shift was undertaken in response to criticism from analysts and the media that the
Government's efforts to increase competition in the telecom market had failed yet again.*” Indeed,

Canada spent CAD 8.5 million on an advertising campaign to convince the public that the

Government was putting Canadian consumers first.°!

510. GTH alleges that Canada made its fourth player objective the cornerstone of its media

802

campaign,*°? although no such policy had existed at the time of the 2008 AWS Auction.*°? In fact,

in the lead up to the 2008 AWS Auction, Industry Canada recognized that it could not ensure the

success of New Entrants and that the process could result in a market with no New Entrants.8*

511. According to GTH, Canada’s focus on guaranteeing a fourth provider had no rational
relationship to the stated goal of increasing competition; there was no evidence that it would have
such an effect.” Rather, “contemporaneous studies and analysis suggested that Canada’s fourth
player policy was not good for consumers, distorting the market, and stifling innovation.”*°° Mr.
Connolly testifies that the policy was “irrational given that ultimately the market dictates how
many service providers are viable in a given market and not government fiat.”*°’ GTH opines that

in other telecom markets, three providers is the ideal number for a competitive environment.*”

512. In GTH’s view, any legitimate concerns about the effect of license transfers on competition
would have been addressed by the Competition Bureau.*® Indeed, at the time Canada was
considering the Transfer Framework, it knew that the Competition Bureau was “the sole body that
could review spectrum licence transfer requests with competitive impacts in mind.”*!° Thus,
according to GTH, it was redundant for Industry Canada to monitor the effect of transfers on
market consolidation. In the lead up to the 2008 AWS Auction, Industry Canada made clear that
the scope of its mandate was limited to the use of ex-ante measures to encourage competition,

which did not extend to ex post merger reviews.*!!

513. GTH argues that the cost of this arbitrary and unreasonable policy was borne by GTH when
Canada blocked its sale of Wind Mobile. In GTH’s view, Industry Canada unfairly targeted Wind

Mobile precisely because GTH had invested more than other investors to make Wind Mobile the

New Entrant most likely to succeed.*!? GTH states that “Canada breached the BIT by singling out
Wind Mobile in this way.”*'3

514. Finally, GTH contends that even if Canada’s action had any legitimate basis, it would still
constitute a violation of the FET standard because it was disproportionate.*!* GTH alleges that
“Canada knew the approach it took would have the most detrimental impact on the value of GTH’s
investment” but it proceeded despite the fact that it had identified several alternative options to

address its competition concerns.*!5

b. Canada’s Position

515. Canada denies that the Transfer Framework breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by

blocking the sale of Wind Mobile to an Incumbent.*!°

516. Canada’s primary position is that it did not “block” the sale of Wind Mobile to an
Incumbent, as alleged by GTH.®"’ Rather, under the Transfer Framework, each request for a license
transfer was to be considered on a case-by-case basis. While Canada accepts that “the Department
was approached informally on a few occasions about potential deals involving Wind Mobile’s
licences,” it argues that GTH never in fact requested a transfer of Wind Mobile’s licences.*!* Given
that the Minister never denied such a request, Canada concludes that there is no factual basis for

GTH’s claim.

517. In any event, Canada further argues that the Transfer Framework was not contrary to any
legitimate expectations GTH could have held; nor was it an unreasonable or arbitrary measure

targeting Wind Mobile.

(i) GTH’s Expectations

518. According to Canada, GTH’s arguments regarding the alleged frustration of its legitimate

expectations must be rejected for several reasons.

519. First, as a corollary to its objection to GTH’s standing,*'? Canada argues that GTH’s
expectations about the transferability of the AWS spectrum licenses are irrelevant to its claim
because Wind Mobile—not GTH—was the license holder, and GTH has not brought a claim on

behalf of Wind Mobile.*”° Canada’s position is summarized as follows:

The only expectations that can be relevant to the Claimant’s FET claims are those it held
in relation to the investments that are the subject of its claim — its equity in GIHC and its
debt interests with respect to Wind Mobile. The Claimant has not identified any such
expectations. Instead the Claimant focuses on expectations it allegedly held in relation to
Wind Mobile’s spectrum licences, which the Claimant never controlled. ... Similarly, when
considering whether Canada made any representations to the Claimant to induce it to invest
in Wind Mobile, the only representations that are relevant are those related to its
investment.*?!

520. Second, even if the Tribunal were to find GTH’s expectations as to Wind Mobile’s licenses
relevant, Canada contends that it never guaranteed GTH a “right” to sell Wind Mobile or transfer
Wind Mobile’s licences to an Incumbent at the end of the five-year restriction on license
transfers.*?? In Canada’s view, GTH’s alleged expectations are based on a mischaracterization of

the relevant regulatory framework, rather than actual assurances made by Canada.*

521. In this regard, Canada raises the following points:

a. Under the Radio Communications Act, any transfer of a spectrum license requires the
Minister’s approval, and Canadian courts have confirmed that the Minister’s broad

“discretion to manage the spectrum” includes discretion over whether to approve

requests to transfer spectrum licenses.*** In deciding whether to approve a transfer, the

Minister can take into account a wide variety of considerations.*”>

b. As stated in the Licensing Circular in effect at the time of the 2008 AWS Auction,
although spectrum licences with “enhanced transferability and divisibility rights” could
“be transferred in whole or in part (either in geographic area or in bandwidth) to a third

party,” such a transfer was “subject to the conditions stated on the licence and other

applicable regulatory requirements.”*7°

c. The COL’s of Wind Mobile’s licenses stated:

The licensee may apply in writing to transfer its licence in whole or in part (divisibility),
in both the bandwidth and geographic dimensions. Departmental approval is required for
each proposed transfer of a licence, whether the transfer is in whole or in part. The
transferee(s) must also provide an attestation and other supporting documentation
demonstrating that it meets the eligibility criteria and all other conditions, technical or
otherwise, of the licence. ... The Minister of Industry retains the discretion to amend these
terms and conditions of licence at any time.*’

d. The 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework, the AWS Licensing Framework and the

AWS Consultation Paper also expressly state the requirement to obtain approval of any

spectrum licence transfer.*?® Canada made this requirement clear to potential bidders

in the 2008 AWS Auction, through the public questions and answers process.*”

e. GTH and other potential bidders knew that Canada’s objective in conducting the 2008

AWS Auction was not to allow New Entrants to acquire spectrum at a discount only to

have them sell it to Incumbents. *°°

f. The sale of Wind Mobile to an Incumbent would also have been subject to approval by

the Competition Bureau under the Competition Act.**!

522. Canada concludes that no reasonable investor could have had a legitimate expectation that
a New Entrant would be allowed to automatically transfer its spectrum licences to Incumbents at
the end of the five-year restriction on transfers, as GTH alleges. **? Indeed, according to Canada,
GTH has failed to show any law, regulation, policy or statement which contains a specific
assurance or representation regarding Wind Mobile’s alleged ability to transfer the licences to
Incumbents at the end of the five-year restriction.**? Rather, GTH “has attempted to fabricate a

representation ex post facto based on miscellaneous excerpts of policies and procedures, ignoring

clear statements in the same documents that do not support its position.”***

523. Canada argues that the Federal Court rejected that same approach when, in 2013, Telus
challenged the Transfer Framework, arguing that the spectrum licences contained a representation

by the Minister that the Incumbents “would only be prohibited from acquiring the spectrum issued

to new entrants for a period of five years.”**° The Court concluded that the “Minister simply did
not make a representation that would lead a reasonable person to believe that, after five years, the
acquisition or license of set-aside spectrum, by whatever means, would be unregulated by the

Minister.”*°°

524. Moreover, Canada submits that it never represented to GTH or Wind Mobile that the
Minister would certainly approve a transfer request after the expiration of the five-year
restriction.**” This position is supported by the testimony of Mr. Iain Stewart and Mr. Peter Hill.***
In Canada’s view, none of GTH’s arguments is sufficient to establish the existence of a legitimate
expectation regarding the approval of a potential transfer. Specifically, Canada rejects GTH’s
reliance on the speculations of industry analysts and market participants regarding what might
happen after the five-year period.**? Canada also contends that an approval of a license transfer
more than a decade earlier under different circumstances does not create a “past practice” on which

to base future expectations.*“”

525. Third, Canada argues that GTH was on notice that the telecommunications regulatory
framework existing at the time of the 2008 AWS Auction was subject to change.**! In this regard,

Canada notes the following:

a. The Spectrum Licensing Procedure in effect at the time of the 2008 AWS Auction
states that ‘“‘licensing policies are constantly adapting to changes in

radiocommunication in order to respond effectively to the evolving competitive

environment and user needs.”*4

b. The Minister’s authority to amend the COLs is stated in section 5(1)(b) of the

Radiocommunication Act.*

c. The COLs provide that the Minister “retains the discretion to amend these terms and

conditions of licence at any time.”*##

d. The Minister had exercised this discretion and amended the COLs several times before

the Transfer Framework was adopted.**>

526. Canada highlights that Wind Mobile itself actively lobbied for “more regulatory

changes””*4°

and an “overhaul” of the AWS Auction Framework to support competition from New
Entrants.*“” Thus, GTH could not have had a legitimate expectation that Canada would refrain

from making regulatory changes to promote competition.*4*

527. Fourth, Canada submits that the Transfer Framework was not in fact a fundamental change
of the telecommunications regulatory framework that existed at the time GTH made its
investment.**? To the contrary, the Transfer Framework furthered Canada’s longstanding policy
objective of addressing spectrum concentration and fostering competition in the
telecommunications sector, which was the driving force behind the design of the 2008 AWS
Auction itself.*°° Thus, while Canada acknowledges that it had not previously identified spectrum
concentration as a factor the Minister would consider when approving license transfers, it argues

that all market participants were well aware of the Government’s concerns about spectrum

concentration and competition.**! Similarly, Canada rejects GTH’s allegation that the Minister

newly adopted the “fourth player policy” after the 2008 AWS Auction.**

528. According to Canada, the Transfer Framework clarified how the Minister would exercise
his existing statutory discretion in considering license transfer requests, thereby providing
predictability and transparency to licensees.**? Thus, Canada opposes GTH’s position that the
Transfer Framework broadened the Minister’s discretion. According to Canada, GTH relies on a
single internal note to support its view, whereas several other internal notes refer to the
consideration of spectrum concentration as a clarification of the Minister’s existing discretion—
not an addition to it.** In any event, Canada points out that only Parliament has the authority to

expand the Minister’s discretion.*°°

529. Canada also opposes GTH’s submission that Industry Canada’s mandate with respect to
fostering competition was limited to ex ante measures, and that it was the role of the Competition
Bureau to conduct ex post reviews of transfers.*°° Canada contends that GTH was well aware of
the Minister’s ex post authority and, in fact, encouraged the use of that authority in the context of

Shaw’s AWS licenses.8>’ Further, as confirmed by the Federal Court, the Competition Bureau’s

mandate does not override the Minister’s authority to consider spectrum concentration in

reviewing spectrum licence transfer requests. *°*

(ii) Unreasonable and Arbitrary Treatment

530. Canada denies GTH’s allegation that the Transfer Framework was unreasonable and
arbitrary, in violation of Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.*? Canada asserts that GTH’s position is

unfounded and invites the Tribunal to improperly second-guess State policy.*°

531. According to Canada, the “Transfer Framework was adopted in good faith and in pursuit
of Canada’s longstanding policy objective of promoting competition in the wireless
telecommunications sector.”*°! Mr. Hill and Mr. Stewart testify that the motivation behind the

Transfer Framework was Industry Canada’s concern that spectrum concentration could undermine

862

competition in the telecommunications sector.°*” Mr. Hill states that many New Entrants shared

Canada’s concern about the effect of spectrum concentration on competition.** Indeed, Wind

Mobile itself recognized that “the Government’s primary policy objective” was “to create,

enhance, and sustain competition in the Canadian wireless telecommunications market.”

Therefore, Canada sees no basis for GTH’s current position that the Transfer Framework was

adopted to “deflect public criticism” rather than to advance a legitimate policy objective.°®

532. Canada similarly rejects GTH’s argument that the Transfer Framework was “irrational” or

not evidence-based.*© In Canada’s view, the “Tribunal has no mandate to assess the substantive

correctness or the evidentiary basis of the Transfer Framework but even if it did, the record shows
that the Transfer Framework was not irrational.”*°’ Canada submits that GTH has provided no
convincing evidence for its allegations in this regard. In particular, Canada considers Mr.
Connolly’s testimony to be of “limited relevance,” given that he (a) lacks first-hand knowledge of
the adoption of the Transfer Framework, and (b) did not work in the branch of Industry Canada

responsible for researching and advising on telecommunications policy.**

533. Moreover, Canada contends that it adopted the Transfer Framework only after months of

deliberations and consideration of alternative options.°

534. Canada also highlights that it held a public consultation, beginning with the Transfer
Framework Consultation Paper, which set out the concerns about spectrum concentration and
invited comments on the proposed approach.*”? The public and licensees were given ample time
to comment, and Wind Mobile took advantage of the opportunity.*”! Canada concludes that the
licensees were accorded due process, and the “fact that the Government did not retain the approach
proposed by Wind Mobile does not mean that the Transfer Framework was unreasonable or

arbitrary.”*7

535. Canada opposes GTH’s argument that Industry Canada’s consideration of spectrum
concentration in reviewing license transfer requests was “redundant” with the Competition
Bureau’s mandate to review merger transactions involving spectrum licences.*’* Canada’s position
is that the Minister’s review authority co-exists with that of the Competition Bureau, as confirmed

by the Federal Court.*”4 According to Canada, the two review processes are distinct, and only the

could object to a merger only “if it was likely to result in a substantial lessening or prevention of

distinction was explained in the Transfer Framework*” and previously in the 2008 AWS Auction

Consultation Paper.*”*

536. Finally, Canada submits that there is no basis for GTH’s argument that Canada targeted
Wind Mobile. According to Canada, the Transfer Framework was not aimed at Wind Mobile’s
licenses, but instead applied to all commercial mobile spectrum licences.*”? Canada contends that

GTH’s position in this arbitration is inconsistent with earlier comments by Wind Mobile and GTH:
a. Wind Mobile did not oppose the Transfer Framework during the 2013 consultation.**°

b. Wind Mobile had informally expressed that it would support an extension of the five-

year transfer restriction.**!

d. GTH encouraged regulatory action to address its concern that spectrum speculation had
been allowed, and that New Entrants might be “allowed to re-sell AWS to highest
bidder after 2014.88

537. For Canada, this shows that Wind Mobile was in a position to benefit from regulatory
measures promoting competition, and GTH cannot now argue that Canada’s efforts in this regard

targeted Wind Mobile.**+

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis
538. This section of the Award contains the Tribunal’s analysis of GTH’s FET claims relating
to Canada’s adoption and implementation of the Transfer Framework. The Tribunal will consider
GTH’s claims that Canada’s actions (i) frustrated GTH’s legitimate expectations and (ii) were

arbitrary, unreasonable, and lacked transparency.

(i) Legitimate Expectations
539. To determine whether Canada’s conduct frustrated GTH’s legitimate expectations and, as
a result, breached the FET standard as set out in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT, the Tribunal will
examine whether, based on the evidence adduced by the Parties, it is possible to identify
representations by Canada that could give rise to legitimate expectations by GTH, the extent to
which GTH relied on those representations in its investment decision, and whether Canada
fundamentally departed from those representations after GTH made its investment in reliance

thereon.

540. The Tribunal has reviewed, inter alia, the 2001 Spectrum Auction Framework,**> the
Spectrum Licensing Procedure,**® the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework,**” and the AWS

Auction Consultation Paper,*** all of which were available to GTH in 2008 when considering

whether to invest in Canada. The Tribunal finds no compelling evidence that Canada represented
at the time of the AWS Auction that it would unconditionally permit New Entrants to transfer their
set-aside licences to Incumbents, or that the Minister would approve all applications to transfer
set-aside spectrum to Incumbents automatically after the expiry of the five-year transfer restriction.

The evidence reviewed below supports this finding.
541. Under the heading “Licence Transferability and Divisibility,” the COLs state:

The licensee may apply in writing to transfer its licence in whole or in part (divisibility),
in both the bandwidth and geographic dimensions. Departmental approval is required for
each proposed transfer of a licence, whether the transfer is in whole or in part.**?

542. As highlighted by both Parties, the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework and the AWS
Licensing Framework each contains the following statement: “While all licence transfers must be
approved by the Minister, licences obtained through the set-aside may not be transferred to
companies that do not meet the criteria of a new entrant for a period of 5 years from the date of
issuance.”*® Canada correctly argues that this statement put potential bidders on notice that all
license transfers were subject to ministerial approval. The Tribunal finds the language to be
unambiguous in this respect. GTH focuses instead on the second limb of the statement, which sets
out the five-year restriction on transfers. In effect, GTH attempts to turn this restriction on transfers
into a positive obligation of Canada to permit transfers after the five-year period. The Tribunal
does not accept this argument. Reading selectively the part of the statement that GTH cites as a
guarantee of unconditional transfer would override the express requirement of ministerial approval

contained in the other part of the same statement.

543. The Responses to Questions for Clarification on the AWS Policy and Licensing
Frameworks, a document that Canada issued on 27 February 2008 as a companion document to
the other documents for the AWS Auction, which was adduced by GTH as evidence in this

arbitration, further corroborates the Tribunal’s determination in the preceding paragraph. In that

document, Canada indicated: “Once licences have been issued, licensees may transfer licences,

subject to departmental approval, to other companies provided that they meet the conditions of

licence.”*°! Canada further specified in that document:

544.

As outlined in the AWS Licensing Framework, departmental approval is required for each
proposed transfer of a licence, whether the transfer is in whole or in part. The licensee must
apply to Industry Canada in writing. The transferee(s) must also provide an attestation and
other supporting documentation demonstrating that it meets the eligibility criteria and all
other conditions, technical or otherwise, of the licence. This provision applies for the entire
term of the licence.*°”

At the Hearing, the former director of Industry Canada, Mr. Connolly, explained that a

license transfer requires Ministerial approval because the transfer involves the issuance of a new

licence, which only the Minister has authority to do:

545.

Q. Now, under item (a)(i.1), the act grants the minister authority for the issuance of
spectrum licences; correct? You can also see it on the screen.

A. Yes.

Q. And through the authority to issue licences, the minister has authority over transfer
reviews; correct?

A. Yes, he does.

Q. And just so we all understand how transfers work, transfers involve the surrendering of
a licence and the issuance of a new licence; correct?

A. Yes, the scheme of the Radiocommunication Act is such that the licence must be issued
to the entity that’s going to own or operate radio apparatus. To transfer a licence, a licence
is revoked with consent from party A and a new licence issued to party B.

Q. So a transfer in spectrum is not like selling typical goods, where two individuals in the
private market can just exchange the good freely, without the government being involved;
correct?

A. The government must be involved, at a minimum, because, as I’ve mentioned, party B
is to receive a new radio authorisation. Party B must, at minimum, meet the eligibility
requirements that are in the regulations, and it’s the minister’s responsibility to verify that
those eligibility requirements have been met.*”?

While the policy documents repeatedly refer to the required approval of the Minister, they

do not contain any assurance that such approval shall be granted where the eligibility criteria of

the transferee are fulfilled and the restriction period has expired. Meeting the eligibility criteria is

necessary to apply for a license transfer; however, ministerial approval is

 

still required for the
transfer to be effective. In this sense, the eligibility requirements stand as an admissibility
prerequisite: the Minister need not consider a transfer application that does not meet the
prerequisite. GTH ignores the distinction between admissibility and approval when it argues that
such a reading of the Minister’s power renders the five-year restriction redundant and of no

meaning.*** The COLs leave no doubt that the transfer is predicated on the Minister’s approval:

Departmental approval is required for each proposed transfer of a licence, whether the
transfer is in whole or in part. The transferee(s) must also provide an attestation and other
supporting documentation demonstrating that it meets the eligibility criteria and all other
conditions, technical or otherwise, of the licence.®?>

546. This is also reflected in the testimony of Mr. Connolly who explained that even if the
eligibility criteria were met, the Minister retained discretion to approve or disapprove transfers

after five years:

Q. So even if the eligibility criteria were met, the minister retained discretion to approve
or disapprove transfers after five years; correct?

A. He did.

Q. Canada also did not make an express or explicit promise or representation that transfers
to incumbents would be automatically approved after five years; correct?

A. That is correct. And as I’ve explained before, it cannot be automatic, because the
minister has 25 obligations.*°®

547. The Tribunal notes the assertion by GTH that “the evidence shows that the only express
restriction on transfer contained in set-aside spectrum licenses was the 5-year restriction on transfer
to an Incumbent.”®” That assertion, in the terms by GTH, casts light on a fundamental flaw in
GTH’s case: the five-year restriction on transfer is not the only restriction; meeting eligibility

criteria and obtaining the Minister’s approval of the application for transfer are prerequisites. And

neither of those two prerequisites excludes the Minister’s ability to take into account spectrum

concentration when deciding whether to approve an application for transfer.

548. GTH has highlighted the statement in the Spectrum Licensing Procedure that spectrum
licenses obtained through an auction process enjoy the “privilege” of “enhanced transferability and
divisibility rights.”*°® However, the Tribunal has been shown no evidence that enhanced
transferability alone guarantees a favourable outcome of the ministerial approval process. As
Canada explained, the term “enhanced transferability” for auctioned licences meant that a licensee
could apply to transfer an unutilised spectrum licence or unutilised parts thereof.*°? This is in
contrast to non-auctioned licences or radio licences, which could usually only be indivisibly

transferred as part of a going concern.°”

549. More generally, all of the policy documents must be read in the context of the underlying
legislative and regulatory regime. In particular, the Radiocommunication Act expressly gives the

Minister the power to amend the COLs:

taking into account all matters that the Minister considers relevant for ensuring the orderly
establishment or modification of radio stations and the orderly development and efficient
operation of radiocommunication in Canada ... (b) amend the terms and conditions of any
licence, certificate or authorization issued under paragraph (a).””!

550. The Tribunal notes that its reading of the relevant policy documents is consistent with that

of Canada’s Federal Court in Telus v. AGC, which held:

[N]othing in these statements constitutes a statement, or even an implication that, at the
end of five years a party may freely, without review or constraint by the Minister, licence
or acquire any or all of the set-aside spectrum, nor do any of these statements constitute an
undertaking or assurance by the Minister that, after five years, the Minister may decline to
exercise discretion to manage the spectrum.?

551. GTH seeks to sidestep this outcome by pointing to internal memoranda circulated within
Government agencies purportedly expressing Canada’s view that New Entrants were entitled to
transfer their set-aside spectrum upon the expiry of the five-year restriction. For example, in one
memorandum, a staffer of Industry Canada indicates: “Incumbents would have to wait five years
before being able to acquire a new entrant, either to reduce competition or to acquire spectrum
capacity.”°°? The Tribunal notes that this internal memorandum was not available to GTH at the
time of the investment so as to permit even the possibility of building a legitimate expectation
thereon.*™ In any event, the Tribunal finds no persuasive argument prompting it to give priority
to an internal memorandum over the explicit terms of the policy documents discussed above.
Moreover, the arbitral record contains other contemporaneous internal Government documents
that emphasise the cumulative conditions of transferability as stated in the COLs, such as the

following:

Q15 — Could new entrants use a set-aside to flip the spectrum for profit at the expense of
taxpayers?

No. A condition of licence will stipulate that the spectrum acquired under a set-aside cannot
be sold to companies that are not eligible for the set-aside, for 5 years following the auction.

There is nothing automatic about a licence transfer. The transfer of a licence is subject to
Ministerial approval.°°

552. The Tribunal will next consider GTH’s argument that the Minister’s previous approvals of
transfers of mobile spectrum licences created a precedent as to how he would review transfer
applications, resulting in a legitimate expectation that transfers to Incumbents would receive
approval if the eligibility criteria and the moratorium expiry prerequisites were met. In this

regard, Mr. Connolly testified at the Hearing as follows:

Q. Past transfer approvals do not and cannot bind the minister in his or her exercise of
discretion over subsequent transfer applications, can they?

A. [don’t believe so.”
553. In his Second Witness Statement, Mr. Hill stated:

Furthermore, Telus’ acquisition of Clearnet and Rogers’ purchase of Microcell are not
examples of automatic transferability without Ministerial approval. The Department
analyzed each application and provided recommendations to the Minister based on the
context and circumstances prevailing at the time. In each case, the Minister exercised his
discretion and issued a decision. These administrative decisions, made on a case-by-case
basis, do not create precedents regarding future decisions by the Minister. Each decision to
approve or deny a licence transfer is based on the particular circumstances of the request.
By 2013 and 2014, the conditions prevailing in the wireless telecommunications market
were significantly different than the circumstances prevailing a decade earlier when the
Clearnet and Microcell licence transfers occurred.°™*

554. The Tribunal accepts this testimony and does not agree with GTH’s argument that the
Minister’s past approvals could create an expectation as to future approvals upon which GTH was

entitled to rely.

555. In sum, the record makes clear that Canada did not make any representation which could
give rise to a legitimate expectation of GTH that it is assured of being permitted to transfer its
spectrum licenses to an Incumbent after the expiry of the five-year restriction on transfers. In light
of this determination of the Tribunal, it is unnecessary for the Tribunal to examine whether GTH’s
relied, exclusively or not,*” on representations by Canada in reaching its decision in 2008 to invest
in Canada. Any assumptions GTH made based on what the market might have expected Canada
to do in relation to applications for transfer at the end of the five-year period were made at GTH’s

own risk; their consequences cannot be imputed to Canada.

556. For completeness, however, the Tribunal notes that GTH’s own internal documents reveal

a gap between what the policy documents provided and what GTH took from those documents.

Globalive that had not been shared with the Canadian Government before the investment was
made.”!! That Memorandum only referred to the five-year restriction on the sale of spectrum to an
Incumbent; it did not mention the other eligibility conditions required of the transferee or the
requirement of ministerial approval set out in the COLs. Another example is the presentation by
JP Morgan to Orascom Telecom on 10 April 2008, which indicated that a “License may not be
transferred to incumbent companies for 5 years from issuance,” but did not mention the other
conditions on transfer set out in the auction documents and the underlying statutes.?!?7 GTH’s
reliance on those reports, which were prepared by its professional advisors on the basis of publicly
available auction documents and their underlying rules, was GTH’s own business decision for

which Canada cannot be faulted.

557. GTH’s misreading of the policy documents is also reflected in the testimony of Mr. Dobbie
and Mr. Andrew. Mr. Dobbie stated that “after the five-year period was up, a New Entrant would
be able to sell set-aside spectrum licences to an Incumbent.”?'? Mr. Andrew similarly stated that
“after the 5-year period had expired, a New Entrant would be free to transfer the set-aside spectrum
licences to any entity meeting the O&C Rules, including an Incumbent.”?!* Those views are plainly
unsupported by the policy documents to which they refer. What those documents permit a New
Entrant to do upon the expiry of the five-year transfer restriction is to apply for transfer to an entity
meeting the eligibility criteria, including an Incumbent, whereupon the Minister will review the
application and decide whether to approve that application. Conflating the ability to apply for a
transfer and the actual transfer is an interpretation of the applicable rules that GTH chose to make;

Canada cannot be held liable for the consequences of GTH’s own choice.

Memorandum had been submitted to the Government, although only in August 2009. Day 8, Tr.168:18-21 (Madden).
In reply to a question from the Tribunal, counsel for GTH submitted: “No, sir, we do not submit that this amounts to

August 2009, in our submission, because it was actually provided to the Government of Canada expressly in response
to a request, ‘Please provide us with all the documents that you sent to investors to encourage investment’. So as at
that date, yes, they had knowledge of this document. But this document, in terms of the period February 2008 leading

558. For these reasons, the Tribunal finds that GTH has not established the existence of any
legitimate expectation that was violated, in breach of the BIT, by Canada’s adoption and

implementation of the Transfer Framework.

559. Had GTH succeeded in evidencing that, after it made its investment based on the terms and
undertakings set out in the auction policy documents, Canada had fundamentally altered those
policy documents, for example by prolonging the five-year finite restriction on transfer, or by
deciding that no set-aside licence may be transferred at all at any time, there could have been an
argument that Canada may have breached its obligation pursuant to Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

However, no such evidence was presented to the Tribunal.

560. In the next section, the Tribunal will consider GTH’s claims of arbitrariness,

unreasonableness and lack of transparency.

(ii) Arbitrariness, Unreasonableness and Lack of Transparency

561. In considering GTH’s claim that Canada acted arbitrarily and unreasonably in adopting
and implementing the Transfer framework, the Tribunal will have reference to the standard stated
by the tribunal in Crystallex v. Venezuela that “a measure is for instance arbitrary if it is not based
on legal standards but on excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference, and taken for
reasons that are different from those put forward by the decision maker.”?!> The Tribunal also
accepts GTH’s reference to the tests of arbitrariness expressed by Professor Schreuer in his expert
opinion in EDF v. Romania, including his view that a measure is arbitrary if it “inflicts damage on

the investor without serving any apparent legitimate purpose.”?!®

562. In applying the standard, the Tribunal’s task is not to second guess the substantive
correctness of Canada’s regulatory decisions or the policy motivations behind those decisions. The
Tribunal considers that deference is due to the competent governmental authorities in the exercise

of their mandate. At the same time, this Tribunal agrees with the statement of the Crystallex

tribunal that “deference to the primary decisionmakers cannot be unlimited, as otherwise a host
state would be entirely shielded from state responsibility and the standards of protection contained

in BITs would be rendered nugatory.”?!”

563. The Tribunal further notes, with agreement, that investment tribunals have consistently
tuled that, absent an undertaking of the host State to stabilise the regulatory framework in the
sector where the investment is made, a change in that framework to reflect the market evolution

that is not arbitrary or aimed to harm the investor is not a breach of the FET standard.?!®

564. The difficulty for GTH is that, in attempting to establish a breach of the FET standard under
the BIT, it has not met its burden of proving that the Transfer Framework was not based on legal
standards, reflected an excess of discretion, prejudice or personal preference, or was politically

motivated and without any legitimate policy objective.

565. In particular, GTH evidenced no fundamental inconsistency with Canada’s spectrum
management policy objectives or with the objectives of the 2008 AWS Auction. The evidence
adduced showed that references to spectrum concentration in the 2013 Transfer Framework that
brought Industry Canada to block the transfer of set-aside spectrum licences to Incumbents were
essentially adopted to enhance competition. This reflected the change in the market between 2008
and 2012 due to the rising use of smartphones which made it critical for the government to control

spectrum concentration.°!? While before June 2013, spectrum concentration might not have been

conspicuously underscored as a condition for approval of transfer, the rationale for the 2008 AWS
Auction was built on the need to avoid concentration by the Incumbents. The Telecommunications

Act, a source of Ministerial authority over spectrum management, ””

provides “that the Canadian
telecommunications policy has as its objectives [...] (c) to enhance the efficiency and
competitiveness, at the national and international levels, of Canadian telecommunications.””?! In
reply to an argument of inconsistency put by GTH,*” the Tribunal does not find any illegitimacy
or irrationality in the Canadian Government’s considering in 1994 that the market was competitive
and introducing ten years later, in 2013, a Transfer Framework to regulate spectrum concentration,
given the important evolution in the market that was amply discussed at the Hearing. Wind
Mobile’s acknowledgment that “the Government’s primary policy objective” was “to create,
enhance, and sustain competition in the Canadian wireless telecommunications market”
contradicts GTH’s argument that the Transfer Framework was politically-motivated, and adopted

to “deflect public criticism” rather than to advance a legitimate policy objective.*”*

566. Accordingly, and contrary to GTH’s contention, the Tribunal does not see in the adduced
evidence a fundamental change in the 2013 Transfer Framework, but rather different wording of
the same policy that had been the consistent rationale for the AWS Auction since its inception.
Moreover, the discretionary authority of the Minister to approve transfer applications, omnipresent
in the AWS Auction policy documents, never excluded spectrum concentration as one of the

criteria for approval.

567. At the Hearing, the Parties debated the evidentiary impact of certain internal advice to the
Minister not referring to spectrum concentration as a specific criterion in the outcome of the
transfer review process.”* The Tribunal finds in that debate no grounds permitting it to infer a
limitation of the Minister’s discretion to consider other factors as would be consistent with the
objectives of the Radiocommunication Act and Telecommunications Act in reviewing licence

transfers, as that discretion had been indicated in the COLs.

568. Moreover, the Tribunal considers that neither the terms of the licences nor the statutes that
underlie those licences can be read as committing Canada to freeze its telecom regulatory
framework. Specifically, the Radiocommunication Act provides the Minister with authority, albeit
on an exceptional basis and only after consultation,*”> to “amend the terms and conditions of any
licence, certificate or authorization issued paragraph (a).”°?° The COLs, one of the main documents

on which GTH rests its claim of legitimate expectations,””” refer to the Radiocommunication Act

and make it binding on the spectrum licensee.”

569. GTH has also asserted that Canada’s actions breached the FET standard because they

lacked transparency. In its Closing Presentation, GTH advanced two arguments in this regard:

First, assuming Canada’s assertion regarding Canada’s intended meaning of the
transferability of licenses is correct, Canada failed to ensure that GTH understood that
“undue spectrum concentration” would be used to prevent GTH’s ability to sell its
investment. [...]

Second, assuming Canada’s assertion regarding Canada’s intended meaning of the
transferability of licenses is correct, Canada failed to clarify to GTH the meaning of this
provision when it became aware of GTH’s understanding in August 2009.°”°

 

570. The Tribunal finds that Canada’s explicitly stated prerequisites for spectrum
transferability, including competition policy considerations that may be considered by the Minister
in the approval process, satisfy any transparency requirement that might arise under the FET
obligation. The Tribunal finds no ground in the BIT, including in the principles of international
law against which the FET standard is to be assessed pursuant to Article II(2)(a), to warrant
additionally to ascribe Canada to a duty to correct potential misunderstandings of the applicable
tules that the investor, GTH, competently counselled throughout the investment process, has

chosen to infer.

(iii) Conclusion
571. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal dismisses GTH’s claim that Canada violated
Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by denying GTH the ability to transfer the set-aside spectrum licenses
to an Incumbent after expiry of the five-year transfer restriction period. GTH has not established
that Canada frustrated GTH’s legitimate expectations, or that Canada subjected GTH treatment
that was arbitrary, unreasonable, non-transparent, politically motivated or without any legitimate

policy objective.

572. In light of that conclusion, the Tribunal decides that it is unnecessary also to review
Canada’s defense on the standing of GTH to bring this claim, allegedly because only Wind Mobile

(the license holder) could assert its entitlement to legitimate expectations.

= GTH alleges that Canada’s actions were unreasonable, arbitrary, non-transparent, and
that they failed to accord GTH due process.”?!

574. Regarding the specific legal standards applicable to measures concerning national security
issues, GTH asserts that such measures are not entitled to special deference.®*? GTH notes that the
BIT contains no carve-out for national security issues. According to GTH, tribunals have found
that State conduct in the name of national security concerns may violate the FET standard,
particularly where other motives were involved or there were alternative means of addressing the
State’s concerns that would not have conflicted with the FET obligation.°** GTH submits that “[iJn
these circumstances, once an investor has made a prima facie case that there has been a breach,

of Canada’s FET obligation.”°”?

b. Canada’s Position

583. Canada submits that GTH’s claim relating to the national security review must be
dismissed because GTH misstates the applicable legal standard and fails to prove its allegations.?”*
According to Canada, the record shows that the national security review complied at all times with

Article I(2)(a) of the BIT.°75

584. Canada rejects GTH’s assertion that no special deference is due to State actions taken in
the context of national security concerns.°”° Canada argues that the authorities cited by GTH
contradict its own position. For example, Canada refers to the award in Devas v. India, which

states:

An arbitral tribunal may not sit in judgment on national security matters as on any other
factual dispute arising between an investor and a State. National security issues relate to
the existential core of a State. An investor who wishes to challenge a State decision in that
respect faces a heavy burden of proof, such as bad faith, absence of authority or application
to measures that do not relate to essential security interests.°””

585. Thus, in Canada’s view, the “principle of deference towards Government decision-making
should apply even more forcefully to highly sensitive policy areas where national security is at
stake.”*”® Although GTH asserts that it is not challenging | the national security
review, Canada contends that this is precisely what GTH does when it asks the Tribunal to second-

guess the existence of the national security concerns underlying the review.°”? Canada asserts that

the Tribunal is not permitted to view i ii i _ in this way.°°°

586. In any event, Canada contends that GTH has failed to prove its various factual allegations

regarding its Voting Control Application the national security review.

587. First, Canada rejects GTH’s assertion that it had “secured a right” to acquire voting control
of Wind Mobile once Canada’s O&C Rules were liberalized, and that it was therefore surprised
by the national security review.°*' According to Canada, GTH ignores the “fundamentally
different contexts in which ownership and control reviews and ICA reviews operate.”°*? In 2008,
Industry Canada reviewed Wind Mobile’s Shareholders’ Agreement in Wind Mobile for
compliance with the then-applicable O&C Rules under the Telecommunications Act and the
Radiocommunication Act.?* In contrast, the IRD conducted the review under the ICA to
determine whether GTH’s Voting Control Application was likely to be of net benefit to Canada
and whether it would threaten national security.°** Canada points out that when the O&C Rules
were liberalized in 2012, the Minister made clear that “the provisions of the Investment Canada

985

Act will continue to apply, a fact which GTH’s counsel acknowledged in a January 2013

letter.°%°

588. Therefore, Canada does not see how the 2008 review of Wind Mobile’s Shareholders’
Agreement, or the liberalization of the O&C Rules is 2012, could have resulted in any expectation

regarding the review of GTH’s Voting Control Application by IRD.**’

589. Second, Canada denies that its national security review was a pretext to advance its

telecommunications policy, as alleged by GTH.** In Canada’s view, GTH’s claim is “predicated

d. GTH’s allegations are illogical because “GTH’s acquisition of voting control of Wind
Mobile was seen as potentially leading to more investment in Wind Mobile which
would advance Canada’s telecommunications policy objectives and further

590. Canada submits that, in light of the above, GTH cannot credibly argue that Canada’s
national security concerns were trumped up to allow the Government to investigate or impede
GTH’s business plans to further telecommunications policy.! For Canada, it is clear that the

national security review was motivated by legitimate national security interests.

 

591. Third, contrary to GTH’s allegations, Canada submits that it accorded GTH due process at

all times during the national security review.

592. In this regard, Canada states that a national security review involves “‘a highly structured
and regulated process,” which “involves many Government departments and agencies as well as
the Executive of the Government, the Governor General acting on the advice of the Queen’s Privy
Council for Canada.” !°5 Canada outlines the various steps in the process, which are, in its view,

“designed to ensure that the outcome is not manifestly arbitrary.” !°°°

593. Canada opposes GTH’s allegations regarding the secrecy of the process. According to
Canada, national security reviews involve sensitive information and materials and, by their very

nature, cannot be completely transparent. !°’ However, Canada asserts that it provided GTH with

sufficient information to ensure procedural fairness. !0 Ee

Po Thus, even if the FET standard includes

595. Inresponse to GTH’s allegations that the lack of transparency is demonstrated by Canada’s
subsequent adoption of the Guidelines on the National Security Review of Investments, Canada
contends that these Guidelines did not change the way in which national security reviews are
conducted under the ICA and, in any event, would not amount to a “tacit recognition” of any “prior

deficiency.”!°!”

596. In addition, Canada submits that GTH was provided with a fair opportunity to respond to

601. At the outset, the Tribunal notes a marked difference between the national security review-
related claim advanced by GTH and its other claim in relation to the transferability of set-aside
AWS licences. In relation to the national security review, it is undisputed that GTH had been put
on notice in the 2008 AWS Auction documents of the requirement that an acquisition of control
by a non-Canadian of an investment of the type GTH made in Wind Mobile in the Canadian
wireless market is subject to the restrictions set out in the O&C Rules and to a confidential review
for determination by the Minister of whether that acquisition of control would be of net benefit to

Canada.!°”° To that end, the AWS Auction Consultation Paper provided:

1026 R-169, Investment Canada Act (29 June 2012-25 June 2013), § 16; C-144, Letter from W. VanderBurgh to M.J
Thivierge, 22 January 2013, p. 3.

2.5.1 Foreign Investment Restrictions

Canadian ownership and control requirements impose certain restrictions on foreign
investment in facilities-based telecommunications carriers in Canada including wireless
carriers. The spectrum considered in this consultation process will eventually be licensed
under the Radiocommunication Act subject to Canadian ownership and control
requirements and therefore subject to foreign investment restrictions. Foreign investment
restrictions have the effect of limiting potential entry in the telecommunications market
thereby reducing the competitive discipline that the threat of entry can provide. It is
important to consider the effect this may have on the free operation of the market and the
ability to rely solely on market forces in the forthcoming auction. !°7”

602. Similarly, the restrictions on foreign investment in the Canadian wireless market was

underscored in the 2008 AWS Auction Policy Framework:

In addition to access to spectrum, a consideration particular to the Canadian wireless
market is the presence of Canadian ownership requirements under the Telecommunications
Act which apply to all facilities-based carriers. These requirements ensure that Canada's
telecommunications infrastructure is owned and controlled by Canadians. However they
also act as restrictions on foreign investment which constitutes a barrier to market entry.
The question of foreign ownership restrictions is being studied by the Competition Policy
Review Panel. Removal or liberalization of these requirements would require legislative
changes. !07

603. The conclusion is therefore unescapable that GTH had all the means to know, at the time
of making its investment, that the ownership of a Canadian wireless business was subject to foreign
investment restrictions. Importantly, GTH had also been given contemporaneous knowledge that
any change in those restrictions would require an amendment to the laws, not merely

administrative tolerance or the exercise of the Minister’s discretion.

604. To the extent that GTH acted upon the assumption that “there was a policy movement in
Canada towards a relaxation of the O&C Rules which would allow a foreign company like GTH
to take control of its investment in Wind Mobile,” as Mr. Dobbie testified, that assumption reflects
the degree of risk that GTH was willing to take on when deciding to invest in Canada. '°? Indeed,

that assumption proved correct: Canada did eventually relax the O&C Rules as expected.

605. However, the change in the O&C Rules did not guarantee that GTH would be permitted to

take control of Wind Mobile, or that its attempt to do so would be exempt from review under the

606. Similarly, the applicability of the ICA was unaffected by the fact that GTH structured its
“investment in a way that would give GTH the right to take control if the O&C Rules changed.”!°?!
GTH may have had such a right in the relevant corporate documents, but that contractual right

does not supersede applicable Canadian law.

607. In these circumstances, it is not the Tribunal’s role to assess Po
rr

claims, the Tribunal need only consider how that process was conducted.

608. First, the Tribunal will address GTH’s allegation that the process was not transparent.
Assessing the proper standard of transparency in relation to acts of government requires taking
into account the sensitivity of the information at issue. In a national security review, it is
understandable that intelligence agencies might conduct investigations before informing the
targeted persons, or that information requests might not state the reasons therefor in full detail. The
Tribunal considers that due process standard should be deemed satisfied where the subject of the
investigation is afforded a fair opportunity to make its case in relation to readily identifiable issues,

and that opportunity is afforded reasonably ahead of an administrative decision being made based

on objectively verifiable factors and after an appropriate time period which is not unnecessarily
tushed. The Tribunal will apply this standard to the relevant facts surrounding the national security

review, which are largely uncontested.

609. The background to the purpose of the ICA review of foreign investments can be found in

the witness statement of Ms. Aitken, the Director of IRD at the relevant time:

The ICA is the primary mechanism for reviewing foreign investments in Canada. It
contemplates the review of significant investments by non-Canadians to determine whether
they are likely to be of net benefit to Canada and it provides a mechanism for the review
of investments by non-Canadians that could be injurious to national security. [...]

Under the ICA, the Minister is responsible for determining whether direct investments by
non-Canadians in non-cultural Canadian businesses are likely to be of net benefit to
Canada. A non-Canadian seeking to acquire control of an established Canadian business
valued at or above a certain threshold must apply for review of that acquisition, which
entails an assessment by the Minister of whether or not the investment is likely to be of net
benefit to Canada. '°

More generally, as Canada rightly submits:

National security concerns are not static, they evolve over time as the nature of security
threats change, new intelligence is gathered and the assessment of these risks reviewed. An

they raise depending on other available information and the surrounding circumstances. !°4>

considers that evidence as satisfactorily demonstrating genuine national security concerns assessed
by the competent authorities. As a result, GTH’s claims that Canada’s actions were unreasonable

617. To be complete, the Tribunal has reviewed GTH’s claim that Canada misused the national
security review of its Voting Control Application in order to further Canada’s telecommunication
policy objectives.'°*° The evidence on the record does not support GTH’s arguments. The
evidentiary record shows that national security concerns assessed by the competent Canadian
security and intelligence authorities prompted the ICA review.!°°! Alleging, as GTH does,' that
the purpose of conducting a national security review in this case was to advance
telecommunication policy objectives of Canada or to allow time to implement the Transfer

evidentiary burden of establishing its allegation. The claim must be dismissed.

business with its potential for windfall profit or for abysmal loss. In any event, it cannot turn into

(5) Whether the Measures Cumulatively Breached the Respondent’s Fair and
Equitable Treatment Obligation

a. GTH’s Position
619. GTH submits that Canada’s pattern of treatment of GTH’s investment following the 2008

AWS Auction until the sale of Wind Mobile in September 2014, taken together, cumulatively
breached Article II(2)(a).!°”

620. According to GTH, it is well accepted (including by Canada)!°>* that certain Government
measures, which would not appear to amount to a breach of the FET standard in isolation, may

amount to a breach when viewed cumulatively with other acts.'°°? GTH cites the award in El Paso

   

1056 CWS-Dry, {| 26, 29 (referring to GTH having “already invested well over CAD 1 billion”) and having to decide
whether to “commit to a potential further investment of as much as CAD 230 million to participate in the auction.”).

v. Argentina, in which the tribunal held that Argentina had breached the FET standard through a
series of measures that contributed to claimants selling their investment at a loss.!° The El Paso
tribunal viewed Argentina’s measures “as cumulative steps which individually do not qualify as
violations of FET, ... but which amount to a violation if their cumulative effect is considered,”
and noted that the “combination of all these measures completely altered the overall

framework.” 1°!

621. In GTH’s view, the theory of cumulative or composite breach does not require that the
relevant acts were driven by a common intent.!°* Rather, as stated by the tribunal in Tecmed v.

Mexico, the “common thread” is “a converging action towards the same result, i.e. depriving the

investor of its investment, thereby violating the Agreement.” !0%

622. Applying the theory of cumulative breach to the present case, GTH argues that Canada’s

cumulative acts over the life of GTH’s investment breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT by:

(i) amounting to a complete frustration of GTH’s legitimate expectation that it would be
subject to a framework designed to alleviate barriers to entry and to facilitate competition
in the wireless telecommunications market; and (ii) by subjecting GTH to a “series of
circumstances,” which, in toto, can only be described as unreasonable, arbitrary, non-
transparent, and inconsistent. !0*

623. While GTH accepts “that Canada could not guarantee its success,” it asserts that it
legitimately expected Canada to maintain the framework it had designed to induce GTH’s
investment, which was aimed at reducing barriers to entry and facilitating competition in the

wireless telecommunications market.!°° Instead, GTH alleges, Canada undertook a series of

elements are in a time period with different durations, it is only by observation as a whole or as a unit that it is possible
to see to what extent a violation of a treaty or of international law rises or to what extent damage is caused.”).

measures that “stripped the 2008 AWS Auction Framework ... of any meaning” and devastated

the value of GTH’s investment. '°%

624. First, GTH alleges that from 2009 through 2012, it was subjected to “an unreasonable,
redundant, and inconsistent O&C review process by the CRTC.”!°°” According to GTH, the CRTC
created a new, onerous four-tier review procedure to target Wind Mobile even though Industry
Canada had already reviewed and confirmed Wind Mobile’s compliance with the O&C Rules

when it issued Wind Mobile’s spectrum licenses. !° GTH alleges that CRTC created the procedure

in direct response to requests from Wind Mobile’s competitors. !°

625. In GTH’s view, Canada knew that this duplicative review was likely to harm Wind Mobile,
but the CRTC conducted it anyway and, applying the same O&C Rules as Industry Canada had

applied, reached the opposite conclusion.'!°” This stalled GTH’s investment, “putting Wind, its

626. Second, GTH submits that in the 2008 AWS Auction Framework, Canada informed
prospective investors that it would introduce mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing conditions,
to address and important barrier to market entry.!° Yet, according to GTH, “despite its
assurances, Canada failed to ensure a fair and reasonable regulatory environment for the New
Entrants.”!°75 With respect to roaming, Canada failed to act or provide clarity regarding the
applicable conditions when GTH had difficulty obtaining reasonable terms in its negotiations with
Incumbents, despite repeated requests from GTH.!°”° Similarly, Mr. Campbell testifies that
Canada did not step in when the Incumbents failed to engage in good faith discussions on tower
and site sharing. '°”” As of December 2010, Wind Mobile was not able to negotiate sharing for any
of its 146 towers, and other New entrants faced similar problems. !°78 According to GTH, Canada

627. Third, as discussed in Section (4) above, GTH alleges that Canada treated GTH’s

investment unfairly by conducting the national security review Po

628. Finally, as discussed in Section (3) above, GTH argues that Canada adopted the Transfer
Framework to prevent the sale of Wind Mobile to an Incumbent, despite its earlier assurances that

the spectrum licenses sold in the 2008 Auction had enhanced transferability rights, subject to a

finite five-year restriction on transfer. !°*°

629. In GTH’s view, these actions together “cornered GTH’s investment, leaving GTH with no

rational option but to sell its investment to a non-incumbent for a fraction of its value.” !0*4

630. GTH further argues that these actions constitute “a consistent pattern of contradictory acts
by different arms of the Canadian Government,” in breach of the FET standard. !°85 In particular,
GTH alleges that the Minister of Industry, the CRTC and the Competition Bureau each applied
their mandate to GTH’s investment in contradictory ways that caused damage to GTH.!°%° For
example: (a) both CRTC and Industry Canada reviewed Wind Mobile for compliance with the
O&C Rules and reached opposite results; (b) until 2015, CRTC followed a “forbearance policy”
on the basis that there was sufficient competition in the wireless telecommunications sector,
whereas Industry Canada adopted the Transfer Framework in 2013 in the name of promoting
competition in the market; and (c) Industry Canada’s review under the Transfer Framework

duplicates the role of the Competition Bureau. !°°7

b. Canada’s Position

631. Canada submits that the measures considered together do not constitute a breach of Article

1I(2)(a) of the BIT.

632. Canada’s position is that, to establish a composite or cumulative breach, GTH must show
that the relevant acts “were closely interwoven and pursued the same objective.” !°8* Canada argues
that this requirement is confirmed by each of the authorities cited by GTH.'° However, in
Canada’s view, the measures to which GTH refers are distinct, taken over a period of seven years

by separate State entities pursuing different mandates, and GTH has failed to provide any evidence

that the measures were implemented in a systematic way or aimed at a particular result.!°°°

633. According to Canada, GTH improperly focuses solely on the effect of Canada’s actions on
GTH’s investment. However, Canada asserts that the question of GTH’s losses does not arise until
after GTH has first established a breach of Article II(2)(a); GTH cannot rely on the fact that it was
unable to recover the value of its investment to prove that Canada’s conduct amounted to a breach

of FET.!°!

634. In any event, Canada contends that GTH’s narrative of the events is based on a

637. Second, Canada argues that GTH’s allegations relating to the Government’s
implementation of the roaming and tower/site sharing conditions are untimely, unsupported and
cannot, in any event, contribute to a breach of its FET obligation. 1099 According to Canada, GTH
understood the regulatory framework and proposals relating to roaming and tower/site sharing
before it decided to participate in the 2008 AWS Auction. Canada implemented the exact
conditions of licences it had announced, and GTH cannot now challenge the effectiveness of those

conditions. '!°°

638. Canada asserts that Industry Canada took numerous actions in response to Wind Mobile’s
complaints regarding roaming and tower/site sharing, but that under the established legal
framework it was ultimately for Wind Mobile to resolve the commercial terms of its roaming and
tower/site sharing agreements through arbitration. Canada contends that it cannot be blamed for

GTH’s choice not to use that mechanism, even though some New Entrants did so successfully.

639. Further, Canada argues that it made diligent efforts to help improve the conditions on
roaming and tower/site sharing.'!°! For example, it: (a) launched a public consultation in 2009,

establish a breach of the FET standard. !!°°

640. Canada also denies GTH’s allegation that there was a pattern of inconsistent decision
making by different State entities which constitutes a breach of the FET standard.!!°7 In Canada’s
view, GTH’s position is based on a misunderstanding of the functioning of governments. For
Canada, there is nothing surprising or wrong with different State entities (like Industry Canada,
the CRTC and the Competition Bureau) acting within their respective mandates and legal authority
to arrive at different conclusions.!!°* In any event, Canada argues that its policy objective to
increase competition in the telecommunications sector “remained consistent” during the life of
GTH’s investment, even if “the measures that were considered necessary to achieve it evolved in

response to changing circumstances.” !!

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis

641. In determining the legal standard for a composite/cumulative breach, this Tribunal does
not apply to its review of the evidence a threshold requirement that all of the alleged acts must be
unified by a common purpose of malicious intent by the State as pleaded by Canada.!!!° In line
with the standard set by the Tecmed tribunal, the Tribunal considers that while the acts or omissions
must be something more than a routine exercise of legitimate governmental powers, it is sufficient

that:

The common thread weaving together each act or omission into a single conduct
attributable to the Respondent is not a subjective element or intent, but a converging action

towards the same result, i.e. depriving the investor of its investment, thereby violating the
Agreement.!!!!

642. The success of GTH’s claim depends therefore on its ability to establish, as a matter of
fact, whether the various acts it cites converge toward the same result and, if so, whether those acts

taken together amount to a breach of FET.

643. After reviewing the acts by Canada that, according to GTH, together amount to a breach
of FET, the Tribunal does not find sufficient evidence to establish cumulative or composite breach

by Canada of its obligations under Article II(2)(a) of the BIT.

644. Taking in turn each of Canada’s acts listed by GTH in this head of claim,!!!? the Tribunal
finds that the evidence shows different mandates for Industry Canada and the CRTC, so that their
acts cannot be deemed to be duplicative or repetitive. !!!> Each of those agencies of the Government

acted within its respective authority in conducting separate reviews of Wind Mobile’s corporate

structure and reached a decision concerning the particular agency’s own field of competence.!!!4

Each review was a legitimate exercise of a regulatory power. No inference or breach of the FET

standard may be drawn from the sole fact that the outcome of those reviews was not identical.

645. The Tribunal holds the same view as concerns the allegation of inconsistency between the

CRTC’s decision in 1994 to forbear from regulating wireless telecommunications services
following its determination that “competition was sufficient to protect the interests of users”!!!°
and Industry Canada’s decision to take into account spectrum concentration in the Minister’s

approval of applications for transfer, as set forth in the Transfer Framework in 2013. The different

scope and purpose underlying each of those decisions excludes that inferences of inconsistency be
drawn merely from the fact that they did not yield identical outcomes. Moreover, the Tribunal has
previously found in this Award that there is no evidence that Canada has fundamentally changed

its transferability of spectrum rules so as to frustrate GTH’s legitimate expectations.!!!°

646. As to whether the Canadian Government should have intervened in the wireless market to
require Incumbents to offer more reasonable terms to Wind Mobile in relation to tower and site
sharing, GTH fails to establish the statutory grounds on which the Government could have
interfered in the Incumbents’ rights to negotiate advantageous business deals with New Entrants.
Importantly, the evidence adduced by Canada shows that the CEO of Wind Mobile, Mr. Campbell,
considered the terms of the national roaming agreement agreed with Rogers, an Incumbent, as
being “reasonable.”!!!7 While he described the prices agreed with Rogers as being “slightly higher
than some benchmarks,” he expressed his belief that “we can pass through to consumers with a
small mark up if necessary.”!!!§ As one would expect of a prudent business decision-maker, he
considered the roaming agreement globally and identified advantages that outweighed the price,
namely that “it allows us to ensure that our proposition does not suffer from an ‘inferior coverage’
perspective.”!'' It is difficult to see how this contemporaneous evidence from the person who was
at the helm of GTH’s investment in Canada is consistent with GTH’s subsequent claim that Wind
Mobile failed to obtain the reasonable commercial rates it was expecting, as a result of Canada’s
failed policy.'!?° Nothing on the evidential record warrants an expectation that the Canadian
telecom regulator would interfere in the wireless market to tip in favour of the New Entrant the
balance of business dealings negotiated at arm’s length amongst professionals, specialists of the
relevant sector. This was well summarised at the Hearing by Industry Canada’s then Director

General of the Spectrum Management Operations Branch, Mr. Peter Hill, who testified that:

where a specific issue was brought to our attention, we acted immediately. Where a general
issue was brought to our attention, such as “They’re really being not nice”, it would be very
-- it’s impossible for me to act on that. But we got a lot of those. !!”!

647. As to the rest of Canada’s acts listed by GTH under this head of claim, the Tribunal need
not repeat its findings already made in this Award motivating its dismissal of GTH’s claims of
ee
or refusal by Canada to permit automatic transfer of the set aside licences upon the expiry of the
restriction period.!!?? The important point is that all these acts, when viewed cumulatively, do not
establish the “common thread” that GTH allege to amount to a composite breach of Canada’s
obligations to accord FET to GTH’s investment.!!?3 GTH’s claim in relation to the totality of the

measures taken by Canada breaching the FET treatment obligation is therefore dismissed.

(6) Conclusion on Fair and Equitable Treatment

648. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal holds that GTH has failed to establish that
Canada breached Article II(2)(a) of the BIT. Each of GTH’s FET claims is therefore dismissed.

B. FULL PROTECTION AND SECURITY

649. GTH submits that Canada has breached its obligation to provide full protection and security
(“FPS”) under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT because the Government’s “cumulative action (and
inaction) towards GTH’s investment threatened the commercial and legal security of GTH’s

investment.” !!74

650. Canada submits that this claim must be rejected because the FPS obligation concerns only

physical protection and, in any event, GTH has failed to prove its factual allegations.

651. In the following Sections, the Tribunal first recalls the relevant provision of the BIT, then
addresses the applicable legal standard, and then considers whether GTH has established a breach
of the FPS standard under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.

(dd) Relevant Provision of the BIT

652. Canada’s obligation to provide FPS is set forth in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, which states:

Each Contracting Party shall accord investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party [...] full protection and security.!!7°

(2) Applicable Legal Standard
a. GTH’s Position

653. GTH’s position is that Article II(2)(b) constitutes a “positive obligation on the State to
create and maintain a commercial and legal framework that ensures the security of investments
and protects investments from the adverse actions of third parties or State organs.”!!6 While GTH
acknowledges that this provision does not reflect a strict liability standard, it argues that the host
State must exercise vigilance and due diligence and “take all reasonable measures to protect the

investor against harm.”!!?’ GTH cites Professor Schreuer’s description of the FPS obligation:

[Bly assuming the obligation of full protection and security the host State promises to
provide a factual and legal framework that grants security and to take the measures
necessary to protect the investment against adverse action by private persons as well as
State organs. In particular, this requires the creation of legal remedies against adverse
action affecting the investment and the creation of mechanisms for the effective vindication
of investors’ rights. !!7

654. Contrary to Canada’s position, GTH argues that FPS extends beyond the physical security
of an investment and includes the obligation to ensure an investment’s commercial and legal

security.!'?? To support this interpretation, GTH points to the definition of “investment” in the

1125 CL-001, BIT (English Version), Article II(2)(b).

BIT, which includes intangible assets that are also protected by the FPS provision.'!*° As stated
by the tribunal in Siemens v. Argentina, “[i]t is difficult to understand how the physical security of

an intangible asset would be achieved.”!!3!

655. In GTH’s view, Canada’s interpretation of Article II(2)(b), which would limit FPS to
physical security, ignores “the obvious fact that protection and security can relate to any harm or
injury.”!'*? GTH considers that Canada has failed to show that the ordinary meaning of the terms
“protection” and “security” address only physical harm.''** GTH further argues that those terms
must be read in the context of Article II(2)(b), which appears in an Article that is designed to
“encourage the creation of favourable conditions for investors” and provides protections to achieve
this objective.''*+ For GTH, the artificial addition of a physical component to FPS would be

contrary to that objective.

656. Finally, GTH contends that Canada’s arguments relating to its recent treaty practice support
GTH’s interpretation. According to GTH, the fact that some of Canada’s recent treaties expressly

state that the FPS standard refers only to physical security demonstrates that when States intend to

limit FPS in that way, they do so expressly. !!95

b. Canada’s Position

657. Canada argues that GTH’s interpretation of Article II(2)(b) of the BIT improperly “equates
the standard with an open-ended guarantee of commercial and legal security,” which is not
supported by the text of the BIT or by previous arbitral decisions.!!°°

658. Canada’s position is that the protection guaranteed by Article II(2)(b) of the BIT does not
extend beyond the physical security of investments. According to Canada, this interpretation is
consistent with Article 31 of the VCLT.''*” Canada looks to the Oxford Dictionary to find the
ordinary meaning of the terms “protection” and “security” and concludes that “the phrase
‘protection and security’ refers to safety from physical harm, injury, or impairment.”!!** Further,
Canada argues that the “object and purpose of the FPS standard likewise point to physical safety.”
As observed by several tribunals, the standard was “developed in the context of physical protection
and security of the company’s officials, employees or facilities.”!'*?

659. According to Canada, its interpretation of the standard has been confirmed by most

investment treaty tribunals that have considered the issue, including the tribunals in Crystallex v.

“legal,” and in the treaty at issue in National Grid, the reference to “full protection and security”

was followed by broad language not found in the BIT.!!47

661. Canada further argues that it has confirmed its understanding of the FPS obligation in its

recent treaty practice by including an express reference to physical security or police protection.!!4*

With respect to two of its older treaties that do not include such an express reference, Canada has

clarified the FPS obligation, either by adding a new paragraph or through an interpretive note.!!¥

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis
662. The Parties do not dispute that the FPS standard is independent of the FET standard. The
separate head of treaty-based claim submitted by GTH in relation to the FPS standard reflects the
drafting of each standard in a separate provision in the BIT, with the FET standard provided in

Article II(2)(a) and the FPS standard in Article II(2)(b).

663. The Parties do not dispute either that the FPS standard covers the obligation of the host
State to accord physical protection to the investor, its investments and the investors’ returns.
However, they disagree on whether the FPS duty arising under the BIT reaches beyond physical

protection also to include commercial and legal protection of the investment and the investor’s

returns. !!5°

664. The Tribunal has reviewed the terms of the BIT in accordance with Article 31 of the VCLT

and in light of the authorities adduced by the Parties, and has noted that the terms “protection” and

“security” in Article II(2)(b) are qualified by “full” without any exclusion or limitation. The
Tribunal therefore agrees with GTH that the standard of “full protection and security” as set in the
BIT is not limited to safeguards against physical interference by State organs and private persons,
but extends to accord legal safeguard for the investment and the returns of the investor. In this
respect, the Tribunal agrees with the decisions of several previous investment tribunals. For
example, in CME v. Czech Republic, the tribunal ruled that “[t]he host State is obligated to ensure
that neither by amendment of its laws nor by actions of its administrative bodies is the agreed and
approved security and protection of the foreign investor’s investment withdrawn or devalued.”!!>!

In CSOB v. Slovakia, the tribunal held:

The Slovak Republic’s denial of CSOB’s title to request from the Slovak Republic that SI’s
losses are covered would deprive CSOB from any meaningful protection for its loan and
thus breach the Slovak Republic’s commitment to let CSOB ‘enjoy full protection and
security’ as stated in Article 2(2) BIT.!!>?

665. The tribunal in Azurix v. Argentina was particularly explicit in holding that “full protection
and security was understood to go beyond protection and security ensured by the police. It is not
only a matter of physical security; the stability afforded by a secure investment environment is as
important from an investor’s point of view.” !'** In upholding the same rule, the tribunal in Siemens
v. Argentina drew additional authority from the fact that the relevant treaty, like the BIT in this
arbitration, defined “investment” as applying also to intangible assets in relation to which

“physical” security is difficult to apprehend, ruling:

As a general matter and based on the definition of investment, which includes tangible and
intangible assets, the Tribunal considers that the obligation to provide full protection and
security is wider than ‘physical’ protection and security. It is difficult to understand how
the physical security of an intangible asset would be achieved.!'**

666. Canada’s reference to recent treaty practice limiting FPS to ensuring the physical safety of

1155

the foreign investment shows that, had the Contracting States wished to limit FPS in such a

way, they could have spelled the limitation out in the treaty itself. No such attempt was made in
the BIT. The investors are therefore entitled to the full extent of the unqualified assurance of full
protection and security that each of the two Contracting States has committed in Article II(2)(b) to

accord investments or returns of investors of the other Contracting State.

667. That said, the Tribunal notes that both Parties agree that the obligation of the host State to
accord FPS does not create a strict liability that would dispense with the need for a claimant to
prove that the alleged injury was attributable to the State or its agents.!'°° As stated by the ICJ in
the ELSI case:

The reference. . . to the provision of ‘constant protection and security’ cannot be construed
as the giving of a warranty that property shall never in any circumstances be occupied or
disturbed.'!°”

668. Thus, the standard is that the State must act with “due diligence” to meet its full protection
and security obligation.''** The Tribunal will determine in the following section whether, on the
basis of the facts of the case as pleaded by the Parties, Canada has satisfied the required degree of
vigilance to accord GTH’s investment in Wind Mobile full protection and security in accordance

with Article II(2)(b) of the BIT.

(3) Whether the Respondent Breached its Full Protection and Security Obligation
a. GTH’s Position

669. GTH submits that Canada has breached its FPS obligation in several ways.!!? According

to GTH, Canada not only failed to protect GTH’s investment from harm, but was in fact the “main

culprit” that knowingly caused the damage. !!°

670. Specifically, GTH alleges that Canada breached its FPS obligation in the following ways:

a. Canada subjected GTH to an opaque, arbitrary national security review, during which

Canada failed to inform GTH of any serious charges and did not provide GTH a

meaningful opportunity to respond.!!®!

b. Canada “introduced significant uncertainty to the security of GTH’s investment and the

future of Wind Mobile” by conducting the national security review in a prolonged, non-

transparent way.!!©

c. Canada introduced further legal insecurity for GTH and Wind Mobile when it

introduced the Transfer Framework, thereby changing a key component of the

conditions of the spectrum licenses. !!°

d. Canada’s acts, when viewed cumulatively, dismantled the regulatory framework that

Canada had designed to induce GTH to invest in the Canadian market, and thereby

“destroyed the legal security of GTH’s investment.”!!

b. Canada’s Position

671. Canada argues that GTH’s FPS claim must fail because GTH has not alleged that its

investment suffered any physical harm.!'®

672. Further, even if the Tribunal disagrees with Canada’s interpretation of Article II(2)(b),
Canada’s position is that GTH has failed to establish a breach of the FPS standard. In this regard,
Canada asserts that GTH’s allegations relating to FPS “are essentially based on the same
mischaracterizations as the allegations of breach of the FET standard.”!'® Therefore, Canada

refers to its submissions in connection with GTH’s FET claim.!!®7

673. Canada also raises the following arguments:

a. Contrary to GTH’s position, the Transfer Framework did not fundamentally change or
“effectively dismantle” the legal framework applicable to Wind Mobile’s spectrum

licences. Rather, the Transfer Framework clarified how the Minister would exercise his

existing discretion in relation to spectrum license transfers. |!

b. GTH was well aware of the national security provisions of the ICA when it submitted
the Voting Control Application, and therefore cannot argue that the national security

review deprived its investment of the legal protection and security to which it was

fF and ensured that GTH was accorded due process throughout the

process. N69

c. There is no justification for GTH’s arguments that various distinct measures should be

considered cumulatively to amount to a composite breach of FPS. In addition, GTH’s

complaints about the mandatory roaming and tower/site sharing conditions are based

on a mischaracterization of events.'!”°

674. Thus, Canada concludes that GTH’s claim under Article II(2)(b) of the BIT must be

rejected.

c. The Tribunal’s Analysis
675. The Tribunal has already noted that the standards of FET and of FPS are distinct, as
indicated by the fact that they are set out in two different provisions of the BIT.'!7! It follows that
the host State is subject to different obligations under each of those standards, even if in certain
situations those obligations might overlap. However, the Tribunal can only decide on whether the
State has satisfied its FPS-based obligation of exercising due diligence by examining the specific
facts averred by the Parties. To that end, the Tribunal notes that the facts averred by GTH in support
of its claim of breach of FPS are the same facts that GTH had previously invoked in support of its
claim of breach of FET. As Canada notes, GTH does not advance new allegations. !!77 This is
particularly the case as concerns the allegation that Canada undertook an opaque and arbitrary
national security review of GTH’s Voting Control Application, and the allegation that the
introduction of the Transfer Framework fundamentally changed the terms of Wind Mobile’s

spectrum licences.

676. Considering the above, the main factual findings set out by the Tribunal earlier in this

Award are relevant to GTH’s FPS claim. In particular:

a. The introduction of the Transfer Framework in 2013 was not inconsistent with the
policy documents shared with GTH in advance of the 2008 AWS Auction, and did not

amount to fundamentally change the terms of GTH’s spectrum licenses.

471 See | 663 above.

229

Public Version

b. There is no evidence that the national security review of GTH’s Voting Control
Application was pretextual, or that Canada failed to provide GTH with sufficient

information to respond to Canada’s concerns.

c. Thus, neither the national security review of GTH’s Voting Control Application nor
the Transfer Framework constitutes arbitrary, inconsistent or opaque treatment of

GTH’s investment.

d. GTH has not established its claim that Canada committed a series of acts, including the
national security review and the Transfer Framework, that can be viewed together as a

composite act depriving GTH of its investment.

677. Applying these findings to GTH’s FPS claim, it becomes clear that there is no basis in the
evidential record before this Tribunal to determine that Canada has failed to exercise “due
diligence” with respect to the protection of GTH’s investment. The Tribunal must therefore

dismiss GTH’s FPS claim.

678. For the avoidance of doubt, the Tribunal notes that it has considered each of GTH’s
allegations in the specific context of the FPS standard set forth above, and is not simply repeating

its determination on GTH’s FET claims.

679. The Tribunal’s determination earlier in this Award that neither the national security review
nor the introduction of the Transfer Framework and its alleged impact on the transferability of the
set-aside licenses to incumbents, whether viewed separately or cumulatively, constitutes arbitrary,
inconsistent or opaque acts of Canada applies mutatis mutandis in relation to GTH’s claim of

breach of the FPS standards and leads to its dismissal.

680. In so deciding, the Tribunal is neither applying the FET standard in reviewing the facts
alleged by GTH in support of its FPS claim nor conflating the two separate BIT standards. The
Tribunal reviewed each claim separately in accordance with its own ascribed standard. The

Tribunal has found the following:

230

Public Version

a. The State had no duty to interfere in the negotiation between the New Entrants and the

Incumbents in relation to roaming and tower sharing. !!7

b. The reviews by the competent Canadian authorities of Wind Mobile’s shareholder
structure leading to different outcomes were conducted by separate government

entities, each acting properly within its mandate. |!”

c. The national security review of GTH Voting Control Application was conducted, in its
duration, scope and modalities, in the respect of the investor’s fundamental right to due

process,

1175

d. GTH failed to establish that Canada has fundamentally changed the transferability
terms of the set-aside spectrum licences, where Canada had essentially clarified the
relevance of weighing spectrum concentration in the exercise by the Minister of his

discretion in reviewing an application for transfer to an Incumbent.!!7°

681. It follows that the State’s conduct was consistent with the statutes and regulations made
available to the investor at the time of the investment, and cannot amount to a breach of the FPS

standard under the BIT, just as it did not amount to a breach of the FET standard under that BIT.

(4) Conclusion on Full Protection and Security

682. For the reasons stated above, the Tribunal dismisses GTH’s claim that Canada has breached

Article II(2)(b) of the BIT by failing to provide GTH’s investment full protection and security.

Public Version

Cc. NATIONAL TREATMENT

683. The Tribunal has ruled earlier in this Award that it has no jurisdiction to determine GTH’s
claim that Canada breached its obligation to provide national treatment protection to GTH under

Article IV(1) of the BIT."!77

D. GUARANTEE OF UNRESTRICTED TRANSFER OF INVESTMENTS

684. GTH’s final claim is that Canada breached its obligation to guarantee the unrestricted
transfer of investments under Article [X(1) of the BIT by blocking GTH from transferring Wind

Mobile’s licenses to an Incumbent, which Canada denies.

685. In the following Sections, the Tribunal reproduces the relevant BIT provision, summarizes

the Parties submissions, and then sets out its analysis and conclusion in relation to this claim.

(dd) Relevant Provision of the BIT

686. Article IX(1) of the BIT, under the heading “Transfer of Funds,” provides:

Each Contracting Party shall guarantee to an investor of the other Contracting Party the
unrestricted transfer of investments and returns. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, each Contracting Party shall also guarantee to the investor the unrestricted
transfer of:

(a) funds in repayment of loans related to an investment;
(b) the proceeds of the total or partial liquidation of any investment;

(c) wages and other remuneration accruing to a citizen of the other Contracting Party who
was permitted to work in connection with an investment in the territory of the other
Contracting Party;

4177 See Section VI.D(4) above.

232

687.

688.

Public Version
(d) any compensation owed to an investor by virtue of Articles VII or VIII of the
Agreement. !!78
Canada also refers to paragraphs (2) and (3) of Article IX, which state:

2. Transfers shall be effected without delay in the convertible currency in which the capital
was originally invested or in any other convertible currency agreed by the investor and the
Contracting Party concerned. Unless otherwise agreed by the investor, transfers shall be
made at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer.!!””

3. Notwithstanding paragraphs | and 2, a Contracting Party may prevent a transfer through
the equitable, non-discriminatory and good faith application of its laws relating to:

(a) bankruptcy, insolvency or the protection of the rights of creditors;
(b) issuing, trading or dealing in securities;

(c) criminal or penal offenses;

(d) reports of transfers of currency or other monetary instruments; or
(e) ensuring the satisfaction of judgments in adjudicatory proceedings.

(2) GTH’s Position

In addition to challenging Canada’s Transfer Framework under the FET and the FPS

provisions of the BIT, GTH also challenges the same under Article [IX(1) of the BIT. To that end,

GTH avers that the reference in Article [X(1) to “transfer of investments and returns” should be

read to include the “transfer,” in the meaning of sale, to an Incumbent of GTH’s investment

consisting of “the bundle of rights associated with its indirect shareholding and loans to Wind

Mobile.”!!8°

689.

GTH submits that Article [X(1) is broad and covers the transfer of any “investment” or

“return.”!'8! GTH highlights that the second sentence of the provision expressly states that it

Public Version

should not be read to limit the general principle of free transfer and lists additional types of

transfers that are “also” guaranteed.!!®?

690. GTH asserts that, “[wJhile broad transfer guarantee provisions are uncommon, the ordinary
meaning of this provision is clear” and includes the sale or disposition of investments generally. !!8
According to GTH, the tribunal in Karkey v. Pakistan confirmed that a similarly broad transfer
provision can apply to the free transfer of investments as opposed to funds.!'*+ GTH also cites the

observation of Newcombe and Paradell that:

some IIA provisions appear to apply more generally to restrictions on the investment itself.
For example, Article VII, Canada-Venezuela [BIT] (1996), guarantees to investors ‘the
unrestricted transfer of investments.’ Domestic restrictions on the sale or other disposition
of the investment that prevent the investor from liquidating its investment would appear to
be covered by this type of provision, and not simply the transfer of funds after
liquidation. !!8°

691. GTH considers that this free transfer protection is important to prevent measures that would

result in the “effective[] imprisonment” of an investment.!!8°

692. Therefore, GTH rejects Canada’s position that the application of Article IX(1) is limited to
the transfer of funds from the host State to the investor’s State.!!87 In GTH’s view, Canada’s
interpretation ignores the ordinary meaning of the of Article [X(1) and relies on the “object and
purpose underlying transfer provisions” in general, contrary to the mandate in Article 31 of the
VCLT to consider the text of the BIT.'!88 Further, GTH contends that Canada has neither cited any
authority to support its narrow interpretation, nor distinguished those authorities put forward by
GTH.!!®° More fundamentally, GTH does not accept that there is a basis for Canada’s distinction
between the funds generated by an investment and the core assets making up the investment, which

are both valuable to the investor.!!°

693. According to GTH, its “investment” is “comprised of the bundle of rights associated with
its indirect shareholding and loans to Wind Mobile,” which GTH must be permitted to transfer
without restriction pursuant to Article XI(1).''°! For GTH, it follows that when Canada blocked
GTH’s ability to transfer its investment to an Incumbent after the expiration of the five-year
transfer restriction, Canada violated Article IX(1) so clearly that “the case law simply does not

contain a precedent for such a flagrant breach of the free transfer provision.”!!°?

(3) Canada’s Position

694. Canada submits that GTH’s claim under Article IX(1) must be dismissed because it is
based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the scope of the provision. According to Canada,
Article IX(1) does not apply to restrictions on the sale of assets within Canada; rather, it is limited

to guaranteeing the free transfer of funds between Canada and Egypt.!!°?

695. In Canada’s view, GTH’s expansive reading of Article IX(1) is unsupported by the

ordinary meaning of the terms read in the context of the whole provision.!!°4 Canada recalls that

the terms “investment” and “returns” are both defined in the BIT.'!% Turning to the context,

Canada first notes that the title of Article IX is “Transfer of Funds” and argues that if Canada and

Egypt had intended a broader scope of the provision, they would have reflected it in the title.!!°°

Second, Canada asserts that each of the examples listed in paragraph (1) of Article IX relates to
the movement of funds that result from an investment or asset.!!°’ Third, Canada points out that
paragraph (2) addresses how transfers are to be guaranteed in terms that clearly related to the

movement of funds.!!* Finally, Canada refers to the exceptions in paragraph (3), each of which

could only apply to the movement of funds. !!°?

696. Canada considers that its interpretation is also supported by the purpose of free transfer
provisions, which is to “ensure[] that the foreign investor reaps the benefits or enjoys the fruits of
his or her investment through dividend payments, paying for goods and services, servicing of

debts, or fulfilling other financial obligations.”!7°° For Canada, it follows that the purpose of

Article IX is to protect “cross-border movements of funds related to the investment.” !20!

697. According to Canada, all the arbitral decisions cited by GTH confirm that free transfer

provisions relate to the transfer of funds out of a host State. '?°? In addition, Canada argues that the

Newcombe and Paradell treatise cited by GTH does not discuss the application of transfer
provision to restrictions on the domestic transfer of assets; it merely notes that some transfer

provisions appear to apply to restrictions on liquidation. !?°

698. Moreover, Canada contends that GTH’s interpretation of Article IX(1) “would expand the
provision to an untenable and unworkable standard” !?" that would impede the functions of State

entities carrying out the lawful regulation of domestic commerce and competition. !7°°

699. Applying its interpretation to the present case, Canada submits that GTH’s claim must be
dismissed because the Transfer Framework did not concern GTH’s ability to transfer funds or
returns from its investment.!°° In this regard, Canada recalls that GTH’s stated investment is its
indirect shareholding in, and loans to, Wind Mobile. 1207 Canada considers that its obligation under
Article IX(1) of the BIT in relation to that investment is to guarantee “the transfer of any funds (i)
yielded from disposition or liquidation of its equity or debt interests, or (ii) generated from
operation of its equity or debt interests.”!7°° Canada argues that it complied with that obligation,
as evidenced by the fact that GTH was able to liquidate its equity and debt interests in Wind Mobile

and transfer the proceeds of that sale, even after the Transfer Framework was in place. '?

700. In Canada’s view, Wind Mobile’s spectrum licences are neither an “investment” nor a
“return” of GTH, and therefore, any alleged restriction of the transfer of those licenses does not
fall within the scope of Article IX(1).'?!° Canada cites Rusoro v. Venezuela, in which the claimant
held equity in Venezuelan gold mining companies and argued that an export ban on gold breached

Venezuela’s transfer obligation under the relevant treaty.'?!! The Rusoro tribunal held that the ban

701. Finally, Canada submits that GTH’s claim is based on a mischaracterization of the facts. 1213

Canada denies that it “blocked” the sale of Wind Mobile to an Incumbent, as GTH never requested

a transfer of Wind Mobile’s licences. |?!

(4) The Tribunal’s Analysis and Conclusion

702. The Tribunal finds that GTH’s claim in relation to unrestricted transfers is based on a
misconception of the scope of the term “transfer” in Article IX of the BIT. While it could be argued
that the sale of personal property involves a “transfer” of ownership, this is not the meaning of
“transfer of investments and returns” used in Article [X(1) of the BIT. When interpreting the terms
of Article IX “in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in
their context and in the light of its object and purpose,” as required by Article 31(1) of the VCLT,

the Tribunal notes the reference in Article IX to:

— “transfer of investments and returns,” where the term “returns” is defined in

Article 1(i) as “amounts yielded by an investment”;
— “funds in repayment of loans related to an investment”;
— “the proceeds of the (...) liquidation of any investment”;

— “transfers shall be effected in the convertible currency in which the capital was

originally invested”;

— “transfers shall be made at the rate of exchange applicable on the date of transfer”;

“[eJach Contracting Party shall guarantee to an investor of the other Contracting Party the unrestricted transfer of
investment and returns.” /d., | 566.

Public Version

— “transfer, the returns attributable to investments in the territory of the other Contracting

Party”; and
— the title of Article IX: “Transfer of funds.”

703. All of the terms of Article IX referred to above point towards the construction of the term

'215 or of the

“transfer” as denoting the free movement of the funds invested in the host State,
proceeds of the liquidation of an investment that takes the form of another category of qualifying
asset, and the returns on investment that the investor yielded over the duration of the investment.
Thus, “transfer” includes expatriation outside the host State, whether or not that movement consists
of a repatriation to the investor’s country. In all of those situations, Article IX precludes the host
State from restricting the right of the investor to transfer the amount, proceeds and returns of its
investment out of the host State, for instance by enacting capital or currency controls, subject to

the exceptions listed in Article IX(3).

704. Inso deciding, the Tribunal agrees with Canada’s submission that the purpose of Article IX
is to protect cross-border movements of funds related to the investment. The Tribunal also notes
approvingly Canada’s citation of Dr. Abba Kolo’s summary of the purpose of transfer of funds

provisions in investment treaties, in the following terms:

[T]he ability to transfer funds in and out of the host state ensures that the foreign investor
reaps the benefits or enjoys the fruits of his or her investment through dividend payments,
paying for goods and services, servicing of debts, or fulfilling other financial obligations
that would enhance the value of the investment. '2!6

705. Any remaining doubt on the proper interpretation of “transfer” in Article IX is dispelled by
reading the corresponding term in the authentic French text “transfert? (while French
“transmission” would have been used had the Contracting States meant to refer to the outright sale
of the investment) and the authentic Arabic text “ssa!” (while “gull” or “Sli! Ji” would have
been used had the Contracting States meant to refer to outright sale or to conveyance of property).

Applying the interpretation rule set out in Article 33 of the VCLT, the Tribunal adopts the meaning

'215 Tf the qualifying investment takes the form of money or securities pursuant to Article I(f)(i) and (iii) of the BIT.
1216 RL-320, Abba Kolo, “Transfer of Funds: The Interaction Between the IMF Articles of Agreement and Modern
Investment Treaties: A Comparative Law Perspective,” in Stephan W. Schill, International Investment Law and
Comparative Public Law (Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 346.

239

Public Version

of “transfer” which best reconciles the three authentic texts, having regard to the object and
purpose of the treaty. That meaning is the permission of the free circulation of the funds that consist
in or result from the investment, as opposed to a guarantee of an unrestricted conveyance of

ownership of that investment to an Incumbent at the end of the five-year period.

706. Considering the above, the Tribunal cannot accept GTH’s broad interpretation of
Article IX(1) of the BIT. In the Tribunal’s view, that provision applies exclusively to the transfer

of funds.

707. GTH does not provide any evidence that Canada hampered its ability to freely dispose of
the return of the sale of its investment in Wind Mobile in 2014, whether its indirect shareholding
or loans, including by transferring the proceeds outside Canada or investing them in other assets
in Canada after the Transfer Framework was introduced. Article IX in its true construction offers

no ground to GTH to claim relief. GTH’s claim under Article IX is dismissed.

E. THE TRIBUNAL’S DECISION ON THE MERITS

708. In conclusion, the Tribunal has determined that GTH has failed to establish that Canada
breached any of its obligations set forth in the BIT. The Tribunal therefore dismisses all GTH’s
claims on the merits. As a consequence, there is no need for the Tribunal to consider GTH’s claim

for damages or the Parties’ submissions on quantum.

709. The final matter for determination is the Parties’ respective claims for the costs of the

proceeding, which the Tribunal addresses in the next section.

Vill. COSTS

A. THE PARTIES’ SUBMISSIONS ON COSTS

710. Each of the Parties asks the Tribunal to order the other Party to pay all the costs of the
arbitration, including the cost of legal representation and assistance, the fees and expenses of the

Tribunal, and ICSID’s costs.

(wD GTH’s Submission on Costs

711. GTH submits that the Tribunal has discretion to allocate the costs of the proceeding, and

that the Tribunal should exercise that discretion by awarding GTH its costs.

712. In particular, GTH’s position is that if it were to prevail on the merits, it should be
reimbursed for the costs it incurred over the entire course of this arbitration.'?!’ In GTH’s view,

such an award of costs is required to achieve the Chorz6w principle of full reparation. !'*

713. GTH further argues that, in any event, it should be reimbursed for all the costs incurred as

a result of the following:

a. Canada’s unsuccessful application to bifurcate the proceeding, which necessitated

several rounds of oral and written submission. !7!°

b. Canada’s “ill-supported” objections to jurisdiction and admissibility, including its

“frivolous objection to Claimant’s status as an Egyptian juridical person investor.” !??°

715. GTH also provides a breakdown of these costs by time periods and an estimate of the costs

attributable to defending against Canada’s objections to jurisdiction and admissibility.

(2) Canada’s Submission on Costs

716. Like GTH, Canada submits that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate the costs of
the proceeding. '?”! According to Canada, in deciding the allocation of costs, the Tribunal should
take into account the following factors: (a) the outcome of the proceeding; (b) the relative success
of the parties; (c) the parties’ conduct of the proceeding; (d) the reasonableness of the parties’

costs; and (e) whether the dispute involved complex or novel issues. !??7

717. Applying this standard to the present case, Canada argues that if the Tribunal upholds
Canada’s jurisdictional objections, GTH should bear all Canada’s costs, especially considering

that GTH opposed bifurcation of the preliminary objections. '???

718. In any event, even if the Tribunal were to find jurisdiction over some of the claims, Canada
urges the Tribunal to consider “the serious and legitimate arguments put forward by Canada in its

defence,” and the fact that GTH’s broad claims and ambiguous position regarding which measures

were being challenged increased the costs of Canada’s defense. '?4

719. Canada further submits that GTH took an unreasonable approach to document production

and privilege claims, resulting in unnecessary costs. Therefore, GTH “must bear the parties’ costs

for its unjustifiable privilege assertions and repeated failures to comply with the Tribunal’s
production orders.” 2° Similarly, Canada considers GTH’s approach to damages an unreasonable
departure from accepted damages principles, resulting in a costly exchange that could have been

avoided. !776

720. According to Canada, its costs are reasonable in light of GTH’s approach to the case, which

required Canada to expend significant resources to defend the claims.

721. The following table contains a summary of the fees and expenses Canada incurred from

the filing of GTH’s Notice of Intent in on 27 November 2015 to 31 May 2019:

723. Inaccordance with ICSID Administrative and Financial Regulation 14(3)(d) and paragraph
9.1 of POI, these arbitration costs have been paid out of advance payments made by the Parties in
equal parts (50% by GTH and 50% by Canada). The remaining balance in the case escrow account
will be reimbursed to the Parties in equal parts. As a result, GTH’s share of the arbitration costs

amounts to USD 497,815.37, and Canada’s share also amounts to USD 497,815.37.

Cc. THE TRIBUNAL’S ANALYSIS AND DECISION ON COSTS

724. Both Parties accept that the Tribunal has broad discretion to allocate costs under the BIT
and the ICSID Convention. Specifically, Article XIII(9) of the BIT provides that the “tribunal may
also award costs in accordance with the applicable arbitration rules.” In turn, Article 61(2) of the

ICSID Convention states:

In the case of arbitration proceedings the Tribunal shall, except as the parties otherwise
agree, assess the expenses incurred by the parties in connection with the proceedings, and
shall decide how and by whom those expenses, the fees and expenses of the members of
the Tribunal and the charges for the use of the facilities of the Centre shall be paid. Such
decision shall form part of the award.

Public Version

725. In the exercise of its discretion in matters of allocation of costs, the Tribunal finds it fair
that the Parties bear the costs of the arbitration in equal shares and that each Party bears its own
legal and other costs expended in connection with this arbitration. In reaching this decision, the
Tribunal has considered all the circumstances of the case, including in particular the outcome on
jurisdiction in favour of GTH (but for Canada’s jurisdictional challenge in relation to the national
treatment claim) and on the merits in favour of Canada, the results achieved by each Party during
their protracted dispute in relation to privileged documents, and the fact that GTH’s claims, even
if they did not succeed on the merits, presented genuine issues which could legitimately be brought

before an investment tribunal.

726. Ina final note, the Tribunal notes its high appreciation to counsel for both Parties for their
highly professional, proactive and courteous attitude throughout the proceedings, which was of
great assistance to this Tribunal in fulfilling its duties.

Ix. AWARD

727. For the reasons set forth above, the Tribunal:

728. DECIDES that it has no jurisdiction to entertain GTH’s claim that Canada breached its

national treatment obligations under Article IV(1) of the BIT in respect of GTH’s investment;

729. DECIDES that it has jurisdiction under the BIT and the ICSID Convention to entertain
GTH’s claims that Canada breached the following obligations under the BIT:

(i) The fair and equitable treatment standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT,
(ii) The full protection and security standard in Article II(2)(b) of the BIT, and

(iii) The unrestricted transfer guarantee in Article IX(1) of the BIT;
730. DECIDES that the claims mentioned in paragraph 729 are admissible;

731. DISMISSES GTH’s claims that Canada breached its obligations under the BIT,

specifically:

(i) The fair and equitable treatment standard in Article II(2)(a) of the BIT,

733. ORDERS the Parties to bear the arbitration costs in equal parts;

734. HOLDS that each Party shall bear its legal costs and expenses without contribution by the

other Party; and

735. DISMISSES all other claims or defences by either Party.

Dissenting Opinion of Gary Born

1. T agree in a number of respects with the Tribunal’s factual and legal analysis, and with
many of the conclusions in its Award. I write separately, however, on one issue as to which I
disagree fundamentally with both the Tribunal’s decision and reasoning.

2. Preliminarily, I emphasize my high regard for my colleagues on the Tribunal, and for
the care and diligence with which they have approached this matter, both in the Award and
otherwise. Nonetheless, I am unable to join the Tribunal’s conclusion that GTH’s national
treatment claim is outside the Tribunal’s jurisdiction because it is assertedly excluded from
the scope of the BIT’s national treatment protections by an exception under Article TV(2)(d)
and the Annex to the BIT. In my view, the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article IV(2)(d) on
this issue is impossible to reconcile with either the language of the BIT or the evident object
and purpose of the Treaty. !

I. INTRODUCTION

3. It is important to place interpretation of Article I1V(2)(d) and the Treaty’s Annex in
their proper context under the BIT. Article IV(2)(d) is a piece of a broader set of treaty
provisions addressing the Contracting Parties’ national treatment guarantees and the
exceptions to those protections.

4. Article IV(1) of the BIT guarantees protected foreign investors national treatment:
“Each Contracting Party shall grant to investments or returns of investors of the other
Contracting Party treatment no less favorable than that which, in like circumstances, it grants
to investments or returns of its own investors with respect to the expansion, management,
conduct, operation and sale or disposition of investments.”? It is familiar law that protections
of foreigners against local discrimination, in the form of national treatment guarantees like
Article IV(1), are a bedrock principle of virtually all contemporary investment protection
treaties.>

5. Article IV(1) is subject to several exceptions. In particular, Articles TV(2)(a), (b) and
(c) of the BIT exclude specified non-conforming measures of the Contracting Parties from
the national treatment protections of Article [V(1), while Article [V(2)(d) permits the
Contracting Parties to except future non-conforming measures from Article IV(1). Thus,
Article IV(2) of the BIT provides:

“paragraph (1) of this Article [IV], ... do[es] not apply to:

a. any existing non-conforming measures maintained within the
territory of a Contracting Party; ...

' Terms defined in the Award have the same meaning in this Dissenting Opinion as in the Award.

2 CL-001, BIT (English version), Article IV(1).

3 See, e.g., August Reinisch, National Treatment in BUILDING INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT LAW: THE FIRST 50
YEARS OF ICSID 389 (Kinnear, Fischer, Minguez Almeida, et al. (eds); Dec 2015) (“National treatment is one
of the basic non-discrimination disciplines in international investment law. Almost all bilateral investment
treaties (“BITs”) and multilateral investment agreements contain national treatment provisions requiring
contracting states to provide investors and investments from other contracting parties treatment no less favorable
than that accorded to their own investors and investments.”). See also Consortium R.F.C.C. v.Kingdom of
Morocco, ICSID Case No. ARB/00/6, Award (22 Dec. 2003) (Briner, Cremades, Fadlallah), [ 53 (describing
national treatment as a “disposition qui se rencontre systématiquement dans les traités de protection des
investissements”).

b. the continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming measure
referred to in subparagraph (a);

c. an amendment to any non-conforming measure referred to in
subparagraph (a), to the extent that the amendment does not
decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed immediately
before the amendment, with those obligations;

d. the right of each Contracting Party to make or maintain exceptions
within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.”

6. As its text indicates, Article IV(2) was directed principally towards “existing non-
conforming measures,” which were already in force at the time the BIT was ratified, and the
subsequent continuation, renewal or amendment of such existing measures. Article XVI(1)
of the BIT required the Contracting Parties to the BIT to notify one another, within two years
of the BIT’s entry into force, of all such existing non-conforming measures.* It is common
ground that nothing in Articles IV(2)(a), (b) or (c) exempted new non-conforming measures,
adopted after the date that the Treaty entered into force, from Article IV’s national treatment
guarantees; these provisions were directed exclusively towards existing measures.°

7. In addition, and of direct relevance here, Article [V(2)(d) provides that the Treaty’s
national treatment protections do not apply to “the right of each Contracting Party to make or
maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.” ° In
contrast to Articles IV(2)(a), (b) and (c), Article IV(2)(d) is forward-looking, permitting the
Contracting Parties to “make or maintain exceptions,” within specific sectors identified in the
Annex to the Treaty, in the future (after the signature and ratification of the BIT). In contrast
to Articles IV(2)(a)-(c), Article IV(2)(d) established a mechanism by which the Contracting
Parties could adopt exceptions for new non-conforming measures from the BIT’s national
treatment protections — provided, of course, that the requirements of Article TV(2) and the
Treaty’s Annex were complied with.

8. As contemplated by Article IV(2)(d), Canada listed in the Annex of the Treaty a
number of sectors or matters as to which it reserved the right to make and maintain
exceptions in the future. These sectors were divided by Canada into five general categories,
which included “social services” and “services in any other sector.”’ Specifically, the
relevant part of the Annex provides:

1. In accordance with Article IV, subparagraph 2(d), Canada reserves the right to
make and maintain exceptions in the sectors or matters listed below:

— social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security
or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public
training; health and child care);

the entry into force of this Agreement, exchange letters listing, to the extent possible, any existing measures that
do not conform to the obligations in subparagraph (3)(a) of Article II, Article IV or paragraphs (1) and (2) of
Article V.”).

> That is underscored by Article IV(2)(c) which permitted amendments to existing non-conforming measures,
but only “to the extent that the amendment does not decrease the conformity of the measure, as it existed
immediately before the amendment, with those obligations.” CL-001, BIT (English version), Article 1V(2)(c).

— services in any other sector;
— government securities - as described in SIC 8152;
— residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land;

— measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas
Accords.

2. For the purpose of this Annex, “SIC” means, with respect to Canada, Standard
Industrial Classification numbers as set out in Statistics Canada, Standard Industrial
Classification, fourth edition, 1980.8

9. The Tribunal concludes that these provisions of Article 1V(2)(d), and the Annex,
exclude all of Canada’s challenged measures from Article IV(1)’s national treatment
guarantees. In the Tribunal’s words, ““GTH’s national treatment claim, which relates
exclusively to the telecommunications sector, is excluded from the scope of the BIT’s
national treatment provisions. Accordingly, the national treatment claim is dismissed and
will not be considered on the merits.”°

10. In my view, neither Article TV(2)(d) nor the Annex of the BIT provides a basis for
excluding Canada’s challenged measures from the Treaty’s national treatment protections.
That is true for two separate and independent reasons: (a) Article TV(2)(d) and the Annex
only reserved Canada’s right to make exceptions from Article IV(1)’s protections in specified
sectors, and Canada never exercised that right to make an exception with respect to its
challenged measures; and (b) the sectors listed in the Annex do not, in any event, include the
telecommunications sector, to which Canada’s challenged measures relate.

ll. As a consequence, Canada’s challenged measures are subject to the BIT’s national
treatment protections, and the Tribunal has jurisdiction to consider GTH’s claims. Canada
has not asserted any defense on the merits to those claims and, as a consequence, GTH is
entitled to an award declaring that Canada has breached its obligations under Article IV(1)
and awarding it damages for the losses resulting from that breach.

Il CANADA HAS Not MADE AN EXCEPTION UNDER ARTICLE IV(2)(D) FOR THE
CHALLENGED MEASURES

12. Preliminarily, GTH has challenged three of Canada’s measures under Article TV(1)’s
national treatment protections: (a) Canada’s implementation of a new process to review Wind
Mobile’s foreign ownership and control; (b) Canada’s prohibition of the sale of GTH’s
interest in Wind Mobile to incumbent operators; and (c)

.!° As noted above, it is common ground that Canada has (unusually)
offered no affirmative defense to any of these three claims under Article IV(1).

13. Also preliminarily, it is equally common ground that Canada has done nothing
pursuant to Article IV(2)(d) of the BIT other than to enact and apply the foregoing three
challenged measures. Canada has concededly not provided Egypt any notice or other
statement excepting any of the challenged measures from Article [V(1)’s provisions, whether
pursuant to Article IV(2)(d), the Annex, or otherwise. Canada also has concededly made no

statement, whether publicly, to Egypt, directly to GTH, or otherwise, excepting any of the
challenged measures from Article IV(1)’s national treatment obligation or, for that matter,
referring in any manner to either its challenged measures or to excepted measures under
Article IV(2)(d) or the Annex.

14. Rather, Canada’s position is that it is free to adopt and apply discriminatory measures,
and to take discriminatory actions, at any time, provided only that those measure fall within
the scope of the five categories listed in the Treaty’s Annex. As the Tribunal correctly
observes:

According to Canada, it may make or maintain an exception pursuant to Article
TV(2)(d) at any time by adopting or maintaining measures or by according treatment
that would otherwise be inconsistent with the national treatment obligations; it is not
required to take any additional steps to exercise this right.!!

15. The Tribunal accepts Canada’s claim without qualification. It concludes that Article
TV(2)(d) of the BIT permits Canada to adopt and apply measures, or take other actions, that
violate Article IV’s national treatment guarantee without any prior action or notice. In the
Tribunal’s view, “there is simply no basis in the text of the BIT to impose an additional
procedural requirement that triggers the effectiveness of the exception.”'? In particular, the
Tribunal reasons that “if the Contracting Parties had intended for that right to be subject to
any notification requirement beyond listing the relevant sector or matter in the Annex, they
would have included it in the text of the BIT.”!3

16. The Tribunal’s analysis produces what, in my view, is a very remarkable result —
namely, that the vast bulk of Canada’s obligation to provide non-discriminatory national
treatment under the BIT is almost entirely without any substance or effect. Under the
Tribunal’s analysis, Canada is free, at any time and in any manner, to impose blatantly
discriminatory measures favoring Canadian nationals, in broad sectors of its economy,
without any prior notice to Egypt or Egyptian investors and without any other requirement or
limitation. That result makes the Treaty’s basic promise of non-discriminatory, transparent
treatment of foreign businesses, pursuant to the rule of law, largely illusory. That is a deeply
unattractive result, which contradicts the basic objectives of both the Treaty and international
law more generally.

17. In my view, nothing in the BIT’s text or purposes permits, much less requires, this
remarkable result. Rather, the plain language of the Treaty leaves both Contracting Parties
free, in their sovereign capacities, to except substantial numbers of new measures from the
BIT’s national treatment protections, while mandating that they do so in accordance with an
orderly and transparent process.

18. First, the Tribunal misunderstands the character and meaning of Article IV of the BIT
when it reasons that nothing in the BIT “impose[s] an additional procedural requirement that
triggers the effectiveness” of Article IV(2)(d).'* That reasoning ignores the essential point

that, unless Article IV(2)(d) affirmatively excepts Canada’s challenged measures from

Public Version

Article IV(1)’s national treatment protection, then that protection remains fully applicable.
Inquiry into notification or “additional procedural requirement[s]” is unnecessary if Article
TV(2)(d) and the Annex do not themselves affirmatively exclude Canada’s challenged
measures from the scope of Article IV(1).

19. Regrettably, the Award largely ignores the text of both Article TV(2)(d) and the
Annex. In my view, it is clear from the text of these provisions that they do not except
Canada’s challenged measures from Article IV(1) or otherwise authorize Canada to adopt or
impose the challenged measures. Both of those provisions of the BIT are limited solely to a
reservation of rights by the Contracting Parties to make future exceptions to Article IV(1)’s
obligations, without either exercising those reserved rights or authorizing a Contracting Party
to adopt or apply measures that violate Article [V(1). Thus:

a) Article IV(2)(d) provides a “right of each Contracting Party to make or
maintain exceptions within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex”;

b) In turn, in the Annex, Canada “reserves the right to make and maintain
exceptions” in five specified areas.

20. There can be no serious doubt that the reservation of a right, as permitted by Article
TV(2)(d) and the Annex, is not the actual exercise of that right. As a matter of language,
“reserving a right” is asserting the freedom to exercise (or not to exercise) the reserved right
in the future; it is not the present exercise of the right that has been reserved. To take an
obvious example, if a party reserves the right to initiate an arbitration or litigation, or to
challenge election results, it does not in so doing commence an arbitration or litigation or file
an election challenge; it only preserves, for possible future exercise, an asserted right. On a
more mundane level, if I reserve a seat on a flight, or a table in a restaurant, I do not in so
doing fly to my destination or enjoy a meal; I simply ensure that, if I so choose in the future, I
will not be precluded from doing so.

21. This conclusion requires no legal authority, beyond the plain meaning of Article
TV(2)(d)’s text. In any event, authority uniformly adopts precisely the foregoing
interpretation of a reservation of rights:

a) “[T]he existence of a ‘right’ is distinct from the exercise of that right. For
example, a party may have a contractual right to refer a claim to
arbitration; but there can be no arbitration unless and until that right is
exercised.”!5

b) “[The Energy Charter Treaty] ‘reserves the right’ of each Contracting
Party to deny the advantages of that Part to such an entity. This imports
that, to effect denial, the Contracting Party must exercise the right.”!®

c) “TA reserved right] would only apply if a state invoked that provision to
deny benefits to an investor before a dispute arose.” !”

22. Thus, the text of Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex leave no serious question that neither
provision constituted the actual exercise of any right on the part of Canada to make or
maintain an exception to the BIT’s national treatment protection under Article IV(2)(d).
Rather, Article [V(2)(d) granted Canada (exceptionally) the right to “make or maintain
exceptions” in sectors identified in the Annex, while the Annex identified five specified areas
within which Canada could exercise the right to make exceptions.

23. Critically, nothing in either Article IV(2)(d) nor the Annex then exercised the rights
that Canada had reserved. As noted above, Canada concededly has done nothing pursuant to
Article IV(2)(d) to exercise those rights. That should be an end to the analysis. Nothing in
Article IV(2)(d) nor the Annex does anything beyond making the reservation of a right,
which is not itself sufficient to except Canada’s challenged measures from the BIT’s national
treatment protections.

24. Second, the Tribunal also ignores the nature of the right that Canada is permitted to
reserve, and has reserved, under Article TV(2)(d). Article 1V(2)(d) permits a Contracting
Party to “make or maintain exceptions” within the sectors specified in the Annex.
Importantly, making or maintaining an “exception” is not adopting or imposing a measure;
instead, it is formulating a category of measures to which Article IV(1)’s national treatment
standard will not apply. This conclusion is clear from Article IV(2)(d)’s use of the term
“exception” — that is, a category that is carved out of or excluded from the basic rule!®
prescribed in Article IV(1).

25. The right to make or maintain an exception under Article IV(2)(d) is fundamentally
different from the right to impose measures under Article ITV(2)(a), (b) and (c). Each of
Article IV(2)(a), (b) and (c) excludes from Article [V(1)’s national treatment protection
existing “measures” of the Contracting Parties. Thus, Article 1V(2)(a) excludes “any existing
non-conforming measures maintained within the territory of a Contracting Party,” while
Article IV(2)(b) excludes the “continuation or prompt renewal of any non-conforming
measure,” and Article TV(2)(c) excludes certain “amendment[s] to any non-conforming
measure.” Those provisions specifically addressed “measures” that were already in existence
when the BIT came into force.

26. In contrast, as noted above, Article [V(2)(d) prescribed a mechanism by which each
of the Contracting Parties could, after the BIT came into force, formulate additional
exceptions to Article IV(1)’s requirements. Indeed, in the Tribunal’s own words, “the terms
used (‘reserves the right to make exceptions’) reflect the fact that Article IV(2)(d) is largely
forward looking.”!?

27. Critically, however, the future actions permitted by Article IV(2)(d) are not the
imposition or application of “measures,” as under Articles TV(2)(a)-(c), but are instead the

making of “exceptions.” Needless to say, although the two terms are related, “exceptions”
are not “measures” — which is why Articles IV(2)(a)-(c) and Article [V(2)(d) used different
terms in the same provision of the Treaty.

28. It is elementary that the Tribunal is obliged to give effect to the text that the Parties
have chosen to use in the Treaty.” That includes in particular giving effect to the different
language that the Parties chose to use in Articles IV(2)(a)-(c), on the one hand, and Article
TV(2)(d), on the other hand. Treating the different language of these provisions, and the
different terms “measures” and “exceptions,” as if they were the same thing not only
disregards the Treaty’s language but also violates the basic rule of treaty interpretation (that
requires giving effect to all provisions of a treaty,”! including giving meaning to different
terms).

29. Unsurprisingly, the Treaty’s other provisions also confirm in the clearest of terms this
basic distinction between “measures” and “exceptions.” The Treaty itself defines “measures”
as regulatory and legislative instruments and other governmental or administrative orders or
actions;”* that definition is consistent with the ordinary usage and understanding of the term.
In contrast, the Treaty consistently categorizes and treats “exceptions” in an entirely different
manner, as made clear in the text of Article VI (setting forth specified “Miscellaneous
Exceptions”) and Article XVII (setting forth specified “General Exceptions”). In each of
these provisions of the Treaty, “exceptions” are treated as defined categories of governmental
actions and measures, which are excluded from the rules otherwise prescribed by the Treaty’s
substantive protections, such as those in Article IV(1).”7

30. For example, Article VI set forth exceptions for “Cultural industries,” which are
defined exhaustively as including, inter alia, “the publication, distribution, or sale of books,

magazines, periodicals or newspapers in print or machine readable form but not including the
sole activity of printing or typesetting any of the foregoing; or the production, distribution,
sale or exhibition of film or video recordings ....”*4 Similarly, Article XVII set forth
“General Exceptions,” including “environmental measures,” again carefully defined as
measures “necessary to ensure compliance with laws and regulations that are not inconsistent
with the provisions of this Agreement; necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or
health; ....”

31. Thus, the Treaty’s text and structure make it clear that a “measure” refers to a
Contracting State’s governmental action (whether legislative, executive, administrative)
which is applied to or imposed on a foreign investor, while an “exception” refers to a
category of measures which is excluded from the Treaty’s protections or to a Contracting
State’s exercise of a right under the BIT to exclude categories of measures from the Treaty’s
protections. Importantly, the Treaty’s “exceptions” are defined in advance, as specified
categories of measures, which can be ascertained by reference to the text of the Treaty.
Contrary to the Tribunal’s analysis, the concepts of “measures” and “exceptions” are not
interchangeable, but instead are fundamentally different, both in ordinary usage, in Article 1V
and in the other provisions of the treaty.

32. Applying the Treaty’s definition of “measures” and “exceptions” under Article IV, it
is in my view very clear what Article IV(2)(d) allowed Contracting States to do. Article
TV(2)(d) authorized Contracting States, within limits prescribed by the Annex, to formulate
specified “exceptions” that would encompass defined categories of future “measures” that a
Contracting State might wish to adopt or impose. Critically, however, the making of
exceptions under Article IV(2)(d) and the Annex required the formulation of a defined
category of measures, like the exceptions in Articles VI and XVII of the Treaty, and not
merely an ad hoc, after-the-fact exclusion of any measures within the scope of the Annex
from the Treaty’s protections.

33. The foregoing conclusion is not only evident from the deliberate (and repeated) use of
different language in Article IV(2)(d) (“right to make or maintain exceptions”) and Article
TV(2)(a)-(c) (existing “measures”’), and from the definitions and treatment of “measures” and
“exceptions” in the Treaty. This conclusion is also evident from Canada’s other bilateral
investment treaties. In particular, Canada’s 2004 Model BIT provides that the BIT’s national
treatment obligations “shall not apply to any measure that a Party adopts or maintains” with
respect to defined sectors.> That text, unlike the text of Article IV(2)(d) in the Canada-
Egypt BIT, does not provide for Contracting Parties to make “exceptions” for future
“measures,” but instead simply excludes from the BIT’s coverage all future “measures” in
particular fields. The terms of Canada’s 2004 Model BIT confirm both the plain language of
Article IV(2)(d) and the difference in the text of Article IV(2)(d) and Articles IV(2)(a)-(c).

34. The same conclusion is also apparent from the structure of the BIT. Articles TV(2)(a)-
(c) refer to existing measures, which could be (and, under Article XVI(1), must be) identified
at the time the Treaty was ratified, and which are then excluded from Article IV(1). Article
TV(2)(d) refers to future measures, which were not yet (and could not be) identified at the
time the Treaty was ratified, but which could nonetheless be excluded from Article IV(1).
Because these measures could not be identified, the Contracting Parties provided a
mechanism in Article IV(2)(d) to allow for exceptions to be made, within limits prescribed in

2 CL-001, BIT (English version), Article VI(3).

the Annex, from Article IV(1)’s national treatment protection for as-yet-unidentified
measures.

35. In doing so, however, the Contracting Parties did not simply exclude economic
sectors or types of measures from the scope or application of Article IV(1). Instead, the
Contracting Parties limited the fields within which future non-conforming measures might be
excepted from Article [V(1), by requiring that these fields be identified in an Annex; and they
provided for the Contracting Parties to then “make exceptions” within those fields, not for the
Contracting Parties to simply impose non-conforming measures. That structure confirms
both the different language of Article IV(2)(d) (referring to “exceptions,” not to ““measures”’)
and the text of the Annex (referring to the “reservation of a right” to make exceptions, not a
right to impose measures).

36. One could imagine treaty language that had the meaning adopted by the Tribunal with
respect to Article IV(2)(d); that text would not, however, be what Article IV(2)(d) or the
Annex actually says. Instead, adopting the Tribunal’s interpretation of the BIT, Article
TV(2)(d) would say “notwithstanding Article IV(1), each Contracting State has the right to
adopt, maintain, amend and impose measures in the sectors listed in the Annex” which do not
conform to Article [V(1), and the Annex would say “Article IV(1) does not apply to any
measures of Canada in the following sectors.” Needless to say, nothing in Article IV
remotely resembles such a provision.

37. Third, given the clarity of Article IV(2)(d)’s language and structure, there is little
need to consider the BIT’s object and purpose. For the avoidance of doubt, however, those
purposes decisively confirm what the Treaty’s text says. In particular, the BIT’s fundamental
objective of providing a secure, predictable and transparent environment, characterized by the
tule of law, both argues for the conclusions outlined above and excludes the interpretation
urged by Canada and adopted by the Tribunal.

38. Under the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article IV, the BIT’s fundamental guarantee of
national treatment is subject to an open-ended, entirely discretionary power on the part of
Canada to disregard the Treaty’s protection. In what appears to encompass some 70 percent
of Canada’s economy,”° Canada is free under the Tribunal’s interpretation of the Treaty —
without notice or restriction — to impose discriminatory measures. As noted above, this is a
remarkable, and remarkably unattractive, result. That unbounded discretion is little different
from a self-judging exception to the Treaty’s national treatment obligation, which is contrary
to both the rule of law and the BIT’s fundamental objectives, and entirely different from the
manner in which “exceptions” were treated elsewhere in the Treaty (in Articles VI and
XVII). Indeed, that sort of sweeping discretionary power to discriminate on an ad hoc basis
against foreigners is almost the exact opposite of what the BIT promised and sought to
achieve.

39. In contrast, reading the BIT to mean what Article IV says does nothing to limit the
Contracting States’ sovereign regulatory authority. Canada would remain free to adopt
exceptions, pursuant to Article [V(2)(d), from Article IV(1)’s national treatment protection
(within the limits of the Annex); Canada would merely be required to formulate and publicize
those exceptions in advance, as it did in Articles VI and XVII, so that other Contracting
Parties and foreign investors could determine when Article [V(1) applied and when it did not.

That is precisely the type of transparency, regularity and legal security that both the BIT and
the rule of law promise — but that the Tribunal, regrettably, declines to affirm.

40. Fourth, Canada and the Tribunal also rely on Article XVI(1) of the BIT, which sets
out a process by which the Contracting Parties are to notify one another of any existing non-
conforming measures,’ while observing that there is no such process prescribed by Article
XVI for exercising the right granted by Article IV(2)(d).

41. That analysis is in my view entirely unpersuasive. Article XVI(1) specifically
addresses only “existing” non-conforming measures. The point of Article XVI(1) is not to
provide a general notice mechanism for issues that arise under the BIT in the future, after the
Treaty is in force — rather, it has a limited purpose pertaining to “existing” measures.

42. For the reasons discussed above, the reason that Article IV(1) was drafted to apply
specifically to Articles [V(2)(a)-(c), and not Article IV(2)(d), is that Article TV(2)(d) itself
requires the Contracting States to formulate and make “exceptions” to Article IV(1) —
namely, publicly available instruments defining what categories of future measures would,
and would not, be excepted from Article IV(1)’s national treatment requirement. It would
have made no sense to extend Article XVI(1)’s requirement for notice of “measures” to the
very different “exceptions” under Article TV(2)(d).

43. Article XVI of the BIT is also instructive of something else: the intention of the
Contracting Parties to clearly identify and communicate measures that would hinder the
protection of foreign investment. In addition to the requirement in Article XVI(1) of
exchanging letters about existing measures that do not conform to the BIT obligations,
Article XVI(2) provides that each party must “ensure that its laws, regulations, procedures,
and administrative rulings of general application respecting any matter covered by this
Agreement are promptly published or otherwise made available in such a manner as to enable
interested persons and the other Contracting Party to become acquainted with them.”?*

44. Article XVI thus seeks to ensure that both Contracting Parties, and their respective
investors, are at all times aware of developments that would affect the rights and obligations
established by the BIT. Unlike Article XVI(1), Article XVI(2) lacks the word “existing,”
making clear that such notice is necessary for all present and future measures. This is
consistent with the overarching purpose of the BIT to facilitate “economic cooperation” by
“the promotion and the protection of investments of ... the other Contracting Party.””? Read
in this context, the exercise of a reserved right under Article IV(2)(d) necessarily required
notifying the other Party. As the Tribunal acknowledges, the language of the Annex which is
at issue — “services in any other sector” — is exceptionally broad.*°

45. Finally, the Tribunal laments that the Annex “could have been drafted in clearer
terms.”*! With respect, Article IV(2)(d), Article XV1(1) and the Annex were drafted in

27 CL-001, BIT (English version), Article XVI(1). As noted above, the article provides that “The Contracting
Parties shall, within a two year period after the entry into force of this Agreement, exchange letters listing, to the
extent possible, any existing measures that do not conform to the obligations in subparagraph (3)(a) of Article II,
Article IV or paragraphs (1) and (2) of Article V.”

perfectly clear terms. Particularly when read together, in light of the BIT’s object and
purpose, these provisions impose clear and sensible rights and obligations. Again regrettably,
the Tribunal chooses not to give effect to those provisions. Notably, however, if one
accepted the Tribunal’s view that the Annex and the BIT are unclear, then it underscores all
the more the need to interpret Article TV(2)(d) and the Annex consistently with the Treaty’s
object and purpose and the desirability of avoiding the remarkably unattractive and
implausible result produced by the Tribunal’s analysis.

Til. THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS NOT AN EXCEPTION UNDER THE ANNEX

46. Even if Article [V(2)(d) had the meaning urged by the Tribunal, its conclusion would
still be wrong. Even accepting the Tribunal’s interpretation of Article IV(2)(d), Canada did
not reserve the right to impose non-conforming measures with respect to investments made in
telecommunications. In my view, the Tribunal is wrong to conclude that the exceptions to
national treatment protection contained in Article [V(2)(d) and the related Annex encompass
the telecommunications sector.

47. As discussed above, an exception can only be made pursuant to Article IV(2)(d)
“within the sectors or matters listed in the Annex to this Agreement.”*? In turn, the relevant
provisions of the Annex read as follows:

1. In accordance with Article IV, subparagraph 2(d), Canada reserves the right to
make and maintain exceptions in the sectors or matters listed below:

— social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income security
or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education; public
training; health and child care);

— services in any other sector;
— government securities - as described in SIC 8152;
— residency requirements for ownership of oceanfront land;

— measures implementing the Northwest Territories and the Yukon Oil and Gas
Accords. *

48. It is common ground that Canada can only make an exception under Article IV(2)(d)
if that exception falls within one of the “sectors or matters” listed in the Annex to the BIT.
Article IV(2)(d) was not an unbounded right to make exceptions for future measures in any
and all areas — but only within those sectors specified in advance in the BIT’s Annex.

49. The Tribunal concludes that the Annex’s “language leaves no room for doubt that
Canada has the right to make exceptions to its national treatment obligation with respect to
services”* as it is the only “plausible” explanation.*> In the Tribunal’s view,
telecommunications is a “service,” and as a consequence Canada’s challenged measures,
applied to a telecommunications company, fall within the Annex. The Award also finds
instructive the fact that Canada has contained similar exceptions for services in other

investment treaties, and that GTH’s own description of Wind Mobile’s activities includes
“providing mobile telecommunications services to Canadian customers.”*°

50. Preliminary, the Tribunal’s (and Canada’s) interpretation of the Annex is again
remarkable. In the Tribunal’s view, the term “services in any other sector” means any
services sector or any sector in which services are provided. As a consequence,
telecommunications are a services sector (as presumably would be the case for information
technology, health care, finance, advertising, insurance, transport, energy and other fields
comprising some 70% of Canada’s economy).*” In my view, that interpretation again ignores
the plain language of the BIT and produces a result that is antithetical to the BIT’s object and
purpose.

Sl. First, the Annex does not permit exceptions in any services sector; instead, the Annex
permits exceptions to be made for measures regulating “services in any other sector.” The
Annex allows exceptions for the regulation of “services” in a given sector, not the regulation
of anything in a sector that involves services. Here, there is no suggestion that Canada’s
review of the shareholding of telecommunications (and other) investments was a regulation
of “services”: it obviously was not, and was, equally obviously, a regulation of financial
holdings and corporate control. Nothing in the Annex purports to except future measures of
that nature.

52. Second, the Annex also does not permit exceptions for measures regulating all
services. It only encompasses a defined category of services — namely, “services in any other
sector.” Critically, the Tribunal (and Canada) ignore the phrase “any other sector,” which
has a readily-ascertainable and important meaning.

53. The Annex’s reference to “any other sector” immediately follows the Annex’s
reference to:

“social services (i.e. public law enforcement; correctional services; income
security or insurance; social security or insurance; social welfare; public education;
public training; health and child care).”**

54. In this context, the most natural reading of the Annex is that services in “any other
sector” is a reference to other “social services” in sectors not already specified in the
parenthetical in the above quoted text of the Annex. That is what the reference to “other
sectors” is most plainly construed to mean, and in the context of the Annex, that is the better
reading of the reference to “services.”

55. Notably, the Annex does not say “any services,” or “any sector in which services are
provided,” or “financial, legal, accounting, consulting, telecommunications and any other
services.” Rather, the Annex includes, after a reference to social services in several specified
sectors (notably, preceded by an “i.e.,” not an “e.g.,”), a reference to “services in any other
sector.” In context, that reference must be to “services” in other sectors in addition to those
already specified, but without any change from a focus on “services” and, specifically, on
“social services.”

56. And, as already discussed, Canada’s challenged measures are regulations of neither
“services,” much less “social services,” in any sector. Critically, Canada’s challenged
measures are a regulation of investment and ownership/control in the telecommunications
sector. Those measures are not a regulation of “services,” and are most decidedly not a
regulation of “social services.” They are a regulation of financial ownership and corporate
control, which has nothing to do with the items listed in the Annex.

57. Third, the Tribunal’s reading of the language of the Annex would also make the first
of Canada’s listed sectors (“social services”) superfluous: if the second sub-paragraph really
did refer generically to all services in any sector, then the first sub-paragraph would be
entirely subsumed within it, and therefore would have no independent meaning. The rule of
non-redundancy is a fundamental tenet of treaty interpretation in international law*? — it
requires a treaty to be interpreted “in such a way that a reason and a meaning can be
attributed to every part of the text.’“° In other words, the reading should not reduce a clause
to redundancy or inutility. Applied to our case, understanding the second element of the
Annex (“services in any other sector”) to refer to “social services in any other sector” is the
only way to prevent the first element, “social services,” from becoming meaningless.

58. Moreover, the first sub-paragraph of the Annex provides in parentheses more detail
about sectors that were considered to involve the provision of “social services”: public law
enforcement; correctional services; income security or insurance; social security or insurance;
social welfare; public education; public training; and health and child care.*! A natural
understanding of the language that immediately follows this provision, in the second sub-
paragraph, then, is that “social services” are not limited to the sectors indicated in
parentheses, but rather capture other sectors as well.

 

59. Fourth, the Tribunal acknowledges, with some understatement, that “the breadth of
the category ‘services in any other sector’ might seem surprising”*? given the Tribunal’s
interpretation. That is true. The breadth of this category — apparently encompassing some
70% of Canada’s economy - is particularly striking when contrasted with the narrow
character of the sectors identified in the Annex’s first sub-paragraph (i.e. “public law
enforcement” (but not private law enforcement), “correctional services, and “public
education” (again, not private education)). It is very odd to think that the drafters of these
limited and narrow categories, also intended to make all these limitations redundant and
meaningless by way of a passing reference to “services” generally. Despite that, the

Tribunal’s position is that the Annex (silently and secondarily) includes finance,
telecommunications, insurance, information technology, energy and the like.

60. The Tribunal dismisses this implausible reading of the Annex with a reference to
“many of Canada’s investment treaties from the mid to late 1990s, which contain similar
exceptions for services.”*? The Tribunal cites bilateral investment treaties between Canada
and nine other states that Canada has identified.*4 The comparable Annex in all but one of
these agreements is identical to that in the Canada-Egypt BIT, leading the Tribunal to
conclude that these treaties support both its interpretation of the Annex and the breadth of the
“services in any other sector” formulation.

61. The Tribunal’s analysis is unconvincing. The fact that other bilateral investment
treaties have language like that in the BIT’s Annex merely means that those treaties also raise
comparable issues of interpretation (which are not before this Tribunal and which other
tribunals have not addressed); that fact says nothing whatsoever about how those issues of
interpretation should ultimately be resolved.

62. More important, in my view, are treaties concluded at almost the same time as the
Canada-Egypt BIT with texts that shed light on what the BIT’s Annex was understood to
mean. Specifically, the Canada-Thailand BIT, signed in 1997, does not have the language
“services in any other sector” in its Annex, while the Kingdom of Thailand reserves the right
to make and maintain exceptions in “business in services, i.e., accountancy, attorneyship,
architecture, advertisement, brokerage or agency, auction, haircutting, hair dressing, and
beauty treatment.”*> Similarly, the Canada-Philippines BIT contains an exception from the
Philippines for “services involving the practice of licensed profession.” *°

63. In other words, at the same time the Canada-Egypt BIT was concluded, texts that
Canada negotiated described with some detail, and in a very limited manner, the industries
that would fall under the “services” exception. That does not support, and instead
contradicts, the Tribunal’s view that the Annex contained very broad services exceptions (and
was part of a consistent Canadian practice of including such exceptions); instead, at the most
relevant times, Canada’s bilateral investment treaties had the reverse.

64. Moreover, the Tribunal ignores the fact that Canada has specifically identified
“telecommunications services” as an exception in other bilateral investment treaties.*”
Canada argues that these treaties reveal an “evolution in the architecture of” foreign
investment protection agreements,** but the more persuasive inference would be that if
Canada had meant to reserve the right to make exceptions in the telecommunications sector,
it would have done so expressly, as in other treaties.

65. The Tribunal also acknowledges that “the reference to ‘services in any other sector’
must be read in the context of the four other listed items.”*? As the Tribunal notes, the
language of the last three exceptions in the Annex is detailed and precise.*” Likewise, the
first exception, for “social services,” is elaboratively defined in parentheses.*! Like Canada’s
other bilateral investments treaties, these provisions all suggest a focused and limited, rather
than open-ended, approach towards exceptions. In turn, that indicates that the category
“services in any other sector” should be interpreted in light of the other listed items in the
Annex, giving it a more definite meaning in association with “social services.”

66. Finally, even if one accepts Canada’s position that “services in any other sector”
means “any services sector,” the Annex expressly categorizes telecommunications as a non-
services sector in J 2. The sole — and sufficient — guidance in the Annex for identifying a
services industry is Statistics Canada’s Standard Industrial Classification (“SIC”).*?
According to SIC, telecommunications is not a “services” industry; rather, it falls under
“communications and other utilities.”*? While the telecommunications business may indeed
be concerned with the provision of services, the definition in the Annex must control.

67. The Tribunal contends that reliance on the SIC is “misplaced because it is referenced
in the BIT only with respect to government securities and not any other services.”°* This
analysis ignores the plain language of the BIT: { 2 of the Annex states that “[f]or the purpose
of this Annex, SIC means....”°> The Annex does not provide that use of the SIC is limited to
the government securities reference — for instance, “for the purpose of government
securities,” or “for the purpose of the third item under Annex (1).” Paragraph 2’s reference to
the SIC is clear and unambiguous, and, in turn, the SIC plainly excludes telecommunications.
