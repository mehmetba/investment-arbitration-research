UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA

Case No. 21-cv-21796-BLOOM/Otazo-Reyes

DOMINICANA RENOVABLES, S.L.,

Petitioner,

v.

THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC,
Respondent.

/

ORDER ADOPTING MAGISTRATE JUDGE’S
REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

THIS CAUSE is before the Court upon Dominicana Renovables, S.L.’s (“Petitioner”)
Petition to Confirm in Part and Set Aside in Part Arbitral Award, ECF No. [1] (“Petition”), and
The Dominican Republic’s (“Respondent”) Cross-Motion to Confirm Arbitration Award in its
Entirety, ECF No. [24] (“Cross-Motion”). The Petition and Cross-Motion were previously referred
to the Honorable Magistrate Judge Alicia M. Otazo-Reyes for a Report and Recommendations
(“R&R”). See ECF No. [30]. On February 12, 2022, Judge Otazo-Reyes issued a R&R
recommending that the Petition be denied, the Cross-Motion be granted, and the Court confirm the
Arbitration Award in its entirety. ECF No. [46]. The R&R states that the parties shall file any
objections within fourteen days of the date of service of a copy of the R&R. Id. at 11. To date,
neither party has filed objections, nor have they sought additional time in which to do so.

Nevertheless, the Court has conducted a de novo review of Judge Otazo-Reyes’s R&R and
the record in this case and is otherwise fully advised in the premises. See Williams v. McNeil, 557
F.3d 1287, 1291 (11th Cir. 2009) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)). Upon review, the Court finds the

R&R to be well reasoned and correct. The Court therefore agrees with the analysis in Judge Otazo-
