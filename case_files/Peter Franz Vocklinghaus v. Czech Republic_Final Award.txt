Protection of Investments of 2 October 1990 (“the Treaty”).2

7. Article 10 provides that:

“(1) Disputes between either Contracting Party and an investor of the other
Contracting Party regarding investments shall, as far as possible, be settled
amicably between the parties to the dispute.

(2) If the dispute cannot be settled within six months from the date on which it
was officially raised by either party to the dispute, it shall, at the request of the
investors (sic) of the other Contracting Party, be submitted for arbitration. In the
absence of any other arrangement between the parties to the dispute, the
provisions of article 9, paragraphs 3 to 5 [of the Treaty] shall apply mutatis
mutandis, subject to the proviso that the members of the arbitral tribunal shall be
appointed by the parties to the dispute in accordance with the provisions of article
9, paragraph 3, and that, if the time-limits provided for in article 9, paragraph 3,
are not observed, either party to the dispute may, in the absence of any other

Chamber of Commerce to make the necessary appointments. The award shall be
recognized and enforced under the Convention of 10 June 1958 on the Recognition
and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards,

(3) — The Contracting Party which is a party to the dispute shall not in the course

on the grounds that the investor who is the other party to the dispute has already
received compensation for all or part of his losses under an insurance policy.”

1The Treaty was made in the German and Czech languages. For the purposes of
this Arbitration, the Parties and the Tribunal have relied upon the official English

D, THEARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS

11, The arbitration proceedings were initiated by Notice of Arbitration issued
by PVon 7 October 2009.

12, Following the constitution of the Tribunal (see Section C above), the
Tribunal wrote to the Parties on 28 January 2010, noting that it was constituted
as an ‘ad hoc’ tribunal pursuant to the terms of Article 10 of the Treaty. The
Tribunal further proposed that the place of arbitration be Paris, France. While it
acknowledged that the Parties had not yet determined whether to adopt the
UNCITRAL Rules of Arbitration, with or without modification, it drew their

6

 

 

attention, too, to the List of Matters for Possible Consideration in Organizing
Arbitral Proceedings, which form part of the UNCITRAL Notes on Organizing
Arbitral Proceedings, Counsel for both Parties were invited to submit their
comments upon these and other points of procedure by 5 February 2010 (PY)
and 19 February 2010 (the Czech Republic) - as they duly did,

13. On the basis of those responses, the Tribunal made certain Preliminary
Directions on 24 February 2010. It fixed Paris as the place of the arbitration and,
by agreement of the Parties, it confirmed English as the language of the
arbitration. The Tribunal further noted the obligation, incumbent upon the
Parties and the Tribunal, to keep the proceedings confidential, save to the extent
that disclosure might be required of a Party by reason of a legal duty to protect
or pursue a legal right or to enforce or challenge an award in bona fide legal
proceedings before a state court or other judicial authority.

14, The Tribunal also proposed a preliminary meeting with the Parties
(see paragraph 15 below) and directed the payment of initial advances on costs
to be held by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague.

15. PV, representatives of the Czech Republic, the Parties’ legal
representatives and the Tribunal met in Paris on 11 March 2010. Minutes of the
Meeting and the Tribunal’s Procedural Order No.1 were issued on 13 March
2010. As the Minutes make clear, the Parties agreed upon a departure from the
provisions of Article 9(S) of the Treaty (which are incorporated by reference in
Article 10(2)) and which provide that:

“ww. Each Contracting Party shall bear the costs of its own member [of the
Tribunal] and of its legal representation in the arbitration. The costs ‘of the
chairman and any other costs shall be shared equally between the two Contracting
Parties, The tribunal may determine a different allocation of costs. ...”

Instead, the advances to be made in respect of fees and expenses of all three
members of the Tribunal were to be shared equally between the Parties pending
a determination by the Tribunal as to the final allocation of such fees and

expenses,

16. Pursuant to the timetable fixed in the course of the Preliminary Meeting,
the following submissions were to be made by the Parties. To the extent that the
actual dates of the submissions differ from those envisaged at the Preliminary
Meeting, the latter are shown in brackets.
: PV's full Statement of Claim, save for details of the quantum of any
asserted claim for damages?, together with all of the documents and the

? At the time of the Preliminary Meeting, provision was made for the raising of an
Objection to Jurisdiction by the Czech Republic by 2 July 2010, some three weeks
after the submission of the Statement of Claim. In the event that no Objection to
Jurisdiction was raised by 2 July 2010, PV was to supplement his Statement of
Claim with details of the quantum of his claims, together with the documentary
evidence and any expert’s report upon which he relied, by 10 September 2010.
By letter from its Counsel, DLA Piper, dated 2 July 2010, the Czech Republic
confirmed that it did not seek to object to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal as a

7

Supplementary Statement of Claim: 10 September 2010

- Answer to all of PV’s liability and quantum claims, together with all
documents, all statements of witnesses of fact and any expert's report
upon which the Czech Republic relied, and to the extent that they had not
already been the subject of a Request to Produce, a Request to Produce in
conformity with Article 3(3) of the IBA Rules on the Taking of Evidence in
International Commercial Arbitration (“the IBA Rules of Evidence”)
(actually described as “Statement of Defense”): 23 December 2010.
(10 December 2010). (Resubmitted 30 March 2011)

report(s) served by PV: 25 March 2021 (11 March 2011).
(Resubmitted 30 March 2011).

17. PV filed testimony from:
PV himself: 18 June 2010; 21 August 2010; 13 January 2011; and

26 January 2018

24 March 2011).

 

19. In light of the history of document disclosure in this Arbitration, the
Tribunal draws specific attention to jts direction no.17, contained in Procedural

Order No.1, to the effect that:
“(SJave in exceptional circumstances, and then only with leave of the Tribunal, no
new documentary or other material shall be introduced into the Arbitration record

after 11 March 2011,”

preliminary matter, but it reserved its right to do so in its Statement of Defense
in due course.

 

   

 

20. The Tribunal subsequently issued the following further Procedural
Orders:
: Procedural Order No.2, 18 August 2010, supplemented on
19 August 2010: (in respectvof the’Czech Republic's First Request for
Information/Documents of 10 August 2010 and ancillary applications);
: Procedural Order No.3, 5 October 2010: (P.0.3 dealt, inter alia,
with then outstanding disclosure issues arising out of the Czech

translation into English of ali documents to which the Tribunal’s attention
‘was to be drawn; documents to which reference was made in the Expert
Report of Mr Sima);
- Procedural Order No,4, 2 November 2010. The Tribunal refused
the Czech Republic's applications that it should at that stage draw any
adverse inferences in respect of any asserted failure by PV to comply with
the Czech Republic’s First and Second Requests for
Information/Documents; it afforded PV the opportunity to complete his
submission of documents referred to or relied upon in the Sima report in
support of PV's quantum claim by 25 October 2010, pursuant to PV's
Counsel’s application of 21 October 2010; the Tribunal extended time for
service of the Czech Republic's Answer until 24 December 2010, with
consequential adjustments to the dates of submission of PV’s Reply and
the Czech Republic’s rejoinder to 4 February 2011 and 18 March 2011
respectively; it confirmed the hearing dates (4-8 April 2011); and it stated
that: “the final date for admission of any new materials into the arbitration
record pursuant to paragraph 17 of P.O, No.1 shall be amended to
Friday 18 March 2011.’;
- Procedural Order No.5, 26 March 2011. The Tribunal denied PV's
application of 18 March 2011 to adduce additional direct testimony from
{a further application in respect of Mr was
vharawa) and a similar application made on 24 March 2011 in respect
of Dr it further denied PV’s application to admit into the
evidentiary record Exhibits CE156-CE214 inclusive; it upheld the Czech
Republic’s objection to the appearance of Mr to
supplement the expert evidence of Mr Sima; and the Tribunal granted PV
until] 28 March 2011 to make any further application that he might be
advised to make in respect of his First Request for Production of
Information and Documents, Finally, the Tribunal confirmed
arrangements for the Hearing and indicated its inclination, subject to
further consultation with the Parties, to invite an exchange of Post-
Hearing Briefs on 29 Apri) 2011;
- Procedural Order No.6, 30 March 2011. The Tribunal denied
Claimant's further submission,dated 28 March 2011 in respect of his First
Request for Production of Information and Documents;

Procedural Order No.7, 15 June 2011. The Tribunal excluded three
additional Exhibits filed with Claimant's Post- Hearing Brief and invited
Respondent's Counsel to submit a marked-up version of Claimant’s Post-
Hearing Brief to Claimant's Counsel, setting out the revisions that

9

 

 

Respondent required Claimant to make consequent upon those deletions.
(Claimant made no comment upon the mark-up, which was subsequently

submitted to the Tribunal on 24 June 2011).

21, The Hearing in this Arbitration took place at the ICC Hearing Centre, 112,
avenue Kleber, 75016 Paris, France over 5 days between 4 and 8 April 2011. In

respective Costs submissions were filed on 28 June 2011 and 7 july 2011 (PV)
and 28 June 2011 (the Czech Republic).

E. INTRODUCTION

23, This dispute arises out of the development and construction of a golf
course and resort project at Cihelny in the Czech Republic. The centrepiece of the
project was to be a ‘signature’ 18 hole golf course, designed by the Gary Player
Design Company. It is common ground that the European championship was
hosted at Cihelny in 2002. .

24. PV claims that he provided some Czech Crowns (“Cr.”) 251,196,071
funding? for the initial phase of the project from late 1994 onwards to the
project's corporate vehicle, KOMFORT VP Cihelny spol, s.r.o., ("KOMFORT’), of
which PV owned 50% and his business partner and fellow Executive and
corporate proxy, Mr ) owned the remaining 50%.

25. PV states that he made an investment susceptible to the protections
afforded by the provisions of the Treaty. That investment constituted his taking
of an ownership interest in KOMFORT and receivables in respect of loans made
to KOMFORT.*

26. PV asserts that KOMFORT was unlawfully declared bankrupt by the
Regional Court in Pilsen on 16 October 2001, The declaration of KOMFORT's
bankruptcy; the appointment of 3 Princova a.s. ("3 Princova”) (see paragraph 27
below) as Creditors’ Representative; the subsequent sale of the assets of
KOMFORT by the Bankruptcy Trustee, Dr 1, at what PV contends was a
material undervalue to the highest bidder in the public tender, (PV's counsel,
Dr Sekanina, submitted that the Cihelny course was; “fully operational at the time
,

3 Exhibit JB298
4 Statement of Claim, para.12
10

 

 

of expropriation”’); and the deletion thereafter of KOMFORT from the
Commercial Registry were acts which constituted violations of Articles 2(1),
2(2), 4(1) and 4{2) of the Treaty by the Czech Republic.®

27. The eventual purchaser of the Golf Resort was Astoria Invest s.r.o.
(“Astoria”). Astoria acquired the assets of KOMFORT for Cr, 61 million. PV
maintained that prior to the petition for the bankruptcy of KOMFORT, the owner
of Astoria, Mr 7, had offered some DM3,400,000 (equivalent to
some Cr. 61,155,800 at that time)? for the Golf Resort. Mr was said by PV to
be a client of a lawyer, Dr who had drafted the petition for the
bankruptcy of KOMFORT at the request of «9 According to PV, the Golf
Resort is now owned by and by a Mr. . Mr is the
controlling owner of 3. Princova, the entity appointed as the Creditors’
Representative in the KOMFORT bankruptcy and likewise advised by Dr 10

28, PV alleges that Dr. was the “organiserof a criminal conspiracy to

deprive him of his investment and to which ! yMr | Mri and
Mr . were parties, along with the bankrutpcy judge, Mr *, and the
bankruptcy trustee, Dr } . (See also paragraphs 115-121 below).

29, PV further asserts that the failure on the part of the Czech police and state
attorneys to pursue criminal proceedings against these individuals constituted
an additional ground of breach of Article 4(1) of the BIT.12

30. For its part, the Czech Republic maintains that there is no proper basis
upon which to engage its responsibility pursuant to the Treaty. Rather, it submits
that this case is:

"A textbook case of a claimant who made a bad business decision and is now
looking to blame the State when he has only himself and his lawyers to blame,"13

31, Furthermore, contends the Czech Republic, BITs are not;
“insurance policies against had business judgments or bad legal advice."14

33. Pursuant to the terms of a Protocol to the Treaty, likewise done
on 2 October 1990, and which was stated to constitute; “an integral part of the
Treaty”, certain additional provisions were agreed, in particular:

- Ad Article 1:
“The claims to money referred to in article 1, paragraph (c), include claims arising
from loans in connection with a shareholding which, in purpose and scope, have the
character of a shareholding (shareholding-like loans). Credits from third parties,

hereunder.”

- Ad Article 4:
“The investor shall also have a claim to compensation if measures within the
meaning of article 4, paragraph 2, affect the enterprise in which he has shares and
his investment suffers thereby,”

G THE PARTIES’ CONTENTIONS

34, By his Statement of Claim dated 18 June 2010, PV maintained that
following the acquisition of a 50% share in KOMFORT, he had: “provided money
to [KOMFORT] through [his] German companies, especially ... MFT Engineering
GmbH .... [by way off informal ‘ad hoc’ loans,"’Thereafter, more formal
arrangements were made in January 1995, whereby PV concluded a “general
loan agreement” with KOMFORT for DM10 million (equivalent to Cr.200 million),
the funds to be lent “through entities controlled by [PV].” PV’s receivables were

 

18 Statement of Claim, para, 2
13

 

 

subsequently to be secured by way of a lien concluded between KOMFORT and
MFT-K Engineering, MFT-Engineering’s wholly owned Czech subsidiary, in
December 1997.6 PV maintained that his total investment in the Czech Republic
amounted to some Cr, 251,196,595.17It is PV’s case that the receivables
stemming from the repayment of these loans constitute a significant element of
the investment which he contends was expropriated and otherwise damaged by
reason of the alleged acts or omissions of the Czech Republic,

35, PV contended that, from the outset, the purpose of the credits obtained
from Sparkasse Essen, the “house bank’8 to PV’s MFT Group, and advanced to
KOMFORT through MFT Group entities, had been to build the Golf Resort and
that “Sparkasse Essen continuously monitored [the utilization of the credits}
for this purpose (on one hand by releasing the money only based on the
presentation of invoices concerning the construction, on the other hand, by
on-site monitoring.” (Emphasis added).

36, At the heart of PV’s complaint was the declaration of bankruptcy of
KOMFORT on 16 October 2001 (of both the application for which and the
declaration itself he maintained that he was not informed)?0 and the subsequent
sale of KOMFORT’s assets at what PV maintained was only a fraction of their real
market value. PV had been left unable to pursue his business activities in respect
of the Golf Resort, His inability to start to operate the Golf Resort, which, at the
time of the bankruptcy, already boasted an 18-hole international championship
course, had left him unable to meet his obligations in Germany, “which started a
chain reaction and caused [the] bankruptcy of [PV's] German companies.”21

37, PV contended that the fact that the Czech Republic did not prevent the
“illegal bankruptcy and composition proceedings” [and] the illegal deletion of
KOMFORT from the Commercial Register’ and its alleged “failure to ensure an
impartial and fair investigation" by the Czech Police “proved” that the Czech
Republic had “impaired” PV's investment as the “practical financier" of the
Project and the owner of a 50% stake in KOMFORT.*3 Moreover, it had failed to
protect PV’s investment and “subjected the investment to measures the results of
which [were] identical with expropriation."2+

21 Jdem, para.3
2 Although the composition proceedings were initiated by PV himself
on 31 January 2002, the alleged illegality was said to arise, because the
bankruptcy court failed to make a decision on the application before the close of
the public tender on 5 February 2002 and before the execution of the
agreements for the sale of the Golf Resort on 21 February 2002. (See Statement
of Claim, para. 44).

38, The acts of the bankruptcy Court and of the bankruptcy Trustee were
“acts of government agencies ... directly attributable to the Czech Republic." PV
acknowledged that if the characterisation of the bankruptcy Trustee as a
government agency was “questionable”, her acts could be characterised as those
of a person partly exercising state power: “An act of the bankruptcy Trustee is an
act which affects the procedural and substantive status of participants in the
bankruptcy proceedings and, as such, it thus directly establishes obligations for
these participants enforced by the state."25

39. PV's initial assessment of his loss by reason of the alleged activities of the
Czech Republic was some Cr. 1 billion,?6 Subsequently, in his Supplemental
Statement of Case, PV put forward a claim of Cr. 640,441,00027, comprising
Cr. 430 million in investment Joan and interest in opportunity costs and monies
lent through various entities or paid to KOMFORT.?8

40. PV sought the following relief:

a declaration that by “conduct attributable to the Czech Republic",
namely, the declaration of bankruptcy of KOMFORT and “other acts and
omissions of the bankruptcy judge, Mr ; %, the sale of the Golf Resort by the
bankruptcy trustee, Dr «+ and the deletion of KOMFORT from the
Commercial Registry, the Czech Republic had violated the fair and equitable
treatment standard in Article 2(1) and the non-impairment standard of Article
2(2) of the Treaty

- a declaration that those same events, together with the failure of
the Czech police and state attorneys to pursue criminal proceedings against the
bankruptcy Trustee, Dr ... Mr Mr Mr | ~,Mr.
and Mr . constituted violations attributable to the Czech Republic of the full
protection and security standard in Article 4(1) of the Treaty

- a declaration that the bankruptcy of KOMFORT and “other acts and

omissions of the bankruptcy judge, Mr '; and the sale of the Golf Resort by
the bankruptcy Trustee, Dr , constituted an expropriation in violation of
Article 4(2) of the Treaty.

PV also sought compensation for the damages that he alleged that he had
suffered by reason of these alleged breaches of the Treaty: interest thereon; and
an order for the costs of the arbitration and his legal and other costs on a full

indemnity basis.29

41, — By its Defense, the Czech Republic sought the dismissal of PV's claims in
their entirety. As a preliminary matter, the Czech Republic challenged PV’s
standing to advance his claims. Jt argued that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to
entertain claims made by PV in respect of “investment loans" allegedly provided

to KOMFORT, because virtually the totality of those loans had originated as a
bank credit granted by Sparkasse Essen. As such, they were not qualifying loans
under the terms of the Protocol. And even if the Tribunal were to determine that
the loans were qualifying investments, PV had failed to prove that he had
ownership of them at the time of the’alleged breaches of the Treaty.3° It was the
Czech Republic’s submission that PV had ceased to have any ownership interest
in MFT-K before KOMFORT was declared bankrupt and thus before any alleged
wrongdoing on the part of the Czech Republic?!. At most, the Tribunal had
jurisdiction in respect of PV's 50% interest in KOMFORT.32

42. Second, the factual record disclosed that PV had been afforded “wide
access to every level of the Czech civil and criminal judicial system”, which had
considered his claims “rationally and reasonably [and] found them unproven and
ill-founded”.33 The Czech Republic rejected any suggestion that PV’s complaints
in respect of the actions of the Regional Court in the course of the KOMFORT
bankruptcy proceedings came close to satisfying the high threshold necessary to
establish that he had been the victim of a denial of justice, not least, because he
had failed to exhaust all of the remedies available to him under the Czech judicial
system. The actions of the Regional Court did not constitute an expropriation.3+

43, Third, on proper analysis, the factual record provided no support for the
contention that KOMFORT’s bankruptcy and the loss of PV’s asserted investment
was the result of a conspiracy to which the bankruptcy Trustee herself as a party,
To the contrary, the bankruptcy 6f KOMFORT had been “inevitable”.35

44, Fourth, the Czech Republic contended that to the extent that PV could
demonstrate that he had suffered loss and damage at the hands of third parties,
none of them was an individual through whose actions the responsibility of the
Czech Republic had been engaged under the Treaty. It was common ground
between the Parties that Articles 4 and 5 of the International Law Commission's
Articles of State Responsibility (“the ILC Articles”) outlined the tests to
determine whether the conduct of the bankruptcy Trustee was attributable to
the Czech Republic.6 However, her actions, even if found to be wrongful, were
not the actions of an organ of the State (ILC Article 4), nor did she exercise
specified elements of governmental authority (JLC Article 5).

45. The Czech Republic further argued that the bankruptcy of KOMFORT had
nothing to do with any conduct or actions on its part: rather, PV’s failure to
secure adequate funding and prior unrelated financial difficulties in Germany led
to the failure of PV's venture in the Czech Republic, 37

46, — Finally, the Czech Republic maintained that PV’s damages claim itself was
open to serious question, both as to his entitlement to claim damages arising
from the Sparkasse Essen credit and as to the “speculative” nature of damages
said to flow from the loss of PV’s 50% interest in KOMFORT, Furthermore, losses
claimed in relation to activities in Germany were both vague in their formulation
and “otherwise [fell] foul of the prin ¢iples of foreseeability and predictability."38

H. FACTUAL BACKGROUND

47, The Parties’ positions, drawn from the same factual matrix, are poles
apart. Accordingly, as a preliminary matter, the Tribunal sets out the history of
the matter as it emerges from the record in this arbitration.

Initial Contacts between PVand

48. PV, the Claimant in this arbitration, is a businessman of many years
standing. He is based in Gelsenkirchen in the Federal Republic of Germany. In
addition to numerous property interests, PV was the owner of a 76% interest
in the German company, MFT-Verbrennungsanlagen- und Tanklagerbau GmbH
("MFT-VA”). MFT-Engineering GmbH {“MFT-E”), was a wholly owned subsidiary
of MFT-VA, MFT-E, in turn, owned a 100% interest in MFT-K Engineering spol.
s.r.0. ("MFT-K"), which was incorporated in the Czech Republic, His foray into the
development of the Cihelny Golf Resort was not the first golf resort venture that
he had undertaken: the Tribunal was told that in addition to his involvement in
the construction of a course at Schloss Horst in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, PV had
participated in the construction of around one dozen other golf courses.40

49. PV was first introduced to in 1993 by PV's trainer at his club in
Gelsenkirchen, Mr PV learned that was a golf ‘pro.’, who
managed a golf course in Karlovy Vary (formerly Carlsbad} in the Czech
Republic. 41 } \ was looking for investors in connection with the
development of a proposed golf resort at Cihelny, near Karlovy Vary. However,

had no significant funds of his own to invest.4?! x told PV that he
had studied architecture for several years at university and that he also had a
background in mathematics. Unbeknown to PV at the time, he had actually
previously been employed as a restaurant waiter.3

38 Idem, para. 17

39 PV stated that in early 1995, he owned real estate in Germany worth some
DMSO million. (See Statement of Claim, para.2),

40Transcript, Day1, p.9

41 Idem, p.136 and see also Exhibit ]5164

4 Transcript, Day1, p.132
43 Idem, p.137, PV told the Tribunal that had he known that then: “fhe] would

have looked into things a little more deeply”
17

 

50, Further meetings between PV ana * (and his family), including
several visits to Cihelny/Karlovy Vary, took place over the ensuing twelve
months. Notwithstanding . 3 limited business experience, PV considered
that had sufficient knowledge, from both a technical and a sporting point
of view, to understand what would be involved in the development and
promotion of a successful golf course project. PV felt confident enough to go into
business with as his partner in the context of the proposed Cihelny golf
course and resort development, which would cost many millions of Czech
crowns. PV told the Tribunal that it,was a financial relationship: “which did not
mean big risk for what I was planning”... “I’m sure he couldn’t have done
everything from a technical point of view, and the commercial side was not very
well developed, but I was looking after this side of things from [Germany]."**

51. PV stated that he had drawn up contracts with the principal suppliers.
Among them was a contract between MFT-E and the Gary Player Design
Company, In addition, PV’s accounting department was responsible for
monitoring the flow of funds to the Czech Republic. Until 1999, PV maintained
that Peterka’s qualifications had: “always proved themselves sufficient”.*5

52. In fact, all of the funding for the Cihelny project was to be provided
through, or by, PV. The Tribunal was told that the business plan for the Cihelny
Golf Resort project was based upon a plan prepared by sin 1994, PV
reviewed and costed it at some DM 8-9 million.t6 That plan envisaged the
development of the golf course and resort from scratch on what was then, quite
literally, a green field site. Initially, PV proposed that he would commit up to
DM10 million to: “see how far we get with that’.*?

53. In order to assist in the preparation of formal contracts, PV retained
advisers in the Czech Republic: a German-speaking Czech lawyer, Dr.

who also advised : company, KOMFORT Bytove zarizeni spol, s.r.o.,
("KOMFORT Bytove”), which had been incorporated in March 1991.48 PV further
retained a tax adviser (D: ' Dr. was, in fact, a gynaecologist, who,

although not a trained tax specialist, held himself out as a tax consultant as a
second job.*9

PV's Acquisition of a 50% Interestin KOMFORT

54. On 10 November 1994, PV and Peterka entered into an agreement
pursuant to which, PV acquired 50% of KOMFORT Bytove for a cash payment of
Cr, 50,000.5° The agreement had been drafted in Czech by Dr} PV, who did

not speak Czech, told the Tribunal that Dr chad read the agreement out to
him in German and he had: “[taken] it as truth."51 Upon PV’s acquisition of his
interest in KOMFORT Bytove, the name of the company was to be changed to
KOMFORT V.P. Cihelny, spol. s.r.o. ("KOMFORT”). The name change was effected
on 15 June 1995,52]t was also agreed that KOMFORT would relocate its
registered office to CiheIny. PV and both served as Directors and proxies
of KOMFORT from 15 June 1995 until its deletion from the Commercial Register
in March 2007.

55. On 23 November 1994, pursuant to a loan agreement between MFT-K and
KOMFORT, MFT-K undertook, with effect from 1 January 1995, to provide a loan
of up to Cr. 100,000,000 to KOMFORT at an interest rate of 8% to: “finance a golf
project in Cihelny."53

56. On the same day, and pursuant to his and ’s intention to “develop a
golf resort in Cihelny as equal partners"54, PV entered into a personal agreement
with KOMFORT to lend KOMFORT up to DM 10 million (corresponding to Cr.
200,000,000) at a rate of 8% per annum for the first 10 years in respect of the
development of a golf resort at Cihelny, including the purchase of land and
construction works. Monies were to be released in tranches ~ usually through
MFT-K - by 31 December 2002 and by reference to the progress of the
construction works in respect of the development. The agreement anticipated
that a first payment of DM650,000 (Cr. 11,558,300) would be made
on 27 July 1994 (some four months before the conclusion of the loan
agreement). The loan was repayable by 31 December 2009. In fact, it appears
that no payments were made pursuant to this second agreement.55

KOMFORT's Acquisition of Land at Cihelny/Lease of “Zamecek”

57. On18 August 1995, KOMFORT acquired some 206,483m2 (185,580m2 in
Cihelny and 20,903mz2 in Stanovice) of pasture, meadow, arable and other land
“solely for the purpose of building the 15* stage of the Cihelny golf and sports
centre” from the Land Fund of the Czech Republic for Cr. 30,972, 450. 20% of the
purchase price was to be paid prior to the signing of the agreement. The balance
of 80% was payable by 31 December 1995, The sale was revocable by the Land
Fund in the event that KOMFORT failed to present an “effective urban planning
decision of the relevant building authority of Karlovy Vary" “within I year from the
date of entry of title into the Land Registry."®6 The application was in fact made on
10 June 1997.57

58. By a further agreement dated 24 January 1996, KOMFORT entered into a
10-year lease agreement with the City of Prague for the use of buildings (in
particular, a manor house ("Zamecek”)) and land at Cihelny as KOMFORT’s
registered office and guest accommodation at the golf course.5®

59, On 1 February 1996, MFT-K entered into two agreements with Sparkasse
Essen ~ PV’s and his companies’ “house bank” for some 30 years? - for loans of
DM3 million and DM2 million respectively, Each loan was secured by liens over
MFT-K’s assets of DM3 million and by persona] guarantees issued by both PV and
Peterka of DM2 million.

60. Qn 19 December 1997, KOMFORT entered into a mortgage agreement
with MFT-K, for a mortgage in favour of MFT-K over all of KOMFORT's real
property and pursuant to which, the November 1994 Joan (see paragraph 55
above) was increased to Cr, 200 million.6°

61, On 24 April 1998, the Building Office of Karlovy Vary issued a building
permit to KOMFORT for structures to provide club facilities, including changing
rooms, a restaurant and a clubroom®! The decision became effective
on 18 May 1998.

62. However, on 25 August 1998, the City of Prague filed proceedings against

KOMFORT for unpaid rent due in 1997 and 1998 and contractual penalties in
respect of Zamecek, amounting to Cr, 925,250. Pursuant to a Power of Attorney

made by the two Executive Directors of KOMFORT, and PV,
on 26 October 1998, Dr represented KOMFORT in the termination
proceedings.©

63. On 3 November 1998, the City of Prague served notice of termination of
the lease, the notice period ending on 1 December 1999.63 KOMFORT refused to

quit.

Funding Difficulties Affecting Progress on Site and Termination of the
“Zamecek" Lease

64, —_ In correspondence, of which his letter of 10 August 1999 is an example,

reason of a lack of funds to meet pavments to creditors, who were refusing to
continue to work. + wrote: © consider whether it is not better to stop

risks associated with it. Or manage to obtain even more expensive money, it must
be cheaper in the final consequence."6*

65. On 1 December 1999, KOMFORT entered into a Lease Agreement with the
Cihelny Golf Club civic association, an entity controlled by and a lawyer
to whom reference has already been made and who was to come to play a
significant role in the matter as it unfolded, Dr The lease was for a period
of 50 years, subject to a right to extend for a further 10 years, at an initial annual
rental of Cr,180,000. While the amount of the rental payments after the first year
was to be the subject of “a detailed arrangement” in an amendment agreement,
which the Parties undertook to negotiate, if no such further agreement was
reached, the rent was to remain fixed at the initial rate.65

66. KOMFORT had refused to leave the Zamecek premises upon the
expiration of the notice period (See paragraph 63 above) and on 7 December
1999, the District Court in Karlovy Vary upheld the City of Prague’s claim to the
property. On 27 December 1999, the City began eviction proceedings against
KOMFORT,6which KOMFORT lost.6?

67. On 24 February 2000: wrote again to PV, urging him to take the
project forward, as: “contracts are renewed and the suppliers are awaiting our
instructions,”®8 But only a matter of weeks later, on 15 ‘May 2000, ’ Was
writing to PV to impress upon him the fact that the site faced: “a similar collapse
as last year." . maintained that:

“U]f Sparkasse Essen does not release [DM 150,000] today, I will send a question to
the bank tomorrow as to why they are causing such losses to us by such procedure
despite having found everything was alright, and why they are making such a mess
in respect of the last DM400,000 to 500,000 which are missing to the
completion..." & Subsequently, on 7 June 2000, sought to blame
Sparkasse for the breakdown of relations with suppliers, threats of court action
and of the suspension of the works, because he had proceeded with the works on
the promise of a payment of DM150,000, which had not been forthcoming. He
continued:

“I suppose that if Sparkasse Essen is such an unreliable, and for me untrustworthy,
partner, nobody can expect helpful actions either on my side.” 7°

68. ‘It is clear from the exchanges between and PV that by June 2000,
the personal relationship between PV and was deteriorating and that
there were issues with Sparkasse Essen.71 (It appears that in the summer of
2000, discussions were in train with Sparkasse Essen, so far as a refinancing of
KOMFORT was concerned ~ see paragraph 70 below).

criticised PV for being out of touch with the status of the works; for
mistakes in the funding; and for ‘drip-feeding’ funds, In a particularly bad-
tempered letter dated 20 june 2000, . told PV that:
“If you want to suspend the construction or to jeopardise its quality in any way
through not well-thought steps, write it to me. | will discontinue dealing with the
Ministry of Environment and in the case of failure to comply with the time-limits of
the phases with respect to the returning of arable land, you bear all responsibility.
w. [DJo not think that if the funding is discontinued and the construction is
suspended, I will discuss anything with anybody.
If you are not able to immediately obtain DM250,000 in the whole of Germany to
complete the project and send them immediately, than (sic) |, before proceeding to
deal with Sparkasse Essen, want all documents from 1995/contracts, account
statements, transfer orders etc, for consulting, and | do not believe that it will be
possible within a month."72

69, — [tis to be noted, too, that ' wrote to PV to alert him to the fact that
if KOMFORT did not meet its debts to certain suppliers by 3 July 2000:

“they would jointly file a bankruptcy petition with respect to [KOMFORT] with a
court in Pilsen in the week from 3 July 2000 to 7 July 2000.73

The Attempted Refinancing of KOMFORT

70. PV himself, writing on MFT-E letterhead, was in direct communication
with Dr | by the end of July 2000, instructing him to communicate with
Sparkasse Essen about a refinancing of KOMFORT and, in that regard, to forward
to PV drafts of the documentation relating to a proposed repayment extension of
the Sparkasse Essen Joans,’*

71. Thereafter, on 21 November 2000, Sparkasse Essen submitted a draft
agreement to the Jaw firm of Aldebert in Munich (with copy to PV) in respect of
its claims arising in respect of loans made to MFT-E, MFT-K and MFT-VA, totaling
DM10.436 million. The agreement contemplated an assignment of some DM 1.7
million of the MFT-E indebtedness, all of the MFT-K indebtedness of some
DM4.24 million and some DM 4.48 million of the MFT-VA indebtedness to a third
party buyer, described as “xy”, in consideration of a payment of DM 3,4 million to
Sparkasse Essen. Further it was proposed that PV and would each
relinquish their 50% interests in KOMFORT to xy and MFT-E would transfer its
100% interest in MFT-K to xy. In addition, various insurance policies made in

favour of PV and his immediate family were to be assigned to Sparkasse which
would be entitled to apply any eventual proceeds to the balance of DM 7.136
million of its exposure over and above the proposed immediate payment of
DM3.4 million, In return, Sparkasse would confirm that it had no claims of
whatsoever nature against KOMFORT.75

72. In the meantime, on 19 October 2000, KOMFORT had been obliged to
apply to the Karlovy Vary Building Office for an extension of time for the
completion of the Cihelny Club facilities from 31 December 2000 to 31 December
2002 by reason of its “lack of funds." The application was granted
on 13 December 2000.76

73, On 20 December 2000, MFT-E assigned a Cr. 26.1 million receivable due
from KOMFORT to MFT-K, On the same day, MFT-VA assigned a receivable of
Cr, 53.754 million due from KOMFORT to MFT-K; and PV likewise assigned a
receivable of Cr. 28.331 million to MFT-K. All of these receivables, some Cr. 108
million in all, related to costs incurred In the development of the Cihelny Golf
course and related expenses. One final assignment was made that day whereby
another creditor of KOMFORT, Mr: assigned a receivable of Cr.158,535.71
to MFT-K,

74, The result of these arrangements was that MFT-K became the only entity
in the MFT Group entitled to repayment of loans made to KOMFORT,?? which,
over PV's signature, signed an Acknowledgement of Debt with MFT-K
on 27 December 2000.8 The Acknowledgement of Debt recorded that:

“The .., amount [of Cr.217,919,595] represents the loan granted under agreement
of 23 November 1994 to [KOMFORT] by [MFT-K] to purchase lands and develop a
golf course in Ciheiny.... The originally arranged loan was increased to Cr.200
{million] that was to be paid either directly from the account of [MFT-K] or
through [MFT-E] or [MFT-VA] or through other entities, As of this day, the amounts
granted to [KOMFORT] total at Cr.217,919,959, These amounts are shown in the
books of [KOMFORT] and have been either credited with the account of this
company or have been used to pay invoices on behalf of [KOMFORT]. The receivable
falls due in 31 December 2002 and bears an 8% interest rate." 7

75. On the same day, MFT-K further assigned receivables (loans) of
ae 120,000,000 out of the total of Cr. 217,919,000 due from KOMFORT to a
a longstanding business associate and friend of PV.89

The Intervention of SOLITAER

76, Simultaneously, PV signed over to SOLITAER Immobilienverwaltung
GmbH [("SOLITAER") of which Mr was the Executive Director, MFT-E’s
entire ownership interest of Cr. 11,658 million in MFT-K (“The Transfer
Agreement”), SOLITAER thereby became the sole shareholder in MFT-K.81 Once
the Transfer Agreement was in place, PV was removed as the Managing Director
of MFT-K. PV was replaced by Dr , who, it will be recalled, was also
retained as PV's tax adviser,

77, Two days later, on 29 December 2000, a draft of an offer letter to
Sparkasse from SOLITAER was prepared. The draft set out a proposal by
SOLITAER to match the offer made by Aldebert’s undisclosed principals (see
paragraph 71 above) to take over the indebtedness of PV and the MFT Group and
thereby to settle: “any and all existing and prospective claims of Sparkasse against
KOMFORT’#2

78. But on 26 January 2001, SOLITAER wrote to PV to explain that whilst it
‘was ready to obtain a written promise of funding, ~ had yet to give his
consent. It was hoped that a meeting with Peterka on 27/28 January 2001 would
prove positive and that it would then be possible to make the first payments “in
about 14 days."83

The Withdrawal of Sparkasse Essen Funding

79. On 1 February 2001, however, Sparkasse Essen wrote to PV to complain
(seemingly, not for the first time) that important agreements and decisions had
been made without its knowledge. Specifically, the Bank required sight of the
agreement in respect of the transfer of ownership interests in MFT-K “as soon as
possible”. Further, Sparkasse insisted that:

“[YJou and your company must sign agreements associated with the Czech case in
the 6% calendar week at the latest ... If the agreements are not signed by that date,
we shall withdraw our current waiver of payments of interest and principal,
we shall also terminate our business relations and we will launch a process
aimed to realize the collateral we have been provided.” 8 That threat was to
be carried out by Sparkasse Essen in April 2001.85

81 Exhibit JB56, It is PV's case that this arrangement was cancelled
on 2 February 2007 on the basis that SOLITAER had failed to pay the purchase
price of Cr. 11,658 million for MFT-E’s interest. SOLITAER and MFT-E therefore
undertook to: “provide their coordination necessary to delete SOILTAER from the,
and to register [MFT-E] in, the section regarding members of [MFT-K].”
(See Exhibit JB285).

80. At almost the same time, PV and wrote to another potential
investor, Mr , on 2 February 2001, offering to sell the entire
ownership interests in KOMFORT for DM17 million. % It was suggested that

actions were the reason why nothing was to come of that initiative.
(See paragraph 145 below).

MFT-VA Divests Itself of its Interest in MFT-E: Insolvency of MFT-VA

81. On 8 March 2001, MFT-VA's entire ownership interest of DM50,000 in
MFT-E was divided into four equal shares of Dm12,500, Three were transferred
to individuals, . Voecklinghaus (PV's daughter), . land

: The fourth went to CIC Capital- und Immobilien Contor GmbH.®7
PV retained his 76% ownership interest in MFT-VA. MFT-VA was declared
insolvent on 5 June 2001.88

82, The Gran Opening of the Cihelny Golf Club Golf Course, “constructed by

“1”, took place on 26 May 2001. Acknowledging that a club house
and other racuities had still to be constructed, . . told the press that the
construction of the course had cost some Cr.60 million and that he anticipated
that the investment would be paid back within 15 years. ®? Within a week of the
Grand Opening, KOMFORT, represented by entered into an agreement
with on 1 June 2001, pursuant to which, KOMFORT agreed inter alia,
to vacate the Cihelny premises that it had leased from the City of Prague (and the
rights to which thad acquired) with effect from 5 June 2001.99

83, In the course of September 2001, KOMFORT commissioned two valuation
reports. The first of these, the Fiala Report, sought to value the land: “regardless
of [its] current use” and produced a valuation of Cr. 26,555,800.%! The second, the

Valuation Report, which focused upon the “real estate - golf
premises ... i.e, operational structures, agricultural structures, water management
structures, external alterations, excluding plots of land", arrived at a valuation of
Cr, 15,067,440.9

The Bankruptcy of KOMFORT

84. On 5 October 2001, KOMFORT filed for bankruptcy. The petition, which
was submitted by , stated that KOMFORT was unable to meet its
obligations to its creditor, MFT-K, “primarily due to a fall in the prices of real
property in the last months of this year." MFT-K was stated to have a receivable of

VODOINVEST - to whom some Cr. 76,088 was said to be due). Since its efforts to
find a strategic partner had failed, and notwithstanding the implementation of a
recovery plan in April 2001, KOMFORT asserted that it did not have the funds to
secure the winterisation of the course, “practically its sole property”, and which
was essential to avoid its destruction. Accordingly, KOMFORT’s only option was
to file for bankruptcy.

85. On 9 October 2001, a company called Novota was commissioned by
Temple Supplies as. (“Temple”) to carry out a valuation of the golf course.
Temple was said to be interested to appraise the site as collateral for a loan for
which application was to be made to Union Banka, Novota inspected the site
on 3 October 2001 in the presence of “the proprietor’, >. Novota’s report,
issued in October 2001, assessed the market value of the property at “an
interesting price” of Cr. 140,119,000 and assessed its distressed sale value at
Cr. 116,065,000.9*

86. On 16 October 2001, Judge of the Regional Court in Pilsen, by way of
a decision, which was stated to be not appealable, declared KOMFORT bankrupt.
He appointed Dr as the Trustee in bankruptcy. The Judgment
specifically provided that:

“The creditors of the debtor are invited to register (in two counterparts) all their
claims within 30 days of the declaration of bankruptcy. The registration must
separately specify the grounds and the amount of each registered claim. Copies of
documents that gave rise to each claim must be attached to the claim registration.
If claims are quoted in a foreign currency, they must be converted on the basis of
the exchange rate published by the Czech National Bank on the day on which the
bankruptcy was declared. The enforceability of enforceable claims must be proved
by a document that features a confirmation of enforceability no later than the
review hearing; otherwise the claim shall be deemed unenforceable, Claims
registered later than within two months of the first review hearing shall be
ignored,"95

87. By letter dated 16 October 2001, Judge . wrote to Economia a.s.,
requesting the publication of a Notice, setting out these salient terms of his
decision.%6.lt is not in dispute that the Court also sent copies of the Declaration
by registered mail to both Directors of KOMFORT (Mr and PV}, to
Mr and to MFT-K, the cited creditors, various public authorities, the
bankruptcy Trustee and to KOMFORT itself.9?

88, On 29 October 2001, the Regional Court in Pilsen issued a Summons
requiring a meeting of the bankruptcy creditors and a review hearing to be held

on the afternoon of 12 December 2001 for the purposes of verifying registered
claims and electing the creditors’ committee.%?

89. On 6 November 2001, PV, in his capacity as Executive Director of MFT-K,

issued a Power of Attorney to Dr * co represent MFT-K in connection
with the KOMFORT bankruptcy proceedings.°* PV issued a further Power of
Attorney in his own right to Dr. on 7 November 2001.

90, On 7 November 2001, Dr filed his own claim (for Cr. 1,050) in the

bankruptcy in respect of legal advice, provided to KOMFORT’s Executive Director
and Proxy in September 2001. He spent five minutes inspecting the file.
However, by letter dated 19 November 2001, the Trustee notified Dr_ that
she could not review his claim without further information, as no documents
proving his claim had been submitted and; “[KOMFORT’s] accounting books show
no corresponding obligation towards creditor,”00

91. Further claims were registered by Mediatel (on 7 November 2001) and by
3 Princova (on 12 November 2001), the latter relying on the withdrawal of the
Settlement of Mutual Claims between KOMFORT and 3 Princova of 1 June 2001 -
see paragraph 82 above - and raising a separate claim of Cr, 4,800.11

92. On 21 November 2001, Temple submitted an offer to the Trustee in
bankruptcy to buy the land and structures comprising the Cihelny Golf resort for
Cr. 45,000,000. That same day, the Trustee entered into a contract for the
winterisation and maintenance of the Cihelny golf course with Temple for the
sum of Cr, 2,238,232,102

93. MPT-K’s registration of claim in the KOMFORT bankruptcy
dated 27 November 2001, which was prepared by Dr | was stamped
received by the Court only at 14h00 on 10 December 2001. The claim was stated
to be in the amount of Cr. 97,919,595, representing the balance of the receivable
of Cr. 217,919,595 under the Loan Agreement, less the amount assigned to
Mr Mair on 27 December 2000 of Cr. 120 million, The claim was supported by
three documents: the Acknowledgement of Debt dated 27 December 2000; the
Agreement on Assignment of a Receivable dated 27 December 2000; and the
Mortgage Agreement dated 22 June 1998,103

94. Mr ~~ own registration of claim for a receivable of Cr. 120,000,000,
likewise prepared by Dr was also dated 27 November 2001. It was
stamped received by the Court at 14h00 on 10 December 2001 - as was a claim
by PV in his own right in the amount of DM30,000 (and stated as such, in
contravention of the requirement that all claims be denominated in Czech
crowns), said to represent cash paid by PV to KOMFORT via t
on 5 November 2000,204

95. Dr briefly inspected the file for a second time on 10 December
2001 for ten minutes between 14h10 and 14h20.195

96. On 12 December 2001, the Chairman of the Czech Golf Federation,
Dr wrote to Dr He sought a meeting and offered his
cooperation in the ‘identification of potential investors in the Cihelny golf
course.196 Dr deplored the fact that the speed with which the disposal was
being organised precluded Czech golf clubs and associations from participation.
He urged a reconsideration. His letter went unacknowledged, as Dr _ noted
in a follow-up letter of 21 January 2002 addressed to Judge Dr
questioned whether the public tender was the most appropriate way forward. By
his reply dated 22 January 2002, however, the Judge confirmed his intention to
proceed with the tender and to hold to the timetable that had been fixed, as
Dr had “failed to convince [him]” that any additional measures were
necessary.107

The 12 December 2001 Review Hearing

97. The Review Hearing was duly held on 12 December 2001.18 Judge '
presided. It was determined that the claims of MFT-K and of Mr had been
registered too late to enable their validity to be verified at the hearing.199 For the

106 Exhibit JB106.

107 Exhibits JB1128&129

108 The Minutes of the Review Hearing are at Exhibit ]B104.

109 On 27 December 2001, MFT-K, Mr and PV were each asked to provide
supplemental information in respect of their claims in the absence of which, no
account would be taken of them. (See Exhibits JB 112,113&114). PV, MFT-K and
Mr - duly submitted further details on 22 January 2002. (See Exhibits JB
72,73&74), MFT-K added back into its claim the Cr. 120,000,000 assigned to
Mr ‘as a precaution against the possibility that Mr own claim would
not be recognised. MFT-K's and PV's respective claims were subsequently
recognised by the Trustee at the Second Review Hearing on 12 April 2002. (See
the Minutes at Exhibit JB158). Mr claim was contested by the Trustee for
want of substantiation of the extent of any indebtedness of KOMFORT to MFT-K
at the time of the assignment to Mr At the request of the Trustee, Mr

claim became the subject of separate proceedings in the Regional Court, although
they were postponed pending the hearing of the application made by KOMFORT

28

 

 

 

same reason, the Court further determined that neither MFT-K nor Mr was
eligible for appointment to represent the creditors, PV protested that, as the
Executive for Germany: “he ... had no oversight over the actions of the company in
the Czech Republic especially in 2001..." and that the submission of MFT-K’s claim
had been delayed, because he had had no access to the accounting books of
KOMFORT, which were maintained in the Czech Republic. However, it was noted
that, In his capacity as a Director of MFT-K, PV had been informed of the
proceedings by his legal counsel, Dr” ;, before 15 November 2001. PV's own
Standing to represent the creditors was rejected on different grounds: quite
apart from the fact that he had submitted a (non-conforming) claim in his own
right, PV was recorded as having informed the Court that he had no interest as
an individual. Rather, MFT-K as a company had an interest. Jn that regard, the
Court took note of the fact that PV was an Executive Director of KOMFORT as
well as of MFT-K and, accordingly, the Court declined to nominate MFT-K as the
Creditors’ Representative.

98. According to the Minute of the proceedings, the Court approved the
appointment of 3 Princova, the only creditor with a voting right, as the Creditors’

Representative. It did so over the vociferous objection of Dr , including an
allegation of a fraud to which Dr {and 3 Princova were party at the expense
of MFT-K, that 3 Princova had a conflict of interest. Dr * contended that 3

Princova wished to acquire the golf course for itself and hence had no interest in
ensuring that the best price was achieved on any sale of the course. He argued
that the proposal of a quick sale by public tender or auction would be prejudicial
to the largest creditors of KOMFORT, namely MFT-K and Mr;

99, The Minute of the subsequent meeting between the Judge, the Trustee
and the Creditors’ representative, 3 Princova (Dr 4 recorded that the
Trustee and Dr agreed that the sale of KOMFORT’s real and movable
property should be undertaken by way of a public tender: “through areal estate
agent for a minimum price of Cr. 48 million ... and a closure deadline of 4 February
2002.” The next hearing in the matter was fixed for 5 February 2002. 1°

100, The real estate agent selected by the Trustee was Nemovitosti REELA
spol, s.r.o. ("REELA"). The Trustee entered into an agreement with REELA
on 13 December 2001. REELA was to be paid a fee of 4.5% + VAT, based on the
achieved purchase price, The agreement stipulated that the minimum price
should be Cr. 48,000,000 and that a Cr. 20,000,000 security deposit was to be
lodged by any bidder by 1 February 2002. Site inspections were to be held
on 18 and 23 January 2002.11

 

to cancel the bankruptcy proceedings. Mr" claim was acknowledged by the
Trustee on 16 March 2004. (See Exhibit JB190).

The Public Tender

101. The Cihelny course was duly put out to public tender, In the course of the
bidding period ~ 27 December 2001 to 4 February 2002 - 10 parties collected
copies of the Tender Documents,."12 On 5 February 2002, the Court convened
with the Trustee and the Creditors’ Representative in order to open the three
conforming bids. (A fourth bidder had failed to lodge the security deposit by the
1 February 2002 deadline and was accordingly ruled ineligible). The winning bid
was submitted by Astoria in the sum of Cr. 61,000,000.1!3 Subsequently,
on 21 February 2002, the agreements for the sale of the golf course were
concluded between the Trustee and Astoria. 14On 22 May 2002, Dr and
Mr established Astoria Golf Club Cihelny civic association to operate the
golf course and on 31 May 2004, Astoria Golf Resort a.s. was incorporated,
controlled de facto by Mr and Mr 415 A Final Use Permit was issued by
the Karlovy Vary Building Office in favour of Astoria on 2 August 2004,

RELATED CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
Composition Proceedings

102, In the meantime, and some six weeks after the approval of the public
tender for the sale of the Cihelny Golf Course, PV, in his capacity as a
representative of both KOMFORT and MFT-K, applied to the Regional Court on
31 January 2002 for mandatory composition on behalf of KOMFORT.136
On 4 February 2002, Dr wrote to the Court requesting a ruling on PV's
petition.2?” The Court's attention was drawn to an offer by PV to purchase the
Cihelny course for the sum of Cr. 150 million in an auction, provided the public
tender was cancelled and the loans provided to KOMFORT were set off against
the purchase price. PV conceded that the bid was not in conformity with the
then existing tender rules, which required the payment of a Cr. 20,000,000
deposit within a stipulated deadline.8

103. On 7 February 2002, the Regional Court determined that the submission
failed to demonstrate that Mr ' had withdrawn his claim in bankruptcy
against KOMFORT, such that his claim would not need to be settled as part of the
mandatory composition. The Court gave PV an opportunity to supplement his
application,419 but he failed to do so within the required time limit and so,
on 12 March 2002, the application was rejected.120

104. That decision of the Regional Court was the subject of an appeal to the
High Court in Prague on 2 April 2002, Subsequently, KOMFORT supplemented its
appeal on 19 November 2002. Although the appeal was partially successful in
that the High Court remitted the matter to the Regional Court on 19 March 2003,
it clarified that there might be reasons why an application could be rejected
without the need for a review hearing - as, indeed, was held to be the case.122

Petition to Discontinue Bankruptcy Proceedings

105. On 20 March 2002, KOMFORT petitioned to discontinue the bankruptcy
proceedings on the basis that lacked authority to file the petition. The
Regional Court required KOMFORT to supplement the petition, which it did
on 8 April 2002. The Regional Court rejected the petition on 11 April 2002,
concluding that was authorised to file the bankruptcy petition on behalf
of KOMFORT. That decision was itself appealed by KOMFORT to the High Court
in Prague. The High Court upheld the Regional Court's ruling, noting that an
application for cancellation of bankruptcy was not the correct procedure to be
followed in the case of a complaint such as this, A further appeal made by
KOMFORT on 6 October 2003 to the Supreme Court of the Czech Republic was
rejected on 10 March 2005.322

Termination of the Bankruptcy

106. Pursuant to the Trustee’s request, the Regional Court approved payment
to MFT-K as a secured creditor of KOMFORT in the sum of Cr, 34,811,219.87 on
22 July 2005. A further payment of Cr.4,338,812.49 was made to MFT-K, together
with payments of Cr.9,443,585.07 to Mr and Cr.37,732,62 to PV
on 2 May 2006, following the submission of the Trustee's final report.123

Damages Claims against , the Bankruptcy Trustee and Claim
against Judge’

107, The termination of KOMFORT’s bankruptcy, following distribution of the
proceeds of sale of KOMFORT’s assets, was achieved on 10 August 2006.'2*By
letter dated 5 September 2006, Dr Hajsman confirmed that KOMFORT would not
appeal the decision to terminate the bankruptcy. Dr | also stated that
KOMFORT was pursuing claims for damages against and the Trustee,
Dr \.125An additional claim was filed, also in early February 2004, with
the Ministry of Justice against Judge The Jatter claim was rejected by the

Ministry in June 2004, but it was open to the Plaintiffs, MFT-K and PV, to refile
their claim in proper form.126

108. So far as the claims against the Trustee and were concerned, they
were transferred from Pilsen to Ceske Budejovice by a decision of the High Court.
The High Court accepted a request from the judges of the Regional Court in
Pilsen that they should recuse themselves, in order to ensure that there was no
appearance of bias, given the nature of the proceedings and the personalities
involved.'27 KOMFORT and MFT-K sought exemption from payment of the
statutory court fees on grounds of bankruptcy and a lack of financia] means
respectively on 14 June 2005 and PV withdrew his own claim on 23 June
2005.128 On 29 August 2005, the Court discontinued PV's claim and granted
KOMFORT the exemption that it sought. However, MFT-K’s application was
denied. 129MFT-K failed to pay the fee-and, subsequently, its claims, having been
Separated out from the KOMFORT claims, were discontinued by the Court in
Karlovy Vary on 4 January 2007,130Although neither MFT-K, nor PV was barred
from refiling their claims by the Czech courts, they never did so.

109. Pursuant to a decision of the High Court in Prague in March 2006, the
KOMFORT claims were themselves bifurcated: the Court in Ceske Budejovice
retained the claim against i and the claim against the Trustee was
transferred to the District Court in Plzen-mesto.!34In Octaber 2005, prior to the
bifurcation, the Court in Ceske Budejovice had rejected an application by
KOMFORT to join the Ministry of Justice as a Defendant.32

110. Subsequently, on 21 September 2006, it rejected KOMFORT's claim
against Peterka on the basis that after the declaration of bankruptcy, only the
Trustee had standing to bring such an action for damages.133 KOMFORT appealed
the decision on 16 October 2006 and while the appeal was pending, the
bankruptcy of KOMFORT was terminated, thereby removing the exclusive
standing of the Trustee to bring such a claim, On 1 February 2007, the High Court
in Prague overruled the Ceske Budejovice decision and remanded the case.134
However, following the deletion of KOMFORT from the Register, KOMFORT had
ceased to exist as a legal entity and it no longer had capacity to bring
proceedings. KOMFORT's action against the bankruptcy Trustee was dismissed
by the Court in Plzen-mesto on 15 August 2007, Its claim against was
dismissed by the Court in Ceske Budejovice on 27 August 2007.135

111. The termination of the bankruptcy became effective on 12 September
2006 and it was recorded on the Commercial Register on 30 November 2006,136
On 6 March 2007, the Register Court registered KOMFORT’s deletion from the
Commercial register, pursuant to an application by . (in his capacity as a
Director of KOMFORT), made on 2 March 2007.137The Resolution whereby
KOMFORT was deleted from the Register concluded with the statement that:
“an appeal may be filed against this resolution to the High Court in Prague through
the aforementioned court within fifteen days of its delivery.”

In the absence of any such appeal, the resolution became effective
on 31 March 2007 and KOMFORT ceased to exist as legal entity.

RELATED CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS AND ENQUIRIES

112. Between 31 January 2002 and 16 June 2006, when his complaint was
dismissed, PV initiated and pursued criminal proceedings against a number of
individuals, including’ 1 and the bankruptcy Trustee, Dr

113. The complaint against : was lodged (wrongly) in the office of the
Regional Public Prosecutor in Pilsen rather than with the District Public
Prosecutor in Karlovy Vary, which then referred the complaint to the Police, The
proceedings were formally initiated on 4 April 2002. The Police interviewed
representatives of REELA, Dr , Dr aand PV. KOMFORT’s
accounting records, held by its accountant, Mrs ; were seized.

114. In September 2002, following further allegations made by PV and the
submission of a claim for damages of Cr. 200 million, the matter was referred by
the District Public Prosecutor in Karlovy Vary to the corruption and serious
economic crimes unit of the Pilsen police. Following extensive examination by
the Pilsen Police, the matter was suspended on 21 November 2002, on the basis
that it appeared to be a commercial dispute between private parties.38

115. PV filed an unparticularised complaint against the suspension
on 26 November 2002.!39No further supporting material was seen by the
District Public Prosecutor's Office in Karlovy unti] 25 November 2003, when it
received PV's submission of 19 October 2003.'49 PV's October 2003 submission
raised allegations of conspiracy between »Dr) Judge and the
bankruptcy Trustee to assist Mr ‘s company to acquire the Cihelny course at
an unreasonably low price; it alleged a breach of the bankruptcy Trustee’s duty
properly to administer the bankruptcy of KOMFORT; a separate breach relating
to the winterisation of the golf course; and an allegation of fraud on the part of
Mr of Temple.

116. Matters were complicated by PV’s insistence that jurisdiction to deal with
his complaint against the decision of the Pilsen Police to suspend the
proceedings lay with the Regional] Public Prosecutor's Office in Pilsen, rather
than with the District Public Prosecutor in Karlovy Vary. That dispute was finally
resolved against PV by the High Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague
in March 2004.41

117, In the event, the suspension of the proceedings was revoked
on 26 April 2004, when the District Public Prosecutor's Office in Karlovy Vary
ordered the Pilsen Police to reopen its enquiry and to interview all persons with
knowledge of the bankruptcy proceedings.142

118. From the record in this arbitration, it is apparent that, between May 2004
and January 2006, the Police interviewed some eight individuals connected with
the bankruptcy. They included Mr: the bankruptcy Trustee, Dr

Mr Se iMs.i “3 Dr “Mr. and Mri

119. In addition, expert reports were commissioned from (i) Ceska znalecka in
respect of the market valuation of the Cihelny golf Course; the standing of
receivables said to be due to PV and to MFT-K at the time of the filing of the
KOMFORT bankruptcy petition; and KOMFORT’s own financial standing: and (ii)
from a golfing expert, Mr Jirasek.!43

120. On the basis of their investigations, which in the case of Dr a were
particularly protracted, involving not only the Pilsen Police but the Regional
Public Prosecutor's Office, the Pilsen Police concluded that there was insufficient
evidence to commence criminal prosecutions against any of y Mr) ‘
Drt or Mr “, On 29 May 2006, the Pilsen Police suspended their

enquiries,14*

,
121. PV protested that decision on 31 May 2006 but, as he failed to adduce any
supporting documentation, the complaint was dismissed by the Regional Public
Prosecutor’s Office in Pilsen in 16 June 2006.45

IL, ANALYSIS

122, The Tribunal has sought to reflect the chronological record revealed by
contemporaneous documents with some care. It is possible thereby to place the
interventions of officials and those of the Courts and the Police in the Czech
Republic upon which PV seeks to base his claims in the context of his overall
activities in respect of the Cihelny venture.

123. What emerges from that record and from PV's evidence to the Tribunal is
that, in November 1994, PV undertook an effectively open-ended commitment to
finance the development of the Cihelny golf course project from a green field site
on the basis of rudimentary financial cost projections prepared by 16a
man whom, as Counsel for the Czech Republic put it, PV “barely knew."1*? PV had
a long and successful career in business behind him, principally in and around
Gelsenkirchen in Germany, often working with his brother and with business
people whom he had known and come to trust over many years, such as
Mr . But it would seem that, whilst PV and his companies had
provided services to, and supplied, contracts outside Germany, this venture was
his first foray in his own right outside what, in vernacular terms, might be
described as his ‘comfort zone’ in the German business environment and into the
Czech Republic, a country he had not visited before 1992-1993.!*8He chose to do
so with an untried and untested business partner. , , with whom PV had
never worked before, had, as PV well’knew, no funds of his own to contribute to
the project that he was proposing to PV as an investment.149

124, PV conceded that in the first instance, he had: “trusted [his] instinct and
placed [his] faith and trust” in 's0 Such was his faith in his instinct,
however, that PV carried out only a cursory due diligence on and he
forewent the opportunity to insist upon a controlling interest in the business
venture, so that he could ensure, if need be, that the project proceeded in a way
consistent with his objectives. Instead, he allowed Dr , whom he had
retained as his own adviser, although PV knew that he had long represented
. ; company, KOMFORT,15? to draw up an agreement pursuant to which
PV and “a were to enjoy equal rights and obligations as Directors and
proxies of KUMFORT. Dr ; < himself noted that had PV insisted upon a 51%
stake in KOMFORT, he could have recalled vas a Director and proxy. PV's
decision to proceed on the basis of a 50-50 split with his new partner was an:
“act of generosity"!52,

149 Indeed, PV supported a and his family financially by paying him a
consultancy fee of Cr.35,000 per month anda further Cr,15,000 monthly towards
his accommodation costs, as well as providing him with a car. Other monies were
made available to a from time to time, These monies were said by PV to
have been advanced as “quasi-loans” by MFT-K, but: “no written agreements
[were] established” and no monies have ever been repaid. (See PV Witness
Statements of 18 June 2010 (para.12(f)) and August 2010, p. 8)

125. Notwithstanding the monthly reports that PV required + to submit
and a limit on spending, which did not require prior authorisation trom PV, 153
there were clear warning signs in the course of 1999, notably in August 1999,15+
that the project was in financial difficulty. By the end of 2000, it was impossible
to ignore the fact that, as PV was to acknowledge: “things [had] got out of
control”.155 [n the course of 2000, PV had received ever more heated complaints
from about the effects on the project of ‘drip-feed’ financing by PV.

had also warned that contractors and suppliers would cease work for
lack of payment and that some had threatened proceedings, even bankruptcy
proceedings.t86Yet PV took no steps directly to intervene and to ascertain for
himself whether reports reflected the reality on the ground in Cihelny
or otherwise to seek to assume contro] ofa project which he was funding.

126. It is all the more inexplicable that that should have remained the case
even in the third quarter of 2000, since PV himself told the Tribunal that in
August 2000, Dr! { had put to him a proposal, which, in PV's view, amounted
to a fraud on Sparkasse:
“In August 2000, Dr ( ' presented a planned fraud against Sparkasse
Essen to [PV] in the presence of Dr. 5 [PV's] daughter and Dr

|. The aim of the fraud was to strip ‘Sparkasse Essen of its return
jrom loans it had granted for the purposes of the Golf Resort, and thus to free
the Golf Resort of debts..." (Emphasis added) 157

127. PV stated that he had rejected that proposal out of hand. That may well be
so, but it begs the question why, in light of all of the warning signals in
correspondence and arising out of meetings such as this, still fully a year before

, presented the petition for bankruptcy of KOMFORT, PV failed to satisfy
himself whether or not all was well with the management of KOMFORT. And, to
the extent that it was not, as, on the basis of the concerns that he says that he
had, he must have had good reason to believe might, in fact, be the case, why he
took no immediate steps to seek to retrieve the position. (It must also be pointed
out, however, that Dr proposal would appear to have been submitted in
response to instructions from PV himself in July 2000 to communicate with
Sparkasse Essen and to prepare documentation in connection with a
restructuring of the loans to KOMFORT. (See paragraph 70 above)).

453 Jn the course of his evidence, PV conceded that until the bankruptcy of
KOMFORT, he had been unaware that had spent all the money, because
from mid-2000, certain liabilities were not included in the books reviewed by
PV: “Then, the bankruptcy trustee came with a list of outstanding payments, which
showed me that I should have looked into and which I would have liked to
look into, had I known." (Emphasis added), (See Transcript, Day1, p.168),

128, PV's inability to keep his finger on the pulse was exacerbated, as he
himself acknowledged, by the fact that his visits to the Czech Republic were
irregular and of short duration, even after the breakdown in his relationship
with in mid-2000, In his Statement of Claim?8, PV conceded that his
absence from the scene: “ultimately made it possible [on PV's case] for...

and others, including the Bankruptcy Judge and the Bankruptcy Trustee to perform
(sic) illegal bankruptcy proceedings in respect of KOMFORT.”

129. Whatever might be said about the characterisation of the outcome of PV’s
lack of direct involvement in the Cihelny project, which the Czech Republic
certainly disputed and from which PV himself subsequently, backed away (see
paragraph 132 below), it remains, in the context of the factual record of this case,
a very significant concession by PV, Jt is undeniable that even before the
declaration of bankruptcy of KOMFORT in October 2001, PV's venture in the
Czech Republic was in substantial difficulty. Quite apart from the fact that
KOMFORT had experienced an acute cash flow shortage and that it had come
under considerable pressure from suppliers and contractors in 1999 and 2000:
(i) PV was seeking new investors in late 2000;
(i) in October 2000, the lack of funds had obliged KOMFORT to apply
to the Building Office in Karlovy Vary for a two year extension of time
until 31 December 2002 to complete the Golf Club factlities;
(iii) in November 2000, Sparkasse Essen had been prepared to granta
discharge of all claims against KOMFORT for an immediate payment by a
third party representing a two thirds discount against the book value of
its loans to the MFT Group, together with an assignment of some
insurance policies from PV and his immediate family;
(iv) although it seems that in December 2000, SOLITAER had been
prepared to match any such payment to Sparkasse Essen, that proposal
came to nothing. Instead, in February 2001, Sparkasse had warned PV
that his failure to keep it informed of the transfer of ownership in MFT-K
to SOLITAER and any subsequent failure to “sign agreements associated
with the Czech case” by mid February 2001 would result in the cessation
of the waiver of principal and interest payments afforded by Sparkasse
Essen, a termination of business dealings and moves by the bank to
realize its collateral;
(v) subsequently, Sparkasse Essen had indeed terminated its
relationship with PV and his business interests in April 2001, thereby
depriving him of his principal source of funding; and
(vi) in the context of PV’s German interests, MFT-VA had gone
bankrupt in June 2001359

158 Idem, para.26

159 The Tribunal notes that, as a simple matter of chronology, PV's contention
that the bankruptcy of KOMFORT precipitated a series of events leading
ultimately to the bankruptcy of PV’s German companies is unsustainable. (See
Statement of Claim, para.3: “Because he was not able to start operating the Golf
Course, [PV] could not meet his obligations in Germany, which started a chain
reaction and caused bankruptcy of [PV's] German companies").

37

 

 

130. PV acknowledged that he had taken a risk in embarking on such a project
with albeit that the: “danger that Mr t posed would have been
controllable under normal circumstances. We proceeded against him ... but we
never got anywhere.”160 PV subsequently recognised that some of the problems
affecting the Cihelny Project: “came into existence before KOMFORT was declared
bankrupt, including ... the conclusion of the lease agreement for the golf course and
the loss of control over [Zamecek]." He accepted, too, that: “{T]hese problems were
caused by specific individuals, in particular Mr . z and Dr whose
conduct 1s not attributable to the Czech Republic." But PV contended that
“unlawful” acts, which constituted a: ‘plan for a hostile takeover” of the Golf
Course could not be dismissed and: “reduced to an allegation that [PV] assumed
excessive personal risk by giving away too much freedom and influence over
KOMFORT in favour of [1 ]” Rather, he maintained, fault lay in the failure of
the Czech authorities properly to pursue complaints laid against v and
other individuals.!® He declined to accept the suggestion that: “Mr. took
away your investment in the Czech Republic, didn’t he?” He responded that his
problems had started with the decision of the bankruptcy judge to declare
KOMFORT bankrupt.!6&

131. The Tribunal cannot accept these propositions, not least because they are
at odds with PV's own acknowledgement recorded at paragraph 128 above. PV's
‘hands-off approach to the business of KOMFORT was, to put it no higher, a
significant contributory factor to the difficulties with which he came to be faced.
It left him vulnerable to the actions of others and to the consequences of such
legal and other advice as he might have received and which in a number of
important respects, notably the structure of the 10 November 1994 agreement
and the timely filing of important submissions in the bankruptcy and related civil
and criminal proceedings, proved to be deficient, Furthermore, no criminal
proceedings were formally initiated at PV's instigation until 4 April 2002 (see
paragraph 113 above). And when they were, PV accepted that the correct initial
procedures had been followed and that the police investigations had been:
“thorough, long and extensive”'63 By that time the criminal proceedings got
underway, the die was cast: agreements for the sale of the Golf Course had been
concluded on 21 February 2002, (See paragraph 101 above),

132. In the context of these preliminary remarks, it is appropriate, too, to deal
with PV's allegations that he had been deprived of his investment asa result of a
criminal conspiracy that could not have succeeded, but for the involvement of
the bankruptcy Judge, Mr and the bankruptcy trustee, Dr . Inthe
course of his opening remarks, Counsel for PV accepted that he was unable to
prove that there had been any such conspiracy, although he went on to
suggest that: “even if..... the judge were only used by the conspiracy organisers as

unknowing tools - which given all the facts, | think, it is most unlikely -it would
mean they did not meet their duty of care."165

133. The Tribunal is not minded to proceed on the basis of any ambiguity: it
concludes that there is no evidence of a criminal conspiracy, much less a
conspiracy to which Mr and Dr 1 were parties, whether witting or
otherwise. To the extent that their conduct falls to be scrutinised by this
Tribunal, it will be reviewed on the basis of the available record, no more, no
less. In any event, In light of PV's concession, it follows that PV's allegation that
the Czech Republic breached the provisions of Article 4{1) of the Treaty, by
reason of a failure to protect PV against: “the criminal conspiracy of ‘miscreant
State officials’ and some ‘others’ fincluding Dr ! and * "86 will be
disregarded by the Tribunal. The extent to which, if at all, there was otherwise a
breach of Article 4(1) of the Treaty by the Czech Republic is considered below.

134. Forits part, the Czech Republic has contended that;
“Even two years before any alleged wrongdoing by the Czech Republic,
[PV's] own failure to secure sufficient funds for the development of the
Cihelny Golf Course and a complete lack of planning and foresight, placed
KOMFORT on an irreversible trajectory towards bankruptcy.” ‘67
That is a submission, which, having regard to the evidence in the record and PV's
own concessions, the Tribunal finds compelling. It is difficult to see on what basis
the losses which PV maintains he sustained in connection with his involvement
in the Cihelny Golf Course project can be laid at the door of the Czech Republic,
whether by reason of any failure on its part to honour its obligations under the
Treaty or, indeed, at all, Beyond the unhappy fact that PV was, to a considerable
degree, the author of his own misfortune, he might have grounds for redress
against a number of third parties, including his contractual counterparty,
* his advisers and others, but those are not matters with which this
Tribunal has to concern itself.

135. Even if PV's claim were, in principle, properly to be regarded as a Treaty
claim, there is a number of formidable obstacles.which PV would have to
overcome. First, he must demonstrate that there is an investment within the
terms of the Treaty in respect of which he has standing to bring a claim. Second,
he must demonstrate that those actions of officials in the Czech Republic about
which he has complained were both wrongful and attributable to the Czech
Republic, Third, he must demonstrate that his treatment at the hands of the
Czech Republic constituted a denial of justice or otherwise breached the Treaty.
In the opinion of the Tribunal, PV’s claim fails on all counts,

Is there an Investment?

136. PV maintains that he is an ‘investor’ within the terms of Article 1(3) of the
Treaty and that his qualifying investment, pursuant to Article 1(1)(a) of the
Treaty is in the form of his 50% ownership interest in KOMFORT and
“receivables in respect of the money lent to [KOMFORT)”.‘68

137. .Whilst it is common ground that PV is an investor within the terms of the
Treaty, the extent of his investment Is in dispute. The Czech Republic did not
challenge PV's 50% shareholding in KOMFORT?®9. However, it maintained that
the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over PV's claim to repayment of some Cr.197.2
million loaned to KOMFORT through the MFT Group, first, because PV had failed
to demonstrate that he had a legal or beneficial interest in MFT-K at the time of
the alleged breaches of the Treaty and, second, because the loans to KOMFORT
originated as a bank credit from Sparkasse Essen, Sparkasse Essen lent the
equivalent of some Cr.180 million to MFT Group and various entities in the
Group, which, in turn, lent 197.2 million to KOMFORT Accordingly, maintained
the Czech Republic, the loans to KOMFORT fell squarely within the exclusion
prescribed by the Protocol to the Treaty, namely:
“The claims to money referred to in article1, paragraph (c), include
claims arising from loans in connection with a shareholding which,
in purpose and scope, have the character of a shareholding
(shareholding-like loans). Credits from third parties, for example,
bank credits subject to commercial conditions, shall not be
included hereunder." (Emphasis added)
That being the case, they did not constitute an investment within the terms of
Article 1 of the Treaty. a

PV's Standing

138. As of 1 January 1999, PV owned 76.66% of MFT-VA, which, in turn, owned
100% of MFT-E, the parent company of MFT-K. On the basis of the arrangements
in place unti] 20 December 2000, funding had been made available to KOMFORT
principally by MFT-K. MFT-VA, MFT-E and PV himself had also advanced funds in
the amounts of some Cr.53,754 million, Cr.28.331 million and Cr.26.1 million
respectively. As the Tribunal has noted at paragraphs 73-76 above, a series of
transactions took place between 20 and 27 December 2000, pursuant to which
the arrangements between KOMFORT and its lenders underwent a material

change.

139, First, on 20 December 2000, MFT-VA, MFT-E and PY assigned the entirety
of their interests of Cr.108 million in KOMFORT receivables to MFT-K. MFT-K
thus became the sole MFT entity to which KOMFORT owed money ~ a fact that
KOMFORT confirmed in an Acknowledgement of Debt issued over PV's signature

168 Statement of Claim, para.11
169 Transcript, Day1, p.59
40

 

 

 

   

on 27 December 2000, in which it referred to a total indebtedness to MFT-K of
Cr.217,919.959.

140. _ That same day, MFT-K assigned Cr.120 million of the KOMFORT debt to
Mr > and MFT-E transferred its entire interest in MFT-K to Mr
vehicle, SOLITAER. According to the Commercial Register maintained by the
Regional Court in Pilsen, SOLITAER remains the 100% owner of MFT-K.172

141. Subsequently, on 8 March 2001, MFT-VA's entire ownership interest of
D50,000 in MFT-E was divided into four equal shares of Dm12,500. Three of
those shares went to individuals, namely, PV's daughter, Voecklinghaus,
cee eye al . The fourth was allotted to CIC
Capital- und Immobilien Contor GmbH.
142, As at 8 March 2001, therefore, while PV retained his 76.66% ownership
interest in MFT-VA, MFT-VA had divested itself of its interest in MFT-E and, in
any event, MFT-E had long since divested itself of its interest in MFT-K. Thus,
contended the Czech Republic, PV had no legal ownership interest in the entity to
which all receivables from KOMFORT were awed, In the opinion of the Tribunal,
that submission is plainly right. Accordingly, submitted the Czech Republic, all
KOMFORT owed directly to PV was the Cr. 548,824 (initially claimed as
DM30,000371) claimed by PV {n the bankruptcy.

143. In his submissions to the Tribunal, however, PV maintained that whatever
the ostensible position, he had retained a beneficial interest in MFT-K: the
intervention of SOLITAER had come about on the basis of a ‘Treuhand’
agreement between PV and Mr, .. A second ‘Treuhand’ agreement had
underpinned the transfer of MFT-VA’s interest in MFT-E in March 2001.

Search for new investors in KOMFORT in 2000

144. The genesis of these arrangements was PV's search in late 2000 for new
investors in the Cihelny project, He had approached a longstanding business
associate and friend, Mr ., who, although not interested in the golf
course itself, was interested in becoming Involved in the second (construction)
phase of the development. Mr ‘had a corporate vehicle, SOLITAER, of which
the sole shareholder, under an arrangement with which the Tribunal was to
become familiar, -a ‘Treuhand’ agreement ~ was his brother, Mr.

145. PV told the Tribunal that Mr had been prepared to invest in the
Cihelny project, but on the basis of an interest greater than 50% and provided
that there were security for his investment,!73 Unlike another prospective
investor, Mr _ Mr " was prepared to proceed, notwithstanding an

abortive site visit during the course of which had refused to allow PV
and Mr “access to Zamecek.174
146, Mr requirement for security was the basis of PV’s offer,

subsequently realised in the 27 December 2000 Transfer Agreement, to transfer
the shares of MFT-E in MFT-K to SOLITAER. As he recalled: “! offered to transfer
the shares, that would protect you, and if you were to invest, theoretically, it would
be transferred and this would then be the implementation of your holding.”175

The ‘Treuhand’ Agreements

147. However, prior to entering into the Transfer Agreement, it was the
evidence of both PV and Mr that they had concluded a ‘Treuhand’
agreement ,!t is not disputed that the essence of a ‘Treuhand’ agreement, a
recognised structure in German law, is that the ‘Treugeber’ (principal) transfers
assets to a fiduciary (‘Treuhaender’) to be managed for the principal by the
fiduciary under the ‘Treuhand’ agreement. The fiduciary acts as owner to the
outside world and exercises any and al] rights relating to the ownership of the
assets, but solely and exclusively in compllance with the instructions of the
principal.

148. Although the evidence is not entirely clear, it seems that PV and Mr
spoke over the telephone during the Christmas holiday period in 2000. It was
suggested that they had concluded a ‘silent’ [‘verdeckte’) ‘Treuhand’ agreement
orally over the telephone whilst still in Germany and before they travelled
together to Karlovy Vary to’finalise the documentation by which the terms of the
oral ‘Treuhand’ agreement and those of the agreements intended to give effect to
the underlying ‘Treuhand’ agreement were to be recorded and implemented,
Those agreements were the assignment agreement whereby MFT-K assigned
Cr.120 million of its KOMFORT debt to Mr (see paragraph 75 above) and
the Transfer Agreement of 27 December 2000, pursuant to which MFT-E
transferred its 100% interest in MFT-K to SOLITAER for Cr,11.658 million, (See
paragraph 76). PV stated that he had been “advised by his legal and tax advisers to
draw up [such a ‘Treuhand’] agreement in order to protect [his] investment.”176
Mr told the Tribunal that he had entered into these arrangements on the
basis that he had been: “making a contribution towards securing the fact that this
project would not be lost to [PV].” 177

174 Transcript, Day2, p.37

175 |dem, p.30

176 [n answer to a question from a member of the Tribunal, PV sought to clarify
an earlier explanation, stating that on the basis of their “general experience” (in
Mr “s case, supported by legal advice), “.. we talked on the phone over the
[Christmas 2000] holidays. Mri knew a lawyer that he could phone during that
period of time and, as far as | know, he contacted him and asked him about these
points that we agreed on orally." (See Transcript, Day2, p.19). And see also PV's
evidence at Transcript, Day2, p.13).

177 Transcript, Day3, p.47

 

 

 

 

149, In essence, it was PV's case that the intent behind the ‘Treuhand’
agreement with Mr and the associated formal agreements entered into with
Mr and SOLITAER was that PV would be left as the true beneficial owner,
such that whether or not there had been an ostensible transfer of the ownership
of MFT-K from MFT-E to SOLITAER, there was an agreement as between
principal and fiduciary that the principal could always have the property
transferred back, PV and Mr confirmed that, in fact, Mr ‘never paid the
purchase price for the ownership interest in MFT-K transferred pursuant to the
Transfer Agreement. Nor did he pay for the KOMFORT receivables transferred to
him by MFT-K. For his part, PV stated that, consistent with his understanding of
the position pursuant to the ‘Treuhand’ agreement, he had never intended the
purchase price to be paid. PV stated that it was his “general experience" that if an
ostensible payment obligation in an agreement subject to a ‘Treuhand’ was not
met, then: “transfer back is not a problem ... it’s enough to argue that payment
hasn't been made in order to reverse the transactions." As he saw it: “MFT was
always the owner until everything had been paid."\78Mr confirmed that it had
been his understanding that: “until J pay [the purchase] price, | am not the owner
of a project. .. I don’t know Czech law, but that’s what I was told, so 1 assumed
things would be the same as in German law, ie a transfer is only deemed to have
happened once ! pay.”179

150, It was also said that MFT-E’s shares in MFT-K remained on MFT-E’s books
at all times and never entered the accounting books of SOLITAER. Counsel for PV
submitted that: “there [was] only one plausible explanation: the transfers to
Mr were made as part of a ‘Treuhand’ arrangement under which [PV]
remains the owner and the investor all the time.”18° Further, SOLITAER was said
to have been simply an administrator of PV's interests. While PV had been
formally replaced as Managing Director of MFT-E, his successor, Dr :
worked to his instructions.!81 Thus, it was contended, PV remained the owner
and investor at all times and, through MFT-E, maintained an ownership interest
in MFT-K: *

"The transfer of the [MFT-E] ownership interests in MFT-K to SOLITAER
dated 27 December 2000 did not interrupt [PV's] ownership interests in MFT-K, as
the transfer was effected under a previous Treuhand agreement concluded by and
between [PV] and Mr prior to the transfer of the ownership interests in MFT-
‘Ke

151, If the matter were still in any doubt, maintained PV, that doubt should be
dispelled by the fact that on 2 February 2007, he and Mr had signed an
Agreement on the Cancellation of Agreement on the Transfer of Ownership
Agreement (“the Cancellation Agreement”).183 By that agreement, SOLITAER

acknowledged that it had not paid the consideration of Cr.11.658 million to MFT-
E: “I, SOLITAER has failed to pay the amount of Cr.11,685,000 to [MFT-E]. Both
companies confirm this fact and affirm this fact by fixing their signatures below.”
and that:

“IU ... the legal consequence of the cancellation of the [Transfer Agreement] will
rest (sic) in the restoration of the legal relationships to their status before the time
ofits conclusion, ie, including, without limitation, the fact that SOLITAER has never
become a member of MFT-K Engineering.”

Further, MFT-E and SOLITAER undertook, pursuant to Article 1V of the
Cancellation Agreement: “to provide their coordination necessary to delete
SOLITAER from, and to register [MFT-E] in, the section regarding members of
[MFT-K]”

152. Asecond silent Treuhand’ agreement between PV, his daughter and three
other third parties was said to underpin the assignment of the entirety of MFT-
VA's interest in MFT-E made in March 2001.

153. The Czech Republic invited the Tribunal to reject these submissions. The
Czech Republic pointed out that the existence of the alleged ‘Treuhand’
agreements had only been raised late in the day in PV's Reply.1®4 It maintained
that the evidence of PV and Mr had been vague at best as to when, in fact,
the ‘Treuhand’ agreement in respect of the Transfer Agreement had been
concluded, much less as to what its effective terms or duration were intended to

be.28 The basis of the assertion that the transfer of the MFT-K interest to.

SOLITAER was intended to protect PV’s investment in MFT+K had not been
explained either.

154. Instead, what the Tribunal had to consider was:
@) the acknowledgment by PV that as of 8 March 2001, months before
the alleged breaches of the Treaty by the Czech Republic, he had no legal
ownership in MFT-E or MFT-K.18 Instead, PV mairitained that he had
retained a beneficial ownership interest in MFT-K thereafter by way of
the two asserted ‘Treuhand’ agreements;
(ii) the clear terms of the 27 December 2000 Transfer Agreement,
pursuant to Article 1 of which: “[MFT-5] transfers its entire ownership
interest of 11,658,000 Czech crowns, representing 100per cent of the
registered capital of {MFT-K].... to SOLITAER, which takes it over.”,
(iii) PV’s concession that no other written agreement had been made
after the conclusion of the Transfer Agreement, changing its terms;187
(iv) a complete absence of any written or notarised document or any
other form of documentary evidence to support the existence of either of
the alleged ‘Treuhand’ agreements, notwithstanding numerous references
in the course of the oral evidence of PV and Mr to such an agreement

being drawn up in the context of the Transfer Agreement. (See, for
example, paragraph 148 above and PV's statement that there was a
manuscript document recording the terms of the ‘Treuhand’ agreement
between PV and Mr 88), Indeed, beyond PV’s own evidence, there
was nothing to support the existence of the second ‘Treuhand’ by which
the four third parties who took assignments of MFT-VA’s ownership
interest in MFT-E were said to have held those interests on trust for PV. In
short, in the absence of proof of the existence of either of the ‘Treuhand’
agreements, PV could demonstrate neither a legal nor a beneficial interest
in MFT-K at the time of the alleged breaches of the Treaty by the Czech
Republic;

(v) the fact that the second alleged oral ‘Treuhand’ agreement
between PV, bis daughter and three other third parties was said to have
been concluded on 16 March 2001, eight days after the operative transfer
by MFT-VA of its interest in MFT-E;18?

(vi) no evidence had been adduced to support the assertion that the
MFT-K shares remained on MFT-E’s books; and

(vii) _ the fact that by virtue of the 8 March 2001 transfer by MFT-VA of
its entire interest in MFT-E, there remained nothing to connect MFT-K to
MFT-VA, through which company, PV maintained his entitlement to
pursue a claim in respect of the MFT-K receivables,

The Critical Defects in the Evidence Relating to the Terms of the ‘Treuhand’
Agreements

155. It was further argued by the Czech Republic that German law required
that key terms of a ‘Treuhand’ agreement, notably the specific duties of the
fiduciary, to be agreed. Mr had been unable to describe to the Tribunal what
those duties were said to be with any degree of specificity.’ Further, the failure
to reduce to writing and to notarlse a ‘Treuhand’ agreement made in respect of a
transfer of shares in a limited liability company rendered it invalid pursuant to
the provisions of $,15(4) of the German Limited Liability Companies Act, which
date back to 1892.19

156. PV disputed that contention on the basis that first, both ‘Treuhand’
agreements ante-dated the Order of the German Federal Supreme Court of 12
December 2005, and accordingly, there was no requirement that they should be
in writing and notarised.19%Second, PV contended that the notarisation
requirement was not binding on transfers of ownership Interests in a Czech

company (MFT-K), as opposed to a German company. Jt was therefore
inapplicable to the ‘Treuhand’ agreement between PV and Mr 8

157. The Tribunal is not persuaded by PV’s submission. First, both of these i
asserted ‘Treuhand’ agreements, which he has conceded, most recently in his |
Post-Hearing Brief,1°* were oral agreements, are governed by German law, albeit |
that the subject matter of one of them is a Czech limited company. Second, the if
German jurisprudence on the subject and reflected in the Federal Supreme ro
Court's Order of 12 December 2005 is both consistent and longstanding - and it ‘
pre-dates both of the ‘Treuhand’ agreements upon which PV seeks to rely.

158. PV argued, that even if the Tribunal were to determine that the effect of Poy
the German legislation was to require a ‘Treuhand’ agreement involving a

transfer of shares in a limited liability company to be in writing and notarised, eo]
the arrangements that he put in place were not in contravention of the |
requirements of S.15(4) of the German Limited Liability Companies Act. He t |
suggested that because the form of the final agreement (the Transfer \
Agreement), which was the product of the obligations undertaken by PV and Mr \

under their ‘Treuhand’ agreement corresponded with the form of the oral \

‘Treuhand’ agreement, he is entitled to avail himself of an exemption. But such an
exemption would only be available, as PV’s own submission recognises (see
footnote 193 below}, if the asserted oral ‘Treuhand’ Agreement was concluded t
before the substantive agreement giving effect to its terms.

159. Even assuming in PV's favour that that were true of the ‘Treuhand’
agreement between Mr and PV, it is not the case, so far as the asserted
second ‘Treuhand’ agreement is concerned. It is not in dispute that that
agreement post-dated the transfer of MFT-VA’s interest in MFT-E to the putative
fiduciaries. Accordingly, the Tribunal accepts the submission of the Czech 1
Republic that the second ‘Treuhand’ agreement is void ab initio. If that is so, it
follows that it confers no form of beneficial ownership in MFT-E (and through
MFT-E, in MFT-K) upon PV at the time of the alleged breaches of the Treaty by
the Czech Republic in and after October 2001.195

The Cancellation Agreement

160. So far as the Cancellation Agreement was concerned, the Czech Republic
submitted that, quite apart from the technical defect that it had not been
notarised (resulting in its invalidity in any event as a matter of Czech Law), that
agreement could not cancel a sale that had been perfected pursuant to the 27
December 2000 Transfer Agreement. The relevant provision is Section 572,
para.2 of the Czech Civil Code, which provides that:

“Parties may agree that an outstanding obligation or its part shall be cancelled,
without establishing a new obligation at the same time. Unless agreed otherwise,

the cancelled obligation ceases to exist when the offer ofits cancellation is accepted
by the other party.” (Emphasis added).

161. PV submitted that even if the Cancellation Agreement could not have
retroactive effect (which he disputed), the issue was “irrelevant”. The transfer of
the ownership interest in MFT-K in-December 2000 was “only to document the
position of the [fiduciary] (‘Treuhaender’) vis-a-vis third parties”. Similarly, the
purpose of the Cancellation Agreement was “only ... to terminate the position of
the [fiduciary] vis-a-vis third parties.” What the Cancellation Agreement did not
do, according to PV, was cancel the underlying ‘Treuhand’ agreement between

PVand Mr’ + that would only cease to exist when the assets the subject of the

‘Treuhand’ agreement had been transferred back to the principal {i.e., PY), thus

fulfilling the objectives of the ‘Treuband' agreement.19¢

162, The Tribunal is not persuaded by that submission. First, it has not been
established what the terms of the asserted ‘Treuhand’ agreement between PV
and Mr * were. Second, it contradicts PV’s own submission (see paragraph
158 above) that the Transfer Agreement faithfully reflected the terms of the
underlying ‘Treuhand’ agreement -which begs the question: what would be left,
once the Transfer Agreement had been cancelled? Third, even if, contrary to the
plain terms of the Cancellation Agreement, the effect of the Cancellation
Agreement had been to transfer the ownership of MFT-K back to MFT-£ as
at 27 December 2000 rather than 2 February 2007, the terms ofthe 8 March
2001 assignment of MFT-VA’s interest in MFT-E to Voecklinghaus and

others would remain in effect. PV would still be unable to demonstrate a legal

interest in MFT-K at the time of the alleged Treaty. breaches by the Czech

Republic in and after October 2001, Nor has PV satisfied the Tribunal that he had
a beneficial interest in MFT-K at the relevant time either,

163. Whilst it appears that SOLITAER never paid for the ownership interest in
MFT-K, PV conceded that the transfer had taken place and that, so far as the
outside world was concerned, throughout the period from 27 December 2000
until February 2007 - and even as at June 2010 - the Pilsen Regional Court -
Commercial Register entry for MFT-K19%7 showed that the ownership of MFT-K
was vested in SOLITAER.198

164, On the plain terms of the Cancellation Agreement, there is no suggestion
that it was intended to have retrospective effect (even if, as a matter of Czech
Jaw, it could). First, the CancelJation Agreement records that the 100%
ownership interest of MFT-E in MFT-K was transferred pursuant to the Transfer
Agreement and that-the transfer was duly registered, (Article 1). Second, Article
IM of the Cancellation Agreement provides that its cancellation is to be:

“effective as of the execution hereof.” (ie on 2 February 2007). Third, the Parties
undertook to amend the register-to reflect the re-registration of MFT-E. (To date,
itseems that that has yet to be done).

165. The Tribunal concludes that PV retained no legal or beneficial ownership
interest In MFT-K after 8 March 2001, some seven months prior to the
bankruptcy of KOMFORT and any alleged wrongdoing by the Czech Republic,
Accordingly, the Tribunal holds that it has no jurisdiction to hear PV’s claims in
respect of receivables owed to MFT-K by KOMFORT.

Do the Receivables owed to MFT-K by KOMFORT qualify as an Investment
under the Treaty?

166. Even if the Tribunal had found that PV had an ownership interest in MFT-
K at the time of the alleged breaches of the Treaty by the Czech Republic, it
would have been obliged to consider whether it could properly exercise
jurisdiction over the receivables owed by KOMFORT to MFT-K, given their
provenance.

167. In his Statement of Claim, PV contended that he had invested some
Cr, 251,196,071 in the Czech Republic. He acknowledged that he had: “received
part of the money from credits granted by Sparkasse Essen” ~ to the extent of some
Cr. 180 million, between 1994 and 1999, However, the credit agreements were
not concluded between Sparkasse Essen and KOMFORT, “.. but exclusively with
companies controlled by [PV]."19° PV refuted any suggestion that the loans made
by Sparkasse Essen were, in fact, loans granted to KOMFORT and therefore that
they were denied protection pursuant to the Treaty to the extent that those loans
had been used to finance PV's investment in the Czech Republic. The Protocol
exemption, contended PV, operated to preclude the extension of: “investment
protection over banks of one party whose loans are not repaid by business entities
having the nationality of the other party,"200!n this case, PV had drawn loans
from Sparkasse Essen and then used those loans.himself to finance his
investment.

168. In the course of his opening remarks at the Hearing, Counsel for PV
explained that the “original idea” had indeed been: .

“to finance the construction of the Cihelny Golf Course by direct loans from
Sparkasse Essen. However, Sparkasse Essen refused such an arrangement and
instead loans were extended to [PV's] German companies.?% As a result, it was
[PV's] German companies that extended loans to KOMFORT, not Sparkasse Essen ...
The loans from Sparkasse Essen were secured by liens over real estate of [PV]
located in Germany and by [PV's] personal guarantee, not hy KOMFORT’s assets ...
[PV] settled his obligations vis-a-vis Sparkasse Essen in the meantime even without
proceeds from the operation of the golf course Cihelny. This further shows the
separate nature of the loans provided by Sparkasse Essen to [PV's] group on the

one hand and the loans provided by [PV's] companies to KOMFORT on the other
hand. In summary, the loans to KOMFORT came from the MFT Group, not from
Sparkasse, and, as such, they are protected by the [Treaty].”202(Emphasis added).
Accordingly, it was submitted, the loans drawn from Sparkasse and the Joans
made to KOMFORT were not identical - a “fact [that] had not been disproved at
the hearing”,203

169. Ona careful analysis of the materials in the record, however, the Tribunal
concludes that the distinction that PV sought to draw is a distinction without a
difference: While Sparkasse Essen funds may well have been channelled through
PV and his MFT Group of companies, there is no room for doubt that those funds
were applied directly to KOMFORT and the Cijhelny' project. As’ PV’s expert
Mr Sima noted, the loans obtained from Sparkasse Essen had been for the special
purpose of financing the development of the Cihelny Golf Course.?04 Sparkasse
Essen itself said as much in a letter written to PV in February 2011.25 PV's own
Statement of Claim recorded that the purpose of the credits was: “from the
beginning, to build a Golf Resort; Sparkasse Essen continuously monitored
their utilization for this purpose, (on the one hand by releasing the money only
based upon the presentation of invoices concerning the construction, on the other
hand, by on-site monitoring)” (Emphasis added). And in evidence to the
Tribunal, PV himself confirmed that he had told Sparkasse Essen that the money
that he was borrowing would be invested in the Czech Republic.207

170, The extent of Sparkassse Essen’s direct day-to-day involvement in the
Cihelny project is evident, too, from correspondence in May 2000, in
the course of which, he roundly criticised Sparkasse Essen as an “unreliable
partner” by reason of its delay in making funds available (see paragraph 67
above); by the discussions relating to the refinancing of KOMFORT intended to
settle Sparkasse Essen’s claims against KOMFORT (see paragraphs 70-77 above):
and PV's avowed rejection of the fraud that he alleged that Dr was
proposing to perpetrate on Sparkasse Essen in August 2000 and which,
according to PV was intended: “to strip Sparkasse Essen of its return from
loans it had granted for the purposes of the Golf Resort, and thus to free the
Golf Resort of debts...’ (See paragraph 126 above).

171. As was apparent from the correspondence between Sparkasse Essen and
PV in February 2001, Sparkasse Essen’s threat to withdraw its credit lines to PV
and the MET Group (a threat, which it duly carried out in April 2001) related
directly to concerns about the status of the Cihelny project months before the
bankruptcy of KOMFORT and any intervention by the Czech Republic of which
PV now complains, (See paragraph 79 above}.208

172. On the basis of the evidence before it, the Tribunal is satisfied as a matter
of fact that the loans provided to KOMFORT and which constitute receivables
owed to MFT-K arose out of a bank credit made available by Sparkasse Essen,
which was raised by PV for the express purpose of the development of the
Cihelny golf course project. In the opinion of the Tribunal, such a credit falls
squarely within the exclusion provisions of Article 1 of the Protocol, which
provides that; “... Credits from third parties, for example, bank credits subject to
commercial conditions, shall not be included hereunder.”

The purpose of the Treaty Protocol is to avoid investments by under capitalized
investors, who have to resort to significant external funding in order to develop
and sustain their investment. This is such a case: Sparkasse Essen was the source
of over 90% of the financing for the Cihelny Project. Accordingly, that financing
does not qualify as a protected investment under the terms of the Treaty.

173. For the sake of completeness, the Tribunal notes that even if it had
concluded that the Sparkasse Essen bank credit constituted a protected
investment, any claim by PV ought properly to reflect, and give credit for, the
terms of the settlement agreements that he concluded with Sparkasse Essen in
2003 and 2005, the existence of which first became apparent on Day 2 of the
Hearing in this Arbitration.29? Under the terms of the latter (2005) agreement,
PV's liabilities to Sparkasse Essen were settled for Euros 2.736 million, some
23% of the outstanding lability - as PV put it, a “cancellation of the loan that I
got"210 And as the evidence has established, that loan was applied to the
development of the Cihelny project.

‘The alleged breaches of the Treaty by the Czech Republic.

174, Had PV established (a) that he had standing to bring his claim before this
Tribunal and (b) that that claim related to an investment susceptible to the
protections afforded by the Treaty, he would have had to demonstrate that the
Czech Republic had acted in breach of its obligations under the Treaty. The
premise upon which PV grounds his claim is that he was subject to an immediate
denial of justice as a result of the non-appealable declaration of bankruptcy of

208 PV's pleaded case - Reply, para. 9 ~ that Sparkasse Essen was not exerting any
pressure on PV to repay his debts immediately and that it was the bankruptcy of
KOMFORT and the sale of the golf course, allegedly at an undervalue, that
precipitated the forced sales of PV’s property in Germany is difficult to reconcile
with this evidence, *

KOMFORT by Judge in October 2001: “If [PV] failed to exhaust local
remedies in some other proceedings such as with regard to the decision deleting
KOMFORT from the Commercial Registry, {t is simply irrelevant from the point of
view of expropriation, which was completed by that time.”211

175. PV complained that by reason of:
i Judge 's declaration that KOMFORT was bankrupt;
(ii) the subsequent decision of the bankruptcy Trustee to proceed toa
sale of KOMFORT’s assets by public auction: and
(iii) the deletion thereafter of KOMFORT from the Commercial

Register,
he had been denied:

() _ his rights to fair and equitable treatment pursuant to Article 2(1)
of the Treaty: :

(i) his rights to non-impairment pursuant to Article 2(2) of the
Treaty; and

(ili) his investment had been expropriated pursuant to Article 4(2) of
the Treaty; and, further,

{iv) the failure of the Czech authorities properly to pursue PV's
criminal complaints constituted a breach of the Czech Republic's
obligation to afford an investor full protection and security
pursuant to Article 4(1) of the Treaty,

176, PV submitted that KOMFORT was not, in fact, bankrupt in October 2001
and the declaration by Judge that it was constituted: “the first breach of
international law.”212 Acknowledging that: “simple breaches of duty of care by the
trustee and the judge are not necessarily enough to constitute breaches of
international law”, it was further submitted on behalf of PV that the: “importance
of these breaches was such as to be clear violations of international law."218

The Conduct of Judge

177. PV criticised the fact that Judge took only two working days to
determine the bankruptcy of KOMFORT on the basis of two disparate
receivables, That, PV argued, amounted to: “a strong indication that [he] was not
doing what he was supposed to be doing."*\4PV further suggested that: “had the ,
bankruptcy judge communicated with [PV], he would have easily ascertained that
the prerequisites for declaration of bankruptcy [had not been) met.”215Moreover,
contended PV, Judge : decisions and the reasons upon which he based
them were not transparent, The judge had compounded his initial error in
declaring KOMFORT bankrupt by his subsequent failures:

@) to accept MFT-K's application to be appointed the Creditors’

Representative;
(ii) his “wrongful frustration of composition with creditors”; and
(iii) his failure to supervise the bankruptcy Trustee, Dr 216
178, The Tribunal does not accept that those criticisms of Judge are well
founded.
The Bankruptcy Petition

179, The Tribunal set out at paragraph 84 above the circumstances and the
basis upon which the petition for the declaration of bankruptcy of KOMFORT
was filed by He, as a Director and proxy of KOMFORT, had lawful
authority to file the petition, as, indeed, the Czech Supreme Court was to hold,
(See paragraph 105 above). The Supreme Court found that PV's contentions
relating to a director’s authority to file a bankruptcy petition were “clearly
inaccurate” and inconsistent with Czech law.?!7 The petition was sufficient as to
form and content in that it certified bankruptcy and listed assets. The Czech
Republic pointed out that, consistent with rulings of the Czech courts, affirmed
by the Suprerne Court,28 a debtor has a lower standard to satisfy than a creditor
in filing a declaration of bankruptcy: a declaration was deemed sufficient, if it
cited circumstances leading to the logical conclusion that the debtor was
bankrupt. On its face, the petition was in conformity with the provisions of S.4-of.
the Bankruptcy Act. Judge had no reason to go behind the terms of the
petition, much Jess to make additional enquiry of PV of his own volition, as PV
suggests he should have done. (See paragraph 177 above).

180. The Regional Court had 10 working days within which to certify the
petition and declare KOMFORT bankrupt, It complied with that requirement. The
fact that it acted quickly is not of itself indicative of a denial of justice. Judge

3 decision as set out in the Resolution of 19 October 20012!9was
sufficiently reasoned and sufficient notice of his decision was given. PV conceded
that notice was sent to him, but to V's address, rather than his own. As
became apparent in the course of Dr } 's examination??°, no attempt was
ever made by PV to change his address for service, notwithstanding the
breakdown in the relationship between him and; . No fault attaches to the
Regional Court in that regard. In any event, as is clear from the record, PV
actively participated in the process, registered a claim, albeit not in conformity
with the requirements, and attended the First Review Meeting.

181. Norcan Judge ‘be criticised for his appointment of Dr from
the list of bankruptcy Trustees maintained by the Court. Her appointment was in
conformity with the usual procedures and it has not been suggested that there
were any conflicts of interest that she failed to disclose or any other matters that

 

might have precluded her from The al ofa
conspiracy involving, inter alia, Judge and Dr have not been
pursued,

182. PV has disputed, too, the appointment of 3 Princova as the Creditors’
Representative. But the fact is that 3 Princova had registered a timely,
substantiated claim in conformity with the prescribed guidelines and its claim
had been recognised before the election of the-Creditors’ Representative. It was
also represented at the Creditors’ meeting. In contrast, MFT-K’s/PV’s claims
were submitted nearly a month late, such that they were received by the Court
on 10 December 2003, less than 48 hours before the 12 December 2001 First
Review Meeting. Neither submission provided sufficient substantiation and PV's
claim did not conform with the requirement that it be denominated in Czech
crowns. In such circumstances, it lies ill in the mouth of PV to rebuke the Court
for failing to exercise any discretion in his favour by granting special voting
rights to PV or MFT-K to elect the Creditors’ Representative. The fact is that his
claim and that of MFT-K were subsequently recognised (as, eventually, was that
of Mr when appropriate substantiation was provided.?21In all the
circumstances, the Tribunal rejects the suggestion that the refusal by the
Regional Court to register the claims of PV, Mr ‘and MFT-K in the form in
which they were submitted prior to the First Review Meeting constituted a
denial of justice or violation of due process, as PV claims.

Failure to supervise the Bankruptcy Trustee and the Liability of the Czech
Republic for the Actions of the Trustee

183, PV's principal complaint against the bankruptcy Trustee was that he did
not consider her competent to manage a golf resort.222[n her reliance upon
inapposite expert valuations and by pressing ahead with a rushed sale by public
tender, rather than an auction, PV maintained that she had failed to maximize the
return on the assets of KOMFORT.223 PV further contended that the Regional
Court was at fault for failing to appoint a trustee who was competent.

184. As a preliminary point, the latter complaint is difficult to follow. The
suggestion seems to be that Dr. i alleged lack of due professional care,
demonstrated by her conduct in this’ case, ought to have been a factor weighed
by the Court in determining whether to register Dr on the list of
bankruptcy Trustees in the first place, The fact that an individual was included
on the list was a guarantee of quality.?24 It is not for this Tribunal to attempt to

221 See footnote 109 above

223 Statement of Claim, para. 225
224 PV Post-Hearing Brief, para. 67

‘second guess’ the basis of Dr original inclusion on the list. The fact is
that she was on the list at the’ material time and Judge appointed her,
having referred to the Jist in the normal way.

185. PV maintained that the responsibility of the Czech Republic had been
engaged, first, because the Czech Republic was responsible for court-reviewed
acts of bankruptcy trustees (and the Regional Court had failed in its oversight
duties). Second, because bankruptcy trustees are state organs, regarded as
public bodies ‘sui generis’.

186. As to the first of those points, and contrary to PV’s submissions, the
Tribunal finds that the Regional Court, having appointed Dr from the
list of registered bankruptcy trustees, was astute to act in accordance with well
established practice in leaving the bankruptcy Trustee to determine how to deal
with claims in the review hearing and which claims to accept or reject.225 While
the Regional Court was supportive of the bankruptcy Trustee’s decision to
proceed by way of public tender (see paragraph 96 above), it did not seek to
intervene in the process,

187, As to the second, the Tribunal accepts the submission by the Czech
Republic that decisions of the Constitutional Court and the Supreme Court of the
Czech Republic have upheld the proposition that no liability attaches to the State,
whether under Czech civil or criminal law, for the conduct of the bankruptcy
Trustee.??6In this regard, the decision of the Supreme Court of 22 April 2004 in,
Ref. No, 29 Cdo 3064/2000 is instructive. In that case, an action was brought
against the Czech Republic to recover damages caused by the failure of a
bankruptcy trustee to exclude certain real estate from a list of bankruptcy assets,
Acknowledging that bankruptcy trustees were public bodies ‘sui generis’, the
Supreme Court ruled that bankruptcy trustees were not state organs or bodies of
state administration and accordingly, the Czech Republic was not responsible for
their acts or omissions. A bankruptcy trustee was always personally liable for his
or her actions and had standing to be sued for damage caused by those acts or
omissions, The Supreme Court further held that recovery for damages caused by
a bankruptcy trustee may only be sought direct from the bankruptcy trustee
under the general provisions of the Czech Civil Code which govern private legal

relationships,

188. There is no support either for PV’s position in JLC Articles 4 and 5.
Decisions of international tribunals confirm that acts of a ‘state organ’ (the status
of which is to be determined first pursuant to domestic law) are attributable to a
state pursuant to Article 4 only in circumstances where there is clear evidence

that the entity acts as the state and not as a commercial or private entity.227 It is
not in dispute that pursuant to S.7 of the Bankruptcy Act, a bankruptcy trustee
does not represent, and is independent of, the Czech Republic and that the
trustee has an independent position in the bankruptcy process, Pursuant to S.8
of the Act, the Trustee has personal liability for her actions (for which she must.
carry insurance) and she does not benefit from any sovereign immunity
attaching to the Czech Republic, There is no requirement that she should be a
government employee and, indeed, her remuneration is not in the form ofa state
salary, but is derived from the proceeds of sale of the assets. Her duties are not
legislative, executive, judicial or regulatory in nature (S.18(1&2); $.30(1); and
$.4(4) of the Act) and she does not exercise governmental functions or sit within
the governmental hierarchy (S.28(1)). Her acts are akin to commercial acts of
managers or accountants of private corporations. (S.14a; S$.18(1&2); S.27;
$.30(1); and $.44(4)).

189. Nor is there anything in Czech law, which authorises a bankruptcy trustee
to exercise elements of governmental authority pursuant to ILC Article 5. It
would be necessary to demonstrate that a domestic Jaw in the Czech Republic
specifically authorised a bankruptcy trustee to undertake public functions and
further that the act complained of arose out of the exercise of that delegated
governmental] function.?28 The Bankruptcy Act affords no authorisation to a
bankruptcy trustee to undertake public functions: the trustee’s role is limited to
safeguarding and selling the bankrupt entity's assets.

190, Butall of that is predicated on,the basis that the actions of the bankruptcy
Trustee had gone beyond “normal errors” for which PV accepted that the Czech
Republic would not be liable in any event.??9 In answer to a question from a
member of the Tribunal, Dr . acknowledged with candour that she might
have made some mistakes.230 But there is nothing in the record to suggest that
she acted improperly or irrationally in her review and recognition of claims - to
the contrary, it appears that she reviewed them with some diligence. See, for
example, paragraphs 90, 93 and footnote 109 above.

191, {n the opinion of the Tribunal, the reasonableness or otherwise of her
actions must be viewed in the context of a situation in which she had barely
Cr, 29,450 cash in hand,231 The proposal that the assets be disposed of by way of
a public tender rather than by auction arose out Dr : view that matters
needed to be resolved quickly, but the proposal was put to, and discussed with,

the Creditors’ Representative, 3 Princova, and the Judge.?32 The minimum price
set for the tender was fixed on the basis of negotiations with the creditors and it
was established that it should be not less than Cr. 48 million, with Cr, 20 million
to be put down as security in order to deter frivolous bids.

192, Her principal concern, quite properly, was to ensure that the bankruptcy
estate did not deteriorate. She understood that winterisation - a matter
emphasised in the petition for bankruptcy itself - was a priority: “One of the tasks
of a bankruptcy trustee [Is] to make sure that the value of the assets is not
Jower."233 It is true that Dr _. 1 placed some reliance upon the advice and
recommendations of . _ not least, so far as the commissioning of Temple to
undertake the winterisation works at what PV now suggests was a material
overcharge was concerned. But it is equally true that it weighed with her, quite
apart from .S recommendation, that Temple was prepared to wait for
payment: she had not been in a position to make an advance payment or an
immediate payment once the particular works were complete.23+ As the Czech
Republic pointed out, it is hardly for PV to be heard to complain that Dr’

placed any reliance upon the recommendations or guidance of’ when he
himself had afforded such latitude in the course of the project.235

193, It must also be recalled that the conduct of the bankruptcy Trustee was
the subject of both separate civil proceedings brought subsequently by PV, by.
KOMFORT and by MFT-K and of a criminal investigation initiated by PV. None of
the civil claims was pursued, although both PV and MFT-K had the opportunity
to refile them. KOMFORT’s claim was dismissed by the District Court in Pilsen-
mesto in August 2007, following the deletion of KOMFORT from the Commercial
register (See paragraphs 108 ~ 110 above). The criminal} investigation involving

was protracted, but no,proceedings ever ensued. (See paragraph
a0 above),

194. Having regard to all the circumstances, the Tribunal concludes that the
conduct of the bankruptcy Trustee, Dr? , was not such as to amount to a
contravention of her obligations under Czech law, much less conduct giving rise
to a colorable claim for a breach of international law.

The Composition Proceedings

195, The Tribunal has outlined the history of these proceedings at paragraphs
102-104 above. It was submitted on behalf of the Czech Republic that the
application came far too late - on the last day before the closing.date for the
posting of tender bid deposits and some six days before the sealed bids were to
be opened. PV: acknowledged that the application could have been filed

sooner?36, but there was no reason why the sale could not have been postponed,
thereby avoiding the low recovery attendant upon a distressed sale: PV was
offering 100% satisfaction to other creditors (as opposed to the 6.8% recovery
which resulted from the actual sale).237He complained that he should not have
been refused and he should have been afforded more time to correct any
deficiencies,

196. The Tribunal rejects those criticisms, It is clear that the Regional Court
dealt promptly with the application and that it afforded PV an opportunity to
supplement his application in order to provide further information that the
Court thought necessary to its deliberations. When he failed to do so within the
deadline fixed by-the Court, the application was rejected. The matter was
remitted to the Regiona) Court following an appeal to the High Court in Prague
and finally denied on grounds, which have not since been challenged.

197. Finally, in order to complete the picture, so far as Judge is
concerned, the Tribunal notes that the Ministry of Justice afforded PV and MFT-K
an opportunity to refile a claim made against the judge direct to the Ministry in
February 2004, but it appears that that claim was not pursued.

Deletion of KOMFORT from the Commercial Registry: 31 March 2007

198. PV maintains that the deletion of KOMFORT from the Commercial
Register similarly frustrated his legitimate expectations; that it was not
transparent and not predictable. The principal basis of his objection was that
whilst it was perfectly possible to delete from the Register a company, which had
no assets, KOMFORT had outstanding recefvables from and from the
bankruptcy Trustee.

199. PV contended that that was a matter of which the Register Court was
aware before it dealt with the petition filed by . However, it was
conceded by PV that: “perhaps the court did not have an obligation to take this
information into account under Czech law when it received it outside the petition
to delete KOMFORT, but it did have it and its formalistic approach certainly did not
demonstrate good faith and attention to due process according to international
standards,” In PV's view, the approach of the Register Court had been “deficient”
and had allowed . to avoid a claim for Cr. 150 million.738

200. The Czech Republic dismissed that complaint. It noted that the Register
Court had observed the requisite procedures; the application had been made in
full conformity with procedural requirements; the decision of the Register
Court?3?, albeit not fully reasoned (it was not required to be pursuant to the
provisions of the s.169(2) of the Code of Civil Procedure) provided PV with an

adequate basis to understand the basis upon which KOMFORT had been deleted
from the Register; and it set out the basis upon which the decision might be
appealed, No such appeal was filed and so the decision became effective on 31
March 2007. Accordingly, the decision had been, both transparent and
predictable.240 The Tribunal agrees,

The Duty to Provide Fair and Equitable Treatment

201. On the basis of its analysis, the Tribunal concludes that the conduct of
Judge the bankruptcy Trustee and that of the Czech courts and criminal
investigation authorities could not be said to have fallen short of the criteria
enunciated by the Tribunal in the Saluka case41, namely:
“A foreign investor protected by the Treaty may in any case properly expect
that the Czech Republic implements its policies bona fide by conduct that is,
so far as it affects the investor's investment, reasonably justifiable by public
policies and that such conduct does not manifestly violate the requirements
of is transparency, handedness and nondiscrimination.”

202, {n the opinion of the Tribunal, PV was subject to no more and no less than
a proper and consistent application of the laws of the Czech Republic. There is no
evidence to support an allegation that PVs legitimate expectations had not been
met. As Counsel for the Czech Republic put it:
‘This is simply a case alleging that the Czech Republic failed to fulfil its
obligation of law. There [is] no proof of that and the faithful application of
{a] host state's law will not ground a claim. [PV] cannot point to any
authority to suggest that he could have had an expectation that he would be
treated in any way other than as the law provides. This also is not a case in
which there is a change of law about which he is complaining. It ts simply a
question of the application of the host state’s law and the faithful
application of the host state's law will not ground a claim ... [PV's}
legitimate expectations were met because the Czech Republic faithfully
applied Czech law by declaring KOMFORT bankrupt, approving 3 Princova
as the Creditors’ Representative, approving the public tender, rejecting
[PV's] application for mandatory composition and deleting KOMFORT from
the Commercial Register."242

No Impairment of PV's Investment Through Arbitrary Measures

203. PV's case, asserting a breach of Article 2(2) of the Treaty, was put on the
basis that he would show that the conduct of the Czech Republic had “certainly
[been] arbitrary**3", He cited the decisions in the Noble Ventures case®4+ and in

Genin*4 the former, which followed the decision of the International Court of
Justice in ELSI, holding that ‘arbitrary’ conduct amounted to:

“a wilful disregard of due process of law, an act which shocks, or at least surprises,
a sense ofjudicial propriety.”

In Genin, the Tribunal held that in order to constitute arbitrary conduct:

“any procedural irregularity that may have been present would have to amount to
bad faith, a willful disregard for due process of law, or an extreme insufficiency of
action."

204. While the Tribunal recognises that PV's investment in the Czech Republic
has been lost, it does not accept that that is attributable In any way to arbitrary
conduct on the part of the Czech Republic, For the reasons that have been set out
at length in this Award, there was nothing arbitrary about the declaration of
bankruptcy; the sale of the golf course; or the deletion of KOMFORT from the
Commercial Registry. Certainly no evidence has been adduced of any act or
omission that might even arguably be attributed to the Czech Republic that
might properly be described as bad faith, a wilful disregard for due process or an
extreme insufficiency of action. There is equally no evidence of any peremptory
change in the law or that those laws and their application were anything other
than stable, transparent and predictable. There is, in short, no evidence to
support the allegation that the Czech Republic harmed PV's investment by means
of arbitrary or discriminatory measures.

No Denial of Justice and No Expropriation

205. It is well accepted that any investment claim tribunal faced with an
allegation of ‘denial of justice’ must be astute to avoid the assumption of the role
of a court of appeal over foreign domestic courts. It is equally well established
that mere judicial error, even if it results in serious injustice, does not amount to
a denial of justice in the context of a Treaty claim.246

206, In the words of the Tribunal in the Loewen case, a party seeking to
establish a substantive denial of justice must show “manifest injustice” or ‘gross
unfairness’, a “flagrant and inexcusable violation” in which “bad faith, not judicial
error, seems to be the heart-of the matter’24” and that there has been a failure of
the judicial system as a whole, such that:

“"[ the] investor that fails to exercise his rights within a legal system, or exercises his
rights unwisely’248 cannot be heard to complain that he has suffered a denial of
justice at the hands of the state in question.

207. There can be no doubt PV was afforded very wide access to the Czech'civi)
and criminal judicial system. However, it is equally clear from the record in this
Arbitration that he did not avai] himself of all available local remedies - or else to
the extent that he did so, submissions were, on occasion, late or incomplete or
both. .

208. The Tribunal has considered PV's allegations of a denial of justice with
great care, It has done so, not least, with the conclusion of the Tribunal in the
Mondev case in mind, namely: -

“The test is not whether a particular result is surprising, but whether the shock or
surprise occasioned to an impartial tribunal leads, on reflection, to justified
concerns as to the judicial propriety of the outcome bearing in mind on the one
hand that international tribunals are not courts of appeal and on the other...
[treaties for the protection of investments are] intended to provide a real measure
of protection. In the end, the question is whether at an international level, and
having regard to generally accepted standards of the administration of justice a
tribunal can conclude in the light of all the available facts that the impugned
decision was clearly improper and discreditable."249

209, Thatis a far cry from this case: none of the decisions of Czech tribunals or
the Czech criminal investigation authorities reviewed in the course of this Award
could be described as “clearly improper’ or “discreditable" on any objective
analysis. Accordingly, the Tribunal rejects the complaint that PV suffered a denial
of justice in the Czech Republic.

PV's Claims for Damages
210, On the basis of the findings in this Award, none of PV's claims has

succeeded. Accordingly, no entitlement to damages, whether as claimed or
otherwise, arises.

J. costs.

211. Pursuant to Article 38 of the UNCITRAL Rules, it is incumbent upon the
Tribunal to fix the costs of the arbitration, Article 40(1) of the Rules provides
that, in principle, the costs of the arbitration shall be borne by the unsuccessful
Party, subject to the Tribunal's discretion to apportion such costs between the
Parties, taking into account the circumstances of the case. Article 40(2) affords
the Tribunal a further discretion in respect of any Order for costs that it might
make in respect of the costs of the successful Party,

212, The Czech Republic has been entirely successful in its defence of PV's
claims, Pursuant to the terms of Procedural Order No.1 herein, advances in
respect of the fees and expenses of the members of the Tribunal were to be
shared equally between the Parties, pending a determination by the Tribunal as
to the final allocation of those fees and expenses. The fees and expenses of the
Tribunal, including those of the PCA Registry, amount to Euros 254,595.75.
{nm accordance with Article 40(1) of the Rules, those fees and expenses shal] be
paid in their entirety by PV,

213, Save for the unidentified "miscellaneous" item included in “other
disbursements and expenses” claimed by the Czech Republic, PV shall also pay the
legal fees and expenses of the Czech Republic, which the Tribunal fixes at
Cr, 80,817,757.15. . .
